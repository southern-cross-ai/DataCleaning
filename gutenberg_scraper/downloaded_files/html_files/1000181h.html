  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; OF A STRANGE TREASURE TROVE AND A DOUBLE
     LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE attendant at the cloak room at Fenchurch Street Station
  glanced at the ticket which had just been handed to him by a tall, hawk-faced
  and rather anxious-looking man, and ran an inquiring eye over the assemblage
  of trunks, bags and other objects that crowded the floor of the room.</p>

  <p>"Wooden, iron-bound case, you said?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Name of Dobson on the label. That looks like the one," he added,
  craning over the barrier and watching eagerly as the attendant threaded his
  way among the litter of packages.</p>

  <p>"Dobson it is," the man confirmed, stooping over the case, and, with an
  obviously puzzled expression, comparing the ticket that had been pasted on it
  with the counterfoil which he held in his hand. "Rum affair, though," he
  added. "It seems to be your case but it has got the wrong number on it. Will
  you come in and have a look at it and see that it is all right?"</p>

  <p>The presumptive owner offered no objection. On the contrary, he raised the
  bar of the barrier with the greatest alacrity and took the shortest route
  among the trunks and portmanteaux until he arrived at the place where the
  case was standing. And then his expression became even more puzzled than that
  of the attendant.</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What is?" demanded the attendant.</p>

  <p>"Why!" the other explained, "it is the right name and the same sort of
  case; but this is not the label that I wrote and I don't believe that it is
  the same case."</p>

  <p>The attendant regarded him with a surprised grin and again remarked that
  "it was a rum affair," adding, after a reflective pause: "It rather looks as
  if there had been some mistake, as there easily might be with two cases
  exactly alike and the same name on both. Were the contents of your case of
  any particular value?"</p>

  <p>"They were, indeed!" the owner exclaimed in an agitated tone. "That case
  contained property worth several thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The attendant whistled and apparently began to see things in a new light,
  for he asked a little anxiously: "When do you say you deposited the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Late on Saturday evening."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought I remembered," said the attendant. "Then the muddle, if
  there has been one, must have happened yesterday. I wasn't here then. It was
  my Sunday off. But are you quite sure that this is really not your case?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly is not the label that I wrote," was the reply. "But I won't
  swear that it is a different case; though I don't think that it is the right
  one. But you see, as the name on the label is my name and the address is my
  address, it can't be a matter of a simple mistake. It looks like a case of
  deliberate substitution. And that seems to be borne out by the fact that the
  change must have been made on a Sunday when the regular attendant was not
  here."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the other agreed, "there's no denying that it does look a bit
  fishy. But look here, sir; if your name and address is on the label, you are
  entitled to assume that this is your case. As you say, it is either yours or
  it is a deliberate substitute, and, in either case, you have the right to
  open it and see if your property is inside. That will settle the question
  right away. I can lend you a screw-driver."</p>

  <p>The presumptive owner caught eagerly at the suggestion and began forthwith
  to untie the thick cord which surrounded the case. The screw-driver was
  produced, and, while the official turned away to attend to two other clients,
  it was plied vigorously on the eight long screws by which the lid of the case
  was secured.</p>

  <p>The two newcomers, of whom one appeared to be an American and the other an
  Englishman, had come to claim a number of trunks and travelling-bags; and as
  some of these, especially those belonging to the American gentleman, were of
  imposing dimensions, the attendant prudently admitted them that they might
  identify their packages and so save unnecessary hauling about. While they
  were carrying out their search he returned to Mr. Dobson and watched him as
  he extracted the last of the screws.</p>

  <p>"Now we shall see whether there has been any jiggery pokery," he remarked,
  when the screw had been laid down with the others, and Mr. Dobson prepared to
  raise the lid. And in fact they did see; and a very singular effect the sight
  had on them both. Mr. Dobson sprang back with a gasp of horror and the
  attendant uttered the single word "Golly!"</p>

  <p>After staring into the case incredulously for a couple of amazed seconds,
  Dobson slammed down the lid and demanded, breathlessly, "Where can I find a
  policeman?"</p>

  <p>"You'll find one somewhere near the barrier or else just outside the
  station. Or you could get on the phone and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dobson did not wait to hear the conclusion of the sentence but darted
  out towards the barrier and disappeared in the direction of the main
  entrance. Meanwhile, the two strangers, who had apparently overheard Mr.
  Dobson's question, abandoned for the time being the inspection of their
  luggage and approached the case, on which the attendant's eyes were still
  riveted.</p>

  <p>"Anything amiss?" the Englishman asked.</p>

  <p>The attendant made no reply but silently lifted the lid of the case, held
  it up for a moment or two and then let it drop.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed the Englishman, "it looks like a man's head!"</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> a man's head," the attendant confirmed. And, in fact, there
  was no doubt about it, though only a hairy crown was visible, through a
  packing of clothes or rags.</p>

  <p>"Who is the chappie who has just bolted out?" the Englishman inquired. "He
  seemed mightily taken aback."</p>

  <p>"So would you have been," the attendant retorted, "if you had come to
  claim a package and found this in its place." He followed up this remark with
  a brief summary of the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Well!" observed the American, "I have heard it said that exchange is no
  robbery, but I guess that the party who made this exchange got the best of
  the deal."</p>

  <p>The Englishman grinned. "You are right there, Mr. Pippet," said he. "I've
  heard of a good many artful dodges for disposing of a superfluous corpse, but
  I have never heard of a murderer swapping it for a case of jewellery or
  bullion."</p>

  <p>The three men stood silently looking at the case and occasionally glancing
  round in the direction of the entrance. Presently the American inquired:</p>

  <p>"Is there any particular scarcity of policemen in this city?"</p>

  <p>The attendant looked round again anxiously towards the entrance.</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> a long time finding that policeman," said he in reply to the
  implied comment.</p>

  <p>"Yes," rejoined Mr. Pippet; "and I guess that policeman will be a long
  time finding him."</p>

  <p>The attendant turned on him with a distinctly startled expression.</p>

  <p>"You don't think he has done a bunk, do you?" he asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Pippet, "he didn't waste any time in getting outside, and
  he doesn't seem to have had much luck in what he went for. I reckon one of us
  had better have a try. You know the place better than I do, Buffham."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, if you would," urged the attendant. "I can't leave the place
  myself. But I think we ought to have a constable as soon as possible, and it
  does rather look as if that gent had mizzled."</p>

  <p>On this, Mr. Buffham turned and rapidly made his way through the litter of
  trunks and packages and strode away towards the entrance through which he
  vanished, while the attendant reluctantly tore himself away from the
  mysterious case to hand out one or two rugs and suit-cases, and Mr. Pippet
  resumed his salvage operations on his trunks and portmanteaux. In less than
  three minutes Mr. Buffham was seen returning with a constable, and the
  attendant raised the barrier to admit them. Apparently, Mr. Buffham had given
  the officer a general sketch of the circumstances as they had come along, for
  the latter remarked, as he eyed the case:</p>

  <p>"So this is the box of mystery, is it? And you say that there is a
  person's head inside it?"</p>

  <p>"You can see for yourself," said the attendant; and with this he raised
  the lid, and, having peered in, he looked at the constable, who, after an
  impassive and judicial survey, admitted that it did look like a man's head,
  and produced from his pocket a portentous, black note book.</p>

  <p>"The first question," said he, "is about this man who has absconded. Can
  you give me a description of him?"</p>

  <p>The three men consulted and between them evolved a description which might
  have been illuminating to anyone who was intimately acquainted with the
  absent stranger, but furnished indifferent material for the identification of
  an unknown individual. They agreed, however, that he was somewhat tall and
  dark, with a thin face, a Torpedo beard and moustache, and a rather prominent
  nose; that he was dressed in dark-coloured clothing and wore a soft felt hat.
  Mr. Pippet further expressed the opinion that the man's hair and beard were
  dyed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the constable, closing his note book, "he seems to have been a
  good deal like other people. They usually are. That's the worst of it. If
  people who commit crimes would only be a bit more striking in their
  appearance and show a little originality in the way they dress, it would make
  things so much more simple for us. But it's a queer affair. The puzzle is
  what he came here for, and why, having come, he proceeded to do a bolt. He
  couldn't have known what was in the case, or he wouldn't have come. And, if
  the case wasn't his, I don't see why he should have hopped it and put himself
  under suspicion. I had better take your names and addresses, gentlemen, as
  you saw him, though you don't seem to have much to tell. Then I think I will
  get on the phone to headquarters."</p>

  <p>He re-opened the note book and, having taken down the names and addresses
  of the two gentlemen, went out in search of the telephone.</p>

  <p>As he departed, Mr. Pippet, apparently dismissing the mysterious case from
  his mind as an affair finished and done with, reverted to the practical
  business of sorting out his luggage, in which occupation he was presently
  joined by Mr. Buffham.</p>

  <p>"I am going to get a taxi," said the former, "to take me to my
  hotel&mdash;the Pendennis in Great Russell Street. Can I put you down
  anywhere? I see you're travelling pretty light."</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham cast a deprecating eye on the modest portmanteau which
  contained his entire outfit and a questioning eye on the imposing array of
  trunks and bags which appertained to his companion, and reflected for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"The taxi-man will jib at your lot," said he, "without adding mine to
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Pippet, "I shall have to get two taxis in any case, so one
  of them can't complain of an extra package. Where are you putting up?"</p>

  <p>"I am staying for a few days at a boarding house in Woburn Place; not so
  very far from you. But I was thinking that, when we have disposed of our
  traps, you might come and have some dinner with me at a restaurant that I
  know of. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the fact is," said Pippet, "that I was just about to make the very
  same proposal, only I was going to suggest that we dine together at my hotel.
  And, if you don't mind, I think it will be the better plan, as I have got a
  suite of rooms that we can retire to after dinner for a quiet yarn. Do you
  mind?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham did not mind. On the contrary, he accepted with something
  approaching eagerness. For his own reasons, he had resolved to cultivate the
  not very intimate acquaintanceship which had been established during the
  voyage from New York to Tilbury, and he was better pleased to do so at Mr.
  Pippet's expense than at his own; and the mention of the suite of rooms had
  strongly confirmed him in his resolution. A man who chartered a suite of
  rooms at a London hotel must be something more than substantial. But Mr.
  Pippet's next observation gave him less satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You are wondering, I suppose, what a solitary male like me can want with
  a suite of rooms all to himself. The explanation is that I am not all by
  myself. I am expecting my daughter and sister over from Paris tomorrow, and I
  can't have them hanging about in the public rooms with no corner to call
  their own. But, until they arrive, I am what they call <i>en gar&ccedil;on</i> over
  there."</p>

  <p>Having thus made clear his position, Mr. Pippet went forth and shortly
  returned accompanied by two taxi-men of dour aspect and taciturn habit, who
  silently collected the baggage and bore it out to their respective vehicles,
  which, in due course, set forth upon their journey.</p>

  <p>Before following them, we may linger awhile to note the results of the
  constable's mission. They were not very sensational. In the course of a few
  minutes, an inspector arrived, and, having made a brief confirmatory
  inspection, called for the screws and the screwdriver and proceeded in an
  impassive but workmanlike manner to replace the former in their holes and
  drive them home. Then he, in his turn, sent out for a taxi-man, by whom the
  case with its gruesome contents was borne out unsuspectingly to the waiting
  vehicle and spirited away to an unknown destination.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Buffham's solitary portmanteau had been dumped down in the hall
  of a somewhat seedy house in Woburn Place, the two taxis moved on to the
  portals of the quiet but select hotel in Great Russell Street, where the
  mountainous pile of baggage was handed over to the hotel porter with brief
  directions as to its disposal. Then the two men, after the necessary
  ablutions, made their way to the dining-room and selected a table in a
  comparatively retired corner, where Mr. Buffham waited in some anxiety as to
  the quality of the entertainment. His experience of middle-aged American men
  had given him the impression that they were not, as a class, enthusiastic
  feeders, and it was with sensible relief that he discovered in his host the
  capacity to take a reasonable interest in his food. In fact, the gastronomic
  arrangements were so much to his satisfaction that, for a time, they engaged
  his entire attention; for, if the whole truth must be told, this dinner was
  not an entirely unforeseen contingency, and, as he had providently modified
  his diet with that possibility in view, he was now in a condition to do
  complete justice to the excellent fare provided. Presently, however, when the
  razor-edge had been taken off his appetite, his attention reverted to larger
  interests and he began cautiously to throw out feelers. Not that an extreme
  amount of caution was really necessary, for Mr. Pippet was a simple,
  straightforward, open-minded man; shrewd enough in the ordinary business of
  life and gifted with a massive common-sense. But he was quite devoid of
  cunning, and trustful of his fellow-creatures to an extent that is somewhat
  unusual in citizens of the United States. He was, in fact, the exact opposite
  in mental and moral type of the man who faced him across the table.</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Buffham, raising his newly-refilled glass, "here's to a
  successful beano. I suppose you contemplate laying a delicate wash of carmine
  over the British landscape. Or is it to be a full tint of vermilion?"</p>

  <p>"Now you are talking in tropes and metaphors," said Pippet, with an
  indulgent smile, "but, as I interpret the idiom, you think we are going to
  make things hum."</p>

  <p>"I assume that you are over here to have a good time."</p>

  <p>"We always like to have a good time if we can manage it, wherever we may
  be," said Pippet, "and I hope to pass the time pleasantly while I am in the
  Old Country. But I have come over with a more definite purpose than that;
  and, if I should tell you what that purpose is, I should make you smile."</p>

  <p>"And a very pleasant result, too," said Buffham. "I like to be made to
  smile. But, of course, I don't want to pry into your private affairs, even
  for the sake of a smile."</p>

  <p>"My private affairs will probably soon be public affairs," said Pippet,
  "so I need not maintain any particular reticence about them; and, in any
  case, there's nothing to be ashamed or secret about. If it interests you to
  know, my visit to England is connected with a claim to an English title and
  the estates that go with it."</p>

  <p>Buffham was thunderstruck. But he did not smile. The affair was much too
  serious for that. Instead, he demanded in a hushed voice: "Do you mean that
  you are making a claim on your own behalf?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet chuckled. "Sounds incredible, doesn't it? But that is the
  cold-drawn fact. I am setting up a claim to the Earldom of Winsborough and to
  the lands and other property that appertain to it, all of which I understand
  to be at present vacant and calling aloud for an owner."</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham pulled himself together. This looked like a good deal bigger
  affair than he had anticipated. Indeed, he had not anticipated anything in
  particular. His professional habits&mdash;if we may so designate
  them&mdash;led him to cultivate the society of rich men of all kinds, and by
  preference that of wealthy Americans making an European tour. Not that the
  globe-trotting American is a peculiarly simple and trustful soul. But he is
  in a holiday mood; he is in unaccustomed surroundings and usually has money
  to spend and a strong inclination to spend it. Mr. Buffham's role was to
  foster that inclination, and, as far as possible, to collaborate in the
  associated activities. He had proposed to fasten upon Mr. Pippet, if he
  could, in a Micawber-like hope that something profitable might turn up. But
  the prospect opened up by Mr. Pippet's announcement was beyond his wildest
  dreams.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Mr. Pippet continued after a brief pause, "you are wondering
  what in creation a middle-aged American in comfortable circumstances wants
  with an English title and estates?"</p>

  <p>"I am not wondering anything of the kind," replied Buffham. "The position
  of a great English nobleman is one that might well tempt the ambition of an
  American if he were twenty times a millionaire. Think of the august dignity
  of that position! Of the universal deference that it commands! Think of the
  grand old mansions and the parks planted with immemorial trees, the great
  town house and the seat in the House of Lords, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," chuckled Pippet, "I've had all that rubbed into me, and, to
  tell the bald truth, I wouldn't give a damn for the whole boiling if I had
  only myself to consider. I don't want to have people calling me 'My Lord' and
  making me feel like a fool; and I've no use for baronial mansions or
  ancestral halls. A good comfortable hotel where they know how to cook answers
  all my requirements. But I've got to go in for this business whether I like
  it or not. My womenfolk have got me fairly in tow, especially my sister.
  She's just mad to be Lady Arminella&mdash;in fact, if I hadn't put my foot
  down she'd have settled the matter in advance and taken the title on account,
  so to speak."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Buffham, "you have got your claim pretty well cut and
  dried? Got all your evidence, I mean, and arranged with your lawyer as to the
  plan of campaign?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no!" replied Pippet, "at present things are rather in the air. But,
  if we have finished, perhaps we might take our coffee up in my sitting room.
  We can talk more freely there. But don't let me bore you. After all, it isn't
  your funeral."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir!" exclaimed Buffham, with genuine sincerity, "you are not
  boring me. I assure you that I am profoundly interested. If you won't
  consider me inquisitive, I should like to hear the whole story in as much
  detail as you care to give."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet nodded and smiled. "Good!" said he, as they ascended the stairs
  to the private suite, "you shall have all the detail you want. I shall enjoy
  giving it to you, as it will help to get the affair into my own head a trifle
  more clearly. It's a queer story and I must admit that it does not sound any
  too convincing. The whole claim rests upon a tradition that I heard from my
  father."</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham was a little disappointed; but only a little. As his host had
  said, it&mdash;the claim&mdash;was not his funeral. A wild cat claim might
  answer his purpose as well as any other; perhaps even better. Nevertheless,
  he remarked with an assumption of anxiety: "I hope there is something to go
  on besides the tradition. You'll have to deal with a court of law, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realize that," replied Pippet, "and I may say that there is some
  corroborative matter. I'll tell you about that presently. But there's this
  much about the tradition; that it admits of being put to the test, as you'll
  see when I give you the story. And I will do that right away.</p>

  <p>"The tradition, then, as I had it from my father from time to time, in
  rather disjointed fragments, was that <i>his</i> father was a very remarkable
  character; in fact, he was two characters rolled into one, for he led a
  double life. As my father and mother knew him, he was Mr. Josiah Pippet, the
  landlord of a house of call in the City of London known as 'The Fox and
  Grapes.' But a persistent tradition had it that the name of Josiah Pippet was
  an assumed name and that he was really the Earl of Winsborough. It is known
  that he was in the habit of absenting himself from his London premises from
  time to time and that when he did so he disappeared completely, leaving no
  hint of his whereabouts. Now, it seems that the Earl, who was a bachelor, was
  a somewhat eccentric gentleman of similar habits. <i>He</i> also was
  accustomed periodically to absent himself from the Castle, and he also used
  to disappear, leaving no clue to his whereabouts. And rumour had it that
  these disappearances were, as the scientists would say, correlated; like the
  little figures in those old-fashioned toy houses that foretold the weather.
  When the old man came out, the old woman went in, and <i>vice versa.</i> So
  it was said that when Josiah disappeared from 'The Fox and Grapes,' his
  lordship made his appearance at Winsborough Castle; and when his lordship
  disappeared from the Castle, Josiah popped up at 'The Fox and Grapes.'"</p>

  <p>"Is there any record of the movements of the two men?" Buffham asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, there is a diary, along with a lot of letters and other stuff. I
  have just glanced at some of it but I can't I say of my own observation that
  there is a definite record. However, my sister has gone through the whole lot
  and she says that it is all as plain as a pike-staff."</p>

  <p>Buffham nodded with an air of satisfaction that was by no means assumed.
  He began to see splendid possibilities in his host's case.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he, "this is much more hopeful. If you can show that these
  disappearances coincided in time, that will be a very striking piece of
  evidence. You have got these documents with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have got them in a deed box in my bedroom. I have been intending
  to make a serious attack on them and to go right through them."</p>

  <p>"What would be much more to the point," said Buffham, "would be to hand
  the box to your lawyer and let him go through them. He will be accustomed to
  examining documents, and he will see the significance&mdash;the legal
  significance, I mean&mdash;of little, inconspicuous facts that might easily
  escape a non-professional eye. I think you said you had a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"No. That's a matter that I shall have to attend to at once; and I don't
  quite know how to go about it. I understand that they don't advertise in this
  country."</p>

  <p>"No," said Buffham, "certainly not. But I see your difficulty. You
  naturally want to get a suitable man, and it <i>is</i> most important. You
  want to secure the services of a solicitor whose position and character would
  command the respect and confidence of the court, and who has had experience
  of cases of a similar kind. That is absolutely vital. I recall a case which
  illustrates the danger of employing a lawyer of an unsuitable kind. It was,
  like yours, a case of disputed succession. There were two claimants whom we
  may call 'A' and 'B.' Now Mr. 'A' had undoubtedly the better case. But
  unfortunately for him, he employed a solicitor whose sole experience was
  concerned with commercial law. He was an excellent man, but he knew
  practically nothing of the intricacies of succession to landed property. Mr.
  'B,' on the other hand, had the good fortune to secure a lawyer whose
  practice had been very largely concerned with these very cases. He knew all
  the ropes, you see; and the result was that the case was decided in Mr. 'B's'
  favour. But it ought not to have been. I had it, in confidence, from his
  lawyer (whom I happened to know rather well) that if he had been acting for
  Mr. <i>'A,'</i> instead of for Mr. 'B,' the decision would certainly have
  gone the other way. 'A' had the better claim, but his lawyer had not realized
  it and had failed to put it before the court in a sufficiently convincing
  manner."</p>

  <p>Having given this striking instance, Buffham looked anxiously at his host,
  and was a trifle disappointed at its effect. Still more so was he with that
  gentleman's comment.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me," the latter remarked, "that that court wasn't particularly
  on the spot if they let your lawyer friend bluff them into giving Mr. 'B' the
  property that properly belonged to Mr. <i>'A.'</i> And I shouldn't have
  thought that your friend would have found it a satisfactory deal. At any
  rate, I am not wanting any lawyer to grab property for me that belongs to
  somebody else. As long as I believe in this claim myself, I'm going for it
  for all I am worth. But I am not going to drop my egg into somebody else's
  rightful nest, like your Mr. B.'"</p>

  <p>"Of course you are not!" Buffham hastened to reply, considerably
  disconcerted by his host's unexpected attitude; so difficult is it for a
  radically dishonest man to realize that his is not the usual and normal state
  of mind. "But neither do you want to find yourself in the position of Mr.
  'A.'"</p>

  <p>"No," Pippet admitted, "I don't. I just want a square deal, and I always
  understood that you could get it in an English court."</p>

  <p>"So you can," said Buffham. "But you must realize that a court can only
  decide on the facts and arguments put before it. It is the business of the
  lawyers to supply those facts and arguments. And I think you are hardly just
  to my lawyer friend&mdash;his name, by the way, is Gimbler&mdash;a most
  honourable and conscientious man. I must point out that a lawyer's duty is to
  present his client's case in the most forcible and convincing way that he
  can. He is not concerned with the other man's case. He assumes&mdash;and so
  does the court&mdash;that the opposing lawyer will do the same for his
  client; and then the court will have both cases completely presented. It is
  the client's business to employ a lawyer who is competent to put his case
  properly to the court."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet nodded. "Yes," he said, reflectively, "I see the idea. But the
  difficulty in the case of a stranger like myself is to find the particular
  kind of lawyer who has the special knowledge and experience that is required.
  Now, as to this friend of yours, Gimbler; you say that he specializes in
  disputed claims to property."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that he specialized in them, but I know that he has had
  considerable experience of them."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, do you suppose that he would be willing to take up this claim
  of mine?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham did not suppose at all. He knew. Nevertheless he replied
  warily:</p>

  <p>"It depends. He wouldn't want to embark on a case that was going to result
  in a fiasco. He would want to hear an about the claim and what evidence there
  is to support it. And especially he would want to go very carefully through
  those documents of yours."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pippet, "that seems to be the correct line, and that is what I
  should want him to do. I'd like to have an expert opinion on the whole affair
  before I begin to get busy. I am not out to exploit a mare's nest and make a
  public fool of myself. But we didn't finish the story. We only got to the Box
  and Cox business of Josiah and the Earl. It seems that this went on for a
  number of years, and nothing seems to have been thought of it at the time.
  But when Josiah's wife died and his son&mdash;my father&mdash;was settled, he
  appears to have wearied of the complications of his double life and made up
  his mind to put an end to them. And the simplest and most conclusive way to
  write Finis on the affair seemed to him to be to die and get buried. And that
  is what he did. According to the story, he faked a last illness and
  engineered a sham death. I don't know how he managed it. Seems to me pretty
  difficult. But the rumour had it that he managed to get people to believe
  that he had died, and he had a funeral with a dummy coffin, properly weighted
  with lumps of lead, and that this was successfully planted in the family
  vault. I am bound to admit that this part of the story does sound a trifle
  thin. But it seems to have been firmly believed in the family."</p>

  <p>It would have been a relief to Mr. Buffham to snigger aloud. But
  sniggering was not his role. Still, he felt called on to make some kind of
  criticism. Accordingly, he remarked judicially:</p>

  <p>"There do certainly seem to be difficulties; the death certificate, for
  instance. You would hardly expect a doctor to mistake a live, healthy man for
  a corpse&mdash;unless Josiah made it worth his while. It would be simple
  enough then."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Mr. Pippet, "that doctors often used to give a
  certificate without viewing the body. But the lawyer will know that. At any
  rate, it is obvious that someone must have been in the know; and that is
  probably how the rumour got started."</p>

  <p>"And when did the Earl die?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't tell you, off hand. But it was some years after Josiah's
  funeral."</p>

  <p>"And who holds the title and estate now?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody; at least, so I understand. The last&mdash;or present&mdash;Earl
  went away to Africa or some other uncivilized place, big game shooting, and
  never came back. As there was never any announcement of the Earl's death,
  things seem to have drifted on as if he was alive. I have never heard of any
  claimant."</p>

  <p>"There couldn't be until the Earl's death was either proved or presumed by
  the permission of the court. So the first thing that you will have to do will
  be to take proceedings to have the death of the Earl presumed."</p>

  <p>"Not the first thing," said Pippet. "There is one question that will have
  to be settled before we definitely make the claim. The tradition says that
  Josiah's death was a fake and that his coffin was a dummy weighted with lead.
  Now, that is a statement of fact that admits of proof or disproof. The first
  thing that we have got to do is to get that coffin open. If we find Josiah
  inside, that will settle the whole business, and I shan't care a hoot whether
  the Earl is alive or dead."</p>

  <p>Once again Mr. Buffham was sensible of a slight feeling of disappointment.
  In a man who was prepared to consider seriously such a manifestly
  preposterous cock and bull story as this, he had not looked for so reasonable
  a state of mind. Of course, Pippet was quite right from his own idiotic point
  of view. The opening of the coffin was the <i>experimentum crucis.</i> And
  when it was opened, there, of course, would be the body, and the bubble would
  be most effectively burst. But Mr. Buffham did not want the bubble burst. The
  plan which was shaping itself vaguely in his mind was concerned with keeping
  that bubble in a healthy state of inflation. And again, his crooked mind
  found it hard to understand Pippet's simple, honest, straightforward outlook.
  If he had been the claimant, his strongest efforts would have been devoted to
  seeing that nobody meddled with that coffin. And he had a feeling that his
  friend Gimbler would take the same view.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he conceded, "you are perfectly correct; but there may be
  difficulties that you don't quite realize. I don't know how it is in America,
  but in this country you can't just dig up a coffin and open it if you want to
  know who is inside. There are all sorts of formalities before you can get
  permission; and I doubt whether faculty would be granted until you had made
  out some sort of a case in the courts. So the moral is that you must get as
  impressive a body of evidence together as you can. Have you got any other
  facts besides what you have told me? For instance, do you know what these two
  men&mdash;Josiah and the Earl&mdash;were like? Do they appear to have
  resembled each other?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet grinned. "If Josiah and the Earl," said he, "were one and the
  same person, they would naturally be a good deal alike. I understand that
  they were. That is one of the strong points of the story. Both of them were a
  bit out-size; well over six feet in height. Both were fair, blue-eyed men
  with a shaved upper lip and long sandy side-whiskers."</p>

  <p>"You can prove that, can you?"</p>

  <p>"I can swear that I had information to that effect from my father, who
  knew one and had seen the other. And there is one other point; only a small
  one, but every little bit of corroboration helps. My father told me on
  several occasions that his father&mdash;Josiah&mdash;had often told him that
  he was born in Winsborough Castle."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Buffham, "that's better. That establishes a definite
  connexion. It's a pity, though, that he was not more explicit. And now, with
  regard to these documents that you spoke of; what is the nature of them?"</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," replied Pippet, "I don't know much about them.
  I've been used to an active life and I'm not a great reader, so I've not done
  much more than glance over them. But, as I mentioned, my sister has gone
  through them carefully and she reckons that they as good as prove that Josiah
  and the Earl were one and the same person. Would you like to have a look at
  them?"</p>

  <p>A mere affirmative would have been inadequate to express Mr. Buffham's
  ravenous desire to see whether there was or was not the making of a possible
  legal case. Nevertheless, he replied in a tone of studied indifference:</p>

  <p>"My opinion is not much to the point, but I should certainly like to see
  what sort of material you will be able to give your lawyer."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Mr. Pippet retired to the bedroom, from which he presently
  emerged carrying a good-sized deed box. This he placed on the table, and,
  having gone deliberately through a large bunch of keys, eventually selected
  one and carefully fitted it into the lock while Buffham watched him hungrily.
  The box being opened, the two men drew their chairs up to the table and
  peered into its interior; which was occupied by a collection of bundles of
  papers, neatly tied up with red tape, each bundle being distinguished by
  means of a label inscribed in an old-fashioned feminine handwriting. In
  addition, there were seven small, leather-bound volumes.</p>

  <p>Buffham picked out the bundles, one after another, and read the labels.
  "Letters from J.S. to his wife," "Letters from various persons to J.S.,"
  "Copies of letters from J.S. to various persons," "Various tradesmen's bills
  and accounts," and so on. Having asked his host's permission, he untied one
  or two of the bundles and read samples of the letters and tradesmen's bills
  with a feeling of stupefaction, mingled with astonished speculations as to
  the mental peculiarities of his host's sister.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, gloomily replacing the last of them, "I dare say a careful
  analysis of these letters may yield some relevant information, but it will
  need the expert eye of the trained lawyer to detect the relevancy of some of
  them. There is, for instance, a bill for two pounds of pork sausages and a
  black pudding, which seems rather beside the mark. But you never know.
  Important legal points may be involved in the most unexpected matter. What
  are those little books? Are they the diaries that you spoke of?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet nodded and handed one of them to him, which proved to be the
  diary for the year 1833. He turned over the leaves and scanned the entries
  with more interest but still with a feeling of bewilderment. After examining
  a few sample pages, he handed the volume back to Pippet, remarking a little
  wearily:</p>

  <p>"The late Josiah didn't go into much detail. The entries are very dry and
  brief and seem to be concerned chiefly with the trivial happenings of his
  life from day to day and with money paid or received."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that what diaries are usually filled with?"</p>

  <p>Pippet protested, not unreasonably. "And don't you think that those
  simple, commonplace entries are just the ones to give us the information that
  we want? My sister said that she learned quite a lot about Josiah's ways of
  life from those diaries."</p>

  <p>"Did she?" said Buffham. "I am glad to hear it; because it suggests that a
  trained lawyer, going through those diaries with the legal issues in his
  mind, noting, collating and analyzing the entries, will probably discover
  significances in the most unexpected places. Which brings us back to the
  point that you ought to get competent legal assistance without delay."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you are right," agreed Pippet. "I've got to secure a lawyer
  sooner or later, so I might as well start right away. Now, to come down to
  brass tacks, what about this lawyer friend of yours? You say that this case
  of mine would be in his customary line of business; and you think he would be
  willing to take it on?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Buffham had no doubts whatever, but he did not think it expedient to
  say so. A retreating tendency on the part of the bait is apt to produce a
  pursuing tendency on the part of the fish.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said he, "I can't answer for another man's views. He is a
  busy man, and he might not be prepared to give time to what he might regard
  as a somewhat speculative case. But we can easily find out. If you like, I
  will call on him and put the case to him in as favourable a light as
  possible, and, if he doesn't seem eager to take it up, I might use a little
  gentle pressure. You see, I know him pretty well. Then, if I am successful, I
  might arrange for you to have an interview, at which, perhaps, it might be
  advisable for your sister to be present, as she knows more about the affair
  than you do. Then he could tell you what he thought of your chances and you
  could let him know what you are prepared to do. What do you think of that
  plan?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet thought that it seemed to meet the case, provided that it could
  be carried out without delay.</p>

  <p>"You understand," said he, "that my sister and daughter will be arriving
  here tomorrow, and they will be red-hot to get the business started,
  especially my sister."</p>

  <p>"And quite naturally, too," said Buffham. "I sympathize with her
  impatience and I promise that there shall be no delay on my part. I will call
  at Gimbler's office tomorrow morning the first thing, before he has had time
  to begin his morning's work."</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you," said Pippet, as his guest rose to take his leave,
  "to interest yourself in this way in the affairs of a mere stranger."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Buffham rejoined cheerily. "You are forgetting the romance
  and dramatic interest of your case. Anyone would be delighted to lend you a
  hand in your adventure. You may depend on hearing from me in the course of
  tomorrow. Good night and good luck!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet, having provided his guest with a fresh cigar, accompanied him
  down to the entrance and watched him with a meditative eye as he walked away
  down the street. Apparently, the dwindling figure suggested a train of
  thought, for he continued to stand looking out even after it had disappeared.
  At length he turned with a faint sigh and thoughtfully retraced his steps to
  his own domain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II.&mdash; MR. BUFFHAM'S LEGAL FRIEND</h2>

  <p class="first">NO amount of native shrewdness can entirely compensate for
  deficiency of knowledge. If Mr. Christopher Pippet had been intimately
  acquainted with English social customs, he would have known that the
  neighbourhood of Kennington in general and Kennington Grove in particular, is
  hardly the place in which to look for the professional premises of a
  solicitor engaged in important Chancery practice. He did, indeed, survey the
  rather suburban surroundings with a certain amount of surprise, noting with
  intelligent interest the contrast between the ways of New York and those of
  London. He even ventured to comment on the circumstance as he halted at the
  iron gate of a small garden and read out the inscription on a well-worn brass
  plate affixed to the gate aforesaid; which set forth the name and
  professional vocation of Mr. Horatio Gimbler, Solicitor and Advocate.</p>

  <p>"Buffham didn't tell me that he was an advocate as well as a solicitor,"
  Mr. Pippet remarked, as he pushed the gate open.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't," replied his companion, "but left you to find out for
  yourself. Of course he knew you would, and then you would give him credit for
  having understated his friend's merits. It's just vanity."</p>

  <p>At the street door, which was closed and bore a duplicate plate, Mr.
  Pippet pressed an electric bell-push, with the result that there arose from
  within a sound like the "going off" of an alarm clock and simultaneously the
  upper half of a face with a pair of beady black eyes appeared for an instant
  above the wire blind of the adjacent window. Then, after a brief interval,
  the door opened and revealed an extremely alert youth of undeniably Hebraic
  aspect.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Gimbler disengaged?" Mr. Pippet inquired.</p>

  <p>"Have you got an appointment?" the youth demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; eleven o'clock; and it's two minutes to the hour now. Shall I go in
  here?"</p>

  <p>He turned towards a door opening out of the hall and marked "Waiting
  Room."</p>

  <p>"No," the youth replied, hastily, emphatically and almost in a tone of
  alarm. "That'th for clienth that haven't got an appointment. What name thall
  I thay?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. and Miss Pippet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yeth, I know. Jutht thtep thith way."</p>

  <p>He opened an inner door leading into a small inner hall, which offered to
  the visitors a prospect of a flight of shabbily carpeted stairs and a strong
  odour of fried onions. Here he approached a door marked "Private Office" and
  knocked softly, eliciting a responsive but inarticulate roar; whereupon he
  opened the door and announced: "Mr. and Miss Pippet."</p>

  <p>The opened door revealed a large man with a pair of folding pince-nez
  insecurely balanced on the end of a short, fat nose, apparently writing
  furiously. As the visitors entered, he looked round with an interrogative
  frown as if impatient of being interrupted. Then, appearing suddenly to
  realize who they were, he made a convulsive grimace, which dislodged the
  eyeglasses and left them dangling free on their broad black ribbon, and was
  succeeded by a wrinkly but affable smile. Then he rose, and, holding out a
  large, rather fat hand, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Delighted to see you. I had no idea that it was so late. One gets so
  engrossed in these&mdash;er&mdash;fascinating&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Mr. Pippet, "though I thought it was the documents that
  got engrossed. However, here we are. Let me introduce you to my sister, Miss
  Arminella Pippet."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler bowed, and, for a brief space there was a searching mutual
  inspection. Miss Pippet saw a physically imposing man, large in all
  dimensions&mdash;tall, broad, deep-chested and still more deep in the region
  immediately below the chest; with a large, massive head, rather bald and very
  closely cropped, a large, rather fat face, marked with wrinkles suggestive of
  those on the edge of a pair of bellows, and singularly small pale blue eyes,
  which tended to become still smaller, even to total disappearance, when he
  smiled. Through those little blue eyes, Mr. Gimbler saw a woman, shortish in
  stature but majestic in carriage and conveying an impression of exuberant
  energy and vivacity. And this impression was reinforced by the strong, mobile
  face with its firm mouth set above the square, pugnacious chin and below a
  rather formidable Roman nose, which latter gave to her a certain suggestive
  resemblance to a bird, a resemblance accentuated by her quick movements. But
  the bird suggested was not the dove. In short, Miss Arminella Pippet was a
  somewhat remarkable-looking lady with a most unmistakeable "presence." She
  might have been a dame of the old French noblesse; and Mr. Gimbler, looking
  at her through his little blue eyes and bearing in mind the peerage claim,
  decided that she looked the part. He also decided&mdash;comparing her with
  her mild-faced brother&mdash;that the grey mare was the better horse and must
  claim his chief attention. He was not the first who had undervalued Mr.
  Christopher Pippet.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the latter, sitting down with some care on a rather
  infirm cane-bottomed chair (Miss Arminella occupied the only easy chair),
  "Mr. Buffham has given you some idea of the matter on which we have come to
  consult you?"</p>

  <p>"He has done more than that," said Mr. Gimbler, "and would have done more
  still if I had not stopped him. He is thrilled by your romantic story and
  wildly optimistic. If we could only get a jury of Buffhams you would walk
  into your inheritance without a breath of opposition."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think of our chances with the kind of jury that we are
  likely to get?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler pursed up his lips and shook his massive head.</p>

  <p>"We mustn't begin giving opinions at this stage," said he. "Remember that
  I have only heard the story at second hand from Mr. Buffham; just a sketch of
  the nature of the case. Let us begin at the beginning and forget Mr. Buffham.
  You are claiming, I believe, to be the grandson of the late Earl of
  Winsborough. Now, I should like to hear an outline of the grounds of your
  claim before we go into any details."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he fixed an inquiring eye on Miss Pippet, who promptly
  responded by opening her hand-bag and drawing therefrom a folded sheet of
  foolscap paper.</p>

  <p>"This," said she, "is a concise statement of the nature of the claim and
  the known facts on which it is based. I thought it would save time if I wrote
  it out, as I could then leave the paper with you for reference. Will you read
  it or shall I?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler looked at the document, and, observing that it was covered
  with closely-spaced writing in a somewhat crabbed and angular hand, elected
  to listen to the reading in order that he might make a few notes. Accordingly
  Miss Pippet proceeded to read aloud from the paper with something of the air
  of a herald reading a royal proclamation, glancing from time to time at the
  lawyer to see what kind of impression it was making on him. The result of
  these inspections must have been a little disappointing, as Mr. Gimbler
  listened attentively with his eyes shut, rousing only at intervals to
  scribble a few words on a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>When she had come to the end of the statement&mdash;which repeated
  substantially, but in a more connected form, the story that her brother had
  told to Buffham&mdash;she laid the paper on the table and regarded the lawyer
  with an interrogative stare. Mr. Gimbler, having opened his eyes to their
  normal extent, directed them to his notes.</p>

  <p>"This," said he, "is a very singular and romantic story. Romantic and
  strange, and yet not really incredible. But the important question is, to
  what extent is this interesting tradition supported by provable facts? For
  instance, it is stated that when Josiah Pippet used to disappear from his
  usual places of resort, the Earl of Winsborough made his appearance at
  Winsborough Castle. Now, is there any evidence that the disappearance of
  Josiah coincided in time with the appearance of the Earl at the Castle, and
  <i>vice versa?"</i></p>

  <p>"There is the diary," said Miss Pippet.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Gimbler, genuinely surprised. "The diary makes that
  quite plain, does it?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," the lady replied. "Any way, it is quite clear to me. Whenever
  Josiah was about to make one of his disappearances, he noted in his diary
  quite unmistakably: 'Going away tomorrow for a little spell at the old
  place.' Sometimes, instead of 'the old place,' he says plainly 'the Castle.'
  Then there is a blank space of more than half a page before he records his
  arrival home at 'The Fox and Grapes.'''</p>

  <p>"H'm, yes," said Mr. Gimbler, swinging his folded eyeglass on its ribbon
  like a pendulum. "And you think that by the expression 'the old place' or
  'the Castle' he means Winsborough Castle?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how there can be any doubt of it. Obviously, 'the old place'
  must have been Winsborough Castle, where he was born."</p>

  <p>"It would seem probable," Mr. Gimbler admitted. "By the way, is there any
  evidence that he <i>was</i> born at the castle?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Miss Pippet replied a little sharply, "he said he was; and I
  suppose he knew."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, naturally," the lawyer agreed. "And you can prove that he did
  say so?"</p>

  <p>"My brother and I have heard our father repeat the statement over and over
  again. We can swear to that."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the Earl? Is there any evidence that, when Josiah
  returned home to 'The Fox and Grapes,' his Lordship disappeared from the
  Castle?"</p>

  <p>"Evidence!" Miss Pippet exclaimed, slapping her hand-bag impatiently.
  "What evidence do you want? The man couldn't be in two places at once!"</p>

  <p>"Very true," said Mr. Gimbler, fixing a slightly perplexed eye on his
  dangling glasses; "very true. He couldn't. And with regard to the sham
  funeral. Naturally there wouldn't be any reference to it in the diary, but is
  it possible to support the current rumour by any definite facts?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think the fact that my father&mdash;Josiah's own son&mdash;was
  convinced of it is definite enough?" Miss Pippet demanded, a trifle
  acidly.</p>

  <p>"It is definite enough," Gimbler admitted, "but in courts of law there is
  a slight prejudice against hearsay evidence. Direct, first-hand evidence, if
  it is possible to produce it, has a good deal more weight."</p>

  <p>"So it may," retorted Miss Pippet, "but you can't expect us to give
  first-hand evidence of a funeral that took place before we were born. I
  suppose even a court of law has a little common sense."</p>

  <p>"Still," her brother interposed, "Mr. Gimbler has put his finger on the
  really vital spot. The sham funeral is the kernel of the whole business. If
  we can prove that, we shall have something solid to go on. And we <i>can</i>
  prove it&mdash;or else disprove it, as the case may be. But it need not be
  left in the condition of what the late President Wilson would have called a
  peradventure. If that funeral was a sham, there was nothing in the coffin but
  some lumps of lead. Now, that coffin is still in existence. It is lying in
  the family vault; and if we can yank it out and open it, the Winsborough
  Peerage Claim will be as good as settled. If we find Josiah at home to
  visitors, we can let the claim drop and go for a holiday. But if we find the
  lumps of lead, according to our program, we shall hang on to the claim until
  the courts are tired of us and hand over the keys of the Castle. Mr. Gimbler
  is quite right. That coffin is the point that we have got to concentrate
  on."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Pippet developed his views, the lawyer's eyeglasses, dangling from
  their ribbon, swung more and more violently, and their owner's eyes opened to
  an unprecedented width. He had never had the slightest intention of
  concentrating on the coffin. On the contrary, that obvious means of exploding
  the delusion and toppling over the house of cards had seemed to be the rock
  that had got to be safely circumnavigated at all costs. In his view, the
  coffin was the fly in the ointment; and the discovery that it was the apple
  of Mr. Pippet's eye gave him a severe shock. And not this alone. He had
  assumed that the lady's invincible optimism represented the state of mind of
  both his clients. Now he realized that the man whom he had written down an
  amiable ass, and perhaps a dishonest ass at that, combined in his person two
  qualities most undesirable in the circumstances&mdash;hard common sense and
  transparent honesty.</p>

  <p>It was a serious complication; and as he sat with his eyes fixed on the
  swinging eyeglasses, he endeavoured rapidly to shape a new course. At length
  he replied:</p>

  <p>"Of course you are quite right, Mr. Pippet. The obvious course would be to
  examine the coffin as a preliminary measure. But English law does not always
  take the obvious course. When once a person is consigned to the tomb, the
  remains pass out of the control of the relatives and into that of the State;
  and the State views with very jealous disapproval any attempts to disturb
  those remains. In order to open a tomb or grave, and especially to open a
  coffin, it is necessary to obtain a faculty from the Home Secretary
  authorizing an exhumation. Now, before any such faculty is granted, the Home
  Secretary requires the applicant to show cause for the making of such an
  order."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pippet, "we can show cause. We want to know whether
  Josiah is in that coffin or not."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Mr. Gimbler. "A perfectly reasonable motive. But it would
  not be accepted by the Home Office. They would demand a ruling from a
  properly constituted court to the effect that the claim had been investigated
  and a <i>prima facie</i> case made out."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by a <i>prima facie</i> case?" Miss Pippet inquired.</p>

  <p>"The expression means that the claim has been stated in a court of law and
  that sufficient evidence has been produced to establish a probability that it
  is a just and reasonable claim."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," said Mr. Pippet, "that a judge and jury have got to sit
  and examine at great length whether the claim may possibly be a true claim
  before they will consent to examine a piece of evidence which will settle the
  question with practical certainty in the course of an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Gimbler admitted, "that, I am afraid is the rather unreasonable
  position. We shall have to lay the facts, so far as they are known to us,
  before the court and make out as good a case as we can. Then, if the court is
  satisfied that we have a substantial case, it will make an order for the
  exhumation, which the Home Office will confirm."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said Miss Pippet, "I don't see why we need meddle with the
  coffin at all. It seems a ghoulish proceeding."</p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with you, Miss Pippet," said Mr. Gimbler (and there is
  no possible doubt that he did). "It would be much better to deal with the
  whole affair in court if that were possible. Perhaps it may be possible to
  avoid the exhumation, after all. The court may not insist."</p>

  <p>"It won't have to insist," said Mr. Pippet. "I make it a condition that we
  ascertain beyond all doubt whether Josiah is or is not in that coffin. I want
  to make sure that I am claiming what is my just due, and I shan't be sure of
  that until that coffin has been opened. Isn't it possible for you to make an
  application to the Home Secretary without troubling the courts?"</p>

  <p>"It would be possible to make the application," Mr. Gimbler replied
  somewhat dryly. "But a refusal would be a foregone conclusion. Quite properly
  so, if you consider the conditions. The purpose of the exhumation is to
  establish the fact of the sham burial. But if that were established, you
  would be no more forward, or, at least very little. Your claim would still
  have to be stated and argued in a court of law. Of course, the proof of the
  sham burial would be material evidence, but still, your claim would stand or
  fall by the decision of the court. Naturally, the Home Office, since it
  cannot consider evidence or give a decision, is not going to give a permit
  until it is informed by the proper authority that an exhumation is necessary
  for the purposes of justice. Believe me, Mr. Pippet, we should only prejudice
  our case by trying to go behind the courts; and, moreover, we should
  certainly fail to get a permit."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Mr. Pippet. "You know best. Then I take it that there is
  not much more to say at present. We have given you the facts, such as they
  are, and we shall leave my sister's statement with you, and it will be up to
  you to consider what is to be done next."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Gimbler. "But something was said about documents&mdash;some
  letters and a diary. Are they available?"</p>

  <p>"They are," replied Mr. Pippet. "I've got the whole boiling of them in
  this box. My sister has been through them, as she mentioned to you just
  now."</p>

  <p>"And you?" Mr. Gimbler asked with a trace of anxiety, as he watched his
  client's efforts to untie the parcel. "Have you examined them
  thoroughly?"</p>

  <p>"I can't truly say that I have," was the reply, as Mr. Pippet deliberately
  opened a pocket knife and applied it to the string. "I had intended to look
  through them before I handed them to you, but Mr. Buffham assured me that it
  would be a waste of labour, as you would have to study them in any case; so,
  as I am not what you would call a studious man, and they look a pretty stodgy
  collection, I have saved myself the trouble."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe," said Miss Pippet, "that my brother cares two cents
  whether we succeed or not."</p>

  <p>The lady's suspicion was not entirely unshared by her legal adviser. But
  he made no comment, as, at this moment, Mr. Pippet, having detached the
  coverings of the parcel, and thereby disclosed the deed box which he had
  shown to Buffham, inserted a key and unlocked it.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, as he threw the lid open, "you can see that the things
  are there. Those bundles of paper are the letters and the little volumes are
  the diary. There is no need for you to look at them now. I guess you will
  like to study them at your leisure."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed Mr. Gimbler. "It will be necessary for me to examine
  them exhaustively and systematically and make a very careful pr&eacute;cis of their
  contents, with an analysis of those contents from an evidential point of
  view. I shall have to do that before I can give any opinion on the merits of
  the case, and certainly before I suggest taking any active measures. You
  realize that those investigations will take some time?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Pippet; "and you will not find us impatient. We
  don't want to urge you to act precipitately."</p>

  <p>"Not precipitately," agreed Miss Pippet. "Still, you understand that we
  don't want too much of the law's delay."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler understood that perfectly; and, to tell the whole truth,
  looked with much more favour on the lady's hardly-veiled impatience than on
  her brother's philosophic calm.</p>

  <p>"There will be no delay at all," he replied, "but merely a most necessary
  period of preparation. I need not point out to you, Madam," he continued
  after a moment's pause, "that we must not enter the lists unready. We must
  mature our plans in advance, so that when we take the field&mdash;if we
  decide to do so&mdash;it will be with our weapons sharpened and our armour
  bright."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Miss Pippet. "We must be ready before we start. I
  realize that; only I hope it won't take too long to get ready."</p>

  <p>"That," replied Mr. Gimbler, "we shall be better able to judge when we
  have made a preliminary inspection of the documentary material; but I can
  assure you that no time will be wasted."</p>

  <p>Here he paused to clear his throat and adjust his eyeglasses. Then he
  proceeded: "There is just one other little matter that I should like to be
  clear on. You realize that an action at law is apt to be a somewhat expensive
  affair. Of course, in the present case, there is a considerable set-off. If
  you are successful, the mere material gain in valuable property, to say
  nothing of the title and the great social advantages, will be enough to make
  the law costs appear a negligible trifle. Still, I must warn you that the
  outlay will be very considerable. There will be court fees, fees to counsel,
  costs of the necessary investigations, and, of course, my own charges, which
  I shall keep as low as possible. Now, the question is, are you prepared to
  embark on this undoubtedly costly enterprise?"</p>

  <p>He asked the question in a tone as impassive and judicial as he could
  manage, but he awaited the answer with an anxiety that was difficult to
  conceal. It was Miss Pippet who instantly dispelled that anxiety.</p>

  <p>"We understand all about that," said she. "We never supposed that titles
  and estates were to be picked up for the asking. You can take it that we
  shall not complain of any expense in reason. But perhaps you were thinking of
  our capacity to bear a heavy expense? If you were, I may tell you that my own
  means would be amply sufficient to meet any likely costs, even without my
  brother's support."</p>

  <p>"That is so," Mr. Pippet confirmed. "But, as I am the actual claimant, the
  costs will naturally fall on me. Could you give us any idea of our probable
  liabilities?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler reflected rapidly. He didn't wish to frighten his quarry, but
  he did very much want to take soundings of the depth of their purse.
  Eventually, he took his courage in both hands and made the trial cast.</p>

  <p>"It is mere guess work," said he, "until we know how much there may be to
  do. Supposing&mdash;to take an outside figure&mdash;the costs should mount to
  ten thousand pounds. Of course, they won't. But I mention that sum as a sort
  of basis to reckon from. How would that affect you?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pippet, "it sounds a lot of money, but it wouldn't break
  either of us. Only we look to you to see that the gamble is worth while
  before we drop too much on it."</p>

  <p>"You may be quite confident," Gimbler replied in a voice husky with
  suppressed joy, "that I shall not allow you to embark on any proceedings
  until I have ascertained beyond a doubt that you have at least a reasonable
  chance of success. And that," he continued, rising as his visitors rose to
  depart, "is all that is humanly possible."</p>

  <p>He stuck his glasses on his nose to shake hands and to watch Mr. Pippet as
  he detached the key of the deed box from his bunch. Then he opened the door
  and escorted his visitors through an atmosphere of fried onions to the street
  door, where he stood watching them reflectively as they descended the steps
  and made their way along the flagged path to the gate.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Gimbler closed the street door, that of the waiting-room opened
  softly, disclosing the figure of no less a person than Mr. Buffham. And,
  naturally, the figure included the countenance; which was wreathed in smiles.
  Looking cautiously towards the kitchen stairs, Mr. Buffham murmured:</p>

  <p>"Did I exaggerate, my little Gimblet? I think not. Methought I heard a
  whisper of ten thousand pounds. An outside estimate, my dear sir; in fact, a
  wild overestimate. Hey? What O!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler did not reply. He only smiled. And when Mr. Gimbler
  smiled&mdash;as we have mentioned&mdash;his eyes tended to disappear. They
  did on this occasion. Especially the left one.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; MR. PIPPET GIVES EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">AMERICAN visitors to London often attain to a quite
  remarkable familiarity with many of its features. But their accomplishments
  in this respect do not usually extend to an acquaintance with its intimate
  geography. The reason is simple enough. He who would know London, or any
  other great city, in the complete and intimate fashion characteristic of the
  genuine Town Sparrow, must habituate himself to the use of that old-fashioned
  conveyance known as "shanks's mare." For the humblest of creatures has some
  distinctive excellence; even the mere pedestrian, despised of the proud
  motorist (who classes him with the errant rabbit or the crawling pismire) and
  ignored by the law, has at least one virtue: he knows his London.</p>

  <p>Now, the American visitor is not usually a pedestrian. As his time appears
  to him more valuable than his money, he tends to cut the Gordian knot of
  geographical difficulties by hailing a taxi; whereby he makes a swift passage
  at the sacrifice of everything between his starting-point and his
  destination.</p>

  <p>This is what Mr. Pippet did on the afternoon of the day of his conference
  with Mr. Gimbler. The hailing was done by the hotel porter, and when the taxi
  was announced, Mr. Pippet came forth from the hall and delivered to the
  driver an address in the neighbourhood of Great Saint Helen's, wherever that
  might be, and held open the cab door to admit the young lady who had followed
  him out; who thereupon slithered in with the agility born of youthful
  flexibility, extensive practice and no clothing to speak of.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure, Jenny," said Mr. Pippet, as he took his seat and pulled
  the door to, "that your aunt was not right. This is likely to be a rather
  gruesome business, and the place doesn't seem a very suitable one for young
  ladies."</p>

  <p>Miss Jenny smiled a superior smile as she fished a gold cigarette case out
  of her hand-bag and proceeded to select a cigarette. "That's all bunk, you
  know, Dad," said she. "Auntie was just bursting to come herself, but she
  thought she had to set me an example of self-restraint. As if I wanted her
  examples. I am out to see all that there is to see. Isn't that what we came
  to Europe for?"</p>

  <p>"I thought we came to settle this peerage business," replied Mr.
  Pippet.</p>

  <p>"That's part of the entertainment," she admitted, "but we may as well take
  anything else that happens to be going. And here we have struck a first-class
  mystery. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Do you think it will be on
  view?" she added, holding out the cigarette case.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet humbly picked out a cigarette and looked at her inquiringly.
  "Do you mean the head?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's what I want to see. You've seen it, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about the ways of inquests in England," he replied,
  "but I don't fancy that the remains are shown to anyone but the jury."</p>

  <p>"That's real mean of them," she said. "I was hoping that it would be on
  view, or that they would bring it in&mdash;on a charger, like John the
  Baptist's."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet smiled as he lit his cigarette. "The circumstances are not
  quite the same, my dear," said he; "but, as I am only a witness, you'll see
  as much as I shall, though, as you say, I have actually seen the thing, or,
  at least, a part of it; and I have no wish to see any more."</p>

  <p>"Still," persisted Jenny, "you can say that you have really and truly seen
  it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet admitted that he enjoyed this inestimable privilege for what it
  might be worth, and the conversation dropped for the moment. Miss Jenny
  leaned back reposefully in her corner, taking occasional "pulls" at the
  cigarette in its dainty amber holder, while her father regarded her with a
  mixture of parental pride, affection and quiet amusement. And it has to be
  admitted that Mr. Pippet's sentiments with regard to his daughter were by no
  means unjustified. Miss Jenifer Pippet&mdash;to give her her full and
  unabridged style and title&mdash;was a girl of whom any father might have
  been proud. If&mdash;as Mr. Gimbler had very properly decided&mdash;the
  majestic Arminella "looked the part" of an earl's sister (which is not
  invariably the case with the genuine possessors of that title), Mistress
  Jenifer would have sustained the character of the earl's daughter with credit
  even on the stage, where the demands are a good deal more exacting than in
  real life. In the typically "patrician" style of features, with the fine
  Roman nose and the level brows and firm chin, she resembled her redoubtable
  aunt; but she had the advantage of that lady in the matter of stature, being,
  like her father, well above the average height. And here it may be noted
  that, if the daughter reflected credit on the father, the latter was well
  able to hold his position on his own merits. Christopher J. Pippet was fully
  worthy of his distinguished womenkind; a fine, upstanding gentleman with an
  undeniable "presence."</p>

  <p>It was probably the possession of these personal advantages that made the
  way smooth for the two strangers on their arrival at the premises in which
  the inquest was to be held. At any rate, as soon as Mr. Pippet had made known
  his connexion with the case, the officiating police officer conducted them to
  a place in the front row and provided them each with a chair directly facing
  the table and nearly opposite the coroner's seat. At the moment, this and the
  jurymen's seats were empty and the large room was filled with the hum of
  conversation. For the sensational nature of the case had attracted a number
  of spectators greatly in excess of that usually found at an inquest; so much
  so that the accommodation was somewhat strained, and our two visitors had
  reason to congratulate themselves on their privileged position.</p>

  <p>A few minutes after their arrival, a general stir among the audience and
  an increase in the murmur of voices seemed to indicate that something was
  happening. Then the nature of that something became apparent as the jurymen
  filed into their places and the coroner took his place at the head of the
  table. There was a brief interval as the jurymen settled into their places
  and the coroner arranged some papers before him and inspected his fountain
  pen. Then he looked up; and as the hum of conversation died away and silence
  settled down on the room, he began his opening address.</p>

  <p>"The circumstances, gentlemen," said he, "which form the subject of this
  inquiry are very unusual. Ordinarily the occasion of a coroner's inquest is
  the discovery of the dead body of some person, known or unknown, or the death
  of some person from causes which have not been ascertained or certified, but
  whose body is available for examination. In the present case, while there is
  indisputable evidence of the death of some person, and certain evidence which
  may enable us to form some opinion as to the probable cause of death, the
  complete body is not available for expert examination. All that has been
  discovered, up to the present, is the head; whereas it is probable that the
  physical evidence as to the exact cause of death is to be found in the
  missing portion of the remains. I need not to occupy your time with any
  account of the circumstances, all of which will transpire in the evidence.
  All that I need say now is that the efforts of the police to discover the
  identity of deceased have so far proved fruitless. We are accordingly dealing
  with an entirely unknown individual. The first witness whom I shall call is
  Thomas Crump."</p>

  <p>At the sound of his name, Mr. Crump made his way to the table, piloted
  thither by the coroner's officer, and took his stand, under the latter's
  direction, near to the coroner's chair. Having been sworn, he stated that he
  was an attendant in the cloak room at Fenchurch Street Station.</p>

  <p>"Were you on duty in the evening of Saturday the 19th of August?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I was."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember receiving a certain wooden case on that evening? A case
  which there has been some question about since?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was brought in about nine twenty; just after the nine fifteen
  from Shoeburyness had come in."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything on the case to show where it had come from?"</p>

  <p>"No, there were no labels on it excepting one with what I took to be the
  owner's name and address. I supposed that it had come by the Shoeburyness
  train, but that was only a guess. If it did, it couldn't have travelled in
  the luggage van. The guard wouldn't have had it without a label."</p>

  <p>"Who brought the case to the cloak room?"</p>

  <p>"It was brought in by the gentleman who I took to be the owner. And a rare
  job he must have had with it, for it weighed close on a hundredweight, as
  near as I could tell. He staggered in with it, carrying it by a cord that was
  tied round it."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us any description of this man?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice him very particularly, but I remember that he was rather
  tall and had a long, thin face and a big, sharp nose. He looked a bit on the
  thin side, but he must have been pretty strong to judge by the way he handled
  that case."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice how he was dressed?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I remember, he had on a dark suit&mdash;I fancy it was blue
  serge but I wouldn't be sure; but I remember that he was wearing a soft felt
  hat."</p>

  <p>"Had he any moustache or was he clean shaved?"</p>

  <p>"He had a moustache and a smallish beard, cut to a point; what they call a
  Torpedo beard. His beard and his hair were both dark."</p>

  <p>"About what age would you say he was?"</p>

  <p>"He might have been about forty or perhaps a trifle more."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the case, can you give us any description of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It was a wooden case, about fifteen inches square and perhaps eighteen
  inches high. It was made of plain deal strongly put together and strengthened
  at the corners with iron straps. The top was fitted with hinges and held down
  by eight screws. The wood was a good deal stained and rubbed, as if it had
  seen a fair amount of use. It had a label fastened on with tacks; just a
  plain card with the owner's name on it&mdash;at least, somebody's
  name&mdash;and an address. The name was Dobson, but I wouldn't swear to the
  address."</p>

  <p>"Well," the coroner pursued, "you took in the case. What happened
  next?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing on that night. I gave the man his ticket and he took it and said
  he would probably call for the case on Monday. Then he said 'Good night' and
  went off."</p>

  <p>"When did you see him again?"</p>

  <p>"That was on Monday evening, about seven o'clock. It happened to be a
  slack time and I had more time to attend to him. He came and handed me his
  ticket and asked for the case. He pointed out one which he thought was his,
  so I went over to it and looked at the label that had been stuck on it, but
  it was the wrong number. However, he said that his name was on the
  case&mdash;name of Dobson&mdash;and I saw that there was a private label with
  that name on it, so I said he had better have a look at it and see if it
  really was his case. So he came into the cloak room and examined the case.
  And then he got into a rare state of excitement. He said it was certainly his
  name that was on the case and his address, but the label was not the same one
  that he wrote. But still he thought that the case was his case.</p>

  <p>"Then I asked him if the contents of his case were of any particular
  value, and he said 'yes.' They were worth several thousand pounds. Now, when
  he said that, I began to suspect that there was something wrong, so I
  suggested that we had better open the case and see if his property was
  inside.</p>

  <p>"He jumped at the offer, so I got a screw-driver, and we took out the
  screws and lifted the lid. And when we lifted it, the first thing that we saw
  was the top of a man's head, packed in with a lot of rags. When he saw it, he
  seemed to be struck all of a heap. Then he slammed down the lid and asked me
  where he could find a policeman. I told him that he would find one outside
  the station, and off he went as hard as he could go."</p>

  <p>Here the coroner held up a restraining hand as he scribbled furiously to
  keep up with the witness. When he had finished the paragraph, he looked up
  and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; he went out to look for a policeman. What happened next?"</p>

  <p>"While we had been looking at the case, there were two gentlemen who had
  come to collect their luggage and who heard what was going on. When Mr.
  Dobson&mdash;if that was his name&mdash;went out, they came over to have a
  look at the case; and we all waited for Mr. Dobson to come back. But he
  didn't come back. So, after a time, one of the gentlemen went out and
  presently came back with a constable. I showed the constable what was in the
  case, and he then took possession of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "that is all quite clear, so far. Do you think
  you would recognize this man, Dobson, if you were to see him again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Crump. "I feel pretty sure I should. He was the sort of man
  that you would remember. And I did look at him pretty hard."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "I hope that you will have an opportunity of
  identifying him. Does any gentleman wish to ask the witness any questions? I
  think he has told us all that he has to tell. The other witnesses will be
  able to fill in the details. No questions? Then we will pass on to the next
  witness. William Harris."</p>

  <p>Mr. Harris came forward with rather more diffidence than had been shown by
  his colleague, which might have been due to his age&mdash;he was little more
  than a youth&mdash;or to the story that he had to tell. But, ill at ease as
  he obviously was, he gave his evidence in a quite clear and straightforward
  fashion. When he had been sworn and given the usual particulars, he stood,
  regarding the coroner with a look of consternation, as he waited for the
  dread interrogation.</p>

  <p>"You say," the coroner began impassively, "that you are an attendant in
  the cloak room at Fenchurch Street Station. How long have you been employed
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite three munce," the witness faltered.</p>

  <p>"So you have not had much experience, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not very much."</p>

  <p>"Were you on duty on Sunday, the twentieth of August?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who was on duty with you?"</p>

  <p>"No one, sir. It was Mr. Crump's Sunday off, and, being a slack day, I
  took the duty by myself."</p>

  <p>"On that day, you received a certain wooden case. Do you remember the
  circumstances connected with it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The case was brought in about half-past ten in the morning. The
  man who brought it said that he would be calling for it about tea-time."</p>

  <p>"Did this man bring the case himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He carried it by a thick cord that was tied round it, and he
  brought it right in and put it down not far from another case of the same
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Did you examine these cases or read the labels that were on them?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I can't say that I did. I just stuck the ticket on the case that
  the man had brought in, but I didn't examine it. But I remember that there
  was another case near it that looked like the same sort of case."</p>

  <p>"Did this man come back for the case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He came about four o'clock with another man who looked like a
  taxi-driver. He handed me the ticket and I went with the two men and found
  the case. Then the man who had brought it told the other man to take it out
  and stow it in the taxi. Then he pulled a time-table out of his pocket and
  asked me to look over it with him and see how the trains ran to Loughton and
  Epping. So we spread out the time-table on the luggage-counter and went
  through the list of Sunday trains; and while we were looking at it, the
  taxi-man took up the case and went out of the station. When we had finished
  with the time-table and the man had taken one or two notes of the trains, he
  put the time-table back in his pocket, thanked me for helping him and went
  away."</p>

  <p>"Did it never occur to you to see whether he had taken the right
  case?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. My back was towards the taxi-man when he picked the case up. I
  saw him carrying it out towards the entrance, but it looked just like the
  right case, and it never occurred to me that he might have taken the wrong
  one. And the one that was left looked like the right one and it was in the
  right place."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "it was very natural. Evidently, the exchange had
  been carefully planned in advance, and very skilfully planned, too. Now, with
  regard to these two cases: were you able to form any opinion as to the weight
  of either or both of them?"</p>

  <p>"I never felt either of them," the witness replied; "but the one that the
  man brought in seemed rather heavy, by the way that he carried it. He had
  hold of it by the cord that was tied round it. The other one seemed a bit
  heavy, too. But when I saw the taxi-man going out with it, he had got it on
  his shoulder and he didn't seem to have any difficulty with it."</p>

  <p>"And, with regard to these two men. Can you give us any description of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly saw the taxi-man, and I don't remember what he was like at all,
  excepting that he was a big, strong-looking man. The other man was rather
  small, but he looked pretty strong-built, too. When we were looking at the
  time-tables, I noticed two things about him. One was that he seemed to have a
  couple of gold teeth."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the coroner, "presumably gold-filled teeth. Do you remember
  which teeth they were?"</p>

  <p>"They were the two middle front teeth at the top. He showed them a good
  deal when he talked."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and what was the other thing that you noticed?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed, when he put his hand on the time-table, that his fingers were
  stained all browny yellow, as if he was always smoking cigarettes; and his
  hand was shaking, even when it was laying on the paper. I didn't notice
  anything else."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us how he was dressed?"</p>

  <p>"He had on an ordinary tweed suit; rather a shabby suit it was. And he was
  wearing a cloth cap."</p>

  <p>"Had he any moustache or beard?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; he was clean shaved&mdash;or, at least, not very clean, because
  he had about a couple of days' growth, and as he was a dark man, it showed
  pretty plainly."</p>

  <p>"How did he strike you as to his station in life? Should you describe him
  as a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I should not," the witness replied with considerable emphasis.
  "He struck me as quite a common sort of man, and I got the idea that he might
  have been a seaman or some kind of waterside character. We see a good many of
  that sort on our line, so we get to recognize them."</p>

  <p>"What sort of men are you referring to?" the coroner asked with evident
  interest, "and where do they come from?"</p>

  <p>"I mean sailors of all kinds from the London and the India Docks, and
  fishermen and longshoremen from Leigh and Benfleet and Southend and the
  sea-side places up that way."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "this is quite interesting and may be important.
  Fenchurch Street has always been a sailors' station. However, that is for the
  police rather than for us. I think that is all that we want to ask this
  witness, unless any of the gentlemen of the jury wish to put any
  questions."</p>

  <p>He glanced interrogatively at the jury, but none of them expressed any
  curiosity. Accordingly, the witness was allowed to retire; which he did with
  undisguised relief.</p>

  <p>The next witness was the constable who had been called in to take charge
  of the case, and, as his evidence amounted to little more than a statement of
  that fact, he was soon disposed of and dismissed. Then the coroner pronounced
  the name of Geoffrey Buffham, and that gentleman rose from the extreme corner
  of the court and worked his way to the table, casting a leer of recognition
  on Mr. Pippet as he passed. His evidence, also, was chiefly formal; but, when
  he had finished his account of his search for the constable, the coroner
  turned to the subject of identification.</p>

  <p>"You saw the man who had come to claim the case. Can you add any
  particulars to those given by the attendant?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't tell you very much about him. The light was not very
  good, and, of course, until he had gone, there was nothing to make one take
  any special notice of him. And then it was too late. All I can say is that he
  was a tallish man with a rather dark beard and a prominent nose."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote this down without comment, and then, apparently judging
  Mr. Buffham to be worth no more powder and shot, glanced at the jury for a
  moment and dismissed him. Then he pronounced the name of Christopher J.
  Pippet, and the owner of that name rose and stepped over to the place that
  had been occupied by the other witnesses. The coroner looked up at the tall,
  dignified figure, apparently contrasting it with its rather scrubby, raffish
  predecessor; and when the preliminaries had been disposed of, he asked
  apologetically:</p>

  <p>"It is of no particular importance, but would you tell us what the 'J' in
  your name stands for? It is usual to give the full name."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet smiled. "As I have just been sworn," said he, "I have got to be
  careful in my statements. My impression is that the 'J' stands for Josiah,
  but that is only an opinion. I have always been accustomed to use the initial
  only."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "we will accept that as your recognized personal
  designation. There is no need to be pedantic. Now, Mr. Pippet, I don't think
  we need trouble you to go into details concerning the discovery of this case,
  but it would be useful if you could give us some further description of the
  man who came to claim the property. The descriptions which have been given
  are very sketchy and indefinite; can you amplify them in any way?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet reflected. "I took a pretty careful look at him," said he, "and
  I have a fairly clear mental picture of the man."</p>

  <p>"You say you took a pretty careful look at him," said the coroner. "What
  made you look at him carefully?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Mr. Pippet replied, "the circumstances were rather
  remarkable. From his conversation with the attendant it was clear that
  something quite irregular had been happening; and when he mentioned the value
  of the case, it began to look like a serious crime. Then when he rushed out
  pell mell in search of a policeman, that struck me as a very strange thing to
  do. What was the hurry about? His own case was gone, and the one that was
  there wasn't going to run away. But I gathered that there was something in it
  that oughtn't to have been there. So when he came running out full pelt, I
  suspected that the cause of the hurry was behind him, not in front, and,
  naturally, my attention was aroused."</p>

  <p>"You suspected that he might be making off?"</p>

  <p>"It seemed a possibility. Anyway, I have never seen a man look more
  thoroughly scared."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "as you seem to have taken more notice of him
  than anyone else, perhaps you can give us a rather more complete description
  of him. Do you think you would recognize him if you should see him
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I feel pretty sure that I should," was the reply; "but that is not the
  same as enabling other people to recognize him. I should describe him as a
  tall man, about five feet eleven, lean but muscular and broad across the
  shoulders. He had a long, thin face and a long, thin nose, curved on the
  bridge and pointed at the end. His hair and beard were nearly black, but his
  skin and eyes didn't seem to match them very well, for his skin was
  distinctly fair and his eyes were a pale blue. I got the distinct impression
  that his hair and beard were dyed."</p>

  <p>"Was that merely an impression or had you any definite grounds for the
  suspicion?"</p>

  <p>"At first, it was just an impression. But as he was running out he got
  between me and the electric light for a moment, and the light shone through
  his beard. Then I caught a glint of that peculiar red that you see in hair
  that is dyed black when the light shines through it, and that you never see
  in natural hair; a red with a perceptible tinge of purple in it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "it is very characteristic. But do you feel quite
  sure that you actually saw this colour? It is a very important point."</p>

  <p>"I feel convinced in my own mind," replied Mr. Pippet, "but, of course, I
  might have been mistaken. I can only say that, to the best of my belief, the
  hair showed that peculiar colour."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "that is about as much as anyone could say,
  under the circumstances. Did you notice anything of interest in regard to the
  clothing? You heard Mr. Crump's evidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and I don't think I can add much to it. The man was wearing a
  well-used dark blue serge suit, a blue cotton shirt with a collar to match, a
  soft felt hat and dark brown shoes. He had a wrist watch, but he seemed to
  have a pocket watch as well Anyway, he had what looked like a watch guard,
  made, apparently, of plaited twine."</p>

  <p>"Is that all you can tell us about him, or is there anything else that you
  are able to recall?"</p>

  <p>"I think I have told you all that I noticed. There wasn't much opportunity
  to examine him closely."</p>

  <p>"No, there was not," the coroner agreed. "I can only compliment you on the
  excellent use that you made of your eyes in the short time that was
  available. And, if that is all that you have to tell us, I think that we need
  not trouble you any further."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the foreman of the jury, and as that gentleman bowed to
  indicate that he was satisfied, Mr. Pippet was allowed to return to his seat,
  where he received the whispered congratulations of his daughter.</p>

  <p>"That," said the coroner, addressing the jury, "concludes the evidence
  relating to the discovery of the remains. We shall now proceed to the
  evidence afforded by the remains themselves; and we will begin with that of
  the medical officer to whom the head was handed for expert examination. Dr.
  Humphrey Smith."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE FINDING OF THE JURY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE new witness was a man of about thirty with a clean
  shaved, studious face, garnished with a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles, and a
  somewhat diffident, uneasy manner. Having advanced to the table and taken his
  seat on the chair which had been placed for him close to that occupied by the
  coroner, he produced from his pocket a note book which he held unopened on
  his knee throughout the proceedings. In reply to the preliminary questions,
  he stated that his name was Humphrey Smith, that he was a bachelor of
  medicine, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the
  Royal College of Physicians.</p>

  <p>"You are the Police Medical Officer of this district, I believe," the
  coroner suggested.</p>

  <p>"Temporarily, I hold that post," was the reply, "during the absence on
  sick leave of the regular medical officer."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said the coroner; "for the purposes of this inquiry, you are
  the Police Medical Officer."</p>

  <p>The witness admitted that this was so, and the coroner proceeded: "You
  have had submitted to you for examination a case containing a human head.
  Will you give us an account of your examination and the conclusions at which
  you arrived?"</p>

  <p>The witness reflected a few moments and then began his statement.</p>

  <p>"At ten fifteen on the morning of the twenty-second of August, Inspector
  Budge called on me and asked me to come round to the police station to
  examine the contents of a case, in which he said were certain human remains.
  I went with him and was shown a wooden case, strengthened by iron straps. It
  had a hinged lid which was further secured by eight screws, which, however,
  had been extracted. On raising the lid, I saw what looked like the top of a
  man's head, surrounded by rags and articles of clothing which had been packed
  tightly round it. With the Inspector's assistance I removed the packing
  material until it was possible to lift out the head, which I then took to a
  table by the window where I was able to make a thorough examination.</p>

  <p>"The head appeared to be that of a man, although there was hardly any
  visible beard or moustache and no signs of his having been shaved."</p>

  <p>"You say that the head <i>appeared</i> to be that of a man. Do you feel
  confident that deceased <i>was</i> a man, or do you think that the head may
  possibly be that of a woman?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is no doubt that deceased was a man. The general appearance
  was masculine, and the hair was quite short and arranged like a man's
  hair."</p>

  <p>"That," remarked the coroner, "is not a very safe criterion in these days.
  I have seen a good many women who would have passed well enough for men
  excepting for their clothes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," the witness admitted, "but I had the present fashion
  in mind when I formed my opinion; and, although there was extremely little
  hair on the face, there was more than one usually finds on the face of a
  woman&mdash;a young woman, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Then, are we to understand that this head was that of a young
  person?"</p>

  <p>"The exact age was rather difficult to determine, but I should say that
  deceased was not much, if any, over thirty."</p>

  <p>"What made it difficult to estimate the age of deceased?"</p>

  <p>"There were two circumstances that made it difficult to judge the age. One
  was the physical condition of the head, and the other was the extraordinary
  facial character of this person."</p>

  <p>"By the physical condition, do you mean that it had undergone considerable
  putrefactive changes?"</p>

  <p>"No, not at all. It was not in the least decomposed. It had been
  thoroughly embalmed, or, at least, treated with preservative
  substances&mdash;principally formalin, I think. There was quite a distinct
  odour of formalin vapour."</p>

  <p>"Then it would appear that it was in quite a good state of preservation,
  which ought to have helped rather than hindered your examination."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the effect of the formalin was to produce a certain amount of
  shrinkage of the tissues, which naturally resulted in some distortion of the
  features. But it was not easy to be sure how much of the distortion was due
  to the formalin and how much to the natural deformity."</p>

  <p>"Was the shrinkage in any way due to drying of the tissues?"</p>

  <p>"No. The tissues were not in the least dry. It appeared to me that the
  formalin had been mixed with glycerine; and, as glycerine does not evaporate,
  the head has remained perfectly moist, but without any tendency to
  decompose."</p>

  <p>"How long do you consider that deceased has been dead?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied the doctor, "is a question upon which I could form no
  opinion whatever. The head is so perfectly preserved that it will last in its
  present condition for an almost indefinite time; and, of course, what applies
  to the future applies equally to the past. One can estimate the time that has
  elapsed since death only by the changes that have occurred in the interval.
  But, if there are no changes, there is nothing on which to form an
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that deceased might have been dead for a year?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, or even longer than that. A year ago the head would have looked
  exactly as it looks now, and as it will look a year hence. The preservatives
  have rendered it practically unchangeable."</p>

  <p>"That is very remarkable," said the coroner, "and it introduces a
  formidable difficulty into this inquiry. For we have to discover, if we can,
  how, when and where this person met with his death. But it would seem that
  the 'when' is undiscoverable. You could give no limit to the time that has
  elapsed since death took place?"</p>

  <p>"No. I could make no suggestion as to the time."</p>

  <p>The coroner wrote this down and looked at what he had written with an air
  of profound dissatisfaction. Then he turned to the witness and opened a new
  subject.</p>

  <p>"You spoke just now of the remarkable facial peculiarities of deceased.
  Can you describe those peculiarities?"</p>

  <p>"I will try. Deceased had a most extraordinary and perfectly hideous face.
  The peculiar appearance was due principally to the overgrown condition of the
  lower part, especially the lower jaw. In shape, the face was like an egg with
  the small end upwards; and the jaw was not only enormously broad, but the
  chin stuck out beyond the upper lip and the lower teeth were spread out and
  projected considerably in front of the upper ones. Then the nose was thick
  and coarse and the ears stood out from the head; but they were not like
  ordinary outstanding ears, which tend to be thin and membranous. They were
  thick and lumpy and decidedly misshapen. Altogether, the appearance of the
  face was quite abnormal."</p>

  <p>"Should you regard this abnormality as a deformity, or do you think it was
  connected with deceased's state of health?"</p>

  <p>"I should hardly like to give an opinion without seeing the rest of the
  body. There is no doubt about the deformity; but whether it was congenital or
  due to disease, I should not like to say: There are several rather rare
  diseases which tend to produce malformations of different parts of the
  body."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "medical details of that kind are a little
  outside the scope of this inquiry. The fact which interests us is that
  deceased was a very unusual-looking person, so that there ought not to be
  much difficulty in identifying him. To come to another question; from your
  examination of this head, should you say that there is any evidence of
  special skill or knowledge in the way in which the head has been separated
  from the trunk?"</p>

  <p>"I think that there is a suggestion of some skill and knowledge. Not
  necessarily very much. But the separation was effected in accordance with the
  anatomical relations, not in the way in which it would have been done by an
  entirely ignorant and unskilful person. The head had been separated from the
  spinal column&mdash;that is, from the top of the backbone&mdash;by cutting
  through the ligaments that fasten the backbone to the skull; whereas a quite
  ignorant person would almost certainly have cut through the neck and through
  the joint between two of the neck vertebrae."</p>

  <p>"You think that it would not require much skill to take the head off in
  the manner in which it was done?"</p>

  <p>"No; it would be quite easy if one knew where to make the cut. But most
  people do not."</p>

  <p>"You think, then, that the person who cut off this head must have had some
  anatomical knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but a very little knowledge of anatomy would suffice."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that such knowledge as a butcher possesses would be
  sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. A butcher doesn't know much anatomy, but he knows where to
  find the joints."</p>

  <p>"And now, to take another question; can you give us any information as to
  the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the very definite reply. "I examined the head most carefully
  with this question in view, but I could find no trace of any wound, bruise,
  or mark of violence, or even of rough treatment. There was no clue whatever
  to the cause or mode of death."</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause while the coroner glanced through his notes. Then,
  looking up at the jury, he said:</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, you have heard what the doctor has to tell us. It
  doesn't get us on very far, but, of course, that is not the doctor's fault.
  He can't make evidence. Would any of you like to ask him any further
  questions? If not, I think we need not occupy any more of his time."</p>

  <p>Once more he paused with his eyes on the jury; then, as no one made any
  sign, he thanked the witness and gave him his dismissal.</p>

  <p>The next witness was a smart-looking uniformed inspector of the City
  Police who stepped up to his post with the brisk, confident air of one
  familiar with the procedure. He stated that his name was William Budge, and,
  having rattled through the preliminaries, gave a precise and business-like
  account of the circumstances in which he made the acquaintance of the
  "remains" in the cloak room. From this he proceeded to the examination of the
  case in collaboration with the medical officer. His description of the case
  tallied with that given by Mr. Crump, but he was able to supply a few further
  details.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crump referred in his evidence," said the coroner, "to a private
  label on this case. You examined that, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was a piece of card&mdash;half of a stationer's
  postcard&mdash;fastened to the lid of the case with four tacks. It had a name
  and address written on it in plain block letters with a rather fine pen. The
  name was J. Dobson and the address was 401 Argyle Square, King's Cross,
  London."</p>

  <p>"Four hundred and one!" exclaimed the coroner.</p>

  <p>The witness smiled. "Yes, sir. Of course, there's no such number, but I
  went there to make sure."</p>

  <p>"You did not extract any other information from the label?"</p>

  <p>"I did not make a particular examination of it. I took it off carefully
  with the proper precautions and handed it to the superintendent."</p>

  <p>"You did not test it for finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. That would not be in my province."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" said the coroner, "and it is not really in ours." He paused for
  a few moments and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea, Inspector, where this case might have come from, or
  what its original contents might have been?"</p>

  <p>"I should say," was the reply, "that it originally contained some kind of
  provisions and that it formed part of a ship's stores. It is very usual for
  firms who supply provisions to ships to send them out in cases of this kind.
  The lids are screwed down for security in transit, but furnished with hinges
  for convenience when they are in use on board. There was no mark on the wood
  to indicate where the case came from. The issuer's name and address was
  probably on a label which has been taken off."</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything that seemed to confirm your surmise that this case
  had formed part of a ship's stores?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When the doctor had taken the head out, I took out the clothes and
  rags that had been used for packing and went over them carefully. Most of
  them seemed to be connected with a vessel of some sort. I made out a list,
  which I have with me."</p>

  <p>He produced an official-looking note book, and, at the coroner's request,
  read out the list of items.</p>

  <p>"At the top, immediately surrounding the head, was a very old, ragged blue
  jersey, such as fishermen wear. There was no mark of any kind on it, but
  there were some ends of thread that looked as if a linen tab had been cut
  off. Next, there was a pair of brown canvas trousers, a good deal worn and
  without any marks or any name on the buttons, and an old brown canvas jumper.
  Then there were several worn-out cotton swabs such as they use on board ship,
  three longish ends of inch-and-a-half manilla rope, and, at the bottom of the
  case, a ragged oil-skin coat. So the whole contents looked like the
  throw-outs collected from some ship's fo'c'sle, or from the cabin of a barge
  or some other small craft."</p>

  <p>"Do you associate these cast-off things with any particular kind of
  vessel?"</p>

  <p>"As far as the things themselves are concerned, I do not. But the case
  rather suggests a deep-water craft. A barge or a coaster can pick up her
  provisions at the various ports of call, and hardly needs the quantity of
  stores that this case suggests."</p>

  <p>"And what about the other case&mdash;the case that was stolen? Do you
  connect it with the one that contained the head?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector reflected. "There is not much information available at
  present," said he, "and what there is you have had in Crump's evidence. It
  appears that the two cases were exactly alike; and, if that is so, they might
  have come from the same source. Evidently, the man who brought in the case
  with the head in it knew all about the other case, and what was in it."</p>

  <p>"Which, I take it, is more than you do?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled and admitted that the unknown man had the advantage
  of the police at present; and, with that admission his evidence came to an
  end and he retired to his seat. There followed a pause, during which the
  coroner once more looked over his notes and the jury exchanged remarks in an
  undertone. At length, when he had run his eye over the depositions, the
  coroner leaned back in his chair, and, taking a general survey of the jury,
  began his summing-up.</p>

  <p>"This inquiry, gentlemen," he began, "is a very remarkable one, and as
  unsatisfactory as it is unusual in character. It is unsatisfactory in several
  respects. We are inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the death of a
  deceased person. But we are not in possession of the body of that person but
  of only a part of it; and that part gives us no information on either of the
  three headings of our inquiry&mdash;the time, the place and the manner. We
  are seeking to discover:&mdash;first, When this person died; second, In what
  place he died; and, third, In what manner and by what means he came by his
  death. But, owing to the incomplete nature of the remains, the strange
  circumstances in which they were discovered, and the physical condition of
  the remains themselves, we can answer none of these questions. We do not even
  know who the deceased is. All that we can do is to consider the whole body of
  facts which are known to us and draw what reasonable conclusions we can from
  them.</p>

  <p>"Let us begin by taking a glance at the succession of events in the order
  of their occurrence. First, on the Saturday night, comes a man with a heavy
  case which, according to his subsequent admission, contains property of great
  value. He leaves this case in the cloak room for the week-end. Then, on the
  Sunday, comes another man with another case which appears to be identically
  similar to the first. He very adroitly manages to exchange this case for the
  one containing the valuable property. Then, on the Monday, comes the first
  man to claim his property. He sees that some substitution appears to have
  occurred, and, in order to make sure, opens the case. Then he discovers the
  head of the deceased and is, naturally enough, horrified. Instantly, he
  rushes out of the station, ostensibly in search of a policeman, but actually,
  to make his escape, as becomes evident when he does not return. That is the
  series of events which are known to us, and which form, in effect, the whole
  sum of our knowledge. Let us see what conclusions we can draw from them.</p>

  <p>"The first question that we ask ourselves is:&mdash;Why did that man not
  come back? The case which had been stolen contained, according to what was
  probably a hasty, unguarded statement, property worth several thousand
  pounds. Without committing ourselves to a legal opinion, we may say that he
  could have made a claim on the railway company for the value of that
  property. Yet, at the sight of that dead man's head, he rushed out and
  disappeared. What are we to infer from that? There are several inferences
  that suggest themselves. First, although it is evident that the head in the
  case came to him as a complete surprise, it is possible that, as soon as he
  saw it, he recognized it as something with which he had a guilty association.
  That is one possibility. Then there is the question as to what was in his own
  case. It was property of great value. But whose property was it? There is in
  the behaviour of this man a strong suggestion that the valuable contents of
  that case may have been stolen property, of which he was not in a position to
  give any account. That appears to be highly probable; but it does not greatly
  concern us, excepting that it suggests a criminal element in the transaction
  as a whole&mdash;a suggestion that is strengthened by the apparent connexion
  between the two men.</p>

  <p>"When we come to the second man, the criminal element is unmistakeable. To
  say nothing of the theft which he undoubtedly committed, the fact that he was
  going about with the head of a dead man in a box, definitely puts upon him
  the responsibility for the mutilation of a human body, to say the least. The
  question of any further guilt depends on the view that is taken of that
  mutilation. And that brings us to the question as to the manner in which the
  deceased came by his death.</p>

  <p>"Now, we have to recognize that we have no direct evidence on this point.
  The doctor's careful and expert examination failed to elicit any information
  as to the cause of death; which was what might have been expected from the
  very insufficient means at his disposal. But, if we have no direct evidence
  as to the actual cause of death, we have very important indirect evidence as
  to some of the circumstances surrounding his death. We know, for instance,
  that the body had been mutilated, or at least decapitated; and we know that
  some person was in possession of the separated head&mdash;and, probably, of
  the mutilated remainder of the corpse.</p>

  <p>"But these are very material facts. What does our common sense, aided by
  experience, suggest in the case of a corpse which has been mutilated and a
  part packed in a box and planted in a railway cloak room? What is the usual
  object of dismembering a corpse and of disposing of the dismembered remains
  in this way? In all the numerous cases which have occurred from time to time,
  the object has been the same; to get rid of the body of a person who has been
  murdered, in order to cover up the fact and the circumstances of the crime.
  No other reason is imaginable. There could be no object in thus making away
  with the body of a person who had died a natural death.</p>

  <p>"That, however, is for you to consider in deciding on your verdict. The
  other known facts do not seem to be helpful. The singular and rather
  repulsive appearance of deceased does not concern us, although it may be
  important to the police. As to the curious use of a preservative, the object
  of that seems to be fairly obvious. Mutilated remains have been commonly
  discovered by the putrefactive odour which they have exhaled. If this head
  had not been preserved, it would have been impossible for it to have been
  left in the cloak room for twenty-four hours without arousing suspicion. But,
  as I have said, the fact, though curious, is not material to our inquiry. The
  material facts are those which suggest an answer to the question, How did
  deceased come by his death? Those facts are in your possession; and I shall
  now leave you to consider your verdict."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, while the hum of conversation once more pervaded the court
  room, the jury drew together and compared notes. But their conference lasted
  only a very few minutes, at the end of which the foreman signified to the
  coroner that they had agreed on their verdict.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," said the latter, "what is your decision?"</p>

  <p>"We find," was the reply, "that deceased was murdered by some person or
  persons unknown."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, as he entered the verdict at the foot of the
  depositions, "that is what common sense suggests. I don't see that you could
  have arrived at any other decision. It remains only for me to thank you for
  your attendance and the careful attention which you have given to the
  evidence, and close the proceedings."</p>

  <p>As the court rose, Mr. Buffham emerged hurriedly from the corner in which
  he had been seated and elbowed his way towards Mr. Pippet and his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he exclaimed, effusively, "let me offer my most hearty
  congratulations on the brilliant way in which you gave your evidence. Your
  powers of observation positively staggered me."</p>

  <p>The latter statement was no exaggeration. Mr. Buffham had been not only
  staggered but slightly disconcerted by the discovery of his friend's
  remarkable capacity for "keeping his weather eyelid lifted." In the peculiar
  circumstances, it was a gift that he was disposed to view with some
  disfavour; and he found himself wondering, a little uncomfortably, whether
  Mr. Pippet happened to have observed any other facts which he was not
  expected or desired to observe. But he did not allow these misgivings to
  interfere with his suave and ingratiating manner. As Mr. Pippet received his
  congratulations without obvious emotion, he bestowed on Miss Jenny a leer
  which was intended to express admiring recognition and then turned with an
  insinuating smile to her father.</p>

  <p>"This charming young lady," said he, "is, I presume, the daughter of whom
  I have heard you speak."</p>

  <p>"You have guessed right the first time," Mr. Pippet replied. "This is Mr.
  Buffham, my dear; but you know that, as you heard him give his evidence."</p>

  <p>Miss Jenny bowed, with a faint suggestion of stiffness. The ingratiating
  smile did not seem to have produced the expected effect. The "charming young
  lady" was not, in fact, at all favourably impressed by Mr. Buffham's
  personality. Nevertheless she exchanged a few observations on the incidents
  of the inquest, as the audience was clearing off, and the three moved out
  together when the way was clear. Here, however, Mr. Buffham suffered a slight
  disappointment. For when the taxi which Mr. Pippet hailed drew up at the
  curb, the hoped-for invitation was not forthcoming, and the cordial
  hand-shake and smiling farewell appeared an unsatisfactory substitute.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; THE GREAT PLATINUM ROBBERY</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNDYKE'S rather free and easy custom of receiving
  professional visitors at unconventional hours tended on certain occasions to
  result in slightly embarrassing situations. It did, for instance, on an
  evening in early October when the arrival of our old friend Mr. Brodribb, was
  followed almost immediately by that of Mr. Superintendent Miller. Both were
  ostensibly making a friendly call; but both, I felt sure, had their
  particular fish to fry. Brodribb had almost certainly come for a professional
  consultation, and Miller's informal chats invariably developed a professional
  background.</p>

  <p>I watched with amused curiosity to see what would happen. Each man would
  probably give the other a chance to retire, and the question was, which would
  be the first to abdicate? The event would probably be determined by the
  relative urgency of their respective fish frying. But the delicate balance of
  probabilities was upset by Polton, our invaluable laboratory assistant, who
  happened to be in the room when they arrived; who instantly proceeded to make
  the arrangements which immemorial custom had associated with each of our
  visitors. The two cosiest armchairs were drawn up to the fire and a small
  table placed by each. On one table appeared, as if by magic, the whisky
  decanter, siphon and cigar box which clearly appertained to Miller, and on
  the other, three port glasses.</p>

  <p>"This is your chair, sir," said Polton, shepherding the Superintendent in
  the way he should go. "The other is for Mr. Brodribb"; and with this he
  vanished, and we all knew whither he had gone.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb with slight indecision, as he subsided into his
  allotted chair and put his toes on the curb, while Thorndyke and I drew up
  our chairs, "if I shan't be in the way, I'll just sit down and warm myself
  for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>His "defeatist" tone I judged to be due to the fact that Miller, in ready
  response to my invitation, had mixed himself a stiff jorum, got a cigar
  alight and apparently settled himself comfortably for the evening. I think
  the old lawyer was disposed to give up the contest and retire in favour of
  the Superintendent. But at that moment Polton returned, bearing a decanter of
  port which he deposited on Mr. Brodribb's table; whereupon the balance of
  probabilities was restored.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Brodribb, as Thorndyke filled the three glasses, "it's all very
  well to sentimentalize about the Last Rose of Summer, but the First Fire of
  Winter makes more appeal to me."</p>

  <p>"You can hardly call it winter at the beginning of October," Miller
  objected.</p>

  <p>"Can't you, by Jove!" exclaimed Brodribb. "Perhaps not by the calendar;
  but when I came through the Carey Street gateway just now, the wind was
  enough to nip the nose off a brass monkey. But I haven't got a fire yet. It's
  only you medico-legal sybarites who can afford such luxuries."</p>

  <p>He sipped his wine ecstatically, spread out his toes and blinked at the
  fire with an air of enjoyment that suggested a particularly magnificent old
  Tom cat. The superintendent made no rejoinder, and Thorndyke and I filled our
  pipes and waited curiously for the situation to develop.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Brodribb, after an interval of silence, "you haven't got
  any forrarder with that Fenchurch Street mystery; I mean the box with the
  gentleman's head in it?"</p>

  <p>"Gentleman, indeed!" exclaimed Miller. "He was about the ugliest beggar
  that I ever clapped eyes on. I don't wonder they cut his head off. He must
  have been a lot better-looking without it."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Brodribb, "you've got to admit that the man was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," rejoined Miller; "and if you had seen him, you wouldn't have
  been surprised. His face was an outrage on humanity."</p>

  <p>"So it may have been," retorted Brodribb, "but ugliness is not provocation
  in a legal sense. You don't mean to say that you have abandoned the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"We never abandon a case at The Yard," replied Miller, "but it's no use
  fussing about when you've nothing to go on. As a matter of fact, we expect to
  approach the problem from another direction. For the moment, we are letting
  that particular box rest while we give a little attention to the other
  box&mdash;the one that was stolen."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Brodribb. "Yes; very necessary, I should say. But what is your
  idea about it? You don't think it possible that it contained the body which
  belonged to the head?"</p>

  <p>Miller shook his head. "No," said he. "I think you can rule that out. If
  the original case had contained a headless corpse, Mr. Dobson would not have
  been so ready to open the doubtful one in the presence of the attendant. You
  see, until they got it open, it wasn't certain that it was a different
  case."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, "I don't quite see the connexion. You said that you
  were approaching the problem of the head from another direction&mdash;through
  the stolen box, as I understood."</p>

  <p>"That is so," replied Miller; "and you must see that there is evidently
  some connexion between the two cases. To begin with, the second case, which
  we may call the head case, was exactly similar to the first one&mdash;the
  stolen case&mdash;and we may take it that the similarity was purposely
  arranged. The head case was prepared as a counterfeit so that it could be
  exchanged for the other. But from that it follows that the person who
  prepared the head case must have known exactly what the other case was like,
  even to what was written on the label; and as he was at a good deal of
  trouble to steal the first case, we may take it that he knew what that case
  contained. So there you have a clear connexion on the one side. As to whether
  the man, Dobson, recognized the head or knew anything about it, we can't be
  sure."</p>

  <p>"The way in which he made himself scarce when he had seen it," said
  Brodribb, "rather suggests that he did."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," Miller objected. "The question is, What was in the
  stolen case? He stated that the contents were worth several thousand pounds,
  but in spite of that, he made no attempt at recovery or claim for
  compensation. It looks as if he was not in a position to say what <i>was</i>
  in the case. But that suggests that the contents were not his lawful
  property; in fact, that the case contained stolen property&mdash;perhaps the
  loot from some robbery. Now, if that were so, he would have to clear off in
  any event to avoid inquiries. Naturally, then, when he came on that head, he
  would have realized that he was fairly in the soup. The fact that he had been
  in possession of stolen property wouldn't have been a bit helpful if he had
  been charged with complicity in a murder. I'm not surprised that he
  bolted."</p>

  <p>"Is there any clue to what has become of the stolen case?" Brodribb
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller; "but that is not the question which is interesting
  us. What we want to know is, not where it went, but where it came from, and
  what was in it."</p>

  <p>"And that, I presume, you don't know at present," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent took a long draw at his cigar, blew out a cloud of
  smoke and performed the operation that he would have described as "wetting
  his whistle." Then he set down his glass and replied, cautiously:</p>

  <p>"As the Doctor is listening, I mustn't use the word 'know.' But we think
  we've got a pretty good idea."</p>

  <p>"Have you?" Brodribb exclaimed. "Now, I wonder what you have discovered.
  But I suppose it isn't in order for an outsider like me to pry into the
  secrets of Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent did not reply immediately, but from something in his
  manner, I suspected that he had come expressly to discuss the matter with us,
  but was "inhibited" by Brodribb's presence. At length, Thorndyke broke the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"We are all very much interested, Miller, and we are all very
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"H'm yes," said Miller. "Three lawyers and a detective officer ought to be
  able to produce a fair amount of discretion between them. And I don't know
  that it's such a deadly secret, after all. Still, we are keeping our own
  counsel, so you will understand that what I may mention mustn't go any
  farther."</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly safe, Miller," Thorndyke assured him. "You know Jervis
  and me of old, and I can tell you that Mr. Brodribb is as close as an
  oyster."</p>

  <p>Thus reassured, Miller (who was really bursting to give us his news)
  moistened his whistle afresh and began:</p>

  <p>"You must understand that we are at present dealing with what the Doctor
  calls hypothesis, though we have got a solid foundation of fact. As to what
  was in that stolen case, we have no direct evidence; but we have formed a
  pretty confident opinion. In fact, we think we know what that case contained.
  What do you suppose it was?"</p>

  <p>I ventured to suggest jewellery, or perhaps bullion. "You are not so far
  out," said Miller. "We say that it was platinum."</p>

  <p>"Platinum!" I exclaimed. "But there was a hundredweight of it! Why, at the
  present price, it must have been worth a king's ransom!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much that is," said Miller, "but we reckon the value of
  the contents at between seventeen and eighteen thousand pounds. That is only
  a rough estimate, of course. We think that the witness, Crump, was mistaken
  about the weight, and it was only a guess, in any case. He hadn't tested the
  weight of the package. At any rate, we can't account for more than about half
  a hundredweight of platinum."</p>

  <p>"You have some perfectly definite information, then?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Definite enough so far as it goes," replied Miller, "but it doesn't go
  far enough. We are quite clear that a parcel of platinum weighing about
  twenty-five kilograms&mdash;roughly, half a hundredweight&mdash;was stolen
  and has disappeared. That is actual fact. The rest is inference, or, as the
  Doctor would say, hypothesis. But I will give you a sketch of the affair,
  leaving out the details that don't matter.</p>

  <p>"Our information is that, about the end of last June, a quantity of
  platinum was shipped by a Latvian firm at Riga. It was packed in small wooden
  cases, each containing twenty-five kilos, and consigned to various dealers in
  Germany, France and Italy. Well, the cases were all duly delivered at their
  respective destinations, and everything seemed to be in order excepting the
  contents of one of the Italian cases. That happened to be the last one that
  was delivered, and, as the ship had made a good many calls on her voyage, it
  wasn't delivered until the beginning of August. When it was opened, it was
  found to contain, instead of the platinum, an equal weight of lead.</p>

  <p>"Obviously, there had been a robbery somewhere, but, owing to the time
  which had elapsed, it was difficult to trace. One thing, however, was clear;
  the job had been done by somebody who was in the know. That was evident from
  the fact that the case was in all respects exactly like the original case and
  all the other cases."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it have been the original case with the contents changed?"
  I asked.</p>

  <p>"That hardly seems possible. It would have been difficult enough to steal
  the case; but to steal it, empty it, refill it and put it back, looks like an
  impossibility. No, we can be pretty certain that the thieves had the dummy
  case ready and just made a quick exchange. That must have been the method,
  whoever did the job; but the puzzle was to discover the time and place of the
  robbery. The stuff had made a long journey to the port of delivery and the
  robbery might have taken place anywhere along the route.</p>

  <p>"Eventually, suspicion arose with regard to an English yacht, the
  <i>Cormorant,</i> which had berthed close to the <i>Kronstadt</i>&mdash;that
  was the name of the ship which carried the stuff while she was taking in her
  cargo at Riga. It was recalled that she had occupied the next berth to the
  <i>Kronstadt</i> at the time when the platinum was being shipped, and someone
  remembered that, at that very time, the <i>Cormorant</i> was taking stores on
  board, including one or two big hampers. Accordingly, the Latvian police made
  some inquiries on the spot, and, though they didn't discover anything very
  sensational, the little that they did learn seemed to favour the idea that
  the platinum might have been taken away on the yacht. This is what it
  amounted to, together with what we have picked up since.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Cormorant</i> is a sturdy little yawl-rigged vessel&mdash;she
  appears to be a converted fishing lugger from Shoreham&mdash;of about thirty
  tons. She turned up at Riga on the 21st. of June and took up her berth
  alongside the quay where the <i>Kronstadt</i> had just berthed. She went out
  from time to time for a sail in the Gulf but always came back to the same
  berth. Her crew consisted of four men, of whom three seemed to be regular
  seamen of the fisherman type, while the fourth, the skipper, whose name was
  Bassett, was a man of a superior class. The description of Bassett agrees
  completely with that of the man whom we have called Dobson&mdash;the man who
  deposited the case that was stolen from the cloak room; and the description
  of one of the crew seems to tally with that of the man who stole the
  case&mdash;the man whom we have called 'the head man.' Perhaps we had better
  call him Mr. 'X' for convenience.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I have said, at the time the platinum was shipped, the
  <i>Cormorant</i> was taking in stores; and her hampers and cases were on the
  quay at the same time as the cases of platinum and quite close to them. The
  platinum was unloaded from a closed van and dumped on the quay, and the
  <i>Cormorant's</i> stores were unloaded from a wagon and also dumped on the
  quay. Then, as soon at the <i>Cormorant</i> had got her stores on board, she
  put out for a sail in the bay. But she was back in her berth again in about a
  couple of hours; and there she remained, on and off, for the next five days.
  It was not until the 26th. of June that she left Riga for good."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't the fact that she stayed there so long rather conflict with the
  idea that she had the stolen platinum on board?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well," Miller replied, "on the face of it, it does seem to. But if you
  bear all the circumstances in mind, I don't think it does. As soon as all the
  platinum was on board the <i>Kronstadt,</i> the danger of discovery was over.
  Remember, there was the right number of cases. There was nothing missing. It
  was practically certain that the robbery would not be discovered until the
  dummy case was opened by the consignees. Bearing that in mind, you see that
  it would be an excellent tactical plan to stay on at Riga as if nothing had
  happened; whereas it might have looked suspicious if the yacht had put to sea
  immediately after the shipment of the platinum.</p>

  <p>"The next thing we hear of the yacht is that she arrived at Southend on
  the 17th. of August."</p>

  <p>"Have you ascertained where she had been in the interval?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No" he replied, "because, you see, it doesn't particularly concern us, as
  our theory is that she still had the platinum on board. But I must admit
  that, apart from the cloak room incident, we can't get any evidence that she
  had. At Southend she was boarded by the Customs Officer, and, as she had just
  come from Rotterdam and had been cruising up the Baltic and along the German
  and Dutch coasts, he made a pretty rigorous search, especially for tobacco.
  He turned out every possible place in which a few cigars or cakes of 'hard'
  could have been stowed, and he even took up the trap in the cabin floor and
  squeezed down into the little hold. But he didn't find anything beyond the
  few trifles that had been declared. So his evidence is negative."</p>

  <p>"It is rather more than negative," said I. "It amounts to positive
  evidence that the platinum wasn't there."</p>

  <p>"Well, in a way, it does," Miller admitted. "It certainly doesn't help us.
  But there was one curious fact that we got from him. It seems that there were
  still four men on board the yacht; but they were not the same four men. One
  of them, at least, was different. The Customs man didn't see anybody
  corresponding to the description of Mr. 'X.' On the other hand, there was a
  tall, clean shaved, elderly man who didn't look like a seaman&mdash;looked
  more like a lawyer or a doctor and spoke like a gentleman, or, at least, an
  educated man, though with a slight foreign accent, and didn't seem very
  anxious to speak at all; seemed more disposed to keep himself to himself. But
  the interesting point to us is the disappearance of Mr. 'X.' That seems to
  give us something like a complete scheme of the whole affair, including the
  transaction at the cloak room."</p>

  <p>"Were you proposing to let us hear your scheme of the robbery?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "I don't see why not, as I have told you so much. Of
  course, you will understand that it is very largely guess-work, but still, it
  comes together into a consistent whole. I will just give you an outline of
  what we believe to have been the course of events.</p>

  <p>"We take it that this was a very carefully planned robbery, carried out by
  a party of experienced criminals who must all have had a fair knowledge of
  sea-faring. One of them, at least&mdash;probably the skipper,
  Bassett&mdash;must have had some pretty exact information as to the time and
  place at which the platinum was shipped and the size and character of the
  cases that it was stowed in. They must have arrived at the selected berth
  with a carefully prepared dummy case ready for use at the psychological
  moment. Then, when the cases of platinum arrived&mdash;and they must have
  known when to expect them&mdash;the dummy was smuggled up to the quay,
  covered up in some way, and slipped in amongst the genuine cases. Then they
  must have managed to cover up one of these, and they probably waited until
  the whole consignment, including the dummy, had been put on board and
  checked. There would have been the right number, you must remember.</p>

  <p>"Well, when all the platinum appeared to have been put on board, there
  would have been no difficulty in taking the one that they had
  pinched&mdash;still covered up&mdash;on to the yacht along with their own
  stores. As soon as they had got it on board, they cast off and went for a
  sail in the bay; and during that little trip, they would be able safely to
  unload the case, break it up and burn it and stow the platinum in the
  hiding-place that they had got prepared in advance. When they came back to
  their berth, they had got the loot safely hidden and were ready to submit to
  a search, if need be. And it must have been an uncommonly cleverly devised
  hiding-place, for they made no difficulty about letting the Customs officer
  at Southend rummage the vessel to his heart's content."</p>

  <p>"It must, as you say, have been a mighty perfect hiding-place," I
  remarked, "to have eluded the Customs man. When one of those gentry becomes
  really inquisitive, there isn't much that escapes him. He knows all the ropes
  and is up to all the smugglers' dodges."</p>

  <p>"You must bear in mind, Jervis," Thorndyke reminded me, "that he was not
  looking for platinum. He was looking for tobacco. Do you know, Miller, in
  what form the metal was shipped? Was it in ingots or bars or plates?"</p>

  <p>"It was in plates; thin sheets, in fact, about a millimetre in thickness
  and thirty centimetres&mdash;roughly twelve inches&mdash;square; a most
  convenient form for stowing in a hiding-place, for you could roll up the
  plates or cut them up with shears into little pieces."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "and the plates themselves would take up very
  little room. You say the Customs man squeezed down into the hold. Do you know
  what the ballast was like? In a fishing vessel, it usually consists of rough
  pigs of iron and square ends of old chain and miscellaneous scrap, in which a
  few rolled-up plates of metal would not be noticed."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Miller replied, "the <i>Cormorant's</i> ballast wasn't like that. It
  was proper yacht's ballast; lead weights, properly cast to fit the timbers
  and set in a neat row on each side of the kelson. So the hold was perfectly
  clear and the Customs man was able to see all over it from end to end.</p>

  <p>"But to return to our scheme. When they had got the platinum safely
  hidden, our friends decided to stay on in their berth for a few days for the
  sake of appearances. Then they put to sea and proceeded in a leisurely,
  yacht-like fashion to make their way home. But during the voyage something
  seems to have happened. It looks rather as if the rogues had fallen out. At
  any rate, Mr. 'X' seems to have left the ship, and this stranger to have come
  on board in his place. I don't understand the stranger at all. I can't fit
  him into the picture. But Mr. 'X' apparently had a plan for grabbing the loot
  for himself, and, when he went ashore, he must have left a confederate on
  board to keep him informed as to when the cargo was going to be landed.</p>

  <p>"As to the landing, there wouldn't have been any difficulty about that.
  When the Customs man had made his search and found everything in order, the
  papers would be made out and the ship would be passed as 'cleared.' After
  that, the crew would be at liberty to take any of their goods ashore
  unchallenged. And the arrangements for getting the platinum landed were
  excellent. The yacht was brought up in Benfleet Creek, quite close to the
  railway. Evidently, the case was carried up to the station, and Bassett must
  have taken it into the carriage with him to avoid having a label stuck on it
  and giving a clue to the cloak room attendant.</p>

  <p>"Why Bassett decided to plant it in the cloak room is not very clear. We
  can only suppose that he hadn't any other place to put it at the moment, and
  that he left it there while he was making arrangements for its disposal. But
  it gave Mr. 'X' his chance. No doubt his pal on board made it his business to
  find out what became of the case, and gave Mr. 'X' the tip; which Mr. 'X'
  acted on very promptly and efficiently. And he and his pal are at this moment
  some seventeen thousand pounds to the good.</p>

  <p>"That is the scheme of the affair that we suggest. Of course, it is only a
  rough sketch, and you will say that it is all hypothesis from beginning to
  end, and so it is. But it hangs together."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is a consistent story, but it is all absolutely in
  the air. It is just a string of assumptions without a particle of evidence at
  any point. You begin by assuming that the case which was stolen from the
  cloak room contained the missing platinum. Then, from that, you deduce that
  the case came from the yacht, and therefore the man who deposited it must be
  Bassett, and the other man must be a member of the crew. And you don't even
  refer to the trivial circumstance that a box containing a man's head was left
  in exchange."</p>

  <p>"I have already said," Miller rejoined a little impatiently, "that we are
  letting the problem of the head rest for the moment, as we have nothing to go
  on. But it is evidently connected in some way with the stolen case, so we are
  following that up. If we can connect that with the platinum robbery and lay
  our hands on Bassett and Mr. 'X,' we shall soon know something more about
  that head. I don't think your criticism is quite fair, Dr. Jervis. What do
  you say, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," said Thorndyke, "that Jervis's criticism overstates
  the case. Your scheme is admittedly hypothetical, and there is no direct
  evidence. So it may or may not be a true account of what happened. But I
  think the balance of probabilities is in favour of its being substantially
  true. You don't know anything about any of these men?"</p>

  <p>"No; you see they are only names, and probably wrong names."</p>

  <p>"You found no finger-prints on the address label of the 'head case'?"</p>

  <p>"None that we could identify. Probably only those of chance
  strangers."</p>

  <p>"And what has become of the yacht and the crew?"</p>

  <p>"The yacht is still lying in Benfleet Creek. Bassett left her in charge of
  a local boat builder as there is no one on board and the crew have gone away.
  We got a search warrant and rummaged her thoroughly, but we didn't find
  anything. So we sealed up the hatches and put on special padlocks and left
  the keys with the local police."</p>

  <p>"Do you know whom she belongs to?"</p>

  <p>"She belongs to Bassett. He bought her from a man at Shoreham. And she is
  now supposed to be for sale; but, as the owner's whereabouts are not known,
  of course, she can't be sold. For practical purposes she is abandoned, but we
  are paying the boat builder for keeping an eye on her, pending the
  re-appearance of Mr. Bassett. Meanwhile we are keeping a look-out for that
  gentleman and Mr. 'X,' and for the appearance on the market of any platinum
  of uncertain origin. And that is about all that we can do until we get some
  fresh information."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," said Thorndyke; "and, by the way, to return to the
  mysterious head; what has been done with it?"</p>

  <p>"It has been buried in an air-tight case in Tower Hamlets Cemetery, with a
  stone to mark the spot in case it should be wanted. But we've got a stock of
  photographs of it which we have been circulating in the provinces to the
  various police stations. Perhaps you would like me to send you a set."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Miller," Thorndyke replied. "I should like a set to attach to
  the report of the inquest, which I have filed for reference."</p>

  <p>"On the chance that, sooner or later, the inquiry may come into your
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There is always that possibility," Thorndyke replied. And this
  brought the discussion to an end, at least so far as Miller was
  concerned.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; MR. BRODRIBB'S DILEMMA</h2>

  <p class="first">THE silence which fell after Thorndyke's last rejoinder
  lasted for more than a minute. At length it was broken by Brodribb who, after
  profound meditation, launched a sort of broadcast question, addressed to no
  one in particular.</p>

  <p>"Does anyone know anything about a certain Mr. Horatio Gimbler?"</p>

  <p>"Police court solicitor?" inquired Miller.</p>

  <p>"That is what I assumed," replied Brodribb, "from his address, which
  seemed to be an unlikely one for a solicitor in general practice. Then you
  do, apparently, know him, at least by name."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller admitted, "I have known him, more or less, for a good many
  years."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, "you can probably tell me whether you would
  consider him a particularly likely practitioner to have the conduct of a
  claim to a peerage."</p>

  <p>"A peerage!" gasped Miller, gazing at Brodribb in astonishment. "Holy
  smoke! No. I&mdash;certainly&mdash;should&mdash;NOT!" He paused for a few
  moments to recover from his amazement and then asked: "What sort of a claim
  is it, and who is the claimant?"</p>

  <p>"The claimant is an American and, at present, I don't know much about him.
  I'll give you some of the particulars presently, but, first, I should like to
  hear what you know about Mr. Gimbler."</p>

  <p>Miller appeared to reflect rapidly, accompanying the process by the
  emission of voluminous clouds of smoke. At length he replied, cautiously:</p>

  <p>"It is understood that what is said here is spoken in strict
  confidence."</p>

  <p>To this reasonable stipulation we all assented with one accord and Miller
  continued: "This fellow, Gimbler, is a rather remarkable person. He is a good
  lawyer, in a sense; at any rate, he has criminal law and procedure at his
  finger ends. He knows all the ropes&mdash;some that he oughtn't to know quite
  so well. He is up to all the tricks and dodges of the professional crooks,
  and I should think that his acquaintance includes practically all the crooks
  that are on the lay. If we could only pump him, he would be a perfect mine of
  information. But we can't. He's as secret as the grave. The criminal class
  provide his living, and he makes it his business to study their
  interests."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that you can complain of that," said Brodribb. "It is a
  lawyer's duty to consider the interests of his clients, no matter who they
  may be."</p>

  <p>"That's perfectly true," replied Miller, "in respect of the individual
  client; but it is not the duty even of a criminal lawyer to grease the wheels
  of crime, so to speak. However, we are speaking of the man. Well, I have told
  you what we know of him, and I may add that he is about the downiest bird
  that I am acquainted with and as slippery as an eel. That is what we
  <i>know."</i></p>

  <p>Here Miller paused significantly with the air of a man who expects to be
  asked a question. Accordingly, Brodribb ventured to offer a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"That is what you know. But I take it that you have certain opinions in
  addition to your actual knowledge?"</p>

  <p>Miller nodded. "Yes," said he. "We are very much interested in Mr.
  Gimbler. Some of us have a feeling that there may possibly be something
  behind his legal practice. You know, in the practice of crime there is a fine
  opening for a clever and crooked brain. The professional crook, himself, is
  usually an unmitigated donkey, who makes all sorts of blunders in planning
  his jobs and carrying them out; and when you find the perfect ass doing a job
  that seems right outside his ordinary capabilities, you can't help wondering
  whether there may not be someone of a different calibre behind the scenes,
  pulling the strings."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Brodribb. "Do I understand that you suspect this legal luminary
  of being the invisible operator of a sort of unlawful puppet show?"</p>

  <p>"I would hardly use the word 'suspect,'" replied Miller. "But some of
  us&mdash;including myself&mdash;have entertained the idea. And not, mind you,
  without any show of reason. There was a certain occasion on which we really
  thought we had got our hands on him; but we hadn't. If he was guilty&mdash;I
  don't say that he was, mind you&mdash;but if he was, he slipped out of the
  net uncommonly neatly. It was a case of forgery; at least we thought it was.
  But, if it was, it was so good that the experts wouldn't swear to it, and the
  case wasn't clear enough to take into Court."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb pricked up his ears. "Forgery, you say; and a good forgery at
  that? You don't remember the particulars, I suppose? Because the question has
  a rather special interest for me."</p>

  <p>"I only remember that it was a will case. The signature of the testator
  and the two witnesses were disputed, but, as all three were dead, the
  question had to be decided on the opinions of experts; and none of the
  experts were certain enough to swear that the signatures might not be
  genuine. So the will had to be accepted as a genuine document. I suppose I
  mustn't ask how the question interests you?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, "we are speaking in confidence, and I don't know
  that the matter is one of any great secrecy. It concerns this peerage claim
  that I was speaking about. I have had a copy of the pleadings, and I see that
  the claimant relies on certain documents to prove the identity of a very
  doubtful person. If you would care to hear an outline of the case, I don't
  think there would be any harm in my giving you a few of the particulars. I
  really came here to talk the case over with Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"If the pleadings were drawn up by Mr. Gimbler," said Miller, "I should
  like very much to hear an outline of the case. And you can take it that I
  shall not breathe a word to any living soul."</p>

  <p>"The pleadings," said Brodribb, "were drawn up by counsel, but, of course,
  on Gimbler's instructions. The facts, or alleged facts, must have been
  supplied by him. However, before I come to his part in the business, there
  are certain other matters to consider; so it will be better if I take the
  case as a whole and in the natural order of events.</p>

  <p>"Let me begin by explaining that I am the Earl of Winsborough's man of
  business. My father and grandfather both acted in the same capacity for
  former holders of the title, so, naturally, all the relevant documents on the
  one side are in my keeping. I am also the executor of the present Earl's
  will, though there is not much in that, as practically everything is left to
  the heir."</p>

  <p>"You speak of the present Earl," said Thorndyke. "But, if there is a
  present Earl, how comes it that a claim is being made to the earldom? Is an
  attempt being made to oust the present holder of the title?"</p>

  <p>"I spoke of the present Earl," replied Brodribb, "because that is the
  legal position, and I, as his agent, am bound to accept it. But, as a matter
  of fact, I do not believe that there is a present Earl of Winsborough. I have
  no doubt that the Earl is dead. He went away on an exploring and big game
  hunting expedition to South America nearly five years ago, and has not been
  heard of for over four years. But, of course, in a legal sense, he is still
  alive and will remain alive until he is either proved or presumed to be dead.
  Hence these present proceedings; which began with a proposal on the part of
  the heir presumptive to apply to the Court for permission to presume death.
  The heir presumptive is a young man, a son of the Earl's first cousin, who
  has only recently come of age. As I had no doubt that he was the real heir
  presumptive&mdash;there being, in fact, no other possible claimant known to
  me&mdash;and very little doubt that the Earl was dead, I did not propose to
  contest the application; but, as the Earl's agent, I could not very well act
  for the applicant. Accordingly, I turned the business over to my friend,
  Marchmont, and intended only to watch the case in the interests of the
  estate. Then, suddenly, this new claimant appeared out of the blue; and his
  appearance has complicated the affair most infernally.</p>

  <p>"You see the dilemma. Both claimants wish to apply for permission to
  presume death. But neither of them is the admitted heir presumptive, and
  consequently neither of them has the necessary <i>locus standi</i> to make
  the application."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't they make a joint application?" Miller asked, "and fight out the
  claim afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether that could be done," replied Brodribb, "or whether they
  would be prepared to act in concert. Each would probably be afraid of seeming
  to concede the claim to the other. The alternative plan would be for them to
  settle the question of heirship before applying for leave to presume death.
  But there is the difficulty that, until death is presumed, the present Earl
  is alive in a legal sense, and, that being so, the Court might reasonably
  hold that the question of heirship does not arise. And, as the Earl is a
  bachelor and there are no near relatives, there is no one else to make the
  application."</p>

  <p>"In any event," said I, "the new claimant's case would have to be dealt
  with by a Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords. Isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is," replied Brodribb. "This is not a case of reviving a
  dormant peerage. If the American's case, as stated in the pleadings, is
  sound, he is unquestionably the heir presumptive."</p>

  <p>"What does his case amount to?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Put in a nutshell," replied Brodribb, "it amounts to this: The American
  gentleman, whose name is Christopher Pippet, is the grandson of a certain
  Josiah Pippet who was the keeper of a tavern somewhere in London. But there
  is a persistent tradition in the family that the said Josiah was living a
  double life under an assumed name, and that he was really the Earl of
  Winsborough. It is stated that he was in the habit of going away from his
  home and his usual places of resort and leaving no address. It is further
  stated that during these periodical absences&mdash;which often lasted for a
  month or two&mdash;he was actually in residence at Winsborough Castle; that,
  when Josiah was absent from home, the Earl was in residence at the Castle,
  and when Josiah was at the tavern, the Earl was absent from the Castle."</p>

  <p>"And did Josiah and the Earl die simultaneously and in the same place?" I
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"No," said Brodribb. "The double life was brought to an end by Josiah, who
  is said, after the death of his wife and the marriage of his sons and
  daughter, to have grown weary of it. He wound up the affair by a simulated
  death, a mock funeral and the burial of a dummy coffin weighted with lumps of
  lead, after which he went to the Castle and took up his residence there for
  good. That is the substance of the story."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent snorted contemptuously. "And you tell us, sir," said
  he, "that this man, Gimbler, is actually going to spin that yarn in a court
  of law. Why, the thing's grotesque&mdash;childish. He'd be howled out of
  Court."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Brodribb, "that it sounds wild enough. But it is not
  impossible. Few things are. It is just a question of what they can prove.
  According to the pleadings, there are certain passages in a diary of the late
  Josiah which prove incontestably that he and the Earl were one and the same
  person."</p>

  <p>"That diary," said Miller, "will be worth a pretty careful examination,
  having regard to the circumstances that I mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Brodribb agreed; "though it seems to me that it would be
  extremely difficult to interpolate passages in a diary. There is usually no
  space in which to put them."</p>

  <p>"Does the claimant propose to produce the dummy coffin with the lumps of
  lead in it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has been said on that subject up to the present," Brodribb
  answered. "It would certainly be highly relevant; but, of course, they
  couldn't produce it without an exhumation order."</p>

  <p>"I think you can take it," said Miller, "that they will leave that coffin
  severely alone&mdash;if you let them."</p>

  <p>"Probably you are right," said Brodribb. "But the difficulty that
  confronts us at present is that it may be impossible to proceed with the
  case. When it comes on for hearing, the Court may refuse to consider the
  application until one of the applicants has established his <i>locus
  standi</i> as a person competent to make it; and it may refuse to hear
  evidence as to the claim of either party to be the heir on the grounds that,
  inasmuch as the Earl has been neither proved nor presumed to be dead, he must
  be presumed to be alive, and that, therefore, in accordance with the legal
  maxim, <i>Nemo est heres viventis,</i> neither of the applicants can be the
  heir."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "is undoubtedly a possible contingency. But judges
  are eminently reasonable men and it is not the modern practice to favour
  legal hair-splittings. We may assume that the Court will not raise any
  difficulties that are not unavoidable; and this is a case which calls for
  some elasticity of procedure. For the difficulty which exists today might
  conceivably still exist fifty years hence; and, meanwhile, the title and the
  estates would be left derelict. What are the proceedings that are actually in
  contemplation, and who is making the first move?"</p>

  <p>"The American claimant, Pippet, is making the first move. Gimbler has
  briefed Rufus McGonnell, K.C. as his leader with Montague Klein as junior. He
  is proposing to apply for permission to presume the death of the Earl. I am
  contesting his application and challenging his claim to be the heir
  presumptive. That, he thinks, will enable him to produce his evidence and
  argue his claim as an issue preliminary to and forming part of the main
  issue. But I doubt very much whether the Court will consent to hear any
  evidence or any arguments that are not directly relevant to the question of
  the probability of the Earl's death. It is a very awkward situation. Pippet's
  claim looks like a rather grotesque affair; and if he is depending on the
  entries in a diary, I shouldn't think he has the ghost of a chance. Still, it
  ought to be settled one way or the other for the sake of young Giles
  Engleheart, the real heir presumptive, as I assume."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't Engleheart proceed with his application?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Brodribb, "the same difficulty would arise. The other
  claimant would challenge his competency to make the application. It is a
  ridiculous dilemma. There are two issues, and each of them requires the other
  to be settled before it can be decided. It is very difficult to know what to
  do."</p>

  <p>"The only thing that you can do," said Thorndyke, "is what you seem to be
  doing; let things take their own course and wait upon events. Pippet is
  making the first move. Well, let him make it; and, if the Court won't hear
  him, it will be time for you to consider what you will do next. Meanwhile, it
  would be wise for you to assume that the Court will allow him to produce
  evidence of his competency to make the application. It is quite possible; and
  if you are supporting Mr. Engleheart's claim, you ought to be ready to
  contest the other claim."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Brodribb, "that is really what I came to talk to you about;
  and the first question is, do you know anything about these two counsel,
  McGonnell and Klein? I don't seem to remember either of them."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't," 'replied Thorndyke. "They are both almost exclusively
  criminal practitioners. But, in their own line, they are men of first class
  capabilities. You can take it that they will give you a run for your money if
  they get the chance, in spite of their being rather off their usual beat.
  Have you decided on your own counsel?"</p>

  <p>"I have decided to secure your services, in any event. Would you be
  prepared to take the brief?"</p>

  <p>"I will take it if you wish me to," replied Thorndyke, "but I think you
  would be better advised to employ Anstey. For this reason. If the case comes
  into court, it is possible that certain questions may arise on which you
  might wish me to give expert evidence. I think you would do well to let me
  keep an eye on the technical aspects of the case and let Anstey do the actual
  court work."</p>

  <p>Brodribb looked sharply at Thorndyke but made no immediate reply; and, in
  the ensuing silence, a low chuckle was heard to proceed from the
  Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I like the delicate way the Doctor puts it," said he, by way of
  explaining the chuckle. "The technical aspects of this case will call for a
  good deal of watching; and I need not tell you, Mr. Brodribb, that, if the
  Doctor's eye is on them, there won't be much that will pass unobserved. In
  fact, I shouldn't be surprised to learn that the Doctor has got one or two of
  them in his eye already."</p>

  <p>"Neither should I," said Brodribb. "Nothing surprises me where Thorndyke
  is concerned. At any rate I shall act on your advice, Thorndyke. One couldn't
  ask for a better counsel that Anstey; and it is not necessary for me to
  stipulate that you go over the pleadings with him and put him up to any
  possible dodges on the part of our friend Mr. Gimbler. Remember that I am
  retaining you, and that you do as you please about pleading in court."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Thorndyke. "You will keep Anstey and me fully
  instructed, and I shall give the case the most careful consideration in
  regard to any contingencies that may arise. As Miller has hinted, there are a
  good many possibilities, especially if Mr. Gimbler should think it necessary
  to throw a little extra weight into the balance of probabilities."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Brodribb, "then we will leave it at that. If you have
  the case in hand, I shall feel that I can go ahead in confidence; and I only
  hope that McGonnell will be able to persuade the Court to hear the evidence
  on his client's claim. It would be a blessed thing if we could get that
  question settled so that we could go straight ahead with the other
  question&mdash;the presumption of death. I am getting a little worried by the
  more or less derelict condition of the Winsborough estates and it would be a
  relief to see a young man fairly settled in possession."</p>

  <p>"You are rather taking it for granted that the American's claim will fall
  through," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"So I am," he admitted. "But you must allow that it does sound like a cock
  and bull story, and none too straightforward at that. However, we shall see.
  If I get nothing more out of it, I have had an extremely pleasant evening and
  a devilish good bottle of wine, and now it's about time that I took myself
  off and let you get to bed."</p>

  <p>With this he rose and shook hands; and the Superintendent, taking the
  rather broad hint conveyed in the concluding sentence, rose too, and the pair
  took their departure together.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE FINAL PREPARATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">MOST of us have wit enough to be wise after the event, and a
  few of us have enough to be wise before. Thorndyke was one of these few, and
  I, alas! was not. I am speaking in generalities, but I am thinking of a
  particular case&mdash;the Winsborough Peerage Claim. That case I could not
  bring myself to take seriously. The story appeared to me, as it had appeared
  to Miller, merely grotesque. Its improbabilities were so outrageous that I
  could not entertain it as a problem for serious consideration. And then, such
  as it was, it was a purely legal case, completely outside our ordinary line
  of practice. At least, that is how it appeared to me.</p>

  <p>Now, Thorndyke made no such mistake. Naturally, he could not foresee
  developments in detail. But subsequent events showed that he had foreseen,
  and very carefully considered, all the possible contingencies, so that when
  they arose they found him prepared. And he also saw clearly that the case
  might turn out to be very much in our line.</p>

  <p>As I was unaware of his views&mdash;Thorndyke being the most
  uncommunicative man whom I have ever known&mdash;I looked with some surprise
  on the obvious interest that he took in the case. So great was that interest
  that he actually adopted the extraordinary habit of spending week-ends at
  Winsborough Castle. What he did there I was unable to make out. I heard
  rumours of his having gone over the butler's accounts and some of the old
  household books and papers with Brodribb, which seemed a not unreasonable
  proceeding, though more in Brodribb's line than ours. But most of his time he
  apparently spent rambling about the country with a note book, a small camera
  and a set of six inch ordnance maps. And he evidently covered a surprising
  amount of ground, as I could see by the numbers of photographs that he
  brought home, and which he either developed himself or handed to our
  invaluable laboratory assistant, Polton, for development. Over those
  photographs, when they were printed, I pored with a feeling of stupefaction.
  They included churches, both inside and out, windmills, inns, churchyards,
  and quaint village streets; all very interesting and many of them charming.
  But what had they to do with the peerage case? I was completely
  mystified.</p>

  <p>On one occasion I accompanied him, and a very pleasant jaunt it was. The
  Castle was rather a delusion, though there were some mediaeval ruins of a
  castellated building; but the mansion was a pleasant, homely brick house of
  the late seventeenth century in the style of Wren's country houses. But our
  ramblings about the house and the adjoining gardens and park yielded no
  information&mdash;excepting as to the mental condition of a former
  proprietor, as suggested by the costly and idiotic additions that he had made
  to the mansion.</p>

  <p>These were, I must admit, perfectly astounding. On a low hill in the park
  near to the house was a stupendous brick tower&mdash;a regular Tower of
  Babel&mdash;from the summit of which we could look across the sea to the
  white cliffs of the coast of France. It stood quite alone and appeared to
  have no purpose beyond the view from the top, but the cost of its
  construction must have been enormous. But "George's Folly," to give the tower
  its appropriate local name, was not the most astonishing of these works. When
  we came down from the roof, Thorndyke produced a bunch of large keys, which
  he had borrowed from the butler, and with one of them opened a door in the
  basement. Then he switched on a portable electric lamp, by the light of which
  I perceived a flight of stone steps apparently descending into the bowels of
  the earth. Picking our way down these, we reached an archway opening into a
  roomy brick-walled passage, and making our way along this for fully a hundred
  yards, at length reached another door which, being unlocked, gave entrance to
  a large room, lighted by a brick shaft that opened on the surface. A
  moth-eaten carpet still covered the floor and the mouldering furniture
  remained as it had been left, presumably, by the eccentric builder.</p>

  <p>It was a strange and desolate-looking apartment, and the final touch of
  desolation was given by a multitude of bats which hung, head downwards, from
  the ceiling ornaments or fluttered silently in circles in the dark corners or
  in the dim light under the opening of the shaft.</p>

  <p>"This is a weird place, Thorndyke," I exclaimed. "What do you think could
  have been the object of building it?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know," he replied, "there was no particular object. It was
  the noble lord's hobby to build towers and underground apartments. This is
  not the only one. The door at the other end of the room opens into another
  passage which leads to several other large rooms. We may as well inspect
  them."</p>

  <p>We did so. In all, there were five large rooms connected by several
  hundred yards of passages, and three or four small rooms, all lighted by
  shafts and all still containing their original furniture and fittings.</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, as we threaded our way along the interminable passages
  back to the tower, "this man must have been a stark lunatic."</p>

  <p>"He was certainly highly eccentric," said Thorndyke, "though we must make
  some allowance for an idle rich man. But you see the significance of this.
  Supposing that the peerage claim were to be tried by a jury, and supposing
  that jury were brought here and shown these rooms and passages. Do you think
  Mr. Pippet's story would appear to them so particularly incredible? Don't you
  think that they would say that a man who could busy himself in works of this
  kind would be capable of any folly or eccentricity?"</p>

  <p>"I think it very likely," I admitted; "but for my own part, I must say
  that I cannot imagine his lordship as landlord of a London pub. Playing the
  fool in your own park is a slightly different occupation from drawing pints
  of beer for thirsty labourers. I wonder if the Kenningtonian Gimbler knows
  about these works of imagination."</p>

  <p>"He does," said Thorndyke. "A description of them was included in the
  'material facts' set forth in the pleadings. And he has examined them
  personally. He applied to Brodribb for permission to view the mansion, and,
  naturally, Brodribb gave it."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why 'naturally.' He was not called on to assist the claim
  which he was opposing."</p>

  <p>"He took the view&mdash;correctly, I think&mdash;that he ought not to
  hinder, in any way, the ascertainment of the material facts; facts, you must
  remember, that he does not dispute. And, really, he can afford to deal with
  the American claimant in a generous and sporting spirit. Mere evidence of
  eccentricity on the part of the late Earl will not do more than establish a
  bare possibility. A positive case has to be made out. The burden of proof is
  on Cousin Jonathan."</p>

  <p>"That is, if the case ever comes into court. I doubt if, it will."</p>

  <p>"Then you need doubt no longer," said he. "The case is down for hearing
  next week."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it is!" I exclaimed. "Do you know what form the proceedings
  will take?"</p>

  <p>"It is to be heard in the Probate Court. Ostensibly, it is an application
  by Christopher Pippet for permission to presume the death of Percy
  Engleheart, sixth Earl of Winsborough. Brodribb, acting in virtue of a power
  of attorney, opposes the application and challenges the <i>locus standi</i>
  of the applicant. Of course, we cannot say how far the case will be allowed
  to proceed; but I take it that it is proposed to allow Pippet to produce
  evidence establishing his <i>locus standi</i> as a person having such an
  interest in the estate as would entitle him to make the application. That is
  to say, he will be allowed to present the case on which he bases his claim to
  be the heir presumptive to the Earl. I certainly hope he will. There are all
  sorts of interesting possibilities in the case."</p>

  <p>"Interesting, no doubt, in a legal sense; but I don't see where we come
  in."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we shan't come in at all," he replied with a faint smile. "But I
  rather suspect that we shall. The special interest of the case to me lies in
  the fact that Mr. Pippet's counsel will be instructed by Mr. Horatio
  Gimbler."</p>

  <p>Something in Thorndyke's manner, as he made this last statement, seemed to
  suggest some special significance. But what that significance might be I was
  unable to guess, beyond the fact that the said Gimbler, being neither an
  infant nor a man of irreproachable reputation, might adopt some slightly
  irregular tactics. But I suspected that there was something more definite
  than this in my colleague's mind. However, the conversation went no farther
  on this occasion, and I was left to turn the problem over at my leisure.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's announcement had come to me as a complete surprise, for I had
  never believed that this fantastic case would actually find its way into the
  courts. But the case furnished a whole series of surprises, of which the
  first was administered on the day when the proceedings opened, and was
  connected with the personality and behaviour of the claimant. I had assumed
  that Mr. Christopher Pippet was an American adventurer who had come over to
  tell this cock and bull story in the hope of getting possession of a valuable
  English estate. Probably the idea arose&mdash;not quite
  unreasonably&mdash;from the fact that the claimant made his appearance under
  the guidance of a slightly shady police-court solicitor. In my mind I had
  written him down an impostor, and formed a picture of a hustling, brazen
  vulgarian, suitable to the part and appropriate to his company. The reality
  was surprisingly different.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the hearing, Brodribb appeared at our chambers
  accompanied by his clients, Mr. Giles Engleheart and his mother, to whom he
  presented us in his old-fashioned, courtly manner.</p>

  <p>"I thought it best," he explained, "that you should not meet in court as
  strangers. I have introduced Anstey already, and I think he is going to join
  us here. So we shall be able to make our descent on the Halls of Justice in a
  united body and thereby impress the opposition."</p>

  <p>"I suspect," said Mrs. Engleheart, "that the opposition is not so easily
  impressed. But my boy and I will feel some encouragement if we arrive
  escorted by our champions. Have we plenty of time?" she added, glancing a
  little anxiously at her watch.</p>

  <p>"We have," replied Brodribb, "if Anstey doesn't keep us waiting. Ah! here
  he is"; and, as a quick footstep was heard on the stair, he strode over to
  the door and threw it open, when our leading counsel entered with an
  exaggerated pretence of haste, holding his watch in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come," he exclaimed, "this won't do. We ought to be starting."</p>

  <p>"But," said Mrs. Engleheart, "we have been waiting for you, Mr.
  Anstey."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he retorted, "that is what I meant." Then, as the lady,
  unaccustomed to his whimsicalities, looked at him in some perplexity, he
  continued, briskly: "It is always desirable to be in court early on the
  opening day. Are we all ready? Then let us go forth and make our way to the
  scene of conflict. But not too much like a procession. And I want to have a
  few words with you, Thorndyke, <i>en route."</i></p>

  <p>With this, he took Thorndyke's arm and led the way out. Brodribb followed
  with Mrs. Engleheart and I brought up the rear with her son.</p>

  <p>As we walked at a leisurely pace&mdash;set by Anstey&mdash;across the
  precincts by way of the Cloisters and Pump Court, I took the opportunity to
  consider my companion as to his appearance and personality in general; and in
  all respects I was very favourably impressed, as I had been by the gentle
  dignity of his mother. Giles Engleheart was not only a fine, strapping,
  handsome young man and very unmistakeably a gentleman, but&mdash;like his
  mother&mdash;he conveyed the impression of a kindly, generous and amiable
  disposition. But, unlike his mother, he seemed disposed to regard the legal
  proceedings as a gigantic joke.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Engleheart," I said, by way of making conversation, "I think we
  shall make pretty short work of your American rival."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" said he. "I don't think Mr. Brodribb is so confident; and for my
  part, I rather hope you won't make it too short. He ought to have a run for
  his money&mdash;and he may give us a run for ours. After all, you know, sir,
  his statements are pretty definite, and we've no right to assume that he is a
  liar. And, if he isn't, his statements are probably true. And, if they are
  true, we've got to imagine George Augustus, fourth Earl of Winsborough, with
  his sleeves rolled up and a black linen apron on his tummy, pulling at the
  handles of the beer engine in a London pub. It's a quaint idea. I'm all agog
  to hear his counsel tell the story and trot out his evidence."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said I, "I can't bring myself to view the claim as anything
  more than a gross and crude imposture, and I shouldn't be surprised if the
  case ended in a charge of perjury."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean against Mr. Pippet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about Pippet," I replied, "but I look with
  considerable suspicion on his solicitor."</p>

  <p>Engleheart laughed cheerfully. "You are like Mr. Brodribb," said he. "The
  very mention of the name of Gimbler makes him
  spit&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;whereas I never hear it without thinking of
  Jabberwocky and the Slithy Toves."</p>

  <p>"What is the connexion?" I asked, rather foolishly. "Don't you remember,
  sir?" said he. "The Slithy Toves 'did gyre and gimble in the wabe.' Therefore
  they were gimblers. Q.E.D."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said I, laughing at his schoolboy joke, "Mr. Brodribb has
  noticed the connexion and suspects our friend of an intention to 'gyre and
  gimble' in a legal sense. And perhaps he is right. Time will show. But here
  we are at what Anstey calls 'the scene of conflict.'"</p>

  <p>Entering the great doorway, we followed our friends along the rather
  gloomy passages until Anstey pushed open a heavy swing door and stood,
  holding it open while Mrs. Engleheart and the rest of us passed through. Then
  he and Thorndyke and I retired to the robing room and hastily donned our wigs
  and gowns.</p>

  <p>When we returned to the court, the clock showed that there was still a
  quarter of an hour to spare, and, with the exception of one or two reporters,
  a few spectators in the gallery, and a stray barrister, we had the place to
  ourselves. But not for long. Even as the quarter was chiming, the heavy and
  noisy swing doors were pushed open and a party of strangers entered.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt as to who they were, for, though I had not recognized
  the name of Gimbler, I recognized the man, having seen him on several
  occasions at the Central Criminal Court; a big, burly man with a large,
  rather fat face, and small, furtive eyes; a sly-looking fellow, I decided,
  and forthwith wrote him down a knave. But the other members of the party gave
  me quite a little surprise. There were three of them&mdash;two women and a
  man; and the out-standing fact which instantly impressed me was their
  imposing appearance. It was not only that they were all well above the
  average of good looks, though that was a fact worth noting; but they all had
  the unmistakeable appearance and bearing of gentlefolk.</p>

  <p>Of course, my surprise was quite unreasonable, being due to an entirely
  gratuitous pre-conceived idea. But still more unreasonable was the instant
  change in my state of mind in regard to the claim. Looking at the
  claimant&mdash;as I assumed him to be, seeing that there was no other
  man&mdash;I found myself talking a revised view of the case. Clearly, this
  fine, upstanding gentleman with his clear-cut, strong, reposeful face, was an
  entirely different creature from the raffish cosmopolitan adventurer of my
  imagination, who had come over to "tell the tale" and try to snatch a stray
  fortune.</p>

  <p>The two parties&mdash;our own and "the opposition"&mdash;took an
  undissembled interest in one another, and Mr. Giles conveyed his sentiments
  to me in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"Good-looking crowd, sir, aren't they? If that young lady is a fair sample
  of an American girl, I am going to emigrate if we lose the case."</p>

  <p>"And if you don't lose the case?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he replied, smilingly evading the question, "I shall be able
  to pay my lawyer, which will be pleasant for us both."</p>

  <p>Here my attention was diverted by what looked like a difference between
  Mr. Gimbler and his client. The solicitor appeared distinctly annoyed and I
  heard him say, almost angrily:</p>

  <p>"I do certainly object. It would be entirely out of order."</p>

  <p>"No doubt you are right, as a lawyer," was the calm reply; "but I am not a
  lawyer"; and, with this, he turned away from his legal adviser, and, to that
  gentleman's evident dismay, began to move across in our direction. As he was
  obviously bearing down on us with intent, we all, excepting Mrs. Engleheart,
  stood up, and I could hear Brodribb muttering under his breath.</p>

  <p>Having saluted us with a comprehensive bow, the stranger addressed himself
  to our old friend.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are Mr. Brodribb."</p>

  <p>"At your service, sir," was the reply, accompanied by a bow of such
  extreme stiffness that I seemed to hear him creak.</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Mr. Pippet, "that I am committing a gross breach of
  legal etiquette. But etiquette is made for man, especially for European man,
  and I am venturing to take an aboriginal view of the matter. Would it appear
  particularly shocking if I were to ask you to do me the honour of presenting
  me to your clients?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Brodribb, recovering himself somewhat, "that I should
  survive the shock, and my clients, I am sure, will be delighted to make your
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>With this he proceeded, with the air of a Gold-Stick-in-Waiting
  approaching a royal personage, to present the American to Mrs.
  Engleheart.</p>

  <p>"This is most kind of you, Mr. Pippet," the lady exclaimed with a gracious
  smile. "Mr. Brodribb is quite right. I am delighted to make your
  acquaintance, and so, I am sure, will my son be. May I introduce him?"</p>

  <p>Here Giles stepped forward and the two men shook hands heartily.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, sir, to make this friendly move," said he,
  "seeing that our presence here is not exactly helpful to you."</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Pippet, "that is just my point. All this talk of fights
  and battles and contests that I have been hearing from my solicitor makes me
  tired. I am not here to fight anybody, and neither, I take it, are you. There
  are certain matters of alleged fact that I am submitting for the
  consideration and judgment of the court. I don't know whether they are true
  or not. That is for the court to find out. My lawyers will argue that they
  are, and yours will argue that they are not. Let us leave it to them. There's
  no need for us to have any unfriendly feeling about it. Isn't that so, Mr.
  Brodribb?"</p>

  <p>"There is no reason," Brodribb replied cautiously, "why opposing litigants
  should not be personally friendly&mdash;without prejudice, of course. But you
  are not forgetting that these proceedings involve certain consequences. If
  the decision is in your favour, you obtain possession of a title of nobility
  and property of great value, which Mr. Engleheart thereby loses; and <i>vice
  versa."</i></p>

  <p>"Not quite <i>vice versa,</i> Mr. Brodribb," Mr. Pippet corrected. "The
  cases are not identical. If the court decides that my respected grandfather
  was not the Earl of Winsborough, Mr. Engleheart steps into the late Earl's
  shoes as soon as the death has been presumed, and I retire out of the
  picture. But, if it is decided that my grandfather was the Earl, then, as I
  have no male descendants, Mr. Engleheart has only to wait for those shoes
  until I step out of them."</p>

  <p>I could see that this statement made a considerable impression on both Mr.
  Brodribb and Mrs. Engleheart; and it did certainly ease the situation
  materially from their point of view. Brodribb, however, made no comment, and
  it fell to Mrs. Engleheart to make the acknowledgments.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Pippet," said she, "for letting us know the position. I
  won't pretend that I am not very much relieved to know that it is only a
  question of postponement for my son. But, whichever way the decision goes, I
  hope it will be a long time before a vacancy is declared in those shoes. But
  you haven't completed the introductions. Is that very charming girl your
  daughter?"</p>

  <p>"She is, Madam," was the reply. "My only child; and, with the exception of
  my sister, who is with her, my only kin in the world&mdash;unless it should
  transpire that I have the honour to be related to you and your son."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mrs. Engleheart, "if your kinsfolk are not very numerous, you
  have reason to be proud of them, as I dare say you are. Do you think they
  would care to know us?"</p>

  <p>"I have their assurance that they would like very much to make your
  acquaintance," Mr. Pippet replied; on which Mrs. Engleheart rose and was
  requesting to be taken to them when they were seen to be moving in our
  direction, apparently in response to some subtle telegraphic signals on the
  part of Mr. Pippet. As they approached, I looked them over critically and had
  to admit that their appearance was at least equal to their pretensions. The
  elder lady&mdash;like the late Queen Victoria&mdash;combined a markedly short
  stature with a most unmistakeable "presence," aided not a little by the
  strong, resolute face and a somewhat out-size Roman nose; while the younger
  was a tall, handsome girl, noticeably like her father and her aunt both in
  features and in the impression of dignity and character which she conveyed.
  And both ladies had that un-selfconscious ease of manner that is usually
  associated with the word "breeding."</p>

  <p>The introductions were necessarily hurried, for the time for the opening
  of the proceedings was drawing nigh. The clerk had taken his seat at his
  desk, the reporters were in their places, the ushers had taken up their
  posts, a few more spectators were drifting into the seats in the public
  gallery and the counsel had established themselves in their respective places
  and were now turning over the pages of their briefs&mdash;excepting Thorndyke
  and myself, who had no briefs but were present merely in a watching capacity.
  Mr. Pippet returned to the place where his solicitor sat glumly by the
  solicitor's table, but the two ladies remained with our party, Miss Pippet
  sitting by Mrs. Engleheart and the young lady (who, I gathered, bore the
  picturesque old English name of Jenifer) by Mr. Giles.</p>

  <p>They had hardly settled themselves when the judge entered and took his
  seat on the bench. Having laid some papers on his desk, he leaned back in his
  seat and ran his eye with undissembled interest over the parties to the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Now," Miss Jenifer remarked in a low tone to her companion, "we are going
  to hear whether we are cousins or only friends."</p>

  <p>"Or both," added Giles.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said she. "That was what I meant. But we mustn't talk. The
  play is going to begin; and that nice-looking old gentleman in that quaint
  wig has got his eye on us."</p>

  <p>Thereupon she subsided into silence, and Mr. McGonnell proceeded to open
  the case.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE OPENING OF THE CASE</h2>

  <p class="first">"THIS, my lord," said Mr. McGonnell, rising and turning an
  ingratiating eye on the bench, "is an application by Mr. Christopher Josiah
  Pippet, a citizen of the United States, for permission to presume the death
  of Percy Engleheart, sixth Earl of Winsborough, but there are certain
  peculiar and unusual features in the case. The application is opposed by the
  representatives of the Earl, who challenge the <i>locus standi</i> of the
  applicant on the ground that he is, as they allege, a stranger having no
  legitimate interest or concern in the estate of the said Earl. The applicant,
  on the other hand, affirms, and is prepared to prove, that he is the direct
  descendant of the fourth Earl of Winsborough, and that he is, in effect, the
  heir presumptive to the earldom and the settled estate.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly, the applicant petitions to be allowed to produce evidence of
  his title to the estate and to obtain a decision on that issue as an issue
  antecedent to the application for permission to presume death."</p>

  <p>The judge looked keenly at the counsel during the making of this statement
  and then he turned a slightly curious glance on Mr. Pippet and from him to
  his solicitor.</p>

  <p>"I must be perfectly clear," said he, "as to the scope of this further
  application. There appears to be a claim to a title and to the settled
  property associated with it. Now, I need not remind you that claims in
  respect of titles of honour lie within the jurisdiction of the House of Lords
  through a Committee of Privileges."</p>

  <p>"We realize that, my lord," said Mr. McGonnell.</p>

  <p>"But we are not seeking a final and conclusive decision in this court on
  the question whether the applicant, Christopher Pippet, is or is not entitled
  to succeed the present tenant, Earl Percy, but merely whether he has such an
  interest in the estate as will give him the <i>locus standi</i> necessary to
  entitle him to make an application to presume the death of the said Earl
  Percy."</p>

  <p>"That application," said the judge, "implies certain further proceedings,
  including, perhaps, a petition to the House of Lords."</p>

  <p>"That is so, my lord," counsel agreed. "But we are in a difficulty, and we
  ask your lordship to exercise a discretion in the matter of procedure. Our
  difficulty is this: There is reason to believe that Earl Percy is dead; but
  no direct evidence of his death exists. Consequently, he is, in a legal
  sense, a living person; and, since no one can be the heir of a living person,
  it is not possible for Mr. Pippet to initiate proceedings in the House of
  Lords. Before any such proceedings could become possible it would be
  necessary for the death of Earl Percy to be either proved or presumed.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, the applicant applies for the permission of the court to
  presume the death. But his right to make this application is contested on the
  grounds that I have mentioned. Thus he is in this dilemma: He cannot prove
  his claim until death is presumed, and he cannot apply for permission to
  presume death until he has proved his claim. But this dilemma, it is
  submitted, is contrary to the interests of justice; and we accordingly ask
  your lordship to hear such evidence as shall establish the applicant's
  position as a person having such an interest in the estate as renders him
  competent to make the application."</p>

  <p>"It is not perfectly clear," said the judge, "that the fact of his having
  this belief in his title to succeed does not constitute him an interested
  party to that extent. But we need not go into that, as the issue is not
  raised. What is the position of the Earl's representatives in regard to the
  heir presumptive?"</p>

  <p>"Our position, my lord," said Anstey, rising as the other counsel sat
  down, "is that the heir presumptive is Mr. Giles Engleheart, the only son of
  the late Charles Engleheart, Esquire, who was the Earl's first cousin. Apart
  from Mr. Pippet's claim, there is no doubt whatever about Mr. Engleheart's
  position. It is not contested. And I may say, if it is permissible, that we
  are in full agreement with what my learned friend has just said with regard
  to the applicant's claim. Since the question has been raised, we submit that
  it is desirable that the applicant be permitted to produce such evidence as
  may establish the existence or non-existence of a <i>prima facie</i> case. We
  agree with my learned friend that the present impasse is against the
  interests of justice."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the judge, "there ought certainly to be some escape from the
  dilemma which the learned counsel for the applicant has mentioned. The actual
  claim will, no doubt, have to be decided in another place; but there is no
  objection to such provisional proof as may be necessary for the purposes of
  the present application. I am therefore prepared to hear the evidence in
  support of the applicant's claim."</p>

  <p>He looked at Mr. McGonnell, who thereupon rose and proceeded to open the
  preliminary case, by a recital of the alleged facts in much the same terms as
  the sketch which I had heard from Mr. Brodribb, but in somewhat greater
  detail; and, as I listened, with my eyes on the judge's face, to the
  unfolding of that incredible and ridiculous story, I was once more astonished
  that anyone should have the confidence to tell it seriously in a court of
  law. How it impressed the judge it was impossible to tell. Judges, as a
  class, are not easily surprised, nor are they addicted to giving facial
  expression to their emotions; and the present specimen was a particularly
  wooden-faced old gentleman. All that I could gather from my observations of
  his countenance was that he appeared to be listening with close attention and
  placid interest.</p>

  <p>"That, my lord," said Mr. McGonnell, when he came to the end of the
  "story" with a description of the sham funeral, "is an outline of what are
  alleged to be the facts of the applicant's case; and it would be useless to
  deny that, taken at its face value, the whole story appears wildly
  incredible. If it rested only on the family tradition, no one would entertain
  it for a moment. But it does not rest only on that tradition. It is supported
  by a considerable body of evidence, including certain very significant
  entries in a diary kept by Josiah Pippet and certain facts relating to the
  Earl, George Augustus, who, it is claimed, was the <i>alter ego</i> of the
  said Josiah. Perhaps it will be well to glance at the latter first.</p>

  <p>"The thesis on which Mr. Christopher Pippet's claim is based is that the
  said Earl, George Augustus, was in the habit of leaving his mansion from time
  to time and going to 'The Fox and Grapes' Inn, where he assumed the name and
  style of Josiah Pippet and lived the life and carried out the activities of
  an inn-keeper. Now, it will naturally be asked, 'Is it credible that any man
  in the possession of his senses would conduct himself in this manner?' And
  the answer obviously is that it is not. But here the question arises, 'Was
  the said Earl in the possession of his senses?' And the answer to that is
  that, apparently, he was not. At any rate, his conduct in general was so
  strange, so unusual and erratic, that it would be difficult to name any
  eccentricity of which he might not have been capable. Let us see what manner
  of man this was.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, he appears to have been a man who had no fixed habits
  of life. He would live for months at his mansion, busying himself in certain
  works which we shall consider presently, and then, apparently without notice,
  he would disappear, leaving no clue to his whereabouts. He would stay away
  from home for months&mdash;in some cases for more than a year&mdash;and then
  would suddenly make his appearance at the mansion, unannounced and
  unexpected, giving no account of himself or his doings during his absence.
  And it is worth notice that his alleged double, Josiah Pippet, had similar
  peculiarities of behaviour. He also was in the habit of making mysterious
  disappearances and leaving no clue to his whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"Is it ascertained," the judge asked, "that the disappearances of the two
  men coincided in time?"</p>

  <p>"That is what is alleged, my lord," was the reply. "Naturally, after the
  many years that have elapsed, it is difficult to recover the dates as exactly
  as might be desired."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," his lordship agreed; "but the point is highly material."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord," counsel admitted. "Its importance has been fully
  realized and the point has been carefully examined. Such evidence as has been
  available goes to prove that the disappearances synchronized.</p>

  <p>"But these strange disappearances are not the only, or even the most
  striking evidences of the Earl's eccentricity. Still more suggestive of an
  unbalanced mind is the way in which he occupied himself in the intervals of
  those disappearances, when he was in residence at the mansion. Nothing in the
  traditional story which I have recited is more incredible than the history of
  his doings when he was at home. For then, it appears, he was in the habit of
  assembling an army of workmen, and, at enormous expense, employing them in
  carrying out works on the most gigantic scale and of the most preposterous
  character. In one part of his grounds, he set up an immense and lofty tower,
  with no ascertainable purpose except the view from the summit. From the base
  of this tower, a flight of steps was constructed leading down into the bowels
  of the earth, and communicating with a great range of subterranean passages
  of an aggregate length of close upon a mile. Connected with these passages
  were several large subterranean rooms, lighted from the surface by shafts and
  elaborately furnished. No reason is known for the construction of these
  rooms, though it appears that the Earl was accustomed, from time to time, to
  retire to them with a stock of provisions and pass a few days underground,
  hidden from the sight of men. These strange burrows and the great tower are
  still in existence and will be described in detail by a witness who, by the
  courtesy of the Earl's representatives, was enabled to make a thorough
  examination of them. But the slight description of them which I have given is
  sufficient to demonstrate that the Earl George Augustus was a man who, if not
  actually insane, was so strange and erratic in his behaviour that there is
  hardly any eccentricity of which he might not have been capable. The
  objection, therefore, to the traditional story, that it postulates an
  unbelievable degree of eccentricity in the Earl George Augustus, has no
  weight; since the said Earl did, in fact, give evidence of an unbelievable
  degree of eccentricity.</p>

  <p>"I will say no more on the subject of this strange man's personality,
  though further details of his peculiarities will be given in evidence. But,
  before finishing with him, it will be material to note the salient facts of
  his life. George Augustus, fourth Earl of Winsborough, was born on the 9th of
  August in the year 1794 and he died unmarried in 1871, aged 77. He had no
  brothers. He was succeeded by his cousin, Francis Engleheart, who died in
  1893 and was succeeded by his only son&mdash;and only child&mdash;then
  twenty-six years of age, the present Earl Percy.</p>

  <p>"We now pass to the alleged double of the Earl George Augustus, Josiah
  Pippet. Of his personal character we have less direct information, but, on
  the other hand, we have an invaluable and unimpeachable source of evidence in
  a diary which he kept for many years, and up to the date of his death. From
  this, we, at least, gather one highly suggestive fact; that he, like the
  Earl, was in the habit of disappearing at intervals from his home and from
  his usual places of resort, of staying away for months at a time, and on two
  occasions for over a year, and, so far as we are able to discover, leaving no
  clue as to the place to which he had gone or where he was living.</p>

  <p>"When I say that he left no clue to his whereabouts, I mean that he gave
  no information to his wife or family. Actually, the diary furnishes quite a
  considerable number of clues; and it is a very striking fact that these clues
  all refer to the same locality, and that the locality referred to happens to
  be the very one in which Winsborough Castle is situated. But not only is the
  locality referred to; there are actual references to the Castle itself, and
  in such terms as to leave no doubt that the writer was, at the time, in
  residence there. As the diary will be put in evidence, I need not occupy the
  time of the court with quotations at this stage, but will proceed to the few
  but important facts that are known respecting Josiah Pippet.</p>

  <p>"The first fact that I shall mention&mdash;and a very striking and
  suggestive fact it is&mdash;is that, although the date of Josiah's birth is
  known, no entry recording it appears in any known register. Exhaustive search
  has been made at Somerset House and elsewhere, but, so far as can be
  discovered, no record whatever exists of this man's birth. He seems to have
  dropped from the skies.</p>

  <p>"But, as I have said, the date of his birth is known, for it is stated
  with great exactness on the vault in which his coffin was deposited. Above
  the entrance to that vault is a marble tablet on which is carved this brief
  but significant inscription: 'JOSIAH PIPPET, died the 12th day of October
  1843, aged 49 years, 2 months and 3 days.'</p>

  <p>"Now here is a very exact, though rather roundabout statement, from which
  we can compute the very day of his birth. And what was that day? A simple
  calculation shows that it was the 9th of August 1794&mdash;the very same day
  on which George Augustus, Fourth Earl of Winsborough, was born!</p>

  <p>"If this is a coincidence, it is a most amazing one. The Earl and his
  alleged double were born on the same day. And not only that. The birth of the
  double is unrecorded. There is no evidence that it ever took place. Which is
  precisely what we might expect in the case of a double. The birth of the Earl
  duly appears in the register at Somerset House; and I submit that it is a
  reasonable inference that that entry records the birth, not only of George
  Augustus Engleheart, but also of Josiah Pippet. That those two men were, in
  fact, one and the same person; or, in other words, that Josiah Pippet was a
  purely imaginary and fictitious person.</p>

  <p>"But the mysterious circumstances connected with the birth of these two
  persons&mdash;or these two aspects of the same person&mdash;are repeated in
  connexion with their deaths. Just as only one of them is known, and can be
  proved, to have been born, so only one of them can be proved to have died. It
  is true that, in the case of Josiah, there was a funeral and a coffin which
  was solemnly interred. But there was a current belief that the funeral was a
  sham and that the coffin contained no human remains. And that belief is
  supported by the fact that there was no medical certificate. The death
  certificate was signed only by 'Walter Pippet, the son of the alleged
  deceased, as was possible in those days, before the passing of the Medical
  Act of 1858. There is nothing to show that the alleged deceased was attended
  by any medical practitioner or that there was anything to prevent the sham
  funeral from taking place with the collusion of the said Walter Pippet. The
  circumstances of the death, I repeat, like those of the birth, are fully
  compatible with the belief that there were not two persons at all, but only
  one person enacting two alternating parts. In other words, that Josiah Pippet
  was a mythical personage, like John Doe, created for a specific purpose.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, when we come to the matter of the applicant's ancestry and
  descent, we must treat the said Josiah as a real person, since he is the
  applicant's visible ancestor. And he has undeniably the qualities of a real
  person inasmuch as, in the character of Josiah Pippet, he married and had
  children. In the year 1822, in the church of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, he was
  married to Martha Bagshaw, spinster, he being then 28 years of age, and,
  according to the register, following the occupation of a ship's steward. The
  exact date at which he became landlord of the 'Fox and Grapes' is not
  certain, but he is so described in the register where the birth of his eldest
  child is recorded.</p>

  <p>"There were three children of this marriage; Walter, the eldest, born in
  1824, Frederick William, born in 1826 and Susan, born in 1832. Susan married
  and died in 1897. Walter carried on the 'Fox and Grapes' after his father's
  real or fictitious death, and died unmarried in 1865. Frederick William took
  to a sea-faring life and eventually settled, in the year 1853, at the age of
  27, in the United States, in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he
  began business by opening a small shop, which grew by degrees into a large
  and important department store. In 1868 he married Miss Elizabeth Watson, the
  daughter of a well-to-do merchant of Philadelphia, by whom he had two
  children, a son, Christopher Josiah, the present applicant, and a daughter
  Arminella. He lost his wife in 1891, and he died in 1905, leaving the bulk of
  his large fortune to his daughter and the residue together with the business
  to his son; who carried on the concern until 1921, when, having made a
  further considerable fortune, he sold out and retired. It was then that, for
  the first time, he began seriously to consider raising the claim to what he
  believes&mdash;justly, as I submit&mdash;to be his legitimate heritage.</p>

  <p>"Before proceeding to call witnesses, I venture, my lord, to recapitulate
  briefly the points of the case which favour the belief that Josiah Pippet and
  the Earl George Augustus, Fourth Earl of Winsborough, were one and the same
  person.</p>

  <p>"First, that the said Earl was a man of such wildly eccentric habits and
  conduct that he might credibly have behaved in the manner alleged.</p>

  <p>"That his habit of absenting himself from home for long periods and
  disappearing from his known places of resort, would have rendered the alleged
  impersonation easily possible.</p>

  <p>"That the man called Josiah Pippet was in the same way addicted to
  absences and disappearances.</p>

  <p>"That the said Josiah is reported to have claimed to be the Earl.</p>

  <p>"That, whereas both these persons were born on the same day, there is
  evidence of the birth of one only.</p>

  <p>"That, in like manner, there is evidence of the death of only one of them,
  the circumstances being such as to support the rumour which was current that
  the coffin which was interred contained no corpse.</p>

  <p>"Those, my lord, are the facts on which the applicant's claim is based;
  and I submit that if they can be proved&mdash;as they will be by the
  testimony of the witnesses whom I shall call&mdash;they constitute a case
  sufficiently convincing for the purpose of this application."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. McGonnell paused and inspected his brief while the judge shifted
  his position in his chair and the usher pronounced the name of Christopher
  Josiah Pippet. Thereupon Mr. Pippet moved across to the witness-box, and,
  having been sworn, gave his name and the usual particulars. Then his counsel
  proceeded to open the examination in chief.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; THE EVIDENCE OF CHRISTOPER J. PIPPET</h2>

  <p class="first">"CAN you remember, Mr. Pippet," the counsel asked, "when you
  first became aware that you were possibly the direct descendant of the Earl
  of Winsborough?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I cannot," was the reply. "It must have been when I was quite a
  small boy."</p>

  <p>"From whom did you receive the information?"</p>

  <p>"From my father, Frederick William Pippet."</p>

  <p>"Did he refer to the matter on more than one occasion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; on a great many occasions. It was rather a favourite subject with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Did you gather that he believed in the truth of the tradition?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't have to gather," replied the witness, with a dry smile. "He said
  in perfectly unmistakable terms that he regarded it as pure bunkum."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what reasons he had for taking that view?"</p>

  <p>"There were several reasons. In the first place, he didn't care a dime
  whether it was true or not. He was a prosperous American citizen, and that
  was good enough for him. But I think his beliefs were influenced by the
  character and personality of his father, Josiah Pippet. Josiah was a very
  peculiar man; very erratic in his behaviour, and, my father thought, not
  particularly reliable in his statements. Then he was an inveterate joker and
  much addicted to what is now called leg-pulling. I gathered that my father
  regarded the whole story as a leg-pull. But he did express surprise that
  Josiah should have kept the joke up so long and that so many people seemed to
  have been taken in by it."</p>

  <p>"What people was he referring to?"</p>

  <p>"The people who were connected with the 'Fox and Grapes' and those who
  frequented the place. He made a trip to England soon after the death of his
  brother Walter to see to the disposal of the family property. He had to go to
  the 'Fox and Grapes' to arrange about the sale of the good-will and effects;
  and there he found a general belief among the staff and the regular
  frequenters of the house that there was some mystery about Josiah. It was
  then, too, that he heard the rumour of the bogus funeral."</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you what, exactly, it was that the staff and the other people
  believed?"</p>

  <p>"A good deal of it seemed to be rather vague, though they all agreed that
  Josiah was not what he appeared to be&mdash;just an inn-keeper&mdash;but that
  he was a member of some noble house, masquerading as a publican for some
  unknown reasons. And they all appeared to believe that he was not really
  dead, but that he had arranged a sham funeral in order to bring the
  masquerade to an end without disclosing his real personality."</p>

  <p>"But apart from these vague rumours, was there anything more
  definite?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; there were some very definite statements, particularly those made by
  Walter's manager, who succeeded him. He professed to have been on terms of
  close intimacy with Josiah and to have received confidences from him which
  were made to no one else. Among these was the categorical statement that he,
  Josiah Pippet, was actually the Earl of Winsborough; that he had been born in
  the Castle at Winsborough and that he intended, if possible, to die there.
  And he, the manager, expressed himself as quite certain that Josiah was not
  dead, giving as his reason a number of reports which had reached him from
  time to time. One man, he stated, who was a frequenter of the 'Fox and
  Grapes,' had seen Josiah coming out of the town mansion in Cavendish Square
  and stepping into a carriage. Another customer, a Channel pilot, had met
  Josiah riding along the road across the sand-hills from Sandwich to Deal. He
  was perfectly certain that the man was Josiah Pippet, having often been
  served by him with liquor at the bar of the 'Fox and Grapes.' Another
  customer, who occasionally had business at Sandwich in Kent, happened to walk
  out from that town to Winsborough, and there he saw Josiah Pippet riding out
  of the main gate of the Castle grounds, followed by a mounted groom. He also
  was quite certain that the man he saw was really Josiah. And there were
  several other instances of persons who had seen Josiah since his alleged
  death which were mentioned by the manager, but my father could not remember
  the particulars."</p>

  <p>"And did not all these circumstantial statements make any impression on
  your father?"</p>

  <p>"No, none whatever. His opinion was that Josiah had amused himself by
  throwing out mysterious hints and that these had been repeated over and over
  again, growing with each repetition, until this story had taken definite
  shape."</p>

  <p>"And as to the reports that Josiah had actually been seen in the
  flesh?"</p>

  <p>"His explanation of that was that Josiah and the Earl were probably a good
  deal alike; and he suspected that Josiah's hints arose from that
  circumstance. He remarked that Josiah certainly came from that part of the
  country, and that he probably knew the Earl by sight."</p>

  <p>"You do not, I presume," said the counsel, slightly disconcerted, I
  thought, by the witness's tone, "take quite the same view as your
  father."</p>

  <p>"I am trying to keep an open mind," the witness replied, calmly, "but I am
  telling you what my father thought, if his opinions have any bearings on the
  case."</p>

  <p>"It is not clear that they have," said the judge. "We are, I believe,
  endeavouring to elicit facts."</p>

  <p>"I would submit, my lord," the counsel replied, "that they have this
  bearing; that the statements being those of an entirely unconvinced man, they
  may be assumed to be quite free from any suspicion of exaggeration. The
  speaker's bias was clearly against the truth of the reports and his testimony
  has, accordingly, an added value."</p>

  <p>The judge acknowledged this "submission" with a grave nod but made no
  further comment, and the counsel resumed his examination.</p>

  <p>"When your father used to speak to you about Josiah's story, did he give
  you any particulars as to what Josiah had told him?"</p>

  <p>"He did occasionally. But most of Josiah's talk on the subject took the
  form of vague boastings to the effect that his real station was very
  different from what it appeared. But now and again he let himself go with a
  straight statement. For instance, on one occasion he said quite definitely
  that Pippet was not his real name; that he had assumed it because it seemed
  to be a good name for an inn-keeper. I don't know what he meant by that."</p>

  <p>"He gave no hint as to what his real name was?"</p>

  <p>"No. The nearest approach to a disclosure of an identity other than that
  of Josiah Pippet was in his parting words to my father when the latter was
  starting on a long voyage a few months before Josiah's death. He then
  said&mdash;I am quoting my father as well as I can remember his
  words&mdash;'When you come back, you may not find me here. If you don't, you
  can look for me down at Winsborough, near Sandwich in Kent, and you will
  probably find me living at the Castle.' That was the last time that my father
  saw him."</p>

  <p>"You have referred to the alleged bogus funeral of your grandfather,
  Josiah Pippet, and to a dummy coffin weighted with lead. In the accounts
  which you received, was any mention made of the kind of lead
  used&mdash;whether, for instance, it was lead pipe, or bars, or lead
  pig?"</p>

  <p>"Most of the accounts referred simply to lead; but one&mdash;I forgot who
  gave it&mdash;mentioned a roll of roofing-lead and some plumber's oddments,
  left after some repairs. But I am not very clear about it. I can't quote any
  particular account."</p>

  <p>"Are there any other facts or statements known to you tending to prove
  that the man known as Josiah Pippet was in fact the Earl of Winsborough?"</p>

  <p>"No. I think you have got them all except those contained in the
  diary."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the counsel, "in that case, we will proceed to consider the
  entries in the diary which seem relevant." With this, he produced seven
  small, antique-looking, leather-bound volumes and passed them across to the
  witness.</p>

  <p>"What do you say these volumes are?" he asked. "To the best of my belief,"
  was the reply, "they are the diary kept by my grandfather, Josiah
  Pippet."</p>

  <p>"How did they come into your possession?"</p>

  <p>"They were among the effects of my late father, Frederick William Pippet.
  They were obtained by him, as he informed me, when he was disposing of the
  effects of his deceased brother, Walter. He found them in a deed box with a
  large number of letters, the whole being tied together and docketed 'Diary
  and letters of Josiah Pippet, deceased.' As the surviving son, he took
  possession of them and the letters."</p>

  <p>"You have no doubt that these volumes are the authentic diary of Josiah
  Pippet?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have not. His name is written in each volume and my father always
  referred to them as his father's diary, and I have no reason to doubt that
  that is what they are."</p>

  <p>"Are they, in all respects, in the same condition as when they came into
  your possession?"</p>

  <p>"They were up to the time that I handed them to my solicitor, and I have
  no doubt that they are still. They were always kept in the deed box in which
  my father found them, together with the letters. I handed the whole
  collection in the deed box to my solicitor for him to examine."</p>

  <p>"Would it be correct to say that it was the study of this diary that led
  you seriously to entertain the possibility that Josiah Pippet was really the
  Earl of Winsborough?"</p>

  <p>"It would&mdash;with the proviso that the studying was not done by me. It
  was my sister who used to study the diary, and she communicated her
  discoveries to me."</p>

  <p>"Since you have been in England, have you made any attempts to check the
  accuracy of the entries in the diary?"</p>

  <p>"I have, in the few cases in which it has been possible after all these
  years."</p>

  <p>"There is an entry dated the 3rd of September, 1839: 'Home on the brig
  <i>Harmony.</i> Got aground on the Dyke, but off next tide.' Have you been
  able to check that? As to the locality, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I find that the Dyke is the name of a shoal by the side of a
  navigation channel called The Old Cudd Channel, leading to Ramsgate Harbour.
  I find that it is used almost exclusively by vessels entering or leaving
  Ramsgate Harbour or Sandwich Haven. At Sandwich I was allowed to examine the
  old books kept by the Port authorities, and, in the register of shipping
  using the port I found, under the date 1st September, 1839, a note that the
  brig <i>Harmony</i> sailed out of the Haven in ballast, bound for
  London."</p>

  <p>"What significance do you attach to that entry?"</p>

  <p>"As Sandwich is only a mile and a half from Winsborough, and is the
  nearest port, the fact of his embarking there is consistent with the
  supposition that Winsborough was the place in which he had been staying."</p>

  <p>"There is a previous entry dated the 12th of June, 1837: 'Broached an
  anker of prime Dutch gin that I bought from the skipper of the
  <i>Vriendschap</i>.'"</p>

  <p>"I checked that at the same time in the same register. There was an entry
  relating to a Dutch galliot named the <i>Vriendschap</i> which discharged a
  general cargo, including a quantity of gin. She arrived at Sandwich on the
  10th of April and cleared outward on the 25th of the same month. At that
  time, the diary shows that Josiah was absent from home."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything to show where he was at that time?"</p>

  <p>"There is an entry made just after he arrived home. I am not sure of the
  date."</p>

  <p>"Are you referring to the entry of the 6th of May, 1837: 'Home again. Feel
  a little strange after the life at the Castle'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Taking the two entries together, it seems clear that the castle
  referred to was Winsborough Castle and that he was in residence there."</p>

  <p>"I will take only one more passage from the diary&mdash;that of the 8th of
  October, 1842: 'Back to the Fox. Exit G. A. and enter J. P., but not for
  long.' What does that convey to you?"</p>

  <p>"The meaning of it seems to me to be obvious. The initials are those of
  the Earl, George Augustus, and himself, Josiah Pippet. It appears plainly to
  indicate that George Augustus now retires from the stage and gives place to
  Josiah Pippet. And, as the entry was made within ten months of his alleged
  death, or final disappearance, the expression, 'not for long,' seems to refer
  to that final disappearance."</p>

  <p>On receiving this answer, counsel paused and glanced over his brief.
  Apparently finding no further matter for examination, he said: "I need not
  ask you anything about the passages from the diary which I quoted in my
  opening address. The diary is put in evidence and the passages speak for
  themselves."</p>

  <p>With this he sat down and Anstey rose to cross-examine.</p>

  <p>"You have told us, Mr. Pippet," he began, "that you were led to entertain
  the belief in the dual personality of your grandfather, Josiah Pippet, by
  your study of certain passages in his diary."</p>

  <p>"Not my study," was the reply. "I said that my sister studied the diary
  and communicated her discoveries to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Now, which of these passages was it that first led you to abandon
  the scepticism which, I understand, you formerly felt in regard to the story
  of the double life and the sham funeral?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot remember distinctly, but my impression is that my sister was
  strongly influenced by those passages which imply, or definitely state that
  Josiah, when absent from his London home, was living at the Castle."</p>

  <p>"But what caused you to identify 'the Castle' as Winsborough Castle? There
  is nothing in the diary to indicate any castle in particular. The words used
  are simply 'The Castle.' How did you come to decide that, of all the castles
  in England, the reference was to this particular castle?"</p>

  <p>"I take it that we were influenced by what we had both heard from our
  father. The stories that he had been told referred explicitly to Winsborough
  Castle. And the inquiries which I have made since I have been in
  England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," interrupted Anstey, "but those inquiries are not relevant to
  my question. We are speaking of your study of the diary when you were at your
  home in America. I suggest that you then had very little knowledge of the
  geography of the county of Kent."</p>

  <p>"We had practically none."</p>

  <p>"Then I suggest that, apart from what you had heard from your father,
  there was nothing to indicate that the words, 'The Castle,' referred to
  Winsborough Castle."</p>

  <p>"That is so. We applied what my father had told us to the entries in the
  diary."</p>

  <p>"Then, since the connexion was simply guess-work, is it not rather
  singular that the mere reference to The Castle should have made so deep an
  impression on you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," the witness replied, with a faint smile, "my sister may have
  been prepared to be impressed, and may have communicated her enthusiasm to
  me."</p>

  <p>To this answer Anstey made no rejoinder, but, after a short pause and a
  glance at his brief, resumed:</p>

  <p>"There is this entry of the 8th of October, 1842: 'Back to the Fox. Exit
  G. A. and enter J. P., but not for long.' Did that passage influence you
  strongly in your opinion of the truth of the story of Josiah's double
  life?"</p>

  <p>The witness did not answer immediately, and it seemed to me that he looked
  a little worried. At length he replied:</p>

  <p>"It is a remarkable fact, but I have no recollection of our ever having
  discussed that entry. It would almost seem as if my sister had overlooked
  it."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember when your attention was first drawn to that entry?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was at a consultation with my solicitor, Mr. Gimbler, when he
  showed me a number of passages which he had extracted from the diary; which
  he considered relevant to the case, and which he wished me to try to verify
  if possible."</p>

  <p>"Have you, since then, discussed this passage with your sister?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and she is as much surprised as I am that it did not attract her
  attention when she was reading the diary."</p>

  <p>"So far as you know, did she read the entire diary?"</p>

  <p>"I understood that she read the whole seven volumes from cover to
  cover."</p>

  <p>"Has she ever made a definite statement to you to that effect?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A short time ago, I put the question to her explicitly and she
  assured me that, to the best of her belief, she had read every word of the
  diary."</p>

  <p>"And you say that she had no recollection of having noticed this
  particular entry?"</p>

  <p>"That is what she told me."</p>

  <p>Here the judge interposed with a question.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand why we are taking this hearsay testimony from the
  witness as to what his sister read or noticed. Is not the lady in court?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord," replied Anstey; "but I understand that it is not proposed
  to call Miss Pippet."</p>

  <p>The judge turned and looked inquiringly at Mr. McGonnell, who rose and
  explained:</p>

  <p>"It was not considered necessary to call Miss Pippet as she is not in
  possession of any facts other than those known to her brother."</p>

  <p>With this he sat down. But, for some seconds, the judge continued to look
  at him fixedly as if about to ask some further question, a circumstance that
  seemed to occasion the learned counsel some discomfort. But, if his lordship
  had intended to make any further observations, he thought better of it, for
  he suddenly turned away, and, leaning back in his chair, glanced at Anstey;
  who thereupon resumed his cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Pippet," said he, taking up the last volume of the diary (the
  seven volumes had been passed to him at the conclusion of the examination in
  chief) and opening it at a place near the end, "I will ask you to look at
  this entry, dated the 8th of October, 1842." (Here the open book was passed
  across to the witness.) "You will see that there is a blank space between the
  last entry made before the writer went away from home and this, the first
  entry made after his return. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"It is," replied Mr. Pippet.</p>

  <p>"And does it not appear to you that this entry is in a very conspicuous
  position&mdash;in a position likely to catch the eye of any person glancing
  over the page?"</p>

  <p>"It does," the witness agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then I put it to you, Mr. Pippet: Here is a diary which is being searched
  by an intelligent and attentive reader for corroboration of the story of
  Josiah's alleged double life. Here is an entry which seems to afford such
  corroboration. It is in a conspicuous position, and not only that; for, being
  the first entry after Josiah's return from his mysterious absence, it is in
  the very position in which an intelligent searcher would expect to find it.
  Now, I ask you, is it not an astounding and almost incredible circumstance
  that this entry should have been overlooked?"</p>

  <p>"I have already said so," Mr. Pippet replied, a little wearily, delivering
  the open diary to the usher, who handed it up to the judge. There was a short
  pause while Anstey turned over the leaves of his brief and the judge examined
  the diary; which he did with undissembled interest and at considerable
  length. When he had finished with it, he returned it to the usher, who
  brought it over to Anstey, by whom it was forthwith delivered into the hands
  of Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>I watched my colleague's proceedings with grim amusement. If, in Anstey's
  cross-examination, certain hints were to be read between the lines, there was
  no such reticence on Thorndyke's part. Openly and undisguisedly, he
  scrutinized the entry in the diary, with the naked eye, with his pocket-lens,
  and finally with a queer little squat, double-barrelled microscope which he
  produced from a case at his side. Nor was I the only observer. The proceeding
  was watched by his lordship, with a sphinx-like face but a twinkling eye, by
  the two opposing counsel, and especially Mr. Gimbler, who seemed to view it
  with considerable disfavour. But my attention was diverted from Thorndyke's
  activities by Anstey, who now resumed his cross examination.</p>

  <p>"You have referred to the alleged bogus funeral of your grandfather,
  Josiah Pippet, and to a dummy coffin weighted with lead. Now, so far as you
  know, is that coffin still in existence?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that it is. I visited the cemetery, which is at a place
  near Stratford in the east end of London, and examined the vault from the
  outside. It appeared to be quite intact."</p>

  <p>"Is the cemetery still in use?"</p>

  <p>"No. It was closed many years ago by Act of Parliament and is now disused
  and deserted."</p>

  <p>"Had you any difficulty in obtaining admission?"</p>

  <p>The witness smiled. "I can hardly say that I was admitted," said he. "The
  place was locked up and there was nobody in charge; but the wall was only
  about six feet high. I had no difficulty in getting over."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Anstey, "we may assume that the coffin is still there. And if
  it is, it contains either the body of Josiah Pippet or a roll of sheet lead
  and some plumber's oddments. Has it never occurred to you that it would be
  desirable to examine that coffin and see what it does contain?"</p>

  <p>"It has," the witness replied, emphatically. "When I came to England, my
  intention was to get that coffin open right away and see whether Josiah was
  in it or not. If I had found him there, I should have known that my father
  was right and that the story was all bunk; and if I had found the lead, I
  should have known that there was something solid to go on."</p>

  <p>"What made you abandon that intention?"</p>

  <p>"I was advised that, in England, it is impossible to open a coffin without
  a special faculty from the Home Secretary, and that no such faculty would be
  granted until the case had been heard in a court of law."</p>

  <p>"Then we may take it that it was your desire to have this coffin examined
  as to its contents?"</p>

  <p>"It was, and is," the witness replied, energetically. "I want to get at
  the truth of this business; and it seems to me, being ignorant of law, that
  it is against common sense to spend all this time arguing and inferring when
  a few turns of a screw-driver would settle the whole question in a matter of
  minutes."</p>

  <p>The judge smiled approvingly. "A very sensible view," said he; "and not
  such particularly bad law."</p>

  <p>"So far as you know, Mr. Pippet," said Anstey, "have any measures been
  taken to obtain authority to open the vault and examine the coffin?"</p>

  <p>"I am not aware of any. I understood that, until the court had given some
  decision on the case, any such measures would be premature."</p>

  <p>"Are you aware that it is within the competency of this court to make an
  order for the exhumation of this coffin and its examination as to its
  contents?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly was not," the witness answered.</p>

  <p>Here the judge interposed with some signs of impatience.</p>

  <p>"It seems necessary that this point should be cleared up. We are trying a
  case involving a number of issues, all of which are subject to one main
  issue. That issue is: Did Josiah Pippet die in the year 1843 and was he
  buried in a normal manner? Or was his alleged death a fictitious death and
  the funeral a sham funeral conducted with a dummy coffin weighted with lead?
  Now, as Mr. Pippet has most reasonably remarked, it seems a strange thing
  that we should be listening to a mass of evidence of the most indirect
  kind&mdash;principally hearsay evidence at third or fourth hand&mdash;when we
  actually have within our grasp the means of settling this issue conclusively
  by evidence of the most direct and convincing character. Has the learned
  counsel for the applicant any instructions on this point?"</p>

  <p>While the judge had been speaking, a hurried and anxious consultation had
  been taking place between Mr. Gimbler and his leading counsel. The latter now
  rose and replied:</p>

  <p>"It was considered, my lord, that, as these proceedings were, in a sense,
  preliminary to certain other proceedings possibly to be taken in another
  place, it might be desirable to postpone the question of the exhumation,
  especially as it seemed doubtful whether your lordship would be willing to
  make the necessary order."</p>

  <p>"That," said the judge, "could have been ascertained by making the
  application; and I may say that I should certainly have complied with the
  request."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case," said Mr. McGonnell, "we gratefully adopt your
  lordship's suggestion and make the application now."</p>

  <p>"Very well," the judge rejoined, "then the order will be made, subject to
  the consent of the Home Secretary, which we may assume will be given."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, he glanced at Anstey, but, as the latter remained seated,
  and no re-examination followed, Mr. Pippet was released from the
  witness-box.</p>

  <p>Of the rest of the evidence I have but a dim recollection. The sudden
  entry, like a whiff of fresh air, into this fog of surmise and rumour, of a
  promise of real, undeniable evidence, made the testimony of the remaining
  witnesses appear like mere trifling. There was an architect and surveyor who
  described and produced plans of the old Earl's underground chambers; and
  there was an aged woman whose grandfather had been a potman at the "Fox and
  Grapes" and who gave a vague account of the strange rumours of which she had
  heard him speak. But it was all very shadowy and unreal. It merely left us
  speculating as to whether the story of the bogus funeral might or might not
  possibly be true. And the speculation was not worth while when we should
  presently be looking into the open coffin and able to settle the question
  definitely, yes or no.</p>

  <p>I think everyone was relieved when the sitting came to an end and the
  further hearing was adjourned until the result of the exhumation should be
  made known.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; JOSIAH?</h2>

  <p class="first">THE last resting-place&mdash;real or fictitious&mdash;of the
  late Josiah Pippet was a somewhat dismal spot. Not that it mattered. The
  landscape qualities of a burial ground cannot be of much concern to the
  inmates. And in Josiah's day, when he came here prospecting for an eligible
  freehold, the aspect of the place was doubtless very different. Then it must
  have been a rural burial ground adjoining some vanished hamlet (it was
  designated on the Ordnance map "Garwell Burial Ground") hard by the Romford
  Turnpike Road. Now, it was a little grimy wilderness, fronting on a narrow
  street, flanked by decaying stable-yards and cart sheds, and apparently
  utterly neglected and forgotten of men. The only means of access was a rusty
  iron gate, set in the six-foot enclosing wall, and at that gate Thorndyke and
  I arrived a full half-hour before the appointed time, having walked thither
  from the nearest station&mdash;Maryland Point on the Great Eastern. But early
  as we were, we were not early enough from Thorndyke's point of view; for, not
  only did we find the rusty gate unlocked (with a brand-new key sticking out
  of the corroded lock), but, when we lifted the decayed latch and entered, we
  discovered two men in the very act of wrenching open the door of a vault.</p>

  <p>"This," said Thorndyke, regarding the two men with a disapproving eye,
  "ought not to have been done until everyone was present and the unopened door
  had been inspected."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, consolingly, "it will save time."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," he admitted. "But that is not what we are here for." We
  approached the operators, one of whom appeared to be a locksmith and the
  other an official of some kind, to whom, at his request, we gave our names
  and explained our business.</p>

  <p>"I expect," said Thorndyke, "you had your work cut out, getting that door
  unlocked."</p>

  <p>"It was a bit of a job, sir," the locksmith replied. "Locks is like men.
  Gets a bit stiff in the joints after eighty years. But it wasn't as bad as
  I'd expected. I'd got a good strong skeleton key filed up and a tommy to turn
  it with; and when I'd run in a drop of paraffin and oil, she twisted round
  all right."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, I looked around me. The burial ground was roughly
  square in shape, enclosed on three sides by a six-foot brick wall, while the
  fourth side was occupied by a range of the so-called vaults; which were not,
  strictly speaking, vaults at all, but sepulchral chambers above ground. There
  were six of them, each provided with its own door, and over each door was a
  stone tablet on which was inscribed brief particulars of the inmates. Josiah
  alone had a chamber all to himself, and, running my eye along the row of
  tablets and reading the dates, I noted that he appeared to be the last of the
  tenants. At this moment, the sound of a motor car in the street outside
  caused us to step back to bring the gate within view; when, to my
  surprise&mdash;but not, apparently, to Thorndyke's&mdash;our old friend, Mr.
  Superintendent Miller, was seen entering. As he approached and greeted us, I
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Miller. What brings you here? I didn't
  know that the police were interested in this case."</p>

  <p>"They are not," he replied. "I am here on instructions from the Home
  Office just to see that the formalities are complied with. That is all. But
  it is a quaint business. What are we going to find in that coffin,
  Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "is an open question, at present."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Miller. "But I expect you have considered the
  probabilities. What do you say? Bones or lead?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as a mere estimate of probabilities," replied Thorndyke, "I should
  say lead."</p>

  <p>"Should you really!" I exclaimed in astonishment. "I would have wagered
  fifty to one on a body. The whole story of the bogus funeral sounded to me
  like 'sheer bunk,' as Pippet would express it."</p>

  <p>"That would certainly have been my view," said Miller, "but I expect we
  are both wrong. We usually are when we disagree with the Doctor. And there
  does seem to be a hint of something queer about that inscription. 'Josiah
  Pippet, died on the 12th day of October, 1843, aged 49 years, 2 months and 3
  days.' If he was so blooming particular to a day, why couldn't he have just
  given the date of his birth and have done with it?"</p>

  <p>While we had been talking, the official and his assistant had produced two
  pairs of coffin trestles, which they set up side by side opposite the open
  door of the vault; and they had hardly been placed in position when the sound
  of two cars drawing up almost at the same moment announced the arrival of the
  rest of the party.</p>

  <p>"My eye!" exclaimed Miller, as the visitors filed in and the
  official&mdash;beadle, or whatever he was&mdash;advanced to meet them and
  lock the gate after them; "it's a regular congregation."</p>

  <p>It did look a large party. First there was Mr. Pippet with his sister and
  daughter and his solicitor and Mr. McGonnell; and then followed Mrs.
  Engleheart and her son with Mr. Brodribb. But, once inside the burial ground,
  the two groups tended to coalesce while mutual greetings were exchanged, and
  then to sort themselves out. The two elder ladies decided to wait at a
  distance while "the horrid business" was in progress, and the rest of us
  gathered round the half-open door, the two young people drawing together and
  seeming, as I thought, to be on uncommonly amicable terms.</p>

  <p>"I leave the conduct of this affair in your hands, Thorndyke," said Mr.
  Brodribb, casting a wistful glance at the two ladies, who had retired to the
  farther side of the enclosure. "Is there anything that you want to do before
  the coffin is removed?"</p>

  <p>"I should like, as a mere formality, to inspect the interior of the
  vault," was the reply; "and perhaps the Superintendent, as a disinterested
  witness, might also take a glance at it."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he looked inquiringly at Mr. Gimbler, and the latter,
  accepting the suggestion, advanced with him and Miller and threw the door
  wide open. There was nothing very sensational to see. The little chamber was
  crossed by a thick stone shelf on which rested the coffin. The latter had a
  very unattractive appearance, the dark, damp oak&mdash;from which every
  vestige of varnish had disappeared&mdash;being covered with patches of thick,
  green mildew and greasy-looking stains, over which was a mantle of impalpably
  fine grey dust. A layer of similar dust covered the shelf, the floor and
  every horizontal surface, but nowhere was there the faintest sign of its
  having been disturbed. On coffin and shelf and floor it presented a perfectly
  smooth, unbroken surface.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," said Miller, when he had cast a quick, searching glance
  round the chamber, "are you satisfied? Looks all right."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "But we will just take a sample or two of the
  dust for reference, if necessary."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he produced from his pockets a penknife and two of the
  inevitable seed-envelopes which he always carried about him. With the former
  he scraped up a little heap of dust on the coffin lid and shovelled it into
  one envelope, and then took another sample from the shelf; a proceeding which
  was observed with a sour smile by Mr Gimber and with delighted amusement by
  the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Nothing left to chance, you notice," chuckled the latter. "Thomas a
  Didymus was a credulous man compared with the Doctor. Shall we have the
  coffin out now?"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke assented, the beadle and his assistant approached and drew
  the coffin forward on the shelf. Then they lifted the projecting end, but
  forthwith set it down again and stood gazing at it blankly.</p>

  <p>"Moses!" exclaimed the locksmith. "He don't seem to have lost much weight
  in eighty years! This is a four-man job."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, Miller and I stepped forward, and, as the two men lifted the
  foot end of the coffin, we took the weight of the other end; and as we
  staggered to the trestles with our ponderous burden, Miller whispered to
  me:</p>

  <p>"What's the betting now, Dr. Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"There may be a lead shell," I suggested, but without much conviction.
  However, there was no use in speculating, seeing that the locksmith had
  already produced a screw-driver from his tool-bag and was preparing to set to
  work. As he began, I watched him with some interest, expecting that the screw
  would be rusted in immovably. But he was a skilful workman and managed the
  extraction with very little difficulty, though the screw, when at last he got
  it out and laid it on the coffin lid, was thickly encrusted with rust.
  Thorndyke picked it up, and, having looked it over, handed it to Miller with
  the whispered injunction:</p>

  <p>"Take charge of the screws, Miller. They may have to be put in
  evidence."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent made no comment, though I could see that he was a
  little puzzled; as also was I, for there appeared to be nothing unusual or
  significant in the appearance of the screw. And I think the transaction was
  observed&mdash;with some disfavour&mdash;by Mr. Gimbler, though he took no
  notice, but kept a watchful and suspicious eye on Thorndyke; who, during the
  extraction of the other screws, occupied himself with an exhaustive
  examination of the exterior of the coffin, including the blackened brass
  name-plate (the fastening-screws of which he inspected through a lens) and
  the brass handles and their fastenings.</p>

  <p>At length the last of the eight screws was extracted&mdash;and pocketed by
  Miller&mdash;and the locksmith, inserting his screw-driver between the lid
  and the side, looked round as if waiting for the word. We all gathered round,
  making space, however, for Mr. Pippet, his daughter and Mr. Giles.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Mr. Pippet, "we are going to get the answer to the riddle. Up
  with her."</p>

  <p>The locksmith gave a single wrench and the lid rose. He lifted it clear
  and laid it on the other trestles, and we all craned forward and peered into
  the coffin. And then, at the first glance, we had the answer. For what we saw
  was an untidy bundle of mouldy sacking. We could not see what the bundle
  contained; but it certainly did not contain the late Josiah Pippet.</p>

  <p>The excitement now reached its climax and found expression in low-toned,
  inarticulate murmurs, in the midst of which Mr. Pippet's calm, matter-of-fact
  voice was heard directing the locksmith to "get that bundle open and let's
  see what's inside." Accordingly, with much tugging at the unsavoury sacking,
  the bundle was laid open and its contents exposed to the light of day&mdash;a
  small roll of whitened sheet lead and four hemispherical lumps of the same
  metal, apparently the remainders from a plumber's melting-pot.</p>

  <p>For some moments there was a complete silence as nine pairs of fascinated
  eyes remained riveted on the objects that reposed on the bottom of the
  coffin. It was broken, not quite harmoniously, by the voice of Mr.
  Gimbler.</p>

  <p>"A roll of sheet lead and some plumber's oddments."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he turned, with a fat, wrinkly and rather offensive smile to
  Mr. Giles Engleheart.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the latter agreed, "it fits the description to a T." He held out
  his hand to Mr. Pippet and continued: "It's heads up for you, sir. I
  congratulate you on a fair win, and I wish you a long life to enjoy what you
  have won."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Giles," said Mr. Pippet, shaking his hand warmly. "I am glad
  to have your congratulations first&mdash;even if they should turn out
  premature. We mustn't be too previous, you know."</p>

  <p>He spoke in a singularly calm, unemotional tone, without a trace of
  triumph or even satisfaction. Indeed, I could not but be impressed (and
  considerably surprised) by the total absence of any sign of elation on the
  part either of the claimant or his daughter. It might have been simply good
  manners and regard for the defeated rival. But it looked uncommonly like
  indifference. Moreover, I could not but notice that, in the midst of the
  congratulations, Mr. Pippet was keeping an attentive eye on Thorndyke; and,
  indeed, my colleague's proceedings soon began to attract more general
  notice.</p>

  <p>When the leaden objects were first disclosed, he had viewed them
  impassively with what had almost looked like a glance of recognition. They
  were, in fact, as I knew, exactly what he had expected to see. But after a
  general, searching glance, he proceeded to a closer inspection. First, he
  lifted out the roll of sheet lead, and, having looked it over, critically,
  laid it on the coffin-lid. Then he turned his attention to the "oddments," of
  which there was one appreciably larger than the other three, having
  apparently come from a bigger melting-pot. This mass, which looked like the
  half of a metallic Dutch cheese, he lifted out first, and, in spite of its
  great weight, he seemed to handle it without any difficulty as he turned it
  about to examine its various parts. When he had inspected it all over, he
  laid it on the coffin-lid beside the roll of sheet lead, and then, dipping
  into the coffin once more, took up one of the smaller "remainders."</p>

  <p>And it was at this moment that I became aware that "something had
  happened." How I knew it, I can hardly say, for Thorndyke was a perfectly
  impossible subject for a thought-reader. But my long association with him
  enabled me to detect subtle shades of expression that were perceptible to no
  one else. And something of the kind I had seen now. As he lifted the lump of
  lead, he had checked for a moment and seemed to stiffen, and a sudden
  intensity of attention had flashed into his eyes, to vanish in an instant,
  leaving his face as immobile and impassive as a mask of stone.</p>

  <p>What could it be? I could only watch and wait for developments. As he
  turned the mass of lead over in his hands and pored over every inch of its
  surface, I caught the twinkling eye of Superintendent Miller and a low
  chuckle of appreciative amusement.</p>

  <p>"Nothing taken for granted, you observe," he murmured.</p>

  <p>But the others were less indulgent. As Thorndyke laid the last of the
  leaden pot-leavings on the coffin-lid, Mr. McGonnell interposed, a little
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything more, Dr. Thorndyke? Because, if not, as we seem to
  have done what we came here to do, I suggest that we may consider the
  business as finished."</p>

  <p>"That is," said Mr. Pippet, "if Dr. Thorndyke is satisfied. Are you
  satisfied, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "I am not satisfied with this lead. It purports
  to have been placed here in 1843, and part of it&mdash;the sheet
  lead&mdash;was then old. It was said to have been old roofing-sheet. Now, I
  am not satisfied that this lead is of that age. This sheet lead looks to me
  like modern milled lead."</p>

  <p>"And how do you propose to settle that question?" McGonnell asked.</p>

  <p>"I propose that an assay of the lead should be made to determine, if
  possible, its age."</p>

  <p>McGonnell snorted. "This is Thomas Didymus, with a vengeance," he
  exclaimed. "But I submit that it is mere hair-splitting; and I don't believe
  that any assayist could give an opinion as to the age of the lead, or that
  the court would pay any attention to him if he did. What do you say,
  Gimbler?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler smiled his queer, fat, wrinkly smile, to the entire extinction
  of his little blue eyes, and swung his eye-glasses on their ribbon like a
  pendulum.</p>

  <p>"I say," he replied, oracularly, "that the proposal is inadmissible for
  several reasons. First, the objection is frivolous. We came here to find out
  whether this coffin contained a body or some lumps of lead. We find that it
  contained lead. Now Dr. Thorndyke doubts whether it is the original lead. He
  thinks it may be some other lead of a later vintage. But if it is, how came
  it here? What does he suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing," said Thorndyke. "My function in this case is the
  purely scientific one of ascertaining facts."</p>

  <p>"Still," persisted Gimbler, "there is a suggestion implied in the
  objection. But I let that pass. Next, I assert that an assay would not
  produce any evidence that the court would take seriously. The proposed
  proceeding is merely vexatious and obstructive. It would occasion delay and
  increase the costs to no useful purpose. And, finally, the order of the court
  does not authorize us to make an assay of the lead. It merely authorizes us
  to open the coffin and ascertain whether it contains a body. We have done
  that and we find that it does not contain a body."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Brodribb, who had been showing signs of increasing discomfort,
  intervened in the discussion.</p>

  <p>"I am inclined, Thorndyke," said he, "to agree with Mr. Gimbler. Your
  proposal to make an assay of the lead does seem to go beyond the powers
  conferred by the judge's order. Of course, if it is necessary, we could make
  a special application. But is it necessary? Do you say definitely that this
  lead is not of the age that it is assumed to be?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke, "I do not. I merely say that I am not satisfied
  that it is."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, "I suggest that we waive the question of the assay,
  at least for the present. I should much prefer to do so, especially as there
  is no denying that your proposal does imply certain suggestions which should
  not be lightly made."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments, and I waited curiously for his
  decision. Finally, he rejoined:</p>

  <p>"Very well, Brodribb; I will not press the matter against your sense of
  the legal proprieties. We will waive the assay&mdash;at any rate, for the
  present."</p>

  <p>"I think you are wise," said McGonnell. "It would have seemed an
  extravagant piece of scepticism and couldn't have led to any result. And
  now," he added, looking anxiously at his watch, "I suppose we have finished
  our business. I hope so. Have we got to see to the re-placing of the
  coffin?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied Miller. "That is my business, as official master of the
  ceremonies. There is nothing to detain you."</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness for that," said McGonnell, and began, forthwith, to move
  towards the gate, while Mr. Pippet, the two solicitors and the two young
  people advanced up the path to meet the two elder ladies and give them the
  latest news of the discoveries. Then the beadle unlocked the gate, and, as
  the procession moved towards it, we joined the party to exchange polite
  greetings and see them into their cars (in which the opposing litigants got
  mixed up in the most singular and amicable manner).</p>

  <p>"Can I give you two a lift?" inquired Brodribb, as he held the door of his
  car open.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," replied Thorndyke. "We have a little business to transact
  with Miller."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Brodribb wriggled, with some difficulty into his car; and we
  re-entered the gate, which the beadle locked after us, and rejoined the
  Superintendent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; PLUMBER'S ODDMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Thorndyke and I returned from the gate, the
  Superintendent met us with a peculiarly knowing expression on his
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," said he, "what about it?" And, as this slightly ambiguous
  question elicited no reply beyond an indulgent smile, he continued: "When I
  hear a gentleman of your intellect propose to assay a lump of old lead to
  ascertain the exact vintage year, experience tells me that that gentleman has
  got something up his sleeve. Now, Doctor, let's hear what it is."</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Miller," Thorndyke replied, "I don't quite know,
  myself. But you are wrong about the lead. The age of a piece of lead can be
  judged fairly accurately by the silver content. If you find a piece of sheet
  lead with a silver content of, say, ten ounces to the ton, you can be pretty
  sure that it was made before Pattinson's process for the desilverization of
  lead was invented. Still, you are right to the extent that the question of
  age was not the only issue that I had in my mind. There were other reasons
  why the assay should be made."</p>

  <p>"But you have abandoned the assay," objected Miller, "and very surprised I
  was to hear you give way so easily."</p>

  <p>"I gave way in your favour," said Thorndyke, with a cryptic smile.
  <i>"You</i> are going to have the assay carried out."</p>

  <p>"Oh, am I?" exclaimed the Superintendent. "It's as well to know these
  things in advance." We turned into a side path to get a little farther from
  the beadle and his mate, and Miller continued: "Now, look here, Doctor; I
  want to be clear about this business. This is a civil case, and it is no
  concern of mine, as a police officer. What's the game? You seem to be dumping
  this blooming lead on me, and then there are these screws. Why did you want
  me to take charge of them?" He drew out of his pocket the rusty handful and
  looked at them disparagingly. "I don't see anything special about them. They
  look to me like ordinary screws such as you could buy at any
  ironmonger's."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "They are common-looking screws, I must admit," said
  he. "But don't despise them. Like many other common-looking things, they have
  their value. I want you to put them into an envelope and seal it with your
  official seal; and write on the envelope, 'Screws extracted in my presence
  from the coffin of Josiah Pippet,' and sign it. Will you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miller, "I don't see any objection to that, though I am
  hanged if I can guess what you want them for. But with regard to this lead.
  You want me to have it assayed on my own initiative, as a police officer. But
  I must have something to go on. The judge's order doesn't cover me. Now, I
  know quite well that you have got something perfectly definite in your mind;
  and, knowing you as I do, I am pretty sure that it is not a delusion Can't
  you tell me what it is?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected <i>for</i> a few moments. "The fact is," he said at
  length, "I am in a difficulty. My position in this case is that of a counsel
  instructed by Brodribb." Here Miller indulged in a broad grin, but made no
  comment, beyond something like a wink directed towards me, and Thorndyke
  continued: "You saw that Brodribb disliked the idea of the assay. He is a
  very acute lawyer, but he is a most scrupulously courteous old gentleman, and
  he was obviously unwilling to seem to throw the slightest doubt on the good
  faith of the other side, even Gimbler. Now, I could not act against
  Brodribb's wishes, and there was no need. I had given the other side their
  chance, and they didn't choose to take it."</p>

  <p>"So now," said Miller, "you want, in effect, to run with the hare and hunt
  with the hounds. And I am the hounds. Isn't that the position?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded the Superintendent with an appreciative smile. "Very
  neatly put, Miller," said he, "and I won't deny that it does seem to state
  the position. Nevertheless, I am going to ask you to help me, and to take on
  trust my assurance that, if you act on what I will call my suggestions, you
  will, in your official capacity, 'learn something to your advantage,' as the
  solicitors express it."</p>

  <p>"Still," urged Miller, "if you don't care to let the cat out of the bag,
  you might at least show us her head, or even her tail, so that we may see
  what sort of animal is in the bag."</p>

  <p>Once more, Thorndyke reflected for a few moments before replying. At
  length he said: "I fully appreciate your difficulty, Miller. You can't, as a
  detective officer, start an investigation in the air. But you have known me
  long enough to feel certain that I should not send you off in search of a
  mare's nest."</p>

  <p>"I am quite clear on that point," Miller agreed, warmly. "I only want
  reasonable cover."</p>

  <p>"Very well," rejoined Thorndyke; "I can give you that, if you will take my
  information on trust without the production of evidence."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear the information," said Miller, cautiously.</p>

  <p>"It is this," said Thorndyke; "and I am prepared to give you the
  information in writing, if you want it."</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Miller. "I only want a definite statement."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I will give you one. I declare, positively, that,
  if this is the original coffin, it has, at some time after the date of the
  burial, as set forth on the tomb and on the coffin, been opened and reclosed;
  and that the objects which we have found in it are not its original contents.
  But I am of opinion that this is not the original coffin, but a new coffin
  substituted with the intent to commit a fraud. Will that do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miller. "That is good enough for a start; and not a bad
  start, either. If there has been a fraudulent substitution for the purpose of
  obtaining possession of valuable property, that brings the matter fairly
  within my province. And, what is more, it seems to bring Mr. Horatio Gimbler
  within reach of my claws. But I have a sort of feeling that this faked coffin
  is not the whole of the business. How's that for a guess?"</p>

  <p>"I will say, as the children say in the game of Hot Boiled Beans, that you
  are 'getting warm.' And I would rather not say any more. I want to start you
  on an independent investigation and keep out of it, myself, as counsel in
  this case. But I shall expect that, if you bring any facts to light that have
  a bearing on that case, you will bring them to my notice."</p>

  <p>At this, Miller turned to me with a chuckle of delight.</p>

  <p>"Just listen to him, Dr. Jervis!" he exclaimed, waggishly. "Isn't it as
  good as a play? He stipulates that I shall bring the facts to his notice;
  when you and I know perfectly well that he has got the whole pack of cards up
  his sleeve at this very moment. I wouldn't use the word 'humbug' in connexion
  with a gentleman for whom I have such a profound respect. But&mdash;well,
  what do you want me to do, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"The first thing," said Thorndyke, "is to get rid of those two men. We
  don't want any witnesses. As this ground is closed for burials and is not
  open to the public, there is no reason why you should not take possession of
  the keys. You will want to seal the vault and to have access to it in case
  any further inspection is necessary. The beadle won't make any
  difficulty."</p>

  <p>He did not. On the contrary, he accepted his release gratefully and gave
  up the keys without a word. But, before dismissing the men, we replaced the
  coffin on the shelf, and, for the sake of appearances, we returned the lead
  to its interior and laid the lid on top.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to screw it down," the Superintendent explained. "It may
  have to be re-examined, and I am going to seal up the vault."</p>

  <p>With this he sent the two men off with a small donation for the provision
  of refreshments, accompanying them to the gate and watching their
  disappearance down the street. Then they were out of sight, he signalled to
  the driver of his car&mdash;a big, roomy, official vehicle&mdash;and, when it
  had drawn up at the gate, he returned, and we began operations.</p>

  <p>"I understand," said he, as we lifted off the coffin lid, "that we have
  got to shift this stuff to some assayist's."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need take the sheet lead," said Thorndyke, "though that
  would furnish the best evidence on the question of age."</p>

  <p>"Then let's take the whole boiling," said Miller. "May as well do the
  thing thoroughly."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he seized the roll of lead and carried it to the gate, where
  he deposited it on the rear seat of the car. I followed with the biggest of
  the pot-leavings. The driver of the car came back with Miller, and he, Miller
  and Thorndyke took the other three leavings. The whole collection took up a
  good deal of the accommodation; but Thorndyke occupied the seat next to the
  driver, in order to give directions, and Miller and I packed ourselves in
  amongst the lead as well as we could.</p>

  <p>"I wish the Doctor wasn't so deuced secretive," Miller remarked, as the
  car trundled away westward with a misleading leisurely air. "Of course, it
  doesn't really matter as we shall know all about it presently; but I am on
  tenterhooks of curiosity."</p>

  <p>"So am I, for that matter," said I; "but I am used to it. To work with
  Thorndyke is a fine training in restraint."</p>

  <p>After what seemed an incredibly short journey, we drew up at a large
  building in Bishopsgate. Here Thorndyke alighted and disappeared into the
  entry; and the Superintendent's patience was subjected to a further trial. At
  length, our friend re-appeared, accompanied by an alert-looking elderly
  gentleman, while three workmen in white aprons emerged from the doorway and
  lurked in the background. The elderly gentleman, whom I recognized as a Mr.
  Daniels, a very eminent assayist and metallurgist, approached, and, when he
  had been introduced to Miller, stuck his head in at the window of the car and
  surveyed our collection.</p>

  <p>"So that's the stuff you want an opinion on," said he. "Queer-looking lot.
  However, the first thing to do is to get it moved up to the laboratory."</p>

  <p>He made a sign to his three myrmidons, who forthwith came forward, and,
  grabbing up the ponderous samples, tucked them under their arms as if they
  had been lumps of cork and strolled off into the building. We followed them
  through the weighing rooms on the ground floor to a staircase and up to one
  of the great laboratories, flanked on one side by a row of tall windows, and
  on the other by a long range of cupel furnaces. Here, on a bench under the
  windows, our treasures had been dumped down, and, once more, Mr. Daniels ran
  his eye over them.</p>

  <p>"What's the problem with regard to this?" he asked, indicating the roll of
  lead.</p>

  <p>"It is merely a question of age," replied Thorndyke. "We can leave that
  for the present."</p>

  <p>"And what is this?" asked Daniels, lifting the large pot-remainder and
  turning it over in his hands.</p>

  <p>"It is supposed to be lead, eighty years old," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well, it may be," said Daniels, laying it down and giving it a tap with a
  hammer and eliciting the dull sound characteristic of lead. "And what are
  these other lumps supposed to be?"</p>

  <p>"They are supposed to be lead, too," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well, they are not," said Daniels. "Anyone can see that." He gave one of
  them a tap with the hammer, and the peculiar sharp chink spoke at once of a
  hard, brittle metal. On this, he laid down the hammer and took the lump of
  metal in his hands. And then there came over him the very change that I had
  noticed in the case of Thorndyke, though there was now no disguise. As he
  lifted the mass of metal, he suddenly paused and stood quite still with his
  eyes fixed on Thorndyke and his mouth slightly open. Then he said: "You knew
  that this was not lead, Doctor."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke admitted.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose it is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," said Thorndyke. "I have brought the Superintendent to
  you in order that you may ascertain what it is and give him a confidential
  report on the subject."</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> suppose it is?" asked Miller.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose either," replied Daniels with a faint grin. "I am an
  assayist, and it is my business to find out."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent smiled sourly and looked at me. "These men of science
  don't mean to give themselves away," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Daniels, "what is the use of guessing, and perhaps guessing
  wrong, when you are going to make a test? We have our reputations to
  consider. Now, what do you want me to do about this stuff?"</p>

  <p>"The Superintendent," said Thorndyke, "wants you to make a trial assay,
  just to let him know what the material is. You will report to him what you
  find; and remember, this is a confidential matter, and the Superintendent,
  acting for the Criminal Investigation Department, is your employer."</p>

  <p>"And what about you?" Daniels asked.</p>

  <p>"If the matter concerns me in any way," Thorndyke replied, "I have no
  doubt that the Superintendent will communicate the substance of your report
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Daniels, with a broad smile, "and what a surprise it will
  be to you. Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," growled Miller; "the Doctor is a regular impostor. Of course, he
  knows all about it, without either of us telling him. How long will this job
  take?"</p>

  <p>"It will take some little time," replied Daniels, "as you will want some
  sort of rough estimate of quantities besides the mere qualitative test. Will
  five o'clock do? And shall I report to you on the phone?"</p>

  <p>Miller considered the question. "I am not fond of telephone messages on
  confidential business," said he. "You never know who is at the other end, or
  in the middle. I think I had better run across in the car. Then we can go
  into the affair in more detail, and safe from eavesdroppers. If I am here at
  five o'clock, I can depend on getting your report?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I shall have everything cut and dried by then," Daniels assured him;
  and, the arrangements being thus concluded, we shook hands and took our
  departure.</p>

  <p>As we emerged into Bishopsgate, I noticed that Miller seemed to look a
  little disparagingly at the big car that was drawn up at the curb, and,
  instead of entering at once, he turned to Thorndyke and asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Doctor, to walking home? There are one or two matters
  connected with this case that I should like to talk over with you, and the
  car isn't very convenient; and then there is the driver. We could talk more
  freely if we walked."</p>

  <p>Naturally, Thorndyke, who was an inveterate pedestrian, agreed readily;
  and, when Miller had informed the driver of our decision, we set forth,
  shortening the distance and securing more quiet by striking "across country"
  through the by-streets. As soon as we were clear of the main thoroughfare
  with its bustle and din, Miller proceeded to open the discussion.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Doctor, you are quite clear that there has been some faking of
  that coffin? You've got something solid to go on?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply, "I have no doubt on the subject, and I am prepared
  to say so in the witness-box."</p>

  <p>"That seems to settle it," said Miller. "But there are some queer features
  in the case. You saw the dust in the vault? But I know you did, for I spotted
  you taking samples of it. But it really did look as if it had not been
  disturbed for the best part of a century. Was there anything in that dust
  that looked to you suspicious, or did you take those samples just as a
  routine precaution?"</p>

  <p>"I should have taken a sample in any case," replied Thorndyke. "But in
  this case, it was not merely a routine precaution. That dust did not appear
  to me to agree with the conditions in which it was found. The dust that would
  accumulate in the course of eighty years in a vault above ground would be
  very miscellaneous in its origin. It would consist of particles of all sorts
  of materials which were light enough to float in the air, and in still air at
  that. They would he mostly minute fragments of fibres derived from textiles,
  and these would naturally be of all sorts of different colours. The result of
  such a miscellaneous mixture of different-coloured particles, aided by the
  fading effect of time, would be a dust of a completely neutral grey. But this
  dust was not of a completely neutral grey. It had a recognizable colour; very
  faint and very nearly neutral, but yet there was just a shadowy trace of red.
  And this subtle, almost indistinguishable, tint of red pervaded the whole
  mass. It was all alike. To what the colour may have been due, I cannot judge
  until I have examined the sample under the microscope; but the
  suggestion&mdash;the very strong suggestion&mdash;is that this dust was all
  derived from the same source; which, as I have said, is irreconcilable with
  the ostensible conditions."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's explanation seemed to furnish the Superintendent with
  considerable food for thought, for he made no immediate answer, but appeared
  to be wrapped in profound cogitation. At length, he remarked:</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man, Doctor. Nothing seems to escape you, and you let
  nothing pass without consideration and a confirmatory test. I wish, now, that
  we had put you on that damned head&mdash;you know the one I mean&mdash;the
  human head that was found in a case at Fenchurch Street Station."</p>

  <p>"I remember," said Thorndyke. "It was an odd affair, but I fancy that the
  head was only a by-product. The purpose of the man who left it was to get
  possession of the case containing property worth several thousand pounds. He
  happened to have a human head on his hands, and he, very wisely, took the
  opportunity to get rid of it and so kill two birds with one stone."</p>

  <p>"That may be," said Miller; "but I am not taking that head so calmly as
  you are. It has been the bane of our lives at the Yard, with all the
  newspaper men shouting 'unsolved mystery' and 'another undetected murder' and
  asking perpetually what the police are doing. And it really was a mysterious
  affair. I have been surprised to notice how little interest you have taken in
  that head. I should have thought it would have been a problem exactly in your
  line. But you medical jurists are a cold-blooded lot. You were speaking just
  now of this man 'having a human head on his hands' as if it were a worn-out
  umbrella or an old pair of boots."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "I am not disparaging the head, Miller,"
  said he. "It presented quite an interesting problem. But it was not my
  problem. I was a mere disinterested onlooker."</p>

  <p>"You don't usually take that sordid view," grumbled Miller. "I have
  generally found you ready to take an interest in a curious problem for its
  own sake."</p>

  <p>To this Thorndyke made no rejoinder, and for some time we walked on in
  silence. Suddenly, the Superintendent stopped short and stood gazing across
  the road.</p>

  <p>"By the immortal Jingo!" he exclaimed. "Talk of the Devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off and started to run across the road; and, following his
  movements with my eyes, I saw, on the opposite pavement, a newspaper boy
  bearing a poster on which was printed in enormous type:</p>

  <p>HORRIBLE DISCOVERY. HEADLESS CORPSE BY ROADSIDE.</p>

  <p>It was certainly curiously apropos of the subject of our conversation, and
  I so far shared the Superintendent's excitement that I was about to follow
  him when I saw that he had secured three copies of the paper and was coming
  back to us with them in his hand. He distributed his gifts rapidly, and then,
  backing into the wide entry of a draper's shop, proceeded eagerly to devour
  the paragraph indicated by the "scare" headlines. Following him into his
  retreat, I opened the paper and read:</p>

  <p>"Some months ago the public was horrified by the discovery in the cloak
  room at Fenchurch Street Station of a human head packed in a wooden case. No
  solution of the mystery surrounding this terrible relic was forthcoming at
  the inquest, nor were the police ever able to discover any clue to its origin
  or the identity of the murderer. The matter was allowed to lapse into
  oblivion, to be added to the long list of undiscovered murders. But questions
  relating to this tragedy have been revived by a strange and shocking
  discovery which was made this morning by the side of the arterial road known
  as the Watling Street, which passes from London through Dartford to
  Rochester. Between three and four miles on the Rochester side of Dartford,
  the road passes through a deep cutting, which was made to reduce the gradient
  of the hill, the sides of which are in two stages, there being, about
  half-way up, a shelf several feet wide. As this shelf is some thirty feet
  above the road, its surface is entirely invisible to anyone passing along the
  latter, though it is, of course, visible from above. But the hill through
  which the road is cut is covered with dense woodland, seldom trodden by the
  foot of man. Thus, for months at a time, this shelf remains unseen by any
  human eye.</p>

  <p>"But this morning Fate guided the footsteps of an observer to this spot,
  so remote and yet so near. A local archaeologist, a Mr. Elmhurst of
  Gravesend, happened to be making a sketch-map of the features of the wood
  when his wanderings took him to the edge of the cutting. Looking down the
  cliff-like descent, he was horrified to observe, lying on the shelf
  immediately below him, the headless and perfectly nude body of a man. Its
  huddled attitude suggested that it had rolled down the steep slope and been
  arrested by the shelf; and, even from the distance at which he stood, it was
  evident that it had been lying exposed for a considerable time.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elmhurst did not stay to make any further observations, but, taking
  the shortest way to the road, hailed an approaching motorist, who very
  obligingly conveyed him to Gravesend, where he notified the police of his
  discovery. An ambulance was at once procured, and, guided by the discoverer,
  proceeded to the spot, whence&mdash;after a careful examination by the
  police&mdash;the body was conveyed to Dartford, where it now lies in the
  mortuary awaiting an inquest.</p>

  <p>"The body appears to be that of a youngish man, rather short and
  exceptionally muscular; and the condition of the strong and well-shaped hands
  suggests that the deceased was a skilled workman of some kind. The inquest
  will be opened tomorrow."</p>

  <p>As I reached the end of the account, I glanced at the Superintendent and
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"A very creditable piece of journalism. The reporter hasn't wasted much
  time. What do you think of it, Miller?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm very relieved," he replied. "I've been waiting for this for
  months. I'm fairly sick of all the talk about the unsolved mystery, and the
  undiscovered murder. Now, we may be able to get a move on, though I must
  admit that it doesn't look like a very promising case. It's a long time since
  the man was murdered, and there doesn't seem much to go on. Still, it's
  better than a head in a box with no clue to the owner. What do you think of
  it, Doctor? I suppose you've been expecting it, too?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say 'expecting,'" Thorndyke replied. "The possibility of
  something of this kind had occurred to me. But you must bear in mind that the
  head, being preserved and packed in a case, offered no suggestions as to the
  time or place of death. As this body was apparently not preserved, it will be
  possible to arrive at an approximate date of death; and, as it was found in a
  particular place, some idea of locality may be formed. But any conclusions as
  to the locality in which the murder took place will have to be very
  cautiously considered, having regard to the ease with which, in these days,
  bodies can be carried away long distances from the scene of the crime. And,
  again, the body is nude, so that there will be no help from the clothing
  towards identification; and, as it appears to have been exposed in the open
  for months, its own condition will make identification difficult. I agree
  with you, Miller. It does not look a very promising case."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent nodded and growled an inarticulate assent. But, in
  spite of Thorndyke's rather cold comfort, he still seemed disposed to be
  optimistic; and when we parted at the Inner Temple gate, he walked away with
  a springy step and an almost jaunty air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; THORNDYKE BECOMES INTERESTED</h2>

  <p class="first">MILLER'S intense interest in the "horrible discovery" did
  not surprise me at all. But Thorndyke's did. For what the Superintendent had
  said was perfectly true. The mysterious "head in a box" had aroused in him
  only the most languid curiosity. Which, again to quote Miller, was entirely
  unlike him. It is true that he liked, if possible, to be officially appointed
  to investigate an interesting case. But, appointment or no appointment, from
  sheer professional enthusiasm, he always kept himself informed on, and
  followed with the closest interest, any criminal case that presented unusual
  or obscure features.</p>

  <p>Now, the "head in the box" case had appeared to me eminently unusual and
  obscure. It had seemed to imply an atrocious crime which combined with its
  atrocity a remarkable degree of callous ingenuity. And the mystery
  surrounding it was undeniable. Excepting some vague connexion with the great
  platinum robbery (itself an unsolved mystery) it offered not a single clue.
  Yet Thorndyke had seemed to dismiss it as a mere oddity. He could not have
  been less moved if it had been a wax-work head&mdash;which it certainly was
  not.</p>

  <p>His own explanation did not seem to me to be entirely satisfactory. It was
  true, as he had said, that there was a total lack of data; and "a mere
  mystery, without a single leading fact is not, to a medical jurist, worth
  powder and shot." The fact that the head was preserved and practically
  imperishable excluded any inferences as to time or place. It might, for any
  evidence to the contrary, have been the head of a person who had died in
  Australia twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>So he had dismissed it into the region of the unknowable; at least, so I
  had understood; though I had never felt quite sure that he had not, in his
  queer, secret fashion, just docketed it and packed it away in some
  pigeon-hole of his inexhaustible memory, there to repose until such time as
  the "leading fact" should come into view, unrecognized by anyone but
  himself.</p>

  <p>This faint suspicion now tended to revive. For though the headless body
  looked as hopeless a mystery as the bodyless head, there was clearly no
  question of dismissing it as "not worth powder and shot." That powder and
  shot were already being expended, I ascertained that very evening, when,
  returning to our chambers after a lengthy consultation, I found on the table
  a six-inch Ordnance map, a boxwood scale, a pair of dividers and a motor
  road-map.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the latter was obvious on inspection. The Ordnance map was
  dated 1910 and did not show the arterial road. The motor map showed the new
  road&mdash;and mighty little else; but as much, no doubt, as interested the
  average motorist. From the road-map, the new road had been transferred in
  pencil to the Ordnance map, which was thus brought up to date while retaining
  all the original topographical features; and the locality shown left no doubt
  as to the nature of the investigation.</p>

  <p>I was still looking at the maps and reflecting as above when the door
  opened and my colleague entered.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were out, Thorndyke," said I.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied; "I have been up in the laboratory, having a chat with
  Polton about a job that I want him to do. I see you have been inspecting what
  the reporters will call 'the scene of the tragedy.'"</p>

  <p>"I see that you have," I retorted, "and have been speculating on your
  change of front. The 'head in the box' apparently left you cold, but you seem
  to be developing quite a keen interest in this problem. Why this
  inconsistency?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "there is no inconsistency. The case is
  entirely altered. We have now a number of facts from which to start an
  inquiry. From the state of the body, we can form an approximate judgment as
  to the date about which death occurred. Perhaps the cause of death many
  transpire at the inquest. We knew where the body was found; and even if it
  may have been conveyed thither from a distance, the selection of the place
  where it was deposited suggests some local knowledge. The spot was extremely
  well-chosen, as events have proved."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but it was a queer idea to dump it there. A sort of ghastly
  practical joke. Just think of it, Thorndyke. Think of that great procession
  of traffic of all kinds&mdash;cars, motor coaches, lorries,
  cyclists&mdash;streaming along that road by the thousand, day after day,
  month after month; and all the time, within a biscuit-toss of them, that
  gruesome thing lying there open to the sky."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "there is certainly an element of the macabre in the
  setting of this crime, though I don't suppose it was intentional."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. Nor do I suppose that the horrible picturesqueness of the
  setting is what is attracting you. I wonder what is."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke did not reply immediately but sat regarding me with a sort of
  appraising expression (which I recognized, and had come by experience, to
  associate with some special exhibition of thick-headedness on my part). At
  length he replied:</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should. The problem of this headless body abounds in
  elements of interest. All sorts of questions arise out of it. There is that
  embalmed head for instance. That seems to have an obvious connexion with this
  body."</p>

  <p>"Very obvious indeed," said I, with a grin; "and the connexion was still
  closer when the head was on the body."</p>

  <p>He smiled indulgently and continued: "Disregarding the suggested
  anatomical connexion, there is the connexion of action and motive. What, for
  instance, is the connexion of the man who deposited the head in the
  cloak-room with this body? We don't know how he came by that head. The fact
  that he had it in his possession is an incriminating fact, but it is not
  evidence of murder. It is not even certain that he knew what was in the case.
  But whether he did or not, he is obviously involved in a complex of
  circumstances which includes this body. However, it is premature to discuss
  the case until we have the additional facts that will probably transpire at
  the inquest. Meanwhile," he concluded, with an exasperating smile, "I
  recommend my learned friend to go carefully over all the facts in his
  possession, relating both to the embalmed head and the headless body. Let him
  consider those facts critically as to their separate value and in relation to
  one another. If he does this, I think he will find that some extremely
  interesting conclusions will emerge."</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary to say his opinion was not justified by results. I did,
  indeed, chew the cud of the few, unilluminating facts that were known to me.
  But the only conclusion that emerged was that, in some obscure way of which I
  could make nothing, this headless corpse was connected with the mystery of
  the stolen platinum. But this, I felt sure, was not the conclusion that was
  in Thorndyke's mind. And at that, I had to leave it.</p>

  <p>On the following morning, Thorndyke went forth to attend at the inquest. I
  was not able to go with him, nor did I particularly wish to, as I knew that I
  should get full information from him as to the facts elicited. He started, as
  I thought, unnecessarily early and he came back unexpectedly late. But this
  latter circumstance was presently explained by the appearance on the Ordnance
  map of a pencilled cross at the roadside, indicating the spot on which the
  body had been lying when it was first seen. Later in the evening, when giving
  me particulars of the inquest, he mentioned that he had visited the site of
  the discovery and "gone over the ground, roughly," having taken his bicycle
  down by train for that purpose.</p>

  <p>"Did you pick up anything of interest at the inquest?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "it was quite a good inquest. The coroner was a careful
  man who knew his business and kept to it, and the medical witness had made a
  thorough examination and gave his evidence clearly and concisely. As to the
  facts, they were simple enough, though important. The body was, of course, a
  good deal the worse for exposure to the weather. As to the date of death, the
  doctor wisely declined to make a definite statement, but he estimated it at
  not less than three months ago. The body appeared to be that of a man between
  thirty and forty years of age, five feet, six inches in height,
  broad-shouldered and muscular, with rather small, well-shaped hands, which
  showed a definite, but not considerable, thickening of the skin on the palms;
  from which, and from the dirty and ill-kept finger-nails, the doctor inferred
  that deceased was a workman of some kind, but not a labourer.</p>

  <p>"The head had been separated from the spinal column with a knife, leaving
  the atlas intact, and, to this extent, the separation had been effected
  skilfully."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I. "That point was made, I remember, at the inquest on the
  head. It would require some skill and the knowledge as to where the joint was
  to be found. By the way, was the question of the head raised?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Naturally a juryman wanted to question the doctor on the subject,
  but the witness very properly replied that his evidence dealt only with facts
  observed by himself, and the coroner supported him. Then the question was
  raised whether the head should not be produced for comparison with the body;
  but the doctor refused to go into the matter, and the coroner pointed out
  that the head had already been examined medically and that all the facts were
  available in the depositions of the witnesses. He did, however, read out some
  of the depositions from the previous inquest and asked the doctor whether the
  facts set forth in them were consistent with the belief that the head and the
  headless body were parts of one and the same person; to which the doctor
  replied that the mode of separation was the same in both and that the parts
  which were missing in the one were present in the other, but beyond that he
  would give no opinion."</p>

  <p>"Did he give any opinion as to the cause of death?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," replied Thorndyke. "There was no mystery about that. There was
  a knife-wound in the back, near the angle of the left scapula, penetrating
  deeply and transfixing the heart. It appeared to have been inflicted with a
  large, single-edged knife of the 'Green River' type, and obviously with great
  force. The witness stated, confidently, that it could not have been
  self-inflicted."</p>

  <p>"That seems to be pretty obvious, too," said I. "At any rate, the man
  could not have cut his own head off."</p>

  <p>"A very capable detective sergeant gave evidence," Thorndyke resumed,
  dismissing&mdash;to my secret amusement&mdash;the trivial and uninteresting
  detail of the manner in which this unfortunate creature had been done to
  death. "He stated that the wood had been searched for the dead man's
  clothing. But I suspect that it was a very perfunctory search, as he was
  evidently convinced that it was not there; remarking, plausibly enough, that,
  since the clothing must have been stripped off to prevent identification, it
  would not be reasonable to expect to find it in the vicinity. He was of
  opinion that the body had been brought from a distance in a car or van, and
  that, probably, two or more persons were concerned in the affair."</p>

  <p>"It seems likely," I said, "having regard to the remoteness of the place.
  But it is only a guess."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Thorndyke agreed. "There was a good deal of guessing and not
  many facts; and the few facts that were really significant do not seem to
  have been understood."</p>

  <p>"What are the facts that you regard as really significant?" I asked. Not
  that I had the slightest expectation that he would tell me. And he did not.
  His inevitable reply was:</p>

  <p>"You know what the known facts are, Jervis, and you will see for yourself,
  if you consider them critically, which are the significant ones. But, to
  return to the inquest. The coroner's summing-up was excellent, having regard
  to the evidence that had been given. I took shorthand notes of some of it,
  and I will read them to you. With reference to the embalmed head he
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"It has been suggested that the head which was found at Fenchurch Street
  Station ought to have been brought here for comparison. But to what purpose?
  What kind of comparison is possible? If the head is broken off a china figure
  and the two parts are lost and subsequently found in different places, the
  question as to whether they are parts of the same figure can be settled by
  putting them together and seeing whether the fractured surfaces fit each
  other. But with a detached human head&mdash;especially after the lapse of
  months&mdash;this is not possible. If the preserved head had been exhumed and
  brought here, we could have learned nothing more from it than we can learn
  from the depositions of the medical witness, which I have read to you.
  Accordingly, we must fall back on our common sense; and I think we shall find
  that enough for our purpose.</p>

  <p>"Let us look at the facts. A headless body has been found in one place,
  and a body-less head in another. The doctor has told us that they might
  be&mdash;though he doesn't say that they are&mdash;the head and body of one
  and the same person. They agree in the peculiar and unusual mode of
  separation. The parts which are absent in the one are present in the other.
  There is no part missing, and no part redundant. If that head had been cut
  off this, body, the appearances would be exactly what they are.</p>

  <p>"'Now, gentlemen, if headless human bodies and body-less human heads were
  quite common objects, we might have to search further. But, fortunately, they
  are so rare and unusual that we may almost regard these remains as unique.
  And if they are not parts of the same person, then there must be, somewhere,
  an undiscovered body belonging to the head, and, somewhere else, an
  undiscovered head belonging to this body. But, I submit, gentlemen, that
  common sense rejects such enormous improbabilities and compels us to adopt
  the obvious and simple explanation that the head and the body are those of
  one and the same person.</p>

  <p>"'As to the cause of death, you have heard the doctor's evidence. Deceased
  was killed by a knife-wound, which he could not have inflicted himself, and
  which was therefore inflicted by some other person. And with that I leave you
  to consider your verdict.'"</p>

  <p>"An excellent summing-up," said I, "and very well argued. The verdict was
  Wilful Murder, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. 'By some person or persons unknown.' And the jury could hardly have
  come to any other conclusion. But, as you see, the case is, from the police
  point of view, left in the air."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "If Miller is taking up the case, as I assume that he is,
  he has got his work cut out. I don't see that this body was such a wind-fall
  as he seemed to think. Scotland Yard may catch some more trouble from the
  Press if something fresh does not turn up."</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke rejoined, by way of winding up the conversation, "we
  must hope, like medico-legal Micawbers, that something will turn up."</p>

  <p>For the next few days, however, the case remained "in the air." But it was
  not alone in this respect. Presently I began to be conscious that there were
  other matters in the air. For instance, our invaluable assistant, Polton,
  suddenly developed a curious, stealthy, conspiratorial manner of going about,
  or locking himself in the laboratory, which experience had taught me to
  associate with secret activities foreshadowing some important and dramatic
  "move" on Thorndyke's part. Then, on the fourth day after the inquest, I
  detected my colleague in the suspicious act of pacing the pavement at the
  lower, and more secluded, end of King's Bench Walk, in earnest conversation
  with Mr. Superintendent Miller. And the <i>prima facie</i> suspiciousness of
  the proceeding was confirmed by the eagerness and excitement that were
  evident in the face and manner of our friend, and even more by the way in
  which he suddenly shut up, like a snapped snuff-box, as I approached.</p>

  <p>And, that very evening, Thorndyke exploded the mine.</p>

  <p>"We have got an expedition on, tomorrow," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Who are we?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You and I, Miller and Polton. I know you have got the day free."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going to?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"To Swanscombe Wood," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"To collect some further facts relating to the headless body," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>As a mere statement, it did not sound very sensational. But to one who
  knew Thorndyke as I knew him, it had certain implications that gave it a
  special significance. In the first place, Thorndyke tended habitually to
  under-statement; and, in the second, he took no one into his confidence while
  his investigations were at the tentative stage. As Miller expressed it, "The
  Doctor would never show a card until he was ready to take the trick." Whence
  there naturally arose in my mind a strong suspicion that the "further facts"
  which we were to collect were already in Thorndyke's possession.</p>

  <p>And events proved that I was not so very far wrong.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE DENE HOLE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE products of Polton's labours impressed me as
  disappointing and hardly worthy of his mechanical ingenuity, consisting of
  nothing more subtle than an immense coil of rope, rove through two double
  blocks and forming a long and powerful tackle, a tripod formed of three very
  stout iron-shod seven-foot poles, and a strong basket such as builders use,
  furnished with strong rope slings. There was one further item, which was more
  worthy of its producer; a large electric lamp, fitted with adjustable lenses,
  and, to judge by the suspension arrangements, designed to throw a powerful
  beam of parallel rays vertically downwards.</p>

  <p>But if Polton's productions were of an unexpected kind, the vehicle in
  which the Superintendent drove up to our entry was even more so. For, though
  it bore no outward distinguishing marks, it was an undeniable motor
  ambulance. However, if less dignified and imposing than the official car, it
  was a good deal more convenient. The unwieldy tripod, tackle and basket were
  easily disposed of in its roomy interior, still leaving ample accommodation
  for me and Polton and the detective sergeant whom Miller had brought as an
  additional assistant. The Superintendent, himself, was at the steering wheel,
  and Thorndyke took the seat beside him to give directions as we approached
  our destination.</p>

  <p>I asked no questions. The character of our outfit told me pretty plainly
  what kind of job we had in hand; and I felt a malicious satisfaction in
  tantalizing Polton, who was, so to speak, bursting with silence and secrecy
  and the desire to be questioned. So, little was said&mdash;and nothing to the
  point&mdash;while the ambulance trundled out at the Tudor Street gate,
  crossed Blackfriars Bridge, threaded its way through the traffic of the South
  London streets, and presently came out upon the Dover Road. A few minutes
  later, as we mounted a steep rise, the sergeant, who, hitherto, had uttered
  not a word, removed his pipe from his mouth, remarked, "Shooter's Hill" and
  replaced it as if it were a stopper.</p>

  <p>The ambulance bowled smoothly along the straight line of the old Roman
  road. Welling, Crayford and Dartford were entered and left behind. A few
  minutes after leaving Dartford, the road began a long ascent and then, after
  a short run on the level, fell away somewhat steeply. At this point, the
  sergeant once more removed his pipe, nodded at the side window, and, having
  affirmed, stolidly, "That's the place," reinserted the stopper.</p>

  <p>The ambulance now began to slow down, and, a minute or two later, drew in
  by the side of the road and halted. Then, as Thorndyke and the Superintendent
  alighted, we also got out, and the sergeant proceeded to occupy the driver's
  seat.</p>

  <p>"You and Polton had better stay here for the present," said Thorndyke.
  "The Superintendent and I are going to locate the spot. When we have found
  it, he will remain there while I come back and help you to carry the
  gear."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a marching-compass and a card, on one side of
  which a sketch-plan had been drawn while a number of bearings were written on
  the other. After a glance at the latter, he set the direction line of the
  compass and started off along a rough foot-path, followed by the
  Superintendent. We watched their receding figures as they ascended the hill
  and approached the wood by which it was covered. At the margin of the latter,
  Thorndyke paused and "turned to take a last, fond look" at his starting-point
  and check his compass bearings. Then he faced about, and, in a few seconds,
  he and the Superintendent disappeared into the wood.</p>

  <p>Waiting is usually a tedious business, and is still more so when the
  waiter is on the tip-toe of expectation and curiosity. Vainly, I endeavoured
  to repress a tendency to useless and futile speculation as to what Thorndyke
  was seeking (or, more probably, had already found and was now about to
  disclose). As for Polton, if he could have been furnished with an emotional
  pressure-gauge, it would certainly have burst. Even the stolid sergeant was
  fain to come off his perch and pace up and down by the roadside; and once he
  actually went so far as to take out the stopper and remark that "it seemed as
  if the Doctor had made some sort of discovery."</p>

  <p>Anon our sufferings were somewhat alleviated by the arrival of a police
  patrol, who came free-wheeling down the hill from the direction of Dartford.
  As he approached us, he slowed down more and more and eventually dismounted
  to make a circuit of our vehicle, with the manner of a dog sniffing at a
  suspicious stranger. Apparently, it appearance did not satisfy him, and he
  proceeded to interrogate.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" he asked, not uncivilly. "This looks like an ambulance
  but I see you have got some lifting gear inside."</p>

  <p>Here the sergeant interposed with a brief and unlucid explanation of our
  business, at the same time producing his credentials; at the sight whereof
  the patrol officer was visibly impressed, and showed an unmistakeable
  tendency to linger, which the sergeant by no means sought to discourage.</p>

  <p>"Can I give any assistance?" the patrol man asked, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," the sergeant replied, promptly, "if you could spare the time to
  give an eye to this car, that would release me to lend the Superintendent a
  hand."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the patrol man would have preferred to transpose these
  functions, but, nevertheless, he agreed readily; and at this moment Thorndyke
  reappeared from the wood and came striding swiftly towards us along the
  foot-path. As he came up, the sergeant explained the new arrangements with
  some anxiety as to whether they would be approved. To his evident relief,
  Thorndyke accepted them readily.</p>

  <p>"We shall be none the worse for an extra hand," said he. "Now we shall be
  able to carry the whole kit up in one journey."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, we proceeded to get the gear out of the ambulance and
  distribute the items among the party. Thorndyke and I took the tripod on our
  shoulders&mdash;and a deuce of a weight it was. The sergeant got the great
  coil of rope on to his back with the aid of a spare sling; and Polton brought
  up the rear with the basket, in which was stowed the lamp, while the patrol
  man kept a look-out with a view to heading off any inquisitive strangers who
  might be attracted by the queer aspect of our procession.</p>

  <p>Appreciation of the beauties of the countryside is not favoured by the
  presence on one's shoulder of three massive ash poles with heavy iron
  fittings. The character of the ground was what chiefly occupied my attention,
  particularly after we had entered the wood; where I got the impression that
  some ingenious sylvan devil had collected all the brambles from miles around
  and arranged them in an interminable series of entanglements, compared with
  which the barbed-wire defences of a German trench were but feeble and
  amateurish imitations. But we tramped on, crashing through the yellow and
  russet leafage, Thorndyke leading with his compass in his unoccupied hand and
  trudging forward in silence, save for an occasional soft chuckle at my lurid
  comments on the landscape.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, I heard Miller's voice informing us that "here we were," and we
  nearly collided with him at the edge of a small opening. Here we set down the
  tripod, opening it enough to enable it to stand upright.</p>

  <p>"You didn't have to blow your whistle," said Thorndyke. "I suppose you
  heard us coming?"</p>

  <p>"Heard you coming!" exclaimed Miller. "It was like a troop of blooming
  elephants&mdash;to say nothing of Dr. Jervis's language. Hallo, Sergeant! I
  thought I told you to stay with the car."</p>

  <p>The sergeant hastily explained the arrangements, adding that "The Doctor"
  had concurred; on which the Superintendent, having also approved, set him to
  work at getting the gear ready.</p>

  <p>A glance around the little opening in which we were gathered showed me
  that my diagnosis of the purpose of the expedition had been correct. Near the
  middle of the opening, half concealed by the rank undergrowth, yawned the
  mouth of one of those mysterious pits known as dene holes which are scattered
  in such numbers over this part of Kent. Cautiously, I approached the brink
  and peered down into the black depths.</p>

  <p>"Horrible, dangerous things, these dene holes are," said Miller. "Ought to
  be fenced in. How deep do you say this pit is, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"This one is just about sixty feet, but many of them are deeper. Seventy
  feet is about the average."</p>

  <p>"Sixty feet!" exclaimed Polton, with a fascinated eye on the yawning hole.
  "And anyone coming along here in the dark might step into it without a
  moment's warning. Horrible! Did I understand you, sir, to say that it was dug
  a very long time ago?"</p>

  <p>"It has been there as you see it," replied Thorndyke, "for thousands of
  years. How many thousands we can't say. But there seems to be no doubt that
  these dene holes were excavated by the men of the Old Stone Age."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Polton. "Thousands of years! I should have thought
  that, by this time, they would have been full to the brim of the people who
  had tumbled into them."</p>

  <p>While these exclamations and comments were passing, the preparations were
  in progress for the exploration. The tripod was set up over the hole (which
  was some three feet in diameter and roughly circular, like the mouth of a
  well), the tackle securely hooked on and the lamp suspended in position. The
  Superintendent switched on the light by means of a push at the end of a cord,
  and, grasping the tripod, leaned over the hole and peered down the well-like
  shaft.</p>

  <p>"I can't make out very much," he remarked. "I seem to see what looks like
  a boot, and that's about all."</p>

  <p>"It is a long way down," said Thorndyke, "and it doesn't matter much what
  we can see from above. We shall soon know exactly what there is down
  there."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he switched off the lamp and hooked the basket on to the
  tackle by means of a pair of clip-hooks, provided with a safety catch. Then
  he produced a candle from his pocket and proceeded to light it.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the idea of your going down, Doctor," said the
  Superintendent. "It's really our job."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke, drawing the basket to the edge of the
  hole and stepping into it. "I proposed the exploration and undertook to carry
  it out. Besides, I want to see what the bottom of this dene hole is
  like."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, sir," Polton interposed, earnestly, "that it would be
  better for me to go down? I am so much lighter and should put less strain on
  the tackle."</p>

  <p>"My dear Polton," said Thorndyke, regarding his devoted henchman with an
  appreciative smile, "this tackle would bear a couple of tons, easily. There
  isn't any strain. But I will ask you to pay out the rope as steadily as you
  can, and keep an eye on this candle. If it goes out, you had better haul up
  at once without waiting for a signal, as you will know that I have dropped
  into foul air. Now, I am ready if you are."</p>

  <p>He steadied himself by lightly grasping two of the tackle-ropes and I took
  a turn round the trunk of a birch tree with the "fall" by passing the big
  coil round. Then Miller and the sergeant hauled on the rope while I gathered
  in the slack; the tackle grew taut, the basket began to rise from the ground
  and swung directly over the black hole.</p>

  <p>"Now, pay out steadily and not too fast," said Thorndyke; and as we began
  to ease out the rope, he slowly sank, like a stage demon, and disappeared
  into the bowels of the earth, while Polton, grasping the tripod and leaning
  over the hole, watched his descent with starting eyes and an expression of
  horror.</p>

  <p>Owing to the great power of the tackle, the weight on the fall was quite
  trifling. I could, alone, have paid it out easily with the aid of the turn
  round the tree. So we were able, in turn, to leave it to satisfy our
  curiosity and relieve our anxiety by a glance down the shaft; which now
  looked even more alarming than when we had looked into the mere, impenetrable
  blackness of the hole. For now, as we peered down the well-like shaft, at our
  friend&mdash;already grown small in the distance-faintly illuminated by the
  glimmer of the candle, we were able to realize the horrible depth to which
  this strange memorial of a forgotten race sank into the earth.</p>

  <p>But the unfailing glimmer of the candle-light&mdash;though it had now
  dwindled to a mere distant spark&mdash;reassured us; for, apart from the
  possibility of "choke damp," there was really no appreciable danger.
  Notwithstanding which, Polton was fain, from time to time, to relieve his
  overwrought feelings by hailing the now invisible explorer with the inquiry,
  "All right, sir?" to which a strange, sepulchral, but surprisingly loud voice
  replied: "All right, Polton."</p>

  <p>After an almost interminable paying-out, the diminishing remainder of rope
  warned us that Thorndyke must have nearly reached the bottom, and then a
  sudden relaxation of the tension informed us that he had already done so.
  Immediately afterwards, that uncanny, megaphonic voice announced the fact and
  directed us to switch on the light and throw down the spare sling. I at once
  complied with the first order and was about to carry out the other when it
  occurred to me that a stout rope sling might fall with unpleasant force after
  a drop of sixty feet. Accordingly, I coiled it loosely round the
  tackle-ropes, and, securing the ends with a hitch, let go; when I saw it
  slide smoothly down the ropes to the bottom.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what he wants with that sling," Miller speculated, grasping the
  tripod and leaning over to peer down. But, as the only result was to obscure
  the light of the lamp and throw the shaft into shadow, he withdrew and waited
  for events to enlighten him. Then the voice came reverberating up the shaft,
  commanding us to hoist.</p>

  <p>If the paying-out had been a long business, the hauling up was longer.
  There seemed to be no end to that rope; and as I hauled and hauled, I found
  myself wishing that Thorndyke had been a little less cautious and contented
  himself with a less powerful but quicker tackle. From time to time, Miller
  was impelled by the intensity of his curiosity to thrust his head over the
  hole to see what was coming up; but, as his head cut off the light of the
  lamp and rendered the ascending object invisible, he retired each time,
  defeated and muttering. At length, as the accumulating coils of rope told us
  that our freight must be nearing the surface, he succeeded in catching a
  glimpse of the object. But so far was that glimpse from allaying his
  curiosity that it reduced him to a frenzy of excitement.</p>

  <p>"It looks like a body!" he exclaimed. "A man's body. But it can't be!"</p>

  <p>It was, however. As we hauled in the last few feet of the rope and made
  fast to the tree, there arose out of the hole the body of a tall,
  well-dressed man which had been suspended from the hook of the tackle by the
  sling, passed round the chest under the arms. Miller helped me to haul it
  away from the hole, when we unfastened the sling and let the body fall on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Superintendent, surveying it gloomily, "this is a
  disappointment. We have come all this way and taken all this trouble just to
  salve the body of a poor devil who has stumbled into this infernal pit by
  accident and who is no concern of ours at all. Of course, it is not the
  Doctor's fault. He discovered that there was something down there and he drew
  the very natural conclusion, though it happened to be the wrong one. Let the
  damn tackle down again as fast as you can and get the Doctor up. I expect he
  is as sick as I am."</p>

  <p>The lowering of the tackle was a slow and tedious business, for, as there
  was now no weight to pull it down, it had to be "overhauled." Fortunately,
  Polton had oiled the sheaves so that they turned smoothly and easily; but it
  was a long time before the voice from below notified us that the lower block
  had reached the bottom. Its reverberations had hardly died away when the
  order came up to hoist, and we straightway began to haul, while Polton coiled
  down the rope as it was gathered in. Presently I noticed a puzzled expression
  on the Superintendant's face, and, as I looked at him inquiringly, he
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"This can't be the Doctor. He's a bigger man than that poor beggar, but
  there doesn't seem to be any weight on the rope at all."</p>

  <p>I had noticed this, myself, and now suggested that we might take advantage
  of the light weight by hauling up more quickly; which we did with such a will
  that Miller's opinion was presently confirmed by the appearance of the basket
  at the mouth of the pit. As it came into view, the Superintendent gazed at it
  in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's the clothes, after all!" he exclaimed, seizing the basket and
  turning its contents out on to the ground, "and the right ones, too, by the
  look of them. A complete outfit; suit, shirt, underclothing, socks,
  boots&mdash;everything but the hat. He must have had a hat, and so must the
  other fellow. Perhaps the Doctor will bring them up with him."</p>

  <p>Having emptied the basket, we sent it down again; and now being able to
  judge the distance, we let it run down by its own weight, only checking it as
  it neared the bottom. After a very brief interval, the hollow voice from
  below directed us to haul up, and once again we began to gather in the rope
  and coil it down.</p>

  <p>"This is queer," said Miller, as he took his turn at the rope. "It is no
  heavier than it was last time. I wonder what he is sending up now."</p>

  <p>In his impatience to solve this new mystery, he hauled with such energy
  that beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead. But it is difficult to
  hurry a four-fold tackle and it was a long time before the basket came into
  view. When, at last, it became visible a few feet down, its appearance
  evidently disappointed him, for he exclaimed, in a tone of disgust:</p>

  <p>"Hats. Two hats. I should have thought he might have brought them up with
  him and saved a journey."</p>

  <p>"There is something in it besides the hats," said I, as the basket rose
  out of the mouth of the pit and I drew it aside on to the ground, while the
  others gathered round. I seized the two hats and lifted them out; and then I
  stood as if petrified, with the hats in my hands, too astounded to utter a
  sound.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Miller exclaimed, huskily. "A man's head! Now what the blazes
  can be the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>He stood, staring in amazement&mdash;as, indeed, we all did&mdash;at the
  horrible relic that lay at the bottom of the basket. Suddenly he seized the
  latter and turned it upside down, when the head rolled out on the ground.
  Then he flung the basket into the hole and gruffly ordered us to "let
  go."</p>

  <p>There was no interval this time, for, almost as the rope slackened,
  informing us that the basket had settled on the bottom, the hollow voice from
  below commanded us to haul up. And as soon as we had taken in the slack, we
  knew by the weight that Thorndyke was at the other end of the tackle.
  Accordingly, I once more took a turn round the tree to prevent the chance of
  a slip or jerk and the others hauled steadily and evenly. Even now, the
  weight seemed comparatively trifling, but what we gained from the tackle in
  lifting power we lost in speed. In mechanics as in other things you can't
  have it both ways. However, at long last, Polton, grasping the tripod and
  craning over the hole, was able to announce that "the Doctor" was nearly up;
  and after another couple of minutes he appeared rising slowly above ground,
  when Polton carefully drew the basket on to the solid earth and helped him to
  step out.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," said Miller, "you've given us a bit of a surprise, as you
  generally do. But," he added, pointing to the head, which lay with its
  shrunken, discoloured face turned up to the sky, "what are we to make of
  that? We've got a head too many."</p>

  <p>"Too many for what?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"For what we were inquiring into," Miller replied testily. "See what you
  have done for us. We find a head in a box at Fenchurch Street Station. Then
  we keep a look-out for the body belonging to it, and at last it turns up.
  Then you bring us here and produce another head; which puts us back where we
  started. We've still got a spare head that we can't account for."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled grimly. "I am not under a contract," said he, "to supply
  facts that will fit your theory of a crime. We must take the facts as they
  come; and I think there can be no doubt that this head belongs to the body
  that was found on the shelf a few yards from here."</p>

  <p>"Then what about the other head?" demanded Miller. "Where is the body
  belonging to that?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "That is another story," said he. "But the
  immediate problem is how these remains are to be disposed of. We can't carry
  them and the gear down to the ambulance without assistance."</p>

  <p>Here the sergeant interposed with a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"There is a big electric station a little farther down the road. If I were
  to run the patrol man down there, he could get on the phone to his
  head-quarters, and perhaps, meanwhile, they could lend us one or two men from
  the works. We've got a folding stretcher in the car."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Miller. "That will do to a T, Sergeant. You cut along as fast
  as you can, and perhaps Mr. Polton might go with you to take charge of the
  patrol man's bicycle."</p>

  <p>As Polton and the sergeant retired along the now plainly visible track,
  Miller turned to Thorndyke with a puzzled and questioning air.</p>

  <p>"I can't quite make this out, Doctor," said he. "You brought us here, as I
  understood, in the expectation of probably finding that poor devil's clothes.
  Had you any expectation of finding anything else?"</p>

  <p>"I thought it probable," replied Thorndyke, "that if we found the clothes,
  we should probably find the head with them. But I certainly did not expect to
  find that body. That came as quite a surprise."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Miller. "A queer coincidence that he should have
  happened to tumble in, just about the same time. Still, he isn't in the
  picture."</p>

  <p>"There," said Thorndyke, "I think you are mistaken I should say that he is
  very much in the picture. My very strong impression is that he is none other
  than the murderer."</p>

  <p>"The murderer!" exclaimed Miller. "What makes you think that? Or are you
  just guessing?"</p>

  <p>"I am considering the obvious probabilities," Thorndyke replied. As he
  spoke, he stooped over the dead man and drew up first the jacket and then the
  waistcoat. As the latter garment rose, there came into view, projecting up
  from within the waist-band of the trousers, the haft of an undeniable Green
  River knife. Thorndyke drew the weapon out of its leather sheath, glanced at
  it and silently held it out for our inspection. No expert eye was needed to
  read its message. The streaks of blackened rust on the blade were distinctive
  enough, but much more so was the shiny black deposit at the junction of the
  steel and the wooden handle.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, as Thorndyke replaced the knife in its sheath, "that
  tells the tale pretty well. And exactly the kind of knife that the doctor
  described at the inquest." He cogitated profoundly for a few moments and then
  asked: "How do you suppose this fellow came to fall into the pit?"</p>

  <p>"I should say," Thorndyke replied, "that the affair happened somewhat in
  this way: The murderer either enticed his victim into this wood, or he
  murdered him elsewhere and brought his body here. We shall probably never
  know which, and it really doesn't matter. Obviously, the murderer knew this
  place pretty well, as we can judge by his acquaintance with the dene hole.
  Having committed the murder, or deposited the body, near the edge of the wood
  close to the road, he stripped the corpse and carried the clothes through the
  wood to the hole and dropped them down. And when we bear in mind that this
  must, almost certainly, have been done at night, we must conclude that, not
  only must the murderer have been familiar with the locality, but he had
  probably planned the crime in advance and reconnoitred the ground.</p>

  <p>"Having dropped the clothes down the pit, he returned to the corpse. And
  now he had the most difficult part of his task to do. He had to detach the
  head; and he had to detach it in a particular way&mdash;and in the dark,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Why did he have to?" Miller asked.</p>

  <p>"Let us leave that question for the moment. It was part of the plan, as
  the case presents itself to me. Well, having detached the head, he dragged
  the nude and headless corpse the short distance to the edge of the cutting
  and pushed it over, knowing that it would roll down only as far as the shelf.
  Then he carried the head to the dene hole.</p>

  <p>"Now, we may assume that he was a man of pretty strong nerves, but, by the
  time he had murdered this man, stripped the corpse and cut off the
  head&mdash;in a public place, mind you, in which discovery was possible at
  any moment&mdash;he must have been considerably shaken. He was walking in the
  dark with the dead man's head in his hands, over ground which, as Jervis can
  testify, is a mass of traps and entanglements. In his terror and agitation he
  probably hurried to get rid of his dreadful burden, and, just as he
  approached the hole, he must have caught his foot in a bramble and fallen,
  sprawling, right into the pit. That is how I picture the course of
  events."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "it sounds pretty convincing as to what probably did
  happen, though I am in the same difficulty as Miller. I don't quite see why
  he did it. Why, for instance, he didn't throw the body, itself, down the
  pit."</p>

  <p>"We must go into that question on another occasion," said Thorndyke; "but
  you will notice that&mdash;but for this investigation of ours&mdash;he did
  actually secure a false identification of the body."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller, "he had us there. We had fairly fixed the body on to
  that Fenchurch Street head."</p>

  <p>Once more the Superintendent fell into a train of cogitation, with a
  speculative eye on the body that lay on the ground at his feet. Suddenly, he
  roused, and, turning to Thorndyke, asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea, Doctor, who these two people are?"</p>

  <p>"I have formed an opinion," was the reply, "and I think it is probably a
  correct opinion. I should say that this," indicating the dead man, "is the
  person known as Bassett, or Dobson, the man who deposited the case of stolen
  platinum at the cloak room; and this man," pointing to the head, "is the one
  who stole the case and left the embalmed head in exchange."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's answer, delivered in calm, matter-of-fact tones, fairly took
  my breath away. I was too astonished to make any comment. And the
  Superintendent was equally taken by surprise, for he, too, stood for a while
  gazing at my colleague without speaking. At length he said&mdash;voicing my
  sentiments as well as his own:</p>

  <p>"This is a knock-out, Doctor! I wasn't aware that you knew anything about
  this case, or were taking any interest in it. Yet you seem to have it all cut
  and dried. Knowing you, I assume that this isn't just a guess. You've got
  something to go on?"</p>

  <p>"In respect of the identification? Certainly. Without going into any other
  matters, there is the appearance of these remains. In both cases it
  corresponds exactly with the description given at the inquest. The man who
  stole the case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And left the box with the human head in it," interpolated Miller. "You
  are ignoring that trivial detail."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke admitted. "We are dealing with the robbery, in which they
  were both concerned. Well, that man was described by the attendant as dark,
  clean-shaved, and having conspicuous gold fillings in both central incisors.
  If you look at that head, you can see the gold fillings plainly enough, as
  well as the other, less distinctive characteristics.</p>

  <p>"In the case of this other man the correspondence is much more striking.
  Here is the long, thin face with the long, thin, pointed nose, curved on the
  bridge, and the dark, nearly black hair. The fair complexion and pale blue
  eye colour are not now clearly distinguishable. But there is one very
  impressive correspondence. You remember that the witness, Mr. Pippet, was
  strongly of opinion that the hair and beard were dyed. Now, if you take my
  lens and examine the roots of the hair and beard, you will see plainly that
  it is light brown hair dyed black."</p>

  <p>Miller and I took the lens in turn and made the examination; with the
  result that the condition was established beyond any possible doubt.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed handing back the lens, "that is dyed hair, right
  enough, and it seems to settle the identification."</p>

  <p>"But we needn't leave it at that," pursued Thorndyke. "The very clothing
  agrees perfectly. There is the blue serge suit, the brown shoes, the wrist
  watch, and the additional pocket watch with its guard of plaited twine."</p>

  <p>He took hold of the latter and drew out of the pocket a large silver watch
  of the kind used by navigators as a "hack watch."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller. "It's a true bill. You are right, Doctor, as you
  always are. These are the two men to a moral certainty."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather strange," said I, "that this man should have gone about
  with his dyed hair and beard and the very clothes that had been described at
  the inquest? He must have known that there would be a hue and cry raised
  after him."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that the explanation is that this affair must
  have taken place within a day or two of the discovery at the station."</p>

  <p>Miller nodded, emphatically. "I'm pretty certain you are right, Doctor,"
  said he. "And that would account for the fact that no trace of these men was
  ever found. We had their descriptions circulated and the police looking for
  them everywhere, but nobody ever got a single glimpse of either of them.
  Naturally enough, as we can see now. They were lying at the bottom of this
  pit."</p>

  <p>At this moment, sounds of trampling through the wood became audible and
  rapidly grew more distinct. At length, the sergeant and Polton emerged into
  the opening, followed by the patrol man and four athletic figures in blue
  dungaree suits, of whom two carried a folded stretcher.</p>

  <p>"I've made all the arrangements, sir," said the sergeant, saluting as he
  addressed the Superintendent. "We can take the remains and the clothing in
  the ambulance and hand them over to the police at Dartford; and the manager
  of the works has kindly lent us a car to take you and the doctors to Dartford
  Station."</p>

  <p>"As to me," said Miller, "I shall go on to Dartford with the ambulance.
  There are two suits of clothes to be examined. I want to go through them
  thoroughly before I return to town. What do you say, Doctor? Are you
  interested in the clothes?"</p>

  <p>"I am interested," Thorndyke replied, "but I don't think I want to take
  part in the examination. I dare say you will let me know if anything of
  importance comes to light."</p>

  <p>"You can trust me for that," said Miller. "Then I take it that you will go
  on to Dartford Station."</p>

  <p>With this, we parted; Miller remaining to superintend the removal of the
  remains and the gear, while Thorndyke, Polton and I retraced our way along
  the well-trodden track down to the road where the manager's car was
  waiting.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; DR. THORNDYKE'S EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE adjourned hearing in the Probate Court opened in an
  atmosphere which the reporters would have described as "tense." The judge had
  not yet learned the result of the exhumation (or he pretended that he hadn't)
  and when Mr. Gimbler took his place in the witness-box, his lordship regarded
  him with very evident interest and curiosity. The examination in chief was
  conducted by Mr. McGonnell's junior, this being the first chance that he had
  got of displaying his forensic skill&mdash;and a mighty small chance at that.
  For Gimbler's evidence amounted to no more than a recital of facts which were
  known to us all (excepting, perhaps, the judge) with certain inevitable
  inferences.</p>

  <p>"You were present at the opening of the vault containing the coffin of
  Josiah Pippet, deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I was."</p>

  <p>"What other persons were present?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gimbler enumerated the persons present and glanced at a list to make
  sure that he had omitted none.</p>

  <p>"When the vault was opened, what was the appearance of the interior?"</p>

  <p>"The whole interior and everything in it was covered with a thick coating
  of dust."</p>

  <p>"Was there any sign indicating that that dust had ever been
  disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"No. The surface of the dust was perfectly smooth and even, without any
  mark or trace of disturbance."</p>

  <p>"What happened when the vault had been opened?"</p>

  <p>"The coffin was brought out and placed upon trestles. Then the screws were
  extracted and the lid was removed in the presence of the persons whom I have
  named."</p>

  <p>"Was the body of deceased in the coffin?"</p>

  <p>"No. There was no body in the coffin."</p>

  <p>"What did the coffin contain?"</p>

  <p>"It contained a roll of sheet lead and certain plumber's oddments; to wit,
  four lumps of lead of a hemispherical shape, such as are formed when molten
  lead sets in a plumber's melting-pot."</p>

  <p>"Do those contents correspond with the traditional description of this
  coffin?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was stated in evidence by Mr. Christopher Pippet that the
  traditional story told to him by his father was to the effect that the coffin
  was weighted with a roll of sheet lead and some plumber's oddments."</p>

  <p>Having elicited this convincing statement, Mr. Klein sat down; and, as
  Anstey made no sign of a wish to cross-examine the witness, Mr. Gimbler
  stepped down from the witness-box with a hardly-disguised smirk, and
  McGonnell rose.</p>

  <p>"That is our case, my lord," said he, and forthwith resumed his seat.
  There was a brief pause. Then Anstey rose and announced:</p>

  <p>"I call witnesses, my lord," a statement that was almost immediately
  followed by the usher's voice, pronouncing the name,</p>

  <p>"Dr. John Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>As my colleague stepped into the witness-box with a small portfolio under
  his arm, I noticed that his appearance was viewed with obvious interest by
  more than one person. The judge seemed to settle himself into a position of
  increased attention, and Mr. McGonnell regarded the new witness critically,
  and, I thought, with slight uneasiness; while Mr. Gimbler, swinging his
  eyeglass pendulum-wise, made a show of being unaware of the witness's
  existence. But I had observed that he had taken in, with one swift glance,
  the fact that the usher had deposited the seven volumes of Josiah's diary, at
  Anstey's request, on the latter's desk. Remembering the double-barrelled
  microscope, I viewed those volumes with sudden interest; which was heightened
  when Anstey picked up one of them, and, opening it, sought a particular page
  and handed the open volume to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"This," said he, "is a volume of the diary which has been identified in
  evidence as the diary of Josiah Pippet. Will you kindly examine the entry
  dated the 8th of October, 1842."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It reads: 'Back to the Fox. Exit G. A. and enter J. P., but not for
  long.'"</p>

  <p>"Have you previously examined that entry?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I examined it at the last hearing very carefully with the naked eye
  and also with the Comparison Microscope invented by Albert S. Osborn of New
  York."</p>

  <p>"Had you any reason for making so critical an examination of this passage
  in the diary?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. As this is the only passage in the diary in which the identity of
  the Earl, George Augustus, with Josiah Pippet is explicitly stated, it seemed
  necessary to make sure that it was really a genuine entry."</p>

  <p>"Had you any further reason?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The position of this entry, after a blank space, made it physically
  possible that it might have been interpolated."</p>

  <p>"And what opinion did you form as a result of your examination?"</p>

  <p>"I formed the opinion that this entry is not part of the original diary,
  but has been interpolated at some later date."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us your reasons for forming that opinion?"</p>

  <p>"My principal reason is that there is a slight difference in colour
  between this entry and the rest of the writing on this page, either preceding
  it or following it. The difference is hardly perceptible to the naked eye. It
  is more perceptible when the writing is looked at through a magnifying lens,
  and it is fairly distinct when examined with the differential
  microscope."</p>

  <p>"Can you explain, quite briefly, the action of the differential, or
  Comparison Microscope?"</p>

  <p>"In effect, this instrument is a pair of microscopes with a single
  eyepiece which is common to both. The two microscopes can be brought to bear
  on two different letters or words on different parts of a page and the two
  magnified images will appear in the field of the eyepiece side by side and
  can be so compared that very delicate differences of form and colour can be
  distinguished."</p>

  <p>"Was your opinion based exclusively on the Comparison Microscope?"</p>

  <p>"No. On observing this difference in colour, I applied for, and received
  the permission of the court to have a photograph of this page made by the
  official photographer. This was done, and I have here two sets of the
  photographs, one set being direct prints from the negative, and the other
  enlargements. In both, but especially in the enlargements, the difference in
  colour is perfectly obvious."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke produced from his portfolio two sets of photographs which
  he delivered to the usher, who passed one pair up to the judge and handed the
  remainder to Mr. McGonnell and the other interested parties, including
  myself. The judge examined the two photographs for some moments with profound
  attention. Then he turned to Thorndyke and asked:</p>

  <p>"Can you explain to us why differences of colour which are hardly
  distinguishable by the eye appear quite distinct in a photograph?"</p>

  <p>"The reason, my lord," replied Thorndyke, "is that the eye and the
  photographic plate are affected by different rays; the eye by the luminous
  rays and the plate by the chemical rays. But these two kinds of rays do not
  vary in the same proportions in different colours. Yellow, for instance,
  which is very luminous, gives off only feeble chemical rays, while blue,
  which is less luminous, gives off very powerful chemical rays. So that a
  yellow device on a rather deep blue ground appears to the eye light upon
  dark, whereas, in a photograph, it appears dark upon light."</p>

  <p>The judge nodded. "Yes," said he, "that makes the matter quite clear."</p>

  <p>"In what way," Anstey resumed, "does this difference in colour support
  your opinion that this passage has been interpolated?"</p>

  <p>"It shows that this passage was written with a different ink from the rest
  of the page."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why Josiah Pippet should not have used a different
  ink in writing this particular passage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. In l842, the date of this entry, there was only one kind of black
  ink in use, excepting the Chinese, or Indian, ink used by draughtsmen, which
  this is obviously not. The common writing ink was made with galls and
  copperas&mdash;sulphate of iron&mdash;without any of the blue colouring which
  is used in modern blue-black ink. This iron-gall ink may have varied slightly
  in colour according to whether it was freshly made or had been exposed to the
  air in an ink-pot. But these differences would disappear in the course of
  years, as the black tannate and gallate of iron changed into the
  reddish-brown oxide; and, there being no difference in composition, there
  would be no difference in the photographic reaction. In my opinion, the
  difference shown in the photographs indicates a difference in composition in
  the two inks. But a difference in composition is irreconcilable with identity
  in the date of this passage and the rest of the page."</p>

  <p>"Would the difference of composition be demonstrable by a chemical
  test?"</p>

  <p>"Probably, but not certainly."</p>

  <p>"You do not question the character of the handwriting?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer to offer no opinion on that. I detected no discrepancy that I
  could demonstrate."</p>

  <p>"And now, coming from matters of opinion to demonstrable fact, what are
  you prepared to swear to concerning this entry in the diary?"</p>

  <p>"That it was written with a different ink from that used in writing the
  rest of the page."</p>

  <p>Having received and noted down this answer, Anstey turned over a leaf of
  his brief and resumed his examination.</p>

  <p>"We will now," said he, "pass on to an entirely different subject. I
  believe that you have made certain investigations in the neighbourhood of
  Winsborough. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, before giving us your results, it might be well if you were to
  tell us, in a general way, what was the object of those investigations and
  what led you to undertake them."</p>

  <p>"It appeared to me," Thorndyke replied, "when I considered the story of
  the double life of Josiah Pippet and the Earl, George Augustus, that,
  although it was not impossible that it might be true, it was highly
  improbable. But it also seemed highly improbable that this story should have
  been invented by Josiah out of his inner consciousness with nothing to
  suggest it or give it a start. It seemed more probable that the story had its
  origin in some peculiar set of circumstances the nature of which might, at
  some later time, be entirely misunderstood. On further consideration, I found
  it possible to imagine a set of circumstances such as might have given rise
  to this kind of misunderstanding. Thereupon, I decided to go down to
  Winsborough and see if I could ascertain, by investigation on the spot,
  whether such circumstances had, in fact, existed."</p>

  <p>"When you went to Winsborough you had certain specific objects in
  view?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I sought to ascertain whether there existed any evidence of the
  birth of Josiah Pippet, as a separate individual, and whether he was, in
  fact, born at the Castle, as alleged. Further, as subsidiary question, I
  proposed to find out, if possible, whether there was, in the neighbourhood,
  any ancient inn of which the sign had been changed within the last eighty
  years."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke gave this last answer, the judge looked at him with a
  slightly puzzled expression. Then a slow smile spread over his face and he
  settled himself comfortably in his chair to listen with renewed
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Did your investigations lead to any discoveries?" Anstey asked.</p>

  <p>"They did," Thorndyke replied. "First, with regard to the inns. There are
  two inns in the village, both of considerable age. One has the sign of the
  Rose and Crown, which is probably the original sign. The other has the sign
  of the Earl of Beaconsfield; but, as this house bears the date, 1602, and was
  evidently built for an inn, and, as Benjamin Disraeli was created Earl of
  Beaconsfield only in 1876, it follows that the sign must have been altered
  since that date. But I could find nobody who knew what the sign had formerly
  been.</p>

  <p>"I next turned my attention to the church register, and first I looked up
  the entry of the 9th of August 1794. On that day there were born in this
  small village no less than three persons. One was George Augustus, the son of
  the Earl of Winsborough, born at Winsborough Castle. The second was Elizabeth
  Blunt, daughter of Thomas Blunt, carpenter, and third was Josiah Bird, son of
  Isabella Bird, spinster, serving-maid to Mr. Nathaniel Pippet of this parish;
  and there was a note to the effect that the said Josiah was born in the house
  of the said Nathaniel Pippet.</p>

  <p>"I followed the entries in the register in search of further information
  concerning these persons. Three years later, on the 6th of June, 1797, there
  was a record of the marriage of Nathaniel Pippet, widower, and Isabella Bird,
  spinster. Two months later, on the 14th of August, 1797, there was recorded
  the death of Nathaniel Pippet of this parish, inn-keeper; and three months
  after this, on the 8th of November, 1797, was an entry recording the birth of
  Susan Pippet, the posthumous daughter of Nathaniel Pippet deceased. This
  child lived only four days, as her death is recorded in an entry dated the
  12th of November, 1797.</p>

  <p>"As none of these entries gave any particulars as to the residence of
  Nathaniel Pippet, I proceeded to explore the churchyard. There I found a
  tombstone the inscription on which set forth that 'Here lieth the body of
  Nathaniel Pippet, late keeper of the Castle Inn in this parish, who departed
  this life the 14th day of August, 1797.' As there was no other entry in the
  register, this must have been the Nathaniel Pippet referred to in the entry
  which I have mentioned. I took a photograph of this tombstone and I produced
  enlarged copies of that photograph."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Thorndyke opened his portfolio and took out a number of
  mounted enlargements which he delivered to the usher, who handed one to the
  judge and passed the others round to the various interested parties. Looking
  round the court, I was amused to note the expressions with which the
  different parties regarded the photograph. The judge inspected it with deep
  interest and an obvious effort to maintain a becoming gravity. So also with
  Brodribb, whose struggles to suppress his feelings produced a conspicuous
  heightening of his naturally florid complexion. Mrs. Engleheart viewed the
  photograph with polite and unsmiling indifference; the young people, Mr.
  Giles and Miss Jenifer (who, for some reason, known only to the usher, had a
  single copy between them), giggled frankly; Mr. Gimbler and his two counsel
  examined the exhibit with wooden-faced attention. The only person who made no
  attempt to "conceal or cloak" his amusement was Mr. Christopher Pippet; who
  inspected the photograph through horn-rimmed spectacles and laughed
  joyously.</p>

  <p>When the photograph reached me the cause of his hilarity became apparent.
  It happens often enough that the designs on ancient rural tombstones are such
  as tend "to produce in the sinful a smile." But it was not the work of the
  artless village mason that was the cause of Mr. Pippet's amusement. The joke
  was in the inscription, which ran thus:</p>

<p><a id="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

    <img src="1000181h-images/1000181h-02.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">The Tombstone</p>
</div>
<br>

  <blockquote>
    "Here lyeth ye Bodey of NATHANIEL PIPPET late Keeper of The<br>
    CASTLE INN in this Parish who Departed this<br>
    Life ye 14th Day of August in ye Year of Our Lord<br>
    1797 Aged 58 years.<br>
    <br>
    "He was an Honest Man and a good Inn Keeper who sold no Ale but the
    Best.<br>
    <br>
    "He that buys Land buys Stones<br>
    He that buys Meate buys Bones<br>
    He that buys Egges buys Many Shelles<br>
    But He that buys Good Beer buys Nothing Elles."
  </blockquote>

  <p>The verses were certainly unconventional and tended to engender the
  suspicion that the jovial Nathaniel might have embodied them in certain
  testamentary dispositions. But, however that may have been, the inscription
  was profoundly significant.</p>

  <p>Having given time for the inspection of the photographs, Anstey resumed
  his examination.</p>

  <p>"What inferences do you deduce from these facts which you have
  discovered?" he asked. But, at this point, Mr. McGonnell rose and objected
  that the witness's inferences were not evidence.</p>

  <p>"The learned counsel is technically correct," said the judge, "and I must
  allow his objection if he insists; though, in the case of an expert witness,
  where an investigation has been made <i>ad hoc,</i> it is customary to allow
  the witness to explain the bearing of the facts which he has elicited."</p>

  <p>The learned counsel was, however, disposed to insist and the question was
  accordingly ruled out.</p>

  <p>"Apart from any inferences," said Anstey, "what facts have your
  investigations disclosed?"</p>

  <p>"They have disclosed the fact," replied Thorndyke, "that on the 9th of
  August, 1794, the day on which the Earl, George Augustus was born at
  Winsborough Castle, there was born at 'The Castle' at Winsborough an
  individual named Josiah whose mother subsequently married Nathaniel
  Pippet."</p>

  <p>"That fact is the sum of what you discovered?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And what relation does that bear to the imaginary set of circumstances of
  which you have told us?"</p>

  <p>"The circumstances that thus came to light were substantially identical
  with those which I had postulated theoretically."</p>

  <p>Anstey noted down this answer and then proceeded:</p>

  <p>"You were present at the exhumation of the coffin of Josiah Pippet with
  the other persons who have been mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"I was."</p>

  <p>"Did the appearances which you observed seem to you to agree with the
  conditions which were assumed to exist&mdash;that this coffin had lain
  undisturbed in this vault for eighty years?"</p>

  <p>"No. In my opinion, the appearances were not reconcilable with that
  assumption."</p>

  <p>"In what respect did the appearances disagree with the ostensible
  conditions?"</p>

  <p>"There were three respects in which the appearances disagreed with the
  conditions which were assumed to exist. The disagreements were concerned with
  the dust in the vault, the coffin, and the contents of the coffin."</p>

  <p>"Let us take those disagreements in order. First, as to the dust. Do you
  say that there were signs that it had been disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"No. The dust that was there had not been disturbed since it was
  deposited. But it had not the characteristics of ancient dust, or of any dust
  which might have become deposited in a vault above ground which was situated
  in an open burial ground, remote from any dwelling house."</p>

  <p>"What are the distinguishing peculiarities of such ancient dust?"</p>

  <p>"The dust which would be deposited in a vault over a period of eighty
  years would consist of very light and minute particles of matter, such as
  would be capable of floating in still air. There would be no mineral
  particles excepting excessively minute particles of the lighter minerals, and
  very few of these. Practically the whole of the dust would consist of tiny
  fragments of organic matter, of which a large part would be derived from
  textiles. As these fragments would be of all sorts of colours, the resulting
  dust would be of no colour at all; that is to say, of a perfectly neutral
  grey. But this dust was not of a perfectly neutral grey. It had a very faint
  tinge of red; and this extremely faint tinge of colour was distinguishable in
  the whole of the dust, not only in one part. I accordingly took two samples
  for examination, one from the coffin and one from the shelf on which it
  rested; and I have since made a microscopical examination of each of these
  samples separately."</p>

  <p>"And what conclusion did you arrive at as a result of your
  examination?"</p>

  <p>"I came to the conclusion that the whole of this dust had been derived
  from a single room. That room was covered with a carpet which had a red
  ground with a pattern principally of green and blue with a little black.
  There was also in this room a cotton drapery of some kind&mdash;either a
  table-cloth or curtains&mdash;dyed a darkish blue."</p>

  <p>"Those are your conclusions. Can you give us the actual facts which you
  observed?"</p>

  <p>"On examining the dust through the microscope, I observed that it
  consisted chiefly of woollen fibres dyed a bright red. There were also
  woollen fibres dyed green and blue, but smaller in number than the red, and a
  still smaller number of woollen fibres dyed black, together with a few cotton
  fibres dyed a darkish blue. In addition to the fibres there were rather
  numerous particles of coal and some other minerals, very small in size, but
  much too large to float in still air. I have here two samples of the dust
  mounted and arranged in small hand microscopes. On holding the microscopes up
  to the light, it is quite easy to see the fibres which I have described and
  also one or two particles of coal."</p>

  <p>He handed the two little instruments (in which I recognized the handiwork
  of the ingenious and indefatigable Polton) to the usher, who passed them up
  to the judge. His lordship examined each of them with deep interest and then
  returned them to the usher, by whom they were handed, first to McGonnell and
  then to the other parties to the case. Eventually, they came to me; and I was
  surprised to see how efficiently these little instruments served their
  purpose. On turning them towards the window, the coloured fibres were visible
  with brilliant distinctness, in spite of the low magnification. And their
  appearance, corresponding exactly with Thorndyke's description, was
  absolutely convincing, as I gathered from the decidedly glum expression that
  began to spread over Mr. McGonnell's countenance.</p>

  <p>When the dust had been inspected, Anstey resumed his examination.</p>

  <p>"Can you account for the presence of this dust in the vault?"</p>

  <p>"Only in general terms. Since it was obviously not derived from anything
  in the vault, itself, or the immediate neighbourhood of the vault, it must
  have been brought there from some other place."</p>

  <p>"Can you suggest a method of procedure which would have produced the
  appearances which you observed?"</p>

  <p>"A possible method, and the one which I have no doubt was employed, would
  be this: First, the sweepings from the room, or more probably the
  accumulations from the receiver of a vacuum-cleaner, would be collected and
  conveyed to the vault. There, the dust could be blown into the air of the
  upper part of the vault by means of a vacuum-cleaner with the valve reversed,
  or more conveniently by means of a common pair of bellows, the dust being fed
  into the valve-hole. If it were blown up towards the roof, it would float in
  the air and settle down slowly, falling eventually in a perfectly even manner
  on the coffin, the shelf, and the floor, producing exactly the appearance
  that was seen."</p>

  <p>"You are not prepared to swear that this was the method actually
  employed?"</p>

  <p>"No; but it would be a possible method, and I cannot think of any
  other."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Anstey, "the method is not important. We will let it go and
  come to another matter.</p>

  <p>"You referred to three discrepancies in the appearances; the dust, the
  coffin, and the contents of the latter. In what way did the coffin disagree
  with the ostensible conditions?"</p>

  <p>"The coffin was assumed to have been lying undisturbed in the vault for
  eighty years. That was not the case. If this was the original coffin, it had
  certainly been opened and re-closed since the year 1854."</p>

  <p>"How are you able to fix the date so exactly?"</p>

  <p>"By the screws with which the lid was fastened down. These screws are in
  the possession of Detective-Superintendent Miller, who is now in court."</p>

  <p>Here the Superintendent rose, and, producing an envelope, handed it to the
  usher, who passed it up to the judge. He then evicted Thorndyke from the
  witness-box, and, taking his place, was duly sworn, and, in reply to a
  question from Anstey, declared that the screws in the envelope were the
  screws which had been extracted in his presence from the coffin of Josiah
  Pippet.</p>

  <p>The judge opened the envelope and tipped the screws out into the palm of
  his hand. Then he remarked&mdash;in almost the very words that I had heard
  the Superintendent use&mdash;that he did not see anything at all unusual
  about them. "To my unsophisticated eye," he concluded, "they look like the
  kind of screws that one could buy at any ironmonger's."</p>

  <p>"That, my lord," said Thorndyke&mdash;who had, in his turn, evicted the
  Superintendent and resumed his place in the witness-box&mdash;"is exactly
  what they are, and that is the fact which gives them their evidential
  importance. This coffin was supposed to have been screwed down in the year
  1843. But in that year you could <i>not</i> have bought screws like these at
  any ironmonger's. There were no such screws in existence. At that time, wood
  screws were like metal screws, excepting as to their threads. They were
  flat-ended, so that, in order to drive them in, it was necessary to bore a
  hole as deep as the screw was long. But, about 1850, an American inventor
  devised and patented a sharp-pointed, or gimlet-ended screw, which would find
  its own way through wood, regardless of the depth of the hole. Later, he came
  to England to dispose of his patent rights, and in 1854 he sold them to
  Chamberlain and Nettlefolds, who thereupon acquired the virtual monopoly of
  the manufacture of wood screws; for, owing to the great superiority of the
  sharp-pointed screw, the old, blunt-ended screw went completely out of use. I
  am able, by the kindness of the Master of the Worshipful Company of
  Ironmongers, to show a set of the old type of screws, the date of manufacture
  being 1845."</p>

  <p>Here he produced a wooden tablet to which were secured six screws of
  various sizes with blunt, flattened ends like the screws still used by metal
  workers. The tablet was passed up to the judge, who inspected it curiously
  and compared the screws on it with those from the envelope.</p>

  <p>"It is always easy," he moralized, "to be wise after the event; but it
  does really seem astonishing that mankind should have had to wait until 1854
  for so obvious an improvement."</p>

  <p>With this he returned the coffin screws to the envelope and handed the
  latter and the museum tablet to the usher, who proceeded to pass them round
  for inspection. I watched their progress with considerable interest, noting
  their effect on the different parties to the case. Particularly interested
  was I to observe the expression on Mr. McGonnell's face as he compared the
  two exhibits. There was no question as to his recognition of their
  significance; and, by the flush that rose to his face, and the unmistakeable
  expression of anger, I judged that Mr. Gimbler had not taken him into his
  confidence and that these revelations were coming to him as a very
  disagreeable surprise.</p>

  <p>When the screws had been inspected by the principal parties, Anstey
  resumed his examination.</p>

  <p>"When you stated the latest date at which this coffin could have been
  screwed down, you used the qualification, 'If this <i>was</i> the original
  coffin.' Did you mean to express a doubt that this was the original
  coffin?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My opinion is that it is not the original coffin, but a new one to
  which the brass name plate and other metal 'furniture' from the original
  coffin have been screwed. The plate and handles appeared to me to be the
  original ones, and they appeared to be fastened on with the original brass
  screws. The slots of those screws showed clear indications of their having
  been unscrewed quite recently."</p>

  <p>"What were your reasons for believing that this was a new coffin rather
  than the old one, opened and reclosed?"</p>

  <p>"There were several reasons. First, there were the screws. These were
  modern screws, apparently artificially rusted. At any rate, they were rusty.
  But if the original coffin had been opened and re-closed, it would be natural
  for the screws which had been extracted to be used to fasten down the lid.
  There would be no object in obtaining rusty screws to use in their place.
  Then the coffin did not look old. It was much discoloured; but the
  discolouration did not look like the effect of age but rather like that of
  staining. Further, the coffin was covered, both inside and out with a thick
  coating of mildew. But there was nothing to account for this mildew. The wood
  was not damp, and it had the character of new wood. The mildew had the
  appearance of having been produced artificially by coating the surface with
  some substance such as size, mixed with sugar or glycerine. Moreover, on the
  assumption that some substitution had been made&mdash;which all the
  appearances indicated&mdash;it would obviously be more convenient to use a
  new coffin than to open and remove the contents of the old, particularly if
  the old one should have happened to contain a body. But that is a matter of
  inference. Taking only the appearances observed, I consider that they
  indicated that this was a new coffin."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Anstey, "we now come to the third set of disagreements, the
  contents of the coffin. What have you to tell us about those?"</p>

  <p>"The contents of the coffin," Thorndyke replied, "were, according to the
  traditional account, a roll of sheet lead and some plumber's oddments, which
  had been left over from some repairs. Now, sheet lead, removed in l843, or
  earlier, from the roof of a house, would, even then, be old lead. It would
  certainly be cast sheet&mdash;cast upon a sand casting table; and it would
  certainly contain a considerable proportion of silver. But the sheet of lead
  which was found in the coffin was the ordinary milled sheet which has, in
  recent times, replaced the old cast sheet. As to the amount of silver that it
  contained, I could form no opinion. I therefore suggested that an assay
  should be made to ascertain the silver content. This proposal was contested
  by Mr. Gimbler on the ground that we had no authority to make an assay, and
  by Mr. McGonnell on the ground that the evidence was of a kind that would not
  be taken seriously by the court. And Mr. Brodribb objected, apparently on the
  ground that the proceeding would seem to throw doubt on the good faith of the
  applicant. Accordingly, I did not press my proposal, but I made a careful
  examination of the contents of the coffin, with very surprising results. in
  addition to the sheet lead, the coffin contained four hemispherical lumps of
  metal which had apparently solidified in a plumber's melting pot, which we
  may call pot-leavings. There were four of these; one large and three smaller.
  The large one had the appearance and all the visible and palpable properties
  of lead, and I had no doubt that it was lead. The other three were evidently
  not lead, but had the appearance and properties of an alloy of lead and some
  other metal."</p>

  <p>"Bid you form any opinion as to the nature of the other metal?"</p>

  <p>"I did, but with the reservation that the inference seemed so incredible
  that I was doubtful about accepting it."</p>

  <p>"What was the opinion that you formed as to the nature of these lumps of
  lead alloy?"</p>

  <p>"I was forced to the conclusion that they were composed of an alloy of
  lead and platinum."</p>

  <p>"Platinum!" exclaimed the judge. "But is not platinum a very rare and
  precious metal?"</p>

  <p>"It is always a precious metal," Thorndyke replied, "and since the war it
  has become extremely scarce and its value has gone up to an extravagant
  extent. At present, it is several times more valuable than gold."</p>

  <p>"And how much platinum did you consider to be present in these lumps of
  alloy?" the judge asked.</p>

  <p>"I estimated the weight of the three lumps together at about a
  hundredweight, and, about half that weight appeared to be platinum."</p>

  <p>"Half a hundredweight of platinum!" exclaimed the judge. "It does indeed
  seem incredible. Why, it is a fortune. What do you suppose the value of that
  amount would be?"</p>

  <p>"At the present inflated prices," replied Thorndyke, "I should put it at
  anything from fifteen to seventeen thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"It is beyond belief," said the judge. "However, we shall see," and with
  this he sat back in his chair and glanced at Anstey.</p>

  <p>"As this opinion seems to be so utterly incredible, even to yourself,"
  said Anstey, resuming his examination, "perhaps you might explain to us how
  you arrived at it."</p>

  <p>"It was principally a question of weight," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"But," said Anstey, "have you had sufficient experience to be able to
  detect platinum in an alloy by the sense of weight to the hand?"</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke answered, "but it was not a case of absolute weight, or I
  should have been still less confident. There was a term of comparison. When I
  picked up the big lump, it felt just as I should expect a lump of lead of
  that size to feel. But when I then picked up the first of the smaller ones, I
  received a shock; for, though it was little more than half the size of the
  big one, it was nearly as heavy. Now, there are not many metals that are much
  heavier than lead. For practical purposes, ignoring the rare metals, there
  are only two&mdash;gold and platinum. This did not look like gold, but it
  might have been; a mass of gold, for instance, with a lead casing. On the
  other hand, its colour&mdash;a faint, purplish grey&mdash;was exactly that of
  a lead-platinum alloy. So there seemed to be no escape from the conclusion
  that that was what it was."</p>

  <p>While this evidence was being given, I kept my eyes on Mr. Gimbler and his
  leading counsel. The latter listened in undisguised astonishment and little
  less disguised displeasure. Obviously, he had begun to smell a rat; and, as
  it was not his rat, he naturally resented its presence. But even Gimbler
  failed to maintain the aspect of wooden indifference that he had preserved
  hitherto. This disclosure had evidently sprung on him a complete surprise;
  and, as I looked at him and noted the dismay which he struggled in vain to
  conceal, I found myself wondering whether, by any chance, the expression of
  consternation on his face might have some significance other than mere
  surprise. But my speculations were cut short by Anstey, who was continuing
  his examination.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything more to tell us about the contents of this coffin?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "That is all the information that I have to
  give."</p>

  <p>On receiving this reply, Anstey sat down and McGonnell was rising to
  cross-examine when the judge interposed.</p>

  <p>"Before we pass on to other matters," said he, "we ought to be a little
  more clear about the nature of this metal which was found in the coffin. That
  is a question which is highly relevant to the issues which are before the
  court. But it is also relevant to certain other issues concerned with public
  policy. Dr. Thorndyke is not prepared to say definitely that this is actually
  platinum; but he is evidently convinced&mdash;and on apparently sufficient
  grounds&mdash;that it is. But the question cannot be left at that. It can be
  settled with certainty, and it should be. Do I understand that this metal,
  worth, possibly, many thousands of pounds, is still lying in that
  coffin?"</p>

  <p>This question was addressed to Thorndyke, who accordingly replied:</p>

  <p>"No, my lord. As my proposal of an assay was rejected, and in view of the
  questions of public policy to which your lordship has referred, I informed
  Mr. Superintendent Miller that, in my opinion, an examination of the
  pot-leavings would yield information of great importance to the police. The
  Superintendent thereupon took possession of the whole of the contents of the
  coffin and conveyed them to the premises of Mr. Daniels, the eminent
  assayist, and left them there for an assay to be made."</p>

  <p>"And has an assay been made?" the judge asked.</p>

  <p>"I believe it has, my lord, but I have no information as to the result.
  Mr. Superintendent Miller is now in court."</p>

  <p>Here the Superintendent rose and approached the solicitor's table carrying
  a small but obviously heavy box, which he laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"I think," said the judge, "that what the Superintendent has to tell us
  should go in evidence."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Miller once more evicted Thorndyke from the witness-box, and
  the judge continued: "You have already been sworn, Superintendent. Will you
  now give the <i>facts,</i> so far as they are known to you, concerning the
  contents of this coffin?"</p>

  <p>The Superintendent stood at "attention" and delivered himself of his
  evidence with a readiness born of long practice.</p>

  <p>"In consequence of certain information communicated by Dr. Thorndyke, I
  took possession of the contents of the coffin alleged to be that of Josiah
  Pippet deceased and conveyed them forthwith to the premises of Mr. Daniels in
  Bishopsgate and delivered them to him with instructions to make a trial assay
  and report to me what he found. On the same evening, I received a report from
  him in which he informed me that he had ascertained the following
  facts:&mdash; the roll of sheet lead was practically pure lead almost
  completely free from silver, and was probably of recent manufacture. The
  large pot-leaving was also pure lead of the modern silver-free type. The
  three smaller pot-leavings were composed of a lead-platinum alloy, of which
  about half by weight was platinum. On receiving this report, I directed Mr.
  Daniels to recover the whole of the platinum in a pure state and deliver it
  to me. He did this, and I have here, in the box on the table, the platinum
  which I received from him and which he assured me is practically the whole of
  the platinum which was contained in the pot-leavings. It amounts, roughly, to
  just under half a hundredweight."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, he stepped down from the witness-box, and, approaching
  the table, unlocked a small padlock of the Yale type by which the hasp of the
  box was secured and opened the lid. Then, from the interior, he lifted out,
  one after another, eight little bright, silvery-looking bars, or ingots, and
  laid them in a row on the table. Picking up the end one, he handed it up to
  the judge; who weighed it in the palm of his hand, looking at it with a faint
  smile of amusement. When he received it back from the judge, Miller carried
  it round the court and allowed each of the interested parties to take it in
  his hand; and, when it came to my turn, and the Superintendent handed it to
  me (with something exceedingly like a wink, and a sly glance at Thorndyke), I
  understood the judge's smile. There was something ridiculous in the monstrous
  disproportion between the size of the little bar and its weight; for, small
  as it was, it had the weight of a good-sized iron dumbell.</p>

  <p>When Miller had returned the bars to the box and locked the padlock, he
  went back to the witness-box to await further questions or cross-examination;
  but, as neither of the counsel made any sign, the judge dismissed him and
  then announced the adjournment of the hearing. "I regret," he added, "that,
  in consequence of other and more urgent business, it will have to be
  adjourned for a week. The delay is unfortunate; but," here he glanced at
  McGonnell with a faint smile, "it will have the advantage that learned
  counsel will have time to consider their cross-examination of Dr.
  Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>Hereupon the court rose and we all prepared to take our departure.
  Glancing at "the other side," I observed Mr. Pippet looking a little
  wistfully in our direction as if he would have liked to come and speak to us.
  But apparently his native wisdom and good sense told him that the occasion
  was inopportune, and, after a momentary hesitation, he turned away with a
  somewhat troubled face and followed his legal representatives out of the
  court.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; A JOURNEY AND A DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="first">"THIS adjournment," remarked the Superintendent as he
  attached a strong leather rug-strap to his precious box, "is a piece of luck
  for me&mdash;at least I am hoping that it is. You'll have tomorrow free I
  suppose, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I have got plenty to do tomorrow," Thorndyke answered, "but I haven't any
  appointments, as I expected to be here. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Miller, "I have had a bit of luck of another sort. I
  told you that the suspected yacht was laid up in Benfleet Creek with her
  hatches sealed and a local boat-builder told off to keep an eye on her. Well,
  it seems that this man&mdash;his name is Jaff&mdash;spotted some Johnnie
  trying to break into her in the cool of the evening, about eleven p.m. So Mr.
  Jaff collared the said Johnnie after a bit of a tussle, and handed him over
  to the local police.</p>

  <p>"Then the police had a brain-wave&mdash;quite a good one too. They phoned
  down to Southend for the Customs officers who had rummaged the yacht when she
  arrived from her voyage. So the Preventive men&mdash;there were two of
  them&mdash;hopped into the train and came over to have a look at the chappie
  who had been nabbed; and they both recognized him, at once, as one of the
  three men they had seen on board the yacht when they rummaged her. And one of
  them remembered his name&mdash;Bunter; and when it was mentioned, he didn't
  deny it, though he had given a false name, as the police had already assumed,
  when he said it was John Smith. Of course, there are people in the world
  named John Smith. Plenty of them. But the crook is apt to exaggerate the
  number.</p>

  <p>"Well, when we got notice of the capture, we thought at first of having
  him sent up to the Yard to see if we could get a statement from him. But then
  I thought it would be better for me to go down and have a talk with him on
  the spot and just have a look at the yacht at the same time. And that's where
  you come in; at least I hope you do, as you seem to be like one of those
  blooming spiders that I've heard about that have got eyes all over them. What
  do you say? I think you would find it an interesting little jaunt."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke appeared to think so, too, for he accepted the invitation at
  once and included me in the acceptance, as I also had the day at my disposal.
  Accordingly, we settled the program, much to the Superintendent's
  satisfaction, and, having arranged to meet on the following morning at
  Fenchurch Street Station, we escorted Miller, with his precious burden, to
  his car and bade him <i>au revoir</i>.</p>

  <p>"I agree with Miller," said I, as, having achieved the perilous crossing
  of the Strand, we strolled towards the Temple Gate. "This is a bit of luck. A
  nice little trip to the seaside instead of a day in that stuffy court. And it
  will probably be quite amusing."</p>

  <p>"I hope it will be more than amusing," said Thorndyke. "We ought to be
  able to pick up some useful facts. We want them badly enough, f or there are
  a lot of gaps that we have to fill up."</p>

  <p>"What gaps are you referring to?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "look at our case as it stands. It is a mere
  collection of disconnected facts. And yet we know that those facts must be
  connected, and that we have got to establish the connexion. Take this
  platinum, for instance. It disappears from the cloak room and is lost to view
  utterly. Then it reappears in the coffin; and the problem is, how did it get
  there, where has it been in the interval, and what is Gimbler's connexion
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't we rather guessing about that platinum?" I objected. "We all seem
  to be assuming that this platinum is the platinum that was stolen."</p>

  <p>"And reasonably so, I think," said Thorndyke. "Consider the probabilities,
  Jervis. If it had been a case of an ounce, or even a pound, there might have
  been room for doubt. But half a hundredweight, at a time when every grain of
  platinum is precious and worth many times its weight of gold, and at a time
  when that very weight of platinum has been stolen and is still
  missing&mdash;well, we may be mistaken, but we are justified in accepting the
  overwhelming probabilities. And, after all, it is only a working
  hypothesis."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "I suppose you are right; and we shall soon know if you
  are on the wrong track. But you are also assuming that Gimbler has some
  connexion with it. You haven't much to go on."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "You are a regular Devil's advocate, Jervis," said he.
  "But you are right, so far. We haven't much to go on. Still, I suppose you
  will agree that we have fair grounds for assuming that Gimbler has some
  connexion with that bogus coffin."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I was forced to admit, "I will concede that much, as the coffin
  appears to have been planted there to furnish evidence in support of his
  case. But I am not so clear as to the connexion between Gimbler and that
  platinum. He seemed mighty surprised when you mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"He did," Thorndyke agreed; "and there is certainly something extremely
  odd about the whole affair. But you see the position. Gimbler arranges for a
  dummy coffin to be planted, and that dummy coffin is found to contain the
  proceeds of a robbery. There is thus established a connexion of some sort
  between Gimbler and this stolen property. We cannot guess the nature of the
  connexion. It may be of the most indirect kind. Apparently, Gimbler had no
  suspicion of the nature of the metal in the coffin. But some kind of
  connexion between that loot and Mr. Gimbler there must be. And it is not
  impossible that the platinum may eventually be the means of pointing the way
  to some unguarded spot in Gimbler's defences; for I take it that there will
  be considerable difficulty in getting direct evidence of his part in the
  planting of the coffin."</p>

  <p>His conclusion brought us to our doorstep, at which point the discussion
  lapsed. But I felt that it was only an adjournment; for something in the
  Superintendent's manner had suggested to me that he, also, had certain
  questions to propound.</p>

  <p>And so it turned out. On our arrival on the platform at Fenchurch Street,
  I perceived the Superintendent doing "sentry-go" before the door of an empty
  first-class smoking compartment, and I suspected that he had made certain
  private arrangements with the guard. At any rate, we had the compartment to
  ourselves, and when we had passed the first few stations in safety, he
  proceeded to fire his first shot.</p>

  <p>"I've been puzzling my brains, Doctor, about those pot-leavings."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Thorndyke. "What is the difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"The difficulty is how the deuce they became pot-leavings. I have always
  understood that platinum was almost impossible to melt. Isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>"Platinum is very difficult to melt," Thorndyke agreed. "It has the
  highest melting-point of all metals, excepting one or two of the rare metals.
  The melting-point is 1710 Centigrade."</p>

  <p>"And what is the melting-point of cast iron?"</p>

  <p>"1505 Centigrade," Thorndyke answered.</p>

  <p>"Then," exclaimed Miller, "if it takes about two hundred degrees more to
  melt platinum than it does to melt iron, how the devil was it possible to
  melt the platinum in a common plumber's melting-pot which is made of cast
  iron? It would seem as if the pot should melt before the platinum."</p>

  <p>"So it would, of course, if the metal had been pure," Thorndyke replied
  with a smile that suggested to me that he had been expecting the question,
  and that something of importance turned on it. "But it was not pure. It was
  an alloy; and alloys exhibit all kinds of queer anomalies in respect to their
  melting-points. However, with your permission, we will postpone the
  discussion of this point, as we shall have to consider it in connexion with
  certain other matters that we have to discuss. You have not told us whether
  those clothes from the two dead men yielded any information."</p>

  <p>"They gave us the means of identifying the two men, as you will have
  learned from the reports of the inquest; and the names were apparently their
  real names, or at least their usual aliases. The murderer, Bassett, the
  skipper of the yacht, was a local man, as you guessed. He lived at
  Swanscombe, and seems to have been a Swanscombe man, which accounts, as you
  suggested, for his knowledge of the dene hole. The man he killed, Wicks, was
  living at Woolwich at the time, but he seemed to be a bird of passage. That
  is all that I got out of the clothes excepting the name and address of a man
  called Samuels, who describes himself as a gold refiner and bullion dealer,
  but who may be a fence. We know him by name, but we haven't anything against
  him, though we bear him in mind. These small bullion dealers have to be kept
  in view, as they have so many facilities for getting rid of stolen jewellery
  and plate."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed; "and, in the special circumstances, any refiner
  and bullion dealer is of interest to us. It seems likely that Bassett
  intended to approach this man, Samuels, on the object of the disposal of the
  platinum, if he hadn't already made some arrangements with him. You'll have
  to continue to keep Mr. Samuels in view. But now tell us a little more about
  this present business."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much more to tell you," said Miller. "It seems that Mr. Jaff,
  the boat-builder gent, was cruising about Benfleet Creek in his
  dinghy&mdash;he lives afloat, himself&mdash;when he saw our friend, Bunter,
  trying to prise open the yacht's fore scuttle; whereupon, having a natural
  prejudice against people who break into yachts, he pulled alongside, stepped
  on board, and, creeping silently along the deck in his rubber mud-boots,
  grabbed Bunter and hauled him into his dinghy, where they seem to have had a
  mighty scrap until another mariner came along and lent a hand. Then they got
  him ashore and handed him over to the local police as I have told you."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose could have been his object in trying to break into
  the vessel?" I asked. "There wasn't anything of value left on board, was
  there?"</p>

  <p>"There was not supposed to be," said Miller, with a knowing look, "but I
  have an idea that there may have been. My notion is that there may have been
  more platinum than we thought, and that he had come to snap up what was left.
  What do you say, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "I don't think so, Miller," he replied. "You
  have recovered practically all the platinum that was said to have been
  stolen. My impression is that, as our friend Mr. Pippet might express it, you
  are barking up the wrong tree."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" said Miller. "Then if you will point out the right tree, I'll bark
  up that. What do you think was his object in trying to break in?"</p>

  <p>"My idea is," Thorndyke replied, "that he supposed that the whole of the
  platinum was still on board."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Miller, "how could he? He knew that Bassett had carted
  the bulk of it away."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "My impression is, Miller," said he, "that it was at
  this point that the chapter of accidents began; and it is here that the
  answer to the question that you raised just now comes in."</p>

  <p>"About the melting-pot?" demanded Miller.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have a theory that the whole mystery of the murder and the
  appearance of the platinum in the coffin hinges on that question. Perhaps, as
  we have some time at our disposal, there would be no harm in my giving the
  reins to my fancy and sketching out my hypothetical scheme of the events as I
  believe they occurred."</p>

  <p>"Do, by all means," Miller exclaimed, eagerly, "for, if your imaginary
  scheme satisfies you, it is likely to satisfy me."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I will begin with what I believe to have been the
  hiding-place in which the platinum was concealed on the yacht."</p>

  <p>"But, good Lord, Doctor" Miller exclaimed, "you've never seen the
  yacht!"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't necessary," Thorndyke replied. "I had your description of the
  yacht and of the search made by the Customs officer, and they seemed to me to
  indicate an excellent hiding-place. When you described how that officer crept
  down into the hold and found it all perfectly clear and empty with the
  exception of the lead ballast-weights, it occurred to me that it was quite
  possible that the platinum was staring him in the face all the time. Remember
  that he was not looking for platinum but for tobacco."</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that the platinum was hidden in the ballast-weights?"
  Miller demanded.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I do suggest," replied Thorndyke; "and I will
  describe to you what I believe to have been the method used in concealing it.
  You will remember that these weights were proper yacht's ballast; lead
  weights cast to a correct shape to fit the timbers and sits comfortably along
  the kelson. Each would probably weight about half a hundredweight, that being
  the usual and most convenient weight. Now, my theory is that our friends took
  with them a mould of the ballast-weights&mdash;an ordinary sand-flask would
  do, though a fireclay mould would be more convenient&mdash;so that they could
  cast new weights whenever they might want them. Possibly they also took some
  spare lead with them.</p>

  <p>"Now, as soon as they had got possession of the platinum&mdash;which, you
  will remember, was in thin sheets&mdash;they cut it up into suitably sized
  pieces, or rolled or folded it up to a size that would go easily into the
  mould. They put the pieces into the mould, probably propping them up a little
  with some pieces of lead to keep them off the bottom, so that the platinum
  should not be visible on the surface. Then they melted some spare lead, or
  one of the ballast-weights and poured the molten lead into the mould. When
  the lead set solid, there would be a quite ordinary-looking ballast-weight.
  Then they did the same with the rest of the platinum, producing a second
  ballast-weight; and the two could be laid down with the rest of the weights
  alongside the keel. If there was any lead left over, that would be thrown
  overboard together with the mould."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, "that sounds quite convincing. Deuced ingenious, too.
  Uncommonly neat. That's how they were able to walk past the customs in the
  way they did. But where does the chapter of accidents come in?"</p>

  <p>"It came in at that point," said Thorndyke. "Somebody had made a trifling
  miscalculation. I don't say that Bassett made the mistake, though I suspect
  that he did. But someone did. You know, Miller, as well as I do that people
  who embark on a fake of any kind need to have a good deal of knowledge. And
  usually they haven't. Our friend, Gimbler, didn't know enough about dust; and
  the craftsman who made the bogus coffin didn't know enough about screws. And
  I suspect that the downy bird who invented the ballast-weight dodge didn't
  know enough about platinum.</p>

  <p>"The rock, I think, on which these gentry split was this: most people
  know, as you know, that platinum is one of the most infusible of metals. It
  cannot be melted in any ordinary furnace. Only a very special furnace, or the
  most powerful type of blowpipe will melt it. Now, to a person who knew that,
  and no more, it would naturally seem that platinum, put into a mould and then
  covered up with melted lead, would simply be imbedded in lead. And, since
  lead is very easily fusible&mdash;it melts at the comparatively low
  temperature of 325&deg; Centigrade&mdash;it would naturally seem that, when it
  was required to recover the platinum, all that would be necessary would be to
  melt the lead weight and pick out the platinum."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller; "that seems perfectly feasible. What's the
  snag?"</p>

  <p>"The snag is," replied Thorndyke, "that platinum has one most singular
  property. Everyone knows that you can melt lead in an iron ladle or pot; and
  it would be quite natural to infer that, since platinum is more difficult to
  melt than iron, it would be equally easy to melt lead in a platinum ladle or
  pot. But the inference would be quite wrong. If you were to try to melt lead
  in a platinum pot, the bottom of the pot would drop out. In spite of its
  enormously high melting-point, platinum dissolves freely in melted lead."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it does!" exclaimed Miller. "That is most extraordinary."</p>

  <p>"It is," Thorndyke agreed; "and it is a property of the metal that would
  be totally unexpected by anyone who did not happen to know it. And now you
  will see how this curious fact affects our problem. Supposing the platinum to
  have been put into the mould as I have described, and the melted lead poured
  in on top of it; and supposing the thieves&mdash;or some of them&mdash;to be
  unacquainted with this property of the metal. They would expect, as I have
  said, that when they wanted to recover the platinum, all they would have to
  do would be to melt the lead weight and pick out the platinum with tongs.</p>

  <p>"Now our friend Wicks, who made the exchange at the cloak room was
  evidently 'in the know.' He knew what was in the case that he stole; and he
  had come to get that case. The relic that he left in exchange was, I feel
  sure, merely a by-product. It may even have furnished the means or the
  suggestion for the exchange. Obviously, he had the thing on his hands, and it
  was the kind of thing that he would naturally wish to get rid of; and, if he
  was able to get a suitable case, as he evidently was, the exchange was a
  quite masterly tactical plan. But I think we may take it that it was the
  case&mdash;worth fifteen thousand pounds&mdash;that he had come for.</p>

  <p>"We will assume that he knew the platinum to be concealed in the lead
  weights. It is practically certain that he did. He was one of the yacht's
  crew, or gang, and the thing must have been known to all of them. Probably he
  had seen the job carried out; but, at any rate, he knew what had been done.
  Accordingly, as soon as he had got his booty into a safe place, he proceeded
  to melt down the lead weights to get at the platinum.</p>

  <p>"And then it was, I suggest, that the fatal mistake occurred. As the
  weights melted, he looked for the platinum to appear. Apparently, he fished
  for it with a ladle and then transferred the molten metal by degrees to some
  empty pots. But when he had ladled the whole of it into the other pots, there
  was still no sign of the platinum. To his eye, the pots contained nothing but
  melted lead.</p>

  <p>"Now, what would he be likely to think, under the circumstances? He might
  have thought that Bassett had made a mistake and put the wrong weights into
  the case; but more probably (seeing that he had tried to rob the gang and
  snatch the whole of the booty for himself and the confederate who had helped
  him to carry off the case) he would think that he had been suspected and that
  'the boss' had deliberately laid a booby-trap for him by planting a couple of
  the plain lead weights in the case. At any rate, he had, apparently, got
  nothing but a quantity of lead. What did he do with that lead? We have no
  means of judging. He may have thrown it away in disgust or he may have sold
  it to a plumber for a few pence. But, if we accept this hypothetical
  construction of the course of events, we can see how these lumps of
  lead-platinum alloy came into being."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed, "it all fits the facts perfectly, even to the murder
  of Wicks. For, of course, each of these two rascals, Wicks and Bassett,
  thought the other had nobbled the whole of the swag. My eye! What a lark it
  is!" He laughed grimly and then added: "But I begin to have an inkling of the
  way you dropped on that dene hole so readily. You'd been keeping an account
  of the case all along. I wonder if you can make any suggestion as to how that
  stuff got into the coffin, and who put it there."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not, Miller," Thorndyke replied. "You see that the
  hypothetical sketch that I have given you is based on known facts and fair
  probabilities. But the facts that we have do not carry us much farther.
  Still, there is one fact that we must not overlook."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Miller demanded, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You will admit, I think," said Thorndyke, "that the faking of that coffin
  must have been carried out on the initiative and under the direction of
  Gimbler. There is really no reasonable alternative."</p>

  <p>"Unless Mr. Pippet did the job himself; which doesn't seem at all likely,
  though he may have been a party to it. But I agree with you. Gimbler must
  have been the moving spirit, and probably Pippet knows nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"That is my own view," said Thorndyke. "Tippet impresses me as a perfectly
  honest man, and I have no doubt that the planting of the coffin was
  exclusively Gimbler's scheme, carried out by certain agents. But one of these
  agents must have had these lumps of alloy in his
  possession&mdash;unconscious, of course, of their nature. But that agent must
  have been in touch, directly or indirectly, with Wicks. Now, it ought not to
  be impossible to discover who that agent was. There are several ways of
  approach to the problem. One of them, perhaps, is Mr. Bunter. Since Wicks was
  not on board the yacht when Bassett took away the case of platinum, he must
  have had a confederate who was. Now, there were only two men left when
  Bassett had gone&mdash;not counting the man whom the Customs officer saw, who
  seems to have been a stranger who had probably taken a passage on the yacht
  and is not really in the picture at all. As Bunter was one of those two,
  there is, at least, an even chance that he was Wicks's confederate; and, when
  you come to have a talk with him, you must bear in mind that he, also, may be
  assumed to be unaware of the change that the platinum would undergo when the
  melted lead was poured on to it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" Miller agreed. "I begin to hope that we may get something
  really useful out of Mr. Bunter, if we deal with him tactfully. But Lord!
  What a stroke of luck it was for me that you were able to come with me on
  this jaunt. If it hadn't been for what you have just told us, I might have
  missed the whole point of his story, even if he was prepared to tell one. I
  shouldn't have known any more about it than he did."</p>

  <p>As Miller concluded this frank and generous acknowledgment, the train
  began to slow down and presently drew up at Benfleet Station. A sergeant of
  the local police was waiting on the platform; and, when we had introduced
  ourselves, he took us in charge and conducted us out of the station. A few
  steps took us to the waterside, where we halted to survey the interminable
  levels of Canvey Island and the winding creek, now full of water, with its
  amazing assemblage of house boats and floating shacks of all kinds.</p>

  <p>"That's the <i>Cormorant,"</i> said the sergeant, pointing to a
  sturdy-looking, yawl-rigged yacht that was moored some distance down the
  creek. "I suppose you will not be wanting to go on board her?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present," replied Miller, "and probably not at all. But we will
  hear what Bunter has to say."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, sir," said the sergeant, "you'll find that he hasn't very
  much to say. We haven't found him particularly ready to talk. But perhaps
  he'll let himself go a bit more with you."</p>

  <p>We turned away from the water, and, under the sergeant's guidance, entered
  the little town, or village, and headed towards the police station.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE STATEMENT OF FREDERICK BUNTER</h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, Bunter," the Superintendent remarked, cheerfully, as
  the prisoner was brought into the little office and given a seat at the
  table, "here you are."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Bunter agreed, gloomily, "here I am. But I don't see why they
  wanted to run me in. I wasn't doing no harm."</p>

  <p>"You were trying to break into a yacht," Miller ventured to remind him.
  "That isn't quite according to Cocker, you know."</p>

  <p>"I was trying to get on board," said Bunter, "and I'm not denying it. But
  you seem to be forgetting that I was a member of the crew of that yacht. All
  I wanted was to get some of my kit what I had left behind. I've told the
  sergeant so."</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir," the sergeant confirmed. "He said he had left his
  pocket-knife behind; and we did find a pocket-knife on board&mdash;a big
  knife with a cork-screw and a marlin-spike in it, such as he had described.
  But he could have got it from us without breaking into the vessel."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, "that's so. Still, it's a point in his favour.
  However, it isn't the burglary that we are interested in. If everything else
  was satisfactory we might let that pass, as he didn't actually break in and
  he has some sort of explanation. But you know, Bunter, what the real business
  is, and what we want to ask you about. It's that platinum job."</p>

  <p>"What platinum job?" demanded Bunter. "I don't know nothing about any
  platinum."</p>

  <p>"Now, Bunter," the Superintendent remonstrated, "don't be silly. We know
  all about that job, and we know that you were in it with Bassett and Wicks
  and the other man."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he drew a packet of cigarettes from his pocket, and, taking
  one out, pushed it across the table with a box of matches. Bunter accepted
  the gift with a grunt of acknowledgment but maintained his unaccommodating
  attitude.</p>

  <p>"If you know all about it," said he, "there ain't no need for you to ask
  me no questions."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, there is," said Miller. "We know enough for the purpose of the
  prosecution. But there are certain matters that we should like to clear up
  for other reasons. Still, you are not obliged to say anything if you don't
  want to. I suppose you have been cautioned. If you haven't, I caution you now
  that anything you say will be taken down in writing and may be used in
  evidence at the trial. But I don't want you to say anything that might make
  the case any worse against you. I want some particulars, as I told you, for
  other reasons. What you may tell us won't do your two pals any harm, as they
  are both dead. And I think I may say that we are not inclined to be
  vindictive to you as no very great harm has been done to anybody, seeing that
  we have recovered the swag."</p>

  <p>At the moment when Miller made this last statement, the prisoner was in
  the act of striking a match to light his cigarette. But, as the words were
  spoken, the action became arrested and he sat with his mouth open and the
  unheeded match burning&mdash;until the flame reached his finger, when he
  dropped it with an appropriate observation. "Did you say," he demanded,
  speaking slowly and in a tone of the utmost amazement, "that you had
  recovered the swag?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Miller replied, calmly, proceeding to fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the platinum?" Bunter persisted, gazing at the Superintendent
  with the same expression of amazed incredulity.</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Miller. "Pass the matches when you have lit up."</p>

  <p>Bunter lit his cigarette perfunctorily and pushed the match-box across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"How did you get hold of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We got it," Miller replied, with a twinkle of enjoyment, "from someone
  who had it from Wicks."</p>

  <p>"Get out!" exclaimed Bunter. "You couldn't. Wicks never had it. You are
  fooling me. I don't believe you've got it at all."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Bunter," the Superintendent said, stiffly, "I am not bound to
  tell you anything. But, if I do tell you anything, you can take it that it's
  the truth. I'm not in the habit of making false statements to prisoners, nor
  is any other police officer. I tell you that we have got all that platinum
  back, so you can take that as a fact and steer your course accordingly."</p>

  <p>"But," persisted Bunter, "you couldn't have got it from Wicks. I tell you
  he never had it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Bunter," said Miller. "Didn't he pinch that case from the cloak
  room at Fenchurch Street? You know he did."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that," rejoined Bunter, "and I know that he thought
  the stuff was in that case. But it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"That's what he told you," said Miller, hardly able to conceal his
  enjoyment of this contest of wits, and the consciousness that he had the
  trumps securely up his sleeve. "But it was he that was doing the fooling. He
  meant to keep the whole of the swag for himself."</p>

  <p>"Now that's where you're mistaken," said Bunter. "You think I am going on
  what he told me. But I ain't. I <i>know</i> the stuff wasn't in that
  case."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" demanded Miller.</p>

  <p>"That's my business, that is," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "I don't know that it matters so very much. We have
  got the stuff back, which is the important thing. But, of course, we like to
  fill in the details if we can."</p>

  <p>Bunter re-lit his cigarette and reflected. No one likes a misunderstanding
  or cross-purposes, and Bunter evidently felt that he was being misunderstood.
  Furthermore, he was intensely curious as to how the platinum could possibly
  have been recovered. At length, he said.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I was to tell you the whole story, would you let the
  prosecution drop?"</p>

  <p>The Superintendent shook his head, "No, Bunter," he replied promptly. "I
  can't make any promises. The man who makes a promise which he doesn't mean to
  keep is a liar, which is what no police officer ought to be; and the man who
  keeps a promise that he oughtn't to have made, in a case like this, is guilty
  of bribery. The English law is dead against compounding felonies or any other
  crimes. But you know quite well that, if you choose to help us, you won't do
  yourself any harm."</p>

  <p>Bunter took a little more time for reflection, and eventually reached a
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "I will tell you the whole blooming story, so far as
  it is known to me; and I look to you not to take advantage of me from what I
  have told you."</p>

  <p>"I think you are wise, Bunter," said the Superintendent, obviously much
  relieved at the prisoner's decision. "By the way, Sergeant, what time did
  Bunter have his breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"About seven o'clock, sir," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "if he is going to make a longish statement, he won't
  be the worse for a little refreshment. What do you say, Bunter?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bunter grinned and admitted that "he could do with a beaver."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miller, "perhaps we could all do with a
  beaver&mdash;say, a snack of bread and cheese and a glass of beer. Can you
  manage that, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant could, and, being provided with the wherewith in the form of
  a ten-shilling note, went forth to dispatch an underling in search of the
  materials for the said "beaver." Meanwhile, Bunter, having been furnished
  with a fresh cigarette, lighted it and began his narrative.</p>

  <p>"You must understand," said he, "that this job was run by Bassett. The
  rest of us carried out orders, and we didn't know much more about the job
  than what he told us; and he didn't tell us any more than we was bound to
  find out for ourselves. We didn't even know that the stuff was platinum until
  Wicks spotted it by its weight. All that we knew was that we were going to
  lift some stuff that was pretty valuable; and I doubt if the fourth man,
  Park, knew even that."</p>

  <p>"How did you come to know Bassett?" the Superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"He came to my house&mdash;leastways my brother-in-law's house at
  Walworth&mdash;and said he had been recommended to me by a gentleman; but he
  wouldn't say who the gentleman was. Whoever he was, he must have known
  something about me, because he knew that I had been to sea on a sailing
  barge, and he knew about a little trouble that I had got into over some snide
  money that some fool gave me for a joke."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Miller, "and how did that trouble end?"</p>

  <p>"Charge dismissed," Bunter replied, triumphantly. "No evidence of any
  dishonest intent. Of course there wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Miller agreed. "Of course you explained about the
  practical joke?"</p>

  <p>"Rather&mdash;at least my lawyer did. He talked to the beak like a father,
  I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, "I can imagine it. These Jew advocates are uncommonly
  persuasive."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't a Jew," Bunter exclaimed, indignantly. "No blooming sheenies
  for me. He was an English gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Miller. "I thought all the police court solicitors were Jews.
  What was this gentleman's name?"</p>

  <p>"His name," Bunter replied, haughtily, "was Gimbler; and a first-class man
  at his business he was. Knew all the ropes like an A.B."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller. "But to return to Bassett; had Wicks known him
  previously?"</p>

  <p>"No. Bassett called on him, too. Got his address from a gentleman who knew
  him. Same gentleman, I expect, as Bassett wouldn't say who he was. But he
  knew that Wicks had been brought up as a waterman, and I think he knew a bit
  more about him&mdash;more than I did, for Wicks was a stranger to me, and he
  didn't let on much as to what he did for a living. So there was four of us on
  the yacht; Bassett, Wicks, me and a bloke named Park, but he wasn't really in
  the swim. He was a bawleyman out of Leigh; a simple sort of cove, but a rare
  good seaman. He wasn't told nothing about the job, and I fancy he thought it
  was some sort of smuggling racket&mdash;nothing for a honest man to
  mind."</p>

  <p>"And what was the arrangement as to pay, or shares?"</p>

  <p>"We all got monthly pay at the ordinary yachtman's rate, and there was to
  be a bonus at the end of the voyage. Park was to have fifty pounds, and me
  and Wicks was to have two hundred each if we brought the job off and landed
  the swag."</p>

  <p>Here the "beaver" arrived, and Bunter was allowed to refresh himself with
  a glass of beer; which he did with uncommon gusto. But the narrative
  proceeded without interruption, excepting such as was due to slight
  impairment of articulation when the narrator took an extra liberal mouthful;
  which we shall venture to ignore.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you exactly how the actual job was done at Riga, as I was
  down below at the time. Bassett and Wicks did the sleight of hand on the
  quay, but I think it was done something like this: We had been in the habit
  of getting our provisions on board in a big hamper, and this used to be left
  about on the quay so as to get the people there used to seeing it. Now, on
  the day when the job was done, Bassett put into the hamper the little dummy
  case that he had got ready with half a hundredweight of lead in it. I don't
  know how he got the particulars for making up the case, but I reckon he must
  have had a pal on the spot who gave him the tip. Anyway, he made up the dummy
  case and put it in the hamper wrapped up in a waterproof sheet. Then it was
  took up and dumped down on the quay close to where the cases of platinum was
  being dumped down by the men who brought them out of the van. Then, I
  understand, someone gave an alarm of fire; and, while everyone was looking at
  the place where the fire was supposed to be, the dummy was put out on the
  quay and the waterproof sheet flicked off the dummy and over one of the real
  cases, and the dummy was shoved nearer to the other cases. Then Bassett sat
  down on the case that he had covered with the sheet and lit his pipe. Then
  they waited until all the cases, dummy and all, had been put on board the
  ship. Then they lifted the case, still covered with the waterproof sheet,
  into the hamper and brought it on board the yacht.</p>

  <p>"As soon as it was on board, Park and me was told to cast off the shore
  ropes and get the yacht out of her berth and put out into the bay; which we
  did, though, as it was nearly a dead calm, she crept out mighty slowly. When
  we had got the sails set, I left Park at the helm and went below to lend a
  hand; and then it was that I found out how the swag was to be disposed
  of&mdash;and a mighty clever wheeze it was, and it worked out to a T.</p>

  <p>"You must know that our inside ballast was a lot of lead weights, all cast
  to the same size&mdash;about half a hundredweight each and forty of them, all
  told. Now, as soon as we was fairly under way, Bassett and Wicks lighted a
  big Primus stove and set a large melting-pot on it; and into the pot they put
  one of the lead weights from the hold. Then Bassett brought out of the
  lazarette a fireclay mould like the one that the weights had been cast in. It
  was an open mould what you just poured the lead in; and when it had set, you
  turned it over and the weight dropped out with the top surface rough as it
  had set.</p>

  <p>"While the lead was melting, me and Bassett and Wicks opened the case and
  took out the platinum, which was in thin sheets about a foot square. We cut
  the sheets up with tinman's snips into narrow strips what would go snugly
  into the mould. Then Bassett put a bit of cold lead into the mould for the
  strips of platinum to rest on, and then we laid the strips in the mould,
  fitting them in carefully so as to get as many in as possible. Then, when we
  had got them in and the lead in the pot was melted, Bassett takes a ladle,
  dips it into the pot and pours it into the mould. He had made the lead a bit
  extra hot, so that it should not be cooled by the cold platinum. Well, when
  we had filled up the mould and covered up the platinum, we had to wait while
  it was setting; and Bassett put another ballast-weight in the pot to melt.
  When the lead in the mould was set, we turned it out, and there was an
  ordinary-looking ballast weight what you wouldn't have known from any other
  ballast-weight.</p>

  <p>"We did the same with the rest of the platinum, and that just made up
  another weight. Then we marked the numbers on them with punches&mdash;all the
  ballast-weights were numbered and laid in their regular order, 1 to 40. These
  two weights were numbered 22 and 25; and when we had marked them, we laid
  them down in their proper places in the hold. Then we cleaned up. The lead
  what was left over we chucked overboard, and the fireclay mould went after
  it. The case what the platinum had come in, we broke up and shoved the pieces
  in the galley fire; so now there was no trace left of this little job, and we
  didn't mind if the police came on board and rummaged the ship. There wasn't
  nothing for them to find. So we sailed back to our berth and made fast; and
  there we stayed for five days to give them a chance to come on board and
  rummage if they wanted to. But they never came. Naturally. Because nothing
  had been found out. So, on the sixth day, we put to sea for the voyage
  home.</p>

  <p>"But we didn't come straight home. We kept up the appearances of a
  cruising yacht. You won't want particulars of the voyage, but there is one
  little incident that I must mention. It was at Rotterdam, our last port of
  call, on the morning when we started for home. We had got the sails loosed
  and was just about to cast off, when a cove appeared on the quay and hailed
  Bassett, who was on deck giving orders. Bassett replied as if he had expected
  this bloke, and reached up and took the man's luggage&mdash;a small suit-case
  and a brown-paper parcel with a rug-strap fastened to it&mdash;and helped the
  covey down the ladder. Then we cast off and put out to sea; so we could see
  that this stranger had arranged with Bassett for a passage to England.</p>

  <p>"Shortly after we had started, Bassett sends me to the fore peak for one
  of the empty cases what our provisions had been stowed it. I took it to the
  cabin, but I didn't know what it was wanted for until I saw the passenger
  stowing it in the locker what belonged to his berth. Later, I found the brown
  paper from the parcel and a big bit of oiled silk which seemed a bit damp and
  had a nasty smell; so I chucked it overboard. I don't know whether Bassett
  knew what was in that parcel, but none of us ever guessed.</p>

  <p>"Now, when we was about abreast of the Swin Middle light-ship, we met a
  stumpy barge what was bound, as it turned out, from London to Colchester.
  Bassett hailed her, and, when we was near enough, he asked the skipper if he
  would take a passenger. The skipper wanted further particulars, so Wicks and
  Park went off to the barge in the boat, taking the passenger's case with
  them. Apparently it was all right, for Wicks waved his hand and Park started
  to row back to the yacht."</p>

  <p>"Had Wicks or Bassett told you anything about this business?" the
  Superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Not a word was said at the time; but Wicks told me all about it
  afterwards, and I may as well tell you now. It seems that the
  passenger&mdash;his name was Sanders&mdash;had got Bassett's permission to
  make an arrangement with Wicks to smuggle the case ashore and take it to
  Fenchurch Street Station and leave it in the cloak room. He gave Wicks ten
  pounds for the job and a pound for the barge skipper; and a rare mug he must
  have been to pay Wicks in advance. Well, the skipper took Wicks with him up
  the Colne and put him ashore, after dark, somewhere between Rowhedge and
  Colchester; and Wicks took a walk inland with his case and picked up a motor
  bus that took him into Colchester. He stayed there a day or two, having a bit
  of a beano, because he wasn't due to dump the case in the cloak room until
  the following Monday, so that it shouldn't be waiting there too long. But on
  Saturday evening he took the train to London and went straight to the house
  of my brother-in-law, Bert Wallis, where I was in the habit of living."</p>

  <p>"Why did he go there?" asked Miller.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Bunter, "that's another story, and I may as well tell you that
  now. You must know that, after Wicks found out about the platinum, he got
  very discontented. He reckoned that the swag might be worth anything from ten
  to twenty thousand pounds; and he said we'd been done in the eye. Two hundred
  pounds apiece, he said, wasn't anything like a fair share, seeing that we'd
  taken a equal share of the risk. And he was very suspicious of Bassett. He
  doubted whether he was a perfectly honest man."</p>

  <p>"What a horrible suspicion!" Miller exclaimed with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Bunter. "But I believe he was right. He suspected that
  Bassett meant to clear off with the whole of the swag and not pay us
  anything. And so did I; so we arranged that I should keep an eye on Bassett
  and see that he didn't get away with it.</p>

  <p>"Now, when we had done with the Customs at Southend&mdash;of course they
  didn't twig nothing&mdash;we ran up into Benfleet Creek and took up moorings.
  Then, on Saturday, Bassett said he was going to take the stuff up to a dealer
  what he knew of and wouldn't be back for a day or two. So, in the evening, I
  helped him to carry the case, with the two doctored weights in it, up to the
  station and saw him into a first-class carriage and shut him in. But I didn't
  go back to the yacht. I'd taken the precaution to get a ticket in advance,
  and given Park the tip that I mightn't be back that night; so, when I left
  Bassett, I went to the rear of the train and got in. I travelled up to town
  in that train, and I followed Bassett and saw him stow the case in the cloak
  room. Then, when I had seen him out of the station, I nipped straight off
  home to Bert Wallis's place at Walworth.</p>

  <p>"It happened that I got there only a few minutes after Wicks had turned
  up. I told him what had happened, and we talked over what we should do to
  keep our eyes on the case of platinum. But, at the moment, Wicks was all agog
  to know what was in Mr. Sanders's case. I pointed out to him that it was no
  business of his, but he said if it was worth all the money and trouble that
  had been spent on it, there must be something of value inside, and he was
  going to see what that something <i>was,</i> and whether it was worth while
  to take it to the cloak room at all.</p>

  <p>"Well, I got him a screwdriver and he had the screws out in a twinkling
  and pulled up the lid. And then he fairly hollered with surprise and I was a
  bit took aback, myself. You know what was inside&mdash;a man's head, packed
  in some of our old duds. I tell you, Wicks slammed the lid down and ran the
  screws in faster than he took them out. Then I asks him what he was going to
  do about it. 'Do!' says he. 'I'm going to plant the damn thing in the cloak
  room tomorrow morning and get clear of it; and I'll send the ticket on to
  Sanders at Benfleet Post Office as I promised. I've been paid, and I'm going
  to carry out my contract like a honest man.'</p>

  <p>"But the sight of that man's head seemed to have given him something to
  think about, for he was mighty thoughtful for a while. Then, all of a sudden,
  something seemed to strike him, for he turns to me and asks: What sort of
  case did Bassett pack them two weights in?' 'Why,' I says, 'one of the
  provision cases; same sort as that head is packed in.' 'Then, by gum,' says
  he, 'we are going to steal a march on that dishonest blighter, Bassett, if we
  can manage it. Do you know what marks there were on that case?' Now, it
  happened that I did; for I had taken the precaution to make a copy of the
  label. I showed it to Wicks and he got a card like the one I had seen on
  Bassett's case and wrote the name and address on it from my copy and tacked
  it on to Sanders's case.</p>

  <p>"'And now,' says he, 'the question is how we are going to get that case
  here from the station. We might take a taxi, but that wouldn't be very safe.
  We don't want to leave no tracks.' Then I thought of Joe Wallis, Bert
  Wallis's brother, what had a shop a couple of doors off and kept a motor van
  for carting timber about."</p>

  <p>"What is his trade?" Miller asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a carpenter what does work for some small builders. He served his
  time as a undertaker, but he give that up. Said it wasn't cheerful enough. He
  didn't mind the coffins, but he couldn't stick the corpses. Well, the end of
  it was that Wicks persuaded Joe to take on the job. I don't know what story
  he told him, Of course, Joe didn't know what was in either of the cases, but
  he is a big, strong chap and Wicks made it worth his while. Being Sunday, he
  put on a leather coat and a cap like a taxi-driver, for the sake of
  appearances.</p>

  <p>"Well, Wicks got rid of Sanders's case all right and posted the ticket off
  to Benfleet; and then, in the afternoon, he set off to do the more ticklish
  job of swapping Sanders's case for Bassett's. But he brought it off all right
  and got the right case safely to Bert's crib. Being Sunday, Bert wasn't doing
  nothing, so we had the run of his workshop to do our little job in."</p>

  <p>"What is Bert's trade?" the Superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a plumber," replied Bunter. "That's what he is."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Miller, with a sly look. "Doesn't do anything in the pewter and
  plaster mould line, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I said he was a plumber," Bunter replied, haughtily; "and,
  consequentially, he'd got a workshop with a big gas ring and some
  melting-pots; which was just what we wanted.</p>

  <p>"Well, we opened Bassett's case and there, sure enough, was the two lead
  weights. And they seemed to be the right ones, by the punch marks on
  them&mdash;22 and 25. So we took the biggest melting-pot, which was half full
  of lead, and, when we had tipped the lump of lead out on the floor, we put
  the pot on the ring and lighted up; and then we shoved one of the lead
  weights in it.</p>

  <p>"'Now,' says Wicks, 'we are going to make our fortunes. But we shall have
  some difficulty in getting rid of this stuff. We shall have to go slow.' So
  he sat on a chair by the gas ring and watched the weight and made all sorts
  of plans for getting rid of the platinum. The weight was a long time before
  it showed any signs of melting; but, at last it began to slip down the pot,
  and me and Wicks leaned over the pot and watched for the bits of platinum to
  stick out. But we couldn't see no sign of them. We watched the weight as it
  slipped down further and further until it had crumpled up and was all melted.
  But still we couldn't see nothing of the platinum. Then Wicks got a iron rod
  and raked about in the melted lead to see if he could feel the bits of
  platinum. But he couldn't. Then he got a ladle and tried to fish out the bits
  that he couldn't see; and, I tell you, he was fair sweating with anxiety, and
  so was I for that matter. For nothing came up in the ladle but melted
  lead.</p>

  <p>"Then I suggested that we should ladle out the whole of the lead, a little
  at a time, into another pot, and I got three small empty pots and set them
  alongside the big one; and Wicks ladled out the lead from the big one into
  the little ones. But still we didn't come to the platinum. And at last we
  come to the bottom of the pot; and then we could see that there wasn't no
  platinum there.</p>

  <p>"By this time Wicks was nearly blue with rage and disappointment, and I
  was pretty sick, myself. However, we emptied the last drop of lead out of the
  big pot and started to melt the other weight. But it was the same story with
  that one. We ladled the lead out into the small pots, and, by way of doing
  the thing thoroughly, took the big pot up by its handle and drained the very
  last drop of lead out of it into the small pots. And there wasn't a grain of
  platinum to be seen anywhere.</p>

  <p>"My eye! You ought to have seen Wicks's face when he had done with the
  second weight and tried it right out. His language was something awful, And
  no wonder. For you see it wasn't no mistake. The numbers on the weights was
  all right. It was a fair do. Bassett had deliberately sold us a pup. He'd got
  a pair of the plain lead weights, hammered the numbers out, and punched fresh
  numbers on them. It was a dirty trick, but I suppose he must have suspected
  Wicks and got this plant ready for him. At any rate, Wicks saw red, and he
  swore he would do Bassett in. We'd got Bassett's address at Swanscombe,
  because we had got to go there for the money that was owing to us when the
  swag should have been disposed of; and, on the Tuesday, Wicks went off to see
  if Bassett was at home, and, if he was, to have a few words with him. And
  that was the last I ever saw of Wicks. When he didn't come home, I supposed
  he had made himself scarce on account of the hue and cry about the head in
  the case. Now I know that he must have tried to do Bassett in, and Bassett
  must have got his whack in first. And that's all I know about the
  business."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Miller. "You've made a very straightforward statement, and I
  can tell you that you have not done yourself any harm and what you have told
  us will probably be quite helpful to us. I'll write it out presently from my
  notes and you can read it, and, if you are satisfied with it, I'll get you to
  sign it. In the meantime, I want to ask you one or two questions. First of
  all, about this man Sanders; can you give us any description of him?"</p>

  <p>"He was a tall man," replied Bunter; "a good six foot if he had stood up
  straight&mdash;which he didn't, having a stoop at the shoulders. I should put
  his age at about fifty. He had dark hair and beard and he wore
  spectacles."</p>

  <p>"What kind of spectacles?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," replied Bunter. "Spectacles is spectacles. I ain't a
  optician."</p>

  <p>"Some spectacles are large," said Thorndyke, "and some are small. Some are
  round and some are oval, and some have a line across as if they had been
  cracked. Would his fit any of those descriptions?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, now you come to mention it. They was big, round spectacles with
  a sort of crack across them. But it couldn't have been a crack because it was
  the same in both eyes. I'd forgotten them until you spoke."</p>

  <p>I noticed that Miller had cast a quick look at Thorndyke and was now
  eagerly writing down the description. Evidently, he "smelt a fox," and so did
  I. For, though Thorndyke had not really put a "leading question," he had
  mentioned a very uncommon kind of spectacles&mdash;the old-fashioned type of
  bi-focal, which is hardly ever made now, having been superseded by the
  cemented or ground lunette. I had no doubt, nor, I think, had Miller, that he
  was describing a particular pair of spectacles; and this suspicion was
  strengthened by his next questions.</p>

  <p>"Bid you notice anything peculiar in his voice or manner of speaking?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing extraordinary," replied Bunter. "He'd got a squeaky voice, and
  there's no denying it. And he didn't speak quite proper English, like you and
  me. Seemed to speak a bit like a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>I surmised that Mr. Bunter used the word "Dutchman" in a nautical sense,
  meaning any sort of foreigner who was not a "Dago"; and so, apparently,
  Thorndyke interpreted it, for he said:</p>

  <p>"He spoke with a foreign accent? Was it a strong accent, or only
  slight?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was nothing to notice. You'd hardly have taken him for a
  foreigner."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice his nose?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't help noticing it. Lord! It was some boko. Reminded me of a
  parrot. And it had got a pretty strong list to starboard."</p>

  <p>"You would say that he had a large, curved, or hook nose, which was bent
  towards the right. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I said."</p>

  <p>"Then, Superintendent," said Thorndyke, "I think we have a working
  description of Mr. Sanders. Shall we take a note of Mr. Bert Wallis's
  address?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what you want with that," Bunter objected. "He didn't have
  nothing to do with the job. We used his work-shop, but he didn't know what we
  wanted it for."</p>

  <p>"We realize that," said Thorndyke, "and we have nothing whatever against
  him. But he may be able to give us some information on some other matters. By
  the way, speaking of that lead that you ladled out of the pot; what did you
  do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It wasn't no good to us. We just left it in the pots for Bert,
  in case he had any use for it."</p>

  <p>"And Bert's address is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Sixty-four Little Bolter Street, Walworth. But don't you go worrying him.
  He don't know nothing what he didn't ought to."</p>

  <p>"You needn't be afraid of our giving him any trouble," said Miller. "We
  may not have to call on him at all, but, in any case it will only be a matter
  of a few questions which he won't mind answering. And now, perhaps you'd like
  another fag to smoke while I am writing up your statement."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bunter accepted the "fag" readily and even hinted that the making of
  statements was dry work; on which Miller directed the sergeant to provide him
  with a further half-pint. Meanwhile, Thorndyke and I, having no concern with
  the formalities of the statement, went forth to stretch our legs and take a
  more detailed survey of the waterside. When we returned, the statement had
  been transcribed and duly signed by Mr. Frederick Bunter. And this brought to
  an end a very satisfactory day's work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE UNCONSCIOUS RECEIVERS</h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the return journey, the Superintendent showed a
  natural disposition to discuss the bearings of what we had learned from
  Bunter and reckon up his gains in the matter of evidence.</p>

  <p>"It was a pleasant surprise to me," said he, "to hear Bunter let himself
  go in the way he did. I was afraid, from what the sergeant said, that we
  shouldn't get much out of him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "he was rather unexpectedly expansive. I think what started
  him was your insistence that Wicks had got possession of the platinum, when
  he knew, as he supposed, that Bassett had planted the wrong weights. He was
  mightily staggered when you told him that the swag had been recovered. Still,
  we've a good deal more to learn yet before we shall know exactly what did
  happen."</p>

  <p>"That is true," agreed Miller. "We've learned a lot from Bunter, but there
  is a lot more that we don't know, and that Bunter doesn't know. The question
  is, how much do we know? What do you say, Doctor? I should like to hear you
  sum up what we have gained by this statement, and tell us exactly how you
  think we stand."</p>

  <p>"My feeling," said Thorndyke, "is that we have advanced our knowledge
  considerably. We have shortened the gap between the two parts of the problem
  which are known to us. When we came down, our knowledge of the platinum
  ceased with its disappearance from the cloak room and began again with its
  reappearance in the coffin. That was a big gap. But, as I have said, that gap
  is now to a great extent filled up. The problem that remains is to trace
  those lumps of alloy from Bert Wallis's workshop to the false coffin; and I
  don't think that we shall have much difficulty in doing it. But, before we
  proceed to count up our gains, we had better consider what it is that we want
  to know.</p>

  <p>"Now, I remind you that there are two distinct problems, which we had
  better keep quite separate: the platinum robbery and the substituted coffin.
  Bunter's statement bears on both, but we must not get them confused. Let us
  take the robbery first. My impression is that we now know all that we are
  likely to know about it. We all have probably formed certain suspicions; but
  suspicions are of no use unless there is some prospect of confirming them.
  And I do not think that there is. But, after all, is there any object in
  pursuing the matter? The two visible principals in the robbery are dead. As
  to poor Bunter, he was a mere spectator. He never knew any of the
  details."</p>

  <p>"He was, at least, an accessory after the fact," said Miller.</p>

  <p>"True. But is he worth powder and shot? Remember, this robbery was
  committed outside British jurisdiction. It will be an extradition case,
  unless you charge Bunter with complicity in the theft from the cloak room. It
  will be for the Latvian police to make the first move, which they probably
  will not, as the property has been recovered and the principal offenders are
  dead."</p>

  <p>Miller reluctantly admitted the cogency of this argument.</p>

  <p>"Still," he insisted, "there is more in it than that. Didn't it strike you
  that certain parts of Bunter's statement seemed to suggest the possibility
  that the robbery had been planned and engineered by our friend, Gimbler?"</p>

  <p>"It did," Thorndyke admitted. "That was what I meant when I spoke of
  certain suspicions that we have formed. It would be possible, from Bunter's
  statement, to build up quite a plausible argument to prove that Gimbler was
  probably the moving spirit in that robbery. But it would be a mere academic
  exercise; very entertaining, but quite unprofitable, since the principals are
  dead and Bunter knows less than we do. There are no means by which our
  suspicions could be put to the proof or our knowledge enlarged."</p>

  <p>"I expect you are right," Miller agreed, gloomily; "but I should like to
  hear the argument, all the same."</p>

  <p>"It will be a waste of time," said Thorndyke. "However, our time is not
  very valuable just now, and there will be no harm in assembling the relevant
  facts. Let us take them in order.</p>

  <p>"1. Bunter had been defended on a criminal charge by Gimbler.</p>

  <p>"2. Bunter was introduced to Bassett by 'a gentleman,' who must have,
  therefore, known them both.</p>

  <p>"3. A gentleman&mdash;apparently the same gentleman&mdash;introduced Wicks
  to Bassett, and, therefore, knew Wicks.</p>

  <p>"4. The said gentleman&mdash;assuming him to be the same in both
  cases&mdash;was, therefore, acquainted with three persons who are known to us
  as having been engaged in crime.</p>

  <p>"5. One of these three persons&mdash;Bunter&mdash;was acquainted with
  Gimbler.</p>

  <p>"6. The unknown 'gentleman,' who was acquainted with three criminals, took
  an active and helpful part in the robbery inasmuch as he introduced Bassett
  to persons who would be likely to agree to assist in the carrying out of a
  criminal enterprise."</p>

  <p>Those are the principal facts; and now as to their application. The
  appearance of this mysterious 'gentleman,' acquainted with criminals and
  apparently acting, at least as an accessory, strongly suggests someone in the
  background directing, and possibly planning, this robbery. This suggestion is
  reinforced by the fact that someone connected with the robbery must have had
  a substantial amount of capital available. The yacht, even if bought quite
  cheap, must have cost not less than a hundred pounds; and then there were the
  considerable out-goings in respect of the provisioning and fitting-out for
  the cruise, and the payments of wages which seem to have been made, apart
  from the final 'bonus,' which might have been paid out of the proceeds of the
  robbery. Of course, Bassett may have had the money; but it is not probable.
  Persons who get their livelihood by crime are not usually capitalists. There
  is a strong suggestion that the 'gentleman' was behind the robbery in a
  financial sense as well as furnishing the brains and management. This is all
  reasonable inference&mdash;though of no evidential value. But when we try to
  give a name to this mysterious 'gentleman,' our inferences become highly
  speculative. However, let us speculate. Let us propose the hypothesis that
  the hidden hand behind this robbery was the hand of Mr. Horatio Gimbler, What
  is there to support that hypothesis?</p>

  <p>"First, there is the coffin. It contained the proceeds of this robbery.
  Gimbler was not aware of the fact; but the circumstance that it was there
  establishes the fact of some sort of contact between Gimbler and the persons
  who were concerned in the robbery. The persons whom he dealt with in the
  preparation of the coffin had dealings with the persons who carried out the
  robbery."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much in that," I objected. "It might have been pure
  chance."</p>

  <p>"So it might," he agreed, "and there is very little in it, as you say. But
  circumstantial evidence is made up of little things. I merely assert that
  some sort of connexion is established.</p>

  <p>"The next point is that, of the three criminals engaged in this robbery,
  the only one known to us&mdash;Bunter&mdash;was acquainted with Gimbler. But
  Bunter was also acquainted with the unknown gentleman. There isn't much in
  that, taken alone; but it points in the same direction as the other
  facts.</p>

  <p>"And now let us consider how Gimbler fits the character of the
  hypothetical person who may have directed and financed the robbery.</p>

  <p>"First, this hypothetical person must have had a somewhat extensive
  acquaintance with members of the criminal class in order to be able to select
  suitable persons to carry out this rather peculiar and specialized piece of
  work. Criminals with a practical knowledge of seamanship cannot be very
  common. But Gimbler has a very extensive acquaintance with the criminal
  class.</p>

  <p>"The next point is that this hypothetical person must have had a modest
  amount of capital at his disposal, say two or three hundred pounds. We do not
  know much of Gimbler's circumstances, but it would be very remarkable if he
  were not able to produce that amount to finance a scheme which was likely to
  yield a profit of thousands. But, as there must be innumerable persons in the
  same financial position, this argument has no significance. It is merely an
  argument.</p>

  <p>"Finally, our hypothetical person must have combined considerable
  ingenuity with extreme dishonesty. Here there is undoubted agreement; but,
  unfortunately, Gimbler is in this respect far from unique.</p>

  <p>"That is the argument; and, as you see, though it is enough to allow of
  our entertaining a suspicion of Gimbler, it is not enough to establish the
  most flimsy <i>prima facie</i> case. If Gimbler was the hidden director of
  this crime, he was extremely well hidden, and I think he will remain hidden.
  Probably, Bassett was the only person who knew the whole of the facts."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed, glumly, "I'm afraid you are right. Unless the
  Latvian police raise an outcry, it will probably be best to let the matter
  drop. After all, the robbery failed and we have got the stuff back. Still, I
  feel in my bones that Gimbler engineered the job, and I should have liked to
  lay my hands on him. But, as you say, he kept out of sight and is out of
  sight still. He always does keep out of sight, damn him!"</p>

  <p>"Not always," said Thorndyke. "You are forgetting the other case&mdash;the
  counterfeit coffin. That is an entirely different matter. There he is already
  in full view. A manifest fraud has been committed, and there are only two
  persons who could possibly be suspected of having committed it&mdash;Gimbler
  and Pippet. Actually, I suppose, no one suspects Pippet. But he is the
  claimant in whose interest&mdash;ostensibly&mdash;the fraud was perpetrated,
  and it is certain that Gimbler will try to put it on him, If it were not for
  Pippet, you could arrest Gimbler tomorrow and be confident of a conviction.
  As it is, direct evidence against Gimbler is a necessity, and it is for you,
  Miller, to secure that evidence. I think you will not have much difficulty,
  with the facts now in our possession."</p>

  <p>"No," said Miller, "we seem to have got a pretty good lead from Bunter;
  but, all the same, I should like to hear your views on the evidence that we
  have."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "let us approach the problem from both ends. At
  one end we have four lumps of metal, one lead and three alloy, in the
  workshop of a plumber, Bert Wallis. At the other we have the same four lumps
  of metal in a coffin; and the problem is to bridge the interval between the
  two appearances.</p>

  <p>"Now, the fact that those four lumps appeared together in the coffin is
  evidence that the interval was quite short. There were no intermediate
  wanderings during which they might have become separated. We may be sure that
  the passage from the workshop to the coffin was pretty direct; in effect, we
  may assume that the man who prepared the coffin got his lead from Bert
  Wallis. The next inference is very obvious, though it may be erroneous. But
  when we consider that a couple of doors from Bert Wallis's premises were
  those of a man who had served his time as an undertaker, and who was,
  therefore, capable of making a perfectly correct and workmanlike coffin; who
  had a motor van and who was Bert Wallis's brother; it is impossible to ignore
  the probability that the coffin was made by Joe Wallis. He had all the means
  of carrying out the substitution&mdash;you will remember that there was a
  cart shed adjoining the wall of the burial ground, in which a van could be
  conveniently hidden, and from which the coffin could be easily passed over
  the wall&mdash;and, if he had done the job, he would presumably have got his
  lead from his brother whose premises were close by. The only weak place in
  the argument is that we are accusing a man, who may be a perfectly honest and
  reputable tradesman, of being concerned in a crime."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need worry yourself about that," said Miller. "You
  heard what I said to Bunter on the subject of pewter and plaster moulds. He
  knew what I meant. There had been some suspicion that Mr. Bert Wallis
  occasionally turned his hand to the manufacture of counterfeit coin. It was
  never brought home to him; but the fact that Bunter&mdash;who lives with him
  when he is at home&mdash;had been charged with issuing counterfeit money
  (which I had not heard of before) gives colour to the suspicion. And Bunter,
  himself, as we know, is a decidedly shady customer. I don't think we need
  have any scruples of delicacy in giving Mr. Joseph Wallis a little attention.
  I'll call and have a friendly talk with him."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't do that," said Thorndyke; "at least, not in the first place.
  It would be much better to make the initial attack on Bert. There, you have
  something definite to go on. You know that the metal was in his workshop.
  And, if he has not heard of the facts disclosed in the Probate Court, or has
  not connected them with the metal that he had, you will have a good opening
  for an inquiry as to what has become of certain valuable property which is
  known to have been in his possession. When he learns what the value of that
  metal was, I fancy you may look for an explosion which may give you the
  leading facts before he has realized the position. Besides, there is the
  possibility that he gave away or sold the metal without any knowledge of its
  origin."</p>

  <p>"So there is," agreed Miller, leaning back to laugh with more comfort, "in
  fact, it is quite probable. My eye! What a lark it will be! I shall go
  straight on from Fenchurch Street. Couldn't I persuade you to come with me
  and do some of the talking?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke required no persuading, nor did I, for the interview promised to
  be highly entertaining. Accordingly, the arrangement was made and the plan of
  campaign settled; and, on our arrival at the terminus, after a brief halt at
  the buffet for a sandwich and a glass of beer, we made our way to the tube
  railway, by which we were conveyed to the "Elephant and Castle."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, as Miller struck out towards the Walworth Road, "I
  suppose you have got the address?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply, "I got it from Bunter when he signed the statement.
  It's in East Street. I made a note of the number."</p>

  <p>He brought out his note-book and glanced at it as we threaded our way
  through the multitude that thronged the pavement. Presently he turned to the
  left down a side street and walked on with his eyes on the numbers of the
  houses.</p>

  <p>"This is the show," he said, at length, halting before a seedy-looking
  plumber's shop, the fa&ccedil;ade of which bore the inscription, 'A. Wallis.' "Shop
  looks as if it was open."</p>

  <p>It was, technically, although the door was closed; but it yielded to a
  push, announcing the fact by the jangling of a bell, which brought a man out
  of the parlour at the back. Apparently, we had disturbed him at a meal, for
  his jaws were working as he came out, and he looked at us inquiringly without
  speaking. Perhaps "inquiringly" hardly expresses the kind of look that he
  gave us. It was a mere coincidence, but it happened that we were, all three,
  over six feet in height, and Miller, at least, looked a good deal like what
  he was.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent opened the ball. "You are Mr. Bert Wallis, I
  think?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallis nodded, chewing frantically. Finally, he bolted his mouthful
  and replied: "Yes, that's who I am. What about it?</p>

  <p>"My friend here, Br. Thorndyke, who is a lawyer, wants to make a few
  inquiries of you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallis turned to Thorndyke but made no comment, having, apparently,
  some slight arrears to dispose of in the matter of chewing.</p>

  <p>"My inquiries," said Thorndyke, "have reference to certain valuable
  property which came into your possession some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Valuable property in my possession," said Wallis. "It's the first I have
  heard of it. What property are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"It is a quantity of metal," replied Thorndyke. "You had it from two men
  named Wicks and Bunter."</p>

  <p>Wallis stared at Thorndyke for a few seconds; and, gradually, the look of
  apprehension faded from his countenance and gave place to one of amusement.
  His mouth extended laterally until it exhibited an undeniable grin.</p>

  <p>"I know what you are talking about, now," he chuckled; "but you've got
  hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether. I'll tell you how it happened.
  Them two silly fools, Wicks and Bunter, thought they had got hold of some
  valuable stuff. I don't know what they thought it was, but they asked me to
  let them melt it down in my workshop. I didn't much like the idea of it,
  because I didn't know what stuff it was or how they had got it; but, as
  Bunter is my wife's brother and I knew Wicks, I didn't quite like to refuse.
  So I let them have the run of my workshop on a Sunday night when I was out,
  and they did the job. They melted down this here valuable stuff; and what do
  you suppose it turned out to be, after all?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head and waited for the answer.</p>

  <p>"It was <i>lead!"</i> Wallis exclaimed with a triumphant giggle. "Just
  think of it! These two silly asses had put theirselves to no end of trouble
  and expense to get hold of this stuff&mdash;I don't know how they did get
  hold of it&mdash;and when they come to melt it down, it was just lead, worth
  about twopence a pound! But, my aunt! Wasn't they blooming sick! You ought to
  have heard the language that Wicks used!"</p>

  <p>The recollection of this anticlimax amused him so much that he laughed
  aloud and had perforce to wipe his eyes with a handkerchief which might once
  have been clean.</p>

  <p>"And what became of this lead?" asked Thorndyke. "Did they take it away
  with them?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Wallis. "It wasn't no good to them. They just left it in the
  pots."</p>

  <p>"And is it in your workshop still?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, it ain't. I sold it to a builder for five bob, which paid for the gas
  that they had used and left a bit over."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what the builder wanted it for?"</p>

  <p>"Said he wanted some lead for to fix some iron railings in their
  sockets."</p>

  <p>"Did he take the whole of it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he took the whole boiling of it, and a small roll of sheet lead as
  well. But the sheet wasn't included in the five bob."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling us the name of this builder?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>Wallis looked rather hard at Thorndyke, and the slightly apprehensive
  expression reappeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"I don't see as his name is neither here nor there," said he. "What's all
  the fuss about? You was speaking of valuable property. Lead ain't valuable
  property."</p>

  <p>"For legal reasons," said Thorndyke, "I wish to trace that lead and see
  where it went to. And there is no reason for you to be secret about it. The
  transaction between you and the builder was a perfectly lawful transaction;
  but I should like to ascertain from the builder exactly what he did with the
  lead."</p>

  <p>The plumber was evidently still a little uneasy, but the question was so
  simple and straightforward that he could hardly refuse to answer.</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, grudgingly, "if you must know, the builder what I sold
  the lead to was my brother, Joe Wallis, what lives a couple of doors further
  up the street."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke. Then, turning to Miller, he said: "That is
  all I wanted to know. Probably Mr. Joe Wallis will be able to help us a stage
  further. Is there anything that you want to ask?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller; "that seems to be all plain sailing. I don't think
  we need trouble Mr. Wallis any further."</p>

  <p>With this, Thorndyke thanked the plumber for the assistance that he had
  given and we took our departure. As soon as we were outside, the
  Superintendent broke out into low-voiced
  self-congratulations&mdash;low-voiced&mdash;by reason of the fact that Mr.
  Wallis had taken his post at the shop door to observe our further
  movements.</p>

  <p>"It was just as well," said Miller, "that you were able to get the
  information without letting the cat out of the bag. It has saved a lot of
  chin-wagging. But I expect we shan't have such an easy job with our friend
  Joseph. Bert had nothing to conceal; but Joseph must have been in the swim to
  some extent. This is his house."</p>

  <p>The premises, which bore the superscription, "J. Wallis, Builder and
  Decorator," were divided into two parts, a carpenter's shop and an office. We
  entered the latter, and, as it was at the moment unoccupied, the
  Superintendent thumped on the counter with his stick; which brought out from
  some inner lair a very large youth of about eighteen who saluted us with an
  amiable grin.</p>

  <p>"Dad in?" inquired Miller, making a chance shot; which was justified by
  the result, as the youth replied:</p>

  <p>"Yes. What's it about?"</p>

  <p>"This gentleman, Dr. Thorndyke, wants to see him on important legal
  business," Miller replied; whereupon the youth grinned again and retired. In
  about a minute he returned and requested us to "walk this way," indicating
  the direction by walking in advance. We followed him across a hail and up a
  flight of stairs to a door, which he opened, and, having seen us enter, once
  more departed.</p>

  <p>The room was quite an interesting survival&mdash;a typical example of a
  Victorian tradesman's drawing room, with the typical close, musty smell. As
  we entered, I noticed that Thorndyke cast his eyes down and then took a quick
  glance at the window. But there was no time for detailed observation, for we
  were almost immediately followed by a man whom I judged from his stature and
  a certain family resemblance to be "Dad." But the resemblance did not extend
  to the amiable grin, On the contrary, the newcomer viewed us with an
  expression compounded of a sort of foxy curiosity and a perceptible tinge of
  hostility.</p>

  <p>"Which of you is Dr. Thorndyke?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>My colleague introduced himself, and the inevitable question followed.</p>

  <p>"And who are these other two gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"This," replied Miller, indicating me, "is Dr. Jervis, also a lawyer;
  and"&mdash;here he produced a professional card and pushed it across an
  'occasional table,' "that's who I am."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallis studied the card for a few moments, and the hostility of his
  expression became more pronounced. Nevertheless, he said with gruff civility:
  "Well, you may as well sit down," and gave us a lead by sitting down,
  himself, in an arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "what's this important legal business?"</p>

  <p>"It is concerned," said Thorndyke, "with certain property which came into
  your hands and which you had from your brother, Albert Wallis."</p>

  <p>"Property what I had from my brother Albert Wallis!" our friend repeated
  in obviously genuine surprise. "I haven't had no property from him. What do
  you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I am referring to certain pieces of metal which you bought from him about
  three months ago."</p>

  <p>Mr. Joseph continued to stare at Thorndyke for some seconds.</p>

  <p>"Pieces of metal!" he repeated, at length. "I haven't bought no pieces of
  metal from him, You've made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"The metal that I am referring to," said Thorndyke, "consisted of a roll
  of sheet lead and some remainders from melting-pots."</p>

  <p>"Gawd!" exclaimed Joseph, contemptuously, "you don't call that property,
  do you? I gave him five bob for the lot, and that was more than it was
  worth."</p>

  <p>"So I understood," said Thorndyke. "But we have reasons for wishing to
  trace that metal. We have managed to trace it to you, and we should be
  greatly obliged if you would tell us what has become of it, supposing it not
  to be still in your possession."</p>

  <p>At this persistence on Thorndyke's part, the hostility expressed in
  Joseph's countenance became tinged with unmistakeable uneasiness.
  Nevertheless, he answered truculently enough:</p>

  <p>"I don't see what business it is of yours what I do with the material that
  I buy. But, if you must know, I used that sheet lead for making a
  damp-course, and the other stuff for fixing some iron railings in a stone
  kerb."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "somebody has got some pretty valuable iron
  railings."</p>

  <p>Wallis looked at him inquiringly, and from him to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said the latter, "I had better explain. Some time ago, two men,
  one of whom was named Wicks, stole a case containing a quantity of platinum
  from the cloak room at Fenchurch Street. They took it to the house of your
  brother Albert, who, not knowing what it was, or anything about it, allowed
  them to melt it down in his workshop. But, when they had melted it down, they
  did not recognize it. They thought it was lead, and that they had taken the
  wrong case. So they left the lumps in the melting-pots for your brother to do
  what he pleased with. But he, also, did not recognize the metal. He, also,
  thought that it was lead; and he sold the whole consignment to you for five
  shillings. And I take it that you, like the others, mistook it for lead."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallis had suddenly become attentive and interested.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I took it for lead," said he. "And you say it was platinum.
  That's rather expensive stuff, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"The little lot," said Miller, "that you bought for five shillings has
  been valued at just under eighteen thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>That "knocked him," as they say in the Old Kent Road, For some seconds he
  sat speechless, clutching the arms of his chair and staring at Miller as if
  he had been some dreadful apparition.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen thousand pounds!" he exclaimed, at length, in something
  approaching a screech. "Eighteen&mdash;thousand&mdash;pounds! And to
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, "to think of those iron railings. We shall have to see
  that you don't go rooting them up."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallis made no reply. As with the dying gladiator, "his thoughts were
  far away," and I had little doubt whither they had strayed. I do not profess
  to be a thought-reader; but the expression on Joseph's face conveyed clearly
  to me that he had, in that moment, decided, as soon as the night fell, to
  make a bee-line for Josiah Pippet's vault. His reverie was interrupted by
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"So, Mr. Wallis," said he, "you will understand our natural anxiety to
  find out where this metal went to."</p>

  <p>"But I've told you," said Wallis, rousing himself from dreams of sudden
  opulence, "so far as I can recollect, that I used the stuff to plant some
  iron railings."</p>

  <p>As we seemed to have got into a blind alley, the Superintendent abruptly
  changed his tone.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about those iron railings," he said, sharply. "We want to know
  what you did with that stuff. Are you going to tell us?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you," Wallis replied doggedly. "You can't expect me to
  remember what I did with every bit of lead that I bought."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miller, "then perhaps it might help your memory if we
  were to do a bit of supposing. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"You can if you like," Joseph replied, sulkily, "so long as you don't ask
  me to help you."</p>

  <p>"Now, Wallis," said Miller, "you've got to bear this in mind. Those two
  fools didn't know this stuff when they had got it in their hands, and neither
  did you or Bert. But there were other people who knew what was in that case.
  Bassett, the man who murdered Wicks, knew, because he put the stuff in the
  Case. And there was another man, a very artful gentleman, who kept out of
  sight but who knew all about it. We mustn't mention names, so we will just
  call him Mr. Rumbler, because he rumbled what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Now, supposing this Mr. Rumbler, knowing where the stuff had been left by
  those two gabeys, had a bright idea for getting hold of it without showing
  his hand. Supposing he went to a certain undertaker whose place was close to
  Bert's and pitched him a yarn about wanting a dummy coffin weighted with
  lead. Supposing he employed him to make that coffin, knowing that he would be
  certain to get his lead from Bert, and plant it in a nice convenient vault in
  a disused burial ground&mdash;say, somewhere out Stratford way&mdash;where he
  could get at it easily with a big skeleton key and a tommy to turn it with.
  How's that? Mind you, I am only supposing."</p>

  <p>As Miller recited his fable, a cloud fell on Mr. Wallis's countenance. The
  dream of sudden opulence was dissipated. The resurrection job was obviously
  "off." But, glum as the expression of Joseph's face became, the effect
  produced was not quite the one on which Miller had based his
  calculations.</p>

  <p>"If you know where the coffin is," was the natural comment, "why don't you
  go and open it and take the stuff out?"</p>

  <p>"Because," Miller replied, impressively, "the stuff isn't there. Somebody
  has had the coffin open and taken it out."</p>

  <p>Even this did not answer. Wallis looked sulky enough, but he had not
  gorged the bait.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe there is any coffin," said he. "You've just invented it
  to try to get me to say something."</p>

  <p>I detected an expression of grim amusement on Thorndyke's face. Perhaps he
  was contrasting&mdash;as I was&mdash;Miller's present proceedings with the
  lofty standard of veracity among police officers that he had presented to
  Bunter. But I was also aware of some signs of impatience. As a matter of
  fact, all these artful probings on Miller's part were getting us nowhere.
  Moreover, we had really ascertained nearly all that we wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Thorndyke, "as I am not a police officer, I may venture to
  be a little more explicit with Mr. Wallis. We are not interested in the
  present whereabouts of this platinum. We know where it is; but we want to
  know exactly how it got there. As to the coffin, we have evidence that it was
  made by you, Mr. Wallis, and planted by you in the vault. But this coffin was
  made to some person's order, and we want to know with certainty who that
  person is. At present, our information is to the effect that it was made to
  the order of a Mr. Gimbler, a solicitor who resides in the neighbourhood of
  Kennington. But Mr. Gimbler has managed to keep, to some extent, out of sight
  and put the whole responsibility on you. Even the dust that was found in the
  vault was your dust. It came from this very room."</p>

  <p>At this latter statement, Wallis started visibly, and so did Miller.</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" the latter exclaimed, after a glance at the floor and
  another at the window, "here is the identical carpet that you described in
  court, and there are the blue cotton curtains."</p>

  <p>"So you see, Mr. Wallis," Thorndyke continued, "you have nothing to
  conceal respecting the coffin. The facts are known to us. The question is,
  are you prepared to tell us the name of the person to whose order this coffin
  was made?"</p>

  <p>"If you know his name," was the reply, "you don't want me to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"Your evidence," said Thorndyke, "would save us a good deal of trouble,
  and perhaps it might save you some trouble, too. Are you prepared to tell us
  who this person was?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the dogged reply. "I'm not going to tell you nothing. The least
  said the soonest mended. I don't know nothing about any coffin, and I don't
  believe there ever was any coffin."</p>

  <p>At this reply Miller's face hardened, and I think he was about to pursue
  the matter farther; but Thorndyke calmly and civilly brought the interview to
  a close.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Wallis," said he, "you must do as you think best. I feel that
  you would have been wiser to have been more open with us; but we cannot
  compel you to give us information which you choose to withhold."</p>

  <p>With this, he rose, and Miller reluctantly followed suit, looking
  distinctly sulky. But nothing further was said until, shepherded by our host,
  we had descended to the office and had been thence launched into the street.
  Then Miller made his protest.</p>

  <p>"I think, Doctor," said he, "that it is a pity you didn't let me play him
  a little longer. I believe he would have let on if we had kept rubbing into
  him that he had been used as a cat's paw by Gimbler to get hold of that
  platinum."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he would," said Thorndyke. "He is an obstinate man, and he
  evidently doesn't like the idea of turning upon his employer; and we can
  hardly blame him for that. But, after all, Miller, what would have been the
  use of going on with him? We have got a complete train of evidence. We have
  got Bunter's written and signed statement that he left the platinum in Bert
  Wallis's workshop. We have got Bert Wallis's statement, made before
  witnesses, that he sold the stuff to his brother Joe Wallis. We have got Joe
  Wallis's statement, made before witnesses, that he bought the stuff from
  Bert. We know that Joe is a coffin maker, and that the stuff was found in a
  coffin, together with certain dust which came from a room which was identical
  in character with Joe Wallis's drawing room. The agreement is complete, even
  without the dust."</p>

  <p>"So it is," Miller agreed; "but it proves the wrong thing. We can fix this
  job on Joseph all right. But it isn't Joseph that we want. He is only the
  jackal; but we want the lion&mdash;Gimbler. And if Joseph won't talk, we've
  got no direct evidence against Gimbler."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "You are magnifying the difficulties, Miller,"
  said he. "I don't know what you, or the Public Prosecutor, may propose to do;
  but I can tell you what I am going to do, if you don't. I am going to lay a
  sworn information charging Gimbler with having conspired with Joseph Wallis
  to commit certain fraudulent acts including the manufacture of false
  evidence, calculated and intended to defeat the ends of justice. We have
  enough evidence to convict him without any assistance from Wallis; but I
  think you will find that Joseph, when he discovers that he is involved in a
  fraud of which he knew nothing, will be far from willing to share the burden
  of that fraud with Gimbler. I think you can take it that Joseph will tell all
  that he knows (and perhaps a little more) when we begin to turn the screw. At
  any rate, I am quite satisfied with my case against Gimbler."</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," said Miller in a less gloomy tone, "if you see your way to
  a conviction, I have nothing more to say. It's all I want."</p>

  <p>Here the subject dropped; and the effect of the sandwiches having by this
  time worn off, we agreed with one accord to seek some reputable place of
  entertainment to make up the arrears in the matter of nourishment. As those
  arrears were somewhat considerable, the settling of them occupied our whole
  attention for a time; and it was not until our cravings had been satisfied
  and the stage of coffee and pipes had been reached that Miller suddenly
  raised a question which I had been expecting, and which I had secretly
  decided to raise, myself, at the first opportunity.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Doctor," said he, "what about that head in the box? All these
  alarums and excursions in chase of that blooming platinum had driven it out
  of my head. But, now that we have done with the metal, at least for the
  present, supposing we have a word about the box. From the questions that you
  put to Bunter, it is clear to me that you have given the matter more
  attention than I had supposed; and it is obvious that you know something. I
  wonder how much you know."</p>

  <p>"Not very much," replied Thorndyke; "but I shall probably know more when I
  have made a few inquiries. You are so far right that I have given the affair
  some attention, though not a great deal. But when I heard of the discovery in
  the cloak room, and afterwards read the account of the inquest, I formed
  certain opinions&mdash;quite speculatively, of course&mdash;as to what the
  incident probably meant; and I even formed a still more speculative opinion
  as to the identity of one, at least, of the persons who might be concerned in
  the affair. Bunter's account of the passenger with the parcel seemed to agree
  with my hypothesis, and his answers to my questions seemed to support my
  identification of the person. That is all. Of actual, definite knowledge I
  have none."</p>

  <p>"And your opinions," said Miller, a trifle sourly, "I suppose you are
  going to keep to yourself."</p>

  <p>"For the present, I propose to," Thorndyke replied, suavely. "You can see,
  from what Bunter said, that the affair is of no importance to you. If a crime
  has been committed, it has not been committed within your jurisdiction. But
  leave the matter in my hands for a little longer. I believe that I shall be
  able to elucidate it; and you know that you can depend on me to keep nothing
  from you that ought, as a matter of public policy, to be communicated to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that," Miller admitted, grudgingly, "and I see that the case
  is not what we supposed it to be. Very well, Doctor. Have it your own way,
  but let us have the information as soon as it is available."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made the required promise; and, if the Superintendent was not as
  satisfied as he professed to be, it was only because, like me, he was
  devoured with curiosity as to what the solution of the mystery might be.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE END OF THE CASE AND OTHER MATTERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE proceedings in the Probate Court at the third hearing of
  the Winsborough Peerage Case were brief but somewhat dramatic. As soon as the
  judge had taken his seat, Mr. McGonnell rose and addressed him to the
  following effect:</p>

  <p>"I have, this morning, my lord, to bring to your lordship's notice certain
  facts which would seem to make it unnecessary to proceed with the case which
  has been before the court. That case was an application by Mr. Christopher
  Pippet for permission to presume the death of Percy Engleheart, Sixth Earl of
  Winsborough. Now, in the interval since the last hearing, information has
  reached the Earl's representatives that the said Earl Percy died about three
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"You say 'about' three years ago," said the judge.</p>

  <p>"The exact date, my lord, has not been ascertained, and is not,
  apparently, ascertainable, but it is believed that the Earl's death took
  place some time in March, 1918. The uncertainty, however, relates only to the
  time when the death occurred; of the fact that it did occur there appears to
  be no doubt at all. I understand that the body has been recovered and
  identified and is being sent to England. These facts were communicated to me
  by Mr. Brodribb; and perhaps the Earl's representatives might more properly
  inform your lordship as to the exact circumstances in which the Earl's death
  occurred."</p>

  <p>Here McGonnell sat down and Anstey took up the tale.</p>

  <p>"The tidings of the Earl's death, my lord, were conveyed to us in a letter
  written by a certain Major Pitt at Par&aacute; and dated the 13th of last October.
  The facts set forth in that letter were briefly these:</p>

  <p>"In the latter part of 1917 and the beginning of 1918, Major Pitt and the
  Earl were travelling together in the neighbourhood of the River Amazon,
  shooting, collecting and exploring. About the middle of January, 1918, the
  Earl announced his intention to explore the tract of country inhabited by the
  Munderucu Indians; and, as Major Pitt had planned a journey along the main
  stream of the Amazon, they separated and went their respective ways. That was
  the last time that Major Pitt saw the Earl alive, and for three years he had
  no knowledge of the Earl's whereabouts or what he was doing. The Major,
  himself, made a long journey and was several times laid up for long periods
  with severe attacks of fever. It was not until the spring of the present year
  that he, at last, got tidings as to what had befallen his friend. Then,
  taking the Munderucu country on his way back to the coast, he learned from
  some natives that a white man had come to the country some three years
  previously and had died from fever soon after his arrival, which would be
  about March, 1918.</p>

  <p>"On this, Major Pitt made more particular inquiries, the result of which
  was to leave no doubt that the man who had died could be none other than the
  Earl Percy. However, the Major, realizing the importance of accurate
  information, not only assembled the dead man's effects&mdash;a considerable
  part of which he was able to recover, and which he was, of course, able to
  identify&mdash;but he went so far as to cause the body to be disinterred.
  Naturally, it was, in the ordinary sense, unrecognizable; but by the stature
  and by certain characters, particularly the teeth, some of which had been
  filled with gold, he was able to identify it with certainty as the body of
  Earl Percy.</p>

  <p>"But, to make assurance doubly sure, he commissioned the natives&mdash;who
  have great skill in preserving bodies&mdash;to preserve this corpse, in so
  far as there was anything to preserve, so that it could be sent to England
  for further examination if such examination should seem necessary or
  expedient. But the Major's description of the body, the clothing, the
  weapons, scientific instruments and other effects, together with the natives'
  description of the man, the time of his arrival, and all the other
  circumstances, leave no doubt whatever that this man was really the Earl
  Percy."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the judge, "if the fact of the Earl's death is to be
  accepted as proved, the application for permission to presume death
  necessarily lapses, automatically. And the applicant's claim to be the heir
  presumptive also lapses. He will now claim to be the heir; and that claim
  will have to be preferred in another place."</p>

  <p>"I understand, my lord," said McGonnell, "that it is not proposed to
  proceed with the claim. That is what I am informed by Mr. Pippet."</p>

  <p>The judge glanced at the vacant solicitors' table and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Was that decision reached on the advice of his solicitor?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord. Mr. Gimbler is not in court, and, I believe, is absent from
  his residence. I understand that he has been unexpectedly called away from
  home."</p>

  <p>The judge received this piece of information with an inscrutable face.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to express an opinion," he remarked, "as to whether Mr.
  Pippet is well or ill advised to abandon his claim; but I may point out that
  the crucial question is still in suspense. According to the evidence which we
  have heard, the coffin which was examined was not the coffin of Josiah
  Pippet, and, consequently, the question whether the funeral was a real or a
  sham funeral has not been settled, It is unfortunate that that important
  issue should have been confused by what look like highly irregular
  proceedings; concerning which I may say that they will call for further
  investigation and that I shall consider it my duty to hand the papers in this
  case to the Director of Public Prosecutions."</p>

  <p>This rather ominous observation brought the proceedings to an end; and, as
  we were no longer litigants, the whole party trooped out of the court to
  gather in the great hail for more or less friendly, unofficial discussion.
  Mr. Pippet was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"His lordship," he remarked, "was extremely delicate in his language. I
  should call the proceedings in regard to that coffin something more than
  irregular."</p>

  <p>"His lordship," McGonnell remarked, "was probably bearing in mind that all
  the facts are not known. He, no doubt, has his suspicions as to what has
  happened and who is responsible; but, until the suspicions have been
  verified, it is as well not to be too explicit in assigning responsibility to
  individuals."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet smiled grimly. "It is well for you to say that, Mr. McGonnell,"
  said he, "seeing that both you and I are involved in those suspicions. But I
  am not inclined to take this business lying down, if you are. Gimbler was
  acting as my agent and I suppose I am responsible for whatever he chose to
  do, ostensibly in my interests. But I presume I have some remedy. Is it
  possible for me to prosecute him? You are my legal adviser. I put the
  question to you. What remedy have I for being involved in this discreditable
  affair?"</p>

  <p>Mr. McGonnell looked uncomfortable, as well he might, for he was in an
  unpleasant position in more than one respect. After a few moments'
  reflection, he replied:</p>

  <p>"I have as little reason as you have to be pleased with the turn of
  events. If a fraud has been committed in this case, that will not enhance my
  professional reputation. But I must again remind you that we have not got all
  the facts. It does certainly appear as if that coffin had been tampered with;
  and if it had, the responsibility lies between you and me and Mr. Gimbler.
  Evidently, the suspicion lies principally on Gimbler. But, having regard to
  the fact that a quantity of stolen property&mdash;which was certainly not
  his&mdash;was found in the coffin, there is a clear possibility that the
  coffin may have been tampered with by some persons for their own purposes and
  without his knowledge. We have to bear that in mind before we make any direct
  accusations."</p>

  <p>"That is a very ingenious suggestion," said Mr. Pippet, "but it doesn't
  seem to commend itself to me. I should leave it to him to prove, if he
  can."</p>

  <p>McGonnell shook his head. "That is not the position, at all, Mr. Pippet,"
  said he. "If you assert that Gimbler planted a sham coffin in the vault, it
  will be for you to prove that he did, not for him to prove that he did not.
  But I think that you had better take the advice of a solicitor on the
  subject, or, at any rate, of some lawyer other than me. You will understand
  that I shall naturally be reluctant to be the first to set up a hue and cry
  after a man who has been my colleague in this case. If he has committed a
  fraud, I hope that he will receive the punishment that he will have deserved;
  but I should rather that some hand other than mine delivered the blow."</p>

  <p>"I understand and respect your point of view," said Pippet, "but it leaves
  me high and dry without any legal guidance."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke interposed. "If I might venture to offer you a word of
  advice, Mr. Pippet," said he, "it would be that you do nothing at all. If any
  offence against the law has been committed, you may rely on the proper
  authorities to take the necessary measures."</p>

  <p>"But suppose they regard me as the offender?"</p>

  <p>"When you are accused, it will be time to take measures of defence. At
  present, no one is accusing you&mdash;at least, I think I may say so. Am I
  right, Superintendent?" he asked, turning to Miller, who had been
  unostentatiously listening to the conversation.</p>

  <p>The Superintendent was guarded in his reply. "Speaking personally," said
  he, "I am certainly not accusing Mr. Pippet of any complicity in this fraud,
  if there has really been a fraud. Later, I may have to apply to him for some
  information as to his relations with Mr. Gimbler; but that is in the future.
  For the present, your advice to him is the best. Just wait and see what
  happens."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile," said Thorndyke, "if it appears that Mr. Gimbler has
  withdrawn himself from among us permanently, I am sure that Mr. Brodribb will
  consent to take charge of your affairs so far as recovery of documents and
  other winding up details are concerned."</p>

  <p>To this, Brodribb agreed readily, to Mr. Pippet's evident relief.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the latter, "as we have disposed of business matters, I am
  going to propose that we make up a little luncheon party to celebrate the end
  of the Winsborough Peerage Case. I'd like to have the whole crowd, but I
  suspect that there are one or two who will cry off."</p>

  <p>His suspicions were confirmed on particular inquiry. McGonnell had
  business at the Central Criminal Court; Mrs. Engleheart and Miss Pippet had
  some secret mission, the nature of which they refused to divulge, and Anstey
  had other legal fish to fry.</p>

  <p>"Am I to have the pleasure of your lordship's company at lunch?" Pippet
  inquired, fixing a twinkling eye on Mr. Giles, and obviously convinced that
  he was not.</p>

  <p>Giles laughed, knowingly. "I should have been delighted," said he, "to
  lunch with my noble cousin, or uncle, or whatever he is, but I have an
  engagement with another noble cousin. I am taking Jenny to the Zoo to show
  her the new chimpanzee, and we shall get our lunch on the way."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pippet shook his head resignedly and turned to the faithful few,
  consisting of Thorndyke, Brodribb Miller and myself, and suggested an
  immediate adjournment. Thorndyke and I retired to the robing room to divest
  ourselves of our legal war-paint, and, on emerging, rejoined the party at the
  main gate, where two taxis were already waiting, and were forthwith conveyed
  to Mr. Pippet's hotel.</p>

  <p>Throughout these proceedings and those of the subsequent luncheon, I was
  aware of a rather curious feeling of pleased surprise at our host's attitude
  and apparent state of mind. Especially did I admire the sporting spirit in
  which he accepted his defeat. He was not in the least cast down; and, apart
  from the discreditable incidents in the conduct of the case, he appeared
  perfectly satisfied with the result. But the oddest thing to me was his
  friendly and even deferential attitude towards Thorndyke. A stranger,
  unacquainted with the circumstances, might have supposed my colleague to be
  the leading counsel who had achieved a notable victory for Mr. Pippet,
  instead of an expert witness who had, vulgarly speaking, "put the kybosh" on
  Mr. Pippet's case. Any pique that he might, quite naturally, have felt seemed
  to be swallowed up by a keen sporting interest in the manner in which he had
  been defeated; and I was not surprised when, as the luncheon approached the
  coffee and cigar stage, he began to put out feelers for more detailed
  information.</p>

  <p>"This trial," said he, "has been to me an education and an entertainment.
  I've enjoyed every bit of it, and I'm only sorry that we missed the judge's
  summing-up and reasoned decision. But the real tit-bit of the entertainment
  was Dr. Thorndyke's evidence. What delighted me was the instantaneous way in
  which every move in the game was spotted and countered. Those screws, now; it
  was all obvious enough when it was explained. But the astonishing thing was
  that, not only was the character of those screws observed, but the
  significance of that character appreciated in a moment. I want you to tell
  me, Doctor, how you manage to keep your eyes perpetually skinned, and your
  brain skinned at the same time."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled appreciatively as he thoughtfully filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"You are giving me more credit than is due, Mr. Pippet," said he. "You are
  assuming that certain reactions were instantaneous which were, in fact, quite
  deliberate, and that certain deceptive appearances were exhibited to
  unprepared eyes whereas they had been carefully considered in advance. I have
  no doubt that the person who prepared the evidence made a similar
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"But," objected Mr. Pippet, "I don't see how you could consider in advance
  things that you didn't know were going to happen."</p>

  <p>"It is possible to consider in advance," Thorndyke replied, "those
  circumstances which may conceivably arise as well as those which will
  certainly arise. You seem to think that the little surprise packets which the
  manipulator of evidence devised for our undoing found us all unprepared. That
  was certainly the intention of the manipulator; but it was very far from what
  actually happened."</p>

  <p>"Why call him 'the manipulator'?" Mr. Pippet protested. "His name is
  Horatio Gimbler, and we all know it."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "then we will throw legal caution to the
  winds and call him Gimbler. Now, as I said, Gimbler made his little
  arrangements, expecting that they would come on us with all the charm of
  novelty and find us unprepared to give them that exhaustive consideration
  which would be necessary to ascertain their real nature, but which would be
  impossible in the course of proceedings in court. He would assume that,
  whatever vague suspicions we might have, there would be neither the time nor
  the opportunity to test the visible facts presented. What he had overlooked
  was the possibility that the other players might try the moves over in
  advance. But this is exactly what I did. Would it interest you to have some
  details of my procedure?"</p>

  <p>"It would interest me very much," Brodribb interposed, "for, as you know,
  I sat on the bird-lime like a lamb&mdash;if you will pardon the mixed
  metaphor. Perhaps I might say 'like a fool' and be nearer the mark."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't, Mr. Brodribb," said Pippet, "because the description
  would include the lot of us, except the Doctor. But I am sure we should all
  like to hear how that rascal, Gimbler, was unmasked."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "let us begin by noting what our position was.
  This was a claim advanced by an unknown person to a title and some extremely
  valuable property. The claimant was an American, but there was nothing
  significant in that. All Americans of English origin have, of course, English
  ancestors. What was significant was the fact that this stranger had elected
  to employ a police court solicitor to conduct his case. Taking all the
  circumstances together, there was quite a fair probability that the claim was
  a false claim; and if that were so, we should have to be on the look-out for
  false evidence.</p>

  <p>"That was my function in the case; to watch the evidence, particularly in
  regard to the physical characteristics of any objects produced as 'exhibits'
  or put in evidence. The purely legal business was in the hands of Mr.
  Brodribb and Mr. Anstey, whereas I was a sort of Devil's Advocate, in an
  inverted sense, concerned, not with the legal issues, but with illegal
  attempts to tamper with the evidence. Now, in the criminal department of my
  practice, I have been in the habit, from the first, of using what I may call
  a synthetic method. In investigating a known or suspected crime, my custom
  has been to put myself in the criminal's place and ask myself what are the
  possible methods of committing that crime, and, of the possible methods,
  which would be the best; how, in fact, I should go about committing that
  crime, myself. Having worked out in detail the most suitable procedure, I
  then change over from the synthetic to the analytic method and consider all
  the inherent weaknesses and defects of the method, and the means by which it
  would be possible to detect the crime.</p>

  <p>"That is what I did in the present case. I began by assuming that wherever
  the evidence was insufficient or adverse, that evidence would be
  falsified."</p>

  <p>"Sounds a bit uncharitable," Mr. Pippet remarked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," retorted Thorndyke. "There was no accusation. It was merely
  a working hypothesis which I communicated to nobody. If there had been no
  falsification, nothing would ever have been said and nobody would ever have
  known that the possibility had been entertained. But supposing falsification
  to be attempted, what form would it take? Apart from mere oral tradition and
  rumour, the value of which the judge would be able to assess, there was very
  little evidence. Of real, demonstrable evidence there were only two
  items&mdash;the diary and the coffin. Let us take the diary first. In what
  respects was falsification of the diary possible?</p>

  <p>"There were two possibilities. The entire diary might be a fabrication.
  This was extremely unlikely. There were seven volumes, extending over a great
  number of years. The fabrication of such a diary would be a gigantic and very
  difficult task. Still, it was possible; but if the diary was in fact a
  fabrication from beginning to end, the falsification would almost certainly
  have been the work of the claimant, himself. But when one considers that the
  latest volume of this dairy was alleged to have been written eighty years
  ago, it is obvious that the difficulties surrounding the production of a new
  work which could possibly be passed off as genuine would be practically
  insurmountable. I need not consider those difficulties or the means by which
  the fraud could be detected, since the case did not arise. On inspection, it
  was obvious that the diary was a genuine document.</p>

  <p>"The second possibility was the insertion of a false entry; and this was
  not only quite practicable but, in the known circumstances, not very
  improbable. The question was, therefore, supposing a false entry to be
  inserted, would that entry have any special characteristics for which one
  could be on the look-out? And the answer was that it almost certainly
  would.</p>

  <p>"As to the forgery, itself; it would certainly be a good forgery. For, if
  it had been executed by the claimant, it would have to be good enough to
  satisfy Mr. Gimbler. That gentleman was too experienced a lawyer to attempt
  to pass off an indifferent forgery in a court of law. But if it were not the
  work of the claimant, it would have to be produced either by Gimbler,
  himself, or under his superintendence. In either case it would certainly be a
  first-class forgery; and, as the passage would probably be quite
  short&mdash;possibly only a few words&mdash;it would be almost impossible to
  detect by mere examination of the written characters. In a short passage, the
  forger's attention need never flag, and no effects of fatigue would become
  apparent. The forger could try it over and over again until he could execute
  it perfectly. But in such a case, even the greatest experts&mdash;such as
  Osborn, in America, or Mitchell or Lucas in this country&mdash;could give no
  more than a guarded opinion. For, however eminent an expert may be, he cannot
  detect differences that do not exist.</p>

  <p>"But if the imitation of the hand-writing were too good for detection to
  be possible, were there any other, extrinsic, characters that we could be on
  the look-out for? Evidently, by the nature of the case, there must be three.
  First, if a passage were inserted, it would have to be inserted where
  insertion was possible; that is to say, in a blank space. Accordingly, we
  should have to keep a look-out for blank spaces. And, if those blank spaces
  were of any considerable size, we should look for the interpolated passage or
  passages either at the beginning or end of the blank space or spaces.</p>

  <p>"The second character of an interpolated passage would be the matter
  contained in it. It would contain some matter of high evidential value which
  was not contained in any of the genuine entries; for, if it did not, there
  would be no object in inserting it. As to the nature of this matter; since
  the crucial issue in this case was whether the two persons, Josiah and the
  Earl, were one and the same person, an interpolated passage would almost
  certainly contain matter supporting the belief that they were.</p>

  <p>"The third character would be an unavoidable difference between the ink
  used for the forgery and that used by the writer of the genuine entries. They
  could not be the same unless the writer of the diary had elected to use
  carbon ink; which was infinitely improbable, and, in fact was not the case.
  If he used ordinary writing ink&mdash;the iron-gall ink of the
  period&mdash;that ink would have become changed in the course of over eighty
  years. The original black tannate or gallate of iron would have become
  converted into the faint reddish-brown of the oxide of iron. Now, the forged
  writing would have to imitate the colour of this old writing. But a new ink
  of the same colour as the old would necessarily be of a different chemical
  composition. Probably it would contain no iron, but would be one of the
  modern brown drawing inks, treated to match the colour exactly.</p>

  <p>"In this difference of chemical composition would lie the means of
  detecting and exposing the forgery. A chemical test would probably be
  objected to, though it could be insisted on if the forgery were definitely
  challenged. But, for the reasons that I gave in my evidence, a photograph
  would be nearly certain to demonstrate the difference in the chemical
  composition of the ink. And to a photograph there could be no objection.</p>

  <p>"Thus, you see, the whole matter had been examined in advance, so that, if
  a forgery should be offered in evidence, we knew exactly what it would be
  like. And when it did appear, it corresponded perfectly with the hypothetical
  forgery. We heard McGonnell read out, in his opening statement, a number of
  quotations from the diary, all very vague and unconvincing; and then, at the
  end, a single short entry of an entirely different character, explicitly
  implying the identity of the two persons, Josiah and the Earl. Here was one
  of the characters of the possible forgery; and when Anstey had elicited in
  cross-examination that neither you nor your sister had seen it before the
  book went into the hands of Mr. Gimbler, it became a probable forgery. Then,
  on inspection, it was seen to have another of the postulated characters; it
  was at the end of a blank space. Finally, on closer examination, it was found
  to have the third character; it was written in an ink which was different
  from that used in the rest of the diary.</p>

  <p>"So much for the forgery. In the case of the coffin a similar method was
  used. I put myself in Gimbler's place and considered the best way in which to
  carry out the substitution."</p>

  <p>"But," objected Mr. Pippet, "Gimbler had never suggested any examination
  of the coffin. On the contrary he had decided to avoid any reference to an
  examination until the case went to the House of Lords. I thought he was
  giving that coffin as wide a berth as he could."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "That was the impression that he managed to
  convey to us all. And it was that which made me suspect strongly that a
  substitution was intended. It looked to me like a very subtle and admirable
  tactical manoeuvre. For, you see, the examination could not be avoided. It
  was impossible to burke the coffin, and Gimbler knew it. Not only was it the
  one piece of definite and undeniable evidence in the case; it contained the
  means of settling conclusively the whole issue that was before the court. If
  Gimbler did not produce the coffin, himself, it would certainly be demanded
  by the other side or by the judge.</p>

  <p>"But now observe the subtlety of Gimbler's tactics. The crude thing to do
  would have been to make the substitution and then apply for an order of the
  court to have the coffin examined. But in that case, the coffin would have
  been approached by the other side with a certain amount of suspicion, and
  minutely scrutinized. But when Gimbler seemed to have been taken by surprise,
  and to agree reluctantly to the examination of the coffin, the suspicion that
  he had got it all ready and prepared for the examination would be unlikely to
  arise. 'The other side' would be caught off their guard."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" chuckled Brodribb, "and so they were. I was quite shocked
  and embarrassed when I saw you sniffing round that coffin and openly showing
  that you suspected a fraud; and McGonnell was really and genuinely
  indignant."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pippet, "he very much resented the implied doubt as to his
  good faith, and I must admit that I thought the Doctor a trifle
  over-sceptical. But don't let me interrupt. I want to hear how you
  anticipated so exactly what Gimbler would do."</p>

  <p>"As I said," Thorndyke resumed, "it was by putting myself in Gimbler's
  place and considering how I should go about making this substitution. There
  were two possible methods. One was to open the old coffin and take out the
  body, if there was one there; the other was to prepare a new coffin to look
  like an old one. The first method was much the better if it could have been
  properly carried out. But there were one or two serious difficulties. In the
  first place, there would, presumably, have been a corpse to dispose of, and
  the operators might have objected to handling it. But the most serious
  objection was the possibility of a mishap in opening the coffin. It was an
  old coffin, and the wood might be extensively decayed. If, in the process of
  opening it, the lid should have broken or some other damage should have been
  done, the fraud would have been hopelessly exposed. For no repair would be
  possible. But in any case, an ancient coffin could not have been opened
  without leaving some plainly visible traces.</p>

  <p>"The second plan had several advantages. The new coffin could be prepared
  at leisure and thoroughly examined, and the proceedings on the spot could be
  quite short. You remember that there is, adjoining the burial ground, a
  stable yard with an empty cart shed in which a van could be housed while the
  substitution was being made. There would be little more to do than drive into
  the yard, exchange the coffins and drive away again. I considered both plans
  in detail and eventually decided that the second one was the one that would
  be more probably adopted.</p>

  <p>"Now, suppose that it was; what would the exact procedure be, and what
  pit-falls lay in wait for the operators? What would they have to do, and what
  mistakes would they probably make in doing it? In the first place, the coffin
  would pretty certainly be made by a regular coffin-maker; and the chances
  were a hundred to one, or more, that he would use modern screws and try to
  produce the appearance of age by rusting them. If he did, the coffin would be
  definitely labelled as a fabrication beyond any possible dispute.</p>

  <p>"Then there was the sheet-lead. What he would put in would most probably
  be modern, silver-free milled lead, whereas the original would almost
  certainly have been cast sheet. Still, he might have got some old sheet lead;
  and in any case the discrepancy would not have been conclusive or very
  convincing to the judge. We could not have given a definite date, as in the
  case of the screws.</p>

  <p>"The next pit-fall would be the dust. In that vault, everything would be
  covered with a mantle of dust of eighty years' growth. But if once that dust
  were disturbed&mdash;as it necessarily would be in moving the
  coffin&mdash;there would be no possibility of obliterating the marks of
  disturbance. There would be nothing for it but to sweep the vault out clean
  and blow in a fresh supply of dust which would settle down in a smooth and
  even layer. And there one could confidently expect that a serious mistake
  would be made. To most persons, dust is just simply dust; a material quite
  devoid of individual character. Few people realize consciously that dust is
  merely a collection of particles detached from larger bodies, and that when
  those particles are magnified by the microscope, they reveal themselves as
  recognizable fragments of those bodies. If our friends blew dust into the
  vault, it would be dust that had been collected <i>ad hoc</i> and would be
  demonstrably the wrong sort of dust.</p>

  <p>"That was how I reasoned the matter out in advance; and you will see that,
  when I came to the vault, all that I had to do was to note whether the
  appearances were normal or whether they corresponded to the false appearances
  which were already in my mind. As soon as I saw the screws, the question was
  answered. It remained only to look for additional details of evidence such as
  the dust and anything that might be distinctive in the character of the
  lead."</p>

  <p>"The platinum, I take it," said Pippet, "had not been included in your
  forecast?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "That was a free gift of Providence. It came as a
  complete surprise; and I might easily have missed it but for the rule that I
  have made to let nothing pass without examination. In accordance with this
  routine procedure, I took up each piece of lead and inspected it to see if it
  showed any peculiarities by which it would be possible to date it. As soon as
  I lifted the first lump of platinum alloy, I realized that Providence had
  delivered the gay deceiver into our hands."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pippet, "that was a stroke of pure luck. But it wasn't
  necessary. I can see that your method of playing a trial game over in
  advance&mdash;of ascertaining what your adversary may do, instead of waiting
  to see what he does do&mdash;brings you to the table with all the trumps up
  your sleeve, ready to be produced if the chance occurs."</p>

  <p>He reflected awhile, stirring his coffee thoughtfully, and, apparently
  turning something over in his mind. At length, he looked up at Thorndyke and
  disclosed the subject of his cogitations.</p>

  <p>"You have told us, Doctor," said he, "that you got this vanishing coffin
  stunt worked out in advance in all its details. But there is one little
  matter that you have not referred to, and it happens to be one which
  interests me a good deal. I am wondering what has become of Josiah. It may
  seem only a matter of sentiment; but he was my grandfather, and I feel that
  it is up to me to see him put back in his proper residence in accordance with
  his wishes and the arrangements which he made during his life. Now, did the
  advance scheme that you drew up include any plans for disposing of
  Josiah?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Thorndyke, "Assuming a new coffin to be used, the
  disposal of the old one was an important part of the problem; important to
  those who had to carry out the proceedings, and to us who had to prove that
  they had been carried out. The recovery and production of the old coffin
  would be conclusive evidence for the prosecution."</p>

  <p>"Well, now," said Pippet, "tell us how you proposed to dispose of Josiah
  and how you intend to go about getting him back."</p>

  <p>"There were two possible methods," said Thorndyke, "of getting rid of the
  old coffin. First, since a van or cart must have been used to bring the new
  coffin to the vault, it would have been available to take the old one away.
  This would have been a bad method, both for the plotters and for us; for it
  would have left them with the coffin on their hands, and us with the task of
  finding out where it had been hidden. So we will leave it until we have dealt
  with the more obvious and reasonable plan. I did not propose to bring the
  coffin away at all."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that you proposed to bury it?" said Pippet.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "There was no need to. You have forgotten the
  arrangement of the place. There were six vaults, each secured only by a
  large, simple lock. Now, our friends must have had a big, strong skeleton key
  to open Josiah's vault. With the same key they could have opened any of the
  other vaults; and there was a perfectly excellent and convenient
  hiding-place."</p>

  <p>"Gee!" chuckled Mr. Pippet. "That's a quaint idea! To think that, while we
  were poring over that dummy coffin, Josiah, himself, was quietly reposing
  next door! But I guess you are right, Doctor; and the question is, what are
  you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"It is your move, Miller," said he. "You have got the skeleton key, and
  you have the Home Office authority."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," Miller replied, cautiously, "but the judge's
  order doesn't authorize us to break into any of the other vaults."</p>

  <p>"The judge's order," said Thorndyke, "doesn't say anything about a
  particular vault. It authorizes and directs you to open and examine the
  coffin of Josiah Pippet. But you haven't done anything of the sort. You
  opened the wrong coffin. You have not complied with the judge's order, and it
  is your duty to do so without delay."</p>

  <p>Miller grinned and glanced knowingly at Mr. Pippet.</p>

  <p>"That's the sort of hair-pin the Doctor is," he said, admiringly. "Thomas
  a Didymus combined with a casuist of the deepest dye. He could argue the hind
  leg off a donkey; and that donkey would have nothing for it but to get a
  wooden leg."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Brodribb intervened with some warmth. "You are doing Dr.
  Thorndyke an injustice, Superintendent," said he. "There is nothing
  casuistical in his argument. He has stated the legal position quite
  correctly, not only in the letter but in the spirit. The judge made an order
  for the examination of the coffin of Josiah Pippet for the declared purpose
  of ascertaining the nature of its contents. But we have not examined that
  coffin, and we still do not know the nature of its contents. You will
  remember that the judge, himself, pointed that out at this morning's
  proceedings."</p>

  <p>Miller was visibly impressed by these observations from the very correct
  and experienced old lawyer; and I could see that he was quite willing to be
  impressed, for he was as keen on the examination as any of us. But he was a
  police officer, and, as such, Josiah Pippet was not his pigeon. Civil cases
  were not in his province.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke evidently saw the difficulty, and proceeded adroitly to turn his
  flank.</p>

  <p>"Besides, Miller," he said, "you seem to be overlooking the importance of
  this matter in relation to a possible prosecution. A police officer of your
  experience is lawyer enough to realize the great difference in value between
  positive and negative evidence. Now, at present, all that we can do is to
  show cause for the belief that the coffin that we found in the vault was not
  Josiah's coffin. But suppose that we are able to produce the actual coffin of
  Josiah Pippet. That would leave the defence nothing to say. And, in any case,
  for the sake of your own reputation and that of the C.I.D., that coffin has
  got to be found; and common sense suggests that we begin the search in the
  most likely place."</p>

  <p>This argument disposed effectually of Miller's difficulties.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Doctor," he agreed. "We shall be expected to produce
  that coffin, or, at least, to prove its existence and its whereabouts; and I
  certainly agree with you that the vault is the most likely place in which to
  look for it. I hope we are both right, for, if it isn't there, we may be let
  in for a mighty long chase before we get hold of it."</p>

  <p>Agreement on the principle having been reached, it remained only to settle
  the details. Mr. Pippet, with characteristic American eagerness to "get on
  with it," would have started forthwith for the burial ground; but, as Miller,
  naturally, had not got the keys about him, and as Thorndyke had certain
  preparations to make, it was arranged that the parties to the expedition
  should meet at the latter's chambers at ten o'clock on the following
  morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; JOSIAH?</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was something distinctly furtive and conspiratorial in
  the appearance and bearing of the party of six which filed into the burial
  ground under the guidance of Superintendent Miller. At least, so it seemed to
  me, though the impression may have been due to Polton; who carried a small
  suit-case with a secretive and burglarious air, persisted in walking on
  tip-toe, and generally surrounded himself with the atmosphere of a veritable
  Guy Fawkes.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were all in, the Superintendent closed the gate and locked
  it from the inside, putting the key in his pocket. Then he followed us to the
  neighbourhood of the vaults, where we were screened from the gaze of possible
  onlookers.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, stating an undeniable truth, "here we are, and here
  are the vaults. We've got five to choose from, and the chances are that we
  shall open four wrong ones before we come to the right one&mdash;if there is
  a right one. What do you say, Doctor? Any choice?"</p>

  <p>"On general grounds," said Thorndyke, "it would seem that one is as likely
  as another; but on psychological grounds, I should say that there is a slight
  probability in favour of the sixth vault."</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Miller.</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Thorndyke, "although, as a hiding-place, any one vault
  would be as good as any other, I think there would be a tendency to get as
  far as possible from the vault in which the dummy coffin had been planted. It
  is merely a guess; but, as we have nothing else to guide us, I would suggest
  that we begin with number six."</p>

  <p>''While the brief discussion had been taking place, Polton had been
  peering into the keyholes with the aid of a small electric lamp and
  inspecting the edges of the respective doors. He now reported the results of
  his observations. "I think you are right, sir," said he. "There seems to be a
  trace of grease in the inside of the lock of the last door, and there is
  something that looks rather like the mark of a jemmy on the jamb of the door.
  Perhaps Mr. Miller might take a look at it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Miller, as an expert on jemmy-marks, accordingly did take a look at
  it, and was inclined to confirm our artificer's opinion; on which it was
  decided to begin operations on number six. The big skeleton key was produced
  from the Superintendent's pocket and handed to Polton, by whom it was
  tenderly anointed with oil. Then a dressing of oil was applied to the rusty
  wards of the lock by means of a feather poked in through the keyhole, and the
  key inserted. As it refused to turn, in spite of the oil, Polton produced
  from his case a "tommy"&mdash;a steel bar about a foot long&mdash;which he
  passed through the bow of the key and worked gently backwards and forwards to
  distribute the oil and avoid the risk of wrenching off the bow. After a few
  trials, the key made a complete turn, and we heard the rusty bolt grate back
  into the lock.</p>

  <p>"I expect we shall have to prise the door open," said Polton, after one or
  two vigorous tugs at the key, using the tommy as a handle. He threw back the
  lid of his suit-case, which was lying on the ground at his side, and looked
  into it&mdash;as, also, did the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure, Mr. Polton!" the latter exclaimed. "Are you aware that it
  is a misdemeanour to go abroad with housebreaking implements in your
  possession?"</p>

  <p>Polton regarded him with a cunning and crinkly smile.</p>

  <p>"May I ask, Mr. Miller," he demanded, "what you would use to force open a
  jammed door? Would you use a corkscrew or a sardine opener?"</p>

  <p>Miller chuckled, appreciatively. "Well," he said, as Polton selected a
  powerful telescopic jemmy from his outfit, "I suppose the end justifies the
  means."</p>

  <p>"You can take it, sir," said Polton, sententiously, "that people whose
  business it is to open doors have found out the best tools to do it
  with."</p>

  <p>Having delivered himself of this profound truth, he inserted the beak of
  the jemmy between the door and the jamb, gave it one or two tweaks at
  different levels, and then, grasping the key and the tommy, pulled the
  complaining door wide open.</p>

  <p>The first glance into the mouldy and dusty interior showed that
  Thorndyke's selection had been correct. There were two names on the stone
  slab above the vault, but there were three coffins; two lying in orderly
  fashion on the stone shelf, and a third flung untidily across them. That the
  latter was the coffin which we were seeking was at once suggested by the fact
  that the handles and name-plate were missing, though the spaces which they
  had occupied and the holes for the screws were conspicuously visible.</p>

  <p>"That is Josiah's coffin right enough," said Mr. Pippet, pointing to these
  marks. "There can't be a shadow of doubt."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Thorndyke, "but we mustn't leave it at that. We must put the
  two coffins side by side and make an exact comparison which can be described
  in evidence in terms of actual measurement. I noticed that the beadle had not
  taken away the trestles. We had better set them up and put this coffin on
  them. The other one can be put on the ground alongside."</p>

  <p>We fetched the trestles, and, having set them up, the four tallest of us
  proceeded to hoist out the coffin.</p>

  <p>"He's a mighty weight," Mr. Pippet remarked, as he lowered his end
  carefully to the trestles.</p>

  <p>"Probably there is a lead shell," said Miller. "There usually was in the
  better class coffins. I'm surprised they didn't put one in the dummy to make
  it a bit more convincing."</p>

  <p>While the removal was being effected, Polton, armed with the skeleton
  key&mdash;the jemmy was not required&mdash;had got the door of the other
  vault open. Thither we now proceeded, and, lifting out the empty and
  comparatively light dummy, carried it across and laid it on the ground beside
  the trestles.</p>

  <p>"The first thing," said Thorndyke, "will be to take off the name-plate and
  try it on the old coffin. An actual trial will be more convincing to a judge
  or jury than the most careful measurements."</p>

  <p>"Is it of any great importance," Mr. Pippet asked, "to prove that the
  dummy was faked by using the old coffin furniture?"</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely vital," Thorndyke replied. "How else are we to prove
  that this is the coffin of Josiah Pippet? There is no mark on it by which it
  could be identified, and we find it in a vault which is not Josiah's.
  Moreover, in the vault which is his, there is a coffin bearing his name-plate
  which is alleged to be his coffin, and which we are trying to prove is not
  his coffin."</p>

  <p>"I thought you had done that pretty effectually already," said Pippet.</p>

  <p>"We can't have too much evidence," Thorndyke rejoined; "and in any case,
  we have got to produce positive evidence of the identity of this coffin. At
  present we are only guessing, though I have no doubt that we are guessing
  right. But if we can prove that the nameplate on that coffin was removed from
  and belonged to this one, we shall have proved the identity of this one and
  the fraudulent character of the other."</p>

  <p>While Thorndyke had been arguing this rather obvious point, Polton had
  been engaged in carefully and methodically extracting, with a clock-maker's
  screw-driver, the six screws with which the name-plate was attached to the
  dummy coffin-lid. He now held one of them up for his employer's inspection,
  remarking:</p>

  <p>"You see, sir, that they used the original brass screws&mdash;the old,
  flat-ended sort; which will be better for testing purposes, as they won't go
  into a hole that wasn't properly bored for them."</p>

  <p>While the screw was being passed round and examined, he proceeded with the
  testing operations. First, he lifted the plate from its bed, whereupon there
  was disclosed an oblong patch of new, unstained wood, which he regarded with
  a contemptuous crinkle.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed, "if I had been faking a coffin, I'd at least have
  finished the faking before I screwed on the plate and not have given the show
  away like this."</p>

  <p>With this, he picked up the plate and laid it on the old coffin-lid in the
  vacant space, which it fitted exactly. Then, with a fine awl, he felt through
  one of the corner holes of the plate for the corresponding hole in the wood,
  and, having found it, dropped in one of the screws and ran it lightly home.
  Next, in the same manner, he probed the hole in the opposite corner of the
  plate, dropped in the screw and drove it home. Then, discarding the awl, he
  dropped in the other four screws, all of which ran in quite smoothly.</p>

  <p>"There, Mr. Pippet," said Thorndyke, "that establishes the identity of the
  coffin. The six holes in the brass plate coincide exactly with the six holes
  in the wood; for, as Polton points out, the screws, being blunt-ended, would
  not enter the wood if the holes were not precisely in the right place. So you
  can now take it as an established fact that this is really the coffin of your
  grandfather, Josiah Pippet. Does that satisfy you? Or is there anything else
  that you wish to have done?"</p>

  <p>Pippet looked at him in surprise. "Why!" he exclaimed, "we've only just
  begun! I thought we came here to find out exactly what is in that coffin.
  That is what I came for. I had made up my mind before I came to England that
  the first thing that I would do would be to find out whether Josiah was or
  was not in that coffin. Then I should have known whether to haul off or go
  ahead."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke; "but are you sure that you still want to
  know?"</p>

  <p>I looked quickly at Thorndyke, and so did Mr. Pippet. The question was
  asked in the quietest and most matter-of-fact tone; and yet I had the feeling
  that it carried a significance beyond either the tone or the words. And this,
  I think, was noticed also by our American friend, for he paused a few moments
  with his eyes fixed on Thorndyke before he replied:</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter so much now, as I've dropped the claim. But, still, if
  it doesn't seem irreverent, I think I should like to have a look at Josiah. I
  hate to leave a job unfinished."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "it's your funeral in a literal as well as
  allegorical sense. You would like to have the coffin opened?"</p>

  <p>"I should, though I don't quite see how you are going to manage it. There
  don't seem to be any screws."</p>

  <p>"The screws are plugged," Thorndyke explained, "as they usually are in
  well-finished coffins. They are sunk in little pits and the pits are filled
  up with plugs of wood, which are planed off clean so as to show an
  uninterrupted surface. Possibly those plugs were the deciding factor in the
  question as to whether the old coffin should be opened and faked, or a new
  one made. You can see that it would be impossible to get those plugs out and
  replace them without leaving very visible traces."</p>

  <p>This statement was illustrated by Polton's proceedings. From the
  inexhaustible suit-case he produced a cabinet-maker's scraper, with which he
  set to work at the edge of the lid, scraping off the old surface, thereby
  bringing into view the little circular inlays which marked the position of
  the screws, of which there were eight. When they were all visible, he
  attacked them with a nose bit set in a brace, and quickly exposed the heads
  of the screws. But then came the tug of war. For the rust of eighty years
  seemed to have fixed the screws immovably; and by the time that he had
  managed, with the aid of a driver bit in his brace, to get them out, his
  crinkly countenance was streaming with perspiration.</p>

  <p>"All right this time," said Mr. Pippet, picking up one of the screws and
  inspecting its blunt end. "I guess I'll take these screws to keep as a
  memento. Ah! You were right, Doctor," he added, as Polton prised up the lid
  and lifted it clear. "It was the lead shell that made it so blamed
  ponderous."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Brodribb, casting a slightly apprehensive glance at the leaden
  inner coffin, announced, as he selected a cigar from his case,</p>

  <p>"If you are going to open the shell, Thorndyke, I think I will take a
  little stroll and survey the landscape. I haven't got a medical jurist's
  stomach."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled, unsympathetically, but, nevertheless, offered him a
  light; and as he moved away, exhaling fragrant clouds, Polton approached the
  coffin with a formidable hooked knife and a pair of tinman's shears.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see the whole of him, sir?" he asked, bestowing a crinkly
  smile on Mr. Pippet, "or do you think his head will be enough?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Polton," was the guarded reply, "perhaps his head will be
  enough&mdash;to begin with, anyway."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, Polton, with a few gentle taps of a hammer, drove the point of
  the knife through the soft lead and began to cut a line in a U shape round
  the head end of the shell. When he had extended it sufficiently, he prised up
  the end of the tongue-shaped piece enclosed by the incision and turned it
  back like a flap. We stood aside respectfully to allow Mr. Pippet to be the
  first to look upon the long-forgotten face of his ancestor; and he
  accordingly advanced and bent down over the dark opening. For an appreciable
  time he remained looking silently into the cavity, apparently overcome by the
  emotions natural to the occasion. But I must confess that I was somewhat
  startled when he gave expression to those emotions. For what he
  said&mdash;and he said it slowly and with the strongest
  emphasis&mdash;was:</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm&mdash;damned!"</p>

  <p>Now, when a gentleman so scrupulously correct in speech as was Mr. Pippet,
  makes use of such an expression, it is reasonable to assume that something
  unusual has occurred. As he withdrew his head from the opening, mine and
  Thorndyke's met over it (and I am afraid mine was the harder). But in spite
  of the collision, I saw enough in a single glance to account for Mr. Pip
  pet's exclamation. For what met that glance was no shrivelled, mummified
  human face, but the end of a slender roll of canvas embedded in
  time-discoloured sawdust.</p>

  <p>"Now," commented Miller, when he had made his inspection, "isn't that just
  like a blinking crook! They are all fools, no matter how artful they may be.
  And they can't imagine the possibility of anyone else being honest. Of
  course, Gimbler thought that the coffin story was all bunkum, so he pitched
  the old coffin away without troubling to open it and see what was really in
  it. If he had only left it alone, Mr. Pippet's claim would have been as good
  as established."</p>

  <p>"It would certainly have been important evidence," said I. "But, for that
  matter, it is still. The story of the bogus funeral is now proved beyond any
  possible doubt to be true. And, though the claim has lapsed for the moment,
  it lapsed only on a technical point. What do you say, Brodribb?" I asked as
  that gentleman, in the course of his perambulations, passed the vault at a
  respectful distance.</p>

  <p>"What do I say to what?" he demanded, reasonably enough.</p>

  <p>"We have opened the shell and we find that it does not contain a
  body."</p>

  <p>"What does it contain?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Something wrapped in canvas and packed in sawdust," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That is not a very complete account," he objected, approaching cautiously
  to take a peep into the interior of the shell. "It certainly does not look
  like a body," he admitted after a very brief inspection, "but it might be. A
  very small one."</p>

  <p>"It would be a very small one, indeed," said Thorndyke. "But I agree with
  you Brodribb. We ought to ascertain exactly what the contents of the coffin
  are."</p>

  <p>On this, Polton re-inserted the hooked knife and prolonged the incision on
  one side to the foot of the shell and carried it across. Then he raised the
  long flap and turned it back, exposing the whole of the mass of sawdust and
  the long roll of canvas which was embedded in it. The latter, being lifted
  out and laid on the coffin-lid, was seen to be secured with three strands of
  twine or spun-yarn. These Polton carefully untied&mdash;they were fastened
  with reef-knots&mdash;and, having thus released the canvas, unrolled it and
  displayed its contents; which consisted of a small roll of sheet lead, a
  portion of a battered rain head and a flattened section of leaden
  stack-pipe.</p>

  <p>"This is interesting," said Brodribb. "It corresponds with the description
  more closely than I should have expected."</p>

  <p>"And you notice, sir," Polton pointed out, "that the sheet lead is proper
  cast sheet, as the Doctor said it would be."</p>

  <p>"I take your word for it, Polton," said Brodribb. "And that is a further
  agreement; which, I may add&mdash;since we are all friends&mdash;is not
  without its evidential significance."</p>

  <p>"That is the point that we were discussing," said I. "The bearing of this
  discovery on Mr. Pippet's claim."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Dr. Jervis," Mr. Pippet interposed, "but there isn't
  any claim. My sister and I agreed some time ago to drop the claim if we got a
  chance. And Dr. Thorndyke gave us a very fair chance, and we are very much
  obliged to him."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that," said Brodribb, "because this discovery does
  really confuse the issues rather badly. On this new evidence it would be
  possible to start a long and complicated law-suit."</p>

  <p>"That," said Mr. Pippet, "is, I guess, what the Doctor meant when he asked
  me if I still wanted to know what was in the coffin. But a nod is as good as
  a wink to a blind horse; and I was that blind horse. I rather wish I had left
  that durned coffin alone and taken it for granted that Josiah was inside.
  Still, we have got the monopoly of the information. is there any reason why
  we should not keep it to ourselves? What do you say, Superintendent?"</p>

  <p>"The fact," replied Miller, "that there was no body in the coffin is of no
  importance to the prosecution, but I don't see how it can be burked. We shall
  have to produce the original coffin&mdash;or prove its existence. We needn't
  say that we have opened it; but the question might be asked in
  cross-examination, and we should have to answer it. But what is the objection
  to the fact being known? You have dropped the claim, and you don't intend to
  re-open it. Nobody will be any the worse."</p>

  <p>"But I am afraid somebody may be," Mr. Pippet rejoined. He reflected a few
  moments and then continued: "We are all friends, as Mr. Brodribb has
  remarked, so I needn't mind letting you see how the land lies&mdash;from my
  point of view. You see, I embarked on this claim under the impression that
  the estates were going begging. I knew nothing of any other claimant. But
  when my sister and I saw Mr. Giles and his mother, we were a little sorry
  that we had started the ball. However, we had started it, and, after all,
  there was my girl to consider. So we went on. But very soon it became evident
  that our two young people were uncommonly taken with each other; and then my
  sister and I were still more sorry, and we began to hope that our case might
  fall through. While matters were in suspense, however, Giles made no formal
  advances though there was no concealment of his feelings towards my girl. But
  in the evening of the day when the Doctor obligingly knocked the bottom right
  out of my case, and showed us who the genuine heir-presumptive was, Giles
  asked my daughter to marry him, and, naturally she said 'yes.'</p>

  <p>"And now you will see my point. Giles, with proper, manly pride, waited
  until he had something to offer besides his own very desirable person. He
  didn't want to come as a suitor with empty hands. When the prize was
  practically his, he asked Jenifer to share it with him. And I should have
  liked to leave it at that. And that was why I wanted that coffin opened. I
  had taken it as a cinch that Josiah was inside; and if he had been, that
  would have settled the question for good. Instead of which I have only
  confused the issues, as Mr. Brodribb says.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here. I want this affair kept dark if it possibly can be. I want
  Giles to feel that the title and estates that he asked Jenny to share with
  him are his own by right, and not by anyone's favour. But that would be all
  spoiled if he got to know about this damned lead. For then he might
  reasonably suspect that I had voluntarily surrendered this claim for his
  benefit when I could, if I had pleased, have carried it to a successful
  issue. Of course, I couldn't have done anything of the kind. But that is what
  he might think. And he mustn't. There must be no fly in his ointment; and I
  look to you all to keep it out."</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that we all listened with the greatest sympathy to
  Mr. Pippet's explanation, and we promised, so far as was possible, to
  suppress the fact that the coffin had been opened; which we were able to do
  with a clear conscience, since that fact was neither material nor even
  relevant to the charge of fraud against Gimbler.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Mr. Pippet, when he had thanked us, "you will say that I
  ought to have thought of all this before I asked to have the coffin opened,
  but I am not so long-sighted as the Doctor. If you would like to call me a
  fool I shan't contradict you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," laughed Thorndyke; "but I don't think I will avail myself of
  the permission. Still, I will remark that you allowed yourself to entertain a
  complete fallacy. You have spoken of my having knocked the bottom out of your
  case by my exposure of Gimbler's fraud. But that was not the position at all.
  The coffin which Gimbler produced as Josiah's coffin was not Josiah's coffin.
  Therefore it had no relevance to the issue. It proved nothing, one way or the
  other, as to the condition of the real coffin. The effect of my evidence was
  purely negative. It simply rebutted Gimbler's evidence and thus restored the
  <i>status quo ante.</i> The judge, if you remember, drew your attention to
  this fact when he reminded you that Josiah's coffin had not been examined,
  and that the bogus funeral had been neither proved nor disproved."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Pippet, "it has been proved now; and what I should like
  to know, just as a matter of curiosity, is what it really and truly means. Is
  it possible that the whole story was true, or was this just one of Josiah's
  little jokes?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you will never know now," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No," Pippet agreed. "Josiah has got us guessing. Of course, it doesn't
  matter now whether he was an earl or an inn-keeper, but if you have any
  opinion on the subject, I should like to hear it."</p>

  <p>"Mere speculative opinions," said Thorndyke, "formed in the absence of
  real evidence, are not of much value. I really have nothing that one could
  call an opinion. All I can say is that, though the balance of probabilities
  for and against the truth of the story is nearly even, there seems to be a
  slight preponderance against, since, added to the general improbability of
  the story, is the very striking coincidence of Nathaniel Pippet of <i>The
  Castle</i> at Winsborough. But I am afraid we shall have to return an open
  verdict."</p>

  <p>"And keep it to ourselves," added Pippet. "And now the practical question
  arises, what are we to do with this coffin?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest," said Thorndyke, "that Polton closes it up as neatly as
  possible and that we then put it, with Gimbler's masterpiece, in the vault to
  which it properly belongs. We may hope that it may not be necessary to
  disturb that vault again; in which case no one need ever know that the coffin
  has been opened."</p>

  <p>This suggestion being generally approved, was duly carried out. The two
  coffins were placed, side by side, on the shelf, and then Miller locked the
  door and dropped the key into his pocket. This done, the procession moved out
  of the burial ground; and the incident was formally closed when Miller
  slammed the outer gate and turned the key in the rusty lock.</p>

  <p>We went back in the same order as that in which we had come. Mr. Pippet
  and Brodribb travelled in the former's car, and the rest of us occupied the
  roomy police car, Polton, at his own request, occupying the seat next to the
  driver where he could observe the mechanical arrangements and the operator's
  methods.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-20"
     id="ch-20"></a>XX. &mdash; THORNDYKE RESOLVES A MYSTERY</h2>

  <p class="first">MODERN transport appliances have certain undeniable
  advantages, particularly to those who are principally concerned with rapidity
  of transit. But these advantages, like most of the gifts of "progress," have
  to be purchased by the sacrifice of certain other advantages. The
  Superintendent's car was, in respect of speed, incomparably superior to a
  horse carriage; but in the opportunity that it afforded for sustained
  conversation it compared very unfavourably with that obsolete type of
  vehicle. Thorndyke, however, not yet, perhaps, emancipated from the hansom
  cab habit, chose to disregard the inevitable interruption, and, as the car
  trundled smoothly westward, remarked to Miller:</p>

  <p>"The subject of coffins, with which our minds are at present occupied,
  suggests, by an obvious analogy, that of a head in a box. I promised, a
  little while ago, to pass on to you any facts that I might unearth respecting
  the history of that head. I have looked into the matter and I think I now
  have all the material facts; and I may say that the affair turns out to be,
  in effect, what I had, almost from the first, supposed it to be."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," said Miller, "that you supposed it to be anything. I
  thought you were quite uninterested in the incident."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "you were mistaken. I watched the developments
  with the keenest interest. At first, when the head was discovered in the
  cloak room, I naturally assumed, as everyone did, that it was a case of
  murder and mutilation. But when I read the account of the inquest I began to
  suspect strongly that it was something quite different, and when I saw that
  photograph that you were so kind as to send me, I had very little doubt of
  it. You remember that photograph, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do," I replied. "A most extraordinary and abnormal mug that
  fellow had. There seemed to me to be a suggestion of acromegaly."</p>

  <p>"A suggestion!" Thorndyke exclaimed. "It was a perfect type. That
  photograph might have been used as the frontispiece of a monograph of
  acromegaly. Its appearance, together with the physical and anatomical facts
  disclosed at the inquest, seemed to me quite distinctive. I came to the
  conclusion that this head was no relic of a crime, but simply a museum
  specimen which had gone astray."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Miller, gazing at Thorndyke in amazement. I did not
  share his surprise, but merely felt an urgent desire to kick myself. For the
  thing was so ridiculously obvious&mdash;as soon as it was stated. But that
  was always the way with Thorndyke. He had the uncanny gift of seeing all the
  obvious things that everyone else overlooked.</p>

  <p>"But," Miller continued, after a pause, "you might have given us the
  tip."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miller," Thorndyke protested, "I had no tip to give. It was
  merely an opinion, and it might have been a wrong opinion. However, as I
  said, I watched developments most attentively, for there were at least two
  possibilities which might be foreseen; one by no means unlikely, the other
  almost fantastically improbable. The first was that some person might be
  accused of a murder which had never been committed; the other was that some
  real murderer might take advantage of the extraordinary opportunity that the
  circumstances offered. Curiously enough, it was the wildly improbable
  possibility that was actually realized."</p>

  <p>"What was the opportunity that was offered?" Miller asked.</p>

  <p>"It was the opportunity to commit a murder with almost perfect security
  from detection; with a whole set of false clues ready made; with the
  equivalent in time of a nearly watertight alibi."</p>

  <p>"A murderer's chief difficulty," said Miller, "is usually in getting rid
  of the body. I don't see that the circumstances helped him in that."</p>

  <p>"They helped him to the extent that he had no need to get rid of the
  body," Thorndyke replied. "Why does a murderer have to conceal the body?
  Because if it is found it will be recognized as the body of a particular
  person. Then the relations of the murderer to that person will be examined,
  with possibly fatal results. But supposing that a murderer could render the
  body of his victim totally unrecognizable. Then it would be the body of an
  unknown person; and all the persons related to it would be equally unknown.
  If he could go a step further and not only render the body unrecognizable but
  give it a false identity, he would be absolutely Secure; for the body would
  now be related to a set of circumstances with which he had no connexion.</p>

  <p>"This is the kind of opportunity that was offered by the discovery of this
  head. Let us study the conditions in the light of what actually happened. On
  a certain day in August, Wicks deposited in the cloak room a human head. Now,
  obviously, since it was brought there by Wicks, it could not be Wicks's head.
  Equally obviously, it must have been the head of some person who had died
  while Wicks was still alive. Thus the death of that person was clearly dated
  in one direction; and since the head had been treated with preservatives, the
  date of death must have been some time anterior to that of its deposition in
  the cloak room. Again, obviously, there must be somewhere a headless body
  corresponding to this body-less head.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bassett evidently intended to murder Wicks, for, as we saw, the
  murder was clearly premeditated. See, then, what a perfect opportunity was
  presented to him. If he could contrive to murder Wicks, to strip and
  decapitate the body and deposit it in a place where it would probably remain
  undiscovered for some time; when it was discovered, it would, quite
  naturally, be assumed to be the body belonging to the embalmed head. In other
  words, it would be assumed to be the body of some person who could not
  possibly be Wicks, and who had been murdered at some time when he, Bassett,
  was on the high seas. No slightest breath of suspicion could possibly fall on
  Bassett.</p>

  <p>"But, as so constantly happens in the case of carefully planned crimes,
  one little point had been overlooked, or, rather, was unknown to the
  intending murderer. Strangely enough, it seems also to have been overlooked
  by everyone else, with the result that Bassett's scheme was within a
  hair's-breadth of working out exactly according to plan."</p>

  <p>"As he was at the bottom of the dene-hole," remarked Miller, "it didn't
  matter much to him whether it did or not."</p>

  <p>"Very true," Thorndyke agreed. "But we are considering the plan of the
  crime. Now, when I read the report of the finding of the headless body, I
  realized that the fantastic possibility that I had hardly ventured to
  entertain had actually come to pass."</p>

  <p>"You assumed that the headless body was a fake," said Miller, "and not the
  body belonging to the cloak room head. Now, I wonder why you assumed
  that."</p>

  <p>"I did not," replied Thorndyke. "There was no assumption. The excellent
  newspaper report made it perfectly clear that the body found by the Watling
  Street could not possibly be the body belonging to the embalmed head. That
  head, let me remind you, was the head of a person who suffered from
  acromegaly. The body of that person would have been distinguished by
  atrophied muscles and enormous, mis-shapen hands and feet. But our admirable
  reporter specially noted that the body was that of a muscular man with
  strong, well-shaped hands. Then he certainly was not suffering from
  acromegaly.</p>

  <p>"You see what followed from this. If this body did not belong to the cloak
  room head, it must belong to some other head. And that head was probably not
  far away. For, as no one suspected its existence, there was no need for any
  elaborate measures to hide it. As I happened to be aware of the existence of
  a number of dene-holes in the immediate neighbourhood, it occurred to me that
  one of them probably contained the head and the clothes. Accordingly, I
  examined the six-inch map of the district, on which the dene-holes are shown,
  and there I found that one of them was within four hundred yards of the place
  where the body was discovered. To that dene-hole I paid a visit after
  attending the inquest, having provided myself with a compass, a suitable lamp
  and a pair of night-glasses. I was not able to see very much, but I saw
  enough to justify our expedition. You know the rest of that story."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miller, "and a very interesting story it is. And now I
  should like to hear about these new facts that you have unearthed."</p>

  <p>"You shall have them all," said Thorndyke, "though it is only a case of
  filling in details. I have told you what I decided&mdash;correctly, as it
  turns out&mdash;as to the nature of the mysterious head; that it was simply a
  pathological specimen illustrating the rare disease known as acromegaly,
  which had got into the wrong hands.</p>

  <p>"Now, when one thinks of acromegaly, the name of Septimus Bernstein almost
  inevitably comes into one's mind. Dr. Bernstein is a world-famous authority
  on giantism, dwarfism, acromegaly and other affections and anomalies of
  growth connected with disorder of the pituitary body. He is an enthusiast in
  his subject and gives his whole time and energy to its study. But what was
  still more important to me was the fact that he has a private museum devoted
  to the illustration of these diseases and anomalies. I have seen that museum,
  and a very remarkable collection it is; but, when I visited it, although it
  contained several gigantic and acromegalous skulls, there was no specimen of
  a head in its complete state.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, then, I was disposed to suspect some connexion between this
  stray specimen and Dr. Bernstein. But this was pure hypothesis until I heard
  Bunter's statement. That brought my hypothesis concerning the head into the
  region of fact. For Bunter's description of the passenger on the yacht was a
  fairly exact description of Dr. Bernstein; and, on the strength of it I was
  in a position to take the necessary measures to clear the matter up.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly I called on Bernstein. I did not, in the first place, ask him
  any questions. I simply informed him that a preserved human head which he had
  imported, apparently from Holland, had been causing the police a good deal of
  trouble, and that it was for him to give a full and candid explanation of all
  the circumstances connected with it. The alternative was for the police to
  charge him with being in unlawful possession of certain human remains.</p>

  <p>"My statement seemed to give him a severe shock&mdash;he is a nervous and
  rather timid man&mdash;but, though greatly alarmed, he seemed, in a way,
  relieved to have an opportunity to explain matters. Evidently, the affair had
  kept him in a state of constant apprehension and expectation of some new and
  horrible development, and he consented almost eagerly to make a full
  statement as to what had really happened. This is what his story amounts
  to:</p>

  <p>"He had for years been trying to get possession of the head of some person
  who had suffered from acromegaly; partly for the purpose of studying the
  pituitary body more thoroughly and partly for the enrichment of his museum
  with a specimen which completely illustrated the effects of the disease. What
  he especially wanted to do was to remove the pituitary body without injuring
  the head and mount it in a specimen jar to accompany the jar containing the
  head, so that the abnormal condition of the pituitary and its effects on the
  structure of the face could be studied together."</p>

  <p>"By the way," Miller asked, "what is the pituitary body?"</p>

  <p>"It is a small body," Thorndyke explained, "situated at the base of the
  brain and lodged in a cavity in the base of the skull. Its interest&mdash;for
  our present purpose&mdash;lies in the fact that it is one of the so-called
  ductless glands and produces certain internal secretions which contain
  substances called hormones which are absorbed into the blood and seem to
  control the processes of growth. If the pituitary&mdash;or, at least, its
  anterior part&mdash;becomes overgrown, it appears that it produces an excess
  of secretion, with the result that either the whole body becomes overgrown
  and the sufferer develops into a giant, or certain parts only of the body,
  particularly the face and the extremities, become gigantic while the rest of
  the body remains of its normal size. That is a very rough account of it, just
  enough to make the matter intelligible."</p>

  <p>"I think I have taken in the idea," said Miller, "and I'm glad you
  explained it. Now, I am able to feel a bit more sympathetic towards Dr.
  Bernstein. He isn't such an unmitigated cannibal as I thought he was. But let
  us hear the rest of the story."</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke resumed, "a short time ago, Bernstein heard from a Dutch
  doctor of a set of specimens, the very description of which made his mouth
  water. It appeared that an unclaimed body had been delivered for dissection
  at a medical school in a certain town in Holland. Bernstein asked to be
  excused from giving the name of the town, and I did not press him. But, of
  course, if it is essential, he is prepared to disclose the further
  particulars. On examining this body, it was found to present the typical
  characters of acromegaly; whereupon the pathologist decided to annex the head
  and extremities for the hospital museum and return the remainder in the
  coffin. At the time when the information reached Bernstein, the specimens had
  not been put in the museum but were in the curator's laboratory in course of
  preparation.</p>

  <p>"Thereupon, Bernstein started off, hot-foot, to see if he could persuade
  the pathologist to let him have the head. And his mission was obviously
  successful. What methods of persuasion he used, and what was the nature of
  the deal, he preferred not to say; and I did not insist, as it is no
  particular concern of ours. It would seem as if it must have been slightly
  irregular. However, he obtained the head, and, having got it, embarked on the
  series of foolish proceedings about which Bunter told us. A bolder and more
  self-confident man would probably have had no serious difficulty. He would
  have travelled by an ordinary passenger ship and simply declared the head at
  the Customs as a pathological specimen. The Customs people might have
  communicated with the police, and there might have been some inquiries. But
  if there had been no secrecy there would have been no trouble."</p>

  <p>"No," Miller agreed. "Secrecy was the stupidest thing possible under the
  circumstances, Why the deuce didn't he notify us, when the thing was found in
  the cloak room? It would have saved us a world of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Of course that is what he ought to have done," said Thorndyke; "but the
  discovery took him unawares, and, when he suddenly found himself involved in
  a murder mystery, he got in a panic and made things worse by trying to keep
  out of sight. He is in a mighty twitter now, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"I expect he is," said Miller; "and the question is, what is to be done?
  It's a queer case, in a legal sense. Have you any suggestion to make?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "I think you should first consider what the legal
  position really is. You will admit that no crime has been committed."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," Miller agreed; "at any rate, not in British
  jurisdiction."</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," pursued Thorndyke, "it is not clear to me that any offence
  against the law has been committed. Admittedly, Bernstein evaded the Customs;
  but, as a human head is not a customable commodity, there was no offence
  against the Revenue. And so with the rest of his proceedings; they were very
  improper, but they do not appear to amount to any definite legal
  offence."</p>

  <p>"So I take it," said Miller, "that you think we might as well let the
  matter drop. I don't quite like that, after all the fuss and outcry there has
  been."</p>

  <p>"I was hardly suggesting that," said Thorndyke. "I certainly think that,
  for the credit of the Force, the mystery ought to be cleared up in a more or
  less public manner. But, since you invite me to make a suggestion, I will
  make one. Perhaps it may surprise you a little. But what I think would be the
  best way to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion would be for you to
  disinter the specimen&mdash;which I believe was buried temporarily, in the
  case in which it was found, in the Tower Hamlets Cemetery&mdash;have it
  examined and reported on by some authorized persons, verify Bernstein's
  statements so far as may be necessary, and, if you find everything correct,
  hand the specimen back to Bernstein."</p>

  <p>"My eye!" exclaimed Miller, "that's a pretty large order! But how could
  we? The head is no lawfully his property. No one is entitled to the
  possession of human remains."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I can agree to that," Thorndyke dissented; "not, at
  any rate, without certain reservations. The legal status of anatomical and
  pathological specimens in museums is rather obscure; and perhaps it has been
  wisely kept obscure. It is not covered by the Anatomy Act, which merely
  legalizes the temporary possession of a human body for the purpose of
  dissection. As you say, no one can establish a title to the possession of a
  human body, or part of one, as an ordinary chattel. But you know as well as I
  do, Miller, that sensible people turn a blind eye to this question on
  suitable occasions. Take the case of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal
  College of Surgeons. There, the anatomical and pathological collections are
  filled with human remains, all of which must have been acquired by methods
  which are not strictly legal. There are even the remains of entire
  individuals, some of whom are actually known by name. Now, if they were
  challenged, what title to the possession of those remains could the Council
  of the College establish? In practice, they are not challenged. Reasonable
  people tacitly assume a title.</p>

  <p>"And that is what you would do, yourself. Supposing that someone was to
  steal the skeleton of the late Corporal Byrne, or O'Brian, the Irish Giant,
  which is in that museum, and supposing you were able to recover it; what
  would you do? Why, of course, you would hand it back to the museum, title or
  no title."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller admitted, "that is so. But Bernstein's case is not quite the
  same. His is a private museum, and he wants this head as a personal
  chattel."</p>

  <p>"The principle is the same," Thorndyke rejoined. "Bernstein is a proper
  person to possess this head; he wants it for a legitimate purpose&mdash;for
  the advancement of medical knowledge, which is for the benefit of all. I
  insist, Miller, that, as a matter of public policy, this specimen ought to be
  given back to Bernstein."</p>

  <p>Miller looked at me with an undissembled grin. "The Doctor can be mighty
  persuasive on occasion," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Still," I urged, "it is a perfectly reasonable proposition. You are
  concerned, primarily, with crime, but ultimately with the public welfare.
  Now, there hasn't been any crime, or any criminal intent; and it is against
  the public welfare to put obstacles in the way of legitimate and useful
  medical research."</p>

  <p>"Well," Miller rejoined, "the decision doesn't rest with me. I must see
  what the Commissioner has to say. I will give him the facts, and you can
  depend on me to tell him what you say and to put your case as strongly as I
  can. He is not out to make unnecessary trouble any more than I am. So we must
  leave it at that. I will let you know what he says. If he falls in with your
  view, he will probably want your assistance in fixing up the details of the
  examination and the inspection of the specimen. You may as well give me
  Bernstein's address."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke wrote the name and address down on one of his own cards and
  handed it to the Superintendent. And this brought the business to an end. The
  latter part of the conversation had been carried on in the stationary car,
  which had been drawn up in King's Bench Walk opposite our chambers. We now
  shook hands with Miller and got out; and, as the car turned away towards
  Crown Office Row, we entered the wide doorway and ascended the stairs to our
  own domain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-21"
     id="ch-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; JERVIS COMPLETES THE STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE time has come for us to gather up the threads of this
  somewhat discursive history. They are but ends, and short ones at that; for,
  in effect, my tale is told. But even as the weaver's work is judged by the
  quality of the selvedge, so the historian's is apt to be judged by its
  freedom from loose ends and uncompleted episodes.</p>

  <p>But since the mere bald narration of the few outstanding incidents would
  be but a dull affair, I shall venture (on the principle that the greater
  includes the less) to present an account of them all under cover of that
  which most definitely marked the completion of our labours; the establishment
  of the young Earl and his Countess in firm possession of the ancestral
  domain. For, however thrilling may have been the alarums and excursions that
  befell by the way, they were but by-products and side issues of the
  Winsborough Peerage Case. With the settlement of that case we could fairly
  say that our work was done; and, if disposed to tags or aphorisms, could take
  our choice between <i>Nunc dimittis</i> and <i>Finis coronat opus.</i></p>

  <p>It was a brilliant morning in that most joyous season of the year when
  late spring is merging into early summer; and the place was the spot upon the
  earth's surface where that season develops its most perfect
  loveliness&mdash;the south-east corner of Kent; or, to be more precise, the
  great lawn at the rear of the unpretentious mansion "known as and being"
  Winsborough Castle. Thither Thorndyke and my wife and I, together with
  Brodribb (who came also in his official capacity) had been invited to the
  house-warming on the return of the young Earl and Countess from their
  prolonged honeymoon. But we had not come as mere visitors, or even friends.
  The warm-hearted Jenifer had formally adopted us as members of the family,
  and as no one could ask for more delightful relatives, we had accepted the
  position gratefully.</p>

  <p>As we strolled together across the sun-lit lawn, I glanced from time to
  time at the young couple with that sober pleasure which a middle-aged man
  feels in contemplating the too-rare spectacle of a pair of entirely
  satisfactory human beings. They were both far beyond the average in good
  looks; of splendid physique, gay and sprightly in temperament and gifted with
  the faultless manners that spring from natural kindliness and generosity
  coupled with quick intelligence. Looking at them, one could not but reflect
  pensively on the might-have-been; and think what a pleasant place the world
  would be if it could be peopled with their like.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Jenny, "what has become of Pap and Uncle John." ("Uncle
  John" was Thorndyke)</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Giles, "because I know, I saw them sneaking off together
  towards the churchyard. My impression is that they are trying to make a
  complete and exhaustive collection of ancestral Pippets."</p>

  <p>Jenny laughed delightedly. "Inquisitive old things!" she exclaimed. "But I
  don't see why they need fuss themselves. There are no particular points about
  the ancestral Pippets. They never did anything worth speaking of excepting
  that they sold good beer&mdash;and, incidentally, they produced me."</p>

  <p>"Not incidentally," Giles objected. "It was their crowning achievement.
  And I don't know what more you would have. I call it a deuced good
  effort."</p>

  <p>The girl glanced at me with sparkling eyes. "Conceited young feller, isn't
  he, Uncle Kit? He will persist in thinking that his goose is a swan."</p>

  <p>"He knows that she is," retorted Giles. "But, I say, Jenny. You'll have to
  keep an eye on Dad. What do you think he has done?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in mock alarm. "Break it gently," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"To my certain knowledge," said Giles, "he has taken over the lease of the
  <i>Earl of Beaconsfield</i> and he is having the sign changed back to <i>The
  Castle Arms.</i> What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"My prophetic soul!" she exclaimed. "I see it all. He's going to have 'by
  C. Pippet' written underneath the sign. If we don't mind our eyes, we shall
  have him behind the bar before we can say 'knife.' 'What's bred in the bone,'
  you know."</p>

  <p>Giles laughed in his delightful school-boy fashion.</p>

  <p>"My word, yes!" he agreed. "We shall have to take a strong hand. We are
  not going to spend our lives under the Upas shadow of the <i>Fox &amp;
  Grapes.</i> But I must hook off. Mr. Brodribb has got the bailiff chappie
  here&mdash;Mr. Solly&mdash;and they are going to rub my nose on all the
  things that they say a land-owner ought to understand. Brodribb insists that
  there is no eye like the master's eye, and I expect he is right, though I
  fancy I know an eye that is better still; to wit, the eye that adorns the
  countenance of the master's Pa-in-law. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I," replied Jenny, "am going to extract a statement from Uncle Kit on the
  subject of the various happenings since we had Mr. Brodribb's summary. I want
  to know how it all ended."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Giles; "and when you have wormed all the facts out of him,
  you can pass them on to me. Now I'm off."</p>

  <p>With a flourish of his hat and a mock-ceremonial bow, he turned and strode
  away across the turf towards the old brick porch, the very type and
  embodiment of healthy, virile youth. Jenny followed him with her eyes until
  he disappeared into the porch; then she opened her cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"Now, Uncle K., you've got to tell me all you know about everything."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that seems to offer some scope for conversation. Would
  you like to begin anywhere in particular?"</p>

  <p>"I want, first of all, to know just exactly what has happened to poor Mr.
  Gimbler."</p>

  <p>"Poor Mr. Gimbler!" I exclaimed. "You needn't waste your sympathy on a
  rascal like that."</p>

  <p>"I know," said she. "Of course he is a rascal. But he did manage things so
  bee-yutifully."</p>

  <p>Her tone jarred upon me slightly, and I think she must have observed
  something in my expression, for she continued:</p>

  <p>"You think I am taking a purely selfish view of the case, and I must admit
  that, as events have turned out, I am the greatest gainer by what Giles calls
  'Mr. Gimbler's gimblings.' But I assure you, Uncle Kit, that Mr. Gimbler did
  the very best for us all. Pap loves him. He says he is going to give him a
  pension when he comes out of chokee&mdash;if that is where he is, I suppose
  it is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "Chokee is his present address,"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid it <i>was,"</i> said she. "The benefactor of humanity is
  languishing in a dungeon, and you don't care a hoot. You seem even to feel a
  callous satisfaction in his misfortunes. But see here, now, Uncle K., I want
  you to understand the benefits that he has showered on us. And, first of all,
  you've got to understand my father's position. You have got to realize that
  he never wanted the earldom at all. Pap is a thorough-bred American. He had
  no use for titles of nobility; and he was very clear that he didn't want to
  stand in the way of anyone else who had.</p>

  <p>"But Auntie Arminella and I didn't take that view at all. We were as keen
  as mustard on an English title and a beautiful English estate, and Auntie
  started to stir my father up. He didn't take much stirring up. As soon as he
  realized that I wanted 'this toy,' as he called it, and had ascertained, as
  he thought, that the title and estates were lying derelict and unclaimed, he
  decided to go for them all out. And when Pap makes a decision, he usually
  gets a move on, right away.</p>

  <p>"Now, the first shock that he got was when he discovered that there was
  another claimant. Then he met Giles and his mother, and he fell in love with
  them both at first sight, as Auntie and I did. He didn't know how poor Giles
  was&mdash;he was actually working in a stockbroker's office, if you will
  believe me&mdash;but he realized that the decision of the court meant a lot
  more to Giles than it did to him, and he would have liked to back out of the
  claim."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He couldn't. When once the claim had been raised, it had got to be
  settled. Giles didn't want the earldom as a gift, and Mr. Brodribb wouldn't
  have let the case drop, with the chance of its being re-opened in the future.
  So it had to go on. And now see what Mr. Gimbler did for us. Supposing he
  hadn't changed the coffins; and supposing the real one had been found to be
  stuffed with lead. It might have been. That would have gone a long way
  towards establishing my father's claim. Supposing the decision had gone in
  his favour. Then he would have been the Earl of Winsborough. And he would
  have hated it. Supposing I had married Giles&mdash;and I guess I should have
  had to ask him, myself, as he was a poor man and as proud as
  Lucifer&mdash;what would Pap's position have been? He would have defeated his
  own plans. He would have got the title for himself, and he would have kept
  his daughter and her husband out of it during his lifetime. But now, thanks
  to Mr. Gimbler, we have all got what we wanted. Pap has escaped the title,
  and he has the satisfaction of seeing his girl Countess of Winsborough."</p>

  <p>I smiled at her quaint and somewhat wrong-headed Way of looking at the
  case. But I refrained from pointing out that "Mr. Gimbler's gimblings" might
  easily have produced the undesired results but for Thorndyke's intervention.
  It was a dangerous topic, with my secret knowledge of what was in the real
  coffin, So I held my peace; or rather, led the conversation away from
  possible shoals and quicksands.</p>

  <p>"By the way," I said, "if Giles had no money, who was going to pay his
  costs if he had lost the case?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she replied. "We suspect dear old Brodribb. He told Giles
  and his mother that 'there were funds available,' but he wouldn't say what
  they were. Of course, it is all right now. But you haven't told me what
  happened to Mr. Gimbler."</p>

  <p>"You will be relieved to hear that he was let off quite lightly. Three
  years. It might easily have been seven, or even fourteen. Probably it would
  have been if we had included the forgery in the charges against him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it really was a forgery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was undoubtedly. For your father's satisfaction, we tested it
  chemically&mdash;but not until after the conviction. The ink was a modern
  synthetic drawing-ink. But it was a wonderfully skilful forgery."</p>

  <p>"Pity," Jenny commented. "He is a really clever and ingenious man. Why
  couldn't he have run straight? But now tell me about the other people. There
  was an undertaker man, who made the coffin. What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"Joseph Wallis was his name. He also had better luck than he deserved, for
  he got only three months. It was originally proposed to charge him and
  Gimbler together with conspiracy. But there is this awkward peculiarity about
  an indictment for conspiracy in which only two persons are involved; if one
  of them is acquitted, the other is acquitted automatically. For a conspiracy
  is like a quarrel; it can't be a single-handed job. A man can't conspire with
  himself. So if, of two alleged conspirators, one is found innocent, it
  follows that there was no conspiracy, and the other man must be innocent,
  too.</p>

  <p>"Now, Joseph pleaded that he had no knowledge of the purpose for which the
  coffin was required; thought it was a practical joke or a wager. And this
  plea was supported by Gimbler, who, in a statement to the police, declared
  that he never told Joseph what the coffin was really wanted for. Which seems
  likely enough. So the conspiracy charge against Joseph was dropped; and, of
  course, it had also to be dropped in respect to Gimbler."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," said Jenny, "that The Slithy Tove, as Giles calls him, was
  man enough to clear his confederate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is something in his favour; though we must bear in mind that the
  Tove was a criminal lawyer&mdash;in more senses than one&mdash;and knew all
  about the law of conspiracy. Is there anything else that you want to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"There was a man named Bunter; but I don't think he was much concern of
  ours, was he?"</p>

  <p>"He was an invaluable link in the chain of evidence," I replied, "though
  he seems rather outside the picture. However, I can report favourably on his
  case, for he got off altogether. Nobody wanted his blood. The police accepted
  his explanation of his attempt to break into the yacht, <i>Cormorant,</i>
  for, though it was probably untrue, it was quite plausible. There remained
  only his complicity in the platinum robbery. But that had been committed
  outside British jurisdiction; and, as the platinum had been recovered and
  restored to its lawful owners, and as the principal robbers were dead, no one
  was inclined to move in the matter. Accordingly, Mr. Frederick Bunter was
  released and went on his way rejoicing, with only one or two slight stains on
  his otherwise spotless character. And I think that completes the list, unless
  you can think of anything more."</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, "I think that finishes up the history of the
  Winsborough Peerage Case. A queer story it is, looking back on it, with its
  ups and downs, its hopes and anxieties, to say nothing of one or two ugly
  passages."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "there have been some anxious moments. But all's well
  that ends well."</p>

  <p>"Very true," said she. "And it has ended very well indeed; for me and for
  Giles, for our parents and for Arminella. We have all got what we wanted
  most, we are all happy and contented, and we are all tremendously pleased
  with one another. It couldn't have ended better. And to think that we owe it
  all to poor Mr. Gimbler!"</p>

  <p>I smiled, but I didn't contradict her. It was a harmless delusion. Perhaps
  it was not a delusion at all. At any rate, one might fairly say of Mr.
  Horatio Gimbler that he builded better than he knew.</p>
