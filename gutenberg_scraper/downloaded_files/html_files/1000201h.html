  <h2><a name="story01"
     id="story01">I. &mdash; THE FEARFUL WORD</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Nov
  1922</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;LOOK after the chickens,&rdquo; said Hamilton
  sardonically, &ldquo;put the cat out, and don&rsquo;t forget to wind up the
  clock,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts inclined his head with, as he believed, a certain
  quiet dignity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And take something for that stiff neck of yours,&rdquo; added
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders came back from the deck of the <i>Zaire</i> to
  the little concrete quay that jutted out from the residency grounds.</p>

  <p>He was leaving on a short tour of inspection, and with him went Captain
  Hamilton and half a company of Houssas. Mr. Tibbetts, whose more familiar
  name was Bones, was staying behind in charge, and would be for seven days
  Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Commander of the troops, Deputy
  Paymaster-General, and Chief of Staff. He was also temporarily in control of
  twenty-five Orpington hens, three cockerels and a new fowl-house, the
  property of his superior officer. The cat and the clock were figments of
  Captain Hamilton&rsquo;s imagination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And by the way&rdquo;&mdash;Hamilton, one foot on the deck of the
  little steamer and one on the quay, turned&mdash;&ldquo;cut out the fairy
  tales, Bones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Tibbetts raised his eyebrows patiently and looked resigned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you have to entertain callers, tell &rsquo;em something useful
  such as: A squared plus B squared equals C squared&mdash;a little algebra
  would improve the moral status of the wandering Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once before, whilst Bones had been in charge of the station, there had
  come a canoe from the Isisi country, carrying a small chief with a grievance
  to lay before the Commissioner. And Bones, being unable to settle their
  problem, had improved the shining hour by giving them a rough-and-ready
  translation from Grimm. It was not a happy experiment, for when the little
  chief had gone back to his village he had practised the new magic, with
  disastrous results, for, failing to turn his nagging wife into a tree, he
  had, in his annoyance, beaten her so severely that she had died.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, the magic was as the lord Tibbetts told me, for I sprinkled
  her with water and said &lsquo;Be thou a tree,&rsquo; but because the woman
  has an evil mind she would not obey the lord&rsquo;s magic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones sniffed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sarcasm, my dear old commander, is wasted on me. I shall simply
  shut myself up with my jolly old studies and refuse to see anybody. As to
  your indecent old cocks and hens, I refuse absolutely to have anything to do
  with &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s nothing in King&rsquo;s Regulations about
  looking after chickens&mdash;I hate to remind you, but you really ought to
  know, dear old officer, that it&rsquo;s not my duty to give them their milk
  or whatever nourishment the unfortunate animals want...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bones,&rdquo; called Sanders from the bridge. &ldquo;O
  boy, let go the big rope!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The hawser splashed into the water, and her stern wheel moving briskly,
  the <i>Zaire</i> slipped to midstream and set her nose to the tawny
  current.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Teach &rsquo;em the new two-step!&rdquo; shouted Hamilton
  derisively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Teach your own chickens!&rdquo; screeched Bones.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts had three day-dreams. In point of fact, he had near
  three hundred, but there were three favourites. The first of these had to do
  with the rescue of beautiful females from various dangers. Bones possessed
  (in his dream) a dark girl with big, luminous eyes and slim, svelte figure.
  And a fair girl with a complexion like milk and a figure that was not so
  slim; and a dashing and rather a fastish kind of girl, who got into scrapes
  against his earnest advice, defied him and went her own wilful way, leaving a
  stern young lover behind whose grief and anguish none would guess from a
  glance at his pale, set face. And when he rescued her, she used either to
  fall weeping into his arms, or fall weeping to her knees, or fall prostrate
  at his feet. She invariably fell one way or another, and was forgiven, or
  wasn&rsquo;t forgiven, according to the mood in which Bones happened to
  be.</p>

  <p>His second dream was of digging up enormous sums of money and buying a
  wonderful yacht, which would be manned by silent, saturnine and mysterious
  men. He would sail to unknown seas and reappear unexpectedly at Cowes. It
  wasn&rsquo;t always at Cowes&mdash;but was invariably before a large,
  fashionable and appreciative audience. And beautiful girls would see the
  yacht come sailing majestically to its anchorage, and would say to one
  another or anybody who happened to be round:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the <i>The Yellow Vampire</i> returned from one of its
  strange voyages. Look! That is Captain Tibbetts, the millionaire, on the
  bridge. They say he hates women. How I should like to know him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had a third, and this was the dearest of all. It involved the discovery
  by the higher authorities of his extraordinary powers of organisation, his
  amazing knowledge of criminology, and the fear that his name inspired in the
  breasts of evildoers. Delicate and refined young women riding in the park
  would turn and gaze after his sombre figure and glance significantly at one
  another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is Commissioner Tibbetts of the C.I.D. Never a day passes but
  his ruthless hand drags a murderer to the gallows. How black and sinister his
  life must be! I wish I could get an introduction to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones had made many incursions into the realms of crime investigation.
  They had not been very successful. He had read books on criminology, and had
  studied learned text-books in which scientific men with foreign names
  tabulated the size of criminals&rsquo; ears and drew remarkable conclusions
  from the shapes of their noses. This branch of the study became unpopular
  when he found, in the shape of Captain Hamilton&rsquo;s eyebrow, proof
  positive of homicidal tendencies.</p>

  <p>Bones lay stretched in the shade of a little matted verandah before his
  hut It was a roasting hot day, with not so much as a breeze from the sea to
  temper the furnace-like atmosphere of headquarters.</p>

  <p>Bones was not asleep. It was equally true that he was not awake. He was
  arresting a man whose crimes had baffled the police of the world until,
  misguidedly, he came into the orbit of that lynx-eyed sleuth,
  &ldquo;Trailer&rdquo; Tibbetts of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the patter of bare feet, and Bones blinked and was awake. It was
  a lanky, barefooted corporal of Houssas, and he brought his hand stiffly to
  his scarlet tarbosh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a canoe from the upper country. I have told the men that
  they must wait until you have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Bones huskily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this nonsense?
  Arrest the man and bring him before me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He might have been reciting the <i>Iliad</i> for all the corporal
  understood, for he was speaking in English.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring them,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;And, Mahmet, have you
  given food to the cluck-cluck?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, you said that you yourself would carry food to the
  cluck-cluck Water I gave them because they made fearful noises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones screwed in his eyeglass and glared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring the men: then take food to the birds which are as the apple
  of Militini&rsquo;s eye, being his own aunts turned by
  enchantment&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, remembering Hamilton&rsquo;s warning.
  Bones loved fairy stories.</p>

  <p>So there came to him M&rsquo;gula of the Upper Ochori, an old man of
  forty, with a big head and a wrinkled face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, Tibbetti&rdquo; he boomed, as he squatted in the hot
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, man,&rdquo; said Bones. &ldquo;Now, tell me why you have
  come in your big canoe. Sandi is not with me, having gone to the Isisi
  country, but I sit in his place and give justice.&rdquo; This Bones
  magnificently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I have heard of you and your wise words. From the
  river-with-one-bank to the mountains of the old king, people speak of you
  clapping their hands. It is said that you are greater than Sandi, being a
  magician. For you take things in your hand and they disappear. Also from the
  air you take silver dollars. Also it is said that from an empty pot you have
  drawn beautiful things, such as birds and pieces of cloth and small
  animals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones coughed a little self-consciously. He had once performed a few
  conjuring tricks before an awestricken audience. Happily Hamilton knew
  nothing of this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, lord, I came, knowing that the lord Sandi was going to the
  Isisi, because I have many thoughts that trouble my mind.&rdquo; In a country
  where men have been known to travel a thousand miles to seek the answer to a
  riddle, it was not remarkable that one should make the long journey from the
  Ochori to find relief even from a trivial worry, and Bones waited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I am a man who has lived many years thinking greatly, but
  doing little-little. My own brother is chief of K&rsquo;mana and has a medal
  about his neck, and men say &lsquo;kwas&rsquo; to his judgments. Now I, who
  am greater than he because of my thoughts, am only a common man. Tell me,
  Tibbetti, must all men be as they were born?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones began to take an interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, what is your name?&rdquo; And when his visitor had told him:
  &ldquo;M&rsquo;gula, many men have been born common, but have come to
  greatness. That is well known.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Warming to his subject, and conscious of the improving character of his
  lecture, Bones became very voluble. He cited the story of a certain young
  Corsican officer of artillery who had reached for a throne; he told of a
  poverty-stricken boy in a rolling-mill ("a wonder of iron&rdquo; he called
  him) who had acquired riches; he ransacked and misquoted history to preach
  the doctrine of opportunism, and M&rsquo;gula of the Upper Ochori sat
  motionless, entranced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I see that you are wiser than M&rsquo;Shimba, and greater than
  ghosts,&rdquo; he said, when Bones had talked himself out. &ldquo;And I have
  a warm feeling in my stomach because I know that men become great from their
  thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He came again the next morning, and Bones, who in the meantime had raked
  up a few more historical instances, continued his discourse on Self-Help.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The leopard comes once to the net&rdquo; (thus he paraphrased the
  proverb of opportunity knocking at the door), &ldquo;and if the net is fast,
  behold, he is your meat! But if the net is old and the pit is shallow, he
  goes and comes no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;gula went back to the Ochori country an enlightened man.</p>

  <p>A month after his return, his brother, the chief, was seized with a
  passionate desire to stand up before the people of his village and recite the
  poem called &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa.&rdquo; It is a poem by all standards, native
  or white, for it deals with death in a picturesque and imaginative way. There
  was not a man or a man-child from one end of the territory to the other who
  could not recite &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa&rdquo; had he been so terribly defiant of
  devils and ju-jus. But it is the law that &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa&rdquo; must be
  taught in whispers and in secret places from whence all birds have been
  frightened, for birds are notoriously members of the spirit world that carry
  news and chatter in their strange ways about the souls of men.</p>

  <p>In a whisper must the poem be taught; in a whisper recited, and then the
  last word, which is &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa,&rdquo; must never be uttered. No man
  has ever explained what &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa&rdquo; means. It is enough that it
  is so fearful a word that it sets men shivering even to think of it.</p>

  <p>It is recorded that for a hundred years no man, sane or mad, had spoken
  &ldquo;M&rsquo;sa,&rdquo; so that when Busubu, the little chief of the
  Ochori, stood up by the village fire and, with some dramatic ability, recited
  the great poem in a tremendous voice, his people first sat frozen with horror
  at the sacrilege and its terrible significance, then broke and fled to their
  huts, hands to ears. In the night, when Busubu was sleeping, his two sons and
  his brother came to his hut and wakened him softly.</p>

  <p>He rose and went with them into the forest, and they walked all night
  until they came to a big swamp where crocodiles laid their eggs. The waters
  of the pool rippled arid swirled continuously in the grey light of dawn.</p>

  <p>They rested by the side of a small lake, and the brother spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Busubu, you have brought upon the people the terrible Ghost who
  shall make us all slaves. This we know because our father told us. This ghost
  is chained by the leg at the bottom of this swamp, waiting for the words of
  &lsquo;M&rsquo;sa&rsquo; to reach him, when he shall be free. Now, I think,
  Busubu, you must speak to this spirit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man and brother,&rdquo; whimpered Busubu the chief, &ldquo;I
  would not have said the terrible words if you had not told me that it was the
  order of Sandi that I should do this. For did you not come secretly to my hut
  and say that Sandi had killed the ghost and that all men might say
  &lsquo;M&rsquo;sa&rsquo; without fear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are mad and a liar,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;gula calmly. &ldquo;Let
  us finish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And because they would not have his blood on their hands, they roped him
  to a tree near by where the ripples ran most frequently, and they put out his
  eyes and left him, They rested awhile within earshot of the place, and when,
  in the afternoon, they heard certain sounds of pain, they knew that their
  work was consummated and went back to the village.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Sons of Busubu,&rdquo; said the uncle of the young men,
  &ldquo;if this matter goes to the ear of Sandi, he will come with his
  soldiers and we shall hang. Tomorrow let us call a full palaver of the people
  in this village, and all those countrymen who live in the forest, and tell
  them that Busubu was mad and fell into the river, and was drowned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His leg being caught by the terrible ones,&rdquo; suggested his
  nephew helpfully. &ldquo;And, M&rsquo;gula, I will sit in my father&rsquo;s
  place and give justice. When Sandi comes, and hearing me speak cleverly, he
  shall say: &lsquo;This son of Busubu is my chief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His proposal aroused no enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is I who will sit in the place of my brother, for I am an old
  man, and old men are wise. And when Sandi comes I will speak for you
  both,&rdquo; he added cunningly.</p>

  <p>And so it was arranged. M&rsquo;gula sat on the stool of office on the
  thatched palaver house, and gave judgment and made speeches. One day he
  invited his two nephews to a great feast of fish and <i>maniac</i>. After the
  feast the young men were taken ill. They were buried in a middle island the
  next morning, and M&rsquo;gula took their wives into his house. Bosambo,
  Paramount Chief of the Ochori, heard rumours, and sent a pigeon to Sanders a
  month or so later.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;gula? Who the devil is M&rsquo;gula?&rdquo; demanded
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>They were at breakfast in the big, airy dining-room of the residency.
  Sanders had read aloud a message that had come by pigeon post that
  morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear old Ham!&rdquo; said Bones, who sat opposite to him,
  &ldquo;my <i>dear</i> Captain and Honourable! Do you mean to tell me that you
  don&rsquo;t know M&rsquo;gula?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbets sat with coffee cup poised, an expression of
  incredulity and wonder on his pink face. He spoke a little thickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to heavens, Bones, you wouldn&rsquo;t speak with your mouth
  full. Weren&rsquo;t you taught manners as a boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones swallowed something rapidly and painfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made
  me swallow a plum-stone, cruel old prefect,&rdquo; he said reproachfully.
  &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get off M&rsquo;gula. I don&rsquo;t profess to know
  every jolly old indigenous native by sight, but I know
  M&rsquo;gula&mdash;he&rsquo;s the fisherman johnny: quite a lad...Isisi
  river. Am I right, excellency?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders, lighting a black cheroot, shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  wrong. He&rsquo;s a man of the Northern Ochori.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I said Isisi,&rdquo; said Bones shamelessly, &ldquo;I
  naturally meant the Ochori. I know his father. Jolly nice, amiable old
  rascal...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hanged his father ten years ago,&rdquo; said the patient Sanders,
  &ldquo;and I think that hanging runs in the family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; murmured Bones, unabashed. &ldquo;Now that you come
  to mention him, sir, I remember him. M&rsquo;gula, of course. Dear old Ham,
  I&rsquo;m really surprised at your forgetting a fellow like
  M&rsquo;gula!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has he been doing, sir?&rdquo; asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poison&mdash;that is certain; probably a more picturesque murder,
  though I think that is going to be difficult to prove. Busubu, the little
  chief in that part of the country, has disappeared. I think he was a little
  mad. The last time I was through the country he was developing sleep
  sickness&mdash;the neck glands were typical, but I thought he&rsquo;d last
  longer before the mad stage was reached.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He tapped his white teeth with the tip of his of his
  fingers&mdash;evidence of his uneasiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to send you up to the country,
  Bones&mdash;you could take the <i>Wiggle</i> and call in Bosambo <i>en
  route</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely it is rather a simple matter to bring M&rsquo;gula to
  trial?&rdquo; asked Hamilton. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t unusual. A chief
  mysteriously disappears, a relative jumps into the vacant
  place...?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head. &ldquo;There is a curious feature about this
  crime&mdash;if it is a crime. Nobody can be found who can or will give
  evidence. Usually, even in a small village, you can collect a dozen stories
  that fit together. Bosambo says that two months ago M&rsquo;gula made a
  journey to headquarters&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember his coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something in Bones&rsquo; face attracted his superior&rsquo;s
  attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones! You saw him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I, dear old Ham? I&rsquo;m blessed if I remember. What with
  sitting up all night with your jolly old hens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw him, and I&rsquo;ll bet your infernal passion for educating
  the unfortunate native is responsible. What branch of study did you
  take?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones rose from the table and folded his serviette deliberately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If every time a naughty old chief disappears you&rsquo;re going to
  lay it at my door, sir,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;and if
  every&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he stopped and his tone changed. &ldquo;What
  about sending me up to nose around, excellency? I don&rsquo;t want to praise
  myself but I&rsquo;ve got a gift for that sort of work. Things you
  wouldn&rsquo;t notice, dear old bat-eyed superior, I should spot in a minute.
  You know me, excellency&mdash;when you lost your cigarette holder, who found
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But who put you on the track, dear old Ham? Who was it said,
  &rsquo;Did you look in your pocket?&rsquo; Me! I bet I&rsquo;d unearth this
  mystery in two twinks! It&rsquo;s observation that does it. A little bit of
  cigar ash, a torn-up letter. Things an ordinary Johnny wouldn&rsquo;t think
  of looking for...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find either cigar ash or letters
  in the Ochori forest,&rdquo; said Sanders drily, &ldquo;but I do feel that
  this matter should be inquired into. Take the <i>Wiggle</i>, Bones, and go to
  the village. You might pick up Bosambo on your way. Leave the appointment of
  a new chief to him. And be careful! These folk of the north are queer and
  clannish. Even Bosambo has never quite mastered them. You may be
  successful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones smiled indulgently at the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo, Paramount Chief of the Ochori, held a palaver of all his fifty
  chiefs, for there was trouble in the land. The crops had unexpectedly failed,
  goat sickness had made a mysterious and devastating appearance, and three
  considerable tribes had refused tribute, and had sent defiant messages to
  their lord. There was talk of a confederation between these, and that could
  only mean war. Moreover, a collector of taxes had been beaten to death, and
  another, Bosambo suspected, had been drowned. Bosambo, wearing his cloak of
  monkey tails and in his hand his three short killing spears, listened hour
  after hour as speaker after speaker arose and addressed him. Then at last
  spoke M&rsquo;febi, a chief and suspected witch-doctor. All the day he had
  been waiting for this man, the most powerful of his subjects and the most
  antagonistic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Bosambo, you have heard,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;febi, in a
  deathly silence, &ldquo;from one end of the land to the other there is
  sickness, and none who lie down at night know what the sun will show. Now I
  know, being a wise man and acquainted with mysteries, that there is a reason,
  and this I tell you. The Fearful Word has been spoken, and the Swamp Ghost is
  abroad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A murmur of horror ran through the assembly. Men rubbed their hands in the
  dust and smeared their arms hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because of this,&rdquo; M&rsquo;febi went on, gratified by the
  sensation he had caused, &ldquo;our crops are rotting and our goats lie down
  and die, making noises in their throats. Now you, Bosambo, who are so clever
  and are loved by Sandi, you shall show us a magic that will make the corn
  rise up and the goats become lively.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo raised his hand to check further eloquence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;febi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;am I a magician? Can I make
  the dead live? Say this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;febi hesitated, sensing danger. &ldquo;Lord, you are not,&rdquo;
  he admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was good you said that,&rdquo; said Bosambo ominously,
  &ldquo;for if I were such a magician I should have speared you where you
  stand, knowing that I could bring you to life again. As for the Fearful Word,
  that is your story. And, I tell you, M&rsquo;febi, that I have a quick way
  with men and chiefs who bring me ghosts when I ask for rubber. They also make
  noises in their throats and sleep on their faces. I will have tribute, for
  that is my due and the due of Sandi and his king. As for these northern men
  who conspire against me, I will take fire and spears to them, and they shall
  give blood for tribute. The palaver is finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That day he summoned his fighting regiments, young men who sneered at
  spirits and laughed in the face of M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba Himself, and
  they came to the call of his <i>lokali</i>, in tens and tens from every
  village within sound of his drum, and made spear play on the plain beyond the
  city.</p>

  <p>Bones arrived to find the capital an armed camp, and Bosambo, meeting him
  on the beach, thought it prudent to say nothing of the unrest in his land. It
  was when Bones put forward the suggestion that the chief should accompany him
  to the northern territory that his face fell, and he found some difficulty in
  explaining his unwillingness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Tibbetti, I would go to the end of the world for Sandi, but
  for you I would go up into hell. But now is a bad time, for I have many
  palavers to hold, and it is the month of taxing. Therefore, Tibbetti, go
  alone, and I will come after you before the full moon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A plan which suited the amateur detective, who wanted the full credit for
  the discoveries he was confident of making.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This Busubu was mad,&rdquo; said Bosambo at parting. &ldquo;As to
  M&rsquo;gula, I know nothing of him because he is a common man. I think if
  you would burn his feet a little he would tell you Tibbetti for the soles of
  old men are very tender.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones knew a better way.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the day that Bones arrived in the village, M&rsquo;gula
  held a secret conference with the chiefs of the three revolting tribes, whose
  territories adjoined his own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My spies have brought me word that Tibbetti is coming with soldiers
  in his little ship to hear the manner of Busubu&rsquo;s death. Now, Tibbetti
  is my friend, for he has shown me the way to power And because he is my
  friend, I will send him to you to make a palaver.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if he comes, he will bring his soldiers,&rdquo; demurred one of
  the rebel chiefs, &ldquo;and that would he a bad palaver. How do we know,
  M&rsquo;gula, that you will not speak evilly of us to Tibbetti, who is the
  son of Sandi? For it is clear that you have now become a man too great for
  your village, and they say that you desire to rule the three northern tribes
  in the manner of Gubala,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He named an ancient chief who had been dead 800 years, but to the native
  800 years is yesterday, and yesterday is centuries past.</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;gula was nonplussed by the crude expression of his own secret
  thoughts and ambitions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After Tibbetti has gone, we will speak again,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;You shall come to my fine house and we will have a feast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better you came to my fine house and had a feast,&rdquo; said the
  spokesman of the northern tribes, significantly, &ldquo;for I do not wish to
  have a pain in my belly, and lie in the middle island,
  M&rsquo;gula.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It seemed that the death of M&rsquo;gula&rsquo;s nephews had not passed
  unnoticed. However, he appeased his guests, sent them back to their
  territories satisfied with his <i>bona fides</i>, and prepared for the coming
  of Bones.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts had not arrived in the village more than half an hour
  before, with a large pipe in his mouth and a ferocious frown on his face, he
  began his investigations. Willing but untruthful men and women showed him the
  exact spot on the beach where Busubu had been standing when the crocodile
  seized him. In corroboration they pointed to the identical silurian, basking
  at that moment on a low sandbank in the middle of the river, open-mouthed.
  Bones had a momentary impulse to shoot the crocodile and make a thorough
  investigation of his interior, but thought perhaps that too long a time had
  passed for such clues to be of any value. With the assistance of a
  tape-measure and a piece of pencil he made an exact plan of the village,
  showing the distance from Busubu&rsquo;s house to the river. Then he
  interviewed Busubu&rsquo;s late wives, sullen, stupid women, wholly absorbed
  in their domestic occupations. They could tell him nothing except that Busubu
  had gone out of the hut and had not come back. They conveniently forgot the
  circumstances of his leaving. They only knew he did not return, and that they
  had gone into the house of M&rsquo;gula.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very baffling,&rdquo; said Bones, shaking his head seriously.</p>

  <p>He slept at night on the little steamer, which was moored close to the
  bank. His days were occupied in his search, his evenings in the acquirement
  of knowledge. If he could inspire M&rsquo;gula, M&rsquo;gula would tell him
  much that would fascinate him. Bones had a passion for native folk-lore, and
  learnt three new stories about snakes, a brand new legend concerning
  M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba, and a mystery poem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, this is the great secret of our people,&rdquo; said
  M&rsquo;gula in a hushed voice; &ldquo;for any man who knows this poem has
  power over all the world. And if it were known that I had taught you, I think
  my people would kill me. If a white lord speaks this wonder, all men will
  worship him, and he shall be as great as M&rsquo;shimba. Because I love you,
  Tibbetti, and because you have told me so many beautiful things, I have
  taught you this. Now say with me again the words &lsquo;Talaka m&rsquo;sidi
  lulanga...&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Bones became word perfect. He had been a week conducting his
  investigations, without discovering anything more than he knew when he
  arrived; on the seventh day came an invitation from Lusingi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, these people are in revolt against Bosambo, who has treated
  them cruelly. I think it would please Sandi if you spoke to them in your
  loving way, for they are very simple. Also, lord, if you spoke to them the
  poem which I have told you, they would be very worshipful, giving you the
  tribute which they deny to Bosambo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was an opportunity at which Bones jumped. To go back and confess his
  failure as a detective was one thing; to carry in his hands the pacification
  of a revolting tribe was another. Sanders would value the latter achievement
  even more than the unravelling of the mystery of Busubu&rsquo;s death.</p>

  <p>The city of Lusingi lay five miles from the river and Bones went gaily,
  unattended. M&rsquo;gula walked with him to the end of the village street,
  and then returned with his counsellors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think the people of Lusingi will kill Tibbetti,&rdquo; he said
  cheerfully, &ldquo;and then I will send word to Sandi, and he will know I am
  his true friend, and give me the four tribes. In this way do men become
  great, Osuru, even as the lord Tibbetti said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The innocent Bones reached the town and was met by the chief and escorted
  to the palaver house. Looking down on the mass of unfriendly faces that were
  turned up to him, Bones smirked inwardly.</p>

  <p>Their grievances he knew. The uneasy chief, not knowing what military
  forces might be behind Tibbetti, had stated them concisely. There was a devil
  in the land, and goats were dying; and on the top of this, Bosambo had sent
  for his tribute&mdash;a familiar plaint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O people,&rdquo; said Bones, &ldquo;I see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He spoke fluently in the soft and silky tongue of the Northern Ochori,
  which differs slightly from the Bomongo tongue used from one end of the river
  to the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sandi has sent me here to look into your hearts...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His address mainly dealt with native economics. Here Bones was speaking as
  an expert, because he was well grounded in the problems which confronted
  these peasant farmers. Presently he came to his peroration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O people, hear me! I speak for Sandi, and for the Government. When
  the crops are good and your goats are many, and the little trees in the
  forest give you rubber in plenty, do you not make a store of corn and rubber,
  so that when the bad days come, you shall neither starve nor come
  empty-handed to your Paramount Chief? Now, these days have come, and your
  stores must be opened, and that which is buried must be dug up. This is the
  way of all the world, that bad days and good days follow one
  another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His audience stared at him stonily. The miserly traits of the Northern
  Ochori are notorious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now I will say to you a poem of great power and magic,&rdquo;
  said Bones, smacking his lips in anticipation. &ldquo;Let all men
  listen...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A silence as of the grave fell upon his audience with the first words of
  his great effort. Bones closed his eyes and started. He was thoroughly
  enjoying himself. He heard a rustle of movement, and drew an altogether wrong
  conclusion as to its cause. When he opened his eyes he was alone. The little
  hill, which had been covered thickly with the people of the town, was
  deserted. Men and women were flying to the shelter of their own homes, that
  their ears should not be shocked by the Fearful Word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; gasped Bones, and looked round.</p>

  <p>The chief and his counsellors had already disappeared. He was entirely
  alone. In a few moments there was nothing human in sight, and the hair at the
  back of his neck lifted. Bones had smelt the danger instantly.</p>

  <p>He drew his long-barrelled Browning from the holster at his side, felt for
  the spare magazine he always carried, and, pulling back the jacket of the
  pistol, pushed a cartridge into the chamber, Then he walked slowly down the
  hill. His way back to the river lay through the interminable main street of
  the town. Keeping to the centre of the broad road, he walked without haste,
  and from the dark interiors savage eyes followed him. And still there was no
  movement. Looking round, he glimpsed one head thrust out from an open
  doorway, but it was instantly withdrawn.</p>

  <p>He knew that nothing would happen to him while he was in the town; the
  danger lay in the thick woods beyond. He put up his hands and measured the
  distance of the sun from the horizon. He had three-quarters of an hour before
  night fell, and he was five and a half miles from the boat.</p>

  <p>It was the poem, he thought; and somehow he connected the poem with the
  mysterious disappearance of Busubu. Reaching the end of the village street,
  he walked quickly through the rank grass which separated him from the forest
  path.</p>

  <p><i>Whizz!</i></p>

  <p>A spear flew past him, buried itself in a tree, quivering. Bones spun
  round, his gun outstretched. There was nobody in sight.</p>

  <p>Then he broke into a run, and instantly the spears began to fall around
  him. He located the point of attack: it was the long grass to the left.
  Levelling his pistol, he fired twice, and a dark figure sprang up and fell
  again. This time Bones really ran.</p>

  <p>The path twisted and turned, with never more that a dozen straight yards;
  and so long as he could keep ahead of his pursuers, he was safe, for the wood
  was too thick for spear work. He padded on swiftly, but the sound of feet
  behind him grew nearer and nearer, and he stopped and turned. As he did so,
  the sound of the running ceased.</p>

  <p>Bones could not afford to wait, for he knew that the men who were
  following him were at that moment moving through the forest from trunk to
  trunk, in an attempt to outflank him. Again he ran, and this time the hunters
  came into view. A spear passed so close to him that it brushed his gaitered
  leg.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously he wondered how they came to miss him, for the Ochori are
  famous spearmen, and it was only later he learnt that the swamp demanded a
  live sacrifice. He turned and fired three times into the thick of his hunters
  and checked them for a second; then, as he thought he had reached an elbow of
  the path, a spear fell between his legs. He stumbled and fell, and before he
  could rise, they were on him. Near by was a crazy death-hut, one of the
  places to which the people of the town take their aged relatives when they
  are past work and are becoming a burden to the community. Here they die, and
  the wild beasts carry them to their lairs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a bad thing you do, <i>man</i>,&rdquo; said Bones when he
  recovered his breath; &ldquo;for presently Sandi will come and then I think
  there will be many hangings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He addressed the chief of Lusingi who had welcomed him less than an hour
  before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tibbetti, though we all hang, you must die, for you have spoken the
  Fearful Word that loosens the great Ghost of the Swamp, and now misfortune
  will come to this land, and our children will have sickness, and fire will
  fall on our huts. Because we are afraid, we shall take you to the swamp of
  the Ghost, and we shall blind you a little, and afterwards the fearful ones
  will have you. So sleep, Tibbetti, for when the moon comes up we must
  walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had taken away his arms, but they had not bound him, and Bones sat
  down on the floor of the hut, his head in his hands, considering the
  possibilities of escape. They were few, for it seemed that every man capable
  of carrying a spear had left the town and had come out to hunt him. From
  where he sat he could see that the wood was filled with men. The prospect was
  not cheerful.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw the chief pass the entrance of the hut, and called
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did Busubu speak the Fearful
  Word?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief shook his head affirmatively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And thus he died, by the pool of the swamp!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, thus he died,&rdquo; agreed the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mystery solved!&rdquo; said Bones with melancholy satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He had been up early that morning, and he had had an exhausting day. There
  was something in the suggestion which the chief had made. He was healthy and
  young and lived in the minute. He had hardly stretched himself upon the
  ground before he was asleep.</p>

  <p>When Bones awoke it was daylight, and he sat up quickly. Through the
  opening of the hut there was nobody in sight. Something hanging on the thin
  roof-beam caught his eye and he gasped.</p>

  <p>It was his belt and pistol.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo; said Bones.</p>

  <p>He went blinking out into the light. At the edge of the forest path were
  two trees, and a man was sitting, his back to Bones, gazing interestedly at
  two uncomfortable figures tied very tightly to the trunks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosambo!&rdquo; called Bones sharply, and the watcher rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I came up in the night, I and my young men, and M&rsquo;gula
  showed me the way you had gone and told me of the Fearful Word he had made
  you speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He told you...?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo did not meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Tibbetti, you have the wisdom of a snake. This they told me in
  the village: that you measured many things with your fine ribbon and looked
  at many things through your
  glass-that-makes-little-things-into-big-things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones went pink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Also by looking at leaves and cooking-pots and digging in the sand,
  and other cunning methods, you sought to find which way Busubu went. All this
  is very wonderful, but I am a simple man. I burnt M&rsquo;gula a little, and
  the soles of old men are very tender...and he told me.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I KNEW all along that it was M&rsquo;gula,&rdquo;
  said Bones to an admiring audience. &ldquo;In the first place there was a
  patch of black mud, dear old officer, on the foot of his bed. That showed me
  two things&mdash;and this is where the jolly old art of deduction comes
  in&mdash;it showed me that he had come a long journey
  and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;d been standing in mud,&rdquo; said Hamilton
  helpfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said the triumphant Bones. &ldquo;Where did the mud
  come from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From mud,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones clicked his lips impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old officer! Let me tell the story, <i>please</i>&mdash;that
  is, if you want to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Bones, you&rsquo;ve been
  forestalled&mdash;Bosambo has sent me two very long and detailed
  messages,&rdquo; smiled Sanders. &ldquo;According to him M&rsquo;gula
  confessed under a primitive form of torture.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only for a second was Bones nonplussed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But who was it set his jolly old conscience working?&rdquo; he
  demanded in triumph.</p>

  <h2><a name="story02"
     id="story02">II. &mdash; THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Mar
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR the use of Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, Lieutenant of Houssas,
  and called by all and sundry &ldquo;Bones,&rdquo; a hut had at one time been
  erected. It was a large hut, and in many ways a handsome hut, and would have
  accommodated 999 young officers out of a thousand. There was even a
  shower-bath operating from a lofty barrel. But the interests of Bones were
  multifarious. His hobbies were many. They came and went, and in their passing
  left on the shelves, in the cupboards and under the table and bed, distinct
  evidence of their existence. As the scientist may, by the examination of
  geological strata, trace the history of the world, so might an expert delving
  into the expensive litter of his hutment, follow Bones from the Devonian eras
  (represented by a passionate search for rare and remarkable stamps) through
  Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quarternary strata of study and recreation.</p>

  <p>Another hut had been added to store his collection, and on its
  native-built shelves reposed old wireless sets that did not work and never
  had worked, volumes of self-improvers, piles of literature, thousands of
  samples ranging from linoleum to breakfast foods, boxes of scientific and
  quasi-scientific instruments (he took a correspondence course in mountain
  railway construction, although there were no mountains nearer than Sierra
  Leone), and rolls of electric flexes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an infernal junk shop!&rdquo; said Hamilton appalled.</p>

  <p>He had come over to make a few caustic remarks about the key of the
  store-house which, as usual when Bones had its temporary custody, had been
  left all night in the door, thereby offering temptation to Hamilton&rsquo;s
  Houssas, who were loyal but dishonest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your unscientific eyes, my dear old captain and comrade,
  yes,&rdquo; said Bones quietly. &ldquo;To my shrewd old optics, no.
  Everything there has its value, its <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>&mdash;which is
  a French expression that is Greek to you, dear old Ham&mdash;its&mdash;its
  requirability.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Hamilton, picking up a queer-looking
  object.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Bones without hesitation, &ldquo;is an instrument
  used in wireless&mdash;it would take too long to explain, Ham. Unless
  you&rsquo;ve got a groundin&rsquo; in science, dear old ignoramus, any
  explanation would he undecipherable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unintelligible is the word you want,&rdquo; said Hamilton, and read
  with difficulty the words stamped upon the steel side of the instrument.
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Robinson&rsquo;s Patent Safety Razor Strop&rsquo;&mdash;you
  don&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;wireless&rsquo;&mdash;you mean
  &lsquo;hairless.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to good gracious heavens you wouldn&rsquo;t mess things
  about,&rdquo; said Bones testily, as he fixed his monocle and glared at the
  unoffending strop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth is, Bones,&rdquo; said Hamilton when he reached the open
  and had drawn in long draughts of air with offensive ostentation, &ldquo;you
  ought to burn all that rubbish. You&rsquo;ll be breeding disease of some
  kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones closed his eyes and raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am fightin&rsquo; disease, dear old layman,&rdquo; he said
  gravely, and, going back to the hut, returned with a large wooden box.
  Holding this in the cross of his arm, he opened the lid and disclosed, lying
  between layers of cottonwood, a number of long, narrow, wooden cases.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; gasped Hamilton in dismay. &ldquo;Are <i>you</i>
  going to do it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones nodded even more gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did this come&mdash;Sanders told me nothing about
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A faint and pitying smile dawned on the angular face of Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are some things which our revered old excellency never tells
  anybody,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You have surprised our secret, dear
  old Ham&mdash;may I ask you, as a man of honour an&rsquo; sensibility, dear
  old Peepin&rsquo; Tom, not to mention the fact that I have told you? I trust
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton went back to the residency, and, in defiance of the demand for
  secrecy, mentioned his discovery.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders looked up from his work. &ldquo;Vaccination
  lymph? Oh yes, it came this morning, and I sent it over to Bones. We may not
  want it, but Administration is worried about the outbreak in the French
  territory, and it may be necessary to inoculate the border people. Bones had
  better take charge&mdash;they can&rsquo;t spare a doctor from H.Q.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God bless the lad!&rdquo; said Hamilton in great relief. &ldquo;I
  was afraid that I should be the goat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders nibbled the end of his penholder. &ldquo;Bones has imagination,
  and I think he will want it when he comes to tackle the Lesser Isisi
  folk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He certainly is a ready liar,&rdquo; admitted Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Government departments have a mania for labelling any man who occupies,
  temporarily or permanently, a post under their directions. There is this
  sense in the practice&mdash;an official so labelled may be easily identified
  by the most obtuse of clerks, He may occupy a separate drawer in a filing
  cabinet, and to him, by reason of his labelling, may be attached
  responsibilities which fall within the designation they have found for him,
  Sanders received a wire from head-quarters&mdash;the wire had been working
  without interruption for a month owing to the elephants, who have a playful
  habit of uprooting the poles, moving inland for the breeding season, and the
  message ran:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;NO. 79174. ADMINISTRATION H. RE YOUR WIRE NO. 531
  T. LT. A. TIBBETTS, KING&rsquo;S HOUSSAS, IS APPOINTED TEMPORARY HEALTH
  OFFICER AND SANITARY INSPECTOR YOUR TERRITORIES, WITH ADDITIONAL PAY THREE
  SHILLINGS PER DIEM AS FROM 4TH INSTANT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. HE WILL INDENT
  AND REPORT UNDER LETTERS H.O. AND S.I. ACKNOWLEDGE.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Sanders duly acknowledged and communicated the momentous news to his
  subordinate. Bones received the intelligence very gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, dear old excellency, I shall do my best,&rdquo; he said
  seriously. &ldquo;The responsibility is simply fearful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thereafter, to use Hamilton&rsquo;s own expressive language, life became
  simply Hell.</p>

  <p>At breakfast, Bones invariably came late, smelling strongly of
  disinfectant, his manner subdued, his tone severely professional.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, excellency... Ham&mdash;Ham!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded the
  startled Ham.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you washed your hands, dear old officer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sunburn, you jackass!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones shook his head. &ldquo;Use a weak solution of carbolic acid, dear
  old infectious one,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too careful in
  these days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He invariably carried a sheet of white paper, which he laid on the chair
  before he sat down, and he insisted upon a cup of boiling-hot water being
  placed on the table so that he might sterilise his fork and knife.</p>

  <p>When, one morning, Sanders came into breakfast and found the dining-room
  reeking with carbolic, he struck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, I appreciate your conscientious efforts on behalf of
  hygiene, but if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d rather die of disease than
  endure this stink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Microbes, dear old excellency,&rdquo; murmured Bones. &ldquo;This
  is stuff that makes naughty old Mike go red in the face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I prefer that he remains pale,&rdquo; said Sanders, and called his
  orderly to open the windows.</p>

  <p>More annoying was the practice which Bones initiated of inspecting his
  superiors&rsquo; sleeping quarters. Hamilton found him in his bedroom with a
  tape-measure and a look of profound distress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ham, old fugg-wallah, this won&rsquo;t do at all!&rdquo; said
  Bones, shaking his head reprovingly. &ldquo;Bless my jolly old life and soul,
  you&rsquo;d be <i>dead</i> if I hadn&rsquo;t come in! How many cubic feet do
  you think you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two feet,&rdquo; answered the exasperated Hamilton,
  &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;re not out of this room in three twinks, I&rsquo;m
  going to use one of them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; Bones stirred a heap of clothing
  with the end of his stick. &ldquo;Trousers, dear old thing, coats an&rsquo;
  hats&mdash;don&rsquo;t get peevish, Ham. Us medical lads&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Us&rsquo;&rdquo; sneered Hamilton. &ldquo;You illiterate
  hound! Get out!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is very trying to be brought into daily and hourly contact with a man
  who smelt alternately of lysol and naphthaline. It was maddening to find
  dinner delayed because Bones had strolled into the kitchen and had condemned
  the cooking arrangements; but the culmination of his infamy came when he
  invented a new filter that turned the drinking water a deep, rich pink that
  made it taste of iron filings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you telegraph to head-quarters and have him reduced to
  the ranks, sir?&rdquo; asked Hamilton savagely, after he had found crystals
  of pure carbolic acid in his shaving mug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being sanitised to
  death!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Happily a tax-collecting tour was due, and Sanders was not sorry. Bones,
  of course, ordered the thorough fumigation of the <i>Zaire</i>, and for three
  days after the little steamer started on her voyage, the unhappy crew
  breathed sulphur fumes and drank sulphur water and ate sulphurated rice.</p>

  <p>Bones came down to the quay, a strange and awesome spectacle; a thin veil
  of antiseptic gauze hung from the edges of his helmet like a curtain, and on
  his hands were odorous gloves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hail to the bride!&rdquo; snarled Hamilton from the bridge.
  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your orange blossom, Birdie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I order you to keep away from the Ochori,&rdquo; cried Bones in a
  muffled voice, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s measles there&mdash;drink nothing but
  Lithia water...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton replied offensively.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE runs between the Pool of the Silent Ones and the
  Lesser Isisi, a strip of land which is neither forest nor swamp, and yet is
  of the nature of both. Here grow coarse trees that survive even the
  parasitical growths which shoot upward in one humid night to the height of a
  tall man; and here come the silent ones to sleep between trees, secure in the
  swamps that surround them and the guardianship of those little birds who love
  crocodiles and stand sentinel over them when they slumber. Of other birds
  there are few; other beasts do not come to the Wood of the Waters, and the
  elephants&rsquo; playing ground is on the firmer shore of the river. Here
  they have levelled the trees and stamped the earth flat, so that they may
  gambol and chase one another and the calves may fight to the applause of
  trumpetings and waving trunks. There are many rotting huts in the Wood of the
  Waters, for the Isisi send here the old, the blind, and the mad, that they
  may die without distressing the whole and the sane. Sometimes they kill one
  another, but generally a scaly form creeps up from the mud and knocks them
  into the water with its quick tail, and there is an end.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders was mad, but not slayable, by reason of his
  soldiers, his long-nosed &ldquo;wung-wung&rdquo; (so they called his
  hotchkiss) and the brass-jacketted guns that said &ldquo;ha-ha-ha!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nobody but a madman would go squelching through the noisome mud of the
  wood, peering into foul huts, raking over ground for signs of skeletons (all
  that the crocodiles did not take was the little red ants&rsquo; by right).
  Yet this is what Sandi did. He slowed his fine boat and brought her to the
  bank.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have impressed upon Lulaga the impropriety of hastening the
  deaths of his relatives,&rdquo; he said to Captain Hamilton of the Houssas,
  &ldquo;and he has sworn by M&rsquo;shimba and his own particular devil that
  there shall be no more blinding or old-age-pensioning,&rdquo; he added
  grimly.</p>

  <p>Hamilton smiled wearily. &ldquo;&rsquo;The customs of the country must not
  be lightly overridden or checked,&rsquo;&rdquo; he quoted from a famous
  Instruction received from the Colonial Office in bygone days&mdash;there
  isn&rsquo;t a Commissioner from K&rsquo;sala to Tuli Drift who cannot recite
  it by heart, especially after dinner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor,&rsquo;&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;&rsquo;should his
  religious observances or immemorial practices be too rudely suppressed,
  remembering that the native, under God&rsquo;s providence, is a man and a
  brother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; snarled Sanders, but the inexorable Houssa was not
  to be suppressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He should be approached gently,&rsquo;&rdquo; he went on,
  &ldquo;&rsquo;with arguments and illustrations obvious to his simple mind.
  Corporal punishment must under no circumstances be inflicted save in
  exceptionally serious crimes, and then only by order of the supreme judiciary
  of the country&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That looks to me like a new hut,&rdquo; said Sanders, and stepped
  over the hastily rigged gang-way, twirling a mahogany stick in his thin,
  brown hand.</p>

  <p>Threading his way through a green and anaemic plantation, he came to the
  hut, and there he found B&rsquo;saba, sometime headman of the village of
  M&rsquo;fusu, and B&rsquo;saba was mad and silly and was chuckling and
  whimpering alternately, being far gone in sleeping sickness, which turns men
  into beasts. He was blind, and he had not been blind very long.</p>

  <p>The nose of Sandi <i>elaka</i> wrinkled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man, I see you, but you cannot see me. I am Sandi, who gives
  justice. Now tell me, who brought you here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lulaga the king,&rdquo; said the old man woefully. &ldquo;Also he
  has taken my pretty eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He died that night, Sanders squatting on the ground by his side and
  feeding the fire that warmed him. And they buried him deep, and Sanders spoke
  well of him, for he had been a faithful servant of Government for many
  years.</p>

  <p>In the dawn-grey he turned the nose of the <i>Zaire</i> against the push
  of the black waters and came to the village of the chief, to that man&rsquo;s
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>The <i>lokalis</i> beat a summons to a great palaver, and in the
  reed-roofed hut Sanders sat in judgment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said the trembling Lulaga. &ldquo;I did this because
  of a woman of mine who was mocked by the old man in his madness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let her come here,&rdquo; said Sanders, and they brought her, a
  mature woman of sixteen, very slim, supple and defiant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me your medal, Lulaga,&rdquo; said Sanders, and the chief
  lifted the cord that held his silver medal of chieftainship. And when Sanders
  had placed it upon the neck of a trustworthy man, and this man had eaten salt
  from the palm of the Commissioner&rsquo;s hand, soldiers tied Lulaga to a
  tree, and one whipped him twenty times across the shoulders, and the whip had
  nine tails, and each was a yard in length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old men and madmen shall die in good time,&rdquo; said Sanders.
  &ldquo;This is the law of my King, and if this law be broken I will come with
  a rope. Hear me. The palaver is finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There came to him, as he made his way back to the ship, an elderly man
  who, by the peculiar shape of his spear, he knew was from the inner
  lands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I am M&rsquo;kema of the village by the Frenchi,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;being a chief of those parts. Now, it seems to me that you have
  taken away the magic which our fathers gave to us, for all men know that the
  sick and old are nests where devils breed, and unless we kill them gently
  there will be sickness in the land. On the other side of the little river the
  Frenchi people are very sick, and some say that the sickness will come to us.
  What magic do you give us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders was instantly alert.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any men of the Frenchi tribes who cross the river you shall drive
  back with your spears,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if they will not go, you
  shall kill them and burn their bodies. And I will send Tibbett, who carries
  many wonders in a little box, so that you shall not be harmed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the way down river, Sanders was unusually thoughtful. Not less so was
  Captain Hamilton, for, as the elder man had said, from the beginning of time
  every tribe, save the Ochori, had carried its ancient men and women into the
  forest and left them there to die. Sanders had threatened; he had on
  occasions caught men in the act of carrying off their uncomfortable
  relatives; but never before had he punished so definitely for a custom which
  the ages had sanctioned.</p>

  <p>They smelt headquarters before they saw the grey quay and the flowering
  palm-tops that hid the residency. Suddenly Sanders sniffed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in the name of Heaven&mdash;!&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>A gentle wind, blowing in from the sea, carried to him a strange and
  penetrating odour. It was not exactly the smell of tar, nor was it the scent
  which one associates with a burning soap factory. It combined the pungent
  qualities of both. Later, Sanders learnt that, in his absence, a trading
  steamer had called and had landed half-a-dozen carboys of creosote for the
  use of the Health Officer, and that Bones, in his enthusiasm and in that
  capacity, had tried the experiment of a general fumigation. The fire whereon
  the creosote had been transformed into its natural gases, still smouldered in
  the centre of the square, and Bones, a fearsome object in a gas mask, and
  without any assistance&mdash;his men had practically mutinied and flown to
  their huts&mdash;was continuing the experiment when, in sheer self-defence,
  Sanders pulled the siren of the <i>Zaire</i> and emitted so blood-curdling a
  yell that it reached beyond the protective covering of Bones&rsquo; mask.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike, what are you trying to do?&rdquo; gasped
  Hamilton, spluttering and coughing.</p>

  <p>Bones made signs. After his helmet had been removed, he propounded the
  results of his experiments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a jolly old rat left alive,&rdquo; he said
  triumphantly; &ldquo;the beetles have turned in their jolly old numbers, and
  the mosquitos have quietly passed away!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are any of the company left?&rdquo; demanded Hamilton,
  &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Creosote,&rdquo; began Bones, in his professorial manner, &ldquo;is
  one of those jolly old bug-haters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, I&rsquo;ve got a job for you,&rdquo; said Sanders hastily.
  &ldquo;Get steam in the <i>Wiggle</i> and go up to the Lesser Isisi and on to
  the French frontier. Near a village which I gather is M&rsquo;taka there is
  smallpox. Vaccinate everybody within a ten mile radius and be
  happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And keep away from the French territory,&rdquo; warned
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones smiled contemptuously. &ldquo;Am I a ravin&rsquo; old
  ass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not &lsquo;old,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Within two hours Bones was on his way, a huge pipe clenched between his
  teeth, a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles ("And God knows where he got those
  from!&rdquo; said Hamilton in despair) on his nose, and, balanced upon his
  knees, a ponderous medical tome. The fact that it was a surgical work dealing
  with nerve centres made no difference to Bones, it was the only medical work
  he had&mdash;it had been sent to him, in response to his written request to a
  London publisher for a novel that was enjoying some popularity at the time.
  And if, reading Bones&rsquo; vile handwriting, the publisher translated his
  request for &ldquo;&rsquo;Walter Newman&rsquo;s Sister&rdquo; into
  &ldquo;Watts&rsquo; Diseases of the Nervous System,&rdquo; he was hardly to
  blame.</p>

  <p>In course of time he came to the Lesser Isisi, and was received with great
  honour by the new chief. It seemed that every man, woman and child in the
  village had turned out to meet him, But there were no marks of special
  enthusiasm, nor did any of the people smile. And the folk of the Lesser Isisi
  are only too ready to laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the new chief; &ldquo;all men know that you bring
  great magic in your two hands, for Sandi has spoken well of you, and it is
  known that you are a friend of ju-jus and ghosts. Therefore, my people have
  come that they may see this magic which is greater than the magic of our
  fathers,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This he said publicly, for all men to hear. In the privacy of his hut, he
  told another story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The people have anger in their stomachs, because Sandi whipped
  Lulaga, and there have been secret palavers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And,
  lord, I think they will make an end to me. Also, there is a saying that Sandi
  loves death and hates the people of the Isisi, so that he would be glad if
  the cooking-pots were broken and the roofs of the village were
  fallen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus he symbolised death, for when a man of the Isisi passes, the pots
  wherein his food was cooked are broken on his grave, and no man tends his hut
  until the winds and the rain bring it sagging to the ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is foolish talk,&rdquo; said Bones, &ldquo;since Sandi has
  sent me to make all people well by the wonder which is in my little box.
  Behold, I will put into their arms a great medicine, so that they shall laugh
  at ghosts and mock at devils. For I am very honoured in my land because of my
  great wisdom with medicine,&rdquo; added Bones immodestly.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by four soldiers, he marched two days into the forest and came
  at last to the village by the water, and arrived only in time; for, in
  defiance of Sandi&rsquo;s orders, three men from the Frenchi village had
  crossed in the night and were being entertained by the headman himself. They
  left hurriedly and noisily, Bones chasing them to their canoe, and whacking
  at them with his walking-stick until they were out of reach of his arm. Then
  he came back to the village and called a palaver. In the palaver house,
  placed upon an upturned drum, and covered with one of his famous sanitary
  handkerchiefs, were innumerable little tubes and a bright lancet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O people,&rdquo; said Bones in his glib Bomongo&mdash;and he spoke
  the language like a native&mdash;&ldquo;Sandi has sent me because I am
  greater than ju-jus and more wonderful than devils. And I will put into your
  bodies a great magic, that shall make the old men young and the young men
  like leopards, and shall make your women beautiful and your little children
  stronger than elephants!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held up a tube of lymph, and it glittered in the strong sunlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This magic I found through my wonderful mind. It was brought to me
  by three birds from M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba because he loves me. Come
  you M&rsquo;kema,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He beckoned the chief, and the old man came forward fearfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All ghosts hear me!&rdquo; said Bones oracularly, and his singsong
  voice had the quality of a parrot&rsquo;s screech. &ldquo;M&rsquo;shimba
  M&rsquo;shamba, hear me! Bugulu, eater of moons and swallower of rivers, hear
  me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man winced as the lancet scraped his arm.
  &ldquo;Abracadabra!&rdquo; said Bones, and dropped the virus to the
  wound.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, that hurts,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;kema. &ldquo;It is like the
  fire of Hell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So shall your heart be like fire, and your bones young, and you
  shall skip over high trees, and have many new wives,&rdquo; promised Bones
  extravagantly.</p>

  <p>One by one they filed past him, men, women and children, fear and hope
  puckered in their brows, and Bones recited his mystic formula.</p>

  <p>They were finished at last, and Bones, weary but satisfied, went to the
  hut which had been prepared for him, and, furiously rejecting the
  conventional offer of the chief&rsquo;s youngest daughter for his
  wife&mdash;Sanders had a polite and suave formula for this rejection, but
  Bones invariably blushed and sputtered&mdash;went to sleep with a sense of
  having conferred a great blessing upon civilisation; for by this time Bones
  had forgotten that such a person as Dr. Jenner had ever existed, and took to
  himself the credit for all his discoveries.</p>

  <p>He spent an exhilarating three days in the village, indulging in an orgy
  of condemnation which would have reduced the little township to about three
  huts, had his instructions been taken literally. Then, one morning, came the
  chief, M&rsquo;kema.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a devil in my arm, and your
  magic is burning terribly. Now, I have thought that I will not have your
  magic, for I was more comfortable as a plain man. Also my wives are crying
  with pain, and the little children are making sad noises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walking down the village street, Bones was greeted with scowling faces,
  and from every hut, it seemed, issued moans of distress. In his wisdom Bones
  called a palaver, and his four soldiers stood behind him, their magazines
  charged, their rifles lying handily in the crooks of their unvaccinated
  arms.</p>

  <p>As a palaver, it was not a success. He had hardly begun to speak before
  there arose a wail from his miserable audience, and the malcontents found a
  spokesman in one Busubu, a petty chief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, before you came we were happy, and now you have put fiery
  snakes in our arms, so that they are swollen. Now by your magic make us well
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the clamour that followed the words drowned anything that Bones had to
  say. That night he decided to make his way back to the river.</p>

  <p>He came from his hut and found Ahmet waiting for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, there is trouble here,&rdquo; said the Kano boy in a low
  voice, &ldquo;and the young men have taken their spears to the forest
  path.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was serious news, and a glance showed Bones that the village was very
  much awake. To force his way through the forest path was suicidal; to remain
  was asking for a six-line obituary notice in the <i>Guildford Herald.</i>
  Bones brought his party to the little river, and half the ground had not been
  covered before he was fighting a rear-guard action. With some difficulty they
  found a canoe, and paddled into midstream, followed by a shower of spears,
  which wounded one of his escort. In a quarter of an hour Bones stepped ashore
  at the Frenchi village, which turned out even at that late hour to witness
  such an unusual spectacle as the arrival of a British officer on alien
  soil.</p>

  <p>He slept in the open that night, and in the morning the chief of the
  Frenchi village came to him with a complaint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, when three of my men went over the M&rsquo;taki, you whipped
  them so that they stand or sleep on their bellies. And this you did because
  of our famous sickness. Now, tell me why you sit down here with us, for my
  young men are very hot for chopping you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said Bones loftily, &ldquo;I came with magic for the
  people of the Lower Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; said the French chief significantly, &ldquo;and
  their magic is so great that they will give me ten goats for your head; yet
  because I fear Sandi I will not do this thing,&rdquo; he added hastily,
  seeing the Browning in Lieutenant Tibbetts&rsquo; hand.</p>

  <p>Briefly but lucidly, Bones explained the object of his visit, and the
  chief listened, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;there are two ways by which
  sickness may be cured. The one is death, for all dead men are well, and the
  other is by chopping a young virgin when the moon is in a certain quarter and
  the river is high. Now, my people fear that you have come to cure them by
  making their arms swell, and I cannot hold them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones took the hint, and, re-embarking, moved along the little river till
  he came to another Isisi village. But the <i>lokali</i> had rapped out the
  story of his mission, and locked shields opposed his landing.</p>

  <p>The chief of this village condescended to come to the water&rsquo;s
  edge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here you cannot land, Tibbetti,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for this is
  the order of Sandi to M&rsquo;kema, that no man must come to us from the
  Frenchi land because of the sickness that is there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For seven days and seven nights Bones was marooned between bank and bank,
  sleeping secretly at nights on such middle islands as he met with, and at the
  end of that time returned to the point of departure. M&rsquo;kema came down
  to the beach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, you cannot come here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for since you
  have gone the arms of my young men have healed owing to the magic of their
  fathers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That night, when Bones had decided upon forcing a passage to the big
  river, the relief from the <i>Zaire</i> fought its way into the village and
  left him a clear path. Bones went back in triumph to head-quarters and
  narrated his story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And there was I, dear old thing, a martyr, so to speak, to jolly
  old science, standing, as it were, with my back to the wall. I thought of
  jolly old Jenner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where were you, Bones? I can&rsquo;t quite place your
  defence,&rdquo; said Hamilton, peering over a map of the territory.
  &ldquo;Were you in M&rsquo;kema&rsquo;s village?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, I skipped,&rdquo; said Bones in triumph, &ldquo;I went
  across the river to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton gasped. &ldquo;Into the French territory?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a diplomatic incident, I admit,&rdquo; said Bones
  &ldquo;but I can explain to the President exactly the motives which led me to
  violate the territory of a friendly power&mdash;or, at least, they were not
  so friendly either, if you&rsquo;d seen the &lsquo;Petit Parisienne&rsquo;
  that came out by the marl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you were in the French village? That is all I want to
  know,&rdquo; said Hamilton with deadly quiet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly was, old thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>He led the way to Bones&rsquo; hut and opened the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get in, and don&rsquo;t come near us for a month,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re isolated!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, dear old thing, I&rsquo;m Health Officer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell the microbes,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>And isolated Bones remained. Every morning Hamilton came with a large
  garden syringe, and sprayed the ground and the roof thereof with an
  evil-smelling mixture. And, crowning infamy of all, he insisted upon handing
  the unfortunate Bones his meals through the window at the end of a long
  bamboo pole.</p>

  <p>The Health Officer had come out of isolation, and had ceased to take the
  slightest interest in medical science, devoting his spare time to a new
  architectural correspondence course, when M&rsquo;kema, summoned to
  headquarters, appeared under escort and in irons, to answer for his sins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, Tibbetti did a great evil, for he took our people, who were
  well, and made them sick. Because their arms hurt them terribly they tried to
  chop him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders listened, sitting in his low chair, his chin on his fist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are an old man and a fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For did not
  the sickness come to the Isisi? And did not the villagers have their
  mourning&mdash;all except yours, M&rsquo;kema, because of the magic which
  Tibbetti had put into their arms? Now, you are well, and the other villagers
  have their dead. How do you account for that, M&rsquo;kema?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;kema shook his head. &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was
  not by the magic of Tibbetti, for he made us ill. We are well people, and the
  sickness passed us because we followed the practice of our fathers, and took
  into the forest a woman who was very old and silly, and, putting out her
  eyes, left her to the beasts. There is no other magic like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked the despairing Sanders, and
  M&rsquo;kema, hearing these words in English, shivered, suspecting a new
  incantation.</p>

  <h2><a name="story03"
     id="story03">III. &mdash; THE BLACK EGG</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Feb
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is a new legend on the river, and it is the legend of
  a devil who came from a black egg and hated its new master so powerfully that
  it slew him.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time in the Isisi land, the birds ceased suddenly from
  gossiping at the very height of day, and goats and dogs stood up on their
  feet and looked uneasily from left to right, and there was in the world a
  sudden and an inexplicable hush, so that men came out of their huts to
  discover what was the matter.</p>

  <p>And whilst they were so standing, gaping at a silence which was almost
  visible, the world trembled, and down the long street of the Isisi city came
  a wave and a billowing of earth, so that houses shook and men fell on to
  their knees in their fear. Then came another tremble and yet another
  billowing of solid ground, and the waters of the big river flowed up in
  sudden volume and flooded the lower beaches and washed even into the forest,
  which had never seen the river before.</p>

  <p>Between the first and the second shocks of the earthquake, N&rsquo;shimba
  was born, and was named at a respectful distance after that ghost of
  ghosts&mdash;more nearly after one who had been as terrible. M&rsquo;shimba
  M&rsquo;shamba notoriously dwelt in the bowels of the earth, and was prone to
  turn in his sleep.</p>

  <p>Down the river went three canoes laden with wise men and chiefs, and they
  came solemnly into the presence of Mr. Commissioner Sanders, who, in addition
  to being responsible for the morals and welfare of a few millions of
  murderous children predisposed to cannibalism, was regarded as a controller
  of ghosts, ju-jus, the incidence of rainfall and the fertility of crops.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Sandi, I see you,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;kema, chief of the
  deputation. &ldquo;We are poor men who have come a long journey to tell you
  of terrible happenings. For you are our father and our mother and you are
  very wise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a conventional opening, and Sanders, who had felt the earthquake,
  an infrequent occurrence in these parts, waited, knowing what would come.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;...and then, lord, the river rose fearfully, washing through the
  huts of Bosubo, the fisherman, and eating up his salt. And the roof of Kusu,
  the hunter, fell down whilst he was in bed, and also two canoes were washed
  away and found by the thieving Akasava, who will not give them to us. Now
  tell us, Sandi, what made the world rock? Some of my councillors think one
  thing, some another. One says that it was M&rsquo;shimba putting up his knees
  as he slept. Men do this in their sleep, as I know. Another, that it was a
  fight between two mighty ghosts. Speak for us, Sandi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders was not prepared to give a lecture on seismology, but supplied a
  plausible, fairly accurate, not wholly fanciful explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;kema,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in this world what do you see?
  The earth and the trees upon it, and the rivers that run on the earth. And if
  you dig, there is more earth. And if you dig deeper, there is rock and more
  rock, and beneath that&mdash;who knows? Sands and rivers and soft earth
  again. And if the rivers wash away the under earth, then the rocks settle and
  the ground settles, and there are strange disturbances. As to ghosts, I know
  M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba, for he is my friend and well liked by the
  Government. But when he comes it is with a mighty wind and rains and
  spittings of fire. He lifts big trees and little trees and carries away huts,
  and he roars with a loud voice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Cala cala</i>,&rdquo; said a grey wise man (Foliti, suspected of
  witchcraft), &ldquo;in the days of our fathers this thing happened, and there
  was born in the midst of the wonder, a man whose name was Death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders knew the legend of the ancient N&rsquo;shimba, and had fixed the
  date of his appearance at somewhere in the seventeenth century. This
  N&rsquo;shimba, so miraculously born, had been a common man who had no
  respect for kings or authorities, and by his genius had made himself master
  of the land between the mountains and the sea. It was said that when he was a
  youth, a ghost brought him a black egg, and from this egg was hatched a
  devil, who gave him power so that he was greater than kings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why do you say this to me, wise
  man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, such a child has now been born in our village, and the
  mother, being mad, has named him N&rsquo;shimba. And doing this, she made
  strange faces and died, as the mother of N&rsquo;shimba of our fathers died.
  Because of this we have held a palaver for three days and three nights. And
  some said that the baby must be buried alive before the ghost comes which
  will give him power, and some that he must be put in the Pool of the Silent
  Ones, and others that he must he chopped and all of us must put our fingers
  in his blood and smear the soles of our feet, this being magic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders wrinkled his nose like an angry terrier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; he said unpleasantly, &ldquo;and be sure that I
  will come with a magic rope and hang the men who chopped him. Go back, men,
  to your villages and let this be known. That I will send a Jesus-man to this
  child, and he shall take away all that is evil in him, and then will I come
  and fix to his forehead a certain devil mark which shall be strange to see.
  Thereafter let no man raise his hand against N&rsquo;shimba, for my spirit
  will be powerfully with him. <i>Elaka!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two days after a missionary had formally baptised N&rsquo;shimba, Sanders
  came, and in view of all the silent village, pressed a small rubber stamp on
  the squirming baby&rsquo;s forehead. It was the stamp that Sanders used when
  he sent microscope slides to the School of Tropic Medicines for examination,
  and it said &ldquo;Fragile: open carefully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a sense it was an appropriate inscription.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People, I have put my ju-ju upon this child,&rdquo; said Sanders,
  addressing the multitude. &ldquo;Presently it will fade and go away, because
  by my magic it will eat into his bones and into his young heart. But because
  my magic is so fearful, I shall know who laid his hand upon this small one,
  and I shall come swiftly with my soldiers and my gun that says
  &lsquo;ha-ha-ha.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Such was the potency of the charm that, after many years, a slightly mad
  woman who struck the child, died in great agony the same night.</p>

  <p>All this happened <i>cala cala,</i> in the days when Sanders was mapping
  out the destinies of five contentious nations. From time to time he saw the
  boy, and discovered in him nothing remarkable, except that he was a little
  sulky, and, according to his father, given to long silences and to solitary
  walks. He knew none of his own kind; neither played with boys nor spoke
  frankly to girls. They said that he was looking for the black egg, and
  certainly N&rsquo;shimba climbed many trees without profit.</p>

  <p>Then one day, N&rsquo;shimba, squatting about the family fire before the
  hut, propounded a riddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I caught a young leopard and put him in the fine little house,
  where once I had kept many birds. Did my leopard sing or fly or make
  &lsquo;chip-chip&rsquo; noises?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boy, you are foolish,&rdquo; said his unimaginative father,
  &ldquo;for you have caught no leopard and you have no fine house where birds
  are kept.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my mystery,&rdquo; said N&rsquo;shimba, and, rising, walked
  away to the forest and was not seen for three days. When he returned, he
  brought with him a young girl of the Inner Isisi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is my wife,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>The father said nothing, for the boy was sixteen and of a marrying age.
  The new wife, on the contrary, said much. &ldquo;I do not want this man, your
  son,&rdquo; she said frankly. &ldquo;I am a great dancer, and my price is ten
  bundles of ten malakos in ten heaps ten times ten repeated. A man of my
  people would give as much salt as would fill a hut if I would be his wife,
  yet your son comes to me and takes me and gives nothing to my father nor to
  me. And when I turned from him, he struck me down. Here is the
  mark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The mark was horridly patent, and N&rsquo;shimba&rsquo;s father was
  troubled and sought his son.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why have you taken this woman?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Presently
  her father will come and demand her price. And Sandi will come and give
  judgment against me. Let her go, for, even if you are married to her, what
  does it matter? Is there not a saying that &rsquo;Women marry many times but
  have one husband&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am that man,&rdquo; said N&rsquo;shimba. &ldquo;As to Sandi, I am
  the child of his spirit, as all people know, and I take what I
  need.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That evening he beat his new wife, and her father, arriving in wrath to
  make the best of a bad bargain, was also beaten to his shame.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is N&rsquo;shimba?&rdquo; asked Captain Hamilton curiously when
  the news came to head-quarters, and Sanders, a thoughtful, troubled man,
  explained.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t worry me at all, but the young devil has used the
  slogan of the old N&rsquo;shimba, &rsquo;I take what I need&rsquo;&mdash;and
  that is a very bad sign. One whisper of black eggs and I will take
  N&rsquo;shimba and hang him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sent a warning, and marked down N&rsquo;shimba in his diary as one to
  be interviewed when he next went north. Then one day there came into
  existence the Blood Friends of Young Hearts.</p>

  <p>In native territories, secret societies are born in a night, and with them
  their inspired ritual. From what brain they come, none knows. The manner of
  their dissolution is as mysterious. They come and they go; perform strange
  rites, initiate secret dances; men meet one another and say meaningless but
  thrilling words; there is a ferment and thrill in life&mdash;then of a sudden
  they are no more. Some times there is a little blood-letting, as when the
  N&rsquo;gombi people held a society which was called The Mystery of the Five
  Straight Marks, Five cuts on the left cheek was the sign of the order,
  Sanders heard, saw, said nothing. On the whole, he thought the personal
  appearance of the N&rsquo;gombi people was improved by the mutilations. But
  when, at a big palaver of the society, an Ochori girl was beheaded and her
  skin distributed to the members of the order, Sanders went quickly to the
  spot, hanged the leaders, flogged their headmen, and burnt the village that
  had been the scene of the ceremony. Thereafter the Five Marks vanished from
  existence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahmet says N&rsquo;shimba is behind this new society,&rdquo; he
  said, calling Hamilton into his airy little office. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared
  lest N&rsquo;shimba discovers that the mantle of his disreputable namesake
  has descended upon him. If he does, there will be bad trouble. I think
  I&rsquo;ll send Bones to the Isisi with a platoon of young men. The wholesome
  presence of authority may nip in the bud the activities of the Young
  Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why &rsquo;Young Hearts&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Hamilton lazily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are mostly young men, and the movement is spreading,&rdquo;
  said Sanders. &ldquo;Bosambo has reported that a branch of this interesting
  society has been formed in the heart of the Ochori city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send Bones,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton promptly. &ldquo;I know of no
  more depressing influence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If this were a civilised country, and the necessary opportunities
  existed, I should say that Bones was in love,&rdquo; said Hamilton. &ldquo;As
  it is, I think he&rsquo;s sickening for something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be measles,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  had them twice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton sniffed. &ldquo;Bones is the sort of fellow who would have
  measles three times and never turn a hair. But it isn&rsquo;t measles. And it
  isn&rsquo;t liver. I had him in yesterday morning and insisted on his
  swallowing three pills. He made a fuss about it, and I had to quote the Army
  Act. And even now he&rsquo;s depressed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders stared thoughtfully across the sun-burnt parade ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think a trip to the Isisi might do him a lot of good,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE were moments when there came to the soul of Lieutenant
  Augustus Tibbetts a great unrest. Times when even the pursuit and practice of
  his latest course of study brought neither peace nor consolation. Bones (for
  such was his name to his equals) found a melancholy satisfaction in the
  phenomena, for these conditions of unease usually preceded some flashing
  inspiration. It was as though Nature in her mysterious way ordained that
  Bones should only put forth his finest efforts after some (to him) tremendous
  ordeal. Such a tinge of irritation came to Bones one sunny day in April, and
  at a moment when he had every reason to be perfectly happy. The mail had
  brought to him a diploma which certified to his proficiency as an accountant.
  He had been elected a Fellow of the Society of Accountancy (Wabash), as a
  result of a course of correspondence lessons conducted by The College of
  Practical and Theoretical Accountancy (also of Wabash, U.S.A.).</p>

  <p>His half-yearly inspection had passed off magnificently, with the trifling
  exception that his books were out of order and that the sum of three pounds
  one shilling had in some mysterious fashion crept into the credit column. But
  this was instantly rectified by the discovery that he had added the day of
  the month. Bones invariably did this. Generally he added the year. Sometimes
  he was &pound;192 1<i>s</i>. short. Sometimes he had &pound;19 2<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>.
  surplus. Sanders had praised some work of his; his immediate superior,
  Captain Hamilton, had been unusually gracious. And Bones was unhappy.</p>

  <p>There was, in truth, an excellent reason. Bones was one of those
  uncomfortable people who take a passionate interest in every phase of human
  activity that happens outside their own especial orbit of duty. He was an
  officer of Houssas. He enjoyed an allowance from a wealthy uncle, he was
  living the kind of life he would have chosen of all others, and yet Bones was
  constantly striving toward perfection in professions which had nothing
  whatever to do with soldiering. He &ldquo;took up&rdquo; almost every branch
  of study that was offered to him through the advertisement pages of the
  magazines. He learnt elocution, public speaking, newspaper illustration,
  short-story writing, motor-car construction, law, motion-picture production,
  engineering, and the after-care of babies, through the medium of weekly
  <i>questionnaires</i> and test sheets, though without possessing the
  slightest aptitude for the practice of a single calling which he so
  assiduously studied.</p>

  <p>And he read. He read the Hundred Best Books and Egyptian History and John
  Stuart Mill, and books on Inductive and Deductive Logic, and Works of Travel
  and Sociology. If he did not actually read them he bought them. Sometimes he
  read nearly through the first chapter, but generally he read the introduction
  and put the book away to be read some day &ldquo;when I can give my mind to
  it.&rdquo; That day never dawned. Possibly the introductions were sufficient
  to assure him that they were books he did not wish to know.</p>

  <p>Bones was passing through a phase of intellectual development when the
  inequalities of life were all too apparent. He grieved for his fellow-men. He
  despised wealth and spoke glibly and contemptuously of capitalism. But for
  Florence, his life would have been intolerable. Florence was the property of
  Captain Hamilton. She was a hen, and she was of the Plymouth Rock variety.
  From her chickhood she had conceived a violent affection for Bones, and
  Bones, to whom all living things had a soul, had returned her love.</p>

  <p>There was an embarrassing side to the friendship, for Florence followed
  him like a pet dog, and invariably inspected the guard behind him. And the
  Houssa has a very keen sense of humour.</p>

  <p>Yet even Florence did not wholly compensate for the social conditions
  which were revealed to Bones from week to week in the pages of a fiery
  periodical which came to him. Bones grew careless in his attire, and
  addressed Abiboo, his sergeant, as &ldquo;Comrade,&rdquo; Which Sergeant
  Abiboo reported to Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is clear that the young lord Tibbett has fever,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;for this morning he spoke to me as if he were a common man, and said
  that all men were equal. Even sergeants with privates. Also he said that the
  land did not belong to Government, but to me and to his lordship. This I
  report officially.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Finding no traces of fever, Hamilton had given his subordinate three large
  pills, Bones protesting.</p>

  <p>Summoned to the residency, he heard of his projected trip without
  enthusiasm. Ordinarily the prospect of assuming control of the <i>Wiggle</i>
  would have brought him to a high pitch of ecstasy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir an&rsquo; excellency,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go because it is my duty. I have a premonition that I may
  not come back, instinct, my dear old Ham&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always been like
  that. I&rsquo;m physic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Psychic&rsquo; is the word you want,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We always call it &lsquo;Physic,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Bones calmly,
  &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s spelt, dear old comrade and O.C.
  Troops. If a johnny is physic, surely to good gracious heavens he know how
  it&rsquo;s spelt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you a premonition of, Bones?&rdquo; asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bones made a grimace, lifted his angular shoulders and threw out his
  hands&mdash;gestures indicating his inability to give a plain answer to a
  plain question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not wishing to cast a dark old shadow or be jolly old killjoy,
  I&rsquo;d rather not say,&rdquo; he replied darkly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve had
  this feeling, comrade&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little less &lsquo;comrade&rsquo; would be welcome,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all comrades, dear old officer,&rdquo; said Bones
  gloomily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our jolly old social values mixed up. The
  condition of society with its naughty old artificial restrictions is
  positively ghastly. It is indeed, old Ham. Sweinmacher says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What Sweinmacher or any other Dutch trader says is
  immaterial,&rdquo; said Hamilton. &ldquo;You go to the Isisi this afternoon.
  And if your premonition comes off I&rsquo;ll write the nicest little obituary
  notice you&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones inclined his head gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already written
  it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it in my desk, dear old
  com-officer. You might send it to the <i>Times</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
  subscribed to that jolly old Thunderer for years, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be
  glad to put it in. About 20,000 words as near as I can judge, but if
  you&rsquo;d like to add anything to it, I&rsquo;ll take it as a
  kindness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders came down to see his subordinate leave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;N&rsquo;shimba you will deal with firmly. As yet he is not
  dangerous. These fellows hold tight to tradition, and until the arrival of
  the black egg&mdash;and the spies say he has been searching for
  it&mdash;there will be no general rising. If necessary, kill N&rsquo;shimba.
  You&rsquo;re not taking Florence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Florence was perched on the rail of the boat, a brooding, sleepy figure.
  Undisturbed, she remained when the <i>Wiggle</i> cast off and pushed its
  blunt nose to the rapid waters of the big river.</p>

  <p>Bones passed the Isisi country according to plan, and his first call was
  upon Bosambo, Paramount Chief of the Ochori, and thorn in the side of all
  kings, chiefs and headmen of the Isisi, Akasava and N&rsquo;gombi. As well he
  might be, for he was a Krooman by birth, adventurer by instinct, and a great
  collector of other men&rsquo;s property by choice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you one time: I looka you longa longa times, Bonesi. You be
  good fellow.&rdquo; Thus Bosambo in English, for he had been educated in an
  English mission school.</p>

  <p>Bones struggled hard against resenting the familiarity. Tactfully, he
  replied in Bomongo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sandi has sent me to speak with your young men, Bosambo, for
  Sandi&rsquo;s heart is troubled because of this secret society.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Bosambo calmly, &ldquo;there is no secret society
  in this land. When the older men join together in dances and call themselves
  by ghostly names, I say no word, for old men are great talkers and nothing
  comes of that. But when my young men meet in secrecy, then I know that they
  will talk scandal. And what is scandalous here in the Ochori but taxation and
  the punishment I give to evil men? These Young Hearts spoke of me badly, and
  this I discovered. Now the Young Hearts are not in the Ochori,&rdquo; he
  added significantly.</p>

  <p>Bones considered the matter, scratching his nose. &ldquo;Bosambo, in this
  land all men are equal,&rdquo; he said, and the big chief regarded him
  dispassionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, all men are equal who are equal to one another,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;But no man is equal to me, for I am the chief king of the
  Ochori. And I am not equal to you, Tibbetti, nor you to Sandi. If you are
  equal to Sandi, speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones modestly refrained, and the big man went on:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is right that I should be over the Ochori,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;for some one must stand high above the people, or he would not see
  them well. When there are ten thousand goats upon the plain, what does any
  goat see but the goat that is next to him? And how may he know what happens
  on the edge of the flock, where the leopards come crawling and
  creeping?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All men&mdash;&rdquo; began Bones again, but thought better of it.
  Bosambo was not a man who would be readily convinced.</p>

  <p>He secured a certain amount of information about the Young
  Hearts&mdash;information which Bosambo had taken the most drastic measures to
  procure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are of the Isisi,&rdquo; said Bosambo, &ldquo;and this king of
  the Isisi is no man, but a cow. For he sits down and hears these boys speak,
  and does not beat them. You go to the Isisi, lord?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones went on his way, and his host watched by the river-side, until the
  white hull of the little <i>Wiggle</i> had disappeared round a woody
  headland. Then Bosambo returned to his hut and to his wife, who was also his
  counsellor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Light of my life,&rdquo; she said in the Arabic of the coast,
  &ldquo;Tibbetti has been in many terrible places, but I think the Isisi
  country will be worse for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In two nights and a day Bones came to the Isisi city, and was received in
  state by the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I know nothing of the Young Hearts,&rdquo; said Bugulu
  nervously. &ldquo;The folly of children is not for me and my wise old men,
  but for their parents. As to N&rsquo;shimba, what is he but a
  child?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones did not attempt to supply an answer to his question. He had not
  failed to notice, in his walk through the widely scattered city of the king,
  that, which ever way he looked, he saw no young men, There were those who
  were old squatting at the fires, and women of all ages going about their
  proper business, He called the attention of Bugulu to this fact, and the king
  grew more miserable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, they have gone to a palaver in the deep forest,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;For these night-talk-people must hold palavers at all
  times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones hesitated, and then, accompanied by the king, walked down the broad
  main street of the city. He stopped at the first hut, where an old woman was
  crushing meal, and spoke to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you are the mother of sons.
  Now tell me where your fine son is, that I may speak to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She glanced from Bones to the king, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, he is gone to make a palaver in the deep forest,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is your son?&rdquo; asked Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Master, he is a fisherman and is very stout.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones listened to the recital of the young man&rsquo;s virtues, and then
  asked:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me his shield and his spear, that I may see them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman looked at the king and at Bones, then turned her eyes away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, he has taken his shield and his spear with him, for there is
  game in the deep forest, and leopards that are terribly fierce,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>Apparently, every other young man who had departed out from the Isisi city
  had also gone in the expectation of meeting terrible leopards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These young men say fearful things, Tibbetti,&rdquo; said the old
  man, troubled. &ldquo;My own son, who desires to be chief in my place,
  brought word that you spoke his mind, and that in your heart you were against
  all chiefs and kings, and the young men believe him. Also that all that is
  mine is all men&rsquo;s. And that my goats belong to the village and my
  gardens to every mean man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious heavens alive!&rdquo; said Bones, aghast, and for the
  first time there loomed before his eyes a vision of that vast barrier which
  stands between Utopia and the everyday world.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Also, lord, they say that men are all as one, as N&rsquo;shimba the
  Great also said <i>cala cala.</i> And that the young shall rule the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said Bones, but as he spoke in
  English the chief thought he was swearing.</p>

  <p>Bones went back to the <i>Wiggle,</i> and his first act was to cast into
  the swift black waters of the river a learned treatise on equality by a
  Russian philosopher who had never met cannibals who believed in ghosts. The
  book was instantly pouched by a waiting and hungry crocodile, who, perhaps,
  was best competent to digest it.</p>

  <p>Then Bones strapped a Browning to each hip and called Sergeant Ali Ahmed
  to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahmed, I go to make a palaver with the young men of the
  Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord comrade&mdash;&rdquo; began the misguided Ahmed, and Bones
  showed all his teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you call me comrade, I will beat the soles of your feet until
  they are sore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want four men who can shoot, and four
  to carry the little gun that says &lsquo;ha-ha.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ahmed saluted and went to parade the men.</p>

  <p>An hour&rsquo;s walking along the narrow forest path brought Bones to a
  clearing where the ground dipped to form an amphitheatre. N&rsquo;shimba was
  waiting for him, for news had been brought of his coming. Tail and lank, his
  body covered with a close-fitting garment of leopard-skin&mdash;the wearing
  of which was a prerogative of chiefs&mdash;N&rsquo;shimba the inspired leant
  upon his long spear and watched the khaki figure moving slowly toward
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, Tibbetti,&rdquo; he called, but did not raise his hand
  in salute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, N&rsquo;shimba,&rdquo; returned Bones, &ldquo;and I have
  come to talk to you, because of certain things which have come to the ears of
  my lord Sandi. For they say you have a society of Young Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They speak true,&rdquo; said N&rsquo;shimba insolently. &ldquo;And
  I, N&rsquo;shimba N&rsquo;shamba, am their chief and greater than all chiefs.
  For I have been called by ghosts and devils to make the Isisi a free people.
  And I shall be the highest in the land, as the great N&rsquo;shimba was
  before me, for his spirit is in my belly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To his amazement, Bones was neither excited nor showed any visible signs
  of annoyance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is good talk,&rdquo; said Bones, &ldquo;Yet those wise men I
  meet say that the soul of the great N&rsquo;shimba comes from a black egg.
  Tell me, man, have you found that egg?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>N&rsquo;shimba shuffled uneasily. &ldquo;That will come, Tibbetti, when I
  have proved my greatness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take me to your Young Hearts,&rdquo; said Bones.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, and with an apprehensive glance at the soldiers,
  N&rsquo;shimba led him to the amphitheatre, which now Bones saw for the first
  time. The slopes of the hollow were black with men, black dappled yellow
  where the oval shields showed, black which glittered at a thousand points
  where the sunlight caught the polished heads of the spears. And Bones,
  without preamble, spoke, and by his side the red-tarboshed soldiers fixed the
  tripod of the Maxim.</p>

  <p>Bones spoke the Bomongo tongue as fluently as a native. He had at his
  command a range of native imagery which covered all things growing and
  living. And he talked rapidly and convincingly on the laws of property, and
  the right of men to eminence. They listened in silence, N&rsquo;shimba
  scowling.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, they allowed him to go without molestation, Bones in
  triumph sent a message by pigeon to head-quarters.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;SETTLED ISISI PERLARVER. TALKED THEM SILY.
  KNOCKKED IDEAS OUT OF THEIR JOLY OLD CRAYNIUMS.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Bones had never been strong on spelling.</p>

  <p>He had sent the message when Ahmed came to him with news and something in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, whilst you made palaver with these boys, the chik-chik sought
  you in the village, and this came in the very street before the king&rsquo;s
  house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones looked at the egg in the man&rsquo;s hand and jumped up, his eyes
  bulging.</p>

  <p>It was jet black!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Moses!&rdquo; he gasped, and then, in Arabic: &ldquo;Who saw
  this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All people, and they were frightened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Bones, and turned reproachful eyes upon Florence,
  who was balancing herself on the back of a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a naughty, naughty girl!&rdquo; said Bones.
  &ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Florence made the noise which, in all well-regulated chickens, is the
  equivalent to a purr.</p>

  <p>An hour later came N&rsquo;shimba.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he sad respectfully, &ldquo;there is talk of a
  wonderful black egg. Now give this to me, and I will be strong for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, I am strength itself&rdquo; said Bones quietly. &ldquo;As to a
  black egg, I know of none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>N&rsquo;shimba went away without protesting further.</p>

  <p>At three o&rsquo;clock, in the dead of the night, the sentry on duty on
  the <i>Wiggle</i> saw a figure crawling stealthily along the deck plank, and
  shot at it without warning. Bones, running out of his cabin, saw a dead man
  lying in the light of Sergeant Ahmet&rsquo;s lantern, and the knife clenched
  between the bared teeth told its own story.</p>

  <p>With four men he reached the village. Happily, he had not gone far before
  the Young Hearts&rsquo; attack was launched. Fighting his way back to the
  river, Bones cast off the two steel hawsers as the forerunners of the Young
  Hearts reached the beach. The <i>Wiggle</i> possessed no searchlight, but she
  carried two Maxim guns, and they sprayed the beach industriously.</p>

  <p>In midstream he anchored whilst steam was being raised, and at dawn came a
  solitary canoe, paddled by a trembling man, who handed up something in a
  native sack, something that was heavy and wet. Bones guessed the contents
  before the dead face of the king Bugulu stared up at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, who sent this?&rdquo; he asked the shivering messenger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, it was N&rsquo;shimba,&rdquo; said the man, his teeth
  chattering. &ldquo;Also, he spoke to me thus &rsquo;Say to Tibbetti, that I
  am N&rsquo;shimba, King of the Isisi and of the Akasava, and of all the
  peoples of the mountains, and the highest man in all the land. Bring me the
  black egg and you shall live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones did not hesitate. &ldquo;I go with you,&rdquo; he said, for he knew
  that the Isisi were night fighters, and that no man would lift spear to him
  in the open day.</p>

  <p>He went ashore. The body of the old king lay stark in the village street,
  and Bones saw a dead woman lying where she had been speared, and two old men
  whose age had been an offence.</p>

  <p>No man hindered him as he walked slowly to the new king&rsquo;s hut, but
  the silence was ominous, and, to Bones, menacing. Before the old king&rsquo;s
  hut sat N&rsquo;shimba, the medal of kingship about his neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, white man; give me my pretty egg and you shall
  live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones took something from his pocket and put it in the new king&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;N&rsquo;shimba, by magic this thing was born, and it is an egg like
  none other I have ever seen. Hold it fast, king, and presently your devil
  shall come out and speak to you, but I must not be here nor any
  other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>N&rsquo;shimba nodded gravely. &ldquo;Let this man go,&rdquo; he said, and
  Bones walked quickly down the village Street.</p>

  <p>His foot was in the waiting canoe when he heard the harsh sound of the
  explosion.</p>

  <p>The devil in the black egg had spoken as only a devil can speak when the
  incautious N&rsquo;shimba released his grip of the Mills&rsquo; bomb which
  Bones had pressed into his hand.</p>

     id="story04">IV. &mdash; A NICE GEL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Jan
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">BECAUSE Terence Doughty was possessed of an immense fortune,
  was unmarried, and had neither sister <i>nor</i> brother, it was a delicate
  matter to chide him, At least, so thought his aunts and cousins and other
  likely beneficiaries of his will.</p>

  <p>He was thirty, a little pompous in a reserved way, exceedingly
  good-looking, and learned in such a terrifying degree that ordinary people
  cleared their throats before they so much as remarked to him that it was a
  fine day.</p>

  <p>He had written a text-book on Arabic, and he spoke most modern languages.
  It was a chance reference to the irregular Bomongo verbs, that he read in
  <i>Notes and Queries,</i> that decided him upon taking up the study of native
  dialects, It happened that there was in London at that time (on sick leave) a
  missionary from the great river, and from this gentleman Terence learnt, with
  his usual facility, enough of the language to induce in him a desire for an
  even further acquaintance.</p>

  <p>He announced his scheme to the one aunt who did not stand in awe of the
  bachelor-millionaire-scientist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard such
  nonsense! The idea of going into Central Africa to learn verbs! You&rsquo;re
  either a <i>poseur</i> or a fool, Terence. You had much better find a nice
  gel and settle down in England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Doughty shuddered. &ldquo;Gel&rdquo; always made him shudder.
  &ldquo;My dear aunt! Nice gel!&rdquo; he mimicked, &ldquo;I have been looking
  for that nice gel these ten years! Unfortunately I am cursed with the
  possession of ideals. These ladies you and the rest of the family have been
  good enough to choose for me&mdash;my God! They are dreadful! There
  isn&rsquo;t one that doesn&rsquo;t shock all the aestheticism in
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of gel do you want?&rdquo; asked Lady Morestel,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>Lying back in his deep chair, his eyes half closed, his finger-tips
  touching, Mr. Terence Doughty enumerated the desirable qualities.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She must be pretty, of course, that kind of delicate, spiritual
  prettiness that gives to a woman her most precious mystery. She must be
  intellectual, yet womanly, in a wistful way. I must be able to love her mind.
  Refinement of speech and thought, impregnability of ideals&mdash;these are
  amongst the qualities that I seek but do not find.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find them in Africa,&rdquo; said her ladyship
  grimly, and Terence smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be looking for verbs in Africa,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Two months later, Terence Doughty poised himself on the gunwale of the
  surf boat, his hand upon the bare, brown shoulder of a rower, and, watching
  his opportunity, jumped almost dry-footed to the yellow sands. One of the
  crew threw a new suitcase after him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Terence.</p>

  <p>He was tall and fairly athletic, his face was thin and tanned, his
  appearance suggested the patronage of a good colonial tailor. Stopping only
  to light a cigarette, then picking up his grip, he walked toward the
  residency. Sanders came to meet him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Doughty,&rdquo; he said, and Doughty lifted his helmet.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you hate my coming, sir,&rdquo; he said,
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a bad reputation along the coast,&rdquo; smiled Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders, &ldquo;and I suppose it is justified. I do not like
  traders, and I am not, as a rule, enthusiastic about scientific
  explorers.&rdquo; He walked by the side of the visitor. &ldquo;What is your
  itinerary?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I intend going up as far as the Akasava country, then, striking
  across the French territory to the Congo, follow the river as far as Stanley
  Falls. After I reach Stanley Falls I shall decide whether I go by rail to
  Tanganyika and on to Rhodesia, or whether I push across Uganda to the sea.
  There is one point on which I wanted to speak to you, Mr. Sanders, and it is
  this: I have no time-table, I am moving at my leisure, and it is likely that
  I shall stop over in certain villages for months at a time. So that if I
  disappear, I hope I shall not give you any uneasiness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said Sanders promptly. &ldquo;I do not think there
  is any danger, for the tribes are very quiet just now, but in this land
  &rsquo;to-morrow is a different day,&rsquo; as the saying goes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Doughty was introduced to Hamilton of the Houssas, and to Lieutenant
  Tibbetts, whose other name was Bones, and whilst tiffin was in course of
  preparation he went down to the quay to examine his heavy baggage that had
  come on before him, and to try his missionary Bomongo upon the crew of the
  big canoe which had come down from the Akasava country to take him up
  river.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deuced nice fellow,&rdquo; said Bones thoughtfully.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wished, as you&rsquo;ll bear witness, dear old
  officer, to make a complete study of these jolly old verbs&mdash;what about
  sending me up with the doughty old Doughty to look after him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say this for you, Bones,&rdquo; said Hamilton,
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re never at a loss to find an excuse for loafing. You stay
  here and study the jolly old verbs and the pay-roll and the stores account.
  And you might give the men a few days&rsquo; field exercise; they&rsquo;re
  slacking fearfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones sighed and abandoned his dream.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Terence Doughty went alone, and after a month&rsquo;s idling along
  the river, came in the dark of an evening to a beach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will sleep here to-night,&rdquo; he said, and the headman of the
  boat grew unexpectedly agitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, we will go on to the city, which we shall reach by the
  morning. For though my strong paddlers are tired, they will be
  happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not here?&rdquo; asked Terence in surprise.</p>

  <p>The man tapped his teeth with his knuckles, &ldquo;Lord, this is a magic
  place. For here is the Tree of the World, and devils live in abundance, so
  that you cannot walk without treading on their tails. Now let us go on, for
  my men have fear in their stomachs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Land me alone and my little tent,&rdquo; said Terence, now
  thoroughly interested. &ldquo;In the morning come for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went ashore on the flat beach and watched the hurried and fearful
  erection of his tent. They lit a fire for him (all in frantic haste) and
  paddled away.</p>

  <p>Terence had brewed himself a cup of tea and was preparing a meal of canned
  chicken breast and biscuit, when, raising his eyes suddenly, he saw, standing
  in the light of the fire, a slim figure. For a second he was startled, and
  then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am M&rsquo;mina of The Tree,&rdquo; said the girl simply,
  &ldquo;and I am a great friend of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O woman, sit with me and eat,&rdquo; said Terence, and she
  obeyed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is a tree in the Forest of Happy Dreams, which is in
  the Akasava country, that has stood from the beginning of time. It is the
  Tree of the World, and floated in the waters which, according to legend that
  is so splendidly confirmed by the Jeano-men, was the beginning of all
  substance. And to the bare roots of the tree came earth, and more earth, and
  rocks to keep the earth in its place, and mountains to hold the rocks, and so
  the world was made. It is a cedar of enormous height, which in itself is
  miraculous, for no other cedars grow in the Akasava. Its branches spread
  amazingly. Beneath, you may see the rotting stumps of other trees which in
  the course of hundreds of years have been cut down that the Tree of the World
  might grow. Some day, so the legend runs, that tree will wither, and on that
  day the world will begin to go back to the water. First the mountains will
  crumble and fall into the great river; then the rocks will go to dust, and
  lastly the earth will dissolve into water and there will be no more
  earth.</p>

  <p>Near by the tree, in a large hut, lived Ogonobo, the Keeper of the Tree, a
  wise old man, reputedly friend of devils and in the fellowship of ju-jus.</p>

  <p>So potent was the mystery of Ogonobo that even M&rsquo;shimba
  M&rsquo;shamba, most ruthless and disrespectful of all great spirits, spared
  his house on the night of the great wind, when villages and cities were
  levelled and great gum-trees were plucked up by the roots as though they were
  corn-stalks.</p>

  <p>Yet for all his magic and aloofness, Ogonobo was no ascetic. He had taken
  to himself many wives, and each he had put away because none bore him
  children. Then he found a fisher girl of no great account and took her into
  his hut, and she gave him M&rsquo;mina, a straight-backed, grave-eyed
  daughter. Some say one thing and some say another about this miracle of a
  daughter who came to Ogonobo in his old age. Such is the Akasava love for
  scandal. That his wife had many lovers is true, but what woman of the Akasava
  is without lovers? Do they not say, &ldquo;This day I have married a woman
  who has three husbands&rdquo; at every wedding feast? Be that as it may,
  M&rsquo;mina was a fact, and when old Ogonobo sold his wife to a petty chief,
  this M&rsquo;mina became the supreme woman of his house, tended his small
  garden, crushed his corn and cooked for him.</p>

  <p>Such men as saw her, hunters who strayed into the ghost forest led by
  their quarry, feared her. One brought a story that he had seen M&rsquo;mina
  sitting on the ground surrounded by thousands of parrots that squawked and
  chattered to her. And another had seen her in the company of many little
  birds that came to her when she whistled. It is certain that M&rsquo;mina was
  a great charmer of birds, and at her whistle even the fierce hawks stooped
  and came with a beating of wings to her feet. This was her own peculiar
  magic.</p>

  <p>Incidentally the spirit of the forest came to her, and she communed with
  devils. One day she came to the old man, her father, and told him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ogonobo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I saw a little yellow devil
  sitting under the Tree of the World. He had red eyes, and from his knees grew
  two hands that pinched me as I passed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ogonobo said nothing. He took a long and pliant length of hippo-hide, and
  he flogged her until he could flog her no more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;see no more devils.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;mina went through the days that followed as though nothing had
  happened. She slept in a small hut at the back of her father&rsquo;s house,
  and one night, having a pain in his head, he went to call her that she might
  boil water for him. She was not on her bed, and, spying, he saw her slip from
  the forest in the dawn hour and go straight to her hut. He watched her three
  nights in succession, and every night she went away into the forest and came
  back with the dawn.</p>

  <p>Then he spoke to her. &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you have a
  lover, let him come to me. But if you go in the night to speak to devils,
  that is bad. For a lover can give you nothing but life, but devils bring
  trouble. Tell me now, M&rsquo;mina, which is true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I go to see devils and one who is greater than all. For he
  lives in a tree and fire comes from his eyes when he speaks, and one day he
  will take me into his hut and we shall be happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ogonobo went in search of his thong, and this time the flogging was
  severe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall bring no sons of devils into my house, woman,&rdquo; said
  Ogonobo breathlessly, for he was an old man.</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;mina got up from the floor, rubbing her whealed thighs. Her dark,
  grave eyes searched the old man&rsquo;s face, and she said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This night your arm shall die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This day my arm is strong,&rdquo; said Ogonobo, and thrashed her
  again. In this primitive manner did he wage war against the illusions which
  solitude and a too prolonged austerity might bring to an imaginative
  mind.</p>

  <p>He was sitting before his hut eating his dinner as the sun was setting,
  and M&rsquo;mina was crushing corn in a big stone pestle. As the sun touched
  the trees, the bowl fell from Ogonobo&rsquo;s hand, and when he tried to pick
  it up his right arm refused to obey. From shoulder to finger-tip he was
  paralysed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman, come here,&rdquo; he said, and the girl obeyed, standing
  before him, silent and watchful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My arm is dead, as you promised. Now I see that you are a great
  witch, and I am afraid. Touch my arm and make it well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As she bent down to perform this service, his well hand shot out, and he
  caught her swiftly by the throat and threw her backward over his knees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is better that I have one arm than none,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;or no arms than that I be dead. I am too old to live in fear of death;
  therefore, M&rsquo;mina, my daughter, you go quickly to the Place of
  Ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She lay unstruggling as the pressure of his sinewy fingers increased, and
  when it seemed to him that she was resigned to death, with a strength that he
  had not guessed, she flung herself free from him and fled into the hut. He
  rose a little awkwardly and followed. As he stooped to enter the low door,
  she struck at him twice with the long handled N&rsquo;gombi axe that he kept
  to trim away the tree. Ogonobo coughed thickly and went down on to his knees,
  clutching with his one hand at the doorway&rsquo;s edge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;mina, and brought the keen edge to his
  unprotected neck with all her power...</p>

  <p>When she had buried him and had cleaned away the mess, she went back to
  her corn, and, carrying the pestle into the hut, lay down on her bed and
  slept. And she sat in Ogonobo&rsquo;s place and said magic words to the tree,
  and held communion with ghosts of all colours.</p>

  <p>One day she went on a journey into the city of the king and stood before
  his house, and Ofaba, the king, who had heard of her, came out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, M&rsquo;mina, daughter of Ogonobo, the Keeper of the
  Tree. Where is your father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, he is dead, and his mystery is mine. And I sit in the Forest
  of Dreams and many pleasant devils make love to me. One I shall marry soon,
  and on that night M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba shall come to my hut and sing
  my marriage song.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ofaba shivered and spat. &ldquo;How did Ogonobo die, woman?&rdquo; he
  asked. &ldquo;One of my young men when hunting saw blood on the
  leaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A devil killed him with a great axe that was bigger than the Tree
  of the World. And I fought with the devil by my magic, and he is dead too.
  And I cut him into pieces, and one of his legs I threw into the Little River,
  and it overflowed, as all men know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That the Little River had overflown Ofaba knew. The rains had been heavy,
  but the Little River had never overflown before. Here, then, was an
  explanation more in harmony with Ofaba&rsquo;s known predilection for the
  mysterious and the magical.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This I came to tell you, lord,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Also that I
  had a dream, and in this dream I saw Bosambo of the Ochori, who was on his
  knees before you, Ofaba, and you put your foot on his neck, and said
  &lsquo;Wa,&rsquo; and Bosambo shook with fear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ofaba himself trembled with something that was not fear, for she had
  dreamt his dream. This he did not tell her, sending her away with presents,
  and by certain wonderful acts confirming her in her office.</p>

  <p>It is a saying in the Akasava country, that the child of the eaten moon is
  a great glutton, and Ofaba M&rsquo;lama, the son of B&rsquo;suri, King of the
  Akasava and paramount lord of the Ten Little Rivers, was so born. For the
  moon was at its last quarter when he came squealing into the world, and
  B&rsquo;suri, looking up at the fading crescent, said, having a
  grievance:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This child will eat. Let him eat the Ochori,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A wise saying, so frequently repeated to Ofaba, long after he had taken
  B&rsquo;suri&rsquo;s stool of office and his great silver medal of
  chieftainship; long after B&rsquo;suri had been paddled stark to the middle
  island where dead men lie in shallow graves.</p>

  <p>Ofaba needed little to remind him that the Akasava hated the Ochori,
  because that was traditional. <i>Cala cala,</i> which means &ldquo;Years
  ago,&rdquo; the Ochori had been the slave tribe, a debased and fearful people
  who, at the first hint of danger, ran away into the woods with their wives
  and children and such goats as they could grab. Sometimes they left their
  wives behind, but there is no record of their having gone entirely
  goatless.</p>

  <p>So it was that, what any nation needed, they took from the Ochori, and if
  the taking was bloodless, no strong word went down to the ear of Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders, who sat between sea and river in a large thatched house
  and gave judgment impartially. But there came to the Ochori a certain man
  from the Kroo Coast, an escaped convict, one Bosambo, who, by the employment
  of questionable methods, had secured his election to the kingship. And with
  his coming there had arisen a new spirit in the Ochori, so that when the
  Akasava or the Isisi raided their lands, they were met by locked shields and
  a phalanx of spears, and there was a killing or two.</p>

  <p>Ofaba was now a man of twenty-three, and in the year when M&rsquo;mina
  became the Keeper of the Tree, the harvests of the Akasava failed, for no
  especial or understandable reason. Ofaba and his wise men gathered in secret
  council, and in the dark hours of the night they took from his bed a youth
  who was silly with sleeping sickness, and, carrying him into the woods, they
  cut his throat with the razor edge of Ofaba&rsquo;s hunting spear, and
  sprinkled his blood on that old and sacred tree which had stood from the
  beginning of time.</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;mina watched the ceremony from the door of her hut, and when it
  was over came forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, Ofaba, also this man whom you have killed because your
  crops have failed. Now, I have talked with my husband, who comes to me every
  night in the shape of a bat, and he says that the crops have failed because
  of Bosambo, the chief man of the Ochori. That day you bring him to me, that
  day shall the crops grow and the game come back to the forest. For I will
  make a great magic with Bosambo that will be wonderful to see. You shall make
  an end to Bosambo, as I have made to his spies. Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bewildered, the king followed her through the dark forest and came to the
  beach. Here, hidden by bushes, were three graves. &ldquo;O woman!&rdquo; he
  gasped. &ldquo;What evil have you done? For if Sandi knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall Sandi know the blooding of the tree?&rdquo; she asked
  significantly, and Ofaba sweated. &ldquo;Now, I tell you that when Bosambo
  himself comes, as he will, you shall bring him here. And you shall be
  happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">AT head-quarters, Mr. Commissioner Sanders was in a
  peculiarly complacent frame of mind. For two months there had been no sign or
  sound of trouble in his territory. Mr. Terence Doughty, that fastidious
  grammarian, had passed to the French territory (Bosambo had sent a long
  message by Pigeon post announcing his passage); the crops, with the exception
  of the Akasava mealie crop, had been good. Taxation was being voluntarily
  liquidated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact, everything is almost too good to be true,&rdquo; he said
  one evening as they sat in the cool of the verandah.</p>

  <p>That night he was wakened from a sound sleep by a hullaballoo that brought
  him to the open, revolver in hand. A knot of men were struggling noisily
  somewhere in the darkness, and Hamilton, who joined him, offered an
  explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of my infernal Houssas,&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;Where these
  devils get gin from, heaven knows&mdash;Bones!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones answered from the darkness. &ldquo;Naughty old thief trying to get
  into the residency, Ham, old thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Five minutes later a dishevelled Bones in pyjamas and mosquito boots came
  to report.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chucked him in the guard-room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By gad, if I
  hadn&rsquo;t seen him you might have been robbed, dear old
  excellency&mdash;murdered, dear old Ham. If this isn&rsquo;t worth a special
  report and a D.S.O., then there&rsquo;s no justice on this wicked old
  earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you spot him?&rdquo; asked Hamilton incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly spot him, sir and brother officer,&rdquo;
  said Bones with care. &ldquo;In theory I did, old captain. Ahmet saw him
  sneaking across the square, and of course I was on the spot in two shakes of
  a duck&rsquo;s jolly old rudder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sergeant Ahmet supplemented the information. He had seen the marauder and
  had leapt at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When we wakened my lord Tibbetti, he ordered the bad man to
  prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;&rsquo;wakened&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded Bones
  indignantly. &ldquo;O Ahmet, was I not there&mdash;did I
  not&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why ask this unfortunate man to perjure himself?&rdquo; demanded
  Hamilton, &ldquo;Go back to bed, Phyllis; you&rsquo;re losing your beauty
  sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The buglers were sounding reveille, and the brown-legged guard stood
  rigidly before the guardhouse, their rifles at the slope, their
  expressionless brown faces strained and intense, looking at nothingness.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, in khaki, a long sword slapping at his leg, stalked
  over from his hut, his helmet tilted over one eye in the fashion set by a
  remarkable admiral, and coming to a halt before the guard, glared at the four
  inoffensive soldiers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The guard is present, lord,&rdquo; said the sergeant in his queer,
  guttural Arabic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let it be dismissed, Ahmet,&rdquo; said Bones. &ldquo;Now bring me
  the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There came, blinking into the light from the dark prison hut, a man, at
  the sight of whom Lieutenant Tibbetts&rsquo; jaw dropped&mdash;and it took a
  lot (as Bones often said) to surprise him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosambo!&rdquo; he squeaked in English. &ldquo;Goodness gracious
  heavens alive, well I&rsquo;m dashed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The big man grinned sheepishly. &ldquo;I be damned, sah, too, one time. I
  make &rsquo;um foolish all time, Bonesi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so much of that Bonesi,&rdquo; said Bones severely. &ldquo;You
  naughty old reveller&mdash;you disgustin&rsquo; carousin&rsquo; old sinner.
  Really, really, Bosambo, I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed of
  yourself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo did not look particularly ashamed, although he, king and paramount
  chief of the Ochori, had suffered the indignity of spending a night in the
  guard-room, and had been carried there in the middle of the night by four
  stalwart Houssa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I no be drunken, Tibbetti,&rdquo; he began earnestly. &ldquo;I be
  good Matt&rsquo;ew Marki Luki Christian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Monkey talk,&rdquo; said Bones unpleasantly, and this time he spoke
  in Bomongo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Bosambo in that language, &ldquo;I came by night
  because of certain news which my spies brought to me, And because I came
  secretly, not wishing your lordship&rsquo;s soldiers to know me, I did not
  tell them who I was when they fell upon me as I crossed the square. And if I
  fought them, using terrible words, there was this reason, for I thought that
  in the night I could break away from the little prison and go my
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones went up to the residency, leaving the &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; in his
  own hut. Hamilton, shaving (in his pyjamas) on the verandah, saw the martial
  figure&mdash;he would have heard the slap of the sword any way&mdash;and
  suspended operations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Morning, Mars&mdash;is there a war on?&rdquo; he demanded,
  returning to his grimaces at the mirror and the manipulation of his safety
  razor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old officer, there are certain aspects of military service
  that no self-respecting old commander jests about,&rdquo; said Bones testily.
  &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t turned out in jolly old regimentals, you would have
  kicked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, did you court-martial and shoot the noisy devil?&rdquo; asked
  Hamilton. &ldquo;He woke Sanders&mdash;who was he and what was he doing?
  Abiboo said it was somebody trying to break into the residency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was Bosambo,&rdquo; said Bones, with dramatic emphasis.</p>

  <p>He was entitled to enjoy the sensation his words created.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bo&mdash;sambo? Bosh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones raised his eyebrows and closed his eyes. &ldquo;Very good, jolly old
  sir, I have done my duty: I can do no more,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosambo!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders stood in the doorway, and Bones saluted, &ldquo;Yes, excellency:
  Bosambo. I had a suspicion it was he last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said that you knew it was a Lower River fisherman who had got
  squareface,&rdquo; began Hamilton, but Sanders&rsquo; hand called for
  silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send him here, Bones,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Bosambo arrived, more self-possessed than Bones thought was decent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, it is true that it was I who came like a thief, desiring
  secret word with you,&rdquo; he said frankly, &ldquo;for this is a big thing
  that I had to tell, and my stomach was troubled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have brought me much news before,&rdquo; said Sanders sternly,
  &ldquo;yet you came in daylight and met me in palaver. Now you come like an
  Isisi robber, and my soldiers have shamed you, and therefore have shamed me
  and my king. Are there no grey birds or swift messengers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, there are all these,&rdquo; said Bosambo calmly. &ldquo;One
  grey pigeon came to me last week, and about his little red leg was a book*
  which said that I must not seek Dhoti any more, as he had gone a long journey
  into the Lower Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Letter.]</p>

  <p>Sanders sat up in his chair with a start. &ldquo;Man, what are you saying?
  I sent no message but about your taxation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo fumbled in his leopard-skin robe and took out a folded paper,
  handing it to the Commissioner without a word. Sanders read and frowned.
  &ldquo;I did not send this message,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As to Dhoti,"* he
  went into the Frenchi country two moons gone, and you sent me a book saying
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Doughty]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Bosambo, &ldquo;I sent no such book, nor have I
  seen Dhoti. And because of things I heard, I sent my spies into the Akasava
  and they did not come back. I myself would have gone, but my young and
  cunning listeners told me that Ofaba waited to seize me, and his canoes
  watched the river. So, lord, I came secretly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders fingered his chin, his face set and hard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get steam in the <i>Zaire,</i> Hamilton. I leave for the Upper
  River just as soon as you are ready. I shall want ten soldiers and a
  rope.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IN the deepest jungle of the Forest of Dreams, and in a
  secret place between two marshes was a hut, and stretched on a bed of skins
  before the door lay a young man. He was yellow of face, unshaven, gaunt. The
  fever which comes to white men in this forest of illusions was on him, and
  his teeth chattered dismally. Nevertheless, he smiled, and his eyes lit up as
  the girl came from a belt of trees, carrying in her arms a large and steaming
  pot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By jove, M&rsquo;mina, I am glad to see you,&rdquo; he said in
  English, as he reached out and took her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My husband and my lover,&rdquo; she murmured, fondling the thin
  fingers between her palms, &ldquo;I do not understand you when you speak with
  that tongue. I have brought you food, and I have spoken with the devils that
  you shall get well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Terence chuckled weakly. &ldquo;The grey birds have not come?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One will come soon&mdash;my spirit tells me,&rdquo; she said,
  squatting on the ground by the side of him.</p>

  <p>He dropped his arm on her shoulder and looked fondly down into the round
  and comely face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no woman like you in the world, M&rsquo;mina. You are the
  most wonderful of all. And I will take you across the black water, and you
  shall be a great lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I will stay here, and you also,&rdquo; she said calmly;
  &ldquo;for I knew when I saw you first, that you were the husband that the
  ghosts had whispered to me about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was looking at her raptly. &ldquo;O woman,&rdquo; he said in Bomongo,
  &ldquo;you are very beautiful.&rdquo; And then he stopped, for her eyes were
  searching the heavens. Suddenly she sprang up, and, pursing her lips, sent
  forth a long trill of melody. It was less a whistle than a high vocal note,
  and though it was not loud, the swift bird that was crossing the patch of sky
  checked, wheeled and came in narrowing circles lower and lower, till it
  dropped at her feet. She stooped, picked up the grey pigeon and smoothed its
  plumage. Then, with fingers deft with practice, she took the tissue paper
  that was fastened about the leg by a rubber band and gave it to the man.</p>

  <p>He peered down at the Arabic characters. &ldquo;It is from Sandi to
  Bosambo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he says all is well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded. &ldquo;Then this little bird may go,&rdquo; she answered;
  &ldquo;and my lord need not write any message to deceive the fat man of the
  Ochori. Lord, I fear this man, and have spoken with Ofaba that he may be
  killed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Terence Doughty fell back on his pillow and closed his eyes.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonderful girl,&rdquo; he murmured in English, and she
  tried to repeat the words. &ldquo;Clever girl...what a splendid mind you must
  have!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stooped and covered him with a skin rug, and then, at the sound of
  footsteps, she turned quickly. A lean man in white duck was crossing the
  clearing, and behind him she saw the glint of steel and the red tarbosh of
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Sandi,&rdquo; she greeted him without embarrassment, &ldquo;so
  you have found me and my husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And three little graves, M&rsquo;mina,&rdquo; said Sanders quietly.
  &ldquo;Now you shall answer to me for your life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You will not kill me, Sandi, because that is
  not your way. In all time you have never hanged any woman from the high tree,
  and I think I shall live, because I am well loved by certain devils and
  ghosts, and my ju-ju is strong for me. Also for this man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Terence was staring up at Sanders, a frown on his emaciated face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he said, a little resentfully. &ldquo;You know my
  wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know her very well,&rdquo; said Sanders softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope you didn&rsquo;t mind my fooling round with your
  messages,&rdquo; said Doughty. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve at last got the
  Bomongo word for...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His voice sank into a drowsy murmur. Mr. Terence Doughty did not wholly
  recover consciousness until he was half-way on the voyage to England, and
  then he woke as from a bad dream. In that dream there figured a strange and
  gracious figure, which he could not identify or remember. All his life, even
  when he was comfortably and respectably married, there hovered in the
  background of his mind the illusion of a greater happiness which he had once
  experienced.</p>

  <p>Sitting in the Village of Irons, in that portion reserved for the women
  who had worked evilly against the Government, M&rsquo;mina often said to her
  fellows in durance:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sandi has taken my man, but my soul and spirit and ghost is with
  him always, and my devil shall whisper in his ear: &rsquo;M&rsquo;mina waits
  for you in the Forest of Dreams.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Which in a sense was a perfectly true statement, though Terence Doughty
  would have been shocked if he could have identified the woman who flitted
  through his thoughts and was the foundation of many dreams...</p>

  <p>Once he woke with a cry, and his wife asked him if he was ill.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no...I was thinking...a nice gel...I wonder who she
  was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His wife smiled. She was wise enough never to probe into the past, but
  sometimes she wondered who that nice gel was.</p>

  <h2><a name="story05"
     id="story05">V. &mdash; THE BRASS BEDSTEAD</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Apr
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is no tribe on the river that has not its most secret
  mystery. In the course of the years, Mr. Commissioner Sanders had acquired a
  working knowledge of hundreds, yet was well aware that he had but touched the
  fringe of multitudes. For within every mystery is yet another. He knew that
  within the pods of a specie of wild pea there dwelt a beneficent spirit
  called &ldquo;Cha,&rdquo; that brought luck and prosperity, but that if the
  pea was split into four and given to four people, one would die within a
  moon, but he did not learn for years that if one of the four quarters
  remained green, there would be no fish in the river for the space of nine
  moons.</p>

  <p>Every plant and flowering tree had its peculiar familiar, good or bad, and
  once he had been brought a hundred and fifty miles to a great palaver, and
  all because a mealy stalk had produced only one cob&mdash;which was a sign of
  coming pestilence. Sometimes a peculiar potent would not appear at all and a
  hundred thousand men and women would sit and shiver their apprehension,
  whilst search parties would go forth and seek it.</p>

  <p>In the end Sanders evolved a formula. At head-quarters was a squat
  concrete house, built at the time of a serious war to store ammunition. The
  magazine was still employed for that purpose but Sanders found it a new use.
  It became a repository of ju-jus. When M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba (which
  is another name for a small typhoon) did not put in an appearance, and the
  Isisi and N&rsquo;gombi people met in solemn conclave to discuss what evil
  had been done that the great green spirit did not walk abroad, Sanders
  came.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear, for M&rsquo;shimba stays with me in my Ghost House,
  being very weary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the famous Tree of the World was uprooted in a storm and swept out of
  sight down the river, Sanders could reassure a trembling people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This great tree Is. It lives in my strange House of Ghosts, and
  none other shall see it. There it sits making good magic for the
  Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones came to be custodian of the Ghost House by natural processes.
  Finding that certain credit attached to the position, he claimed it for his
  own, and when the lower river folk lost their ju-ju (maliciously conveyed on
  to the <i>Zaire</i> by a native workman and concealed in the engine furnace)
  Bones assumed responsibility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This fine ju-ju came to my Ghost House, and there he lives, and
  every morning I speak to him and he speaks to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, we should like to see our beautiful ju-ju, for he was made
  wonderfully out of a magic tree by our fathers,&rdquo; said one of the
  troubled elders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Him you may see,&rdquo; said Bones significantly, &ldquo;but if you
  look upon the other ghosts who live with him, your eyes will fall
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They decided to leave the ju-ju to his tender care.</p>

  <p>The plan worked exceedingly well until Bosambo fell out with the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, Paramount Chief of the Ochori, best-eared of all chiefs, had an
  elementary but effective system of justice. For him no frontiers existed, no
  sovereignty was sacred, though he rigidly enforced the restrictions of
  frontier and the holiness of the Ochori territory upon others. There came
  into the forest land at the extreme southern edge of his land a party of
  Akasava huntsmen in search of game, and these with a lordly indifference to
  the inviolability of his territority, speared and shot without so much as
  &ldquo;by your leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were in search of the small monkeys with white whiskers, which are
  considered a delicacy by the epicureans of the Akasava, and are found nowhere
  else than in the southern Ochori. They are killed with arrows, to the heads
  of which a yard of native rope is attached. When the monkey is hit, the
  barbed arrow-head falls off, and the rope and shaft becoming entangled in the
  small branches of the trees in which the little people live, they are easily
  caught and despatched.</p>

  <p>Now the people of the Ochori do not eat monkeys. They capture them and
  train them into domestic pets, so that you cannot pass through an Ochori
  village without seeing little white-whiskered figures squatting contentedly
  on the roofs of the huts, engaged mainly in an everlasting hunt for
  fleas,</p>

  <p>Messengers brought news of the invasion, and Bosambo left hurriedly for
  the south, taking with him fifty spearmen. They came upon the Akasava hunting
  party sitting about a fire over which shrivelled monkey-meat was
  roasting.</p>

  <p>What followed need not be described in these pure pages; Bosambo had no
  right to brand the poachers with red-hot spear blades, and certainly his
  treatment did not err on the side of delicacy.</p>

  <p>Ten days later, the weary hunting party came to the Akasava city and
  carried their grievances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord king, this Bosambo beat us and put hot irons upon us, so that
  we must sleep on our faces and cannot sit because of the cruel pain. And when
  we spoke of our king, he made horrible faces.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here was a cause for war, but the crops were not in, so the king sent his
  eldest men to Sanders. There was a palaver, and Sandi gave judgment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If a man walks into the lair of a leopard, shall he come to me and
  say, &lsquo;I am scratched&rsquo;? For the leopards have their place, and the
  hunter has his. And if a man put his hand into a cooking-pot, shall he kill
  the woman at the fire because his hand is burnt? There is a place for the
  hand and a place for the boiling meat. Now, I give you this riddle. How can a
  man be burnt if he does not go to the fire? Let no man of the Akasava hunt in
  the forests of the Ochori. As to the lord chief Bosambo, I will make a
  palaver with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said one of the injured hunters, &ldquo;we are shamed
  before our wives, and we cannot sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand,&rdquo; said Sanders laconically; &ldquo;and as to your
  wives, this is a wise saying of the Akasava: &rsquo;No man turns his face to
  the sun or his back to his wife.&rsquo; The palaver is finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw Bosambo in the privacy of his hut, and the interview was brief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosambo, you shall neither maim nor kill, nor shall you put other
  people to shame. If these men hunt in your forest, do you not fish in their
  waters? They tell me, too, that you take your spears to the Akasava country
  and clear their woods of meat. This is my word, that you shall not again go
  into their hunting-grounds, until they come to yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh ko!&rdquo; said Bosambo in dismay; for the taboo which had been
  put upon him was the last he desired.</p>

  <p>Bosambo had an affection for a kind of wild duck that could only be
  trapped in the Akasava marshes, and the deprivation was a serious one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have repented in my heart, being a
  Christian, the same as you, and being well acquainted with Marki, Luki and
  Johnny, and other English lords. Let the Akasava come to my forest, and I
  will go to their lands to catch little birds. For, lord, I did not hurt these
  Akasava men, merely burning them in play, thinking they would
  laugh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders did not smile. &ldquo;Men do not laugh when they are so
  burnt,&rdquo; he said, and refused to lift the embargo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they come to you, you may go to them,&rdquo; he said at
  parting.</p>

  <p>For the greater part of three months Bosambo was Tempter. He withdrew his
  spies from the forest, he sent secret word to the Akasava king, inviting him
  to great hunts; he conveyed taunts and threats calculated to arouse all that
  was warlike in his bosom, but the Akasava king rejected the overtures and
  returned insult for insult. And Bosambo brooded on roast duck and grew
  morose.</p>

  <p>Then on a day Sanders had a message from one of his spies who kept a
  watchful eye upon the people of the Akasava And there was need for
  watchfulness, apart from the trouble with Bosambo, for it had been a year of
  record crops, and when the crops are plentiful and goats multiply in the
  Akasava country, and men grow rich in a season, and are relieved for the
  moment of the strain which judiciously applied taxation and the stubbornness
  of the soil impose, their minds turn to spears, and to the ancient stories of
  Akasava valour which the old men tell and the young maidens sing And they are
  apt, in their pride, to look around for new enemies, or to furbish old
  grievances. For this is the way of all peoples, primitive or civilised, that
  prosperity and idleness are the foundations of all mischief.</p>

  <p><i>Cala cala,</i> which means long ago, the N&rsquo;gombi people, who were
  wonderful workers of iron, had stolen a bedstead of solid brass, bequeathed
  to the king of the Akasava by a misguided missionary, who in turn had
  received it from as misguided a patron. And this bedstead of brass was an
  object of veneration and awe for twenty years; and then, in a little war
  which raged for the space of three moons between the Akasava and the
  N&rsquo;gombi, the Akasava city had been taken and sacked, and the bed of
  brass had gone across the river into the depths of the forest, and there, by
  cunning N&rsquo;gombi hands, had reappeared in the shape of bowls and rings
  and fine-drawn wire of fabulous value. For any object of metal is an
  irresistible attraction to the craftsmen of the forest&mdash;did not Sanders
  himself lose a steel anvil from the lower deck of the <i>Zaire?</i> The story
  of how ten men swam across the river, carrying that weight of metal, is a
  legend of N&rsquo;gombi.</p>

  <p>The true city of these people is situated two days march in the forest;
  and hither, one fine morning came messengers from the king of the
  Akasava&mdash;four haughty men, wearing feathers in their hair and leopard
  skins about their middle, and each man carrying a new shield and a bunch of
  bright killing spears, which the N&rsquo;gombi eyed with professional
  interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O king, I see you,&rdquo; said the chief envoy, one M&rsquo;guru.
  &ldquo;I am from your master, the king and lord of the Akasava, who, as you
  know, are the greatest people in these lands, being feared even by Sandi
  because of their valour and wonderful courage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of such people,&rdquo; said the king of the
  N&rsquo;gombi, &ldquo;though I have never seen them, except the spearers of
  fish who live by the river-side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was designed and accepted as a deadly insult, for the Akasava are
  great fish-eaters, and the N&rsquo;gombi do not eat fish at all, preferring
  frogs and snakes (as the slander goes).</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My king will bring his people to see you,&rdquo; said the envoy
  significantly. &ldquo;And this he will do soon, if you do not return to us
  the bedstead you stole <i>cala cala,</i> and which my king
  desires.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The king of the N&rsquo;gombi was smoking a long stemmed pipe with a tiny
  bowl, and the rancid scent of the native tobacco was an offence to the nose
  of the Akasava messenger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I M&rsquo;shimba M&rsquo;shamba, that I can bring from nothing
  something?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;As to your bedstead, it is not! Nor will
  it ever be again. Take this word to the little king of the Akasava, that I am
  M&rsquo;shulu-M&rsquo;shulu, son of B&rsquo;faro, son of M&rsquo;labo, son of
  E&rsquo;goro, who put the Akasava city to the flames and carried away the
  bedstead which was his by right. That I, this man who speaks, will meet the
  Akasava, and many will run quickly home, and they will run with the happiest,
  for they will be alive. This palaver is finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this the embassy carried back to the Akasava, and the <i>lokalis</i>
  beat, the young men danced joyously, as young men will when the madness of
  war comes to a people: and then, when secret preparations had been completed,
  and all was in readiness, an Akasava man, walking through the forest by the
  river, saw a foreigner throw a pigeon into the air, and the man was brought
  to the king of the Akasava, and a council of war was held. The prisoner was
  brought, bound, before the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a spy of Sandi&rsquo;s, and I
  think you have been speaking evilly of my people. Therefore you must
  die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Kano boy accepted the sentence philosophically. &ldquo;Lord
  king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a great ju-u in a little basket. Let me
  speak to him before I die, and I will speak well of you to the ghosts of the
  mountains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They brought him the basket and the pigeon it contained, and he fondled it
  for five minutes, and none saw him slip into the red band about the
  pigeon&rsquo;s leg a scrap of paper no larger than a man&rsquo;s thumb. Then,
  before they could realise what was happening, the pigeon had been flung into
  the air and was flying, with long, steady strokes and ever-widening circles,
  higher and higher, until it was beyond the reach of the arrows that the young
  men shot.</p>

  <p>Six young warriors carried Au, the Kano boy, into the forest. Bending down
  a young sapling, they fastened a rope to the top, the other end fastened in a
  noose about the spy&rsquo;s neck. His feet were pinioned to the ground, so
  that he was stretched almost to choking by the upward tug of the tree. The
  king himself struck off the head with a curved N&rsquo;gombi knife, and that
  was the end of Ali the spy.</p>

  <p>Three days passed in a final preparation, and on the morning of the fourth
  the king of the Akasava assembled his fighting men by the river-side; their
  war-painted canoes blackened the beach, their spears glittered beautifully in
  the sun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O people,&rdquo; said the king, exalted to madness, &ldquo;we go
  now to make an end of the N&rsquo;gombi...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His speech was nearing its peroration&mdash;for he was a notorious
  talker&mdash;when the white nose of the <i>Zaire</i> came round the wooded
  headland that hides the course of the river from sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is real war,&rdquo; said the king, and hardly had he spoken
  before a white puff of smoke came from the little steamer; there was a whine,
  a crashing explosion, and all that remained of the haughty king of the
  Akasava was an ugly mess upon the beach&mdash;it was a most fortunate
  shot.</p>

  <p>Sanders came ashore with fifty Houssas and four machine-guns; there was no
  resistance, and Kofaba, the king&rsquo;s nephew, reigned in his place.</p>

  <p>At the Palaver of All People, Sanders disposed, as he hoped, for ever of
  the brass bedstead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This brass bedstead lives for all time in my ghost house, with
  ju-jus and other wonderful things, for <i>cala cala</i> I took it from
  N&rsquo;gombi by magic and put it away that there should be no more wars. And
  Tibbetti, who is the Keeper of the House, sees this every morning and every
  night and touches it lovingly. Because it is the property of the Akasava and
  like no other in the world, I keep it, and no other nation, neither the
  N&rsquo;gombi nor the Isisi, nor the little bushmen nor the Ochori, shall see
  this great treasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The vigilant Bosambo, who had gathered his fighting regiments in readiness
  to intervene, dismissed them in disgust when he learnt of the comparatively
  peaceful termination of the dispute. Bosambo had visions of new treaties and
  the removal of old restrictions, and it was a disappointment to him to learn
  that the dispute had ended so bloodlessly.</p>

  <p>The cause of the quarrel was plain to him, and for some time made no
  impression, for ghosts and ju-jus and occult mysteries of all kinds had no
  place in his practical system. He began fresh negotiations with the new king
  of the Akasava, and sent two of his councillors on an embassy of
  congratulation, accompanied by a large bag of salt as a peace offering.</p>

  <p>But Kofaba was no more amenable than had been his uncle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to Bosambo, the little chief&rdquo; he said, with the
  arrogance of his new dignity upon him, &ldquo;and tell him that I, Kofaba, am
  Sandi&rsquo;s man and will keep Sandi&rsquo;s law. As to the salt, it is bad
  salt, for it has fallen into the water and is hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was perfectly true. Bosambo, who was of an economical mind, kept that
  salt bag as a permanent offering. It was the custom of chiefs and kings to
  greet one another with presents, though the ceremony was more or less
  perfunctory, and the present was invariably returned with polite expressions
  of gratitude.</p>

  <p>It is true that Bosambo had returned nothing; that he kept the bag of
  damaged salt in case some dignitary of the land, who hadn&rsquo;t sufficient
  decency to return his proffered gift, should accept the salt.</p>

  <p>Bosambo received the message wrathfully. &ldquo;It seems that this Kofaba
  is a common man.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now sit with me in palaver, and we
  will think great thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The palaver lasted for the greater part of four days, and every plan for
  the invasion of his kingdom was rejected. Bosambo might have sent forth his
  own poachers to satisfy his gastronomical needs, but he was a queer mixture
  of lawlessness and obedience to law, and would no more have thought of
  breaking his word to Sandi than he would of murdering his wife.</p>

  <p>Then, on the fourth day, a great thought came to his mind. In the evening
  he sent a canoe with six paddlers to the mouth of the river, for he
  remembered that it was the time of the year when Halli, the trader, came to
  the river.</p>

  <p>On a certain day, following the despatch of his mission, a crazy old tub,
  that had the appearance of a barge which had seen better days, came slowly
  along the coast, keeping close to the beach, for its skipper was taking no
  chances.</p>

  <p>Barge or lighter it had been. The stern wheel that creaked as it turned,
  was obviously home-made and home-fitted. The engine-house was no more than a
  canopy of rusty galvanised iron, through which poked the black snout of
  something that had once been a donkey engine, and was now the chief motive
  power of the <i>Comet</i>&mdash;such was the name of this strange craft.</p>

  <p>Amidships were three thatched huts, the sleeping apartments of the
  officers in command. Before these stretched an awning which covered a raised
  platform on which a man in a battered and dingy white helmet manipulated the
  steering wheel.</p>

  <p>By a miracle the <i>Comet</i> rounded the point and came slowly up the
  river. Opposite the residency quay the captain struck a big brass gong twice,
  and four perspiring natives cast an anchor overboard. The gong sounded three
  times, and the engines stopped.</p>

  <p>Passing back to examine the steam gauge, the captain washed his hands,
  lighted a long, thin cigar, and, stepping into the canoe that had been
  dropped for him, he was paddled ashore.</p>

  <p>He was tall and lean, and his face was the colour of Egyptian pottery. His
  age was somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-five.</p>

  <p>Bones stood on the quay watching the arrival of the craft. The manoeuvring
  of the <i>Comet</i> was to him a subject of fascinating interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Halley; the jolly old ship&rsquo;s still floating?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s still floating,&rdquo; agreed the other
  gravely.</p>

  <p>He was slow of speech, being unused to English, which he spoke very
  seldom, though it was his native tongue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Sanders at head-quarters? I want permission to trade up as
  far as Lobosolo on the Isisi, and I&rsquo;m taking up some stuff to
  Bosambo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your deadly cargo!&rdquo; asked Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whisky and machine-guns, as usual,&rdquo; said the other more
  gravely. &ldquo;We are thinking of introducing cocaine and mechanical pianos
  next voyage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Halley and Halley&rsquo;s <i>Garnet</i> were known from Ducca to
  Mossamedes. He was a one-man trader who from time to time dared the dangers
  of the deep for his immediate and personal profit. In this crazy ship of his
  he penetrated rivers, explored strange streams, exchanging his beads and
  looking glasses for rubber and ivory and the less valuable products that
  native industry produces. He was invariably fair in his dealings, and had a
  reputation for honesty that carried over a million square miles of
  country.</p>

  <p>Sanders welcomed him with a geniality which he offered to few other
  traders. He knew that there were no cheap German rifles concealed at the
  bottom of the <i>Comet&rsquo;s</i> cargo, nor illicit bottles of synthetic
  gin artfully hidden beneath bolts of Manchester goods. Halley was white in
  every sense, and whitest in his dealing with the women of the backlands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The country is quiet and the people are fairly happy,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Avoid the Tugesini River&mdash;there is another outbreak of
  smallpox there...the N&rsquo;gombi have been trapping leopards, and you
  should get some good skins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They gossiped of the people, of their idiosyncrasies and peculiar tastes,
  of how the Akasava never bought mirrors, and the queer passion of the Lesser
  Isisi folk for aluminium saucepans.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, the <i>Comet</i> went on its slow way, its donkey engine
  puffing noisily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Queer bird,&rdquo; said Hamilton, watching the departing boat.
  &ldquo;I wonder what the dickens he is doing with Ochori paddlers&mdash;did
  you notice them, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. &ldquo;Bosambo sent them up the coast a month
  ago&mdash;he&rsquo;s a great shopper. I wonder what stuff Halley is taking to
  our friend. I meant to ask him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo was the one chief of the territory who held any communication with
  the outside world. He waited patiently for the arrival of the <i>Cornet,</i>
  and when the ship came wallowing round the green bluff that hid the lower
  reaches of the river, Bosambo went down in state to meet his visitor, and for
  three days there were great bargainings and hagglings, Bosambo squatting on
  the untidy deck, Halley in his skin-seated chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Effendi,&rdquo; said Bosambo (it was his title of honour for all
  strangers), &ldquo;for all I buy I will pay in white man&rsquo;s
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Halley was gratified, but sceptical, and when Bosambo produced bags of
  shining coin, he was agreeably surprised. If he tried samples of the first
  bag in his strong white teeth, he did not test the second bag at all.</p>

  <p>Halley brought his eccentric boat to the mouth of the river, in the dark
  hours of the morning, and Bones, going down to the beach for his dip, saw the
  <i>Comet</i> crawling along the coast, no unusual circumstance, for the
  trader never stopped at the residency on his homeward voyage unless a sea was
  running. As it happened, Mr. Halley had nothing to stop for, since there had
  been no unusual happening to report.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;HAVE you ever thought, dear old sir, what a dinky
  little ice plant you could rig up in that old dugout?&rdquo; asked Bones,
  standing, his arms akimbo, before the grey door of the magazine. &ldquo;A
  refrigeratin&rsquo; plant, dear old Ham&mdash;we might even get some
  skatin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought I&rsquo;d like to see it a little cleaner
  than it is,&rdquo; said Hamilton, &ldquo;Have it turned out and lime-washed,
  Bones&mdash;and for heaven&rsquo;s sake let the men do the
  whitewashing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear old officer,&rdquo; said Bones reproachfully, &ldquo;as if
  I should turn myself into a jolly old paper hanger an&rsquo;
  decorator!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he came to lunch next day with boots that were splashed white
  and a long streak of whitewash on his nose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the way, have you a great deal of ammunition in stock,
  Hamilton?&rdquo; asked Sanders, who had been very quiet through lunch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The regulation amount, sir,&rdquo; said Hamilton in surprise.
  &ldquo;A thousand rounds per man&mdash;why, are you expecting
  trouble?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sanders shortly, and Hamilton knew from his brusque
  tones that the Commissioner&rsquo;s uncanny instinct was at work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe dear old excellency is worryin&rsquo; about my gettin&rsquo;
  a splash of whitewash in my eye,&rdquo; suggested Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing about me, dear old Ham&mdash;&rdquo; began
  Bones, but his superior was not in the mood to discuss the many funny aspects
  of Bones which had struck him from time to time. For Sanders&rsquo; anxiety
  had communicated itself to him.</p>

  <p>And yet there was no apparent reason for uneasiness; by the reports that
  came to head-quarters peace and prosperity were the orders of the Gay from
  one end of the river to the other.</p>

  <p>But Hamilton knew, as Sanders knew, that this condition of affairs was the
  invariable preliminary to all outbreaks and disturbances. The bolts, the real
  bolts, fell from a cloudless sky. Secretly Sanders preferred a condition when
  little quarrels between the tribes completely occupied their minds. Native
  people cannot think of two things at once. They are children who live in and
  for the day. Yesterday is <i>cala cala,</i> to-morrow is the dim and misty
  future.</p>

  <p>And then, one sleepy afternoon...</p>

  <p>By all the laws of average and chance, Bones should have been killed. As
  it was, he sneezed, and when Bones sneezed, his body fell into strange and
  fearful contortions. Sometimes he sneezed forward and finished up with his
  head between his knees (you must suppose him sitting in the shade of his
  verandah); sometimes he sneezed backward and his head jerked over the rail of
  his deck-chair, and, to the alarmed spectator, seemed in danger of dropping
  off. Usually he sneezed forward, but this time he raised his contorted visage
  to the heavens and sneezed at the blue skies. And the arrow, missing his
  throat, struck a pole of the verandah and stuck quiveringly.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts looked at the deadly shaft, dazed for a second. Then
  he rose quickly and went into his hut. He was out again in a second, a
  sporting Lee Metford in his hand. A glance at the arrow showed the direction.
  It had come from a Clump of cotton bush at the far side of the parade ground,
  and, sinking to one knee, Bones aimed at the groundline and fired.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;pang!&rdquo; of the shot brought the Houssa guard tumbling out
  of their hut, but before the Sergeant could reach him, the long legs of Bones
  were flying across the parade in the direction of the bushes. He heard a
  shout, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Hamilton leap the verandah and
  pelt along after him, but he did not slacken his pace, and was tearing
  through the bush before Hamilton had jumped the first fence of the
  plantation, and, guided by certain sounds of anguish, came up with his
  subordinate. Bones was standing, legs wide apart, arms akimbo, glaring down
  at a writhing, terror-stricken man on the ground.</p>

  <p>He did not display any apparent wound, and Hamilton frowned questioningly
  at the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little toe,&rdquo; said Bones briefly, and yet in his very
  terseness conveying a hint of annoyance. &ldquo;And I aimed for the
  <i>big</i> toe!&rdquo; he added later. &ldquo;I must have that naughty old
  rifle corrected. It isn&rsquo;t like me to make a perfectly ghastly error
  like that, old Ham&mdash;you know Bones!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton ignored the opening, &ldquo;What happened ?&rdquo; he asked, and
  at that moment Sanders came through the trees, a sporting rifle under his
  arm.</p>

  <p>He listened as Bones described his exact position before the hut, his
  occupation, his tendency to sneeze forward, his emotions at the sight of the
  arrow. His first thoughts, his alacrity, his amazing presence of mind and
  marksmanship. When he had finished, Sanders looked at the stricken man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak: Why did you do this evil thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, that is my mystery."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo; and &ldquo;secret&rdquo; are
  synonymous terms in the Lamongo tongue.]</p>

  <p>Sanders jerked his head on one side and looked at the assassin through
  narrowed lids.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I hang you, what of your mystery then?&rdquo; he asked, and the
  man made no reply.</p>

  <p>They put the would-be murderer in irons and confined him to the
  guard-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said the troubled Sanders.
  &ldquo;This fellow is Akasava and, though the Akasava are by nature and
  inclination assassins, they have never come to head-quarters to carry out
  their dirty work. Have steam in the <i>Zaire,</i> Hamilton, and warn your men
  to be ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may be some friend of his late majesty,&rdquo; suggested
  Hamilton, but Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One king is as good as another to the Akasava,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why Bones?&rdquo; said Hamilton, and Bones smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perhaps dawnin&rsquo; on your fusty old brain, dear old
  Ham, that the indigenous native is slowly wakin&rsquo; up to the sense of
  proportion, dear old sir and superior. You can&rsquo;t kid the jolly old
  native, Ham. He knows who&rsquo;s important an&rsquo; who isn&rsquo;t
  important. He strikes at the keystone of administration, dear old
  bird&mdash;not that I&rsquo;d disparage the importance of our blessed old
  excellency&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to deceive you, Bones,&rdquo; said Sanders, with his
  rare smile, &ldquo;but I hardly think that it is your importance that made
  you the object of attack&mdash;you happened to be in sight&mdash;so you got
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For once Sanders was wrong.</p>

  <p>Bones went to his hut that night, after inspecting the loose cordon of
  sentries he had posted, and getting into his pyjamas went to bed without the
  least suspicion that his claim was in any way justified. Bones was ordinarily
  a heavy sleeper and addicted to snoring&mdash;practice which he strenuously
  denied.</p>

  <p>His bed was in the centre of a large and airy hut, and there were two big
  windows, which were open day and night except for the frame of thin netting
  placed to keep out midnight insects.</p>

  <p>It was a burning sensation on his wrist that woke him with a snort. He
  rubbed the sore place and diagnosed the cause as mosquitoes. The hut was full
  of them, and he could hear the low buzzing of insects. He was out of bed
  instantly, slipping his feet into his long, pliable mosquito hoots.</p>

  <p>A glance at the nearest window revealed the fact that the netting was
  gone, and even as he looked he saw, against the dim light, a stealthy hand
  creep up and then a head.</p>

  <p><i>"Twing!"</i></p>

  <p>The arrow zipped past him, and he heard the thud of it as it struck the
  bed.</p>

  <p>Bones crossed the hut noiselessly and slipped his automatic from its
  hoister.</p>

  <p>Twice he fired, and, flinging open the door, ran out. A killing spear
  grazed his shoulder, and he fired again. He saw a man fall and another
  disappear into the darkness. Presently came a shot from the other side of the
  square&mdash;a sentry had seen the flying figure and had fired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another Akasava,&rdquo; said Sanders, the first to reach the
  spot.</p>

  <p>He turned over the limp figure that lay huddled against a verandah post.
  The second man sprawled on the square with a pistol bullet through his thigh,
  and he also was of the same people&mdash;the third man had escaped.</p>

  <p>At dawn the <i>Zaire</i> pushed out into the river. Day and night she
  steamed, stopping only to gather wood to feed her boilers. In the darkness,
  the villagers on the river saw her pass, a banner of sparks floating from her
  two funnels, and the <i>lokalis</i> sent word through the night that there
  was war&mdash;for the <i>Zaire</i> never steamed at night between the
  treacherous shoals unless the spears were out.</p>

  <p>The wooden drum carried news to others more interested, and ten miles
  short of the Akasava city, where the river narrows to pass through a sheer
  gorge, a cloud of arrows fell upon the deck, wounding a soldier and missing
  the steersman by a miracle.</p>

  <p>The <i>Zaire</i> panted forward, for here the river runs at seven knots,
  and whilst the marksmen peppered the edge of the bluff; Sanders examined the
  arrow heads.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tetanus,* I think,&rdquo; he said, and knew just how serious was
  the situation, for the Akasava did not usually poison their arrows.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* There are patches of land on the river, in which the
  germs of lockjaw abound.]</p>

  <p>The Akasava city was deserted, except for women and old men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said a trembling ancient, &ldquo;Kofaba has gone to
  the Ochori to get his beautiful bed that Tibbetti has given to
  Bosambo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are the father of ten fools,&rdquo; snarled Sanders, &ldquo;for
  the bed of the Akasava is in my great Ghost House.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Master, a man saw the Ghost House and it was empty, and a spy of
  Kofaba has seen the bed, very shining and beautiful, before the hut of
  Bosambo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Zaire</i> took on a new stock of wood and went northward. Near to
  the edge of the Ochori country, Sanders saw a canoe paddling downstream, and
  pulled the steamer across the river.</p>

  <p>In the canoe was a dead man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This Kofaba, the king,&rdquo; said the headman of the paddlers,
  &ldquo;he was killed this morning in a great fight, for Bosambo has the help
  of many devils. We go to bury Kofaba in the middle island, according to our
  custom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Later Sanders met the main body of the routed army and stopped their
  canoes, only to collect their spears and arrest the petty chiefs who were in
  charge.</p>

  <p>And each told him the story of Bosambo and his bed of brass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot understand it,&rdquo; he said puzzled, &ldquo;the Akasava
  would not make war on a rumour which Bosambo set in circulation that he had
  their infernal bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shadows were lengthening when he came at last to the Ochori city, and
  so unexpected was the arrival, that Bosambo was unaware of his coming until
  Sanders strode up the main street. He came within sight of the king&rsquo;s
  hut and stopped dead.</p>

  <p>Before the hut, and surrounded by his admiring people, Bosambo sat in
  state. His throne was a brass bedstead, over the slats of which skins had
  been spread.</p>

  <p>It was a bedstead of great beauty, having four glittering knobs, one at
  each corner, and on the head-rail were shining medallions that caught the
  light of the setting sun and sent it back in a thousand gleaming rays.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bosambo, I see you,&rdquo; said Sanders, and the big man
  scrambled to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said hastily, &ldquo;these Akasava men are thieves,
  for they came into my land with their spears to steal my beautiful
  bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I observe,&rdquo; said Sanders grimly, &ldquo;but now you will
  tell your strong men to carry the bed to my ship, for did you not tell the
  Akasava that by magic you had taken this beautiful bedstead from the House of
  Ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The agitation of Bosambo was pitiful to see, &ldquo;Lord, I told them this
  in jest. But this bed I bought from Haul, and, lord, I spent a great fortune,
  paying with real silver dollars that I had saved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may have the money back again,&rdquo; said Sanders, and
  Bosambo&rsquo;s eyes lit up, &ldquo;for if you take a bedstead by magic, you
  may take money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo spread out his hands in resignation. &ldquo;It is written,&rdquo;
  he said.</p>

  <p>He was a good Mohammedan, and most of the silver dollars he had paid were
  of a dubious quality. Mr. Halley discovered this later.</p>

    Dogs"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE mail-boat had come into sight, had dropped its
  letter-bag, and was a smudge on the horizon. Sanders sorted the personal
  mail, putting the letters beside each plate at the breakfast-table, and
  Captain Hamilton of the Houssas had read three letters, a balance-sheet, and
  the circular of a misguided racing tipster (this was sent on from
  Hamilton&rsquo;s club), and was re-reading one of the letters for the second
  time when Sanders asked:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where on earth is Bones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked round resentfully at the vacant chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s usually waiting on the
  mat for the post. Just now he is learning accountancy through a
  correspondence course, and that makes him keener.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, known by all and sundry, from His Excellency the
  Administrator to the least clerk of the district, as &ldquo;Bones,&rdquo;
  took correspondence courses as a hypochondriac takes physic. They were mostly
  of American origin, and they emanated from colleges which, although they
  occupied only one small room on the nineteenth floor of important buildings,
  did not hesitate to print pictures of the whole of those important buildings
  on their notepaper. They also awarded diplomas and degrees that were imposing
  and grand. Bones, after three years of frenzied study, was a Doctor of Law
  (University of Tuxedo), a Graduate of Science (Ippikosh University), a Fellow
  of the Incorporated Society of Architects (of Elma, Ill.), and Master of
  Dramatic and Cinematographic Art (Spicy&rsquo;s College of Dramaturgy,
  Sacramento, Cal.).</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Hamilton thoughtfully, &ldquo;this course will
  teach him to add. The last returns we rendered to H.Q. have been returned
  twice because Bones mixed the hundreds with the thousands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ham! Ham! Dear old officer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Lieutenant Tibbetts, alternately shrill with
  excitement and hoarse with pride, and it came from outside. Hamilton got up
  and walked to the door, Sanders following.</p>

  <p>Bones was standing before the broad steps, an angular figure in white, his
  big topee pushed back from his streaming forehead, one skinny arm extended
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jumping Moses!&rdquo; gasped Hamilton, &ldquo;Where did you get
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Straining at a lead wound round and round the extended hand of Bones, was
  the largest and ugliest bull-dog he had ever seen. It was white save for a
  smear of black that ran across its face. Its teeth were bare, its bow legs
  planted determinedly, and its stub of tail quivered ecstatically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bought it, old boy! Had it sent out by a jolly old pal of mine. Ah,
  naughty, naughty Hector!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hector had suddenly leant about and was confronting Bones, his lips curled
  back, a strange green light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hector, Hector!&rdquo; reproved Bones. &ldquo;Naughty, naughty old
  bow-wow. Yes, you is! You&rsquo;se a naughty old bow-wow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The naughty old bow-wow made a menacing noise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; said Bones soothingly, and stooped to pat the
  bullet head. Hector watched the approach of the hand with suspicion and
  doubt, but apparently was prepared to submit to the caress. Then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Snap!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones leapt back with a yell. &ldquo;Naughty, naughty!&rdquo; he squeaked.
  &ldquo;You bad, savage, naughty boy. Ugh! I&rsquo;m ashamed of
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hector bared his teeth and seemed crouching for a leap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never think, dear old Ham,&rdquo; beamed the proud
  owner, standing at a respectful distance, &ldquo;that a ferocious old johnny
  like Hector was as gentle as a jolly young baby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t: what the dickens are you going to do with
  him?&rdquo; asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Train him, dear old thing. In three months Hector will he carrying
  my stick and standing to attention. Up, Hector! Watch him, Ham! Most
  wonderful intelligence, dear old sir. Watch him stand on his hind
  legs&mdash;taught him in five minutes! Up, Hector!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones snapped frantic fingers above the bull pup&rsquo;s head, but Hector
  did no more than leer at him and make a mental calculation. Could he get
  those fingers if he jumped? Reluctantly he decided he couldn&rsquo;t, and
  closed his eyes wearily.</p>

  <p>Hamilton was looking at the dog. &ldquo;I don t think I should call her
  Hector, Bones,&rdquo; he said drily. &ldquo;Helen of Troy would be more
  respectful,&rdquo; and Bones gaped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he a she, dear old thing? Bless my dear old life! So he is. Hi,
  Helen! Up, Helen!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But not even her changed status affected the dozing Helen, and in the end
  Bones tied her to the verandah rail and went in to breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got him as a surprise for you, dear old Ham,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Your birthday coming along&mdash;how the dear old years spin
  round!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re going to pass that savage beast on to
  me&mdash;think again!&rdquo; said Hamilton firmly. &ldquo;My birthday was
  celebrated two months ago, as you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Christmas coming along,&rdquo; said Bones pleadingly.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to turn down dear old Santa Claus,
  Ham?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders, a silent and an amused observer, intervened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is something of a coincidence that your lady friend should have
  arrived to-day, Bones&mdash;by the way, I should keep Helen locked up whilst
  Fobolo is here...&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">RUNNING from the great river is a stream, so small and so
  covered by weed and elephant grass that only a few men knew the secret of its
  course. Therefore is it called &ldquo;No river-One River,&rdquo; or, more
  intimately, N&rsquo;ba, which is an abbreviation of ten Words signifying
  &ldquo;The-River-that-the-N&rsquo;gombi-found-and-the-Isisi-lost.&rdquo;
  Which is a name of reproach, for the Isisi are riverain folk, and the
  N&rsquo;gombi are forest people who are so unwise in the ways of water that,
  when they fall into the river, they make a noise that sounds like &ldquo;glub
  glub !&rdquo; and drown.</p>

  <p><i>Cala cala</i> in those days when Lieutenant Tibbetti was a comparative
  newcomer to the river, there lived at the end of this river of no appearance,
  and at the place where it drains the big lake, a man whose name was Fobolo.
  He was a rich man with many huts and many wives, and two and twenty young
  children. Of all men of the N&rsquo;gombi people he was most respected and
  feared, for his father, Kulaba, had been a very wise man and was skilled in
  the way of poisons, and many inconvenient people lay in shallow holes on the
  islands, troublesome no more, because of the bitter foods they had taken from
  their wives&rsquo; hands. These they had eaten, and had died, and their wives
  had girded their flanks with green leaves, and had stamped and strutted
  ceremoniously through the village in the Death Dance.</p>

  <p>Kulaba grew rich and taught his son Fobolo his mysteries, such as how a
  certain blue flower may be boiled and the drippings of its steam collected;
  and how the bulb of an ugly weed might be mashed and its juice disposed of.
  And such things.</p>

  <p>Fobolo listened attentively, and one night he went out into the forest and
  found a little flowering weed that has a strong and unpleasant perfume. The
  flowers of these he collected, and stewed them until, the water was all
  boiled away, and then he took the mess and made a small ball of it, That
  night his father had pains in the stomach and died, and Fobolo took all his
  wealth and his younger women, and went to the edge of the lake to enjoy the
  reward of his experiment, praising all the time the wisdom of his father, who
  had said &ldquo;this weed that grows flowers is death
  <i>mongo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So he became more powerful in the land than chiefs and headmen, and even
  the little kings came to him secretly and took away with them the messes he
  brewed. For kings have enemies. About Fobolo&rsquo;s huts grew the huts of
  his kinsmen, and of stray fishermen who, having no village of their own, were
  drawn into communion by the magnet of Fobolo&rsquo;s greatness.</p>

  <p>Fobolo was gaunt and tall and greedy. Wealth bred in him a desire for
  wealth. Though his deeply dug stores were filled with ivory teeth and rubber,
  and under the floor of his hut were many thousands of brass rods, and salt
  and other treasures were stacked tight in his huts, he sought new means of
  profit.</p>

  <p>On a cold, clear morning, when only the stars were hot in the sky, a woman
  in the house of the Akasava king went shivering into the open with a blanket
  about her shoulders. She knelt before the dead fire and blew at the ashes
  until the air was filled with snowy specks, and when she had coaxed the fire
  to a proper redness and had set a pot upon it and filled that pot with water
  and corn, she went to carry food to the king&rsquo;s dogs. They did not greet
  her with thin yelps, nor tear frantically at their grass-walled compound at
  the sound of her feet.</p>

  <p>There was a silence that was strange and alarming. As she stood peering
  into the void, the stars went out in the sky and the sun shot up and she saw
  in the light the dogs were gone, and went, coughing and sobbing in terror, to
  the king&rsquo;s hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O shameful and ugly woman,&rdquo; said the king, naked and blinking
  in the light to which he had been called, &ldquo;did I not give to your care
  my dogs, and now they are gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; she whimpered, &ldquo;last night I gave them water and
  dried fish, and they were happy, one putting out his tongue at me, and all
  moving their tails from side to side, which is the way dogs speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later a well-beaten woman howled her misery, and the
  <i>lokalis</i> of the city were drumming the news of the great steal.</p>

  <p>It would seem that N&rsquo;Kema the king was not the only loser, For the
  chief of the Isisi village, which lay on the other bank of the river, came
  paddling furiously to the Akasava beach and stalked into the presence of the
  king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord king, there is sorrow in my stomach that I should tell you
  this: last night came your young men to my village and took from me two
  beautiful fat dogs that were ready for the marriage feast of my own son. And
  these dogs were each worth five and five bags of salt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Forcibly and with violence did the king deny the charge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems, little chief; that, having stolen my dogs, you come to me
  with a lie that your dogs are taken. If I had lived in the days of my fathers
  before Sandi came, I would cut out your tongue and give your body to the
  ghosts. But now I will go to Sandi and tell him, and he shall put iron rings
  and chains on your legs according to his law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders at that time was on the <i>Zaire,</i> making a tour of inspection,
  and to him they went and with them four smaller chiefs of the neighbourhood
  who had suffered loss. And small comfort they received.</p>

  <p>A few months later, the youngest wife of N&rsquo;Kema was seen by his
  favourite daughter, Militi, who was the apple of the king&rsquo;s eye,
  speaking with a lover in the forest. And Militi carried word to her father,
  hating the woman who had replaced her mother in favouritism.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This woman of yours has a quiet man,&rdquo; she said, and told him
  things that a woman of fourteen would not have understood had she been
  white.</p>

  <p>N&rsquo;Kema took his youngest wife by the nape of her neck and flogged
  her with a strip of hippo-hide&mdash;which hurts.</p>

  <p>In his absence on a hunting trip, the wife found her way through the
  hidden river and came to Fobolo&rsquo;s village.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, wife of N&rsquo;Kema, the king,&rdquo; greeted Fobolo,
  standing on the beach as she landed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, Fobolo: I have a riddle for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No man understands riddles better than I,&rdquo; said Fobolo.
  &ldquo;Tell me this, and I will give you an answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When the young she-leopard claws,&rdquo; said the woman, giving him
  her mystery, &ldquo;must you wait for the scratches to heal and then go forth
  and be clawed again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My answer to your riddle is this,&rdquo; said Fobolo, who had
  solved such enigmas before, &ldquo;that it is better that the leopard should
  die that he will claw no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This clawing leopard was a popular illustration in a land where the favour
  of men is shown by a ring of brass, and their displeasure is scored deeply On
  the shoulders of their women.</p>

  <p>Whilst Fobolo went into his house, the woman wandered along the beach. And
  she came at last to a compound on the wooded promontory where there were many
  dogs. And two at least she recognized.</p>

  <p>She went back to the beach before Fobolo&rsquo;s hut, and after a while he
  came to her empty-handed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is in my mind. That little
  leopards may die and nobody shall speak. But if the leopard be great, then
  shall everybody speak and say, &lsquo;Last night this leopard was alive:
  today he is dead,&rsquo; and then Sandi will come and there will be a palaver
  and perhaps a woman who talks, and Fobolo&rsquo;s hut will he fire and he
  will be a ghost in the trees. Therefore, go back to your leopard and let him
  scratch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Shamelessly he retained the present she had brought him. The wife of the
  king went home sick with fright, and that night when her husband returned she
  told him a lie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, this day I went fishing through the
  River-that-the-N&rsquo;gombi-found, and there I saw Fobolo with many dogs.
  And of these there were two which were like the fat man dog Cheepi that you
  loved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was the very worst luck for all concerned that Bosambo, paramount chief
  of the Ochori, should have taken into his head the idea of paying a state
  visit to the Isisi king at that particular moment. N&rsquo;Kema, with two war
  canoes, had put out from his beach <i>en route</i> to recover his stolen
  dogs, when Bosambo&rsquo;s flotilla swept into sight round the bend of the
  river, With Bosambo were fifty excellent spearsmen, for the chief of the
  Ochori was by no means certain that the invitation which the Isisi had
  extended to him was purely disinterested.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Bosambo&rsquo;s painted canoes, N&rsquo;Kema and his
  fellows stopped paddling, for Bosambo was notoriously a creature of Sandi and
  it was essential for N&rsquo;Kema&rsquo;s peace of mind that his affair with
  the dogstealer should be settled without publicity.</p>

  <p>He had hoped that the canoes would pass, but Bosambo was a man with very
  keen eyesight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, N&rsquo;Kema,&rdquo; he boomed as his canoe drew
  alongside the others &ldquo;Is there war or peace in this land, that you go
  out with your young spears-men?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosambo, I came out to meet you, for, as you know, the people of
  the Akasava love you. And besides, I am going to the Great Lake to
  fish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Bosambo, &ldquo;that I see many shields
  at the bottom of your canoes. Now, tell me this, N&rsquo;Kema: do men fish
  with shields?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Mr. N&rsquo;Kema, who lacked the natural gift of lying, spoke
  frankly of the outrage which had been committed, and of his desire to execute
  summary justice upon the robber.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will see this Fobolo,&rdquo; said Bosambo instantly. &ldquo;And
  be sure N&rsquo;Kema that justice will be done. For, as you know, we men of
  the Ochori do not eat dogs; therefore it is certain that we shall return all
  we find.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>N&rsquo;Kema knew this to be true. For some extraordinary reason, to the
  Southern Ochori people dog meat was taboo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Bosambo,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;how may you know which
  are my beautiful dogs if I am not there to call them by loving words, and
  tell you that this is mine and this is not mine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if you say that all are yours,&rdquo; said Bosambo &ldquo;how
  do I know that you speak the truth? N&rsquo;Kema, I will go alone and hold a
  palaver, and in the end word of this matter will be sent to Sandi, who judges
  all, like God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bosambo, who had an amazing knowledge of the country, found the Little
  River without difficulty, and at the noon hour, when Fobolo was asleep in the
  shadow of his hut, Bosambo came to him and there was a long palaver, which
  could end only in one way.</p>

  <p>A carrier pigeon had taken to Sanders a sketchy account of Bosambo&rsquo;s
  rough-and-ready justice. Later came Fobolo himself, full of trouble and
  plaints. Squatting in the hot sunlight before the residency, Fobolo told his
  story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, this Bosambo came and made a long palaver, saying many evil
  things against me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me what evil things, Fobolo,&rdquo; said Sanders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, he called me a stealer of dogs and an eater of dogs; and that
  was foolish, as your lordship knows, for all true men eat dogs. And then,
  lord, when the palaver was finished, Bosambo went to a certain place near the
  water, where I keep all my dogs, and he took them all away with him; and,
  lord, they sat in Bosambo&rsquo;s canoe and made sad noises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders thought a moment, his chin in his palm, and then &ldquo;Fobolo, I
  speak! As to these dogs, I will send a book to Bosambo, and he shall tell me
  where they have gone. Afterwards, you shall tell me from whence they
  came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; protested the other, &ldquo;they are my very own dogs.
  I have had them all since they were little babies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is as may be,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;Now listen, Fobolo.
  Strange stories come to me from the Upper River of men who die quickly, and
  for no reason. And my spies tell me of women who go secretly to you by night,
  and come away with little gourds which hold death. Some day I will come to
  your village and hold a palaver. Tell me, Fobolo, how high do the trees grow
  on the edge of the Great Lake?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fobolo shuddered. &ldquo;Lord, they are too high for me,&rdquo; he said
  huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not so high that one of my soldiers cannot climb,&rdquo;
  replied Sanders significantly. &ldquo;And on one branch to fasten a rope
  where a man can hang. I think, Fobolo, your days are very few.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That night Fobolo sat with his followers in that place on the edge of the
  residency wood which is set apart for the entertainment of such visitors as
  he; and in the morning he was gone.</p>

  <p>The disappearance of Helen was not discovered till daylight. Bones had
  made for her a kennel of a peculiarly ingenious type. It was an exact replica
  of his own hut, with verandah poles and thatched roof complete. He had made
  it with the assistance of half the garrison, and had covered the floor of the
  interior with a thick layer of native grass. And Helen seemed to be
  satisfied, and to have no other desire than to sleep.</p>

  <p>She had been attached to a thick leather thong, Which in turn was fastened
  to one of the verandah poles, and there, with a large bone and a dish of
  water, Bones had left her, apparently reconciled to her fate, and even
  looking forward to the coming day. And in the morning she was gone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody but an imbecile would fasten a bull-dog to a leather
  lead,&rdquo; said Hamilton. &ldquo;Of course she gnawed it
  through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear old thing,&rdquo; said Bones dismally, &ldquo;she was
  so perfectly satisfied when I said &lsquo;night-night&rsquo; to her. And she
  looked up into my eyes with a kind of resigned, happy look, and toddled off
  without a word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bringing tears to my eyes,&rdquo; said Hamilton,
  &ldquo;And now she has toddled off without a word again. You&rsquo;ll
  probably find her in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A search, conducted by the entire population, produced no sign of the
  fugitive. Bones, looking for clues, found nothing more tangible than one of
  his slippers in the darkest corner of the kennel. It was half-eaten.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, nobody associated the disappearance of Helen of Troy
  with Fobolo, and no word of Helen came from the spies of Sanders.</p>

  <p>Three months later, Fobolo called together his kinsmen and spoke to
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know that I am rich and that all men envy me, even Sandi, who
  sent Bosambo here to take my dogs, which he has sold to the chief of the
  Isisi. And now I have word that Sandi is coming with his soldiers because of
  the death of a certain man who was poisoned by his wife. I must go quickly,
  or I shall hang, for the woman was put to the fire by the king of the
  Akasava, and she said that she bought the poison from me, giving me a
  thousand brass <i>matakos.</i> And this is true, that she told me it was for
  a leopard who broke into her garden and scratched her. But because
  N&rsquo;Kema hates me, he has sent word to Sandi&mdash;and it will not be
  good to stay. Tonight we will go away into the forest, taking our women and
  our treasures, and the dog with the beautiful face that I found in
  Sandi&rsquo;s garden. Also will we take Militi, who is the favourite daughter
  of the king, and is the most beautiful woman in the land. And she shall dance
  for us, and the king will be sorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That night when the <i>Zaire</i> was threshing her way up between the
  shoals, and was within ten miles of the Akasava city, Fobolo and his kinsmen
  landed noiselessly on the beach, and, slaying the sentry before the hut of
  the king&rsquo;s daughter, carried her away, and within two hours came to the
  village by the lake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, woman,&rdquo; said Fobolo, &ldquo;you may cry, but none will
  hear you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl, an object of dispassionate interest on the part of
  Fobolo&rsquo;s wives, lay moaning on the ground, more dead than alive, for
  Fobolo had choked her into silence when he carried her off. His kinsmen and
  his people were ready, their cooking-pots upon their shoulders, their young
  goats and dogs tethered, and each carried something of his treasures. Fobolo
  went to the little compound on the headland and opened the grass door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, my pretty one,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Helen of Troy opened her eyes and blinked at the sunlight. Then she
  stretched both her hind legs and her forelegs and yawned. For three months
  she had lain in that roomy pen, waddling out at intervals to inspect the
  village, and never once in all that time had she shown the slightest
  indication of her true character.</p>

  <p>To Fobolo, Helen of Troy was a normal dog, something which in time would
  make an excellent <i>piece de resistance</i> for a feast. And Helen had
  fostered this illusion, for she had been content to eat and sleep, and since,
  after the native way, none interfered with her, she had interfered with none.
  Obediently and meekly she trotted at Fobolo&rsquo;s heels back to the village
  street, where the carriers were waiting. The girl still sat huddled, clasping
  her knees, her face hidden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, woman,&rdquo; said Fobolo, &ldquo;for you will walk far
  before you sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So far he got, when his trained ears heard the rumble of a distant
  <i>lokali</i>. <i>Lokalis</i> belong to the night and to the early morning,
  when the air is still and sound travels fastest. He bent his head and
  listened, then suddenly heaved a long, sobbing sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sandi is coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we had better
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In his hand was a long and pliant thong. He dropped it sharply across the
  girl&rsquo;s shoulders and jerked her to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walk, woman,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>And at that moment Helen of Troy began to take a serious interest in the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>At the shriek of the girl she growled softly and as though encouraged by
  the ferocity of her own language, the growl became a bark the like of which
  had never been heard by Fobolo. The fat food dogs looked round at Helen in
  terror. That bark stirred something within them, and they whimpered fiercely
  in response.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog,&rdquo; said Fobolo, &ldquo;be silent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He brought up the thong and it fell once. He only knew one kind of
  dog&mdash;a dog that whimpered and fled. But Helen did neither. She stood
  square, motionless, glaring, her black lips curled in a silent snarl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said Fobolo.</p>

  <p>And then something weighing about 20 lbs leapt at him. He struck it down
  with the bunch of spears he carried on his shield arm, but the respite was
  temporary.</p>

  <p>As the <i>Zaire</i> pushed her nose through the last barrier of weeds and
  gained the open water of the Lake, Sanders saw a figure running along the
  sandy edge of the lake. He was running at a speed which at once interested
  and startled the Commissioner. Behind him bounded a small white speck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that, Bones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones focussed his glasses. &ldquo;Looks like a man running to me,
  sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>At that moment the flying native saw the <i>Zaire,</i> and, turning,
  plunged into the water and swam frantically toward the boat. Behind him came
  a blunt head, and, at a short interval, the white stump of a tail.</p>

  <p>They hauled the two on board together, which was necessary, since Helen of
  Troy had gripped his loincloth and was not to be shaken off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dogs I know,&rdquo; gasped Fobolo. &ldquo;Men eat them. But it is
  not right that dogs should eat men. I think this is a devil. Devils also I
  have seen, being a wise man, but none like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;there are other devils to be
  seen. And if in your village I find Militi, the daughter of N&rsquo;Kemo,
  this night you shall live with ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="story07"
     id="story07">VII. &mdash; THE CAMERA MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., May
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR a thousand years (which may only mean a few centuries)
  there had been a feud between the Leopards and the Fire Ghosts. When the
  Leopards came under the ban of civilised administration and soldiers of all
  nations penetrated the hinterlands with judges and priests and commissioners
  who were something of both and by whipping and summary hanging, stamped down
  this most evil of all secret societies, the Fire Ghosts, being comparatively
  innocuous, were left supreme. For they did not hunt young maidens having
  gloves on their hands shaped like leopards&rsquo; paws, with little steel
  knives in place of the claws, nor did they hold terrible meetings where
  things were done that can only be described in highly technical books. They
  were mild folk who believed in ghosts and devils, and they did no more than
  chop an occasional enemy and paint the soles of their feet with his
  blood.</p>

  <p>But presently they, too, came under the ban, and dwindled until all the
  ancient hates and animosities, together with the secrets of their rituals,
  were concentrated in the villages of Labala and Busuri, and although they
  were within a dozen miles of one another, they kept the peace.</p>

  <p>Then a thing happened that had no parallel in history. A woman of Busuri
  married Obaga, tile hunter of Labala. As to the reason for this monstrous
  union, some say one thing and some say another. They first met in the forest,
  and each made the contemptuous gesture&mdash;by European standards
  vulgar&mdash;with which Labala and Busuri greet one another. Then they met
  again and refrained, Afterwards they smiled, and then came Obaga to the Chief
  of the Busuri and the father of the girl, and a bargain was struck. So
  M&rsquo;Libi of Busuri went into the hut of Obaga and lived with him for two
  years, but bore him no children.</p>

  <p>Whereupon all the old women of the village put their shaven heads together
  and cackled joy that their prophecies had been fulfilled, for they had said
  that no children could come of such an unnatural marriage. So also the old
  women of Labala spoke over their menial tasks and cursed the day that such a
  likeable girl had gone to the Fire Ghosts. So affairs went on, Obaga patient,
  uncomplaining, kindly. He brought her the finest of his pelts; the noblest of
  monkey tails, the prerogative of chiefs, were split to make her a bed robe. A
  few gibed him secretly because he was loved; none openly because he was
  feared, for he threw spears unerringly and had no regard for human life.</p>

  <p>Then on a day, Obaga returned from a hunting trip seven days earlier than
  he had expected. More important, he was not expected by his handsome young
  wife. Obaga found his hut empty, and when he came out with knit brows,
  N&rsquo;kema, the fisherman, shouted a jest that had to do with the short
  memories of women.</p>

  <p>Without a word Obaga went back into his hut and gathered the short killing
  spears he had put aside, polished them with dust gathered from before his
  hut, and, sitting on his bed, whetted one of them for two hours until the
  edge of it was razor-sharp. Then he went forth, twirling the spear between
  his fingers. He was making for the banks of a little river which runs through
  a wood, for this was a notorious meeting-place for lovers of a kind.
  Therefore, it was called The Wood of Changed Hearts&mdash;or so we may
  translate it, though the stomach is more readily recognised as the seat of
  all emotion.</p>

  <p>Somebody had gone to warn M&rsquo;Libi, and halfway to the wood, very near
  to a patch of shallow graves (these Northern Ochori considering it unlucky to
  carry their dead across water to the middle islands) he found her sitting on
  a fungus-grown trunk of dead wood, her hands crossed on her breast The scowl
  on her face denied her humility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O M&rsquo;Libi, I see you,&rdquo; said Obaga the hunter softly, and
  she set her white teeth for all that was to come, her eyes fixed on the
  bright spear blade which glittered and flashed in the afternoon sun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obaga, I have been to the woods to gather leaves for mourning, for
  my brother has died this day in the Ochori city, and Bosambo sent word to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many things have died this day,&rdquo; said Obaga. He held his
  spear at full arm&rsquo;s length by his thigh, and he so spun it with finger
  and thumb, that the blade was a blur of light. This was a trick of his when
  he was not sure in his mind, and she knew it well and took courage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I was born,&rdquo; she said slowly, her eye never leaving the
  spear, &ldquo;it was said that I should have two lives; one of greatness and
  one of evilness. Out of the mud grows the wonderful flower. Obaga, who knows
  what will come from this mud?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The hunter wetted his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is this lover of yours?&rdquo; he asked her, and for the first
  time her eyes left the spear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If there is to be killing, begin!&rdquo; she said, and dropped her
  hands to the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There will be no killing,&rdquo; said Obaga.
  &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She followed him back to the village, and, to the disappointment of all,
  there was neither killing nor beating. At dawn next day, Obaga gathered his
  spears, his bows and loose-headed monkey arrows, girded a broad-bladed
  elephant sword about his waist, and went back to his hunting. His wife stood
  and watched him until he was out of sight. One other watched from the fringe
  of the forest, Tebeli, the boaster, and when he had made sure that the
  husband was gone, he hurried to M&rsquo;Libi.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * *</p>

  <p>There can be no question that Bones had an inquiring mind. And there was a
  special reason why he should be interested in photography and all that
  pertained to the art, at that moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You stick your infernal nose into every darned thing that
  doesn&rsquo;t concern you,&rdquo; said the wrathful Hamilton, the owner of a
  new camera, an important plate of which Bones had irretrievably ruined.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for weeks to get that cloud effect over the
  sea, and you, like the howling jackass...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not howlin&rsquo;, dear old Ham,&rdquo; murmured the patient Bones
  his eyes tightly shut &ldquo;quiet, dignified, sufferin&rsquo;, dear old
  savage, in silence...not howlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you...&rdquo; spluttered Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You told me nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bones gently, &ldquo;and a
  boy should be told. I read it somewhere in a jolly old book the other day, a
  boy should be told how to work the shutter and everything. A loaded camera,
  dear old tyro&mdash;which means a cove that doesn&rsquo;t know an awful
  lot&mdash;a loaded camera is worse than a loaded gun. Listen to the voice of
  reason, dear old Ham, the <i>vox reasoni.</i> I picked up the silly old thing
  and clicked the shutter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never leave things within reach of children,&rdquo; said Hamilton
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his lean shoulders. &ldquo;Dear, but explosive old
  officer,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;there may be method in my jolly old
  naughtiness. There may be money, dear old improvident one. Old Bones may be
  working out a great old scheme in his nippy old nut, to make us all
  rich.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Orange growing?&rdquo; asked Hamilton pointedly, and Bones writhed.
  Once he had conceived a get-rich-quick scheme, and Hamilton had put his money
  into an orange syndicate which Bones had conceived. They had imported trees
  and they had grown trees that lore everything except oranges. Some had borne
  apples, a few might, had they lived, have borne chestnuts. Bones bought the
  young trees by post, from the Zeizermann Mail Order Corporation&mdash;the
  proprietors of which are still in Sing Sing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Being my superior officer, sir and captain, you may taunt
  me,&rdquo; he said stiffly and shrugging his shoulders again, saluted and
  went back to his quarters. He could, of course, have offered a very complete
  and satisfactory explanation, but had he done so, he would have spoilt the
  surprise he had in store for everybody.</p>

  <p>And to Bones, surprise (other people&rsquo;s pleasant surprise) was the
  joy of life.</p>

  <p>Most of his day-dreams were about surprises that he sprung on other
  people. Bones had on many occasions owned a potential Derby winner, and on
  the morning of the race, the jockey having proved false, Bones had donned the
  colours and to the amazement of his friends and the confusion of his sinister
  enemies, he had ridden the horse home a winner in a desperate finish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never in the history of this great classic (so his dream
  <i>Sporting Life</i> read) has there been a more wonderful exhibition of
  masterly jockeyship than that given by the famous amateur rider, Captain (or
  Major) Tibbetts. He is a noble-looking fellow, with grave blue eyes and a
  mask-like yet mobile face...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this point Bones would sigh happily and introduce The Girl. There was
  always a girl. He saw her on the stand, white-faced and tearing at her
  handkerchief (not an expensive handkerchief) or clutching at her throat, and
  she always fell into his arms when he dismounted, and, presumably, was
  weighed in with him.</p>

  <p>He had surprised the War Office by inventing a new gun and the Admiralty
  by compounding a new strategy, but mostly, as has been remarked before, he
  surprised girls by his strength, genius, workmanship, knowledge of women,
  kindness of disposition, tenderness of heart, wit, nobility of character, and
  general all-round excellence. And the <i>motif</i> of Bones&rsquo; plan of
  surprisement at the moment was an amazing cinema camera which he had seen
  advertised in an American magazine, and which at that moment was speeding on
  its way&mdash;it would in fact arrive by the same steamer that carried home
  Father Carrelli.</p>

  <p>Bones had an immense faith in the probity of magazine advertisements, and
  when he read of Keissler&rsquo;s King Kamera which was offered at $150.00,
  and after he had discovered that $150.00 was not fifteen thousand, but a
  hundred and fifty and no cents, he wrote for the prospectus and received in
  reply an avalanche of literature which was alone worth the money.</p>

  <p>Therefore, anything of a photographic nature meant much to Bones. He could
  have explained his fault in a word. Instead he maintained silence. There was
  time enough later&mdash;and the story had to be written, for in those days
  the picture play was coming to its own, and Bones was an enthusiastic
  subscriber to all movie periodicals that were published. He had many stories
  in his mind.</p>

  <p>Nobody paid any particular attention to the arrival of a large case or of
  sundry other bulky packages, because both Sanders and Hamilton had long since
  ceased to wonder at the amazing character of Bones&rsquo; mail. He had, on an
  average, one new hobby a month, and the inauguration of each was signalised
  by mails of terrific or mysterious proportions.</p>

  <p>The first hint Hamilton had that something unusual was afoot, came to him
  in the nature of a shock. One afternoon he strolled over to the hut in which
  Bones had his head-quarters, and, as was usual, he made straight for the big
  window which gave access to the young man&rsquo;s sitting-room; and, looking
  in, he gasped.</p>

  <p>Sitting at the table was a young man who was not Bones. His face was a
  bright and vivid yellow; his hands and bare arms were similarly tinted; about
  his eyes were two rings of blue. Hamilton stared open-mouthed, and then
  dashed into the hut through the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s the matter with you,
  Bones&mdash;fever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones looked up with a horrible smile, for his lips were painted a blue
  that was nearly purple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get into bed at once,&rdquo; ordered Hamilton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  wire through to Administration to get a doctor down&mdash;you poor young
  devil!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones looked at him haughtily as he fixed a slight, dark moustache to his
  upper lip. And then it was that Hamilton saw the make-up box and the
  mirror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing, you great jackass?&rdquo; he asked, offensive
  in his relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just a bit of make-up, dear old audience,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make-up? Yellow? What are you supposed to be? The King of the Gold
  Coast?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;m supposed to be,&rdquo; said Bones
  carelessly, and handed a slip of paper to his visitor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reginald de Coursy, a man of synister appearance, yet of plesing
  apearance. His eyes show sings of diserpation dissipation disapation his nose
  is aquerline his mouth creul. He looks like a man who has lived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look more like a man who has died,&rdquo; snarled his superior.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this dashed nonsense?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not say &ldquo;dashed.&rdquo; Bones screwed his face in an
  expression of pain, and the grimace made his face even more startling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Language, dear old thing! That&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;m
  not going to have. I hate to hurt your jolly old feelings, Ham, but the
  studio must be kept clean.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Studio?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t got a studio yet,&rdquo; admitted Bones,
  &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s coming, dear old Felix&mdash;you&rsquo;re
  Felix.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m what?&rdquo; asked the dazed Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Bones searched the litter of papers by the side of his makeup box and
  found another slip, which he handed without a word to his chief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellix Harington a young and hansom fellow of 26. His countenance
  is open and Frank and a genal smile is in his eyes, but very
  deceptful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton could only look helplessly from the paper to Bones. That
  gentleman was perfectly composed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fortune in it, my dear old officer,&rdquo; he said
  calmly. &ldquo;In fact, there&rsquo;s two fortunes in it. Now, my idea is a
  play where a seemingly villainous person turns out a jolly old hero in the
  end. And the seemingly heroic old person turns out a jolly old
  rotter&mdash;robs his old father, an is going to murder him, when up comes
  Reggie the Knut&mdash;that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said the dazed Hamilton. &ldquo;Do I
  understand that you have cast me for this part&mdash;and may I ask who is the
  father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The jolly old Commissioner,&rdquo; said Bones complacently, and
  Hamilton&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>When he recovered command of his voice:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you imagine that Sanders is going to jigger about, wearing false
  whiskers, just to amuse an infernal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about the whiskers,&rdquo; said Bones
  thoughtfully &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been turning it over in my mind, dear old Ham,
  and I&rsquo;m not so sure that the whiskers would come out. A little beard
  perhaps, or maybe a couple of mutton chops.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Bones&rsquo; scheme came out. He had written a great play; it was
  entirely without women characters. He, Sanders and Hamilton were to act the
  story in their spare time, work in, to use his own expression, &ldquo;a dinky
  little battle between savages, where I come along, dear old thing, and foil
  them single-handed&mdash;and it will be a sensation, Ham. There&rsquo;s never
  been anything done like it and there never will be again perhaps, unless I do
  it. Look at the life, my dear old Felix...the wonderful scenery...it will be
  a sensation, dear old thing. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we didn&rsquo;t
  make half-a-million.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders heard all about this new scheme of Bones&rsquo; without being
  either annoyed or perturbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you may tell him from me, Hamilton, that under no conditions
  will I act the fool in front of his wretched camera. By the way, did you see
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad-looking camera,&rdquo; he
  admitted, &ldquo;and Bones can turn the handle very well. He&rsquo;s been to
  the kitchen, practising on the knife-cleaner, and he says he&rsquo;s got
  exactly the right speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baffled in his great attempt to create a picture which should startle the
  world, Bones, the adaptable, decided upon a great native drama.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never been done, dear old Ham,&rdquo; he said eagerly
  one night at dinner, when he expounded his scheme&mdash;and it was curious
  how quickly he had assimilated the cliches of the
  studio&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the one thing you&rsquo;ve got to be careful
  about on the cinema, old boy, do something that has never been done before.
  I&rsquo;m working out the scenery now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The word you want, I think,&rdquo; said Hamilton, &ldquo;is
  &lsquo;scenario.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same thing, my dear old Ham,&rdquo; said Bones testily. &ldquo;Good
  gracious heavens, why do you interrupt me on a trivial little matter like
  scenery? Scenery or scenario&mdash;same jolly old thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you laying the plot?&rdquo; asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere, dear old excellency,&rdquo; said Bones vaguely. &ldquo;My
  idea is to make Ahmet the hero, who runs away with the beautiful Kalambala,
  the Sultan&rsquo;s favourite wife. And she&rsquo;s rescued by a handsome
  young Englishman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Need you go any further?&rdquo; asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A handsome young Englishman,&rdquo; repeated Bones, with a
  contemptuous glance at his superior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, of course,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, she&rsquo;s rescued.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then what do you do with her?&rdquo; asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>But Bones hadn&rsquo;t got as far as this. He filmed the first scene of
  this exciting story, and Hamilton and Sanders came down to witness the
  production. The attempt was a failure for many reasons. Ahmet had to stroll
  on to the scene, fold his arms, shake his head and smile. Then he had to
  shrug his shoulders and walk off. And he did it remarkably well until Bones
  started turning the handle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Roll your eyes,&rdquo; screamed Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I roll my eyes,&rdquo; said Ahmet, standing stiffly to
  attention and saluting.</p>

  <p>Bones stopped turning with a groan. &ldquo;O man,&rdquo; he said bitterly,
  &ldquo;when I speak to you, do not stick your big feet together and salute
  me! Stand easy! Now try it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He tried it again, with no greater success; for this time, instead of
  saluting, Ahmet stood regimentally at ease. When the scene was made right,
  new trouble arose. The escaping Sultana was to be played by the wife of a
  Corporal Hafiz; and Corporal Hafiz refused resolutely, and with much stamping
  of feet and spitting on the ground, to allow his wife to be carried in
  Ahmet&rsquo;s arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re demoralising the detachment, Bones,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton sternly, and dismissed the actors to their several duties.</p>

  <p>Bones did not speak to his company commander for two days, at the end of
  which time he had found a new and more alluring scheme.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, old Ham,&rdquo; he said one day, dashing into
  the dining-room where the two men were sitting, smoking their after-luncheon
  cigars, in what shade they could find, for the sun was burning and there was
  little or no breeze from the sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get sunstroke if you go around without your
  helmet,&rdquo; said Hamilton lazily. &ldquo;What have you got? The
  picture?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The picture!&rdquo; said Bones triumphantly. &ldquo;The greatest
  stunt ever, dear old excellency. And it all came out of jolly old
  Bones&rsquo; nut. Lives and customs of savage old tribes, dear old
  officer.&rdquo; He stepped back to notice the effect of his words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lives and customs of savage tribes?&rdquo; repeated Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. Wherever I go, I take the camera, and if I
  don&rsquo;t make a thousand a week lecturing on a subject, dear old killjoy,
  that is dear to the heart of every jolly old patriot, my name is
  mud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your real name I&rsquo;ve never been able to remember,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton, &ldquo;but it does strike me as being much more feasible than the
  other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thereafter, Bones spent a great deal of his time filming native scenes;
  and for once there happened to be method in his hobby. Having trained Ahmet
  to turn the handle, he was able to make a personal appearance in most.
  Sometimes he was standing in a negligent attitude, talking to a native woman
  as she cooked the evening meal. In other pictures he was patting the heads of
  little black toddlers (after carefully fixing a handkerchief about their
  middles, lest the susceptibilities of Surbiton should be shocked), Sometimes
  he was standing with his arms folded, and a sad but determined look upon his
  face, on the bow of the <i>Zaire.</i> And to all he supplied titles. He
  showed Hamilton a list of them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kindly Cheif Comissioner helping Savidges to build a
  Hut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Or, more flamboyantly, and in keeping with the spirit of modern
  sub-titles:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Far from the hum and compitetion of the bussy world, the native
  goes about his daily tarsks, under the watchful but bernevilent eye of the
  Cheif Comissioner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of the advantages of the cinema,&rdquo; said Hamilton,
  &ldquo;is that you needn&rsquo;t be able to spell. Who is this Chief
  Commissioner you keep talking about in your titles, Bones?&rdquo; he asked,
  interested. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Sanders was assisting you in your
  nefarious plan to pander to the debased instincts of the British
  public!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones coughed. &ldquo;Well, to be perfectly candid, dear old thing,&rdquo;
  he said, &ldquo;dear old Sanders did talk about toddling down once, but he
  got stage-fright, old Ham. You know what these youngsters are, what,
  what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones could be waggish, but Bones could never be so waggish that he could
  lead Hamilton from his deadly trail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you&rsquo;re masquerading as a
  Commissioner? Why, even the poorest little street Arab that ever stole
  sixpence to go to the pictures will recognise your fake!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones could afford to smile indulgently at the other&rsquo;s
  strictures.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What we want now, Ham,&rdquo; he said seriously at dinner that
  night, &ldquo;is a jolly old war! If we could only get a real good old
  dust-up between the mighty N&rsquo;gombi and good old Bosambo, with me in the
  foreground, just to show that Britain&rsquo;s watchful eye still keeps a
  watch, when naughty natives sleep&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good bit of poetry, by
  the way, dear old thing, and don&rsquo;t pass it off as your own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, if you wish for war I&rsquo;ll kill you,&rdquo; said
  Sanders, coming in at that moment. &ldquo;The territories are quiet, and if
  we can only get over the harvest without a real big blood-letting, I shall be
  a happy man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones was silent, but not altogether hopeless. There was need for somebody
  to go to the Ochori country, for there was news of a recrudescence of Leopard
  trouble, and Bones gladly availed himself of the opportunity.</p>

  <p>On the first night away from head-quarters, when the <i>Zaire</i> was tied
  up to a wood, Private Mahmud sought out his sergeant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Effendi,&rdquo; said he in coast Arabic, &ldquo;what is this small
  box which Tibbetti carries and which you turn with a handle? Some say that it
  is a new gun; others that it is a taker of pictures. Now, we know that it is
  not a taker of pictures, because, when Hamiltini desires that a row of
  Houssas shall appear upon paper&mdash;which is against the law of the
  Prophet&mdash;he says, &lsquo;Damnyoustandstill,&rsquo; which is an English
  word, and makes a clicking noise. Now Tibbetti does not say
  &lsquo;Damnyoustandstill&rsquo; for he desires that you should walk; also he
  turns a handle. Tell me now, Effendi, why these things happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sergeant Ahmet, in all solemnity, explained as much of the mystery box as
  he understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When Tibbetti turns the handle, pictures appear, one after another,
  so that when they are looked at quickly, they seem to be one and all
  moving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is too much of a mystery for me,&rdquo; admitted the inquirer
  after knowledge, and sought no further information.</p>

  <p>Not unconscious of his responsibility and importance, Ahmet was loth to
  let the discussion end there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some day, when Tibbetti is away, I will gather you all together and
  make a special picture for you, so that your wives may see them. And for this
  you shall all give me one silver dollar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though they boggled at the dollar, his men accepted the principle of the
  offer.</p>

  <p>The opportunity he sought came to them after they had left the Ochori city
  and were journeying up that wild bank line which the <i>Zaire</i> so seldom
  traversed. More definite news had reached Bones about the Leopards&mdash;not
  the clean and yellow thing that stalks and slays, but something vile and
  abominable in the shape of man. Bones became instantly soldier and
  representative of the law, and for the moment his heart turned from
  Hollywood.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">OBAGA came back from his hunting. He had been a month away,
  and he had brought with him ten bushmen carriers, each with a load of pelts,
  for he was a skilful and patient man. His wife met him outside the village,
  her hands crossed before her, token of her meekness, and he passed her
  without a word, though, if he had known all he was to know, he would have
  returned to the village alone. She made him his dinner, and served it on the
  palms of her two hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I stay here now for three and three moons,&rdquo; said Obaga,
  &ldquo;for the beasts will be breeding, and many have already gone away into
  their secret places.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This she expected, and by native reckoning a month would pass before he
  learnt the truth. That night, when her husband was sleeping the sleep of
  utter weariness, she crept forth from her hut, and sped secretly to the wood,
  where the other man was waiting, she having sent for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obaga is returned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now, friend, what shall
  I do? For when he knows, he will kill me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should he know?&rdquo; compromised the other, manlike.
  &ldquo;For are you not his wife, and is he not a man? I think it is best for
  you to say, &rsquo;Husband, there is good news for you, and you shall have a
  son for your house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She made a sound of impatience, &ldquo;He knows what he knows,&rdquo; she
  said cryptically, but to him understandably. &ldquo;If I tell him this, I
  will take his killing spear into my hands, so that it will be sooner over. If
  you were to come into the hut tonight and spear him as he sleeps, or wait for
  him when he goes into the wood to-morrow, that would be best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For you, woman, but not for me,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;All
  men in this village know that I am your lover, and Sandi will come with his
  guns and his soldiers, and my hut will be burnt. Also, Tibbetti is already
  here, He is sitting in the village of Busuri, where there is a Leopard
  palaver. It is said that there will be hangings. I know this, because the
  cunning ones have hidden their pads in the ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She drew a quick breath. &ldquo;Bring me the pads, she whispered.
  To-morrow, when it is dark, bring me the leopard pads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was horrified at the suggestion, but she insisted; and in trepidation
  and fear he left her. She went back and lay down by her man.</p>

  <p>When the next night came, she found Tebeli, for whom she had dared so
  much, and he was shaking like a leaf, and in his hands were two ugly
  skin-shapes, with little knives in place of claws, and the hair had earth
  upon it, as though they had recently been dug from the ground. He dropped
  them into the hands she held out as though they were red hot, and, turning
  without a word, would have fled back towards his village, but she stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, my own man, go towards Busuri, where Tibbetti is, and tell him
  that a Leopard walks toward the village, and that, if they wait by the path,
  they may take him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was in no mood for such an adventure, but she was stronger than he, and
  he went. And M&rsquo;Libi returned to her hut, the pads, glove-like, on her
  hands. Obaga was too busy with his spears to notice, but when his eyes
  turned, he saw in the flickering light of the fire the hideous things she
  wore, and dropped his spear and leapt up with a roar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman who art shameless, what have you there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These I found in my little box of wood, Obaga,&rdquo; she said
  innocently.</p>

  <p>She held her hands up to be admired, and the rusted steel claws glittered
  evilly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh ko!&rdquo; said Obaga, agitated, &ldquo;whose things are
  these?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They belong to a man in the village of Busuri,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Lobala, the fisher. These he gave to me when I was a little
  girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give them,&rdquo; said her husband, snatching them from her
  hand.</p>

  <p>A second later, he was striding through the village to the forest path
  that led to Busuri. But the lover of his wife was quicker than he, and on the
  edge of the village three soldiers seized Obaga and brought him into the
  presence of Bones.</p>

  <p>Now, of all things certain, this is most sure; any man who carries on his
  person, or hides in his hut, the insignia of the Leopard, is already dead.
  From one end of Africa to the other there is no mercy for the Sons of the
  Leopard. Obaga knew that his fate was sealed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said Bones quietly, as he surveyed the damning
  evidence, &ldquo;what horrible things are these?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, they were given to me to bring to the village,&rdquo; said
  Obaga.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who gave?&rdquo; asked Bones, but the man was silent, because it
  was his wife who had given them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, if I hang, I must hang,&rdquo; said Obaga. &ldquo;But I tell
  you this, that the Leopards are my enemies, for my father was a Fire Ghost,
  and we of the village of Labala have fought Leopards for a thousand
  years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones knew this was true, and was puzzled how a man from Labala came to be
  in possession of these things; and the order that should have been given for
  instant execution was delayed. In the morning the spies brought news from
  Busuri and the truth was out. Obaga, returning home, found his wife had
  fled.</p>

  <p>That was the story of Obaga. There it would have ended, but for the
  village gossip. This matter of the Leopards cleared up to the satisfaction of
  everybody, save a still form that hung on a tree three miles from the
  village, Bones turned his thoughts to the customs and habits of native
  people. The artist in him had prayed that there would be a fight; the
  administrator in him was heartily glad that the trouble had ended without
  disturbance. Bones had a brilliant idea. He sent for the chief of the Busuri
  village and exhibited to him the camera.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O chief,&rdquo; said Bones, &ldquo;this is a little eye that sees
  and remembers, and it desires to look upon the brave Ochori in battle. Now,
  let your young men play for me, pretending that they are warriors of two
  camps, attacking one another. But this you shall tell them, that if one man
  hurts the other, he shall be whipped,&rdquo; he added hastily, knowing with
  what enthusiasm these spear players entered into the spirit of their
  exercise.</p>

  <p>On the lower deck of the <i>Zaire</i> a troubled Sergeant Ahmet took
  counsel with a number of his comrades.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let no man speak to Tibbetti and tell him that I have turned the
  handle, that your faces should be in this wonderful box,&rdquo; he said. For,
  in Bones&rsquo; absence, he had that day photographed his self-conscious
  soldiery. &ldquo;To-morrow morning, when it is light, I myself will get the
  pictures out of the box, for Tibbetti has told me, that all that is within
  there he will see. And I am a full sergeant, and he may take my stripes
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the light of the early morning sun, under the curious and interested
  eyes of his friends, he opened the camera and looked carefully, unrolling the
  film foot by foot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, God be thanked!&rdquo; said Ahmet in his relief. &ldquo;For it
  seems that I did not take your picture at all. There is nothing there but
  yellow ribbon. Let us roll it up again, so that Tibbetti shall not
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The preparations for the great battle picture were made on an
  unprecedented scale. Bones rehearsed and rehearsed until his shirt stuck to
  his body, and then rehearsed again. And all the women and children of the
  village stood round, their fingers to their teeth, and watched the producer
  at work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not there, you silly old ass!&rdquo; screamed Bones in strident
  English. &ldquo;Get over there, you silly old josser! Not there, go there!
  No, not there! Oh, you ditherer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These and similar injunctions, made the confused native a little more
  confused, and it is probable that the battle picture would never have been
  taken but for certain unforeseen circumstances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, all men go away, so that there is nobody in sight. And then
  you shall come from here, and you from there, and fight, and when I run to
  you and say &lsquo;Stop&rsquo; you shall all lay down your spears.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the moment the actors withdrew, ready for the mimic battle, Obaga came
  swiftly along the forest path, and with him his brother and his ten kinsmen
  and their kinsmen by marriage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, where is my woman?&rdquo; said Obaga, and he addressed the
  tall lover of M&rsquo;Libi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who knows, hunter?&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know now, but how long will you know?&rdquo; said Obaga, and
  struck with his spear.</p>

  <p>His enemy twisted slightly, took the cut across his shoulder and ran.
  Obaga&rsquo;s spear brought him to the ground. And in a second there was
  war.</p>

  <p>Into the open they came, cutting, parrying, thrusting, yelling those
  shrill cries, meaningless but ominous, which the Ochori have screamed
  throughout ages.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stick it!&rdquo; yelled Bones. &ldquo;Turn the handle, Ahmet.
  That&rsquo;s good! Go it, boys!&rdquo; he shrieked in his best
  producer&rsquo;s style. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, a little more to the left.
  Don&rsquo;t hurt yourselves, you silly old jossers!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then in Bomongo he roared!&mdash;&ldquo;I come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He strode with a dignified and picturesque swing of his shoulders into
  their midst, and raised his hand in a lordly gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried. But they did not stop. A spear knocked his
  helmet off, a war club brought him to his knees. Bones reached for his gun,
  but he had not come armed, Fortunately, Sergeant Ahmet had...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought it was a bit too realistic,&rdquo; explained Bones, who
  had spent the morning admiring his bandaged head in a looking-glass.
  &ldquo;But, of course, I never dreamt that there was a jolly old war on. And
  when you come to think of it, dear old Ham, it wasn&rsquo;t half a bad
  stunt&mdash;my being knocked out. It&rsquo;ll look so wonderfully
  thrillin&rsquo; that people will just sit tight in their jolly old seats and
  howl! I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s in all the papers, dear old Ham,&rdquo; he
  went on. &ldquo;The jolly old <i>Times,</i> and the dear old
  What-you-may-call-&rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones spent the night in a dark and smelly hut, illuminated only by a
  faint red glow from his developing lamp. But though he covered himself from
  head to foot in hypo, though he dipped and dipped the film until his arm
  ached, and conformed faithfully to every law contained in the book of
  instructions, he produced nothing but a succession of little black oblong
  blobs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most extrordinary, dear old boy,&rdquo; he said miserably.
  &ldquo;Most amazing! Can&rsquo;t understand it, dear old thing. There&rsquo;s
  a fortune gone west, ab-so-lutely west!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who turned the handle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahmet. I taught him, dear old Ham. Taught him, and he did what I
  told him to do. That&rsquo;s the horribly hideous part of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For all his faith in Ahmet, he interviewed that gentleman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t open the little door, of course, Ahmet?
  The-door-that-must-never-be-opened?&rdquo; he asked solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I opened it, but only for a little time, whilst I looked for
  some pictures which I had improperly taken, without your lordship&rsquo;s
  knowledge. But they were not there&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In daylight did you open it?&rdquo; asked Bones in horror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, lord, in sunlight,&rdquo; said Ahmet, &ldquo;but there was
  nothing there, as I have told your lordship, only a yellow ribbon and no
  pictures!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Aug
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">MEN lie with a certain transparent simplicity in the lands
  that border the Great River. Their falsehoods are easily detected, and are
  less falsehoods than inventions, being so elaborated and painted in such
  primitive colours that no man is deceived.</p>

  <p>For they lie as children lie, about remarkable things and happenings that
  could not be: such as two-headed dogs that spit smoke, and trees that walk
  about, and little bees that fall in love with beautiful maidens. If they lie
  for safety or business purposes, they do so haltingly or sullenly, as the
  circumstances command, and are to be brought to the frank truth with a sharp
  word.</p>

  <p>Such a liar as Lujaga, the petty chief of the Inner N&rsquo;gombi, was a
  rarity, and he was one of three men who, in twenty years, completely deceived
  Mr. Commissioner Sanders.</p>

  <p>And talking of liars...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot about you, Bones,&rdquo; said Hamilton,
  &ldquo;that reminds me of the Isisi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old officer,&rdquo; murmured Bones reproachfully, &ldquo;why
  compare a jolly old comrade to the indigenous native?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking more particularly of your interesting contribution
  to the <i>Guildford Times</i>&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>He was sitting on the verandah after tiffin, smoking a lazy cigar, and as
  he stretched out his arm, he picked up from the floor a newspaper that had
  come by the mail. Bones glanced at the title and shuffled his big feet
  uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old officer,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going
  to spring on me a little flight of fancy, a jolly old <i>jeu
  d&rsquo;esprit,</i> so to speak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been reading your account of how you chased the wild okapi
  through the forest,&rdquo; said Hamilton relentlessly, &ldquo;and how, when
  it was at bay, it turned and snarled at you. The okapi doesn&rsquo;t live in
  this country anyway, and if he did he wouldn&rsquo;t snarl. He would neigh or
  he would bray. Possibly he would bray, recognising you as a man and a
  brother, but he would not snarl or, as you suggest, show his fangs. He
  hasn&rsquo;t any fangs to show, though I dare say he could pick up a few in
  his travels if he had the mind of a collector.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders strolled out at that moment and stood, an interested listener, in
  the doorway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old Ham,&rdquo; begged the agitated Bones, &ldquo;why pursue
  the jolly old subject?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; said the remorseless Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;As the okapi swung round and faced me I reached for my
  rifle! It was not there! My terrified native bearer had bolted! I was alone
  in the jungle with a fierce okapi! He leapt at my throat! I dodged him! In
  that moment all my past life swam before my eyes! Whipping out my revolver, I
  fired at him twice! He fell lifeless at my feet!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton glared over the top of the paper &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; he said
  simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old sceptical superior,&rdquo; said Bones, speaking with a
  certain dignity, &ldquo;you seem to forget the colourless lives that the
  jolly old Guildfordians live. As a matter of fact, they wrote and asked me to
  give them a little story of adventure for their Christmas number.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That makes it more understandable,&rdquo; said Hamilton. &ldquo;You
  tried to write a fairy story. Well, you succeeded. But you&rsquo;re showing
  up the service, Bones. An officer in these territories ought at least to know
  that the okapi is something between a donkey and a zebra, and that he
  wouldn&rsquo;t show fight even to a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He picked up another newspaper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who sends you these infernal things?&rdquo; asked Bones irritably.
  &ldquo;Bless my jolly old life,&rdquo; he added a little incoherently,
  &ldquo;is there nothing sacred, nothing private? Can&rsquo;t a
  fellow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing sacred about the twopence I paid for this
  newspaper,&rdquo; said Hamilton. He opened the pages with exasperating
  leisure, and Bones writhed, &ldquo;Here is the second part of the serial. I
  won&rsquo;t read it all, It is headed&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at the top of
  the column&mdash;&ldquo;A Fight with Vampires.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any unpleasantness,&rdquo; said Bones,
  but Hamilton was not to be denied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the bit I like best!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At night I was awakened&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the way, they&rsquo;ve corrected your spelling, I
  observe&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;&mdash;by a shrill, whistling sound and a sense of keen pain
  in my toe. Looking up, I saw a huge, shadowy shape floating at the foot of my
  bed. It was a vampire! Not daring to move, I watched, fascinated, the hideous
  animal&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should have said &lsquo;bird,&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured Bones,
  &ldquo;or perhaps &lsquo;reptile.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or &lsquo;fish,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested Hamilton. &ldquo;But
  don&rsquo;t interrupt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Its baleful eyes were fixed on me like two green moons! I
  reached out my hand stealthily&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ve only put two l&rsquo;s in
  &lsquo;stealthily,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Bones with a cough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I reached out my hand stealthily,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hamilton
  went on, &ldquo;&rsquo;and seized a pistol that lay on the bedside table! It
  was not loaded! What should I do? With all my strength I hurled myself upon
  the dreadful insect&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Sanders&rsquo; long chuckle of delight which interrupted the
  reading.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, you&rsquo;re really wonderful,&rdquo; he said, as he came
  forward and pulled up a chair. &ldquo;I presume it was our visit to the Isle
  of Bats which inspired that classic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the Middle River, four days&rsquo; steaming from head-quarters, is a
  long island where the bats live by day, hanging in huge clusters, not by the
  thousand but by the million; and Bones and he had spent an eerie evening
  watching these things of the night wake to life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Hamilton as he folded the paper,
  &ldquo;is or is not a man who writes that kind of stuff a natural liar; and
  has or has not Bones the Isisi mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Isisi mind is the mind of a poet, Bones,&rdquo; said Sanders,
  &ldquo;and if I were you I&rsquo;d plead guilty. Whilst on the subject of gay
  deceivers, may I mention that I shall want you to go up into the Inner
  N&rsquo;gombi to-morrow perhaps&mdash;perhaps not for a week or so? There is
  a brand new cult come into being, and one Bobolara is its prophet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked up quickly. &ldquo;Leopards?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head. &ldquo;Not Leopards this time. It is something
  with a little witch doctorery in it, and I want it checked before it goes any
  farther. A healer of healers is amongst us, and he has made his appearance,
  of all places in the world, in the Inner N&rsquo;gombi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a time when the Inner N&rsquo;gombi were a thorn in the flesh of
  administration. Loyal to none, responsible only to themselves, they took toll
  of their neighbours with freedom and violence. There had been a hanging or
  two, a few beatings, a chief deposed to the Village of Irons, a headman
  hunted into the bush, a village or two burnt, before Lujaga, son of Lofuru,
  had been elevated to the chieftain&rsquo;s rank, and thereafter all trouble
  had ceased. It is true that his neighbours complained of midnight raids upon
  their property; a few women had disappeared from the Ochori; and Bosambo had
  carried his spears to the border. But Lujaga, summoned to palaver, had given
  a very frank explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my people are a haughty and warlike
  people, who have never been yoked. And there are little chiefs who call me
  king in a small voice, and call themselves master loudly. The Ochori women
  were taken by a small chief, who carried them into the forest. My young men
  are at this moment trailing him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Similarly, when six canoes of the Upper Isisi had vanished <i>en route</i>
  to head-quarters, carrying the rubber which formed their contribution to the
  revenue, Lujaga had been quick to detect the culprits. He came personally to
  the end of the river with more than half of the stolen property.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bring no heads,&rdquo; he said significantly, &ldquo;for it is
  your will, Sandi, that there shall be no killing. But when thieves fight for
  spears, shall we clap our hands and laugh? There are bad men in the forest by
  the river, and these went out and held up the Isisi canoes, killing the
  paddlers. Now, what is your will?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Proof after proof of Lujaga&rsquo;s honesty came to Sanders. Once, the
  first news of a raid on the Isisi came from Lujaga himself, and with it two
  men captured by the king&rsquo;s soldiers&mdash;silent, pained men, who did
  not speak because their tongues had been cut out, a fault to which Lujaga had
  frankly confessed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fighting men have their ways, lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot
  hold my young men in the heat of battle, for they are savages, but the men
  who did this have been whipped and burnt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paid his taxes regularly; his villages that fringed the
  river&mdash;for, though his territory in the main lay in the inner forest, it
  extended to the banks of the water&mdash;were models of order and cleanliness
  His spies brought invaluable news from the frontier, and he made no
  complaints against his neighbours.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lujaga is a model chief,&rdquo; said Sanders, not once but many
  times, and he showed him certain favours, such as remitting portions of his
  taxation and giving to him hunting rights within the no-man&rsquo;s-land that
  ran to the borders of the French territory.</p>

  <p>Only one man had ever attempted to undermine Sanders&rsquo; faith in the
  chief, and that man was Bosambo, king of the Ochori. Bosambo trusted few and
  respected nobody. One day he came to the headquarters with a long story of
  raids, of forest rights violated, of women and goats that had disappeared
  from a frontier village, and Sanders listened patiently, putting in his
  discounts at various stages of the narrative, and in the end, gave
  judgment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;News of this shall go to the Lujaga.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
  chief will find the men who did this, and your women and goats shall come
  back to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All?&rdquo; said the sceptical Bosambo. &ldquo;Lord, I do not doubt
  that Lujaga will return one woman in three and one goat in six, for that is
  his way. All the rest you will find in the compounds of his secret city. For
  this man is a liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is not?&rdquo; asked Sanders, and there the palaver ended.</p>

  <p>They called the city of the king &ldquo;secret&rdquo; because it was
  tucked away in the heart of a dense wood twelve hours from running water, and
  therefore hard to come by. In his secret city lived Bobolara, the Healer, one
  who was known beyond the confines of his own territory. He was a tall man of
  singular beauty and character, and as a child he had performed many miracles,
  for he had rubbed sick men on the back and they had recovered; and he had
  taken away terrible headaches by twisting the neck of the sufferer in a
  peculiar and mysterious way. When a tree fell upon a woodman and put out his
  shoulder, and a palaver of the village elders had condemned the man to death,
  because the misshapen are never tolerated, Bobolara had by his magic twisted
  the shoulder back into its place, so that in a week the woodman was about his
  business again.</p>

  <p>He lived in a little hut at the far end of the main village street, and
  was accounted peculiar in that he had neither wife nor love affair. When he
  walked past the huts on an evening, he glanced neither to the right nor to
  the left, and no married woman turned her guilty eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>The king Lujaga knew him by name, and one turbulent and stormy night had
  sent a messenger to his hut, bidding him come. Bobolara came to the
  king&rsquo;s great hut, and beheld a girl lying on the floor of the hut,
  moaning her terror, half mad with fright and bleeding from a wound in the
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This woman I took from an Ochori hut,&rdquo; said Lujaga,
  &ldquo;and one of my soldiers speared her. I have given him to death, but
  this woman must be saved, for she is very beautiful and I desire her for my
  house. Now, take her to your hut, Bobolara, and by your magic heal her, and
  in three and three days bring her to me full of love and in some respects as
  she is to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bobolara had the girl carried to his hut and tended her wound, and in
  three days she had recovered her sanity, and Bobolara had learnt to pity
  which in all peoples is half way to love, On the sixth day the king sent his
  familiar, a small man called Ligi, to bring his bride to the great feast
  which he had prepared in the centre of the city. Here, before his hut, he had
  assembled his dancing girls and his warriors for the ceremony of betrothal.
  But Bobolara came alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the woman ?&rdquo; asked Lujaga.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is with her people,&rdquo; said Bobolara calmly. &ldquo;For,
  king, this woman does not belong to us, and I have set her free. I guided her
  myself through the forest by night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was some time before Lujaga recovered from the shock, and then he
  struck the man across the face with his whip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O dog,&rdquo; he howled, &ldquo;this night you shall live with
  ghosts Take this man to the Little People!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They seized Bobolara and carried him into the forest near the great
  anthills, and there they spread-eagled him out on the ground, naked as he was
  born, and from each anthill was laid a sweet and syrupy trail that would lead
  the Little People to the prostrate figure. And there they left him for the
  ants to take him, little by little, until nothing but his bones were left. In
  the morning, when they came to see what was left, they found him asleep. The
  ground was black with ants, but none had touched him. So they released
  Bobolara and brought him back to the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bend a sapling,&rdquo; snarled Lujaga.</p>

  <p>They pulled down a young tree with a rope and tied the free end to the
  neck of the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strike,&rdquo; said Lujaga, and the executioner raised his curved
  knife to strike Bobolara&rsquo;s head from the body.</p>

  <p>Before the knife could fall the executioner had stumbled in a fit to the
  ground, and no one dared take up his knife when the king ordered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is clear to me,&rdquo; said the chief counsellor of the king in
  a troubled voice, &ldquo;that Bobolara has a powerful ju-ju. Now, let him go,
  Lujaga, for I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Therefore was Bobolara permitted to live, for the king feared the temper
  of his people. Nevertheless, two nights later he sent his assassins to the
  hut of Bobolara.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring back wet spears and I will make you chiefs of
  villages,&rdquo; he said, but they brought their spears back clean, with the
  story of a demon that guarded the hut of the Healer, a demon with a blue face
  and an owl that radiated fire.</p>

  <p>For another month the Healer was permitted to continue an untroubled
  existence. It is said that he raised the dead, but that is probably untrue.
  He made sick men well; he cured strange sicknesses; he eased women in their
  terrible pain.</p>

  <p>Then a strange thing happened in the secret city. The second counsellor of
  the king died in pain. Bobolara saw the man and guessed the cause, for the
  second counsellor of the king was notoriously at enmity with his master.</p>

  <p>Bobolara made many solitary journeys into the forest in search of rare
  herbs, for he had an instinct for beneficial properties. One day, after the
  death of the king&rsquo;s second counsellor, he saw two men searching at the
  end of the swamp, where many crocodiles live and strange plants grow that are
  to be found in no other part of the country. Watching them idly, as they came
  toward him, bearing in their hands thick branches of a bush speckled red with
  berries, he recognised Lujaga and his familiar, and at the sight of him
  Lujaga&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Healer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, lord,&rdquo; said Bobolara. &ldquo;Is the king a doctor
  that he gathers the little poison berries, that even the great ones of the
  swamp will not eat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I gather them because they are magical, and keep away spirits and
  ghosts,&rdquo; said the king glibly.</p>

  <p>Bobolara said nothing, and the king hated him more.</p>

  <p>Day after day the Healer watched and waited, but no new counsellor was
  taken with a strange sickness. One night the king spoke secretly to his
  man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take this message to Sandi at his fine house by the river,&rdquo;
  he said, and spent the night in giving minute instructions.</p>

  <p>Before the dawn, the king&rsquo;s man was on his way with a little bag of
  white powder hidden in his loincloth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a message from Lujaga,&rdquo; said Sanders one
  morning at breakfast. &ldquo;This infernal Bobolara is raising the dead!
  Lujaga is never an alarmist, but he takes a serious view. A number of men and
  women are disappearing, and he is scared that the Healer is chopping them for
  medicine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him chop, dear old excellency,&rdquo; said Bones.
  &ldquo;I think you can trust me to deal with jolly old birds of that kind.
  I&rsquo;ll have him back by Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And bring back an okapi,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton, &ldquo;and be
  careful he doesn&rsquo;t sting you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones left head-quarters full of energy. With him went Ligi, the
  king&rsquo;s man, and Ligi served him with food. The day was gloriously fine,
  the sky an unclouded blue. The vivid green of the spring foliage, the diamond
  sparkle of the river, the cooling winds that swept down from the mountains a
  thousand miles away, added to the zest of life.</p>

  <p>The next morning Bones did not feel so bright or energetic, although the
  day was as beautiful and the scene was fair. On the third day there was a
  curious buzzing in his ears, his eyes were heavy, and two leaden weights
  seemed pressing on his head. He took ten grains of quinine, and braced
  himself and cursed all fever-bearing mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>He stumbled ashore on the beach of the N&rsquo;gombi territory, his head
  throbbing, hearing the far-away voice of the little chief who greeted him,
  but understanding nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Abiboo, his agitated sergeant, &ldquo;let us go
  back to the beautiful ship, and I will take you to Sandi, for you are a sick
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones grinned foolishly. In the twelve-hour march through the forest there
  was evidence enough that all was not well in the N&rsquo;gombi country. Every
  three miles they found a dead man with a curious marking on his chest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These Bobolara killed,&rdquo; said Ligi, his guide, &ldquo;so that
  he might attain certain power over the people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones nodded stupidly. &ldquo;This is a hanging palaver,&rdquo; he said
  thickly, and stumbled on.</p>

  <p>One night, in a village ten miles from the secret city, when the fires had
  been stirred to flame, and men wandered from family group to group, listening
  here to the stories told a hundred times of old men&rsquo;s valour and young
  men&rsquo;s gallantry, and the women were chatting pleasantly about sickness,
  a stranger strode down the twisting path that leads from the forest, and came
  into the village street, well observed and wondered at. He was tall,
  broad-shouldered and beautiful to see, for his hair was plastered with clay,
  and over his shoulder he wore the new skin of a young leopard. A five-feet
  fighting shield was buckled to his left arm, and in the cunning socket of the
  shield he carried three light throwing spears, the polished heads of which
  glittered in the firelight. Also, to his back was strapped a long bow, the
  wood half covered with monkey-skin. A big hide belt was buckled about his
  waist, and left and right hung two short, broad-bladed swords. On his face he
  wore neither the marks of the Isisi, the Akasava, or the N&rsquo;gombi.
  Ochori they knew he was not, and he carried himself too finely for a man of
  the Lower River tribe, who are humble people.</p>

  <p>Though a stranger, he seemed to know his way, for he walked unerringly to
  the hut of the chief of the village, and him he called by name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kofo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us talk a little while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kofo came blinking from the darkness of his hut and peered across the
  dancing flames of the fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who comes to this grand village and
  speaks to Kofo, who is chief by all rights, and also a man of
  Lujaga?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am from the city,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Men call me
  the Healer,&rdquo; and Kofo&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and he stared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ko,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that is a bad word for me, for
  I thought you lived in the king&rsquo;s hut. Now, what do you want of
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A canoe and ten paddlers; also a headman to be in charge. They must
  carry me through the lakes, for Sandi is on my heels with his
  soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kofo drew a long breath. At that moment a man came running through the
  village street, and at the sound of the swift patter of his feet Bobolara
  turned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Bobolara, I see you,&rdquo; said the runner, halting unsteadily
  before the chief&rsquo;s hut. &ldquo;Now, a bad thing has happened, for
  Tibbetti, who is Sanders&rsquo; son, is dying by poison in the secret city of
  the king, and they say that you have put magic upon him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bobolara looked at the messenger long and thoughtfully, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go back to the secret city,&rdquo; he said simply, and turned and
  went back the way he had come, the messenger at his heels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bobolara, if you go back you die,&rdquo; he wailed, for the people
  of the city loved Bobolara.</p>

  <p>Bones lay upon a skin bed before the king&rsquo;s hut, and the dancing
  flames of the fire showed the white, drawn face of the half-conscious man.
  Grouped about were a dozen tarboshed soldiers, and in the background a
  semicircle of curious, peering faces observed the scene with childish
  interest.</p>

  <p>Abiboo was on his knees by the side of the bed, trying to force brandy
  into the lips of his master, and above all, dominating the scene, the tall
  figure of Lujaga.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now all people see this!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The lord
  Tibbetti came to take Bobolara, who by his magic has stricken the white man
  low. Now, you soldiers of Sandi shall find the wicked Healer, and you shall
  hang him because of his deeds. For Tibbetti is dear to the heart of
  Sandi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So far he got when the interruption came. A man pushed his way through the
  encircling throng, strode swiftly toward the fire, and, seeing him, the
  people gasped and the king&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Bobolara,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;you have come to death,
  for these soldiers will kill you because of the magic you have put upon
  Tibbetti.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let them kill,&rdquo; said Bobolara, &ldquo;but first let me touch
  the lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abiboo&rsquo;s hand dropped upon the butt of the revolver at his belt, and
  his brown face puckered with suspicion and anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for this you shall die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the Healer took no notice, either of the menace or of the gesture.
  Stooping, he lifted the inanimate figure as though it were a child, and, none
  barring him, he carried the unconscious Bones through the throng, Abiboo,
  revolver in hand, following him.</p>

  <p>All night long, in the half-darkness of the hut, Bobolara pummelled and
  massaged, and, squatting in the doorway, Abiboo watched. When the morning
  light came and the weary Healer looked forth, he saw a tree and from the
  branch a long rope dangling. He gazed calmly for a while upon the strange
  sight, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that, soldier?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When Tibbetti dies, you also die,&rdquo; said Abiboo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I shall live,&rdquo; said Bobolara with great calmness,
  &ldquo;though it will be a night and a night before Tibbetti
  speaks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the third morning, in response to an urgent pigeon-post, came Sanders.
  He had steamed all night through the shoals of the river and had made a
  forced march though the forest to the secret city, and, hastily apprised of
  his coming, Lujaga met him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, this is a bad palaver,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Tibbetti,
  it seems, fell under the magic spell of the Healer, and now lies sick to
  death in the man&rsquo;s hut; and because your soldiers are also bewitched by
  him, they sit outside his door and watch Bobolara working his devils into the
  belly of my lord,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders gaped at him. &ldquo;In the hut of Bobolara? What chief are
  you,&rdquo; he asked with asperity, &ldquo;that you allow Tibbetti in his
  hands?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The king made no reply.</p>

  <p>Bones had recovered consciousness that morning, and was being propped up
  when Sanders stepped, with his catlike tread, into the big hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, jolly old excellency,&rdquo; said Bones weakly. &ldquo;Bit
  of fever, dear old sir, Couldn&rsquo;t find Bobolara: the beggar skipped
  before I arrived. Dreadfully sorry, but&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled
  faintly&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any okapi either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad luck, Bones,&rdquo; said Sanders unsmilingly. &ldquo;So you
  missed Bobolara. Did he get away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the beggar got away just before I arrived, but this jolly old
  doctor&rsquo;s looked after me, and a real good chap he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Sanders. He beckoned the Healer outside.
  &ldquo;Speak to me truthfully, Bobolara,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will
  make life easy for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He glanced from the man to the dangling rope and smiled inwardly, guessing
  all that it meant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord what shall I say?&rdquo; said Bobolara. &ldquo;I am a healing
  man, cunning in the ways of pain, and knowing the ways of strange poisons,
  such as the little red berry that grows by the swamp. I have slain none, but
  I have cured many, and if Lujaga hates me he has his reasons. Lord, I think
  your son will live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders inclined his head. &ldquo;Man, if you speak the truth, another man
  lies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me why Lujaga hates you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bobolara hesitated. &ldquo;It was about a woman, lord, who came from the
  Ochori country. She was brought here in a raid by the king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Lujaga?&rdquo; said Sanders sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are many raids,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Sometimes women
  are brought here, sometimes goats. This woman I sent back to her home, which
  is on the edge of the Ochori, and Lujuga would have killed me, but he was
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more of these little red berries,&rdquo; said Sanders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I know nothing of them except that if men eat them they die,
  becoming very sleepy, with terrible pains in the head,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a nod Sanders left him and walked slowly through the village street,
  his head on his breast, his hands gripping his long walking-stick behind him.
  The king watched him apprehensively, but Sanders passed the hut and came to a
  halt at the end of the village street. He beckoned a man to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me Ligi, who is the king&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; he said, and
  they brought Ligi from his hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ligi, you came with my lord Tibbetti in his fine ship?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; said Ligi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And in a day and a day the sickness came to him,&rdquo; said
  Sanders, watching the man closely. &ldquo;Such a sickness as men have who eat
  the little red berries from the swamp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ligi twiddled his bare toes in the dust, a sign of agitation which did not
  escape the Commissioner. He turned his head and called two of his
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take this man and tie him to a tree,&rdquo; he said simply.
  &ldquo;Then you will whip him till he tells all he has to tell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ligi did not struggle in the grip of the tall Kano men, nor was he in the
  mood to be tied to a tree.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I am the king&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I did
  that which he told me to do. Now, I will tell you the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The truth took much telling, and in the end, Sanders sent him on board the
  <i>Zaire,</i> had irons put upon his legs, and then he called Lujaga, the
  king, to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lujaga,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are going a short journey, and I
  hope the pain will be little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you the truth&mdash;&rdquo; began Lujaga, and Sanders
  smiled unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell it to the ghosts,&rdquo; he said, and looked meaningly at the
  tree with the rope.</p>

     id="story09">IX. &mdash; THE WAZOOS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Jul
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN Bones brushed his hair, he made preparations beside
  which the preliminary arrangements of a <i>prima donna</i> were feeble and
  ineffective. Under the broad window of his hut was a dressing table, on which
  stood, in serried ranks, row upon row of bottles containing hair tonics of
  all kinds, cosmetics, fixers, gums, washes and divers other lotions. He had
  two silver-backed brushes on which his monogram was beautifully engraved, and
  a wooden brush that would, at any period of its existence, have welcomed a
  nice hot bath. With this latter, a comb, certain contortions of face,
  bendings of head, pattings and smoothings, Bones made ready his crown for the
  day.</p>

  <p>He had an especial reason for care one bright day in July, for two days
  earlier the mail steamer had brought the Hon. Muriel Witherspan; and Bones
  had fallen in love with her the moment her dainty toot touched the yellow
  beach.</p>

  <p>The Hon. Muriel was the daughter of one Secretary of State and the niece
  of another. She was an artist, who had conceived the idea of making an
  exhibition of native studies; and in course of time, preceded by many
  telegrams, urgent private notes and anxious inquiries from head-quarters, she
  had arrived, to receive a cold, distant and stiffly official welcome from Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders, and the incoherent adoration of Lieut. Tibbetts.</p>

  <p>She was pretty and slim and very capable. Bones thought she was the most
  wonderful woman in the world. She was certainly the most wonderful white
  woman in the territories, for there was no other.</p>

  <p>Sanders and Hamilton were at breakfast with their guest when Bones arrived
  from his toilet. The girl looked up from her plate, surveying the bowing
  newcomer with a cool and harrowing scrutiny, beginning at his neck (which
  made Bones very unhappy, for this portion of his anatomy was the constant
  subject of libel on the part of Hamilton) and ending with his polished
  locks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, honourable miss,&rdquo; said Bones uncomfortably.
  &ldquo;Nothing wrong with my jolly old nut&mdash;nothing offensive to your
  jolly old artistic temperament, my young Academarian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Academician,&rdquo; corrected Hamilton. &ldquo;Sit down and eat
  your breakfast, Bones, and shut up!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking how beautiful you looked,&rdquo; said Muriel, and
  Bones beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not really, dear old miss? I was always considered a pretty old
  baby&mdash;&rsquo;where have you come from dear old baby out of the nowhere
  particular into here&rsquo;&mdash;you know the jolly old hymn, honour able
  young miss? &rsquo;Who gave you those twiddly-twiddly eyes of blue, a jolly
  old angel poked them as I came through.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; gasped Hamilton under his breath. Bones quoting
  poetry always had this effect upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re lovely, Mr. Tibbetts,&rdquo; said Muriel with
  truth, and Bones giggled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a naughty old flatterer!&rdquo; he gurgled. &ldquo;At
  the same time, Ham, old officer, I&rsquo;ve often been mistaken for Henry
  Ainley. It&rsquo;s a fact, dear old thing. I&rsquo;m not sure whether
  it&rsquo;s Henry Ainley or jolly old Owen Nares, but one of those comedians,
  old thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t mean the performing seals?&rdquo;
  asked Hamilton, and Bones closed his eyes in patient resignation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word, dear old miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t profess to be beautiful, but I&rsquo;d pass in a
  crowd&mdash;.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a kick,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if you want to paint me,&rdquo; Bones went on, contemptuous of
  the interruption, &ldquo;well here I am!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d paint him an invisible blue, so that we
  couldn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; said Hamilton, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be rendering
  the community and the Government a great service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very unkind,&rdquo; said Muriel, crumbling her toast,
  her grey, insolent eyes on Bones. &ldquo;Mr. Tibbetts has the perfect Greek
  face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; said Bones with a smirk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His nose is a little too short for the <i>perfect</i> Greek,
  perhaps, but his chin is rather a dream, don&rsquo;t you think, Captain
  Hamilton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you noticed his cheek?&rdquo; asked Hamilton sardonically.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nightmare!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot about Bones that is very picturesque&mdash;let
  it go at that,&rdquo; interrupted Sanders with a smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  rather thin, and his habit of stooping is a little
  unsightly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And his feet are enormous,&rdquo; murmured Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jealousy, dear old thing, jealousy,&rdquo; said Bones testily.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t paint me, dear young honourable miss! I should never hear
  the last of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paint him as a curiosity,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton, &ldquo;and
  leave a light burning over the picture at night. It would keep the most
  hardened burglar at bay,&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones carried off the visitor to give her a few lessons in the art of
  composition. She had chosen the residency garden and that patch of high
  gum-trees by the water&rsquo;s edge&mdash;a perfect retreat on a hot day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll sit over here, dear old miss, you&rsquo;ll see the
  river and that dinky little village. Isn&rsquo;t that fine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly splendid,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Put my
  easel there, Mr. Tibbetts, and will you unfasten my stool? And oh, do please
  go back and get my paints: I&rsquo;ve forgotten them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A dishevelled Bones ran errands for a quarter of an hour, after which the
  artistic Muriel began to paint.</p>

  <p>Stealing forward until he filled the gap between the trees, and,
  incidentally, in the very centre of her picture, Bones folded his arms,
  struck a Napoleonic attitude and waited. He waited for half an hour, and when
  she said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind standing on one side, Mr. Tibbetts? I can&rsquo;t see
  the view,&rdquo; he was pardonably annoyed.</p>

  <p>Miss Muriel Witherspan, in addition to being a painter, had a passion for
  information about native life and customs. In one afternoon she exhausted
  Sanders, in the course of the evening she reduced Hamilton to a nervous
  wreck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this, you see, the Isisis are not exactly the
  same as the Akasavas...No, I don&rsquo;t think they have any special customs,
  y&rsquo;know&mdash;no, they don&rsquo;t eat babies, alive, at least...well,
  why don&rsquo;t you ask Bones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nothing would give Bones greater happiness, he informed his superior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally, dear old duffer, I&rsquo;ve studied the jolly old
  indigenous native more carefully, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can lie better, that is all,&rdquo; said Hamilton with
  asperity. &ldquo;She wants horrific stories about these innocent people, and
  you can invent &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Steady the bluffs, dear old Ham,&rdquo; murmured Bones.
  &ldquo;Steady the bluffs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Buffs, you idiot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only an &lsquo;l&rsquo; of a difference,&rdquo; said
  Bones, exploding with merriment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather good, old Ham?
  Made it up on the spur of the moment, dear old thing&mdash;just come out
  naturally. I must tell dear old honourable miss that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; warned Hamilton
  awfully. &ldquo;Tell her about human sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;L&rsquo; of a difference&mdash;that&rsquo;s good enough for
  <i>Punch</i>,&rdquo; murmured Bones, &ldquo;really awfully good. You said
  &lsquo;Steady the bluffs,&rsquo; and I said...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton left him soaking in the sunshine of his Own approval.</p>

  <p>The next morning Muriel Witherspan heard of the Wazoos. There was no such
  tribe on the river, but he had to fasten his stories to some people or other,
  and she listened open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Tibbetts was telling me how the Wazoos commit suicide by
  burying themselves head down-ward,&rdquo; she said at lunch. And again:
  &ldquo;The Wazoos, Mr. Tibbetts says, live in trees in summer to keep away
  from the mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders blinked, but agreed.</p>

  <p>To the unfortunate Wazoos, Bones affixed the creations of his fancy. On
  their behalf he invented a kingdom (he drew it on the firm sand of the
  beach), and a dynasty beginning with Wog-Wog the First and ending with
  Boo-Bah the Ninth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it, Bones,&rdquo; said Hamilton one morning,
  meeting his subordinate on the parade ground. &ldquo;That lady wants to go to
  Wazooland, and Sanders had to prevent her forcibly from wiring to her lordly
  parent for permission. It only shows what mischief a ready liar can
  make.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; said Bones indignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you do&mdash;Sanders is taking her up to the Ochori, and
  is breaking to her gently the fact that the Wazoos
  <i>ain&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you treacherous old officer hound!&rdquo; protested Bones.
  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand to attention when you speak to your superior officer,&rdquo;
  said Hamilton sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deuced unfair, sir,&rdquo; murmured Bones. &ldquo;Deuced
  unsporting, dear old Judas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Sanders who took her to the Upper River on the <i>Zaire,</i> but
  the chagrin of Bones at being deprived of the privilege of escorting the
  beautiful visitor was relieved when, the day after the departure of the
  chief, a pigeon post came to head-quarters. Taking the little paper from the
  pigeon&rsquo;s leg, Hamilton saw that it was from Sanders and marked
  &ldquo;Urgent.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;SEND BONES INSTANTLY TO LUJAMALABABA BY
  <i>WIGGLE.</i> ARREST AND BRING TO HEAD-QUARTERS SAKA THE WITCH
  DOCTOR.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d better hop,&rdquo; said Hamilton
  thoughtfully. &ldquo;That blighter has been seeing things again.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IN the Akasava country, beyond Lujamalababa, on the farther
  side of the Great Lake, lived Saka, the sorcerer, who was the son of a
  sorcerer and the great-grandson of two others. This magic man had power of
  life and death. He could touch the dead upon their breasts, and they would
  straightway open their eyes and speak. And he could look upon a man or woman,
  and they would disappear and never be seen again. So it was said.</p>

  <p>Once, a petty chief and his tribe, who was a very rich man, went away to
  the Frenchi country to trade skins and ivory, and because he did not trust
  his relations&mdash;as who does?&mdash;he left with Saka all his movable
  wealth, and Saka buried it in his presence beneath the floor of his hut,
  uttering certain incantations which would produce fatal boils upon the neck
  of whosoever disturbed the ground and the small chief went away, satisfied
  that his riches were safe.</p>

  <p>In seven moons he came back and went to the hut of Saka, and they dug up
  the ground, but no treasure was there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ko,&rdquo; said Saka, in cheerful dismay, &ldquo;this is because
  of my magic! For I must have looked too hard at the pretty wonders of yours,
  M&rsquo;guru, and they have gone into nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;guru, who was a trading man and therefore sceptical by nature and
  training, carried his woes to Sanders, and the Commissioner summoned Saka
  before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they tell me you are a great magician,
  and that whatsoever you look upon disappears. I also am a magician, and lo! I
  stretch out my hand, and where is the free man who walks without shackles on
  his legs? He has vanished to my Village of Irons, where bad men labour
  everlastingly for the Government, and even great chiefs are no higher than
  fishermen. Now go, Saka, and look well with your wonderful eyes for the
  treasure of M&rsquo;guru. And because you are magician, I think you will find
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Saka went away, and came back in three days&rsquo; time with the story of
  his discovery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, by the magic of my eyes I have seen all these wonderful
  treasures of M&rsquo;guru. They are buried at three trees by the water, and I
  have dug them up and given them to M&rsquo;guru.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;Saka, I am a man of few
  words and many duties. Do not let me come again to this or that palaver, or
  there will be unhappiness in your hut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He whiffled his cane suggestively, and Saka, who was an imaginative man,
  winced. Thereafter, he did much to establish his fame with his people, though
  all his experiments were not uniformly welcomed. He looked upon the young
  wife of M&rsquo;guru, his enemy, and she too disappeared, and M&rsquo;guru
  shrewdly suspected that she was not buried near the three trees by the water.
  He sent for the sorcerer by virtue of his authority.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Saka, by your magic you shall bring me back my young wife, or I
  shall bind you for Sanders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;guru,&rdquo; said Saka, surprised, &ldquo;I did not know
  that you had a wife; but by my wonderful powers I will find her and bring her
  to your hut, and you will give me two teeth* because of my talk with the
  pretty devils who sit around my bed every night and tell me
  stories.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Teeth = ivory tusks.]</p>

  <p>It happened that Sanders was in the neighbourhood, and the palaver which
  followed was brief and, to Saka, painful. Thereafter, the sorcerer&rsquo;s
  eyes ceased to function.</p>

  <p>Now, Saka was a sour man of middle age; and, like all witch doctors,
  intensely vain, The punishment, no less than the loss of his prestige,
  embittered him; and, being of an inventive turn of mind, he discovered a
  method of regaining the authority which, whilst it did not profit him
  greatly, caused intense annoyance to those whom he chose to regard as his
  enemies. Men and women who came secretly in his hut at night to seek his
  intervention in their affairs, heard of a new and more potent devil than any
  that had come to the Lake country. His name was M&rsquo;lo; he was of
  microscopic size, and worked his mischief from some familiar article of
  clothing where he had lodged himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have fire in your teeth,&rdquo; he said to one supplicant,
  whose swollen jaw and agonised expression were eloquent of his suffering.
  &ldquo;My magic tells me that M&rsquo;lo is working powerfully against
  you.&rdquo; He closed his eyes in an ecstasy of divination. &ldquo;He lives
  in the blue cloth of E&rsquo;gera, the wife of M&rsquo;guru. This you must
  burn. If you betray me to M&rsquo;lo, and he knows I have told you, he will
  kill you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The following morning, the beautiful blue cloth which encircled the figure
  of E&rsquo;gera, principal and favourite wife of M&rsquo;guru, vanished, and
  became a heap of black and smouldering fibre in the recesses of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>To a man whose wife had given him cause for uneasiness (to put the matter
  mildly) he revealed the presence of M&rsquo;lo in the growing corn of an
  enemy&rsquo;s garden, and in the morning no corn stood where the seeker after
  his hateful oppressor had searched.</p>

  <p>He discovered M&rsquo;lo malignly surveying the village from a fire beyond
  M&rsquo;guru&rsquo;s hut, and in the morning it was quenched. And nobody
  betrayed him because of their fear of the parasitical demon. Nobody save a
  spy of Sanders, whose business was to know and tell.</p>

  <p>He had an interview with Saka, posing as a man who had lost a dog, and
  Saka told him of M&rsquo;lo and how the devil might be exorcised by putting
  fire to M&rsquo;guru&rsquo;s hut. This he told because the spy was of another
  village.</p>

  <p>Then on a day came Lieutenant Tibbetts with four soldiers, and they
  carried away Saka the sorcerer to a place where M&rsquo;lo had no
  influence.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IN the blue dusk which immediately precedes the darkness of
  night a white steamer picked her way through the pestiferous shoals that
  infest the river opposite the village of Lugala, and all the people of the
  village came down to the beach, hopeful that something would occur to afford
  a subject for gossip during the remaining hours of the night, they being
  great storytellers and immensely credulous. Heavy rains had fallen; the
  shallow bed had silted up; new sandbanks had appeared where deep channels had
  run before; and the prospect of sensation was not unjustified.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the possibility which heavy rains and shifting sands may
  bring, the navigator of the steamer came at full speed, a fierce light of
  resolve in his eye, and the greater half of a banana occupying the cavity of
  his mouth. In the bow of the <i>Wiggle</i> a Kano boy plied a long stick,
  thrusting it into the water and relating his discoveries in a whining
  monotone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fathom and half a fathom,&rdquo; he droned, and then: &ldquo;A
  fathom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Wiggle</i> thudded into something soft and, partly yielding, swung
  broadside to the stream, and stopped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woof...umph...hgg!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones&rsquo; natural expression of horror and amazement was somewhat
  distorted by the banana. He swallowed hastily and nearly choked, and
  then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ten and ten fools!&rdquo; he snapped, glaring down at the
  perfectly innocent sounding boy. &ldquo;Did you not say a fathom and a fathom
  and a half and here is my fine ship upon the banks!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, there is not a fathom and a fathom and a half here,&rdquo;
  said the sounding boy calmly. &ldquo;When I spoke we were in such water. Now
  we are on the sand. It is the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones uttered an impatient tut and looked round. The night had come
  instantly. From the shore he saw the flicker of fires burning before the
  villagers&rsquo; huts, but knew there was no man of the Isisi who would come
  out to the rescue of the ship, since that implied standing waist-high in a
  river infested by crocodiles, in order to lift the <i>Wiggle</i> to deep
  water.</p>

  <p>He was safe enough until the morning, for the pressure of the current
  would keep the <i>Wiggle</i> fast to the bank. But between safety and comfort
  was a wide margin. The floor of his sleeping cabin canted over to an angle of
  thirty degrees. It was impossible either to sit or lie in comfort. Bones
  ordered out the boat, and had himself rowed to the shore.</p>

  <p>That he was expected, he knew before the watch fires began to blaze on the
  beach. There was a crowd of 500 people waiting to receive him&mdash;Lugala
  had a population of 506 people, but six were too old or ill to journey to the
  beach. Borobo, the chief offered him salt and apologies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, there are many crocodiles in the river in these days of the
  year. Yesterday they took a woman from the village of Gobini whilst she was
  washing her baby on the shore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chief, have no fear. I come with peace in my heart,&rdquo; said
  Bones magnificently, and stalked up the village street to the guest-house,
  which was ready for him, the chief having sent secret word that his rare
  dogs, which were usually kennelled here, should be ejected.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Tibbetts&rsquo; own cook came ashore and prepared him his evening
  meal, which Bones ate before an audience of 503, three of the infirm and aged
  being carried out from their huts to witness the amazing spectacle of a man
  sticking a silver spear in his mouth at irregular intervals.</p>

  <p>("It is said,&rdquo; whispered one awe-stricken gossip to another,
  &ldquo;that Tibbetti cannot use his fingers because they were bitten by a
  snake when he was young.&rdquo;)</p>

  <p>When, later in the evening, tidings came to Bones that the <i>Wiggle</i>
  had assumed an even more alarming angle, he ordered all men ashore, and Saka
  was placed under guard in a hut at the end of the village.</p>

  <p>Now, Saka&rsquo;s fame was not limited to his own country. He enjoyed, in
  the regions beyond the frontier of Lujamalababa (or Lugala as it was
  sometimes called), a reputation which was the envy of many local medicine
  men, who very properly depreciated his powers. For that is the way of the
  world, black or white, that small men enhance their reputations by
  depreciating their betters. And from Bones, the centre of interest, as the
  night wore on, became, not the hut in which he was lodged and sleeping,
  noisily, but the larger hut where the philosopher of a foreign people spoke
  wisdom and initiated the village of Lugala into the mysteries and
  eccentricities of M&rsquo;lo, the invisible.</p>

  <p>And nobody was more interested than the Houssa sentry who was placed over
  him, for he was of the Kano people, who believe that his family was under the
  especial care of a red and green snake, the red half of which was male and
  the green half female, and he never went to bed at night without placing a
  bowl of water near his head, that this especial demon should not grow
  thirsty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring to me,&rdquo; boasted Saka, &ldquo;those who are dead, and I
  will make them alive, through the wonder of M&rsquo;lo, who is so small that
  his village is beneath the foot of an ant! And none can see him save only
  Saka, who has eyes more wonderful than crocodiles and brighter than leopards.
  And this little devil of mine is in this village. He sits on the leaf of a
  tree to make your head ache, O man-with-the-wire-about-your-head; and he sits
  on the top of a cooking-pot and whispers evil words into the ears of your
  wives as they boil the fish. But most terrible is he when he dwells in the
  clothes of white men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My daughter has pains in her stomach, Saka,&rdquo; said a man,
  edging forward. &ldquo;Also, my garden grows no corn; and monkeys have eaten
  my wonderful long yellow fruit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is M&rsquo;lo who has done this,&rdquo; said the other
  complacently, and screwed up his eyes. &ldquo;I see him! He is in the white
  man&rsquo;s clothes. Now, tomorrow morning Tibbetti will go down to the river
  and wash himself all over, in the manner of these people. Take, then, all of
  his clothing, also the little silk shirt with hollow legs that he wears in
  his sleep&mdash;these you will find by the shore; and put wood under them and
  burn them, and I will send M&rsquo;lo to another village.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Saka, if you do this,&rdquo; said a troubled patient,
  &ldquo;he will whip us, being a cruel man. Also, Sandi is within a
  day&rsquo;s march, and he will come with his soldiers and chastise us, as he
  did in the days of the war, when he hanged my own father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who shall chastise you most?&rdquo; demanded Saka, oracularly.
  &ldquo;This Sandi, who is only a man, or M&rsquo;lo, who is a god and a devil
  and a ju-ju and a ghost, all in one? Who shall save your village from
  burning, and your young maidens from serious trouble, and your wives from
  fickleness? Only M&rsquo;lo, who is so small that he may cook his dinner in
  the eye of a mosquito, and that terrible bird shall not feel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said an aged man, shaking his head in fear, &ldquo;we
  were a happy people till you came, for we knew nothing of M&rsquo;lo, having
  our own devils, as our fathers had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To know is to suffer,&rdquo; said Saka, truly and cryptically.
  &ldquo;If you will not do these things for me, then you must pass, as many
  villages have passed. For what did I see on the other bank of the river but a
  village that was not? And the elephant grass is growing amidst the roof
  trees, and the graves of the dead&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ten miles up the river was a village in which beri-beri had appeared,
  wiping out such of the population as would not flee before the scourge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who broke down the wails and rotted the
  roofs?&mdash;M&rsquo;lo,&rdquo; chanted Saka. &ldquo;And now he has come
  here, and I fear you will all die...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones gave an order that he was to be called early. He had hailed with joy
  the excuse for breaking the journey, for he was most anxious to meet the Hon.
  Muriel Witherspan on terms that were complimentary to himself, and the
  <i>Zaire</i> was due that day, the chief told him&mdash;and he knew, for the
  <i>lokali</i> had been beating the news through the night. Bones, the
  subordinate of head-quarters, was not the Bones in command of an important
  and special mission. It was only fair that she should know this. She might
  even find an inspiration in this new view of him.</p>

  <p>He imagined the picture of the year at the Royal Academy: a stern,
  handsome young officer, his sword girt to his waist, his sun helmet pushed
  back to show the almost Grecian nose and the perfect chin of a born
  commander. He was standing in the white African sunlight, his hands resting
  lightly on the barrel of a Hotchkiss gun; in the background, an infuriated
  mob of indigenous natives, whose bloody spears and blood-curdling yells
  failed to shake the courage of this cynically smiling young man. (Bones had
  practised the cynical smile for days.) And the picture would be called,
  simply: &ldquo;An Empire Builder,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Iron Hand and the
  Velvet Glove,&rdquo; or something similarly appropriate.</p>

  <p>He had neither the time nor the necessary apparatus to do his hair as he
  would like it to be done, but that was a pleasure in store; Abiboo had
  brought him the intelligence that the <i>Wiggle</i> was free from the sand
  shoal, and was riding at anchor in the clear waters beyond.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the men on board,&rdquo; said Bones briskly. &ldquo;We will
  not sail for an hour or two. I must overhaul the machinery,
  Abiboo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abiboo went and collected his prisoner and men, shipped them on board and
  sat down to wait. Bones shaved with the greatest care with a safety razor,
  and, slipping a dressing-gown over his pyjamas, he shuffled down to a
  secluded cove in the river for his morning bath.</p>

  <p>The idea of being depicted in the Academy was an enthralling one. The fact
  that Miss Muriel Witherspan did not exhibit in the Academy, or anywhere else
  that made superlative merit a test for exhibition, did not occur to Bones. He
  saw himself walking before the picture of the year, viewing it with a quiet,
  quizzical, self-deprecatory smile, and stroll away, followed by turning heads
  which whispered: &ldquo;That is he! Tibbetts, the Empire Builder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was so absorbed with this picture that he stood for some time
  breast-high in the water, staring solemnly at the <i>Wiggle</i> in
  midstream.</p>

  <p>The picture of the year! And why shouldn&rsquo;t she paint it? She seemed
  a very intelligent young woman, her paint-box was almost new, and must have
  cost a lot of money. And, anyway, painting was only a question of putting the
  right colours in the right places.</p>

  <p>With a long and ecstatic sigh he turned and swam through the shallow
  water, and came, pink and dripping, to a patch of grass where he had left his
  clothing and a towel. But even the towel was gone. His pyjamas, jacket, and
  trousers had vanished. His slippers, however, he found.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; yelled Bones, wrathfully, and the echoed
  &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; that came back to him from the wood had the quality of
  derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious heavens alive!&rdquo; said Bones aghast. He was
  not three minutes walk from his hut, but there was no way of reaching that
  shelter without passing through the village street.</p>

  <p>Bones looked round helplessly for leaves, having a vague recollection that
  somewhere or other he had read of somebody who had formed an extemporised
  costume from this flimsy material. But the only leaves in view were the
  smallest leaves of a gum-tree; and Bones remembered he had neither needle nor
  thread.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he yelled again, purple in the face, but there was no
  answer.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at the boat. The current was running swiftly, but he
  was a good swimmer, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>He saw a swirl of water, the comb of a rugged back, as a crocodile swam
  down river. It passed, only to turn in a wide circle and swim up again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, confound and dash it!&rdquo; wailed Bones. &ldquo;Go away, you
  naughty old crustacean!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He meant &ldquo;silurian,&rdquo; but it did not matter.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but to make a dive for his hut, and he edged
  cautiously forward down the little path to the village, and presently came
  within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the nearest hut, A woman passed down to the
  river with a stone jar on her head. Bones gazed enviously at the grass kilt
  she wore. Nobody else came into view, and he crept nearer to the hut, and,
  flattening himself against the rush walls, peeped into the interior. It was
  empty, and he dashed inside.</p>

  <p>But it was not literally empty: stretched on two pegs was one of those
  identical kilts he had envied&mdash;a kilt made of long, pliant grass fixed
  to a string. And the maker had evidently just completed her labour, for the
  last strand of grass was not tied. Bones snatched the kilt from the wall and
  wrapped it round him. It had evidently been intended for a lady of more
  generous proportions, for the kilt passed twice round his body before it met.
  There was nothing left but to march up the street. The horrified people of
  Lugala gathered at the doors of their huts to see the strange and even
  appalling sight; but Bones, mindful of his dignity, screwed his eyeglass in
  his eye&mdash;thank heaven unknown robbers had not stolen that&mdash;and
  walked with majesty the length of the street, apparently oblivious to the
  bewildered or guilty eyes that stared as he passed.</p>

  <p>His servant had gone on board the <i>Wiggle.</i> His host was not in
  sight. Bones dived in and began a frantic search for clothes. They also had
  gone! His bedding had been taken away, his breeches&mdash;everything, indeed,
  except a short silk singlet which seemed, in all the circumstances,
  inadequate.</p>

  <p>Bones put his head out of the door and yelled for the chief, but there was
  no response. Not that Borobo did not hear him. Indeed, he took trouble to
  explain to his impressed wives what the commotion was all about.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Lord Tibbetti sings every morning, being a young and joyous
  man. Now listen to his beautiful voice. Such is singing in the way of his
  people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens and Moses!&rdquo; gasped Bones when no succour came, and he
  was on the point of stepping out, made shameless by his misfortune, when a
  familiar sound came to his ear. It was the &ldquo;honk honk!&rdquo; of the
  <i>Zaire&rsquo;s</i> siren. Bones sat down and wiped his forehead. Sanders
  was here! And Hamilton, whom he had dropped at the mouth of the Isisi River
  to meet Sanders. And the Hon. Muriel! There was a scamper of feet past the
  door of the hut. All the village was tearing down to the beach to welcome the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>Bones waited till he thought the coast was clear, then stepped out of the
  hut. There was a shriek from the girl attending a cooking-pot before the
  chief&rsquo;s hut, and he dashed back again. He must be dreaming he thought;
  pinched himself&mdash;and it was so easy to pinch himself&mdash;to make sure,
  and he had very convincing proof that he was awake.</p>

  <p>He waited, every second an hour, every minute an eternity, and then there
  came to him the voice of Sanders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is the chief&rsquo;s hut, Miss Witherspan, and this hut near
  is the guest-house. You&rsquo;d better look inside the guest-house: it is
  less objectionable than the others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a patter of light feet, and Bones screamed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep out, honourable miss! Jolly old Muriel, keep out!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that&mdash;Bones?&rdquo; asked Sanders in amazement.
  &ldquo;What the dickens are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo; squeaked Bones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
  no clothes on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Incoherently he told his story. There was a sound of suppressed laughter.
  Of course, Ham would laugh!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, you silly old ass,&rdquo; said Bones wrathfully.
  &ldquo;Go along and get me some clothes, you naughty old captain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had to laugh,&rdquo; said the musical voice of Muriel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens, young miss! Was it you?&rdquo; stammered Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was me. Captain Hamilton has gone down to get you some clothing.
  Can&rsquo;t I just peep in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bones loudly. &ldquo;Have a sense
  of decency, dear old artist!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who did this&mdash;the Wazoos?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a malignity in her cooing voice that made Bones shiver. Hamilton
  had told her! The cad!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now listen, dear old painter and decorator&mdash;&rdquo; began
  Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Tibbetts&mdash;you pulled my leg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be decorous!&rdquo; urged Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You pulled my leg. I shan&rsquo;t forget it. I&rsquo;m coming in to
  sketch you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing on,&rdquo; roared Bones, untruthfully,
  &ldquo;except a pair of slippers and a kilt!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton returned with a mackintosh and a sun helmet, pleading that that
  was all he could raise. The mackintosh was one which was slightly too short
  for Sanders. On the lank figure of Bones it had the appearance of a covert
  coat.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was three months later before the illustrated newspaper
  came into the residency; and, opening it idly, Hamilton saw a picture and
  yelled. It was a black-and-white sketch, which bore in the corner the
  scrawled signature &ldquo;M. W.&rdquo; It showed Bones in all the glory of
  singlet and grass kilt, with a sun-helmet on his head and an eyeglass in his
  eye; and beneath was the superscription: &ldquo;British officer wearing the
  native costume of the Wazoos.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="story10"
     id="story10">X. &mdash; THE ALL-AFRICANS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Jun
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">THE mind of Mr. Commissioner Sanders was as two books, the
  one open for inspection, and, by its very accessibility, defying the
  suspicion that any other could exist; the second a small tome, bound in steel
  and fastened with many locks.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time Hamilton, skimming his newspapers newly arrived from
  home, read something and laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish, dear old officer, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bones
  irritably, glaring up from the torture of simple addition. &ldquo;Just as I
  was totting up the jolly old pay sheet. I&rsquo;ll have to do it all over
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll do it wrong,&rdquo; said Hamilton.
  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take that infernal sheet somewhere else, or learn to
  count to yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way, dear old Ham, and
  that&rsquo;s the right way,&rdquo; he said, and began his labours anew.
  &ldquo;Eight and four&rsquo;s fourteen,&rdquo; he muttered fiercely,
  &ldquo;and nine&rsquo;s twenty-two and three&rsquo;s twenty-five and
  nine&rsquo;s thirty-two an&rsquo; seven&rsquo;s thirty, one, two, three,
  four...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you laughing at?&rdquo; asked Sanders, smoking a
  meditative cheroot, his eyes on the parade ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something in one of the papers about an All-Africa Empire, with an
  army of its own, organized by American negroes and having their
  Inspector-General&mdash;where do they get such rot from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And nine&rsquo;s a hundred and five, and six is a hundred and ten
  and three&rsquo;s ninety-nine...&rdquo; struggled Bones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton sat up. &ldquo;What...? But not here...in the
  territory?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known about it for three years,&rdquo;
  he said with surprising calm, &ldquo;and of course it is inevitable. Clever
  and rich American negroes were certain to exploit Africa sooner or
  later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones had dropped his accountancy, and was listening open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell <i>me,</i> sir an&rsquo; excellency,
  that the jolly old indigenous native is organisin&rsquo;
  a&mdash;a...?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean even to tell you,&rdquo; said Sanders with a smile.
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a French boat calling next week with a man named
  Garfield on board and a lady etymologist from England. She wants to go up
  country to hunt butterflies, and I&rsquo;m rather worried about the
  lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It seemed that Sanders was changing the subject, but that impression was
  to be corrected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones and I will leave to-night,&rdquo; he said, surprisingly,
  &ldquo;and you will send me on the letter she brings&mdash;open and decode
  it, and fly me a pigeon with the gist of it. By the way, she is rather
  pretty, which makes me just a little scared. Yes, the African Empire movement
  is a reality&mdash;I wish it wasn&rsquo;t. Look at Mr. Garfield&rsquo;s
  hands, by the way, particularly his finger-nails. He has the permission of
  Downing Street to explore the country&mdash;hoof him along and tell him
  I&rsquo;m tax-collecting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He got up and walked out of the room, and the two men stared at one
  another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may be sun or it may be fever, dear old Ham,&rdquo; said Bones
  solemnly. &ldquo;And yet he must be right in his head&mdash;he&rsquo;s taking
  me along with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is incredible,&rdquo; said Hamilton, too perturbed to be
  offensive, &ldquo;And yet, when Sanders talks and looks like that...You lucky
  young devil!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Zaire</i> left at sunset, which was unusual, for the river is full
  of shoals and navigation a danger. By night (the third night) Sanders brought
  his steamer to a creek near the village of Kafu...</p>

  <p>And then a whisper ran through the village, a whisper that had a gasp at
  the end, and at that whisper even old men slapped their lean thighs as at the
  prospect of tribulation, and said in dismay,
  &ldquo;Ok&rsquo;ok&rsquo;ok&rsquo;ok a!&rdquo; which is misery&rsquo;s own
  superlative on the big river.</p>

  <p>For a malign miracle had happened, and there had materialised, under their
  very eyes, in shape to be seen and in substance which daring men might feel,
  the most horrific of the river legends.</p>

  <p>Sandi-by-night had come, and Sandi-by-night was a distinct and deadly
  personality. He had arrived from nowhere between sunset and moonrise, and now
  sat before the hut of Molaka the fisherman. Bold men, peering fearfully from
  their little houses, saw him, a stooping figure in a grey-green suit, which
  in the flooding moonlight seemed to possess a radiance of its own. His face
  was in darkness, or the brim of his big helmet threw a black shadow, and,
  moreover, his back was toward the serene orb that touched the fronds of the
  palms with a silver edging.</p>

  <p>Whence he came none knew or troubled to think. For Sandi was well known to
  possess magical qualities, so that he could fly through the air or skim on
  his feet across the water at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>And he had come, not to the chief&rsquo;s hut, but to the humble dwelling
  of this eloquent fisherman, who told such beautiful stories.</p>

  <p>Sandi was talking in liquid Bomongo. &ldquo;Also it seems you have spoken
  to the people of the Forest, Molaka.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, they like my pretty stories,&rdquo; pleaded the man;
  &ldquo;and because I am a poor spearer of fish and desire to please all
  people, I tell them tales, though I am often weary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders chuckled softly. &ldquo;What race are you, Molaka, for I see that
  you have no cuts on your face such as the people of the Middle River make
  upon their children?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am from the Lapori River near Bongunda&rdquo; replied Molaka.</p>

  <p>Again he laughed, this slim figure that crouched on the stool which Molaka
  had brought for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>O Bantu</i>, you lie!&rdquo; he said, and then he spoke in
  English, &ldquo;Your name is Meredith; you arc a native of Kingston, Jamaica,
  and you are a general in the All-Africa Army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are one of five hundred specialists especially trained by the
  Black Africa Syndicate to organise native rebellion,&rdquo; Sanders went on
  in an almost monotonous tone. &ldquo;My men have been watching you for two
  years! You were trained at Louisville College for coloured men for this job,
  and you receive two hundred dollars a month for your services.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><i>"Sic itur ad astra</i>,&rdquo; Molaka quoted with a certain
  smugness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is indeed the way to immortality,&rdquo; said Sanders grimly.
  &ldquo;Now, tell me, my man, when did you last see a Supreme Councillor of
  your pestiferous order?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molaka yawned ostentatiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot afford you
  any information, Mistah&mdash;er&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t the honour of knowing
  your name. I suppose you are Sanders, that these dam&rsquo; niggers talk
  about?&rdquo; (He himself was as black as the ace of spades, though his
  English was excellent.) &ldquo;So far I have had the luck to miss
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing, then: &ldquo;When did you see one of your bosses
  last?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can give you no information,&rdquo; said Molaka, or Meredith,
  rising. &ldquo;I presume you will deport me? I shall not be sorry. I have
  spent two miserable years in this wilderness, and I shall be glad to go home
  to my dear home town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders rose too, and now he towered above the squatting figure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, and strode through the village behind his
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>The people saw them pass, and tapped their teeth in terror, The two men
  vanished into the forest path. At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
  village watchman, dozing over his fire, heard a shriek and leapt up. The cry
  was not repeated, and he went to sleep again.</p>

  <p>In the morning they found a place, just outside the village, where a man
  had evidently been pegged, spread-eagle fashion, to the ground, for the
  thongs that had bound his ankles and wrists were still attached to the peg.
  Also, there were the ashes of a fire and a piece of iron which had been
  heated. From these indications, the men of the village concluded that Molaka
  had been asked questions.</p>

  <p>It is certain that he did not tell Sanders of the great palaver which was
  to be held in the country south of the Isisi River, because the messenger who
  brought him a summons to the <i>likambo</i> arrived after he had
  disappeared&mdash;whither, no man ever knew, though the slaves who toil for
  Government in the Village of Irons might have given information. As to the
  palaver and its venue, Sanders was to make discovery in another way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a man who lived in the country behind Bolibi, who
  was very wealthy. He ate dog every day of his life, and his wives occupied
  seventeen different huts. Therefore they called him
  &ldquo;Jomo-Nsambo,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;ten and seven.&rdquo; His
  plantations of corn and manico covered the land in patches, and in these his
  wives worked constantly. He was a just man and used the <i>chicotte</i> with
  great discernment, never beating even a woman unless she had committed a
  foolish act.</p>

  <p>One day he went hunting with his young men, for, although he was neither
  chief by choice nor Government-appointed <i>capita,</i> he exercised a
  lordship even over chiefs, by reason of his wealth, and crooked his finger
  for all the following he needed.</p>

  <p>Whilst he was in the forest, his tenth wife. N&rsquo;kama, received a
  lover near the Pool of the Skies, which is a dry pan in the summer and a
  marsh in the rainy season, and for this reason is so called.</p>

  <p>The lover was a tall young man and a greatly popular man with women. Yet
  because he loved the tenth wife of Jomo-Nsambo, he was faithful to her for
  one season. His name was Lolango, which in the Bomongo language is &ldquo;The
  Desired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman, I have slept seven nights in this forest waiting for
  you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it is very good to touch you. For two moons I
  have wanted you, as you know, for was I not a guest in your husband&rsquo;s
  hut, and did I not say exciting things to you when he slept? But you have
  been as cold as a dead fish, though I have sent you wonderful words by the
  woman Msaro who is your servant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; she said meekly, &ldquo;I could not believe that the
  Desired would desire. And all the stories Msaro told me I thought were
  foolish. Now I am here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made love to her in his fashion. The woman was wonderful to him, and he
  did not wish to leave her, but because there was a secret <i>likambo,</i> or
  council, in the forest by the Kasai River, and that was a two days&rsquo;
  journey, he must be parted from her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me go with you, Lolango,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for I think
  Msaro hates me, and will speak to my husband when he returns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But this, in terror of death, Lolango would not do.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, in a hushed voice, &ldquo;this likambo is
  &rsquo;Ta&rsquo;.&rdquo; And he made a whistling noise to express the
  awfulness of the occasion, and opened his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>The woman heard the forbidden word without displaying any emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will give you magic to protect you,&rdquo; she said, and he
  waited two hours whilst she returned to her village and brought back a bag
  which was filled with little red berries such as are not seen in this
  country.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These I bought from a white trader,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and in
  each lies a very powerful devil called &lsquo;The Looker-Behind,&rsquo; And
  when you come to the great forest by the Kasai, which, as all men know, is
  full of ghosts, you shall drop a red berry every time your feet say
  <i>bonkama</i>,* And the red devil shall come out and no ghost shall follow
  after you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* = one hundred: that is, every hundred paces.]</p>

  <p>He shivered, but eyed the handful of berries in his palm with
  friendliness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are ghosts of great size and ugliness in the forest,&rdquo;
  he agreed. &ldquo;Now, I love you for this magic, N&rsquo;kama, and I will
  bring back to you a wonderful cloth such as the Jesus women wear to hide
  their skins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So he went away, and she looked after him and spat on the ground. Then she
  bathed her body in the river and walked with swaying hips toward her hut. She
  had done her part and had no regrets, save for the bag of beautiful red
  berries. She would gladly have made a necklace of these. But better he took
  them than that she should tramp two days with him, she thought.</p>

  <p>On the outskirts of the village a man met her. He had the Arab features
  and the Arab litheness of body, but he wore his cloth native fashion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O N&rsquo;kama,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where is the man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has gone, master: also, he has taken the red seeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, N&rsquo;kama, is this man Lolango of the river or of the
  forest people?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, he is of the forest,&rdquo; she said without hesitation,
  &ldquo;for when he spoke of the secret palaver he made the word
  &lsquo;Likambo.&rsquo; Now, we folks of the river say
  &lsquo;Jikambo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man clicked his lips to denote satisfaction, and, putting his hand
  within the cloth, pulled out a thin, long chain of brass studded with
  glittering stones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This from Sandi,&rdquo; he said, and dropped it into her hand.
  &ldquo;Also, if any man or woman speaks evilly of you, you shall say that
  Sandi breaks men easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he strode away from the ecstatic girl, leaving her open-mouthed and
  open-eyed at the treasure in her two hands.</p>

  <p>A canoe was waiting for the Arab at the water&rsquo;s edge, and four
  paddlers took him swiftly with the stream. They rounded the bend of the river
  and set the canoe&rsquo;s nose toward what appeared to be an impenetrable
  barrier of tall elephant grass.</p>

  <p>There was a passage, however, wide enough for their ingress, and even
  wider, for on the far side at the screening grass was the <i>Zaire,</i> on
  the bow of which Sanders sat smoking.</p>

  <p>He turned his head as the Arab came aboard. &ldquo;Hullo, Bones!&rdquo; he
  greeted the &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; in English. &ldquo;Has the woman gone with
  Lolango?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, but he has taken the jolly old beans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded and frowned. &ldquo;Bones, I don&rsquo;t like
  things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never known the people to be so
  uncommunicative. Usually, even over a ju-ju palaver you could find a fellow
  who was willing to open his mouth. But these devils are dumb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood up suddenly as the &ldquo;toot-toot&rdquo; of a steamer siren
  came from the river. It was the little flat-bottomed French coasting steamer
  that occasionally penetrated the river as far as the rapids. Standing on the
  whale deck of the boat so that he could see across the tops of the grasses,
  he focussed a pair of prismatics to his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the French steamer, and unless I am greatly mistaken,
  that is our friend Garfield and the lady etymologist on the after
  deck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is she doing in this country?&rdquo; asked Bones, puzzled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are women doing anywhere?&rdquo; demanded Sanders savagely.
  Then he turned to the pipe-smoking Arab. &ldquo;So Lolanga has gone?&rdquo;
  he said. &ldquo;And the woman&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones spread out his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is an unwholesome business,&rdquo; said Sanders, with a grimace
  of disgust.</p>

  <p>Bones puffed noisily. &ldquo;My dear old excellency,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a wicked lady, and she&rsquo;s got millions of naughty old
  boys anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it is all right,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;but I hate
  the thought of women being employed to trap men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an employment, dear old sir,&rdquo; said the cynical
  Bones, &ldquo;it is a recreation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then, raising his eyes, he saw a pigeon circling and heard the excited
  calls of the grey birds housed in the coop above the deck cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your bird, I think, sir,&rdquo; he said, and whistled the pigeon
  down.</p>

  <p class="first">THE steamer which carried Miss Honor Brent and her companion
  stopped at the village of Bofuru, which is not a regular landing-place.</p>

  <p>Mr. Garfield was a man of fifty. He had a square, white face, and stiff,
  upstanding hair, and it was he who had suggested the landing. The girl who
  landed with him was past her first youth, but pretty, and there was in her
  voice and movement a suggestion of capability which had puzzled her
  companion, for they had been fellow-passengers from London to Sierra Leone.
  Bofuru might be an interesting centre, for her object in coming to the Congo
  (she had said) was to add to her collection of butterflies. Curiously enough,
  Garfield had anticipated her acquiescence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a wonderful part of the river for butterflies,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them ten inches across from wing to
  wing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know the country, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here three or four times,&rdquo; he said,
  carelessly. &ldquo;I am interested in the palm-oil industry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They landed on the slip of beach at a time when the village of Bofuru was
  all agog with awful wonder.</p>

  <p>For days strange men had come down the river in their canoes, had landed
  here, leaving their craft high and dry on the beach, and the villagers
  watched them in awestricken silence. For was not <i>"Ta"</i> abroad? and had
  not secret word run from hut to hut that the Great Ones of the land would
  pass through Bofuru on their way to a <i>jikambo</i> (it is true they use the
  &ldquo;j&rdquo; on the river) of ultra-magnificence?</p>

  <p>The visitors came generally between dawn and the sun-on-the-trees, because
  there was a Government post to pass, and the very furtiveness and secrecy of
  their arrival gave them additional importance. There were solitary paddlers
  and delegates who came in larger canoes with their own paddle-men, there were
  chiefs, great and small, known and unknown, and they went into the forest,
  and the forest swallowed them up.</p>

  <p>The advent of two white visitors was the culminating moment of an exciting
  two days. The villagers stood with folded arms and incredulous faces,
  watching the landing, until Mr. Garfield beckoned his finger at the man who
  appeared, by reason of the medal hung upon his breast, to be chief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>O Bantu</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;prepare a hut for this lady,
  who stays a while, for she is a very clever woman who seeks
  flowers-with-wings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, she shall have the hut of my wife&rsquo;s own Sister,&rdquo;
  said the chief; &ldquo;and if she is a God woman, I will send all my people
  to listen to her beautiful words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is no God woman,&rdquo; said Garfield, and his Bomongo was
  perfect. &ldquo;Now keep her and guard her, and do not let her stray into the
  forest, which, as you know, is full of devils.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He explained to the girl what arrangements he had made for her. Six
  strange carriers had come from the interior to carry his
  luggage&mdash;strange to the people of Bofuru.</p>

  <p>They headed their burdens and marched away with that curious, springing
  pace which is the natives&rsquo; own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will walk to the edge of the village with me?&rdquo;
  said Garfield, and she assented.</p>

  <p>They talked of things and of people, neither of any great importance,
  until they reached the thick bush out of sight of the village. Here the path
  turned abruptly through a forest of great topal trees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll say good-bye,&rdquo; said the girl with a smile.
  &ldquo;I am going to see my hut. You will be returning in four days, you say,
  Mr. Garfield?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be returning in four days,&rdquo; repeated Garfield, and
  looked at her strangely.</p>

  <p>A hint of her danger came to her, but she did not change colour, and not a
  muscle of her face moved as she held out her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Mr. Garfield, and his big hand closed on
  her arm. &ldquo;You will continue the journey, Miss Brent. I don&rsquo;t know
  whether that is your real name, but I am not curious. Your hut has been
  prepared for you, and if you do not go back the natives will understand, for
  this forest is full of treacherous marshes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, and now she was as white as
  death.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was warned before I left New York that an agent of the British
  secret service would come on board at Plymouth,&rdquo; he said, speaking
  slowly, &ldquo;and that that agent would probably be a woman. Any doubt I had
  upon the matter was removed when I searched your cabin on the night of a
  dance we had just outside Madeira. Your instructions were to get into my
  confidence and accompany me so far as it was safe for you to do so. You have
  gone just beyond that point.&rdquo; He smiled, and it was the first time she
  had seen him smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Brent, as you have been instructed to watch the
  Inspector-General of the All-Africa Army, I am going to bestow upon you the
  privilege of being present at a council of war. If you scream I shall
  strangle you until you are silent, and then I shall hand you over to my
  carriers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was breathing quickly. &ldquo;How absurd you are!&rdquo; she said
  bravely. &ldquo;This is a little comedy of yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little tragedy, I think,&rdquo; he corrected her.</p>

  <p>He took her arm and, realising the futility of resistance, she went with
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have not far to go, though our rendezvous will be a difficult
  one for our friend Sanders to find.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no friend&mdash;I have never seen Mr. Sanders,&rdquo; she
  said, and he chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will be a little more talkative later on,&rdquo; he said
  significantly. &ldquo;Mr. Sanders, by all accounts, does not hesitate to
  employ coercive methods when he is anxious to discover something from an
  unfortunate agent of ours who falls into his hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; she cried, for the horror
  of her situation was dawning upon her. &ldquo;I swear I have never met him,
  and that I have no knowledge of his existence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That we shall discover,&rdquo; said Garfield again.</p>

  <p>They trudged along for some time in silence leaving the beaten path and
  following a native guide through the trees.</p>

  <p>The unmarked way was an extraordinarily tortuous one, and the girl
  understood why, when now and again she glimpsed the waters of a great swamp.
  Every two hours they rested, and at the second rest the man gave her
  chocolate and water from the dig skin which hung from the guide&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; She asked, putting into
  words the thought which had occupied her mind all day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After?&rdquo; For the second time he smiled. &ldquo;You will not
  give information to your friend Sanders, that I promise you,&rdquo; he said
  significantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to kill me?&rdquo; she asked wildly, starting
  up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing so unpleasant,&rdquo; he said and offered no other
  information.</p>

  <p>They came at last to the strangest village she had ever seen. A circle of
  new huts evidently built for this convention. The place was alive with
  men&mdash;she saw no women&mdash;who looked at her in wonder as she passed,
  but saluted Mr. Garfield with every evidence of respect and fear.</p>

  <p>They were met outside the village by a native, who spoke English until
  with a sharp word, Garfield silenced him. She was conducted to a hut, and a
  native squatted in front of the door to prevent her escape, and there she sat
  until the night came and the big moon showed through the tracery of the
  trees. She heard movements and caught the reflection of a great fire which
  burnt before a newly-erected palaver-house, and now and now and again she
  heard the sing-song of a man crying &ldquo;Kwa!&rdquo; which meant
  &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and another voice speaking in the Bomongo dialect,
  which she recognised as Garfield&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>And then they brought her out. The pleasant Mr. Garfield she had known was
  not the man who sat on a carved stool under the thatched roof of the
  palaver-house. Except for a cloth wound about his waist, the loose ends of
  which were sewn up over his shoulder, he was as innocent of clothing as any
  of his audience. A strange, obscene figure he made, with his dead-white skin
  and his bristling black hair, and the incongruity of his appearance was
  heightened by the fact that he wore his black-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>At another time she could have laughed, but now she was speechless with
  fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brent.&rdquo; He spoke in English and addressed her by her surname.
  &ldquo;My brethren desire that you should speak and tell them of Sanders and
  the letter you handed secretly to the English officer at the mouth of the
  river.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked round at the scowling faces and past them, in the direction, as
  she guessed, of Bofuru, and he read her thoughts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no escape for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get that out of
  your mind, my friend. No human being could find his way across the marsh even
  if friend Sanders was on hand. Now, you shall tell me&rdquo;&mdash;his manner
  changed suddenly, and his voice was harsh&mdash;&ldquo;where is
  Sanders?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was husky.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will find, a way of making you speak,&rdquo; he answered
  through his teeth, &ldquo;as Sanders made Molaka speak. What was that
  letter&mdash;you know its contents?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no spoken answer. Only there ran through the squatting figures a
  man who crouched, a man in grey-green uniform suit, who came swiftly yet
  stealthily, a long-barrelled revolver in each hand.</p>

  <p>He came from nowhere, but, looking past him with staring eyes, Garfield
  saw the glitter of bayonets, and in the light of the fire, the red fezes of
  Government soldiers, and dropped his hand to where, concealed by his
  waist-cloth, his pistol belt was strapped.</p>

  <p>Sanders fired twice, once from each hand, and the square-faced man stood
  suddenly erect, covering his face with those tell-tale hands of his&mdash;the
  hands with the half-moon nails that betrayed his native origin. Then he as
  suddenly fell, and there was no life in him when Sanders turned him over.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You who are chiefs shall be chiefs no longer,&rdquo; said Sanders,
  sitting in the palaver-house an hour later, and addressing a confused and
  miserable assembly. &ldquo;This is the order of the Government. As to the
  young man who is a foreigner amongst you and speaks English and teaches you
  cunning ways of fighting, he shall hang before you all. This, too, is the
  word of my lords,&rdquo; He paused a moment. &ldquo;Come to me,
  Lolango.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tall native who was called &ldquo;The Desired&rdquo; came forward in
  trepidation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Lolango,&rdquo; mocked Sanders, &ldquo;because you put upon the
  ground red berries which have a great magic, you are pardoned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I did this because of a woman,&rdquo; stammered Lolango.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I know,&rdquo; replied Sanders grimly, and well he knew it,
  for it was by those red berries dropped at intervals that he had found his
  way across the swamp.</p>

  <p>He turned to the white-faced girl by his side. &ldquo;I think, Miss Brent,
  that this is no job for you. I have decided views about the employment of
  women for Secret Service work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect I should have to come so far,&rdquo; said the
  girl ruefully. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did my best to make him talk on the ship, but
  he was very reticent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now he is more reticent than ever,&rdquo; said Sanders.</p>

  <h2><a name="story11"
     id="story11">XI. &mdash; THE WOMAN WHO SPOKE TO BIRDS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Sep
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a man named Pinto Fernandez who was called, by
  courtesy and right, &ldquo;Portuguese.&rdquo; He possessed an indubitable
  title to that description, for he was born a native of Angola, being the
  consequence of a union between a minor official of Sao Paul de Loanda and the
  half-coloured maid to the wife of His Excellency the Governor of Bonguella.
  Even by Portuguese standards, Pinto was &ldquo;dark.&rdquo; It is not
  necessary to trace his career from Loanda to Sierra Leone, nor to mention
  more than this fact, that he took a school certificate at one of Marriott
  Brothers&rsquo; educational establishments.</p>

  <p>His wife was indubitably white. She had been a Miss Hermione de
  Vere-Biddiford, and at one time was partner to Professor Zoobola, the famous
  hypnotist and illusionist, who &ldquo;travelled&rdquo; the coast from Dakfur
  to Cape Town. She spoke with a strong Cockney accent, and her father&rsquo;s
  name was Juggs, so that the balance of probability is weighed toward the
  supposition that Vere-Biddiford was a <i>nom-de-guerre</i> adopted to meet
  the exigencies of a profession which demands classiness.</p>

  <p>Pinto knew the coast backwards. Before he met his wife, left derelict at
  Grand Bassam by a bankrupt professor, he had served terms of imprisonment in
  French, German, Portuguese, and British West African gaols, for divers petty
  larcenies, impersonations, and trickeries. His wife, on the other hand, had
  only twice appeared before a magistrate, on each occasion charged with
  attempting to obtain money by threats.</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Pinto Fernandez met in the waiting room of the
  magistrate&rsquo;s court at Lagos, and were expelled from the country
  together. At Funchal, in the island of Madeira, they were legally married,
  and rented a small house in one of those steep streets down which it is the
  delight of the visiting tourist to toboggan. And there, combining their
  separate understandings of the people and atmosphere of the coast, and aided
  largely by Pinto&rsquo;s command of English, they began operations.</p>

  <p>Nearly twelve months later:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me, dear old centurion,&rdquo; said Lieutenant
  Tibbetts, glaring up from the company clothing accounts, &ldquo;that either
  I&rsquo;m a jolly bad old accountant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that, Bones,&rdquo; said Hamilton soothingly.
  &ldquo;Maybe, as usual, you&rsquo;ve added the day of the month and
  subtracted the year. Or perhaps you&rsquo;ve put the pounds in the pence
  column&mdash;try again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones sighed wearily and passed his hand before his eyes. Hamilton could
  not guess what black despair lay in the heart of his subordinate.</p>

  <p>The day was swelteringly hot and the breeze that crawled through the open
  window of Bones&rsquo; hut came from landward and had the fragrance and
  comfort of a large wood fire.</p>

  <p>With an effort Bones hunched his shoulders, jabbed the pen into the ink,
  dropped a large black splodge on his white overalls and began again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nine an&rsquo; seven&rsquo;s fourteen and eight&rsquo;s twenty-four
  and three&rsquo;s twenty-five&mdash;six, seven, and one&rsquo;s twenty-eight
  an&rsquo; four&rsquo;s thirty-six and eight&rsquo;s forty...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton did a rapid mental calculation. &ldquo;The total&rsquo;s right,
  but the Lord knows how you got it,&rdquo; he said, and reached for the
  paper.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he roared, &ldquo;You dithering ass, you&rsquo;re adding up the
  men&rsquo;s chest measurements!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones rose briskly. &ldquo;That explains the jolly old deficit of eight
  an&rsquo; fourpence, sir,&rdquo; he said, and passed the pen. &ldquo;Audited
  and found correct&mdash;sign!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not on your life, Bones,&rdquo; snapped Hamilton. &ldquo;Those
  clothing accounts are a month overdue, and you&rsquo;ll sit down there and
  make out a new sheet. Sergeant Ahmet complains that you&rsquo;ve charged him
  for a pair of shorts he never had, and there are four shirts, grey, flannel,
  that do not appear in your account at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones groaned. &ldquo;Last week it was brooms, hair, one,&rdquo; he
  wailed, &ldquo;and the week before buckets, iron, galvanised, two. Dear old
  thing, this isn&rsquo;t war! This isn&rsquo;t the jolly old life of adventure
  that poor old Bones enlisted for! Buckets, dear old thing! What does a jolly
  old warrior want with a bucket except to kick it, in the glorious execution
  of his duty, dear old thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton slid down from the chest of drawers on which he had been sitting
  and made for the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into this matter after tiffin,&rdquo; he said
  ominously. &ldquo;You are supposed to be stores officer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If there is anything that I&rsquo;m not supposed to be, dear old
  Ham,&rdquo; said Bones, with marked patience, &ldquo;you might mention it,
  dear old soul. I&rsquo;m O.C. Bathrooms and G.O.C. Dustbins, and C.I.C.
  Chicken-houses. In addition to which, Ham, I&rsquo;m Inspector-General of
  Shirts an&rsquo; Military Controller of Corns&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you after lunch in my official capacity,&rdquo; said
  his superior. &ldquo;As a human being, I will give you a long and tingling
  drink if you will come to my room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Barley water?&rdquo; asked Bones suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whisky, with aerated water and large and globous chunks of
  ice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lead me to it, my jolly old Satan,&rdquo; said Bones.</p>

  <p>As they were crossing to the residency:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You really must get out those accounts, Bones,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly awful letter from H.Q. Besides
  which, the new half-yearly supply is on its way, and Sanders may want you to
  go with him into the bush at any minute. And dim the unholy fire in your
  eyes, Bones&mdash;if those accounts are not ready by to-morrow, I will
  accompany the Commissioner and you can stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a heart, dear old fellow creature!&rdquo; said Bones
  reproachfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got quite enough trouble, dear lad. Let me
  take the accounts with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you were going to heaven I wouldn&rsquo;t let you take
  them,&rdquo; said the firm Hamilton. &ldquo;And nothing is less
  likely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I <i>would</i> take &rsquo;em, dear old cynic?&rdquo; said
  Bones. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, maybe you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll
  say &lsquo;when,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added, as Hamilton uncorked a bottle,
  &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t forget, Ham, that drownin&rsquo; a baby&rsquo;s petty
  larceny, but drownin&rsquo; good whisky&rsquo;s a naughty old
  felony.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is a fact that Bones had, as he claimed, sufficient trouble. And it was
  trouble of an unusual kind. It had begun some eight months before when he had
  received a letter, delicately scented, and postmarked in Madeira.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dear Unknown</i>,&rdquo; it began, and Bones had blushed
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>It was the story of a young and beautiful woman who had seen him once when
  the boat on which she was travelling had stopped at the river&rsquo;s mouth
  to land the mail. She sent her photograph: she told him her life history. She
  was married to a man forty years her senior. She craved life and youth and
  freedom. She had for the moment her dreams, and in the very heart of
  brilliant and soothing visions was &ldquo;a tall, grave Englishman, whose
  blue eyes are like flowers in a desert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones spent that day so tall and so grave that Hamilton thought he had a
  sore throat. He sat up all one rainy night inditing an epistle which was, in
  a way, a model. It counselled pacience and currage, it embodied sage and
  fatherly advice, and finished up with all that Bones could remember of a poem
  which seemed appropriate.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;When skys are dark and glumy<br>
  And every prospecs prospects sad<br>
  Look for the jolly old sillver linen<br>
  For nothings as bad as it seams to be.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>It was not good poetry, but the sentiments were sound.</p>

  <p>In answer to her second letter (her blessed name was Anita Gonsalez) which
  came by return of post, Bones was not so fatherly. He was not even brotherly.
  He was, in fact, skittish. The correspondence proceeded on those lines until
  there came a black morning in June, and the letter which Bones so eagerly
  expected did not come, Instead, there arrived a stiff and type-written
  document, signed Alfonso Roderique y Trevisa y Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>And it demanded the name of Mr. Tibbetts&rsquo; lawyer, and threatened
  divorce proceedings and social ruin. There were several enclosures and a
  P.S.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Already the watching of my wife, interception of
  letters, etc., etc., by first-class detectives has cost me five hundred
  pounds (English). Am I to let this matter slide and sacrifice expense I have
  been put to?&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Bones did not reply. Once he was on the point of confiding in Hamilton,
  but the fear of ridicule (Mr. Gonsalez had sent copies of all his letters)
  made such a confession impossible.</p>

  <p>He left a second and a third letter unanswered, and each was more horrific
  than the last. So that when, that evening, he brought triumphantly a
  reasonably accurate copy of the clothing account to his chief and Hamilton,
  giving it a grudging approval, said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving at daybreak, Bones&mdash;don&rsquo;t keep the
  Commissioner trotting as you did the last time,&rdquo; Bones had that sense
  of overshadowed joy which is experienced by a man respited from a death
  sentence.</p>

  <p>He took Hamilton aside before he went to his hut, and made a request, and
  the indignant Captain of Houssas all but kicked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open your letters? Of course I shan&rsquo;t open your letters, you
  silly ass!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones wriggled in his embarrassment and confusion. &ldquo;The fact of it
  is, dear old officer...a letter from a lady, dear old sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Hamilton was really annoyed.</p>

  <p><br>
  A day or two after Sanders and Bones had left, there arrived an intermediate
  mail-boat which brought little correspondence but a source of considerable
  trouble.</p>

  <p>Hamilton had gone down to the beach to take the mail-bag from one of the
  ship&rsquo;s officers, when, to his surprise, the life-ship&rsquo;s cutter
  drove its nose into the soft sand and an elegantly dressed gentleman stepped
  delicately ashore. One glance told Hamilton both the nationality and the
  character of the visitor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Sanders, I presume?&rdquo; said Senhor Pinto Fernandez, with an
  expansive smile on his somewhat unprepossessing face.</p>

  <p>He had never worked this part of the coast, and it was his faith that he
  was unknown in the territory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You presume too much, my friend,&rdquo; said Hamilton, eyeing the
  visitor unfavourably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you must be Captain Hamilton,&rdquo; said the unabashed
  Pinto.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in the height of European fashion, wearing a tail coat,
  striped trousers, white spats, and a grey top hat, which in itself was an
  offence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Dom Gonsalez from Funchal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better hurry, for your boat&rsquo;s pulling
  away,&rdquo; said Hamilton, but, with a graceful wave of his hand, and a
  smile which was even more genial, Mr. Pinto Fernandez conveyed his intention
  of remaining.</p>

  <p>Though Sanders regarded unauthorised visitors as little less than
  criminals, there was really nothing to prevent any free citizen of almost any
  nation from landing on the residency beach. And nobody knew this better than
  Pinto Fernandez.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Commissioner is not here, and I am alone on the station,&rdquo;
  said Hamilton, &ldquo;if there is any information I can give you, I shall be
  most happy, but I strongly advise you to keep the boat waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am staying,&rdquo; said Pinto Fernandez decisively. &ldquo;I am
  here on a very delicate mission, and one which concerns the honour, if I may
  use the term&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said Hamilton, as the other paused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;the honour of one who is, perhaps, a dear friend of
  yours&mdash;Lieutenant Tibbetts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The devil it does!&rdquo; said Hamilton in surprise. &ldquo;Well,
  you won&rsquo;t be able to see Mr. Tibbetts either, because he&rsquo;s in the
  bush and is unlikely to return tor a week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will stay a week,&rdquo; said Pinto coolly. &ldquo;Perhaps
  you will direct me to your hotel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton did not like coloured people. He loved natives, he tolerated
  white men, but of all the types of half-breed he had reason to dislike, there
  was none approaching in loathsomeness to the Portuguese.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hut in the residency garden you can have,&rdquo; he
  said shortly. &ldquo;Or&rdquo;&mdash;as a thought struck him&mdash;&ldquo;I
  can lend you a canoe and paddlers to take you to the Isisi River, where you
  will probably find Mr. Tibbetts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the man readily agreed to this suggestion, and it was
  with mingled relief and apprehension that Hamilton saw him depart, watching
  the grey tall hat, fascinated, until it disappeared, with its owner, round
  the bend of the river.</p>

  <p>The object of Pinto&rsquo;s visit can be briefly stated, though in his
  modesty he omitted such a confession. He had come to secure &pound;500, and he was
  perfectly willing to accept half. That Bones would pay rather than face an
  exposure he had no doubt at all. Other men had paid: a young chief clerk at
  Lagos had paid &pound;300; a middle-aged Commissioner at Nigeria had paid even more
  before he realised what a fool he had been, and circularised a description of
  Mr. Fernandez, <i>alias</i> Gonsalez, up and down the coast. Of this
  disquieting action Pinto was blissfully unaware.</p>

  <p>The <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the outraged husband, unexpectedly appearing to the
  victim in the bush, away from the counsel of interfering lawyers and the
  devastating advice of friends, usually, in Mr. Pinto&rsquo;s experience, had
  the desired effect. In Lagos, where he was known, there might have been
  difficulties, but even these had not arisen. Men who live in the bush carry
  large sums of ready money. Their belt is their banker, and Pinto did not
  doubt that Bones could produce from the leathern ceinture about his thin
  middle, sufficient to keep Pinto Fernandez and his erratic wife in comfort
  through many a long and pleasing siesta. As he paddled gently up the river,
  he did not dream of failure, and the existence of D&rsquo;lama was unknown to
  him.</p>

  <p>D&rsquo;lama-m&rsquo;popo was of the forest, and owing little but the
  nebulous allegiance which is given by the forest folk to the nearest
  paramount chief. And where loyalty is largely determined by propinquity,
  treason is a word which it were absurd to employ. Thus, D&rsquo;lama had
  committed many small misdeeds, and at least one of serious importance.</p>

  <p>D&rsquo;lama owed a fisherman half a bag of salt, and the fisherman, in
  despair of securing a just settlement, offered D&rsquo;lama the equivalent of
  the other half bag, together with a fat dog, a mythical cache of ivory and
  the freedom of the village, on condition that D&rsquo;lama, who was a
  bachelor, took to his hut the fisherman&rsquo;s daughter Kobali, by her
  father&rsquo;s account a virgin, indubitably unmarried, and old by the river
  standard, for she had seen eighteen rainy seasons.</p>

  <p>Now, when a woman of the river reaches the advanced age of eighteen
  without finding for herself a husband, a hut, and a share of the cooking,
  there is usually something wrong, and what was wrong with Kobali was her
  ability to converse with birds, a most disconcerting accomplishment, for
  birds know the secrets of all, since they listen in unsuspected and hidden
  places, and are great gossips among themselves.</p>

  <p>There was a man in the far-away Ituri Forest who understood their
  cheep-twit talk, and he became a king and died honoured, and some say that on
  the day of his passing no bird was seen for a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>There was another man whose career was less glorious, and there was the
  mad woman of Bolongo. And there was Kobali. Her father would have kept her
  secret, for people with supernatural powers are unpopular, and are sometimes
  furtively &ldquo;chopped&rdquo; on dark nights, but she was overseen by an
  elder of the village talking earnestly to three little birds that sat on a
  bough with their heads perked on one side, and these birds were in a state of
  such excitement that the elder knew that she was telling them about the wife
  he had left in the forest to die, because she was sick and old. And, sure
  enough, a week later, came Mr. Commissioner Sanders with four soldiers,
  searching for the woman. They found all that the beasts had left, and the
  elder went down to the Village of Irons with a steel chain dragging from
  ankle to ankle.</p>

  <p>D&rsquo;lama-m&rsquo;popo listened to the proposal without enthusiasm,
  squatting before his crazy hut and playing with the dust, from which he never
  raised his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O man,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;it is true I owe you a
  bag-that-is-not-a-bag of salt, and when the little monkeys come back from
  their mysterious breeding place, I will kill many and sell them to the
  Government, and then I will bring you so much salt. But this woman Kobali is
  a witch, and who marries a witch loses his eyes. That is well known, for
  witches must have many eyes to see their way in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is foolish, D&rsquo;lama,&rdquo; said her father&mdash;he was
  a mild and skinny man and incapable of violence. &ldquo;For has she taken
  mine? She is a very fine girl...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He proceeded to enumerate her physical attractions with a frankness which
  is not common in the fathers of civilisation, employing the language of
  superlatives which adorns the pages of a bloodstock catalogue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She may be this, and she may be that,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;lama,
  unimpressed at the end of a long recital, &ldquo;but I am a lonely man and
  have no wish for women.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thereupon the father of the paragon was inspired to lie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The birds have told my little woman that you will take her to your
  hut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon the countenance of D&rsquo;lama fell. &ldquo;O ko!&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;That means that I shall go mad! For who but a madman would take
  as his wife a Bird Witch? Ko ko! This is terrible to me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The father went back to his house by the river, and there he found Kobali
  sitting under a tree where the weaver birds made their home, and she was
  gazing upward to the excited throng above her, so intent upon all that she
  was hearing that until her parent had called her twice she did not heed
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you go to the hut of D&rsquo;lama of
  the woods. He is a capable hunter, and he owes me salt. Now, on the last
  night of the moon, I will have a great dance for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You make no wedding dance for me, husband of my mother,&rdquo; she
  said, &ldquo;for the birds have told me that I shall marry a white
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The jaw of the fisherman dropped. &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he gasped,
  &ldquo;now I know that you are mad! This must come in palaver before Sandi,
  who is near by, so that I shall not be blamed for your foolish
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His daughter did not quail. &ldquo;The birds speak and it is,&rdquo; she
  said simply. &ldquo;Now, I tell you this, that if, in two moons, I do not
  marry a white man, I will go to the hut of D&rsquo;lama, though he is a man
  of no people and is a killer of the weak. For the birds told me that he
  chopped an old woman for the ring she wore about her neck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The agitated father carried the news to D&rsquo;lama, who was sufficiently
  uncultured to show his relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that such a wonder may not
  happen? For this woman of yours is very cunning and understands magic, and by
  her cleverness she may grow a white man out of the ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old fisherman blinked. &ldquo;That is true, D&rsquo;lama,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;for Kobali speaks with the birds and learns strange mysteries.
  This day she told me that once upon a time you killed an old woman in the
  bush because of the brass ring she wore upon her neck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Being a native, D&rsquo;lama did not faint, but he was silent for a very
  long time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If such things come to the ears of Sandi,&rdquo; he said a little
  huskily, &ldquo;there will be a hanging palaver. Get this woman married, and
  I will give you more than two bags of salt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man went back to his daughter and wrangled and argued with her
  throughout the night, without shaking her from her determination. The next
  morning he took his canoe and paddled three hours in the slack shore water to
  the juncture of the Isisi River, where a white paddle-wheel gunboat was
  moored while Sanders held palaver.</p>

  <p>He sat alone in judgment, for Bones had been sent up the Isisi River to
  arrest a certain petty chief who had sanctioned witchcraft in his territory.
  Under the striped awning on the after-deck of the <i>Zaire</i> Sanders
  listened to complaints, tried matrimonial suits, offered advice and
  admonition briefly and, at times, a little brutally. To him came the
  fisherman with his story of woe. Sanders listened without interruption until,
  in the way of litigants, the old man began his recital over again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to your daughter, fisherman,&rdquo; said Sanders,
  &ldquo;and tell her that white men do not marry black women&mdash;in my
  territory. And if she be, as you say, a witch, then there is punishment for
  that, as all the lands and people know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the fisherman, &ldquo;she speaks with the birds,
  and they tell her she will come to no harm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has not spoken with the right bird,&rdquo; said Sanders grimly,
  and dismissed him.</p>

  <p>It was the end of the palaver, and he rose a little stiffly, and walked
  forward, leaning over the rail and watching incuriously the broad river
  flowing to the sea. As he looked, there came into his zone of vision a long
  canoe, which he recognised, by its shape and the rhythmical action of the
  paddlers, as from headquarters. He lifted a pair of binoculars and scanned
  the oncoming craft, expecting to find Hamilton in the little leaf-roofed
  cabin at the stern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jumping Moses!&rdquo; said Sanders, and, putting down the glasses,
  he waited until the canoe drew alongside and Mr. Pinto Fernandez, complete in
  grey top hat and somewhat soiled white spats, stepped on board.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Tibbetts, I presume?&rdquo; said Pinto sternly.</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled, &ldquo;No, I am not Mr. Tibbetts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  am the Commissioner in these parts. What can I do for you, my man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to see Mr. Tibbetts on a matter of delicacy and
  honour,&rdquo; said Pinto glibly, and Sanders&rsquo; eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take off your hat,&rdquo; he said curtly; &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t
  fear sunstroke. You are a coloured man, I see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a Portuguese subject,&rdquo; said Pinto with dignity, but
  obeyed.</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at him for a very long time, &ldquo;Now, will you please
  tell me the object of your visit?&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a matter for Mr. Tibbetts&rsquo; ears alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is nothing to do, by any chance, with a correspondence in which
  Mr. Tibbetts has been engaged?&rdquo; asked Sanders, and did not fail to
  observe the start of surprise. &ldquo;Because there was a gentleman, if I
  remember rightly, in Nigeria, who had an indiscreet correspondence with a
  lady in Funchal, and was induced to part with a considerable sum or
  money,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;That fact came to me through official
  correspondence. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gonsalez,&rdquo; said Pinto.</p>

  <p>Sanders rubbed his chin thoughtfully, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the
  name&mdash;but I seem to remember your face,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
  seen a photograph somewhere&mdash;oh yes, your name is Pinto Fernandez, and
  you are wanted by the Nigerian police for embezzlement. Curiously
  enough&rdquo;&mdash;he was speaking as though to himself&mdash;&ldquo;I never
  connected you with the ingenious blackmailer, and I don&rsquo;t suppose
  anybody else has.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to say, Mr. Sanders,&rdquo; said Pinto loudly, and slightly
  flustered, &ldquo;that your Tibbetts has been corresponding with my foolish
  wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders stopped him with a gesture. &ldquo;According to the police report
  I have had from Nigeria, that was the basis of your argument with another
  gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He beckoned the watchful Abiboo. &ldquo;Put this man in irons,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Pinto Fernandez had been in many tight corners, and he was a man of
  considerable initiative. Before the sergeant&rsquo;s hand fell on his arm, he
  jumped to the taffrail and leapt the four or five feet which separated the
  <i>Zaire</i> from the bank. Before the Houssa could raise his rifle, he had
  plunged into the bush, leaving behind, as a souvenir of his presence, a grey
  topper and the nearly gold-headed walking-stick, which he carried as part of
  the insignia of his respectability.</p>

  <p>He heard the sound of a shot and the whine and patter of a bullet as it
  flicked through the leaves of the trees, and sprinted along the narrow native
  track into the forest. He was no stranger to the wild lands, and had the bush
  instinct which led him unerringly to the broader native road that ran
  parallel with the river bank. In the early hours of the morning he came to a
  little clearing, and D&rsquo;lama-m&rsquo;popo, coming out of his hut, stood
  stock still at the startling apparition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh master, I see you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;lama respectfully.</p>

  <p>Pinto, who knew most of the dialects of the rivers, answered readily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me food, man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going on a long
  journey for Sandi. Also I want sleep, for I have walked through the forest,
  battling with wild beasts, all this night. And if any ask you about me you
  shall be silent, for it is Sandi&rsquo;s desire that no man should know that
  I am hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>D&rsquo;lama prepared a meal, brought water from the forest spring, and
  left his guest to sleep. That evening, Pinto was wakened by the entry of his
  host.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, Sandi wants you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;lama, &ldquo;for this is
  the talk amongst all the villagers, that a certain one was taken prisoner by
  Sandi and escaped, and the master has sent word that you must be
  taken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is fool&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; said Pinto. &ldquo;You see I am a
  white man, wearing trousers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>D&rsquo;lama surveyed him critically. &ldquo;That is true, for you are not
  quite black,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, if you are a white man, then I have
  a wonderful thought in my head. For hereabouts lives a witch who talks with
  birds, and the birds told her that she should marry a white man, and after
  that the land should prosper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am already married,&rdquo; said Pinto hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is not?&rdquo; asked the crude D&rsquo;lama. &ldquo;Yet you
  shall marry her, and I will be silent. And no people live in this forest who
  talk&mdash;except the birds. If you say no; then I will take you to Sandi,
  and there is an end. But if you say you will marry, then I will bring this
  girl to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring the woman,&rdquo; said Pinto after a moment&rsquo;s thought;
  but whatever plans he had formed were purposeless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First I will tie you by the hands and feet,&rdquo; said
  D&rsquo;lama calmly, &ldquo;lest when I am gone, an evil spirit comes into
  your heart and you run away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Pinto, protesting, allowed himself to be trussed, for
  D&rsquo;lama-m&rsquo;popo was a man of inches and terribly strong.</p>

  <p>The woman who talked with birds was in her old place beneath the nests of
  the weaver birds when D&rsquo;lama arrived.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are D&rsquo;lama, the killer of old women,&rdquo; she said, not
  looking round, &ldquo;and a bird has told me that you have found a white
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is true, Kobali,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;lama, in a sweat,
  &ldquo;and as to the old woman, a tree fell upon her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kobali rose silently and led the way into the forest, D&rsquo;lama
  following. After a while they came to the hut where Pinto lay, in some pain,
  and together they brought him out into the light of the moon, and the girl
  examined him critically whilst the bonds were being removed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a white that is not black, and a black that is not
  white,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think this man will do for me, for he seems
  very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pinto&rsquo;s hand rose mechanically to twirl his sparse moustache.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I CAN&rsquo;T really understand what happened to that
  fellow,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;He must have got in the track of a
  leopard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or the leopard must have got on his,&rdquo; suggested Hamilton.
  &ldquo;By the way, what did he want with Bones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Sanders shook his head. He was a model of discretion, and Bones, in
  his many journeys up and down the river, never guessed that from behind the
  bush that fringed the river near the Isisi, dwelt one who, in happier
  circumstances, had described himself as Dom Gonsalez, and who possessed a
  very charming wife in the town of Funchal&mdash;or did possess her until she
  got tired of waiting, and contracted a morganatic marriage with the second
  officer of a banana boat out of Cadiz.</p>

     id="story12">XII. &mdash; THE LAKE OF THE DEVIL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The 20 Story Magazine</i>, Odhams Ltd., Oct
  1923</h3>

  <p class="first">M&rsquo;SURU, an Akasava chief of some importance, was
  hunting one day on the wrong side of the Ochori frontier when there appeared,
  at a most unpropitious moment, a man called Mabidini, who was something that
  was neither ranger nor hunter, yet was a little of each, for he watched the
  frontiers for his lord Bosambo, and poached skins secretly in the Akasava
  country.</p>

  <p>He was a young man, and, by the standards which are set by the women of
  the Upper River, handsome; and these qualities made his subsequent offence
  the more unforgivable, for M&rsquo;suru was middle-aged and fat and past the
  attractive period of life, so that only the women he bought were his, and
  nobody did anything for love of him. Mabidini, on the contrary, crooked his
  finger, and where was the marriage bond?</p>

  <p>Inauspicious the moment, for M&rsquo;suru was skinning a great water buck,
  and his four huntsmen had the skin stretched for salting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ko!&rdquo; said Mabidini. &ldquo;This is bad news for Bosambo my
  chief! No man hunts in this wood but he.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;sura wiped the sweat out of his eyes with the back of the hand
  that held the skinning knife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who sees, knows,&rdquo; he said significantly. &ldquo;You shall
  have the forepart of this meat for your pot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Mabidini desired neither flesh nor skin, and the word went to Bosambo,
  and eventually to Mr. Commissioner Sanders, and M&rsquo;suru paid ten bags of
  salt by way of fine. Worse than this, he became the mock of such as Mabidini,
  a man without a village, who dwelt in a hut in the very heart of the wood and
  had no people.</p>

  <p>One night six strange warriors slipped into the forest, and, taking
  Mabidini from his hut, they flogged him with skin whips, and burnt his toes
  so that he hobbled for months. That his assailants were Akasava he did not
  doubt; he would sooner have believed that he was dead than that M&rsquo;suru
  did not instigate the outrage.</p>

  <p>One day Bosambo sent for him. &ldquo;Mabidini, I have spoken with Sandi,
  who is my own brother, and he says there can be no palaver over this matter
  of your beating, because none knows, and M&rsquo;suru, who knows,
  lies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They say of M&rsquo;suru that he has a magic
  spear and therefore is very powerful. Also he has a new wife whom he bought
  for ten thousand brass rods. You are a lonely man, and it seems that, if men
  attack you in the night, such a spear would save you from having your toes
  burnt. For your wife would alarm you, and the spear would be under your
  bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, I have no wife,&rdquo; said Mabidini, who was no more dense
  than any man of the Ochori.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor spear,&rdquo; said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>So Mabidini took a canoe and drifted down to within a mile or two of the
  village where his enemy dwelt, and one day he saw, walking in the forest, a
  girl who cried and rubbed the weals on her shoulders. He knew her to be
  M&rsquo;suru&rsquo;s wife and spoke to her. At first she was
  frightened...</p>

  <p>Night fell suddenly on the village of Kolobafa, and was welcomed by the
  third wife of M&rsquo;suru, for there was a deficiency in her household
  equipment which her lord, with his fox-eyes, would have seen instantly. As it
  was, he came home too tired and hungry to be suspicious, and, having had his
  fill sitting solitary before the little fire that smouldered in front of the
  hut, he nodded and dozed until the chill of the night sent him in a daze of
  sleep to find his skin bed. The third (and newest) wife, whose name was Kimi,
  sat aloof, watching in an agony of apprehension, and when he had gone into
  the hut clasped her bare sides with such force that she ached.</p>

  <p>But no bull-roar of fury proclaimed the discovery of his loss, and,
  creeping to the side of the hut, she listened, heard his snores and crept
  back.</p>

  <p>She enjoyed a hut of her own, and the jealous elder wife, brooding in the
  dark doorway of the hut she shared with the ousted second, saw Kimi steal
  away through the village street, and called shrilly to her companion, for, if
  she hated the second wife, she hated Kimi worst, and in such a crisis lesser
  enemies have the appearance of friends.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kimi has gone to the river to see her lover. Let us wake
  M&rsquo;suru and tell him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The second wife thrust her blunt head over the stout shoulder that filled
  the doorway, and peered after the vanishing girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;suru sends his spears at night to the N&rsquo;gombi man,
  who sharpens them on a stone. If we wake M&rsquo;suru with a foolish story he
  will beat us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She carried no spears,&rdquo; said the first wife, contemptuously.
  &ldquo;You are afraid.&rdquo; Suddenly a thought struck her. &ldquo;If she
  carries any spear, it will be the Spear of the Ghost!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a shocked &ldquo;huh!&rdquo; from the second wife, for the Spear
  of the Ghost had come to M&rsquo;suru from his father, and from his
  father&rsquo;s father, and from countless generations of fathers. It was a
  short killing spear, endowed with magical qualities. By its potency
  M&rsquo;suru could perform miracles. The broad blade dipped into the river
  brought back the fish which, for some reason, had deserted the known spearing
  places; carried into the forest, its magic peopled the woods with prey; but
  its greatest property was this: if a man were lost in the deep forest he had
  but to balance the spear on his fingertip and the blade pointed unerringly to
  safety.</p>

  <p>It had many other qualities, curious and awe-inspiring. Thus, all other
  spears leapt toward the king spear, and could not be drawn away except by
  great force.</p>

  <p>Even the elder wife of M&rsquo;suru could not screw her courage into
  waking her lord. It was not until the chief of Kolobafa came out blinking
  into the daylight and bellowed for his wife, that the loss was discovered.
  For lost indeed was the magic spear!</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders was holding a palaver by the Crocodile&rsquo;s
  Pool over a matter of belated taxation, and M&rsquo;suru, in full panoply,
  attended to lay before him his great complaint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a terrible misfortune has come upon me
  and my people. My wife had a lover, whose name is Mabidini, a man of the
  Ochori tribe and well known to you because he swore falsely against me.
  Because this woman loved him, she went to him when I slept, taking the Spear
  of the Ghost, which, as your lordship knows, is the most holy spear in the
  world, and there is none other like it. Therefore I come to you for leave to
  carry my spears into the Ochori country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ko,&rdquo; said Sanders sardonically, &ldquo;what manner of man
  are you that you set yourself up to punish? For it seems that I am nothing in
  this land, and M&rsquo;suru, a little chief of the Akasava, can take my
  place. As for your spear, it is made of a certain iron which I know
  well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He called for his orderly, gave an order in Arabic, and Abiboo went away,
  to return with a small steel magnet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look well at this, M&rsquo;suru; for if your spear is magic, so
  then is this little thing that is shaped like the bend of the lost river that
  runs to Bura-Ladi.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders took the spear from the chief&rsquo;s hand and put the magnet
  against it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now pull your spear,&rdquo; he said, and it required a jerk to
  break the weapon from the magnet&rsquo;s influence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There shall be no killing and no carrying of spears,
  M&rsquo;suru,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It seems to me that already you know the
  Ochori country so well that your young warriors can find their paths in the
  dark! When I go back to my fine house by the sea I will have another spear
  made for you, and it will be called the Spear of Sanders, and you shall hold
  it for me and my king. As to the woman, if she has a lover, you may put her
  away according to the law. I shall return when the moon is new, and you shall
  bring the matter before me. The palaver is finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;suru, in no way satisfied, went back to his village and called
  together the elder men and such friends as he had&mdash;which were few, for
  he was a notoriously severe man and in no sense popular.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In two days from now Sandi will go back to his fine house by the
  river, and his spies will go with him; for it is well known that in the days
  which follow the palavers the spies do not watch, for all people fear Sandi.
  Therefore, send your young spearmen to me in the first hour of the night, and
  I will lead you to the hut of Mabidini, and we will take the spear which
  belongs to me, and such goats and women as we may find.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The way to the hut was a long one, for the Ochori territory throws into
  the Akasava a deep, knife-shaped peninsula, and a true peninsula in the sense
  that it is bordered by a river which has no appearance except in the wet
  season. And this has to be avoided. There is water enough at all times, but
  the rank grass grows quickly, and here all manner of strange, aqueous beasts
  have their dwellings. This river, F&rsquo;giri, runs to that deep, still lake
  which is called Kafa-guri&mdash;literally, &ldquo;the hole in the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the fourth day M&rsquo;suru fetched up at the deserted hut of his
  enemy, and learnt by inquiry from a wandering bushman that Mabidini had gone
  eastward to the silent lake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This man is not afraid, because he has my spear, which is very
  powerful against ghosts,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;suru when he heard the news and
  followed, for the secret river was in flood, But his warriors did not know
  his objective.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T like the look of Bones,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton, glowering under the rim of his topee at the figure which was
  approaching the residency with long strides.</p>

  <p>Sanders knocked the ash from his cheroot and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The impression I have is that you never have been enamoured of
  Bones&rsquo;s personal appearance,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not referring to his general homeliness,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton, &ldquo;My concentrated antipathy is directed to the particular
  Bones who is at present visible to the naked eye. I dislike Bones when he
  struts,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;because when he struts he is pleased with
  himself and when Bones is pleased with himself it is time for all modest men
  to take cover. Good morning, Bones. Why the smirk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones saluted jerkily. He had a habit of bringing up his hand and allowing
  it to quiver&mdash;no other word describes the motion&mdash;within half an
  inch of the helmet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven you&rsquo;d learn to salute properly,&rdquo;
  snapped Hamilton, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give you two hours&rsquo; saluting drill
  for two pins!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, clear old officer, this is the very latest,&rdquo; said Bones
  calmly, and repeated the action, &ldquo;I saw a stunning old sergeant of the
  Guards do it. What is good enough for the jolly old Grenadiers is good enough
  for poor old Bones. I think you said &rsquo;smirk&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put his hand up to his ear as though he was anxious not to lose a
  word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand to attention, you insubordinate hound,&rdquo; said Hamilton.
  &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;re deaf, you&rsquo;d better report and see
  a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oculist is the word you want, dear old Ham&mdash;oculist, from the
  word &lsquo;hark,&rsquo; sometimes pronounced
  &lsquo;harkulist.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem pleased with yourself, Bones,&rdquo; interposed Sanders
  hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so much pleased, dear old excellency,&rdquo; said Bones,
  &ldquo;as what you might describe as grateified.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean gratified,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great, grateful, grateified,&rdquo; retorted Bones reproachfully.
  &ldquo;Dear old thing, you&rsquo;re all wrong this morning. What&rsquo;s the
  matter with you? Jolly old liver out of condition?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled up a chair, sat down, and, resting his chin on his palms, glared
  across to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought, dear old officer,&rdquo; he asked in the
  hollow voice he invariably assumed when he became profound, &ldquo;that here
  we are, living in this strange and almost wild country! We know this place,
  we know the river&mdash;it is water; we know the land&mdash;it is land; we
  know the dinky old flora and the jolly old fauna, and yet we are perhaps
  ignorant of the very longitude and latitude of, so to speak, our jolly old
  native home!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped, inserted his monocle, and glared triumphantly at the dazed
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has it occurred to you, dear old thing, that we should not be here
  if it were not for the brave and intrepid souls who, so to speak, have blazed
  a path through the jolly old wilderness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked at Sanders in alarm. &ldquo;Have you any quinine,
  sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, dear old medical one, I am not suffering from fever; I am,
  in fact, <i>non compos mentis,</i> to employ a Latin phrase.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is what I&rsquo;m suggesting,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you&mdash;?&rdquo; Bones went on, but
  Hamilton stopped him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The thing that is occurring to me at the moment is that
  you&rsquo;ve been drinking, Bones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me, sir?&rdquo; said the indignant Bones. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an
  actionable statement, dear old officer. As a scientist, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a scientist, are you? Knew there was something
  queer about you. What branch of science is suffering from your malignant
  association?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones smiled tolerantly. &ldquo;I was merely pointing out, dear old member
  of the jolly old public, that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for our
  explorers&mdash;Livingstone, Stanley&mdash;in fact, dear old thing,
  I&rsquo;ve been elected a Member of the Royal Geographical
  Society.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He drew back in his chair to watch the effect.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is fine, Bones,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;I congratulate
  you. How did you become a member?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By paying a guinea or two,&rdquo; said the scornful Hamilton.
  &ldquo;Anybody can become a member if he pays his subscription.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, my boy,&rdquo; said Bones. &ldquo;I wrote a
  dinky little article on the etymological peculiarities of native tribes; in
  other words, the difference between one set of native johnnies and another
  set of native johnnies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; gasped Hamilton. &ldquo;Did you call it
  &rsquo;etymological&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Bones calmly. &ldquo;There is no other
  word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Captain Hamilton&rsquo;s face was a study. &ldquo;Etymology,&rdquo; he
  said gently, &ldquo;is that branch of grammar which deals with the derivation
  of words, you poor fish. The word you were labouring after was
  &lsquo;ethnology.&rsquo; Did you call it etymology?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Bones calmly, &ldquo;and the dear old johnnies
  quite understood what I meant. After all, you don&rsquo;t have to spell to
  discover the source of the Nile, dear old thing. You haven&rsquo;t to be a
  jolly old whale on grammar to trace the source of the Congo. Many of us
  explorers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up about &rsquo;us&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Hamilton, &ldquo;And,
  talking of exploring, I shall want you to explore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that that pay sheet is wrong again, dear old
  officer,&rdquo; said Bones sternly. &ldquo;If it is, it is your doing&rdquo;
  He pointed an accusing finger at his superior. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through
  it six times, and I made the same result every time. If it is wrong, there is
  foul play somewhere&mdash;jolly foul!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That the conversation should not drift to the horrid subject of work, he
  produced a letter he had received that morning. It was from a Fellow of the
  Society, and a very learned fellow indeed.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Mr. Tibbetts,&rdquo; the letter ran, &ldquo;I
  was very interested in your interesting paper on the ethnological
  peculiarities of the Bantu tribes, which I had the pleasure of revising for
  publication&mdash;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew somebody corrected the spelling&rdquo; murmured
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if you will ever have an opportunity of giving us more
  information on the subject of the lakes in your country, some of which, I
  believe, have never been explored. Particularly am I anxious to know more on
  the subject of one lake, Bura-Ladi, about which many stories are in
  existence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders looked up quickly. There were in his territory many unexplored
  patches, and Bura-Ladi was one of these. This small, still lake lay in a
  depression that was popularly supposed to be bottomless. No fish were found
  therein. Fishermen avoided it; even the beasts in the forest never came down
  to drink at its margin, and the earth around it was bare for a quarter of a
  mile.</p>

  <p>Sanders had seen the place twice: a lonely, sinister spot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There will be a chance for you, Bones, and in the very near
  future,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;You have never seen the lake?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, for the matter of that,&rdquo; said Hamilton, and
  Bones uttered an impatient tut-tut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old Ham,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;the jolly old
  Commissioner is discussing this matter with <i>me,</i> dear old thing.
  Don&rsquo;t be peeved; I can quite understand it, old Ham, but this is a
  matter of science.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So was your last essay,&rdquo; said Hamilton significantly, and
  Bones coughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That, old sir, was pure fantasy, old officer. A little <i>jeu
  d&rsquo;esprit</i> in the style of the late Lewis Carrots&mdash;Alice&rsquo;s
  Wonderful Land. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t read the book, dear old soldier. If
  you haven&rsquo;t you ought to get it straight away; it is horribly
  amusing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you told the misguided and gullible editor of the
  <i>Guildford Times</i> that you had discovered a new kind of okapi with two
  tails,&rdquo; said Hamilton remorselessly. &ldquo;And&mdash;correct me if
  I&rsquo;m wrong&mdash;you said that in the Forest of Dreams you had come upon
  a new monkey family that wore clothes. As the nearest Italian organ-grinder
  is some three thousand miles away, I take leave to describe you as an
  ingenious prevaricator. Now, the point is, Bones, what novelty are you going
  to find in Bura-Ladi?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is queer,&rdquo; Sanders broke in thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you
  know the temperature of the lake is about twelve degrees higher than the
  temperature of the river? In the rainy season, when one can get a cold spell,
  I&rsquo;ve seen the lake steaming. No native will live within twenty miles of
  the place. They say there is neither fish nor crocodile in its waters.
  I&rsquo;ve been making up my mind for eight years to make a very thorough
  exploration. And now, Bones,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
  taken the job out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton sniffed. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll find more in ten minutes than
  Darwin would have discovered in twenty years. After all, a little imagination
  is a great help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones reached out and gripped the unwilling hand of his senior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear old Ham,&rdquo; he said gratefully.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve got. You&rsquo;ve been a jolly long
  time finding out my good points, but better late than never, dear old sir and
  officer, better late than never!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><br>
  A month later, when Sanders went up river on his taxation palaver, he dropped
  Lieutenant Tibbetts at the point where the river comes nearest to the
  lake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, Bones!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hamilton leant over the side of the <i>Zaire</i> as the canoe was pulling
  away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No funny stories, Bones! No discovery of prehistoric animals
  frisking in the depths of the lake. Science, Bones&mdash;pure
  science!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones smiled pityingly. He found it easier to smile pityingly than to
  think of an appropriate retort.</p>

  <p>The day he reached the edge of the lake there came a man and woman
  overland.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here we will stay, Kimi, until M&rsquo;suru returns, for he will
  not follow us here owing to ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bones knew nothing of this.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE came a letter to headquarters by messenger.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear sir dear sir and Exerlency&rdquo; (wrote Bones)
  &ldquo;I have the hounour to report that I reached I reached Lake Boorar-Ladi
  at eleven at eleven oclock this morning morning. I have made a Camp on the
  North side. Dear sir the most extreordinry thing has happened the most extery
  extro extronary thing has happend. There has been a vulcanic eruption! At
  nine oclock tonight there was a tarrific noise in the lake the lake! It came
  from the derection of the lake the lake. On preceding to the spot I found the
  waters in a state of great upheval upheeval and by the light of the moon I
  saw that an ireland had appeared in the middle of the lake. The ireland was
  smoking steamishly. It was nearly a hundread yards in lenth length. Owing to
  absence of nessessary transport (canoe raft etc) I was unable to make close
  investeragation, This morning another tarrific explosion occured and the
  ireland disappeared.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope he means &lsquo;island,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Sanders,
  &ldquo;but we have no volcanic patches in this territory. Now, if we were
  near Kilamansaro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I imagine Bones is preparing his report for his unfortunate
  college,&rdquo; said Hamilton drily.</p>

  <p>But in the night Sanders was wakened by the sergeant of the guard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, the beater of the <i>lokali</i> says that there is bad
  trouble by the hot lake, and that Tibbetti has fought M&rsquo;suru and has
  been taken prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Sanders knocked at the door of Hamilton&rsquo;s
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Zaire</i> leaves at daybreak,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A SPY came to M&rsquo;suru with news of the fugitives.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have made a hut near the Lake of Devils,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Also, M&rsquo;suru, there have been terrible happenings, for land came
  up from the water and then went down again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;suru had some difficulty in persuading his followers to continue
  with him, but at last the terror he could inspire overcame their fear of the
  unknown and they went on, and as the sun was setting their fearful eyes
  rested on the sombre scene.</p>

  <p>In a vast desert of yellow earth the lake lay blood-red in the dying light
  of the sun. It was shaped like an egg, and on the narrower end a misty blue
  haze rested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ko, this is bad!&rdquo; said M&rsquo;suru in dismay, and pointed.
  On the farther shore his sharp eyes had seen the moored canoe, and on the
  slope above the tiny green tent that marked the tent of Lieutenant
  Tibbetts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sandi!&rdquo; said one of M&rsquo;suru&rsquo;s men, and the chief
  snarled round at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Sandi is on his big
  ship. Therefore this must be a trader. Show me where Kimi and the man
  live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The spy pointed to a far green belt, and M&rsquo;suru grunted his
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>In the hour before the dawn he reached the hut, and not all the magic of
  the Ghost Spear availed Mabidini. Him they crucified to a tree. Kimi died
  earlier and more mercifully. Bones, in the frenzy of exploration, heard the
  shrieks and went, revolver in hand, to discover the cause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you, Mabidini!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;suru was frothing at the mouth as he howled his hate at the dying
  man. He heard a shout behind him and turned, his spear poised.</p>

  <p>Twice Bones fired and twice missed. The second shot struck the tortured
  Mabidini and passed him out of the world. Then, in a frenzy of fear, one of
  M&rsquo;suru&rsquo;s men threw a spear. The point caught the bough of a bush,
  but the ironwood handle, spinning round, struck Bones in the throat, and he
  stumbled, gasping.</p>

  <p>For a second M&rsquo;suru hesitated, his spear raised, and then the
  knowledge that the white man would not be alone decided him. He flew down the
  slope toward the lake, his followers behind him. Far away to the left he saw
  the red tarboshes of two Houssas. They were at such a distance that he could
  safely make for the camp where the canoe was moored.</p>

  <p>He saw the soldiers running, heard the wrathful yell of Bones racing
  behind, and made his decision. He was in the canoe, hacking with his
  razor-sharp hunting spear at the native rope that bound it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; roared Bones.</p>

  <p>The Houssas dropped to their knees, and two bullets struck the water left
  and right of the racing canoe.</p>

  <p>M&rsquo;suru was steering for the opposite bank, and Bones knew enough of
  native marksmanship to hope that anything but a chance bullet would catch the
  flying murderer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cease fire,&rdquo; he ordered as the breathless soldiery came up to
  him. M&rsquo;suru would keep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to a little hut by the trees and bury a woman; also take
  down Mabidini of the Ochori, who is fastened by a spear to a tree,&rdquo; he
  said, and, when the men&rsquo;s backs were turned, watched the canoe.</p>

  <p>It had reached the centre of the lake, and the paddles were moving more
  leisurely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You nasty fellow,&rdquo; said Bones, and said no more, staring
  open-mouthed at what he saw.</p>

  <p>The surface of the lake had become strangely agitated. Great waves were
  sweeping outward toward the shores, and in the middle there appeared a dark
  mass, which must have been at least two hundred feet in length.</p>

  <p>The men in the canoe were at the western end of the amazing upheaval, and
  M&rsquo;suru, seeing the thing, changed his course.</p>

  <p>He saw more than Bones, for suddenly the canoe turned and came back toward
  the camp, the paddlers working frantically.</p>

  <p>And then there came up from the depths of the lake a great spade-shaped
  head. It rose higher and higher at the end of a neck that seemed thin in
  comparison. Towering over the canoe, the head darted down with incredible
  swiftness. There was a huge splash. Bones, frozen with horror, saw the head
  moving about in the water, as the bill of a duck moves when feeding. Another
  second, and the island had disappeared, and only two fragments of the canoe
  broke the smooth expanse of water.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> that you&rsquo;d see an
  ichthyosaurus,&rdquo; said Hamilton. &ldquo;Bones, you&rsquo;re incorrigible!
  You had two fellows there who could have corroborated your yarn, and what did
  you do with &rsquo;em? Sent them away! Oh, Bones, Bones!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts groaned in the agony of his soul.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear old officer...I saw it! A hundred yards long, old
  officer...I <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> dreaming.&rdquo; He was almost in tears.</p>

  <p>The <i>Zaire</i> had pushed her way through the weed grown river, and lay
  under the sloping bank of the lake. Sanders had listened in silence to the
  narrative of his subordinate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones, I believe you,&rdquo; he said, to Hamilton&rsquo;s
  amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You believe it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. &ldquo;Such things have been seen in the volcanic areas in
  East Africa...it is possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had intended returning immediately he had discovered that the garbled
  story of Bones&rsquo; capture was untrue&mdash;to what watchful tribesman he
  owed the warning he never discovered. But now he decided to wait, and again,
  to Hamilton&rsquo;s surprise had the <i>Zaire</i> taken back to the Little
  River.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely, sir&mdash;&rdquo; began Hamilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never know,&rdquo; said Sanders.</p>

  <p>He spent the night with Hamilton, filling a small iron water-tank with a
  variety of explosives, and the Captain of Houssas warmed to his task. In the
  early morning Hamilton fixed a time-fuse, and the tank, balanced on the
  steamer&rsquo;s foredeck, was ready to drop as the <i>Zaire</i> moved slowly
  to midstream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the starboard gun, Bones,&rdquo; said Sanders, and Bones
  crouched at the Hotchkiss, his finger on the brass trigger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo; said
  Hamilton, &ldquo;but I certainly feel that Bones is going to owe us an
  apology after this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sanders swung the <i>Zaire</i> to midstream, and, jamming over the
  telegraph to full speed, gave a signal to the Houssas in the bow. The tank
  dropped with a splash as the <i>Zaire</i> swung round and headed for the
  river, her stern wheel revolving furiously. They reached the weed-grown river
  mouth and slowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Sanders, watch in hand, and stopped the
  engines.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bones!&rdquo; whispered his superior. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fooled
  the Commissioner!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment there was a quivering thud of sound&mdash;a white geyser of
  water leapt up in the centre of the lake, and&mdash;that was all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>The word was hardly out of his mouth when the waters of the lake began to
  rock and toss, and out of the depths arose that horrible spade-shaped head.
  Higher and higher the neck emerged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Hotchkiss spat viciously, and somewhere near the fearful head a
  blue-black ball of smoke came into being. When it had gone there was no
  head&mdash;nothing but the boiling, bubbling waters and the flash of a great,
  dead-white surface like the belly of a fish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t write about this if I were you, Bones,&rdquo; said
  Sanders later.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old sir,&rdquo; confessed Bones, &ldquo;my jolly old hand is
  too shaky to write&mdash;I&rsquo;m stickin&rsquo; to the dinkey little
  monkeys with pants.&rdquo;</p>
