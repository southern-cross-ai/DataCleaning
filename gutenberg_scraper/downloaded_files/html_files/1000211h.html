<h2>&sect; I</h2>

<p class="first">WITH a lean brown hand limp as a rag, Drenton
Denn helped himself to quinine enough to blow the roof off the
head of an ordinary man.</p>

<p>"A blight upon the man who lured me to Madagascar!" he said,
with his teeth clenched "You get me here as a war correspondent
when there is no war to speak of and no facilities for getting my
'copy' away in any case. And how that I am down with the fever
you calmly tell me that you have orders to send me back to the
seaboard!"</p>

<p>Captain Le Boeuf quivered uneasily. He it was who had lured
Drenton Denn from Paris with specious promises of what might
happen in the way of graphic things to describe at Tamatave.</p>

<p>"It is only a hundred miles," Le Boeuf said, tentatively.</p>

<p>"But what a hundred miles!" Drenton groaned, "Even if I get
over this fever I shall be good for nothing for days to come. It
is impossible for me to return the way we came. And how a handful
of Kanaka boys are going to get me down to Tara I can't
understand!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Denn, you can't stay here."</p>

<p>"Of course I can't. I must do my best to get back to the
coast, and that right through an unfriendly tribe. Is there any
truth in the rumour that the Hamas are led by a woman who wears
Paris gowns and imports her own champagne?"</p>

<p>Le Boeuf showed his teeth in a dazzling smile.</p>

<p>"There is something in it," he said. "Do you remember that
magnificent Hama girl&mdash;Sabina, they called her&mdash;who
performed those marvellous snake and bird tricks at the Moulin
Rouge two years ago?"</p>

<p>Denn nodded. He recollected the girl perfectly well and the
sensation she had created at the him. The handsome chieftainess
had taken to Denn somewhat, and quite a Platonic friendship had
sprung up between them. Denn flushed slightly as he called this
to his mind. He had touched the heart of the dusky Hama, and he
had deemed it best to retire gracefully from Paris before
anything foolish transpired.</p>

<p>"You think she is close here?" Denn asked.</p>

<p>"I am certain of it," said Le Boeuf. "Sabina quitted Paris
directly trouble was threatened here to return to her own people.
I shouldn't wonder if she gave you assistance in getting to
Tara."</p>

<p>The next day Denn set out on his perilous journey. His escort
consisted of eight Kanaka boys&mdash;lusty fellows, black as
coal, and quite devoted to the service of a man who paid them
liberally. Their rate of progress was exasperatingly slow, for
they had to make a track through the virgin forest, and such
implements as they possessed were from traders' stores.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth day even Denn begin to despair. They
had certainly not progressed more than eight miles, the dried
fish and rice were getting low, and the water-bags looked
crinkled and flabby. There was danger, terrible danger, of death
from starvation and thirst in that primitive forest. The Kanakas
could only trust then own instincts and steer in a blundering
rule o' thumb kind of way.</p>

<p>With a grim face Denn watched the last grains of rice shaken
out for the evening meal.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he muttered, "we shall starve. What a fool I was
to believe that yarn about Sabina!"</p>

<p>But to-morrow brought better things. The interlaced gloom of
the forest grew less dense, and the sun shone golden through the
network of boughs in front. Then the little caravan emerged into
an open plain. A small river rolled along the valley, and on the
slope or clearing, opposite a cluster of bamboo and matting, huts
were gathered.</p>

<p>"Hamas," the head Kanaka boy, muttered. "If they are
friendly&mdash;".</p>

<p>But there was going to be no 'if' about it so far as Denn was
concerned. He rolled out of his litter and waded across the
shallow stream. The earth seemed to move under him like a ribbon,
for the nausea of his illness was still strong upon him.</p>

<p>From the largest of the huts a girl emerged, and stood
contemplating the stranger with eyes as dark as those of a deer.
Then, as Denn literally staggered up to her, she gave vent to a
queer, frightened cry.</p>

<p>"It is my lord Denn!" she exclaimed. "Go back. Quick! Better
anything than that she should see you."</p>

<p>All this in the queerest French from a girl dressed in a long
linen robe with a gold band round her waist, and nothing more.
Her hair was piled high upon her head, and skewered with silver
bodkins.</p>

<p>"I'm off my head!" Denn muttered. "I've fribbled my brain up
with too much quinine. What, is it really you, Zara?"</p>

<p>The girl so addressed quivered behind a smile. The last time
Denn had seen her was in the guise of Sabina's maid in Paris.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here?" the girl moaned. "You were good to
me, and I would save you if I could. Go&mdash;go before it is too
late. Our queen.."</p>

<p>"Meaning Sabina, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. She has it in her head that you played her false.
Don't you know that she came to love you? And when a Hama
loves..."</p>

<p>Zara threw up her hands to express a passion or a jealousy
outside the span of mere words. Her eyes were full of terror.</p>

<p>"Flattering, if slightly embarrassing." Denn muttered. "But it
seems to be too late to fall back upon one's base."</p>

<p>It was. Half a score of Hamas had gathered around the
strangely assorted pair. Their attitude was one of armed
neutrality. Take them all in all, they were not inviting to a man
on a peace footing. Attracted by their clamour, a woman emerged
from the largest hut there. She was a magnificent looking
creature, tall and sinuous, in the full flush of her powers, and
strikingly handsome.</p>

<p>The brightness of her eyes somewhat detracted from the
passionate sensuousness of her full crimson lips. As she caught
sight of Denn she started back, and a scream of joy escaped her.
But the expression of her face seemed to prick Denn's spine like
a red-hot needle. Behind the glad smile was the hungry look of
vengeance deferred.</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly, Sabina's manner changed as she came
forward. She took Denn's flabby palm in her own, and carried it
to her lips.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back to me," she murmured.</p>

<p>Sabina had become all smiles again. Nor had she forgotten much
of the artificiality two years in Paris had given her. But the
leopard cannot change its spots&mdash;Hama was still there.</p>

<p>"This is a meeting the most extraordinary," she said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" was Denn's banal reply. "I was with the French
force towards Tamatave, and they sent me back. I was trying to
get down to the coast this way. Will you try and get me down
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Yes," said Sabina. "Oh, yes. Dead or alive, you shall be
got to the coast. Yes, yes. To the coast alive
or&mdash;dead."</p>

<p>Denn murmured his thanks. He did not care for this insistence
in case of his premature demolition.</p>

<p>He suffered himself to be conducted inside the hut which
Sabina made her own, and then, with what appetite he could, he
despatched stewed goat and rice, washed down with native
wine.</p>

<p>"I suppose my men are being looked after?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Your men had fled back to the woods," said Sabina. "It is my
misfortune that I have a bad reputation in these parts. But they
do not know that I have had advantage of what you call
civilisation. And now, dear fly, how do you like the web of your
spider?"</p>

<p>Again Denn felt the hot pain crawl along his spine.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of spiders," he said.</p>

<p>"Not yet, not yet, dear friend. But you will soon. To-night I
show you something you do not deem of. The birds and snakes?
Bah!"</p>

<h2>&sect; II</h2>

<p class="first">DRENTON DENN sat with a huge native cigar in his
mouth, and what content he could on his keen, angular features.
He was by no means a handsome man, but at the present moment he
found himself wishing that nature had been still more niggardly
physically.</p>

<p>By his side sat the woman whose wayward heart he had won. It
pleased Sabina to be alternately passionate and disdainful.</p>

<p>And though Denn had dined, and dined well, no feeling of
content embalmed him. The fever had been burned and blistered by
the quinine out of his system, and his brain was once more clear,
alert, and vigorous.</p>

<p>Denn sat in a kind of gallery looking upon a courtyard in
which a circular wooden building had been erected. The sides of
the building were wooden bars, and the roof was made of some kind
of white cloth, or, rather, coarse matting. And above the netting
was a thatch of straw.</p>

<p>Inside the building half-a-dozen sullen-looking Kanaka
prisoners had been placed.</p>

<p>That some kind of punishment awaited them they seemed to know
perfectly well.</p>

<p>In most forms these men had little fear of death but they knew
the character of their captors, and from certain uneasy glances
at the straw thatch they seemed to have a hazy kind of idea what
was going to take place.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Denn asked.</p>

<p>"That in a minute you shall know," Sabina laughed. It was not
the kind of laugh that added to the gaiety of nations. "You used
to admire my performance in Paris; you said you could not imagine
anything more calculated to make your blood run cold. But you
were wrong&mdash;and you are going to see that with your own
eyes."</p>

<p>Sabina clapped her hands, and a Hama warrior crossed to the
thatched cage, bearing a long-handled mop in his hand. With this
he worried away at the thatch of the cage. Then the warrior
retreated to a little distance and sat down.</p>

<p>The effect of this apparently simple manoeuvre was appalling.
The prisoners jumped to their feet with the most heart-rending
cries. In their frenzy of some unseen horror they beat their
heads and breasts against the bars. Terror seemed to have robbed
them of all sense of pain. There were sounds of blows upon flesh,
and the cracking of bones. One poor wretch with a fractured knee
literally danced in utter ignorance of his bodily torture. They
might have been turned to raving lunatics by some fatal
poison.</p>

<p>A sudden nausea came over Denn. "I don't understand it," he
said.</p>

<p>"No, but they do," Sabina said, with a strange, glittering
smile.</p>

<p>"And so will you only too well&mdash;presently. Now, watch
carefully."</p>

<p>There was no need to give any such warning. Drenton Denn knew
only too well that he was witnessing a rehearsal of the
unspeakable horrors which were presently to be thrust upon
him.</p>

<p>Presently the Kanakas grew quieter. On some of them had fallen
the sullen apathy of despair. Other lead-coloured faces showed
the fighting spirit. But all, all, kept their intent gaze turned
upwards.</p>

<p>"Do you see anything now?" Sabina asked Denn.</p>

<p>He was too hideously fascinated to reply. He saw that the
coarse white matting had become alive with little red specks no
larger than grains of wheat. They might have been ants suddenly
disturbed and angry with the intruders upon their suburban
solitude.</p>

<p>But presently one or two of the tiny red specks dropped down a
foot or two, and seemed to be suspended in the amber air. And by
this same token Denn knew that he was watching the antics and
gyrations of a large family of red spiders.</p>

<p>Presently there were some hundreds of them held up by shining
needles of web from the floor. Then suddenly the air outside
seemed to be alive with a cloud of purple humming-birds. From the
way they feathered around the bars of the cage, they were
evidently bent upon a raid upon the bloated scarlet spiders. A
couple of Kanakas, armed with a long net, sufficed to scare the
birds away.</p>

<p>By this time there were hundreds of spiders suspended from the
thatch. They looked like scarlet peas or beans upon a thread. And
the unhappy Kanakas watched them with starting eyes.</p>

<p>"In heaven's name," Denn cried, "what does it mean?"</p>

<p>Again Sabina smiled. Her eyes were like points of electric
flame. Her face was as that of an avenging fury.</p>

<p>"All in good time," she whispered, "all in good time."</p>

<p>Presently the spiders began to drop like crimson hail. Like so
many marionettes the wretched Kanakas danced round the cage. They
tore at their arms and their shoulders; they shook themselves
like wet dogs. Anything, anything seemed better than to come in
contact with the bloated spiders.</p>

<p>Presently one prisoner gave a louder yell than the rest, and
collapsed upon the floor.</p>

<p>He lay there for a moment or two gazing at the back of one
hand and moaning piteously. Then the stolid fatalism of his race
came uppermost, and he squatted against the side of the cage
seemingly indifferent to his fate.</p>

<p>Within five minutes every Kanaka but one was on the floor. The
last one was more agile than the rest, for he wriggled and
twisted out of the way of the falling spiders in a marvellous
manner.</p>

<p>But no man could be expected to dodge a rainstorm, and over he
fell and was lost.</p>

<p>And then a painful silence followed.</p>

<p>For some little time this continued. Then the Kanaka who had
been the first to fall rose to his feet. There was a queer jerky
grin upon his face, his feet began to move in dance, and he broke
out into mirth as extravagant and hideous as had been his
previous fear. In less than five minutes every man there was
carrying on in the same insane fashion.</p>

<p>Drenton Denn felt as if he had been suddenly plunged into a
cold bath. The sudden transition had got even upon his strong
nerves.</p>

<p>"Let me get out of this!" he cried. "I can stand a good deal,
but I shall go mad if I stay here."</p>

<p>"You are coming to my hut," said Sabina. "We will talk of the
old times, eh; the time when you cared for me. Then in two hours'
time we will come and see the last scene yonder."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," Drenton asked, "that those infernal
little spiders can produce terror and madness like that? In the
name of all that is evil, what do you call the diabolical
insects?"</p>

<p>No reply came from Sabina until the hut was reached. Once
inside, the sound of that horrid mirth ceased.</p>

<p>"You appear to be curious," said Sabina.</p>

<p>"I have reason to be," Denn responded, "because I fancy that
you intend to give me a personal experience."</p>

<p>The woman nodded three times quickly.</p>

<p>Under her white gown she trembled with a passion that rendered
her almost speechless. When at length she spoke, she did so like
one who has run fast and far.</p>

<p>"I hate you!" she gasped. "Oh, if you only knew! I fancied
that you loved me and I was mistaken. You laughed at me."</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest recollection of the fact."</p>

<p>"Ah, but in your sleeve, I mean. You cannot understand a
hatred like mine. And I had to leave Paris with my passion eating
my heart. When I think of you in the night I bite my flesh.
See."</p>

<p>She drew back a flowing robe and displayed a brown arm seared
and scarred as if from a bad burn. Her eyes flickered and
danced.</p>

<p>"And now Fate has given you to me. The gods have answered my
prayers, and sent you to me. I am going to kill you."</p>

<p>"Then do so, and let there be an end to it."</p>

<p>Sabina smiled. On the whole, Denn preferred her passion.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," she cried, "that would be too slow, too clumsy. A
child might do that. Remain here till I return."</p>

<p>And Sabina swept from the room. Denn made no effort to move,
for he knew perfectly well that he was closely watched. For and
hour or more he sat there racking his brains for some method of
escape. At the end of that time Sabina returned.</p>

<p>"Follow me," she said curtly.</p>

<p>Denn obeyed without a word. Sabina conducted him back to the
gallery where he had watched the ghastly drama. So far as he
could see now, the cage was empty.</p>

<p>Not quite. On the earth lay a knot of twisting figures, slowly
rolling over and over each other like so many worms. Their eyes
were dilated; there was no mistaking the agony they were
enduring, but not a single sound came from their parched
lips.</p>

<p>The dumb agony of it was absolutely revolting. The poor
wretches were now suffering to such an extent that they were
utterly incapable of making a sound. It was the archetype of
human agony.</p>

<p>A physical sickness smote Denn. He noted every detail down to
the blue tinge on the skin of the unfortunates, and the great
yellow tumours that had formed on the spot where the fatal bite
had bee given.</p>

<p>With sudden anger, Denn turned upon his companion. He would
have deemed it no sin to take this beautiful tigress by the
throat and squeeze the life out of her.</p>

<p>"You devil!" he screamed. "How you can stand there and see
such awful suffering&mdash;"</p>

<p>His arm shot out, but Sabina had darted forward from his side.
Denn was unarmed, and Sabina had a knife in her hand. With her
beautiful sinuous strength and courage, she was no mean
antagonist.</p>

<p>Denn took no thought that he was un-armed. If he could get
that knife there might be a chance for him yet. He had not the
least doubt that he was destined to endure the fate of those poor
wretches, the agony of whose sufferings was, in sooth, enough to
unnerve a bold man. He gripped Sabina by the wrist, and fought
like a madman for the knife. Under ordinary circumstances Denn
might have succeeded. But the fever had rendered him weak and
low, and the issue was never in doubt.</p>

<p>"Coward, to touch a woman!" Sabina panted.</p>

<p>"When I see the woman," Denn said between his teeth, "I'll
make amends."</p>

<p>He pressed Sabina's knuckles together&mdash;an old trick he
had learnt in Tahiti&mdash;and the knife fell to the ground. The
creature screamed, as Denn shot down like a swallow and grasped
the blade. Then he darted as a hare to cover, a yell of triumph
on his lip.</p>

<p>In the language of his own land, he was a little too previous.
A gigantic Hama carrier rose out of the grass and sent the shaft
end of his spear whizzing after the fugitive. It caught Denn full
upon the temple, and brought him like a log to the ground.</p>

<p>In a confused kind of way he seemed to dream that he was being
gagged and bound, there were voices booming in his ears as the
diver hears them, he felt himself carried along over uneven
ground, and then he floated away into a midnight land. For a long
time he lay thus&mdash;lay as a child in a deep and placid
sleep.</p>

<h2>&sect; III</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Denn came to himself again he was lying
flat on his back, looking up to a thatched roof, the underpart of
which was covered with a coarse white matting. He was in a kind
of cage, the bars being of stout bamboo. A cold perspiration
broke our on Denn as he realised he was in the cage where the
Kanakas had suffered their infernal torture. It wanted an hour or
more to sunset, for the long forest shadows were falling. Denn
was no longer bound; he was free to move about as he chose. A
little table had been placed in the centre of the cage, and on it
stood a lamp filled with palm oil.</p>

<p>"Sort of footlights," Denn muttered; "and I am the star actor,
positively for this night only. Good heavens! Fancy jesting over
it! And presently those infernal little red specks will be on me,
and I shall die a death the horror of which is unknown to
millions."</p>

<p>Denn glanced up to the roof. As yet the bloated crimson specks
were not to be seen. In and out of the roof there darted a purple
zigzag cloud of humming-birds. They passed through the bars like
shadows; they clung to the thatch, twittering like swallows.</p>

<p>"If I could only have those little fellows for company," Denn
muttered again, "I should not fear the red speck. Evidently these
tiny little creatures prey upon the spiders. Strange that so
awful a scourge should be conquered by so small a bird! And if
they are not molested&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they were, and without delay. A sinewy brown Kanaka arm
was thrust between the bars, and a net followed. Within a minute
the last little purple shadow had vanished from the cage, and
then on all sides from without coarse canvas blinds were let
down, and Denn was alone, secure from public eye with the unknown
horrors to face. The main fact of the solitude struck him like a
blow.</p>

<p>There are limits to the strongest nature, and Denn had reached
his. Not that he lost hope; he had been in too many tight places
for that. But for the moment his manhood gave way; he covered his
face with his hands, and he cried like a child.</p>

<p>But they were not senile tears. They were wrung from Denn by
the knowledge of his utter helplessness. Then his mood changed.
He set his teeth hard, resolved, if he had to die, to die
hard.</p>

<p>The sense of utter solitude was in itself depressing.
Doubtless the canvas blinds had been drawn to keep the birds out,
and in all probability Sabina cared nothing to watch the torture
of her victim in an early stage. She could witness it by
lamplight later on.</p>

<p>There was a good hour to sunset, and a good two hours more
before that demoniacal woman would feel inclined to rise to the
occasion, and already, with the drawn blinds and the lamp, the
atmosphere was growing oppressive. Denn was bathed from head to
foot.</p>

<p>He would have given anything to have stripped himself of his
clothing. But, so long as there was a chance for life, he had not
the slightest intention of running any risk that way. Nor dared
he extinguish the lamp.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it," Denn told himself.</p>

<p>"An hour in the dark with those red little terrors all about
me and I should be hopelessly insane. I'll stick to my clothes
and I'll stick to my light till it is too late. But where are the
horrors?"</p>

<p>The crimson specks were not far off. There was a sound as if
somebody was attacking the thatch, and presently a tiny pink
speck came straddling and tumbling over the coarse matting. A
vigorous shake sent it down to the ground, where it lay close to
Denn's feet.</p>

<p>He examined it closely and critically. It was like a split
pea, red and hairy, with two tiny beady eyes and several legs
like black tread. A tiny, innocent-looking insect enough, but
capable, as Denn knew, of dealing out perhaps the most terrible
of all deaths. Denn felt his hair rising up the back of his
scalp.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," he cried, "it's the Specky Spider!* I dared
not believe it till this moment, but I have felt it all
along."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The Specky Spider is no figment of
imagination. It really exists! F.M.W.]</p>

<p>He knew the spider by repute in Brazil and South Australia. He
knew that its bite dried up the vessels of the blood, and
produced and agony that could only faintly be imagined. And Denn
also knew that when men got bitten by this insect they generally
blew their brains out without further delay. For the bite is
fatal, and the suffering&mdash;well, Denn had seen the suffering
for himself.</p>

<p>Denn touched the spider with the toe of his boot. The insect
squatted like a toad and attacked the leather. An instant later
all that remained of it was a pink round blob upon the floor.</p>

<p>Denn glanced upwards again with a shudder that shook him to
the very soul. In the instant that his attention had been
directed to the floor, half a score of those terrors might have
dropped upon him. The white cloth of the patch was thickly
speckled with red by this time. The tiny insects ran about
angrily. And soon, instead of a while cloth dotted with red, it
was a red curtain with tiny white blotches upon it.</p>

<p>From previous experience&mdash;as a spectator, Denn knew
exactly what was going to happen. Ere long there would be no room
for the invading multitudes, and the weakest would go to the
wall&mdash;i.e. they would drop to the floor like rain. And once
they did so!</p>

<p>Denn forced himself not to think of it. The nervous effort was
in itself sufficient to take all the strength out of his legs.
And cause him to drop upon his knees. And all the time his
anxious gaze was upward, upward! He meant to fight to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>Then the spiders began to drop, holding on with their elastic
needles until hundreds of them depended just over Denn's head.
His senses reeled, and the world seemed to spin round like a top.
Once he was down, he knew that it would be all over with him.</p>

<p>He crouched against the bars of the cage, so as to offer as
little space as possible to the crimson army. One of the red dots
fell upon his hair, and dropped upon his chest.</p>

<p>With a yell, Denn dashed it away. Despite his iron nerve, he
was fast becoming desperate. He was losing his head. Half a dozen
spiders were crawling up his coat.</p>

<p>Denn cried aloud. It seemed to him that somebody was creeping
along without on the further side from the village. Then there
was a ripping, tearing sound, and a long strip of the canvas
blind was torn away. Denn saw the light of the setting sun.</p>

<p>He saw something more than that, a sight welcome as cool,
sweet water in a weary desert. He saw a darting, hurtling flash
of blue lightning, as scores upon scores of the purple humming-
birds came flashing into the cage, their wings whirring.</p>

<p>They cleared the air as if by magic. A red spider had actually
dropped upon Denn's cheek; and, before he could realise the
sticky slime of the thread-like legs, a blue streak had plucked
it away. In ten seconds there was not a spider to be seen.</p>

<p>Denn dropped forward on his face, a huddled heap of ragged
humanity&mdash;pulseless, limp, and inert as a rope of sand. But
he did not faint. He rose in time to note the pale face of Zara,
Sabina's hand-maiden, looking at him through the bars, a knife in
her hand. In the other she had what was still more
precious&mdash;a revolver and package of cartridges, taken from a
French soldier who had fallen by the way. At the same moment the
tropical night fell like a cloud.</p>

<p>"Quick," Zara whispered. "She comes in a few moments. If you
go straight forward down the valley, you will find your Kanakas
awaiting you. They have lingered on the chance of your
escape."</p>

<p>Denn needed no second bidding. The knife in his hand and the
revolver at his belt gave him new strength. With desperate energy
he sawed through three of the bamboo poles and crawled along the
ground.</p>

<p>As he did so, a huge Hama confronted him.</p>

<p>There was a flash of a revolver barrel, a long squib of flame,
and the big Hama pitched with a groan on to his face. Instantly
the settlement was in an uproar. Denn could see Sabina framed
with light standing in the doorway of her hut. She made a
splendid mark. Denn's finger pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>But he did not fire; something restrained him. A moment later,
and the opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>"I ought to have done it in the interests of humanity," Denn
muttered as he darted like a flash down the valley. "It was my
plain duty not to let that woman live. And yet..."</p>

<p>Denn raced away, but there was no reason to do so. The use of
firearms had been too much for the Hamas, who had no taste for
magic of that kind. And surely enough, as Zara had promised, he
found his Kanakas awaiting him at the foot of the valley. They
would have utterly failed to recognise him but for Zara, who had
followed.</p>

<p>"No go back there," she exclaimed; "too dangerous. You get me
down to Malcha, where I have friends, and that plenty reward for
me." "But we don't know the way," said Denn.</p>

<p>Zara knew the route, however, and that did just as well, Denn
feeling that he would be just as well off at Malcha as anywhere
else. And before morning a comfortable distance was placed
between Sabina and her late prisoner. It was not till the next
day that Denn understood the queen looks of his dusky
companions.</p>

<p>He glanced at his features in a transparent forest pool. His
ragged moustache was its normal colour, but his hair was streaked
like the coat of a badger. That one hour's agony had done it.</p>

<p>"After all," said Denn, "it was a cheap price to pay for what
has been my most terrible experience."</p>
