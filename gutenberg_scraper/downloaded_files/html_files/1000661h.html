    <p>
      They had climbed one of the deep trackways under the beech
      trees, a track that was as old as time. The trees were in
      spring leaf, and green with that strange and luminous
      greenness that is like light caught and transformed into
      one of the garments of God. The grey trunks rose out of the
      chalky soil in which flints lay amid the bronze of last
      years leaves. The sky was invisible above the massed
      canopies, but there was the other blueness of bluebells
      pouring down the slopes. There was a great stillness here,
      supreme peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall woman paused. Her eyes were dreamy and tender, and
      she was smiling as a woman smiles when she looks at some
      very beautiful thing, or at a very young child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, this England! There is almost a pang in such
      loveliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her friend, who was dark and more silent, looked up into
      the greenish light amid the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After London, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they call this place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monk's Wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How utterly right. "Where do we come to? Nowhere, and
      everywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yatley Heath. But it isn't quite a heath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hollow way led them to a little plateau on the summit
      of the chalk ridge, a wild place where bracken was crooking
      up amid thorns and yews. Grass tracks ran hither and
      thither, or spread into lagoons of brilliant rabbit-nibbled
      turf. The old thorns were in flower, and looking like green
      tents that had been snowed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smell of them was stronger than the more subtle scent
      of the bluebells. Here and there, a great tree, beech or
      oak, raised a dome above the wild tangle. To the north a
      wood of pines built a barrier of impenetrable gloom.
      Westwards a grove of birches fluttered their green lace
      above the silver trunks. The sky was profoundly blue and
      brilliant with piled up clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just ahead of them as they reached the edge of the plateau
      a vast beech, dwarfed as to trunk, trailed its lower
      branches on the ground. They were in the shadow of the
      tree, and half concealed by it when the fair woman touched
      her friend's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the beech tree and surrounded by flowering thorns
      lay a little circle of grass. A small, naked, Pan-like
      creature was dancing there. He had a willow twig in his
      hands, one end of the twig in his mouth, and his fingers
      were playing on this mock-pipe. Almost, his head was the
      head of a faun, black and big for his small body. Near one
      of the thorn trees his clothes lay in a neat pile, with a
      pair of very modern shoes set neatly on the summit of the
      little heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women stood close together, watching the boy
      footing it over the turf. He did not see them. He was
      absorbed in his dancing, in the wild fancy of his small
      Puckish soul. So, John Keats might have danced on his
      little short legs, even in fancy, if not among the thorns
      on Hampstead Heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned to look into each others eyes, and each
      understood the look in the eyes of the other. This was a
      vision of Greek phantasy, the Spring dance of a wild thing
      out of the woods. Pan and his flute? Mere mortals should
      not disturb him, nor should he be seen by them. They drew
      back step by step and side by side, still watching that
      little white figure with its dark and faunlike head,
      brilliant as an ivory cameo set in a case of green velvet.
      An old thorn offered its shelter and they slid behind it,
      and so away by a path that flowed into the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall woman spoke in a whisper as though she had seen a
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little John Pope, the village oddity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, he is real?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very. He lives with his aunt who keeps the village shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An orphan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never seen anything like it. Quite lovely, and so
      unself-conscious. But, what on earth does the village make
      of such a child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't. Little John Pope does what he pleases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They think him nicely mad, perhaps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly that. John, at ten, is top of the village school.
      Our schoolmaster must be posed. Four more years in which to
      teach him more than he knows himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds absurd. Surely, such a child ought to--My
      dear, I feel as though we had been present at the birth of
      a genius. Am I being silly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I believe his aunt rather thinks as you do.
      She has plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can one plan for a child like that?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Can one plan for genius? Can genius plan for itself? Had
      Miss Jane Pope been asked that question while she was
      issuing you a postal order or weighing you out a pound of
      cheese, her broad, austere and somewhat enigmatic face
      might have suggested that you should mind your own
      business. John James had been Miss Pope's business for the
      last seven years, John and the village shop, and the shop
      was a means to an end. Miss Pope was one of those large,
      solid and black-browed women who may appear formidable to
      the world, but who, having seen the light, follow it with a
      quiet and implacable patience that leaves the gabblers
      breathless on life's doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, could anything have been more unexpected than John
      James?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unlike any other child, and yet other children did
      not bully him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope was taking tea, while Florrie, her understudy,
      looked after the shop and the post office. John James had
      not appeared for tea, but Jane Pope was not worried by his
      absence. Her unfussy tranquillity and confidence in the
      essential orderliness of things was comforting to the soul
      of John James Pope. On such a day as this she liked to take
      her tea in the back garden under the old Blenheim Orange.
      She was a great gardener was Aunt Jane, and her garden was
      like herself, of a large simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope sat in a basket chair beside her little old round
      oak table. The tea service was Willow Pattern. Jane Pope,
      as she crumbled her cake, held in her left hand a little
      buff-coloured book. It was her P.O. Savings Deposit Book.
      Not that she was unfamiliar with all its figures. She knew
      just how much she had put by each year, and what the
      interest amounted to. She enjoyed poring over the figures
      like an enthusiast over a seed-catalogue, and secretly
      gloating over the power it gave her to plant and sow in
      human soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thousand, three hundred and thirteen pounds, three
      shillings and three pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracious, what a lot of threes, The Trinity in excelsis!
      God the Father, God the Son, and little wee threepence--God
      the Holy Ghost! Miss Pope did not quite know which member
      of the Trinity she favoured, but she rather suspected that
      the Holy Ghost was a very potent influence. He even
      insinuated himself into a Post Office Savings Book, and
      spread a luminous joy over two-and-a-half per cent.
      Thirty-two pounds ten a year, or thereabouts, in interest.
      And the profit on the shop, after deducting all expenses,
      public and personal, amounted to about two hundred and
      seventy pounds. Well, well, well! Yatley had taught John
      James all that it could teach him in the academic sense.
      John James should go to Southbourne Grammar School. He
      could catch a train each morning and evening. And after
      Southbourne? Miss Pope cut herself a second slice of cake.
      Yes, after Southbourne all sorts of wonderful things might
      be possible. A scholarship? Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      The savings book was reposing on Miss Pope's stout stomach,
      and her mouth was full of cake, when a small boy crept
      stealthily over the grass like some light-footed little
      faun, and put his hands over Miss Pope's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's there, auntie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if I didn't know, you bit of mischief! I've nearly
      finished tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      John James withdrew his hands, and skipped round to face
      his aunt. He saw the little book in her lap. He knew that
      book so well by sight. Miss Pope picked up the teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to drink stewed tea, young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      John James smiled at her with affectionate shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been dancing on Yatley Heath. I took my clothes off."
    </p>
    <p>
      His aunt added two lumps of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Going about naked? Shocking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? The Greeks didn't wear clothes, Auntie, when they
      danced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greeks, indeed! Supposing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one takes off one's clothes when one bathes in the
      river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's different"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're in the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't one be in the sunlight? Besides, there
      wasn't anybody there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to hear it. The next thing will be your taking up
      some of the other children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't, Auntie. I like to dance with myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you sit down and have your tea, young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He cocked his head at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not shocked, really. You're just pretending."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, am I? I've got something serious to talk to you
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an old milking-stool by the table, and John James
      sat down on it with sudden solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it about, Auntie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to send you to Southbourne Grammar School."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to live there, Auntie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you want to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to leave Yatley, and you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His aunt cut him a slice of cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll always get round people, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said the child, "only the ones one wants to get
      round. We're different, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless us, so we are. Well, you'll go in and out by train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But won't it cost you an awful lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can stand it," said Miss Pope, picking up her savings
      book and fanning herself with it.
    </p>

      Miss Jane Pope was picking apples on that September day.
      Keswick Codlings, great balls of condensed sunlight that
      were beautiful for baking. Miss Jane Pope liked a baked
      apple or an apple dumpling, and now that her head was white
      she was even more apple minded. Miss Pope's mother would
      have worn a lace cap, but Miss Pope scorned such proofs of
      feminine surrender to age and convention. Was she not very
      much a person in the village, a part of the Trinity formed
      by the Squire and the Parson, though Miss Jane was much
      more modern in her outlook than either of those gentlemen.
      The Squire was Old Port, the Parson, Old Testament, but
      Miss Jane Pope was almost New Psychology, the aunt of a
      very notable lad, who in educating himself, had carried
      Miss Pope along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope might be picking apples, but her mind was
      elsewhere, in her ears rather than in her fingers. She was
      expecting a telegram, and though she stubbornly assured
      herself that she knew what the message would be, her pride
      and her affection were in travail. John James was in search
      of a scholarship at Cambridge, and if brains could win
      honour, then John James was safe. Miss Pope had become a
      doubter of things as they were. She had had her old eyes
      opened to various hypocrisies. England was supposed to be a
      democratic country, but it was permeated with prerogative
      and prejudice. Not that Miss Jane Pope believed in
      democracy. Therefore, she was in the unfortunate position
      of a woman whose cream had gone sour on her, while the
      cream of to-morrow was still in the making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did brains count in England?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would those eminent gentlemen who guarded the gates of
      Learning favour a headpiece that was considerable, and
      overlook a body that was not? If competition was keen,
      might not convention choose the blood-horse rather than the
      shaggy little pony? Appearances were so important, a Rowing
      Blue more potent than a scholar. Just because Miss Pope was
      posed by these problems, it may be gathered that she was a
      very unusual woman, because she was the friend and
      confidante of a very unusual young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope had a particularly large apple in her hand, and
      was meditating upon it as though the golden fruit was
      somehow symbolical, when the back door opened, and a voice
      hailed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope did not run and snatch the telegram from the
      girl's hand. She placed the apple with deliberation in the
      basket, and looked up at the tree as though to select the
      next victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it on the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not going to display haste and flurry in
      confronting her crisis. When life challenged you, it
      behoved you to counter it by remaining calm, or by
      maintaining an appearance of calmness. She waited until the
      door had closed before carrying her basket of apples to the
      garden table and exchanging it for the telegram. There was
      a moment's pause before she opened the envelope. How one
      swift moment of suspense could make you realise how deeply
      your affection and your prides and prejudices were
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope did not need to put on spectacles. She spread the
      form, and read: "I have it. Love, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope stood very still for some seconds. In her austere
      world exultation had been a rare bird, but suddenly it was
      in full song like a thrush on a May morning. "I have it, I
      have it, I have it. Love, love, love. John." And Miss Jane
      Pope laughed, which was unusual, and her laughter was not
      thrush, but more like a rook's cawing. How like John was
      his message. She could see that ironic, glittering smile of
      his, the cool gaiety of his handsome head, and the way he
      carried it, not cockily, but with a combative confidence.
      Miss Pope drew a long deep breath. So, the learned world's
      favour had gone to Head, not Legs. What a pity that John
      James was short in the leg! As a child his little legs had
      appeared normal, but something had seemed amiss with the
      lad's growth-centre. He had gone all to the head, and his
      legs had remained almost infantile. Legs were so important
      in England, the paradise of the game-player.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope laid the telegram down on the table. What she
      would have liked to have done would have been to have
      posted it up in the shop-window, but that would not have
      been quite seemly, and John James was not that sort of lad.
      She stood and stared at the piece of paper. Then, she
      gathered it, folded it up, and tucked it into her
      apple-basket.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jane Pope could not say just when and how the thought
      came to her. Probably, it had been there in her
      subconscious for quite a long time, and had popped up
      suddenly like a ghost at the foot of her bed. She had
      allowed herself a glass of stout at supper, but whether it
      was the stout or the news of John's triumph that had caused
      the secret fear to materialise she could not say. Perhaps,
      it was a combination of the physical and the mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope found herself staring at the moonlit blind. She
      had been picturing John James in a mortar-board and gown.
      John was a scholar of St. Jude's. John was to receive
      eighty pounds a year. John was a young gentleman to be
      waited on, a member of a memorable college, and the Grammar
      School's particular star.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if John James should be ashamed of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was so poignant that Miss Pope sat up in bed.
      Her large white face, her white head and white nightdress
      belonged to a rather frightened old child. She felt cold.
      Something seemed to have dropped inside her. She was a
      woman of courage, and not given to moods, but this horrid
      thought was like the first stab of pain that heralds the
      presence of some fell disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope got out of bed, pulled up the blind, and looked
      at the moon. It was the same old moon, and yet different.
      There was something sinister and cat-faced about it. The
      luminary glared at her. Miss Pope gripped her nightdress
      between her two breasts, and in that moment of doubt and of
      dismay, dared confession of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he won't be. I tell you he won't be."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it was perversity or pride that made Miss Pope put on
      her apron next morning, and go behind the counter. During
      the last two years she had ceased from active service, for
      she had Florrie, and a bright lad, William, to serve, and
      her part had been played in the little post office where
      she would sit in austere black behind the brass grill, very
      much a person. Moreover, she was a heavy woman, and her
      feet had come to resent too much standing. But this day was
      to be different, the day of John James' return, and no
      moral cowardice could be sanctioned. Once again she would
      be the keeper of a shop, slicing bacon, and cutting up
      cheese, and passing packets of shag across the counter to
      labouring men. "You can take the post office, Florrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope had passed the great news to Florrie and William,
      and within an hour it seemed to have travelled all over the
      village, and though Miss Pope was more respected than
      loved, quite a number of people came in to congratulate
      her. They found her behind the counter, the Jane Pope of
      tradition, aproned, and busy, her large and deliberate
      hands capable as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire was one of the first visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jane, the lad has brought it off, I hear.
      Congratulations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Peter Larcombe was rather like a very vigorous ram
      togged up in riding breeches and boxcloth leggings, a
      yellow waistcoat, yellow tie and fleece-coloured coat.
      Almost, he was the Squire of Musical Comedy, but he was far
      less stupid than his ram's head suggested. His bulging
      stone-blue eyes saw many things, especially a pretty face,
      and scandal had it that at least half-a-dozen of the
      village children could claim Mr. Larcombe as their sire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope bent her head to him. Her austerity had never had
      to counter the squire's passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. It is quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful head-piece, that lad. Well, I'll have a bottle
      of whisky on the strength of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll send it up, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe winked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you don't. Here and now. I'll borrow a glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a magistrate you should know, sir. Well, I'll bring in
      the whisky myself, and perhaps you will go into the garden
      and honour me by taking a glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe smacked his leg with his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, you're coming out these days. Damn it, we'll have to
      find you a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope picked up a knife and began to cut rashers of
      bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll excuse me, sir, I prefer--Florrie, will you
      please take a bottle of whisky and a syphon and a glass
      into the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Jane, join me in drinking the lad's health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir, but I must not leave the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire had his whisky and five minutes' meditation. He
      was something of a humanist and a rustic philosopher, and
      if he kept his bluffness for the village, he could and did
      divine reactions that were more subtle. Great woman, Miss
      Pope, in her own particular way; never had been the sort of
      wench whom you persuaded to share a haycock. Rather on her
      dignity too on this particular morning. Well, if that funny
      little fellow was something of a genius, Miss Pope had
      planted the ladder, and ladders were apt to be precarious
      perches. John James might climb it, and then kick it down
      when he was up on the roof. But would he? That would be a
      cad's gesture, and though Mr. Larcombe had been the village
      Juan, there was nothing mean in his make-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having drunk his whisky, he passed out again through the
      shop. He raised his hat to Miss Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've every right to be a proud woman, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I were John James I should be damned proud of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed out, and Miss Pope heaved a large and profound
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular customers came in, women of the village, and as
      Miss Pope would have described it, clucked or giggled at
      her. She did not take their felicitations very seriously,
      knowing that when they were out of the shop they might
      share confidences that were less kindly. Miss Jane had
      detected surprise on one or two of the faces, especially so
      upon the narrow and malicious countenance of Miss Euphemia
      Lardner. Miss Lardner's oblique eyes had leered at her.
      "What, behind the counter! I wonder why?" and Miss Lardner
      had gone away with two reels of cotton and certain
      reflections that had secret venom in them. Was Miss Pope
      playing the snob about snobbery? Young John James was, in
      Miss Lardner's opinion, a disgustingly conceited young man.
      Miss Jane Pope had better be careful; ambitious young men
      did not favour aprons. Or, was it true that Miss Jane Pope
      had a secret authority over her supposed nephew. Young John
      was an orphan, was he? His origin had been provokingly
      mysterious, and Miss Lardner was inclined to believe that
      the boy was no orphan, but the product of a concealed
      indiscretion on the part of his hypothetical aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half past eleven the rector sidled in, long, pallid
      and hirsute, like a melancholy Christ. Ethics appeared to
      have no joy for the Rev. Matthew Cock. His name belied him;
      for he was no chanticleer, but the father of six unmarried
      daughters, and the husband of a lady who wore the trousers.
      It was Mrs. Cock who ran the parish, and preached
      everywhere, save the pulpit. The vulgar asserted that poor
      Mr. Cock had gone into moult a year after the marriage
      ceremony, and had never recovered either his voice or his
      feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock stood rather helplessly in front of the counter.
      He had been so snubbed by the seven members of the other
      sex with whom he lived that there were occasions when he
      became completely mute. In his hairiness and his melancholy
      he reminded Miss Pope of a tired old horse hanging its head
      over a gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock looked startled. A direct question always appeared
      to shake him out of deep brooding and a consciousness of
      miserable sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm out of tobacco, Miss Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jane knew his particular brand. He had smoked it for
      years, and report had it that he was not allowed to smoke
      in the rectory, but had to retire to the greenhouse or the
      stable. She reached for a packet. Mr. Cock took it,
      fumbled, brought out four pennies and a halfpenny, and a
      characteristic and inopportune remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear of your nephew's success. Ah, hum,
      a most surprising career before him. He will come back to
      us quite the young gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Cock could say the wrong thing, he said it, and with
      a mild innocence that may have explained the family scorn.
      Miss Pope, accepting his coppers, appeared to grow taller
      and more formidable behind her counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will come back what he has always been, a scholar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock blinked. He felt that somehow he had been
      reproved. He was forever being reproved, and his poor old
      stupid soul never grew the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley had no railway station. You walked or drove to
      Medhurst if you were travelling to Southbourne or London.
      J. J. Pope, arriving at Medhurst by the 2.15, set out on
      the three-mile walk to Yatley, carrying a small black
      Gladstone bag which looked as though it might soon be
      delivered of a number of baby bags, all of them black. J.
      J. Pope wore a black jacket, a bowler hat, and pepper and
      salt trousers. So short were his little legs that the bag
      he carried seemed to slide along less than a foot from the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the familiar short cuts, over stiles and along
      field paths, and the way was as familiar to him as his own
      separative self. Day in, day out, in bleak disappointing
      springs, variable summers, and sodden winters he had
      followed this path to and fro on his way to or home from
      Southbourne Grammar School. The Forest Ridge lay before him
      spired and domed with trees, and it had to be climbed
      before Yatley was seen in its sheltered valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down into Yatley village by the steep path under
      the beech trees by the church. It had been his favourite
      track, for it brought him suddenly and sharply into the
      village close to the Green and Miss Pope's shop, and if he
      were in a mood to avoid the obvious both in the flesh and
      the spirit, and Yatley was full of such obviousness, this
      shaded path smuggled him past humanity. J. J. was in such a
      mood. His return to Yatley might have been cocky and
      triumphant; in fact, it was secretive and serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope was weighing out an ounce of shag for old Peters
      the sexton. She happened to glance at the doorway; it was
      open and empty. A moment later, just as she was passing the
      paper of tobacco to old Peters, she looked again, and John
      James was there, suddenly and surprisingly so, like a
      picture flashed upon a screen. He stood looking in, holding
      his bag. He seemed to be sensing all the familiar outlines
      and objects, and savouring the smells that had been his
      from boyhood, cheese, bacon, tea, butter, onions,
      shoe-leather. Old Peters, having put four pennies on the
      counter, turned and saw him. Old Peters grinned; he was
      both a servile and a surly old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if it be'nt young John come back a scholar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John James gazed at the old man as though he saw in him
      something sinister and symbolical. It was a strange,
      soul-revealing stare. Then he gave the faintest of nods,
      walked past the sexton, that digger of graves, and leaning
      over the counter put up a face that was almost a child's
      face to his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him. Old Peters had paused by the door, puzzled
      and vaguely hostile. Unfriendly young tyke, John James,
      grown a bit above himself with all this book-learning.
      Those two seemed to be waiting for him to remove his shadow
      from the floor. Florrie, behind the brass grill, was
      staring and sucking a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florrie saw J. J. kiss his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her white head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything. The old woman is proud to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      How some of his boy-moods had puzzled her, his sensitive
      shrinkings and nauseas, his puckish perversities, his
      peculiar and ridiculous terrors! Strange, shy, fastidious
      creatures, some children. It was useless to scold, or
      preach, or pull a long face over some fantastic fancy. John
      James had had a horror of fat and of women with red hair.
      Now why? Miss Pope had found life breaking down under the
      law of causation. There was something more whimsical and
      mysterious about it. Two and two did not always make four.
      That Miss Jane Pope should have made such a discovery,
      marked her as a remarkable woman. And here was John James
      hesitant behind her chair, and not wanting to be looked at
      for the moment, just like the child who had been hurt and
      perplexed by some stupid or cruel act.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had retired to the garden. J. J. came round the table
      and stood in front of her. She glanced up at him for a
      second, and then let her eyes drop to her work. John James
      was staring over the top of her head like a young man
      looking into the future. Or was it into the past? She knew
      that look so well, a narrowing of the eyes, a kind of
      darkening of the whole face as though a cloud covered his
      inner consciousness, faint lines of stress about the mouth
      and on the forehead. Miss Pope had grown very wise as to
      such moods and manifestations. Her love was not blind. It
      had learned to wait in silence upon a silence that
      questioned and calculated and divined. Life could be a sort
      of jig-saw puzzle, and J. J. was trying to get some of the
      pieces identified and placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel like talking, Auntie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel like listening, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, wise woman! J. J. gave her a look of profound faith and
      affection. He sat down on the grass, with his back to the
      trunk of the apple tree; it had been a favourite place of
      his as a small boy, and the slope of the tree's trunk took
      both your back and your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever visited one of the seats of learning, Auntie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder how you would react? My first night there. A sort
      of dream. Gothic mysteries, and all that. Tennyson's
      immemorial elms, willows weeping by the river. A
      sleepiness, a peace, the suggestion of profound wisdom.
      Sounds quite lyrical!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken her knitting with her and she glanced from
      her needles to his face. She knew this mood of mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you frightened, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a quick frown. Frightened! Now, how did she know
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was. Next day. I felt rather like an anonymous ant
      crawling about that great court. Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beside, what , my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My clothes were all wrong and my hair and my cap. That's
      not your responsibility, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's easily put right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it? Should it be put right? There are the clothes one
      wears inside one, as well as the outer togs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her needles clicked away steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Different, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Non-conformity, horrid word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his head back and laughed. His little legs were
      drawn up, and his hands clasped round them.

    <p>
      "You see, I shan't play games. I shall just be a little
      swat. Maybe I shan't learn to crease my trousers and pull
      my cap well forward. Funny how these things seem to matter.
      I didn't foresee them until I found myself with those other
      fellows who were up for scholarships. Southbourne isn't
      Eton, Winchester, or Repton. Atmosphere, Auntie, the polish
      of a particular convention."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, and then she looked at him
      with a curious steadfastness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His head gave a little toss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes and no. It's not nice to be a sort of foreign body in
      any community."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Need you be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know yet. I'm not going to shirk things. I
      shall just laugh. Even if I get ragged they shan't get more
      than a smile from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, go on smiling, my dear. And don't be bitter. The
      world can't get at you if you smile in its face. But, after
      all, you got on with the lads and children here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Different, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, we've grown up together, and maybe I have been
      just the village oddity. I have the same smell. But these
      class feelings. I don't think one realises how strong they
      are until you find fellows looking at you as though you
      were a Hottentot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some. Not all. I do count on making a few friends, fellows
      who are more head than leg. But I have made up my mind to
      it. To most of these men I shall be an outsider."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope laid her knitting on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So was Christ, my dear. So was Napoleon, and dear old
      Cobbett. So was your great man Darwin, so far as the
      bishops were concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at her whimsically, and then jumped up and
      kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll laugh together over it all, you and I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the laugh will be all yours, my dear, when you are
      Professor Pope, or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt whether I shall ever be that. I'm too much of a
      <i>Mayflower</i> person."
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The master looked out of his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an admirer of Dante he saw the Great Court as a
      miniature replica of Hades, filled with tormented shadows
      and lit by spurts of fire and little tongues of flame. It
      howled, it shouted, it sang; it blew horns and hammered
      teatrays, and the discord was immense. The Master stroked
      his Mosaic beard and smiled, though the sacred turf was
      being desecrated. Did flowers of flame burn the feet of
      those who walked in the Elysian Fields? But this was a
      happy and a hilarious crowd, part of it not a little drunk,
      for the occasion was splendid and singular. The college's
      first May boat had gone head of the river, removing from
      that distinguished place that very bumptious college, Tudor
      Hall. The Master of St. Jude's did not love the Master of
      Tudor Hall. Both of them were eminent classicists, and
      Tudor Hall had dared to criticise St. Jude's monumental
      work upon Plato. Surely, there were occasions when it was
      pleasant to behold the head of John the Baptist served upon
      a charger?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another figure joined the Master in the oriel, the neat,
      serene, pragmatical mate of the Head who remembered when he
      forgot. The great man might be as wise as Moses, but he
      could be colossally absent-minded, or pretend to be so. He
      could ape a bland and childlike innocence, and ask idiotic
      questions, but there was a lovely naughtiness in his
      <i>naïveté.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stars look down, my dear, on the Greeks sacking Troy.
      Why did you not ask Jeudwine to dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife slipped a hand under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you gloat over poor Hector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I might over a swollen head that was exploded.
      Caught them in the Long Reach, I understand. How many years
      have they been head?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite biblical, my dear! Naughty, naughty, but I did want
      to see Jeudwine bumped before my descent into Hades."
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife smiled up at him in the oriel where the coloured
      escutcheons gathered some of the light from the pyrotechnic
      fireflies in the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and you would be the first to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, should I! I don't like academic bounders. My dear,
      what is a bounder? Define the creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who wears a black coat with a red tie and brown
      boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty, naughty! Do you know what I should like to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never know exactly what--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, now, am I so incalculable as all that? I should like
      to go out and ring our dinner-bell, and let off one small
      squib."
    </p>
    <p>
      A bump-supper may produce joy and horse-play of varying
      intensities, and the great court was full of healthy
      exultation. Gains, the rowing blue, might be drunk, but
      that was his privilege, and he could be drunk with dignity.
      If the Hon. Selby Lowndes, the first boat's stroke, crawled
      about on the grass, and implored someone to milk him, that
      was harmless cow-play. But in such a crowd, especially when
      the more wholesome members are drifting off to bed, there
      are the elementals who make mischief. A victim must be
      offered up. One, named Crewdson, a third year man with
      lascivious eyes, and the profile of a goat, was the leader
      of a clique drawn from a particular school which was
      suffering from an unpleasant reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you chaps, anyone seen the Tadpole?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had seen J. J. Pope, and the inference was obvious.
      A little swat who could not join in celebrating his
      college's triumph needed educating. Moreover, J. J. Pope
      had come from nowhere out of nothing; he wore the clothes
      of a shop-assistant, played no games, was rarely seen in
      hall, and was supposed to live on apples and bread and
      cheese. Also, J. J. Pope worked much too assiduously; he
      possessed that absurd passion for gathering knowledge which
      is an offence to a certain sort of Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said Crewdson, "I think a lesson in deportment
      is indicated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson spoke with a supercilious lisp, but he could be
      crisp and sardonic when in liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sense of obligation, gentlemen, no loyalty to this
      great institution. Sits and swats on an occasion such as
      this. Regard, I beseech you, this noble court, this
      splendid fountain, our Hall, our Chapel, our immemorial
      gateway. The Tudor Rose, gentlemen, shades of the Great
      Henry. Beef, beer, and brothels! What shall we do about
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said: "Let's have the little squit out and duck
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson, standing on the steps of the fountain, raised his
      mortarboard to the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I salute you. A sage has spoken. The genius Tadpole
      is bred in water. Even when it becomes a frog, it is no
      more than a frog. Let us proceed to Sputum Court, and
      collect the specimen."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope kept in a room of the top floor of that dismal,
      mock-Gothic building. There was no spaciousness and
      splendour here. His windows faced the north, and received
      no sunlight. J. J. Pope was working. He had sported his
      oak, and was sitting at a table under the narrow, mullioned
      window across which old red serge curtains had been drawn.
      He had a book propped up before him, and he was making
      notes as he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world knew him as a very little man, not more than five
      feet two in height, with a large head and ridiculous legs.
      He was dark to swarthiness, with rebellious hair that swept
      back from his big round forehead like an insurgent and
      intelligent wave. His mouth was the mouth of a man who
      suffered almost ascetic self-restraints, yet, it was not a
      bitter mouth. His very deep set eyes were happy, if the
      eyes of a searcher after truth are ever happy. His little
      legs were tucked away under his chair. The hand which held
      the pencil was narrow and fragile, and not made for coarse
      labour or for games. It was an artist's hand, and he worked
      with the cuff of his coat turned up, not because the cloth
      was frayed, but because he had a peculiar dislike of
      anything constricting or rubbing against his wrist's.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment he was working upon abstruse chemical
      formulae, and bringing to them that imagination with which
      genius lights up the implications of a problem. At the end
      of his second year J. J. Pope was no mere indefatigable
      scholar, but a young man to whom the great could delegate
      research, and to whom they could talk as an equal. Half way
      through his university career he could have taken a first
      in the Science Tripos far more easily than a third year man
      could have secured a pass. He had jotted down some figures
      in his notebook and had raised his head to gaze at and
      beyond the shabby red curtains when he heard those noisy
      voices on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face sharpened; his eyes narrowed and lost their
      meditative serenity. He turned his head to listen. His
      little legs hooked themselves almost convulsively round the
      legs of the chair. A spasm of fear gripped him. He knew the
      possible significance of those sounds, and had suffered on
      other occasions from such invasions, smashed furniture and
      secret humiliation. He had come to believe that he had
      lived down the dislike that certain young gentlemen felt
      for him. Why was he hated? Because he was singular, because
      of his indefatigable urge to know, because he wore odd
      clothes, played no games, and was not a social creature?
      Well, did it matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson &amp; Co. were at the outer door, hammering on it
      and shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Pope, open up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the little swat in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open up, Jerry Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J.J. sat very still, his fingers still holding the pencil.
      Should he lie low and pretend to be out? But even if he
      shirked the issue, they might break in and smash up his
      furniture. It was poor stuff, but his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see a light under the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope, you'd better open up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He recognised the voice of Crewdson. His head gave a jerk.
      Courage! There was a mounting pride in him that blazed with
      sudden scorn and fierceness. But one should not show anger,
      only a cool and smiling indifference. He would face it out,
      and he would not forget. He had many such things to
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keeping-room door was closed. Deliberately, and head
      high he went and opened the door and stepped into the
      little lobby. His stomach might contract with an animal's
      primordial dread of its enemies, but his head was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open up, Pope, and we'll tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little smile on his face as he turned the key
      and stepped back quickly into the room. He preferred to
      face the crowd there, head up, back to the wall. They might
      be many, and stronger than he was, but he had a tongue and
      would use it. He was not going to cringe to them, or seek
      to placate prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dozen or so young men surged into the room like a
      football scrum breaking up. They filled it. Pope stood with
      his back to the fireplace, his hands in his pockets. There
      was hardly a yard between him and that bunch of faces, but,
      for the moment the space between them held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you want with me, gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, but there was irony in the one word. Gentlemen!
      It was Crewdson who answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why weren't you out in the Great Court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope glanced towards his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Working. Is that a crime, Crewdson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little squit, don't you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope smiled in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I neglected my duty? Isn't it possible, Crewdson, for
      a brain to bring honour, as well as a rowing man's hands?
      And you don't row, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could pose them with his quick tongue and the flash of
      his temperament, and the coarser creature, when thwarted in
      the battle of wits, reverts to crude violence. Crewdson,
      with a sneer on his Capricorn face, turned to his clique.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sense of decency. What shall we do with the little
      swat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duck him," said a voice from the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a bath, Pope, recently? You don't do it, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope looked Crewdson straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are other sorts of dirtinesses, Crewdson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, are there! Well, you've got a head like a Bath bun.
      Swollen, what! Go and have a look, Kernott. See if it does
      keep a bath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kernott and another lad went to explore the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No bath, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought tadpoles liked cold water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can wash him in the fountain. Better take his
      breeches off, you fellows."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope did not attempt to resist. He smiled and was silent.
      Crewdson and Kernott caught him by the arms, swung him to
      the floor and held him there while two other men removed
      his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, he's wearing pants!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pants in May, you stuffy little beast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remove them," said Crewdson.
    </p>
    <p>
      They frog-marched him down the stairs. The blood ran to his
      head; his shoulders hurt, but he neither spoke nor
      struggled. A kind of fierce gaiety sustained him. Some day
      he would be revenged upon the Crewdson world, or he would
      be so remote from it that it would be no more than a
      forgotten cesspit. His courage transcended the crisis. At
      the Great Gate a porter was on duty, but he made no attempt
      to intervene. These young gentlemen were merely honouring a
      tradition. The college had gone head of the river, and
      hilarious things might be expected to happen. Moreover, the
      porter was tired and sleepy, and his feet were sore; he
      wanted to take off his boots and get to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great court had almost emptied itself. The last cracker
      had skipped about the grass, and youth, having exhausted
      itself, was becoming conscious of reaction. The procession
      proceeded across the grass to the fountain. There were beds
      of wallflowers about it, and they suffered from youth's
      trampling feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, one, two, three, all together, heave."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope's body was swung like a sack. His chin and knees
      just grazed the edge of the basin. The lads let go, and the
      victim struck the water with a solid splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little crowd cheered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a good souse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Tad, how's the water-weed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They watched him emerge and stand with the wet kilt of a
      shirt sticking to his thighs. He seemed to be smiling at
      them. They saw his white teeth, but not a word did he
      utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better clear off now," said someone, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe, an anti-climax mocked them, and that there were
      members of the gang who would become conscious of secret
      shame. Nothing can be more damning than silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nighty-night, Tad. Better run home and get dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drifted away, breaking into groups of twos and
      threes, their voices sounded less loud and confident. They
      had ducked J. J. Pope, but they had failed to make him
      flinch or squeal.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      John James Pope sat on the edge of the great stone basin
      and shivered. The tail of his shirt trailed in the water,
      but it was his body that shivered, not his spirit. The air
      about the fountain could be fragrant with the scent of
      wallflowers when England's dastardly spring was not all
      north-east wind and grey bloom. In the darkness of this
      warmish night J. J. fancied that he could smell the
      flowers, and the scent of them was to become a memory
      associated with his eternal combat with a Crewdson world.
      He did not wish to forget it, the stars, the great grey
      court, the coldness of the water, the scent of the flowers,
      the kind of shivering exultation that filled him. He had
      outfaced these fools. They had not extracted a squeak from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master, meanwhile, had been standing at his window. He
      was supposed to be short of sight, but he saw many things
      that he was not expected to see. He stroked his Mosaic
      beard and was challenged by the occasion. All that he said
      to his wife was: "There is someone out there, my dear, whom
      I think I ought to interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      This large and stately figure crossed the sacred grass to
      the fountain. J. J. Pope had seen the masters door open,
      and if he still shivered, the imminent interview filled him
      with a feeling of curious exhilaration. What would Academic
      Dignity have to say upon the subject of his outrageous
      nudity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The master paused and stroked his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask who it is? In this light my sight is a little
      inadequate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Mr. Pope. It seems that a little horse-play has been
      in progress. Can you explain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Easily, sir. I'm afraid I did not get drunk and excited
      because our first boat--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The master interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope, I am sorry that this has happened. I will admit
      that in this young and rather physical world, those who
      play no games and work with great assiduity are apt to be
      unpopular, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time J. J. Pope interrupted the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit that, sir. I'm afraid I am too separative a
      creature and must accept the consequences of my sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not feeling bitter, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. Stimulated. It may seem strange to you, but to be
      unpopular with certain persons may be essential, if--No, I
      do not wish to give any names."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is magnanimous of you, Mr. Pope. But, forgive me, you
      must be very cold. Honour me by coming into the Lodge and
      drinking a whisky, and borrowing a pair of my trousers. May
      I say that I am one of those, and there are many others,
      who appreciate your assiduity. But, Mr. Pope, even scholars
      and philosophers must cultivate social cunning. Please come
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope hesitated for a second or two; then, he slipped off
      the stone basin and planted his feet among the wallflowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope, your name is almost symbolical. Remember how
      some reputations live when the braying mob is dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man and the little man crossed the sacred turf,
      and the stars looked down upon John James Pope's shirt-tail
      and naked legs. The master was confronting the immediate
      problem. This nudity of body and soul had to be both
      protected and comforted. The master opened his door and
      then pointed J. J. Pope to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, Mr. Pope. Sit there, or perhaps you would be
      warmer standing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the hall, glanced into the particular room and
      saw that it was empty, but that a fire was laid in the
      grate. The masters Mary exercised foresight in the
      providing of all possible comforts, and these Gothic
      buildings could be cold even in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find a box of matches on the mantelpiece, Mr.
      Pope. Light the fire. And excuse me for a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      The master mounted the stairs while J. J. crept into the
      room, and finding the matches, knelt down and lit the fire.
      Oh, blessed flames, oh, fatherly and human kindness! On the
      landing above the master met his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Refrain from going downstairs, my dear. Someone has had a
      ducking. Yes, organic savagery. I will collect dry
      clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it, Montague?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little Pope. So like his namesake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The master went and rummaged in his dressing-room, and
      marched downstairs with a pair of trousers, an old white
      sweater, a flannel shirt and a pair of shoes. In his
      preoccupation he forgot such essentials as braces. J. J.
      Pope was kneeling in front of the fire, spreading his hands
      to it, and trying not to shiver. The master closed the door
      and deposited the clothes in an armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Change, Mr. Pope, while I find some hot water for a
      whisky."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the little man alone, closing the door carefully
      after him. He called up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, my dear, do you think you can find me a glass of hot
      water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope was busy on the hearthrug, stripping off his wet
      coat, shirt and vest. He grabbed the great man's trousers
      and stepped into them. They were monstrous bags, ascending
      nearly to his chin, yet leaving concertina-folds about his
      feet. How was he to sustain them? He let them fall, and
      slipped into shirt and sweater, and they descended well
      below his knees. He lugged up the trousers, and tucked the
      upper garments into them, and was holding up the bags and
      looking lost when the master returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul, Pope, but I have forgotten the most urgent
      necessity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could have a belt, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us improvise. Take that antimacassar and rope it
      around you. I am afraid I am something of a Behemoth. Now,
      a little whisky."
    </p>
    <p>
      The master walked to the sideboard and took a bottle from
      the tantalus. He poured a good dollop of spirit into the
      hot water while J. J. Pope swathed the antimacassar about
      his middle. It looked like some prodigious Oriental sash.
      The master approached him with the steaming glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink that down, Mr. Pope. I think you had better stay in
      bed to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope's hand shook a little with emotion and with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to, sir. That is my only suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      The master fondled his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so? Well, Mr. Pope, I will have these clothes put
      before the fire. They shall be brought to your room early
      in the morning. You can return those garments at your
      leisure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope was sipping the whisky. It was a new drink to him, and
      it warmed other things than his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been very kind to me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, Mr. Pope, just human. By the way, I breakfast at
      nine. I shall be glad if you will breakfast with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my clothes are dry, sir, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see that they are dry. How is the whisky?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it down, my dear lad. Let it warm up your
      philosophy. Then I should run along and get to bed. By the
      way, who is on duty at the Great Gate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is Robinson, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please tell Robinson as you go out that I wish to see
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope swallowed the last of the whisky. He had ceased
      to shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it the names, sir, you want from Robinson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Master and undergrad looked at each other steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit that I had that in mind, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask you a favour, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May they remain anonymous, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is generous of you, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope put his glass down on the table. His feud was
      his own and he would cherish it, but he did not tell the
      master so.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      John James Pope, sitting at breakfast in that stately room,
      was very conscious of an atmosphere of sympathy. Fine,
      courteous creatures, these. But sympathy! How near was it
      to pity? For, in J. J. Pope the faintest breath of pity
      blew his secret anger into flame. He had far more courage
      in his small body than had most of these physical young
      men, a quality of courage that might appear insolent and
      bare-faced to those of little understanding. He had marched
      through the Great Gate that morning, carelessly carrying
      those enormous trousers, sweater and slippers bound about
      with the masters antimacassar, and under the eyes of Sykes
      the head porter. Sykes considered himself a very important
      person. His top hat had a perpetual and superlative polish.
      He had eyed J. J. Pope's bundle with invisible scorn, and
      he had not wished Mr. Pope good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had remedied the omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Sykes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good morning, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast with the master and his wife could be a dreadful
      meal to those who were self-consciously conscious of the
      occasion, for, though Mrs. Mary had the serenest of blue
      eyes she was "Blue," and almost as noted a classicist as
      her husband. Nor did the young world understand the great
      man's supreme naturalness. He appeared odd and baffling to
      the conventional just because he was so lucidly natural.
      His air of transcendental innocence reduced the little
      clever people to baffled voicelessness. What could you say
      to a great scholar who appeared to be ignorant of the
      subtleties of slang, and who, like a child, might ask you
      to explain Rahab's profession and the implications of the
      genus "Cad." Why, cad? Well, if a man did not know what a
      cad was, how could you converse with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to J. J. Pope the master was Plato to Galen. He did not
      quote Theocritus, nor did his wife mention Pythagoras. The
      master could say, and did say "In Natural Science, Pope, I
      am as a child unborn. I can speak of protoplasm. I have
      read Darwin. But just what are the implications of chemical
      biology as it concerns the cell?" What a subject to broach
      over bacon and eggs at breakfast, and how did the great man
      know that the exploration of the cell, its microscopic
      structure and its chemistry was J. J. Pope's passion?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The significance is infinite, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secret places of the soul's cell."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a phrase, and how comprehensive and comprehending! J.
      J. Pope's face was alive. The blind was up, the window
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very inwardness of it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mystery plus mechanism. I like to think that mystery is
      more inevitable than mechanism. We are being given so much
      mechanism."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd give you both, sir. The microscope--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the inward eye," said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost, J. J. Pope bent his head to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all humility, yes, but the eye must be ruthless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the quality of its vision. Take plenty of marmalade,
      Pope. Why do they call it 'Squish'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, to save time and tissue, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the reduction of the absolute to the obvious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly half past ten when J. J. Pope left the
      master's lodge, after smoking a pipe with him, for Pope's
      asceticism did not eschew tobacco. Maybe, most men would
      have shirked facing the publicity of the Great Court after
      the night's adventure, but Pope confronted it and the two
      separate men whom he met, one near the fountain, the other
      by the Great Gate. The first, a fairish, freckled child
      named Lister, hovered in front of J. J. Pope, and blushing,
      addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, I want to apologise for last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked him straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a bit blotto, or--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Lister, I'll forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His second meeting was with Crewdson, depraved mortar-board
      on head, his gown disgracefully and self-consciously curt.
      Crewdson was looking liverish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Tad, recovered from your bath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The retort was obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Crewdson, thanks to the master."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson cocked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see, been sneaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, having breakfast at the Lodge. Some things are beyond
      you, Crewdson. Bad luck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed, each upon his way, but Crewdson's face was
      balked and evil, J. J. Pope's somehow triumphant. That hour
      with a great man had given him a new serenity.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, this was to be no day of labour? It had been a
      late, cold spring, but this particular morning had the
      suddenness of summer in its breath. John Pope's mood was
      for escape, to enjoy inward celebration, not with women or
      wine, but in the open country and under the spacious sky.
      He did not ask for casual faces and the casual streets, or
      the Senate House doors where groups of interested young men
      crowded to gaze upon the examination lists. Anxious faces
      would float away from those fatal doors, suddenly happy or
      suddenly sad. There were those who smirked at fate.
      "Ploughed! Well, who cares a damn?" J. J. Pope, like those
      rare few who explore, and create, and decipher, was a
      separative creature, destined by temperament and his very
      urges to walk apart, for, apartness is the privilege of the
      singular.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Mrs. Barter, his bed-maker, on the stairs, a stuffy
      black bundle of a woman who was motherly to her young
      gentlemen, but not to J. J. Pope. She thought him a mean,
      queer, ironic little rat. He had no glamour, and pickings
      were poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Mrs. Barter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning," said the lady, "you've gone and locked your door
      again. How can I make a bed when--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. I'll leave it open now. I shan't be in to
      lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Did that matter when sardines and bread and cheese were on
      the menu, and sardines were oily, friable things that did
      not encourage pilfering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope kept a bicycle stored at a local cycle shop in Bridge
      Street. He went out to collect it, wearing trouser clips
      and a cap that was slightly too much on the back of his
      head, yet another proof of his origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope wheeled his bicycle out into Bridge Street.
      Should it be chalk or green meadows, the Gogmagogs or the
      Fen Country. He chose the meadows, and taking the Ely road,
      pedalled off into the sunlit morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      So late was the season that some of the great thorn hedges
      were still fragrant and in flower. Here was a green
      solitude under the vast blue bowl of the sky. A field-gate
      welcomed his mood. He dismounted, and leaning the machine
      against the gate, climbed it. The great green field,
      starred with buttercups, seemed to stretch into infinity,
      for the distant hedges merged into its greenness. Pope
      waded in. The fen country could be so like the great
      lagoons from which it had been recovered. The hedge near to
      him was smelling sweet, and he pulled down a spray and put
      his face to it. How bittersweet could the scents of nature
      be when you were feeling rather lonely and starved of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master had spoken of the unwisdom of bitterness, and
      though there had been assuagement in the great man's words,
      J. J. Pope cherished the tang of the sweet venom of hatred
      under his tongue. He knew, and he was right in knowing,
      that when a certain name cropped up, someone would say:
      "Oh, Pope, the fellow who was ducked in the Great Court
      fountain." That might be his label. It would adhere to him,
      even were he to occupy the Woolsack, or preside over the
      deliberations of The General Medical Council. He accepted
      that label. Or, rather, it should be a smarting wound over
      his heart, urging him to implacable effort and serene
      gaiety. Jealousy! Man and Jehovah were jealous beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled on his back and stared at the sky. The great blue
      bowl upturned above the green world was immense and
      soothing. The sun warmed him; the smell of the mayflower
      was in the air. It brought to his mind the name of that
      memorable ship in which men had escaped from oppression
      into a new and adventurous world. He had read of their
      sufferings and their struggles, pests, marauding birds,
      savages. But what other world was there into which he could
      escape, save a world of his own?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of his last evenings of the May term, and a
      strange restlessness possessed him. He went out and
      wandered, for the evening was sheer summer, golden and
      serene. Passing a house in Jesus Lane he heard young men
      singing:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For she is the Jewel of Asia--The Geisha, The Geisha."
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a champagne party, and young men were warm
      with wine. Two of them, leaning, singing out of a window,
      with champagne glasses in their hands, raised those glasses
      with merry irony to Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, there's Tad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Salutations, Tad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope walked on without looking up at them. Oh, the young!
      Would he ever be young? Had he ever been young? There were
      times when he desired passionately to be as those others,
      comely, and attractive to women. The genus girl was strange
      to him, and on those rare occasions when he met it, he did
      not know what to say to the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mortimer Street he turned right and wandered
      circuitously to the Backs. Trees, the willows, Tennyson's
      immemorial elms might be more friendly, but he found no
      assuagement here. Even the beauty of this golden evening
      tantalised him, the still water, the sleek grass, the
      shadows, the great grey buildings. Oh, the stateliness of
      King's, the lovely leap of Clare bridge, the rich russet
      sadness of John's! Yes, all this vexed him, for it had not
      accepted him. He was an alien. He could not play. Laughter
      had not come into his life. It was time for him to go
      elsewhere into some other and shabbier world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his clothes would be less noticeable in London. He
      would be part of an obscure crowd, and mere poverty would
      be no stigma. He crossed the college bridge into the
      Cloister Court, passed round the arcade into the next
      court, and came to a narrow slype. He had forgotten a
      certain thing, or perhaps it had not penetrated his
      consciousness. It was the night of the college ball when
      that other world drifted into this supposedly celibate
      community. Eve was here, Eve and the apples and the
      serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden picture patterned upon his consciousness was to
      remain with him all his life, the dark passage closed with
      a curtain of amber light, steps going up, and standing upon
      them like young princes, Hereward Gains, the rowing-blue
      and Selby Lowndes, the stroke of the first boat. They were
      in evening dress, tall, fine young men; Gains wore a broad
      light blue ribbon diagonally across his shirt-front,
      Lowndes the colours of the Club. From somewhere came the
      sound of music, a waltz of Strauss's. Great and stately
      young men, these stewards in the world of muscle and
      panache. Standing on the steps there they seemed high above
      J. J. Pope on his puny legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly there stepped into that arch of light three
      figures like figures in a coloured window, a woman, a young
      man and a girl. It was the girl upon whom J. J. Pope gazed.
      Her dress was the colour of the evening light, and she had
      a little cape of black fur over her shoulders. She was
      supremely dark and slender, and of a pure loveliness that
      caused Pope to stand and stare like a boy at a puppet-show.
      She had one of those warm white skins, a perfect profile,
      serene lips, eyes so brown that they looked black.
      Moreover, there was a young stateliness about her, a
      quality of limpid pride that put passion at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men became alive. They seemed to descend from
      pedestals in the presence of this Eve. They were smiling,
      flexible, eager. The woman passed up the steps, the girl
      and the young men following her. They disappeared, and to
      J. J. Pope she became a memory and music.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did realise was that not one of those people had
      appeared to notice him. He might have been the invisible
      man, or just a sack of coal left there to be collected.

      J. J. spent a part of his last long vacation learning
      German in Germany, and another month in acting as emergency
      dispenser to Dr. Dibble of Dewhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both experiences were not without significance. Since the
      Germans were leading the world in chemistry, especially so
      as it applied to the art of the physician, J. J. had
      decided that he wanted to be able to read German technical
      journals in their natural language. Also, he and Aunt Jane,
      after serious discussion, had agreed that he should combine
      chemistry with medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a matter of money, my dear. Take a ride on the
      Golden Calf in order to reach heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was a little surprised at his aunt's realism, or was
      it cynicism? But he could chuckle over it. Pure science, as
      a producer of funds, spelt poverty. The world would accord
      you a salary which any successful butcher would have
      despised. As for the brewers, beer was more than the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One can be sure of some sort of income."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many years will you have to spend at a hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two more, after Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can manage that all right, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't be all on your shoulders. I expect I can get some
      work coaching the dull."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will never be, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to you, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, J. J. went to Germany as a third class tourist,
      visiting Cologne, Heidelberg and Munich. Vienna called to
      him across the mountains, but lack of funds kept him from
      crossing the frontier into the country of Strauss and
      Freud. He settled at Mannheim for a month, and was
      fortunate in finding a family who agreed to give him bed
      and board in return for English lessons for their two small
      boys, Gunther and Fritz. J. J.'s host was employed in a
      great chemical factory at Mannheim, and through him, Pope
      gained an introduction to one of the firm's younger
      chemical experts, a big, blond young man who took a liking
      to the little Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. returned from Germany, and its cleanliness and its
      almost frightening efficiency to the England of Epsom,
      Lords, and the Oscar Wilde scandal. He crossed at night,
      and arriving at Liverpool Street Station in the chill of
      the morning, was struck by the filthy platforms and the
      stink of stale fish. J. J. had read his Cobbett, and he did
      sometimes wonder whether the world would suffer any
      catastrophic loss if London, Paris, and Berlin were treated
      like the Cities of the Plain. As he lugged his bag up the
      slope of the station approach to catch a bus that would
      take him to Waterloo, he remembered that he was coming to
      live in this London, and that no city could be one vast
      sepsis. Beauty has to live on the Beast.

    <p>
      John James had not been back in Yatley three days when Dr.
      Dibble of Dewhurst, who had been visiting Miss Plender at
      Brickwall House, met young Pope strolling across Yatley
      Green. Young Pope, as Dr. Dibble called him, had become
      known as far as Dewhurst as something of a prodigy, and Dr.
      Dibble hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Pope. By the way, do you happen to want a
      temporary job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dispenser is laid up. I don't know whether you have
      done any pharmacology, but you might be able to help me
      dispense."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at Dr. Dibble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I could manage that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dibble was quite impervious to irony. He was a florid,
      good-natured soul in whom the habit of professional pity
      had developed into a passion for patronage. Little Pope
      might be glad of a few guineas and the chance to gain
      experience in a country surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. Turn up to-morrow, if you like. Good
      experience, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dibble was walking towards his dog-cart, and J. J.
      strolled with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, the remuneration, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Remuneration! What a word! It smelt of Miss Pope's shop,
      and Dr. Dibble's blue eyes stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say two guineas a week, Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what hours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nine till seven. I like someone to be in charge when I am
      out. Take messages, you know. And you can write up the
      books, under my supervision."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope stood by the dog-cart with his hands in his
      pockets. He hesitated, and became aware of Dr. Dibble's
      surprised and displeased stare. Didn't the youngster
      appreciate the favour that was being shown him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll turn up to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, Pope. Punctually at nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. bicycled into Dewhurst each morning. Dr. Dibble's
      house was a big, red Georgian structure in the main street,
      with a fine doorway and fanlight. A path led to the stable,
      the offices, and the surgery, and here in this rather
      stuffy and sunless little sanctum, John Pope made his first
      contact with general practice. From the first J. J.
      discovered a certain perfunctoriness in Dr. Dibble's
      treatment of the poorer patients. Two or three stock
      bottles were kept from which the obscure Judes and Judies
      were dosed. Dr. Dibble would even empty into these vessels
      of utility the contents of unused mixtures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was blandly cheerful in explaining the inwardness of the
      economy to Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All they need, Mr. Pope, is just something in a bottle.
      Imaginary ailments, too often. By the way, we cannot afford
      to dispense tinctures to the club patients. There are so
      many people who make a hobby of being ill. That is a fact
      you will discover. When I write or say 'Haust. Omnibus' you
      will know what to dispense."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was never a very talkative person, and to Dr.
      Dibble's air of bland condescension he responded with
      docile silence. He was earning two guineas a week and
      gaining experience, but not the kind of experience that Dr.
      Dibble understood. His food cost him nothing, for Aunt Jane
      supplied him with a sandwich lunch, and the kitchen sent
      him in tea. He dispensed the doctor's very limited series
      of prescriptions, and learned to make them appear more
      varied by the colouring matter and the flavouring
      ingredients that were introduced into them. He wrote up the
      books in his very neat script, took messages, dusted the
      shelves, bottles and counter, was taught to economise over
      paper, sealing-wax and string. To all appearances he was a
      most dutiful and conscientious little drudge, and Dr.
      Dibble could say to his wife: "Quiet little fellow, Pope.
      Got a wrong impression of him at first. Thought he was
      rather bumptious. Those jumped-up lads generally are. As a
      matter of fact I don't think he could say boo to a goose."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope, after a month's experience of the Dibble
      practice, was satisfied as to its relativity. What Dr.
      Dibble did not know, he did not want to know. It was so
      much more comfortable and tissue-saving to shut the unknown
      up in a cupboard. J. J. would observe the old chronics whom
      the doctor treated with a kind of bluff and jocular
      tolerance. Were pains in the joints imaginary? Were chronic
      dyspepsia and old man's cough and varicose veins mere
      figments of fancy? Hardly. Well, what was to be done about
      it? Burk the issue, indulge in platitudes, talk about
      <i>anno Domini,</i> or seek, ponder, experiment? J. J. Pope
      had no doubt as to which inspiration he would choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      If life moves in an ascending spiral, J. J. arrived during
      the summer months at one of those curves of consciousness
      when a sudden more vivid awareness of the loveliness of the
      world was quickened in him. He could wander up to Yatley
      Heath on a summer evening, and in that lovely solitude
      watch the sunset die among the great trees, and the distant
      hills blaze and grow dim. The almost too poignant beauty of
      Nature, its complex cunning, its amazing artistry, forced
      him by contrast to reflect upon the strange ugliness of
      humanity. He thought of Dewhurst High Street and Dr.
      Dibble's waiting-room for the poor. Old shrivelled faces,
      hands worn down like old teeth, ulcerous legs, grotesque
      bodies. How rarely did he see a lovely face, or a sailing,
      stately body! How different were the animals, in pelt,
      grace, completeness! Had man's soul turned sour in him and
      made him the unappetising creature he appeared, a mockery
      of what he might he, of the Greek idea? Did not women
      desire beauty, and yet in the whole of this little country
      town J. J. Pope could not discover one feminine face that
      made him desire to look at it again. Maybe there had been
      grim fun in the Circe legend. <i>Homo sapiens</i> was more
      presentable when transformed into the shape of a leopard,
      lion or gazelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      What of his own little legs? Would they have carried him
      into the spear-clash of Marathon?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments when he laughed at the undistinguished
      gaucherie of man, clumsy figures, splodged faces, silly
      voices, a kind of fleshly bathos that was boring. Had
      Shakespeare's England been like this? Had the men of
      Agincourt lacked all swiftness, grace and splendour?
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope pondered this problem. Man possessed the earth,
      and had lost his artistry. Did civilisation make of him
      what a Lancashire mill made of its men and women,
      dollop-headed, stunted, bandy-legged dwarfs? And was he
      seeing life only in terms of matter, as a pagan person
      seeking profane beauty, and ignoring sacred love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Jane could not be described as a beauty, and yet! But,
      if he was but a neophyte in the Temple of Reality, he could
      boggle at the old phrases. Beauty is only skin deep. A
      heart of gold. Handsome is as handsome does! Were not these
      old phrases excuses invented by man, and woman, with which
      to drape his or her own plainness? Was there a spirit that
      transcended the flesh, and shone through the often too
      shoddy surface? It should show in the eyes, those windows
      of the soul. J. J. began to study eyes and mouths, and to
      pay less attention to undistinguished bodies, and for the
      first time, perhaps he realised that Aunt Jane had rather
      beautiful eyes set in an old dumpling of a face. However,
      in his search for the soul in the eyes Dewhurst gave him no
      very positive data. It seemed very dull of eye, bovine or
      porcine, and not even dog-like. So many dogs had beautiful
      eyes.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had wandered up to Yatley Heath on a brilliant September
      afternoon. It was a Sunday, but the green wilderness knew
      not man. And to him came a picture of himself as a small
      boy dancing naked on the sweet turf, and playing upon an
      imaginary pipe. Yes, just by this same monstrous old beech
      tree. Maybe that for a moment he recaptured the spirit of a
      child, or the divine madness woke in him and protested. Why
      not follow the impulse, shed his clothes and run naked over
      the grass? After all, it was no more than bathing in the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of wildness possessed him. He stripped off his
      clothes, piled them neatly by the beech tree, with the
      boots on top, and stepped out into the full sunlight. He
      stretched his arms above his head, stood on his toes, and
      tried to recapture that pagan memory. It was no use. Like
      Adam, he had become self-conscious. His wretched rational
      self was observing and criticising that other, inward,
      spontaneous creature. He was too much aware of his own
      little legs. What, prance about on those! Assuredly, they
      were better concealed in bags, like the bodies of most
      humans. Also, he found himself jumpy and scared. What if
      some Yatley lovers should appear and catch him naked?
      Clothes had made a coward of primitive man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to dash for his garments when the thing
      happened. He saw a figure rising in the gloom of the beech
      walk, a girl's figure, almost like the shape of a mediaeval
      saint appearing to confound mere mortals. Had she seen him?
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. dashed for cover. It was almost a header that he took
      into a mass of tall fern. He burrowed in and crouched,
      breathless, as shocked as any prude. For the moment he
      could not even laugh at himself or at the conventional
      shame that had sent him running to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He peered. He could see through the fern fronds. He saw the
      girl standing and gazing at his pile of clothes. Assuredly
      they had disturbed her day-dreaming. But if those discarded
      garments surprised and challenged her, her face and figure
      were perhaps more astonishing to J. J. Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      God, if she wasn't the girl he had seen mounting the steps
      at the college dance to the music of Johann Strauss's
      waltz!
    </p>
    <p>
      His was no comfortable hide-out. The fern fronds tickled
      him; last year's stems pricked his naked feet, and a little
      assembly of flies suddenly became interested. Yet, so much
      of him, or perhaps all of him was in his eyes, that he
      crouched there, gazing, not daring to move, and enduring
      the pin-pricks of nature. She was wearing an amber-coloured
      frock, and a straw hat of the same colour which sat on her
      dense black hair like a golden flower. Again, he was
      ravished by the slender height and grace of her, and by
      that lovely little face, so still and serious. She just
      stood and stared at his heap of clothes. Then, suddenly,
      she turned about, and her swift black eyes seemed to sweep
      the green world as though it might hold for her some ugly
      and sinister thing. Head up, she looked and listened,
      perplexed, disturbed. Who, why? Then, a kind of child's
      panic must have seized her. She went gliding back to the
      path by which she had come, not tumultuously so, but with a
      brittle and almost resentful pride, turning now and again
      to look back over her shoulder. Her figure sank away down
      the hillside into the gloom of the woods. She was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s head broke water above the green foam of the fern.
      A particularly vicious fly, biting at his left arm, was
      smacked and squashed, and fell into the bracken. He waded
      out, dashed for his clothes, grabbed them in both arms, and
      fled back again to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was she? Thank God she had not caught him fooling about
      naked on that carpet of turf!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Strange of Hardacre had a house-party. The Hardacre
      house-parties were, according to political opponents,
      infamous, which venomous assertion signified that in Sir
      Jocelin's day all manner of subtle schemes for the
      confounding of red ties had been concocted there. Now,
      things were different. Lady Strange was a tired and a sick
      woman. Her husband was dead, and their only son Lawrence so
      very much alive that his mother was proposing to persuade
      this infantile young man to drink the medicine of marriage.
      Lawrence had looks, and no brains, which might not have
      mattered if he had not inherited the soiled shirt of his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mildred Marwood and her daughter had been asked to
      Hardacre, because Lawrence was showing some sense for once
      in his life in admiring the daughter. If he was a
      good-natured, amorous fool who had been in trouble with
      petticoats ever since he was sixteen, then some intelligent
      woman might be persuaded to manage him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil Marwood, returning to Hardacre with her strange tale
      about the abandoned clothes on Yatley Heath, was taken as
      seriously as she looked. To be somewhat in love with a man
      whom her intuitions knew to be a fool, was a serious
      business. She had gone out alone to be alone with her
      crisis, nor had it been decided for her, and here was an
      incident that might distract attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, a man's clothes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all neatly piled in a heap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means--" and Lady Strange recoiled from the naked
      inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some silly tramp," said Lawrence. "Perhaps too much
      vermin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were clean clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you explore them, my sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not feeling herself anything of his at the moment.
      Lawrence was so sure that all women loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mightn't it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, suicide or something horrible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A corpse dangling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What a frivolous fool he was, and yet he roused in her
      elemental things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Lawrence's mother, "the police ought to
      be told. Don't you agree, Mildred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, P. C. Pook of Yatley was informed, and taking his
      bicycle, went out to explore. He rode and he trudged,
      pushing his machine up the steep woodland track, and
      hoping, as human nature does, for a sensation. But he found
      nothing. A yaffle, winging away into the trees, laughed at
      him.

      J. J.'s third year at Cambridge was without any very
      dramatic happenings. Crewdson and his crowd had gone, and
      the college came to accept J. J. Pope as an oddity, and
      perhaps as a somewhat significant oddity. He was classed
      with James Jellaby, the mathematical genius who was
      fore-doomed to be senior wrangler. This funny little fellow
      Pope was no ordinary undergrad. Rumour had it that Sir
      Humphrey Porson had marked him down, and that J. J. Pope
      was working under Sir Humphrey upon the bio-chemistry of
      colloidal matter. This--for a man who was not yet a
      bachelor of arts or of science! The college accepted J. J.
      Pope as a person. It was even a little proud of him as an
      eccentric creature with a phenomenal head, who, if you were
      friendly, could talk upon the possibilities of science with
      a fascinating and provoking fancy. Men quoted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, that fellow Pope says that we shall soon know how to
      arrange for a kid to be a girl or a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard Pope on the segregation of the germ plasm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, some German fellow has an idea that we carry our
      ancestors about with us in the sex cells, and pass 'em on
      like registered letters to our kids."
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two of the intellectual cliques in the college even
      cultivated J. J. Pope. They discussed Jude the Obscure, and
      Bergson, and the new decadence, and Stephen Phillips, and
      the Fabian Society, and Havelock Ellis. Some of the
      brighter spirits read "Papers," and the society debated the
      subject afterwards. J. J. Pope read a paper on "The
      Significance of Carbon in Organic Evolution," but though he
      tried to popularise the theme it was above the heads of his
      contemporaries, some of whom had very vague ideas upon
      protoplasm. It was a sort of strange jelly that somehow had
      come alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did make a friend who, in later years, was to become
      of peculiar significance to him, one Peter Pratten--the
      only son of Thomas Pratten who had made a fortune in
      selling pills. "Pratten's Pills" were known all over the
      Empire, and you could not pick up a paper without finding
      them advertised. They were, as famous as Pear's Soap. Nor
      could you miss the picture of a rubicund and smiling old
      gentleman popping a pill into his mouth and telling you
      "I'm seventy-nine and I take one every day." J. J. Pope may
      have felt an infinite contempt for Tom Pratten's Tonic
      Pills, but the son was a stimulating person with ideas
      beyond out-riggers and girls, and rather unusual and
      precocious views upon chemistry and its financial
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Pratten had not, like so many sons of successful and
      vulgar fathers, protested against the parental crudeness by
      developing a greenery-yallery hyper-refinement. Peter's
      hobby was boxing, and since he weighed nearly fifteen
      stone, and was the best heavyweight either university had
      known for a quarter of a century, he commanded respect. He
      might be a fighting man, but he had a most sweet temper.
      Actually, his child's face had been used to help in the
      pushing of the Pratten Pills, and he had been as lovely and
      as pink as "Bubbles." He had been known as "The Pratten
      Pill Child." Assuredly, this was a form of fame that might
      take a lot of living down at Winchester and St. Jude's, but
      Peter's smile, his large and handsome face, and his fists
      had smothered prejudice. It was not good to quarrel with a
      large and benign lion who, with one pat of the paw, could
      knock you head over heels across a sofa. Crewdson had tried
      it during his second year when the spiteful wit in him had
      not learnt caution. That, apparently, had been the one rare
      occasion when Peter had lost his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Pratten, how are pills? Using much paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson had been invisible for three days, and the nice
      and symmetrical blood-smudge round his eyes had lasted for
      a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter had a head as well as fists. Such supreme
      contrasts were he and J. J. that the big young man seemed
      to find his opposite in J. J. Pope's physical
      insignificance. J. J.'s head was a very different
      proposition. Peter had also been to Germany and absorbed
      some of that country's genius for organisation. The paters
      show had been a supreme success so far as publicity and
      profits were concerned, but Peter had a more dignified
      attitude to life than had his father. Old Pratten might say
      with grim jocosity: "Half the game's faith-healing, my lad,
      so why worry about the doctors?" Old Tom was a very
      colourful person in language, clothes and domestic
      decoration. He had a place in Berkshire, and kept a yacht,
      and--it was said--pretty ladies. In appearance he was
      rather like a wart-hog, and very red at that. How he had
      helped to produce Peter God alone knows. That must have
      been Polly. Pratten's privilege. She had been a beauty, a
      big blonde creature, and the daughter of a gentleman who
      had run the most exciting of the Maidenhead week-end
      hotels. Polly had been the particular attraction to the
      polygamous male, but Tom Pratten had carried her off, and
      she had made him a most admirable wife. He had been a very
      miserable man for six months after her death, and had even
      eschewed canary-coloured waistcoats. Peter spoke of J. J.
      to his father.

    <p>
      "We have a chap up at St. Judes who is a bit of a genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chemistry and biology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any use to us? I haven't got much use for the stuff they
      call pure science."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might be, Pater. You see, I have ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go along, young fellah m'lad! Want to outdo your father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other days, other ways, Pater. The public is becoming more
      educated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge, my child. Same old stuff, though you may have to
      serve it up differently. Shove a nice scientific label on
      the bottle, what! You rather fancy this fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm pretty sure he has a future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, snaffle him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not quite that sort. He's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highfalutin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might call it that. I'd like him to come and stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easy. What's he going to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor pigeon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed. He knew his father's jocund cynicism, and
      that it concealed some humanity and much sound sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never give anything to hospitals, Pater, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just plunder, my lad; placating the public. I'm after a
      knighthood. That's why I gave ten thousand to the Prime
      Minister's pet--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot," said his son, "you always pretend to be just an old
      filibuster."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be gathered that a peculiar frankness characterised
      the relations between Pratten father and son. Peter had a
      punch, old Tom an irreverent and irrepressible tongue.
      Peter had had the education which his father had lacked,
      but he had inherited some of the old man's pushfulness, and
      an urge that was to function on a somewhat higher plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was invited to Pollards for a week during the Easter
      vac. He accepted. He was met at the Berkshire' station by
      the latest sensation on wheels, an early model of the motor
      car, shaped like a four-wheeled gig, and steered with a
      tiller. Old Pratten was a man who would be one of the first
      to possess anything new. Peter was in charge of the
      machine. J. J.'s bag was shoved under the seat, and he took
      his place beside his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pater's latest toy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing lurched out of the station yard, and nearly
      swerved into a well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, hold up, you! She's a bit tricky on the steering."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had clutched a rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is only my second try-out. Think I'd better attend to
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      They bumped and swayed along the country road at the
      immense speed of fourteen miles an hour. The solid wheels
      jarred on the macadam. Now and again the machine showed an
      inclination to diverge towards the ditch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit heavy on the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not pneumatics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, why not? I suppose they got stuck with the carriage
      idea. Funny how slowly ideas come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, in a flash."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I bet yours do. Here, hold up, you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pollards" was red brick Gothic, with immensely tall and
      self-conscious chimneys and high gables, and in colour
      rather like its master, but the house was beautifully set
      on its terrace, with views over wooded and blue hilled
      country. Old Pratten was waiting for them on the terrace,
      very much the country gentleman with a gun under his arm.
      An austere manservant took J. J.'s bag, and instantly it
      seemed to become a thing of scorn. Strange, how underlings
      are so superior to their masters! Old Pratten put out a
      pink fist to J. J. and his little pig's eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to see you, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was. T.P. was a very vital creature who enjoyed every
      day in the trough. He looked at his son, and J. J.
      understood that old Tom was most furiously proud of Peter,
      as well he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad the rascal didn't spill you in the road, Mr. Pope.
      How do you fancy my oil horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. liked old Pratten. There might be ostentation here,
      and chuckles of vulgarity, but it was hearty and good
      English vulgarity. Old Tom was Music Hall not Albert Hall,
      and J. J. preferred the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the new idea, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha," said old Tom, "so are you, from what my lad tells
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackie Pope, as Mr. Pratten called him, enjoyed his week at
      Pollards, in spite of the attentions of the superior person
      who valeted him. Life at Pollards was country, and the kind
      of country that J. J. loved; the difference was that he was
      seeing it from the mansion instead of from the shop. He and
      old Tom Pratten struck up quite a friendship, for Tom was a
      wart-hog with ideas. He had a kind of genius for rooting up
      reality. They had arguments together, rather mordantly so,
      but with mutual good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a plain man, but I've got a philosophy. Now, what does
      the public want, Jackie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corn and games, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the tradition. Fact is, in nine cases out of ten
      the public doesn't know what it wants. All that it knows is
      that it wants something, usually the thing the other fellow
      has, and it hasn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just blind urge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've said it. Give it beer and butter, and a certain
      amount of copulation, and the right to grumble, what then?
      Just a blind crave. You have it; I have it. Your crave is
      to find things out. Most men ask God to spare 'em any such
      trouble. Well, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm listening, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teach 'em to want something. Rub it into their eyes and
      ears. Advertise, shout. It doesn't matter much whether it
      is my pills or a piano or a porcupine. You've got to create
      the crave, and then satisfy it. Why, my office is stacked
      with letters from grateful purchasers of Pratten Pills."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, old Tom was a buccaneer in his realism. He asserted
      that ninety-nine men out of a hundred desired to make
      money, and he was one of the ninety-nine. Most people
      weren't honest about it. They palavered; they put on the
      Sunday hats and black kid gloves of social smuggery, and
      pretended that their hearts were in some sort of other
      worldliness. Just highfalutin, and keeping in with God. He,
      Tom Pratten, doubted whether any live man, however elevated
      his soul, failed to find money interesting. And what about
      the one in a hundred? J. J.'s host did allow that there
      were such people, fellows who were so passionately married
      to their job or some cause that they forgot all about value
      for service. Fine, and altruistic and all that, but rather
      bad luck on their wives and families, if they had them. And
      then, Mr. Pratten winked at J. J. Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might be one of 'em, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might. What's in your pills, Mr. Pratten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, wouldn't you like to know! And I guess it wouldn't
      take you long to find out. You're too clever by half, young
      man. But there's another side to the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There always is, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Peter. Hasn't it been a pleasure to me to give him
      all the opportunities I didn't get? He is Pratten's
      Pills--grown up. Whether it's wise to give a young fellow
      too much is a thing I'm not quite sure about. You take away
      the stimulus. Depends on the lad, I suppose, and Peter's a
      good lad. He's got ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. happened to know something of Peter's ideas. He
      appeared to have inherited from his father a passion for
      selling things, but they were to be different things, and
      of otherness in conception and in value. That crude,
      experimental petrol-carriage was the symbol. Here was a
      vision of provoking progress, a new source of power,
      transport, speed. Peters urge was to be a developer and a
      manufacturer of motor cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little sensitive on the subject of his fathers
      pills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to crab the old man's show, or quarrel with
      his philosophy. I know some people might call it a swindle,
      even though the pater's pills do contain something which
      bucks up the brain and the bowels. After all, people
      wouldn't buy them if they didn't feel better for them.
      That's the point of his philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not a bad one, either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want to make cars. I'm fey about cars. It's the
      game of the future. I have talked it over with the pater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he'd like you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the pill game? Well, yes, in a way, but he is a great
      old sport. He's willing to finance me."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were idling in the "Pollards" garden, and suddenly
      Peter laid a very large hand on J. J.'s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had another idea. You are the sort of fellow, who, if
      you went in with the pater, might make a much more
      significant business of the show."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, research, you know, new products."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professional etiquette would forbid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you still mean to go through with the doctoring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I don't know my sick, I shan't be a judge of my
      remedies. The human body isn't just a test tube."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see your point of view. I suppose it's the same
      with me. When I go down I shall spend two years in an
      engineering shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hospital will be my shop."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope was walking along King's Parade when facetious
      youth challenged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Tad, lists are up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're pilled."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave the jester an ironic smirk and continued upon
      his way to Cavendish Street and the day's work. It was not
      arrogance but certitude which inspired him. Not for him was
      the ordeal of the Senate House door. Had he prepared the
      Tripos papers for himself they could not have suited him
      more admirably. He took his lunch with him to the lab. and
      sat and ate bread and cheese like any working man. There
      was no better food than this, and you did not tire of it as
      you tired of kickshaws, provided both temperament and tummy
      were in health. J. J. sometimes wondered whether old Tom
      Pratten hankered after his bread and cheese days, and those
      strenuous and struggling years when work could be a frenzy.
      He did realise that Peters father had offered him a unique
      opportunity as advisory and research expert to a company
      whose ramifications spread all over the world, but J. J.
      Pope had not yet reached that cynical phase when a man
      throws pious protestations into the washing-basket, and
      sallies forth with a new nakedness into the jungle. J. J.
      was still what old Pratten would have called highfalutin
      and high headed. He believed that the quest was the serious
      business, and that a man could be a kind of Galahad in the
      scientific wilderness, seeking the sacred flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lab. served an improvised tea to its special students,
      and not till the day's work was done, and J. J. set out to
      dine in hall, did he receive a particular message. The
      porter on duty at the Great Gate accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ward left word that he wants to see you. He'll be in
      his rooms after hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said J. J. and passed on to his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward was his tutor, and there had been occasional
      passages of arms between them over hall and attendance at
      chapel. Mr. Ward was large and sonorous and bald, with a
      sense of duty to the young that was almost biblical, and if
      he tended to impose upon his world a paternal sympathy, it
      was done, at times, with too much unction. The college
      called him "Sappolio," but he was, in fact, a very benign
      person, lavish with breakfasts, and also with avuncular
      hints as to behaviour. Pope climbed Mr. Ward's stairs,
      knocked, and was told in a resounding voice to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward was at his desk, making notes upon a book by the
      latest German philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Mr. Pope. Come in, sit down. I am glad you received my
      message."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat down on a hard Victorian chair, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must congratulate you, Mr. Pope. Of course you have seen
      the Tripos lists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward's eyebrows went up. He was an authority on
      psychology and sociology, but J. J. Pope puzzled him. To
      let a whole day go by without visiting the Senate House
      door! What was the inference? That Pope was scared, or--?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Is it that you doubted your capacity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Ward raised bushy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supreme confidence, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know my work, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, your confidence is justified. A first class, Mr.
      Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And more than that. As you probably know, places are
      recorded, unofficially. I have been informed that your name
      heads the list. I congratulate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile spread over J. J.'s face. He looked out of
      the Tudor window and saw the cusped cupola of the fountain.
      He had not forgotten that incident of a year ago, but the
      smart of it was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward sat back, put his fingers together, and became
      paternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask you a few questions, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of the future? Do you contemplate following an
      academic career, or--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a post graduate course, a demonstratorship, and
      ultimately, a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But there Mr. Ward paused. He had been about to say
      "Fellowship," but as a member of a famous fraternity his
      mellow humanism recoiled from a suggestion that might imply
      a social misalliance. J. J. Pope was not quite the person
      for the jocund conventions of a college Common Room. You
      could not see him drinking port, and enjoying a witty and
      slightly smutty story. He was a burr, not a round and
      sun-warmed apple. So, Mr. Ward, who was proud of himself as
      a man of the world and no mere donnish person, paused and
      reflected, and was wise as to possible incompatibilities.
      This little man might be exceedingly able, but he was the
      sort of fellow who made you feel uncomfortable, like a
      paragraph that would not come out nicely on paper. The
      silence was momentary, but J. J. Pope's acute self had
      divined some of its implications. Even his seniors might be
      a little shy of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Research, sir, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Pope, pure science. Do you propose to--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In London, sir. I shall go to one of the hospitals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Healing as well as research. What about the
      Fellowship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--the examination, sir, not the post?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ward pressed his finger-tips and his lips together.
      Damn the little fellow! Had he read his thoughts?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The examination, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a surgeon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surgery not sufficiently subtle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was irony in the remark Pope ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Limited, sir. The surgeon comes in at the end; my idea is
      to begin at the beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, Mr. Pope. And can you manage in London? I
      mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope's face seemed to become brightly hard and austere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I can always manage. I am not quite without friends."
    </p>

      Miss Jane Pope travelled to Cambridge to see John James
      take his degree. She travelled up with the knowledge that
      all Yatley knew that not only had her beloved taken a first
      in the Natural Science Tripos, but that he had headed the
      list. To the greater part of Yatley the word Tripos meant
      nothing at all, but it did gather that J. J. Pope had done
      brilliantly, and was a scholar of great repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe came down and congratulated Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James will end up as a professor. Well, well, well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe was genuinely pleased, because, being a man of
      some healthy wisdom, he did respect accomplishment, and
      knew that without it the world would be just a piggery,
      whatever the urgists might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock, the rector, drifted into Jane's shop, and made
      his characteristic and melancholy mumbling. It seemed to
      him extraordinary that Jackie Pope should be what--he--Mr.
      Cock was, a Bachelor of Arts. So much for Christian sense
      and humility! Moreover, Mr. Cock had scraped a second class
      in the Classical Tripos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, Miss Pope, it won't affect your nephew's,
      a'hem--head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Jane answered him with a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did it affect yours, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taking a degree."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock gazed at her, moon-eyed and sorrowful. Surely the
      woman should know that the conditions could not be
      compared, and that he, as the son of a Canon of Shrewsbury,
      had not suffered from inflation over, a'hem, a second
      class?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Jane felt sorry for him. He was a poor, spunkless
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you worry about James, Mr. Cock. He was born with a
      big head. So, you see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock did not see. A hereditary largeness of head did
      not prevent a young fellow from developing cerebral
      tumescence. Moreover, he was not really worrying about John
      James, for no one at the rectory was pleased by J. J.'s
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope it will be--so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Big heads have a right to feel big," said Miss Pope,
      rather tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Miss Pope travelled up to Cambridge in a June that did
      not flame in journalese, but was just old John Dreary the
      English clerk of the weather. J. J. had found rooms for
      her, and she sat in the gallery of the Senate House and
      watched that little figure in its hired white rabbit-skin
      kneel down to be dubbed bachelor. Aunt Jane's face was
      proud and maternal. This, in a sense, had been her life's
      job, and she was watching the fruition of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. and Aunt Jane walked back to St. Jude's, and climbed
      the stairs to the top floor. Miss Pope climbed them
      deliberately, for she was growing stout and short of
      breath. And there, in the narrow lobby, J. J. kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, for everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's you who have done it, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not without you, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've enjoyed it, my dear, every bit of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon was laid. J. J. had given thought and affection to
      that lunch. There was cold salmon and cucumber, and a
      gooseberry tart and cream. Miss Pope had a wholesome liking
      for good food. But the most significant offering was half a
      bottle of white wine, and good white wine. It was the first
      bottle of its kind that J. J. had ever purchased.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had gone up to London to interview the Dean of St.
      Mark's Hospital, and Miss Pope, it being a Wednesday and
      early closing day, sat under the Blenheim Orange with her
      Post Office Deposit Book in her lap. It was not that she
      was considering ways and means, but rather the manner and
      the inspiration of her purpose. Two or three more years
      would have to pass before John James would be a qualified
      doctor, and though he had assured her that he could live on
      two pounds a week and probably make that money himself,
      Miss Pope was not for niggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope smiled over her deposit book. It represented
      money and power, and money should be used. When she died,
      and she knew what J. J. did not know, that something was
      failing in her, all her money would be his. Why not equip
      him with a part of it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was to be back for tea. On a still day Yatley could
      hear the trains running in the valley, and Miss Pope heard
      the 3.25 go down to Dewhurst. In half an hour or so J. J.
      would be with her, and she rose and went in to put the
      kettle on, and cut her bread and butter. Raspberry jam?
      Yes, she would put out raspberry jam, and they would take
      their tea in the garden. J. J. liked to be out of doors,
      hatless, and often coatless, as though his large and active
      head and swift small body rebelled against anything that
      cramped and confined them. Miss Pope was carrying out the
      tea-tray when she heard the side door open and close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're early, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Larcombe gave me a lift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're having tea outside. Corrie and help."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew at once by his face that the day had not been too
      good a day for him. He would display a kind of brittle
      gaiety that could be ironic when he had met obstruction or
      unfriendliness, but he was not one of those blind egoists
      who could not see when a woman was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down. I'll do things. It's a bit stuffy to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had looked at her consideringly and affectionately, and
      she accepted his diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's the heat, my dear, the first we've had this
      year. I always wilt a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go and sit down. I'll do gyp."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her chair under the tree, knowing that he
      liked doing these things for her. Well, wasn't that a
      comfort after all these years? Also, it is usual for the
      young to be so self-absorbed that they expect things done
      for them, not to do them. J. J. was quite a capable cook;
      he did not mind helping to wash up; he always cleaned his
      own boots, and made his own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raspberry jam, Auntie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I thought you'd like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Shall I pour out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched his quick hands at work. Would he ever find a
      woman who could understand the significance of those hands?
      Miss Pope did not ask him questions; she waited; she could
      be wise in waiting. He always remembered that she liked two
      lumps of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help your glycogen, Auntie. Good stimulus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's glycogen, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sugar stored in your liver. I think the gentleman I
      met to-day must have had a liver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's a pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rather natural reaction, perhaps. Ward had written to
      him about me. A mistake, I imagine. People with hard-boiled
      heads don't like being prompted"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, rather like a large white egg, and a little stale. Or
      a gander in a bad temper. Almost hissed at me. I think I
      put my foot in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was spreading raspberry jam on his slice of bread and
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, like this. Ward must have spread too much jam on my
      reputation. I suppose these London chaps may feel
      prejudiced against someone who has been to Oxford or
      Cambridge. My friend the Dean was rather hoity-toity with
      me, and then I put my foot in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I explained that I had to keep myself, or wanted to, and I
      asked him whether I could do some coaching. He snubbed me;
      said that if a lame duck needed help, his own men ought to
      have the preference in the matter of fees, and that, in a
      sense, I was only an interloper. Well, of course, that's
      true."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope, sipping her tea, looked at him over her cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealousy, maybe. You'll get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just laugh it off, my dear. Besides, we need not bother
      about your Dean. I've had an idea. You know, John, you'll
      be having all my money, so I am going to let you have some
      of it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat very still, regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it a loan, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. We don't lend to those we love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have given me so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you've been my hobby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Auntie, I don't like the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge, John. What's the use of money lying idle? I call
      this an investment. Don't flout me, my dear. I want you to
      feel independent. I want you to have a place to work in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what you would call your lab. I expect you could get
      an extra room or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face lit up. He sat a moment, staring at his teacup.
      Then he got up and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. took a week's holiday, and he spent it in London. So
      far as medical education was concerned, the close season
      was approaching when most students were dispersed upon
      holidays, and the eminent members of the staff were to be
      found in Switzerland, or Austria, or shooting grouse and
      partridges, or just lazing in the country. J. J. was not a
      person who needed educating. He had taken his anatomy and
      physiology at Cambridge, and was as ready for the second
      part of his M. B. as any man could be. Self-education was
      the thing, getting your eyes and ears and hands to work
      upon the diseased and the sick, and that was the life of a
      hospital. He had been appointed clinical clerk to Sir James
      Fraser, a very delightful gentleman whose weakness lay in a
      prejudice in favour of exteriors. J. J. appeared in every
      possible out-patient department, eyes, nose and throat,
      skins, children, medical and surgical. Members of the staff
      began to ask each other the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that funny little chap who turns up like a poor
      relation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellow with the hydrocephalic head and infantile legs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the man. Does he come to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think its a fellow named Pope. Down from Cambridge.
      Supposed to be something rather special."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to snub him the other day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asked an infernal lot of questions, and had the cheek to
      argue about a point in chemistry."
    </p>
    <p>
      When enthusiasm for the truth oversteps discretion,
      seniority is apt to take offence. Students were expected to
      stand or sit in a respectful circle and be mute. J. J. was
      still reading German, and one afternoon, in a little
      lecture upon a new synthetic product originating in
      Germany, the physician in charge of a particular
      out-patient department, misquoted the monograph on the
      subject. No doubt, it was very unwise of J. J. to pipe up
      and correct him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Bergman meant so and so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The junior physician was a rather florid and dramatic
      person, and his colour increased, and his eyes became
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, sir, but I think Bergman--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who the devil are you?" said the eyes of seniority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The German version, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read German?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not very accurately."
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician, having administered the snub, continued with
      the case in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate that so early in his career J. J. Pope
      should have earned the reputation of being a prig. The
      member of the staff whom he had offended spoke openly of
      the incident to others in the hospital board-room. Who was
      this little fellow with the enlarged head who had the
      impertinence to argue with and correct his seniors? Sir
      James Fraser, under whom J. J. was clerking, was present
      during this conversation, and Sir James was not a lover of
      uppish young men who lacked both birth and manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of my clerks, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think a little reducing treatment is indicated, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of this was in the future, and at the moment J. J.
      Pope was staying for a few nights in an obscure and stuffy
      Bloomsbury boarding-house, while he explored the
      neighbourhood for rooms and a possible private lab. He had
      five hundred pounds to his credit, Aunt Jane's investment
      in faith, and no one but J. J. knew how profoundly that
      gift had affected him. All that he was and had accomplished
      he owed to himself and to this ageing woman who had given
      him a strangely impartial and unclutching affection.
      Bloomsbury was veritable Bloomsbury in those days, still
      smelling of the Georges, Dickens, and Vanity Fair, and the
      droppings of cab-horses and the great beasts which drew the
      railway vans over thundering stone-sets. It was solid and
      solemn, if not wholly respectable. Even the Foundling
      Hospital had implications of its own. The great squares
      with their plane trees were as significant as their names:
      Brunswick, Bedford, Russell, Mecklenburg. The tall railings
      hedged a guarded privilege, prospects of propriety and
      peace, and rightly so. Bloomsbury was still mahogany, and
      soft black brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unicorn Place accepted him. No. 7 was on the hospital
      lodging list, and the top-floor rooms were vacant at
      twenty-five shillings a week, including breakfast and a
      simple supper. Coal, of course, was extra, and only one
      meal was provided on Sundays. No. 7 was kept by a Mrs.
      Dally, and two tall grim daughters, Phoebe and Ophelia, and
      obviously those who had christened them had had no feeling
      for the future. If they had dallied, they were neither
      Phoebe nor Ophelia. The old lady was seen but rarely,
      rustling in black and coifed with a huge white cap. She
      looked exactly like an animated corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Phoebe who showed J. J. the rooms. She stood in
      the doorway, holding the brass handle of the mahogany door
      as though no unmarried woman should enter a room to be
      alone in it with a man. J. J. looked out of the window, and
      saw the trees of the Foundling Hospital and of Brunswick
      square, and obliquely a row of houses rising like a dark
      cliff. He could see a section of the hospital forecourt,
      and a part of one quaint white colonnade. There was space
      here, and a largeness of sky, and the umbrage of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, he listened vaguely to Miss Phoebe's dry
      declaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Latchkeys are provided, but we like our young gentlemen to
      be in by ten. Twenty-five shillings a week, coal
      half-a-crown a scuttle. A hot bath twice a week, sixpence
      extra."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was more absorbed in the view than in her ordinances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Handel still play the organ at the Foundling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe understood neither his puckishness, nor his
      lack of attention to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know the name of the organist. We sit under Mr.
      Spurgeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. turned to explore the bedroom which opened from the
      sitting-room. So, they sat under Mr. Spurgeon? Miss Phoebe
      Dally did not look much of a cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it you do the catering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Plain, good food, you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had disappeared into the bedroom. This, most
      certainly, was a celibate show where giggles and shy
      encounters upon the stairs would not vex him. The bedroom
      was a mere slip of a room, with the bed and a vast mahogany
      wardrobe confronting each other like two tyrannies
      competing for space, but the window did not give upon the
      street, and J. J., being a countryman, liked to sleep in
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty of cats, I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe Dally's very stupid eyes were hard pebbles
      below her sandy eyebrows. Cats, indeed! This young man
      appeared to be a very odd and rather ridiculous person.
      Cats, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her. The fanciful suggestion flitted to him
      that this creature was like a sandy cat in a gooseberry
      bush, glaring with ground-glass eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean in the gardens. You see, I read a great deal at
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe's reaction was instant, and concerned the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Late hours. We should have to charge extra for light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could use candles, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like the lights out at ten-thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was to discover that one or other of the austere
      daughters patrolled the stairs at night to look for slits
      of light under the doors, but the view from the window of
      No. 7, and its Georgian atmosphere pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take the rooms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like a deposit."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. produced two sovereigns from a purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her narrow, flat hand accepted the coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. When will you come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it the Dean sent you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I can vouch for my own respectability."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never once did she smile. In her drab life not even the
      dust danced when the sun shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. said farewell without regrets to his Bloomsbury
      boarding-house. It was not a place to eat in, much less to
      sleep in. The boiled cabbage, soapy potato, red-edged meat
      regime had antagonised his fastidious stomach, and he had
      slept between a fat man who snored, and a faded cantatrice
      who had practised the high notes while going to bed at any
      strange hour. Cheese, good butter and bread, and fresh
      fruit seemed to J. J. so much more wholesome than the
      messes that frowsy cooks and kitchens concocted. No. 7,
      Unicorn Place was an improvement. He could sleep here, and
      the food was plain but good. The Dally family might be lean
      and acid, but it did possess a kind of austere pride, and
      like many of the unlovely people it was efficient and
      honest.
    </p>

      It took J. J. a week to discover his lab. He found it in
      Mortimer Mews, a stable and coach-house which had been
      converted into a workshop by a dentist's mechanic who had
      gone elsewhere. Gas had been laid on, and the place
      promised to suit him admirably. The two little rooms above
      were let to a young woman who owned a part share in a small
      millinery and hat-shop in Roper's Row. J. J. paid a
      deposit, and became a yearly tenant, with the promise that
      if the rooms above him became vacant he should be given the
      chance to take them.

    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Fraser was going round his wards. His hair was
      silver, his colour high, his profile that of the English
      aristocrat. His name was Scotch, but since the family had
      been domiciled in London since the days of Charles II, Sir
      James thought and spoke of himself as English. He had had
      his portrait in the Academy; he attended royalty, and
      looked it, a very stately and confident person with a
      lovely and deliberate voice. His pleasure-pursuits were as
      dignified as his looks; he trained and flew falcons, was an
      authority on china and miniatures, and had written a book
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James enjoyed his ward work. He liked demonstrating
      cases to his clinical clerks and the little crowd of
      students who followed him. Being a looker, he preferred
      looks in young men, and the manners that should go with
      looks. Nor, it must be confessed, did he not like a young
      man to be too clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James stood six feet, one inch, J. J. Pope five feet,
      two. J. J. had to look up at Sir James, and Sir James to
      look down at J. J. Little men with very great ability have
      the reputation of being bumptious, and Sir James could
      quote Louis Quatorze and Napoleon as examples, and French
      ones at that. Nor did J. J. Pope look quite English; he was
      Celtic or even Iberian. Sir James had discovered that
      whenever he asked a question this young man with the large
      head and the infantile legs could always answer it, and J.
      J. Pope's ready response limited the scope of a bedside
      lecture. Sir James rather liked to have puzzled faces round
      him waiting to hear his exposition of the case. This damned
      little fellow was too final.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, Sir James fell to addressing his questions to the
      three other clinical clerks, and ignoring J. J. Pope.
      Grimes, the house-physician, was equally unattracted by a
      fellow who seemed to know too much. The partiality was
      obvious, especially so to J. J. Sir James' favourite was
      Falconer, a tall, comely lad, a Blue who had rowed for
      Leander and won the Grand at Henley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falconer was not very bright upon diagnosis. He had rowing
      hands, but not a doctor's hands, and his handsome head was
      bovine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened this way. The case was a pneumonia, and Sir
      James asked a particular question, with his eyes on
      Falconer. Falconer smiled, looked perplexed and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The percussion note is exaggerated above--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James turned quickly upon J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you kindly wait, Mr. Pope, until I address the
      question to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. flushed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snub was drastic, and the audience sniggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. took that public affront home with him to Unicorn
      Place. Had he been too officiously knowledgeable, or were
      there other and deeper reasons for Sir James' prejudice?
      That horrid phrase "Class Consciousness" had recently been
      born, but J. J. even in his most bitter moments, had too
      much wisdom to be fooled by such a phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the snub had hurt him. He admired Sir James Fraser both
      as a man and a physician. He would have liked to be liked
      by him. What a strange thing was human incompatibility!
      Yet, was it so strange? The mysterious alchemy of human
      emotions! Peter Pratten liked him, and Peter was a large
      and handsome person, so it wasn't just a matter of looks
      and of size. As a rule J. J. took his tea at an Aerated
      Bread shop in Holborn, a penny bun and a twopenny cup of
      tea, but to-day he renounced his tea. He was fitting up his
      lab. in Mortimer Mews, and he went straight to the job that
      would soothe and distract him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unlocking the door when he heard footsteps on the
      stairs. They were coming down lightly and swiftly and with
      all the snap of youth. He saw a pair of neat black shoes, a
      swinging skirt bellying out under the play of the knees. J.
      J. had not seen his neighbour, but he had heard her singing
      overhead, not like his friend the cantatrice, but making a
      kind of pleasant crooning like a dove in a tree on a hot
      day in summer. Suddenly, her face came into view, crowned
      by a contraption that was called a toque, black velvet set
      with pansies. J. J., his hand still on the key, stared at
      her obliquely. He saw the pansies in her hat, and her face
      was just like that flower, an amber-coloured pansy with
      strange dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl paused abruptly on the bottom step, one hand on
      the rail. Even her regard had a pansy seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you the new one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. returned the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I am. Is it better to be new or old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His puckishness seemed to provoke this Alice in Wonderland
      to secret laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, new, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was the other one--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, old and cross, and always coughing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm cross sometimes, but I don't cough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a doctor, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite yet. Suppose I'd better introduce myself. John
      James Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her very dark eyes flickered fun at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Kitty Jewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moonstone and agate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds rather nice. But I must be going. Mary's been
      in charge all day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the lamb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expressive lips curled back over very white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, our shop. And I've got a customer to fit. Good-bye,
      Mr. John James Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Miss Moonstone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped past him, and he stood staring after her as a
      faun might have watched a nymph disappearing into a wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was the light overhead! And she kept a shop in
      partnership with Mary! J. J. passed into the room that was
      to be his lab. and his feeling about things was that. Miss
      Kitty Jewell was not quite your conventional shop-keeper. A
      little unusual, like his feelings!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he began to potter about in his new sanctum, rigging up
      rubber tubing to his Bunsen burner and his incubator, he
      was conscious of an inward warmth and a sense of perfume.
      Those sombre eyes and that amber-coloured hair! Rather an
      unusual mixture, like a Titian type. Vitality, a blending
      of child and woman, a joy in life that was infectious.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had almost forgotten Sir James and the snubbing the
      great man had administered to him. This woman child had
      smiled at him. She was friendly, and somehow real, not the
      product of family snobbery and suspicion. Perhaps she was
      an orphan like he was, and so had escaped the heavy hand of
      parental interference. J. J. lit his Bunsen lamp, and saw
      that it functioned happily. The room possessed a sink, and
      a water-tap, shelves, and a bench by the window. J. J. got
      out his microscope and his histology box. The lab. was
      beginning to feel like home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Miss Kitty Jewell was hurrying to Ropers Row,
      walking with a little lilt that might so easily have become
      a skipping or a dance. All her movements were quick and
      vital, but without restlessness, like the movements of a
      sensitive and intelligent child. Those sombre eyes of hers
      could light up and laugh. Men looked at her admiringly, and
      she knew it, and was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little shop in Ropers Row had one window and a side
      door. The window displayed hats and a <i>mélange</i> of
      millinery. Kitty opened the door, and found her friend and
      partner Mary, sitting on a stool, sewing. The shop was
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I'm late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was dark, placid, and fat. She looked with a maternal
      air at her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much. Mrs. Gates hasn't turned up yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go and have your tea, dear. I lost a minute with my
      new neighbour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary eyed her consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young or old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young. Going to be a doctor. Funny little man, no taller
      than I am. He's got a head like a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Melon. No, not quite like that. A big hot-cross bun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't sound very dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, but I think I like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sisterly, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer Mews and Unicorn Place became contrasts in J. J.'s
      consciousness. At 7, Unicorn Place he sat like Keats at his
      high window, and dreamed dreams in which the human tissues
      and juices were woven into a strange tapestry. Why this,
      why that? How little could the text-books tell you when you
      delved below the surface, and shed the sacerdotal solemnity
      of mere words. Why Kitty Jewell, why the Misses Phoebe and
      Ophelia Dally? J. J. liked to gaze at the tops of his
      trees, but Mortimer Mews had its beauty--of a sort. When
      you entered it you saw rows of green and blue coach-house
      doors, the pattern of old black brickwork, inquisitive
      windows, chimney-pots, none of which seemed alike, here and
      there a window-box. Perhaps cabs and carriages were being
      washed and polished, or put away. The smell of manure hung
      in the air; little heaps of it were stacked against the
      walls before being carted off. They steamed. Women
      gossiped, children played, noisy children. It was a very
      human scene, London in its intimate mood, redolent of sweat
      and dung.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did not divine sepsis here. Miss Jewell had a
      window-box full of petunias above his workshop. That,
      somehow, was a sign and a symbol. The very vitality of the
      place confounded hygienic and critical dreariness. To
      J.J.'s country mind it always seemed that the supercilious
      and critical mind was sterile, and needed a good dunging.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that in the evening Miss Jewell sat and sewed
      at her window, and while she sewed she sang, not
      continuously so but like a wind coming and going and making
      a languorous murmuring. J. J. might be at his microscope,
      or mixing up experimental concoctions, and her voice crept
      into his consciousness. Didn't she ever go out? She did.
      One evening a rather dressy young man knocked at the door
      that was both J.J.'s and Miss Jewell's, and Pope went to
      open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked surprised. He had, John thought,
      rather nasty, sleepy, insolent eyes, and his socks and tie
      were full of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jewell live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was suspicion in the young man's eyes. Who was this
      funny little fellow who appeared to share Miss Jewell's
      hutch?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that my business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man went sulkily up the stairs and knocked at the
      lady's door. It was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, kid! Coming out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jewell did go out with him. J. J. saw them pass his
      window. The young man appeared to be wanting to slip an arm
      under Miss Jewell's, but she was not wanting it. She drew
      apart, her arms pressed to her body. J. J. was displeased,
      and caught himself questioning his right to be displeased.
      And the reason thereof? He frowned, and glued his eye to
      the eyepiece of his microscope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was falling, and he had finished for the night,
      and was about to go out and lock his door and return to
      Unicorn Place, when Miss Jewell and the young man
      reappeared. J. J. saw their faces, the young man's turgid
      and sulky, the girl's pale and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, kid, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shut up. Leave me alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man caught her by the arm, and J. J. moved to
      sudden anger, opened both doors and appeared on the
      threshold. Kitty Jewell was trying to shrug him off. She
      turned quickly to J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Pope, would you mind telling this gentleman to
      leave me alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure. Do you mind getting out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glared at J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mind your own business, damn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see, you're her bully. Not much of one, at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden blaze came into J. J.'s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out, you cad. We have friends here who know how to
      deal with your kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was true, for a couple of cabmen, who were off duty,
      had edged up, and one of them was young and pretty handy
      with his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheap toff, what! You let the girl alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man showed his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody's tart, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Jehu smote him, and so suddenly and successfully
      that he needed no further coercion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had fled up the stairs, and J. J. having watched the
      retreat of Juan, and exchanged a few friendly words with
      the cabmen, returned to the foot of the stairs. That
      beastly word had shocked him. He found himself wondering
      whether the thing could be true. He had never thought of
      Miss Moonface in that way. Poisonous swine! Such poison
      stuck. It infected even the innocent. But was he being
      God's own babe? How did he know that Miss Jewell kept a
      shop, and whether she belonged or not to the sisterhood of
      the Magdalen?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing there, hesitant and frowning, when he heard
      a particular sound. His head lifted with a jerk. He
      listened, looking up the steep and narrow stairs. Next
      moment he was climbing the stairs. The sounds were quite
      definite, and they moved him most strangely. Something in
      him trembled. He raised a hand and knocked gently at her
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Pope. Can I do anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, go away, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were more sobs, and he turned to go, both angry and
      compassionate. What a beastly thing sex could be when it
      was without tenderness and pity, just raw, red meat! He was
      halfway down the stairs when her door opened suddenly. She
      was leaning over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Pope, I'm sorry I was rude."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think you rude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't believe it, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little gulp, and applying a crumpled
      handkerchief to her nose, blew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you so much. I--I didn't think he was that sort.
      And I'm not that sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you're not. We all know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest thing about it was that J. J. did believe
      her, and in believing her was to foreshadow one of the
      greatest curative forces that he, as an unorthodox healer,
      was to discover, or rather, rediscover, for the thing was
      as old as time. People wanted to be believed in; people
      wanted to feel well with themselves, and with others. The
      man or woman who feels poor and inferior, may behave in a
      poor and inferior way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did J. J. realise what he had done. At one of those
      anguished moments in a child's life he had touched her with
      the healing hand of faith. A healer must believe in
      himself, and in the essential goodness of others. More than
      that, J. J. himself had ceased to be a funny little man
      with a Bath-bun head. To Kitty Jewell he had become a
      person, significant and somehow strange. From that time she
      began to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did not see her again until two evenings later. He
      had crossed the cobbles of the mews to swap a word or two
      with Joe Clements, the cabbie who had smitten Lothario. Joe
      was cleaning harness, and blowing over it as he did when he
      groomed a horse. He was a dark Cockney, lean, and black of
      hair, with a big nose and a sardonic mouth. Because of his
      nose he was known as Conkie, but only his intimates were
      allowed to use that nickname.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more trouble, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said Joe, "that dirty tyke didn't want a second
      outin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can punch, Mr. Clements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe grinned at him. From that moment he was J. J.'s
      faithful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a bit of a kick. Nuff t' make a decent gal go
      funny, bein' called a thing like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse than murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, in a manner of speakin'. And she not deservin'
      it. Just a jolly kid, y'know, and not thinkin' any wrong of
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at Mr. Clements with sudden affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course. You and I understand each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. walked on, and Joe spat and watched him curiously.
      Funny little josser, but right sort of stuff. Bit of a nob
      he had too, and probably plenty inside it. J. J. was
      looking up at the box of petunias. A face swam into view
      like the moon, and smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. raised his bowler hat. It was a very large hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening. Your flowers look pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, don't they? I'm afraid they won't last much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you do then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, nothing. Just wait for next year. Or put other sorts
      of flowers in my hats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pansies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the hats I make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course. And where is your hat-shop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know Roper's Row?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's called 'Nanette.' That was Mary's idea. Mary is my
      partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her, grew suddenly shy and disappeared from
      her view. He felt that he had been indulging in rather
      childish babble, but pleasant babble. After all life wasn't
      just a time-table or a sheet of formulae and if you
      couldn't play the child sometimes, you must be something of
      a dullard. J. J. unlocked his door, and sat down to his
      microscope. He had stained and mounted some sections, but
      as he gazed steadfastly down the brass tube he seemed to
      see yellow pansies in a black velvet hat.

      August was ending with a heat-wave, and the black-coated
      world may have wished to shed its coat and parade in
      shirt-sleeves, but the conventions forbade. Mortimer Mews
      was more fortunate in this respect than Unicorn Place. Mr.
      Joe Clements could suck a straw and lean against a shady
      wall in his shirt-sleeves, and cast secret and longing
      glances at a particular window, but Joe Clements had a wife
      and family, and sufficient crude sense to know when the
      moon was a moon. J. J. had taken tea at his Aerated Bread
      shop and was returning to Unicorn Place. The great planes
      in the squares were still and somnolent; window blinds were
      down. J. J. walked in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had slipped his latchkey into the door of No. 7 and was
      swinging back the big blue door, when another door opened,
      that of the Dally private sitting-room. Miss Phoebe stood
      there with something orange-yellow in her hand. Her hand
      too looked yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Telegram for you, Mr. Pope. Came about three o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stared at the envelope in her hand. A telegram!
      Telegrams were not usual in his world. He took it from Miss
      Phoebe, and climbing the stairs, paused on the first
      landing. He slit the envelope, drew out the form, and
      unfolded it and read:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Come at once, Miss Pope ill. Florrie."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s face went all twisted. It is at such moments that a
      man realises who matters to him in a world of casual human
      shapes. Aunt Jane ill! What was it? Heart? Frowning, he
      went slowly down the stairs, and knocked at the Dally door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe opened it. Her face looked lean and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to go down into the country at once. My aunt is
      ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe's cat's-eyes stared. In her arid life anything
      that made for sensation was welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not serious, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet. I expect I shall be away for a night or
      two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be quite all right, Mr. Pope. Shall we cook your
      supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm going at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley seemed very cool and green after London. It was
      habit and not economy that made J. J. walk from Dewhurst to
      Yatley, though, if he had chartered one of the station
      cabs, the crawling old horse would have taken as long to go
      by the road as J. J. took by the field-paths. It was one of
      those close evenings when even thinking makes one sweat,
      and when J. J. came to the beech walk his shirt was
      sticking to him. There was always a breeze under these
      beeches, and J. J. sat down on a bank, took off his hat and
      mopped himself. When he came out of the shade of the trees
      and saw the village green in the glow of the evening, he
      knew that he did not want to meet people. There was a path
      across the churchyard, and he took it, but to reach the
      lane that ran beside his aunt's fence, J. J. had to
      scramble over the low wall. He did not go to the front
      door, but slipped in by the back gate in the boarded fence.
      Miss Florence Mercer was sitting under the apple tree in
      Miss Pope's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that an omen? J. J. was not pleased to see her sitting
      there. Her back was towards him, and he took her by
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was curt and rough. Miss Mercer got up with a
      little scream. She was that sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you did give me a start! But I'm glad you've come.
      Miss Pope's had a stroke."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stood very still, gripping his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How bad is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty bad, I'm afraid. It must have been the heat. She
      can't speak, and her face is all drawn down one side. Dr.
      Dibble's been twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't help much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't say such things, you shouldn't, reely," and
      Florrie burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Mercer was a good soul, if rather stupid and
      elemental, and J. J. understood that emotion affected
      people in different ways. It made him abrupt and laconic,
      not towards the very particular few, but to the casual
      many.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Florence. Yes, she has been a good friend to both
      of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has that," blubbed Florrie, "neighbours used to think
      her hard, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I'll go up. Does she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she hasn't lost her senses. But her poor smile--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she can smile. She would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And make signs. You'll have to write, or ask her what she
      wants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence was dabbing her eyes, and J. J. left his bag in
      the garden, and entered that familiar house. Here were all
      the old friendly smells which seemed to permeate it from
      the shop. The grandfather clock tick-tocked at the foot of
      the stairs, like the very heart of the house. And the human
      house was in ruins!
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of Aunt Jane's room. It had been so
      familiar to him as a child with its chintz-covered
      dressing-table, and simple furniture, the oak press and
      painted chest of drawers. There had been nights when he had
      dreamed bad dreams, and Aunt Jane had appeared like God in
      a nightdress and carried him off to be comforted in her
      bed. The blind was down, and he saw her large white face on
      the pillow. She had slipped down in the bed, and J. J. knew
      that she should be propped up. He went to her, and kissed
      her, and the one hand she could use fumbled with his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all he could say, and she could answer him only
      with human noises, a parody of speech, like an animal
      trying to talk. He raised her up and rearranged her
      pillows. Her poor face looked all lop-sided, and it hurt
      him to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed, and made strange noises. What did she want?
      More light? He went and pulled up the blind, and looked at
      her questioningly. Yes, that was it. He saw a crooked
      smile, a toothless smile. Her dentures had been taken out.
      He had a horrid feeling that he was regarding a precious
      person who suddenly had become senile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down beside the bed, and took her hand. Its fingers
      closed on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to look after you, Auntie. You mustn't worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the pressure of her fingers. Her eyes stared. She
      looked frightened. Poor soul, what dumbness and
      bewilderment must be hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worrying about something, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The shop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll look after the shop. Florrie and I can manage till
      you are about again."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In J. J. was the knowledge that Aunt Jane would never be
      about again, and perhaps she knew it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley saw him next morning taking down the shutters of the
      shop. He was in his shirt sleeves, and wearing a white
      apron. Yatley marvelled, but it approved. There was little
      that J. J. did not know about the village shop, for, as a
      child he had played at keeping shop, and in his later days
      he often had helped Miss Pope to check stock and prepare
      orders. Its tiers of shelves and rows of drawers were as
      familiar as his own workshelves had been, and he knew where
      all the various entities lived; tobacco, pipes, matches,
      cards of darning-wool, bootlaces, hairpins, buttons, reels
      of ribbon, slippers, sugar, tea, condiments, rice, sago,
      and what not. He took his place behind the counter as
      though his being there was the most natural thing in the
      world. J. J. Pope, B.A., weighing out cheese, and slicing
      bacon! Florrie Mercer, behind her brass grill, watched him
      and marvelled. Florrie was eight years older than he was,
      and still cherished a sentimental affection for him, an
      affection that had not lost all hope. How nice it would be
      if she and John were running the shop together in double
      harness, for the business would be J. J.'s if Miss Pope
      passed over. But then, of course, a bachelor of arts and a
      future physician could not be limited in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe, strolling in to inquire for Miss Pope, found
      John cutting rashers of bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, John, my lad! Deputising, what! How is your aunt
      to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much the same, sir, I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you get down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe was thinking: "Well, damn it, this is the
      right sort of lad. Not ashamed to turn to in a crisis. Not
      like our friend, the--Well, never mind." Mr. Larcombe
      bought two ounces of navy cut, stuffed the tin into his
      pocket, and sat sideways on the counter. He tapped on the
      floor with his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see, what time do you close, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six-thirty, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In time to come up and have some dinner with us. We meal
      at seven-thirty. What about it? Just as you are, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s face lit up. This was a good and jocund gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should love to come, sir, if--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone can be with your aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll ask Florrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mercer was moon-eyed behind her grill. J. J. asked to
      dine at the Hall! Well, well, well! That, in football
      journalese, put paid to all her dreams. But why should not
      J. J. dine at the Hall? He was the cleverest man in the
      village. J. J. had finished cutting rashers, and was
      carefully cleaning the knife. He glanced across at Florrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you do that for me, Florrie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Florrie. I'll just go up and tell Miss Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Aunt Jane heard the news her poor face broke into a
      toothless smile, yet there was beauty in that smile. J. J.
      was going to dine at the Hall. Was she pleased? Indeed she
      was. This was a kind of triumphant finale played while her
      little ship slipped down the river. Mr. Larcombe had always
      been the gentleman, a real gentleman, and this was a
      gentleman's gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind if I go, Auntie? Florrie will be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She managed to nod her head at him. Of course he was to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. returned to the shop to find the melancholy Mr. Cock
      buying stamps from Florrie. J. J., in shirt-sleeves and
      apron, appeared to reduce the rector to a state of fumbling
      pomposity. So many tart and unpleasant things were said to
      him at home that wherever he opened his mouth in the parish
      the vicarage sour milk overflowed from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Pope, reverting to normal, I see. How is your poor
      aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. picked up a duster, and flicked the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Able to smile, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock's eyebrows went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! At such a time, I understand, one reverts to
      childishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock seemed very fond of the word revert. J. J. went on
      flicking the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, sir. Senility is
      of varying degrees, and is discovered at all ages."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cock looked puzzled. Now, what did the young fellow
      mean by that? Surely, no sarcasm was concealed behind an
      apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust that she will not be left too crippled, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there cripples in heaven, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a poser, and perhaps a most subtly offensive
      question, and Mr. Cock left it to the boots, the butter,
      and the bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dibble's dogcart drew up outside the shop while J. J.
      was helping to unload some cases which the carriers' van
      had brought from Dewhurst station. Dr. Dibble had nothing
      to say about J. J.'s adaptations, nor about his apron, but
      his impression was that a man so completely undistinguished
      physically as John James Pope could not be expected to
      succeed as a physician. Personal appearance could not be
      ignored, and as Dr. Dibble watched J. J. struggle in with a
      case of sugar, it seemed to him that the box had been
      endowed with a pair of little legs. The deed might be a
      worthy deed, but surely young Pope was making an exhibition
      of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Pope, how's the patient?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., clutching the box, confronted the Dewhurst doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather an extensive haemorrhage, I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dibble had no sense of humour, but a lively feeling for the
      ridiculous--in others. Had the sugar-box spoken?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better put that down, Pope. Rather heavy for you. Then
      we'll talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. staggered through the shop doorway like a small boy
      carrying the band's big drum. No doubt Dr. Dibble would do
      the talking, using those long words which had become
      sacrosanct in the profession, words which J. J. was
      beginning to question and mistrust. For, the greater the
      ignorance, the more pompous and pedantic became the
      language. So few men appeared to arrive at that state of
      sincerity which accepts the simple text--"I do not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., having got rid of his box, left the shop to Florrie,
      and accompanied Dr. Dibble upstairs. Dr. Dibble sat down by
      the bed, and spoke like a very sure nurse to a sick child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, how are we to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To J. J., standing at the foot of the bed, his aunt's face
      was a poor stolid, twisted mask. Had she been frightened?
      Of course she must have been frightened. To be suddenly
      helpless, and speechless, can make you feel that you have
      been buried alive. Miss Pope just stared at Dr. Dibble.
      There was a curious, dumb hostility in that stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dibble nodded pontifically, glanced meaningly at J. J.
      and proceeded to feel Miss Pope's pulse. Plainly, the
      patient's mentality had suffered; the human husk was here,
      minus the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, pressure lower, I think. That is excellent. Now, my
      dear woman, just lie quiet. No worry, no thinking about
      things. Here is your nephew looking after the shop for you.
      Nothing for you to worry about, nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope's face remained vacant and dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ass!" thought J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Dibble had gone, J. J. returned to his aunt's
      room, and sitting down beside her, placed a hand on hers.
      No words passed between them. The pressure of hand upon
      hand was sufficient. J. J., sitting there with a peculiar
      and very gentle smile upon his face, was wondering whether,
      after all, there was very much difference between Dr.
      Dibble's bottles of physic and old Tom Pratten's patent
      pills. Both paraded a convention, one that advertisements
      never lied, the other that the doctor always knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope's fingers closed upon J. J.'s. She mumbled
      something, and J. J. turned his head to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, dear? Anything I can get you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope's head rolled negatively on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it that Dr. Dibble is a damned old ass?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jane Pope nodded most emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But, for J. J., the day's finale was yet to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cutting a Dutch cheese in half for Mrs. Blundell,
      the butcher's wife, when one of the new automobiles pulled
      up outside the shop. Its colour was green, picked out with
      red, its metal-work brass, its origin French. Florrie,
      peering through the window to look at the new monstrosity,
      let out a characteristic exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, young Strange, and his girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was taken by surprise. The Stranges of Hardacre were
      little more than names to him. He was aware of two young
      people drifting into the shop, the man in flannels and a
      dark blue blazer, the girl in white. He glanced first at
      the young man, cool, stupidly comely, sleepily and
      sensually self-assured. So, this was young Strange whom all
      the girls thought wonderful, and his elders a conceited and
      spoilt young cub. J. J.'s knife was half-way through the
      cheese. He looked at the girl, and his knife remained
      motionless, embedded in the cheese. For this was the dark
      child of his dreams, that most strange and mysterious
      creature in whom all the poignant loveliness of life seemed
      consecrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got any Egyptian cigarettes by any chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid not, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought it was a vain hope. Well try Dewhurst. Come on,
      Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Syb. indeed! Blatant young savage! They drifted out as they
      had drifted in, and J. J.'s knife resumed its cutting of
      the cheese. One thing he had realised. The girl had not
      even looked at him. Possibly, she had been aware of him as
      a vague entity in an apron whose world was no more than
      cheese and bacon.

      Miss Jane Pope died in her sleep, probably as the result of
      a second haemorrhage. J. J., knocking at her door very
      early in the morning, and getting no reply, not even one of
      those inarticulate sounds that passed for speech, entered,
      and in the dim light realised that death was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a sudden and profound feeling of
      desolation. This old woman was the one person in the world
      to whom he had been able to talk, and to whom he owed all
      that he was and all that he might be. She had been even
      more than a mother to him, in that she had never clutched
      or assumed that because he was her child she had the
      blood-right of blind maternal authority. J. J., with a pang
      at the heart and a sense of emptiness in his stomach, went
      and pulled up the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early sunlight came slanting in, and down below he saw
      the old Blenheim Orange set with fruit, fruit that she
      would never pluck again. The Apples of The Hesperides!
    </p>
    <p>
      No outward emotion showed in him. He went and put his lips
      to her forehead, and its chilliness shocked him. That
      coldness of the flesh was so quick and final.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some impulse made him speak aloud to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Aunt Jane. You and I know how much I owe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that the shutters of the shop were up. Were
      they to remain up? Life had to go on. Women would need tea
      and cheese, and the Postmaster General took no account of
      death, but J. J. decided that those shutters should remain
      up. He would open the door, and carry on in the dim
      half-light, and the village would understand. Those who
      failed to understand could go to Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. knew where his aunt's will was kept, in the little
      old safe behind the sitting-room door, and where her keys
      would be, but he explored neither her top drawer nor the
      safe. Somehow he shrank from rushing to make sure that he
      had become a minor capitalist. All the formalities should
      be left to Mr. Roper of Dewhurst, his aunt's lawyer, and J.
      J. sent a boy off with a letter to Mr. Roper. What he did
      seek was a black tie, and the search proved elusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do we stock ties, Florrie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mercer was subdued and depressed. She might be out of
      a job, and she had lost a good friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Black ones?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do remember. In the drawer with the socks."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were rummaging about together in the half darkness
      when Mrs. Cock came into the shop, or rather, into the
      doorway, and darkened it still further. Her need was a
      postal order for two-and-sixpence, and somehow she had not
      tumbled to the fact that the closed shutters spelled death.
      Mrs. Cock was a lady whose hobby was the discovery of a
      universal slackness always and everywhere. Here was Miss
      Pope laid up, and these two lazy young people still had the
      shutters up at nine o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would like some attention, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had just found a tie that appeared to be black, and
      was carrying it to the doorway to make sure, and Mrs. Cock
      was cutting off the light. She was large, and ominous, with
      pince-nez perched on a formidable nose. J. J. had always
      hated Mrs. Cock. To his young senses she had always
      suggested pale pork and vinegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, if you don't mind, would like a little light."
    </p>
    <p>
      What gross impertinence!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, young man. I understand that the post office
      should be open at eight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is open. Miss Mercer, will you please attend to the
      lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He edged round her and found the tie to be veritable black.
      Mrs. Cock glared at it and at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Mr. Pope, you attend to yourself before you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did not so much as look at her. He turned back into
      the dark chasm of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Miss Jane Pope's death came to be mentioned at the
      Hardacre luncheon-table may be a matter of conjecture, but
      mentioned it was, and the conversation was carried over to
      rest upon Miss Pope's nephew. Lady Strange happened to be
      one of the two who had seen J. J. dancing naked as a small
      boy on Yatley Heath, and her description of the incident
      seemed to rouse her son to a sudden and unusual outburst of
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, wouldn't that explain Sybil's pile of clothes,
      little Johnnie Pope gone native?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother gave him one of those secret and considering
      looks which a sensitive woman may give to the barbarian
      stranger in a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think, Syb.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil Marwood played with her wine-glass. It was of a
      delicate green and contained hock. Lawrie's abbreviations
      were characteristic and too crudely intimate, as was his
      love-making. He exaggerated the trick of the English in
      cutting syllables and names. He spoke of 'untin' and
      shootin'. To him everybody was Edie or Johnnie, Freddie or
      Bobbie, Edgie or Aggie, or just Syb. He had a fine
      exterior, no dignity, and a completely banal mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interestin'. That was the little fellah in the shop.
      Counter-jumper B.A. Rum little squit."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother looked pathetic. She had produced for her son a
      very charming creature and he called her Syb. Would nothing
      educate Lawrence?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Pope is a very brilliant person. Took everything
      before him up at Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little stodger. It always makes me laugh when I see his
      legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil Marwood put down her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look at his head, Lawrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Good lord, no! A bun-head. Rather funny a B. A. dishing
      out cheese."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why funny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, isn't it? Sort of Dan Leno business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil turned to Lady Strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he really do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do what, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dance naked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Quite pagan and pretty. Like a little tiny Pan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to ask him to perform for you, Syb.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might," said she, with a twinge of malice. "It might be
      more interestin' than seein' you shootin' rabbits."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a coolness between them that afternoon. Lawrie
      was good at killing things, and yet he had for Sybil
      Marwood the elemental appeal of the male. It was the
      Maurice Hewlett period, and Sybil's mood was fantastic and
      feudal, and maybe the girl in her wished wilfully to find
      in Lawrence Strange both Richard Yea and Nay and Prosper le
      Gai. And she would be Iseult not Maulfry. She was Iseult in
      all her wild, sleek darkness. Moreover, Hardacre, crowning
      its wooded hill, might have been Hauterive, and all that
      lovely Surrey valley-land and the Weald beyond the great
      ridge, pure phantasy. Sybil had experienced the crabbed and
      confined routine of both Cheltenham and St. Leonards, where
      a colonel's widow devoted herself to making a pension
      suffice and to playing croquet. Sybil loathed croquet. It
      was a mean, sneaking sort of game suited to old people's
      cunning. She had colour and temper, and perhaps she
      preferred Lawrie's crude killing of things to the crowding
      of balls through hoops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being what she was, that picture of a small boy dancing
      naked among the Yatley beeches piqued her fancy. A faunlike
      creature, unadulterated Keats! If, for the moment, she had
      had a surfeit of Lawrence and his rather too confident
      love-making, she may have been lured by curiosity into
      exploring the shopman's world. Yes, it was rather
      intriguing to contemplate a Bachelor of Arts weighing out
      cheese and slicing bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. happened to be alone in the half-darkened shop,
      bending over the counter, and reading by the light which
      entered by the doorway, a page of his aunt's journal. Mr.
      Roper had found it in the safe, and had passed it as
      immediate inheritance to John James. Mr. Roper had been
      able to tell him that he had inherited about seventeen
      hundred pounds, plus the shop's stock and the good will of
      the business. J. J. had known of his aunt's journal, but he
      had never seen inside its pages, and now he was absorbed in
      some of the pithy sayings of this shrewd and simple
      countrywoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like to blame in others that which is secretly
      blameworthy in ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you haven't got a pony and trap, you'll find some
      reason for disapproving of those who have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't have much to do with unlucky people. It isn't luck,
      but the wrong way they have come out of the shell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giving credit makes you enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was more to the journal than these rather caustic
      sayings. Some of it was almost biblical. Aunt Jane had not
      sat under Mr. Cock, but she had sat in the presence of a
      consciousness of God. There were sayings too about flowers
      and fruit, and how the country made you feel in spring and
      autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beech tree is the Lord of the Woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. read things about himself, secret and intimate
      observings that moved him deeply. How this aged woman had
      watched and reflected!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The child has a lovely nature, but you must not cross
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that true?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, some intervening body shut off the light from the
      book that lay before him, and J. J., lifting his head and
      expecting a customer, saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped into the shadows, or rather J. J. would have
      said she glided in on a little carpet of sunlight. He
      straightened and stood with his hands resting on the
      counter. He was there to serve, and no doubt she expected
      service, the kind of service which Hardacre House claimed
      from the world. There was silence, a curious pause, with
      her slim white figure poised there, head up, in the space
      between the counters. She had come in so confidently, so
      sure of herself and of the homage her very loveliness
      seemed to make inevitable, and suddenly she was shy, mute,
      unable to think of the excuse that should have been so
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., waiting there, was puzzled. Did she expect him to
      ask her what her need was?
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost she looked at him askance. His voice was so
      different from her idea of his surroundings and their
      implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wondered. I mean, is the shop open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What can I get you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted some notepaper. But it seems a shame to bother
      you just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her steadfastly, and as though he did not
      believe her. That was her impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shops have to keep open. I'm afraid we have only cheap
      boxes of stationery. I'll look. Won't you sit down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew now that ever since entering the shop she had lost
      control of the situation. The control was his. Nor had she
      ever been looked at in quite that way before, as though she
      was a picture to be both admired and criticised. This funny
      little man had most disconcerting eyes. And she rather
      prided herself on her young poise and her power to subdue
      the eyes of young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't bother, if it is much trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No trouble at all," said J. J. almost casually, poking
      about in a dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Stationery seemed to be proving elusive,
      and the situation was less and less hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please don't trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll find it. I'm not quite so familiar with things as I
      might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. Weren't you up at Cambridge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "St. Jude's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember dancing there, after May Week."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had found what he wanted. He produced two cardboard
      boxes, and placed them on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I saw you. I'm afraid this is all we have.
      The demand in Yatley for superior stationery is, I'm
      afraid, rather limited."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bannisters at Dewhurst have a better selection. Grey and
      cream, and envelopes to match. Rather poor quality, I'm
      afraid. Perhaps you would prefer to leave it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a feeling of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take the grey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Let me see, that will be one and tenpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that she discovered that she had forgotten her
      purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How silly of me. Perhaps you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next time you are passing, certainly. Or would you like me
      to book it? Hardacre House, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wrapping up the box, and his hands were deliberate
      and very much under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, next time I am in Yatley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be quite all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her the parcel, and stood like the polite
      salesman who had completed his service, and was waiting for
      her to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought him a horrid little man. But why?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jane Pope lay in the new God's acre of Yatley, and J.
      J. was wondering what to do with her possessions. Some of
      them he would not and could not sell, personal things,
      pieces of furniture which had been as much a part of his
      life as of hers. But her clothes! What did one do with a
      dead woman's clothes, especially so when they had belonged
      to a woman who was old? Sell them to a dealer in
      second-hand clothes? Rather a beastly idea! Give them away
      to the poor of the village? Yatley did possess four
      alms-houses inhabited by very old women, and J. J. walked
      up to Yatley House and asked the advice of Mr. Larcombe.
      Mr. Larcombe was the chairman of the Yatley Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would the old people like the clothes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, most certainly, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't be quite all of them. The underclothing and the
      stockings, and that sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Pack 'em up, John, and I'll put them in store and
      get Mrs. Larcombe to hand them out when necessary. Anything
      else I can do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's her furniture, or some of it. I want to keep it, if I
      can store it. I suppose I could--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll store it for you. There's the old tithe barn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you, sir? It's very kind of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, John. Get the carrier to cart it up, and
      we'll put it away. I see you aren't one of those 'To hell
      with all the old stuff' young men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She gave me my chance in life, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good lad. Some memories are damned well worth while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then J. J. did a thing which the village thought very
      strange and heartless, for few things that happened in
      Yatley could be concealed. On one serene September evening
      J. J. foraged out some straw from the lumber-shed, made a
      little pile of it near the Blenheim Apple, and having
      collected and carried out all Miss Pope's dresses, shawls,
      etc., he made a pyre and burned them in the garden. A
      little column of blue smoke rose straight into the still
      air. One or two inquisitive neighbours, poking their noses
      over the fence, saw J. J. with a garden fork feeding those
      old frocks and shawls, aprons and overalls on to the fire.
      He appeared to be absorbed in the job, and he continued to
      tend the fire until all was ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It thought it an act of cynical heartlessness. Burning all
      the poor old thing's clothes! He had her money, and that,
      perhaps was all he cared about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley did not understand that a man could care so
      profoundly that he preferred a kind of sacrificial
      holocaust to the casual elimination of a dead woman's
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Cock who assumed stertorous indignation when
      she heard of the incident. Young Pope was disposing of the
      shop and the business, and that he had a right to do, but
      burning the poor old woman's clothes in the garden she had
      loved so well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually she marched down and tackled J. J. in the shop.
      There were other people present. Mrs. Cock tilted her head
      back, and focused J. J. through her pince-nez as though
      examining some sort of insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true, Mr. Pope, that you have burnt your aunt's
      clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," said J. J., going on with the job in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must say it seems to many of us a most callous and
      reprehensible act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably it would seem so," said J. J., apparently
      unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you could bring yourself to do such a thing, after all
      the kindness--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then J. J. flared, and it was a cold white flare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it your Christian duty, madam, always to attribute evil
      motives to your neighbours?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Genius can be strangely forgetful in a way that may appear
      incomprehensible to mundane men, for, genius, in
      concentrating upon an idea or upon the exploration of a
      problem, can become so absorbed in it and so much part of
      it, that other responsibilities or activities may be mere
      extraneous and superfluous trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a fact that J. J., in rushing to share in Aunt Jane's
      last days, forgot St. Mark's Hospital and his duties as a
      clinical clerk. He neither wrote to notify his absence nor
      to explain it, and when he turned up on that September
      morning he was made aware of an amused and unfriendly
      expectancy on the faces of his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gains, Sir James Fraser's H. P. was curt with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Pope, where have you been? Holidaying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I had to go away suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any good reasons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If illness and death are reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gains was sardonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your aunt or uncle, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't take the trouble to notify us, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other things seemed more important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think you'll hear about it from the old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did hear about it. He was near the head of the
      procession of students that set out to follow Sir James
      Fraser round the wards. Gains was walking with his chief.
      Sir James appeared to have noticed neither the absence nor
      the presence of J. J. Pope, but when the little crowd had
      passed through the glazed doors of Ursula Ward, Sir James
      faced about with the air of a great gentleman performing
      some social duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been absent from the hospital for nearly three
      weeks. I understand that you had a reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A near relation was ill, sir, and I had to go, rather
      suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did it not occur to you, Mr. Pope, that you might have
      notified us of your absence and its reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was mute. He had put himself in the wrong, and he
      knew it, and yet this sin of omission seemed so very small
      after the loss that he had suffered. Sir James waited,
      benign, judicial, dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not agree, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, but I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I suggest, Mr. Pope, that good manners can still be
      cultivated, even in a crisis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a devastating reproof, and no one could administer
      such a rebuke better than Sir James. He spoke, as from a
      high place, with an air of gentleness and pity, the great
      man condescending to enlighten the uneducated lout. There
      was silence. Not a snigger. J. J. had been so thoroughly
      castigated that the complacency of the little crowd was
      that of a party whose stomach of prejudice had been filled
      to repletion. Nothing but digestion was needed. Sir James,
      having spoken, turned and walked with placid deliberation
      to the nearest bed. His fine surface appeared utterly
      unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so, J. J. He knew, without looking at the faces of his
      fellows, that they had enjoyed his discomfiture, and in
      feeling hot and angry and embarrassed he knew that he bore
      the stigmata of the man who was unpopular. These other
      young men had enjoyed seeing him being taken down. Did he
      care? Why should he care? The passion to please the crowd
      was not urgent in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, let these fellows gloat. Sir James' round was coming
      to an end, and J. J. had stood rubbing elbows with men who
      were chuckling over his snubbing. He was leaving the ward a
      little ahead of the crowd, for he wanted to escape. Sir
      James had paused to give some direction to his H. P. J. J.
      heard a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. turned. He saw Sir James walking towards him, and Sir
      James' face had somehow ceased from being a public face. J.
      J. waited. Was he to receive another lecture? But Sir
      James' hand slipped under the little mans arm, and drew him
      gently into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you have had trouble, Pope. Was it very
      serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An aunt, sir. She took me when I had no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what that must mean. How did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cerebral haemorrhage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much suffering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, unless one divines things that--that sort of
      palsy must bring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James glanced down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, what passes in the mind, at such a time? Like being
      shut suddenly out of life, a child in a cupboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could not have put it better, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to me at any time, Pope, if I can help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden kindness, the magnanimity of the great
      gentleman had an unexpected effect upon J. J. He had been
      moved by it, but not towards happiness as any assuagement
      of his sorrow. He felt like a sensitive and lonely child,
      who, when spoken to kindly by some stranger, bursts into
      tears. As he walked the London streets he knew that he was
      a friendless creature, and that something in himself seemed
      to shut him off from his fellow men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he slipped his key into the door of No. 7 Unicorn Place
      he knew that here too he was a stranger, tolerated in the
      cause of necessity. The one home he had known had gone, and
      with it the one person who had loved and understood him, as
      far as one person can understand another. Miss Ophelia
      Dally, popping her head out of a door, and looking like a
      moulting hen in a coop, said: "Oh, it's Mr. Pope." Yes,
      just Mr. Pope! Miss Ophelia was interested in the
      first-floor lodger, a baldish and stout widower who was
      something in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew, and J. J., climbing the stairs, suddenly
      hated this house, and yet, what other choice had he? He was
      a lodger, an obscure and homeless student in this casual
      city. Not till he had come back to Unicorn Place had he
      realised to the full how much Yatley had meant to him.
      Well, work was the thing. Work and forget. He sat down at
      his table in the window and with his elbows resting on it,
      and his hands over his ears, he stared at the familiar
      scene. His sense of loneliness became a pain. He was
      conscious of himself as a creature in whom no one was
      interested. No one would care whether he worked or idled;
      no one would care what he thought or did, or dreamed of
      doing. Anything that he accomplished would seem to the
      world no more than a child's sand-castle by the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of anguish of loneliness attacked him; and with it a
      bitter restlessness. He could not sit here and read. He
      would go round to Mortimer Mews, and play with his
      chemist's toys. He might see Kitty Jewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty Jewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      He realised that he wanted to see Kitty Jewell.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For, suddenly, she appeared to symbolise for him all that
      he lacked, all that he had never experienced and possessed.
      She was youth, woman. And she was more than that. Her eyes
      were kind, and her warm gaiety was like her lambent hair,
      mysterious and live and lovely. He pictured her in her
      little flowery hat, coquettish and comely. He thought of
      her sitting at her window, sewing, and making a little
      song. Nor, so far as J. J. was concerned, was this a mere
      sentimental picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and walked to Mortimer Mews, but when he saw
      those blue and green doors, the inquisitive windows, and
      the perky chimney-pots a strange and sudden shyness seized
      him. He hesitated. Almost, he turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab, drawing in, made him step aside and take to the
      wall. A friendly, Cockney voice hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evenin', sir, quite a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Joe Clements, drawing in to give the old 'oss a
      rest, and to take his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Mr. Clements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you mister me, sir. Plain Joe's good enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. found a sudden smile, and an inspiration. Why should
      not plain Joe be good enough for anyone? Why Mr. This, and
      That Esquire? In Mortimer Mews the doors were all alike, if
      the people and the horses differed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't, Joe."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabbie's quick eyes had noticed the black tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No trouble, sir, I 'ope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've lost my best friend, Joe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to 'ear that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there's nothing to be said about it, Joe, nothing at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nuffin, sir, when such things 'appen."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s shyness seemed to pass. He followed the cab up the
      mews, opened the door that belonged to both Kitty and
      himself, and unlocked the door of his lab. The room was
      just as he had left it, if a little dusty. He stood
      listening. And then, hearing no sounds above, he realised
      that Kitty Jewell would still be at the little shop in
      Roper's Row, and that all his terrors and his hesitations
      had been mere feathers in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat down on his stool, leaving the lab. door open. As
      a research student he might be a genius, but in his
      knowledge of women he was as a babe unborn. He was lonely
      and sorrowful; therefore some woman should turn aside from
      her own particular path to comfort him. Because one
      solitary woman had been infinitely kind to him, J. J. may
      have believed that the world was full of Jane Popes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, without this faith in the greater selflessness, most
      of us make shipwreck, and J. J., sitting there, and
      pretending to be busy, while waiting for the footsteps of
      Kitty Jewell, was offering himself as a hostage to fate,
      and fate might be a little slut or just a school-mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, he heard the tapping of her shoes upon the
      cobbles of the mews. The little flowery hat floated past
      his window, and just as she had passed it, she must have
      become conscious of being watched, for she gave a quick
      turn of the head, and saw J. J. sitting there. Her pause
      was instant yet momentary, like a butterfly settling for a
      second on a flower. That flick of the head had been
      followed by a smile. She opened the front door, and stood
      in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. appeared stuck to his chair. Did he know that he
      looked more impressive when seated? People used to say of
      him in later years that he should always remain in his
      chair like a man in a portrait. Kitty came to his doorway.
      It was the natural thing to do, and she did it, and did not
      go mincing and teetering past like a self-conscious little
      bit on a chocolate box. Her smile died away. She saw his
      black tie, and that secret and rather sombre young face,
      and her eyes grew solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you are back."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was obvious, but life's most inevitable things may be
      obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are still here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her moon face was soft in its solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you working?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've had trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. Perhaps you don't want to talk about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have said to him "You want to talk about
      yourself. Men always do," and he might have retorted "And
      women, too!" Her dark eyes looked round the bare little
      room with its queer objects and its dusty sunlight.
      Possibly she felt his loneliness, for a woman takes life
      more emotionally than does a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can come and talk to me, if you like. I've got a hat
      to trim."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were hungry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to. Here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nicer upstairs, if you wouldn't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, and though he did not know it he was looking
      at her like a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I? It's very good of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm lonely, sometimes. Aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very."
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way up the stairs, and producing a key she
      unlocked her door. She had two rooms, and a tiny kitchen,
      the front one a living-room and looking upon the mews. A
      minute bedroom opened from it and its window gave upon the
      gardens of Mortimer Place. Her sitting-room possessed one
      armchair, two faded rugs, a deal table, and old black
      chiffonier, a dresser, some crockery and a cupboard in
      which she kept her food. Yet, to J. J. its very simplicity
      was pleasant and consoling. It seemed so much her room,
      like a child's play-box, and full of the little intimate
      things she treasured, one or two pieces of china, a round
      Georgian gilded mirror, a sentimental picture of a girl
      picking flowers, the coloured product of some Christmas
      annual. He saw a work-basket on the table, and the skeleton
      of a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down there. I'll just take off my hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded towards the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that's yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now. I like to sit on a higher chair when I'm working.
      I won't be a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed into the bedroom, and J. J. took the armchair.
      Its springs were somewhat ancient, and its padding had
      gathered to itself into lumps and nodules, but it was her
      chair, and therefore even its faded tapestry had glamour.
      J. J. sat and waited. He picked up the hat-frame and
      examined it, thinking that it suggested a lamp-shade
      waiting to be trimmed. Was that the fashion? He made the
      astonishing discovery that he was quite unaware of the kind
      of hat the women's world was wearing, and here he was
      sitting in a girl's room. Yes, and in the room of a very
      pretty girl. He was conscious of a thrill, for if any man
      has no love of plumage, then he is not quite man. J. J.
      would have liked those fellows at the hospital to see him
      with Kitty. But would he? Might not one of them try to cut
      him out? And what was she doing in there? Brushing her
      hair? In those days none but the profession powdered and
      rouged itself. She did not need that sort of thing; she had
      one of those ivory skins, a face like milk. J. J. was a
      creature of strange, secret tremblings. She had asked him
      to come up and talk to her: she must like him, trust him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her door opened, and J. J. stood up. She had changed her
      black dress for a kind of loose, flowery smock. Her hair
      was sleek, her eyes like dark velvet. J. J. smiled at her,
      and she smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do look--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He floundered. He was raw at paying compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I? How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pretty dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just the old thing I work in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks homely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that quite the right word? He hastened to qualify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, it looks pretty and comfortable, and not just for
      show. I'd like to watch you make a hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's it for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Bragg who keeps the Red Lion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A large lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inference. It looks like being a large hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A picture hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ever wear picture hats?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like little hats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you don't need a shadow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. could not get at the pith of it; he boggled and was
      shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think it over and guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her work-basket to her, and with the hat on her
      knees, she began to select from her basket the materials
      that she needed. J. J. sat and watched her in silence, for,
      as an observer, he was alive, perhaps for the first time in
      his life, to the actual loveliness of youth's texture, its
      virginal freshness, itsbloom. He looked at her sleek, soft
      throat, the lambent hair, the sweep of the downcast lashes,
      the gentle mouth, the dimpled chin. At the hospital he was
      seeing the ugliness of life, its discords and disharmonies,
      the poor scrag end of the joint, and here was a creature as
      fresh and virginal as a rose just when it is opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to him, without looking up from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you lost your tongue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. Words don't always express things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all sorts of things, a garden, or a landscape, or a
      picture. You see, I am always seeing ugly things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his meaning, and she smiled over her deliberate
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you do, at the hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never been in a hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you never will be. Healthy flowers and trees don't
      need doctors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you very fond of your work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm keen on finding out about things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what you do down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause while she stretched black velvet on to
      the hat-frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said: "Aren't you going to tell me about your
      trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she really want him to tell her? But why play Balaam's
      Ass to your angel? He settled down in the chair, and she
      glanced at him consideringly. A man ought to smoke a pipe
      at such a time. But, perhaps he did not smoke. She saw his
      hands resting on his knees, fingers slightly spread. She
      thought they looked very delicate hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, when I'm working."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not working. And not in this room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do. One doesn't fumigate a flower."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her eyes glimmer under her lowered lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, aren't you going to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It isn't always easy, you know, when things matter,
      and you have lost something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just an old lady, my aunt, who gave me everything she had
      to give. No, not just money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It makes one feel, oh, well, all sorts of things. A
      month ago she was alive, and life seemed as usual. Now,
      she's dead. A whole side of life wiped out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She kept the village shop. I've had to sell
      everything. Funny how one hates to think of strangers being
      there. But there is a stranger thing than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somehow I don't feel she's dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she isn't. Don't you believe in Heaven and all
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do. There must be a meaning for things,
      mustn't there? It can't be all muddle."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at her with a sudden and almost secret smile.
      Now, who was the great man who had said the same thing in
      much more solemn language? Samuel Butler? Well, well, out
      of the mouths of babes and sucklings! But what a very
      lovely thing she was, sitting there trimming that hat and
      talking a kind of flower-language that had the wisdom of
      all time.

    <h1>
      <a name="a12" id="a12">12</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. walked back from St. Mark's by way of Roper's Row.
      This curious and picturesque alley, which was neither a
      passage nor a street, contained a number of little
      individual shops which appeared to have retreated into this
      backwater in search of peculiarity and peace. Here was a
      second-hand book-shop, there a window full of old prints
      and mezzotints and one or two modern water-colours that
      pleaded to be purchased. "Nanette's" was opposite a curio
      shop which specialised in jade and amber, Egyptian
      antiques, and old jewellery. "Nanette's" had a quality of
      its own. It advertised a naive restraint, in that it
      displayed two frocks and six hats, and two sets of
      lingerie, for Mary Rackstraw, its initiator, was an artist,
      and though necessity willed her to make picture-hats for
      blonde and blousy Red Lionesses, there were the ultimate
      few who had taste and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. came to a halt between these two shops. He looked
      first into the window of the curio shop, because an
      immoderate shyness was dominating him, and the approach to
      the sanctuary had become indirect. Kitty had been invisible
      for three days, and he was wondering why. It did not occur
      to him that it might be strategy of a very innocent sort,
      nor respect for the public conventions of Mortimer Mews. A
      certain incident still brought a blush to Kitty Jewell's
      simple soul. A certain person must not be allowed to think
      that she was that sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. saw something in the window of the curio shop which
      produced an association of ideas, an amber necklace,
      nodules of amber strung together like chestnuts on a
      string. The colour of it struck the same colour notes as
      Kitty Jewell's hair. That would look well on one of her
      black frocks, and match her hair. Could he dare to buy it
      and make a present of it? He did not dare. He faced about
      and took three steps to the opposite window. It was not
      possible to see into the shop, for a black velvet curtain
      hung there like the black-cloth of a stage. J. J. examined
      the hats. He supposed that they were her hats. He was
      picturing her pretty white fingers at work upon them, when
      he became conscious of a presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had come to the shop's doorway and was standing on
      the step, a short, dark, solid person in spectacles. She
      was observing J. J., and behind her spectacles were both
      appraisement and an amused twinkle. Surely, this must be
      Mr. J. J. Pope? Both his head and his legs were evidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., moved by a sudden impulse, raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Rackstraw, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Livingstone," said she, and then they laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s shyness suddenly fell away from him. Miss Mary
      Rackstraw belonged most strangely to the Sisterhood of Aunt
      Janes. Even the physical resemblance was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wondering if Miss Jewell--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, and Miss Rackstraw prompted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty is in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope she is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had a rush of work, though I may not look like it
      at the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About which?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a woman after J. J.'s own temper, quick in wits
      and tongue, while looking like a large white loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both if you like. I suppose you have inferred--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your identity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, Mr. Pope. Why not come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment. I have to go down into the country to-morrow.
      Do you think I could ask Kitty to come with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want her to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ask her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rackstraw was a naturalist at a period when English
      social hypocrisy was slipping down the ladder to the middle
      and lower rungs. J. J. followed Miss Rackstraw into the
      shop, but it was innocent of Kitty Jewell. There was an
      inner door painted white, fitted with windows of ground
      glass, and Miss Rackstraw pointed J. J. to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our workshop. Explore it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed behind the counter and spread her large
      posterior upon a stool rather like a hen sitting down on a
      clutch of eggs. J. J., hat in hand, approached the inner
      door, and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don t be silly," said a voice, "no need for Open Sesame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," said another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was standing behind a table snipping away with
      scissors at a length of cloth. J. J. closed the door. For a
      moment they stood and looked at each other like a couple of
      solemn and shy children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Rackstraw sent me in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Need he take refuge behind Miss Rackstraw? Kitty put down
      her scissors, and subsided on to a stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't seen you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we've been so busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Miss Rackstraw told me. I've been wondering--I'm going
      down into the country to-morrow for a day. I wondered
      whether you would come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up her scissors, and pressed the blades to her
      lips. Her eyes had a shadowed look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're so busy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Rackstraw said she could manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yatley. Business. And I want to put some flowers on Aunt
      Jane's grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped her lips with the scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might. I'll ask Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, slipped round the table, and disappeared into the
      shop, closing the door after her, and J. J. stood holding
      his hat, and wondering whether he had been too bold. He
      could hear the murmur of voices, Kitty's hesitant and
      questioning. Miss Rackstraw's very definite and sure. Half
      a minute passed, and then the white door opened, and J. J.
      saw Kitty's face. It looked most dreadfully serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I might come."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They walked to Yatley by the field paths from Dewhurst
      station, two young things still rather shy of each other,
      and taking the day with great seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      September was with them, a late and serene September. The
      heaviness and the heat of summer had passed. Kitty was
      wearing her pansy hat, though the pansy flowering time had
      passed. It was an aster, sunflower phase, with the trees
      waiting to put on their autumn colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it lovely," said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," said J. J., looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one point they had to take to the road for three hundred
      yards, and here an incident occurred, the significance of
      which hardly concerned J. J. as a person. One of the new
      road-machines overtook them with triumphant detonations,
      and leaving behind it odours and a film of dust. A young
      man was driving it, and beside him sat another young man.
      There was a portmanteau in the tonneau.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Geoff, what the hell would have happened if you had
      missed that train?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone would have had to deputise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Second-rate best man fobbing me off with the ring! I'm
      feeling a bit nervous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      The car, rounding a curve, came suddenly upon Kitty and J.
      J. walking in the middle of the road. Lawrie Strange
      squeezed the bulb of the hooter, and saw the little man
      catch the girl's arm and draw her towards the grass verge.
      They stood there to let the car pass. Both young men stared
      at them, but Lawrence Strange's passing stare was given in
      its last phase to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, it's young Pope!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Geoffrey was looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, so it is! Was up with him at Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with a tart! Pretty bit of fluff."
    </p>
    <p>
      The car disappeared round the curve of a hedge, and Kitty
      and J. J. were left in a little cloud of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nasty things they are. The young men seemed to know
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense, yes. I was up at Cambridge with one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get out of the dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at her a little anxiously. Had she divined the
      gay contempt with which those two had regarded him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a stile just round the corner. And then, the
      woods. No dust there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my hat dusty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the flowery thing in her hands when they reached
      the stile. Great beech trees began their shade here. J. J.
      dared to help her up on to the stile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down. And give me the hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      She settled herself on the bar, and J. J., taking the hat
      from her, wondered whether he could blow on it. No, that
      might seem a rather vulgar way of dealing with so sacred a
      halo. He took out a clean handkerchief, and solemnly and
      carefully flicked the dust from the faces of the flowers
      and the black velvet. Her eyes were soft as the velvet as
      she watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There. That's better."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her the hat like a courtier offering a coronet to
      a great lady. She put it on, a little self-consciously, and
      patted her hair with slim fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was more flattering than any mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows of the beeches enveloped them. The path curved
      up the hillside with the great trees arching over it, and
      the green canopy hid the sky. Kitty said that she had never
      seen such trees. Her face looked pale and cool and
      mysterious, and the velvet of her eyes grew darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they very old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two hundred years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child in Kitty was full of solemn wonder, and J. J. was
      remembering that the beech had been Miss Pope's favourite
      tree. The day was supremely still, but when they reached
      the top of the hill a sudden wayward breeze came from
      nowhere and all the million voices of the wood broke into a
      murmuring. Kitty stood still, her hand suddenly resting on
      J. J.'s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, listen! The trees are talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch of her fingers and the sudden sibilant trembling
      became memories in him, linked together for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are talking about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, trees always notice strangers, and talk about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what they are saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fateful words came to J. J.'s lips, words that he was
      never to regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are saying that you are the most lovely thing in all
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness was as sudden as the tremolo of the trees.
      Her face had the strange sheen of a woman who is loved, and
      happy. Her hand slipped down his arm and met his fingers.
      They stood side by side looking up into the green deeps of
      the beeches.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When they came down the steep and shady path to the
      village, and reached the old flint wall of the churchyard,
      J. J.'s quick eyes detected something unusual about the
      porch of Yatley church. An awning had been added to it, an
      awning that was quite superfluous on so gentle a day, and
      from the porch ten yards of red stair-carpet led to and
      down the gravel path. A wedding! And whose? No ordinary
      wedding, certainly. Yatley did not indulge in such
      decorations save on very high and special occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s first business was with the new lessee of the shop.
      Mr. Roper of Dewhurst had promised to expedite all legal
      matters, but since it appears to take the legal profession
      six months to complete a transaction which an efficient
      business firm would carry through in a fortnight, J. J.'s
      affairs were still very much in the air. His aunt had left
      him an immediate legacy of a hundred pounds, and that Mr.
      Roper had paid, so J. J. was not short of cash. He had
      checked the stock before leaving, but he wished to be sure
      that the new man was satisfied. Then, there was the matter
      of flowers for Aunt Jane's grave. J. J.'s desire was that
      they should come from her own garden, and he was meaning to
      beg or buy a few. As for lunch, he and Kitty could be
      served at The Chequers at the top of Yatley Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. suggested to Kitty that she should go and sit on a
      seat under a chestnut tree by The Chequers while he got
      through his business. J. J. left her there, and walked
      across to that familiar house with its high gables and old
      brick chimneys. A painter was at work repainting the shop
      front, and he and J. J. exchanged the usual village
      greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "New coat of paint. Someone being married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Strange and Miss Marwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., struck by the coincidence and by a certain pity for
      the lady, walked into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new man was behind the counter, and a strange young
      woman had taken Florrie's place. Mr. Eames was bearded,
      bald, fat, and utterly respectable, a Radical in politics,
      and an aggressive chapel man. J. J. was not attracted to
      Mr. Eames, and therefore was the more conscientious in
      assuring himself that the new lessee was satisfied. Mr.
      Eames smiled upon him rather like a wolf, yellow fangs
      gleaming in a pelt of grizzled brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Mr. Pope. Unexpected pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked round the shop. It was somehow different. Mr.
      Eames was a new broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come down to see the grave. I thought I'd like to
      know that you are satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eames became pawky and cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, on the whole, yes, Mr. Pope. One or two small items
      didn't tally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can meet you over that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not necessary, mere trifles. Come inside. Have a glass of
      my gooseberry, wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eames was a purist, but he did allow himself home-made
      wine, and called it fruit-juice. J. J. was taken into the
      familiar room where a strange, gaunt woman sat among
      strange furniture. J. J. was introduced to Mrs. Eames, who
      looked at him as though he was the son of Original Sin.
      Mrs. Eames had been listening to gossip. J. J. accepted the
      wine and asked his favour. Might he have a few flowers from
      the garden for Miss Jane Pope's grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said Mr. Eames, sipping gooseberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eames was more tart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd promised most of them for the chapel festival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only want a few. You see, she grew them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll cut you a few," said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut them she did, and with restraint and economy, and J. J.
      departed with three red dahlias, three perennial
      sunflowers, and four sprigs of purple Michaelmas daisy. J.
      J. looked at them whimsically as he crossed the Green to
      rejoin Kitty, but even if the flowers were few in number
      they were Jane Pope's flowers. Evidently, Mrs. Eames was of
      the order of Wise Virgins, and would continue among the
      elect, the matronic mainstays of the chapel. J. J.
      displayed the flowers to Kitty, and explained them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I could get. The lady is careful and will arrive in
      Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled under the shade of the chestnuts to The
      Chequers Inn. It was a black-and-white house, its timber
      framing the colour of tar, its undulating roof a rusty red.
      White palings enclosed a garden, and apple trees full of
      fruit. Old Killick, who had been the lessee of The Chequers
      for nearly thirty years, was a big, buxom South Saxon, a
      jocund and a generous soul. He was standing in the oak
      porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it isn't Mr. Pope! Glad to see you, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. introduced Miss Jewell, and Old Killick, like the
      squire, had an eye for a pretty girl. Well, well, well, J.
      J. had picked up a jewel! Could Mr. Killick give them
      lunch? Could he not! And in the garden, if they so pleased.
      Mr. Killick eyed J. J.'s posy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit thin, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted them for her grave, and from her garden. It was
      all Mrs. Eames could spare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looks it! You wait, John. I'll fit you out with a real
      posy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty went upstairs for a wash and a tidy, and J. J. and
      Mr. Killick drank half a pint of bitters together in the
      private bar. Mr. Killick had some cold salmon in the house,
      and would J. J. like salmon? Very much so, on such an
      occasion. And what about this marriage business? Mr.
      Killick removed froth from a blond moustache with the back
      of a hand, and looked solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry for the lady. Young Strange has never been any good,
      and never will be. I suppose the idea is, John, to settle
      him down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marriage does, at times, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my experience it makes a wild lad worse. Well, John,
      here's luck. I can tell you the shop isn't the same since
      Miss Jane left us."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. emptied his mug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was a good woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reg'lar rag and bone lady we've got now. Gives you a liver
      to look at her. Well, I'd better go and see about that
      salmon."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They laid both bunches of flowers upon Jane Pope's grave,
      which was a mere mound of turf that had been browned and
      baked by the sun. J. J. placed the bunch from the shop
      garden, and Kitty the much more sumptuous posy which Mr.
      Killick had provided. Hardly had the ritual been completed
      than the Yatley church bells began to ring. Humanity was
      gathering about the lych gate and its sentinel yews.
      Children had climbed the flint wall and were perched there
      like twittering sparrows. Mr. Lawrence Strange was marrying
      Miss Sybil Marwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, like all women, was moved emotionally by a wedding,
      and this September day had colour and romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we go and watch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like. I don't think there will be much happiness in
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How terrible. I'm sorry. Then, why--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave a little shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember the young gentleman who passed us in the car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one who was driving is the bridegroom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one who stared so hard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he had reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty was solemn over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't like the man I was to marry to stare like that
      at someone else on the day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't, if I know him. He will look only at one person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley church lay in a great green bowl, with the wooded
      hills surrounding it. Up yonder was Yatley Heath, and as J.
      J. lay in a shady corner under a lime tree, he remembered
      the day when he had tried to recapture his childhood, and
      Sybil Marwood had surprised him, and he had fled into the
      fern. He glanced at Kitty with skirts decorously spread
      beside him, her face the face of a woman sharing in some
      human ceremony. What a pretty, gentle thing was this, not
      like that rather fierce and dark young woman who, he had to
      confess, still roused in him strange yearnings. But what
      was he to Sybil Marwood, or she to him? Carriages were
      coming and going, and people passing into the church. Organ
      music came from it. Kitty, becoming more and more involved
      in the emotional occasion, rose up and said that she was
      joining the spectators who were lining the church path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave her a lover's smile, and remained in the shade.
      Let Kitty enjoy the show. He found it sufficiently good to
      sit and watch her. Bells and organ seemed to be swelling
      out in chorus. There was a murmuring from the crowd. Mr.
      Strange had arrived with his best man, and was passing
      through the lych gate to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later another carriage brought the bride, and
      General Marwood who was giving her away. J. J. saw her as a
      creature in white, a dim, veiled profile moving beyond the
      fence of figures. She passed into the church, and the
      village crowd, or some of it, flowed in after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty returned to her lover. She stood a moment, as in
      thought, before sitting down on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He stared at me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he, damn him!" said J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't like my man to stare at another woman, just
      before he married me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope found himself a capitalist to the tune of three
      thousand, three hundred pounds. The three thousand pounds
      he invested in English and Colonial Government stocks; the
      three hundred he kept as fluid capital. He needed more
      equipment for his lab., and some of it he contrived to make
      himself, for he had a watchmaker's hands. His invested
      capital produced for him about a hundred pounds a year,
      sufficient for a student's needs, but hardly adequate for
      adventures. As to the future it was like a window with the
      curtains drawn, and the curtains were human prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe J. J. Pope was too combative and had too sharp a
      tongue. He would not compromise. There was nothing of the
      professional Agag in him. Your careerist must be a
      debonair, nimble fellow, quick in his adaptions, ready with
      a conciliatory smile. Pope was too definite a person, and
      too definitely capable and shrewd, a dangerous man to argue
      with. Too often he was right, and other men loathe the
      fellow who is too often right.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should have been an inevitableness about his career.
      He would qualify at the very earliest date, fill various
      house appointments and registrarships, and become
      eventually a member of the honorary staff. He would lecture
      the young, perhaps marry a woman with money, and rent a
      house or a portion of a house in Harley, Welbeck or Wimpole
      Street, but long before he had passed through his first
      year at St. Mark's, J. J. Pope, realised that his future
      would not work out according to plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were incidents, illuminating incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered for the Harvey-Wright Prize and Medal. Possibly
      he had regarded it as too inevitably his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prize went elsewhere, to a man named Gibbs, and J. J.
      wondered. In the matter of knowledge and capacity Gibbs was
      soft iron to his steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the curious behaviour of Sir James Fraser. It was
      as though Sir James, as a gentleman, disapproved of
      something that had been done. He made a point of singling
      out Pope for courtesies and favours. He invited J. J. to
      serve as his house-physician, when qualified. Then Sir
      James, after enjoying a Guildhall banquet on a bitter
      winter night, developed pneumonia and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that conversation that J. J. overheard in a
      particular place. J. J. was occupying a seat in a
      water-closet; two young men were talking loudly and washing
      their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought that fellow Pope would walk off with the
      Harvey-Wright Medal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on your life. They aren't going to let in a little
      outsider like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean they--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet they did. Manners matter. If Pope thinks he'll ever
      get on the staff here, he'll have the surprise of his
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my dear chap, they can't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, can't they! My guvnor's very thick with old Padman,
      and I happen to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J, having pulled a handle, and waited until the two
      young men had left, emerged from that secret niche with an
      enlightenment that was sardonic and actual. Other illusions
      had gone down the drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it indeed true that he was to be barred from a
      conventional career by the peculiar unpopularity which
      attaches itself to certain persons? His head was too big,
      his legs too short, his tongue too quick, his ability too
      obvious. In the new science of bio-chemistry he was already
      a generation ahead of most of the eminent gentlemen who
      served on the hospital staff. He could pose them, and no
      doubt some of them knew it. J. J. Pope was one of those
      dangerous young men who lead revolutions and upset
      theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the culminating incident that converted J. J. into the
      complete individual came as a piece of paternal
      impertinence on the part of the Dean. How it had got about
      that J. J. Pope was living with a woman was a question for
      the gods. Nor was it true. What happened was that J. J.
      received a summons to attend to the Dean's private room,
      and in all innocence he obeyed that summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean was a purist. He had absorbed the tradition of
      interference, and he belonged to the moral school which
      with serene impertinence despatched missionaries to China.
      He gave ethical addresses to the young, and enjoyed it.
      Probably he regarded himself as one of the guardians of
      professional purity. He held the torch aloft, and if it
      happened to burn with a very pale flame, it was blown about
      by no gusts of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat down. The Dean wore spectacles, which made his
      myopic eyes appear large and ominous. He put his fingers
      together, and sat back in his chair. He was not a married
      man, and his pallor and his thin lips suggested many
      repressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a rather delicate matter, Mr. Pope. If I ask you a
      particular question it is from a sense of duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was to discover that when certain people wished to be
      rude they dressed up the rudeness in that drab garment, a
      sense of duty. He was silent, waiting. He had no idea what
      this delicate matter could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true, Mr. Pope, that you are living with a woman who
      is not your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s head gave a jerk. He appeared to draw a deep breath
      and hold it. A sudden, cold anger possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by what right, sir, do you ask such a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes behind the spectacles seemed to show more and more
      eyeball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hold a certain position, Mr. Pope, which, I believe,
      endows me with a duty to those who are to carry our
      tradition out into the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such ferocity and emphasis in the denial that the
      Dean blinked as though acid had been thrown at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Mr. Pope, no temper. I am very relieved to hear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no temper, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Pope--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I expected to put such an insult in a paper bag and
      take it home with me for lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean looked shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I suggest, Mr. Pope--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your only question, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have answered it. Good morning." And J. J. got up
      and walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It just had not occurred to J. J. that because he and Kitty
      had agreed to be lovers and to go on being lovers, they
      were living in sin. Had other men been kinder to him this
      might have been the happiest period of J. J.'s life. In
      Kitty Jewell he had chanced upon a delightful creature, one
      of those child women with a lovely appetite for life that
      can turn a drab day into joy. Kitty, somehow, was a
      mistress of life's artistry, just as she was an artist over
      hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go on pretending."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretending what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That we're shy still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not supposed to know, and you haven't told me yet.
      Like it was the day we went to Yatley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, wise woman! Familiarity may not breed contempt, nor
      persuade a man to take his pleasures for granted, but J. J.
      found in Kitty something of that spirit which had made him
      dance on Yatley Heath. Why not sip the cup instead of
      draining it, smell the growing rose instead of plucking it?
      So many men were butcherly in their love, in a sweating
      haste to uncover every mystery. So, it had been agreed
      between them that for the time being their lives should not
      be changed at all. J. J. came to his lab., Kitty went to
      her shop. The delight of it all remained fresh and dewy.
      They could go out together on Sundays, to Hampton or Kew,
      and lie on the grass, and look at each other and retain the
      bloom and the wonder of the April season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that Kitty was afraid. In her there would be no
      meanness, no thrifty parcelling out of favours, no holding
      back. She had said: "We can't be married, can we, till
      you're a doctor? Let's go on pretending you haven't asked
      me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this interview with the Dean had, somehow, let the
      Serpent into Eden. Had the Dean known that J. J. proposed
      to mate with Kitty Jewell, he, no doubt, would have felt it
      his duty to point out to Mr. Pope that in marrying a
      milliner he would be jeopardising his professional career.
      J. J. chuckled maliciously over the thought, and
      contemplating his own birth and upbringing, wondered
      whether it was just snobbery that should make you so
      careful about the profession's frock coat and top-hat. The
      Dean could go to the devil, but such a gesture did not
      satisfy J. J. in facing up to the situation. Other men
      seemed determined that he should turn rebel. Moreover,
      Kitty had given him that which no other human creature had
      been able to give; not even Aunt Jane. He was her man; she
      thought him wonderful, and let him see it, and to J. J. as
      Ishmael, this applause was more than flattery. It warmed
      him, strengthened him, filled the secret places of his
      heart. He was ready to swear that Harley Street could well
      be lost for the soft embraces and the tender raptures of a
      woman's soul and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis so obsessed him that he was not normal man for
      the moment. Living with a woman! The inference, of course,
      being that the woman was a prostitute. J. J. made straight
      for Roper's Row, only to find that Kitty had gone up to
      Highbury to fit a particular and precious patroness who had
      sprained an ankle and could not walk. J. J. saw Mary
      Rackstraw, and Mary, when she had looked at J. J.'s face,
      was wise as to some emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was a little worried about these two. So intimate an
      affair, when prolonged, had its perils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop was empty, and J. J. sat down on a stool. He
      suddenly was conscious of feeling tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I may as well tell you, Mary. I want Kitty to marry
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary sat on the counter, almost judicially so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you asked her, before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we had an understanding. But I want her to marry me
      now. I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some sudden reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to tell you the reason. It's too beastly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gossip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could call it that. You know, Mary, I have a feeling
      that I am doing the best thing for myself I shall ever do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try to make it that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary got suddenly off the counter and kissed him on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you will. Kitty will be back in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to the lab. Don't tell her anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I won't. I'll just tell her you want to see
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. went on to Mortimer Mews. It was late winter and a
      northeast wind was blowing, and when J. J. turned into that
      familiar cul-de-sac he saw it, perhaps for the first time
      in his life, as a blind end. Here were the blue and green
      doors out of which humans and horses and cabs popped like
      mechanisms in a puppet show. Nothing seemed to change.
      People neither climbed up nor down, but went about their
      simple ways on the same level. Therefore, why blind end,
      finality for him and for Kitty? J. J. stood for a moment
      outside the door that was common to him and Miss Kitty
      Jewell. He frowned at it. It might have been Balaam's Ass,
      posing him with some unanswerable question. Blind alleys?
      Was it the voice of some old man that suddenly was
      assailing him, a suborning voice, tepidly wise. Would he be
      committing social suicide? Social suicide! What bosh! Had
      he any social ambitions? None at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of sudden laughter breaking out within
      him, tender, happy laughter. He put his hand to the door,
      and pushed it open. This was the mood for adventure.
      Almost, he was the small boy dancing naked on Yatley Heath,
      and playing upon his mock pipe. Life, laughter and love!
      The light was fading, and his little den looked strange and
      dim. It was cold in here, bitterly cold. There was no
      fireplace in the room. J. J. closed the door, and keeping
      his overcoat on, sat down at his table, but not to work. He
      wanted to look at life and confront it in the shape of
      Mortimer Mews, this obscure alley in which he had found
      happiness and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Mr. Joe Clements drive in, unharness his horse and
      lead him into the stable. The cab was pushed into the
      coach-house and the blue doors closed. Joe's nose also had
      a tinge of blue. He flapped his arms to warm himself. On
      Yatley Heath this north-easter would be snoring through the
      bare beech trees, and sending last year's leaves scudding.
      J. J.'s feet and hands felt cold, but not his heart. Would
      it not be better to go outside and keep moving instead' of
      sitting in this unheated room?
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s feet were on the cobbles when he saw Kitty turn
      into the entrance of the mews. She had the collar of a
      little flimsy coat turned up about her throat. Love is said
      to be blind, which it is not, and J. J. had the eyes both
      of the physician and the lover. He had come to play the
      passionate and the urgent lover, but when he saw Kitty's
      face the man in him had eyes. Kitty was cold, terribly
      cold. Her face had lost the indefinable bloom of youth; it
      had a pinched pallor. Her eyes were anxious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to smile at J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just been up to Highbury. Came back on the top of a
      bus. No room inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was conscious of fear and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the door open. His arm went round her waist and drew
      her in. He felt her shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never felt so cold. I'm so sorry to be like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      So sorry! J. J. was shaken almost as she was, by a spasm of
      tenderness. He seemed to know that Kitty was going to be
      ill. He felt one of her hands. His fingers tried her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come upstairs, my dear, and get warm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never felt so cold, all shivery down my back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're going to bed. Leave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to help her up the stairs, and perhaps her sudden
      feeling of weakness had an emotional surrender as its
      inspiration. J. J. might be a small man, but he was wiry.
      He held her close to him, his left arm round her waist. Her
      head came to rest upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack, my knees feel so funny. I'm afraid I'm going to
      be ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a winter of black influenza, a pest that leaped
      upon its victim with a swiftness that was devastating. J.
      J. opened her door, and the first thing he saw was the
      fireless grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't a fire, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I only light it in the evening when I come home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see to that. Can you get yourself to bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick as you can, my sweet. I'll light the fire, and warm
      up some milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her cheek suddenly against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are being so kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very difficult to be kind to you, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"</i>My head's beginning to ache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The quicker you are in bed, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared into the inner room, and J. J. found some
      matches, and knelt down in front of the grate. The fire had
      been laid, and J. J. soon had it alight. He was thinking.
      What was the matter with Kitty? Flu, probably. And who was
      going to look after her? Mary Rackstraw could not leave the
      shop, though she might be able to come round in the
      evening. But why should not he look after Kitty? There was
      an old sofa in the sitting-room and he could sleep there.
      People might gossip. Damn gossip! As soon as he had seen
      Kitty tucked up in bed he would go across and talk to the
      Clements. Joe's wife was a brisk and sensible little body,
      and Mortimer Mews was not a place that refused you help.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was getting up and going in search of Kitty's milkcan
      and a saucepan in her kitchenette, when he heard her voice.
      It was a small voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to her door and opened it an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, I--I feel so ill. I'm afraid I'm going to be sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lying half undressed upon the bed, a pathetic
      little person, her knees drawn up, her body caught in some
      spasm. She turned her head and glanced despairingly in a
      certain direction, and J. J. was quick to divine her need.
      He pushed in, lifted a jug, grabbed the basin and carried
      it to her. She tried to sit up, and instantly he was on the
      bed behind her, propping her and holding her, while she
      clutched the basin to her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick she was, with little groanings and exclamations
      between the spasms. "Oh, dear, oh, dear! I'm so sorry to be
      like this." Her distress was his distress. Maybe he
      discovered, if he needed to discover it, the difference
      between love and sex, and that in loving a particular
      creature you loved them at all times and on all occasions,
      and that nothing revolted you. Even the ugly things that
      may afflict the body are instigators of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just let go, Kit. Don't worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel so disgusting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing about you would ever disgust me. I want to get you
      to bed. You're so cold, my sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was all puckered, but her eyes said how she loved
      him for loving her like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I might try now. Don't take it right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me take your stockings off. Mustn't stoop. That's it.
      Where's your night-dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under the pillow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment. I'll warm it. Do you think you can manage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get Mrs. Clements to come in presently. She's a good
      sort. I'll do the doctoring."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. slipped a hand under the pillow, drew out the
      night-dress and went and warmed it at the fire. Then he
      carried it in to her, removed the basin to empty it, and
      left her to get into bed. He put the saucepan of milk on
      the hob. He had a clinical thermometer downstairs, and a
      stethoscope in his overcoat pocket. He went to fetch the
      thermometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in bed when he returned, her clothes piled on a
      chair. She was shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, let's see about this. Under your tongue, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the thermometer in her mouth, he tidied up her
      clothes, hanging her coat and dress in the cupboard, and
      folding up her underwear. She watched him. She was full of
      wonder that a man could be so wise and gentle. Her head
      ached, but she was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, let's look."
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried the thermometer to the window and read it off.
      She had a temperature of 102.4.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it very bad, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Any pain in the chest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I just ache and feel shivery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flu, my sweet, that's what you have got, but I am just
      going to listen to your chest. Seems to me you'll be
      marrying a doctor as well as a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were big and vague.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we going to be married, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, quite soon. Now, don't you worry your blessed head
      about anything. When you've had some warm milk, I'll go
      across and see Mrs. Clements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll tell Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, I do love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her to drink the warm milk, after he had added to
      it ten grains of one of the new antipyretic drugs, and went
      across and knocked at the Clements' door. Joe opened it, a
      Joe in shirt sleeves, and smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'o, it's you, Mr. Pope. Come inside art of the wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Joe. Miss Jewell's ill. Influenza, I'm afraid, and
      she's all alone. Came back from work with a temperature of
      one hundred and two degrees. And we were to be married in a
      fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe knew nothing about temperatures, but he was not a
      passive person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ard luck. I'll ask the missis to go across."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you, Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus. We've both 'ave 'ad the bloody thing, so we must 'ave
      'ad our packet. So, you're goin' ter be spliced?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm a lucky man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not 'arf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going along to the shop to tell Miss Jewell's
      partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right'o, Mr. Pope. I'll get the missis ter run across
      right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. made for Roper's Row. It was growing dark now, and in
      the windy March twilight the lighted windows and street
      lamps seemed strange with phantasy, yet it was not the
      objective world that changed, but the sensitive, subjective
      spirit in man. As your mood was, so were bricks and mortar,
      mere bricks and mortar, or little goblin houses in which
      all manner of strange things happened. J. J. was both
      troubled and happy, and loving to love he had discovered
      within himself. It was good to love like this. Had the
      pious Dean ever known such exaltation?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a late customer in the shop, choosing blouses,
      and J. J. sat down patiently on a stool. The customer
      glanced at him irritably. What did a man want in a place
      like this, where feminine ritual alone was exercised? Mary
      Rackstraw, wise as to the lady's impatience, winked at J.
      J. and pointed to the workshop door. J. J. disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the lady: "Who is the funny little man? A cutter, I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was holding a blouse up over her full bosom to show
      off its colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. A friend of the firm's. Some day, they tell me, he
      will be the most famous doctor in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady gave her a cow's stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doctor! I don't think I should fancy a queer little
      person like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I dare say you wouldn't. It depends rather upon what
      you want, doesn't it? Isn't this a sweet colour? Just your
      colour, if I may say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had satisfied the lady, sold the blouse, wrapped
      it up and received her money, Mary smiled her patroness out
      of the shop. Mary found it much more difficult than did
      Kitty to be polite to people she did not like. She called
      it "Cultivating the Two C's, Custom and Character." Kitty
      was a very sweet-tempered person. In fact, Mary had never
      seen her out of temper save on one or two particular
      occasions when some mean or cruel incident had roused her.
      Mary stood a moment by the workshop door. Oh, bother men!
      The partnership had been so successful, and here was little
      J. J. Pope proposing to end it. Mary was not attractive to
      the male. Her large white enigmatic face was too plainly
      self-assured. But where was Kitty? Had anything happened to
      Kitty? Mary opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All serene. What's the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty's ill. Flu, I think. I've put her to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've put her to bed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not? She wanted putting to bed. I have arranged
      for a neighbour to go in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was conscious of a surge of hostility. She and Kitty
      had been close friends for five years, and here was this
      little fellow assuming possession, and behaving like the
      legal husband. But Mary could criticise herself and
      denounce the natural ego. She said: "Don't be a pig. You
      can't help these things when they happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll shut up and come across, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. There won't be much more doing now. I expect--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at her as though divining some secret smart in
      Mary Rackstraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women can do things men can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You admit that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course. Besides, you're so much her friend, and
      mine, if you'll let me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's heavy and almost sullen face softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a bit of an exception, J. J. Supposing you pull
      down the blind while I get my coat."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a14" id="a14">14</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. might be ready to question all the old traditions,
      for he was of the new age, ever ready to challenge
      convention and authority, but woman is a far more
      traditional creature than man, and Nature is on the side of
      the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was sitting up in bed, and looking very pretty, and
      J. J. sat and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we really are going to be married soon--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. nodded at her. If Kitty chose to exert a rather
      charming authority he was in a mood to consent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage, I mean, about money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well manage somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't you come and live here. There's your lab. We
      should only have to buy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spread her arms as though measuring the bed and
      indicating its inadequacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I could keep on with the shop, couldn't I, for a
      while? It would help."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. regarded her with the eyes of the complete lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do, darling. And when you are a doctor we can
      think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again J. J. nodded, but he was looking, not at Kitty, but
      out of the window. How much did this child-woman
      understand? How much could he tell her? That life would not
      be easy, that he might not develop into the conventional
      physician. Did she want the conventional things? Would
      struggle and poverty and waiting upon fate sour her happy
      face? That would be rather horrible, to see her grow
      bothered and puzzled, and perhaps petulant and pinched. Was
      he expecting too much of her? Ought he not to tell her the
      truth as he envisaged it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, I'm rather a curious creature, Kit. Lots of
      peculiar ways and things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, my sweet. I wonder if I ought to tell you about
      them? I think I ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with the serenity of happy faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I'm not. There's an awkward beast in me. I don't
      take things for granted. I like to find out, ask questions.
      Do you remember that when you were a kid, how the youngster
      who asked too many questions was a nuisance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the things other people take for granted: God, and
      being respectable, and making money, and doing just what
      other people do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and opened her arms to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here. What are you trying to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not surrender to those arms until he thought
      she understood, and until he knew that she knew. For J. J.,
      brilliant person that he might be, was still in that
      innocent stage when he believed that you could know and be
      known, and that you could persuade people to see the truth
      as you saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am trying to tell you, my sweet, that other men don't
      like me, that life may not be easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, as I said, if you are always asking awkward
      questions, if you challenge humbug, you are apt to be a bit
      of a nuisance. What I want you to realise, Kit, is that I'm
      something of a fanatic, about my work. I may get tied up in
      it, absorbed in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were folded now. She looked at him steadfastly,
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite a fool, John, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I suggested--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are trying to tell me that I may be jealous of your
      work. Well, I shan't be, no--never. I don't think I love
      you in that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm to be selfish, and you unselfish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't quite like that, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear, darling silly, I want to help. I'm going to be
      very proud when you do things."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days or so before Kitty Jewell and J. J. were to be
      married at St. Michael's, Bloomsbury, a very beautiful
      young man rang the bell of No. 7, Unicorn Place. That was
      the description Miss Phoebe Dally applied to him when she
      found him on the doorstep. And the young man had beautiful
      manners; he raised his hat to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following rather odd and disjointed conversation
      followed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Pope still living here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but he is going to be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's hardly ever in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what time do you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In about a fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I mean the marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful young man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather at cross-purposes, aren't we? What I want to know
      is when Mr. Pope is likely to be in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe Dally responded with a thin, long-toothed
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, about half-past nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such distractions, you see. Can I mention a name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, say Peter Pratten called. I'll come round again about
      half-past nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat again to Phoebe, and left her gasping on
      the doorstep. Seemingly Miss Phoebe did not approve of this
      marriage. How could she, having seen the lady. So like a
      barmaid, and with that sort of hair. Miss Phoebe Dally was
      a regular consumer of Pratten Pills, but she did not
      connect such medicinal matters with the beautiful young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. returned to Unicorn Place about eight o'clock. Having
      failed to persuade the landlord to redecorate Kitty's
      maisonette, they had set about doing it themselves, with J.
      J. in the part of painter and paper-hanger. His skill as a
      paper-hanger was a source of astonishment to Kitty who,
      during these operations, was sleeping at Mary Rackstraw's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever done it before, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, once, my bedroom at Yatley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the song Kitty was to sing through all the coming
      years, a song of which few male ears ever tire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe Dally popped like a cuckoo out of a
      cuckoo-clock at J. J. as he was closing the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman called to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said J.J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's coming again about nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Mr. Pratten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young or old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Phoebe simpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite young." And she might have added: "And so good
      looking. I wonder how you--came to know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. thanked her and climbed the stairs. He climbed them
      slowly, for he was tired, and suddenly assailed by one of
      those vagrant and unwashed moods that afflict even the most
      sensitive of men. Perhaps J. J. was realising that behind
      all our highfalutin lurk hunger, sex and fear, and that no
      surplice can conceal from the searcher after truth the fact
      that these basic urges are the fulminating forces below the
      frail crust of culture. Gas-jets burned dimly on the
      stairs. J. J.'s room was in darkness, and without a fire.
      He had matches on him, and as he groped his way to the
      chandelier suspended over the table in the centre of the
      room he was conscious of one of those mean twinges of fear
      that may cause a man to exclaim: "Get thee behind me,
      Satan." Yes, a twinge of unregenerate jealousy. Did he want
      Peter to meet Kitty Jewell, Peter who was all that he was
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. lit the gas, and threw the match into the empty
      grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dastard," he said to himself; "just vulgar jealousy,
      the curse of the common people."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and worked for an hour, and the work calmed
      him. It was an eternal solace, and he could say to himself:
      "Get into your brain and shut the door when vulgar emotion
      throws hysterics on the doormat." He did not even listen
      for the bell, nor perhaps would he have heard it, but when
      voices sounded on the stairs, he went out almost gaily to
      greet his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Peter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that handsome, wholesome face the devil of
      doubt departed from him. Damn it, he was proud of Peter,
      proud of knowing him, proud to be his friend! They looked
      into each other's eyes and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in. How are motor-cars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still misfiring somewhat. Well, I've heard the news."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. led him in by the arm, and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, old man. Yes, I'm going to be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Congratulations. Wanting a best man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as a matter of fact I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil didn't you write to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked both shy and sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not going to be a fashionable show. Kitty is partner
      in a hat-shop. We are going to live in a Mews."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter lay back in his chair and looked at his friend. Also,
      he felt for his pouch and pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call me a snob and have done with it, my lad. The pater
      began as bottle-boy in a chemist's shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. turned to the mantelpiece for his tobacco tin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reality, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so. Listen a moment, my lad. I've had nearly
      a year in the works, using my hands with the men who do the
      job. Great chaps, many of them. One learns to respect the
      man who does the job. He may be an awkward beast sometimes,
      but he does the job. Well, are you taking me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good man. Where are you going for the honeymoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowhere, I think. Work and economy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, fudge! Why don't you both go down to 'Pollards' for a
      week? I shan't be there, but you and the pater get on
      pretty well together."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated, filling his pipe. He was thinking of many
      things, the tips that might be expected, the atmosphere,
      the obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very kind of you, Peter, but I may manage a week-end at
      Hastings or somewhere. I rather feel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I get you. Rather a private and intimate
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, when can I meet Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow. Come round and have tea in the lab. The
      upstairs part is being redecorated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter lit his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the sort of thing I love. When you come down to
      Coventry I'll give you tea in the machine-shop."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was no fireplace in J. J.'s lab., but added warmth
      was not needed on that April day. J. J.'s working table was
      cleared of its impedimenta, and two extra chairs were
      bumped down the narrow stairs. Kitty had rushed out and
      bought flowers, tulips and narcissi from the flower-woman
      in Russell Square. She was happy and excited; she was to
      meet the superlative Peter, who was to be J. J.'s best man.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was nervous, quite foolishly nervous. It was one of
      those occasions when he was conscious of his absurd little
      legs. How would Peter and Kitty get on together? Too well,
      or not at all? He need not have worried. He thought the tea
      table charming, and so it was, with its flowers and pretty
      cottage-china. Kitty could be as fastidious as a sensitive
      child, and she had the grace of an art that would have
      turned a coal-cellar somehow into a fairy's cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at the window, and J. J. hurried to the door. He
      had told Peter to look for a window-box with hyacinths in
      it, and Peter had spotted the sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, what a jolly place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was the son of his father. He liked life in its
      realities, its surprises, its jocund tricks and phantasies.
      Old P. loved to get into a café in Montmartre, or a Soho
      club, or a collier's cottage or the cabin of a barge, and
      make contact with life in the real and the rough. The
      people who did real things had something to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter, this is Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty and Peter looked at each other, smiled and shook
      hands. J. J. had performed the introduction with a seeming
      casualness that concealed the secret exultation of the
      artist in a picture that was his. How would these two
      comely creatures shape in this obscure little room? Would
      Kitty be carried off her feet by this handsome youth? J. J.
      need not have worried, for Peter happened to be one of
      those men who are wise as to women, without knowing how
      this intuitive wisdom has arrived, and he had been so
      courted by mothers and daughters that he was a little bored
      with the sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, congratulations to J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not flattery, but sheer impulse. J. J. most
      certainly had stolen one of the golden apples of the
      Hesperides. Or might one call it a peach? Moreover, the
      peach had a sunny, open, wholesome face, and such very
      gentle eyes. Peter looked first at a woman's eyes, and then
      at her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed and glanced at J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It only matters if he thinks so."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. drank up that look like a man who was thirsty, and
      thanking God for good wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm lucky. Well, let's have tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at the flowers on the table. For so large a
      young man he surprised the stupid in his tastes and habits.
      He could arrange flowers like a woman, and he liked to
      nurse a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good bit of still life. How did you find this place, J.
      J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just luck, and predestination, perhaps. One of my unique
      discoveries. I found everything here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter glanced at Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Including?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, including that."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy and easy meal, for all three of them found
      they could be natural. Kitty had too much vitality to
      suffer from affectation, and Peter might have described her
      as "A Jolly Kid" had he not had the feeling that there was
      a good deal more to it than that. Some people had meaning,
      while others were mere stereotyped copies of someone else.
      But Kitty had work to do, and a suspicion that these two
      friends wanted to talk. Poor Mary could not be left in lone
      responsibility for the shop, so Kitty put on her pansy hat,
      and left them alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. crumbled tobacco into a pipe. He was smiling over it
      as though he found life good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "The last thing you expect happens."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter also was busy with a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty good thing too. How's the hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s smile disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather sticky, so far as I am concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old jossers don't like being jostled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found that out, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhat. But our show is a new show. It's not like one of
      the professions full of old gentlemen who think they have
      uttered the last word on everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. struck a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt whether I am made for doctoring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, too many doors slammed on you. Horrible confession,
      Peter, but I don't think I like the sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at him questioningly. This was a rather
      staggering confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, I thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So did I. The healing touch and all that. A noble
      tradition. But we don't heal; we only diagnose. Perhaps it
      is the hospital atmosphere. That's the worst of
      institutions, they are so apt to become museums."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter bit hard on his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much convention and humbug. Well, what's the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your trouble, J. J., is that you have one of those damned
      questioning minds which don't mix with the professional
      stock mixture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't take things for granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I believe you'd be happy in a wild corner of your
      own, digging things up and examining them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about it. But I shall qualify. One can earn money
      as a practising doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if you don't like the sick? Not very good for
      doctoring, old man. Rough on the patients."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder! Perhaps if they were my patients, and my
      problems--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's pipe had gone out, and he relit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't always know, does one, how things are going to
      pan out? Life gets you in funny ways. I suppose we
      youngsters have to do a lot of groping."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right. I'm in the groping phase. There is one thing
      that does matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. He saw that J. J.'s eyes were fixed on
      Kitty's empty chair.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was the quietest of quiet weddings. The unkind might
      have said that there was a secrecy about it that was
      suggestive, and that nature had intervened to hasten the
      ceremony. J. J.'s side of the church was empty save for Mr.
      and Mrs. Joe Clements, and Kitty's was hardly more
      populous. An uncle who resided in Balham turned up to give
      her away, and disappeared again with a somewhat forbidding
      wife after the minute reception at "Nanette's." The shop
      and the workroom were made to serve the day's good deed. An
      aunt, three dull cousins, and two or three friends
      completed the stage-crowd. There was no adequate audience
      to admire J. J.'s beautiful best man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no show of presents, for an occasional table
      would have held the lot. Old Pratten sent J. J. a cheque
      for £25, and Peter contributed a lesser one for ten. They
      drank indifferent white wine, and ate sandwiches and cakes.
      J. J. was glad when they got into Joe Clements' cab and
      were driven to Charing Cross Station. The mere conventions
      had been satisfied with music and a blessing, but J. J. had
      a feeling that some wild and pagan ritual consecrated by a
      sun-worshipping priest or a Druid upon Yatley Heath would
      have been more satisfying. The one utterly and lovely
      satisfaction was Kitty, a little shy, but wholly happy, and
      J. J.'s prayer was "May I never take that smile from your
      dear face."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sentimental reflection, but a man must have some
      sentiment in his life or perish, especially so the man
      whose urge and whose uniqueness may divide him from the
      herd. Maybe, J. J. had a feeling that his fate and his
      future were inherent in his cleaving to this one creature,
      and that she alone could keep him sane and whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed for five days at a quiet private hotel in
      Wellington Square. They wandered about the old town,
      climbed to the castle ruins, visited Battle, Winchelsea and
      Rye. J. J. would always remember Kitty in a pink linen
      frock having tea in a Winchelsea garden. The sun shone upon
      them. J. J. felt most strangely at peace.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a15" id="a15">15</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after their marriage J. J. had to serve his month
      in hospital as maternity-clerk, being called up at all
      hours to visit the purlieus of Soho, and help to bring
      little Jews, Italians, Russians, and some little English
      into the world. It was a messy business, conducted in a
      world of poverty, ignorance and squalor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life to J. J. Pope was a series of phenomena, a kind of
      jungle-growth into which he probed. As yet he had no
      ultimate plan for burning the jungle into a garden. He
      might have preferred the jungle to the garden. He was like
      one of those separative souls who set out into the
      wilderness to study the life history of some tropical pest,
      and who are not concerned in turning a semi-intelligent
      monkey into a Professor of Eugenics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he impress the vulgar. Some large and truculent
      young man who might and did say to a screaming Italian:
      "Take that damned towel and stuff it in your mouth," was
      more impressive to the women. It made them feel that they
      were being handled by a man. J. J., appearing in the
      doorway with a large black bag, looked rather like a small
      boy who had been told to carry in the doctor's impedimenta.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last night on duty supplied the suggestive climax. He
      climbed some deplorable stairs to find a bucket of filth
      standing outside a door. He knocked. A red-faced woman with
      hair in curlers opened the door to him. She was lively with
      liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'yer want, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. produced the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this Mr. Bartlett's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Don't tell me you're the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I happen to be that person."
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke into hilarious cacklings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you ain't growed up. Coo, Polly, see what the
      'ospital 'as sent along."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman on the dirty bed was groaning, and though she too
      had drunk herself silly, her sense of humour was not equal
      to her friend's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, Flo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor, hee-hee-hee. You'd better go back and tell the
      'ospital to send along a growed man. Why, you don't look
      old enuff ter be a faver."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. pushed past her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and sit down, you drunken fool, and leave me to get on
      with the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in the vulgar parlance, tore it. The lady in the
      curlers flared into a screaming rage, but so unsteady was
      she on her feet that she tripped over a crumpled and dirty
      rug, and falling against a decrepit wash-hand stand, upset
      the whole contraption. She arose, maudlin and still
      screaming, but with a bloody head; the groans of the
      prospective mother added to the din. J. J. put down the
      bag, took the woman by the shoulders from behind, and
      pushed her out on to the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out and stay out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked the door on her, and she subsided on the stairs,
      holding her head and weeping. Fancy a gentleman treating
      you like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. safely delivered the mother of twins, after he had
      broken the news to her that it was to be a double event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Gawd, sir, don't say there's two of 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out sellin' pipers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this hour! Isn't there anybody to help you, but that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I find anybody presently?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Mrs. Bunce on the ground floor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second baby was born dead, and when J. J. told the
      mother that it was dead, the poor wretch gave thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a blessin', doctor. Thank Gawd for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., going in search of a possible Mrs. Bunce, found the
      other lady snoring on the stairs. He stepped over her,
      descended, eschewing the greasy handrail. Mrs. Bunce proved
      to be sullen and elderly, and not too ready to play the
      nurse. Polly Bloomer was drunk, was she! Well, that wasn't
      anything very original. Mrs. Bunce grumbled, but she did
      consent to help in the emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two kids and one of 'em dead. Well, that should be a
      blessin', with 'er 'usband carryin' on round the corner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bunce straddled scornfully over the snoring Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice sort o' slut to 'elp a friend on a night like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did all that was necessary, and then left the mother,
      the live baby and the dead one to Mrs. Bunce. What happened
      to such dead babies? For the life of him he did not know.
      Such incidents were not recorded in the text-books. Had he
      any duty in the matter? Who could tell him? He might ask
      old Crabb the night-porter. Old Crabb was completely wise
      as to the technique of these affairs.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., being young, should have asked himself why London
      was like this, and why it should not be otherwise. He might
      have accused the Industrial System, the wicked Capitalists,
      International Finance, Grub Street or God. He did nothing
      of the kind. He supposed that it was human nature, and that
      London had just grown like this, which explanation was
      nearer the truth than the diatribes of the wavers of red
      flags. What he did was to rush back to Kitty and
      cleanliness, wallow in a hip-bath which Kitty helped him to
      fill, and rejoice in the sweet sanity and order of that
      obscure little home. He wanted to wash the smell of
      midwifery away from him. It might be some men's job, but,
      most certainly it was not his. The polished efficiency of a
      lab., however small, was more to his liking than the
      operating theatre and the post-mortem room. Such places
      were the termini of disharmonies; J. J.'s urge was to work
      for a rhythm that had not yet suffered from fatal discords.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have a week-end in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, let's," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see if the stone is all right over Aunt Jane's
      grave. They can put us up at 'The Checquers'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lovely idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was part of the loveliness of Kitty. She enjoyed the
      simplest of things. She was like one of those May mornings
      when the earth is the earth of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Killick, of The Chequers, welcomed them. He put them
      into the big bedroom overlooking the garden. It was
      bluebell time, and when, after tea in the garden they
      climbed up to Yatley Heath, the beech woods were full of
      the smell and the colour of the flowers. Kittys face became
      tender, her eyes luminous. She kneeled down and put her
      face to the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., I've never seen anything like it before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to live in the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Living in the country could be a strange business after
      Roper's Row and Mortimer Mews. J. J. did not press the
      project. He would be a qualified doctor at the end of the
      year, and in theory capable of earning an income.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the house-appointments to be considered, and
      they were living on his invested income and Kitty's
      earnings. But why these problems on such a day in May? J.
      J. put his arm round his wife's waist and drew her to the
      immense beech tree, which was a symbol of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think I did here, my sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat, side by side, on one of the great claws of the
      beech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked puzzled. What could you do here but sit and
      stare and dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I took my clothes off and danced. Disgraceful
      exhibition, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you really, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, really. Like to try it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She crooked an arm round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't mind dancing, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are limits! Midsummer madness. But you can fancy
      things here. Look at the darkness under those trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked, and suddenly her arm tightened, and then
      withdrew itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look--someone."
    </p>
    <p>
      A white figure was rising out of the glooms. It came by the
      sunken way, slowly, silently, almost like a drifting ghost,
      and J. J. felt a strange tremor flicker down his spine. His
      dark lady of the old days rising to remind him of those
      strange and haunting thoughts, the poignant provocation of
      beauty! He looked. His arm was round his wife, and it
      remained there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Strange. Do you remember, the one we saw married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      The white figure passed into a patch of sunlight, and stood
      poised there, and somehow, to J. J., it expressed tragic
      things, sadness, bitterness, frustration. Was Miss Sybil
      Marwood finding in the Strange world--? And then she saw
      them. She seemed to stiffen with a vague resentment, as
      though her secret self was being spied upon. But should one
      show that one was aware of idle curiosity? Of course not,
      if you were sensitive and had humiliations to conceal. Mrs.
      Strange walked on and past them, head up, her profile that
      of a great lady walking in some grave, ceremonial show. Not
      an eyelash flickered. They saw her disappear down one of
      the green rides which spread from the great beech like the
      rays of a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Kitty: "She's very lovely, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not lovely inside, my sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't say that. How does one know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you say she looked happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty pondered a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I should say not."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home they turned into Yatley churchyard to
      inspect the headstone which a Dewhurst mason had erected.
      It was a very simple stone, bearing Miss Jane Pope's name,
      and nothing more. Why date the dead, or hand a text over a
      memory that may be sacred? J. J., hatless, held his wife's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one knew how good she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but the village may have thought her hard. May I
      cherish that sort of hardness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before supper Kitty went to change her frock, and J. J.
      strolled into the private bar and found Mr. Killick alone
      there. Mr. Killick stood J. J. half-a-pint of ale, and J.
      J., remembering the incident on Yatley Heath, asked Mr.
      Killick a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is the Strange show progressing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Killick put his pot down on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum. Now you've asked me one. Well, they do say young
      Strange is on with Milly Eastwood. You know, the Squire's
      cowman's kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, little Milly Eastwood. Why, she's not sixteen yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eighteen, my lad, and a big, strapping girl now. Young
      Strange is a fellow who can't keep from the women, and it
      seems you can't keep the women from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stared at the tawny liquid in his pot. So, that was
      that. His dark lady's wine was poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The name of J. J. Pope should have been a comet trailing a
      fine, academic tail behind it, those symbolic letters which
      denote scholarly distinction. No doubt he had expected to
      see his name in print followed by F.R.C.P., F.R.C.S., etc.,
      but the tail of his comet was abruptly curtailed. When
      people looked him up in the Medical Directory, before his
      name had been erased from that record, they discovered that
      all that he could show was a mediocre M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,
      London, with a B.A. Cambridge tagged on to it. The world
      might have concluded that Mr. J. J. Pope had no academic
      honours to his credit, and that he was something of a
      charlatan, a fellow who had just grabbed a qualification,
      and then boosted himself on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, it must be admitted that J. J, did two very indiscreet
      things during the last period of his hospital career. The
      Puck in him perpetrated one of them, the research-student
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote and posted a letter to the Dean, enclosing the
      marriage certificate, and asking for the return of the
      latter. The Dean considered it a very impertinent letter,
      and he showed it to a number of his colleagues. The
      marriage certificate he returned without comment. But the
      senior staff were agreed that J. J. Pope was not a person
      to be encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s second indiscretion was the publishing, at his own
      expense, of two pamphlets, one on the inadequate activities
      of the Pharmaceutical Society, the other upon research work
      he had carried out upon colloids, with suggestions as to
      their future therapeutic value. Moreover, he posted copies
      of those pamphlets to members of the staff. A most
      impertinent proceeding. Here was a little fellow, not yet
      qualified, daring to criticise an august society and to
      suggest to his seniors certain new developments in the
      preparation and administration of drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Padiman, having discussed the matter with some
      of his colleagues, took the opportunity of snubbing J. J.
      in public. Sir Thomas was going round his wards with a
      large following of students, and J. J. was among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am obliged to you for sending me your pamphlet. May I
      suggest that, for so Inexperienced a young man, it is a
      little previous."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., knowing that all eyes were on him, compelled himself
      to casualness and a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid all new work is rather previous, sir. Pasteur
      was terribly previous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrogant young cub! Sir Thomas seized the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you bracket yourself with Pasteur, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd tittered, but J. J. had the last word, another
      indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, sir, that the young are penalised for asking
      questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas ignored the remark, but he made a point of
      remembering it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. took his final that winter. Only one of the examiners
      was a St. Mark's man, nor is it suggested that had they all
      been St. Mark's men, J. J. Pope would have been ploughed.
      There are far more cultivated and subtle ways of
      side-tracking a dangerous member of a profession. The
      papers were mere child's play to J. J. The examiner in
      Pharmacology, when he came to viva J. J., complimented him
      upon his paper, and elevated the viva voce catechism into a
      conversation on new drags and methods. Being innocent and
      impartial he happened to say to his St. Mark's confrere:
      "That's a rather remarkable young man you have at your
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man named Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much too remarkable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we shall hear more of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a number of eminent gentlemen were conscientiously
      determined that as little as possible should be heard of
      this young man. After all, it is only human nature to
      bestow favours upon those whom we like, and to ignore those
      who provoke prejudice. It was not a question of pragmatical
      hostility. All that a professional clique may have to do is
      to ignore a particular person, and grant him no
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope passed his final test. Results were posted on
      the hospital board, and successful candidates interviewed
      and congratulated by the Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. So-an-So, what of the future? Do you propose to
      take up hospital appointments? Useful experience. Two
      house-surgeons and a house-physician will be needed during
      the next two months. Obstetrics, also."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was not interviewed. He was aware of the omission,
      but he could claim no prerogative. He carried the news of
      his success home to Kitty, and found her, not at Mortimer
      Mews, but at Roper's Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm through, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had some piece of millinery on her knees, and while
      still holding it in one hand she both embraced and draped
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How splendid! Of course I knew you would be. Mary, Mary,
      J.'s a real live doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Rackstraw looked both enigmatic and amused. Kitty's
      enthusiasms were of the simplest, but they did carry a rich
      flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see any difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, save that I shall have to mind my p's and q's, or the
      Great Panjandrum will tread on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, lying at night with her head on J. J.'s shoulder,
      talked of the future, but not as her own self saw it. What
      next for J. J.? Of course the hospital would need him for a
      while, for Kitty, in her innocence, believed that her
      husband was destined for greatness. No doubt she dreamed
      her own feminine dreams, of a little house in some street
      sacred to the distinguished members of the profession, of
      old Georgian furniture, and china, and pictures, of eminent
      patients attending in J. J.'s waiting-room, of a brougham
      or one of the new autocars, of dinners and little
      celebrations. Somehow Kitty was not afraid of confronting
      the social responsibilities that might be hers. She had too
      much vitality for fear, or for those self-conscious
      shrinkings which afflict the poor in spirit. She had found
      the world kind to her, for few people could look at her and
      feel unkind. She did not suspect how unkind it could be to
      a little person like J. J. Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., stroking her head, was guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, we'll see. I may put up a plate somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will it be, J., before you are in Harley Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Years, my sweet. Do you want to live in Harley Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      No adequate reason now remained for J. J. Pope to attend at
      St. Mark's, unless the hospital desired to make use of him.
      The alternatives were obvious and familiar. He might take a
      sea voyage as a ship's doctor, squat or buy a share in a
      practice, or serve as an assistant to some G. P., but J. J.
      continued to go daily to St. Mark's. A mood of ironical
      curiosity possessed him. He was waiting to see whether any
      minor post would be offered to him, and how the new
      vacancies in the wards would be filled. The magnanimity of
      his seniors was on trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attended at out-patients, followed surgeons and
      physicians round the wards, and was ignored. He needed no
      more educating, and his seniors had no intention of
      submitting to being educated by him. There are quiet and
      inobtrusive ways of freezing a fellow out. When the two new
      house-physicians were selected, J. J. was not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That decided him. He would shake off the dust, but not
      before he had raised the dust with his particular enemy,
      the Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the Dean's room one morning in January when
      Dr. Parkhurst was feeling the first symptom of flu. It was
      not a happy occasion, nor did J. J. expect it to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Pope. Excuse me, I'm afraid--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall only keep you a minute, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to thank you, sir, and all the staff for the very
      great help and encouragement I have received here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean blew his nose, and glared. He was feeling shivery
      and irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leaving us, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so. I think research is more in my line. If I can
      produce anything of value I shall, of course, realise that
      the hospital inspired it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parkhurst felt a surge of heat. This polite, cold
      sarcasm was no ice-bag, but like the prick of a needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tm afraid certain personalities, Mr. Pope, are
      not--popular. But please excuse me, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. rose, smiling and suave and ruthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, sir. I quite realise that I have made mistakes.
      Enthusiasm can be very foolish. I will take it where it
      will not cause discomfort."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean sneezed, and groped for a handkerchief. Could not
      this little prig see that he was a sick man?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid, Mr. Pope, I am not in a mood to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you taken your temperature, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have not. Good morning, Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. If you will excuse me I think bed is
      indicated."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. walked out of the hospital and into the familiar
      forecourt. Nor was he ever to re-enter its doors.

    </p>
    <p>
      So, very early in his married life, J. J. Pope was faced
      with the question of how much he should tell his wife. To
      confess to a woman that you are anathema to other men may
      be either easy or very hard. That will depend upon the
      texture of a man's pride, and J. J. had the devil's own
      pride. If poor Kitty's eyes were turned towards ultimate
      social splendours, it seemed dastardly to disillusion her,
      and J. J. decided to keep secret the smart of ostracism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a plan was necessary, and when he had meditated upon
      it, he confided it to Kitty with an air of wilful
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want your opinion, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it hurt you to leave this place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it would not hurt her. Her dreams already were
      packed up for the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, darling. Have you got to live in hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm realising that is not necessary. You see, my sweet, I
      want to halve my days, one half to doctoring, the other to
      research. The idea is to find a corner near here where I
      can put up a plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A new house, all our own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lovely! I suppose it will only be temporary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll see about that. You and I will have to spy out the
      land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and look for--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where doctors are not too thick on the earth. My idea is
      to run a dispensary, which can work in with my lab. I must
      have my guinea-pigs."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not see the bitter joke. Maybe she divined the
      gold, not the sick humanity that would be necessary to J.
      J.'s dual purpose. He must earn his fees, however paltry
      they might prove, and retain the patients upon whom he
      would experiment with the products of research. Kitty might
      have been a little shocked had she realised how
      dispassionately he viewed the sick. It was their
      disharmonies that interested him, not their claim as human
      beings to be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which goes to show how much J. J. Pope had yet to learn
      about the subtleties of healing. At this period of his
      career he was thinking more of the mucous membranes than of
      the mind. Being himself so strong in his pursuit of that
      which piqued him, he had not yet divined that both the will
      to be well and the will to live may be absent. He was a
      laboratory man, a master of material technique, unqualified
      as yet to practice in that larger laboratory, humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, each afternoon, J. J. and Kitty took a bus ride and
      spied out the land. Both of them were agreed that
      Bloomsbury would not be a suitable neighbourhood for a man
      who had lived in Mortimer Mews, and that new ground should
      be searched for. They wandered round Highbury, Canonbury,
      Stoke Newington, Clapham, Kensington and Chelsea, and their
      choice fell upon Chelsea. Probably, it was Kitty's sudden
      passion for a particular little house which was empty and
      to let in Chellwood Terrace that persuaded J. J. to choose
      .the suburb of the Sage. Moreover, Chelsea did not appear
      to be plastered with physicians, and a squatting doctor
      might count upon collecting a small practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty stood looking at No. 5 Chellwood Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her glowing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chellwood Terrace was William IV, a row of little white
      houses, each with four steps ascending to green front
      doors. It was comely and intimate, and pleasantly
      proportioned. Each house had a small front garden enclosed
      by low iron railings, and perhaps its charm was emphasised
      by the fact that it was confronted by a row of hideous, red
      brick monstrosities of the Victorian period, houses that
      suggested a parade of tall, lean, attenuated maiden aunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's look over it, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      The keys were to be had at a house-agent's in the Fulham
      Road. J. J. was wondering what the rent would be, and
      whether a long lease would be insisted upon. Inquiries at
      the house-agents produced the necessary information. The
      rent was £55 a year, the rates in proportion. No. 5 had
      been re-decorated, and the owner would prefer to grant a
      seven years' lease. The gentleman behind the desk was
      polite but realist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like references, sir. May I ask--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a doctor. I suppose there is no objection to my
      putting up a plate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, none at all. That makes a difference, a distinct
      difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May we have the keys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just one point, supposing I might wish to move into a
      bigger house, would there be any difficulty in disposing of
      the lease?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, none at all, sir, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. and Kitty went off with the keys. Kitty held on to J.
      J.'s arm. She was as excited as a child. "Bless her,"
      thought J. J. He insisted upon her unlocking the door. The
      lady of the house should perform so significant a ceremony.
      They found themselves in a hall-passage, with cream walls
      and skirting-boards. The place smelt of fresh paint, and
      Kitty's pretty nose savoured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So nice to start clean."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 5 Chellwood Terrace surprised them. It was more roomy
      than it appeared. A semi-basement house, it had a
      sitting-room below, which could serve as a dispensary.
      Kitty was enthusiastic. J. J. could see his private
      patients in the back sitting-room, and the humbler folk in
      the basement. There were four bedrooms, and one of them
      could be converted into a laboratory; yes, the one with the
      nice big window looking on the back garden. Kitty was
      delighted with the back garden. It had high brick walls, a
      little lawn, and an old pear tree, and a tool-shed attached
      to the end wall. It was a wintry spot at the moment, but
      Kitty was dreaming dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could grow flowers here, J., lots of flowers. I do love
      flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. put his arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think you'd be happy here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, darling, of course I should."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was granted a seven years' lease of No. 5 Chellwood
      Terrace. He estimated that their expenditure would be round
      about £250 a year. His own private income amounted to £100
      and Kitty, who was selling her share of "Nanette's" to
      Mary, could count upon £200 in cash. She had decided, and
      quite rightly so, according to the conventions of that
      generation, that the wife of a physician in Chelsea could
      not be associated with the retail trade. Moreover, she was
      now both wife and housewife, and proposing to supervise the
      work of one small maid. It was Kitty who suggested that her
      two hundred pounds should be spent on buying furniture, for
      Mortimer Mews would not garnish No. 5 Chellwood Terrace,
      and J. J. agreed. His own capital would remain intact,
      though a small portion of it might have to be sacrificed in
      fitting up his dispensary, and in filling the gap between
      his private income and his expenditure, until he had
      gathered a few patients and was earning fees. Meanwhile,
      Kitty had to be safe-guarded, and J. J. wrote to Mr. Roper
      and instructed him to prepare a will in which J. J. left
      all his possessions to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. bought a frock coat and a top-hat. He liked neither
      of these decorations. Maybe, he realised that a frock coat
      made his little legs look shorter, and the hat emphasised
      the largeness of his head. Did Kitty notice these
      bizarreries? As a matter of fact, she did not. She loved a
      person, not a fashion-plate. That she was just as tall as
      her husband somehow did not matter. She was conscious of J.
      J.'s inward stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chellwood Terrace was not so urban and anonymous that it
      could fail to be interested in new residents, especially so
      when a brass plate appeared upon the gate of No. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. J. J. Pope, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P."
    </p>
    <p>
      New furniture, etc., was being delivered at No. 5, and
      Chellwood Terrace saw a pretty young thing appearing and
      disappearing with a flutter of happy activity. No. 4 housed
      a solicitors managing clerk and his family, a rather
      meticulous person who immediately pointed out to his
      secretly bored wife that the fellow next door had no right
      to inscribe Doctor on his place. Only a Fellow of the
      College of Physicians could claim that distinction. Mrs.
      Megby asked him whether it mattered. A Mr. Stout and his
      wife occupied No. 6. Mr. Stout managed a wine shop, and
      looked it. He was fat and florid, and had a roving eye. The
      descent upon this suburban dullness of such a pretty young
      blonde made life seem more colourful to Mr. Stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen the wife? She's a looker."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stout was not interested. Percy was far too
      sentimental and polygamous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think much of the doctor fellah. Funny little bit.
      Looks as though Moses had fitted him out with someone
      else's frock coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Kitty nor J. J. were aware of faces at windows, or
      of the critical interest of their neighbours. Their new
      little world absorbed them, and if Kitty loved the
      garnishing of the new home, J. J. was no less proud of it,
      for No. 5 expressed for him something he had never
      possessed, even in the Yatley days. This place was his,
      most intimately his, to be shared with a creature who was
      the one person in the world with whom he felt whole and at
      his ease. Kitty and the house were one. It was his bed, his
      fire, his armchair, his dinner-table, his workshop. He
      could do in it what he pleased. J. J. had suffered from so
      much antagonism and disharmony in the world of men that
      Kitty and Kitty's house gave him a new sense of security
      and peace. Almost, he could think of himself as a drake in
      a nice green pond, inspired to exultant quackings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate future did not trouble him. Settling in was a
      fascinating business, though it had its adventures. J. J.
      in his shirt sleeves, struggled with pieces of furniture
      which his wife wished to try in alternative positions. He
      laid stair-carpet and linoleum, fitted up his lab. and put
      up shelves in the dispensary that was to be. J. J. was
      proving himself handy about the house. But how often they
      were to laugh over the incident of the bed!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bed with one of those new wire mattresses. The
      furniture movers had offered to erect it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we put it up for you, guvnor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thanks, we can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. wanted the fellows out of the house. He was prepared
      to tackle the bed. The erecting of the frame was easy. Then
      the wire mattress had to be stretched until two bolts poked
      their noses through a wooden cross-piece, and nuts could be
      slipped on. J. J. began that tug-of-war with easy
      confidence, only to discover that this steel devil was
      malicious and obdurate. J. J. tugged and panted. The
      conquest of this stubborn thing was a question of pride,
      for though J. J. was something of a genius, he was
      sensitive about his stature and his lack of brute strength.
      With set teeth he fought with that mattress; he would get
      one of the bolts nearly into position, but not quite far
      enough for the nut, to take the thread. He sweated. Again
      and again he tugged at the thing, only to find that his
      strength was just too small for the final conquest, and
      unless that mattress was conquered he and Kitty would have
      no bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he realised that he was beaten, and that Kitty
      would have to help him. He went to the head of the stairs
      and called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you give me a hand for a moment? This is a
      non-conformist bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran upstairs to find him flushed and sweating, with the
      veins standing out on his forehead, both exasperated and
      exhausted, and trying to hide his anger behind a flicker of
      fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the wire mattress. No sense of humour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., why didn't you call me before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foolish male pride. Come here and pull. If we can get
      these damned bolts through so that you can slip the nuts
      on, the spanner will do the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side, and each with a foot against the bed-frame,
      they tugged at the thing, and the added force sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, while I hold it. Quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty slipped the nuts on and the struggle was over, but J.
      J.'s underwear was sticking to his body.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During the first two or three weeks at Chellwood Terrace
      neither Kitty nor her husband worried about the appearance
      of possible patients. No. 5 was not yet prepared to welcome
      the sick, and both J. J. and Kitty were busy. J. J. had
      ordered a very modest supply of drugs, and had purchased
      such instruments as might be essential, and the little
      dispensary was garnished and prepared. Moreover, J. J. was
      glad of the leisure in which to fit up his lab., and resume
      work upon his various lines of research. He was
      experimenting with pepsin, and one or two new coal tar
      products as analgesics, and an intestinal antiseptic in
      colloid form.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet they had engaged no maid, for they were enjoying
      having the house to themselves, Kitty was doing the
      housework and the cooking, and it must be revealed that in
      those early days her cooking was experimental and somewhat
      a frying pan affair. If J. J. needed a stomach upon which
      to try his products, he discovered it in himself. Kitty's
      early efforts as a cook gave him indigestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Kitty never knew what qualms her early efforts had
      caused him, which, indeed, was pure devotion. Moreover, one
      test case, even though it was personal, was utterly
      inconclusive. Hundreds of such cases would be needed before
      the efficiency of any such product could be proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arose the question of a maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think we ought to have one, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could manage, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prestige, my sweet. Someone must answer the door.
      Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a rational world, yes, but this isn't a rational world.
      It lives on appearances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Service was no problem in those days, and Kitty obtained
      from a local agency a young girl named Ethel. Kitty engaged
      her because Ethel had a smile, and all the symptoms of good
      nature. It was about all she did have to begin with. But
      Ethel was educatable, and attachable to a mistress such as
      Kitty. She took life rather as a joke, but as a joke that
      was worth enjoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when some six weeks had passed, and no prospective
      patient had rung the bell of No. 5, both J. J. and Kitty
      began to worry. J. J. kept his anxiety to himself, though
      every idle day that passed meant wastage of capital. As for
      Kitty, she displayed a bright face, but she would sit at
      the dining-room window and watch for someone to open the
      green iron gate. If she was elsewhere she listened for the
      bell, and whenever it rang, she hoped for a patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the front door bell, Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be someone to see Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o'clock one afternoon the bell rang, and Ethel
      went to answer it. She found a seedy and elderly gentleman
      on the doorstep. His nose was red, and his breath
      alcoholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the doctor in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's just gone out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the lady in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go and tell her, my girl, there's a gentleman to see
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel showed the caller into the dining-room, and dashed
      off to Kitty who was working in the garden, sowing the
      seeds of hardy annuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman, ma'am, to see the doctor. I told 'im as 'e
      was out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ethel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E's wanting to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty rushed in to wash her hands, and making a smiling
      entry, found the strange gentleman arranging a number of
      dog-eared leaflets on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, I'm so sorry the doctor's out. He--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll do just as well, madam. I've called to bring to
      your notice a number of most interestin' books. Now, 'ere
      we 'ave a new domestic compendium, published in twelve
      parts, price three guineas the twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's radiance was dimmed. The possible patient was just
      a cheap tout whom it took her twenty minutes to convince
      that none of his wares were needed, even though you had not
      to pay cash down. In fact Kitty was still struggling with
      his impertinent persistence when J. J. returned and took
      over the argument. The debate looked like beginning all
      over again until J. J. feeling puckish and irritated,
      looked the gentleman in the face, and made a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll treat your dyspepsia gratis for a free edition of
      that encyclopedia."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tout was non-plussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'aven't got dyspepsia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even a liver?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even a liver, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, then I'm afraid we can't do business."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. became more worried. He might have infinite leisure
      for his experimental work, but such work could not continue
      unless some shekels were poured into the treasury. A
      professional gentleman is not allowed to advertise, though
      he may symbolise his success by the house he occupies, the
      carriage he drives, the dinners he gives, and the dresses
      his wife may wear. J. J. pondering this problem, was
      compelled to realise that if no patients came to the house,
      then he must make some show of leaving the house to visit
      hypothetical patients. After all, a fellow could take a
      walk and make it appear a professional pilgrimage without
      being guilty of excessive humbug. So, J. J. put on his top
      hat and walked with the brisk air of a doctor who had
      patients to attend. Some days he walked miles, wore out
      much boot-leather and became familiar with nearly every
      street in Chelsea. He had a preference for the embankment
      and the river, and sometimes he would cross the Albert
      Bridge and stroll round Battersea Park. The trouble was
      that he could not linger or sit on seats, for busy
      professional gentlemen did not do such things. To maintain
      the illusion he sometimes carried a black, surgical bag
      with him, but if a cat was in the bag he could not let the
      poor beast out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Stout of No. 6 suggested that his wife should
      call on No. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems a poor sort of show for the kids. Ought to be kind
      and neighbourly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stout demurred. Percy's altruism was apt to be
      inspired by a passion for the opposite sex, especially so
      when they were lookers like Mrs. Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's there to think about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stout was given to sour candour. She said, and frankly
      so, that if the doctor's wife had been fat and fifty Percy
      would have suffered from no urge towards neighbourliness.
      Mr. Stout was equally frank. He said that if a woman was
      jealous she might look in her mirror to find out the
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, fate and dressed crab had marked down Mr. Stout as J.
      J.'s first patient. Both the Stouts were exceedingly
      healthy people, and having been in residence only a year,
      they had not engaged the services of a medical man. Mr.
      Stout liked to celebrate on Saturday nights; he might bring
      home a lobster or a crab, and on this particular occasion
      it must have been the crab that was responsible for his
      inward disorder. Mr. Stout woke about midnight in acute
      pain; he was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gasped at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been poisoned. It must have been that crab. I feel
      like dying, Maudie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stout did not want him to die. She was fond of the
      creature and of her comforts, and death would be a
      financial disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fetch a doctor. Next door will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stout dressed herself hurriedly and incompletely, and
      went out in person to ring the bell of No. 5. It woke
      Kitty, and she sat up in bed. The bell went on ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty shook her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., there's the bell. It must be a patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. got out of bed, slipped into a dressing-gown and went
      downstairs. He found what appeared to be a large black
      bundle on the doorstep, an agitated bundle, with a
      frightened face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, doctor, will you come at once and see Mr. Stout.
      Something's disagreed with him. He's in awful agony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eaten anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, crab."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. found the wine merchant in a state of collapse due in
      the main to pain and panic. Mr. Stout's interior appeared
      to have dealt so thoroughly with the invader that J. J.
      decided to treat the pain and the panic. Was there any
      brandy in the house? What a question! J. J. administered to
      Mr. Stout two ounces of neat brandy and a hypodermic of
      morphia. Mr. Stout lapped up the brandy. This young doctor
      seemed to be a man of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like him to have a hot bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wait awhile downstairs. I'd like to see how he
      reacts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it is food-poisoning, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say most certainly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat for an hour in the Stout drawing-room,
      contemplating the smug awfulness of it. Mrs. Stout appeared
      to have a liking for every sort of ornament, and clashes of
      red and yellow. The lady was upstairs, sitting by her
      suffering mate. The house was very still, and J. J. himself
      was beginning to feel sleepy when footsteps came creaking
      down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's asleep, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Let him sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much, doctor. So sorry to have disturbed you.
      Will you call again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Early in the morning. Send for me earlier if the symptoms
      should recur."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s treatment of Mr. Percy Stout was so very successful
      that in forty-eight hours Mr. Stout was back at business.
      He was a dramatic person, flamboyant in his description of
      anything that happened to Percy. He declared that he had
      been on the edge of death, and that Dr. Pope had saved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gave me brandy, my dear fellah. I was feeling like passing
      out. Yes, and a dig with a needle. A dashed clever young
      beggar, if you ask me. Knew what to do at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stout became a good publicity agent for Dr. J. J. Pope.
      A fellow who prescribed brandy was the right sort of
      fellow. And Mr. Stout called on Kitty, and in twenty
      minutes was calling her "My dear."

    <h1>
      <a name="a17" id="a17">17</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On a large graph attached to the wall of J. J.'s lab. three
      mysterious words began to appear:
    </p>
    <p>
      Genasol--Pepsonol--Iodol.
    </p>
    <p>
      They might have been the names of Three Graces, or the
      members of a mysterious Trinity; in actual fact they were
      the three principal products of J. J.'s researches waiting
      to be tested out upon sick humanity. Dosage and results
      were to be recorded on the graph, and also in a case-book
      which J. J. kept locked in a drawer. Not that he expected
      anyone to steal his secrets; it was just part of his
      puckishness to make a mystery of things and to chuckle
      behind the back of a hostile professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patients, human guinea-pigs, that was his need. He had no
      hospital wards at his service. He needed equipment of his
      own designing, and since he could not afford to have it
      made for him even in miniature, he improvised. A part of
      his big room looked like a Heath Robinson museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patients!
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s receipts in petty cash and book-debts during the
      first six months amounted to £23 7s. 6d., and a quarter of
      the book-debts were duds. Certain people who had exhausted
      the patience of other medical men in the neighbourhood came
      to the new young doctor to exploit him. They would pay him
      when the moon became cream-cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. found himself suffering from frustration both
      financially and in the matter of human material. His need
      was a clinic to which he might attract the sufferers from
      the particular disharmonies upon which he was
      concentrating. He had asked himself a very simple question.
      What were the two disorders which were most prevalent? Why,
      just dyspepsia and chronic rheumatism. Nothing dramatic and
      disastrous like cancer, or poetic like the White Death. A
      bio-chemist who could produce reliable remedies for these
      two work-a-day ills might be conferring more benefits upon
      his fellows than the most brilliant of surgeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the second six months at No. 5 Chellwood Terrace Dr.
      Pope's private practice showed a considerable improvement,
      and the receipts were sufficient to enable him to live. As
      yet there was no jam for Kitty, and Kitty did not complain.
      But his human, experimental material was lacking in mass.
      He needed scores of patients for his human lab., people of
      the poorer classes who would be attracted by small fees.
      For weeks J. J. pondered the problem until the solution
      suggested itself. No. 5 Chellwood Terrace might suffice for
      his more profitable patients, but it would not serve the
      purpose he had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. confided his plan to Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I need is a dispensing practice, a kind of clinic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty might be bearing more than he knew, but her vitality
      and her happy nature were, for the time being, adequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could you work it, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained his plan, and it troubled her. It seemed to
      promise infinite labour, much expense, and it did not
      encourage her feminine dreams. Kitty still thought of J. J.
      in another world, a world in which she would share his
      triumphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you be working too hard, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm pretty tough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the expense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, J. J. Pope put his plan into action. He rented an empty
      shop in the Caroline Road. He had the windows painted brown
      to a height of six feet, and upon the door was inscribed in
      gold: "Dr. J. J. Pope's Clinic." The interior was
      partitioned off in two small rooms, and fitted up with
      austere simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other medical men may have looked askance at the
      experiment. It could not be condemned as advertising,
      though it could be damned as lacking dignity. This Pope
      fellow was a sixpenny cheapjack. That was all there was to
      it. And as for the penurious patients who might visit him,
      well, J. J. Pope was welcome to them. There was no profit
      in such people.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s practice might be said to have separated Itself
      into two groups, representing respectively those who ate
      too much and those who ate too little. In both cases,
      however much the diet differed in bulk, it was often
      deficient in quality and in wisdom. That might be largely
      the fault of the social scheme, but J. J. was not tilting
      at windmills or setting out to alter human nature. He did
      not believe that some particular class or party was
      responsible for all the social injustices. A fool would
      always eat like a fool, and an indifferently bred animal
      remain a scrag. He was interested in the human hotchpotch
      as an investigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patients began to visit the shop in Caroline Road. Mostly
      they were elderly, either in age or in tissue-quality. For
      many of them J. J. might have prescribed a social
      incinerator, but this human brash was material to be used.
      J. J. was a curiously hard young man during these days.
      Separative as ever in his attitude to the crowd, he had no
      feeling that he owed humanity anything, and in fact he owed
      it very little. He did not see Christ crucified in some
      poor hobbling querulous old man. He loved where he chose,
      and where love was inevitable. He might give of his best to
      obscure humanity, but he did not love it. Why should he
      love it? Was there anything singular and splendid in it to
      deserve love? In some respects he was as scornful as the
      Sage of Chelsea. So many million people, mostly fools!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Rackstraw, visiting them sometimes on Sundays, began
      to wonder whether this marriage would prove a happy one.
      Mary was an observant person and not one of Carlyle's
      fools. It seemed to her that J. J. was developing what she
      described as a "Shut-up Face." Mary always had felt that
      there was a fanaticism, a potential hardness in this little
      man. Let him become absorbed in some particular purpose,
      and he might forget everything in his work, his tie, his
      wife, his meals, the very child in himself. Mary might have
      said that such men should not marry, and especially so not
      a joyous creature like Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the weather was fine they would have tea in the garden,
      which was very much Kitty's garden. To begin with, J. J.
      might not be there, though a chair was waiting for him. He
      was up above in what Mary would come to describe as that
      damned monastic cell. Kitty would have to call to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea. Mary's here."
    </p>
    <p>
      To them would come a man who seemed half awake, a man who
      had left most of his essential self in that upper room. The
      surface of him was social, and perfunctorily so, but his
      mind was still probing problems which other people were not
      supposed to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mary, how are hats?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary might try the prod of an ironic hatpin on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shut up shop on Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not catch the implication. J. J. was developing into
      one of those dreadful creatures who never shut up shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again Kitty might look a little anxiously at her
      man. J. J. did not notice it, but Mary did. She wanted to
      say to him "Wake up, you self-absorbed idiot. Haven't you
      the eyes to see that which wants to be played with?" Mary
      thought that her friend looked thinner; her child's face
      had become the woman's. She was quieter. Laugher had become
      a rare thing. She made Mary think of someone watching a
      cloud-shadow spreading over a summer landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When tea was over J. J. would light his pipe and begin to
      fidget. Mary understood that restlessness. J. J. wanted to
      be back with his blessed or accursed work. She noticed that
      his eyelids were red, like those of a man who sat up late
      reading for an exam. She let him go. She wanted to talk to
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J. J. looks rather tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sympathy was the lure, and Kitty fell to it, but there was
      no evidence of self in her confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's working so hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's the practice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, growing. But it's the clinic and his lab. work that
      take up so much time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No margin left for play."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's face seemed to close up like a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't mind. You see, J.'s not like most men. I feel
      he's made for big things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary divined the secret resistance she might encounter if
      she pressed her sympathy too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. But, after all, my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you think I'm not happy, you're wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not suggesting that. But what I do mean is, dear,
      that a man should be able to relax."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, hang it all, for his own."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s private practice was proving mildly lucrative, but,
      somehow, he forgot to increase Kitty's dress-allowance or
      to give her more money for housekeeping. Actually, it was
      the sixpenny clinic and his research work which were
      becoming parasitic upon his practice, for a sixpenny fee
      did not cover the cost of the new preparations with which
      he was experimenting. The various ingredients cost money;
      in fact they ate up all J. J.'s spare cash, and if his
      case-book was growing fat, the same could not be said of
      Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope's Shop," as other doctors called it, was collecting a
      crowd of habitual chronics. It cannot be said that these
      people liked Dr. Pope; he was too cold and rational and
      business-like, but he took great trouble with them, for
      they were his experimental material. Most of these folk
      were unaccustomed to being treated as though their ailments
      mattered, and this Dr. Pope did take trouble. It was not
      just a lick and a promise for six coppers. The young man
      was thorough, dreadfully thorough, but without a smile or a
      joke. These people were puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one old woman said to another: "He makes me feel some'ow
      that I might be one o' those paupers whose bodies go to the
      'ospital to be cut up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but 'e does take trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in a funny sort o' way, as though he was fonder of my
      rheumatics than 'e was of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gossip giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's there to laugh at in that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you ain't exactly the Belle o' New York, or Lottie
      Collins, dearie, are yer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      An atmosphere of scientific detachment may be necessary for
      research, but for the art of healing more one-ness with the
      patient is desirable. J. J. may have treated his chronics
      rather like guinea-pigs, but he was not such a fool as to
      fail to take into account habits and environment. Here he
      was up against all the "isms," and in conflict with the
      enthusiastic interferers who hold that education will solve
      all problems, or nearly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably he was pushed to the conclusion that even
      planned healing should be selective. There were patients
      who would not or could not help themselves to be well. In
      the case of diet they would fail to follow instructions,
      either because original sin was too strong in them, or they
      and their fellows were too ignorant or lazy. There were
      cases, of course, where facilities were lacking. The
      frying-pan was too universal, and English cooking too
      obvious and crude.
    </p>
    <p>
      When J. J., who was becoming something of a kitchen expert,
      and persuading Kitty and Ethel to carry out his experiments
      at No. 5, attempted to persuade some old woman to cook and
      eat certain unusual dishes, the reply might be "I can't do
      with things messed about like that." There was no subtlety,
      no fastidiousness in many of these people. They were a
      fried potato, boiled cabbage class.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to try and prove his theories, J. J. was compelled to
      become selective. He began to choose his particular
      patients, the more intelligent, those who were actively
      willing to be well, and to help in the process. Adaptation
      and self-restraint were necessary, and in spite of the
      Reformers, these qualities are somewhat rare.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s private practice was increasing, but owing to his
      expenditure upon research he was saving no money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he realise that he had not bought his wife a new frock,
      or even so much as a box of chocolates since their
      marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      What had become of those happy, irresponsible Sundays when
      they had wandered off to Kew, Hampton or Richmond? J. J.
      had no workless day. Sunday gave him more leisure for work
      in his lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he no suspicion that fellow practitioners upon whose
      toes he had trodden as a Squatter, were watching him
      carefully, and that one of them had written a letter to the
      Powers That Be, suggesting that Dr. J. J. Pope was guilty
      of advertising, in that he kept what might be described as
      a medical shop. Authority investigated the complaint, but
      decided that J. J.'s Clinic did not sufficiently transgress
      against the laws of professional etiquette. It might be
      cheap and undignified, but it was not an offence. Had Dr.
      J. J. Pope added to his name upon the glass door such words
      as "Specialist in Rheumatism and Gastritis," that would
      have been Sequah Stuff, and the Council might have taken
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was troubled. A woman may forgive a forgetfulness
      that is material, but emotional isolation can wound her.
      Were they to have no holidays, no contrasts, no play? She
      had put her house in order, and created for her comrade a
      smoothness which, like a summer night in the deeps of the
      country, was so peaceful that it passed unnoticed. Mary
      Rackstraw would have said that this little fanatic needed a
      shock, and that Kitty was too sweet-tempered and too easy
      with him. If she lost her temper now and again, J. J. Pope
      might sit up and take notice. Mary Rackstraw was both right
      and wrong. Life may have other ways of shocking a man into
      wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Genasol--Pepsol--Iodol."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Kitty, who, with infinite care, dusted J. J.'s lab.
      for him when he was elsewhere. He was fussy about his
      workshop, and she was careful to refrain from interference.
      But those three words began to haunt her. They were like
      the deities of some fatal Trinity, imposing upon her world
      a sedulous, puritanical deadness. Almost it seemed that J.
      J. might sacrifice everything to these three gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Kitty wept over J. J.'s table. She was feeling very
      lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him," said a voice in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should she tell him, and how? Were there other and less
      direct ways of making J. J. realise that something was
      lacking in her life? What if she had a child? What if she
      asserted herself more obviously? Was J. J. the kind of man
      to react to such methods?
    </p>
    <p>
      She conceived a plan, a very simple and pathetic plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we have a holiday this year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A holiday? How could he take a holiday? Who was to do his
      work?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid it's not possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't doctors ever take holidays?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but in my case it would mean a locum. I can't afford
      it just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her a cup to be refilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without sugar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sugar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We moderns eat too much sugar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he growing faddy? Could there be too much sugar? He
      seemed to be cutting out the sugar in other ways. She
      passed him his cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we have a day now and again in the country? We
      haven't had one--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might manage a Sunday afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, J. I'd so love it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Where would you like to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let's go down to Yatley."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. drank his tea like a man reflecting upon some
      profound problem. Yatley, yes. He had not seen Aunt Jane's
      grave for nearly a year. Was he forgetting Aunt Jane?
    </p>
    <p>
      To Yatley they went, and Kitty put on a new frock which she
      had been making for herself, and the sun shone, but J. J.
      did not notice her frock. Disappointed she might be, but
      she passed that over. Before tea at The Chequers they went
      to look at Aunt Jane's grave, only to find that the man to
      whom J. J. paid a fee of ten shillings a year to keep the
      grave tidy had neglected his job. The simple mound was
      covered with tangled, uncut grass. J. J. was angry. He said
      that he was going to hunt up the gentleman and curse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty demurred. Was her day to be spoilt?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it our fault for not coming before? Perhaps the man
      forgot. People do forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was deaf to the inner meaning of her words. He had
      not forgotten. He had been too busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Killick was able to resolve that problem for them.
      What, Tom Tranter? He had been in hospital for three
      months. The poor devil was dying of cancer. Kitty looked
      poignant. Was there to be nothing but shadow on this
      particular day?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go up to the heath, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went. They sat under the great beech tree, and J. J.
      lit a pipe. Then he drew from his pocket a small note-book
      and began to pore over it. Kitty, glancing obliquely at it,
      saw that the pages were covered with strange formulae. She
      felt that she was going to cry. Couldn't he forget his work
      for one afternoon and give his whole self to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not cry. She found a sudden, wholesome anger.
      She snatched the book away from him, and sat on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too bad. You never give me any thought now."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was greatly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you mean, Kit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it," said she, "are you so blind as all that? Don't
      you ever notice things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there anything new about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My frock."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked her over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty, very."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to have a baby. You're a doctor, and you've
      never noticed that!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a18" id="a18">18</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was wide awake. He had his arm round his wife, and
      Kitty was in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., I've been so lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was shocked. It was one of those moments when the
      hard skin of some other self was peeled from him, leaving
      him feeling raw and ashamed. Had he indeed been so blind?
      He had. And what could he say about it? It was one of those
      very simple occasions when a man can say nothing, but
      accuse himself of being a selfish, purblind fool, and with
      self-anger discover in himself strange new tendernesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit, why didn't you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Half way through that silly question he tumbled over his
      own fatuous egoism, and turning angrily kicked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you thought I should be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his voice faded off. No, there was nothing for it but
      complete confession, a humbling of himself in the presence
      of this wounded mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to forgive me, Kit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., of course. I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      They clung together, and with sudden passionate tenderness
      he kissed her wet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what a damned, self-absorbed fool I've been! Good
      Lord! Give me that confounded book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want it, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little wriggling movement, recovered the thing
      from beneath her, and gave it to him. J. J.'s arm went up.
      He flung the thing into a patch of fern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There goes the fool, J. J. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., you mustn't do that? It's got all your precious
      notes, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lot of stupid--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      She scrambled away from him, and going to the patch of
      bracken, groped for the book and found it. She came back
      with a wet yet shining face, and gave it back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's precious to me, too, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yatley Heath had been for J. J. a place of phantasy and
      romance. Always, he had had a feeling that strange things
      had happened here, and that if the veil of the senses were
      rent, or Time played tricks with you, those who were dead
      in Time might walk again. Had he not danced here naked as a
      child, piping some imaginary tune, conscious of mystery and
      the strange afflatus that sweeps your spirit into a tangle
      of sunlight and of shadow? So, on this summer day J. J. was
      moved to a simple service which might have caused the
      unregenerate to mock him. He twisted over on to his knees,
      and kneeling at his wife's feet, kissed her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit, you shall never be lonely again. I swear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do love me, darling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an ass I have been!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent over him, her arms about his head. How soft and
      warm they were! Oh, lovely emotion! How had he let it slip
      out of his life? What was life without feeling? Just a
      damned little notebook stuffed with formulae.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put up his face to her. He was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit, I must have been asleep. God, to think that one
      can--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., don't go to sleep again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do love you, J. There's nothing I don't know about
      loving."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sweet, I know now what comes first with me, and always
      will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., I'm so happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the train going home they sat holding hands, and an
      elderly couple who shared the carriage with them exchanged
      significant smiles and glances. Young lovers these in the
      spring of that lovely season. Bless them! J. J. may not
      have known it, but his face had recovered its youngness. He
      had been taken to a high place and shown his world as it
      should be. And what an arrant prig he had been to his
      patients! He held his wife's warm hand, and its warmth
      seemed to spread through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Kitty was to have a child. That both frightened and
      inspired him. Did he want a child? He did not know whether
      he did or not; all that he knew was that Kitty was to be
      treated with great tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk was seeping into their familiar little street when
      they returned. J. J. looked differently at the house. This
      was Kitty's house and home, and it was included in his new
      feeling about things. A motor-car, and a very dashing car
      for those days, was standing outside No. 6. Had the Stouts
      become car-folk? J. J., arming his wife through the gate,
      felt for his latchkey, and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone sitting in the hall heard their voices, and Dr.
      Pope's key clinking into the keyhole. It was Ethel, a
      rather scared and responsible Ethel who dashed at the door
      and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am, I'm so glad you've come back. There's a man
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was voluble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Fair scared I was. I wouldn't let him in at first. He
      came in that there car."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he tell you his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. He's in the garden. I thought I'd best sit here
      and see he didn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But J. J. was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know who it is. Very big and young and handsome, Ethel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in a way, sir, reg'lar toff, but you never know, do
      you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit, it's old Peter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pratten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter it was, prowling up and down the garden like a large
      and restless lion. He looked very brown and well, and
      somehow suggesting emotional excitement. When J. J.
      appeared on the garden steps and hailed him, Peter swung
      round and waved an arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, old man! Been here long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About an hour. Your girl rather thought I was some sort of
      flash sneak-thief. Just come up from Pollards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's Mr. Pratten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Sir Thomas Pratten, Bart. Happened a month ago.
      The old man's tickled to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to hear it. So you'll be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I suppose so. How's Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had come to the foot of the steps, and the two men
      looked at each other with amused affection. There seemed
      more glow about Peter's Phoebus-head, and his eyes
      suggested some inward flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty's splendid. You'll stay to supper, such as it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love to. But tell Kitty--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's wise, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Kitty had swept Ethel down the kitchen stairs, and
      planting a flowery hat on the dresser, had rushed to her
      store cupboard. Thank heaven, Sunday supper was not too
      thin. Cold meat and salad, and plum tart. But custard was
      indicated, and Welsh Rarebit; as college men both J. J. and
      Peter had been pigs about toasted cheese, and J. J. was a
      connoisseur. Also, coffee would be needed, and her pretty
      set of Coleport china. Kitty fluttered about, and sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get the cheese, Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you laid the table?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be for three. Is there a fire in the range?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm, for Sunday baths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, splendid. Get me the frying-pan. Is there enough
      milk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty appeared in the garden for a moment to shake hands
      with Peter and to assure both men that supper would be
      cold, yet adequate, if a little late. Peter looked at her
      with appreciation. He might be disastrously in love, and
      with someone who was unhappy, and Kitty's happy face was a
      provocation and a challenge. Peter, hands in pockets, and
      lounging beside J. J. towards the end of the little lawn,
      let fall a remark which, in its significance, was
      tentative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems a success, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, old man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your marriage, judging by Kitty's face."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., conscious of self-accusation, and feeling humbled by
      it, paused to state a tone of his wife's flower beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I hope so. Thanks to Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter also stood and stared at the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny business, marriage. I suppose, if a man's a
      rotter--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He needn't be a rotter," said J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely blind and blundering along some completely selfish
      path."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter glanced at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what if the man's a cad and a rotter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ethics. Don't ask me to pose as a parson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all that old rubbish. We're dreadful humbugs, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or spoilt children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to me much of our goody-goody business is dressing
      up the spoilt child in a nice clean Sunday frock. Sailor
      suit and white socks, and a hat with <i>Invincible</i> or
      something on it in gold letters. Mind if I have a talk with
      you after supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can smoke our pipes out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Kitty mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. I'll tell her that. Well, we've had a
      good day down at Yatley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's head seemed to rise with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yatley! Well, I'm blowed! But, of course--Know a man named
      Strange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of him. I did not move in the Strange world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you know of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing particularly good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gossip or fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact, I should imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sought out his wife while Peter was having a wash.
      Would she feel hurt if he and Peter had a pow-wow about
      something that was on Peter's mind? J. J. was so hesitant
      about it that Kitty laughed, and very gently patted his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I as exacting as all that? Of course I shan't mind, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Pope kissed his wife's fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter thinks it's a great success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our marriage. I told him it was due to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's supper was also a success. Peter might be very much
      in love with someone, but instead of spoiling his appetite,
      it appeared to stimulate it. He and J. J. exchanged glances
      over the toasted cheese. Yes, that had been Kitty's
      inspiration, and it caused Peter to become reminiscent. Did
      J. J. remember the college ball, the one at the end of
      their second year? J. J. did remember it,and that incident
      when he had watched Miss Sybil Marwood tantalise the little
      obscure and awkward boy in him. Peter was staring at his
      plate like a crystal-gazer, and both Kitty and J. J. were
      looking at Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's in love," was their mutual thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would they like their coffee in the garden? Yes. Well,
      Ethel would bring itout. Kitty effaced herself; she said
      that she was going to help Ethel with the washing-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No nonsense about Kitty," said Peter, filling a pipe
      before descending into the dark garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only beautiful nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, old man, that's a good phrase. Well, let me get it
      off my chest. I'm love with a married woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. saw it all in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the devil did you guess that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mixture of inference and inspiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter paused at the foot of the steps to put a match to his
      pipe. The littleflame lit up his face. It was not the face
      of Boy Peter, but the face of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shocked, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. How did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll tell you. The fellow, Strange, bought one of our
      cars. I did one or two trial trips with him, and he asked
      me to pilot him down to his place at Yatley. The old lady's
      dead, and Master Lawrence is a Bart. I didn't like the
      fellow. Dirty-minded brute. And when I saw Sybil--Yes, we
      danced about six dances that night, the night I was talking
      about. Smitten, somewhat. Yes, but I didn't follow it up. A
      rather frightening young woman. Well, this time it was
      different. I saw her, not as something frightening, but a
      thing that was frightened. Scared of life, if you know what
      I mean. I stayed three nights. Acute infection, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were strolling about the little lawn, and Ethel coming
      out with the coffee, looked like a lost ghost in a white
      apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do I put it, sir? I can't see, after the
      light inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it to me, Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. The milks 'ot, if the gentleman likes it
      like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two deck-chairs in the garden, shut up and
      leaning against the trunk of the pear tree. J. J. dealt
      with them, and particularly so with the one that was warped
      and had a spiteful temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try this one, old man. It doesn't play tricks. Mind the
      tray. There you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, J. J. Do you think I am a thrice damned fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For falling in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but with--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't help her being married, could you? Black or
      white?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White, since the girl was so kind as to warn us about the
      hot milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on a moment. Pouring out coffee in the twilight needs
      concentration."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was squatting over the tray which he had placed on
      the grass. What surprises life kept for you! And did Sybil
      Strange know?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sugar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are, Peter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, old man. Rather good, this darkness, for getting a
      thing off your chest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she know?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do women know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suppose that depends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean I looked it, well, I couldn't help it. And I
      asked her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To meet me in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she's going to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between them. J. J. was balancing his
      coffee-cup and groping for his chair, and remembering that
      when Peter got going he took a devil of a lot of stopping.
      But why should he be stopped?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to-day. Afraid we had something of a row. You know
      what the old man's like. Apt to be hot in the head, and
      spit things out. He said it seemed a pity that when I had
      dozens of girls to choose from I must go and fall for a
      second-hand woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather harsh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. We had it out then. But what I like about the old
      man is that there's nothing mean or slimy about him. He may
      curse you, and that's that, but he doesn't go on being
      Jehovah."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sipped his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has the baronetcy made any difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. He just chuckles about it. But what do you
      think, old man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think? One doesn't think oneself into that state. It just
      happens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely. If she--Yes, I'm going over the cliff, old
      man, if she--After all, the other fellow's a cad. Habitual
      womaniser, I gather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just that," said J. J. "That's one of the social
      savageries that need exploding. The sanctity of marriage!
      Bosh! The only sanctified marriage is the happy one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like yours, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, like mine."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Kitty was told of Peter's love-affair, as told she was
      that same night, she held her breath and her verdict. Kitty
      was not quite so emancipated as Mary Rackstraw who held
      that if a thing worked it was to be accepted, and that if
      it did not work it should be thrown on the scrap-heap. The
      young of those days were still groping towards reality, and
      though J. J. might be half a century ahead of his fellows
      in some of his views, he was chary of forcing them upon
      Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was conservative. She had a little kingdom of her
      own, and she was ready to defend it in practice and in
      theory. What, if another woman had come into her house and
      attempted to seduce her husband? Would she have been
      tolerant and complaisant and shrugged her shoulders?
      Hardly. What was precious to her was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems such a pity, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, these things happen. I don't see why one should
      perpetuate a mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Peter's so innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Innocent! Well, I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, he is. I have feelings about things, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on having feelings about them, my sweet. I'm not sure
      that intuition does not travel further and faster than mere
      logic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is logic, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One might call it the art of proving the other fellow
      wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter Pratten's romance was a mere stage-play compared
      with J. J.'s own problem. Kitty was with child. J. J. sent
      her to see a specialist, not a St. Mark's man, and the
      specialist's opinion was Kitty's. She was about two months
      gone, and a very healthy young woman, though the curious
      thing was she had not suffered from morning sickness. J.
      J., still blaming himself for his blindness, became the
      tender tyrant. Kitty was not to do this, and she was not to
      do that, and though Kitty did not quarrel with his concern,
      she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm quite well, J., really. I like doing things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know you do, my sweet, but I'm taking no chances.
      You leave most things to Ethel."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. developed a certain cockiness during those pregnant
      days. He was to become a father, and he was happy in being
      a husband, and as though to flatter him, some of his pet
      patients began to respond to treatment and show definite
      results. Joints seemed less glued up, stiffness and pain
      less irksome. Bright faces greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I really am better, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, also with some of the gastric disharmonies. Diet and J.
      J.'s new protective preparations appeared to be having a
      very soothing and curative effect upon irritable mucous
      membranes. J. J. was feeling cocky, and rather a clever
      little fellow, strutting along and brandishing the Torch of
      Science. Knowledge was the thing, knowledge and yet more
      knowledge, exploration and experiment, and the exploding of
      prejudice and theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But J. J., the cocky little fellow, was to receive lessons
      in the seemingly incalculable. You might swear that all was
      well with your world and that Science was up in the Heaven,
      and then some puckish circumstance would kick your stool
      away and leave you puzzled and sprawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed peacefully. Patients and practice appeared to
      be prospering; Kitty was carrying the new life in her with
      very little discomfort. J. J. had everything arranged with
      characteristic efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one excitement during late August. A telegram
      arrived for J. J. It was from Peter Pratten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looking in for a moment this afternoon about three. Hope
      to see you. Important."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter arrived by automobile, but he was not alone. J. J.,
      waiting in the front room, saw the dark lady of his dreams
      follow Peter from the car. The hood was up, and the back
      seat full of luggage. J. J. stood and stared. Were these
      two setting out on the great adventure?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to meet them at the door. It did not need the eyes
      of a physician to discover that these two were utterly and
      recklessly in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sybil, this is J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at the little man and her face seemed strangely
      different. It was as though the hand of a healer had passed
      over it, leaving it smooth and rich and radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to meet Peter's friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life J. J. touched her hand. A
      sudden shyness possessed him. She seemed to symbolise for
      him all that past of struggle, frustration and desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter's friends are mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a bald and sententious sentence! He felt the need of
      Kitty, Kitty with her gaiety and naturalness, to rescue him
      from his self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come in. My wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter laid a hand on J. J.'s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just five minutes. Yes, Dover. We are going over, car and
      all. France, Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had an envelope in his hand, and he passed it to J.
      J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't get down to Pollards. We came straight from
      Yatley. Keep this for me. I wonder if you could go down and
      see the old man, and say--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And say we looked happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a whirlwind visit, and in five minutes they were
      away, with Kitty and J. J. standing at the top of the steps
      to wave them off. Months were to pass before J. J. was to
      hear the full story. There had been nothing secret and
      surreptitious about Peter's intervention. He had walked
      into Hardacre House, sent a servant for Lawrence Strange,
      and in the library calmly announced the purpose of his
      presence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am taking your wife away, Strange. You don't seem able
      to appreciate her. That's all. I'll give you the name of my
      lawyer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Strange had flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, are you! And what the hell do you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better take it calmly. Come and look."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had taken Lawrence by the arm and led him to a
      window. The car was there, with Sybil seated in it, and a
      manservant was loading luggage into the back seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's final, my lad. Anything more to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can make a whore of my wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Peter had knocked him down, walked out of the house,
      and gone off with his lady.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was never likely to forget his visit to Pollards. He
      had sent Sir Thomas a prepaid wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I see you to-day about four o'clock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas' wire came back promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Expect you tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the visit, but the happenings that were to be
      bracketed with it which bit themselves into J. J.'s mind.
      Kitty came with him to the gate, a Kitty who was wise as to
      the purpose of his journey and wished him well of
      it<i>.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do try and smooth things over, J. I'm sure they are going
      to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of yourself, my sweet. No tricks, mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing to worry about, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      A car met Dr. Pope at the station, and drove him to
      Pollards. The old place was looking serene and lovely, and
      J. J. found Sir Thomas on the terrace, and if Sir Thomas
      could not be described as lovely, he did exhibit a
      formidable serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, J. J. Arriving as a deputation, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense, sir, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down. Well have tea here. Well, what have you got to
      say about my bloody fool of a son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat down and passed old Pratten Peter's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might quote my wife, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she an authority?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. She says she is sure they are going to be happy.
      Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter has a rather lovely nature. I can't see any woman
      quarrelling with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Pratten gave J. J. one of his shrewd and porcine looks.
      There were occasions when he resembled a very intelligent
      pig. He opened his son's letter, read it with complete
      deliberation, refolded it<i>,</i> slipped it back into the
      envelope and into his pocket
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look particularly miserable, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never met my wife, did you? Of course not. I always think
      of her as Lady Pratten. And she would have loved it, and
      laughed over it. That damned boy of mine is just like his
      mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, she must have been--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No soft soap, young man. Well, I suppose I knew, even when
      I lost my temper, that I should forgive the young devil. I
      suppose you've seen the lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have known her by sight for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A looker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite beautiful, sir. She and Peter are a pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he got all his mother and nothing of me. What sort of
      fellow is this Strange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rotter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why the devil did she marry him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sex is a strange--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, damn it, I know. Off with one, on with the
      other. The question is<i>,</i> will she play the same trick
      on Peter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter and the other fellow are completely different
      propositions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you are on Peter's side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea arrived and there was silence between them until
      the servant departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pour out, J. J. And just one word, if you ever want a
      friend, come to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thanks needed. If you can stick up for a friend, so can
      I."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., feeling pleased with his day's visit, opened the
      green gate of No. 5. He looked up at the front window.
      Kitty was fond of sitting there when he was out, with her
      work or a book, and since his coming back to life, J. J.
      rather expected that face at the window. Kitty was the one
      person in the world to whom he could prattle with the
      naturalness of a child and J. J. that separative creature,
      was developing the habit of perching and chirping to his
      mate. He saw a face at the window, close to it, and it was
      Ethel's face. It disappeared with a suddenness that somehow
      suggested that a scared Ethel had been waiting for him. She
      had. She opened the front door before J. J. had put his key
      into the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, I'm so glad you're back. There's been a
      h'accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. went cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Pope fell off the step-ladder. She would get up it to
      put up a new valance."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. pushed in past Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got 'er to bed, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she broken anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. It's inside, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you send for anyone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, she said she'd rather wait for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. thrust his hat at Ethel and went up the stairs at a
      run. If there was any conflict within him between anger and
      a frightened tenderness, it was the latter that held him.
      Kitty was in bed and lying on one side, her face towards
      the door, and it did not need the physician in J. J. to see
      that she was in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., I'm so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently he closed the door, and going to the bed, bent down
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling, you shouldn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't think how it happened. I was just leaning over a
      little--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind now. Where's the pain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here. I'm afraid--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any bleeding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was worried. Any old woman could have told him what
      the trouble was, and he did not need the telling. He was
      aware of his wife's face puckered with pain and emotional
      distress. Kitty was going to miscarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., does it mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so, darling. But we'll try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., how terrible of me! It means I've killed our--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her arms, and writhed, and her
      anguish was both physical and spiritual. J. J. was
      profoundly moved. Sitting on the side of the bed, he bent
      over her, and gently drew her arms down from her stricken
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, darling. It may be all right. And even if it
      isn't, all that matters to me is you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold me, J., I'm frightened. I've done such a terrible
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I have. You know I didn't mean it<i>,</i> don't
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling, such a thought would never enter my head. Now,
      lie straight and quiet, as quiet, as you can. Just give up
      and leave things to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. spoke confidently in order to soothe her, but the
      doctor in him was all too wise as to the chances of saving
      that other life which was theirs. He did all that a man
      could do, but in the small hours Kitty gave birth to a five
      months' child, and all that J. J. cared about was the
      safety of the mother. Nature, when frustrated or interfered
      with, is prone to play spiteful tricks upon humanity, and
      though J. J. may not have shown it, he was frightened as he
      had never been frightened before. Had he followed his own
      impulses he would have called in his very enemies in this
      crisis, but he did send for the gentleman who had promised
      to attend Kitty as her accoucheur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, looked sympathetic and solemn, examined Mrs. Pope
      and everything that needed examining. His opinion was that
      there need be no danger and no complications. The danger,
      as he put it, was much more likely to be psychological.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad luck, Pope. No, I think she ought to do all right.
      Everything has come away, and there's been no signs of
      bleeding. Your wife's a fairly cheerful person, I take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Well, my advice is, try again."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was in no mood for further adventures in pregnancy,
      and said so, but his very senior confrere read him a little
      homily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's all very well, but I have known these affairs
      shock a woman rather badly. Emotional reactions. Such a
      thing may make her feel rather a failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stood looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. That aspect of it hadn't struck me. I dare say you
      are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, see how things go. If you're worried about anything,
      ring me up. The sooner a woman gets back to normality, the
      better."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s immediate fears were not to come to fruition. No
      complications arose, and in a fortnight Kitty was up and
      about, but it was a different Kitty. Some of the bloom and
      the gaiety had gone from her. She was more silent, slower
      in her movements, and even her voice had a gentle
      lassitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. watched her and was worried. Did she need a tonic? He
      tried her on iron, quinine and strychnine, but that which
      was drooping in her did not respond to drugs. J. J. was
      moved to wonder whether women did not take life differently
      from a man, and whether there were not all sorts of
      subtleties in sex of which he was ignorant. But J. J. had
      learned his lesson, if the positive and lusting male is
      ever to learn it<i>,</i> that though you may be tempted by
      strange women, and naturally so, in spite of the pietists,
      there may be only one woman in the world with whom you may
      wish to share all the intimate contacts of living together
      in one house.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was very gentle with his wife. They were sharing
      their troubles together, and under such a regime tempers
      either wear thin or grow more rich and tolerant. The new
      and rather languid Kitty touched J. J. to tenderness more
      than the mere gay child-woman had done. Maybe the physician
      in him was learning that man is not made well by drugs
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like you to have a change, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather be with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sea-air. I'm going to send you down to Ramsgate or
      Cromer for a change, before the winter comes in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, because I think it will do you good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I'll go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty chose Ramsgate, and J. J. took her down in person and
      settled her in the best of Ramsgate's hotels, with its
      windows on the sea. When it came to leaving her, he did not
      like it<i>,</i> nor did she. They clung together for a
      moment in her small bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., must I stay a whole fortnight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Think how I shall want you back, and how good it will
      be. Get out in the air, and eat like a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a what, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little pig."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've felt such a failure, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will never be. If you feel like it well try
      again."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a20" id="a20">20</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had other things to worry him. While Kitty was away
      he looked into their finances, and this audit compelled him
      to accept the fact that the expenses of research and of his
      clinic were absorbing most of the profits of his private
      practice. He and Kitty were living very simply, but, with
      the domestic budget added to his professional expenses he
      discovered that he had no margin. Actually, there was a
      small deficit, and even such an item as Kitty's holiday
      would have to be met out of capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could he do about it? Rent and rates could not be cut.
      As for asking Kitty to manage with less money, that was an
      economy he could not bring himself to accept. He was not
      capable of such meanness to the one person who mattered. If
      there had to be economy it behoved him to make it in person
      by limiting the money he spent upon his financially
      unproductive work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if Kitty wished to repeat her experiment in
      motherhood could he deny it to her? A child would entail
      additional expense, but he had not forgotten the words of
      his confrere. "Starve a woman of certain things, and she
      will be ill because she is unhappy." J. J. sat and looked
      at his ledger. No, if Kitty wanted her child, she should
      have it. The urge in her might be more valid than his
      dabbling in disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other worries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other doctors who were in partnership and who could
      claim to possess the most lucrative and respectable
      practice in the neighbourhood had taken to themselves a
      third partner and planted him in Chellwood Place, almost
      immediately opposite No. 5. Was this a hostile and
      competitive gesture? Did it suggest that these older men
      proposed to squeeze out the Squatter? It might be so.
      Moreover, the new young man was everything that J. J. was
      not. J. J. met him in the street, big and blond, with hard
      blue eves that stared at you insolently. These two young
      men did not acknowledge each other. Dr. Charlie Steel was a
      type which had become very familiar to J. J.; it had looks,
      manners that could be over-mannered, clothes that were
      above criticism save that they might be described as
      flashy. The Steel type was conventional yet quarrelsome,
      limited in outlook but aggressive in its opinions, stuffed
      with clichés, and with prejudices against things that were
      not done. That they disliked each other, even in silence,
      was natural. Dr. Charles Steel looked down at Dr. Pope like
      a stupid and full-blooded young Viking passing a
      Mediterranean monkey in some Latin street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Dr. Steel owned a small car and a wife, a very
      decorative young woman, a suburban flower with cornstalk
      hair, china blue eyes, and a voice that was throaty. Such
      rivalry would put the Pope <i>ménage</i> in the shade, and
      make it look like sixpence beside half-a-crown. And in a
      world that judged things by their appearance, and preferred
      well-pressed and distinguished-looking trousers to baggy
      ones, the Steels might prove a very real menace to J. J.'s
      precarious position.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had heard a cynical elder deliver himself of a piece
      of professional wisdom. "Try to remember that private
      practice wears petticoats. Please the women, and especially
      the mothers by patting the heads of the dear little
      children, and you will be the beloved physician. Men don't
      matter in the nursery. Get the nursery, and you will be
      pretty safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, J. J. long ago had confessed to himself that he was
      not a success with children. Somehow, he did not impress
      them. He could not play the hearty-humbug, pay court to
      Irene, or bump Baby Joan on his knee. That, again, was one
      of his limitations. He was more concerned with the sickness
      than with the child. The little egoists and savages among
      them made his secret and sensitive self become consciously
      critical. Maybe he was a little afraid of children, and the
      young beggars are devilish quick at spotting a victim. Some
      of them were ready to mock him as the rude children mocked
      Elisha, but J. J. could not call upon convenient bears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was otherwise. Actually, he did not care a damn
      about other people's children, and he and his corn-stalk
      wife had agreed to refrain for a while from peopling a
      nursery, but Charlie Steel had a breezy and buccaneering
      wav with the kids, and he was gallant to their mothers. As
      a professional gentleman he found the restraints upon
      vicarious sex somewhat irksome, but being a very vain young
      man he allowed his patent provocation of the other sex to
      flatter and console him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this potential rivalry was, for the moment, mere dust
      in the sunlight. J. J., trotting about on his little legs,
      was counting the days. Kitty was coming back to him, a
      Kitty who desired a child, and Kitty had brought to life
      the man in her husband. His desire was to give her a child.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. met her at Cannon Street. Funds might be low, but
      there were occasions when pure economy should go to blazes.
      It so happened that Kitty's compartment stopped just where
      J. J. was waiting on the platform. He saw his wife at the
      window, a Kitty who was the Kitty of the old days, douce
      and joyous and jocund. There were sparkles in her dark
      eyes, and the cream of her skin had recovered its bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J.! It's an omen."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned out, put her arms round his neck, and he kissed
      her, and it was not a husband's kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling better? You look it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you're lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      To be wanted in this way was better than sea air or a
      tonic. He opened the door for her, and his eyes could not
      leave her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's your trunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the front, I think . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well take a cab to Chelsea, and another one back to
      Frascati's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., ought we to? I've been such an expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're worth it. Give me your bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very happy home-coming, though Dr. Charles Steel
      did chance to come out of his gate while they were leaving
      the cab. Dr. Steel paused to stare. Certainly, Mrs. Pope
      was a looker, and though he had married a pretty blonde, he
      was finding other women provocative. And how had a saucy
      bit like Mrs. Pope managed to marry that little bun-head
      with the didly legs? Sex was a funny business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had to go all over the house, and J. J. went with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, it's lovely to be back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's lovely to have you back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd better unpack, hadn't I? Then we'll be free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't Ethel do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'd rather do it. I hope she's been looking after you
      properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I change my frock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look rather pretty in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I? How nice to be told--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you need telling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's nice to be told."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Frascati's J. J. did a thing he had never done before;
      he ordered a bottle of champagne. Certainly, it was only a
      half-bottle, and of a fairly recent vintage, but the
      gesture pleased his wife. She sat with her elbows on the
      table, and her chin cupped in her hands, and looked at him
      with velvet eyes. In those days young gentlewomen, amateur
      or otherwise, were not supposed to put their elbows on the
      table, but J. J. liked his wife's pose. It was so easy,
      unpremeditated and natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've only drunk champagne once before."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. also put his elbows on the table, and his eyes were
      level with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll call this the second edition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But nicer, don't you think? One's not so shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked it for the moment, and gave a little laugh, and
      her eyes caressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, much nicer," said J. J., "no apologies needed."
    </p>
    <p>
      A waiter with two plates of soup and an "Excuse me, madam"
      parted those clinging glances. Dr. and Mrs. Pope smiled and
      sat back and picked up their soup spoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather like one of the ten commandments, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou shalt not look lovingly in public at thy wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., people will hear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not really."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It took more than a year to convince them that Nature,
      having been outraged by Kitty's carelessness in climbing a
      step-ladder, refused to give them a second child. To J. J.
      it was no great sorrow, but in Kitty this sterility seemed
      to rankle. That which she desired she desired and this
      frustration depressed her. J. J. took her to see a very
      eminent specialist who diagnosed a certain condition, and
      suggested a particular line of treatment. Kitty went into a
      nursing-home for a fortnight and was operated upon, and
      came home to Chellwood Terrace full of hope, but barrenness
      remained her portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sad about it, so strangely sad that J. J. paid a
      visit to his specialist friend and asked for further
      counsel. There was an awkward moment between them when
      Harley Street asked Chellwood Terrace a particular
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Pope, but I am going to be frank with you. Are
      you sure it is your wife's fault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her fault? You mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the alternative, isn't there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it might be mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man nodded, and J. J. flushed up, and then
      suddenly went pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She had one child, you know, so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you care for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thanks. I can examine my own potency, if I want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, J. J. went forth hot and uncomfortable. Even your
      philosopher may feel peeved when his maleness is
      questioned. J. J. took steps to test the truth of it, and
      if those little active bodies seen under the microscope
      satisfied him, it was not so with Kitty. Planted in her was
      that sad weed, a sense of failure, and she brooded upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Mrs. Steel across the way had produced, owing to
      some slip in technique, the very thing she did not desire.
      A very lusty infant was wheeled out daily from the Steel
      doorway, and sometimes the mother deputised for the
      nursemaid. Kitty, sitting at the window, would bow her head
      and lower her eyes when that pram appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, not only did the Steel world tantalise Kitty; it
      was threatening J. J. himself with competitive effacement.
      His private practice was falling off. There was no doubt
      about it. And why? Dr. Charles Steel might be popular. He
      was more like the people he doctored, and J. J. was not.
      During those rather sad months J. J. Pope was moved to
      question his rightness as a physician. Was he cut out for
      the job? It seemed that he was not. He could and did
      confess that some essential bond of sympathy was lacking.
      He was a student to whom cases were cases, and signs and
      symptoms scientific data. Pain was a puzzling phenomenon to
      be studied. Why--pain? What happened when you gave a
      patient morphia? He did not know. But what he did begin to
      know was that pain was to him a symptom to be studied and
      not just human anguish to move you to sympathy. Did he lack
      humanity? Was he sinning against humanity in pretending to
      heal it, when his essential self hastened to shut itself up
      in a laboratory? Was he travelling in the wrong train, and
      would that train get him nowhere? He had no one to speak to
      of these things. Kitty would not understand. That was his
      illusion. He too was a failure. He began to suffer from
      that most terrible of obsessions, the loneliness of genius
      that is baffled.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Ethel, who was walking out with a baker's
      roundsman, decided to get married, but Ethel was a good
      girl and promised not to leave until Kitty had engaged a
      successor. Mrs. Pope applied to the agency which had
      supplied her with Ethel, but "Generals" seemed short at the
      moment, and Mrs. Pope was told that she might have to wait.
      A month passed without result, and then, a distressed Ethel
      confessed to her mistress that the need was urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, ma'am, if I get married now, it won't look so
      bad, will it? I mean, if Tom and I 'ave been married eight
      months when the baby arrives, it may look quite natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was a little shocked, but full of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you must get married, Ethel. I can manage till
      the new girl comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've always been very good to me, ma'am, and what I says
      is it's 'elping those as 'as 'elped you. I could ask Tom to
      let me come in and do a few hours--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom is your concern now, Ethel. I know I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you ever so much, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Ethel was married to her roundsman, and Kitty carried
      on. Moreover, it so happened that J. J. let fall one of
      those unfortunate remarks about economy which may slip from
      a man's mouth, but Kitty took it to heart. Economy! She
      carried on, telling herself that so long as she was
      maidless, a third person would not have to be fed or paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was not so blind as to fail to notice the absence of
      domestic help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When's the new girl coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not one to be had at the moment. I can manage,
      J."
    </p>
    <p>
      After all Kitty was only doing what hundreds of thousands
      of working women were doing, and she had no children to
      wash and cook for and send to school, and J. J. had worries
      of his own. It may have provoked him to know that the
      Steels possessed three maids, a housemaid, a nurse and a
      cook, but Dr. Steel's quarter share in a prosperous
      practice rendered him fairly secure. J. J., footing it in
      all weathers to visit the few private patients he did
      possess, began to see failure chalked up on pavements and
      walls and grinning at him from street lamps. Even his
      beloved clinic was becoming an incubus in the matter of
      expense. Either he would be compelled to charge these poor
      people more, or close the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to raise his fees, and within a month the number
      of patients attending his clinic has fallen by a half. Oh,
      damn money! All he asked for was peace and security and the
      chance to follow his urge without being pestered by the
      petty problems of finance. In an enlightened and
      well-regulated world the accredited searcher and inventor
      would be sponsored by the state, and given the right to
      pursue other things than profit. Profit might be a test of
      efficiency among those who had to trade, but it could be
      mere superstition to those few who were the pioneers of a
      new order. If J. J. had been put in a corner and catechised
      by some super-intelligence he would have confessed that his
      ideal was to remain an individual in a community that was
      planned for by the wise and the humane. J. J. had no wish
      to be a eugenised super-slave in a card-indexed crowd. He
      was still something of a mystic despite his shabby worries.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was being made aware of other and actual shabbiness. His
      umbrella needed recovering. His top-hat had lost its gloss,
      and his trousers showed signs of becoming frayed.
      Appearances were so important! The world did not look under
      your hat for the ability it might cover; it looked at your
      hat, and if it was shabby, you were damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But J. J. was still blind to certain things. Kitty slipped
      out of bed at some unholy hour, and her excuse was the
      housework. It had not occurred to J. J. to wonder how the
      steps of No. 5 were kept so white. A man may go up and down
      such steps in a state of worried preoccupation that
      transcends such trivialities. Kitty was out, cleaning those
      steps at an hour when she hoped that Chellwood Place would
      not observe this unseemly labour, but observed she was, and
      the information spread. Mrs. Steel's housemaid saw the act,
      and Mrs. Steel was told.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She cleans the steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, haven't they a maid yet, Bessie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, how disgraceful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Steel passed on the news to her husband at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy a doctor's wife cleaning her own steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mean little tyke! He looks it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps they can't afford--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite likely. I should say that the little blighter's in
      Queer Street. Can't be doing much. Little cranks like that
      don't cut much ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think it's most undignified."
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt it was, in rather a stilted and stuffy period of
      English history. The whole neighbourhood came to know that
      Dr. Pope allowed his wife to clean and stone the front
      steps. Mr. Percy Stout, who had suffered from no further
      attacks of acute gastritis, became sentimental and changed
      his opinion of Dr. Pope. Fancy letting a pretty little lady
      like that clean steps, and after a miscarriage too! Mr.
      Stout was indignant. Pope did not deserve to possess a wife
      of such quality. J. J., meanwhile, was quite ignorant of
      all this gossip, and he might have remained in ignorance
      had he not come downstairs a little earlier than usual, and
      seen the front door open, and Kitty on her knees with
      bucket and swab.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was both touched and shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit! I didn't know you were doing that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at his solemn and shocked innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like them to be white."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been doing it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, since Ethel left."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was conscious of swift self-accusations. He had not
      noticed those steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to have you doing this. We must get a new
      girl at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do. Pass me that swab. I'll finish the things off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty straightened and stiffened on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you can't, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, a doctor can't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, if you can do it, I can. You go in and leave it
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was utterly determined about it. He took off his
      coat, relieved her of the bucket and swab, and almost
      pushed her into the house. Damn Chellwood Terrace, damn a
      snob world that forgot that Kings had washed the feet of
      beggars! Dr. Pope finished the job, and refused to feel
      humble about it. In fact, as he wrung out the swab, he
      stood and faced Chellwood Terrace like Ajax defying the
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was all over the place that same day. Dr. Pope had
      been seen washing and whitening his front-door steps!
    </p>

    <h1>
      <a name="a21" id="a21">21</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Hence--Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen was the sister of one of J. J.'s patients, a ruddy,
      roundabout little woman in the early forties, with massed
      plaits of brown hair and a merry eye. Ellen had finished
      with one place, and was taking a holiday while looking
      round, for Ellen was a very independent person, and never
      in a hurry. She was one of those cheerful, rhythmic people
      who get through an amazing amount of work without any great
      appearance of activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had done Ellen's sister much good, and when J. J.
      asked Kate if she happened to know of a maid, Kate said:
      "Of course, why there's Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      But J. J. had to be made to understand that Ellen was very
      much an individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her motto was "At my time of life I go where I like and
      when I like," which was a good text for such a treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen's other name was Tribute. She paid tribute only where
      she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps your sister would come and see Mrs. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She might, doctor. I'll ask her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen came, saw, and liked. She and Kitty somehow fell for
      each other in the first five minutes. Kitty talked to you
      as though you were a human being and a friend. Ellen was
      shown the kitchen and her bedroom. She liked to be
      comfortable, and she liked her food.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have what we have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      For, whatever worries life might produce in the economic
      sphere, Kitty could never bring herself to feed the kitchen
      on the dining-room's leavings. She loathed that sort of
      meanness, and J. J. loathed it with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coming of Ellen made a considerable difference in the
      régime of No. 5. Ellen was an excellent cook, but also she
      was a hearty eater, and Kitty's bills began to increase,
      for Ellen was not a lick and a scrape cook. She was melted
      butter. Yet how could you tell a woman like Ellen who was
      so capable and good-tempered that funds were low and that
      extreme economy was necessary. Ellen brought Kitty both
      solace and worry. She was spared much housework but given
      more problems to carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Ellen's fourth week Kitty realised that she had not
      enough money to pay the weekly bills. What should she do
      about it? Tell poor J. or let the bills run, or try to
      borrow? And from where? She had nothing of her own to sell,
      and never in her life had she entered a pawn-shop. Kitty's
      forehead began to carry a little and perpetual frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided to let the bills run. Things might improve,
      though at the moment she suspected that J. J. had not more
      than six patients on his visiting list. She threw out
      apologetic hints to Ellen. Could they manage with a little
      less butter and lard, and make the meat go further, and the
      coal last longer? Kitty did not yet know her Ellen, or that
      Ellen was not blind to the trouble in another woman's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I could, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, we have to be careful. My husband's practice is
      new."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen was rolling out pastry. She had gathered from her
      sister and from others that Dr. Pope gave more than he got
      from the poorer patients who attended at his clinic, and
      Ellen's wisdom and sympathy were real.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want you to go short, Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen had appreciated the absence of kitchen parsimony and
      the lack of meanness that lay behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen co-operated, and the bills decreased. Kitty paid the
      grocer, the milkman, the baker and the greengrocer, but she
      decided to let the butcher wait. The butcher was, on the
      surface, such a polite, ruddy, affable person, and Kitty
      believed that he was more human and complaisant than the
      others. She was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butcher might be a ruddy and jocund person to his
      paying patrons, but he liked his accounts settled
      regularly. Moreover, Dr. Pope's financial position did not
      inspire great confidence, and the butcher posted the bill
      to Dr. Pope in person, with a polite demand for its
      settlement. J. J. opened the envelope at breakfast. It was
      his only letter, and it seemed to put him in such a state
      of silent preoccupation that Kitty was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything important, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated, emptied his coffee cup, and then passed
      her the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's face went all puckered. So, the secret was out, and
      in trying to spare J. J. such worries, she had exposed him
      to this insult, for that was what she felt it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., how horrid of the man. I've paid all the other
      bills, but this had to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not enough money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite, but I've talked to Ellen, and we are cutting
      down some of the expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was feeling for his pipe and looking thoughtful. One
      thing he had noticed, that Kitty's appetite appeared to
      have fallen off. Had she been going short in order that
      he--Damn it, he could not have her starving herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll settle this, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., I'm so sorry. I just didn't want you to be worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked at her with strange tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I share in the worries, Kit? It's I who ought to be
      sorry. Look here, you mustn't scrape too much. I can cut
      some expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind; I'll see to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Dr. Pope closed his clinic, and Kitty did not know of
      it until she happened to pass that way and saw that her
      husband's name had been painted out, and that the premises
      were to let. She was so shocked that she stood and stared
      at the notice. She wanted to weep. It was as though J. J.
      had had to sacrifice the thing that was most precious to
      him, just because he had a house and a wife. She crept home
      feeling ashamed, and that the whole of Chellwood Terrace
      must know that her husband was a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought stung her. She rebelled against the suggestion.
      J. J. shouldn't be a failure. It was this silly world which
      failed to understand that Dr. Pope was not like other men.
      She climbed the steps and opened the familiar door. She did
      not call to her mate, but went in search of him, and found
      him, as she had expected, in his improvised lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., you shouldn't have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done what, my sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Given up the clinic. Oh, J., I feel it's all my fault. Why
      didn't you tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and put his arms round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because you would have wanted me to keep it on. It
      has served a purpose. I've got my material. And I managed
      to get rid of the lease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you miss it terribly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. lied to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. And we'll be better off. That damned butcher
      can send us sirloin and sausages and kidneys every day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and took her face between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you fatter. Not eating enough. That won't do."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Two people who came to the house about that time both saw a
      change in its occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Pratten, dashing through town on one of his
      exhibition stunts to parade a new model before a Royal
      Personage, pulled into Chellwood Terrace, and rang the bell
      of No. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen opened the door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Dr. Pope in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, I'm lucky."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen showed him into the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pratten. Peter will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A patient, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look like one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen crinkled up her nose at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. I can't say you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed the stairs and knocked at the lab. door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Mr. Pratten, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. got off his stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask him to come up, Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      To come suddenly upon a familiar face after not having seen
      it for many months may provoke a mutual scrutiny which may
      reveal the more sensitive changes in the other self. To J.
      J. Peter was the same Peter, the young lion, tawny and most
      obviously the king of his own world, but to Peter J. J.
      looked shabby, like one of those sad English summers that
      have seen no sun. The texture of him seemed different.
      There was a tiredness, a tinge of bitterness in his voice.
      That mordant mouth of his looked more ironic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, old man. Kitty's out. No need to ask after the
      Pratten health."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed, but his laughter covered a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I as brazen as all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the old cane chair with its faded cushions
      which was sometimes Kitty's, and J. J. returned to his
      stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smoke. I'm afraid I haven't got any cigarettes. I don't
      smoke the darned things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then have one of mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be sardonic. Well, how's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life. Pretty good. That sweet lad Strange has got his
      divorce. Next month Sybil and I sacrifice to the
      conventions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some things seem so superfluous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. One has to conform, to a point. How's
      the work going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave a little twisted smile as he filled a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact is, old man, I don't think I'm made to be a G.P., or
      even a physician. Not enough soft soap. Too many prickles.
      And I don't love my neighbour as I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter lighted his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always were separate. Research, really, is your job, J
      J. Pure science."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pure penury."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's head lifted sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not quite as bad as that. I'm pretty tough, in my own
      way but life isn't all self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Kitty. There may be all sorts of things you want to
      give to a certain person, and pure science doesn't run to
      that sort of self-expression. There can be a shabbiness
      about life that makes one angry. I don't like feeling
      apologetic towards my butcher."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat smoking and looking at his own feet in their
      well-polished brown shoes. Explosive little person, J. J.!
      If you suggested a loan he might scarify you. Besides, that
      sort of pride had to be treated delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't there alternatives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you remember my suggesting years ago, that the pater
      might find you useful. Now, don't fly off the deep end. I
      had ideas myself till the petrol engine got me. A man like
      the pater never sits still."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was frowning, but attending.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the Pratten Pill idea. I think the old man is rather
      sick of P.P. Something more basic and gentlemanly. Floating
      a show that would put useful products on the market, a kind
      of private pharmaceutical concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like Hallows and Wellborn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes. Quite clean business. You don't send out fakes,
      but new stuff that has been tested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the firm's private lab."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. seemed to huddle up on his stool with his teeth
      clenched on his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an idea, but not for me, I should be defrocked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, not a damn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind if I sound the old man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit, but not on my account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be such a Lucifer. Do yon think I'm out to
      patronise?" J. J. grinned at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better not."

    <p>
      Mary Rackstraw saw things otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Kitty, not as J. J. saw her, but almost with the
      impersonal eyes of a stranger. Kitty looked older, thinner,
      with little lines of strain on her forehead, and yet, when
      you analysed the situation, what serious reason was there
      for worry? The Popes were not starving; they had a
      comfortable home and a comfortable maid, and they appeared
      happy together. Young people might expect struggle, and be
      the better for it, and if J. J. dreamed of being a Sir
      James Paget there was plenty of time for that yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Kitty grieving for the loss of her child, and the
      absence of any signs of a second? Was J. J. feeling balked,
      and troubled about the future? Mary had the sense not to
      ask such questions, nor did she blurt out to Kitty: "My
      dear, how thin you look. Quite wretched."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mary Rackstraw was a woman who was growing wise, to the
      extent of becoming a mystic. She lived by serving the
      vanity of other women, or that, in her ironic moments, was
      how she phrased it. Mary was to traverse the red season
      when the material needs of humanity seemed to bleed like
      open wounds, and to emerge from it with other wisdoms. A
      day would come when she would say to herself; "Supposing
      one has given them everything, houses, fur-coats,
      champagne, oysters, silk stockings, motor-cars, what then?
      Will they be any happier? Will they not be like children
      with too many toys? Concentrate upon material things, and
      they will become mud. It is the spirit that makes alive.
      When faith in some Otherness is dead, and the world is a
      glorified pig-trough full to the brim with super-swill,
      what then? When God goes, War enters in. Children will
      quarrel, not over the mere toys, but because they are
      bored, and some divine urge is denied them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in the future Mary was to say "Take the too many toys
      away from them. Put them back in the nursery with an old
      rag doll and a woman who can tell them fairy stories. When
      man becomes too clever and too much a spoilt little prig,
      he is nearer to being a devil than a god."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was troubled about both of them, but more so about
      Kitty. J. J. gave her the impression of being older and a
      little shabbier both in clothes and his philosophy, but
      Kitty had lost her bloom, which was sad. Mary could not say
      that she looked ill, but faded and droopy. Yet, again, how
      few women of the people retained their bloom; it was, in a
      sense, a luxury product, and if Kitty looked a little
      haggard she was but a sister of the majority. Mary had
      never had any looks, and yet she had not been jealous of
      Kitty. Kitty's prettiness had seemed part of a douce and
      loveable nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor could Mary Rackstraw detect any disharmony between
      these two. J. J. might appear rather casual and absent and
      clouded, but he looked at Kitty with eyes of kindness and
      affection. But how much did he see, or would he allow
      himself to see it? And did it matter? Mary understood that
      when the passion passed out of such a relationship, its
      place was taken by a more profound and lasting love, an
      almost sacred comradeship consecrated by understanding and
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had one or two half hours alone with J. J. and some
      snatches of conversation in which the personal element was
      concealed in the impersonal attitude of both. If J. J. did
      express views upon science and research, and the
      professional world and economics, it was as a dispassionate
      critic. He would not suffer emotion to enter into his
      analysis. As for Mary, had she been the ordinary, female
      egoist who dresses up jealousy and malice in the duty of
      interference, she might have taken it out of J. J. for
      taking Kitty away from her, by pretending to be concerned
      about Kitty's loss of flesh and of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have said "Have you noticed anything? I mean, I
      don't think Kitty is looking at all well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she been so minded she could have got Dr. Pope with
      both barrels, and chuckled in secret when she saw him
      wince. Good women are such adepts in the use of emotion,
      and in assuming a distress that may act as secret poison,
      but Mary was not a good woman. She did not suffer from the
      dreadful complacency of her class.

    <p>
      The winter too was to be dreadful, dreary and wet and grey,
      with dark dawns and sodden shabby twilights. Always, the
      pavements seemed to be wet, and boots and trousers sodden.
      It was cold too with a raw and acrid coldness, and when it
      did not rain, there was fog. Such weather should have
      enlarged Dr. Pope's practice, but it did not. Half the
      world might be coughing, and indulging in sore throats and
      suffering from influenza, but J. J. did not function more
      actively. It seemed as though the neighbourhood had
      labelled him as a shabby and sunless little person. It
      preferred the hearty humbug and high colour of a Charlie
      Steel. Dr. Steel appeared to be terribly busy. He drove off
      early in his small car, dashed back to lunch and dashed out
      again. And at nights his car would be waiting for him, its
      yellow eyes dimmed by the rain or blurred by fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November No. 5, Chellwood Terrace developed flu. Kitty
      was the first to go down with it, and Ellen followed,
      leaving J. J. to function alone. The two women were still
      in bed when J. J. himself developed a temperature, which
      was disastrous. He had patients to attend and the elements
      of the housework to do, light fires, heat milt, clean his
      own boots, and feed himself, mostly on cheese, tinned meat
      and fruit. He carried on for a day, one of those dastardly
      days when a north-east wind blows sleet in your face, and
      then nature rebelled. He staggered home and collapsed on
      the sofa, and felt so deadly sick and cold that he dragged
      a rug off the floor and covered himself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something would have to be done. But what? His head ached
      to cracking point, and when he tried to get up, he was
      overcome by acute nausea and giddiness. God, what a mess!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Ellen who saved the situation, an Ellen who was
      challenged by the silence of the house, and who dragged
      herself up to explore. Going downstairs in slippers and an
      old dressing-gown she found Dr. Pope <i>hors de combat</i>
      on the sofa, collarless and wild of head, and physically
      incapable of making any effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ellen looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, sir; it's you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you get help in, Ellen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daren't go out, sir. You ought to be in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you find me some aspirin. I'll take a dose and then
      get upstairs. Is the spare-room bed made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. But there are blankets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had his aspirin and some warm milk, and when the drug
      had eased his head, he managed to get upstairs, take off
      his outer clothes, and slip in between blankets in pants
      and vest. Ellen, meanwhile, had an inspiration. If she
      hammered on the wall, would someone from Nos. 4 or 6 hear
      the knocking and translate it into an appeal for help? And
      which wall should she choose? Mrs. Stout did not look a
      very sympathetic person, and Ellen chose the Megby wall.
      Mr. Megby might be a dry stick, but his wife was otherwise,
      and it was Mrs. Megby who heard Ellen's knocking, and came
      to No. 5 to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Megby had not had influenza, but she was a kind soul,
      and she came to the rescue of No. 5, only to be involved in
      a squabble with her husband, who was careful and mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forbid you to go next door, Mabel. Think of your own
      family first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Megby defied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice sort of good Samaritan you'd make, George, and you a
      sidesman at St. Jude's."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had to remember his patients. The most combative
      among us surrender, as Cæsar did, when the body is sick
      with fever, and Dr. Pope suffered the humiliation of
      realising that he had no professional friend. One of his
      patients was dangerously ill with bronchopneumonia, and
      someone would have to act as his deputy. But who? Dr.
      Charles Steel? With that problem twisting in him he began
      to sweat and feel that he was sinking through the bed. If
      he asked his rivals to deputise, would those
      patients be taken from him? Professional etiquette forbade
      it, but patients can be fickle, and reconsider their
      choice. Well, what did it matter? What did anything matter?
      All that he asked for at the moment was to be left alone to
      grovel in bed. But the crisis had to be surmounted. Tottery
      and anguished he got out of bed, slipped on a dressing-gown
      and went downstairs and wrote a note to Dr. Steel, asking
      him to take over the cases and giving the names and
      addresses. Mrs. Megby was in the kitchen, warming up meat
      extract, and J. J. called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Megby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you be so very kind as to leave this letter at Dr.
      Steel's. I have patients who--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Megby came trotting up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Really, you oughtn't to have got up. Do go back
      to bed, Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. pulled himself upstairs by the hand-rail, feeling
      that he was going to be sick. He tumbled back into bed, and
      his soul surrendered itself to that blessed place. Well,
      that problem was settled. No more effort was needed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was amused. The secret vanities of Dr. Charles
      Steel were inordinate, and Dr. Pope's letter sounded so
      very humble, being the appeal of a sick man, that Dr. Steel
      became gracious. He would go and see the poor little
      blighter. As a practitioner and a rival Dr. Pope was pretty
      well finished, anyway; the popular verdict was against him.
      Psychologically Dr. Steel was a very primitive creature;
      the appeal was to his appetites, especially so to the sex
      urge, and the flattery associated with it. Dr. Steel was
      quite sure that all his women patients were in love with
      him, and no doubt some of them were so. He could hear them
      chanting "What a man!" Dr. Steel was particularly attracted
      by Mrs. Pope. Rumour had it that her little husband had
      somehow failed to give her a second child. Well, what could
      you expect from a little squit like that! Pope was
      inadequate. What Mrs. Pope needed was a real man, a Dr.
      Charles Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Dr. Steel not only visited J. J.'s patients; he crossed
      the road and rang the bell of No. 5, and was admitted by
      Mrs. Megby who was one of the firm's patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very kind of you to do all this. I have come across to see
      Pope. Yes, professionally."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Megby said that it was very kind of Dr. Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure that all of them need looking after."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My duty, dear lady. Very ugly form of flu this year. How
      is Mrs. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better. But I think she has it on her chest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel looked grave and sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so? That mustn't be neglected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the maid, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll attend to them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel began with the male member of the household. He
      sat down by J. J.'s bed. J. J. wild of hair, unshaven, with
      a foul mouth and heavy eyes, mumbled something about it
      being good of Dr. Steel to come. Sickness and its sordid
      accessories may make you feel so horribly inferior. Charles
      Steel was kind, as a school prefect can be superior and
      kind to some rather grubby little brat. He felt J. J.'s
      pulse, took his temperature, asked a few necessary
      questions, and was autocratic. J. J. was to stay there and
      not to worry. He, Dr. Steel, would take care of J. J.'s
      patients. There were seven of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My list runs into the thirties, Pope, but we'll manage.
      Now you stay put until I tell you to get up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left J. J. feeling dimly rebellious and exhausted and
      inferior. He knocked discreetly at Mrs. Pope's door and
      opened it two inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Dr. Steel. May I come in? I've come to look after you
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much more kind to Kitty. She looked very attractive
      in bed, not like that poor tousled, squalid little
      creature, her husband. Was she coughing? Yes. That must be
      seen to. He proceeded to examine her chest, and look
      concerned about it. He suggested a nurse, but Kitty
      demurred. They could not afford a nurse. Moreover, the good
      Ellen was on her feet again, if rather feebly so. Dr. Steel
      patted her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mrs. Pope, you must stay in bed. No risks, mind, I'll
      have a cough mixture made up for you and send it along.
      Light diet. I'll come in again this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty smiled upon him gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is my husband? Have you seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, he'll be all right in a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, it's a pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel went above to see Ellen, but he did not bestow
      much time on Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you'll be all right in a day or two. I'll give
      you a tonic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen did not take to Dr. Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen was the first of the household to return to work, and
      J. J. followed her example, but Kitty, who had led the
      procession, prevaricated and kept a cough and a
      temperature. Dr. Steel, who was still coming in and playing
      the charmer, began to be a little puzzled and worried. He
      could hear nothing in the chest to explain the cough and
      the temperature. Mrs. Pope might have a pretty colour, and
      Dr. Steel liked to flirt with her, but a woman who refused
      to respond either to your treatment or your fascination,
      became less interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was resenting Steel's visits, but, after all, the
      fellow had been useful and kind in a crisis, and J. J.
      dissembled his irritation. But when Steel confessed that he
      was worried about Kitty, J. J. was both angry and
      frightened, and perhaps angry because he was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect it is just after effects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she has a cough, man, and this temperature. I can't
      find any bronchitis or any area of consolidation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll listen myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd like Gates in"--Gates was the senior partner--I'm
      sure he would be willing. A very sound man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe J. J. was suffering from the irritability of
      convalescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it is necessary. Thanks, all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was huffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well, but personally, when my wife's seedy I like
      to have an impartial opinion, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite understand. But I would prefer--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel pulled on his gloves, looking offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please. Pope, I have no wish to interfere. By
      the way, are you up to taking care of your people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I'll hand over. We are run off our legs as it is.
      You'll find all of them doing well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Steel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, a professional duty, you know." And Dr. Steel
      walked out of the house and did not re-enter it, but he had
      things to say about J. J. to his wife and partners. Pope
      was an awkward and callous little beast, and it was hard on
      any woman who had married such a fellow.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was up and about again, but the little cough remained
      with her, and at night her temperature was apt to rise
      above the normal. She had a pretty colour, and her eyes
      were bright, but J. J. was worried. He could find nothing
      in her chest to account for the symptoms, and he tried to
      shrug his worry away, and to remind himself that in actual
      life the human body confounded the textbooks. The weather
      was in a less English mood, sunny and clear, with night
      frosts, and since Kitty was craving for movement and air,
      he allowed her to go out and walk by the river. J. J.
      confessed to himself afterwards that he never believed his
      wife to be dangerously ill; he was feeling the after
      effects of flu, tonelessness and depression, and all things
      seemed to build a background of worry, and Kitty's slow
      convalescence was but one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he had come back to active life to confront a future
      that was problematical. Instead of increasing with the
      winter's sickness his practice had diminished, and the fat
      kine among his patients were very few. Obviously, Chelsea
      did not desire him as a doctor, and his receipts did not
      cover the expenses of No. 5 Chellwood Terrace. What was to
      be done about it? Strike his tent and pitch it elsewhere?
      Begin all over again? and would success be any more likely?
      Or he could take a post as an assistant, or act as a locum
      tenens, but these casual and subordinate jobs did not
      appeal to him. Research would be impossible, and a wife an
      embarrassment. J. J. was troubled and depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Peter paid them one of his flying visits.
      He and Sybil were settling outside Coventry, but that was
      to be only a temporary arrangement. Peter's eyes were on
      London, and a luxury showroom in Mayfair. 'The Pratten car
      was on the market, and having helped in its making, Peter
      was becoming interested in the selling of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found J. J. looking worn and worried. Obviously, things
      were not going too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you want is a holiday, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't stress the impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this damned winter and flu. The old man had it badly.
      The locals and Harley Street haven't had much success with
      him. Left his tummy like a rag."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked happy. He was finding life good, and perhaps
      J. J. envied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm rather worried about Kitty. She still seems to be
      feeling the after-effects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send her down to Pollards for a change. Take her down
      yourself and try your luck with the pater."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't dear man me. The pater likes young things, and Kitty
      in particular. I'm going down to Pollards for the week-end.
      Let me fix it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated, and then he accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Sir Thomas won't find her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A worry? Don't be an ass. The pater likes them pretty. And
      you can suggest treatment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most unprofessional."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot. Does it matter who makes a man well? This etiquette
      business is too full of humbug."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter dashed off in his car to demonstrate its beauties and
      virtues to somebody. Kitty was out, and J. J. returned to
      his lab. and sat on his stool and meditated. He was not
      thinking of Sir Thomas Pratten and his post-influenzal
      dyspepsia. He was wondering about life in general, and a
      professional life in particular, how it seemed to crab
      effort and truss you up in a tangle of conventions. No
      doubt they were protective, but in safeguarding the many
      they could penalise the particular few.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could break away! But how could he? He was
      responsible not only for himself, but for Kitty. Did he
      regret that responsibility? Most emphatically he did not.
      Kitty was the better part of his life; he would miss her if
      she went to Pollards. He found himself wanting Kitty back
      in the house, even though she had been away from it less
      than an hour. Was that selfishness? Well, if so, it was a
      good sort of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inner man in him must have been listening for his
      wife's return. He heard the front door close, and getting
      off his stool he went to the head of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, Kit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice came back to him with the faintness of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Come down, J. I feel so faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      He dashed down the stairs to find her leaning against the
      wall. Her lips looked bloodless, and her eyelids drooped
      over dim eyes. J. J. put an arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? Did you walk too far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have done. And then my legs seemed to go funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and lie down on the sofa, Kit. You will have to take
      things easy for a while. Feel cold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      With one arm still round her he pushed the sofa in front of
      the fire, and made her lie down. He unpinned her hat for
      her, and put a cushion under her head. Then he knelt down
      to stir the fire. It was a rather miserable fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want a change, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, J.--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter has been here. I told him you hadn't yet thrown off
      the after-effects. He suggested you should go down to
      Pollards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me to, J?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes and no. I want you to be well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I do so much want to be well. I've had flu before,
      but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It didn't leave you like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let's try Pollards, if Sir Thomas asks you. We can't
      afford the Riviera or Naples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you want a change as much as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be all right. I'll take a day off and go down with
      you, if the invitation comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Come it did, and cordially so. Sir Thomas would send a car
      for them, and if J. J. could stay a night or two, so much
      the better. Old Pratten was feeling rather tired of himself
      and of his neighbours; and his digestion was completely out
      of order, nor had any of the experts had any success in
      restoring to it a sense of responsibility. Sir Thomas was
      missing Peter, and experiencing one of those seasons of
      loneliness which trouble old men with suggestions of fate
      and finality. He liked the young, especially the young who
      were vital and comely. They seemed to renew his vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. wrote a grateful letter accepting the invitation, and
      when he packed for a night at Pollards, he stowed away in a
      little old handbag two samples of his private products,
      Pepsonol and Iodol. Little did he think how the contents of
      those two bottles would affect the future.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Pollards about teatime, with a red winter
      sun brilliant amid the black beech woods, and the hills
      like grey ghosts. Old Tom was thorough even in his
      kindness, and into the car had been packed a hot-water
      bottle, cushions and two fur rugs. Kitty had travelled as
      though in bed, with a little nose poking over the rugs, and
      a hot bottle between her feet. Sir Thomas came out into the
      porch to meet them, very much old England, in riding
      breeches and gaiters, a canary-coloured waistcoat and a
      green Harris Tweed coat. His face was almost like the
      winter sun, and when J. J. saw it, the physician in him was
      moved to utter the one word "Diet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pollards might be Elizabethan in its tradition, but Sir
      Thomas had wedded the old to the new. In the great open
      fireplace of the hall logs blazed on andirons in front of a
      vast Sussex fireback, but Peter's father had installed
      central heating, and the whole house was uniformly warm, so
      that no shocks greeted you in passages or bedrooms. Old Tom
      had a saying: "I like to be warm in my bath, and I don't
      want to say brrr when I get out of it." His shrewd old eyes
      looked kindly at Kitty from their patchwork of wrinkles. He
      still had a grip, as J. J. realised when his more fragile
      hand disappeared in a large red paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tidy up first, my dear, and tea afterwards, or vice
      versa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, tea, I think, Sir Thomas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old P. grinned at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That came out pat, but we won't have too much of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had tea in what was known as the library, before
      another vast fire. Sir Thomas had bought the books with the
      house, and rarely, if ever, had he read any of them,
      especially so since two whole bays had contained
      theological works and sermons. Sir Thomas had packed all
      this "Calf" into an attic and filled the shelves with
      novels and travel books. He had all Anthony Hope,
      Stevenson, Stanley Weyman, Haggard and Conan Doyle, and
      lately he had discovered Maurice Hewlett. Hewlett was
      somewhat literary for old Tom, but he loved the colour and
      the verve of him, and such dashing fellows as Prosper le
      Gai.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. observing Sir Thomas during tea as a hypothetical
      case, noticed that he took three lumps of sugar to each
      cup, ate a round of buttered toast and two slices of rich
      plum cake. Well, at sixty-eight what did the dear patriarch
      expect? At that age you might not be able to have your cake
      and digest it. Kitty enjoyed her tea, both the toast and
      the roasting fire, but that little cough remained with her,
      and to J. J. it was a sound of vague distress. She looked
      flushed and bright of eye, and Sir Thomas' eyes twinkled at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to go and rest, my dear, between tea and dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to unpack."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said J. J. with authority: "Go and lie down, and leave the
      unpacking to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty left them, and Sir Thomas produced a box of cigars.
      Would J. J. have one? If Sir Thomas did not mind J. J.
      preferred his pipe. Very good. Sir Thomas took a cigar and
      settled down to digest that tea, but certain audible sounds
      betrayed the struggle within. Obviously, his host was not
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife looks better than I thought she would, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's still apt to run a temperature at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble with you doctors is that you know too much,
      and worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, too little."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas tried a new position in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter seems to be liking marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm very glad. By the way, he told me, sir, you
      haven't been very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas cocked an eye at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I haven't. Gastric flu. But there are other causes.
      Noticed 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much buttered toast and cake, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get along with you, you young devil. You see too much.
      Fact is, J. J., I'm bored. And when one's bored, one may
      eat too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it the first attack, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of boredom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact it is. Got everything I want; nothing
      more to want. That's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you create a new want? Some new enterprise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of one for me. Peter said something about your being
      an expert on tummies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been working on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to work on me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your own doctors, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, they haven't done me any good. One asks for
      results, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, sir, but I should be drastic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, would you! Well, carry on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, I thought you would begin on that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless you agree to diet, sir, I can't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No humbug, what! All right. Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave Sir Thomas a dissertation on diet, and his host
      listened with whimsical resignation. Starches, sugars,
      heavy puddings, too much meat, too much alcohol; all were
      under condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, my lad, and then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to try you on some preparations of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very nasty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. And horse exercise, and walking, three miles a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You damned little martinet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, or nothing, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas liked good food and he liked people who liked
      it. The Pollards' cook had been ordered to prepare a
      special dinner, turtle soup, sole, game, Christmas pudding
      and whipped cream, and some etceteras. Kitty and J. J.
      after the economies of No. 5, were very ready for the
      surprises and excellences of such a meal. But there was to
      be the sauce of humour in it. J. J. allowed Sir Thomas the
      soup, but when Eves the butler, came round with the sherry,
      J. J.'s eyes met his host's. J. J. shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas winked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, I begin to-morrow, not to-night. Yes, sherry,
      Eves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had a puzzled face, and Sir Thomas enlightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J. J. is going t0 try his skill on me. Hard-hearted brute.
      Wants to cut me off all the things I like. Now, I put it to
      you, Mrs. Pope, don't you think all this should be
      postponed till to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty smiled at him, and then at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good girl. You've got a wife who understands men, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a23" id="a23">23</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. left his wife at Pollards in the care of Sir Thomas
      and Sir Thomas' housekeeper. He had attempted to tip Mr.
      Eves, and James who had valeted him, and in both cases the
      largesse had been refused with kindly politeness. "It's a
      pleasure, sir." For, Sir Thomas had said to his butler: "If
      any of you take a tip from Dr. Pope I'll sack the lot of
      you. Pass on the information. Here is a quid, Eves; you can
      share it with James." Old Tom was liked for his bluntness
      and his humanity, and for a magnanimity that remembered the
      days of his youth when half-a-crown had been very much
      half-a-crown. The staff said of him that you knew where you
      were with the old man. Almost, Pollards was feudal.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. also left with Sir Thomas those sample bottles of the
      products of his research, with full and decisive
      instructions as to how and when they were to be taken. And
      once again he had insisted upon a rigid diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If a patient doesn't help his doctor, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, J. J., I get you. Your nice medicine won't have a
      fair chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the position, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are, I'll be a sportsman and play fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. returned to No. 5 and Ellen, and without Kitty it
      seemed a very lonely house. Yet, he was happier about
      Kitty. A fortnight at Pollards in supreme comfort, and with
      no household worries, should efface the after-effects of
      influenza. She had a tonic to take, and the tonic of his
      daily letters, for J. J. wrote to her each evening, and
      went out to post the letter before going to bed. Kitty too
      wrote daily, and her letter contained an informal health
      report upon which J. J. had insisted. He had left a
      thermometer with her, and she was to take her own
      temperature, morning and evening, and record it for him,
      and any other symptoms that were of significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s patients numbered seven, a biblical number, all
      lean kine, and he spent most of his time in the lab. He had
      taken up the study of vaccines and serum-therapy, which
      were still in a primitive phase, and bio-chemistry was to
      be one of his passions. Worry he did, for his financial
      position was sufficiently grave to cause him to think
      furiously of the future, yet, when at work in his lab. he
      could forget the problem of the paucity of patients, and
      rent, and tradesmen's bills, and his need of a new frock
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was never to buy that coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did allow himself to wonder how Sir Thomas was
      progressing with his doses of Pepsonol and Iodol. Sir
      Thomas had a supply to cover a week, and J. J. prepared a
      reserve supply of these two products. One of his problems
      was how to make Pepsonol completely bland and palatable,
      and to improve its keeping properties. Like many
      research-workers he experimented on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's letters came regularly. They were sanguine and
      happy, but she had to confess to an evening temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. ran a restless hand through his thick hair over the
      intractable nature of that rise in the body heat. What
      could be causing it? Some infection which had not yet been
      diagnosed? And then, one night, a possible cause occurred
      to J. J. and threw him into a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      T.B.? It couldn't be T.B.! He refused to believe it. Yet,
      why should it not be that devastating disease?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to bed in a panic mood, and for hours he could not
      sleep. Why had he not thought of this before, or had his
      inner self thought of it and thrust it aside into the dark
      limbo of things his secret self wished to ignore? For J. J.
      it was one of those tragic nights which he was never to
      forget. All sorts of fresh humanities were born in him, and
      blazed up into new sympathies and comprehensions. His love
      was afraid, and when a great love is afraid, man is put to
      school again in the classroom of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain realities rose up and stood beside his bed. Had he
      not been a hard young devil to his patients, a clever
      little prober, who, in exploring a wound, had ignored the
      pain and the inward anguish? Was that why, as a physician,
      he had enjoyed such poor success? He had been more like a
      clockmaker than a healer, fiddling with wheels and springs,
      and forgetting that soul-thing which kept the human
      mechanism going. J. J., turning restlessly in his
      nightshirt, became the wearer of another shirt, that of the
      self-accused penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was up in the grey of the morning after that tortured
      night. He was a man inwardly shaken. His hand was in
      sympathy with his spirit, and he cut himself while shaving.
      A little blob of cotton-wool had to be applied to the spot.
      No matter. He was going down to Pollards to see his wife.
      In this fever of fear he simply could not stay away from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two letters came by the morning post. One was from Sir
      Thomas, the other from Kitty. He opened Sir Thomas letter
      first, because he was not afraid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas wrote: "Beloved Physician. whether it is diet or
      your damned drugs, or both, I feel like a man who has been
      supplied with a new interior."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hardly thrilled to the news. With almost hesitant
      fingers he opened his wife's letter. A single sentence bit
      into his consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have begun to spit up something after coughing. I
      thought you ought to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. put a little sterilised glass stoppered bottle in his
      pocket, and set out to confront fate.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They had not expected to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was but human if he assumed that it was his
      letter that had brought Dr. Pope to Pollards. A little
      excitement over his successful treatment of an eminent
      patient was understandable, and Sir Thomas was pleased and
      flattered. J. J. driving up from the station in a hired
      cab, overtook Sir Thomas and his bailiff in the Pollards'
      drive. Sir Thomas had been going round the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, well! All right, Mercer; I'll drive on with
      Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed into the cab, and joggled J. J. with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got my letter, I suppose? Had to come and look at the old
      man. That's wonderful stuff of yours, my lad. Seemed to put
      a silk lining inside me."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. raised a smile. He had no desire to destroy the
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very glad, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jehovah, so am I. Peace, my lad, instead of feeling
      that I have a couple of ferrets fighting in a bag inside
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the house, to surprise Kitty reading
      <i>Treasure Island</i> in front of the library fire. Her
      face had a pretty flush, and her eyes were bright, and J.
      J., as her warm lips touched his, was conscious of a swift
      pang of wounded tenderness. Was this a sick woman? He
      refused to believe it. And then, after this sudden movement
      and spasm of emotion she began to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas stood watching them like a wise old dog. It
      seemed to him that J. J. winced when his wife began to
      cough, and that his eyes were frightened under a little
      bothered frown. Why that cough? Judging by Kitty's looks,
      J. J. had no need to worry. Sir Thomas, like many people,
      was prone to assume that if a face had a good colour, the
      bill of health was fairly clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was a superfluity for the moment, and he accepted
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be back in ten minutes. Something to see to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He toddled out of the room, and J. J., standing with his
      hands on his wife's shoulders, held her at arm's length and
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything in your mouth, Kit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you coughing up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I swallowed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want some. Next time you cough, spit into this
      bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced the bottle from his pocket and gave it to her,
      and he saw her eyes grow puzzled and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see if any bug is bothering you. Does that cough
      keep you awake at night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you something to soothe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him suddenly with a questioning
      steadfastness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think, J., that it is anything--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted her arms, and made himself smile, and lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I just want to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had a peculiar sense of detachment as he sat on his
      stool in his workshop and handled those glass slides and
      his staining reagents. It was some time after midnight and
      the house was very still. The light shone on the barrel of
      his microscope, and upon J. J.'s high round forehead. It,
      too, suggested a sort of serenity, the calm of the student,
      but this was no impersonal test. When those three specimens
      were mounted, stained and ready, the objective and the
      subjective came into conflict. Dr. Pope, the research
      worker, was to peer with the eyes of experience at the
      picture magnified by those lenses, but Dr. Pope the man,
      held his breath, even as the silent house seemed to hold
      its breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would he see? Pray God, not those little objects which
      he feared to see!
    </p>
    <p>
      With deft and sensitive fingers he slipped one of the glass
      slides on to the stage, adjusted the light, and turned the
      focussing wheel. He saw a little circle of light, blurred
      at first, but clearing to a white brilliancy as the
      nose-piece slid into position.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was utterly still. What did he see? Nothing of
      that which he had dreaded. The breath seemed to come out of
      him with a great sigh. Oh, thank God! He twisted the
      ratchet-wheel, removed the slide, slipped another into its
      place, put his eye to the eyepiece, focussed the specimen,
      and looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! They were there, those little, sinister, red
      rods, and as he stared at them shining in that circle of
      white light he felt a chill run down his spine. His stomach
      seemed to drop, as drop it does in sympathy with an
      emotional shock. It seemed that he could not take his eye
      from the microscope, or cease from staring at those
      terribly actual little objects. The bacillus of tubercle.
      His wife had phthisis! Slowly, he raised his head, and sat
      staring at the drawn curtains. They, too, were symbolical.
      And Kitty had made those curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of acute, inarticulate anguish. A sense of
      utter helplessness descended upon him. He just sat and
      stared. He seemed unable to think. It was as though those
      little rods had sprung out of the picture, clubbed him, and
      left him half stunned and stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done? What could be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      As a physician he knew only too well where the one hope
      lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Air, mountain air, sun. How were these things to be
      obtained in London? London in winter, raw and wet, and
      foggy! Where, in England? Clean air, sunlight. The one hope
      lay elsewhere. Switzerland, or the South Seas, California.
      Switzerland! How could he send Kitty to Switzerland? Money.
      Well, he had some capital left, and the last penny should
      go on giving Kitty her chance. And what if the disease were
      arrested? London would be impossible. She would have to
      live in clean country air. He too would have to leave
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his microscope away, put his elbows on the table,
      and covered his face with his hands. He had to think. He
      had to fight these feelings of shock and of helplessness.
      Something had to be done. He would rush off to-morrow and
      see Sir Herbert Bland, the most capable authority upon
      chests. He would take these specimens. Bland could tell him
      of the most up-to-date sanatorium in Switzerland. That
      would be the first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he would have to tell Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert Bland was kind to the frightened little man. He
      listened to the story, examined J. J.'s specimens, and
      admitted the seriousness of the case. If Dr. Pope would
      bring his wife to see him he would give her a most thorough
      examination. And the future, the prognosis? Sir Herbert sat
      back in his chair, and with the calm and leisurely kindness
      of a man who had no need to hurry, and who was great in
      reputation and in character, discussed the possibilities.
      Switzerland, yes, undoubtedly. There was a very efficient
      sanatorium at Glion, above Territet, run by Dr. Adler in
      connection with his clinic at Geneva. No, it was not too
      expensive; Swiss fees were not up to the English or
      American standard. As soon as a decision was made Sir
      Herbert would write to Dr. Adler. They were personal
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, what hope, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert was moved with compassion. He looked at this
      frightened, haggard little man, who, in this crisis had
      lost the judgment and the dispassionate poise of the
      physician. Dr. Pope had tumbled from the pedestal of
      professionalism and become man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should know, Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In thousands of cases the disease is arrested. Don't you
      remember the post-mortem room revelations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, old scars in the lungs of people who have never
      been diagnosed or treated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Bring your wife to see me, and we will go over
      the case together."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. went away, somewhat comforted. He rushed through the
      little work that was his, and caught an early afternoon
      train, lunching at the station buffet on a sandwich and a
      glass of milk. He sat in the corner of a third-class
      carriage, and rehearsed over and over again that fateful
      meeting with his wife, and how he could break the news to
      her, as he wished to break it, gently and tenderly.
      Pollards knew nothing of his coming, and J. J. walked from
      the station to save a cab fare. Money was going to be
      precious, oh, so very precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had reached the lodge gates with their red brick
      pillars upon which sat lean and angry griffins holding
      shields. Sir Thomas had a habit of making fun of those
      stone beasts; he had inherited them and their coat of arms,
      and Sir Thomas, who had dabbled in heraldry, said that he
      must have a mason in to chisel off the old stuff and carve
      the new. A Box of Pills in gold on a Field Azure. J. J. saw
      the part of Pollards before him, the rolling grassland, the
      wintry trees, oaks, beeches, chestnuts. A great sequoia
      rose like Salisbury spire towards a grey and shaggy sky.
      The old red brick and freestone of the house was partly
      hidden by the three old cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was about a hundred yards inside the gates when he
      saw a figure appear from behind the boles of a group of
      oaks. It was Kitty, and his heart seemed to turn over. How
      near was his crisis, and how different from the setting he
      had given to it! He had pictured himself breaking the news
      to her before the fire, with the lights dimmed or dead; she
      would be lying in his lap, with her head on his shoulder.
      But now, they were to meet in this great open space, under
      a cold and uncompassionate sky, two little figures in a
      landscape that was so English in its splendid sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s little legs seemed to falter. He saw Kitty pause,
      and stand still. The surprise was more hers than his. Then,
      her arm went up. She waved to him, and J. J.'s courage
      fluttered like a flag whose duty was to show itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was wearing furs. They had belonged to Mrs. Pratten,
      and had remained untouched and boxed away for years, until
      Sir Thomas, who had left his wife's room and clothes just
      as they had been in her day, surmounted the pain and the
      prejudices of a memory, and chose to give to the live woman
      that which had been so precious. He had wanted a daughter
      and a daughter had been denied him, a jolly affectionate
      kid like Kitty. Nor would his wife have minded. That was
      why the memory, even in its pangs, was somehow good. J. J.,
      watching his wife's face with its pretty colour, could
      almost disbelieve in the reality of her peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., why didn't you tell us you were coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made himself smile at her. He became aware of her
      steadfast gaze, of a questioning wideness in her eyes. Why
      did she look at him like that? Was he betraying anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., you have something to tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself flinch from the question in those beloved
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a second or two, and it was he who
      looked frightened. They were side by side now, and she took
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held fast to her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might guess. That's why--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's something about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You found something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the incredible thing happened. It was he who burst
      into tears; it was he who was weak, and whose head went
      down into her furs. She put her arms about his head, and
      for a moment there was word-silence as they stood there,
      but his weeping was convulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, darling, there. Perhaps I can guess. There was
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit--you've got--Oh, I can't say it. Something has to be
      done at once. I want to send you to Switzerland."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her arms tighten in a kind of spasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., away from you? Must I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pity was all for him. Strange courage and compassion!
      Her face had a radiance, serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., I had begun to wonder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I felt something must be--Put your face up, J., and
      kiss me. But ought you to kiss me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God, do you think I'd care?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her upon the mouth with a passionate tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to get well, my dearest one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, J., I'll get well."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="a24" id="a24">24</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the sweet and simple egoism of man! Sir Thomas Pratten
      assumed that J. J.'s unexpected visit had been prompted by
      the urge to see his patient, and neither J. J. nor Kitty
      told him the truth, at least not then. J. J. had recovered
      himself. If he had asked his wife to forgive him for being
      soflabby a fool, such emotion needed no forgiveness.
      Actually, they walked into Pollards hand in hand, both in
      the flesh and in the spirit, with poor bright, brave little
      faces. Never had they felt so near to each other as now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was knocking the billiard balls about in the
      billiard-room before tea. It was a form of exercise that
      suited him, and if for some weeks he had found himself
      fumbling his shots and getting bored and tired and peevish,
      the new inward peace had given him back his skill. He had
      just finished a break of thirty-three when Kitty opened the
      door and caught him chalking his cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Uncle Tom, J.'s here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas had appointed himself her uncle. Why be formal
      when your rather lonely old self desired affection?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul, that's pretty prompt. Admit the physician.
      Nearly tea time, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I'm just going to take my things off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right'o, my dear. Tell J. J. to come and have a look at
      his patient and see how he can put the balls away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights were on in the billiard-room, their shades
      flooding the green table and leaving the rest of the room
      in shadow. J. J. did not seek the light. A fire was
      burning, and he went and stood by the fire where his face
      would not be seen too clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let me stop your game, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was in his shirt sleeves. He gave the younger
      man one shrewd, exploratory look, and posed himself for a
      stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See me make a cannon off those two."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an easy shot, but he brought it off and when the
      balls had come to rest, he turned and put his cue away in
      the stand. His coat hung on a hook attached to the door. He
      slipped it on and walked towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much wrong with that, J. J. That's wonderful stuff of
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you are better, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, my lad. We have twenty minutes before tea, and I
      want to talk. Not only have you smoothed out my tummy, but
      you have given the old man a new idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat down in a club-chair, Sir Thomas on the sofa. He
      put his feet up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't we go into partnership, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Partnership?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, supposing I took up this stuff of yours and put it
      on the market?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know what you are going to say, unprofessional and
      all that. Well, I have been playing with the notion for a
      new enterprise, not P.P. Pills, but something more, well,
      shall we say, dignified?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like the all-over-the-world companies who market
      their own proprietary products. Own factory, own research
      expert complete with lab. That's the idea. And you would be
      our expert."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take the results of your research and market 'em. Seems
      to me, J. J., you've got hold of something damned good.
      Peter always said you were a bit of a genius. But I
      shouldn't just employ you. You'd be a partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would mean cutting the profession, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you much in love with academies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat huddled, gazing at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too cramping, eh, for a man of your capacity? If they cut
      you off the register would it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat like Rodin's 'Thinker." How was Sir Thomas to
      know that this temptation had an emotional eloquence.
      Money, money to give Kitty her best chance; money,
      security, the opportunity to follow his urge! He put his
      head in his hands and tried to think. After all, what would
      he be surrendering? A shabby and unsuccessful practice in a
      London suburb. And the larger issue? If he was to be
      defrocked, it would mean that his Elders regarded him as a
      charlatan, that he would be forbidden officially to
      practice medicine, that he could put his signature to no
      official document. Did it matter? Good work could be done
      in exile by an outsider. Perhaps it was his fate to be an
      outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tom was watching him. J. J. was taking the matter
      devilish seriously. But then, of course, he would. Sir
      Thomas did not know how emotion coloured this crisis for
      Dr. J. J. Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s head came out of his hands. The one, final question
      was security. What if this enterprise proved a failure, or
      the old man grew tired of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask you some questions, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my lad. Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My taking such a post would mean my ceasing to be a member
      of my profession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Almost certainly so. And what--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Security?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tom grinned at him kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't let my friends down. When I start a show, I don't
      get peevish and throw up the sponge if profits aren't good
      in the first five years. You want hard tacks, J. J. Well,
      naturally. Let's get down to hard tacks. I start you on a
      salary of a thousand a year. But, mark you, as a partner,
      and I want you to be a partner, you will draw a share of
      the profits, say, one sixth to begin with, in addition to
      your salary. The proportion would rise as the business
      developed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are being very generous, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I? Well, suppose we regard it as sharing brains. You
      bring in your brains for the research side; I use mine for
      the organisation and the marketing. I'm getting as well as
      giving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When would you begin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once. Your salary will start directly you say yes. We
      shall have to form a company, but we'll keep the shares in
      the family. I shan't have to look around for premises. I
      have 'em, but we shall have to enlarge and increase our
      staff."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was staring at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have a night to think it over, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Staying the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't bring anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we can fit you out. No need to worry about that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. slept and slept soundly in a pair of Sir Thomas' blue
      silk pyjamas in that most warm and comfortable house. He
      slept, because he knew that though he had temporised and
      asked for time to reflect, his decision was made, and had
      been made for him by this crisis in the life of the woman
      he loved. He had not told Kitty. Kitty might have been
      troubled by the thought that he was sacrificing something
      for her, nor should she know of the change in their
      fortunes until the whole business was settled. Almost, J.
      J. wallowed in that warm bed, and woke to take his early
      morning tea with a feeling of gaiety. The winter sun was
      shining, and hope singing like a robin outside his window.
      Sir Thomas appeared as some golden god with three mystical
      words shining like a halo about his head: "Genasol,
      Pepsonol, Iodol."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. shaved himself with one of Sir Thomas' razors, using
      a new ivory-handled brush for the lather. What comfort was
      this! And why not such comfort? Why penury and frustration
      and the shabby shames of an obscure and futile struggle
      with the prejudices and the jealousies of professionalism?
      J. J. went in to kiss his wife, for Kitty breakfasted in
      bed. He sat on the edge of her bed, and the new light that
      was in him shone upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try and borrow Sir Thomas' closed car. Sir Herbert
      expects us this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I stay with you, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think about it, sweetheart. Well see what the great
      man has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas and J. J. sat down to breakfast together, and J.
      J. had cream and brown sugar with his porridge. Sir Thomas
      twinkled at him. Was he to be allowed sugar? Yes, he had
      taken his dose of Pepsonol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bowels regular, my lad, and no flatus. Well, what about
      it? I've got the company named."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stirred his porridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In parliamentary language, sir, the answer is in the
      affirmative."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tom chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long-winded devils, the politicians. Why not yes? How do
      you fancy P.P. Products for our show? P for Pratten, P for
      Pope. No pills this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      ""Excellent, sir, and so alliterative. I think I ought to
      tell you one of my reasons for accepting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kitty has consumption."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Pratten nearly dropped his spoon. His kind little
      porcine eyes came out on stalks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! You don t mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, sir. I've found the bacilli. I'm taking her to see
      Sir Herbert Bland."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas spooned away at his porridge, and with such
      shocked carelessness that he slopped some of it over the
      rim of the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I say, J. J.! What a job for you, poor lad! Poor kid.
      I thought she was looking so much better. But my dear
      fellow--What are we going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Sir Herbert agrees with me I want to send her to
      Switzerland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was silent, save for the sounds associated with
      the consumption of porridge. He was thinking hard and fast,
      and to good purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, J. J., let's be honest. If Kitty had been
      otherwise, would you have accepted my offer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was looking at the coffee-pot. He smiled at it, but
      not because it was a coffee-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I think I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Because, you see, your generosity is giving me my
      chance. I take it that you won't tie me down to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite an old fool, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I suggest it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't, if one is wise, nail up brains in a
      packing-case. Your job will be free research, to find and
      produce things that are not humbug. My job will be to put
      them on the market. It's a partnership."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're rather a great man, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get along with you! I am going to enjoy this. There's life
      in the old horse yet."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It might be a winter world, but the sun was shining, and
      after breakfast J. J. climbed the hill behind Pollards, and
      from this high place looked out upon the world. The voice
      of Professional Piety could have said that he had been
      tempted by the Devil, and that Sir Thomas Pratten had
      displayed to him all the countries of a man's desire, and
      offered him power and wealth if he would prostitute his
      skill in the cause of commerce. Perhaps, J. J. would have
      laughed, and turned upon any Pharisee who had so judged him
      and his friend. J. J. was feeling most strangely at peace
      with himself and with this lovely landscape, this piece of
      England with its parkland and its trees, and its grey
      distances fading in the tenuous sunlight into a thin blue
      sky. For, what had been his choice? To choose between hope
      for the creature whom he loved, and the heresy that a
      Hierarchy would condemn, a Hierarchy which had helped him
      little, and whose prejudices were the shackles of a
      professional pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      As J. J. descended the hill he saw the smoke rising
      straight and softly blue into the winter sunlight. How
      lovely this world could be, and how sad it would be for
      Kitty to leave it. But she should not leave it. No, by God,
      there was hope in the air. J. J. wandered down and through
      a door in a flint wall, and coming to the paved terrace,
      paused again to look at the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a rapping on a window, and turning about saw Sir
      Thomas' fiery face close to the glass. He had a bulldog
      pipe stuck in his mouth, and his eyes were merry. He
      beckoned, to J. J. and J. J. walked on, and entering the
      old house, made his way to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was sitting at his desk, with papers before him.
      He pushed a slip of pinkish paper across the desk towards
      J. J.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better have a half-year's payment in advance, my lad. May
      be useful."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. picked up the cheque and read "Pay Dr. J. J. Pope the
      sum of Five Hundred Pounds." He stood staring at it, and a
      little secret smile spread over his face. Sir Thomas
      observed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any regrets, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None at all, sir. Only gratitude for your generosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gratitude be damned! I'm not buying you. I'm co-opting
      you. Look here, I've drawn out an informal agreement to
      cover the business until the formal document is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was folding up the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't need any such contract, sir. Your word is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, and fudge, my lad. Supposing I fell down dead
      tomorrow morning? Sign and be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under protest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other with eyes of faith and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To protest against fortune, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is just silly? I'll sign, sir, and I'll give you more than
      a signature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to tell Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. Not till she is on the way back to health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas put his signature to the agreement, pushed it
      across to J. J. and passed him a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at him and signed his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take it as read."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a good job done."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a25" id="a25">25</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Pratten's closed car drove them up to London.
      Kitty wore the furs Sir Thomas had given her, and was
      tucked up in two fur rugs. She was feeling cold, because
      she was frightened, and trying to hide her fear. J. J. held
      her hand under the rugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seem to have brought you nothing but bad luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said he, and squeezed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., how can we afford it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This illness, and my going abroad. If I died, it would be
      just waste, wouldn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day his was the courage, even though it trembled in
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not going to die, my sweet. I am not going to let
      you do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her troubled face, and changing his purpose,
      decided to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite a rich man, Kit. We've had a stroke of luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I didn't mean to tell you. I thought of keeping it as
      a surprise. No need to worry about money. Sir Thomas is
      starting a new company, and has asked me to be his research
      chemist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand pounds a year and a share in the profits. I
      have a cheque for five hundred in my pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to say. Does it mean you will be free to
      do the work you want to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How wonderful! Oh, I'm so happy. Somehow, I don't feel
      afraid any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her hand from under the rugs and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you feeling afraid? Of course. So was I, terribly
      afraid, but somehow I have a feeling that you are going to
      get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must get well. Shall we live in London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Well have a little place in the country, perhaps
      somewhere on the Surrey hills. I can go up and down every
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lovely! I must get well, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you are going to get well. There will be so many
      wonderful things we shall have to do together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley Street had seemed a very gloomy street to J. J. on
      the day when he had paid that panic call upon Sir Herbert
      Bland, but to-day it seemed less gloomy, nor did it rouse
      any regrets in him. He would never be Harley Street. In
      fact, Harley Street might ostracise him, and treat him as a
      traitor, a little charlatan who had sold away the soul of
      Science. He was about to sin against the doctrine that you
      served humanity, not commerce; an admirable doctrine, no
      doubt, if it could claim universality. But how many men,
      however eminent, were loyal to the spirit of the credo? A
      few, yes, a very few.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., sitting with his wife in Sir Herbert's opulent
      waiting-room, and looking at the pictures and the china and
      the choice old furniture, wondered what the great physician
      would think of him if he knew that Dr. J. J. Pope was to
      surrender himself to commerce. Though that was a crude way
      of putting it. J. J.'s torch was still alight. He would
      carry it differently, and perhaps to more purpose. He might
      command power as well as brains. That which he could
      discover might still be of service to humanity, though it
      would be a proprietary product, and not just the latest
      fashion in professional practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man-servant summoned Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Pope, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in with me, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Sir Herbert would prefer--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, do come."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. followed his wife into the consulting-room. Sir
      Herbert was sitting at his desk. He rose and held out a
      hand to Kitty, while the physician in him observed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you rather I waited, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Pope, come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., as a professional critic, was reassured by the way
      Sir Herbert went into the case. He was deliberate, kind,
      and profoundly thorough. Kitty was sent behind a screen to
      remove such clothes as were necessary, and with a blanket
      over her shoulders she sat facing the light and Sir
      Herbert. J. J. was objectively absorbed in the other man's
      mental processes, while the subjective part of him seemed
      part and parcel of his wife. He sat, inwardly trembling,
      while Sir Herbert was auscultating Kitty's chest. He
      watched the other man's face, as though he might read the
      verdict there, but Sir Herbert's face remained calm and
      unrevealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just listen here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert passed his stethoscope to J. J. and laid the
      point of a pink finger over the right side below the
      collarbone. J. J. adjusted the stethoscope and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compare the other apex."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did so. And then he straightened, looked at Sir
      Herbert and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that will do, Mrs. Pope. Put on your things, and
      wait. Your husband and I would like to talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. helped his wife to dress. He was very conscious of
      her anxious little face, and the unasked question in her
      eyes. He smiled at her. Both of them needed a courage that
      could smile. Sir Herbert was jotting down notes in his
      case-book, but he too was conscious of the suspense those
      two were suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had gone, and J. J. sat with his eyes fastened to Sir
      Herbert's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right apex, Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diminished breath sounds and a faint crepitus. A very
      early case, and a very limited area of infection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard what I heard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but where one's affections are concerned--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. One ceases to be a dispassionate judge. Your wife
      looks a healthy young woman. No wasting. And I should say
      she has the right temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, you think, sir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Given every advantage I see no reason why that patch
      should not dry up and leave just a scar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have written to Adler. Can you manage to send your
      wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. As soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect to hear from Adler any day. Directly I hear I
      will let you know. Could you manage to go out with her? I
      think it would be advisable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I can go, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us have your wife in again. I think I can speak
      words of good cheer."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They were back at No. 5 Chellwood Terrace, for, now that
      they were to be parted for so long, they wished to spend
      the hours together. The car went back empty to Pollards
      with a letter from each of them, and on the following day
      J. J. travelled down by train to see Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did not want you to feel, sir, that we had left you
      rather churlishly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lad, I understand. All that matters is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just that. I am taking her out myself directly we
      hear that Dr. Adler has room for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather like to share, J. J., in the fees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. You have been very generous. I don't want to take
      everything and give nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Generally, it is the other way about, my lad. I suppose
      that when you have seen Kitty settled--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more work, the better. When you are ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had an architect down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like to get moving, J. J. You don't know our place at
      Edgeware?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "While the additions are being made I can have a temporary
      lab. fitted up for you in the old building. I shall want
      you to supervise the scientific side of the new one. You
      and Marker, the architect, can work together."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, it seems that I can take down my plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, that is one of the first things that J. J. did on
      his return to Chellwood Terrace. Neighbours saw the little
      doctor at work with a spanner, removing the brass plate
      from the iron gate. To Chellwood Terrace the act was
      symbolical of failure. Dr. Charlie Steel, happening along
      just as J. J. had finished the job, paused, stared and
      crossed the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, leaving us, Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shortly. I shall be here for a while, but I am giving up
      private practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the little beggar come in for money, or was he putting
      up a bluff to cover his retreat?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was coming to see you, Steel. If you care to take on my
      leavings, you are welcome to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I don't take on any man's leavings. More than
      enough to do, as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid," said J. J., standing with his brass plate
      tucked under his arm, and slipping the bolts into his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he climbed the steps to his own door he could not help
      thinking what a funny business was the life of a
      professional gentleman. You gave five years of your youth
      to acquiring qualifications, and then, unless you had money
      or influence you might be one of the unemployed. You could
      put your name on a door and sit and wait for the world to
      notice you, yet, if you had some claim to distinction, you
      might not record it, and you remained undistinguishable
      from the man who had scraped a pass. How nice it would be
      to put on your brass plate "Gold Medallist, Prizeman No. 1
      in the Natural Science Tripos--Cambridge--189--." But such
      struttings and posturings were not permitted, and perhaps
      advisedly so. You might provoke too much jealousy in the
      mediocre crowd. You might develop into a professional
      bounder.

    <p>
      Kitty was much occupied with various matters, matters that
      concerned J. J. He had closed the door when he heard her
      calling him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the dining-room to find the table covered
      with an assortment of shirts and underclothing. His.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been going through your things. You want some new
      warm vests, dear. Do buy them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And shirts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance fell upon the plate that was tucked under his
      arm, and her eyes became rueful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., it does seem rather sad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. I've removed the prison number from the door of
      my cell. I offered it to Steel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How naughty of you! And J., Ellen and I have been
      arranging everything. She is going to stay with us. I have
      told her what to give you, and to spend more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A complete weekly menu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do want you to be comfortable while I'm away."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laid the brass plate on the top of the pile of
      underclothing, and went round the table and kissed his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mustn't worry about me, my sweet. Coal bills won't be
      terrifying in the future. What matters, is your future--our
      future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., I do love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why you should, Kit, will always remain something of a
      mystery to me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Snorting strenuously the train climbed the mountain track.
      J. J. and Kitty were alone together in a compartment that
      was warm and snug. They sat and held hands and looked at
      Switzerland, snow, dark pines, sunlight, blue sky, blue
      water. It was a brilliant day and no mist hid the lake
      below. Kitty had travelled well, amazingly well. They had
      spent a night at Geneva, and Dr. Adler had come to the
      hotel and examined Kitty. He was a little, stout, kindly
      Jew, very black as to hair, with one of those intelligent
      and benignant faces. He spoke good English, also French and
      German, and J. J. had been content to meet Dr. Adler in
      English. He had little French, and his German was somewhat
      rusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler had been very cheering. Kitty's was a very early
      case, and from the texture of her he judged that she would
      prove a hopeful patient. Plenty of fresh milk, eggs,
      butter, plenty of sleep, plenty of sunlight and Swiss air.
      J. J. and Dr. Adler had liked each other. There was to be
      more than liking between them in the days that were to
      come. Dr. Adler had said: "Since you are a member of my
      profession, Dr. Pope, I shall charge reduced fees," and J.
      J. had smiled at him and shaken his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. That is very kind of you, but I am no longer a
      doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler had raised expressive black eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my friend Sir Herbert Bland--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a doctor, but now I have taken a post in research."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you still remain--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I am joining a company that will sell proprietary
      preparations for profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler had looked a little puzzled. How stringent were
      the English! But all that was of yesterday. J. J. and Kitty
      sat holding hands and looking at the mountains and the snow
      and the pine-woods and the blue sky. They were both happy
      together, and sad with the tender sadness of those who
      loved and were to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must get well quickly, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you will. But you won't come back, my dear, till
      Adler is satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will come out and see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could keep me away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can afford it now, can't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easily. I'm going to look round for a country cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any choice of places?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could it be near Yatley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might. I'll look around."
    </p>
    <p>
      For, to both of them there was assuagement and comfort in
      speaking of the future as though, already, it was theirs.
      Who could forecast doom in this consoling sunlight?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler's private sanatorium was a little white building
      sitting likea swan on a nest, save that the nest was on the
      hillside instead of by the water. It had a garden that was
      snow, a terrace, and balconies where patients could be
      sheltered, and soak themselves in the light and air. Dr.
      Adler was both a humanist and a psychologist. He had
      refused to stress the hospital, and his sanatorium
      suggested a small and comfortable hotel. Emphasise sickness
      and your patients might continue to feel sick. Give them
      light and air and warmth, and comfortable beds, and
      excellent food, and music and laughter. Dr. Adler had been
      very particular in choosing his chef, almost more
      particular than in the choice of his matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      A snow-plough had been at work, and a closed carriage met
      them at the station, with a great, big, cheerful nurse in
      attendance. The sick needed both strength and sympathy
      about them, and again the choice had been carefully made.
      Nurse Pauline Muller looked capable of carrying Kitty
      upstairs and downstairs and into my lady's chamber, but
      Kitty did not need such succour. She did not look like a
      sick woman, or behave like one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Matron, Madame La Jeune, met them in the well-warmed
      lounge. She had the face of a capable saint, but a smiling
      saint. It was she who took husband and wife upstairs, and
      showed them a room on the first floor. Its walls were
      cream, its carpet and curtains a soft rose; the bed was a
      bed and not an ugly steel trestle. There was an armchair,
      cushions, books, and a folded rug to spread over your knees
      if you needed it. The tall French window was without lace
      curtains, so that all the light should enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J., accustomed to the efficient sterility and the
      austerities of an institution, blessed the humanity of the
      man who could be artist as well as doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had gone to the window. It had a balcony, and a view
      that was superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lovely, J.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you should be happy here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt for his hand. Yes, as happy as one could be when
      two people who loved each other were to be separated for a
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Matron La Jeune intervened with gentle authority. Kitty
      was to go to bed after the journey. It was essential that
      no patient should be over-tired. Kitty, turning a rather
      childlike and "Must I?" face to J. J., saw him smile and
      nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, wise orders. I agree with you, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was staying the night at the Beau Rivage in Montreux,
      and since the sun was still shining, he chose to walk down
      the winding road and look at the lake and the Dents du
      Midi. He was feeling at peace with himself. That was a good
      place up there, and Kitty would he cared for by good women.
      Yes, imagination had gone into the making of that
      rest-house, an imagination and a feeling for the human
      things of life that were rare. Dr. Adler was no stereotyped
      professionalist but a man with an artist's comprehension of
      the world of the sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope had a feeling that Dr. Adler could teach him
      many things, and in the mood of a disciple J. J. came down
      from that high place to the waters of the lake, and
      wandered beside it for a while like a man who was
      apprehending a future that, to him, might be richly
      revealing. The full vision of it had not come to him as
      yet, but come it would. A wounded love may be more
      educative than any text-book.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As though to test his lungs and heart, J. J. walked up to
      Glion next morning to say goodbye to his wife. He found
      Kitty in bed, with the window open, and the sunlight
      pouring in. Never, he thought, had she looked prettier,
      with her dark velvet eyes, soft skin, and honey-coloured
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a good night, dearest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a good breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely rolls and butter and cherry jam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Piglet!" and he pinched her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      His playfulness was wilful, for suddenly he was sad with a
      great sadness at the thought of leaving her, and there was
      the same sadness in her eyes. They might smile, and talk
      tender nonsense, but the anguish was more than skin deep.
      J. J. felt like a boy who wanted to rush out of the room
      and blub. He seemed to divine in his wife the soul of a
      frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't feel cold, J., with the window open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. This central heating is an idea. I think well
      have it in our cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting on the edge of her bed and suddenly she
      clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my darling, you have been so good to me, given me so
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was inarticulate. He kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to what you have given me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I haven't. I often think that if you hadn't married
      me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a kind of gentle fierceness that he took her
      face between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mustn't talk like that. Not true. Through you, Kit, I seem
      to be learning things. I was a hard little devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a26" id="a26">26</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas drove J. J. down to Edgeware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, J. J. had passed through Edgeware on one previous
      occasion on a pleasure drive in Peter Pratten's car, and he
      had seen confronting them an old red Georgian mansion with
      a long, grey tail attached to it. Across its façade had run
      in huge gilded letters "Pratten's Pills," and in lesser
      letters--"Try Them. You Will Feel Better." The cedar trees
      of Georgian planting still stood there, and that ruddy
      aristocrat of a house seemed to look down its nose at the
      world in apologetic embarrassment. Certainly, the Georgians
      in their royal phase had loved gold, witness Windsor, and
      the beds and chairs, cornices and picture-frames, but only
      in the cause of splendour. This advertising business
      uncovered the tail of your shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had felt Peter wince. He had accelerated past that
      rather blatant building.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish the old man would take down those damned letters".
      They grin like gold teeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when they approached the Pratten building, J. J. looked
      out for the Pill Parade, and rather shrinkingly so, only to
      realise that the old house had been stripped of its
      regalia. It stood there more as of old, decorous and
      dignified and solid. J. J. was posed by a question, or a
      series of questions. When had that gold lettering been
      removed? Recently? And if so had a sensitive consideration
      for the feelings of his new partner inspired the
      transfiguration? J. J. wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car turned in between the brick pillars, and drew up
      outside the Ionic portico. A commissionaire in uniform came
      to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hempstead in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead was the Pratten general manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas got out and J. J. followed him, but Sir Thomas
      did not at once enter the building. He toddled across the
      gravel, and stood on the grass by one of the cedars, and
      again J. J. followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice old place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," said his new partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well keep it like that. My idea is, J. J., to build on at
      the back, good brown brick to tone with our new dignity."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave J. J. a shrewd, oblique twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have to consider our dignity, now. Serious business. I've
      got you to live up to."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thanks needed. One grows out of being just a goldbug,
      or should do. Let's go in and see Hempstead. He should have
      the new plans, and the builder's specifications."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead's office was on the ground floor in a room
      that retained its Georgian panelling. It was a white and
      gold room, but the gilding was not too obvious. It had
      solid office furniture in good mahogany, and a Turkey
      carpet. Mr. Hempstead also was solid, completely middle
      class and reliable, with a bald head, a walrus moustache,
      and eyes that looked vaguely puzzled behind big spectacles.
      For Mr. Hempstead was a somewhat puzzled man. He had
      managed Pratten Pills for nearly fifteen years, and had
      become globular in the process. Adaptation was not easy,
      especially so when a more subtle atmosphere was being
      imposed upon the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Hempstead; this is Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead pushed out a pink hand, and showed a set of
      very artificial teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased to meet you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. and the general manager shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas went and stood with his back to the fire, his
      hands in his trouser pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got the plans, Hempstead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. They came in two days ago, from the builders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the specifications?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does the figure work out at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not too bad. Dr. Pope would like to see the plans, and
      criticise them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead rang the bell for a clerk, and the rolls of
      cartridge-paper, and the typed booklet of specifications
      were brought in. Mr. Hempstead unrolled the plans, and
      spreading them on a large mahogany table, persuaded them to
      lie flat by arranging round their margins a letter weight,
      an ink-pot, ledgers, and sundry other office impediments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I presume that Dr. Pope is chiefly interested in the
      scientific side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, Hempstead, but I want to see the lay-out of the
      new works, packing and transport arrangements, and all
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is here, sir. Shall I demonstrate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead demonstrated with the aid of the blunt tip of
      a fat pink finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground-plans and elevations and sections were new phenomena
      to J. J., but he soon grasped the efficient simplicity of
      the lay-out. The upper floor was to be his, the brain of
      the building, where, with every modern advantage he would
      labour and produce his goods. There was a laboratory, a
      little office, and a subsidiary workshop where, under his
      direction, assistants could prepare samples of his
      products. The whole of the next floor was the factory where
      the new Pratten proprietary drugs would be produced in
      bulk. The ground floor dealt with distribution, checking,
      packing, and dispatch. A lift connected the three floors.
      As to the style of the building, it was on Georgian lines,
      with tall and generous windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead, having completed his demonstration, paused
      to blow his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does it strike you, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The upper floor is your show. What about all the
      paraphernalia, Hempstead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead was still polishing his broad, red nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We thought that Dr. Pope would take charge of that. It is
      a highly technical business. The architect can put us in
      touch with a firm of chemical engineers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's your pigeon, J. J. Furnaces, and retorts, and all
      that sort of thing. I'll leave that to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the cost, sir? Some of the new equipment
      will be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhat expensive, eh? No matter. We'll have all the most
      up-to-date gadgets. Money saved in the end, you know."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The flotation of the new company, P.P. Products, Ltd., and
      the erecting and fitting up of the new building, would take
      time, but J. J. discovered in the older building facilities
      for immediate production. He was satisfied with Pepsonol as
      a preparation, both as to its therapeutic value and its
      texture; it was palatable and it would keep. He suggested
      to Sir Thomas that temporary equipment could be installed
      in the old building, and Pepsonol manufactured in
      marketable quantity. Sir Thomas agreed, but there were
      other and very important details to be considered. Pepsonol
      would have to be bottled, and the bottles labelled, and
      instructions prepared and printed for the purchasers. Here,
      artistry and originality were indicated. Sir Thomas
      believed that to catch and please the patient's eye was as
      necessary as dressing a shop window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have special bottles of our own, J. J. I'll send for
      samples. Æsthetics, my lad. The Frenchies understand that
      sort of thing. Look how they put up their scents, and their
      face-creams, and all that. Your stuff may be good, but it
      won't be any the worse for a nice appearance. Who shows off
      a frock best? Some blowzy old dame, or a pretty young thing
      with a figure."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a fancy bottle was chosen for Pepsonol, no mere
      straight up and down glass spinster, but a kind of
      vase-shaped phial, manufactured in two sizes, a sixteen
      ounce and an eight ounce. A gentleman who specialised in
      art-posters and advertising leaflets was commissioned to
      design the label. He produced quite a pretty apron in white
      and blue, an apron that would sit nicely on the graceful
      phial. When the first sample was ready for exhibition, old
      Tom chuckled over it, and proposed an experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what, J. J, we'll try it and others on the female
      staff, parade half-a-dozen bottles, with Miss Pepsonol, and
      have a kind of baby show. Label 'em all alike, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done. The various bottles were paraded upon Mr.
      Hempstead's mahogany table, and Mr. Hempstead's secretary,
      two typists and three women packers were brought into the
      room one by one and requested to select the bottle that
      pleased them most. The votes were five to one in favour of
      Sir Thomas' own choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are, J. J. Popular verdict, what! The next thing
      will be to get out the adverts, and the literature. Hope
      I'm not disgusting you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was looking into other and more significant
      distances. No, he was not disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. had to admit to himself that when he sat down to
      write the inevitable letter to the Secretary of The General
      Medical Council, he was scared by the finality of the
      confession he had to make. He was asking to be defrocked.
      He had no intention of waiting until he was hauled before
      his elders, catechised, and perhaps lectured, before
      judgment was passed upon him. If he was to be an outcast,
      he would go into voluntary exile. But how final and fatal
      the letter sounded.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Sir,<br>
      <br>
      I consider it my duty to notify you that I am joining a
      company as their research chemist. The company is engaged
      in the production and marketing of proprietary products.
      Therefore, I desire to have my name removed from the
      Register.<br>
      <br>
      Yours faithfully,<br>
      <br>
      J. J. Pope.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For two days he hesitated before posting the letter. What
      if P.P. Products proved a failure? He knew that he might
      have very little chance of being reinstated in his
      profession. He would have failed to conform; he would have
      flouted a tradition. Professional discipline could be
      merciless, and perhaps rightly so, but was it not rather
      hard that to gain his freedom he should have to risk so
      ruthless a verdict?
    </p>
    <p>
      He posted his letter. In his innocence he may have thought
      that the matter was ended. No acknowledgement reached him
      for nearly a fortnight. In his letter he had used nice,
      comfortable words, but he knew that they could be
      translated into syllables of contempt. For research-worker
      insert "Quack," for proprietary products read "Patent
      Medicines." But he had done the honest thing. No one could
      accuse him of attempting to possess the best of both
      worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reply reached him in due course. It was a curt and formal
      letter. It asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Sir,<br>
      <br>
      Before arriving at any decision in your case, the Council
      would like you to answer the following questions:<br>
      <br>
      1. Are you to be engaged as a salaried employee?<br>
      <br>
      2. Does the company propose to sell through the profession,
      or direct to the public?<br>
      <br>
      3. The name of the particular company.<br>
      <br>
      4. Will its products be advertised to the public?<br>
      <br>
      5. Will any personal profit accrue to you from the sale of
      these proprietary preparations?
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Gosh! It was like sitting down to answer an examination
      paper! What an inquisition! J. J. felt his mane bristling
      as he sat down to reply. He did not answer the questions.
      He repeated his request for his name to be removed from the
      Register, and stated with some frankness that since he
      would cease to be a member of the medical profession, his
      future activities were no concern of the General Medical
      Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, the gentlemen who composed the council thought
      otherwise. He received a request to appear before a
      committee, and to explain his position. The guardians of
      the flock were not inclined to suffer a member of it to
      escape without putting him in the pillory. J. J. was angry.
      He had a very good idea of what such a confrontation would
      entail, catechisings, homilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very busy man these days, and he took the letter
      to Edgeware and showed it to Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas had had
      a little private suite fitted up for his use while he was
      directing and energising the new adventure, spending his
      weekends at Pollards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A summons before the Sanhedrin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that, sir. It means, of course, that if I refuse to
      conform, I shall be taboo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your inclination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated. Did Sir Thomas realise that he would be
      burning his boats? Sir Thomas did understand the finality
      of the choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to tell them to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to hell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, tell 'em that. If you have any doubts, my lad, about
      my letting you down, forget them. You are my partner. I'll
      have a clause inserted in the contract to the effect that
      should the P.P. business prove a frost, I compensate you.
      But I don't propose to face a frost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That gives me security, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. wrote curtly to the Council, explaining his position
      and stating that he had no intention of appearing before
      them. He received an equally curt reply, notifying him that
      his name would be removed from the register, and that as a
      commercialist he was disqualified from acting as a medical
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. placed the letter before Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are an outcast, J. J. You join me as a bad citizen.
      Well, well, it may be that, eventually, we may be of more
      service to the public than some of these gentlemen. We
      shall see."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This scuffle for his freedom may have angered J. J. Pope,
      but he had been hurt by it in the secret places of his
      self-esteem, J. J. had other visions, though they might be
      distant and nebulous at the moment. The P.P. Products Co.
      was a ladder up which he would climb until his head was
      securely in the sunlight. It was a means to an end. It
      promised him leisure, freedom, power. He could carry his
      work unhindered into significant and surprising
      explorations. If and when power was his he chose to give
      the fruits of his labour to the world, that would be his
      privilege. That his brother men might damn him as a
      charlatan, dub his products quackery, and refuse to test or
      use them was a possibility that he had to face. Other men
      greater than he had had to face it. Genius is always
      suspect until it has become history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if official letters angered him, and all his life J.
      J. was to despise officialdom of every description, and
      elude it, there were letters to cheer him. Peter, parading
      the new power somewhere in Spain, wrote from Madrid to
      congratulate his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about the High Priests. We lads have to break
      with tradition, and then, I suppose, recover that which is
      worth while. It makes me chuckle to think of you and the
      pater in double harness. Take it from me that though the
      Bart has a cayenne temper, I've never known him do a mean
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's letters came thrice a week. They were happy and
      affectionate letters, and spiced with fun. There was no
      self-pity in this vital, sanguine creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a most awful appetite, J. J. I shall expect any
      cow I see to look at me reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The snow is going, and I've seen the grass full of
      crocuses. They say the flowers here are wonderful, a real
      colour spangle. And the apples and the cherries. Every
      other tree seems to be a cherry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've put on eight pounds. I must be all milk and butter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do hope Ellen is looking after you properly. Did you buy
      those new shirts and woollies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are all so kind here. Who do you think came
      yesterday? Peter and Sybil. She frightens me a little, but
      I like her. They seem very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got into the new lab. yet? Do tell me all about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you had time to look for a cottage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. kept all his wife's letters tucked away in a secret
      place. And there were other letters to reinforce the
      cheerfulness of Kitty's. Dr. Adler posted a weekly report
      upon Mrs. Pope's progress, and with it he enclosed a short,
      personal letter to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pope was proving a most promising patient. Her
      appetite was excellent, and she had put on weight. The
      moist sounds at the right apex had disappeared, and so had
      the expectoration, nor did her temperature rise at night.
      Dr. Adler was the most cautious of men where prophecy was
      concerned, but every indication pointed to steady progress.
      That wet spot in Kitty's lung seemed to be drying up.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. wanted to thank somebody: God, Providence. He would
      have liked to thank God, but he was vague in his
      postulating of the Diety. Yet, life seemed good, and he was
      ceasing to be worried by the professional murmurings of The
      Mighty. His name might have been removed from the sacred
      scroll, but he was dreaming of drafting diplomas of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a27" id="a27">27</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of the year J. J. began seriously to search
      for that country cottage. Kitty was writing of the
      floweriness of the Swiss hillsides, the crocuses, the blue
      squills, the primroses, apple and cherry blossom, narcissi
      like scented snow. She had spoken of Yatley, and J. J. had
      so little snobbishness in him that he did not shrink from
      contact with a world that had known him as the child of the
      village shop. Moreover, Yatley, or the southern slope of
      the green-sand ridge beyond it, would be a perfect habitat
      for Kitty, a great wall shutting out the north wind, clear
      to the south and the sea wind, spacious and free. J. J.
      gave up his Sundays to exploring the old neighbourhood only
      to realise that the cottage Kitty dreamed of did not appear
      to exist. And Yatley was all Strange, Larcombe or Tufnell,
      so far as real estate was concerned, and none of these old
      families would welcome the builder, or part with property
      that might be regarded as sacred soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frustrated, J. J. walked up the Larcombe drive one Sunday
      afternoon, and asked for the squire; Mr. Larcombe was more
      than pleased to see him, for, at the moment Mr. Larcombe
      was rather bored with the increasing godliness of his wife,
      who, like an old hen turned cock, was crowing good works
      though all the countryside. Her passion for the ethical
      values of life as she saw them, included certain of her
      husband's foibles and their chastening, his love of port
      and of colourful language, and his fancy for pretty faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe liked the young about him. He walked J. J. off
      to the peach-house, where, as he explained, they could
      smoke in peace. Her husband's pipe was one of the things to
      which Mrs. Larcombe was objecting. Such a dirty habit, and
      so indicative of a lack of self-control! There were
      occasions when Mr. Larcombe exploded, and said "Damn it,
      Sarah, if I were ten years younger, I'd kick the bucket
      over, and go native." Vulgar fellow! So, Mr. Larcombe
      welcomed J. J. What, Mrs. Pope was in Switzerland with
      phthisis! Dear, dear, what bad luck! But she was going on
      well. Splendid! And J. J. wanted a cottage and couldn't
      find one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not build?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the land, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Land? Why, five hundred acres of the Strange estate are
      coming on the market. They say young Lawrence has blued
      thirty thousand pounds in two years. Drink and the
      gee-gees, and pretty ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Larcombe would have blushed, and as yet there were no
      peaches to blush, only the blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, J. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't buy five hundred acres, sir. I need about
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, but the land will be split into lots. I've got
      my eye on Beechanger. Remember it? Well, if I get it, for
      preservation, I could sell you a plot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very good of you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. I believe Tufnel is going for the rest. Doesn't
      want the country spoilt by speculative cads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would the price be, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, about fifty pounds to you. For a thousand you could
      put up a nice little place, everything included. Water?
      M-yes, you'd have to have a well. And a cesspool or septic
      tank. And acetylene gas. You could mortgage, you know, or
      raise money on a life insurance."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s eyes were bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say I could manage. Might we go and look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather, I've got one of the new toys, eight horse Rover.
      Look here, we'll go and have tea at old Killick's, and
      trundle up to Beechanger afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Mrs. Larcombe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's got all the Sunday-school teachers coming to tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. I want to have a look at Aunt's grave, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Great woman she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unique, sir, in her way. And when is the sale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auction next week at Dewhurst. Come along, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe got out his new four-seater tourer, being
      minded to make The Chequers before his wife left from the
      Sunday-school, but half way down the drive they met Mrs.
      Larcombe and her little crowd of teachers walking under the
      elms. Mrs. Larcombe held up a black-gloved hand like a
      police-constable ordering a motorist to stop, but Mr.
      Larcombe did not stop. He pretended to take his wife's
      signal as a salutation, and waved his hat. He accelerated.
      He let out an unseemly toot on the horn. One girl, and a
      pretty one, giggled. Youth might be in secret sympathy with
      the squire, even when equipped with a little black bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While The Chequers was preparing tea for them, J. J.
      strolled across to the churchyard and looked at his aunt's
      grave. He had had a headstone put up, and the grass was
      neatly kept. J. J. took off his hat to Miss Jane Pope's
      headstone, and stood for a minute in meditation. He would
      so much have liked to have asked Aunt Jane's advice upon
      the hypothetical cottage, and he had a feeling that she
      would have said: "Build. No one can run away with bricks
      and mortar." Miss Ivy Killick served their tea in the
      private parlour, and Ivy had a merry eye, and a high
      colour, and auburn hair. Mr. Larcombe and she exchanged
      badinage upon the eternal subject of swains and matrimony,
      and Mr. Larcombe got as good as he gave, which pleased him.
      When a pretty girl joked with you and looked sly, you
      weren't quite finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, the new green Rover pumped them up to
      Beechanger. This piece of high ground lay on a secondary
      road leading to Hamley Green, and about three quarters of a
      mile from Yatley church. Mr. Larcombe parked the car in a
      field gateway, and they climbed another gate into
      Beechanger Wood. They were glorious trees these beeches,
      just coming into leaf, their grey trunks soaring into
      clouds of glimmering green. Passing through the wood they
      came to a little alp or grassy plateau, and below them lay
      all that sweet valley, Sussex in the Spring, with the grey
      downs dim in the distance under a cloudless sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, J. J., what a site!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, and J. J. stood at gaze with a shimmer of light on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it too far from the road, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. There's the road, just down there. Swings round
      to take the hill. You could have a frontage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Down by that hedge with the yews in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was thinking of many things, but he asked Mr.
      Larcombe a significant question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is old Purvis still building?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he would be, if he had the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, sound craftsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None better. No jerry about Tom Purvis. You couldn't find
      a more honest chap. It would cost you less, J. J., and
      you'd get good stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very tempted, sir. If you get the land, will you let
      me know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, my lad, most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did much thinking on the question of the country
      cottage. He had named it in his own mind "Kit's Cot."
      Should he buy, build, and keep it as a surprise for her,
      challenging fortune and fate in the survival of her whom he
      held most dear? Life was being very much of an adventure,
      and J. J., feeling like a soldier of fortune, was in a mood
      to throw his glove in the face of fate and say "I will it.
      Therefore it shall happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Good philosophy, in spite of the Drearies. J. J. did not
      speak of the matter to his partner, for he was so deeply in
      Sir Thomas Pratten's debt that he shrank from adding to it,
      but, as it happened, Sir Thomas himself broached the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reports good, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About Kitty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long do you think she will be out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say six months, sir, if all goes well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd shut up calling me <i>sir.</i> What about the
      winter? Not--London."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. hesitated and then confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a country cottage in mind. On the Surrey hills
      overlooking the Weald."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am considering building if I can get the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, I could lodge in Edgeware during the week, and go
      down there for week-ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cost much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About a thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll advance it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go again. Damn it, can't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you can't. I am not going to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you say sponge, young man! Very well, if you like
      I'll take a mortgage, two thousand at two per cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be more than the full value of the property. No
      cover. I would accept a thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an obstinate little devil you are! All right, a
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. I can manage the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Let me know when the business is on."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. waited for news from Mr. Larcombe. At the moment he
      was working twelve hours a day, supervising the preparation
      of Pepsonol in bulk, and preparing improved samples of
      Iodol and Genasol. Also, he was experimenting with a new
      anodyne, a coal tar product, plus a mild dose of a certain
      alkaloid. Needing subjects upon which to test the
      combination, he appealed to Mr. Hempstead, who appeared to
      regard the proposal as a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better consult my secretary, Dr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not Dr. Pope now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ought you to order medicine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not. I can play chemist on the human subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Ask Miss Mitford. She's always away three days
      a month with a thing she calls migraine."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. approached Miss Mitford, a little, thin, dark woman
      with a nose prone to redness. Miss Mitford looked slightly
      embarrassed. It wasn't exactly migraine from which she
      suffered, but the pains and flushes and discomforts which
      afflict women once a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm quite ready to try it, doctor. I'd give anything to
      find something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave her samples of his powder, with instructions as
      to its use, and three weeks later Miss Mitford, gently
      blushing, waylaid him in a corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a doctor now; just a chemist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it matter? What I wanted to say was that I haven't
      had such a comfortable time for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know two or three others who suffer. Might they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any fee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I don't charge fees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, so very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Further evidence proved to J. J. that this product gave to
      women just that assuagement which they craved for,
      especially to those women who had to work. The compound was
      simple, harmless in moderate doses, and could be made up in
      tablet form. He found it to be very useful in relieving all
      pain, neuritic, rheumatic, migraine, toothache. J. J. put
      the details before Sir Thomas, and Sir Thomas understood
      the possibilities of such a product. It might go big all
      over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than a bromide, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has none of the disadvantages of bromide. Poor old Dame
      Bromide is out-of-date. With caffein added it stimulates as
      well as soothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is to find a good name for it, J. J. Get an
      inspiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sought that inspiration. It came to him while he was
      in his bath, and almost he cried "Eureka." Of course!
      Anodynia! It was simple and expressive, and easily
      remembered. He placed the name before Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely it, my lad. We'll put it on the market after
      Pepsonol."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe wrote to say that Beechanger was his,
      seventy-five acres of wood and heath and meadow. Had J. J.
      decided upon a cottage? J. J. had. There was no time to be
      wasted if the cottage was to be ready by the winter. J. J.
      trained down to Dewhurst one Sunday in May. He had warned
      Mr. Larcombe of his visit, and Mr. Larcombe, snatching at a
      good reason for avoiding church, met J. J. at the station
      with his car. Mr. Larcombe was delighted to have a
      vicarious interest and not only did he bring the car to
      meet J. J., but he brought Tom Purvis, builder and
      decorator, with it. They drove straight to Beechanger, and
      pottered about in consultation. Tom Purvis was a silent,
      comely old man with a pointed grey beard, and eyes that
      dwelt lovingly and steadfastly upon this English scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won'erful site, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s choice was a little grassy plateau above the road,
      with the beeches behind it, and a waste of gorse and
      heather spreading below. Would Mr. Larcombe consider the
      sale of an acre here? Most certainly he would, but he
      expressed a desire to hear what sort of cottage J. J.
      proposed to build. The red, mock Gothic villa had been in
      fashion, complete with ornamental tiles, stained glass, and
      a horrid air of genteel affectation. Mr. Larcombe was a
      countryman, and he abominated what he described as the
      suburban lobster style.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A miniature farmhouse, Sussex or Surrey, plain brown brick
      and tiles, with a brick porch and green shutters. That's my
      idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good egg," said Mr. Larcombe, "it won't shout so that you
      can hear it five miles off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Purvis played with his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could do that for 'ee in local brick. Brick all through,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, good and solid. I want a warm house. What about
      plans, Mr. Purvis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, if you be wanting a farmhouse, it would be easy
      to copy. I know 'em inside and out. There be Lavender Farm,
      f'instance, and High Wood, and Brook Bottom. You know 'em
      all. Is that your notion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, with the ceilings higher and the windows bigger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you tell me, sir, how many rooms you want and the size
      of 'em, I could get out a plan in a week. And the
      specifications."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ahead, Mr. Purvis. When could you start building?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, sir. But what about the title? Them lawyers do
      mess 'ee about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Larcombe chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You write me a cheque, J. J., for fifty pounds, and I'll
      agree to Tom getting busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be wanting a bit of a drive, sir, and a gate, and
      some fencing. I could do 'ee a light wire fence, if Mr.
      Larcombe won't object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could plant it out," said J. J. "A hornbeam hedge would
      be the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that life for the time being was to be all
      bricks and mortar for J. J. at both ends of his new world.
      The extension at Edgeware was rising swiftly in brick and
      steel, for in those days official interference, otherwise
      known as planning, was less obstructive, and each morning
      J. J. and Sir Thomas would walk amid the piers and pillars
      and girders, and climb ladders, and chat with foremen. The
      old Pratten building was also to be altered, when the new
      one was complete, but for the moment it was busy with the
      production, bottling and labelling of Pepsonol. Sir Thomas
      had had drafts of the advertisements submitted to him, and
      he and J. J. passed judgment upon them. They were to be
      varied in style according to the atmosphere of the paper or
      journal in which they were to appear, for that which might
      suit <i>The People</i> or <i>The Pink Un,</i> might appear
      out of place in <i>Punch</i> or <i>The Queen!</i> Sir
      Thomas was proposing to spend large sums on advertising.
      Publicity was essential if "P.P. Products" were to become
      as much a part of English domestic life as Pear's Soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tom Purvis had produced his plans and his estimates,
      and J. J. had accepted them, though he arranged for one or
      two modifications and additions. A glass-roofed and
      glass-screened loggia was to be built at one end of the
      house, and the living-room window was to be of plate glass
      and suggesting a shop window. Also, there was to be a
      furnace, and radiators in the living-room, the
      hall-passage, and the chief bedroom. Tom Purvis was
      perplexed by this newfangled idea, but a firm was
      discovered who could supply such strange luxuries. The
      addition would cost J. J. an additional hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday early in June he travelled to Yatley, and walked
      to Beechanger to inspect the foundations of Kit's Cot. They
      surprised and shocked him; the oblongs they enclosed looked
      absurdly small. Had old Purvis made a mistake, or tampered
      with the measurements?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not. When J. J. paced out the distances he found
      them to be according to plan. J. J. laughed at himself, and
      was moved to realise that though you might think yourself a
      very clever fellow, you were a mere child in the nursery
      when you stepped into some other fellow's workshop. He
      found a plank supported by two piles of bricks: Tom Purvis'
      staff-perch during the dinner hour, and he sat down on it.
      The plank was moderately clean and J. J. had no cause to
      worry now about professional trousers, but could feel at
      ease in a rough Tweed suit. That was yet another sign of
      freedom. He looked at the view. It was indeed a lovely
      landscape, but modern man--and woman--did not live on
      landscapes. Kitty would have air, sky, as much sun as
      England could produce, but would she have happiness here?
      You chased happiness, and it eluded you; you planned for
      it,and the thing vanished like smoke. Well, well, the
      modern scheme was supplying Arcady with new wings. It was
      possible and more than probable that if P.P. Products
      prospered, the Pope partnership would possess a small car.
      Kitty could go shopping in it. They could put up a garage
      down there by the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. meditated. He saw himself as a human marionette
      suspended on two threads, his wife's health and the good
      will of an ageing man whose whimsies might be incalculable.
      Very slender threads, but was not life itself sensitive and
      slender? You might feel yourself dangling over the edge of
      the unknown, but if you were roped to the one thing that
      mattered, you might enjoy the exhilaration of suspense,
      without fear. J. J. filled a pipe and lit it, and in this
      clean air the tobacco tasted good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspense! The thrill of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next week he would see Kitty. He was taking a seven-day
      holiday. He was going to Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a28" id="a28">28</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. followed the narrow road or lane leading to Dr.
      Adler's sanatorium. It skirted the edge of a grassy
      plateau, and ploughed between banks of flowering shrubs,
      gardens, and stone walls. Here and there a plantation of
      spruces spread dark green hands over it and gave it shade.
      The sky was an utter blue, and snow peaks brilliant wedges
      in it. The sun shone as it shines so rarely in the northern
      island. Roses poked their faces over fences and tossed
      their scent at the little man. From somewhere came the
      smell of mown grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. loitered. He savoured both his suspense and the
      sunlight. He thought: "No ugly fate can be waiting round
      the corner on a day such as this. Kitty ought to have two
      months of sunlight each winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned a corner and saw the white house sheltered by its
      rampart of dark spruces. Awnings were up over some of the
      balconies, and people were lying there. Too much direct
      sunlight could be dangerous. J. J. looked at the balcony
      that might be Kitty's. It was empty, and the windows were
      open wide. He came to the gate, and beyond a bank of
      flowers saw a figure in a chair under the shade of a young
      tree. It was Kitty, and she was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s tenderness knew a puckish moment. He puckered up
      his lips and whistled softly, a kind of bird note. He had
      been an expert bird-mimic as a boy. He saw the book
      lowered, and the head turned. Next moment his wife was out
      of the chair, and running down the slope of grass. The
      flower border separated them, and J. J., with shocking
      impulsiveness, walked through it. He was seeing nothing but
      his wife's face, a young and glowing face, alive, like the
      face of the Kitty of Mortimer Mews.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. cared not a damn about the people on the balconies.
      He clutched his wife and kissed her as a man kisses for the
      first time the mouth of his beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J<i>.,</i> all the people on the balconies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not really. Do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did it again, ignoring those other humans, nor
      suspecting that he might be tantalising some other man or
      woman. Two separate balconies were interested, but
      differently so; a woman with grey hair and a gentle, wasted
      face smiled upon them benignly; a dark man, with a starved,
      fierce visage, stared for a moment and then hid such
      passion behind a book. Never again would he be able to kiss
      like that; never would the woman he desired feel his
      kisses. Such frustration was like a spasm of harsh pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope children became decorous, and abruptly shy.
      Holding hands, they walked across the grass to the shade of
      Kitty's tree. They had become conscious of all those
      windows as eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said J. J.: "You look just as you used to look."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and more so. What's the weight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight stone, three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much in kilos?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've forgotten. They worked it out for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all the way down to the lake, yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mustn't get overtired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in her chair, and J. J. on the grass at her
      feet. He let his head rest against her knees. What a
      glorious day! He felt like his old small self, ready to
      throw off his clothes and dance in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Ellen been--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a mother to me. Sir Thomas sent you a kiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I had it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that sort of kiss, young woman. When did Dr. Adler see
      you last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said I might go back in September."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. clasped his knees, and looked at the sky. Should he
      tell her about the cottage? There were moments when secrets
      could not be kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have found the cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you? Oh, do tell me about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't quite a cottage yet. It's becoming one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm building it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yatley. Lovely spot, on the hills. Not too far for
      shopping. By the way, we shall shop at the old shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her fingers in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me about it, everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. felt in his breast pocket. He had plans there, neatly
      folded and enclosed in an envelope. His secret was out, and
      inevitably out now that Kitty was a sick woman no longer.
      He spread out the plans, and bending forward with her hands
      on his shoulders, she listened while he demonstrated Kit's
      Cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, dear, full south, with a beechwood behind. All that's
      view," and he gave a southward sweep of the hand. "Here's
      the road, and the gate and the drive. There's Yatley. Yes,
      we've got a whole acre. That's heather and gorse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, the house, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like an old farm house, long and low. Only one flight of
      stairs. Here's the living-room with a big window, fills
      half the wall. That's a glass loggia where you could sun
      yourself. Here's our bedroom. Radiators, in the
      living-room, bedroom and hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Radiators!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Keep you warm. I've arranged for a small kitchen.
      Have to make our own gas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., you are clever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too clever, sometimes. Then there is Ellen's bedroom, and
      a spare-room, and a bathroom. See down here. We can put up
      a garage. You'll have to learn to drive a small car."
    </p>
    <p>
      She patted his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lovely! Oh, J., I'm so excited. When is it going to be
      finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "End of October, I hope. My builder has taken on extra men.
      I said he must hustle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can we go in, when I--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will depend on the weather. If it is a dry summer,
      and we get good fires going for a week, we may manage it.
      Not going to let you go into a damp house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you told Ellen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She's country, and she won't mind. Besides, she's
      rather attached to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old Ellen. Oh, J., I'm so happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two people standing at an open French window on the ground
      floor, watched them benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Madame La Jeune: "Shall I? Your time is so precious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler fondled his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Let them be for a moment. I'll go up and see all the
      others first. I'm glad my news will be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame La Jeune touched his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do good things. That--is life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Jew smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It should be."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Circumstances were so kind during the summer that J. J.
      began to wonder whether there was some catch in the story.
      So accustomed had he become to frustration, prejudice, and
      trouble that he was like a solitary traveller in a strange
      land, glancing right and left and expecting some enemy to
      leap on him from an ambuscade. Nothing untoward happened.
      Mr. Purvis pressed on with the building during a summer
      that was exceptionally dry and sunny. Dr. Adler's reports
      upon Kitty continued to be favourable. The first
      consignment of Pepsonol was on the market, and had been
      taken up with surprising friendliness by druggists all over
      the country, which after all, was not so surprising, for
      Sir Thomas and Pratten's Pills employed travellers who were
      experienced and persuasive, and who knew their clients from
      Newcastle to Torquay. P.P. Pills were, in a sense, to act
      like ballbearings to the new products, helping them to roll
      smoothly into windows and on to counters. These travelling
      salesmen could spin a story. P.P. Products was to be one of
      the big things of the century; the company had engaged the
      services of one of the ablest research-workers in Europe.
      Pepsonol was given prominence in the advertising columns of
      the Sunday papers. Testimonials began to arrive, strange,
      naive letters which J. J. read with a kind of whimsical
      shyness. Was this to be the kind of fame he had dreamed of;
      not Harley Street and professional reputation, but
      laudations from the cook and the bus-conductor, the
      postman, and housewives whose cooking was indifferent, and
      who ate too fast!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kit's Cot's roof was on J. J. took Sir Thomas to see
      the place, or rather Sir Thomas drove J. J. down in his
      car. It was a sweltering day late in August, and Sir
      Thomas, who was no mean hustler, was astonished at the
      speed with which the building had gone up. Well, after all,
      they could do things in the country. Tom Purvis' men were
      not ca-canny. They did not hold on to the job, and work out
      overtime. Tom had a head-bricklayer whose boast was that he
      could lay twelve hundred bricks a day and lay them well and
      truly. Sir Thomas poked about, and tried to find something
      jerry, but both work and materials were good. He had to
      confess that these country craftsmen put the erectors of
      the new P.P. building to shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tradition, my lad, that's what it must be. I suppose these
      fellows still have some sort of pride in the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. supposed so too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Thomas did make a suggestion. If land was
      available, why not buy more of it now that the price was
      easy, and the lawyers were on the job? They were sitting
      side by side on the craftsman's dinner-plank under the
      shade of a beech tree, and Sir Thomas looked at the
      landscape, and found it more than good. It was a financial
      asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not take another ten acres, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should I do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit on it. What did you pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty pounds for my acre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lad, it's a gift. Besides, think of the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. looked puzzled, and Sir Thomas amused."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite see--I mean, this place should do for Kitty
      and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, yes. This is a unique spot, J. J. If I were you I'd
      have more of it and insure against interference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Question of capital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Besides, we shall have to be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas' kindly, porcine eyes twinkled at him. How
      innocent was science in the ways of the world! It would
      create all sorts of nice theories, and forget to budget for
      human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your idea of the future, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to forget one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you are a partner in the show. Have you ever troubled
      to ponder on what our profits may be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sweet babe! Do you know what my income is from my
      portentous pills?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Round about fifty thousand a year. P.P. Products may go
      bigger than that. Put it at sixty thousand in ten years.
      Your share would be about ten thousand a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s face was almost the face of an astonished boy. He
      had not contemplated such affluence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems rather incredible to you, J. J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's more than a possibility. You may be thinking in
      terms of a hundred acres, instead of in one. If you don't
      want to buy, I will, and hold it for you. What's the use of
      money if it doesn't give you space and elbow-room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While J. J. was arranging to dispose of the lease of No. 5,
      his neighbours were wondering how the little man earned a
      living. They saw him set out each morning at a very early
      hour, wearing a lounge suit and a soft hat, and carrying a
      little brown attaché case. Ellen was questioned by other
      maids who had been prompted by their employers' curiosity,
      and all that Ellen could say was that Mr. Pope was in
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny business!" said Dr. Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later years, J. J.'s neighbours were to remember their
      conjectures, and feel, somehow, that the little devil had
      fooled them. Who would have thought--Dr. Steel, who, behind
      a bland bedside manner, concealed the soul of a
      commercialist, would speak scathingly of the little
      outsider who had sold himself to the charlatans, and yet
      Dr. Steel was to be surprised and shocked by some of his
      patients dosing themselves with P.P. Products. They even
      dared to assert that these quack nostrums had done them a
      great deal of good. As for "Anodynia," Dr. Steel was to
      discover it in his wife's medicine cupboard, and lose his
      temper over the scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! You take that damned stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bloody rubbish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shut up, Charles. It has given me more relief than any
      of your prescriptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      So shocked and incensed was her husband that he snatched
      the bottle and threw it out of the window into the back
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the way I treat such muck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's rather wasteful. It will cost you two and
      sixpence when I buy a new bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me tell you, Florence, that if I find that stuff in
      the house--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you had better not look for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel would have been still more angry had he known
      that J. J. Pope received twopence on each bottle that was
      sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where did the little man go each Sunday? When Ellen was
      asked, she replied that Mr. Pope went down into Surrey. He
      was building a house in the country. Building a house!
      Where, the devil, did the money come from? Ellen rather
      enjoyed talking for effect and piling up the sensations.
      Yes, it was a wonderful new house, with radiators, and a
      garage, and grounds. Chellwood Terrace was puzzled and
      annoyed. When you have labelled a man as a crank and a
      failure, it is displeasing to the mediocre mind to discover
      an object of pitying contempt hatching out as an eagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. cared for none of these matters. They were below his
      purview. He was watching a little house grow and complete
      itself, and open its eyes to the landscape, and dry its
      feathers in the sun. His land was being fenced. His gate
      and Kitty's gate was up, nice and white and private, for
      this little house on the Surrey hills was giving to J. J.
      Pope that which he had always lacked, a sense of security,
      a happy corner which was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Ellen down with him one Sunday. Ellen was to
      criticise the kitchen economy, the stove, the sink, the
      cupboards, the larder. J. J.'s idea of a kitchen was that
      it should be an efficient and labour-saving sort of lab.
      Ellen was a pleasant person to take on such an expedition.
      She threw herself into the adventure, bounced into it,
      splashed and chattered. Wasn't the country lovely! But when
      Ellen saw the little red-brown house sitting on its grassy
      plateau, with the towering woods behind it, and that deep
      valley flowing below, she stood like a good countrywoman,
      stared and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. waited. Ellen drew a deep breath, appeared about to
      speak, and remained dumb. There was nothing to be said
      about that landscape. It was England.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and look at the kitchen, Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yessir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was to discover that country eyes were not city eyes,
      and that they saw or saw differently all that the city eyes
      did not see, but Ellen also had eyes for a kitchen. She
      stood in the middle of the floor, and slowly revolving,
      took in all the fittings in detail. Ellen was getting her
      bearings. If the kitchen table was just there, you had not
      to walk five miles for everything you wanted. You reached
      for the cupboard, and it was there; you took two steps to
      the right, and lo, the dresser and shelves were waiting for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo," said Ellen, "a woman must 'ave done this."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm the woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, one wants everything to hand. What do you think of
      the stove, Ellen? It was put in only on Friday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a marvel," said Ellen, and went to open the oven
      door. Yes, the oven had two stories, and was not like a
      great barrack of a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has it got a boiler?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. The hot water storage-tank is in that cupboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen went to look at the cupboard and boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice and handy for my linen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and look at the hot-water furnace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another one, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To warm the house. No, you won't have to stoke it. It's
      off the scullery. I shall have to have a gardener, I
      expect, and he'll do the stoking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen paused to look at the sink. She stood and rested her
      hands on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just my height, sir. Shan't get a crick in my back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's as it should be, Ellen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen had to go all over the house, and when she had seen
      it all she said: "Coo, won't the little missis be pleased!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When J. J. Pope went to Switzerland to bring his wife home
      he did a thing which he had never done before, he gave a
      dinner-party, and not at his own mild old hotel, but at
      Territet's colossal caravanserai, The Grand. At least, it
      appeared colossal to J. J. The guests were Madame La Jeune
      and Dr. Adler, and the wine was champagne. The Grand was
      very full of English who appeared formidably important in
      evening dress, but like so many of those who look
      somebodies, mostly they were nobodies. Neither J. J. nor
      Dr. Adler wore boiled shirts; J. J. was in a dark lounge
      suit, Dr. Adler in a frock coat. Doubtless their neighbours
      deemed them rather obscure and uncivilised persons, and it
      was a concession on the part of the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>
      to let them in at all, but Dr. Adler was a somewhat
      distinguished person, and on the Continent brains may
      matter more than boiled shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very happy meal. J. J. had taken Kitty down to
      Territet to buy a frock. It was a French frock, the colour
      of amber, and Kitty looked very exquisite in it, or so J.
      J. thought. Her soft skin had caught from the sun a
      delicate brown tint; her eyes were dark velvet, her hair
      matched her frock. J. J. was in a puckish, exultant mood,
      and he was rather new to champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of your patient, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler beamed like a little swarthy god.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does me credit, I think, yes, obviously."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked prettily self-conscious in the glow of such
      dual appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been so kind to me, everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame La Jeune smiled gently upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That has not been difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, J. J. and Dr. Adler took their cigars down to
      the lake and walked beside it in the moonlight. It was J.
      J.'s first cigar, and fortunately it did not disagree with
      him. Moreover, he would have preferred a pipe, but the
      lounge of "The Grand" had overawed him. Both men were
      pleasantly warm with wine, and J. J. was absorbing a new
      humanism, for Dr. Adler's philosophy was like the moonlight
      on the water and the mountain peaks beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not thanked you yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, when one's craft succeeds, it gives what
      you call thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was feeling secretly envious of the Swiss. What a
      good job was this, even though you did not always cheat
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask how you began?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler paused and looked across the lake, and in the
      moonlight his face had a sudden sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because life wounded me. Some wounds stay with one."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was silent, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened to me, as it happened to you, but in my case
      she did not recover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, sir, I did not mean to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Adler's fingers gripped J. J.'s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mind speaking of it. Some things make life seem
      real. I was just a hard young man of science. But to watch
      the struggle, to feel helpless, to see someone whom you
      loved, die. To meet the appeal in the eyes, and know that
      you are helpless. That, is the real revelation. Just naked
      emotion, and without emotion, mere cleverness can be the
      devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. stood very still. The voice of this other man seemed
      to be the voice of some other self. Nor, as they strolled
      back through the hotel garden had J. J. any words to utter.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty first saw the cottage when the beeches were beginning
      to turn colour. They drove over the hill from Yatley and in
      at the new white gate, and there both Ellen and the new
      home were waiting. The cabman got down to help Ellen in
      with the luggage, and J. J. and his wife walked to the edge
      of the grassy terrace which still was mottled with the
      builder's scars.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was anxious. He watched Kitty's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well soon change all this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the house and the burning beeches behind it
      under a watered-silk sky, and then she turned and looked at
      the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., how did you find it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Larcombe. Sits down nicely, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was casual, a man acutely self-conscious. Kitty faced
      about to meet the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been there for years. Isn't it wonderful to
      think it is ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not burying you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burying me! Just think, I shall get up each morning and
      see this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned again to the landscape, and suddenly her hand
      fluttered up, waving to it. She threw her head back, and
      her eyes laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night and good morning. Oh, J., now let's see the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman was waiting, for J. J. had forgotten to pay him,
      and while he felt in his pocket, he looked over his
      shoulder at Kitty, His eyes said: "Wait for me. I want us
      to go in together."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were oak seats in the porch, and Kitty sat down on
      one of them, the sunny one and waited. This going into the
      new home should be a hand in hand business. She swung her
      legs and sat with her hands tucked under her like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman was getting up on his box, and J. J. crossed the
      little strip of new gravel. He saw his wife sitting there
      as though she had been there always, and would be there
      always. How swiftly that which was not could become
      reality, just like a page turning in the book of Time!
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be said about Kitty's cottage, that the building and
      the garnishing of it had taught J. J. to do what Sir Thomas
      Pratten had dared to do as a younger man; take risks. In
      for a penny, in for a pound! All the new urges might be
      towards the safety first of State Socialism, a vast
      insurance scheme to provide that no one at any time should
      suffer anything. J. J., in his later years, was to be one
      of the last of the individualists, and anathema both to the
      Official Slave World and Enlightened Labour, because his
      altruism, being individual, was suspect, and therefore to
      be attacked and slandered. J. J. had built and furnished as
      an individual, who, having a new faith in his own material
      prospects, had spent lavishly and fastidiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was delighted and astonished. If the tribute was to
      her, and it was, she could thrill over these new carpets
      and gay curtains, the comfort and colour and gaillard
      spirit of her new home. No. 5 Chellwood Terrace was here,
      and so much more, lovely pieces of old furniture, china, a
      Madame Récamier couch, an old grandfather clock, panels of
      flowery needlework. The bright and polished efficiency of
      kitchen and bathroom piqued the woman in her. Had J. J.
      thought of all these things? And what a lot of money they
      must have cost!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., did you do it all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, the curtains and the carpets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I chose them. It became rather a hobby."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the bed with its yellow silk eiderdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have cost--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's worth it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's lovely. It takes my breath away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It mustn't do that. You see, my sweet, we shan't have to
      be so niggardly in the future. All this silly talk about
      money not mattering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it can give--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beauty and peace and space."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it mustn't spoil one."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some things may be incapable of being spoilt, but I'll
      remember the warning."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      From the very beginning of things Kitty loved her house,
      even though she had walked into it without any whimsies of
      her own. J. J.'s nickname for it did not satisfy her, so J.
      J. left her to choose its title, Beechanger or Weald View,
      which should it be? Beechanger became Kitty's choice, and
      it appeared on her new notepaper "Beechanger, Yatley,
      Surrey." J. J. soon surrendered the weekend idea. He bought
      for himself a small car, or rather P.P. Products Co.
      purchased it for him, and treated the outlay as part of the
      firms transport expenses. The journey to Edgeware took
      about an hour and twenty minutes, and J. J. left at eight
      in the morning, but in the winter he found night driving
      with oil lamps somewhat of an ordeal. They had engaged a
      gardener, one John Potter, and Potter was taught to drive;
      he took his master to Dewhurst each morning, and met him
      again in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden was their adventure during the early part of
      that winter. Kitty planned it, if her rather varied
      enthusiasms could be described as planning, and in spite of
      Potter's orderly soul, the Beechanger garden was and always
      remained a delightful mass of disorder. J. J. came to like
      it like that, a place from which Nature refused to be
      banished, even as she refused to be banished from human
      nature, in spite of the decrees of science. Weeds would
      continue, and plants, pushed into a strange environment,
      persist in dying, and pests remain parasitic, even as
      people fall in love with the wrong people, and drink and
      eat too much, or are lazy or stupid, and fall sick and have
      pains. Kitty had her terrace and her lawns and her
      rose-beds and her herbaceous border, her fruit and
      vegetables, and Mr. Larcombe, who liked her pretty face,
      gave her plants and advice and admiring glances. Kitty was
      taught to drive the car, and did so at weekends. She
      shopped at the old Yatley shop, and also in London. Twice a
      week she would travel to town with J. J. and enjoy herself
      in Oxford Street, and meet J. J. at Waterloo on the way
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty appeared to have forgotten that she had been a sick
      woman, but J. J. had forgotten nothing. England might be
      bearable until Christmas, but the dreariness of the long
      waiting for a spring which so often proved an illusion, had
      been very real to J. J. even as a child. To put it crudely,
      he had felt his stomach drop after Christmas, and March
      tornadoes had sometimes roused a raging impatience in him.
      J. J. wanted Kitty out of the country for part of her first
      winter. That glued-up patch of poison in her was too fresh,
      and his one dread was that it should break out once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to go to Menton for two months, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your first winter, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I feel so well. I don't want to leave everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so in earnest about it, and so profoundly concerned
      for her sake that she gave way. J. J. had been making
      inquiries, and it was Peter who was able to tell him of a
      unique, and funny little old hotel behind and above Menton.
      Sybil had been there. It was the Annunciata, perched on a
      ridge among olives, pines and flowers, with vine terraces,
      and looking into the red eye of the morning as the sun rose
      over the sea. This little white-faced, green-jalousied
      hotel gathered all the sunlight that the southern coast
      could give. It was reached by a funicular railway. It
      possessed peace. It gave you good and simple food, air,
      light, and tranquil nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Kitty, not because she wanted to go, but because J. J.
      wished it, travelled south in the middle of January under
      the care of a friend of Squire Larcombe's who also was
      going south. Happiness has strange sources, and J. J. felt
      happier when she had gone because, even in missing her, he
      felt more secure now that she was in the sunlight.
      Moreover, the Hotel Annunciata proved to be all that Sybil
      had said, and Kitty's letters were more than happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's simply wonderful, J. The sweet peas are out, and
      roses, and it's so warm in the middle of the day that you
      can lie in the sun. There's a lovely old monastery, empty,
      just by us, with great big cypresses. I can see the sea
      from my window. It is not like an English sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you come out for a fortnight?
    </p>
    <p>
      You'd love it"
    </p>
    <p>
      But J. J. could not spare the time. The P.P. Products Co.
      was getting into full production, and J. J. was working ten
      hours a day, and preparing to put "Anodynia" on the market.
      Mr. Hempstead was rubbing his hands over the mounting sales
      of Pepsonol. He had budgeted for a three years' campaign
      before results would begin to show in any magnitude, but in
      Pepsonol the P.P. Products Co. appeared to have struck oil.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much success may be as boring as too much sickness and
      too much old age, but both Kitty and her husband refused to
      be bored by it. "Anodynia" proved to be the most successful
      of the Company's products, and most astoundingly so, a Gold
      Goddess floating about the world, and showering upon her
      creator a rain of gold. J. J. would laugh over it and
      declare that he had given the working world a domestic
      anodyne, and that no one knew his name. At the end of the
      fifth year J. J.'s income was returnable at twenty-three
      thousand pounds or so per annum. The Inland Revenue was
      greatly interested in him. It did not regard him as a good
      citizen, but as a parasite to be plucked. It asked him
      through his accountant interminable questions, and gave him
      the impression that he was a rogue and a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. banked both at Dewhurst and in London. Kitty banked
      at Dewhurst, for J. J. handed over to her each year a wad
      of securities and she possessed an income of her own. When
      J. J. walked into his Dewhurst bank, the manager would come
      out to meet him, and either make polite conversation over
      the counter or invite him into his private room. The Yatley
      and Dewhurst Cricket and Football Clubs, and many other
      such bodies elected J. J. as a vice-president and held out
      naïve hands. He subscribed here and he subscribed there.
      The Dewhurst Hospital invited him to become a governor, but
      J. J. Pope, chuckling over his reputation as a charlatan,
      thought it discreet to refuse the honour, but he became a
      subscriber to the tune of fifty pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riches can become a serious complication, threatening your
      plan of living, and J. J. and Kitty, sitting in their
      garden one summer evening, and looking at all that
      loveliness that was England, spoke of this problem. Their
      life at Beechanger was tranquil and good, a working life in
      which mystery mattered more than money, for, both to J. J.
      and his wife life was a mysterious business tobe wondered
      at and explored. Beechanger was the same Beechanger, and
      the only change that had been made was the addition of a
      lab. built out at the back, and which J. J. had christened
      his playbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said J. J. to his wife: "Old Larcombe tells me that we are
      thought of as funny folk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny, dear! Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't exhibit our cash value. Don't you think you would
      like a bigger house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty turned her head to glance at her husband, and saw on
      his face the puckish, mischievous look she knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Why should I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that all women--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would only mean more bother, J. Aren't you happy here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Completely. It gives me peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, why should we alter things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just to present our neighbours an excuse for accusing us
      of showing off! But wouldn't you like a yacht?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A yacht? Whatever for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prestige. Or a villa on the Riviera? Or a house in town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty reached for his hand and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., I don't want our happy life here spoilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so peaceful. It's like the garden, not too big. And
      we have that landscape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. To look at without paying a penny. If you had six
      servants, and a butler, and six gardeners--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, J. What a lot of worry it would mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did what he had done so often, raised her hand and
      kissed it,a strange gesture for a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wise woman! I don't want to be a sort of social
      exhibit, Kit. I'm a worker. I want to be able to do my work
      in peace and obscurity. The only things that really matter
      to me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are my work and you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew his hand into her lap, and sat and looked at the
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a good man you are, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, good! Great Scott, no! I'm one of the most selfish
      devils that ever was. I'm just asking the question 'Why
      should we let our happy life here be spoilt by a damned lot
      of money, and all that it might land us in?' If you feel
      that way too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, J. Don't let us allow it to spoil things for us."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So determined were fate or providence or the incalculable
      play of circumstance to transform J. J. Pope into a
      plutocrat, that even tragedy took a hand in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Sybil were killed on the Stelvio Pass. How it
      happened no one but the instigator of the tragedy knew, for
      the German, crowding his big Benz round a blind corner, and
      striking Peter's near front wheel a glancing blow, had sent
      the English car through the low parapet and over the cliff.
      The dead and the wreckage were not discovered for a week,
      and then only by chance. Meanwhile, the German gentleman
      was back in Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's death was a lethal blow to old Tom Pratten. Nothing
      would deter him from going out to the scene of the
      accident, and J. J. went with him. They discovered little
      but the horror of the thing; those two fine creatures lying
      dead in the sun for a week, to be gathered up and hurried
      into the earth. The English consul responsible had done
      what he could, but the Austrian authorities had looked
      sympathetic and had shrugged their shoulders. Almost they
      had held expressive noses. The heat of summer and two
      disfigured, disintegrated corpses! What would you? Fire or
      Mother Earth. Earth had been the only elements that could
      conceal with decency that rotting flesh. Old Tom was
      shocked deep down in his vitals. With characteristic
      stubbornness he had persisted in driving up that mountain
      road, and standing where the gap in the low stone wall
      marked the site of the tragedy. Peter's red machine was
      still lying down below among the undergrowth and rocks, and
      looking like a squelch of fresh blood on the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a macabre end for two such splendid creatures! J. J.
      was shocked by it, and by the memories it seemed to
      tarnish. His Dark Lady of Dreams, and Peter the Lion left
      to--But that was a piece of fetid realism from which he
      shrank. Pathetic too was Sir Thomas' last whim. That
      wrecked machine was to be gathered up, packed, and railed
      to England. It should go to Peter's own works, and there be
      examined and be reported on by the experts. J. J. humoured
      his old friend, though refusing to believe that any verdict
      could be drawn from the twisted mass of metal. "Let 'em
      try," said the old man, and the car travelled home. Yet,
      strange to say, Peter's own car-tester who examined it, and
      who was grimly determined to prove both car and master to
      have been what he had known them to be, spotted a
      significant mark on the near front wheel and tyre. Mr.
      Peter had been driving downhill, had he? He would have been
      on the right side of the road. Something had struck that
      wheel, and turned him towards the wall. The wheel of
      another car? Yes, probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story ended there. Sir Thomas, insisting on being told
      the verdict, did with characteristic obstinacy determine to
      go out and discover anything more that could be discovered
      about the accident. Some other man had killed his son. A
      mad and hopeless journey it might be, and Sir Thomas
      Pratten was on the very point of starting when nature
      intervened. He was found dead in bed on the very morning he
      should have left Pollards. His heart had ceased beating
      while he slept.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To J. J. Sir Thomas Pratten had appeared to be one of those
      strong and vital persons who are immortal, and the
      suddenness of his passing was like a cliff-edge on a dark
      night. What would the new world be, and his own position in
      it? J. J. had never explored the future as it shaped at the
      moment; he was innocent of expectations, and when the
      nature of Sir Thomas' will was revealed to him, he was
      profoundly touched and astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of legacies, one to Kitty of ten
      thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for P.P. Products Co., Sir Thomas had willed such a
      proportion of his shares to his partner that J. J. should
      find himself in control of the concern, that is to say he
      would be the owner of just more than half the shares. The
      rest, in a previous will, had been left to Peter, but old
      Tom had had a codicil inserted after his son's death.
      Various proportions of these shares were left to his dead
      wife's relations, to Mr. Hempstead, to a number of his old
      employees, and to various charities. The market value of
      the £1 shares stood at 32/6d., and J. J. found himself a
      capitalist to the extent of some three hundred thousand
      pounds, and in control of the Company. The thing astounded
      him. Almost, it was melodrama. It gave him two restless
      nights, and a moment of panic. Not till he came to
      comprehend the full significance of this fortune did he
      begin to visualise all that it might offer him. Power,
      leisure, security, the authority to seek and to explore
      without any man being able to say him nay, the privilege to
      do good things in any way that might seem good to him. Did
      he exult? It must be confessed that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their first official conference Mr. Hempstead was
      secretly amused by his superior's solemn acceptance of the
      responsibilities of wealth. Plainly, Mr. J. J. Pope was
      perturbed, and perhaps just a little scared, but how
      peculiar to be afraid of an income that might amount to
      seventy thousand pounds a year! Mr. Hempstead, while
      regretting Sir Thomas, was not in the least worried by his
      own new dignity. He was more than a mere general manager;
      he held a solid personal interest in the business, and he
      was quite confident of its future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need for you to worry, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. raised his eyebrows. Was he worrying? Mr. Hempstead
      appeared to be in a paternal mood, and very well pleased
      with life, though he wore a black band on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lay the golden eggs, sir, we sell 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I such a goose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, sir, that was not my meaning at all. You, in a
      sense, are Pratten Products. You create 'em; we sell 'em.
      What I mean is, the management can relieve you of all
      routine worries. Besides, when a show like this gets going,
      it goes on going, only more and more so. We've got the
      public, and why? Because your preparations give the public
      what it wants. They'll go on doing it, and more and more
      so, provided we don't drop down on adverts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead was a good soul, if somewhat commonplace in
      his language and his ideals. He was trustworthy; he was
      capable, and yet J. J. could never quite escape from the
      feeling that he was in association with a red and beefy
      butcher slapping lumps of meat down on a marble slab with a
      heartiness that sometimes made you wince. Nor had J. J. any
      intention of allowing Mr. Hempstead to hack and slap just
      as he pleased. He knew just what horrid splurges Mr.
      Hempstead could perpetrate in the form of "Adverts." J. J.
      might be willing to leave the commercial side somewhat in
      the general manager's hands, but he was very determined
      that P.P. Products should not be Pratten Pills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we had better meet weekly, Mr. Hempstead. I should
      like you to submit to me the main details of the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see every advertisement before it appears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally, sir. This isn't a cheap-jack show. I take it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. My point is, Mr. Hempstead, that we shall strive
      to give and to give in a particular way, for what we get."
    </p>
    <p>
      Altruism, what! Mr. Hempstead stared at his superior rather
      like a bull glaring through a field gate at that
      incomprehensible and menacing creature, a small boy with a
      stick. The boy might be just a boy, only mischievous, or
      the stick might have a nail in it, and the nail might prick
      Mr. Bull's nose. Moreover, the gate stood between him and
      that baffling urchin whose master-intelligence might puzzle
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the kind of illusion which deceives large, beefy
      men. Because J. J. was a little fellow and the possessor of
      ridiculous legs, the large, bovine males believed that he
      could be butted over gates and hedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead confided his suspicions to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather think I am going to have trouble with the little
      fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hempstead was both right and wrong. In a very short
      time he was having no trouble at all with J. J., simply
      because he discovered that he was the bull in a yard, and
      that horribly intelligent and determined small boy held a
      stick with a very big nail on it. Mr. Hempstead had
      imagined that he would be P.P. Products Ltd., and that what
      he advised would be the law. J. J. Pope educated him into
      thinking otherwise.

      At a famous and expensive Scotch Hydropathic Establishment,
      where hydropathy was very much an afterthought, and people
      gathered to play golf and bridge, and to exhibit their
      success in the world to the world, it was the custom to
      spread yourself in the loggia and watch other people arrive
      by car. In fact the parade of cars on the vast semicircle
      of gravel below the terrace was a symbolic affair. A man
      was known by his car; he was judged by his car. Society and
      success were graded by the amount of money that had been
      expended upon the symbol of the chariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Charles Steel, plus wife, had come to Scotland in a 20
      h.p. Peerless. Dr. Steel was plus one at golf, and now
      senior partner in his firm. He wore very colourful Harris
      plus-four suits, and the air of a man who impressed all
      women. He and his wife had just brought a mixed foursome to
      a successful conclusion, and were taking tea in the loggia,
      when that rather shabby little car tottered up the majestic
      drive. It was a mere ten horse "Comet," with a rather faded
      hood, and brakes that squeaked when they were applied. Dr.
      Steel, eating buttered toast, and looking well buttered,
      watched a little man emerge from this very inferior
      vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh! See who it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife saw the object, but did not recognise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why that little squit who used to live opposite. Got
      himself defrocked for turning quack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't look very pontifical, does he? Patent medicines
      can't be paying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy him coming here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some cheek, what! Hallo, he's complete with wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty woman slipped out by the other door, and stood
      looking about her rather shyly, while her husband mounted
      the steps, crossed the terrace and entered the Holy Place.
      Over the door was written in invisible letters "Only those
      who have big bank balances may enter here." Mr. Pope
      interviewed a very superior lady in the office, and the
      superior lady became less so when she heard his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, sir, your suite is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have my luggage brought in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir. I'll ring for the luggage porter."
    </p>
    <p>
      An equally superior porter in green and gold followed J. J.
      out to the car, and having appraised its value, continued
      to be superior. Also, the luggage was none too new, three
      well-worn suit-cases and a hat box. And there were no golf
      clubs!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Booked your room, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Number Three."
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter stared, and for some strange reason became less
      superior. No. 3 was one of the most expensive suites in the
      Holy of Holies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Pope did not come down to take tea in the
      loggia. They had driven a long way, and both of them were
      tired. They had tea in their sitting-room, and Kitty, who
      had a headache, swallowed two tablets of Anodynia, and lay
      down to sleep. J. J., who had left the Comet on the gravel,
      went to drive it round to the garage where a very superior
      attendant in a white coat did not greet him and the car
      with any enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid were full up, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no you're not," said J. J., "a lock-up is reserved for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant cast an oblique glance at the vehicle. Why
      lock that up? Nobody was likely to pinch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope. Suite Number Three."
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic number had a peculiar effect upon the attendant.
      He became brisk, and oily, like his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir. Shall I put her away for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," said J. J. "I'll do it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove the car into the large white chamber where she
      looked like a mouse in a super-mousetrap. The attendant was
      waiting for the possible tip. He did not get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like her washed down, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you need trouble. My chauffeur will be
      coming up in a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      A chauffeur for that!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel liked to hold the stage in a somewhat Elizabethan
      manner, being a fine figure of a man, and colourful in his
      clothes. The terrace of the Holy of Holies might have been
      planned for so professional a swaggerer. Dr. Steel was the
      kind of man who, if he conceived the other person to be his
      inferior, and he considered most men his inferiors as
      males, would present one finger, nod patronisingly and say
      "How do." Charlie Steel had made up his mind to confront J.
      J. Pope in public, and snub him as he deserved to be
      snubbed. A little charlatan who had the impudence to
      present himself on such a stage needed a rebuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Dr. Steel in coffee-coloured jacket and plus fours,
      with green stockings and beautiful brown shoes, awaited his
      opportunity and took it. It was on the second day, and J.
      J. had appeared upon the crowded terrace to order tea and
      secure a table. Dr. Steel strolled up to him, hands in
      pockets, large and important.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, Pope, I don't suppose you remember me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. gave him a quick, upward look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a good many years since--"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was signalling to a waiter, and he ignored Dr. Steel
      for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find me a table, and get me tea for two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. turned again at his leisure to confront Charles
      Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still in Chelsea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much so, but rather more than Chelsea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kensington too, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a practice like ours--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Park Lane too, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the little devil trying to be facetious? Dr. Steel's
      rather bulging blue eyes became ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever regret the lapse, Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever use any of our products, Steel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They really are rather popular, you know, and might help
      you when you are posed for a prescription."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter was beckoning to J. J. He had found a table, and
      J. J. with a smiling nod at Dr. Steel, walked off to secure
      it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the humour had yet been squeezed from the occasion.
      Dr. Steel, sitting down with his golfing friends, put J. J.
      Pope in the public pillory. Could they see that little man
      over there? They could. Well, that was a gentleman who had
      been chucked out of the medical profession for turning
      quack. No, and the scandal did not appear to have brought
      him much in the way of cash. Had they seen his car? A
      decrepit old 10 h.p. Comet. It was a wonder that the
      doddering old bus had managed to travel so far. Dr. Steel
      elaborated his irony. He spoke of J. J. as "Sequah," and
      reminded his friends that that perambulating quack had
      employed a gilded coach and a brass band. He was supposed
      to have made pots of money, the scoundrel!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ladies was tactless. She asked Dr. Steel to tell
      her what firm J. J. Pope was interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A show called P.P. Products."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know. They make Anodynia. Really wonderful stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel looked shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, do you mean to say you dose yourself with that
      rubbish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as a professional man I ought to warn you that you
      may be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, but it suits me. Doesn't it, Guy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to, darling. By the way, Steel, did you say P.P.
      Products?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do happen to know that they are pretty big people,
      and that their research side--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I'm not interested," said Dr. Steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But later he was interested when a very sumptuous car slid
      noiselessly up the drive and drew up below the terrace
      steps. It was a Rolls coupe in pearl grey, and from it
      emerged a chauffeur in French grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, that's a posh bus. What lines! About the most
      expensive thing on the market."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she lovely," said one of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An aristocrat. Such perfect taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur was mounting the steps and looking about him.
      Someone rose from a table, and went to speak to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Miller, had a good journey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect, sir. And you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the old Comet got us here. You'll find her in the
      garage. I have a room for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can take the Comet back to-morrow, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the idea. The Rolls people are satisfied now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quite, sir. She's running as soft as silk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Steel was filling a pipe, and doing it as though the
      wretched thing had offended him. Two of his golfing friends
      exchanged smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have got it rather wrong, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" snapped Charlie Steel.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope's particular inspiration did not take actual
      shape until one of those occasions when he and Kitty
      celebrated. Kittv, like many happy women, was sentimental
      about dates, and anniversaries. She liked her birthday
      remembered, which it was, and the day of the year when she
      and J. J. were married. The peculiar thing about their
      comradeship was that they were set like two clocks to chime
      together, or cry "Cuckoo" in unison, and that they appeared
      to arrive at identical and simultaneous conclusions without
      any previous exchange of confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty would say: "Oh, J., when did you think of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been simmering for some time, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it has with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two anniversaries which J. J. Pope persisted in
      honouring, the one sorrowful, the other happy. Many people
      would have said that he was a silly little ass to bother
      about either after ten years of married life, but, after
      all, when your particular happiness is linked with certain
      events, there may be a profound wisdom in recalling them.
      J. J. had never forgotten the night when he had seen those
      sinister little bodies in the field of his microscope, nor
      had he forgotten the first night he and Kitty had spent
      together after Dr. Adler had given her back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been to Covent Garden to hear <i>Tristan und
      Isolde,</i> and had dined at Boulestin's, and were being
      driven homewards by Miller, when Kitty made her confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we are being awfully selfish, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, my sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do. I have been feeling it for a long time. We just
      come out and dine and hear lovely music, because we
      remember something that matters to us. It does matter to
      you, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have mattered in blood and tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, I was so afraid--then. What lots of people must
      be afraid, and can't find a way out, like we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat looking at the lights of the London streets, his
      arm resting in the sling of one of the upholstered straps.
      The movement of the car was an almost noiseless glide.
      Miller's fat and good-humoured neck showed through the
      glass screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, no way out. You have a wonderful way of expressing
      things, Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you always had. It is rather rare. We get so tied up
      with our insincerities and our affectations. I gather you
      have an idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have I. I wonder if they agree. You begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      While his wife was speaking, J. J. Pope watched the bitter
      and more obscure streets that made him think of dark canals
      with human shapes adrift in them. Yes, rather like frogs in
      a cistern whose sides were too steep and slippery for
      escape. What a wealth of silent anguish and despair must
      lie water-logged in this most rich city. But he was
      listening to Kitty, and hearing her gentle voice uttering
      almost the very words that had been troubling him for many
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've been so lucky, J. We have so much. I feel we ought
      to do something to help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those who couldn't find a way out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You found a way out for me. I've been so happy. I
      feel I'd like to try and pass on some of my happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just how, my sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we couldn't do it, of course, for many, but we might
      do it for some. I'm not being a little prig, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never would be that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to be goody-goody, and interfere with
      people's lives. I want to give some of them the chance I
      had."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J.'s hand snuggled its way under her velvet cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to hear my version?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember when I bought ten more acres of land? Well,
      something in me just said: 'Buy." I wondered at the time
      whether it was just land-lust. It seems now that it wasn't.
      And I am just being a copyist. Old Adler must have planted
      the seed years ago. It has taken a long time to germinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "J., you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little English Switzerland for a few of those who have
      what you had. That site below the pines is just the place
      for it. I suppose it would cost us about twenty thousand to
      build a small sanatorium which would house two or three
      dozen cases. Then there would be the equipping, and the
      staffing and the upkeep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, J., it is just what I have been thinking of!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There we go again! We must be about the most telepathic
      pair in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really mean to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. My idea is to take only early cases, where there is
      hope, and to think about the afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's no use setting people on their legs unless you
      can find them somewhere to walk to. Work that they can do.
      I see myself setting ourselves a devil of a lot of
      problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you could study the disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a way, yes. It has provoked me ever since you conquered
      it. But there's the snag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a doctor. I'm not allowed to be a doctor."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Such was J. J. Pope's inspiration. He would set up this
      living monument upon a hill as a thank offering, and a sign
      and a symbol. He could and did confess that he had been a
      hard little man, but that life had been merciful to him in
      sparing the one creature who was precious. This should be
      Kitty's show. Her idea was that the enterprise should be
      hers, endowed by him, but owned by her, if such an
      institution could be owned by anybody. Nor should it be
      christened a Sanatorium, or advertise the White Death to
      the Weald of Sussex. It should be a house, a rest house, a
      sunny and simple place like the woman who had inspired it.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. did much cogitating, and it was on Yatley Heath that
      the vision came to him. He had wandered up there to the
      familiar and venerable beech tree, and remembering the
      puckish paganism of his boyhood days, that escapade in the
      nude, he had seen his building rise in white stone. Why not
      a little classic temple upon a Surrey hill? Yes, why not?
      An Ionic portico, a long, low, peaceful façade with high
      windows, and outer ambulatories into which beds could be
      moved and patients lie or sit in the sun. This Rest Home
      for the sick would be sheltered by the beech and pine
      woods, high above the damp clay lands, and open to all the
      sun and air that an English sky could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke of his vision to Kitty she saw it as he saw
      it; a white temple on a hill with the high woods behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. approached a notable firm of architects, to discover
      in its most active partner an enthusiast for so human a
      phantasy as this. A classic temple on a Surrey hill! Well,
      Britain had not been a stranger to such temples, and after
      all J. J. Pope's temple could suggest Nash and the
      brilliant stateliness of his Regency mansions. Mr.
      Lancaster was Hymns Ancient and Modern. He had fallen for
      the flat roof, in that nicely concealed steel girders gave
      you more scope for spaciousness below. He would get out
      plans immediately if Mr. Pope would supply him with the
      necessary details as to accommodation that would be needed
      for patients and staff. When the plans had been passed they
      could invite tenders. And what sum did Mr. Pope propose to
      spend upon the place? Twenty thousand pounds. Mr. Lancaster
      would go into the matter and work out a rough estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that J. J. asked a significant question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we be--obstructed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lancaster raised black eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obstructed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my experiences have been somewhat stormy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, surely, a humane idea like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at Mr. Lancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humanity can be so inhumane in its prejudices."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lancaster twiddled a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are people who might object to a Rest House in the
      neighbourhood. The--amenities--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lancaster nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreadful word. Yes--but I don't think any such protest
      could persuade authority to veto so humane a project as
      this."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lancaster was right and he was wrong. J. J. let it be
      known through Mr. Larcombe, who was the most garrulous of
      men, that a rest-house for consumptives was to be built at
      Beechanger. There was opposition from certain people who
      even proposed to go to law about it; people whom the
      Ferocious Idealists described as Vested Interests. J. J.
      was to grow tired of that squawk. Why not Shirted Interests
      for a change? P.P. Products possessed a super-shirt, and
      was going to stick to it. When, in the future, the Loud
      Levellers asked the world why there should be First Class
      carriages, J. J. had his answer pat--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because there will always be first class minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. Pope was not quite the social outcast that he had
      been, but a little autocrat with the sense of humour and a
      most potent purse. He had come to possess eminent friends,
      even in the Profession, humanists who also had a sense of
      humour, and who could appreciate the esoteric significance
      of J. J. Pope's non-conformity. Moreover, some members of
      the Profession had fallen so far below Charlie Steel's
      standard that they were prescribing P.P. Products for their
      patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      How ironical was this.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The white rest-house on the hill was coming to life, and
      one evening J. J. Pope attended a dinner of the "Omnibus
      Club." He had been elected a member, which was a tribute to
      the club's tolerance, though the "Omnibus" was like its
      name, a vehicle containing all sorts and conditions of men.
      It was neither political nor social. In fact politics were
      taboo. And on this particular evening J. J. found himself
      seated between Sir Hereward Mollison and Max Gulliver--wit
      and journalist. Sir Hereward was a very serene and stately
      gentleman with a fine head of white hair, Max Gulliver
      rather like an intelligent and ironic chimpanzee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good dinner and good company, and men grew warm
      with wine and wit. J. J. happened to mention his project to
      Sir Hereward, and Sir Hereward was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--Rest House, Mr. Pope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir--more welcoming, less melancholy. Adler of
      Geneva taught me something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree. The serene spirit that maketh well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is one snag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might find myself in trouble with your people. A
      defrocked doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hereward smiled through the smoke of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not quite so--Old Testament, Mr. Pope. Besides, you
      could--obviate that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By employing a resident physician. You might even find a
      man who was T.B. himself, and needed a light job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an idea, sir. Thank you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I happen to be on the G.M.C. I rather think I should
      father such an enterprise as yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. I take that very kindly from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Gulliver had been listening, and he joined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one of the most humane ideas I have heard of for a
      long time, Mr. Pope. There's imagination in it. I'd like to
      write it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. wanted to say "For God's sake, don't," but he walked
      more softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you. But just at present we are in the
      constructive stage. Besides, I don't want to raise false
      hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just how?" asked the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we shall be quite a small show, and we shall have to
      pick our patients, those for whom there is reasonable
      hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Gulliver was quick of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I see the point. Publicity might
      be--embarrassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. One might have to disappoint a number of poor
      devils."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hereward looked at him benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask--how this idea came to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes. My wife had T.B. and recovered. This is a kind
      of thank offering."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope's Whited Sepulchre" as some unkind people called it,
      was rising on its Surrey hillside, and as it neared
      completion inquisitive persons passing along the valley
      road would look up towards Beechanger, and discover this
      new white building brilliant against the woodland. New it
      might be and shining like some Greek temple, but its lines
      and proportions were so perfect and its setting so verdant
      and serene that even hyper-sensitive cultivators of the
      picturesque could find no offence in it. Motorists in
      search of tea might ask: "Is that an hotel up there?" and
      when told that it was a sanatorium, they would pass on and
      think no more of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of staffing the hospital was proving something
      of a problem. J. J. found his matron through the
      sympathetic help of Sir Hereward Mollison who came down to
      see the building. It was his suggestion that J. J. should
      advertise for a resident M.O. who had been a sufferer, and
      who might be sympathetic and interested and glad of an easy
      post. J. J. took Sir Hereward's advice, and got his man; a
      gentle but efficient creature misnamed Slaughter, who was
      unmarried, and to whom Beechanger made an instant appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the nursing staff? Could any women be persuaded to come
      to so solitary and Arcadian a spot?
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Miss Byng--the prospective matron: "Leave it to me,
      Mr. Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. left it to her with excellent results.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Rest House was to contain two wards for male and female
      patients, and ten small rooms for particular people, for J.
      J. was wise in feeling that you could not mix new wine and
      old. The more primitive creatures liked company and
      chatter, the more advanced and separative asked to be
      alone. J. J. as a separatist, understood all this. The two
      wards were to be christened "Jane Pope" and "Pratten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beechanger might be a house of mercy, but discipline was to
      be stringent, for the safeguarding of the staff. J. J. and
      Dr. Slaughter evolved a code of hygiene and produced a list
      of "Musts and Must Nots." The ignorant among the patients
      were not to be suffered to spit as they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dr. Slaughter who put to J. J. that pregnant
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of the afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, what of the afterwards? He had been able to give
      Kitty protection and care. And Slaughter, fresh from his
      own somewhat bitter experience as a G.P. in the industrial
      Midlands, had been confronted by the terrible afterwards.
      Man had to work and live, and in working
      competitively--doom himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have given me my chance, sir. What of the others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's going to be a problem, Slaughter. We shall
      have to solve it somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has never been solved yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps because no one gave sufficient thought to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall of his lab. J. J. tacked up a reminder:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember the Afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years to come he was to solve that problem, so far
      as his own patients were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was a man of memories, and he had a liking for
      reverting to them both in fancy and in fact. On his way
      back from Edgeware he might tell Miller to diverge towards
      some familiar corner of the city, and leaving the car, go
      wandering. It was in the winter more than in the summer
      that these reminiscent moods were persuasive, for, somehow
      the sinister shabbiness and the secret shames of the dim
      streets moved him to a profound thankfulness. Life had been
      merciful to him, and in savouring these strange contrasts
      he could remember what might have been and what was. Down
      yonder on a Surrey hill peace and a serene and happy face
      waited for him. Here, in the bitter streets, an eternal
      question challenged him--"What if I had lost her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Man may walk blindly towards some extraordinary
      coincidence, and in the dreary dusk of a dead October day
      J. J. had stood looking at the windows of Unicorn Place,
      and then passed on to revisit Mortimer Mews. There was a
      difference here, less dung and less fresh paint, more
      shabbiness, fewer children. Mortimer Mews appeared to have
      lost its vulgar music-hall gaiety. There was no window-box
      in that particular and beloved window. Two frowzy women
      were squabbling in an open doorway. A melancholy man in
      long boots and a jersey was washing down a taxi-cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was wondering whether Joe Clements still lived in
      Mortimer Mews when he saw the Clements door open and Joe
      himself appear. J. J. walked up the grey cobbled alleyway
      and found himself smiling at a Joe who was more grey, and
      lean and bent in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Joe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if it ain't you, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe's mouth shaped itself as though he was about to spit,
      but he refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not too--good. Things a bit upside down. Them damned
      motor mouse-traps."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were on the taxi-cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      "New world, Joe. Engines instead of horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not 'alf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still keep a horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus--I do. Can't cotton to a bloody tin box on wheels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gettin' old and set, I reckon. Besides, I've lived with
      'orses all my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. understood. Joe was a conservative soul, and
      suffering for it both in temper and pocket, and Joe's
      prejudices might be more valid than he knew. The petrol
      engine was to be the harbinger of a greater beastliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. glanced up at Kitty's window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyone living there now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Joe did spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus. Seedy sort of bloke with a cough. Come down in the
      world--I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was feeling in a waistcoat pocket. He produced a
      sovereign and was in the act of passing it to Joe, when the
      door across the way opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank yer, sir. That's 'im. Bit of a change, what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. saw a shabby figure in black emerge with a suggestion
      of surreptitious and apologetic deliberation. It looked to
      the right and to the left. It closed the door carefully and
      locked it. It pulled an old black hat well down over its
      long and emaciated face. It was a figure of fear, of shabby
      subterfuge, of defeat and of social effacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the starved thing began to cough, and to stand
      palsied with the spasm. It leaned against the wall, head
      down, one hand groping in a side pocket. It produced a
      dirty handkerchief, and stuffed it against its mouth, and
      when the soiled plug came away J. J. saw the stain upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. was shocked, not only by the creature's anguish, but
      by an almost incredible coincidence. The man leaning
      against the wall was Crewdson, the fellow who had led the
      ducking party in St. Jude's Great Court on that night in
      May.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two J. J. hesitated, and in that short
      period of time he was posed by contrasts in emotion, or
      rather by the symbolic thought-concept of what he might be
      feeling. Had he no justification for gloating over the
      sinister shabbiness of this poor sick crow? He had--and
      yet--That which he felt was compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me a moment, Joe. It is a most strange business,
      but I used to know that fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the yard. Crewdson was head-down, and leaning
      against the wall as though exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it Crewdson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The starved goat-like profile came full face. The eyes were
      narrow slits, suspicious, fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you don't remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Those strained eves stared like two dark slits in a tragic
      mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God--the--J. J. Pope!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson appeared to shrink back against the wall
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go to hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to cough again, and the paroxysms smothered that
      last flicker of defiance. The dirty handkerchief came out,
      and again J. J. saw blood upon it. What a different
      Crewdson was this, the shabby, sneering sensualist smudged
      into this poor sick scarecrow. How had it all happened? But
      did that matter? The immediate problem was the martyrdom of
      man, whatever man had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to be in bed--Crewdson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The white face seemed to spit the word at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fellow has to live--or try to."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. touched Crewdson's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, you get back inside and lie down. Got a
      doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. What's the use of doctors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along in. Is there anybody to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the most tragic thing of all happened. Crewdson
      turned to the wall, crushed his hat against it, cringed,
      and began to weep, the dreadful tears of a broken man. J.
      J. stood there beside him, profoundly shocked by this other
      man's anguish. What was to be done about it? Something had
      to be done about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crewdson--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, leave me alone, can't you. What's the use of fussing?
      I'm done for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. Come along inside. You ought to be in
      hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Well, come along inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. turned and beckoned to Joe Clements across the way,
      and the cabman joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Mister. Mr. Pope's right. Got your key?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson groped for it, and handed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shades of "Nanette" and pansy-flowered hats, but what a
      change was here! J. J.'s lab. was the Crewdson
      keeping-room, and almost empty of furniture. There was no
      fire, and dirty crockery decorated the table. Joe and J. J.
      helped Crewdson up the narrow stairs leading to that
      familiar room, now no more than a sick man's piggery. The
      bed was unmade, and the tousled sheets looked as though
      they had not been laundered since the Creation. The window
      was shut and the room smelt stale and septic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again J. J. was shocked. Memory held a fastidious
      nose. This little room that had been so clean and flowery!
      Crewdson had flopped down on the bed, his black hat crushed
      over his eyebrows. The dirty handkerchief was at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. nodded at the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Joe. I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clements took the hint and left them, and J. J., sitting
      down on an insecure bedroom chair, looked at the man who
      had humiliated him. Extraordinary situation! Was Crewdson
      to be Beechanger's first patient?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here--Crewdson--you can't stay here. Listen to me. I
      am opening a sanatorium next week. Yes, down in Surrey.
      I'll send an ambulance for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson, head down, handkerchief to mouth, seemed to
      shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--why the devil--should you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Just because you're a sick man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it--I haven't a bean. Was just going out to pawn
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't matter. We don't charge fees. Now, you get
      into bed and stay there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson, head down, handkerchief to mouth, seemed to
      shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might light the gas for me. Haven't cut me off that yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. got up, produced a box of matches, and lit the gas
      jet. He saw that there was a gas stove. He lit that also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any food in the place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson nodded sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, enough for a night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. I'll send Joe Clements in with some milk and eggs.
      The ambulance will be here with a nurse to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, Crewdson's old insolence flashed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Tad. An occasion for crowing--what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Life isn't just a dung-heap, man. You get into bed and
      lie still."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The car climbed Yatley Hill. J. J. had been lying back in
      his corner, a very thoughtful J. J., but as the car topped
      the hill he saw the full moon shining above the dark trees.
      Full moon! Strange and mysterious old luminary, somehow
      like life, calculable, yet never quite familiar. And what a
      strange business! Crewdson down in the dirt, and
      impregnating that happy room with a pathetic, nauseating
      foulness. Poor, shabby devil! J. J. bent forward to look
      squarely at the face of the moon. He thought: "I must buy
      that place, and have it cleaned up. Yes, papered and
      painted. Can't let it stay fouled like that." For the
      cottage in Mortimer Mews still had the face of Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. sat smoking by the fire. They had dined and Kitty lay
      on the sofa, holding a book which she was pretending to
      read, because she had been challenged by her husband's
      face. She was wise as to these silent moods of his, and
      left them undisturbed, because she knew that J. J.'s
      silences were creative.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. J. took his pipe from his mouth, and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something once happened in my life which I never told you
      about. Not going to tell you now. But I have had the most
      amazing experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened like this. I felt like going to see some of
      the old places, and I strolled along to Mortimer Mews to
      look at your window. Found Joe Clements still there, and
      while we were chatting a man came out of--our--place." He
      paused for a moment, biting hard on his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a down-and-out, and sick, desperately sick. It
      doesn't seem quite credible, but I recognized him. He was a
      man who had tried to humiliate me when I was up at
      Cambridge, a sadistic sort of beast--and there he
      was--coughing his soul out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was sitting up, her arms about her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do, J.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoke to him, got him upstairs into--your--room. And what
      a room! He is going to be our first patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--J.--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sending an ambulance for him to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty left the sofa, to kneel by J. J. and put an arm round
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would do--that--darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--well--I suppose a revengeful man might have gloated.
      Couldn't somehow. If you and life have taught me
      anything--it's the healing inevitableness of compassion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty drew his head down, and kissed him just where he was
      beginning to grow grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a--great man, J."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--but I think I'm a grateful one."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson never came to Beechanger. When the ambulance
      called for him next morning they found the place locked up.
      It was Joe Clements who produced a ladder and climbed up to
      Kitty's window, rapped on the glass and shouted. There was
      no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crewdson lay dead. He had gassed himself.
    </p>
