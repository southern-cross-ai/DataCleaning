  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I. &mdash; FAIR FLOWERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the fresh young vigour of an April sun, the world has a
  cheerful aspect, and is doubly bright, and vastly warmer, when beheld through
  good flint-glass. Especially while the east winds hold, which never now
  forget to hold the spring of England, heart and throat. But forty years ago,
  there were some springs of gentle quality.</p>

  <p>Upon a pleasant April morning, of the sweet inconstant kind, such as we
  vainly sigh for now, a gardening man, with a quick step, came into his happy
  greenhouse. A door from his favourite sitting-room led into this still more
  favoured place; and the smile with which he entered showed that he expected
  to find pleasure here. It was a long, low, span-roof house, with no
  side-lights, and very simple, not even framed with rafters. Yet snug from
  violence of wind, and bright with every sunbeam; this humble house was rich
  with joy, for all who love good health, and peace.</p>

  <p>Here, were the sweet obedience, and the gay luxuriance of the vine; than
  which no lovelier creature grows. Broad leaves, spreading into pointrels,
  waved and cut with crisp indenture, coving into, or overlapping, the ripple
  of each other; clear round shoots, cresting up like swans, and sparkling with
  beads of their own breath; infant bunches, on the bend as yet, but promising
  to straighten, as the berries got their weight; some bravely announcing
  grapes already, some hoping to do so before nightfall, through the misty web
  of bloom; others only just awaking into eyes of golden dust; yet all alike
  rejoicing, shining, meeting the beauty of the early sun, and arousing their
  own to answer it.</p>

  <p>And here was a multitude of pretty things as well, that will not be
  chambered with the vine too long, yet gladly accept a kind lift upon the road
  from winter to summer, which her auspice yields. Boxes, and little tubs, and
  pots, and pans, and frames of willow, and biscuit-cases, were cropped with
  growth in different stages, and of divers orders, through all the innumerable
  tones of green, and all the infinite variety of form. But all, to the keenest
  human eye, brisk, and clean, and in their duty.</p>

  <p>The man, who had shaped these things, and led them (under the Maker's
  loftier will) was coming to them now, with a cheerful heart, and faith in his
  own handiwork. The finest gardener, that ever grew, knows well that he cannot
  command success, and has long survived young arrogance. Still he continues to
  hope for the best; for the essence of the gentle craft is hope, rooted in
  labour, and trained by love. So this man took a short taste of the air,
  glanced at the glass, and the glitter of the vines, and felt the climate of
  the house, as keenly as if he were a plant therein. For the moment, there was
  no fault to find. Genial warmth was in the air, and gentle dew on every leaf;
  in the slope of early sun through glass, no harsh heat quivered, and no
  fierce light glared; but morning-tide spread all soft herbage with a silvery
  tissue.</p>

  <p>"Now I like to see things look like this," said the man, as he very well
  might say; "but here are at least a score of bunches crying aloud for the
  thinning scissors. And where is Rose, who ought to be at them, before the sun
  gets up too high? Rose of roses, where are you?"</p>

  <p>To his cheerful shout no answer came; and being of a well-contented mind,
  he went on to his own business. His happy nature found its province in
  promoting happiness, whether of beast, or bird, or life whose growth is its
  only movement. To all of these he felt that loving-kindness, which is
  nature's gift; not the brightest of her graces, but the largest, and the
  best. Without that one redeeming gift, of which grand intellects often fail,
  this man being sorely tried in life, would have passed into the bitter vein,
  so miserable to itself, and all. His face had the lines of resolute will, and
  of strenuous energy; and his bodily force was but little abated by three
  score years of exercise. For his back was as straight as a soldier's on
  drill; his legs were stout and steadfast; and although he fed well, and
  without anxiety, none but envious whipper-snappers would have dared to call
  him fat.</p>

  <p>For the other part, his mind was not disagreeably large or noble; but just
  in front, by the proper peg, of the general mind it met with. The general
  mind, that is to say, of educated people, at any rate in that part of the
  world, which is as wise as any other. "Captain Larks" (as this good stranger
  had been called by the native voice, when first he came to Christowell) was a
  simple, unpretentious man, who gave himself no title. His only desire seemed
  to be for plain life, and retirement.</p>

  <p>These he surely might here obtain, to the utmost of all heart's desire; so
  far away was Christowell from busy mart, or town, or street, or even road of
  carriage power. No better place could have been discovered by a man sincerely
  desirous of dealing as little as possible with mankind. For here were people
  enough to make a single head no rarity; yet not enough to force any sort of
  head into grievous eminence. All the inhabitants, without exertion, were
  important enough to feel satisfied; or at any rate to feel the duty of it;
  while universal opinion stopped any man from indulging in his own. It may be
  denied by young spread-eagles, of competitive and unruly mind, that this is
  the highest form of human life. But such an one should soar aloft, and perch
  upon some higher one.</p>

  <p>To Christowell, ambition was no more than a longer name for itch. Every
  village-man grew wiser by due seniority; and no mind, while its father lived,
  succeeded to authority. Youth was kept in its place, and taught that the ear
  must take the seed of thought, until the white hair shows it ripe; and women
  were allowed their proper weight.</p>

  <p>"Christowell is all very well," the gardener went on thinking; "but if
  ever there was a slow place under the sun, it is one of the slowest. Pugsley
  will never bring my pots."</p>

  <p>Making up his mind to the manner of mankind, with a cultivator's patience,
  he passed beneath clusters encroaching on the headway, and went into a tiny
  transept, parted from the rest of the house, by a narrow door of glass. Here
  was a separate shrine for flowers, intolerant of heat, and demanding air,
  beyond the young vine's capacity. Choice geraniums lived here, and roses,
  heaths, and epacrids, and double violets, lilies of the valley (sweetest of
  all bloom), Daphne, and the graceful deutzia, pansies also, freaked with
  velvet braid, the double black polyanthus, and the white chalice of azalea.
  But best, and dearest of all to him, and set in a separate nook&mdash;as in a
  glazed bureau with lifting glass&mdash;that exquisite flower of exclusive
  worship, that gorgeous instance of nature and art combined to do their
  utmost, the magically beautiful auricula.</p>

  <p>No gardener is worth his manure, who has not a fine conceit of his own
  skill. "I should like to have some of those Lancashire fellows, or a few of
  those Kentish braggarts here," this man said aloud, being apt to encourage
  his thoughts, when alone, with the company of words; "if I know anything of
  the matter, this green-edged seedling, beautifully named 'Dartmoor Oasis,' by
  my Rose; and this grand self, one could gaze at all the day; and above all
  this white-edge, this glorious white-edge, worthily entitled 'Cream of
  Devon,'&mdash;have they anything fit to hold a candle to them? Consider the
  paste, take the measure of the thrum, dwell upon the band; can you spy a
  single slur? Above all, if you have a particle of judgment, observe the
  equality of the pips, the perfection of fulness, and true circle of the
  truss, and the grand, columnar, mealy, magnificent, staunchly upright, and
  splendidly proportioned&mdash;really you might say, pillar of the stalk!"</p>

  <p>Overpowered, alike by his eloquence, and the beauty that produced it, he
  stopped for a moment, with some gravel in his hand (with which he was going
  to top-dress his pots), when the little door was opened, and his Rose came
  in; whose presence, might compel the wildest gardener to despise his own
  auriculas.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER II. &mdash; POTTER'S VESSELS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To a mind with limited powers of inquiry, such as most of us
  are blest with, a great truth stands forth in robust relief, without being
  bound to show what it stands on, or where it came from, or anything else. In
  this frank spirit must be accepted the incontestable fact that "Latham" (an
  ancient and very good surname) takes, upon the ordinary tongue of Devon, the
  brief, but still excellent form of "Larks." It made no difference, from their
  lofty point of view, that the Captain's name was not "Latham" at all, any
  more than he called himself a captain; but when he first appeared among the
  natives of this part&mdash;some fifteen years ago perhaps&mdash;his rather
  scanty luggage was ticketed "L. Arthur," in flowing and free manuscript. The
  leading genius of Christowell&mdash;a premature intellect now removed from
  the stabs of contumely, to higher claims&mdash;pronounced at a glance that
  the word spelled "Latham;" whilst some, almost equally capable of reading,
  confessed, and some denied it.</p>

  <p>The landlord of the <i>Three Horse-shoes,</i> who could not sign his name
  (though he drew three horse-shoes, at the bottom of a bill, more correctly
  than many an artist could), at once backed up the decision of the wit, and
  settled the question, by declaring that his guest had the very same walk, all
  over the world, as Corporal Larks to Teigncombe had. So before Mr. Arthur was
  one dinner-time older, he came forth upon the public as "Captain Larks;" and
  finding that people only shook their heads, and looked very knowing, if he
  said another word, he let them have their way, until his ears and mind grew
  used to it.</p>

  <p>Through an agent at Exeter, whose name was "Tucker," a neat little
  cottage, and some twenty acres of land near the moor, had been bought for him
  cheaply. Then the cottage was furnished very simply; and here he hoped to
  spend in peace, and solitude, his remaining days.</p>

  <p>As yet, there was not a grey hair on his head, though his face bore marks
  of evil climate, and uncourteous usage, in deep-grained sunburn, and scar of
  steel, permanent in three places. This, and a pair of shaggy eyebrows, gave
  him a formidable aspect, much against the meaning of his mind. But eyes of a
  soft bright blue, as clear as a child's, and a nose of genial turn, and a
  really pleasant and hearty smile, showed plenty of good-will towards mankind,
  whatever man might have done to him. Moreover, his large and well-knit frame,
  active step, and resolute bearing, commanded the good word of womankind, the
  better half of the entirety.</p>

  <p>Then Parson Short, becoming now prime minister of Christowell, said his
  say about Captain Larks, which was to the purpose, as usual. "Under a
  cloud&mdash;fine fellow by his face&mdash;gentleman, according to his speech
  and manner. He wants to be quiet; it is none of our business. Let him alone,
  till he comes to us."</p>

  <p>The settler asked for nothing better than this course of treatment. The
  stir of his arrival soon settled, like himself, into gentle quietude; the men
  of the village were kind and respectful&mdash;as men still are in
  Devonshire&mdash;and the women, though longing to know more about him, felt
  for him deeply as "the lonely gentleman," and hoped he would get over it, and
  have another wife.</p>

  <p>Whatever his trouble, he sought no pity, nor even appeared despondent; but
  lived upon his bit of land, and worked, and whistled among his trees, as
  sweetly as the blackbirds that came to answer. In spite of his maturity, or
  perhaps by reason of it, many a village girl, too young to dream of any
  courting&mdash;except in dim wonder at the number of the
  babies&mdash;resolved to be his wife, as soon as time should qualify her, and
  came up the steep hill, every fine evening, to peep through the hedge at him,
  and perhaps to get an apple. He, having love of children, as of all things
  that are natural, would rest from his work, and come out at the stile, and
  pat their curly heads, and ask the history of the babies, and cut for them
  chips, with his pruning-knife, from a big stick of liquorice in his waistcoat
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Whether he had kith or kin, or any soft belongings, was a moot point at
  the Churchyard gate, and by many smouldering peat-fires; until, about four
  years after his coming, a lively, and lovely, little girl was delivered at
  his gate, by Tim Pugsley, the carrier. Tim went round about it, as a fox goes
  to his hole, and avoided the village on his way from Moreton; but in spite of
  all that, they were spied by a woman with a bundle of furze at the top of the
  cleve; and when human nature, with five shillings in its pocket, compelled
  Master Pugsley to pull up and bait, at the <i>Three Horse-shoes,</i> upon his
  homeward course, he had no call so much as to change his crown; so liberal
  was the desire to treat him, for the sake of the light that he could shed.
  The grateful carrier first drank his beer, then shook his head, as vehemently
  as if it had been labelled "glass with care;" and then enlightened the
  company with a piece of news beyond all price&mdash;"Every man should first
  tend his own business."</p>

  <p>For nine or ten years, every summer, and weighing more upon each delivery,
  this consignment came to pass; and Pugsley (like his cart-tilt, which was of
  some high new patent stuff) grew dryer and dryer, every time he was wetted;
  till Christowell understood at last, that if anybody was to blame, for
  keeping the parish so unsettled, it was no less a person than the famous
  Bishop of Exeter. For Pugsley told them to go to the bishop, if they wanted
  to know all the rights; and the next confirmation in that neighbourhood was
  largely attended by fathers and mothers. It did them good to be confirmed
  again, because of their principles wearing out; and the landlord of the inn
  was pleased with the evening they spent after it.</p>

  <p>Thus when Rose came down at last, "to have holiday for ever" (as she told
  Mr. Pugsley, every time he stopped to put a stone behind the wheel), there
  was scarcely any one in Christowell old enough to rejoice, who failed of that
  most Christian duty. The captain for once came out of his garden, and made a
  great bonfire of his weeds upon the beacon, and with his own hands rolled up
  a great barrel of cider unknown to the natives, whose ignorance culminated
  towards their heads. For he now grew apples of a lordly kind, which they
  (having faith in their grandsires only) disdained, till it turned the tables
  on them.</p>

  <p>Almost everybody said, that night, or else on the following morning, that
  for certain sure, such a lively maid could never abide in a place like that.
  Or if she did, she must soon go doiled&mdash;so tarble weist, and crule unkid
  as it was. For according to the way Captain Larks held his head up, in spite
  of demeaning himself now lately, his daughter must count upon having to
  behave like a lady, and not going to and fro, and in and out with the other
  young folk, as the butcher's, and grocer's girls might do.</p>

  <p>And who was there likely to ask her in marriage, or to take her to dance,
  or a fairing, or a club, comely as she was, and so nice-spoken? Why, Parson
  Tom Short was the only gentry-man, unless you went so far as Touchwood Park;
  and if ever there was a set bachelor in the world, Parson Short was one of
  them; let alone that his hair was all going from his poll, and his cook, Mrs.
  Aggett, would have no young doings.</p>

  <p>Up to the present time, however, though nearly two years were gone by,
  Rose Arthur had complained to no one, of discontent, or loneliness. Her
  father, and her work, and books, sufficed to her for company; and her lively
  nature filled itself with interest in all things. She knew everybody in the
  village now, and every flower in the garden; and her father's lonely life was
  blessed by her young enjoyment of the world.</p>

  <p>Pugsley (who lived at Moreton, and traded twice a week from Exeter, when
  the weather and the roads encouraged him) now began to find his horse wink
  one eye, at the turn towards Christowell. So many trifles went to and fro,
  and some boxes that made the axle creak, and some quite large enough to sit
  upon. Even before this, he had taken mauns of plants, and baskets of choice
  pears, and grapes, to Exeter; when the captain began to "demean" himself in
  the village esteem by traffic. But now the commerce increased, and throve, as
  Rose threw her young life into it.</p>

  <p>If Pugsley had been a small-minded man, he must have gone promptly to
  Tavistock fair, and bought a new horse, to attend to this traffic; for his
  ancient nag, whose name was "Teddy," began to find the hills grow steeper, as
  the weight of years increased. But the carrier was of gentle tone, and
  largely generous sentiments; and hours of reflection made him wipe his head
  with loftier feeling. Therefore he would not deny his good neighbours the
  pleasure of benevolence, but allowed them to lend him a horse as often as
  they wished, and sometimes oftener.</p>

  <p>Now Teddy was crawling up the hill, that beautiful April morning, with the
  long-desired load of pots. Three-quarters of a mile of jagged lane, or
  sometimes of roaring watercourse, led from the village to "Larks' Cot," as
  irreverent people called it. At best, and even for a fresh young horse, it
  was a tough piece of collarwork; but Teddy, ancient though he was, would
  never have grumbled, if the lane had been wide enough for corkscrew. But in
  this part of Devon, the rule of the road is, to make it just wide enough for
  one cart, and a cow to go past it without losing milk. If two carts meet, one
  must back to a gateway; and whether of the twain shall back, depends upon the
  issue which of the drivers is "the better man."</p>

  <p>Therefore this Teddy had a hard time of it&mdash;a long pull, a strong
  pull, and worst of all, a straight pull. And while he was pausing, to pant,
  and to think, and his master whistled softly, Jem Trickey the cobbler came
  merrily down a steep place, and stopped to look at them.</p>

  <p>"Marnin' to 'e, Tim," shouted Trickey, for his breath was as "plim" as a
  football newly filled; "what have 'e got then, this time, carryer?"</p>

  <p>"No consarn of thine, Cobbler Trickey;" Pugsley made stout answer, being
  cross, and short-fetched in the wind; "cobblers is not excisemen yet."</p>

  <p>"Potses, and panses again, as sure as I be a zinner! Cappen Larks ought to
  be shamed of hiszelf. Lor' A'mighty never made his works to grow in crockery.
  And you'm a gwain outside your trade. Backard and forrard is your proper
  coorse. Let me conzeider of they potses."</p>

  <p>"Ye be welcome to conzeider of them, cobbler. A niver zeed sich coorous
  cloam. Look'e yeer, they little holes hurneth all round 'em! Cappen's own
  diskivry, I do hear tell."</p>

  <p>The carrier loosened the cord of one crate, and allowed the intelligent
  Trickey to gaze, while he drew it towards the cart-tail. Trickey, though
  large enough of mind, was small of body; and he lifted himself by the lade,
  to see things justly.</p>

  <p>"You be bound by my advice," he cried, retreating hastily; "you take the
  next turn down to brook, and heft they into the watter. They was made for the
  witches, and no mistakk about 'em."</p>

  <p>"Zo I wull," Tim Pugsley answered, pretending to share his neighbour's
  fright, for he was a dry man, and full of book-learning. "Thank'e kindly for
  thy counsel, Jem. Into the watter they gooth, zure enough. Only thou must pay
  for the vally of 'em, and the carryage too, Cobbler Trickey."</p>

  <p>"Go thy way with thy witchcraft," the other replied. "Do 'e know what I
  call thee, Carryer Pugsley? I call thee a poor time-sarver, and a carryer of
  no conzistency."</p>

  <p>"I carry better stuff than thou dost," Pugsley shouted after him; as the
  shoe-maker, with a springy step, set off down the hill, for fear of worse.
  "Do I zwindle the public with brown papper? Do I putt 'ooden pegsin, and
  zwear they be stitched? Do I clam on the heel-ball, to hide my scamping? Do
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Master Pugsley cut short his list of libels, as he saw Master Trickey, at
  a decent distance, deliver a gesture of supreme contempt, by turning up his
  coat-tail, and administering a slap to the quarter of his body which was
  latest in retreat.</p>

  <p>"Do 'e do the like of that to I?" the carrier inquired superfluously. "If
  it twadn't for business, and the blessed law&mdash;howsomever, a bain't worth
  thinking on; Teddy, gee wugg! It be your vault mainly."</p>

  <p>The old horse, wont as he was to bear the blame of troubles far outside of
  his own shafts, rallied with a shiver and a rattle of his chains, and threw
  himself forward upon the strain. For a very stiff tug arose just here, for a
  horse who had been to Exeter and back, with a tidy load, only yesterday; and
  whose knowledge of corn was too superficial, getting more of the husk than
  the kernel for its study. And the manner of a Devonshire lane is such, that
  dogmatic humps stand up, in places, where nothing seems to warrant them. The
  meadows, to the right and left, may be as pleasant as you please to walk
  upon, with a sleek benevolence, a velvet pile, and a spring of supple
  freshness. And yet, within a landyard the lane is jumping scraggily, with
  ribs of solid rock, and pits and jags of bold abruptness. The nag, being born
  to such conditions, plodded on without repining; but in spite of all spirit,
  and skill, and care, he suddenly fell into sad disgrace.</p>

  <p>For just as the near wheel was creaking, on the verge of a steep slide of
  granite, where his turn-about was due&mdash;for the lane there allowed him
  chance of a little bit of slanting&mdash;Teddy did a thing that any other
  horse might do, or even a man in his position. He mistook a large stone-fly,
  just arisen from the Christow, for a genuine æstrus, a bot-fly, whame, or
  tabanus. If he had thought of the present time of year, he must have known
  better; but instead of thinking, he acted on his nerves, which struck into
  him like a spur. Up went his head, as if he were four years old, instead of
  going on for forty; and his old bones shook with indignation, at the
  pestilent state the world was come to. "Steady, you old fool! Who'm a-gwain
  for to kill'e?" the carrier exclaimed with a little friendly thump; but the
  mischief was done, while he was speaking. For the jump of the horse gave a
  jerk to the shaft, and this ran amiss into the axle-tree, gave a lollop to
  the near wheel, already on the wamble; and down went the felly, with a blue
  grind of iron, into the very hole they meant to shun. The hole was more than
  deep enough to hold a good nine gallons; and the wheel ground down into its
  deepest depth, while the other took advantage of the position for a holiday,
  and proved itself the off-wheel, by going off towards heaven.</p>

  <p>"Wull now!" said the carrier, without much haste, for his mind travelled
  slowly up the obstacles of thought; "this be a tarble dickyment; and here
  coom'th arl the cloam! Drat that old cobbler chap, 'twor arl his doings."</p>

  <p>An avalanche of pots, from the unroped crate, fell around him and upon
  him, while he reasoned thus. Like a quick shower of acorns from the shaken
  oak, but alas, much heavier, and more valuable, they rattled on the carrier,
  and thumped his poor chest, and a far more tender and impassioned part of
  man, till he fairly turned back, and let them roll upon his spine.</p>

  <p>"Jem, neighbour Jem, do'e come back, that's a dear;" he shouted, as loud
  as his drummed condition furnished, to the cobbler in the distance at the
  bottom of the hill. That good neighbour not only heard him, but replied right
  pleasantly, with a gladsome laugh, and a smart repetition of his gay
  defiance; then hastened on his course, with a step more nimble than his
  customers generally could compass from his shoes.</p>

  <p>"All men is clay," said the carrier, recovering his native equanimity, and
  wiping the red dust from his fustian suit; "all men is clay; and the Lord
  hath not intended us to putt His material into these here shapes, with a C.
  R. upon 'em, maning carrier's risk. Wull, a carn't brak' no more of 'un nor
  there be, now can 'e, Teddy? Smarl blame to thee, old chap. We'll both of us
  toorn to our brexass. This hosebird job hath coom, I rackon, 'long of doing
  of despite to the gifts of the Lord."</p>

  <p>Beholding a very nice place to sit down, and content with the cart in its
  present firm fixture, he pulled out the nosebag, and buckled it for Teddy, so
  that he might cast one eye down at his lip-service. Then he drew forth his
  own provender, and seasoned it, by dwelling on its beauties with his broad
  brown thumb. "Nation good, nation good!" he could not help exclaiming; "a
  good waife is the making of a man's front-piece. A vartuous woman laveth no
  occasion for a man to think twice of his vitteling, or zeek to read the
  papper. Best use of papper is to putt up bakkon in 'un."</p>

  <p>Sorrow, and breakage, and the other plagues of life, began to use less and
  less of pressure on his heart, as he sat upon a lady-fern (not yet plumed for
  dancing, but rich with soft beauty for a heavy man to sit upon) and biting
  out the cork from a flat stone bottle, moistened down the roadway for the
  bread and meat to follow. Then he fell to very heartily, and in less than
  half an hour began to feel nicely refreshed, and fit to encounter the issue
  before him.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER III. &mdash; PARSON SHORT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I am almost sure that he must have broken down," said the
  fairest of his flowers to the gardener; "he is the most punctual man in the
  county, and scarcely ever more than three days late. I saw him not more than
  three miles off, on the top of the hill above Lustleigh, before the sun was
  three yards high; and he must have been here, wiping his head, as a delicate
  hint for cider, two hours ago, if he had gone on well."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he has gone on too well, my dear, by taking the turn to the
  <i>Three Horse-shoes.</i> Not that I would cast any slur upon your pet; but
  still such things will happen."</p>

  <p>"To other people perhaps they might. But never to him&mdash;I am quite
  sure of that. The last time I saw him, he lamented cordially 'the mischief of
  them publics.'"</p>

  <p>"That was very good of him, and showed high principle, as well as a tender
  conscience," Mr. Arthur replied, while he took good care that his daughter
  should not observe his smile; for life enough was before her yet, for
  correction of faith in human nature. "Pugsley has the elements of a lofty
  character, industry, honesty, philosophy&mdash;in the sense of that word at
  present."</p>

  <p>"Father," cried Rose, having finished her bunch, and running up to him,
  with the long grape-scissors in her hand, and a trail of bast around her
  neck; "have I got the elements of a lofty character&mdash;industry,
  certainly, just look at those ten bunches; honesty, perhaps to a reasonable
  extent; but scarcely a bit of philosophy, I'm afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not too much of that," her father answered quietly; "but run
  in, and see about the breakfast, darling; or perhaps you may discover some
  defects in mine."</p>

  <p>"How I wish that I could! But I shall never do that, if philosophy means
  good temper. Now come and see my work, sir, and say if it is good."</p>

  <p>"It is good sound work; far better than Lord Bicton's head-gardener, at
  any money, could produce, in vineries like a cathedral. However it is not
  faultless yet; though I don't mean to say, that I could do it better, even if
  my eyes were as young as yours. You understand thoroughly the bunch, as it
  is; and you shape it beautifully for the time; nothing could be neater, or
  more justly placed. But you have yet to learn the fine perception of the
  future, the bending of the footstalk, as the berries grow in weight, and the
  probable drop of the shoulders. And practice alone can teach you the
  different ins and outs of each kind of grape, in swelling."</p>

  <p>"The subject appears to me to be endless. How shall I ever attain to such
  knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"By watching the results of your own work, and by never giving over."</p>

  <p>"Till old experience do attain to something like prophetic strain. But
  father, how did you thus attain it? Have you ever been apprenticed to a
  gardener?"</p>

  <p>"Little pitchers may have long ears; but they must not have curious
  tongues!" he replied, with a kiss on her forehead, to heal the rebuke. "Now
  let us go to breakfast; and then seek Pugsley."</p>

  <p>Hence it came to pass that while the good carrier was still regarding the
  position of his cart, and the attitude of his ancient horse, with calm eyes,
  and well-kindled pipe, a spirited young lady stood before him, and did not
  share his patience.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Master Pugsley; and you seem to think it good. But I always
  have understood, that a cart ought to stand upon both wheels."</p>

  <p>"So her did. You'm right there, Miss," the carrier answered, with a quiet
  grin. "But there be times when her doth'nt do her dooty, but go'oth
  contrairy, like the wominvolk."</p>

  <p>"And you mean to let her stay like that, for ever! And my father's pots
  lying in a heap upon the road!"</p>

  <p>"Cappen is a just man, and a' wull look auver it. Partikler now you've
  zeed it, Miss, and can sartify 'twor no hooman doin's."</p>

  <p>"All I can certify is, that you seem content to stay here for the rest of
  the day. Do please to get out of that hole at once, and bring all the pots
  you have managed not to break."</p>

  <p>"Lor', how natteral you do spake! It doth a man good to hear'e, Miss. Here
  us must baide, nolum wolum, till sich taime as Farmer Willum coom'th."</p>

  <p>"Farmer William may not come at all, or at any rate not till twelve
  o'clock. Now do put your shoulder to the wheel yourself. I am very strong,
  and I will help you."</p>

  <p>The carrier was too polite to laugh, though he cherished that disdain of
  female prowess, against which the chivalrous author of "Dorothy" couches his
  elegiac lance. But this man only puffed the pipe of silence.</p>

  <p>"You fancy that I can do nothing, I suppose," cried Rose, who was as
  prickly as a moss-rose, when provoked; "but I can do a whole quantity of
  things, such as would quite surprise you. I can milk a cow, and pot a vine,
  and bed down a pony, and salt a silverside, and store apples, and fry
  potatoes, and fill a pipe. And if all that is nothing, as you might be apt to
  think, because of being a man, Mr. Pugsley, I can answer for taking a hive of
  bees, without hurting one of them. Can you do that?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord forbid! He hath made 'em to be smoked, zoon as ever they a' done
  their work. But, Missy, it amooseth me to hear you tell up. You tell up a
  sight of things as a well-inventioned man can do, or if not one, mebbe then
  anither of 'em. But you never tak' no count on the hardest thing of arl, the
  like of which no man can do in this here county. You knows what I mane, Miss
  Rose; and winderful it is to me, for sich a babe and suckling!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know what you mean quite well. You have made me do it in the cart
  so often. But I do assure you that it is quite easy."</p>

  <p>"Aisy a' can never be," said the carrier decisively; "although a' zimth as
  some can do 'un, droo years of arly lanin'. To play the piander is winderful;
  but a varmer's datter may coom to that, bein' outside of her dooty; but niver
  can her coom to spakin' of the bad Vrench langoowich."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Master Pugsley, that every one can do it, in my proper rank
  of life. You are not stupid enough to suppose that because I pot
  vines&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Noo, noo, Miss; axing of your pardon for breaking in upon you. I knows as
  well as the Royal mail doth, that you be one of the karlity. None but a vule
  could look twice at you, and veel any doubt whatsomdever about that, my dear.
  And Cappen Larks, though he dooth quare things, is the very same; at any rate
  to my mind."</p>

  <p>"And to everybody's mind, I should hope, Mr. Pugsley. But he must not, and
  he shall not be called 'Captain Larks;' as you know, if nobody else does. Now
  please to get out of your rut, and come on."</p>

  <p>The nature truly noble, and the mind of lofty power, reluctant as they
  always are to make disclosure of themselves, and shunning as they always do
  the frippery of random praise, unwittingly are revealed sometimes by the
  conduct of tobacco-smoke. Shallow men, or hasty fellows, or small sons of
  discontent, labour hard with restless puffs, and vex the air with turbid
  fumes, promiscuously tossed from lip or bowl. How different is the process of
  the large, self-balanced, contemplative pipe! No swirling tempest battles
  round the brow, no waste of issue clouds the air; but blue wreaths hover far
  asunder, circling placidly as they soar, like haloes round the head of peace;
  the cool bowl shines without exuding, like the halcyon of the charm and calm,
  and sweet rest satisfies the spirit of the man, gratefully ministering the
  gift divine.</p>

  <p>In a state of mind thus serene and lofty, Master Pugsley smoked his pipe.
  Maiden impatience stirred him not, nor the casual shords of a slight mishap,
  nor the general fragility of human kind. If his cart was not upon a level
  axle, should that disturb his own equipoise? So he sat down again, in a
  courteous manner, and delivered very sound advice; while the young lady ran
  away, and left him to enjoy it, for she saw that help was near at hand.</p>

  <p>Now a man of good sense, and strong will, led the simple people of
  Christowell. In any trouble or turning of the mind, as well as in bodily
  ailments, there was not a grown-up man, or woman, who sought to go further
  than Parson Short. The Rev. Tom Short, vicar of the parish, coming to an
  utterly neglected place, had quietly made his way, by not insisting upon it
  unduly. Resolute good-will, plain speech, and fair allowance for adverse
  minds, together with a comfortable income of his own, enabled him to go on
  well, and to make his flock do likewise. He addressed them "on papper" only
  once a week, which was quite as much as they required; and that they did with
  diffidence. He, however, was well convinced of the mutual duty thereby
  discharged. No other preacher in the diocese could say so much in the time
  allowed, which was never more than five minutes; and no other congregation
  listened with attention so close, and yawns so few.</p>

  <p>In other matters, his style was dry, and terse, and quick to the purpose;
  yet seldom rough, and never arrogant or overbearing. Steadfast Tory as he
  was, he respected everybody's rights, and felt due sympathy for their wrongs,
  whenever he could see them. His education had been good at Winchester, and
  New College; whence he had taken high classical honours, though his college
  was then exempt from test. For his manner of sticking to the point at issue,
  and knowing nothing&mdash;unless he knew it well&mdash;was just what Oxford
  then encouraged. His bodily appearance was not grand, nor large, nor at all
  imposing; and the principal weakness of his mind was a morbid perception of
  that defect. Not that he could be called a dwarf, or plain, or at all
  unsightly; only that his spirit, being very great had a hankering for larger
  tenement. This feeling perhaps had saved his freedom, by making him shy of
  long-bodied ladies, while it kept him from admiring short ones. So now he was
  nearing his fortieth year, with a prospect of nothing but bachelorhood, which
  his cook was determined to maintain on his behalf. Yet many a young lady of
  exalted stature would gladly enough have become Mrs. Short.</p>

  <p>For this was a ruddy, brisk, and very cheerful man, bald it is true, on
  the top of his head, but plenteously whiskered, largely capable of
  beard&mdash;if clerical principles should ever close the razor, which they
  were beginning even now to do in London&mdash;gifted moreover with a very
  pleasant smile, a short waggish nose, and keen blue eyes. No better man could
  fill his shoes, or at any rate could get into them, so well compressed was
  his material, and so good the staple.</p>

  <p>It was not only this, nor yet the graceful increment of his income, nor
  even the possession of a spiritual turn, that led the young ladies to be
  thinking of him, whenever any settlement in life was mentioned. He inspired
  large interest by his own merit, but a feeling yet larger and deeper, by his
  present sad position. To rescue him from the despotism of Mrs. Aggett, his
  widowed cook, was the lofty aim of almost every other female. But he bore his
  yoke with patience, and preferred the known to the unknown ill.</p>

  <p>"How now, Pugsley? Stuck fast like this, and the captain's pots smashed up
  like that!" this bachelor shouted, as he marched up briskly, saw the
  position, and understood the large resignation of the native mind.</p>

  <p>"Stuck slow, I karls it, Passon Shart. And thicky cloam be smashed, more
  down than oop. If her baided oop, her wud 'a been all zound."</p>

  <p>"Come, Master Tim, get out your levers, instead of argifying."</p>

  <p>"Passon, I wull; if so be I've got 'un. The Lord know'th, whether they be
  here, or to home."</p>

  <p>"Here they are, more peart than you be;" Mr. Short replied, turning up
  some old rubbish from the bottom of the cart, and drawing forth two spars of
  ash; "now wugg on, Teddy, when I give the word."</p>

  <p>"No man as ever I see yet," said the carrier, through a blue ring of
  smoke, "hath received the power to make Teddy wugg, when a' hath his nosebag
  on; avore such time, as his tongue have been into the uttermost corners of
  the zame."</p>

  <p>Parson Short, without any answer, unbuckled the strap of the hairy wallet,
  gently withdrew it from the old fellow's nose (though he put up one foot to
  protect it), and marching sternly up the hill, hung this fine temptation upon
  a hazel bush, at the first corner. Teddy, with a whinny of soft remonstrance,
  pricked up his ears, and looked anxious to proceed.</p>

  <p>"Passons has no conscience whativer," said the carrier, pocketing his
  pipe; "they distresses all the hanimals, like the better sort, on Zindays.
  Niver lets nobody baide at peace."</p>

  <p>"Cease from weak reflections, and take to action," the inexorable Short
  replied. "If your time is worthless, mine is not. Stir him up, Pugsley, while
  I start the wheel."</p>

  <p>"I vear your reverence be a'most too small," said Pugsley, with much good
  will, but touching the vicar in his most tender part. Mr. Short took off his
  coat, folded it carefully, and laid it on a rock-moot, because it was a very
  good one; then turning up shirt-sleeves of fair white linen, he showed a pair
  of arms as well-complexioned as a lady's, but thick-set, bossy, and
  substantial. "Lor' a' mussy," cried the carrier, "thou should'st niver have a
  goon on!"</p>

  <p>Deigning no answer, the sturdy parson seized the bigger of the two ash
  staves, and laying the butt of the other for a fulcrum, gave the stuck wheel
  such a powerful heft, that the whole cart rattled, and the crates began to
  dance.</p>

  <p>"Zober, passon, zober! Or ee'll heft 'un over tother zide," said Pugsley,
  running up to the horse's head; "now, Teddy, taste thy legs, and strive at
  'un."</p>

  <p>At a touch of the whip on his legs, the old nag threw his chest out, and
  grappled the ground with his hoofs. Then he cast his weight forward, and
  strained to the tug, with his back on the stretch, and his ribs like hoops,
  and even his tail stiffened up like a hawser.</p>

  <p>"Heave-oh!" shouted Parson Short, suiting the action to the word; "well
  done then, old horse, we are out of the hole!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER IV. &mdash; LARK'S COT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Christowell village (in full view of which, the horse, cart,
  and driver, had rested so long) affords to the places above it, or below,
  fair plea for contemplation. Many sweet beauties of tempered clime flower the
  skirts of the desolate moor, and the sweetest of these is Christowell. Even
  the oldest inhabitant cannot, to the best of his recollection, say, whether
  he ever did hear tell, that the place was accounted beautiful. He knoweth
  that picture-men do come, and set up three-legged things, and stand, as grave
  as judges, to make great maps, like them that be hanging in the schoolroom;
  but he never yet hath known any odds to come of it; the rocks abide the same,
  as if they never had been drawed, and the trees&mdash;you may look for
  yourself, and say whether they have fetched another apple. For when the Lord
  rested on Saturday night, His meaning was not, that the last of His works
  should fall to, and make strokes of the rest of them.</p>

  <p>Sound sense of such lofty kind is the great gift of this village. Every
  man here would be contented, if he only had his due; failing of that, he
  keeps his merit to the mark of his wages, by doing his day's work gently. If
  a neighbour gets more than himself, he tries hard to believe that the man
  should have earned it; and even his wife is too good to declare, what she
  thinks of the woman next door to her. Among themselves sometimes they manage
  to fall out very cordially; but let anybody sleeping out of the parish, have
  an unbecoming word to say of his betters who are inside it, and if he walk
  here, without a magistrate behind him, scarcely shall he escape from the
  sheep-wash corner in the lower ham.</p>

  <p>For a beautiful brook of crystal water, after tumbling by the captain's
  cot, makes its own manner of travelling here, rarely allowing the same things
  to vex it, or itself to complain of the same thing, twice. From crags, and
  big deserts, and gorges full of drizzle, it has scrambled some miles, without
  leisure for learning self-control, or patience. And then it comes suddenly,
  round a sharp corner, into the quiet of Christowell, whose church is the
  first work of man it has seen, except that audacious cottage. Then a few
  little moderate slips, which are nothing, compared with its higher
  experience, lead it with a murmur to a downright road, and a ford where men
  have spread it gently, and their boys catch minnows. Here it begins to be
  clad with rushes, and to be curbed by jutting trees, and lintelled by planks,
  for dear gossip and love; for cottages, on either bank, come down, and
  neighbours full of nature inhabit them.</p>

  <p>Happy is the village that has no street, and seldom is worried by the
  sound of wheels. Christowell keeps no ceremonial line of street, or road, or
  even lane, but goes in and out, as the manner of the land may be, or the
  pleasure of the landlords. Still there is a place where deep ruts grow,
  because of having soft rock under them; and this makes it seem to be the
  centre of the village, and a spot where two carts meet sometimes; for the
  public-house is handy. Once upon a time, two carts met here, and here they
  spent a summer's day, both being driven by obstinate men, who were not at all
  their owners. Neither would budge from his own rut, and the horses for
  several hours rubbed noses, or cropped a little grass, while the men lay
  down. Being only first cousins, these men would not fight; as they must have
  done, if they had been brothers. Yet neither of them would disgrace his
  county&mdash;fair mother of noble stubbornness&mdash;by any mean compromise,
  or weak concession; so they waited until it grew dark; and then, with a
  whistle of good will, began to back away together, and as soon as they found
  room to turn, went home to supper from a well-spent day.</p>

  <p>But such a fine treat and stir of interest was rare, and the weather was
  the only thing that could be trusted for supplying serious diversion. Herein
  nobody was wronged of subject; for the weather was so active, that the
  hardest-working man could spend his time in watching it. No sooner had he
  said that it must be fine, than ere he could catch up his spade again, it was
  flying in his face, and he was eating his own words. Herein alone, is variety
  enough to satisfy people of contented heart. For scarcely ever did the same
  things look the same, for two hours together.</p>

  <p>Upon a day of well-conducted weather, beginning brightly in the morning, a
  stranger newly arrived from town may feed, and gaze, alternately. At sunrise,
  he is in bed of course; largely saving the disappointment, which the lavish
  promise of the east might bring. But even at eight of an average morning,
  when he wants his breakfast, the world is spread before him well, with soft
  light flowing up the plains, and tracing lines of trees, and bends of meadow.
  He stands, or sits down to his bacon and eggs, twelve hundred feet above
  sea-level, with fair land, and bright water, spreading three-fourths of the
  circle around him. To the east, some five leagues off, are the dark square
  towers of Exeter cathedral, backed by the hazy stretches of Black-down; on
  the right are glimpses of the estuary of Exe, from Powderham Castle towards
  Starcross. Outside them, and beyond, and overlapping every landmark, the
  broad sweep of the English Channel glistens, or darkens, with the moods above
  it, from the Dorset headlands to the Start itself. Before he has time to make
  sure of all this, the grand view wavers, and the colours blend; some parts
  retire, and some come nearer; and lights and shadows flow and flit, like the
  wave and dip of barley, feathering to a gentle July breeze. The lowland
  people descry herein the shadow of the forest as they call it; and the
  "Dartymorevolk," looking down upon them, are proud to have such a long "tail
  to the moor."</p>

  <p>For the line of the land is definite here, as the boundary of a parish is.
  In many other parts it is not so, and the moor slopes off into farmland; but
  here, like the fosse of an old encampment, the scarp of the moor is manifest.
  Over this, that well-fed stream, the Christow, takes a rampant leap,
  abandoning craggy and boggy cradle, desolate nurture, and rudiments of
  granite, for a country of comparative ease, where it learns the meaning of
  meadow. And its passage, from rude into civilized life, occurs in the garden
  of the "Captain." Brief is its course, and quickly run; for in the morass,
  where it first draws breath, three other rivers of wider fame arise, and go
  their several ways; and one of them, after twenty miles of crooked increase
  round the North, quietly absorbs poor Christow brook, and makes no gulp of
  acknowledgment. Without wasting one pebble in calculation, or a single furrow
  upon forethought, the merry brook hurries to whatever may befall it, and
  never fails to babble of whatever comes across it.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that the vicar of the parish, Mr. Short, was a "highly
  temperate" man, as all who love cold water are supposed to be; although they
  may love many other things therewith. No sooner had he seen Master Pugsley up
  the hill, with a strong shove to second old Teddy's motion, than he left
  those two to go in, and deliver the relics of their cargo, and their own
  excuses.</p>

  <p>"Do'e come in now, and break it to the cappen," the carrier vainly pleaded
  to him; "do'e like a dear good minister."</p>

  <p>"Tell your own lies, your own way," the parson answered pleasantly; "if I
  were there, I should have to contradict you."</p>

  <p>"How partikkler you be&mdash;outzide of the pulpit!" said Pugsley with a
  sigh, yet a grin at his own wit.</p>

  <p>Well seasoned to such little jokes, the Vicar looked at him seriously, so
  that the carrier felt sorry for his wit; and then, with a smile, Mr. Short
  went back to the place where he had left his coat. This was just over against
  the pile of pots, which had found the ground too hard, and had lost all
  tenure of it for ever. Looking at these, as he donned his coat, the parson
  said, "Ha! The newest, I believe, of that wonderful man's inventions! Let me
  take the liberty of looking at the fragments." This he soon accomplished to
  his heart's content, but failed to make head or tail of them, because he was
  not a born gardener. Then he took up a shord of one rounded side and went
  down to the river, with that for his cup. Not that he felt any thirst,
  although he had worked very hard&mdash;for a parson; but that a certain
  school of doctors had arisen, and said that every man, who wished to live,
  must take his cold pint every morning of his life. Some ten years later,
  every man, desirous to prolong himself and his family, was bound to take four
  gallons, shed outside him. And now he takes shivering claret inside.</p>

  <p>For the nostrums of the moment Mr. Short cared little; but people had
  praised him, for liking now and then a draught of cold water; and this made
  him try to do it. With his slip of pantile, as he called it (in large
  ignorance of garden ware) he passed through a gap in the hedge of the lane,
  and walked down to the brook, and scooped up a little drink.</p>

  <p>Assuring himself how delicious it was, he was going to pitch the shord
  into the stream, when he spied on its inner rim certain letters, invisible
  until the cloam was wetted.</p>

  <p>"What a queer thing! And how could it have been done?" he thought, as he
  began to peer more closely; and then he made out the words&mdash;"Pole's
  patent." He tried it, several times, and he turned it several ways; but
  nothing else was to be made of it. And presently his own surprise surprised
  him, for what was there marvellous in the matter? Nothing whatever; but it
  was rather queer that the brand should be inside the pot (which must have
  required a convex mould) and the name not that of Mr. Arthur, although the
  design was entirely his, as Mr. Short knew, from having seen the
  drawings.</p>

  <p>"What a blessing for me that I am not gifted with much curiosity!" said
  the vicar to himself, as he turned the last corner of the lane, and sat down
  by the captain's gate, to wait till the carrier's job was done. "Nine out of
  ten of my brother clerks would have it on their conscience, to rout up this
  question. A mystery in one's own parish is a pest, when the man at the bottom
  of it comes to church. Otherwise one might wash one's hands. But this man is
  honest, and God-fearing, and a gentleman; and the only one fit to smoke a
  pipe with in the parish!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Short sighed; for he liked his fellow-men, and was partly cut off from
  them by his condition, or at least by his own view of it. Though many of the
  moorland pastors still looked after their flock, in a gregarious manner, not
  disdaining their assemblage at the public-house sometimes. "Our mysterious
  friend," he continued, as he gazed, "not only has a very large amount of
  taste, but also much strategic power. How well he has made his garden fit the
  stream, so that the stream seems to follow the garden! Grass in the proper
  place, beds in the proper place, and trees planted cleverly to drink the
  water, and flourish like the righteous man! But greatest device of all, and
  noblest, because of its pure simplicity, the safeguard against morning calls,
  and the check to inquisitive ladies; for instance, Lady Touchwood. How I
  should like to know that man's history! Hi, there, Pugsley! Give me a lift
  over. I can't jump, as I used to do."</p>

  <p>A man's resemblance to a tree has been discovered, and beautifully
  descanted upon&mdash;from nethermost tail of tap-root, to uttermost twig, and
  split sky-leaf&mdash;by hundreds of admirable poets. But thoroughly as these
  have worked out the subject, they seem to have missed one most striking
  analogy. A man (like a tree) can have no avail of comfort, unless there
  belongs to him the margin of a brook, to part him from the brambles, and the
  ruffle, and the jostle of the multitudinous thicket of the world. "Lark's
  cot"&mdash;as Mr. Arthur's home was called by the natives, and even by
  himself, at last&mdash;was gifted with a truly desirable brook&mdash;the
  Christow, as aforesaid. The cot stood about a mile above the village, under a
  jagged tor, known as "the beacon," and in a southeastern embrasure of the
  moor. This lonely, quiet, and delightful spot looked as if it ought to have
  no road to it, or at any rate none to go any further. Upon its own merits
  indeed it never would have earned or even claimed a road: but it fell into
  the way of one, by a "casual haxident," as Devonshire people term it. For it
  happened, that one of the feeders of the main Roman road, across the desert,
  helped itself up the steep labour of the heights, by the crooked balustrade
  of the Christow brook. This lane, every now and then, cold-shouldered the
  merriment of the brook, with a stiff dry hedge, and feigned to have nothing
  to do with it; yet times there were, and as much as a fortnight of Sundays in
  a downright season, when lane and brook made exchange of duty, as lightly as
  two parsons do. And the public,&mdash;so faithful to variety it
  proves&mdash;was pleased in this case, as it is in the other; and after a
  while found a new charm, in recurring to its veteran and inveterate ruts.</p>

  <p>But in moderate weather, and decent seasons, the Christow keeps to its
  natural bed, strewn with bright pebbles, and pillowed with rock. Through the
  garden of the captain, its glittering run is broken, by some little zig-zags
  of delay, and many laughing tumbles; at one of which, it does some work, by
  turning a wheel, when driven to it. And when the gardener's day is done, and
  the sun is gone to the western world, while the apple with uplifted, and the
  pear with pensive eye, stand forth of their dim leafage, in the rounding of
  the light&mdash;then down here, by the fluid steps, and twinkling passage of
  the stream, a bench is hung with clematis, and tented round with roses, for
  leisure, and the joy of rest, and bliss of admiration.</p>

  <p>Now dwelling here, and seeing how the land was in his favour, the captain
  helped the hand of nature, to secure his quietude. The cliff on the west of
  his garden had offered possibility of descent, to ladies of clear head, and
  strong ankle. This bad temptation he soon removed, by a few charges of
  rock-powder; and then towards the north, where the ground was softer, he
  planted a brake of the large-flowered gorse, having thorns of stiff texture
  and admirable teeth. The bloom of this was brighter than the fairest maiden's
  tresses, even of the now most fashionable ochre; and the rustle of the wind,
  among the tufts, was softer than the sweetest silvery nonsense.</p>

  <p>Thus he well established ramparts, solid and spinous, all about his rear;
  and then he had leisure to improve his front, and eastern flank towards the
  village. Nature had defended these, fairly and honestly enough, by sending a
  nice watercourse around them. Still there were lapses in the vigilance of the
  brook, where a lady, with her skirts up, might flip through, or even, with a
  downward run, spring over; and having much experience of the world, he knew
  how slow they were to hesitate, with curiosity behind them. So, with a
  powerful spade, and stout dredging-rake, he made good those weak places; and
  then looking round, with glad defiance, suddenly espied at his very threshold
  a traitorous inroad, a passage for the evil one. For here was a series of
  wicked stepping-stones, coming across a shallow width of water, as old as the
  hills, and looking quite as steadfast. Strictly heeding these, and probing
  vigorously with a crowbar, he found one towards the further side, which was
  loose in its socket, like a well-worn tooth; and after a little operation, he
  contrived to leave a fine gap in the series. Curiosity on tiptoe might come
  thus far, but without winged toes, or wading boots, was sure of catching
  cold, if it came any further. Thus a gentleman's wife, from a parish down
  below, who kept the spy-glass of the neighbourhood, was obliged to stop
  there; and at once pronounced him a vastly superior, and most interesting
  man, but undoubtedly a noted criminal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER V. &mdash; AMONG THE BUDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"How beautiful everything looks, and how large and early all
  your bloom is! People may talk about Torquay. But I was down there yesterday,
  and I find you a week in front of them. Well done, Christowell! Torquay has
  not a pear-bloom open yet, even in Morgan's garden. But perhaps you grow the
  earlier sorts."</p>

  <p>Parson Short, and Captain Larks, were hearty friends by this time; for
  each of them loved the truthful staple, and kindly heart of the other. The
  clergyman had too much self-respect, to pry into the layman's history. He
  took him as he found him, a gentle, intelligent, peaceful, and orthodox
  ratepayer.</p>

  <p>"The earliest fruit is not the first to bloom," the gardener answered,
  with his pruning-knife at work; "or at any rate, not of necessity. The later
  kind often is the first in bloom."</p>

  <p>"Well, I never knew that. But I see the reason. Slow fellows want a good
  start, as in a race. I like to hear of little things, that I have never
  noticed; for an apple and a pear are pretty much the same to me. And that
  reminds me of the thing I came to ask you. Yesterday I rode down to Torquay,
  because the dog <i>Nous</i> wanted exercise; and there, upon the pier, I met
  an ancient friend, whom I value and admire greatly. By the death of an uncle,
  he has come into a large estate, on the west side of the moor; and there he
  is going to improve the garden. He has never had a chance of gardening much;
  but he loves it, almost as much as you do, especially the fruit, and the
  vegetable stuff. He knows next to nothing about it; but that adds enormously
  to the enchantment. He has heard of you, as a mighty man of fruit, from
  nurserymen near Exeter. And instead of burning, as he should have done, to
  come and see me, the parson, all he seemed to care about was to see you; you,
  the gardener, and your garden!</p>

  <p>"I ought to be obliged to him, even more than I am," Mr. Arthur answered
  plainly. "One of the many plagues of gardening is that the public regard it
  as a mere amusement, which is carried on, for them to stare at, like cricket
  on the village-green. The general idea of a garden is&mdash;a place to sit
  down in, and smoke pipes."</p>

  <p>"And the right view of the subject too," replied Mr. Short, who understood
  his man, and how soon his petulance broke up into a smile. "My friend, I will
  take your hint. My pipe is ready. I will sit, and watch your labours, and
  learn much."</p>

  <p>"That you will never do," the other answered, smiling at the turn of the
  mood upon him; "simply because it is not in you. From morning till night, you
  might think you were watching, and go away, not a twig the wiser, because you
  were not born for it; any more than I for Greek verbs, and pithy sermons. Why
  do I cut to this bud now? I have told you fifty times, but you cannot tell me
  now."</p>

  <p>"Slash away all the buds," said Mr. Short, for fear of making a wrong hit
  at it; "so long as you know, and the bud understands it&mdash;but here comes
  the fairest bud of all, my little Rose-bud&mdash;how are you, my dear? And
  why does your father cut back to you? Is it because you grow in the right
  direction?"</p>

  <p>"I have stopped growing long ago in every direction;" she answered,
  looking far away above the hat of Mr. Short; for her views of life were
  becoming large; and it liked her not to be called "my dear," even from the
  force of habit. And then she feared that she had gone too far, especially in
  looking such a height above him. So she blushed, in pure penitence,&mdash;and
  was almost ready to offer her father's friend a kiss, as used to be done of
  old, when she met him on the first morning of the holidays. But the vicar
  took no offence, and heeded not her communings, for he did not want to enter
  into young girls' minds.</p>

  <p>"Now what would this child do, to express her gratitude"&mdash;he put it
  to her father with a nod of understanding; "supposing that I were to bring
  her a hero? A genuine hero, of valour and of chivalry, such a man as she has
  only dreamed of&mdash;or perhaps read about him, and got tired."</p>

  <p>"I never get tired of reading of heroes; and how could I get tired of
  looking at them?"</p>

  <p>"That is quite another pair of shoes, Miss Rose. My friend is not
  wonderful to look at, as the men seldom are, who have wrought great wonders.
  But you could not help liking and admiring him, because he does it to himself
  so little. And he will admire you, I can tell you. Coax your dear father to
  let me bring him."</p>

  <p>"My poor little place, and my puny experiments," Mr. Arthur said, with
  that large humility, which marks the true gardener (as long as he is
  praised), "are always at the service of the lover of the craft, who is good
  enough to think, that I can teach him something. At the same time, it must be
  kindly borne in mind, that I am but a learner, and make no pretence to
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"To be sure, my dear sir. All allowance will be made. We cannot, for
  instance, expect you to be like the great Scotch gardener, at Lord Bicton's
  place."</p>

  <p>"It would grieve me, and disgrace me, to be like that fellow. I would not
  let him come here, with his crooked-bladed knife, if he paid me £5 a day for
  it. Miserable numskull!"</p>

  <p>"Even I should know better than to do what he does," cried Rose, running
  up to a fine pear-tree. "He nails the young wood of a wall-tree down the
  trunk, like this positively; and drives the great nails into the poor thing's
  breast!"</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea!" cried Mr. Short, laughing at the horror on the maiden's
  face. "So he makes the tree really self-supporting; and it feeds its young,
  like a pelican, out of its own breast."</p>

  <p>"No; it feeds the nails, like that," she answered; "the great rusty nails,
  and the dirty weeds, and snails; and no nourishment for the poor fruit at
  all. Oh, Mr. Short, how very little you do know!"</p>

  <p>"How may I attain to such rare knowledge? If I only had the stuff in me,
  you might improve it. But alas, I have not the most raw material. But my old
  friend across the moor has got the making in him; and he seems to see the
  principles, if he could only get the practice."</p>

  <p>"So far as concerns my scraps of knowledge, and my humble premises," the
  owner answered, as he looked about him, with no other flourish than a
  clapping of his clips; "they are wholly at the service of a friend of yours.
  It will give me great pleasure to see him, when he pleases. And if you will
  let me know the day, I will have my little drawbridge down."</p>

  <p>"Now, I call that really kind of you; because I know that you are pressed
  for time just now. And that made me enlist little Rosie on my side. I will
  write at once to Colonel Westcombe; he will ride over to my early dinner, at
  which I shall be proud if you, and your dear child, will join us. Then we
  will have the old four-wheel out, and come up the hill all together."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what a pleasure it will be! Papa, you had better not say 'No'; or you
  never shall hear the last of it. But what have you discovered so important in
  the brook? Is it a salmon? No, they can't get up here. It must be the otter
  once more. Mr. Short, oh do come with <i>Nous,</i> and your double-barrelled
  gun."</p>

  <p>"It is not at all an easy thing to shoot an otter," said the parson, a
  dear lover of the rod and gun; "but if you have an otter here, he will harry
  your trout dreadfully. The only way to get a shot is to lie hid for hours.
  <i>Nous</i> would do more harm than good, freely as he takes the water. But,
  Arthur, you understand all that. I am sure that you are an old
  sportsman."</p>

  <p>"I used to be fond of the gun," said his host; "but I never shoot now; and
  shall never shoot again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short was surprised at the tone of his voice, and the change in his
  face, and manner. What was become of his frank complacence, and light smile
  at his own conceit, and glances of fatherly pride at his Rose? Instead of all
  that he looked troubled, and perplexed, and preparing to contend with some
  new grief. Even his lively child saw this; though as yet she had not learned
  to study a face, whose only expression for her was love.</p>

  <p>"I fear that I have vexed you," the clergyman said kindly; "by striving to
  draw you from your good and quiet habits. I can well understand your dislike
  to be disturbed, such as I very often have myself. Leave it to me to settle
  with Colonel Westcombe. I can easily do it, without offending him. The fault
  has been wholly my own, for not considering. I hope that you will pardon me;
  and I am sure that Westcombe will; for he is one of the noblest-hearted
  fellows living."</p>

  <p>"That he is. Right well I know it," Mr. Arthur answered, with more warmth
  than prudence. "But alas, what a number of my pots are broken! Let us go in.
  The sun is droughty. We have hit upon a most prime blend of cider; but I dare
  not bottle any, till I have your <i>imprimatur."</i></p>

  <p>"You shall have the full benefit of my judgment," the parson answered
  briskly; "after the tug of the morning, I deserve even better than Christow
  water. My acquaintance with fruit is chiefly liquid, in spite of all your
  lectures. Miss Rose, answer me one question, if you can; and young ladies
  now-a-days are taught all paradoxes. Why should milk become solid, and apples
  liquid, by the self-same process of thumping?"</p>

  <p>"Because, because&mdash;because I don't know. And can you explain to me,
  Mr. Short, how a man can be beaten black, and blue? If he is black, he can
  never be blue."</p>

  <p>"Nothing can be simpler. At first he is black; and as he begins to get
  better he turns blue."</p>

  <p>Such nonsense they were talking, not of their own folly, but simply to
  carry off the awkward time, as they followed Captain Larks to the cottage. He
  turned round, now and then, to seem to heed them; but they knew, better than
  himself perhaps, that his mind was far away, and that his cheerfulness was
  gone. Then he roused up his spirits, to discharge fair duties as a host, at
  which he was always good, with the very few whom he received as guests. His
  graceful young daughter, with her hat thrown off, and clusters of nut-brown
  hair tied back, flitted across the bars of sunshine chequered by some
  Banksian sprays, while she spread upon the table shadow, and still better,
  substance of the things that nourish life. Bread, that is to say, and butter
  (beaded as with meadow dew); honeycomb, gladdened with the moorland scent,
  and the thick-set mettle of a home-fed ham, where fat and lean played into
  one another sweetly&mdash;like moonlight among roses. In the thick of
  temptation reposed Cos-lettuce&mdash;cold and crisp, and beautiful, and
  justly divided by a thin, sharp knife, showing follicle, frill, and crimp
  broidery of gold, in and out of cells, and fronds, and filigree of carved
  ivory. Neither were the fluid creatures absent; cider was there, like an
  amber fountain springing into beads of pearl, and bright ale, comrade of the
  labours of mankind; and, for the weaker vessels, water. Not yet was vapid
  claret shed, like vinegar on the English rock.</p>

  <p>Distributing good supply, and partaking fairly to commend it, the host
  began to regard the world, with larger benevolence, and hope. He looked at
  his child, who was doing her best to smile away sudden disturbance, and to
  set their visitor at his ease; and then he looked at this pleasant friend,
  who had shown such good breeding, and submission to his mood. And with that,
  Mr. Arthur was fain to confess, that he had allowed himself to be surprised
  out of his usual respect for others.</p>

  <p>The vicar, (although a testy man, with strangers, or with upstarts,) not
  only did not show, but did not even feel resentment now. He had faith in his
  friend, that there must be sound reason for the refusal of his request; and
  he fully expected some explanation, perhaps when Rose should be out of the
  way. So he thoroughly enjoyed the simple fare, and resolved to enrage his
  cook, Mrs. Aggett, by a fulsome description of the captain's ham. For this he
  deserved to have his banquet interrupted, and so it was very speedily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I do declare," cried the quick-eyed Rose, as she helped him to some
  honey for the crown of his repast, "the very queerest figure that you can
  imagine is trying to get across our steps!"</p>

  <p>"Ungrateful damsel!" Mr. Short replied, as he went to the bud-covered
  lattice. "Have you no sense of a most distinguished honour? It is the mighty
  Solomon, and he bears a letter."</p>

  <p>"Surely you don't mean Betty Cork's boy, who went about for Doctor
  Perperaps? The one that rose into the 'loftier spear?'"</p>

  <p>"To be sure; Lady Touchwood's page he is. And she so arrays him, that our
  wag, the cobbler's boy, who used to call him 'Solomon Senna,' now has dubbed
  him 'Solomon's Glory.'"</p>

  <p>"Glorious he may be," said Rose; "but he seems in a very sad fright at
  present; and he cannot take my jump. Father, dear, shall I go, and ask him
  what he wants?"</p>

  <p>"After all, the honour is not for you, but my humble self," interposed Mr.
  Short. "He is screaming at the top of his voice 'Passon Shart.' Don't think
  of letting down the drawbridge. I will make him walk through, just to spoil
  his grand livery."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you are not afraid of 'my lady,' do make him walk through the
  water, while I see him."</p>

  <p>"Rose, you are too mischievous," said Mr. Arthur, getting up. "I will go
  and take the boy's message myself. We must not carry things too far."</p>

  <p>In a minute or two, he returned with a letter, sealed with a formidable
  coat of arms, and addressed to "The Revd. Tom Short, Christowell Vicarage.
  <i>Important."</i></p>

  <p>"Plague upon the woman!" cried the reverend gentleman; "she wants me on
  the instant, about something most momentous! And Mrs. Aggett has been stupe
  enough to send the boy on here. It is nothing but one of her little tempers.
  However, I must go home, and ride away at once, though my horse is entitled
  to a good day in stable."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to show you a whole quantity of things," replied his host with
  unfeigned disappointment; for the bloom of the pleasure of good work fades,
  when nobody comes to admire it. "It is more than a fortnight since you were
  here; and a fortnight of April is as much as a month, at almost any other
  time. And if you care little for fruit, you love flowers."</p>

  <p>"The rose, the rose, the rose for me!" Mr. Short exclaimed, with a smile
  at the blushing specimen before him. "I shall write you the song of the rose
  some day. I know a little Rose, who considers me a nightingale. Even so, I
  must fly immediately. May I let down the planch for myself, good host?"</p>

  <p>They would not hear of this, but bore him company down the winding walk;
  where the pear-tree was clustering its petal'd cups of snow, and the apple
  beginning, in the slant sunshine, to unravel the down of its bossy green
  truss. Then the gardener himself let down his "planch," over the wavering
  glitter of the brook; and crossing the meadow, where Mopsy the cow lived,
  they came to the private door into the lane. Here Christowell shone, in the
  haze of spring below them, and the hoary old church, beyond the flash of
  hasty waters, looked holy, and peaceful, as the tombs around it.</p>

  <p>"Be sure that you come again soon," cried Rose, running lightly back to
  the lane, while her father was going home across the mead. "Please to come
  to-morrow, if you possibly can, and tell us every syllable about that Lady
  Touchwood; she puzzles me so dreadfully, Mr. Short!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Touchwood will say, when she hears where I have been, 'Tell me every
  syllable about that Miss Arthur; she is such a puzzle to me, Mr. Short!'"</p>

  <p>No sooner had he spoken than he deeply regretted his stupid little slip of
  tongue; because he saw that he had given pain. Rose made no answer, but
  coloured deeply, and turned away with a curtsey; then, rejoining her father,
  she clung closely to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Poor dear!" thought the vicar, who loved his light-hearted, and sweet
  parishioner, pastorally, "I heartily trust, that I am altogether wrong. But,
  if I know anything of the world, that pretty girl, and good girl, has a
  troublous time before her."</p>

  <p class="first">Touchwood Park, as the owners loved to call it, differed
  from Lark's Cot, almost as much as Sir Joseph Touchwood from "Captain Larks."
  Brilliance without shade, but striped, and barred with brighter brilliance,
  and slashed across with all bold hues (in diaper pattern, glittering like a
  newly varnished oil-cloth) with stucco pilasters to relieve it (but all too
  shallow to help themselves, or carry their white perukes of piecrust), and
  topped with a stuck-up roof of tile, and puckered things called "minarets,"
  but more like stable-lanterns&mdash;the gazer found solace in shutting both
  eyes, and hoping that the money had done good elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"Winderful to my maind, winderful they arktexts be!" said John Sage, of
  Christowell, to his wife. "Blest if they han't diskivered a plan, to make
  tower of Babel, out of Noah's rainbow!"</p>

  <p>"What odds to thee?" replied his good wife sharply; "our Bill hath drawed
  his ladder wages, riglar, every Zatterday."</p>

  <p>Truly, it made small difference to the quiet folk of Christowell, whether
  the mansion were tall or short, dazzling or soothing to the eye; because it
  was out of their parish&mdash;which marks a broad line in all matters of
  feeling&mdash;and also, because it was out of their sight, till they mounted
  a gristly and scraggy bone of hill. Some of them looked upon this as a great
  denial, and grumbled, at going so far, to see the big house on a Sunday. But
  most people said it was wisely ordained, lest the liver'd young men should
  come courting their daughters, and drive up the price of beer at the
  <i>Horse-shoes.</i></p>

  <p>Sir Joseph Touchwood had a right to please himself; as indeed he always
  did, having vast self-complacence, which was justified by his success in
  life. Beginning his career, as a boy of all work, he had made his way into a
  little grocer's shop at Stonehouse, and so into the Pursers' rooms, and
  thence into Admiralty contracts, lucrative, and elastic. He cheated as little
  as he could help, until he could do it, on a worthy scale, and in superior
  company.</p>

  <p>Rising thus, he was enabled, by-and-by, to be the superior company
  himself, to reward those who helped him, and make it more expedient, to shake
  the head, than to wag the tongue about him. And little as he cared for the
  shadow, or even the sparkle of his object, while he grasped the substance,
  the showy part also was rendered to him, by a pleasing and natural
  incident.</p>

  <p>Lord Wellington's men having worn out their shoes, by constant pursuit of
  the enemy, our Government took measures to prepare to shoe them, by the time
  they had learned to march barefoot. Joseph Touchwood got the contract; his
  beef had been found of such durable texture, that the hides, in all reason,
  must last for ever. The order was placed in Northampton; the shoes were made
  in a jiffy, and came to Plymouth, two-and-twenty thousand of them, all of a
  size, not in pairs, but polygamous; being shaped so admirably, as to fit
  either human foot alike. They passed a triumphant examination, and were
  happily shipped to a Spanish port, which fell into the hands of Marshal
  Soult, on the very day of their arrival.</p>

  <p>That great commander rejoiced exceedingly; for his men were bare-footed,
  from running away; and he rigged out eleven thousand Gallic heroes, in
  captured British leather&mdash;or the like. On the very next day, a great
  battle came off, and the right side won it,&mdash;that is to say, ours. Then
  every Frenchman (shot, lanced, or taken prisoner) was proved to be as lame as
  a cock on a glassed wall; and although no allowance was made for that
  drawback, the hand of Providence was discovered in it. It was useless for
  Touchwood to deny that he had foreseen this result, and produced, at great
  outlay, a patriotic stratagem. In a word, with no more waste of time, than
  was needful for the British Cabinet to conceive, ponder, and deliver a large
  budget of jokes at the Frenchman's expense, of his vain attempt to fill
  British leather, and getting into the wrong pair of shoes, etc.&mdash;amid
  public applause, they made the contractor a baronet, instead of paying
  him.</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph would liefer have received the money; for the shoes stood him
  fairly in 9<i>d.</i> a-piece; and he counted for a further loss his non-gain
  of three shillings, upon every one of them. He had no honest ground for
  complaint however, having run a good cargo of French goods homeward, as well
  as established a permanent basis for supplying the French, through the rest
  of that campaign, with slop-flannel trousers, as blue as their legs.</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph worked harder than ever, although universally respected by this
  time. And though he cared little for empty honour, he loved fame, when it led
  to business. Lady Touchwood began to think more of his opinion, and allowed
  him no longer to be called, "our Joe." He flourished exceedingly; but stuck
  to business still, and left all the decorative part to her. This lady was an
  admirable wife, and mother, kind, warm-hearted, full of interest in things
  that were no concern of hers, an excellent adviser, when not consulted, as
  good to the poor as they would let her be, vigilant in her own household, and
  resolute in having her own way always. The most captious of critics could
  find no fault in her, except that she was obstinate, imperious,
  narrow-minded, and ridiculously passionate, when "put out." And a very little
  thing was enough to put her out; though she always believed it to be
  monstrous.</p>

  <p>"Now I call it very good of you, to come to me so promptly;" she
  exclaimed, holding out both hands to Mr. Short. "I always like people to do
  that, so much. Never mind anything. Do sit down."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short bowed pleasantly, but made no pretty speech; though the ladies
  still expected such politeness from the gentlemen. For he knew that this lady
  would only cut short his oration.</p>

  <p>"I am the most persecuted person in the world," she continued, glancing
  sadly at a statuette of Dido; "no, she was not to be compared to me, and she
  did burn the villain who betrayed her!"</p>

  <p>"Sir Joseph?" inquired Mr. Short with some surprise, but too wary to
  correct the lady's memory of the Æneid.</p>

  <p>"Sir Joseph! How can you be so exceedingly provoking? Sir Joseph is a
  model; and besides that, he knows better. It is my daughter, Julia."</p>

  <p>"I am grieved indeed," Mr. Short said softly, and dropping his eyes, lest
  they should gleam with any levity. "The young lady promised to behave so
  well; and she seemed so truly sorry, so affectionate, and dutiful, after
  having shown a little&mdash;temper perhaps, on Monday."</p>

  <p>"Then, you shall hear how she has kept her promise. This morning, without
  provocation or excuse, she packed up all her property, and she left my
  house!"</p>

  <p>"Surely, there must have been something more than usual?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. You shall judge for yourself. She is constantly pretending to
  have judgments of her own, and to use what she calls her reasoning powers. No
  good ever comes of such a thing as that. But she is at liberty to do it, when
  she pleases; so long as she only agrees with me. But to argue against her own
  mother, Mr. Short!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Touchwood, I agree with you, that it is wrong. But of course, with
  your superior intellect, you convinced her of her error."</p>

  <p>"That I did thoroughly. I boxed her ears; until they were as red as the
  things they make sauce of. Oh, it was such a satisfaction to me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Short stared a little, though he knew the lady's temper. Then he
  thought of the haughty tall Julia, whom he admired with a distant fervency.
  Julia, with her pretty ears as red as ripe tomatoes!</p>

  <p>"I hurt my poor hands shockingly, with her nasty brilliants. It was too
  bad of her." Lady Touchwood exhibited her dimpled, but vigorous palms, with
  pink lines on them. "She went to bed, as I thought, in a chastened spirit;
  and I told her to pray for a better frame of mind. But instead of that, she
  has done what I tell you."</p>

  <p>"But you know where she is? You have ascertained that, otherwise you would
  be in great tribulation. Is she gone to her father, at Plymouth?"</p>

  <p>"Not she indeed. Sir Joseph has too much high principle, to encourage her;
  though he would, no doubt, if he dared; because she can do exactly as she
  likes with him."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps, to her aunt at Ivybridge? I am sure that you know; or you
  would be more sorry for what you have done, Lady Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"I do the right thing, and I defy the consequence. But I know where the
  hussy is well enough. I ought to have taken her purse away. She has hired a
  post-chaise, and driven off forsooth, in noble state, to Westcombe Hall."</p>

  <p>"To Colonel Westcombe's place! I had not the least idea, even that you
  knew him. I have spoken of him, and you made no sign." Mr. Short looked
  surprised, for he was thinking&mdash;"Well, you can hold your tongue, when
  you please, as well as people of better temper."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear yes," replied Lady Touchwood, as if she were surprised at his
  surprise; "we have known Colonel Westcombe, for years and years, in fact he
  is Julia's godfather, and immensely proud she is of him. But
  circumstances&mdash;well you know, there was no particular reason why one
  should go running after him, until he came into that large property; and
  that, as you must be aware, was not at all expected."</p>

  <p>"It is an honour to any one, to know Colonel Westcombe. Land, or no land,
  rich, or poor, no circumstances make any difference in his value."</p>

  <p>"I dare say. But still, you know, it adds to his charms, to be in a good
  position. Sir Joseph was thinking of inviting him to dinner; but I must see
  first, how he behaves about my daughter. If he encourages poor Julia in her
  headstrong violence, and evil tempers, he shall never sit down in this house,
  Mr. Short."</p>

  <p>"Whatever he does will be right, Lady Touchwood, whatever your opinion may
  be about it. And now, though I am not the clergyman of your parish, you have
  given me the right to speak, by sending for me. And setting aside all the
  folly of your conduct, I must tell you, that it is very wrong."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short spoke strongly; for he feared no one, and cared very little for
  the temper of any woman, except his own Mrs. Aggett. He expected to be shown
  to the door, with much despatch. But instead of that, his hostess bore meekly
  with him, and even seemed to listen with attention. For she knew in her
  heart, that she had gone a little too far, peradventure, and she respected
  the established church; whenever she was not furious. In her youth, she had
  been a quiet, gentle-looking person, with large blue eyes, and a plump round
  face, and delicate complexion. But, even then, the doubling of the chin, the
  bold cut of nostril, and fulness of the eyelid, showed that mischief might
  come out, and patience not strike root in age.</p>

  <p>"Is your homily over?" she inquired with a smile, which saved her words
  from rudeness; for like many other quick-tempered persons, she had a very
  pretty smile, to put her in the right. "You are famous for very short
  sermons, with a very great deal in them. How I wish you were our vicar here,
  instead of Mr. Barker! He always goes on, for three quarters of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Barker is a very sound and excellent divine. Many of my people long for
  him. I always get him over, for collection-Sundays. He draws half-a-crown,
  where I draw a shilling. My farmers say, 'short time makes short wages.' But,
  what have you sent for me to do, about your fair deserter?"</p>

  <p>"To advise me, Mr. Short; because you are so clever. People are so liable
  to misunderstand me. They never make allowance for the trials I encounter.
  Sir Joseph is all the week long at his office; and I have to go through every
  hardship by myself. Even if he were here, this moment, I could not allow him
  to interfere; because he is so one-sided. He looks upon Julia, as a perfect
  angel, because she understands his snuff so well. She gets on her father's
  blind side so cleverly, the crafty young time-server!"</p>

  <p>"But your son, Lady Touchwood&mdash;your admirable son?"</p>

  <p>"Dicky is a model of every known virtue; but he spends all his time, with
  the rat-catcher's dogs. At this time of year, it is most important to get the
  rats thinned off, you know. And, besides that, he takes such extraordinary
  views, that he goes against me very often. I have felt it my duty, to have
  this matter kept from him, for fear of his taking it, in an unbecoming
  manner."</p>

  <p>"Which means, in plain English, that he would side with his sister. It was
  very good of her, to go away, without involving him. But something must be
  done, and done at once, if possible. You have not allowed the servants to
  discover, I suppose, the cause of this sudden departure."</p>

  <p>"Their opinions are nothing whatever to me. If they form nasty ones, I
  discharge them. But Julia has much more dignity, I should hope, than to
  whine, about what she has brought upon herself. She could not help feeling,
  that she brought it on herself."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," replied Mr. Short, to avoid that difficult subject, "we
  may treat the matter, as a simple visit of the young lady to her dear
  godfather. The servants, and the stable-men, may be wroth, at being dispensed
  with, or endeavour to be so; but upon the whole, the less they have to do,
  the more thoroughly they enjoy it. You, on the other hand, show no anxiety,
  but leave the fair fugitive to her own devices. She, in her exile, begins to
  pine for her birds, and her books, her flowers, her piano, and her pet dog,
  Elfie."</p>

  <p>"No, not Elfie. She has taken that wretch with her. You may trust her,
  never to stir a yard, without darling Elfie. She may pine, as you say, if she
  is capable of it; but surely, the first thing she should pine for, is her own
  good mother."</p>

  <p>"So she will, and very painfully indeed. And the end of it is, that she
  writes a touching letter, and comes home, with a wholesome knowledge, that
  the ears must expiate the tongue's offences."</p>

  <p>"You know nothing at all about her," Lady Touchwood answered, with a
  mother's smile. "What does a bachelor know of women? They calculate on them,
  from their own reason. For instance, do you think, that I could wait a month,
  with my daughter in the hands of other people, and learning all sorts of
  tricks, against her own mother? I can be very patient, and most
  long-suffering, when I am convinced that my trials require it. But as for
  sitting down like this, and thinking, and hoping for people to be reasonable,
  your own sense must show you that I never, never could put up with it. Surely
  you must have some wiser plan than that!"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you then, what I will do, if you think fit. I will call upon
  my old friend, Colonel Westcombe, if you wish me to do so, and see Miss
  Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"Not as if you came from me, of course. Julia would get the upper hand
  directly. But why not go to-day, Mr. Short? The days are getting nice and
  long, and it is not very far."</p>

  <p>"Twelve good miles, as the crow flies," said her visitor, thinking to
  himself that she deserved some brisk anxiety; "and the crow would have many
  steep hills, to fly over. My horse took me forty miles yesterday, and more.
  And if I went now, it would look as if you were devoured with regret, and
  penitence, and that would be below your dignity. To-morrow, I have an
  engagement of importance. But, unless you send to stop me, I shall make a
  point of being there in good time, on Saturday morning. You will see her on
  Saturday, by dinner-time; it takes a little time, to get over such
  things."</p>

  <p>"It ought to be sooner, but it must not be later. Remember that Sir Joseph
  will be home that evening; and if he should not have done well, that week, he
  might make a whole string of troublesome inquiries. You must not think me
  selfish. That is the last thing to be said of me. But I like people to be
  considerate to me, and amiable, and sweet-tempered. And I have a good right
  to expect it, Mr. Short, for I am always so to others&mdash;when they let
  me."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, I see. But how fond you are of self-examination, Lady Touchwood!
  Is it because you find the result so favourable?"</p>

  <p>"I am never put out, by sarcastic speeches; because I don't understand
  them. I hope you will come, and dine with us on Sunday, if that dreadful Mrs.
  Aggett will allow you."</p>

  <p>The vicar was never ashamed to say, that he heartily loved a good dinner.
  How many a parson has got his living, by knowing what good living is?
  Wherefore are college kitchens far more glorious than the lecture-rooms, and
  why does the buttery excel the chapel? Therefore Mr. Short said yes, with a
  very cheerful countenance; and observed with tender resignation, as he rode
  home through the park, that the fattest of the bucks was absent.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER VII. &mdash; HOUSE-BREAKING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As with many species of monoecious plants, so with some
  families of human kind, the female flower transcends the male, in beauty,
  size, and dignity. In all these points, Sir Joseph Touchwood, and Richard,
  his only son, fell far below the mark of the ladies they belonged to. The
  father, and founder, was an admirable man, when regarded from a national,
  that is to say, from a business point of view. He had never been known,
  except by himself, to miss a chance of getting on; and from day to day, he
  became more honest, as his character increased. Plymouth began to respect him
  deeply, as she found his vigour enlarge her trade, and some Radical
  deputations begged him to go up to Parliament. However, he had too much sense
  for that; and managed to get out of it, without offence to any one. But
  several of his school-fellows, who had not got on so well, thoroughly agreed
  with one another, that "Sandy Joe" (as they still called him) was making a
  fool of himself, in building, over there by Dartmoor, that popinjay,
  pack-of-cards, peep-show thing, like the Lord Mayor's coach in London; and,
  unless they were very much mistaken, such a stuck-up lot would come down
  headlong. Sir Joseph, as soon as he heard of these sentiments, proved the
  largeness of his mind, by inviting all the critics to his great
  house-warming; and the few of them who went were so well treated, that they
  put down all the rest, who had no coats to go in.</p>

  <p>A man who succeeds, with the hardest thing of all, and the highest in his
  opinion, that is to say, the money, is apt to believe that he can have his
  own way&mdash;if he chooses to assert it&mdash;in the lesser matters of life,
  such as family love, and respect, and the character of his children. The
  great contractor, perceiving that his son had no special turn for business,
  resolved to give him a fine education, and harness him afterwards, if
  needful. He sent him to a private school, and thence to Cambridge, and was
  proud to hear him called "the Cantab." The youth learned little, but was not
  dissatisfied, either with himself, or the world around him. For everybody
  looked upon him, as a pleasant fellow, free-handed, careless, and
  good-natured in his way, talkative, full of small adventures of his own, and
  not disagreeably truthful. He was never long without some mighty hero, whom
  he worshipped, for strength, or ability, or knowledge of the world, and who
  could have done better whatever was done well, and with less than a quarter
  of the trouble. Though indolent enough of mind, he was very restless bodily,
  and would keep the whole house upon the fidget, unless he got his daily
  exercise. And now, as he was missing his term at Cambridge, and no
  field-sports were toward, his mother considered it a special grace of
  Providence, in favour of her Dicky, that Dartmoor was invaded by a mighty
  host of rats. For, if there was anything that Dicky Touchwood thoroughly
  enjoyed, it was a good rat-hunt.</p>

  <p>Now the fact that every one, high or low, who possessed the pleasure of
  his acquaintance&mdash;and one need not be very high to do that&mdash;called
  him without hesitation, "Dicky Touchwood," is as clear a proof as can be
  given, of his easy, careless style. His mother, and sister, had bravely
  striven, at the dates of his breeching, and then of his horsing, and then of
  his having a tail thrown over, to redeem him from a Dicky, into Richard,
  Dick, or Richie, or even the old-fared Dickon. At each of these epochs, their
  struggle was vain; but they rallied for a final stand, upon the breastwork of
  his matriculation. For many a mile, and league around them, none, but some
  half a score of parsons, knew the meaning of that mighty word; and possibly
  it might have triumphed over nature, if the latter had not ignobly adopted
  the <i>argumentum ad hominem.</i> For the Cantab, upon his return, as
  arranged by his mother, in full academical plight, as he leaped from the
  chariot of the Park, in the presence of the whole population, upset the
  entire effect, by shouting&mdash;"Three cheers, for Dicky Touchwood!"</p>

  <p>His only sister, Julia, was of a very different order. Tall, and handsome,
  and resolute, and straight-forward, she kept her own place, and followed her
  own liking. She reigned over her father, when he was at home, and was fairly
  reducing her mother to subjection, in spite of some violent outbreaks. The
  latest of these had filled her with amazement, even more than with
  indignation; until she perceived, being very clear-sighted, that it was a
  last despairing effort, to cast off the tightening yoke. With skilful
  management on her part, it would prove the final clenching of the link. Dicky
  was a far more uncertain subject, for there was not substance enough in him
  to bind.</p>

  <p>The sportive Dicky made few inquiries, as to the reason of his sister's
  absence. When she was gone, he could have his own way, without let, or
  hindrance, until something disagreed with his mother. For he was her darling,
  her pet, and her idol, and he alone of mortals might ever contradict her. So
  now, he resolved to make the most of this fine opportunity, and be master, so
  far as he cared to be, which was chiefly in matters of sport, and of feeding.
  Ordering the household right and left, that very afternoon he sent for three
  rat-catchers, and commanded them to sink their feuds, till Sunday, and be
  ready for him at the Park-gate, the next morning, with every dog, and ferret,
  they could hear of, together with their shovels, wire-cages, knobsticks, and
  all the other items of their interesting gear. With the prospect of a guinea,
  and the certainty of beer, they were punctual as the sun, at ten o'clock; and
  a motley host of bipeds, quadrupeds, and tripods&mdash;for some of the dogs
  had only three feet left&mdash;set forth gallantly, to invade the rats of
  Dartmoor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on this same Friday morning, Mr. Arthur (generally known as
  "Captain Larks") was busy with a lot of little vines in pots, which were
  crying out for more room, and more nurture. He had brought them, from his
  span-roof forcing-house, to a little glazed building of his own construction,
  snugly ensconced beneath the cliff. And here, with half a hundred of his new
  patent pots, he was craftily preparing a delicious compost, of mealy sod,
  mellow manure, and spicy bone-dust, enough to make the little mouths of
  dainty creatures water. At this he worked hard, without sparing his hands,
  pulling asunder the fibrous clods, but not reducing them to siftage, nipping
  in twain every wireworm, and grub, carefully distributing the sweet-stuff
  from the linhay, and the benefit of happy bones, that should never ache
  again, and lightly, with his open fingers, carding up the mixture; until the
  whole was sleek, and fragrant, with the vital gifts of earth.</p>

  <p>None but a very gruff fellow, unworthy to love, or be loved by, nature,
  can minister thus to his little dependants, without ministering also to his
  own cares. Captain Larks was down-hearted, and perplexed, and quavery, when
  he drew his hand to do this work; but courage came to him, and the love of
  life, and the golden touch of hope, as he went on. The interest in other
  things beyond himself grew bright and gladsome, as he worked for good; and
  without thinking of it, he began to whistle the old English tune, "We won't
  give up." Last night he had said to himself, "I must give up. Fate is too
  much for me, and all things go against me. I must fly from this refuge of
  many quiet years, and of pet things, the fruit of my own work. I must fly
  somewhere else, and begin once more, with the loss of all the little relics
  of my money, and rheumatism settling in my left shoulder-blade. And, worst of
  all, with darling Rose astray, and quite bewildered."</p>

  <p>But now, he was hoping for the best, and well believing that fear had made
  too much of his imaginary trouble. The day was fine, and the sunshine brisk,
  enlivening mankind, and especially those, who live among the offspring of the
  sun. The soft spring air, afloat with sunbeams, brought the blue distance of
  the heavens to the earth; and the white blossoms shone upon it, as if they
  saw it. The gardener, as he plied his work, was breathing sweet contentment,
  for his heart drank in the beauty; and, better still, at every breath, he
  felt that fruit was setting.</p>

  <p>"Father, how glad I am, to see you look like your old self again!" cried
  Rose, coming in from the grass-walk. "Mr. Short is wonderfully good and kind;
  but I should simply hate him, if he were to begin to disturb your mind. You
  never ate as much as my thumb for supper; and you couldn't look worse, if I
  ran away from you."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely know, how much your thumb eats for supper," her father
  replied, as his pleasure increased, with gazing at her bright, and
  affectionate face; "but, if it has not over-eaten itself, I would beg some
  help from it, with the ball of this vine."</p>

  <p>"Now, if you don't know, papa, you ought to know," she said in a low
  voice, as they worked together; "and you ought to be punished, for not
  knowing well, that I am come to years of full discretion."</p>

  <p>"It is a fine thing, to have a good opinion of oneself. There, you have
  proved your words, by snapping this root-fibre!"</p>

  <p>Although he spoke thus, he was thinking to himself&mdash;"this daughter of
  mine is discreet, beyond her years. How she would enjoy her youth, if it were
  the same as other girls have! And how beautiful she is, the pretty
  darling!"</p>

  <p>As for that he was right beyond all doubt; though a father's pride goes
  astray sometimes, from cleaving, over-fondly, to the grooves of love. A very
  sweet face has its sweetness trebled, when tender doubt, and a light shade of
  anxiety, soften the bloom of the cheeks, and deepen the lustre of inquiring
  eyes. Rose Arthur (with the sun-gleam on her hair, and the pure white
  forehead touched with thought, and the delicate oval of the face enhanced by
  the suppliant curve of neck) was not only charming to look at, but also
  bewitching to think of afterwards.</p>

  <p>"How can I have at all a good opinion of myself," she asked her father,
  with some twinkle of a tear, "when nobody considers me of any use at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"What a bare-faced bit of fishing for a compliment! Can I ever do
  anything, without you now? And when have I failed to praise you, up to your
  deserts?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean such trumpery things as potting&mdash;or at least they are
  not at all trumpery, I know&mdash;but what I mean is great things, about
  people's lives, and reasons for doing things, and not telling other
  people."</p>

  <p>"My darling," said her father, without displeasure, for he saw that she
  was trembling at her own audacity, "I will not pretend to misunderstand you;
  neither have I any right to blame you. You want to know, why I live a
  different life from other people, whom you know; why I am so reserved, and
  lonely, and keep you shut up in this dull place."</p>

  <p>"Father, I never had such an idea. The place is quite good enough for me,
  I should hope, if it is good enough for you. And, as for being lonely, what
  more can I want, than to have you, and help you, and try to be half as good
  to you, as you are to me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my little Rosy one, that is all very fine in theory. The practice,
  however, goes otherwise; or why are you asking questions now?"</p>

  <p>"I never would have said a word, dear father, except that I cannot bear to
  see you vexed. It does not matter about myself; but when it comes to you, it
  is dreadful."</p>

  <p>"But suppose, my pet, that it is only for you, that I care much about
  anything. Suppose that, for reasons which are not my own to tell, I am bound
  to keep my darling child from the roughness of the world; and can do it only,
  by keeping outside of the world, altogether. If that were so, you would have
  faith enough, to believe that I acted for the best, and love enough not to
  increase my cares, by questions which I cannot answer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, father, I wish that I had bitten out my tongue, before I asked a
  single question. I will never be so cruel, and undutiful, again. But you will
  forgive me, for this once?"</p>

  <p>"Rosy, I am very glad you did ask. It will make things happier between us,
  on the whole. You must have thought, a thousand times, that there was
  something odd about us. It is better to make up your mind to that, than to
  live in a doubtful suspicion of it. In the course of time, you will know the
  whole. But I fear that it will not be, while I live."</p>

  <p>"Then I hope that it will never be, in this world, father. Whatever should
  I do without you? It is too dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"There now, my darling, let us talk no more about it," said the father,
  with his child's tears on his cheeks; "we have got a lot of work to do; and
  let us give our minds to it. After all, there are millions of people in the
  world, not a thousandth part so happy as you, and I, may be, while we have
  one another's love to help us."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see anybody impudent enough, to be happier than I am,
  all day long. I have never known an atom of unhappiness, in my life."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sob, to prove her words, and caught her breath quickly,
  at such a mistake. Then she tossed up a heavy pot, and turned her sleeves up,
  to show what energetic arms she had.</p>

  <p>"How they have grown in the night! Look at this!" she exclaimed, with a
  smile, that was full of delight. "Father, there is nothing, in all the world,
  more lovely than a baby vine, just when it begins to understand things, and
  offer its innocent hands to us. Look, for one moment, at this little darling;
  now, doesn't it seem to be toddling to me, with its tiny hands spread out?
  Papa, I am sure, there is nothing in the world half so beautiful as
  gardener's work. What are jewellers, or watchmakers, or ivory-carvers, or
  even painters, to compare with a genuine gardener? The things that they
  handle are dead, and artificial, and cannot know the meaning of the treatment
  they receive. But our work is living, and natural, and knows us, and adapts
  itself to follow our desires, and please us; and has its own tempers, and
  moods, and feelings, exactly the same as we have. For people to talk about
  'sensitive plants' does seem to be such sad nonsense, when every plant that
  lives is sensitive. You are very busy; but just spare time, to look at this
  holly-leafed baby vine, with every tiny point cut like a prickle, yet much
  too tender and good to prick me. It follows every motion of my hand; it
  crisps its little veinings up, whenever I come near it; and it feels, in
  every fibre, that I am looking at it."</p>

  <p>"It is in my power to swallow tales of gigantic bulk," Mr. Arthur replied,
  and then opened his mouth, to show its noble capacity; "especially, when they
  come from you, my dear. Nevertheless, after watching my vines for many years,
  I have never had the luck to receive such reciprocity. Please to show me, the
  next time you see them looking at you."</p>

  <p>"As if I would be guilty of such treachery, papa! They know that I am
  foolish, and they like me for it. But you are much too wise for them, and
  scare them of their confidence. Stop a moment; did you hear that noise again?
  There has been such a noise, going on around the beacon. The glass has
  prevented you from hearing it, I suppose. I meant to have told you, till we
  spoke of something else. There seems to be a quantity of men, and dogs, up
  there, shouting, and barking, and screaming out, and making the greatest
  uproar."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, I would strongly recommend them, to keep it outside of my
  premises. Halloa!"</p>

  <p>Well indeed might he thus exclaim. A dark bulk fell upon the glittering
  roof; at the crash a shower of flashing splinters flew, like a bursting
  firework, and a human form tumbled in, all doubled up, and rolled upon a
  newly-potted platoon of those sensitive vinelets.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he must be killed!" cried Rose, running up to him. "The poor
  unfortunate little boy! I have got his head up on a pot. Father, hold him up,
  till I get the water."</p>

  <p>Rose herself was bleeding sadly, from the arrowy sleet of glass; but
  without two thoughts, she was off, and came back, with a long-spouted can,
  and put a copper spreader on it.</p>

  <p>"No," said her father, as she held up the can, to water this gentleman
  freely; "not a drop of water. I have seen much bloodshed. Water would be
  wrong, in a case like this. Leave him to me. Run for bandages quickly; and
  send Moggy off, the short way to the village, quick foot, for Dr.
  Perperaps."</p>

  <p>Rose was off, like a deer; and the gardener began, after drawing out one
  or two splinters of glass, and placing the youth in a better position, to
  close the worst cuts, with cotton wool (which he always kept in the
  greenhouse) tightly bound with broad strips of bast. Then he soaked the wool
  with cold water; and the patient gave a long gasp, and began to look about
  him.</p>

  <p>"Not dead yet, my boys!" He tried to shout, but only muttered; "At him
  again, Tiger, at him again! Get him by the scruff, Bob; don't be an idiot.
  Hurrah, well done, Peppercorns!"</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, sir, and shut your eyes," Mr. Arthur broke in, with his
  deepest tone; and the youth stared at him, and obeyed his voice, after
  putting up his lips, as if he longed to whistle. And while his mind went
  wandering, into wonder, and distant dimness, a little dog, with all his wits
  about him, came in at the door; and, making obeisance with a tremulous tail,
  asked courteous leave to sniff at him. Mr. Arthur, being fond of dogs, said,
  "Yes;" and before this dog could have satisfied his mind, two more came in,
  to help him. But the first dog, being of a kingly order, signified to them
  that they were not wanted; and when they retired at his growl, he joined
  them, and the three held council. As sagely as any three M.D.'s they
  conducted their consultation, with their ears upon the curl, and their tails
  upon the wag, so far as men had spared them. But suddenly all three stumps
  fell flat, and quivered with humility; for, lo! there stood their worshipful
  masters, puffing, and blowing, and inclined to swear, at having only two legs
  each, to bring them down the wall of crag.</p>

  <p>"Cappen Larks, be 'un killed?" they cried, all scared to go into the
  greenhouse. "The young Squire Dicky, oh lor, oh lor; and all the vault to be
  laid on us! Back there with 'e, every one o' you chaps! Us'll lash the legs
  of any chaps, as trieth it. These be Cappen's own privy grounds, and no
  blackguards admitted in."</p>

  <p>"Be off every one of you," the owner shouted, with a smile, which went
  against his words; "or in two minutes, you will be prosecuted, with the
  utmost rigour of the law."</p>

  <p>"Cappen Larks, don't ye be so haish, for to deny us a zaight o' the poor
  Master Dicky. There never wor a better one, to work a rat out; and if a' be
  killed, us 'll niver hunt again."</p>

  <p>"My good fellows, he is not killed, and he won't be, if you will get out
  of the way. But I won't answer for it, if you come plaguing here. Be off, if
  you care for his life, this moment."</p>

  <p>"Cappen, us 'll get out of the wai, quick-sticks. It goo'th to our hearts,
  to zee 'un blading so. But, to vare up they stones again, is beyond our
  breeches."</p>

  <p>"Fare out this way, then; across the water. But tell me first how the
  young man fell, and what his name is, and where he lives."</p>

  <p>"'Twor all by rason of the bottled beer, sir. Do'e see thiccy moot-stoon,
  round the cornder? Us had a score of bottled beer, up yonner; and young
  Squire Dicky's hat were too small to hold 'un. Squire Dicky Touchwood, to
  Touchwood Park. Whatever will my lady zay to us?"</p>

  <p>"You had better, go and see; but tell her not to be uneasy. The doctor
  will be here at once; and the lad will soon come round. Clear out, this very
  instant, dogs and men."</p>

  <p>For by this time, thirty dogs, of every genealogy, were poking about,
  among the captain's pots.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; COLONEL WESTCOMBE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While the sportive Cantab thus broke into Mr. Arthur's
  humble greenhouse, his sister Julia was enjoying the keen air of the western
  moors, and passing through it swiftly, and sweetly, with the cheerful aid of
  a well-bred horse. Miss Touchwood always looked well in the saddle; and a
  lady's riding-habit was a graceful dress at that time, although the hat was
  hideous. But this young lady, thinking for herself, would not wear the
  hideous hat; but designed, in lieu thereof, a sensible and becoming
  head-gear, and got it made at Devonport. With its curving rim turned up at
  one side, and a grey feather pluming round the front, without any monstrous
  buckle, it sat lightly over her long dark eyebrows, clear eyes, and
  expressive face.</p>

  <p>"What a booty her be!" said a tramp, to whom she had thrown a shilling,
  graciously.</p>

  <p>"So her maight be," his wife replied, "so long as her getteth her own
  way."</p>

  <p>Riding with her, across the moor, was her host, and godfather, Colonel
  Westcombe, a plain, stout man, of average stature, thick-set, broad across
  the back, and looking as if no tailor's art could make his clothes sit well
  to him. But that consideration moved him not, so long as he had plenty of
  room inside them. He thought of appearances, no more than "Captain Larks"
  himself did; though he liked to see ladies nicely dressed, and young men
  looking tidy. Upon his face, his character was as clearly outlined as his
  nose&mdash;a distinct, and eloquent feature. Any one could see, that he was
  simple-minded, slow at working out the twists of thought, accustomed to let
  his ideas flow into the mould of words, before dealing with them, gently
  reluctant to think evil of mankind, concerning any matter, in which he had
  not as yet been robbed atrociously, compassionate, fearless, and as hopeful
  as a child, and properly indignant when he came across a rogue. But large as
  the field was for that right feeling, (even in those more upright days), the
  Colonel was larger than to stay there very long; for his knowledge of the
  world must not harden him so much.</p>

  <p>After many years of scrimped penurious life, such as behoves the British
  officer (especially when he has done great things, and must pay for the
  honour of doing them) this Colonel suddenly came into possession of large
  property. Diggory Westcombe, his father's elder brother, (who never would
  have anything to do with them in life, through some bitterness of blood),
  forgave upon his death-bed all the injuries he had done, and left all his
  property, when quite despaired of, to his next of kin, and right heir,
  Colonel John Westcombe.</p>

  <p>That well-known warrior, and strong sharpshooter against the sap-work of
  poverty, was amazed at being taken in the rear like this, and surrounded with
  an army bearing gifts. For a month of market-days, he was out of sorts, at
  not having to do his own marketing; for his clear sense told him, that what
  used to be economy, would now be no better than meanness. For the sake of his
  wife, whose health was weak, and of his son, who had the world before him, he
  was bound to rejoice at this access of wealth; but for himself, as he was
  laid upon the shelf, he would rather have rested on an oaken, than a golden
  one.</p>

  <p>"If you please, Uncle John," said his fair god-daughter, who had leave to
  call him so, though she was only of church-kin to him; "I cannot allow you to
  stay in this silent mood, which is growing over you."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I beg your pardon," he answered, with his simple courtesy, and
  pleasantness; "I am sure, I would have talked, if I had anything to say. But
  surely with all this noble prospect&mdash;hills, and valleys, and
  watercourses, and the gorse coming out, and the sheep, and the
  ponies&mdash;you would much rather look about, than talk.</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment; I am used to all that. It comes, and goes, just the
  same, and tells me nothing. I would rather have one of your stories of the
  war, than all the hills of Dartmoor, and the valleys full of water, and the
  sheep, that must terminate in tough mutton. And the beauty of your stories is
  that they must be true; because you always tell them, in the very same words,
  and with the very same look, every time."</p>

  <p>"What a prosaic companion you have got! They say that Charles II. told his
  stories always so; but I hope that I resemble him, in few other points. Now,
  which of my stories do you wish me to begin?"</p>

  <p>"The two, Uncle John; the famous pair, which you promise to tell, when you
  have had a good dinner. You must know the two I mean, as well as I do. The
  first is, about the bravest man you ever met with; and the second ought to
  be, about the noblest man. The one I have heard always makes me proud of
  being born in England. I would rather hear such, than see fifty miles of
  moorland, or even a waterfall fifty feet high; because they stir me into
  great ideas, without making me seem small. Oh, how can poor Dicky spend the
  best of his time in rat-hunting?"</p>

  <p>"Different people look at things, from different points of view, my dear,"
  said the colonel, who liked a rat-hunt himself, and also was fond of a
  waterfall, and a fine view from the saddle. For although he never noticed
  things, particularly much, he was pleased that they should pass by him
  nicely, without obliging him to think, any more than change of air might do.
  "As long as I can remember, Julia, I have been an admirer of fine landscapes;
  and, indeed, I saw very beautiful things, in Spain; yet I do not know enough
  about such matters, to deny that&mdash;that what you may call human affairs
  should have the preference. Certainly the bravest man, I ever yet have met
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Uncle John, if you dare to begin it like that, you will flounder before
  you have come to the snuff place; and if you were to hesitate, you would
  begin to shake my perfect faith in it."</p>

  <p>"Julia, is it possible that you can entertain the mere shadow of a doubt,
  about the very least particular? If I could imagine, that you did that, you
  should never again&mdash;I mean that I should never take any further
  pleasure, in relating to you that, or any other fact again."</p>

  <p>"Now, Uncle John, you really must not be so exceedingly savage, and
  peppery. You begin to remind me of&mdash;well, never mind."</p>

  <p>"My dear," said the colonel, "I beg your pardon heartily, if I have
  hastily expressed myself. I am well aware, that I sometimes do so; since I
  came into what people will insist upon calling my improved position. But I
  never mean anything by it, my dear child; and I am always sorry
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Then you have no right to be so, and ought to go on more. Your only fault
  is, that you are too fond of letting people triumph over you. But now be
  quick, that's a dear Uncle John, and make amends by beginning it aright. You
  know that it always begins, like this,&mdash;'Towards the close of the
  hardest, perhaps, of the many hard conflicts our great commander'&mdash;but
  stop, till I come the right way of the wind."</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure," her companion answered, as the young lady drew her
  horse to the leeward side of his, and looked at him, with an encouraging
  smile; "that it is in my power to do justice to that remarkable little
  incident, while I am riding a fast-trotting horse. I was thoroughly used to a
  horse in my youth, for my father did afford to keep one, and I was on his
  back perpetually. And in the Peninsula, I have ridden some thousands of
  miles, with despatches. But, for five-and-twenty years, since I have not been
  wanted, our circumstances did not permit of much riding; and it takes a
  little time to be comfortable again."</p>

  <p>"You ride like a Centaur, Uncle John. It is impossible for anybody to ride
  better. But still I can easily understand, that you like to do things in the
  regular way. Look, here are two great stones that seem to have dropped from
  the sky, on purpose to be sat upon. Suppose we jump off, and rest the horses;
  and you can enjoy all the landscape, while you talk."</p>

  <p>By the side of the long and lonely track, these hoary granite blocks
  invited the traveller to a breezy rest. A tranquil mind would not have found
  that invitation marred, because accepted, through long ages now, by those who
  have the rest, without the breeze. The stones are the well-known
  "Coffin-stones;" whereat, for more than six hundred years, the bearers of the
  dead across the moor have halted from their heavy plod, laid down their
  burden on the stones, to take its latest stretch of mountain, and spread
  their own bodies on the grass around, to talk of what would happen to
  themselves ere long. Of these things the young lady had no knowledge, else
  would she never have sat down there; neither did her companion know; but the
  knowledge would not have moved him, more than to make him sit
  bare-headed.</p>

  <p>"Let the poor things graze; the grass is sweet," he said, as he took the
  bridles off; and the nags, after jerking their noses with surprise, pricked
  their ears forward&mdash;not enough for him to catch them&mdash;and looked at
  him with well-meaning doubt. "Yes, you go, and crop, I say. The Lord has
  given you good teeth. And be sure you come at once, when you hear me
  whistle."</p>

  <p>Obedient to his voice, they went, with a little tenderness of step at
  first, because it was long since they had crushed the blade; but presently
  the joy of nature's colour, and the taste, broke forth in them; they pranced,
  and threw up their heels, and capered; and the gentleman's horse made his
  stirrups clash beneath him, then fearing to waste one precious moment, they
  fell to, and worked the best mowing machine that has ever been invented. The
  colonel, more happy than a king, smiled at them, rested on his elbow, and
  began his tale.</p>

  <p>"Towards the close of the hardest, perhaps, of the many hard conflicts our
  great commander won, by the aid of a gracious Providence, and his own
  unwearied vigilance; although the position of the enemy was turned, and the
  issue of the day scarcely doubtful, one very important post held out, and had
  repulsed all our attempts to carry it. The difficulties of the ground were
  great; not only was the approach very steep, and intersected by a
  watercourse, but also the French artillery, beautifully served, at grapeshot
  range, poured a crossing fire upon our attack. At the same time, our own guns
  could not be brought to bear, with any good effect, upon this crest, which
  was defended with admirable spirit, by a body of seasoned veterans, as calm,
  and steady, as our very best brigade. In short, there seemed no chance of
  carrying the position, without fearful sacrifice; or even with it.</p>

  <p>"The line of the enemy, as I have said, was being driven in, at almost
  every other point; and our great commander, perceiving that we must
  eventually obtain this post, sent orders that, as we could not take it, we
  should maintain our position, until the post was taken for us.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen,&mdash;or rather I should say, 'my dear,'&mdash;it is
  impossible for me to make you understand, what the feeling of our division
  was, when we received that message."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Uncle John, I can understand it thoroughly. I should have been ready
  to knock my head, against the first French cannon I could find. But here you
  always take a pinch of snuff, with permission of the ladies, if any are
  present. You have my permission, and more than that, my orders. You will
  never take that post, without it."</p>

  <p>"I know how incapable I am," resumed the colonel, in a loftier tone, "of
  describing the condition of the human mind; but all around me being
  Englishmen&mdash;or, at least, an English lady&mdash;I need only say, that we
  were vexed. Because we had always supposed ourselves&mdash;whether rightly,
  or wrongly, is not for me to say&mdash;to be the flower of the whole British
  army. Every man of us was burning to be at it, once again; and yet we knew
  better, than to set at nought our orders, by attempting another direct
  assault. I remember, as if I were looking at him now, how the indomitable
  General H&mdash;, turned from the staff-officer, and spat upon the ground, to
  save himself from swearing at our great commander. But while we were all of
  us as red as a rocket, a young fellow, who had lately joined our division, a
  lieutenant in the 'Never mind what Hussars,' as we called them from their
  recklessness, came sheepishly up to our General H&mdash;, and asked for a
  private word with him. The general knew something of his family, I believe;
  and that makes no small difference, even with the strictest discipline. So,
  in spite of his temper, which was very bad just then, he led the young man
  apart; and presently came back, with his usual smile recovered, while the
  young man remounted his horse, and rode away.</p>

  <p>"To us, it had been a most irksome thing, to wait there, doing nothing,
  but hearing in the distance the laughter of the enemy, and receiving, now and
  then, a round shot; and when there was a call for some forty volunteers, who
  could handle an axe, and haul trees away, the only trouble was to choose the
  men. Having been lucky enough to do something, which pleased the general,
  that morning, and being rather supple-jointed in those days, I obtained the
  command of this little detachment, under very simple orders. Our duty was
  nothing more than to draw three corks, as the general said, with a laugh at
  his own wit; and I never draw a cork now, or get it done for me&mdash;since I
  lost the right of doing my own work&mdash;without thinking, what a hard job
  it was, on that occasion.</p>

  <p>"It seems, that the young man, I told you of just now, was very fond of
  wandering among the woods alone, whenever he could get the opportunity,
  without actual breach of orders; and he had just recognized the spur of the
  hill, which the enemy held so stubbornly, as a spot well known to him from a
  former visit. And unless his memory deceived him altogether, a narrow neck of
  land would be found, running down slantwise from the hill on our right, into
  the very heart of the position. With a hundred, or a hundred and fifty horse,
  dashing down upon the guns, while engaged in front, the whole must fall into
  our hands at once. Only there was no possibility of a charge, while three
  young cork-trees, which stood upon the neck, at its narrowest point, were
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Now the difficulty was, as you will see at once, if you honour me by
  following my story, gentlemen, not only to cut down those three trees, but to
  get them clean out of the way, ere ever the enemy should have time to learn
  what was intended, and bring their guns to bear in that direction. In such a
  case, cavalry crowded together would simply be blown away, like wads; so that
  we were forced to go to work very warily, taking advantage of the sham attack
  in front.</p>

  <p>"The trees were quite young, and the softness of the bark dulled the sound
  of our axes, as well as their edge; and being partly sheltered from the
  outlook of the enemy, by the form of the ground, we were getting on quite
  nicely, and had cleared away two of the trees, and felled the third, and were
  rolling it out of the way, before giving the signal for the charge, when the
  whistle of grape-shot told us that we had been discovered. One man fell, and
  we lifted him aside, that the horses might not tread on him; and then at any
  risk, I gave the signal; because it must be now or never. Our volunteers were
  ordered to slip off, right and left, as two other guns were brought to bear
  on us; but my duty compelled me, very much against my liking, to stop in the
  middle of the drift, to show our cavalry where the obstruction was. For the
  smoke was hanging low upon the ground, just like a fog.</p>

  <p>"Now while I stood there, without any consideration, and spread out like a
  finger-post&mdash;for I had not the courage to be careful&mdash;the enemy
  sent another volley up the drift, and much of it fell to my share. So that if
  they had measured their powder aright, I had never lived to find fault with
  it. Down I went, just in the stream of the track, and for three months heard
  no more of it.</p>

  <p>"But the men at the side, who were out of the way, gave a very clear
  history of what happened, when the shower of grape went past them. The
  charge, which must have trampled me to death, was stopped by the young
  officer commanding, with a wave of his sword, and his horse reined across;
  and then he leaped off, and came alone to where I lay. In the thickest of the
  fire, he lifted me, they said, as calmly as a nurse takes a baby from the
  cradle, and placed me behind the cork-tree, where shot could never touch me,
  and the hoof must turn aside. Then he tore off the scarf from his neck, and
  bound up a wound, that was draining my body: while the Frenchmen perceived
  him, as the smoke rolled off, and like truly noble fellows, forbore their
  fire. He kissed his hand to them, in acknowledgment of this; and then
  shouting to them that the fighting was resumed, returned to his horse, gave
  the signal to charge, and carried their guns in a twinkling. Now, such a deed
  as that makes one proud to be an Englishman."</p>

  <p>"Or even a good Frenchman," fair Julia replied. "I scarcely know, which of
  them behaved the best. And though you make so little of your own part, I
  think you were the hero of the whole thing, Uncle John. But of course you
  found out the young officer's name? And now for the other story, Uncle John.
  I have heard this story of the bravest man, a lot of times; and I like it
  better almost every time. But I have never heard the story of the noblest
  man; and I dare say that is finer still."</p>

  <p>"It is," the colonel answered, in his simple way. "But I never like to
  tell that tale, in cold blood, or before my dinner. And even so, I must have
  people, who can enter into it. And even then, one ought to have a heavy cold,
  to explain the condition of the eyes that comes of it."</p>

  <p>"The heavy cold you will certainly have; if you sit on these cold stones
  so long. And here comes a hailstorm, the delicate attention of soft April to
  Dartmoor. Oh, I shall be blind, if it goes on like this. Whistle for the
  horses, uncle, dear."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE RED-FACED MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before "the ever loyal city," as Exeter loves to call
  itself, was undermined with iron bars, beneath its castle-ramparts,
  Northernhay was a quiet place, aside of the noisy London road, and pleasant
  for a Sunday walk. Here, in a good old ivied house, snugly encompassed by
  thick cob walls, was living, and well deserved to live, a gentleman of the
  ancient name of "Tucker." Also his Christian name was ancient; being "Caleb,"
  and no more.</p>

  <p>This gentleman lived with his widowed sister, Mrs. Giblets, late of
  Barnstaple, whose two boys went to the high grammar-school, as often as they
  could not help it. The deceased Mr. Giblets, a currier of repute, had thrice
  been Mayor of Barnstaple, and had sacrificed his life to his festive duties,
  at the time of the Reform Bill. His relict was a lady of like dignity, and
  virtue, convinced (as all Barum people are) of the vast superiority of that
  town; yet affable to the Mayor of Exeter. Their daughter, Mary Giblets, was a
  very nice young lady, a thorough girl of Devon, with a round rosy face, a
  smile for everybody, and almost at everything, a pair of brisk substantial
  feet, and a special turn for marketing.</p>

  <p>Caleb Tucker, the owner of the house, but not the master always, had long
  been in business, as a timber-merchant, and still would make a purchase, or a
  sale, upon occasion, although he had retired from the firm, which he had
  reared. Honesty, industry, enterprise, and prudence, had won for him nearly
  quite enough of money, to live upon happily, and want no more. In the vigour
  of life, when the hearts of men are as quick of warmth, as a fire at its
  prime, he had incurred a very serious loss, never to be balanced in <i>£ s.
  d.</i> The wife of his love, and the little ones of theirs, went all to the
  grave, between a Sunday and a Saturday, through a storm of fever, called in
  Devonshire "the plague." This sorrow took the zeal out of his existence, and
  left him a grave, well-balanced man, who had learned that the poise of life
  is not troy-weight.</p>

  <p>Now, in the holiday of calm age, Caleb Tucker was a venerable person; slow
  to move, except with pity; and tranquil in the steadfast hope of finding, in
  a larger world, the losses of this little one. His sister was twenty years
  younger than himself, and her children were his successors; and he meant to
  do his duty to his own kin, instead of founding charities, to be jobbed by
  aliens. Under these circumstances, it was right of Mrs. Giblets, to make much
  of him, and encourage him to save, and increase, his cash.</p>

  <p>"How sudden the changes of the weather seem to be!" he was saying to his
  sister, as they sat out in the garden, on the Saturday, the very day after
  the colonel's tale had been hurried by the hailstorm; "the spring weather
  never used to change like this; at least when the turn of the days was over.
  How bright it was yesterday, until it began to rain! Then the hills, towards
  Dartmoor, were covered with snow, or hail, or whatever it may have been."</p>

  <p>"It must have been either hail, or snow, if it was white," Mrs. Giblets
  replied, being proud of perfect accuracy; "the weather is continually
  changing; but the only white things in it are snow, and hail."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mollikins, and frost as well. It might have been the white
  frost on the moors. But whatever it was, it made me think, this morning, as I
  looked at it from my bedroom window, of that poor gentleman I bought the land
  for. He has made such a beautiful garden up there, and I fear that the frost
  will destroy all his bloom."</p>

  <p>"He must suffer the will of the Lord, I suppose; as everybody else is
  obliged to do. Sometimes I lose my patience with him; because you never tell
  me, who he is. Why should a gentleman come down here, and buy a little
  far-off place like that, and work like a common labourer? No one would dare
  to attempt such a thing, in the neighbourhood of Barnstaple. It would be the
  duty of the mayor, to find him out. But in this part of the world,
  conspirators carry on, just as they please."</p>

  <p>"Sister, you talk a great deal too fast. If you ever know the truth, you
  will be sorry for your words. Women are so fond of rushing to the worst
  conclusions."</p>

  <p>"Some of them do so; but whose fault is it? You know that I do the very
  opposite, Caleb, whenever I am not denied the knowledge. I wish, with all my
  heart, that I had never heard about him; although I liked him very much, the
  only time I saw him. But I always take things, as I find them. I have no
  curiosity whatever, about anything."</p>

  <p>"Molly, you are very wise," answered Mr. Tucker; "we have all of us enough
  of trouble, with our own affairs. And here comes pretty Mary, for to tell us
  something pleasant."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, uncle, it is quite the other way," cried Mary, as she hurried
  up the walk, from the side-door; "I took the short cut, and I left all the
  nuts I was buying for Bob, and for Harry, to tell you not to see the
  man&mdash;or the gentleman at least, who is riding up the hill, to look for
  you. Oh, uncle, dear, he is such a nasty man; and has the evil eye, if ever
  anybody had it! Oh dear, I turned my Testament in my pocket&mdash;mischief
  will come of it, as sure as I'm alive."</p>

  <p>"If ever there was a little goose, in the King's, or rather, in the
  Queen's dominions now, her name is Mary Giblets." Though he spoke thus
  bravely, Mr. Tucker did not like it; and his sister said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mary, fie for shame! Look at your gathers, Miss!"</p>

  <p>"I had no time to think about anything at all," she answered, with her
  colour ripened, from the peach-bloom into peach; "he was asking at Besley's,
  and Snell's, and Sharland's, where Mr. Caleb Tucker lived; and he called you
  'the land-agent.' Mr. Snell told him, you had never been that, but a strictly
  retired gentleman; and then the man laughed&mdash;such a nasty laugh, mamma;
  and young Tom Besley, who is always such a stupid, looked up from the copper
  mill, where he was grinding pepper, and he says, 'That young lady will show
  you, sir; that's his own niece, Miss Giblets.' I felt, as if I could have
  boxed his ears. And the red-faced man rode up to me, with his hat off, and
  said, 'Miss Giblets, will you be my charming guide?' And I couldn't think of
  anything to say; he looked so impudent. But I made him a curtsy, and began
  walking up the hill; and then I thought to myself, that I would pay him out.
  So I turned down Black Horse Alley, towards the cut across parson's meadow
  (which is the nearest way, you know) and left him to follow, or not, as he
  pleased. Well, it pleased him to come, and to want to talk to me; just as if
  I were nothing but a shop-girl. I looked at him, over my shoulder, now and
  then; and said yes and no, for a quarter of a mile; and likely, he considered
  me as stupid as Tom Besley. Then suddenly, we came upon the high turn-stile
  of parson's meadow, where the bull is; and I slipped through, like anything.
  'Halloa! Do you expect me to ride over this?' he said. And I said, 'Oh dear!
  Oh dear! How very stupid of me! But you only asked me for the shortest way,
  sir. I dare not stop, to give you any more directions, because of the bull,
  in the bottom of the ham.' And away I ran, and here I am."</p>

  <p>"My darling, what a risk to run! I have told you not to do it," her mother
  exclaimed, as she finished her tale; "that bull has tossed three people."</p>

  <p>"I am ten times more afraid of a bad man, than a bull. Now be sure that
  you refuse to see him, Uncle Caleb."</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Mr. Tucker, "you are scarcely old enough, to be reproached
  with want of reason. I dare say, the gentleman has no harm in him; although
  he may be a little forward. If so, he had his match in a very modest girl;
  though one of strong prejudices, I am afraid. Let us go into the house;
  perhaps he will be here directly."</p>

  <p>Before they had time to put their garden-chairs away, the rusty wire
  beneath the thatch of the warm cob-wall, that sheltered them, gave a slow,
  reluctant, creaking jerk, and then a quick rattle, as it was pulled again;
  and the big bell, swinging in the ivy of the house-porch, threw up its mouth,
  like a cow about to bellow, and fell back upon its wagging tongue, through a
  rustle of crisp leafage. "Let him ring again," said Mr. Tucker; "when a man
  is in a hurry, I have known it do him good. Don't go away, sister; I will see
  him here. I am too old a soldier, to be carried by storm, in this way. Mary,
  you be off, my dear; as if the bull was after you."</p>

  <p>Miss Giblets withdrew, but much against her will, for she had a fine stock
  of healthy curiosity, and had made up her mind, that the red-faced man was
  come upon an interesting errand. Then Bill, the boy of all work, came
  grinning, with a card in one hand, and a shilling in the other. "A' gied me
  this," he said, showing first the shilling, as the more important object of
  the two. "Be I to kape 'un, or gie 'un to you?"</p>

  <p>"Gie 'un to your mother," replied his master, as he took the card, and
  read the words "Mr. George Gaston," with no address beneath them.</p>

  <p>"Ha, sir, and how are you to-day?" The visitor shouted, with a hearty
  voice. "I have taken the liberty of following my pasteboard. I hope I see the
  lady quite well also. Madam, your servant! I am quite old-fashioned. I glory
  in the society of the ladies; but my manners are comparatively out of date, I
  fear."</p>

  <p>The widow of the mayor possessed a shrewd tongue, as well as a stately
  reserve, sometimes; and the former was burning to say, that the sooner such
  manners were positively out of date, the better. Like her daughter, the lady
  conceived an extraordinary hatred of this man, at sight; but she only showed
  it, by a careful bow, and a gaze of reasonable surprise.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir&mdash;Mr. Gaston, I suppose," said Caleb Tucker, rising
  slowly, and lifting his hat from his silvery curls; "but I doubt not that, if
  you are come upon business, you have brought me a letter of introduction; I
  do very little in the way of business now, and only with people, who are
  known to me. And I have not the honour of remembering your name."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right. Everything you do is right, according to the account
  I have received of you. Shall I take this chair? But it would make me
  wretched, to think that I had banished Mrs. Tucker."</p>

  <p>"That lady is my sister, sir&mdash;Mrs. Giblets, formerly of
  Barnstaple."</p>

  <p>"Bless my heart! I never heard of such a thing. Have I met Mrs. Giblets at
  last, without knowing her? My cousin, Sir Courtenay, is always speaking of
  her, and her graceful, and refined hospitality. But too exclusive&mdash;he
  told me as much. Like all the superior ladies, you are too exclusive, Mrs.
  Giblets."</p>

  <p>"That charge has been brought against me, I confess," the lady replied
  with dignity; "but wherever would you be, sir, without you drew a line,
  between wholesale, and retail?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Giblets retired, with a gracious bow, but some doubt still about the
  good faith of the visitor; for although he was older than herself, as her
  conscience (which she always consulted on the subject) told her, he wore a
  red-striped neckerchief, and a cut-away coat, of bright green, with gilt
  buttons. Moreover, his voice was loud and harsh, his manner too bold, his
  figure burly, and his gestures impatient, and almost imperious; while his
  face, though resolute and rather handsome, expressed, more than impressed,
  good opinion of himself. His forehead was high and square, his eyes piercing
  but not steadfast, his nose strong and aquiline, and chin very firm, and
  prominent. But the colour of the cheeks was fiercely red, the mouth very wide
  and voracious; and instead of a curve at the hinges of the jaws, there
  occurred a conspicuous angle. Boys, who have powers of observation, happily
  extinguished in later life, dubbed him at school, "George Coffin-face;" but
  when his brow expanded, the name no longer suited him, except as regards the
  part below the ears, where a few white whiskers showed the harshness of the
  angle, now become more prominent, from years of zealous exercise; while his
  very florid colour, and thick crop of tawny hair, gave abundance of life to
  his countenance.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Tucker, I have ridden a long way," he began, after looking round,
  and bringing his chair nearer, "upon a matter, really of no importance to me,
  in any other light than this&mdash;that I may do a kindness, and help a
  fellow-creature. Probably, I shall not even earn so much as thanks; and you
  know how little those are worth. I do not pretend to be moved by any Quixotic
  ardour, or Christian duty, or broad philanthropy, or any romantic motive. But
  a sense of gratitude for a good turn done me, five-and-twenty years ago,
  together with some natural desire to baffle selfish roguery&mdash;although it
  is no concern of mine, you see&mdash;has led me to sacrifice some valuable
  time, and trespass perhaps on yours, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Don't speak of it. I am glad to be of service," Mr. Tucker
  replied, in his regular way. "But did I understand, that you had brought a
  letter to me?"</p>

  <p>"Not a syllable of any kind. I make a point of never insulting anybody.
  And to suppose that a man, of your experience, could fail to know a gentleman
  at first sight, would be most impertinent. And let me remind you," continued
  Mr. Gaston, perceiving that the other looked a little glum at this, "that I
  am not come, upon any business question, where my solvency, and so on, might
  require to be established. My object is simply to perform a kindness; and
  your aid will cost you nothing, neither risk a single penny. I ask you no
  favour; I simply propose it, as a duty to yourself, that you should enable me
  to confer a benefit, upon a most deserving, and ill-treated fellow-Christian.
  Instead of losing anything by it, you will gain very largely. For you will
  thus restore to position, and some wealth, a man of most grateful, and
  generous nature. I have no cant about me, and it is my abhorrence; but it
  would be too much of the opposite extreme, to deny that the hand of a good
  Providence is here."</p>

  <p>"Sir, you speak well, and very sensibly so far;" answered the cautious
  timber-merchant, trying to conquer his unreasonable dislike of the red-faced
  gentleman at first sight; "if you will kindly tell me, what it is that I can
  do, I will do it, unless there should be reason to the contrary, or at any
  rate necessity for consideration."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it does not require half a moment's hesitation; you will say that I
  have made much ado about nothing. All I want to know, is the address of a
  gentleman, for whom you bought a small estate, from fifteen to twenty years
  ago; probably the shorter date is the more correct one&mdash;rather a tall
  man, with a military manner."</p>

  <p>"I am not a land-agent," Mr. Tucker replied; "neither do I meddle with the
  lawyer's business. But at one time, from my knowledge of the county, and
  purchase of timber, and so on, I was frequently asked to obtain a purchaser
  for small outlying properties, perhaps belonging to the gentlemen, who were
  selling me their timber. Of course, the matter afterwards passed through the
  proper hands; and I never thought of making any charge for what I did. Still
  there were so many cases, that without particulars, I cannot pretend to say
  anything."</p>

  <p>"But, you must have known, in almost every case, who the purchaser was,
  what made him buy, where he lived, what he did with himself, &amp;c. Officers
  seldom turn farmers, I believe, and seldom have managed, from their miserable
  pay, to save money to buy land with."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to oblige you, Mr. Gaston, if I can, without any breach of
  confidence. Your inquiry is unusual, as you must know; and unless you can
  manage to be more precise, I see no possibility of helping you. If you can
  supply me with the name, and date, I may have some recollection of the matter
  you refer to. Also it is only fair to ask, how you have heard of me, and my
  share in the business. You can scarcely consider that question rude."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, my dear sir," replied the visitor; "everything is plain,
  and above board here. I only regret, that from my own ignorance, I should
  have to give you so much trouble. But in your desire to do good, you will
  excuse me. The case has some little peculiarities; which, with your
  permission, I will recount. Only, let me ask you first, if you are sure that
  a long tale will not weary you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing will weary me about&mdash;I mean in a case of so much
  interest."</p>

  <p>"How good of you, to feel such interest without any knowledge of the
  people implicated! But alas, Mr. Tucker, I am suffering from thirst. I have
  ridden nearly fifty miles, since noon; now all very pure air, such as that of
  Devon, contains saline particles; and in the distance, I behold a pump. I
  would crave your hospitable leave, to go, and move the handle."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gaston, I humbly beg your pardon," said the ancient gentleman,
  arising with a sigh; "but my mind is not as present to me, as it used to be.
  We have not the name of inhospitality, as a rule, in Devonshire; but I give
  you my honour, sir, that it quite escaped me. And after your ride&mdash;what
  will my sister say? I beg you to come into our little parlour. It is getting
  rather cold out here, and not so comfortable. Perhaps you have never even
  dined? Oh dear!"</p>

  <p>"I shall go to the pump, and that alone, if you say another syllable, my
  dear sir. But if you make a point of it, I will go in. But, nothing to eat,
  sir&mdash;not one morsel. My dinner is a trifle to a man like me; and I have
  made arrangements about it. Anything, anything&mdash;a glass of cold water,
  with a quarter of a knob of sugar, suits me well."</p>

  <p>However, like most men who speak thus, the traveller was better in his
  deed, than word; so that three large tumblers of hot rum and water confessed
  him more capacious than themselves, before he had much to say to them.</p>

  <p>"It is a curious story. You misdoubted me out there," he began, with a
  wave of his glass drumstick towards the garden. "But, Tucker, I have found
  you now, to be a hearty fellow. The heart, after all, is the real driving
  power with good fellows, such as you and I are. Hang it, I don't suppose, one
  man in fifty thousand would have taken up this thing, like me, from pure love
  of the specie."</p>

  <p>"Of the human species," his host amended gently; then, fearful of any
  rudeness, added&mdash;"no doubt you are right, however; the two words are
  much the same, I do believe."</p>

  <p>"To me no matter is of any moment," resumed the red-faced man, with his
  roses deepening into mulberries, "in comparison with the glow of heart,
  produced by a noble action. And when we can benefit ourselves as well, what a
  poor heart it must be, that hesitates! Look at the case, which I have in
  hand. An amiable but eccentric man, a pattern of every virtue, except the
  rare one of common sense, takes a turn against all his family! He fancies
  that they are all set against him, that their views are sordid, and his alone
  are large; that, as he cannot alter them, his best plan is, to have nothing
  to do with them, and keep out of their sight. Also he believes, that a man's
  truest work is, to earn his own living, with his own hands, and wash them
  clean of all the vices of the world. In a word, he has crotchets, about
  society, nature, and things of that sort, to put it clearly. Well, he
  disappears, without rhyme or reason, having lost the only link that retained
  him in society, a charming young wife, who was a beauty of this county. He
  buries himself, in some outlandish region, although he belongs to a
  distinguished family, and has done a good deal to distinguish himself. No
  doubt, he believes that he has acted for the best; that he is fulfilling what
  is called in the cant of the day, "a lofty mission;" that he stood across the
  light of other people's prospects, and was bound in duty to obliterate
  himself; whereas, in reality, he is consulting his own tastes, which are out
  of all reason, and fantastic.</p>

  <p>"Let us say, that his family have long looked upon him as an excellent,
  but misguided fellow; not a black sheep, but a stray sheep, which will have
  its own way; and hoping for his happiness, they make no fuss about him. But
  in the course of years, he becomes more needful; as a snug little property
  falls to him by succession, and his signature is needed, as a matter of
  formality, in a settlement of importance. In such a case, he must abandon for
  a moment his hermitage, receive his dues, and perform his duty. Possibly, he
  may be induced to return altogether to civilized existence. If so, he will be
  welcomed by enthusiastic friends, and his history shall appear, in letters of
  pure gold. On the other hand, if he prefers the seclusion, which must have
  become his second nature now, he may return to it, with his wheels
  greased&mdash;excuse the coarseness of the allusion, my dear sir; what I mean
  is, with more butter for his farmhouse bread. Now, what do you think of my
  proposal?"</p>

  <p>"I do not appear to have quite understood," Mr. Tucker replied, very
  quietly, and slowly, "what proposal there is before me; or even that there is
  any at all. If not a rude question, in my own house, I would venture to ask,
  sir, without offence, whether you are a solicitor?"</p>

  <p>"Come now, my friend, you are a little too hard on me. When I have tried
  to make it clear to you, that I desire to do good!"</p>

  <p>"I am sure I beg your pardon, sir. But so they may sometimes; I do assure
  you, I have known it. But since you are not in the law, I may speak freely.
  And to save you further trouble, I will own right out, that I am pretty sure,
  by this time, of the gentleman you mean. I know of no great mystery in the
  matter; and such things are not at all in my line. He wished to be quiet, and
  undisturbed, as a man might well do in a sad affliction; and as every man has
  a right to do, if he chooses. I felt the same feeling myself, Mr. Gaston, in
  the days when the Lord afflicted me."</p>

  <p>The voice of the old man trembled slightly, for his affliction was
  life-long; and this had helped to draw him towards the man in like distress,
  who had made up his mind, to retire from the world.</p>

  <p>"You too have lamented?" said the red-faced man. "It is the lot of us all,
  my dear sir. But the duty of the strong man is, to up, cast off, and gird
  himself."</p>

  <p>"I will not deny it. But it takes a time to do it, as well as a clear view
  of the world. And for looking at the world, there are quite as many hills, as
  there are men to stand on them. But I am keeping you long from your dinner,
  Mr. Gaston, which I believe you have ordered. You do not expect me to tell
  you, I suppose, all I know about the gentleman you ask of?"</p>

  <p>"If there is anything that I avoid, Tucker," the visitor replied, as he
  compounded for himself a fourth instalment of rum-punch&mdash;"it is the
  barest semblance of a liberty. Your excellent health, my dear friend! I have
  never encountered a more harmonious soul. No, no; I only ask you, for the
  gentleman's address, to do him a genuine, and great kindness."</p>

  <p>"It will give me real pleasure," said the host, who was standing, and
  bowing at the generous carousal in his honour, "to place you in communication
  with him; upon the receipt of his permission. That is a thing for him to
  give; and not for me to take as granted. Shall I write, and inform him of
  your application? Or will you write yourself, Mr. Gaston, and leave it with
  me to be forwarded? You do not know the name, I think you say&mdash;the
  present name of the gentleman. But if you will use the name you know him by,
  I will answer for safe delivery. We may save the post, if you begin at once.
  Here is all you want, including sealing-wax; and I will leave the room while
  you write, if you think proper."</p>

  <p>"Well!" cried the visitor, jumping up, with a force that shook the room,
  and made the glasses rattle, while his face turned white, and its glow flew
  to his eyes; "is that all you mean to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you nothing more," the old man answered, looking at him
  firmly, but with great surprise; "nothing more; until I get permission.
  Surely you would not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I forgot one little thing," the other interrupted, as he thrust his hand
  so violently into a breast-pocket, that the host nearly made up his mind to
  see a pistol; "I forgot that nothing is to be had for nothing. My mind is so
  set upon discovering that man, that if fifty pounds&mdash;well then, a
  hundred pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a thousand, sir; no, nor fifty thousand," Caleb Tucker broke in
  sternly. "You must be a heartless man, whatever you may say about your heart,
  to insult me so. It is lucky for you, that I am not a young man. Leave my
  house. I am not accustomed to entertain such visitors."</p>

  <p>"Over-righteous Caleb," said the red-faced man, recovering his colour, and
  his temper, or enough of it to supply cool insolence; "we have no faith in
  all this noble indignation. You know, my remarkably stingy host, upon which
  side your bread is buttered. And you think to make a good thing, of what you
  have got out of me. Ta, ta, Master Dry-rot! Your very cheap rum has spoiled
  my appetite for dinner. I shall go to your cathedral, and pray to be
  delivered from the company of ancient hypocrites."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X. &mdash; ANGELIC PEEPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the waxing of the moon, there are great things done, upon
  this world of moonshine. Then is the time, to plant the vine, the medlar, and
  the apple-tree, to ring the store-pig, to inaugurate the capon, and rope the
  roguish onion&mdash;crafty contraband of maiden's lips. Then also, is the
  time for loftier, and more subtle enterprise; to tempt, or steal, the shy
  young glance&mdash;the flutter of inquiring eyes, the touch clandestine, the
  irrelevant remark, the sigh about nothing, yet productive of a blush, the
  blush that increases the confusion it betrays&mdash;and a million other
  little ways of wonder, in the wondrous maze of love.</p>

  <p>Even so, and with a multitude of pieces of 16 oz. glass&mdash;so called in
  the trade, but really never more than 14 oz.&mdash;sticking in his wounds,
  with the putty still upon it, Dicky Touchwood came to himself; and lost it,
  ere ever he had time to scratch it; which is the first of all bodily
  instincts. For over him leant the very loveliest creature, ever seen out of a
  dream, or in it. Deep compassion, sweet anxiety, and an inborn dread of the
  coroner, or the doctor who precedes him, filled the beautiful eyes of Rose
  Arthur. The youth looked up, and had a very clear idea of having flown up, to
  what our poets call "the blue."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" the maiden whispered, as his lips began to move; "keep your head
  upon the flower-pot, and try to think of nothing. Never mind, about all the
  things you have broken. You did not mean to do it, and it can't be helped
  now. The only thing you have to do, is to keep as still as possible. Papa is
  gone to meet Dr. Perperaps, and he may be expected, at any moment. You are to
  go to sleep, until he comes."</p>

  <p>The heavily wounded youth, instead of obeying orders, gazed the more. To
  look at her was poetry, and to listen to her was music. But she turned away,
  and left him nothing for his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It must have been an angel. But they have no papas," he began to reason
  with himself aloud; "and they never would have sent for Dr. Perperaps. None
  but the devil could have sent for him. Oh, where can I be? What is the
  meaning of it? And what is this mysterious substance, all around me?"</p>

  <p>"Brewer's grains," the silvery voice replied; "we have it every spring, to
  catch the slugs with; and my father put it down, to keep you cool, and moist.
  It smells very nice; you should be thankful for it."</p>

  <p>"So I am. Oh, I am thankful now to be able to smell any beer at all. But I
  seem to be full of holes, and sore places, and pieces of stuff sticking into
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You could hardly expect, to have no holes yourself, after making such a
  great hole in our glass; but you must not let that dwell at all upon your
  mind. My father is a gentleman, who does his own glazing. And really, if you
  must fall, you have fallen very luckily. Although, when first you look at it,
  it seems almost an enormous hole, for a smallish boy to have made so
  quickly."</p>

  <p>Richard Touchwood, Esquire, jumped up, when he heard himself called "a
  smallish boy." Or rather, he tried to jump up, but his swathings stopped him,
  and then a very jagged barb of pain; and then a light hand replanted him,
  among the grains, and upon the pot.</p>

  <p>"You are too bad," she said; "you want to go everywhere, where you have no
  business. But oh, I am so sorry for your pain, poor boy! If you would only
  cry a little, it would do you so much good."</p>

  <p>"Cry!" exclaimed Dicky, in a high tone of disdain, yet not wholly out of
  concert with the course suggested; "have you never even heard that I am a
  Caius-College man, the place where the very best physicians come from?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never heard of that. I have heard of hospitals, and the wards that
  belong to them; but never of keys colleges. Since you are in training for the
  medical profession, you ought to try more than you do, to enter into your own
  position. It is a strict necessity, for you to lie still; but instead of
  doing that&mdash;Oh, here comes Dr. Perperaps, crossing our bridge very
  nicely indeed! And he has brought his daughter, Spotty, with him. He never
  goes anywhere, without Miss Spotty. Now you will be in better hands than
  mine. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I implore you not to go away. Whoever you are&mdash;and I have hardly
  seen you yet, although I have told you all about myself&mdash;do try to see
  that Dr. Perperaps doesn't kill me."</p>

  <p>"Oh no! He is the most kind-hearted man; and exceedingly clever, for a
  doctor. And when he does happen to make a mistake, his daughter puts it right
  for him. They are very nice people, and so natural."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know him too well? He pulled out my wrong tooth; and how could
  his daughter put it in again? I had a bad knee, and he blistered the other,
  to produce counter-irritation. And once, when a piece of camp-stool ran into
  me&mdash;Oh, I had better hold my tongue! I know his footstep. I'll be
  dead&mdash;to save him trouble."</p>

  <p>"Ah, ha! What have we here? Very sad indeed. Most serious case. Our valued
  young friend&mdash;let us turn him over. A spirited youth&mdash;too spirited,
  in fact. Our great universities produce a kind of comatosis. They overtax
  corporeal, and relax the mental energies. The result of such a system is
  before us now."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perperaps, as he came to this conclusion, turned to his daughter, who
  was standing in the doorway; and she said, "Yes. But he has tumbled through
  the glass."</p>

  <p>"That is a minor, but a logical result, of the vicious system I describe.
  The physical powers have been overdone. The judgment was dormant; or he would
  not have tried the leap. Now both pay the penalty of disproportion. He does
  not know me, the truest friend he ever had. It is a beautiful instance of our
  interdependence."</p>

  <p>"Here are the bandages," his daughter said concisely; "and here is cold
  water. We may be glad, Miss Arthur, of a little warm, if convenient."</p>

  <p>"These hasty ways," the doctor whispered to Mr. Arthur, while his daughter
  set to work, "are entirely the result of the Reform Bill. Spotty was a good
  girl, until that passed; and so far as that goes, she is a good girl still.
  But it caused a feminine upheaval, sir; and the wisest man dare not predict
  the issue. She does the preliminaries; she is wonderfully sagacious; and then
  the scientific element steps in. Be careful, my dear; be very careful. Lady
  Touchwood thinks so much of him."</p>

  <p>Spotty, who acted as her father's assistant, and better half in his
  profession, proceeded very strongly, and most skilfully, with her work; while
  the doctor serenely discussed the case. The hapless rat-hunter had fainted in
  earnest, at the very first symptom of medical relief; and this was the best
  thing he could have done. "His wounds were very interesting, and likely to be
  painful; but properly speaking, not really dangerous to a Cambridge man. No
  limbs were broken; although the descent was calculated to produce much
  fracture. And unless inflammatory action supervened, recovery was only a
  question of time, and of skilful, and unremitting curative appliances." Thus
  said the doctor; and such was his report, by a boy upon a pony, to Touchwood
  Park.</p>

  <p>While these things were toward, and theory and practice were kissing one
  another&mdash;as they generally do, when the money goes into the same
  bag&mdash;Rose was seeking, at her father's order, a redoubtable person to
  lend a hand. Captain Larks, with the instinct of a soldier, knew that the
  medical proceedings would terminate in carrying, as they generally do.
  Therefore, he got his hand-barrow ready, and sent for an able-bodied man, to
  share the weight of it. And this was a good workman, when he liked to work,
  Sam Slowbury, of Brent-fuzz corner.</p>

  <p>Slowbury disliked all activity, as heartily as anybody in the parish; and
  could shirk it, as thoroughly as any man. He entered well into the humour of
  the contract, in virtue of which a man gets as much money, on a Saturday
  night, for doing nothing, as for working hard throughout the week, and
  husbands at once his own resources, and prospective value, by prolonging his
  job to the uttermost penny.</p>

  <p>Such was the integrity of this man, and his principles so uncompromising;
  so thoroughly did he respect himself, and dignify his vocation, that whether
  he were out of sight, or whether he were strictly watched, his behaviour was
  the same. In neither case, would he do a stroke of work, except as the
  exception. This conduct ensured him universal regard, and more work, than
  even he could leave undone.</p>

  <p>After large, and sweet experience of the British workman, Mr. Arthur had
  come to the definite conclusion, that these are the men whom it is wisest to
  employ. Because there is no disappointment with them; no qualm of conscience,
  at neglecting to look after them; no loss of time, in absurd endeavours to
  make them do a little work, now and then. There are few greater pleasures,
  than to contemplate repose; especially when honourably purchased by oneself;
  and any employer of Sam Slowbury might always enjoy that pleasure in
  perfection. But Sam, to-day, was comparatively at work, having made up his
  mind to a holiday, and to spend it in the perilous pursuit of the rat. The
  catastrophe of that great expedition left his mind in a gentle,
  head-scratching condition, candidly open to a pint of cider; and here he
  stood now, at one end of the bier.</p>

  <p>"Steady!" said the captain, a needless exhortation to a man of Sam's
  philosophy; then lifting his end of the barrow, upon which the casual visitor
  had been laid, he led them, down the bloom-roofed alleys, to his cheerful
  cottage-door. For the green-house, under the cliff, was nearly two hundred
  yards from his dwelling-place.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir, if I speak amiss," said Dr. Perperaps, when they stopped
  here; "but may I ask you a somewhat important question, round the corner?
  Spotty, attend to the patient. Now, sir, it is this," he continued in a low
  tone, as soon as Mr. Arthur followed him, "we have reason to believe, that
  you value very highly, as every good Englishman has a right to do, your
  privacy, your retirement&mdash;I might say, your charming seclusion from the
  world. Now, this boy's mother, Lady Touchwood, is&mdash;ah well&mdash;you
  understand me."</p>

  <p>"I have merely heard her name; I know nothing more about her. What is she,
  for me to be afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, my dear sir; you misunderstand me. Her ladyship is a
  delightful person, until&mdash;until her feelings overpower her. Charitable,
  kind-hearted, hospitable, devout, elegant in her manners, and fond of making
  presents&mdash;a very fine quality growing rarer every year,&mdash;still, she
  does want to get to the bottom of everything; doubtless from intensity of
  sympathy. And if anybody baffles her, she becomes the very devil. Pardon me,
  Captain Larks, I speak in strictest confidence; but I have reason to believe,
  that her ladyship's attention has been directed, with some interest, to you.
  If once she gets admission to your little household (which you cannot well
  deny her, if you take in her son), as soon as her alarm about him is over,
  she will begin to feel an undesirable interest, in everything concerning
  you."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Perperaps," answered Mr. Arthur, "it is most obliging of you to show
  such consideration for my wishes."</p>

  <p>The doctor, a short, well rounded man, came one step nearer, and behind
  the silver head of the black bamboo, which he always carried, relaxed his
  dignity with a wink.</p>

  <p>"It is not altogether that," he said; "I consider my own convenience also.
  I am not so young as I was; and I don't want to walk up your hill, twice a
  day. And distance is a professional element. Touchwood Park is three times as
  far off; and a carriage would be sent for me. The patient may very well be
  taken, as he is, to my little residence, and go home, upon springs, in a day
  or two. His affectionate mother would send for me, twice every day; and with
  prophylactic, as well as remedial measures&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you; but it will not do. The boy has been wounded on
  my premises; and with me he shall stay, until his relatives remove him. I
  should feel that I had done an inhuman thing, if I sent him from my door, in
  his present condition. Say no more about it, sir; but come in, and help
  us."</p>

  <p>The doctor gave in, as he could not help doing, but said to himself, that
  he should have his revenge; for he knew a little more of Lady Touchwood, than
  Captain Larks could dream of. And he saw a good chance of some pleasant
  excitement, and matters of deep interest to be told to his good wife, when
  Spotty, and the little ones, were gone to bed, and the toddy was being
  measured in the Apostle's spoon. Like nearly all medical men in country
  places, he had a hard time of it; being at everybody's beck, and call; and
  called for almost everything, except to take his money.</p>

  <p>And so, when evening came down upon the hills, and the hills tried to pass
  it off in shadow to the valleys, there was no more comfortable fellow to be
  found, within the enclosure of their deepening folds, than little Dicky
  Touchwood at Larks' cot. By the strong arms of Spotty, and the nimble hands
  of Rose, a bed was provided for him, in the captain's sitting-room&mdash;a
  pretty little place, with a door opening into the span-roof vinery. Here lay
  the youth, upon the best bed of the cottage; with three bottles of mixture,
  tied over at the top with white, like sisters of mercy, and a basin of soup
  keeping warm, upon one of Mr. Arthur's devices for slaying green-fly; and
  best of all cordials&mdash;in his present state of heart&mdash;bright
  glimpses of the lovely Rose, that flitted to and fro.</p>

  <p>He would have known better, than to let his mind wander, about pretty
  figures, and after sweet faces, and into, and out, of a thousand vagaries of
  smile, and of sigh, and of tremulous delight, if the glass of the green-house
  had begun to hurt him yet, or the putty to torment him, as they meant to do
  to-morrow. For the present, he was grateful for every single hole made in him
  (so long as lard, and liniment, prevented it from smarting) as a trifle of
  punctuation, needful before the great impression of his life was struck.</p>

  <p>"Now, Master Touchwood, how often must I tell you," said Spotty, who was
  left, to help as nurse, "that you are not to roll, like that? It loosens all
  the fastenings, and it will set up inflammation."</p>

  <p>"I don't care two skips of a&mdash;flower, if it does. I must see my
  angel; and I can't see through the bed-post."</p>

  <p>"I tell you once more, there is no angel here. The old women call me a
  ministering angel, when the parish allows them a noggin of gin. But I know
  well enough, that I am not angelic."</p>

  <p>"As if I meant you!" the patient answered, with more sincerity than
  courtesy. "You are very kind indeed, and you rub up the rags, like silver
  paper, and you make them soft. But the other&mdash;oh, Miss Perperaps, what a
  perfect, perfect angel!"</p>

  <p>"It is time for you to have this draught. Your tongue is white. That comes
  of talking about angels so. To make a face is useless. You must have it. I
  dare say it is nasty. Shall the angel come, and give it you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Please not to let her see me take it. I always make such horrid
  faces. And I want her to think, how nice I am. If I could only get it down,
  while she is round the corner."</p>

  <p>"Wait, till I shake the bottom up. The best of the flavour is always
  there. Now take it, like a man; and I will let her know, how brave you
  were."</p>

  <p>"But Spotty&mdash;or at least I mean, Miss Perperaps, do you think it will
  really make any difference with her? Are you sure that she will have a high
  opinion of me&mdash;if&mdash;if I do it?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain that she will. She sighed, and she said 'Poor fellow!' twice
  over, when she saw the bottles come. If you wish to be a hero, put your head
  the proper way, and open your mouth, and shut both eyes."</p>

  <p>So absorbing was the power of love at first sight, that Dicky took his
  medicine like a martyr, and even pretended that he found it nice.</p>

  <p>"Here is your reward! I will tell her of your goodness; how pleased she
  will be!" exclaimed his nurse; "because she knows so well, what a job it is
  to make you. She will hardly believe her own ears."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you. How can she know about it, when she never set
  eyes on me, before to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean the angel," answered Spotty, with a laugh; "or at least, I
  mean your proper one&mdash;your dear mamma. Here comes Lady Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, bother!" cried the young squire; "don't let her in. Say, that you've
  got orders&mdash;say, that it will kill me&mdash;say anything you
  like&mdash;say they're laying me out."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Master Dicky, you ungrateful wretch! If I only had a mother, to make
  a fuss about me! Would I ever shut her out, that I might carry on with
  angels?"</p>

  <p>Poor Spotty was the daughter of a departed Mrs. Perperaps; and her
  stepmother (having many interesting babes, of far greater value than
  Sporetta) employed that young lady, for the best part of her time, in the
  genial occupations of the nursery, and wash-house. This damsel, being gifted
  with a great love of the healing art, was now beginning to revolt at large,
  from the drudgery of pail, and pan; and her father, who was not a fool
  (although he used the jargon of that race), perceived, in this daughter, a
  revival of the fine enthusiasm, which had pulled him down. In the fervour of
  youth, he had nourished gay ideas of making great discoveries, and doing lots
  of good; and happily he did no harm, except unto himself. Among his lucid
  theories, was a grand one about spores, as the protoplasm, or proto-phantasm,
  of all sporadic existence. And his child appearing, on the same day as his
  book, in spite of her mother, he would have her name&mdash;"Sporetta." Her
  name lasted longer than the book, because it appealed to a larger audience,
  and nobody could make out what it meant. But soon even this sweet association
  vanished; for Sporetta took the chicken-pox, before her skin was hardened;
  and no hundred-headed Stentor, with a high-pressure boiler, and three
  steam-whistles in his every mouth, nay, nor even the foremost statesman of
  the age, might ever have stormed people's eyes, through their ears, to
  believe that the child was not spotty. Her name had begun to be "Spotterer"
  already; and now as the polystigmatic view deepened, her name accrusted
  finally to the positive form of "Spotty."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI. &mdash; MOTHER DEAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When two persons, as widely asunder in nature, as she ever
  lets us be, having long held imaginary notion of each other, for the first
  time come together in the bodily form, under stress of circumstance, what
  becomes of all they meant to do? Some men have had the happiness to see two
  dogs, who have been chained up, for some months of moonlight, within barking
  distance of each other, and having higher gifts than we possess, have
  appraised one another without interview, according as the wind blew to or
  fro&mdash;to behold these twain dogs meet upon the highway, at length and at
  last, for the very first time, on a day when there is wind enough to blow
  their tails off. Either dog has made his mind up, as to how he will behave;
  each knows every corner of his adversary's mouth, and which of his teeth has
  been broken by a bone; he has learned every item of his brother barker's
  story (from his howls to the man in the moon, to come and help him), and
  sitting on his haunches, he has fifty times rehearsed his proceedings with
  that noisy dog, when he shall come across him. Yet now, when the blissful
  opportunity is come, when the other dog is looking at him, smaller than his
  bark was, and easier to thrash than he ever has imagined him, does he fall
  upon, and rend him? No, not he; tails wag across the gale, with growing
  cordiality; sniffs try to baffle facts; good will is mutual; the weather is
  too bad, for any dog to say a word upon any other subject. In half a minute,
  they have managed to smell up a fundamental friendship; and henceforth, if
  they bark of nights, it will not be at, but with, each other.</p>

  <p>Now Lady Touchwood, and Captain Larks, acted very differently from this.
  Their manner was as full of common sense, and of waiting for a leading
  question from each other, as Cæsar's, and Lion's, may be at first sight; but
  they failed of the insight, which man, (the only animal capable of envy),
  decries as instinct.</p>

  <p>"I suppose this is the house of Captain Larks," said the lady in the
  little porch, looking at the owner, who had got his bridge down, and his door
  wide open. "Dr. Perperaps is with me. I am come to see my son, who has met
  with a very sad accident, I fear. Perhaps you are Captain Larks himself."</p>

  <p>"I believe that I have the honour to bear that name," Mr. Arthur replied,
  with a very stiff bow; "at least in this part of the country. The boy is in
  no danger; but severely cut, and shaken."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will not refuse me liberty to see him. Perhaps in such a
  question, the very best judge is his mother." Lady Touchwood spoke sharply,
  and with what she took for irony.</p>

  <p>"There is not any question in the case, that I am aware of. And there can
  be no question, as to your right to see him. Be careful, if you please; there
  is an awkward step here. Rose, my darling, Lady Touchwood will follow you.
  Hold your candle higher, that's a dear little child. My daughter, Lady
  Touchwood! Allow me to introduce her."</p>

  <p>"Well!" communed the visitor, with her own heart only; "things must be
  come to a very pretty pass, when a man, who has run away from justice, and
  lives by selling pears, and apples, introduces his daughter to me, and orders
  me to follow her! And Mr. Short upbraids me with my quick temper! If he could
  see me now&mdash;But never mind; they shall know my opinion of them, when
  Dicky can be moved."</p>

  <p>In a very few minutes, however, Lady Touchwood began to waver largely, in
  her opinion of them; even as the tail of the inimical dog&mdash;whose
  "emotional condition" has been analysed above&mdash;unconsciously relaxes,
  from the wiry cock of defiance, first to the crisp bend of inquiry, then to
  the pleasing wave, of interest and sympathy, and lastly to the woolly wag, of
  amity, and brotherhood. So pervading is the tendency towards good will, in
  the breast of all genuine mammalia.</p>

  <p>There could be no doubt, that much trouble had been taken, for the comfort
  and welfare of the adventurous rat-hunter: the motherly perception took this
  in, at a glance; and the deep sleep of the wounded one (which he suddenly
  accomplished) appealed to the tenderest, and most sacred feelings of
  maternity.</p>

  <p>"Poor darling!" the mother whispered, having kissed his marble forehead;
  "how beautifully regular his breathing is! He always had that gift, whatever
  happened to him. Can I ever show my gratitude to heaven, Miss Larks, for the
  providential fact, that his features are uninjured? His features have been
  declared, by the first sculptor of the age, to be of the very purest
  classical ideal. Whether he said Doric, or Ionic, or perhaps Gothic, I will
  not be certain, at this exciting period."</p>

  <p>"We made sure at first, that his nose was cut in two," replied Spotty
  Perperaps, who had done the lion's share, and would not be put in the
  background, like that; "but it turned out to be a stripe of red lead, my
  lady; and when I sponged it off, I found his dear nose all right."</p>

  <p>"His dear nose, indeed! Who is this young female? Oh, the doctor's
  daughter, Spotty! Yes, I heard that you were here."</p>

  <p>"And a good job for Master Dicky, that I came up with father," said the
  spirited Miss Perperaps, in a tone of self-assertion; "such little things as
  this always come into my compass."</p>

  <p>The sturdy manner, and rather rough appearance of the damsel&mdash;too
  important as she was, to be affronted just now&mdash;brought into sweet
  contrast the gentle demeanour, and sympathising glances of the other young
  lady; who kept herself in the background, and then retired into the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Poor darling! Precious sufferer! I will disturb him no longer," Lady
  Touchwood whispered gently, as she tucked her Dicky's ears up. "Though it
  would have been such a rapture, to hear him even breathe my name. But heaven,
  in its wisdom, has sent this balmy slumber. Come forward, my dear; you are a
  very nice young lady. Miss Larks, I am pleased with you. Your behaviour is
  most becoming. You have never said a word, since I came in; though you
  cordially feel for me, in this sad affliction. Of course you are not a nurse,
  or anything of that kind. Miss Perperaps, who is so clever, and accustomed to
  it, will be quite indefatigable, I am sure, and will find me full of
  gratitude. But you, my dear, may also be of very great assistance to us; and
  I am certain, from your lovely eyes, that you are kind, and gentle."</p>

  <p>Rose Arthur, being very shy with strangers, and reluctant always to be
  made conspicuous, came forward, just as far as manners, and her sense of
  obedience prescribed. There, the light of two candles (a gallant dip, and a
  lordly tallow-mould) combined to play upon her blushing cheeks, white
  forehead, and softly sparkling eyes. And strange to say, another pair of eyes
  (supposed to be buried in deep repose) contrived to unclose themselves, and
  steal a narrow glance, through glimmering lashes, as children "draw straws"
  from the fire.</p>

  <p>"If I can be of any use," said Rose, "in any way whatever&mdash;I mean of
  course for messages, or outdoor work"&mdash;she qualified her offer, because
  she met the patient's eager gaze at her&mdash;"any little things, to save
  Miss Perperaps from&mdash;from coming away too much; I shall be very glad to
  be of use, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"I thought that I heard a heavy sigh,"&mdash;Lady Touchwood turned, as she
  spoke;&mdash;"surely our precious sufferer&mdash;Dicky, dear, are you
  conscious of my presence, and pining for me?"</p>

  <p>A snore of the highest artistic order, superior to nature's sweetest
  effort, conveyed, to the mother's yearning heart, a solace at the same time,
  and yet a disappointment.</p>

  <p>"I will suppress my very natural desire," she whispered to Rose, while
  Spotty turned away, and indulged in a broad grin, out of the window; "my fond
  wish to hear, if it were but a single syllable, from those dear lips. It is
  wrong, and selfish of me. How thankful should I be, for the balmy depth of
  this repose! That is how he always sleeps, Miss Larks, ever since he fell and
  indented his ligaments, the day he was put into small clothes. I never quite
  understood what the process was; the result, however, has been remarkable. On
  no account let him be disturbed to-night, by so much as the mention of my
  name. He will not awake, for ten hours now. I know all his ways, so
  thoroughly. Sleep on, darling, and the angels be with you."</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve to have such a ma," said Spotty, running up to her
  patient, as soon as his mother was out of ear-shot; "not to give her a kiss,
  or so much as a word!"</p>

  <p>"It is all very fine for you to talk," the youth replied, to soothe his
  conscience, by strong statement of his case; "you don't know anything at all
  about it. Do you suppose, that I could put up, with being cried over, and
  kissed, and cuddled, and called all sorts of nursery names, in the sight and
  hearing of&mdash;I mean while she&mdash;while other persons at least, who
  cannot be expected to know my proper age&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! I see. To be sure!" exclaimed Miss Perperaps; "you want to be
  taken for a man, before your time. You seem to have conceived an
  extraordinary affection, for somebody, instead of your mother. Lady Touchwood
  is talking with Captain Larks; now it will make her more happy, if I tell her
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"If you do, I will tear every bandage off, and my death will lie at your
  door, Spotty. I have got an old watch, that I had at school; it is out of
  fashion now, but it goes very well; and I'll give it to you, if you only do
  your duty to me. People run you down, I know; but in my opinion, you are
  wonderfully clever."</p>

  <p>"No, Master Dicky, I am not at all that. But I see a great many stupid
  things done by people, who ought to know better. Marrying again, for
  instance, and having other children; what do you think of that, Mr.
  Touchwood?"</p>

  <p>"A man when he marries," said Dicky with solemnity, and hoping that
  somebody might be listening in the passage, "swears upon the Bible, to have
  only one wife, to cleave to her, to stick to her, to love, honour, and obey
  her. How can he do that, I should like to know, if he goes, and gets married
  to another woman? Besides, we are told, and I have to attend Divinity
  lectures, I assure you, that no man can be blameless, except he be the
  husband of one wife. And that is how I intend to conduct myself."</p>

  <p>"How I wish that my pa," said Miss Perperaps, with a sigh, "had attended
  Divinity lectures. But hush, Master Dicky, I can hear my lady going, and my
  dear papa is doing Dixon to her; you know what that means in our practice, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never heard of it. They don't show us things at Cambridge. Oh,
  Spotty, I do like you so, because you don't care!"</p>

  <p>"But I do care. And that makes me see how things are. A Dixon is a
  swing-cask, a sort of water-barrow, a tub upon pins between two wheels, for
  going down the walks with. They have got one, in your father's place. They
  are all very well, while they stand at the pump, because there is a shore to
  them. But if you want to make them go, you have to be very careful. If you
  put too much in them, they kick up one way; and if you put too little, they
  kick up the other, and your trouble goes for nothing."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that well enough," answered Dicky, whose mind was by no
  means of electric speed; "but what has it got to do, with the doctor, and my
  mother?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," said Spotty, with a look of some contempt; "if my father
  were to make too much of your injuries, he would terrify your mother, and she
  would fetch a man from Exeter. So the tub would go over, from having too much
  in it. But if he made too little of your mishap, why then it would be almost
  worse, for the tub would go over the other way, because of being empty."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would talk plain English, Spotty. All your stuff comes in
  bottles. What have tubs got to do with it? But perhaps you make enough to
  last the twelvemonth, at one brewing. I can see what you mean, about another
  man coming; but I don't see what harm could come of making little of it."</p>

  <p>"Very well, if you can't see, you are not worth telling. I would not have
  told you what I have, only for the way in which they trampled upon me. My
  dear pa is gone to see my lady to her carriage, that wouldn't come up the
  hill, because it is so rocky. Ah, I do admire Captain Larks, for living where
  people must alight from their chariots, to get at him."</p>

  <p>"Spotty, you are a radical. I used to be one, when I was very young, and
  could not see the mischief of it. Wise people must be made to leave it off.
  But politics always make me sleepy. Go, and see whether my mother is clean
  gone, and whether your father means to plague me any more. It shall never be
  said of me, that I made a fuss about a trifle. I dare say you would like to
  hear me groan. Girls always do; because then they can boast about having
  their teeth out, and all that, better than we men do. But I am as game, as a
  three-legged rat."</p>

  <p>"Just you wait a bit, before you boast," Miss Perperaps answered, as she
  went to fetch her father; "your troubles are not begun yet, Master Dicky; the
  wound in your tibia has got some bull's-eye glass in it, and what is worse to
  my mind, green scum of rotten whiting. If you don't begin to squeak
  to-morrow, for certain you will, on Sunday."</p>

  <p class="first">"The idea is a good one. Sometimes there is a dove-tail to
  be made, of cross purposes, when laid aright." Mr. Short said this, to his
  well-beloved <i>Nous,</i> as they sat down together, to consider their
  breakfast and the business of the day, on a very nice Monday morning. Monday
  morning is the sweetest of the week, not only for parsons, but for dogs as
  well; for they both have passed through tribulation yesterday, and are all
  the better for it; and best of all, have six days before them, ere the trial
  comes again.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, it would be too wide a statement, to aver that a parson is bound
  officially to feel a depression of his bright, elastic, and naturally large
  mind, and to get up at a low level, upon a Sunday morning. He means to preach
  admirably, and he does it (often with some drain upon his own resources); he
  has many sound ideas, which he wants to watch, in their movement into wakeful
  minds; and perhaps the very last of his desires is, to let anybody else come,
  and do it better for him. Still he is glad, and it is a proof of his humility
  to be so, when he has done his duty.</p>

  <p>His dog, on the other hand, if tenderly attached to him&mdash;as a
  parson's dog is sure to be&mdash;rejoices with a treble bark, when the trying
  day is over. In the present "distracted condition of the church," he is not
  allowed to go there, though his clerical ancestors may have made a point of
  it. Sitting on the bricks, outside his kennel, he hears the fine call of the
  bells, and he smells the swing of the man, and the boy, who are ringing,
  because they both work in the vicarage garden. Then he sees a lot of people
  in the foot-path meadow (where a hare has a seat, to his certain knowledge,
  and a wedded pair of partridges come almost every evening) gingerly walking,
  with their best clothes on, and trying not to make too much noise, because
  they are getting near the churchyard. They have got a dog with them; and his
  jealousy suggests, that a lay dog will be let in, where he is not. He
  quickens in his forelegs, and gives a distant "wuff" at him, with a shake of
  his ears, and a toss of his nose, and a hope that he may know how to behave
  himself.</p>

  <p>Then comes his final misery, the last straw that breaks his back. He has
  seen the two girls go, with their Sunday stripes, and flarings on, and their
  yellow cotton gloves, too fine for him to sniff at; also the boy who sweeps
  him up is gone&mdash;which was a pang to him, greater than that of
  petticoats&mdash;but when his master comes out the back way, locks the door,
  and hides the key in a clump of violets, and then with his sermon in the
  Spanish leather-case, scarcely vouchsafes him a one-handed pat, with a long
  reach, and a sidelong passage (because of his best black kersey), and is gone
  round the corner, with a flutter of his tails, too full of eloquence to talk
  to a dog&mdash;then he puts down his tail in the hole, he scratched
  advisedly, sits down, to keep down with it, and humbles all his arrogance,
  and the best-plumed portions of his very noble frame, by revolving on his
  haunches, with his nose up high supinely, and his heart appealing to his
  lungs, to come up with it in an unexampled howl.</p>

  <p><i>Nous,</i> having passed through all this anguish yesterday, as usual,
  was now in the highest of high spirits, this fine Monday morning. He had
  heard his master order the horse <i>Trumpeter</i> to be thoroughly well-fed,
  and ready for a long ride, at half-past nine o'clock; and <i>Nous</i> had
  ascertained, without putting one objectionable question, that he was to go
  too. He had been to the stable, and the kitchen, and the larder, and several
  other places too; and all of these, with one accord, announced that
  <i>Nous</i> was going. If there had been any doubt about it, even at the
  pessimistest moment, the quantity of really fine victuals set before him was
  enough to convince him most delightfully. "Lay you in a broad, and good
  foundation for the day, my friend," said his master to him; and it would have
  been surplusage to repeat the order.</p>

  <p>But apart from the question of nourishment, however urgent and agreeable,
  this dog deserves, and in his own right demands, consideration. He was not
  one of those gigantic fellows, who are patronized with some tender alarm
  concerning the issue, if they take it amiss; neither was he one of those
  little whipper-snappers, whom it is not worth while to propitiate. The first
  question asked about a dog, by a man, is almost sure to be an invidious, and
  rude one, and mainly ungrammatical&mdash;"What breed is he?"</p>

  <p>When John Sage of Christowell, who was famous for shedding his own light
  on things, was told that a nobleman (too well known in that neighbourhood)
  was of very long descent, he shook his head, and said that he could
  understand it now. "He hath not dooed it, of a zudden then," said John; "he
  hath a' been coomin' down, all that wai." But <i>Nous,</i> though of long
  descent, was not come down like that; and the purity of his lineage shone
  forth in every lineament. A setter of generous birth was he, sable,
  distinguished with spots and gold, such as we men call "black and tan;"
  flued, and feathered, and fringed with gold, so that while drawing on a covey
  up the gale, he resembled sombre night prolonged in pencils of Aurora. This
  may seem a rose-coloured picture of the dog, to those who have not the
  delight of looking at him, which really prevented some sportsmanlike artists
  from hitting the partridges, when they got up. Still even now, in his
  homelier moments, while begging for bacon, or chewing the rind (which seems
  to puzzle dogs' teeth, more than tougher substance does), he deserved to be
  regarded, with eyes as attentive as his own, than which no more can well be
  said. For nothing was small enough to escape his eyes, or large enough to
  out-gauge them; but in his broad, calm pupils, all might be discovered, as in
  a lens, reposing, for him to think about. The clear depth of the rich brown
  iris spoke of contemplation, placid, and too profound for doubt, and a
  sensitive yearning to be praised, and patted. The loveliest lady in the land
  has not such eloquent, lucid, loving eyes; and even if she had, they would be
  as nothing, without the tan spot over them. Neither might any lady vie with
  him, for accuracy, length, and velvet texture, and delicately saline humidity
  of nose.</p>

  <p>"<i>Nous</i>," said his master, whose thoughts were quick enough for one
  of our race, but very slow against a dog's, "things have turned out very
  pleasantly for us. If I had been obliged to go on Saturday, I should have
  doubted about taking you, because I must have meditated over my sermon, and
  you are a distracting animal. If you come across grouse on the hills, or even
  a snipe, or a plover, you insist upon working the question out, without any
  regard for their connubial state. But now upon a Monday, I am as free as you
  are. You shall enjoy yourself; and so will I."</p>

  <p>For the vehement lady herself had called, upon her return from the "scene
  of probation"&mdash;meaning Mr. Arthur's cottage&mdash;and begged the good
  vicar to put off his trip; for she could not think twice about the wilful
  Julia, while her dear obedient boy lay on a bed of suffering, through his
  self-sacrificing heroism. Oh, if it only had been Julia, she said, it would
  have been so much nicer then, to recognize the hand of Providence! Mr. Short
  smiled dryly, and revolved in his mind some rumour that had reached him,
  concerning bottled beer. But he gladly put off his long ride, till the
  Monday, and paid a short visit, on Saturday, to the interesting Dicky, who
  was now shedding salt tears into water-gruel, and gazing at three bottles,
  hatted with pill-boxes, and booted to the knees with slimy sediment. Spotty
  stood before him, and he knew that words were vain, and the deepest sigh
  would be no more than a signal for a gargle.</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. Short loved both his horse, and his dog; and to see them thus
  full of the joy of the outbreak, from stable and kennel, and the glory of the
  air, and the hope of adventure, and distinction, and renown, was sure to set
  his own spirit capering with theirs, and the dark soul of man flitting into
  sunny places, and even the mind soaring into the air, out of which it was
  taken, and to which it shall return. The air was more delightful than the
  mind to-day; and to ride was far better than to reason.</p>

  <p>"Halloa, <i>Nous,</i> you should have done your pranks by this time," the
  master shouted to him, as the dog stood still, suddenly, amazedly, and with a
  headlong point; as a young dog, rashly scouring, does too late, when he is
  almost on the tails of game; "an old stager, like you, should know better
  than that. No birds can be here; yet you never stand a lark. A hare on her
  form, no doubt of it. Down wind on a hare, with his nose upon her back.
  <i>Nous</i> would stay there all day; I must go up, and see."</p>

  <p>It is a fine, and ardent sight, to see a noble dog, ranging as freely as
  the wind, check his long stride, stand still, and stiffen, with his fore feet
  planted upon the advance, his arched loins straightened into a hard strung
  line, his head (that was tossing on high just now) levelled, and rigid as an
  anvil's nose; his upper lip quivering, despite his iron will, and the fixed
  eyes labouring to learn from their own whites, whether the master is hurrying
  up to shoot. Meanwhile the hare&mdash;for a bird very seldom abides to be
  considered so intently&mdash;crouches into the closest compass, with every
  sinew on the spring, yet still; and suppressing every ruffle of her gingery
  fluff, lowers the lids of her soft bright eyes, for fear of a sparkle through
  the russet of her flax; while she watches every hair's breadth of her enemy,
  and hopes that nobody has seen her.</p>

  <p>Expecting to rejoice in this well-known sight, and the blissful bound of
  the unchased hare, when the dog lies down, and never stirs an inch, but
  bedews the ground from the fountain of his mouth, the vicar turned
  <i>Trumpeter's</i> head, and rode up, to release the good dog from his
  statuary state. "Toho, <i>Nous!</i>" he said, just to keep up the tradition;
  though the dog was too wise to want admonition. But to his surprise, a great
  change came over the spirit of the animal, and his body also, ere ever the
  horse's hoofs were nigh. The first sign of weakness was a flutter of the
  tail, a delicate tremor of the golden brush, in which an artistic dog
  concludes. Then the firm line of the back relaxed, the curved ears fell, and
  the countenance looked foolish; and after a feeble sniff, or two, the whole
  dog set off helter skelter, down the dingle, at whose head he had been
  standing, like a statue. There was no hare before him; neither anything
  moving, in the long desolation, except himself.</p>

  <p>"Now, this is to my mind a horrible puzzle," the vicar exclaimed, as he
  pulled up at the spot, where the false point had so long held good;
  "<i>Nous</i> never chases fur, or feather; and if he did, there is none to be
  chased. He has made a thorough fool of himself for once. But no, I beg his
  pardon. There has been some scamp here, and he has killed a sheep, I see!
  Come back, come back, my darling, or you will get a knife stuck into
  you."</p>

  <p>In an agony of dread, for he loved his dog most dearly, and the rocky dell
  forbade all hope of riding to his succour, he put his nails between his lips,
  and gave a long shrill whistle; and the dog's obedience saved his life. In
  the distance, down at the end of the combe, a pale blue mist overhung a
  morass, in which a little stream lost itself. <i>Nous,</i> in full gallop
  down the grass-track, stopped short at the whistle, with a big stone just
  beside him, and a heavy charge of duck-shot scattered peat, and moss, around
  him. But the big stone had sheltered him, and not a hair was hurt of him,
  while the roar of the gun rang up the hollow, and the smoke of strong powder
  spread a dirty blur before the clean blue mist. From the mixture of vapours,
  a figure with a long gun strode forth rapidly, to bag poor <i>Nous;</i> but
  he, with his innocent tail between his legs, and a deep (but brief) sympathy
  for creatures that are shot at, was swallowing the hard ground, best foot
  foremost, by the way that he came, and thanking his stars to be rid of a
  rogue, and to see his good master.</p>

  <p>If ever, in the history of the church, any parson has been unfitted by his
  own "emotions"&mdash;which is now become the proper English name of wrath,
  shame, desire, revenge, and other good and bad feelings&mdash;for delivering
  with emphasis one short, and strong commandment, and thoroughly fitted for
  the breach of that same, that man was now Vicar of Christowell. Saddened, and
  cowed by the narrow escape, which had shaken his faith in humanity (because
  he understood a gun so well, and took such pleasure in its proceedings, when
  it shot at the proper animals), <i>Nous</i> lay down, before
  <i>Trumpeter's</i> feet, and panted, and looked very piteously up; for his
  self-esteem held two deep wounds, of the false point, and of being fired
  at.</p>

  <p>Having been at Winchester, and New College (seats of the Muses, where they
  are so much at home, that their language is not always foreign), Parson Short
  used a short word; who shall heed what it was, if it bettered his
  philanthropy? Then he jumped from his horse, and bent over the dog, in quick
  fear of finding some big shot-hole; so sad were his favourite's attitude, and
  gaze.</p>

  <p>Like every other creature, this dog most heartily loathed examination, and
  strove to escape it, by offering paws, and by putting up his nose, as no
  candidate can do.</p>

  <p>"You old humbug, you are not hurt a bit. All that you want is, to be made
  much of; because you have made such a fool of yourself. Hi,
  find!&mdash;fetch&mdash;drop! Now you are yourself again. Let us see, what
  there has been here, to make such a mighty fuss about."</p>

  <p><i>Nous,</i> having flipped in, and out of, the heather, after his
  master's glove, and brought it, with the greater agility of the canine mind,
  had recovered his balance, and was equal to his duties. With his valuable
  nose, he described exactly the outline of the form, which he had taken for a
  hare's, and dwelled more especially upon those spots, which retained the
  warmest impression of the shape we so admire. "He had no more than two
  legs,"&mdash;<i>Nous</i> pronounced as he smelled him out&mdash;"and two
  things here, that you call arms; and he lay upon his back, and he had no
  tail. And my opinion of him is, that he was very dirty."</p>

  <p>"Never mind; it is no use to think any more about it," Mr. Short replied,
  as his manner was, to his dog's observations; "there is no getting near the
  fellow, be he who he may. And since he has not hit you, my good <i>Nous,</i>
  I have chiefly to regret, that the arch-enemy was so sharp, as to take
  advantage of my anxiety about you."</p>

  <p>Thus, in a comparatively thankful mood, these two went upon their way
  together; for the nature of the ground forbade all hope of pursuing the
  hang-dog skulker. But Mr. Short felt that his spirits were dashed, and docked
  of their bright April flow, by such a nasty outrage, within five miles of his
  own warm, and hospitable roof. His character was well known, and valued, all
  over the eastern side of the moor, among the few people, who dwelled, or
  wandered there. Not a whit less known was the character of <i>Nous,</i>
  wherever there was any heart capable of valuing integrity, docility,
  gallantry, and faith. No moorman would ever dream "of letting off his
  gun"&mdash;as they always express it&mdash;at Parson Short's <i>Nous;</i>
  even if he had a gun, which was not a common thing with them.</p>

  <p>It must be some fellow, of the outlaw sort, was the only conclusion Mr.
  Short could form&mdash;such as came harbouring, and harassing most
  grievously, treading the loose foot-prints of the Gubbins' family, striking
  every traveller with terror, and dismaying all quiet people, round the verges
  of the waste. The great Castle-prison, in which all the sadness of the long
  moor culminates, was empty at this time, and faced the
  sunshine&mdash;whenever there was any&mdash;with peaceful moss. Neither
  warrior, nor felon, could have crept from out its gloom, to crouch in the bog
  by day, and prowl among the sheep at night.</p>

  <p>However, Mr. Short, possessing that invaluable gift, a sweet and happy
  mind, rode on; and a league, or two, of moorland breeze, in trackless space,
  where distant tors are the traveller's direction-posts, began to make him
  feel, how small, and ludicrous is human wrath. His course lay, as nearly as
  might be, northwest, over some of the highest land of Dartmoor; for his old
  friend's house, which he had not yet seen, stood below the north-western
  parapet of highland, two, or three, miles to the south-west of Okehampton,
  and a little way back from the Tavistock road. Well as he knew his own side
  of the moor, he was taken aback by some pieces of travel, which he met
  between Yes-tor and Cranmere pool; but hitting the West Ockment, near
  Black-tor, he contrived to get down to Okehampton Park.</p>

  <p>On the Tavistock road, which he was truly glad to reach, he saw, as he
  rode up the bank from the river, a young man walking briskly, with a handsome
  setter-pup, about six months old, and of white and lemon colour, with legs,
  and tail, as yet unfringed. The motto of <i>Nous,</i> as of all dogs then,
  was "<i>canis sum, nihil canini,</i>" &amp;c.; and therefore up he ran,
  though his bronzy toes were becoming rather sore, to pass the time of day, to
  this young member of his race. The white and lemon animal saluted him, as was
  decent, and then kindly submitted to further olfaction, lowering his tail, in
  token of communion with his elder, with a dog of dignity, and established
  position in the world. <i>Nous</i> was naturally pleased with this, although
  it is the duty which all pups render&mdash;if they desire to grow on into
  tax-payers&mdash;and he pleasantly allowed the adolescent dog to skip, and
  vault around him; while he wagged his own tail slightly, and sniffed, with a
  critical air, at the salutation offered. Then the dog of experience warned
  the pup, that he had said his say, and been accepted with indulgence, and
  must consider this interview closed, unless he were prepared to have tooth,
  instead of tongue. <i>Nous</i> was very seldom crusty; but to be shot at, and
  to jog along for hours, without seeing game, and to get raw toes, tries even
  a dog's philosophy.</p>

  <p>"I take leave to apologize, for my dog's growls," said Mr. Short, riding
  up with <i>Trumpeter,</i> who shook his legs out, as he felt them on a tidy
  road once more; "but he will not hurt your young dog, sir."</p>

  <p>"Thank you; I am not afraid of that," replied the other; "I was only
  looking at your dog, because I like them; and he seems a very fine one."</p>

  <p>"He is a very fine one, and not to be matched, I believe, in the four
  counties. But will you kindly tell me, where Colonel Westcombe lives? It must
  be somewhere about here."</p>

  <p>"Not more than a mile; and I am going straight home. You have ridden far
  to-day, sir, and come across the moor. My father has long been hoping to see
  an old friend&mdash;Mr. Short, of Christowell."</p>

  <p>"I am the man; and you are young Jack Westcombe; or at least you ought to
  be, because there is no other." The vicar was so pleased to see his old
  friend's son, and to find him to his liking, that he shaped his sentence
  anyhow, got off his horse, and took him by both hands, and examined him, as
  carefully as if he were a nag, whose price he meant to have £5 off.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he meant him well, and was not trying to abate him, Jack
  Westcombe looked him in the face, with a shy, but pleasant expression, and a
  twinkle of goodwill.</p>

  <p>Then the vicar said, "Yes, you are the image of your father; only taller,
  and slighter, and your nose is straighter; and you look as if you stood upon
  your own rights more. I fear, you will never be quite equal to him. That, of
  course, is not to be expected. Still, you may do well enough, for the rising
  generation. We don't expect the young dogs to come up to the old ones. But
  march on, and let me have a good look at you. You are like your father, in
  one thing, and that a very great one&mdash;you don't want to talk too fast,
  young Master Jack."</p>

  <p>The young man, smiling at the short ways of the parson, did as he was
  ordered; <i>Trumpeter,</i> being gifted with a Roman nose, tossed it, and
  made good his name, by a lively blare to some large stables, which he espied
  in the distance, and hoped to flourish there in, a stall, and a store <i>non
  ignobilis otî.</i> In reply, the rooks began to caw, the queists to flit out
  of the ivied elms, the little dog, and the big dog, to yelp and bay,
  respectively, the gardener (who was resting on his laurels) to get up, the
  young lady, reading in a snaily chair, to gaze about; and all the other
  things began to embrace the rare opportunity of saluting a new arrival, at an
  ancient country-house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; OLD FRIENDS, AND YOUNG ONES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sheltered from the west winds, by the first of the range of
  hills, that trend away towards Cornwall, and from the east, by Dartmoor,
  Westcombe Hall is as nice a place, as any lover of a samely life, and a
  changeful landscape, may desire. For the beauty of the hills is variety of
  rigour, and the beauty of the valley is variety of softness; and the comfort
  of the home-life, is to see them, and be steadfast. Colonel Westcombe entered
  into such things calmly, without any consideration of them, after the battle
  of life, he had been through.</p>

  <p>The cawing of the rooks was a settled pleasure to him, and the lowing of
  the distant cows a space of soothing interest; the trees, and all the
  garden-plants (of which he had small knowledge) excited him to think about
  them, from the sense of ownership; and he began to study cocks, and hens,
  without any skewers through them. For still he was as lively as ever he had
  been; and the quantity of carnage, he had smelled in fields of glory,
  acquitted these, his elder days, of the younger duty to destroy.</p>

  <p>"Short, you see those trees," he said, as he sauntered forth, with that
  old friend, after dining at the old-fashioned hour, five o'clock; "wait a
  moment, come in here; never mind the young folk, they will get on well
  enough; though I don't want Jack to have her. Now here we can have a
  delicious little smoke. You like a pipe, so do I; not cigars&mdash;I have
  seen too much of the way they make them. Very well; help yourself. How very
  glad I am to see you!" This was the fiftieth time of saying that; but the
  parson said, "And so am I," very nearly every time. "You see those trees
  there," continued Colonel Westcombe, leaning back in his bower arm-chair;
  "they are a little green with moss, and so on&mdash;soft to the eye, I should
  call it, Short."</p>

  <p>"It is the duty of a tree to be as green as possible;" Mr. Short answered,
  with a puff of blue smoke.</p>

  <p>"You always cut my corners off. I mean, that the trunks of the trees are
  green; and that is not their duty. Well, this fellow, who is considered, and
  may be, the shining light of the neighbourhood, counselled me to peel off all
  the green, and treat the fine old fellows to three coats of whitewash. A
  pleasant view we should have had, from the windows, all the summer! What do
  you say to that? You know everything."</p>

  <p>"Do I? I don't know that, to begin with. The extent of my knowledge is, to
  know how much I don't know; for which I heartily thank Oxford. But I do know
  a man, who understands such things, and could give you the very best advice.
  Or rather I mean,&mdash;he is not to be had now; no, no, we must not think of
  him."</p>

  <p>"That reminds me," his host replied, "of the wonderful fellow in your
  parish, Short. A gentleman, you say he is; and you are no bad judge. You held
  out some hopes, that we might see his place; and what would please me even
  more, see him. You know that I am foolish, as my nature is, about things that
  come up, and take my fancy. I don't want to spend a lot of cash, of course;
  nobody ever does; and how can I tell, that I may not be turned out again,
  neck and crop? Another will might be discovered; or what not? And I am not
  sure that I should lament it very much. I like to do things for myself; and I
  believe every man under Wellington got into that style. We had no fine
  gentlemen, I can tell you; none of your Pompey's officers. But no more of
  that&mdash;you have heard it too often. All I meant to say is, that I want to
  get this place into a little better order; partly, because I like to see
  things decent, and partly because the people round about are not very well
  off; and yet to offer them money, except as wages, is an insult."</p>

  <p>This was a very long piece of discourse, for Colonel Westcombe to get
  through, without stopping; although he could tell a long story pretty well,
  when he thought it his duty, and got a good start. Meanwhile, Mr. Short was
  in a sad dilemma, (although he had foreseen this, and rehearsed it long)
  between his warm frankness to his old friend, and his duty, and goodwill, to
  that one living in his own dear parish. But he settled aright, and against
  his own desire&mdash;which is one of the true tests of right
  decision&mdash;to leave the captain dark as ever, in his own recess, and to
  stave off the colonel's curiosity about him. To the former, it might be a
  matter of great moment; whereas it is very little loss to any man, to be
  robbed of a thing that he never uses, unless he has paid for it
  heavily&mdash;advice.</p>

  <p>"You ought to begin at once, if you mean to do much good," said the vicar,
  looking round at the overhung lawn, and the trees moustached with moss, and
  fungus; "you are six weeks later, on this side of the moor, than we are at
  Christowell. But even here, not a day is to be lost, if you mean to do
  planting. My friend cannot possibly leave home now; and an accident has
  happened (a very sad affair, of which you will hear by-and-by) not on his
  threshold, but much worse&mdash;through the roof of his favourite vinery. I
  would not spoil your dinner, and some other little doings, by making your
  dear godchild anxious. And in reason, there need not be a shadow of anxiety,
  except for those wondrous doctors. Old Betty Sage, John Sage's Betty, would
  have put Dicky Touchwood on his pins in three days, with her simples, and
  careful diet. But our Dr. Perperaps, a truly fine practitioner, and a man of
  solid grounding, will scarcely get him out of hand, within three weeks, and
  may have to make three months of it."</p>

  <p>"What has happened to poor Dicky then? And why is Julia not to know?" The
  colonel gave a short, quick puff of smoke, because he hated mystery.</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery at all about it," replied Mr. Short, who had his own
  turn of temper, and knew every nerve of his old friend's mind; "Dicky
  Touchwood tumbled through the roof of a greenhouse, or vinery, or
  something&mdash;I don't understand their distinctions&mdash;and he cut his
  legs, or what he calls his legs, as much as such nonentities could well be
  cut. He came down, like a tipsy-cake stuck with splinters; and tipsy he was,
  unless they told me lies. But our place is not to jeer, but sympathize. I
  have not ventured into this short narrative, till now, because one can never
  tell, how anything will act upon another mind, or at any rate, a female
  one."</p>

  <p>"Short, you are right. I have observed that, often. The women know best in
  the end, I believe; but you never can tell, how they know it. Julia is full
  of sense; wonderfully so, to my mind; she gets at almost anything, five
  minutes before I do; and she sticks to it too; and that proves that she is
  right. But between you, and me, and the bedpost, Short&mdash;as the old
  ladies say&mdash;I don't want Jack to have her. There could not be a better
  girl, in many ways of looking at her. But she must have her own way, although
  she gets it gently. Jack, on the other hand, is very easy-tempered; but turn
  him you cannot, when once he has made his mind up. His wife, when he is old
  enough to want one, which we never used to think of, when I was young, should
  be amiable, gentle, fond of little jokes, and capable of making them when he
  wants them, well-bred, and totally indifferent about dress&mdash;the new
  fashions, I mean, and all that rubbish, that some women study, more than
  their own behaviour&mdash;also she ought to be diligent, and thrifty, tidy,
  and particular to keep him to his meal-times, an experienced judge of meat,
  and butter, full of understanding about doors, and windows, thoroughly
  warm-hearted, and not inclined to cough, when she smells tobacco-smoke."</p>

  <p>"To think of such a wife, makes a man's mouth water," Mr. Short answered,
  with a serious look; "there used to be some of them; but the young women now
  think more of themselves, than of anything else. It is my place, to pay
  attention to the women&mdash;well, not in the way that you are smiling at, my
  friend&mdash;what I mean to say is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well done, Short!" cried the colonel, putting down his pipe, and laughing
  heartily; "well done, my dear fellow! To be sure it is. And you magnify your
  office. I shall tell my dear wife that."</p>

  <p>"Now don't you be too clever; but just hear me out. A parson must attend
  to his women, not only for their own sake, but also to get at the men. You
  understand all about regiments, and that; but you never even heard perhaps of
  'parish work.' It is almost a new idea, in the Church as yet; and I am not at
  all sure, that it will do much good, because it comes from the Dissenters, I
  believe. If we come to make a fuss of it, it will do a lot of harm, and make
  our flocks take it into their heads, that our object is to drive them. They
  like very much to be driven, by fellows they can turn out, as soon as they
  are tired of them; but they never will be driven by a gentleman; so that all
  these doings must be done with skill."</p>

  <p>"I don't like to hear of such absurd inventions. When I was a boy, I knew
  a good deal of the clergy; and in Spain I came across some priests, who were
  very good and holy. But to come back to the women, Short&mdash;you understand
  them, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never said anything to that effect. Only, that I have to study
  them; which is a different thing altogether. You were talking about Miss
  Touchwood, and the sort of wife your son should have. I know the very girl
  for him&mdash;such a beauty&mdash;and a first-rate gardener; as well as all
  that you require. But two people cannot be matched by pattern. I have made a
  lot of matrimony, fetching them up to it, when it was needful, and reading
  the bans, and going through with it; and unless there is very bad temper on
  both sides, they get on respectably afterwards. But I am talking
  horn-book."</p>

  <p>"Horn-book ought to be talked much more, in the present wild days," said
  the colonel. "Soon there will be nothing sacred. Every idiot laughs at
  institution. However, to come back to Julia. She is a very handsome girl; and
  Jack&mdash;well, I don't want her to be too much here. She came to us
  suddenly; I don't know why; but rather out of spirits, and I could not ask
  the reason. My dear wife, who might have got it out of her quite prettily,
  has been laid up all the while, with a very bad attack; but she told me, in
  confidence, that it ought to be a love-affair."</p>

  <p>"Rather the contrary," answered the parson; "but as she has not told you,
  I will not. Her mother was unkind to her, to put it mildly. You know that 'my
  lady'&mdash;as she loves to he called&mdash;is sometimes very prompt of
  action. However, there are worse people in the world; and I trust that they
  are burning to be reconciled. I brought as good a message to Miss Touchwood,
  from her mother, as could be expected, considering their relation. Also I
  said, that poor Dicky wanted her; and she promised to go home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Short, you are a public benefactor. Three cheers for the influence of the
  clergy. I shall be sorry to lose Julia, of course; but still I would rather
  lose her, than Jack. Young fellows, nowadays, think very little of the wisdom
  of their parents. But who is the girl, that he ought to have? I shall come,
  and see her, if she lives at Christowell."</p>

  <p>"Time enough to think of that, my friend. No one admitted, except on
  business. You will have to send your card in, and write upon it, 'I want to
  see the young lady, Jack ought to have.' But what a hurry you are in, about
  him! He is only three-and-twenty, according to my reckoning. 'Let un 'baide,'
  as John Sage says, 'let un 'baide, till a' getteth a buzzum.' By-the-by, our
  John would suit you well, for laying out ground, or for seeing to your trees,
  or shaping out a new kitchen-garden. All flowers he despises, except
  cauliflowers. He says that the Lord made the flowers to grow wild, on purpose
  to vex Solomon; but Solomon, and the Lord together, couldn't grow cabbage,
  without manure&mdash;or 'mannering,' as he calls it. He knows the Old
  Testament, ten times as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"Short, I will have him; if only for that. Such men are obstinate; but
  brave, and honest. I have seen lots of them, in the army, generally
  Scotchmen. No infidel Frenchman could stand before them. How much money will
  he want, a week?"</p>

  <p>"Eight shillings is the proper thing at Christowell. But then they get
  pickings, that work it up to nine, and even ten, in harvest-time. But I am
  not at all sure, that he would go from home. Our people know, when they are
  well off."</p>

  <p>"Let him come to me, for three months, and go home for the harvest. I will
  give him twelve shillings a week, and house-room. And if we get on together,
  he may settle here."</p>

  <p>"Tell it not, on our side of the moor; and warn him, not to speak of it.
  Every solid head in our parish would be turned; but Sage can keep his own
  counsel. He shall come to you, by this day week; but only on a three months'
  lease, at the longest. Christowell will not be itself, without him; and if
  anything important comes to pass, we shall have to send for him, to pronounce
  upon it. I shall miss him in church, more than a big pewful; he nods at me
  always, when I say the right thing, and he taps on the floor, with his
  ground-ash stick."</p>

  <p>"We will not rob you of such a hearer, Short," said the colonel,
  perceiving what a sacrifice he asked; "your church, and parish, shall enjoy
  him, on a Sunday. I told you that I had taken, from the Duchy, a lease of the
  sporting over some ten thousand acres, upon which there may be ten head of
  game, in a favourable season. But, at £10 a year, it is cheap enough; and I
  may improve it, if I can. It was done through my old friend, General Punk,
  who has interest with the steward, and who promised to come down, every year,
  if I would do it; and it is cheap enough to see an old friend, at that rent.
  And Jack was quite up for it, when I told him; for he likes to march forty
  miles a day, I do believe; which is all very well, when you choose for
  yourself your route, your weather, and your toggery. I intend to try red
  grouse there, as well as black. They do in bleaker places than Dartmoor even.
  It is not a new experiment&mdash;I know that. But experiments require luck,
  and perseverance, even more than skill, I do believe. At any rate, I mean to
  try it."</p>

  <p>"You are a sanguine man," the vicar answered; "I wish that I could say so,
  of myself. But try it, my dear fellow; by all means, try it. But John Sage
  does not understand game-keeping."</p>

  <p>"And I don't want him to understand it," returned the gallant colonel; "it
  is not like pheasant-hatching, or skilled work. You turn out your grouse,
  with their wings a little tipped, and you let them take their chance; that is
  my idea. Only they must not be harassed, just at first, until they learn
  their whereabouts; or off they go. And it must be done, at the right time of
  year, and according to the season. Some of my birds are turned out already.
  Another batch comes next week; and failing these, I shall try a lot of
  cheepers, in June, if I can get them. You know that I am not a strict
  game-preserver. I would never insist upon 'pheasants <i>v.</i>
  peasants'&mdash;as the radical papers term it. But my little crotchet can
  breed no ill-will; for everybody about here is delighted with it; and it will
  put money in some honest fellow's pocket."</p>

  <p>"But how will John Sage help, in this little scheme? He may be the wisest
  of mankind, as everybody knows, and especially himself&mdash;but he doesn't
  know a grouse from a game-cock, or at any rate, not a red one."</p>

  <p>"So much the better. He will take more interest in the subject, from its
  novelty. But have no fear, Short, of my perverting your Solomon, into a
  Nimrod. Nothing of the kind is in my thoughts. My grouse hobby only concerns
  him thus&mdash;I have made a little hut in the shelter of a tor&mdash;I think
  they call it Weist-tor, but I never know their tors&mdash;where a man may be
  comfortable, and put up his pony. I want an honest man to be there, every now
  and then; or to have it supposed, that he may be there. It is about half way,
  to your delightful parish; which seems to be the home of every virtue. Very
  well; Sage shall have the old grey pony, who knows every stone upon the moor,
  I do believe; and every Saturday, if he likes to do it, he shall set off for
  his native place, with a gallon of cider, and a bag of kitchen-victuals, and
  be his own master till Monday morning."</p>

  <p>"It is well discovered, and it shall come true," Mr. Short answered, with
  a smile at thinking of the figure Sage would cut, and the importance he would
  show; "the old man understands the moors, as well as a pee-wit; and better
  than your red grouse will. But one thing you forget&mdash;-the superstition
  of the race. Weist-tor is almost as awful, to the native mind, as Wistman's
  wood, or even Cranmere pool itself. If you gave John Sage £10 every time, he
  would not go there at night-fall."</p>

  <p>"We will get over that, somehow, or other. Entrap him there once, and he
  will grow foolhardy. I can always make men go, where I want to send them. I
  have set my mind on this, because it will keep up regular communication
  between us. I shall send you butter, and grapes, when I get any; and you can
  send me, now and then, a comb of the honey, for which Christowell is famous.
  You get about half the rain, that we do, I believe. But what a time Manx is,
  with our coffee! I must go and rout him up, I do believe."</p>

  <p>"Here comes our coffee; well done, cupbearer! The best, and the cleverest
  dog, in the world. No, not to me first; to the colonel first, because, though
  I am the visitor, you are my butler. That's right. Did you see, my dear
  fellow, how he balanced it?"</p>

  <p>"Talk about reasoning powers!" said the colonel; "I never saw any man do
  it, half so well. And this is your dog, <i>Nous,</i> then? I am not given to
  envy; but&mdash;my goodness&mdash;did you notice how he wagged his tail? He
  would not do it, till you took the cup, for fear of spilling. Well, I have
  seen the very best-bred footman laugh, at a joke of his betters (as they call
  themselves), and spoil a lady's dress, while she was putting in her cream.
  And they talk of these dogs having no mind, Short!"</p>

  <p>"Not only does <i>Nous</i> understand plain English," answered Mr. Short,
  as the dog laid down the little butter tub, which had contained the cups,
  "but he knows what is passing in a man's mind, better, very often, than the
  man himself does. But women are a dreadful puzzle to him."</p>

  <p>"So they ought to be; I admire him the more. Come here, and let me thank
  you, good dog, and clever one. Short, you are too sharp for me. I never even
  knew this dog was here. You arranged it all with Manx, as to what he was to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. I told the man, that he could wait at table; but he
  laughed at me; and thus is he discomfited. I told your stableman, when he
  knotted <i>Nous</i> up, that no knot known in the Royal Navy would hold the
  dog, more than two hours; but he laughed, and said that unless he bit the
  rope through, he was fast for ever. He never attempts to bite any rope now,
  because I smacked him for it, once; but he unties any knot, with nose,
  tongue, and foot."</p>

  <p>"It has made your poor nose bleed, old doggie; show us what it is then?
  You mustn't be so clever." Colonel Westcombe loved dogs; and they always felt
  it.</p>

  <p>"It must be something else. Upon my word, the wretch has hit him. Just a
  graze on the tip of his sensitive nose; and his labour at the knot has set it
  off."</p>

  <p>Then the vicar, in hot indignation, poured forth his grievance against
  that low skulk with a gun, which he had not spoken of at dinnertime, for fear
  of spoiling cheerfulness. His host listened gravely, and was shocked at such
  low villainy; and said that he had heard of a desperate fellow, lurking in
  the depths of the moor, and killing sheep; and the moor-men were afraid of
  him, because he had a gun.</p>

  <p>"Sooner, or later, we shall catch him," he continued; "I have heard of
  him, from our chief constable. He believes him to be a noted murderer; a
  fellow who has killed two women, in cold blood. Let us say no more about him.
  Do you see Julia? How noble she looks, when her spirit is up! Master Jack has
  got more than he can do, to hold his own."</p>

  <p>With the pair in the distance, who had no coffee, things were going on,
  even as he said. Jack Westcombe, although he had taken his degree, or perhaps
  for that reason, was shy with young ladies; of whom he knew little, having
  never a sister, to lead him amongst them, and describe their little tricks.
  Miss Touchwood knew this, and made the most of it.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say, Mr. Westcombe," she went on; "that you mean to do
  nothing, and be nothing, in the world? It does seem such a waste of power, in
  these very earnest times."</p>

  <p>"My great aunt was asking me about it the other day," said Jack, who had a
  dry way, when heavily attacked, of remitting his assailants to their own
  business; "and she has a right to ask, because she means to leave me
  something."</p>

  <p>"Yes, to be sure; how good of her! She must have entered into the more
  recent spirit, the glorious development of mind, and matter. What a joy it
  is, to find that these high perceptions are penetrating, even to the passing
  generation! What an incentive to the younger mind! Did she propose any
  definite work, anything earnest, and advancing?"</p>

  <p>"She did; an advance very definite indeed; but scarcely of a nature,
  perhaps, to interest young ladies. I will tell Lady Touchwood of it, when I
  come over."</p>

  <p>"My mother takes very little interest in improvement. She seems to think
  it quite enough, to be no worse than we used to be."</p>

  <p>"But your brother, Miss Touchwood; surely he may be developed, elevated,
  rendered progressive, and all that?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, my brother has no mind," she replied, with firm serenity;
  "but many people seem to like him all the better for it; particularly, I
  believe, at Cambridge. But you are very different. Your father has been
  telling me, how much he is afraid that you will be too intellectual."</p>

  <p>"My father is the kindest-hearted man, in all the world. And since he came
  into this property, he thinks it his very first duty to be cheated, right and
  left; especially by his very intellectual son."</p>

  <p>"How I admire this grand old place!" the young lady cried, as she sprang
  upon a bank of moss, besieged with primroses; "any one, who lives here, ought
  to be cheated; just to balance nature's gifts. Look, how the sunset warms,
  and deepens, the crimson of the bricks, and the grey granite facings, and the
  glitter of the ivy round the bows! And the grand old trees, full of mystery,
  and honour; and the beautiful slope of the lawn, unbroken by patches of
  glaring ugly dazzle, and patterns of hideous stiffness; and the murmur of the
  brook, like a soft strain of music, coming through the joyful buds of spring.
  Oh, how I wish our place was like this!"</p>

  <p>"I have never been at Touchwood Park," said Jack, looking slyly at his
  beautiful companion, whose colour was heightened, and figure set forth, by
  excitement; "but from all, that I hear, it is a brilliant place, one of the
  highest developments of the age. This is a very old, humdrum, benighted,
  obsolete product of the darker ages. I am sure, you would never like to live
  here."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't I? If I only had the chance!" Then Julia blushed deeply, as her
  eyes met his; and even Jack's cheeks, which were always rather ruddy, showed
  sympathy with the sunset, as the fair one turned away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; A SMALL COMMISSION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Upon the dreary moor, there is little pleasure of spring, or
  joy of summer, because of the absence of that beauty (transcending the
  loveliest daughter of mankind), the excellent beauty of the trees; which man
  was meant to nourish, but loves better to demolish.</p>

  <p>Only in the softer wrinkles, where the hard face of the land relaxes into
  a smile aside, has any tree a hope of standing, against the fierce wind, and
  scowling sky. But in the few spots, where shelter helps them, and frugal
  virtue of the soil gives food, the pleasure of surprise multiplies their
  beauty; and the jagged granite sets their green off, with a spiked white
  chain around their necks. These quiet dingles are the very sweetest places,
  for any man to wander through, with the spring of the year around him, and
  the sound of crispness following his steps, and plenty of time to see things
  grow.</p>

  <p>When the smiting wind, from the wilderness, leaps over the bristly ramp of
  furze, and after a few dying kicks, expires; the soft kind creatures, that
  have finer feelings, rejoice down below, and hug themselves. For here, they
  have safety, and comfort, and repose, and a soil glad with sweet ooziness;
  and the sprinkle of tempestuous air ruffles through them peacefully, and the
  hushing of the wind is music.</p>

  <p>In such a gentle place, set largely with promiscuous hope, and strewn with
  more than good intentions of the modest work of spring, the foot of a savage
  man crushed the moss, and a tumult, harsher than that of the wildest wind,
  stirred through the branches. Forsaken of all his fellows' love, and
  disdainful of his Maker's, as wild a man as ever trod the earth; because he
  had no love of anything. Even as a baby of low nature may be known, by its
  cruel look at a little bird, or fly, and a boy of nasty instincts, by his
  torture of a frog; so a thoroughly hard man shows himself, by doing despite
  to the goodwill of his mother earth.</p>

  <p>This man came along, with a fierce glitter in his eyes, and a slouching of
  his lumpy neck, and scorn of men stamped upon his bulky forehead, gingery
  brows, and grimy cheeks. The shape of his face had once been fine, the
  features strong, and regular; and a mighty strength of will had made it, in
  the prosperous days, impressive. But no one would think of considering it
  now, as a matter of kind interest; the impulse, of any one beholding it,
  would be to prefer the other side of Dartmoor.</p>

  <p>The man, who was tall, and of vigorous frame, contrived to crush
  everything, that could be crushed by one pair of feet, planted recklessly.
  His coat was of undressed sheepskin, with the wool torn, and worn, by the
  briars, and rocks; his breeches were of rickcloth, sewn roughly by himself;
  his cap of badger-skin; and about him there was nothing of tradesman's work,
  except his boots. These had been stolen, from a shop, or cart, or perhaps
  from some gentleman's dwelling-house; for clearly enough, they were boots of
  good art, flexible, shapely, strong, and lively, and really inclined to be
  waterproof, on the feet of a clever wearer. They had a very clever wearer
  now, who, instead of cracking them with blacking, anointed them daily with
  raw fat, which they sucked into their constitution.</p>

  <p>There were many who desired to catch this man, for a heavy reward was upon
  him; but any one, looking at him, would think twice, before raising hand, to
  lay hold of him. For he carried a big double-barrelled gun, of heavy bore,
  not too long to be handy, and having percussion locks, a novelty as yet among
  the simple sportsmen of the moor. Wild, and savage, and reckless as he
  looked, with the stain of the bogs, and the fray of the rocks, and ravellings
  of time, and weather; it was manifest, that he set store by his gun, which
  was clean, well-oiled, and in good condition. Even now, fiercely as he trod
  his way, among delicate growth, frail bud, and gentle flower, he bore his
  heavy weapon carefully, and watchfully, lest any bough should bruise, or
  sharp rock scratch it. Also he kept his keen eyes on the strain, for he was
  going to a doubtful, and perilous appointment.</p>

  <p>"If he has doubled on me, he dies first," was the comfort he kept on
  administering to himself, although it did not make him comfortable; "he would
  turn upon himself, if he were paid, and could run away from it. There are
  many blackguards in the world; but none fit to hold a candle, to my clever,
  and exalted friend. He has thriven, and I have failed; because I had
  scruples, and he had none. But I have one pull upon him&mdash;his life is
  much to him; mine is a very small thing to me."</p>

  <p>In the bend of this glen, where the wood grows thickest, there is a little
  driblet of a spring, that falls&mdash;by way of an early lesson to
  itself&mdash;almost as soon as it has done rising, over a rib of its hard
  mother granite. Certainly a few things fond of water come to alleviate its
  first mishap&mdash;moss for instance, and the stems of wet-bine, and crinkled
  caddis reeds, that introduce themselves, as conduits. Still there the fall
  is, and it must be fallen, even though it be five bad yards deep, amid a
  little jubilee of fluttering expectants, flower, and leaf, and crocketed
  frond, jerk-tailed gnat, and snub-nosed fernweb, the little mouse that lives
  in a gossamer almost, and the rabbit who builds him a castle of
  sand&mdash;all of them rejoicing in the tiny spout of crystal, the jeopardy
  of a sprinkle, from a whiff of wind across it, and the freshness of the
  seed-pearls, that glisten in the sunshine, or make a sliding string of some
  long flower-stem they have stolen.</p>

  <p>Upon a slab of granite, near a stool of budding hazel, where the clear
  little thread of water frayed itself into a fantastic knot, at the base of
  the crag that shaped it, there sat a man of impatient mind, high colour, and
  strong character. Not such character, perhaps, as those who aim at the
  welfare of the human race would desire to increase, and multiply; but such as
  many positive moralists prefer to what they call "the washed out type of
  persons, without any will of their own." In a word, here was the red-faced
  man.</p>

  <p>The style of courteous bluffness, and of pleasant arrogance, which liked
  him well, and made clever women hate him so, was not at all the cue to suit
  him now. For now he had to deal, with a man that knew him, and felt for him
  even less respect, than he still was able to nourish for himself. On this
  account, George Gaston allowed himself to look as nearly as possible the
  animal he was&mdash;an ill-bred, ill-conditioned man; who had chosen the
  evil, rather than the good; and despised the good, because he never could
  regain it.</p>

  <p>Guy Wenlow, the murderer of two women&mdash;if verdicts could be
  trusted&mdash;and now the outcast of the moor, was forcing his overhung, and
  tangled way, to the place of appointment, with such a reckless noise; partly
  through ferocity, and partly of set purpose. For he wanted to show that he
  was not afraid of any one, but could roam where he pleased, like a gentleman
  at large.</p>

  <p>Generally, when two big villains meet, for concoction of further villainy,
  one of them takes the upper hand, and keeps it, in virtue&mdash;if the word
  may so be used&mdash;of more skilful, and masterful villainy. This was what
  Gaston intended to do; and Wenlow was equally resolved to do it. But a man
  who has dwelt in the desert for a twelvemonth, and mainly been dealing with
  the larger forms of nature, lies at a sad disadvantage before his fellow, who
  has never missed a day, in the factory, and mart of lies.</p>

  <p>George Gaston smiled at his former comrade, as he broke from the covert
  into the rugged opening, with his gun at full-cock, and eyes flashing
  defiance. "Did you think that I would harm you?" he asked rather sadly; "is
  there no confidence, among old friends?"</p>

  <p>"Talk no rubbish," the old friend replied; "if you could gain sixpence by
  hanging me, and keep your own body out of it, you would do it. What do you
  want with me? My time is short."</p>

  <p>"Your time will be shorter, if you so misuse it. You are soured by
  retirement, instead of growing mellow. I am disappointed, by your want of
  cordiality."</p>

  <p>The man of the sheepskins turned away with an oath, and threw his gun on
  his shoulder. "I came a long way to oblige you," he said; "Good-bye! You will
  swing before I do."</p>

  <p>"Civilization has no sweets for him. There was a time, when he loved
  potted char. But now he cares only for Dartmoor mutton."</p>

  <p>"Gaston," cried the other, coming back with dignity, and yet with some
  signs of desire about his mouth, "is it potted char? What a memory you have!
  If you only knew, how sick I am of mutton!"</p>

  <p>"It is potted char, from the only house possessing any connection with the
  genuine fish. The brand is on the top, and the bottom, and the sides, and
  especially over the place to put the knife in; because of the sad increase of
  commercial roguery. The smell alone will indicate how genuine it is. A 3 lb.
  pot, for old lang syne. But alas, there is no true friendship left!"</p>

  <p>"How many pots of it have you brought? This is truly kind, on your part,
  George. No one has shown a bit of care about my likings, ever since every one
  turned against me. But what is it you want of me, in return for all this
  bribery?"</p>

  <p>"Only a little thing, Guy Wenlow; a trifle altogether, for a man of your
  position. I am half ashamed to give you such a trumpery commission. But it
  may lead to better things for both of us, hereafter."</p>

  <p>"No mealy mouth about it, George. I care very little what I do now."</p>

  <p>"Well, this is a thing that you will like to do. You hate any fellow, that
  sticks up to be a wonder?"</p>

  <p>"That I do, with all my heart. It is humbug, rank humbug. We are all
  alike. You know it, as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"Never mind moralizing now. Do you remember a tale I told you, that night
  when the lightning was so frightful on the heath?"</p>

  <p>"Every word of it," answered the other, with a laugh; "for it let me into
  a little secret, that even George Gaston was afraid of something. 'Let us
  talk of something good,' you said, 'the weather is so awful; let us talk of
  something good.' Fie, George, fie, to be a coward of a thunder-cloud!"</p>

  <p>"If you had seen what I have, ay and felt it too, you would sing another
  song, Guy Wenlow. Some men attract it, some repel. Twice have I been struck;
  and the colour of my face&mdash;but never mind now&mdash;it never thunders
  here."</p>

  <p>"That shows your ignorance of the moor. You should hear it rattle round
  the tors, sometimes. But what am I to do for you? And how much for it?"</p>

  <p>"All you have to do for me, is to knock down a small boy. And for that you
  shall have £5 in gold. Unless you like to do it, from good feeling only. For
  what chance can you get of spending any money?"</p>

  <p>"Gaston, you always were a despicable screw. To knock down a boy, costs
  five shillings, and expenses. For £5, twenty boys should be knocked down; and
  you are not the man to pay too much. What you want, is a bigger job than
  that. Out with it!"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you want a big name for it, and small crimes do not suit you,
  Guy, you may call it the robbery of Her Majesty's mail, as represented by a
  cobbler's boy. The man of whom I told you that fine story, a cock-a-hoop, a
  high-flyer, a romantic fool of honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You called him none of that, George Gaston, when the lightning was around
  you. He was a marvel of good works then; and to praise him seemed to protect
  you in your trembles."</p>

  <p>"Pest upon that! I was nervous, I confess. Every one has his weak point, I
  suppose. What he may be, is no concern of yours. All you have to do, is to
  look after him for me. And if you do it well, you shall have handsome pay.
  Even in the wilderness, you want money. Without it, you would have been taken
  long ago. And, to break into farm-houses, is but onions, and bacon. A little
  healthy business, on the outskirts of the moor, will cure you of bog ague,
  and put cash in your woolly pockets. Wenlow, I congratulate you, on your
  brave appearance."</p>

  <p>"Any fool can laugh. You are wasting time. I cannot. My day is divided;
  and I never knew the value of time, till I had to score it by the
  shadows."</p>

  <p>"And to keep on the shadowy side of the score. Impatient man, I will be
  brief. Have you ever heard of Christowell?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about it. I have got an eye to the parson's house. You
  may hear of something I do there."</p>

  <p>"Try nothing of the kind. It is a very quiet hole, and must be treated
  quietly. Under the beacon, lives our friend, who made such a fool of himself
  years back. There he has got a sort of hut, and garden&mdash;a craze, a bit
  of madness, suited to his strange propensities. He was knocked on the head,
  in some battle, I believe; and the earth went in upon his brain, and stayed
  there. He is cracked about gardening, and the things the worms do. He pounds
  away, and labours with his naked arms, as if he had been born in a
  brick-field. I saw him myself, or I could not have believed it. I was let in,
  by a man who knows every rat-hole of the premises. The fellow was a mass of
  mould, and grime, when he might have been rolling in guineas."</p>

  <p>"I like a man of that sort. He cannot be a sneak," Black Wenlow replied,
  with a look that meant, 'like you my friend.'" It will take more than £5, to
  make me go against him."</p>

  <p>"What a sentimental turn that is! Such a lesson in morality is worth £5. A
  man is enabled to charge for his work, according to his character; £10 will
  be very handsome, for a man of yours. You know the man I mean, from my
  description. The chaw-bacons call him 'Captain Larks.' I have no time to tell
  you, how I am concerned with his affairs; and if I had, it would do no good.
  The practical part of the matter is, that I want to keep him as he
  is&mdash;retired, industrious, respectable, and wholly in the dark about his
  family affairs. He has quitted the world, of his own accord; he is as happy
  as a king; and I wish him to continue so. His return to civilized life would
  be a plague to me, as well as a misery to himself. I wish him well, with all
  my heart; for I always liked a magnanimous fool, a boy who sees the world
  through his own pea-shooter. Perhaps he has never even heard of me; for I
  have arisen since his day."</p>

  <p>"I have no time to hearken to all these items. I have to watch the
  shadows, as a painter does. Tell me what I have to do; and never mind the
  reasons."</p>

  <p>"All you have to do is, to keep watch upon the man. He must not go from
  home, without my hearing of it, by a letter through the old rogue at the
  <i>Raven.</i> And another thing, still more important, is that he must not
  receive any letters. I shall leave Exeter, by the <i>Quicksilver,</i> this
  evening, having discovered all I want to know at present. On Monday, the
  lawyers of the family will write to him, having at last found him out,
  through me, after a score of advertisements had failed. That letter will be
  due to me; and I must have it. It must go through the post, and bear the
  proper postmarks; but instead of being delivered to Captain Larks, it must be
  handed over to your humble servant."</p>

  <p>"And you wanted me to rob the mail for £5! Many things amaze me in your
  nature; but one thing astounds me&mdash;your quantity of brass."</p>

  <p>"Cheek is now the word for it, since your disappearance from polite
  society. But the name is bigger than the job, Guy Wenlow. To-morrow will be
  the first of May. On Wednesday morning, the letter will come to Christowell,
  about ten o'clock as usual, and be left at the house of James Trickey, the
  cobbler. A new postage 'envelope,' some new-fangled crotchet for cheap
  letters, is to be issued on the first of May; with the postage paid, or some
  such stuff. All Christowell will be goggle-eyed, for a long time after these
  come to hand. I shall send two dozen dummies to people, whose names I have
  picked up. Trickey will be mazed, as they call it about here, and attribute
  all these wonders to the Pixies, and the witches. He won't venture out of
  sight of his own door, that day; especially at such a time of year, when the
  evil spirits do their worst. His little boy Bob, who is too young to be
  afraid, will be sent up the hill with the captain's letter. Scare him to the
  point of death; but don't hurt him."</p>

  <p>"You need not tell me that; I am benevolence itself. Very well, I take his
  letter; and what then? On the moor are no post-offices."</p>

  <p>"But the man at the <i>Raven</i> can be trusted. He makes a good thing out
  of you. For any pretty bit of skill, a noble door is opened by all this new
  nonsense about cheap letters, and paying for their carriage beforehand. When
  there was eightpence to pay, it could be shown whether anybody paid the
  eightpence; but who will know now, what becomes of a letter, when the
  interest of the post-office is to take the dirty penny, and have no more
  bother with it? Such a plan may last a month perhaps; and throughout that
  month, will be a muddle. All that I have foreseen; and timed your little plan
  accordingly. A hideous thing, called an 'envelope'&mdash;because there is no
  English name for it&mdash;will contain this letter for Captain Larks. All you
  have to do, is to take it from the boy, go to the <i>Raven</i> the same night
  with it, before any fuss arises, find my instructions, and follow them."</p>

  <p>"That is all very simple, and a credit to you, Gaston. But excuse my
  anxiety about the cash. The sum is a small one; but the times are bad with
  me. These miserly clod-hoppers smuggle off their money to a bank, instead of
  their bolster, or the thatch. For a month, I have not known where to turn,
  for a hit of honest plunder. Even the <i>Raven</i> begins to look askew at
  me."</p>

  <p>"That shall be righted; and you must not be too active now, except upon my
  business. You have your head-quarters, the Lord knows where, in the depth of
  this horrible wilderness. The man of the <i>Raven</i> is a very decent
  fellow, and would sell his good old wife, for a fair consideration. The moor
  is delightful, at this time of year, and the air ecstatically bracing. Stock
  yourself well, to the extent of a sovereign (which I will leave with mine
  host on account), spend a few days healthfully, in the boggiest quarters of
  your beat, enjoy my potted char, and some very choice pig-tail, which I will
  leave for you&mdash;a perfect charm for all aches, and agues&mdash;and then,
  on Wednesday morning, earn your balance, repair to the trysting-place, and
  get it."</p>

  <p>"You go on so fast, when you want to slur a point. Slow and sure, is my
  style of business. Am I to look for you, at that filthy hole, on
  Wednesday?"</p>

  <p>"Is there no meaning in the English language? I said that you then would
  find my instructions, and according to them, send back the letter. After
  that, your care of Captain Larks begins. Lest haply he should hear of things,
  from any other quarter, which it is his hearty desire, and truest interest,
  not to know. Having hit upon a clue to him, some half year ago, I have
  employed some nicety in placing all advertisements, or at least in suggesting
  the quarter for them, so that none of them should hit him. But now I make a
  clean breast to the men of law, who have a perfectly just faith in me. By
  vast exertions, I have found the man. They will write to him, after much sage
  counsel, a letter for which they will charge two guineas, though it is to go
  two hundred miles, for one penny. For another penny, it comes back to them.
  Wonderful is the insolence of this age. How happy are you, who live out of
  it! Steam-coaches are beginning to run madly all about. Next year they are to
  come to Bristol. They are taking everybody's land, without his leave. That
  has something to do with the urgency of this matter. It outrages all one's
  sense of justice. But, thank heaven, there are still some people, who know
  what is right, and stick to it!"</p>

  <p>"And foremost of them all, George Gaston. Very well, I know now what you
  want, and will carry it out most faithfully. Where will the tobacco be? I
  want that first. If you knew what stuff I am obliged to smoke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You shall have it to-night, with your outfit, at the <i>Raven.</i> Lay
  aside, once and for all, your most narrow idea, that I stint anything. Of all
  men, I am the most liberal, when it pays."</p>

  <p>"To me, you should be more than liberal, George. Whose doing is it, that I
  lead this life? Who first led me, to despise my home, to want to be more than
  I was meant for, to gamble away my poor father's savings, to rob my sister,
  to break my mother's heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Guy Wenlow, this tenderness is not thrown away on me. It proves that your
  heart is in the right place still; though it may have sadly roamed away from
  it. But we must not linger. The whole world is in a hurry. Nobody looks back;
  everybody forward. Repentance, and remorse, are a pair of old samplers. The
  <i>Quicksilver</i> average is fourteen miles an hour; and the horses must be
  changed, in thirty seconds, to show that they can beat steam-coaches. When
  you were a sporting character, Guy Wenlow, with £50 on each side of your
  stomach, how you would have loved to sit behind those horses! But they summon
  me; I seem to hear them neigh."</p>

  <p>The better of the two men turned away, to hide the tear which the memory
  of his mother, or perhaps of the horses, had called forth. Then he swung his
  heavy gun, upon his shoulder, and made off. "One little trifle I forgot to
  mention," the other shouted after him, "a thing that will make you stick the
  closer to your duty. The captain's daughter is the loveliest girl, that can
  be found, even in Devonshire. You are an admirer of the sex. <i>Verbum
  sat.</i>"</p>

  <p>"We are told, that the devil lives on Dartmoor," cried the outcast; "but
  now he means to come to and fro, by the <i>Quicksilver.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Go thy way. The fool, and the woman, have privilege of last word," Gaston
  muttered. Then putting away a pistol, which had been hidden near his fingers,
  he discharged into his mouth a more peaceful implement, known among
  travellers by the same name. With his high colour heightened, he arose, and
  left the dell; whose beauty was not impaired by his departure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE DANCING TREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Among the few places that now keep shops, on the threadbare
  skirt of Dartmoor, one of the kindest, and most tranquil-minded, is that
  little town, Moreton Hampstead.</p>

  <p>A man of fine leisure, and liberal ease, with a ripe turn for
  contemplation, may be looked for&mdash;if any one is rude enough to want
  him&mdash;first near the tap of his favourite inn; then about the
  reading-room, or post-office; after that, clearly at the farrier's shop; and
  for the rest of the day, on the bridge, with a pipe in his mouth, and hands
  in pocket.</p>

  <p>The great defect of Moreton is therefore this, that it owns no bridge of
  any kind, for such transcendent uses. But in plea of that, it may well be
  urged (if any man there can be urgent) first that if any bridge were needed,
  no one could ever find the energy to build it; and next that no genuine
  Moreton man would go forth to a bridge, for his lounge, while he can get it,
  right happily, on his own window-ledge. If ever he is wanted, which very
  seldom happens, there he may be found, during those short periods, when he is
  not feeding, or profoundly asleep. Now as to those two <i>alibis,</i> the
  former is strictly sacred. The shop-door is bolted, and the bell unhung; and
  from twelve o'clock, till two, the only business considered, is the commerce
  of the interior. Then if anybody, scanty of good manners, thumps upon the
  door, why just let him thump again. With a relish, as of pickles, or of very
  cool cucumber, the hearty tradesman smacks his lips, and labours at the
  self-help most congenial to him,&mdash;a large help of very lofty order of
  mutton. If, at two o'clock, he unbolts his door, and rehangs his bell, he may
  be taken at the moment, and goaded into a shout to his wife, to know the
  price of something, now hanging in his window. However, if his wife makes no
  reply&mdash;as generally happens, for she is of his own race&mdash;he will
  ask the brisk customer, how much he has been in the habit of giving for the
  article. If the customer forgets, or prefers not to tell, because he expects
  to get it cheaper here, the worthy shopkeeper talks about invoices, which he
  cannot lay his hand upon just now, but will do so at his earliest leisure,
  and the gentleman may take it, and come, and know the price to-morrow. Then
  he retires for his afternoon nap, having done a striking stroke of
  business.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there are two people often wide-awake at Moreton. One is the
  boy, with two buckets, and a mop, who invades the gentle streets, soon after
  breakfast, and stirs the narrow echoes with his constant cry&mdash;"Wash yer
  winders for 'ee!" As nobody ever washes his own windows, and the wind asserts
  its hereditary, and perhaps etymologic, right to invest every window with a
  coat of granite grime, this boy has got to move both arms at once, and
  becomes a pleasant sight, for those who never do so.</p>

  <p>Or rather, those who do so, only when they are a-dancing. Because of so
  being asleep all day, and having no bridge to yawn upon, Moreton is&mdash;or
  was, until a railway rushed into the bottom&mdash;"the chiefest place for
  dancing, to be found in merry Devonsheer." While a man slumbers sweetly,
  against the partition, that severs his nice little parlour from his shop (it
  is needless to say, upon which side he is) another man, knowing the trick of
  the door, runs in (though nothing else could ever make him run) and handling
  him by the head, against the wall, pulsatively, stirs up the muffled drum of
  his outer ear, by blowing down the conch of his other palm into
  it&mdash;"Ball to-night! Zax o'clock." "How much be tickutts?" asks the firm
  reposer, with a rub of his eyes, and a tingle in his head. "Zaxpince
  aich&mdash;dree vor a zhillun." Then he feels in the fork of his clothes, and
  pays a shilling.</p>

  <p>This is the other man, who keeps on moving, and whips round the corners,
  quicker than a window can go up. He gets up the dances, and he knows the way
  to do it, calling on the ladies first, and putting clearly to them, that all
  the gentlemen in the place are wild, about getting them to come, but on no
  account would trouble them to come, except just as they are. Nothing in the
  way of dress could make them look better than they do now; and he chins up
  his fiddle, and touches two strings. Every lady looks demure, and says that
  she really dislikes dancing, and did hope to have heard the last of it. But
  rather than disappoint her neighbours, she will take one ticket. Then he
  twangs again; and with an eye to strict economy, she takes six.</p>

  <p>Behold, how unjust a thing it is to attempt to be too accurate! There is
  another active man in Moreton Hampstead, and his name is Timothy Pugsley.
  Happily for the town, which never could endure three moving spirits, the
  greater part of his time goes away, among the lanes, and across the hills.
  When he comes home at night, with Teddy, the two of them want stable. They
  are stiff about their joints, and say to themselves, and to one another, that
  they would go ten miles more, if needful, but can see no more to do to-day,
  except victuals; and are glad of it. Teddy has a mash, with hay to follow,
  and oats enough to dream of; and Timothy has a pan of fried potatoes,
  browning on the fire, with a plate turned over them, and bacon making little
  pops around the plate's edges, and jumping up at every pop, in a hurry to be
  tasted.</p>

  <p>Timothy feels, as well as smells, after twelve hours on the moor, this
  joy; and he thanks the Lord, to find a warm house round him, a safe
  deliverance from robbers, storm, and accident, an uncommonly sharp appetite,
  with victuals fit to sharpen it, and a wife, who keeps his house in order,
  and can fry potatoes.</p>

  <p>Yet, the most lively, and dissipated being, in all the town of Moreton, is
  neither the window-washing boy, nor the great Chorægus, nor even Timothy
  Pugsley; but a tree, of great weight, and very prominent position, and old
  enough to know better. Whether its lineage is from one that danced to the
  lyre of Orpheus, or whether any Dryad with a tripping foot possesses
  it,&mdash;at any rate, this is the dancing tree. For many years now, it has
  left off dancing, even if it ever did begin, and has to be contented with the
  legal truth&mdash;"who does through another, does the thing himself." And to
  make sure, it does it, through a great many others.</p>

  <p>Especially, on the first of May, when the festival of Pales&mdash;as the
  learned tell us&mdash;is well observed by Christians. Instead of putting up a
  May-pole then, and frolicking around it, in a Pixy ring, the young folk of
  Moreton have their frisks among the verdure, without dread of dewy feet, or
  toes stuck in a mole-hill. High up in the tree, which stands in an elbow of
  scraggy street, they hoist, and fix a timber platform, strong enough to bear
  the vehemence of feet, not too aerial. The boughs of the patulous tree, above
  the bole, afford a noble amplitude; and a double ring of hay-rope, roven fast
  around the branches, provides the most headlong couple with a chance of
  preserving their necks, when valuable.</p>

  <p>"Missy, you'm looking crule weist, and peaky," said Master Pugsley to Miss
  Arthur, when he was come with another load of pots, towards the end of April;
  "rackon, that Dicky Touchwood be a' plaguing on 'e. I knows what it be, my
  own sen, Missy; my good Missus, forgive me for the zame! Never could I zee a
  purty wench, when I were young, wi'out longing to make up to her. Excoose of
  me, Missy, if too free of spache. I only tarks what coometh natteral. To my
  rank of laife, and conzeiderin' the difference. And you knows it too, by the
  colour on your chakes."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pugsley, you should mind your own business. Your business is to
  deliver 144 pots, without any cracks in them."</p>

  <p>"Bless 'e, Miss Rose, and I have doed it. They little sniggers is what
  cometh in the baking. Never yet sot I down a deliverance more claner. But you
  was a very little one, when first I knowed you, and growing bigger every
  spare-time, wi'out conzeiderin' of it. Why you used to make nort of kissing
  me, and never ax wuther no pots was cracked! But the chillers grow'th up,
  Miss, by will of the Lord, and doeth, like their veythers, and their moothers
  doed avore them. And it coom across my maind, Miss, by rason of the
  dancing-time, that you was to be warneded of being a young 'ooman now, and no
  moother to look arter 'e. My waife zaith to me, afore prim taime of
  slumbering&mdash;'no moother, Tim, to look arter her; and the cappen no
  better than a hanvil-smiter; her wanteth a light hand; Tim, you do it.'
  Zumtaimes, my waife gooeth wrong about men's business, or consarning of me,
  or even of my datters, when they don't desarve it; but never in her judgment
  of the gentry, Miss."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged, I am sure, to anybody, who wishes to be kind to
  me, and fancies that I want it. But none of you seem to understand, that I
  have nothing to complain of. I have heard enough, of what ladies do, from a
  young lady, who is here, staying in our house; and if nobody wanted pity more
  than I do, the world would be very happy, Mr. Pugsley."</p>

  <p>"Zo 'un be," replied the carrier stoutly. "I zung a zong, all the way from
  Marton, 's marning; and a' can zing a zong, wi' ony of the gallery. But I
  likes to see the young volk a dancing too. The Lard hath made it natteral to
  'un. And when I zeed your little voot, a' comin' from your pettygoat, I said
  to myzell, what a dancer her would make! Do 'e come, and zee our May-dancing,
  that's a dearie."</p>

  <p>"I dare say, your May-dance is very pretty, or at any rate very queer,"
  said Rose; "but it is not a fit place for ladies, I'm afraid. How can you
  keep rough people out?"</p>

  <p>"If any man offendeth, in zider, ale, or langowich," the carrier answered
  austerely; "us kicketh 'un out o' the tree, wi'out no rasoning, and a' cometh
  down zober, on the backside of his head. Never has no call to do it twice,
  Miss. 'Twud do 'e good to zee 'un; and our upstair windy looketh down into
  the thick of it, like a bird's nestie. Wull 'e coom, if Cappen be agrayable
  thereto?"</p>

  <p>Rose laughed at the idea that her father would consent, and cheerfully
  promised to go, if he should do so. Then Master Pugsley, in a bold yet crafty
  manner, made approaches to the captain; and if truth ever did admit ductile,
  or elastic, fibre into the close grain of her heart, the carrier found out
  how to make her, "wi'out telling no lies"&mdash;as he himself
  acknowledged.</p>

  <p>In this way it was settled then, that Mistress Pugsley (who could drive,
  as well as her husband&mdash;and her husband as well, according to some folk,
  whose business it was none of) should come in the Sunday-shay, at one o'clock
  on Monday, and put up the horse (who was to be borrowed, from a man who owed
  a bill of two years' standing) and dine in the kitchen, with Moggy the maid;
  though the captain said no; but Tim Pugsley was firm, that his wife should
  not sit to a red-legged table, and the life he would lead with her
  afterwards. "Her could do up all the chany, and the zilver, like a
  looking-glass;" he said, for fear of having seemed to go against her
  dignity.</p>

  <p>Then, about three o'clock, they were to start, in the Sunday-shay borrowed
  from the White Hart Inn; and so (inasmuch as it would be absurd to spare a
  horse belonging to a man who owed him money) they might get to Moreton very
  well, by half-past four, and show Miss the shops, and the Punch and Judy, and
  wise pig, come from Exeter.</p>

  <p>Nothing can ever hope to be done now, according to its calculation;
  because of the many other things, all equally busy, that come in the way of
  it. But forty years ago, the rush was scarcely half-begun yet; and there
  still was time to live in. Mrs. Pugsley came, with the light shay, and the
  pony, who could properly afford to be thrashed, because his master could not
  pay.</p>

  <p>And Rose, although her mind might be considered rather large, was unable
  to help getting into high spirits, at the little change, and bit of fun, in
  front of her. But another, and a far more important person, was grieved, and
  sore wounded at heart, by such an outbreak.</p>

  <p>"Then, am I to be left to myself all the day, while you go to see the
  chaw-bacons capering?" Dicky Touchwood asked, when he heard of what was
  toward; and his voice was rich with a melancholy sound.</p>

  <p>"You must not be left alone, because you are never any company to
  yourself," his fair attendant answered, in the kindest manner; "but that has
  been provided for, before this was thought of. Miss Perperaps has promised to
  come up, and sit with you, and read you a storybook, until you go to sleep.
  And I am to be home again, by one o'clock to-morrow; you will scarcely even
  know, that I have been away at all. And perhaps, I shall be able to make you
  laugh. I never saw anybody laugh like you. I am only afraid that it is bad
  for you."</p>

  <p>"Do I laugh? Then I am sure I never mean it. It is all Spotty's fault;
  because she never cares for anything. I don't like young ladies of that
  character at all."</p>

  <p>"You must never say that. It sounds ungrateful. If Miss Perperaps had been
  your own sister, she could not have done more for you."</p>

  <p>"That makes it all the worse, and drives me wild. Why should people I
  don't care for, do me all the good that gets done for me; and the really nice
  ones take no notice? And they never seem to know, how it urges me!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Touchwood, it seems to me that you should rather ask, why you don't
  care for the people that are kind to you, and do you all the good, that would
  not get done for you, unless you had them to do it."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I dare say you think me ungrateful. But I am put out, because
  I shall not see you, very likely for two whole days. And the only pleasure I
  get now, is to look at you, Miss Arthur."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye. Your dear mamma will be here at three o'clock; and I hope that
  she will say you are a great deal better. It is most unlucky, that whenever
  she comes, you should happen to fall back so, and be so languid, and
  low-spirited. It makes Lady Touchwood disbelieve the doctor; and she goes
  away, with such a sigh. Even if you feel worse than usual, you should try to
  put a cheerful face on; and especially to-day, when your sister is coming,
  for the first time, to see you. I am sure that you can walk very nicely, if
  you try."</p>

  <p>"You never seem to enter into my case at all," Dicky Touchwood complained,
  as she passed out of hearing; "I don't want to go away. I like the place; I
  like the captain; I like the apple-fritters; and somebody even better still.
  In fact, I like everything, except the medicines. And if they would only
  allow me the right thing in malt, I'll be blest, if I'd ever get well
  again."</p>

  <p>But his lovely young hostess, with all her good nature, was getting rather
  tired of his vapours, and vagaries. Her main delight was to be with her
  father, to help him, and hand him his needs, and be ready with a smile (when
  that was one of them) and be able, at supper-time, to tell him how much he
  had done, if he dared to reproach himself. But ever since this boy tumbled in
  among them, instead of looking after her vines and roses, she must give up
  her time to be looked at by him. And this made her glad, to get away to
  Moreton.</p>

  <p>Timothy Pugsley's "little ouze"&mdash;as he called his most highly
  respectable dwelling&mdash;was as full of deep corners, and heavy
  over-hangings, and loopings, and humpings, and jags, and juttings, as the
  loftiest artist could desire to find, on a tour, or upon a friend's property.
  We take, at the present moment, deep interest in our forefathers; because
  they were so ignorant, in comparison with ourselves; and we doubt their
  <i>differentia</i>&mdash;as it used to be called, and used to be settled,
  before all wisdom went to flux. But if anything can be inferred about them
  (where all is inference, deference none), it seems to be, that they were fond
  of corners. They loved a deep corner; as we love a flat, whether vertical, or
  horizontal; and they liked to see shadow, as much as we hate it.</p>

  <p>The carrier's house went up and down, and in and out, almost as freely as
  his cart did on the roads; and the roof carried fodder enough for a horse, as
  Teddy observed, with a watering mouth. No climbers were wanted, to cluster
  the windows, for the droopers clothed them amply&mdash;creeping Jenny, and
  run-away Jack, and the many forms of house-leek, with golden moss to brighten
  them. No rakes came near them, neither besom of destruction; their only enemy
  was the wind; and that they passed on into the chimney-pots.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you plaize, Miss, this cornder hath been claned for 'e," said
  Master Pugsley to Miss Arthur, after a magnificent tea downstairs. "'Tis the
  very best place in all Marton town, for spyin' of they ranties. And wi'out
  you putts your head var vorth, ne'er a wan of 'em can see 'e. Viddles be
  toonin' up, a'ready. Many is the time, I've a' doed it, with the best of 'em.
  Zumtimes I wush I wor a lad again, and no vam'ly. Don't 'e tell that to my
  Missus, though."</p>

  <p>"I've aheered 'e," said Mrs. Pugsley, panting up the creaky stairs, for
  she was fat exceedingly; "I've aheered 'e, Tim; and I be 'sheamed of 'e. Lor,
  Miss Rose, when my Timmy wor a buy, you could have put your two hands round
  him, what with his chronicles, and his asterisks! Nobody said a' wud ever
  grow up; but a' did; and a' wanteth to do so again, wi'out no waife to do's
  vittles for 'un."</p>

  <p>"You've dooed your own too," said the carrier with a smile. "How well her
  look'th, Miss Rosie, and chakes so bright as you'rn a'most!"</p>

  <p>"By rason I gotten a good man to keep me. Now Missy, shall I stop with
  you, and tell 'e who the vork be; or wad 'e zoonder baide aloun? Tim must be
  off, adoin' of a zaight of things. Nort can be done in this here town, wi'out
  Tim Pugsley."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please to stop with me," said Rose; "I should never know anything
  about it&mdash;and indeed I would not stop, to shut you out from your own
  window. And Sally, and Milly, and Billy, must come. Why, what are they going
  to do already? The sunset is on the church-tower still, and the moon is as
  pale as an oyster-shell; but they mean to begin&mdash;I declare they do!"</p>

  <p>They meant to begin, and more than that, they did begin without delay, and
  with strong intention to go on. For the girls there was a tallat ladder, to
  be mounted, according to their manifold natures; some making a great fuss
  (for fear of falling, without being noticed), some skipping up shyly, before
  any one could think of them, some ascending slowly, with a gaze of large
  unconsciousness; and others smiling, with their skirts tucked in, to prove
  what management can do. The lads, upon the other hand, had too much of their
  own to do, to be over-nice in criticism. Their only way up to the
  dancing-stage, was a half-inch rope, hanging down from a bough, and anointed
  well with mutton-suet. Also, at the landing place, where an active lad might
  stick his heels in, invidious fellows, who had climbed already, and wished to
  keep the platform to themselves, showed a narrow-minded tendency to push away
  any better-looking lad, who was aspiring to the girls. And a combat ensued,
  which was pleasant to behold.</p>

  <p>"They've been, and gotten our best stable lantern!" Mrs. Pugsley cried
  indignantly. "Fie upon Tim, they get over him so! One of them scrapers
  scrapeth with a book. Some saith 'tis larnin', and some saith 'tis
  hignorance. Girt hignorance, to my mind, vor to viddle wi' a copy-book. There
  they gooth&mdash;fust couple right, and turn once! Zim'th no more nor
  yesterday, as I wur doin' of it. Vaive and thirty years agone, miss; and us
  used to cry 'Boney' for the gals to shake to; and if you said it now, they
  would stare, and ax the manin'."</p>

  <p>"But they seem to shake very well, without it, Mrs. Pugsley. How
  wonderfully they go in and out! I never saw anything half so pretty. And how
  beautifully they keep time; though they seem to be laughing, instead of being
  serious! I have seen a ball of very high society at Exeter, just that I might
  know how to understand it, through the cracks of the door, and from the
  cock-loft; but it frightened me sadly to look at them; because they seemed to
  dance one step, and frown two."</p>

  <p>"The karlity knows what is best for 'em, miss"&mdash;Mrs. Pugsley had been
  cook in a very good family, and never meant to sink the
  difference,&mdash;"but our lads, and wenches, if soever they comes crossways,
  with royal authority, and the viddles going twang, and the moon a' shaining
  bright, and a man like Tim, and a 'ooman like me, looking on agin' all
  unpropriety, they sayeth to themselves, and to wan anither&mdash;'us may
  carry on now, and spake the word that cometh upward.' And then they goo'th
  on, for more nor thiccy."</p>

  <p>"Whatever they are thinking of, they look very nice, and they do it very
  well, and their manners are so good! Why, they bow to one another
  continually!"</p>

  <p>"Not they, miss; never a one of them. 'Tis the branches makes them duck
  their heads, for fear of an orkard clout on 'em. Good manners coom'th
  convanient so."</p>

  <p>Whatever their manners were, they enjoyed them, and with nature's help
  looked well. For the large moon began to come loftily into the middle of
  their doings, and to make them clear. The maidens were the first to feel her
  influence, and look at her, and hold their heads up well, and have deep
  imaginations. Then the youths took the temper of the moment from them, and
  found a higher beauty of the distance in their eyes, and upon their lips a
  graver, and a sweeter, turn of smiling.</p>

  <p>Even the fiddlers three, and the piper, worthy to perform before King
  Cole, took a softer stroke of melody, and worked their funny-bones more
  gently. Perched up in the branches, with a rope to keep them to it, and a
  tankard refilled at the end of every tune, they set their heels firmer, and
  bedewed their hands, and nodding to one another, glided sweetly, into a
  plaintive and wistful air, with their pots shining chastely, in the light
  across the churchyard. To the movement of their music, lads and lasses
  circled slowly, well content with measure more sedate, and time for serious
  steps.</p>

  <p>For the moonlight wavered in the play of their vibration, and put a
  selvage to their shadows (where the lamp shone in), and followed in and out
  of pale innumerable buds, and rested upon nothing, but the rugged lines of
  heart-wood, scarred with the jocosities of bygone dancers; whose names were
  wearing out, upon the tombstones down below.</p>

  <p>"Now, Missus Littlejan, you can't get out of it no more," Rose heard
  Carrier Pugsley say to a very pretty woman, who was standing in a doorway.
  "You was the sproylest of the lot, dree years running, and not a maid among
  'em can put a foot out wi' 'e, now times. You be burnin' to be at it, and
  your chakes confesseth. They be arl gooin' on, crule weist, and heavy like. I
  dunno, what hath come across the lads, since I wor one of 'em. Call your good
  man, that's a dear, and goo up the skip to aupway."</p>

  <p>"And I can goo up, as suent as ever," the young matron answered, with a
  longing glance; "in the looment of the laight, they do zim weist. But
  conzeider the babby, Maister Pugsley, conzeider of my husband's babby."</p>

  <p>"Drat the babby; or bless 'un, I shud zay. Our Zally will tend 'un. Zally
  coom peart, and vang Mrs. Littlejan's babby."</p>

  <p>Then Rose saw the brisk little woman go up, and heard a loud hail to her,
  the Queen of former May times; and a merry tune broke forth, and the mood was
  all quick stroke again. Then Pugsley, rejoicing to see a bright success, went
  up the ladder to the dance himself; for he could tread a measure still, with
  heels, in lieu of toeing it. But Sally, who would have to give account of his
  doings to her mother, fastened upon him the whole speculation of her blue
  eyes, and left the infant Littlejohn to the ministry of angels.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that wild horse up the hill?" cried Rose; "he is tossing, and
  straining, and dashing at his reins; I expect to see him break loose every
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Lor, miss, no! Never trouble about he," Mrs. Pugsley answered calmly.
  "'Tis only baker Pollard's young gray nag; he hooketh him up there, twaice a
  day. And he riglar furmiteth about, like that."</p>

  <p>"What is there to stop him, if he breaks loose with the cart? And here
  come those Punch and Judy people, close behind him! Oh, he is loose, he is
  off!"</p>

  <p>Without another word, she too was off, down the crooked staircase, like a
  rabbit through a hole, and out at the front door, which luckily was open. The
  baby of the Littlejohns was in the street before her, making just a little
  crawl, and trying to say "boo," with the mad horse striking fire, in his dash
  down hill upon it, and the wheels behind him flying, like a kettle at a dog's
  tail. Away ran a score of louts sniggering, and yelling; and women justly
  screamed; for death was dashing on the baby.</p>

  <p>With a set heart, and firm bound of all the life within her, Rose Arthur
  stood in the very middle of the narrow roadway, before the poor baby, and
  pulled her white hat off, and threw it at the forehead of the horse, almost
  upon her. Swerving with a wild plunge&mdash;for check himself he could
  not&mdash;he flung the cart high in the air, and flew on, with the reins,
  like a lasso, whirling after him. The loop caught the leg of baby Littlejohn;
  but Rose threw it up; and the tire of the jumping wheel tore off a lock of
  her long scattered hair. With a dash, and a clash, all the peril was gone by,
  and the roar, and the scream, echoed further down the street.</p>

  <p>Rose Arthur lay stunned by the whirr of the wheel, within a single inch of
  her lovely little ear; if the wheel had not leaped, at the plunge of the
  horse, it must have gone over her slim white neck. When she came to herself,
  she was in the strong arms of a young man, who had rushed forth to save her,
  but too late to do more than pick her up, and worship her.</p>

  <p>"She is killed, I do believe, you disgraceful pack of cowards!" he cried
  to the fellows, who came crowding now around. "I never saw anything so grand,
  and so barbarous. Go, and fetch your mothers; it is all that you are fit
  for." There were plenty of brave young men around; but their presence of mind
  had failed them.</p>

  <p>"Thank you; I don't think that I have been hurt," said the maiden in a
  whisper, and looking shyly up at him; "only stupidly frightened. But how is
  the baby?"</p>

  <p>"The baby is laughing in the arms of its mother. But you, who are worth
  ten thousand babies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please to put me down, sir. I am not so giddy now. Oh, here comes Mrs.
  Pugsley! I am most thankful to you, though I cannot tell you properly."</p>

  <p>"You be off, young man!" cried the carrier's wife, for the Westcombes were
  unknown on this side of the moor; "you han't done no harm, and you han't done
  no good. Be off, I tell 'e. Bain't no place for you. Hus be going to examine
  this young leddy." The dismissal was urgent; there was no plea for lingering.
  Everybody seemed to say, "What do you want here? Who are you, to abuse the
  Moreton folk?" With a deep bow, meant for Rose, but received by Mrs. Pugsley,
  in the ample region where she tied her apron strings, he accepted the
  decision of the public, and was off.</p>

  <p>But all excellent intentions must have some luck somewhere; if capable of
  paying for it, and eager so to do. And Pollard, the baker, who was sitting on
  his flour-bin, sadly scoring, with his white material, a loss of more than £3
  10<i>s</i>., from the breakage of shaft, and bolt, and panel, and a spring of
  five leaves, and the gray colt's knee, and a host of little items of the
  ruefullest arithmetic&mdash;he did signal justice to that young man's lofty
  character, without assigning reason.</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Pollard knew the reason; and she kept it close as dough, until
  the brewer's charm begins. The reason was, that young Jack Westcombe, before
  he started for his long night-walk, provided a curl paper for a curl. Or, to
  put it more precisely, he gave a £5 note for the silky tress, which he had
  discovered between the sprung tire, and cracked felloe, of the cart's
  surviving wheel. He might have had it gladly for five shillings; but love
  scorned such an insult.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; "THE RAVEN"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Much has been said well, and written even better, about the
  vast progress of the age, in all things, except honesty, courage, and
  kindliness. These are of small account; when a man runs, his loose ends must
  blow out behind him.</p>

  <p>Everybody said, in Christowell, where the people have always been
  considered very wise, that the Government of the United Kingdom was
  conspiring to rob honest people. When a man got a letter, his first business
  used to be, to pay for it, and then to stick it on his mantel, for a picture;
  until such time, as a great book-scholar should be in need of twopence, for a
  glass of beer. But whoso got a letter for a penny, or a thank'e, was it fair
  to expect him to pay twopence, every time he got it read to him? The opinion
  of Christowell, headed by the landlord (into whose till, every twopence must
  have travelled), was distinctly, and deliberately, this&mdash;that the post
  had no right to deliver letters for a penny, without providing somebody, to
  come and read them <i>gratis.</i></p>

  <p>This matter had scarcely been under discussion, so much as four months,
  when a new upset arose. The cobbler, in every village good enough to have
  one, was regarded by the Government, in all the new arrangements, as the
  first claimant to the postmastership, in right of his professional complicity
  with wax. Hence it will be manifest, that Mr. James Trickey, though curt
  perhaps of graceful courtesy, was strictly correct from an official point of
  view, in his highly suggestive demonstration to Carrier Pugsley, when rooted
  in the rut. No man should ever be condemned, at first sight, whatever part of
  his organization is foremost to woo stern criticism.</p>

  <p>The mind of that postmaster was in a state of unusual tension, and wholly
  indifferent, as the mind in office must be, to any good works beyond its own
  vocation. His appointment was new, and he had to justify it; for the village,
  having done without a post-office for centuries, not only saw no need of it,
  but had a right to be indignant; though the elder folk, having larger
  toleration, said, "Let un coom; her taime wun't be long. 'Tis a get up to
  sell gate-postesses; and nubbody buyeth they, in these here parts."</p>

  <p>Master Trickey knew better, and was proud to do so; and holding himself
  above inquiries, would neither take, nor make them. In refusing to answer, he
  was right, as a man always is, when he knows nothing; but in sternly
  resolving not to ask, he showed perhaps less wisdom. For although he could
  read with some fluency in the Bible, and do the fourteen generations, he
  could not make out the tremendous words, in which the vast era of progress
  began. He was told, in his orders, to "communicate, in anticipation of
  emergency, with the central administration." This puzzled him, for it sounded
  like the Prayer-book, only bigger.</p>

  <p>Now if he had taken this question to his minister (as exhorted to do, in a
  book, whose clear English shall never be surpassed by the very biggest
  writer), his difficulties might have been duly solved, and he must have got
  an order for a pair of fishing-boots; which by reason of his "reticence," was
  quite lost to the parish, and even went as far away as Newton Abbot. For Mr.
  Short made a point of knowing, what his own folk were up to, and a point of
  honour when his letters were concerned; and he never made surer of anything
  in his life, than that such a wiseacre as Jem Trickey would be at his door,
  thrice every day, with something to be explained three times. There scarcely
  could be a more liberal man than the parson, a strict Conservative&mdash;a
  race of men who practise true, and let the others prabble truculent
  philosophy. And now the parson proved all this; for he paid 5<i>s.</i>
  <i>extra,</i> rather than wear a pair of boots, to the profit of such a
  Radical.</p>

  <p>Master Trickey felt these things, and lamented in the bosom of his family.
  In public however, he declared, that such considerations were beneath him,
  that an officer of the Crown must be above small byses, either of leather or
  of learning; and parson's behaviour should have no effect upon him, no more
  than to keep one pew buttoned on a Sunday, and the letters for the vicarage
  to the tail of the delivery. But even before his grievance ripened, or the
  vicar knew that it was growing, this haughty layman bit the dust, at the feet
  of Mother Church, and Father Short.</p>

  <p>For a very remarkable thing happened now, one of those facts which defy
  defiant reason, and set at nought all purest process of induction, deduction,
  or <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> Christowell remembered many things, that
  could not be explained; but these had left off happening lately, so that the
  upstarts grew too bold, and the veterans (rasped of the crust of reason, by
  the roughness of hard life) told one another that the Lord was now
  clock-time, to read they young cockahoops a warning. And a warning now was
  read to them, which made them shake in their moonlit beds, and turned all
  argument into agreement, and stupid young fancy into stubborn faith again.
  For the author of evil, who never can be satisfied even with his own
  exertions, and is famed for "looking over Dartymore," as keenly as over his
  own pet Lincoln, in this crisis of "postal development," came officially, as
  the great father of lies, to look after letters, and robbed the mail.</p>

  <p>Jem Trickey had a son whose name was Bob, a truthful boy (comparatively
  speaking) and one who could be trusted largely, if he were not tempted.
  Neither was that the only thing remarkable about him; for he was also a boy
  that kept his pockets buttoned, and his heels together. He had tight little
  calves, like smart balls of blue worsted, and forks of Nankin&mdash;called in
  high society "breeches"&mdash;which ran up to his middle, when his legs began
  to run. And his legs ran often; for he was a very earnest boy, eager to be
  the very foremost of his age, an example to the other boys&mdash;the which
  they pelted stones at&mdash;to the girls a riddle, and in larger view
  intended for a postman of letters at a penny.</p>

  <p>This boy was fortunate in the possession of a parent, who not only had
  keen perception of his genius, but also the power to make it pay. Under the
  new Act of Parliament, Bob, being early of age at fourteen, was appointed to
  the salary of head-postman, and his father cut him out a pair of cowskin
  gaiters. No other postal district could compare with this, for innocence, and
  charity, and the absence of ill-will; because the population was so scanty.
  Yet even here, there were people found to say, that sometimes it was possible
  to have too much leather.</p>

  <p>Now the weather was fine, and the time of year beginning to be cheerful,
  and abundant, with variety of flowers. Every man, leaning on his shovel in a
  meadow (which is one of the things that he is most inclined to do) was
  pleased, and yet saddened to behold the same things coming up, that used to
  come up a great many years ago, when he was a child, and spent hours with
  them. Ah, the times were better then! He got his victuals, without labouring,
  he ran about, and played, and slept, whenever he was minded; the taste of
  everything was better, and the size much larger, and every year put on his
  life was strength, instead of stiffness. But for all that, if the Lord came
  now, and said, "Will you go back again?"&mdash;he would think no more of
  doing so, than the flowers to shrink back into bud, and be buried in the root
  again.</p>

  <p>Sam Slowbury did not particularly go through that, or any other process of
  mind, as he was leaning on his shovel; for his nature was not to think a
  thought that it could help, any more than to dream a dream&mdash;which he did
  yearly&mdash;or to do a rapid stroke of work, the which he did never. But
  conscience is the guide of duty, as many learned moralists have shown, and
  can show again; and the proof of the pudding is in the after-taste. Sam
  Slowbury's conscience only told him, that he ought to have more wages.
  Captain Larks, who could not afford to give romantic wages, was paying Sam
  now, one and tenpence a day, and Sam did the value of tenpence. He was
  turning up a mixen, in a meadow near the lane, or rather he was helping it to
  turn itself; while Mopsy, the cow, with creative pride looked on, and
  increased in her own self-esteem. Then Slowbury stood more still than ever,
  if possible, while he stroked the cow; and she, like a very faithful
  creature, made no other movement than a kinkle in her tail. Everything was
  pleasant, everything was gracious; there seemed to be a richness of green
  upon the grass, and a delicate blue in the air, and a desire of the weather
  to be kind, and happy. Sam felt it; and it added to his leisure, and
  benevolence, and the way in which he looked about.</p>

  <p>"I dun'now as ever I zeed a vainer marnin' coom out o' the top of the
  sky," he said, with a truth of observation, not often to be found in our most
  accomplished weather-clerks; for if the fine morning comes from the horizon,
  the issue of the day is doubtful. "But who be thiccy coming up by graveyard?
  Jem Cobbler's buy, zure as I be a zinner!" The identity of the boy was the
  most important question, that had occurred since breakfast-time. Sam even
  went a yard or two, up the bank, to get a more masterly view of him, and
  established his shovel in the happiest attitude, for support and comfort. But
  so persistent is human care, and so vast the activity of the human mind, that
  no sooner was it settled beyond dispute, that the figure approaching was the
  cobbler's son, than another question, even more absorbing, rose
  defiantly&mdash;Whatever could be compelling this scion of leather, to wear
  out his paternal boots, like that?</p>

  <p>For Slowbury could not see, although he used his eyes with diligence, the
  thing the boy had in his hand, and largely in his head as well. It was one of
  the new "Mulready envelopes," just come down from London; and the head of the
  boy was unsound about it; because he had never seen the likes before; and now
  he had got five-and-twenty of them, mainly for people who could not read.
  "Deliver fust to they as can intarpret," his father, who was nearly mazed at
  the size of the bags, gave orders; "'tothers may baide up to next
  church-time. Goo with Cappen's fust; them as payeth for their boots desarveth
  fust shoeleather."</p>

  <p>Slowbury stood, and watched the progress of this boy with pleasure. But
  presently he beheld a thing, which made him throw his shovel down, and sit,
  and bless the angels, who alone can fend the pixies. From the corner of the
  churchyard, where the tombs lay thickest, a tall figure, flaring in the sun,
  leaped forth, with a wonderful explosion, and a cloud of pitchy smoke. Sam
  was ready to swear that he was not mistaken, in seeing nothing more for at
  least five minutes, and then if it was anything to bear an affidavit, it was
  the chap from the gravestones jumping, out of the cloud, to the top of the
  church-tower. And sure enough, when seven unmarried men were sent to the top
  of the church-tower, they found a place where the moss had been knocked off,
  and they came down according to their speed, declining (as soon as their
  breath was restored to them) to go up any more, unless they were strung up to
  the bell-beams. This proved every syllable, that came from the mouth of
  Slowbury; out of which came very little (as soon as he knew what he was
  about) without a great deal of very solid, and highly liquid substance going
  in, at the sole charge of the inquirer.</p>

  <p>There is no justice to be traced, in the affairs of men or boys, without
  dreadful ingenuity. What had Sam done, to make a pocket out of this affair,
  more than lean on his shovel, and arouse himself to look a bit, and regard
  with satisfaction the distance of the miracle? Even when the cloud passed
  off, and the church was as bright as she ought to be, this man discovered
  that his duty to his master strictly forbade him to approach what he had
  witnessed. He retreated to another mixen, nearer to the house, where a man at
  work might hear the wholesome cocks a-crowing, and the thumping of the churn
  at dairy. And he took Mopsy with him, for company, because his heart was in
  the frimitts.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the real hero of this strange adventure not only sucked
  no profit thereout, and no increase of character, but received knotted strap
  from his father, and was threatened of his life, if he told a word of it. And
  so do the greatest events get deformed, (when chance has protected them from
  smothering), that only two people in Christowell&mdash;the postmaster, and
  his gaitered son, could find any motive for that outbreak of the Evil One,
  except the sad nature of his constitution.</p>

  <p>But the nature of the human creature always has some spotty places, where
  the good light enters. Black Wenlow was glad, that his out-rush from the
  tombs, and shower of fireworks of his own construction, scared the poor boy
  so, that no blow was needed; as he fell on his back and cast away the letter;
  for feeling is swifter than thought, and Bob felt that these wicked
  inventions brought Satan upon him. Then the sheep-skinned villain vanished,
  not over the tower, but into a cross cut which led him to the moor.</p>

  <p>There is a house, or at any rate was then, far away, among the hills, and
  hollows, from any other place, where people dwell. How anybody came to dwell
  there, none but those, who knew the ins and outs of mining on the waste, can
  pretend to say, if even they can do it. But there this miserable building
  stood; and a man, who was no more miserable than his fellow-men, had his home
  there. The savage wilderness, iron-browed hills, and rocks of peaky profile,
  like a row of hideous giants, were more to the taste of Gruff Howell, than
  the sweetest landscape, and the kindest sun. To take the rough and the smooth
  together, is a test of magnanimity; but Howell took the rough, without the
  smooth, in fare and footing, in climate and in clothes, and in company,
  whenever he got any to enjoy.</p>

  <p>It was said, by the gentler folk afar, that he deserved no better; himself
  not being fit company for a Christian; and if he had his due, he would be
  swinging now in chains, as a pirate, on the hill of landscape looking over
  Plymouth Sound. But instead of that, he kept the <i>Raven,</i> by the side of
  a mine-road long disused; and no idle rumour disturbed him there; for his
  customers were the moor-men only, a silent, hard-living, and wandering race.
  But even they asked one another, sometimes, about the queer couple, Griffith
  Howell, and his wife.</p>

  <p>The house had been built by the miners of old, and therefore was
  substantial, and well-squared. For some granite masonry, as fair as need be
  wished for&mdash;including the tower of Christowell church, which they built
  in wholesome gratitude for a great success&mdash;has been done around the
  moor, and upon it, by the miners. And they must have been sturdy fellows, to
  have reared the <i>Raven,</i> without being blown out of the windows.</p>

  <p>For here are strong concourse, and mighty deliverance, of every wind that
  sweeps the sea, buffets the land, or scours the sky. It is a hollow of the
  hill-crest well contrived, as the chimneys of new houses are, to suck down
  the gust that is wandering overhead, as well as to catch up the rollicking
  blast that follows the floor of the country. Not a tree, nor a shrub,
  scarcely even a furze-mote, or a stub of dead ground-oak, varies with a
  looser twang the perpetually tense wail of the wind on granite&mdash;a tone
  too dismal, and too dreary, for echo, or description.</p>

  <p>Gruff Howell was sleeping, like a lawyer's conscience, richly, and without
  prejudice. He never went to bed much, but achieved his rest, like a warrior
  on a tomb, with his clothes on.</p>

  <p>To-night, the wind was scarcely even keeping itself in practice; and the
  moon was having an unusual turn of insight into the <i>Raven.</i> All around
  the hills were silent; and the long pale shadows lay, like flaws of calm on
  tidal waters; while the "holy circles," where unholy deeds had stained the
  moor, stood up, like ghosts that have no churchyard. Only the solemn bird,
  that watches the dim night for a century, and times its slow watches with a
  croak, was moving, uneasily. moving his long gaunt body, with the platform of
  his frayed nest waiting in the crag, for him to mend.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the poor old mastiff-bitch, who wandered round the house at
  night, gave three sharp yelps, and made a spring; but receiving a blow on the
  nose fell back, and in that position became qualified to digest a kick in the
  stomach. Then a storm of thumps broke upon the hob-nailed door, and a mighty
  noise rang through the house; till the master looked out of the window, with
  an oath, and pointed a long gun at his own porch. "Come down," said a stern
  voice; and down he went, while his wife shivered worse than at fifty
  burglars.</p>

  <p>Old Griffith Howell now was longing, as his wife sincerely hoped, to turn
  a new leaf of his life, to cast away the works of darkness, brew his own
  beer, and give no credit. For since the penny-post came in, the heavens had
  blessed him with a great surprise. He had heard of his only son, a soldier,
  long astray in foreign parts, and long despaired of in home quarters; and
  without falling under proper average of reason, he placed such a piece of
  news entirely to the credit of the penny-post. And this made him pay
  attention now to the doings of his visitor.</p>

  <p>"The candle is enough. Rake the fire together, and put a block of dry peat
  on. Go for the loaf, and the streaky bacon, and the sharp knife with the heel
  to it. Very well. This packet is for me, with urgency? Leave me to consider
  it, while you see to the victualling. Don't draw the ale, till I tell you,
  mind. When my supper is ready, you may go to bed again."</p>

  <p>With these words, the man of the sheepskins, looking thoroughly weary, sat
  heavily down at the oaken board set up for a table; with a jerk of his thumb,
  he broke the seal of the letter, which Howell had given him, and read it by
  the grimy yellow light. And though he was glad to find little to do, his
  nasty temper made him grumble at it.</p>

  <p>"Child's work&mdash;mere child's work&mdash;an insult to me," he muttered,
  while Howell went fumbling about; "even the forgery all done to hand, and
  directions, as if I were a stupid errand-boy. 'Put this slip in with the
  opened letter, seal with the seal enclosed, and post it, but not at
  Christowell, to-morrow.' Very good; very well; it shall be done, sir; as the
  fates have made you my master for the present; though you don't catch me
  going near a post-office. No sham civilization for me. I have taken to the
  moor, and mean to stick to it."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; ON THE BRINK, AND OVER IT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ignorant of all plots against him, and even of any occasion
  for them, Captain Larks was proceeding steadily, with the garden-labours of
  the year. For May is a month of urgent call, and claim, from every rooted
  being, whether from under the blurred and mottled sky, which man spreads over
  them, or from beneath the clearer blue of nature's glazing only. This is the
  time, to rise right early, to breathe crisp air, and tread fresh earth, and
  do brisk work, that shall brighten up the heart, with beauty, and with goodly
  relish, in the by-and-by of resting.</p>

  <p>Shall we be content, to maunder, and to let the right hand flag, among the
  many works that claim it, for no better reason than some trivial flout within
  ourselves? Somebody has run down our work; some boy has thrown a stone, and
  sped away rejoicing; some jealous brother of the spade declares, that we are
  but a tinkling cymbal; worst of all, some foe has darkly re-assessed us, when
  we paid three times too much already&mdash;yet all these woes, though a
  single day inflict them, shall not stay the true hand, one half-hour.</p>

  <p>"I find it like this," said Captain Larks, as he set his heel firmly on a
  leather-coated grub, "that if I begin to think, think I may, and be nowhere
  at all, but only grow 'weist,' as they call it about here, instead of growing
  wise. But if I begin to work, there I am; something to show, and something to
  grow; and a thankful heart, and a peaceful spirit. Now for the last, and the
  maddest of my crazes, according to some of the wiseacres; though in bare
  fact, a great success already."</p>

  <p>Has there ever been a craze, that was not a great success, in the opinion
  of the crazy one? Not that the captain deserved to be so called, by reason of
  his present crotchet; for verily there was good sense in it, as well as small
  risk, and much beautiful amusement. What he wanted to establish, was an
  English vineyard; the which used to flourish many centuries ago, and is to be
  heard of, every now and then, as flourishing here and there, down to the
  present time; with taste, skill, and money, and good luck, to help it.</p>

  <p>Bacchus loves the hills, as the ancient writers tell us; and yet he
  detests rough mountain winds. Let a nook he found for him, with crag enough
  to shelter, and sun enough to warm his graceful curls, and soil enough to
  feed his juicy growth; then let human skill nurse him daily, human force
  scatter his countless foes, and Fortune and Providence alike smile on
  him&mdash;and in a fine season, there may be some sour grapes.</p>

  <p>Here, beneath the rough crest of the moor, the home and shelter had been
  found, the nurture of light shelf-land, and reflected warmth of sun, whenever
  he came out. However there had been no grapes as yet; but nothing could be
  simpler than the reason&mdash;they were not going to begin too soon.
  "Everybody knows," said Mr. Arthur, "what is the consequence of allowing the
  vine to fruit prematurely. Eager young people, like my daughter Rose, may
  long to see a dozen bunches upon every vine, before the stem is thicker than
  a knitting needle. But that is not my system, sir."</p>

  <p>The third season's growth was now beginning; and the sight was very pretty
  to a gardening mind. For a nook of cliff, perpendicular above, and shelfing
  at the bottom, had been well fenced off, so as to help the native curtain of
  the rock, in fending the summer gale; and also to shut out wandering pigs,
  and gormandizing cows, and the graceless sheep, without even a horn to drag
  him to the altar by. And now, in the shelter of their sloping nest, more than
  three hundred maiden vines were peeping at the prospect of the sky. Whether
  should they come out of bud, throw forth another joint of growth, with a heel
  of leaf to stand upon, and a comb (like the fringes of a moth) to go on with;
  or whether should they abide a wee bit longer, within the golden eider of
  their mantles; and thus reserved give the sun to understand, that his meaning
  was kind and cordially welcome, but not yet established against white frost.
  Some did the one thing, and some did the other; according to the impetuosity
  of sap.</p>

  <p>What a pleasure it is, to see a man look happy! Partly, no doubt, because
  that pleasure is so rare. But now Captain Larks, with his leathern apron on,
  and leather behind him for to sit upon, and a great many pockets full of
  everything he wanted, sat down among his vines, and did look happy. For these
  came along the ground, not ramping upward, neither flabbing downward with a
  dissolute redundancy; but curt, and vigorous, and robust, with every joint as
  ripe as a boiled ox-tail. Like the fingers of a star, they were spread above
  the earth, led horizontally to catch ground heat, at a height of about nine
  inches; and a man might sit upon the ground among them, and lift his head, as
  in an orchestra of fiddling, and thank the Lord, who made him, for the better
  music here.</p>

  <p>"Father, I tell you, once more, that you are too bad, when you get into
  this dreadful corner," young Rose almost shouted out; so jealous was she of
  this little vineyard, in which she was not allowed to work as yet, because
  she did not understand it; "and I assure you, without exaggeration, that I
  must have been half an hour looking for you; and here you are, just as if
  nobody ever had serious business to attend to!"</p>

  <p>"Well, let us have the serious business. I see a great deal too serious
  here." The captain had found five snails stuck together, looking into one
  another's windows, as they will.</p>

  <p>"I intend to come up; though I dare say you don't want me," cried Rose, as
  she gathered in her skirts, and stepped lightly; "there now, I have not even
  frightened a bud. You will have to call me in, to help you soon, jealous as
  you are, dear father. Now my news is, that a gentleman is come, who wants
  leave to fish in our little stream, so please you."</p>

  <p>"I can't attend to him now; and I can't have him flogging away, through my
  pear-trees. Don't you see, that I have got nearly thirty bushels of old tan,
  to spread along the ground, before these vines are one day older? And all to
  do myself&mdash;every bit of it, myself. I can't have clumsy fingers here.
  Tell him to go, and fish some other river."</p>

  <p>"That would be a nice thing for me to say, papa, to a gentleman who caught
  me up, when the horse knocked me down so, at Moreton."</p>

  <p>"Rose, sometimes you are quite as provoking, as a full-grown married
  woman. Was I to know, by instinct, who this man is? If he has been kind to
  you, he may fish for ever. Tell him so, with my compliments; and say that
  when he has done, I shall hope to see, and thank him. But fishermen never
  want to be disturbed."</p>

  <p>"Like certain other people, who are too busy to be mentioned. This
  gentleman's name is</p>

  <p>'Washton,' I believe; and he wants some trout for a sick lady. If it were
  not for that, he never would have taken the liberty of asking leave."</p>

  <p>"Fishermen always want fish for sick ladies. And they mainly take the
  liberty, of not asking leave. However, let him fish, to his heart's content,
  if he doesn't hook my pear-trees. I dare say, he doesn't know a trout from a
  Forelle."</p>

  <p>"If he gets a good catch, you shall have a dish for supper. I shall watch
  him in the distance; I love to watch a fisherman; his looks are solid
  wisdom."</p>

  <p>"Short is the only man, who can make head, or tail, of the fish in this
  water; but let Mr. Washton try his hand, my darling. A very sick lady could
  eat more than he will catch to-day."</p>

  <p>"He looks as if he could fish well," said Rose, hastening with bright
  cheeks, and brilliant eyes&mdash;for she still was a child when
  excited&mdash;to authorize, and behold the sport, if any.</p>

  <p>"Don't rob him of his fish, you greedy little creature," her father
  shouted after her, down the vineyard hollow; "let the sick lady have every
  one he catches."</p>

  <p>Rose kissed her hand, to show that she would be obedient; and then at a
  very nimble pace set off, with her slender form glancing in and out of tender
  foliage, towards the bottom of the meadow, sacred to the good cow
  "Mopsy."</p>

  <p>For here it was, that she had been at work, and singing pleasantly,
  weaving a disc of primrose-buds, with purple shade of violets, when a
  fishing-rod came through the hedge, and a hat full of amazement after it.
  "You have made a mistake," said Rose, looking as calmly as Mopsy at him,
  "this is my father's property. We are very particular about our fences."</p>

  <p>The ingenuous youth betrayed much confusion, or at any rate tried to do
  so; and tried very cleverly, with the stern truth against him&mdash;that he
  knew all these things, and now was here, in virtue of that knowledge.</p>

  <p>"How stupid I am! I beg a thousand pardons," he answered with profound
  humility; "but I thought these moorland streams were free. But I see that
  there is a most lovely place here&mdash;a gentleman's private residence.
  Forgive me; I was thinking of a lady who is ill; and I wanted a few trout so
  sadly."</p>

  <p>"Don't go away, you shall have them," said Rose; "if I can find my father;
  and if you can catch them."</p>

  <p>With admirable patience, he had waited, gazing into the desired land, and
  envying the Christow at leisure straying through it, the cow, that could come
  up, and breathe on Rose's shoulder, and even the grass, that such a blessed
  cow made milk of. For verily, this young man was stricken with a great and
  lifelong blow, from simply opening his arms, and finding a maiden there, in
  the street of Moreton. No mere flash of fancy, or dazzle of sight, or sparkle
  of admiration, but a deep and high power of a larger existence than his own,
  and a rapture of ennoblement. For a week, he had seemed to be walking in a
  dream, and his tongue had turned white, though he used it very sparingly.
  There was no cure for him, but a hair of the dog&mdash;but out upon such low
  metaphors!</p>

  <p>Now, as he sat upon the bank, outside of his Paradise, pretending to be
  busy with his fly-book, he espied, through a neat little peep-hole of twigs,
  the maiden of his heart coming back to him. And being at such a respectful
  distance, he was not afraid to watch her; which the bashfulness of love
  prevented him from doing at close quarters. Surely, there never was till now
  a form so graceful, a walk of such sweetly flowing elegance, a poise of the
  head so delicate and maidenly&mdash;ah, now she was coming, and he could not
  look! He would wait for the heavenly music of her voice.</p>

  <p>"Plaise, sir, be 'e the young man, as wor axing lave, vor to vish in this
  here watter?"</p>

  <p>The capricious Rose had stopped at home, and sent Moggy to represent her.
  Jack Westcombe was so vexed, that he scarcely cared to answer, but jumped up,
  and stared at Moggy, with cheeks even redder than her own.</p>

  <p>"'Cos if 'e be," said Moggy, "Cappen zeth 'e be kindly welcome. And a'
  will come and look arter 'e, for fraid of 'e kitching of our vroot
  plantesses."</p>

  <p>This little addition was of Moggy's own invention; for she said to
  herself&mdash;"Where be the young chap's manners? A' standeth there like a
  stuck pig, as if I wor a Bartlemy!" Then off she walked, with a sharp toss of
  her head, and a strong impress of heels upon the soft grass of the meadow.
  She considered herself a very pretty girl; and she liked other people to
  agree with her.</p>

  <p>Westcombe's mind was as reasonable perhaps, as any mind can hope to be, at
  the age of three-and-twenty; and he might have been sure, that no gentleman
  would have sent him that rude message. At first however, he turned round in
  dudgeon, and began to take the fly-collar off his fishing-line; and if there
  had not been a hitch about this, his life might have hung upon a very
  different loop. But when a man is in a hurry, (and for certain, if his hurry
  be knotted with wrath,) every little thing that can converge to a confluence
  of tangles, rushes into every kind of complication, with a subtlety that
  proves the multiplicity of the devil.</p>

  <p>Now many young fellows would have gnashed their teeth, pulled out a
  seven-bladed knife, and slashed away. But Jack was gifted with a turn of
  obstinacy, equal to any ingenuity of gut; and instead of growing pettish, he
  became more calm, while he worked with his fingers expediently. Presently,
  this patience and consideration spread from his fingers to his mind, through
  that sympathy between them, which compels the mind to clench the fingers,
  when it waxes wrathful. And thus he began to see the folly, and the
  littleness of taking offence, where none is offered.</p>

  <p>"The captain is fond of his little joke, perhaps," he said to himself,
  taking up his rod again; "and probably he agrees with Dr. Johnson, in the
  greatest mistake of that great bear. Never mind, I shall go on, and take my
  chance. Possibly, I may see somebody again; or at any rate, I may think of
  her."</p>

  <p>It happened to be both the hour, and the day, when fish with one accord
  begin to feed. The eldest, truest, and deepest chip of the ancient block of
  Zebedee (who is pretty sure, even in these tumble-down times, to be of
  Apostolical succession), however shrewd his study of the loaves, and fishes,
  cannot predict when the fish will want their loaf, but is ready to present
  them with the hook, upon demand. The water is the same, and the weather has
  not changed; to the keenest human eye and sense, there is no sign of
  difference; yet certain it is, that for hours together, no trout will even
  look at the very finest fare; and then all of a sudden, as if the dinner-bell
  rang, off scampers every trout to his private napkin-ring, wags his tail, and
  fans his fins, and goes up and down, like a Corporation saying grace.</p>

  <p>Westcombe was not at all a mighty dab at angling. That noble absorption of
  all conscious existence, upon the behaviour of a small cock's hackle, that
  absolute devotion of entire brain, and heart, to the humours of a slippery
  speckle, just beginning to outgrow a tadpole&mdash;those high and wondrous
  powers of nature, which turn a man into a fisherman, had not been vouchsafed
  to this young fellow. However, he could throw a fly very neatly, and pull out
  a fish, when the hook stuck in him; and elated with unusual success, he
  worked away, to surpass all previous record. And at least a score of trout
  were considering, with gasps, the texture of a Plymouth basket, by the time
  that he came to the captain's drawbridge, and doubted about going higher up
  the stream. For here were flower-beds, and pretty walks of gravel, and pet
  places looked upon by modest cottage-windows.</p>

  <p>Fearing to trespass upon favour, he turned at this point, and began
  considering. Beyond doubt, a dish of fish was due to the good owner, together
  with the decency of thanks for his permission. And yet it would be an awkward
  thing, to march up to the door, knock, and introduce himself, and seem to
  want to disturb the captain in his well-known retirement. So he thought, that
  he would fish his way back again down stream and find perhaps some workman,
  or some messenger to send. He forgot that the weather, which makes trout feed
  (unaccountably, as aforesaid) has a thoroughly national, and rational effect,
  upon the British workman, despatching him, without delay, to the happy realms
  of slumber. The only failure of accord between them, was that Sam Slowbury
  felt the weather, even more promptly than the trout, and had his mouth wide
  open for the flies, five minutes before theirs were ready. At a corner of the
  brook, about an hour ago, the fisherman either heard, or seemed to hear, a
  very loud sound in the distance of the land, regular, and to some extent
  harmonious; which he took for the roaring of a bull upon the moor.</p>

  <p>"At it again! It is really too bad," suddenly Jack Westcombe heard a
  lively voice pronouncing; "an hour and a half, is his allowance after dinner;
  and now he must have been four hours at it, solidly; not to mention all his
  little dozes on his shovel. Rose, if you insist upon my keeping such a
  fellow, I shall call upon you to pay his wages."</p>

  <p>"But think of all the very small Slowburies, papa. And if he is not very
  quick, remember, how thoroughly good-natured, and quiet he is."</p>

  <p>"Quiet indeed! Do you call that quiet? I call it the very loudest snore I
  ever heard. And here is the gentleman fishing. I was coming to look for you,
  and thank you, Mr. Washton, for your kindness to my dear child the other day.
  Don't think me ungrateful for having been so long. I expected to have seen
  you further up, long since; and being very busy, I forgot how time goes by.
  You might have filled your basket, up the brook, by this time. I heard the
  trout leaping there continually."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, I have done quite as well as I could wish. I fear that you
  will think me very greedy, when you see them. I am sure, I am very much
  obliged to you, sir. May I go to your door, and leave a few with the servant?
  I have had famous sport, much more than enough for my dear mother, and all of
  us."</p>

  <p>With these words Jack Westcombe leaped up the bank, as gracefully as stiff
  legs could do it&mdash;for the sake of Rose&mdash;and with a brave bow, but a
  very timid glance at her, spread the contents of his basket at her feet.
  There was not a fish of more than half a pound among them; but still they
  made a handsome show, by reason of their number.</p>

  <p>"Many of the poor things are alive," cried Rose; "surely you don't let
  them die so slowly? I suppose it is their nature to be caught; but
  still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nine fishermen out of ten do it," said the captain; for he saw that his
  visitor was troubled, and surprised; "but a touch in the right place saves
  them pain; and what is more important from the human point of view, they are
  crisper in the pan from the happy despatch. But they are a pretty lot. You
  must be a skilful angler. Our trout are very hard to catch, I know. A friend
  of mine says, that they are like the ladies. Sometimes they won't look at
  you; and then again&mdash;but never mind. He is an ancient bachelor."</p>

  <p>Westcombe stole a clever glance at Miss Arthur, to ask what her opinion
  was upon this question; but being a diffident young maiden, she looked down,
  and began to count the trout sedately. Just at the moment, when she was doing
  this, opening and closing her rosy lips, like a school-girl doing arithmetic,
  and jogging one finger at every little fish, the westerly sun, gliding out
  from a cloud, glanced over the dance of the water, and through a tissue of
  young leaves upon her. The sweetness and innocence of her face were lit up,
  like an opening rose; every delicate line, and soft clear colour of the
  perfect oval, was enlivened with thoughtful pleasure, kind will, and the
  bloom of faith in everything; while the power of loving, as none but women
  can love, waited in the clear depth of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now don't be greedy, Rose, my dear," Mr. Arthur said, with a truly
  parental, and prosaic turn of thought, which set young Westcombe's teeth on
  edge, for his rapturous gaze had sealed his fate; "not one of those fish
  shall you have for supper, though you long to exhibit your frying powers. We
  thank you heartily, Mr. Washton; but we can always have them when we like.
  Pack them all again, in your basket. Rose, there are many things for you to
  do. This gentleman will excuse you."</p>

  <p>In a moment, the light of the world was gone, with a curtsy, from Jack
  Westcombe's eyes; and he began to put his poor fish away, with a very gloomy
  air.</p>

  <p>"You must not think," said the captain, observing his manner with
  surprise, "that I am ungrateful; but I wish you to have a good dish; and as I
  said, we can always get them. From the freshness of the water, the Christow
  trout are as good on the third day as on the first; or better, according to a
  friend of mine. You are welcome to fish here, whenever you like. Will you
  come up to the cottage, and taste my cider? We have a very decent ham in
  cut."</p>

  <p>"The thought is very kind. But I have far to go; and the moon will not be
  up till late to-night. I will thank you once more, and say 'good-bye.'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur, by this time, was so ingrained to the pleasures of a lonely
  life (which are the most trustworthy) that he was generally glad to say,
  "good-bye." But the young man lingered, and looked at him; and observing him
  now for the first time closely, the elder took a liking to him. In spite of
  wide philosophy, and vast philanthropy, most of us like, or dislike, at first
  touch.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you one thing," said young Westcombe, blushing deeply, and
  with the full sense of it, looking firmly at the man he spoke to; "it was not
  the fishing, that I came for. I came in the hope of seeing Miss Arthur.
  Because&mdash;because I never yet saw anybody like her. You have been kind to
  me; and I should be a sneak, if I did not tell you."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the captain; "do you mean my Rose?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the young lady, who has been here with us. The only young lady in
  the whole world to me. The one who sprang out, into the middle of the road,
  before a mad horse, to save a baby, without a single thought of her own dear
  life. And by the most wonderful presence of mind, she saved the baby; but the
  Lord alone saved her. You look, as if I were exaggerating."</p>

  <p>"Her account of the matter was entirely different." Mr. Arthur spoke
  coldly; but the quick warmth of pride in his daughter flushed his cheeks and
  brow.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was. She made it out to be nothing. Her nature would compel
  her to do that," Westcombe exclaimed, as if he knew the maiden, ten times
  better than her father did; "my dear sir, I saw the whole of it, although I
  was too far off to stop it; and I tell you there never was a grander thing
  done, by any one so young, and so beautiful."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely see how that last point bears upon the merits of the exploit,"
  Mr. Arthur answered, with a little of the bluntness, which always comes of
  solitude; "however, I am glad to hear, that my daughter did her duty."</p>

  <p>"It was not her duty. It is no one's duty, to risk a precious life in that
  way. I beg your pardon, for going on about it. The difference is, that I saw
  it, and you hear of it. And because there was no fuss made about it, you
  think that I exaggerate."</p>

  <p>"I think nothing of the kind. I know the nature of my child. And I thank
  you, sir, for valuing it. Also I thank you, for your manly truth, and
  honesty, in telling me what has brought you here. But I grieve to
  say&mdash;because I like you, and you remind me of a dear old
  friend&mdash;that you must not come here any more."</p>

  <p>"I hope, sir,&mdash;I beg of you," the young man answered, noticing the
  kind, but resolute, look of the elder, with a wistful glance, "not to think
  ill of me, because I came this morning under false pretences. I never did
  anything like that before; and now that I think of it, I am quite ashamed. I
  tried to do without it, and really fought against it. But ever since that day
  at Moreton, I have not been like myself."</p>

  <p>"I forgive you most freely for that little crime," Mr. Arthur replied with
  a hearty smile: "it was nothing but a young man's trick. Another thought
  would have put a stop to it."</p>

  <p>"Then why am I to come no more? I will pledge my honour, to do nothing
  underhanded. I tell you the truth. I shall never care for any one in all the
  world, except your daughter. It will make no difference in my feelings, if I
  have to wait fifty years for her. At the same time, I beg to state, that I
  hope to get her sooner; but without attempting anything outside your
  knowledge. I know well enough, that I am not to be compared with her, in any
  of the higher attributes. And I know her too well, to suppose that she would
  think twice of any of the lower ones. But for all that, I am not going to be
  discouraged. My father never meant a thing, without going through with it.
  And I am as like him as two peas; though not to be compared with him, for
  goodness."</p>

  <p>"Your father must have been a peculiar gentleman, if you resemble him in
  character."</p>

  <p>"My father is living, sir, and not at all peculiar. Unless it is peculiar,
  to be brave and upright, generally admired, and universally beloved. He is
  not known yet, upon this side of Dartmoor; but everybody knows him in the
  western parts; and his name will last for ever, in the history of the war.
  You may have heard of Colonel Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"What a wooden brain I have!" thought Mr. Arthur, sitting down, to hide a
  change of countenance; "so much stooping dims perception. He is the very
  image of his father, though taller, and stronger, and better looking. Once
  and for all, it must be stopped."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Jack was looking brightly at him, and saying to his hopeful
  heart&mdash;"Come now! I put it very mildly; but it must tell for
  something."</p>

  <p>"My daughter told me that your name was 'Washton;' and she very seldom
  makes mistakes." Mr. Arthur went into this side-issue, partly perhaps to get
  time for thinking.</p>

  <p>"The Moreton people, when they found my name out," Jack replied, with a
  quiet smile, "made 'Wasshcum' of it, with a sharp a, as in 'cash,' according
  to their manner of pronouncing. And so, I dare say, it got into 'Washton.' We
  seem to speak better, upon our side of the moor. You should come over, and
  hear us, sir."</p>

  <p>"I fear there is no chance of it. You are a very young man; and I shall
  very soon be an old one. It would grieve me that your father's son, or indeed
  that any gentleman, should have reason to believe me churlish. I will tell
  you, if you will promise to keep what I tell you in strict confidence, even
  from your father, why you must never come here more."</p>

  <p>"I will give you my honour, sir, not to speak of it to any one."</p>

  <p>"Thank you; I know that I can trust you. The reason is simply this. Very
  strange circumstances, which I must not enter into, have made it the first
  duty of my life, to obliterate myself entirely&mdash;to conceal my
  existence&mdash;to desire to be dead, except for one pure precious sake.
  While I live in this way, my child must do the same. Not that I shall
  sacrifice her better life to mine. If she gives her heart to any one, and he
  is worthy of her, they shall not find me an obstacle. But as yet, she is too
  young to judge, or even think of it. And I have a right to keep her to
  myself, and to live as the story of my life demands; until my child's welfare
  compels me to do otherwise. I see that you clearly understand me."</p>

  <p>"I am trying to do so," the young man answered, with a very dismal gaze at
  him; "and I am sure, that I am very much obliged to you, for trying to
  explain it. But I cannot see, why I should be forbidden to come any more, if
  I do no harm, and do not even see the young lady. It seems very hard, as you
  must acknowledge. Even to see the house where she lives, and to get a glimpse
  of your hat, without coming near you, would be the greatest comfort to me,
  and give me some idea of kindness. I am sure, that you have known my father,
  sir, from the manner of your eyes just now; and I never yet met anybody, who
  had known him, without liking him."</p>

  <p>"You are right, my lad, I have known your father well," Mr. Arthur
  answered warmly; "and a nobler man I never knew; and that is why I trust you.
  The greatest mistake in the world is, to allow, when once the mind is made
  up, a middle course. And I will have nothing of that sort now. But if it will
  do you any good, or ease your mind, to be upon my premises now and then, for
  the purpose of catching a fish or two, I am not sure that I should prosecute
  you. Only, of course, you must confine yourself strictly to your angling; and
  only come just now and then, at considerable intervals; and feel yourself
  entirely on your honour, when you do come."</p>

  <p>"I thank you with all my heart, and I will observe your conditions
  strictly. I shall make a point of never coming more than once a week, and of
  never intruding on your pleasure-grounds. And if I ever send a few fish to
  the house, it shall be quite anonymous, and by the man that snores so. You
  have taken a great weight off my mind; and I tell you fairly, that I mean to
  hope; but nothing whatever shall be done, I mean, of course, upon your own
  place, without your entire knowledge." Jack Westcombe tried to wring the
  captain's hand, but got rather the worst of that; for of all things potting
  is most hardening.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; WET, AND DRY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Like every other ancient faith, the angler's firm belief,
  that fish refuse all food with rain impending, has now been scattered to the
  wind and clouds. The opinion of many ages was, that having by instinct surer
  knowledge, than all mankind by science get, of the things that shall occur
  to-morrow, these finny sages fear to spoil their relish for the coming treat
  of worms, and slugs, and grubs, more luscious than the fattest "native," to
  unvitiated taste. All these will fall into their mouths to-morrow; let them
  fast, to keep the feast.</p>

  <p>It is now denied by men of science&mdash;scornful of all reasoning beyond
  their own&mdash;that a trout surpasses them so immensely, in the science of
  meteorology; of which they are bound to confess that they know nothing. And
  feeling some reasonable doubt of that denial, they add the insidious remark
  (engendered by their own "inner consciousness") that even if the fish knew
  what was coming, they would never keep their mouths shut, by reason of their
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>Be that as it will, one thing is certain, the liberal rise of the Christow
  fish to the hook of Jack Westcombe did not preclude a heavy rain from setting
  in, next morning. Whoever has the pleasure of an intimate
  acquaintance&mdash;and in such a case there truly is no superficial
  knowledge&mdash;with a genuine hearty Dartmoor rain, will be ready to admit,
  that it has some meaning. Its main point of difference from most other rains
  is, that it combines all their bad qualities, and omits their good ones.
  However, to abuse it, only makes it rain the harder.</p>

  <p>To prove that he was "game," and to celebrate becomingly his "most
  Providential restoration,"&mdash;as Lady Touchwood called it&mdash;young
  Squire Dicky had prepared an expedition against the rats of Dartmoor,
  transcending his defeated invasion, as largely as the armament of Xerxes
  surpassed that of Darius. A <i>triduum</i> of solid combat, (such as Greeks
  and Romans had, but civilized armies now eschew,) was ordered to begin, upon
  this great morning; for Dicky's heart needed some repose from love; but lo,
  the very terriers, best waterproofed with wire, bore upon their flanks such
  bars, as the young of the salmon tribe have, or a race-horse after a heavy
  gallop; and such as no washing may produce upon a dog, nor anything else but
  a thick, steady rain, that hits them against, and up, the grain of their dear
  coats, and so pursues them, until their sweet skins become oozy.</p>

  <p>Now Dr. Perperaps, beyond emphasis, and therefore in a whisper which
  outwent voice, had ordered, that the thing of all things his precious patient
  must most avoid, was the very slightest damp.</p>

  <p>"And it ain't slight damp;" said Dicky, in his slang way, to his darling
  mother, as she told him this; "my name's 'ratter,' this juicy day, and no
  mistake. Find the beggars all at home, this weather. I've got my army ready,
  and I mean to march. Old Dr. Perperaps went on about 'slight damp;' but he
  never said a word against such heavy wet as this. Hi there, you fellows, I'll
  be down in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>In a jiffy, he was down, but not as he intended; for his mother, being
  ample, and of very hearty substance, laid one strong arm across his back, and
  the other in the hollow of his knees; and thus having whisked him off his
  feet, bore him right easily to his bed-room, laid him on his bed, and locked
  him in. Then she sent orders to his army, to march to the brew-house, and
  have some beer, and a shilling apiece, and retire to their tents, until the
  next fine morning.</p>

  <p>When the whole expedition was thus disbanded, Dicky was released; and
  recovering quickly from his indignation&mdash;for he never bore resentment
  long&mdash;he sauntered to his sister Julia's room, to tease her pet dog
  <i>Elfie,</i> and to talk about matters of importance, as he called them.</p>

  <p>"Judy, shove aside your daubs," he said, for she was just pointing up,
  with fine grey eyebrows, a spirited sketch of Colonel Westcombe; "I want to
  consult you about a thing, that men cannot be expected much to enter into. I
  have already informed you, that my affections at last are permanently
  engaged."</p>

  <p>"So they always are. To a new one, every month. Be constant, Dicky, this
  time, if you can; for I rather like Spotty Perperaps."</p>

  <p>"What a pest you are! The spotty little fright! I am two inches taller
  than she is. Five feet four is the extreme lowest measure, as we say at
  Cambridge, of any girl I ever should make up to. You are such a height that
  you don't care. In fact, you had better have some short fellow; if you are
  not too proud to have anybody."</p>

  <p>"How does this bear upon your permanent affections?"</p>

  <p>"In this kind of way; as you ought to know, if your reasoning process was
  like ours. I scout the idea of Spotty Perperaps; and I love Rose Arthur."</p>

  <p>"Very well, let it be so. It is no concern of mine. Nothing ever comes of
  your adorations. The last was for a hideous bull-terrier. And probably the
  next will be for a badger."</p>

  <p>"Judy, I came for your advice; and not to be scoffed at with nasty levity.
  You thoroughly understand women, because you have got all their dodges in
  your nature. And all I ask you is a very simple thing&mdash;how would you
  recommend me to go on?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen the girl. How can I tell you?" Miss Touchwood answered,
  with large contempt. "Boys, like you, have a weak idea that all the women in
  the world are just alike, and as utter fools as they are themselves. I can
  only say this,&mdash;if you want to get on, be as unlike yourself as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"If you had tried for an hour, even you could hardly have said a more
  nasty thing. It makes me wonder, when I come across nice girls, whether they
  would talk like you, after they got married. It makes one afraid to have
  anything to do with them. Nobody can have a finer nature than I have; but
  nothing ever comes of it."</p>

  <p>"A very fine nature is its own reward," said Julia, touching up Colonel
  Westcombe. "But, Dicky, it never talks about itself."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Let it do anything it pleases. I never stand up to be
  wonderful at all; but every man who keeps a dog is fond of me. And if all the
  girls think that I am to be got, by snubbing me, they will find themselves in
  the wrong box."</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Julia, who after all was jealous, at hearing so much of
  Rose Arthur, "your new angel does not snub you, as if you did not even keep a
  dog."</p>

  <p>"That is the very point," answered Dicky, coming up, and showing many blue
  pricks in one leg; "these things made her take a liking to me; and I made the
  very most of them, tearing every hole that I could find, as game as if I
  meant to die for it. And for a long time, that scored three, every time I
  frightened her. But when I began to have Guinness, and to put one leg across
  the other, she seemed very suddenly to lose faith, and to think that I ought
  to put my boots on."</p>

  <p>"Then she showed some sense, and I respect her for it. What a plague you
  must have been! Even when you are well, you can't stay still. And I dare say,
  you danced one foot all day. And you cannot say a word, about anything but
  vermin. How can you expect a pretty girl to like you?"</p>

  <p>"It does not matter about that. They do," Dicky replied, as one who cites
  a fact, in lieu of argument; "I believe that it has something to do with
  this, that they think they can have their own way with me. That is the first
  thing all you women want. But she is very different from all you common
  females. Her mind is exalted, and her thoughts are large."</p>

  <p>"It is a delight to hear that," Miss Touchwood answered, without leaving
  off her work; "because it might be a very awkward thing, if she were to
  consider you worth catching. Gossip is entirely below my notice. But the
  rather haughty gentleman&mdash;I suppose he is a gentleman&mdash;who calls
  himself 'Captain Larks,' lies under some cloud of mystery, at present. Of
  course, it may be nothing; but you know as well as I do, that many people say
  he is a criminal in hiding. Very likely that is rubbish. But till something
  more is known, the less we have to do with them, the better."</p>

  <p>"Such nonsense drives me wild. What do you know of the world? You wanted
  to patronize Mr. Arthur&mdash;who never yet called himself Captain anything,
  and cares not a rap what fools say of him&mdash;and he put you down very
  neatly, and completely, simply by his manner, and without a word. It was a
  bitter pill for you, Miss Judy. But a bit of humble-pie every day, would do
  you good. The captain is the kindest man that ever lived. Many people think
  me a softy, and a fool. And I don't stick up to be a wonder. But I do know
  when people have been good to me, and put themselves out of their way, to
  help me. And I tell you, you are not fit to dust their floor for them. Put
  that in your pipe, and smoke it."</p>

  <p>With this elegant counsel, Squire Dicky ran away, stopping both ears, as
  if to keep out wicked language; while his sister only smiled, for she loved
  to irritate him, but never allowed him to do the like to her. But she could
  not help thinking of his very frank remarks, about her own character, and
  wondering whether there might be a grain of truth at the bottom of them.</p>

  <p>"Hurrah! Here comes somebody! A plucky cove, whoever he may be," shouted
  the excitable Dicky, in the "corridor"&mdash;as Lady Touchwood loved to call
  it; "Judy, shut up your lozenge-box, as soon as you have put a little lake
  upon your cheeks. I was just going to send to the stable for a halter! But
  here comes a visitor, to ruin the new velvet. Her ladyship will be in a
  precious state of mind. I defy him to sit down, without a quart of drainage.
  And the new peach-colour runs, if a fellow sneezes in the next room."</p>

  <p>Her ladyship however was a match for the emergency. The front-door bell
  had not ceased clanging, ere the much keener jingle of her own was heard, and
  the footman knew well which required first attention. "The little study,
  James, whoever it is! And put the big Bible open in the easy-chair, first."
  The man understood, made the only cushioned chair pretty safe from invasion;
  and then showed in Mr. Short.</p>

  <p>"Capital device! I give her credit for it," said the vicar to himself,
  while the man went to announce him.</p>

  <p>"Now I do call this very good of you indeed," Lady Touchwood exclaimed,
  without a bit of falsehood, as she came in, and made her sleeve go up, in a
  manner understood by women only, for fear of his fingers having dribbles to
  them; "an otter, or an oyster, or a conger-eel, is the only thing fit to be
  out, on such a day."</p>

  <p>"I rather like it;" said the parson, with a countenance which did not
  express any very keen delight, except such as a joint may find in basting;
  "at any rate, no weather ever stops me, except such a snow as we had, two
  years ago. You sent for me urgently; and I was bound to come."</p>

  <p>"No. I have not sent for you. It has been raining, I cannot say how long.
  Would I dream of sending for you, in such weather? I never do anything
  outrageous."</p>

  <p>"I thought you might have boxed&mdash;the compass in such weather. Here is
  your letter, your own handwriting&mdash;though the ink may have run, with
  more rain, than sand upon it."</p>

  <p>"There is both rain, and sand upon it," the lady answered, drawing back
  both hands; "but I never wrote a word of it. You know that I never use sand
  now. I keep it in the inkstand; but I scarcely ever use it, except from
  habit, when I happen to forget. This is not my writing. At what time did you
  get it?"</p>

  <p>"About twelve o'clock. Trickey leaves my letters to the last, because of
  these boots you see. I will tell you that, another time. What you say makes
  me a little uncomfortable. I could have sworn, this was your
  handwriting."</p>

  <p>"It not only is not my handwriting, but it is a very clumsy imitation of
  it. And do I put it this way&mdash;'Lady Touchwood presents her compliments
  to Mr. Short'&mdash;after all the years that I have known, and liked
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I know that you never begin like that; except when something has put you
  out. But excuse my remembering, that you did write so, about six months back,
  when I had vexed you. And I thought that you might have been annoyed again,
  though I could not call to mind my fault. And that made me order my horse at
  once; for I had some idea&mdash;but never mind that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short's futile idea had been, that Lady Touchwood must have
  discovered, at last, his admiration of her daughter; and this had brought him
  straightway, to face the question.</p>

  <p>"That letter was posted at our post-office, and in one of those horrid new
  envelopes," the lady proceeded, with that calm judgment which we all exert,
  upon the troubles of our friends; "you may depend upon it, that you have been
  decoyed from home, for some bad purpose. Either to rob you on your road, or
  to rob your house, while you were away. Everybody says how rich you are."</p>

  <p>"It is good to have the highest of all characters. Since you have not sent
  for me, and do not want me in this morassy state; I will say 'good-morning,'
  Lady Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"You shall do nothing of the sort, until you have had one of those long
  twisted glasses (from some undiscovered country) of my white-currant cordial.
  There is no Mrs. Short to look after you, or to reproach me for not doing
  so." Lady Touchwood gave a sly glance herewith, for she was much too sharp,
  not to know of his weakness for Julia, and had no fear of it. "But you came
  through the rain, to oblige me, as you thought; and you are frightfully
  soaked; and riding home you will have the wind on your back, and get lumbago.
  You know my patent cordial, don't you? None of your currant wine&mdash;oh,
  Lord!&mdash;but the very finest whisky and white currants, done by a very old
  receipt, and bottled to stand upright for at least seven years."</p>

  <p>"It sounds very good. But shall I stand upright, or sit upright in the
  saddle, with the wind upon my back, and lumbago coming? I will take nothing
  more than a glass of your old ale, the golden ale made of the Wiveliscombe
  malt; and then I will ask your good son Dicky, for one of his long old tough
  cigars. With the wind on the crupper, it will last me all the way."</p>

  <p>These things were sent for, and the horse was ordered (much against his
  liking, for he was just doing nicely), and then Lady Touchwood took the
  opportunity of putting a word in season, just at the genial moment of good
  relish, which a fine ham-sandwich gives to ale. "And how is Captain Larks
  getting on?" said she. "Everything he does is so delightful. When will you
  bring him over?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as he will come," replied the wary parson. "Why should I hurry
  him? Am I bound to commit social suicide? I feel myself cast into the shade
  already, because there is no romance about me."</p>

  <p>"No, no, you are never in the shade," cried the lady, being dull at
  metaphor; "everybody knows every atom about you. He is the one, that is in
  the shade. But I am sure, that he never deserved it."</p>

  <p>"He appears very honest, and he may be that," said the vicar, with a
  solemn shake of head; "but where did he get his silver spoons?"</p>

  <p>"Come now, you are a great deal too jealous." Lady Touchwood always
  supposed a person, who did not smile, to be in earnest. "If there is anything
  the matter with him, it must be at least of the upper classes. He has been
  accustomed to the best society. I am sure, he never would do anything, of a
  lower rank than forgery."</p>

  <p>"Let us make a round-robin, and put in the middle&mdash;'Is it forgery, is
  it homicide, is it treason? Your hearty well-wishers feel confident, that you
  have done something respectable.' If I prepare the document, will you sign it
  at the top?"</p>

  <p>"Go along. Here is your horse at the door. There never is any reasoning
  with you. But I do hope that you will not catch cold, or find anything at
  home, to vex you."</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid. My house can defy the world, with Mrs. Agget in it, and
  good <i>Nous</i> upon guard. Oh, here comes Squire Dicky, just in time to say
  'good-bye.' How well he looks! Why, my good friend, glass and putty seem to
  suit your constitution. I must build a new greenhouse, for you to tumble
  through it."</p>

  <p>"I am pretty sure of one thing; if I did, you would never be like Captain
  Arthur. You would make me pay for it, and for all the plants too."</p>

  <p>"What a wise babe it is! He has hit the mark. Lady Touchwood, the Cantabs
  always do. But don't come out in the rain, my friend. Your glazing is not
  water proof."</p>

  <p>"I hope he will find his old house robbed;" said Dicky, as the parson rode
  away, and the story of the letter was repeated. "It would be worth a hundred
  pounds to me, to have a rise taken out of him. He thinks himself so
  confoundedly clever; and he never lets another fellow say a single word
  almost."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't be so spiteful, my dear. I am sure, that you always hold your
  own with him. It amuses me sometimes, to hear you get so very much the better
  of him."</p>

  <p>But Dicky shook his head. For he was a candid youth, and knew that he had
  no chance with Mr. Short, in any other view than his dear mother's.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; AMONG THE JACKDAWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Among the good people of Dartmoor, very few subjects
  (outside of their own parish) arouse more interest, or create more wonder,
  than a town in the south-east of England, which used in plain days to be
  called London, but has no idea of being now described, except as "this mighty
  Babylon," or "our immense metropolis."</p>

  <p>A man came down from London once to Christowell, by some accident, and he
  put up at the <i>Three Horse-shoes,</i> and he called for hot brandy and
  water. With wonderful speed, considering the size of the village, it was
  heard that he was there; and nobody, who could help it, failed to go and see,
  what he was like. No idle curiosity was in their bosoms, neither any anxiety
  to drink his health&mdash;fearfully though he must require it, for every one
  had heard of the plague of London&mdash;but it was the clear wish of a large
  community, to recognize an envoy from one even larger. The gentleman, whose
  residence was in Whitechapel, could by no means understand their speech; but
  by help of a smoky old map in the bar&mdash;a better map than any that has
  been made since&mdash;he managed to try to get into their heads, by a bold
  exaggeration of his own, that London town was bigger than all Dartmoor. Now
  John Sage came in, before that was got over; and when he began to understand
  it&mdash;for his mind was slow, from its magnitude&mdash;the simplest truism
  from his lips made the bagman order slippers. For John said nothing rude, but
  stretched his arms across the hills, and valleys, of the map (which looked
  more vast from the fog shed over them by much smoke), and without turning
  round, he reflected thus: "Never wur I one of they, as goeth again' the Lor'
  Amaighty. Every day, a' doeth winders. But niver, if so be a' worked all
  Zinday, could a' create rogues enow, to orkapy all thiccy."</p>

  <p>Perhaps this view of the matter is unsound; though John was never
  contradicted, after he once turned fifty; for his father was known to have
  foretold, as true as a cathedral clock, the day of his departure from this
  world. But it may be argued, very soundly, that if there be, in London,
  lawyers honest; <i>a fortiori,</i> there must be other people of that same
  cumbrous quality. And, without any hazardous admission about that, it is
  enough to say, that in 1840, there might have been found, in the very heart
  of London, a firm of solicitors as honest as the day.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Latimer &amp; Emblin, of No. 10, Jackdaw's Court, Gray's Inn, had
  been in practice (through their ancestors, or selves), for upwards of a
  century; and their practice was quiet, and wise, and solid. With litigation
  they dealt so little, that if any one asked them who was the present
  Attorney-General, they went to the legal almanac to look, and after much
  consultation, sometimes put the saddle upon the wrong animal. Yet, being
  always accurate in the end, and very particular not to mislead, whenever they
  made a mistake, they always corrected it by post, at a nominal charge. And
  if, while alive, any lawyer can conciliate affection, it is by acknowledging
  that he was wrong; with a lenient charge for confessing it.</p>

  <p>Even as the loftiest of all watch-makers&mdash;"horologists" now they call
  themselves&mdash;will not allow time to make any noise near him, but glances
  in his office at a mute chronometer: so the very deepest lawyers hush the
  clack of law, on their own premises. It must be present in the air; as the
  smell of cheeses from the warehouse is, where only plugs are kept to taste;
  but unless anybody asks too much, it may try to pass for a sweet-smelling
  savour; and to analyse such things, is seldom wise.</p>

  <p>But though they declined all common-law cases (except for some client of
  generations), and had little to do with equity, these two gentlemen were
  sound lawyers, and never gave ill-advised advice. They would go through the
  form of consulting counsel; as a solicitor often does, when he knows much
  more than the barrister, or at any rate works his knowledge better. But in
  reality, they relied upon their own long experience, caution, good sense, and
  the traditions of the firm. And whenever they made a mistake, it was through
  undue veneration for the latter. And such a mistake they were making, at this
  time.</p>

  <p>Mr. Latimer now was a venerable man, wealthy, contented, and well-endowed
  with those gifts of bygone generations&mdash;thick, snowy curls, and sound
  natural teeth. He was very particular about his dress, already becoming
  antiquated&mdash;that is to say, fine kersey breeches, black stockings, and
  buckled shoes, a straight-cut coat, a shirt, with a frill of the purest white
  cambric, (fastened with a brooch, containing a lock of his late wife's hair),
  and a roll-collar waistcoat of black silk; under whose margin, and upon a
  fair rotundity, glistened a broad watered ribbon, supporting a weighty gold
  ring of magnificent gold seals. With all these things his grave mild face,
  and dignified air comported well; making it difficult to imagine, and quite
  impossible to find, a more perfect specimen of a gentleman of business.</p>

  <p>Mr. Emblin was nearly a score of years younger, taller by a head, and
  sparely framed. He had a little turn for sporting dress, but checked it, as
  much as he could, at the Office. He had some fine ideas of "going ahead," and
  lamented, at home, that his senior so sternly refused to have anything to do
  with a branch of business, now bringing in money by the bagful&mdash;to wit,
  the mighty schemes of mad railway companies. But he had a prudent wife, who
  told him of the ancient legend of the bird in hand; also he had a shrewd head
  of his own, and traditions of an ancestor who had been ruined by the "South
  Sea bubble." So that he managed to abstain; though it irked him sadly, to see
  the ungodly (in the form of inferior attorneys) puffed up with company
  fatness, and swelling about, as if the round earth was their rail.</p>

  <p>This firm had large premises all their own; for Jackdaw's Court belonged,
  only in part, to the learned and honourable Society. Sundry people, sometimes
  so illegal as to be downright costermongers, held their local habitation
  there, by some original frankpledge; and if they were questioned about their
  title, they supposed it to be chaff, and made answer generally, that they
  never stuck up to be nobs. But No. 10 stood apart from any contact with such
  squatters, being a goodly house, rebuilt in the reign of Queen Anne, as the
  date declared, with Righteousness and Peace, above the third floor windows,
  kissing each other in compo.</p>

  <p>Now Righteousness and Peace, with a wreath around them, relieved their
  airy costume with black, and their rippling tresses with a wealth of
  soot&mdash;at a shilling a bushel, which is fair price&mdash;also the
  railings would have paid for scraping, by a man who knows how to "utilize";
  and many other little specks might have been discovered, by the boy who
  washed the windows of the Moreton folk. Still, when a gentleman once got in,
  he had many grounds for satisfaction, and perhaps for gratitude. For he found
  a good mat for his boots, and some landscapes to look at (instead of land,
  drawn and quartered, with arrows stuck through its disembowelment), also
  chairs of illegal nature, because they could give as well as take, and a
  power of attorney to sit down, and poke the fire, without prejudice.</p>

  <p>On the first floor, a very tidy room contained some handsome old
  furniture, and the members of the firm, from ten until four o'clock of the
  day. No one, in those brave times, required sherry and sandwiches, or stout
  and oysters, at the witching hour of the legal noon, when writs are running
  rapidest, and clients go to and fro, most prone to be devoured; but the wiser
  manner of solid lawyers was, to dine at half-past five, with the hungry
  bosoms of their family around, and a quiet rubber, or sweet nap, in prospect.
  Though the railways already were beginning to screech out, to make the day
  hideous, and the night a nightmare.</p>

  <p>Now a good drizzle often makes a fine day of business in London, because
  it is so dirty. If our "vast metropolis" attempted to be clean, it would
  never do half the trade it does. Not only because of the energy wasted in so
  vain an enterprise, nor even through the violence offered thus to nature; but
  chiefly because the people, coming with the money, would be in several minds
  about a bargain. When all is serene, and a walk, or drive, a pleasure, as in
  most continental cities, a customer (even though he be of British race) hangs
  over his cash more dubiously. "I can come again to-morrow; I will think about
  it; I will look into my bankbook, and perhaps consult my wife," is the
  unsatisfactory process of his mind; and the likelihood is, that he never
  comes again. But upon a day of good substantial dirt, with the drip of a
  myriad umbrellas in his neck, and a very safe note of bronchitis in his
  throat, his dogged resolution says, "Now, or never. I have ploughed through
  all this muck; and I mean business."</p>

  <p>On that day, when the rain rushed down so savagely on Dartmoor, there was
  in London nothing more than a drizzle, bedewing the growth of business. Dirt
  came up between the flag-stones, as if there were a crop of cress to lift it;
  and getting kicked away by scambling feet, slipped into a coat of slimy mud.
  Impatient men, whose time was money, at every advance lost twenty-five per
  cent.; while the slow, knock-kneed fellow, from the country, accustomed to
  slippery fallows, grinned. And, though the neighbourhood of Gray's Inn is not
  so very bad, when considered calmly, backsliding occurred there, not only of
  hams, but also of tongues under very learned wigs.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we may almost go," said Mr. Latimer, whose manner was to
  offer everything in <i>semble</i>; "it is getting rather dark, at a quarter
  to four, even in what might be called a summer month; or at any rate used to
  be so considered. The extraordinary increase in the quantity of soot, that
  fills the air, is quite wonderful. Within my memory, our jackdaws had quite a
  colour of their own, and their backs used to shine, like a boot, or a bottle;
  but now they go about, as if they swept chimneys. Emblin, you must have
  noticed it."</p>

  <p>"You have drawn my attention to the fact before," said his partner, who
  heard the remark every week; "but good-bye, I fear, to our chance of getting
  off; for here comes a carriage. Why it is my lord's, and Mr. Gaston in it!
  What I told you was right; he can do exactly as he pleases, in that
  quarter."</p>

  <p>"I could hardly have believed it," Mr. Latimer replied; "such a
  self-willed man as my lord was once! But such men seem to become most
  helpless, when their vigour fails them. It is a lucky thing for him, to have
  such a man of business, shrewd, active, honest, intelligent, and a thoroughly
  sound Tory."</p>

  <p>"I have not quite the opinion of our friend that you have. However, that
  is no concern of ours, so long as he has his credentials. Holloa! Why here he
  is!"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, your most obedient!" Mr. Gaston exclaimed, in his playful
  manner, foregoing the honour of being announced. "Delighted to see you, at
  the receipt of custom. I said to my lord, when he grumbled about
  something&mdash;'You may go all over Lincoln's Inn, Gray's Inn, and both
  Temples, and find no firm to compare with them.' By old Harry, I was right.
  And it is not only that, but the manners, the cordiality, the polish put on
  business."</p>

  <p>"Sir, we are much obliged, by your good opinion. What can we do for you,
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Latimer disliked familiarity, and was a good judge of a gentleman,
  inasmuch as he was one himself. But nothing ever abashed George Gaston.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I begin to feel ashamed of coming so often, about a
  thing that seems so simple. But being so entirely trusted with this business,
  which cannot make the difference of a doit to me, I seem to be compelled to
  see about it, more than if it were my own concern. Of legal matters I know as
  little as a babe; and my great desire is to leave the whole of them to you,
  who know them so thoroughly, and are so careful. But as you know, I am not my
  own master; and to-day he has been in a perpetual fume. I hope you have
  settled something."</p>

  <p>"I beg you to sit down, sir," Mr. Latimer replied; "you could ill be
  spared; and there is such a thing as being too hard upon the labouring horse.
  You have indeed plenty upon your hands, without being worried by this
  troublesome affair. But let us recount our own little share. Emblin, may I
  trouble you for the private day-book? Here is a copy of the very careful
  letter, written by my excellent partner himself, and directed in accordance
  with the address which you discovered, by your most disinterested labours.
  And here is that letter itself, bearing all the proper postmarks, and
  returned by this very morning's post, in this new envelope, with a very curt,
  not to say discourteous reply. Solitude does not perhaps improve the manners;
  but we long have known the gentleman to be most eccentric."</p>

  <p>"Short, but not sweet," said Mr. Gaston, lifting his eyebrows, as he read
  indignantly&mdash;'I beg to return your rigmarole. Once for all, I will have
  nothing to do with the bad lot I have quitted; and whether they are alive, or
  dead, makes no difference to yours obediently, L. Arthur.'" Upon my word,
  such a man is outside the pale of civilized life altogether."</p>

  <p>"So he may be," Mr. Emblin broke in, after watching Gaston narrowly; "but
  that does not dispense with his signature. The Company want the land; they
  pay a long price for it; and it is wholly impossible to convey it, without
  this gentleman's concurrence, or decease. My senior agrees with me. The title
  has been passed; and now this fatal hitch arises."</p>

  <p>"But we don't want the money, and we hate to sell the land," cried the
  visitor, with his red colour rising. "If they take our land against our will,
  surely they must take it, as they can get it. Suppose a man could force his
  land on me, and take my money&mdash;should I be bound to show him all the
  history of my money? Yet how could he tell, that it was my own?"</p>

  <p>"In theory, there may be much in that," Mr. Latimer answered gently; "but
  we must consider things, as they are. These new-fangled companies, they may
  do good, or they may do harm&mdash;which seems more likely; but at any rate
  they get their Act; and no man's house is his castle against them. They take
  a man's land, without his leave; and if he cannot make them fee-simple
  without blemish, they suspend a large percentage of the purchase-money. It is
  tyranny of course; but if these companies endure, their tyranny will soon be
  a thousandfold of that. But to come back to the point,&mdash;in the face of
  this refusal, what are we to do for the best, to meet his lordship's wishes,
  and to keep things smooth? Is he still under orders to avoid excitement?"</p>

  <p>"Sir John Tickell says no more than this, that the banging of a door
  (unless he banged it himself, which he does pretty heartily, as you know)
  might send him, in a moment, far beyond the reach of medicine. I wish you
  would only come, and see him; he still sees old friends, upon his better
  days; and he has a high regard for you, Mr. Latimer."</p>

  <p>"His lordship's remembrance, and good opinion of me," the honest lawyer
  answered, with a proud glance at his buckles, which had belonged to a Sir
  Thomas Latimer, "are profoundly gratifying. He is not one who rashly forms
  good opinions. Even you, Mr. Gaston, were with him some years, before you won
  his entire confidence. But experience has proved your sterling value."</p>

  <p>"I simply do my duty, and deserve no thanks. But it takes a great deal, as
  you say, to overcome his lordship's mistrust in human nature. A treacherous
  son is a sad shock to confidence."</p>

  <p>"And to lose the better one, a very bitter blow. I see that his lordship
  keeps his servants still in mourning. It is sad indeed, to see the ancient
  families die out."</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Latimer," the visitor said briskly, "there is one old family as
  young as ever, and one of its finest representatives is here, and I have the
  honour of looking at him. No compliments, sir; in those I never deal. If I
  have prospered, and obtained some good repute, and the confidence of every
  one possessed of noble feeling, it is through nothing more than plain rough
  truth. I say to everybody, 'you must take me as I am.'"</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Emblin, who had not got any compliments, and considered
  his family quite as good as Latimer's, and wanted to be off to see to a
  little dinner-party, "it appears to me, that we have settled nothing, about
  the business Mr. Gaston came to speak of; unless it is to leave things <i>in
  statu quo</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Statu quo</i> is an excellent expression," that gentleman replied,
  with all his strong cordiality; "it is the proper attitude for large
  landowners, and their humble representatives. Let the next step proceed from
  the bold intruders. If they are in a hurry, we are not. We meet them with the
  simple fact, that we can do no more. They must leap the obstacles, in their
  own way. Possession is what they want; and they can have it. 'I give thee
  all, I can no more,' is our final answer to them. You will put the matter in
  the proper legal form; and there it rests, while his lordship lives."</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Emblin, who was dry, and very tough, "we are bound to make
  another effort. This gentleman refuses to have anything to do with us.
  Perhaps he has a fancy that we have wronged him. None the less, the Company
  might find him more amenable, especially for a good consideration. Even upon
  Dartmoor, coin is current. Powderhorn, and Bullrush, are sharp and active
  people. What do you say to our letting them get at him, as our side cannot do
  any more, and obtaining his signature, if they can?"</p>

  <p>"An excellent idea," replied Gaston calmly, though his face became purple,
  and his eyes shone darkly; "if we could only keep it from his lordship; and
  if it were an honourable thing to do so. Otherwise, you know what he would
  say&mdash;'if Powderhorn, and Bullrush, can do my business, and Latimer, and
  Emblin, cannot, Powderhorn, and Bullrush are the men for me.'"</p>

  <p>"Highly as we value our relation towards his lordship, which has now
  existed for many years," Mr. Latimer interposed, with dignity; "no fear of
  the withdrawal of his confidence would hinder us, from doing our duty towards
  him. That is not the thing to stop us. We never submit to threats. But the
  step which has been proposed, at a sally, by my valued partner, would
  not&mdash;as he knows even better than I do&mdash;be in keeping with
  professional etiquette. Therefore, sir, we will not adopt the course which
  you object to."</p>

  <p>"How can it make any difference to me?" Mr. Gaston asked, turning round to
  Mr. Emblin, for he found the calm eyes of the senior partner harder to meet,
  than the keen gaze of the younger; "I never understand your prim niceties of
  tweedledum. If I make a mistake, I bow, as every one must do, to such a
  profession."</p>

  <p>"Then let it be so," Mr. Emblin answered lightly, to let the little gust
  of temper pass; "it is understood, that we do nothing at all, but wait on our
  oars, till the enemy moves. If he is contented with the title we can give
  him, all well and good; and let him pay the money. If not, we cannot help it,
  and he pays into Court a percentage against contingencies. But on no account
  must his lordship be disturbed, in his present state of health, about it. If
  anything arises, we do nothing, until we have seen you about it."</p>

  <p>"You know better than I do, ten million times over," said Gaston
  impulsively; "what a plague this business is to me! But when I have once
  taken up a thing, I seem in some way bound to go on with it. Good-bye,
  gentlemen, both, good-bye! You are martyrs to business; but even a martyr
  must not have his dinner burnt, as well as himself."</p>

  <p>They followed him to the door, as if they did not quite understand this
  style of parting. Whether he was going with a friendly turn, or whether he
  would try&mdash;and he seldom tried in vain&mdash;to do a mischief to their
  good firm. For put it as he will, when his stomach is up (and somehow or
  other, it is most exalted, when profoundly empty) reflection will make the
  true lawyer less desirous to rule double line, and leave <i>hiatus</i>, below
  the name of a wealthy, elderly, and decidedly combative nobleman. But Gaston
  spoke no word of weakness, and waved them an airy adieu, upon the
  landing.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he will do?" asked Mr. Emblin, as his partner, without
  condescending to be seen, observed in a dignified manner the departure of the
  mighty carriage; "I am sure he is a horribly spiteful fellow."</p>

  <p>"I neither know, nor care," Mr. Latimer replied, as he went to get his
  plodding shoes, and thick gaiters. "He may be very upright; and his conduct
  seems to prove it. A common time-server would be cap-in-hand to those who are
  in remainder, and unhappily cannot be set aside. But one thing is certain. He
  is not a gentleman. He has hurt my feelings needlessly; and it takes a great
  deal to hurt my feelings. Perhaps, you should scarcely have said what you
  did. But his observation was simply brutal. Powderhorn, and Bullrush, for his
  lordship! One thing is certain. We must do nothing, until we are properly
  requested to do it."</p>

  <p>"My little dinner-party will be spoiled," said Mr. Emblin; "and I shall be
  out of sorts about you too. But clearly you are right. The next move must
  come from him."</p>

  <p>Now it so happened, that this was, to a nicety, the very conclusion
  desired by George Gaston.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX. &mdash; TALL AND SHORT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was another little dinner spoiled that very day, and
  by the self-same omnipotent roguery of mankind, exerted perhaps, in the
  latter case, more frankly and respectably. However, it was sad as almost
  anything can be, and a far deeper outrage on the feeling of the public, than
  the rapid demission to their final cause of a hundred hungry lawyers.</p>

  <p>To describe this occurrence, without exaggeration, and yet with the
  sympathy which cannot be refused, is beyond the highest hope of the most
  sanguine self-esteem; not only, because no single two persons&mdash;if such a
  phrase may pass in such confusion&mdash;to whatever extent they may have both
  been present (and the whole parish found that it had been present, as the
  interest waxed, and the danger waned) could upon any terms be brought to
  reconcile their accounts with one another's, or even with themselves; but
  through a deeper denial than that&mdash;for that always happens, and a thing
  could not be true, if two people took the same view of it
  exactly&mdash;namely through a stern, but for our sakes most beneficial, law
  of nature, that dogs have no articulate human speech, as yet.</p>

  <p>It was raining cats and dogs&mdash;as some loose genius has discovered to
  describe it&mdash;when Parson Short, drenched and almost sodden to the bone,
  rode up the lane from the village to his home. The vicarage, a good
  old-fashioned house, facing the lowlands, and sheltered from the moor, stood
  back in the glebe, at least a quarter of a mile from any other dwelling, and
  from the high-road. Large trees around it kept out the sun-glare, while they
  let in the play of light; and firs of laminated verdure (like the Deodara
  that is ousting them) gave a stately movement to the wind, and divided the
  driving rain with shelter.</p>

  <p>"My certy, something must be wrong," the vicar exclaimed, as he found no
  Thomas at the gate to meet him (although he was an hour now behind his time),
  and what was even more extraordinary, no <i>Nous,</i> with a caper at his
  bridle; then he gave a shrill whistle, but neither man, nor dog, came forth,
  or made any reply at all. So he unlatched the gate, with the crook of his
  whip, and <i>Trumpeter</i> pushed it with his saturated neck. In a minute Mr.
  Short was at his own front-door, but the dripping of the rain was the only
  sound to greet him. Getting down from his horse, with a puddle running from
  him, he found the door open; and snatching a big stick from the
  umbrella-stand, while he shouted "House ahoy! Is there nobody alive here?" on
  he went to the real headquarters of a house&mdash;the kitchen. There was
  nobody there, and the fire was out, his half-leg of mutton was floured for
  the roast, but reposed upon the table in that interesting stage; while the
  dresser, that wholesome pride of Mrs. Aggett's heart, was in sixes and sevens
  of confusion. The master turned pale, for he expected to find murder, knowing
  how steady and how steadfast was his housewife. But in another moment, great
  relief ensued, and even a strong tendency to sad laughter.</p>

  <p>For hearing a noise, like that of a small boy blowing through a papered
  comb, he grasped his truncheon firmly, and went to seek it. And there, in the
  furthest recess of the scullery, he beheld a sight such as he never yet had
  seen. Lashed to the pump by the long jack-towel, so that she could move
  neither hand nor foot, was a fat, but highly respectable female, whom he knew
  by her dress to be his good housekeeper. Her face was invisible, and her
  tongue under disability, because the metal colander, wherein she was washing
  spinach, had been securely fastened over, and contained, most fittingly, the
  whole of her expressive countenance. Upon the upper rim of this vessel, as in
  a spirit of mockery, played the half-mourning ribbons of her second-best cap,
  a tribute of respect to the departed Aggett. Hearing her master's approach,
  she tried to stamp, for her temper was unequal to the strain of this
  adversity; but the only result was a vibration of the pump, and a little gush
  of water down her sadly aching back.</p>

  <p>With a brief word or two of manly sympathy, the vicar hastened to the
  knife-box, and finding the game-carver, began to cut the swathings of her
  long duresse. But when he would have eased her of the dark, oppressive
  domino, she thrust at him with her liberated elbow, and completing her
  freedom, made off down the passage. Mr, Short, having lofty opinion of women,
  looked after her, with a strong faith in her motives for this rude
  proceeding. And his confidence was justified, for no sooner had she found
  herself round a corner, where no light shone, than she dashed away the
  colander, and screamed back&mdash;"No man shan't zee my vace, till I've
  washed un." For she was a fine cook, and she knew how spinach oozes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she knows where Lizzie is; or she never would bother about her
  face," the parson thought, with continued faith; for Lizzie, the handmaid of
  the house, was Mrs. Aggett's only daughter; and before he could do any more
  about that, his housekeeper, following the veinage of his thoughts, quicker
  than he could follow hers, called back from the top of the back
  stairs&mdash;"he hath kayed her in. I've a' heered Lizzie thumping. The black
  gentleman have kayed her in your sarmon-room. Go you, and see to things, it
  was a shame on 'e to naglax; and hus'll be down by that time."</p>

  <p>"I fear she is very much put out indeed," Mr. Short said to himself, as he
  went to look round the house at large; "and what should I do, if she gave me
  notice? But this seems a very queer thing altogether. The plate gone, of
  course, and all my money. However, there was scarcely £50 to steal. Oh, what
  am I about, to think of miserable money? My <i>Nous</i> must be dead, my most
  clever, faithful darling! He would leap at their throats, till they killed
  him."</p>

  <p>Leaving all his losses to be gained at leisure, he ran out through a
  side-door to the dog's abode, or rather the stall where he was chained in
  weather too wet for his kennel; and where he found no comfort but in
  mourning, when his master was away without him. Mrs. Aggett belonged to that
  class of women, who from defect of large sympathy, exclaim, "drat the dog!"
  when they come across a footprint; instead of reflecting on the great
  superiority of the canine to the human foot, in addition to the double
  number. And <i>Nous,</i> who had no vanity, looked up to Mrs. Aggett; not
  only because of her control of bones, but also through a sense of her command
  of broom-handles, such as came down upon him from the wrong direction, and
  caught him on the back, while he with integrity was gazing forwards. And
  often he got a great lump by this.</p>

  <p>His master understood these woes; and finding consolation grievous, when
  they made much fuss together, tried to avert the blow by strictest
  <i>alibi</i> of <i>Nous,</i> when undefended. For even Mrs. Aggett, thorough
  despot as she was, durst not descend upon the dog with all her vigour, when
  the master was at home; and they all knew that. At other times, it was a
  bitter fact, that if <i>Nous</i> came in, with an honest view to luncheon, or
  a laudable exercise of foresight as to dinner, concerning both the hour and
  the substance; at the very moment when he stood wiping his feet on the
  rope-mat, to the utmost of his conscience, a heavy thump of something void of
  feeling, but capable of conveying it too well, was prone to dim his
  happiness, and darken his reflections.</p>

  <p>"She has brought upon herself this signal Nemesis of pump," Mr. Short
  muttered grimly, as he ran to look for <i>Nous.</i> "There is no rogue in the
  kingdom, who could steal into our scullery, while that dog was left at large.
  But why has he not saluted my return? He always hears us coming up the lane.
  Why, <i>Nous,</i> my darling! You are not dead, are you?"</p>

  <p>The parson fell back against the stable-door, and a rush of tears dimmed
  his keen brave eyes. For the poor dog was lying on his side, among the straw,
  senseless, and motionless, and to all appearance dead. The chain was jerked
  tight round his neck, as a hangman's noose, with the hair standing out from
  it, and his body was rolled up like a silkworm spinning, or a fossil
  ammonite; while his curly ears, falling back, showed their silver linings,
  and only the whites of his eyes could be seen. He had given up all hope of
  himself, and only wanted to die without any more disturbance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Short had the presence of mind to say no more. The dog had not heard
  him yet; and to excite him, while he was thus throttled, would cut his last
  hair. Stealing his steps, like a nurse at the bedside of some one afflicted
  with heart-disease, the master got behind him, and looked into the position.
  After a hard struggle of long hours, <i>Nous</i> was now at his very last
  gasp, and he must have been dead long ago, if he had not managed with
  extraordinary skill, to get the strongest claw of each hind foot, under a
  link of that strangling chain. To such a strait was he brought, by simple
  indignation at the villainy of mankind.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to undo the chain, for the dog had wrought it up into a
  series of spikes; but luckily a three-cornered rasp, for the hoofs of
  <i>Trumpeter,</i> lay handy. Mr. Short took the twisted chain between his
  knees, and cut a link, and eased it at the poor dog's withers, and then
  released it gently from his puckered throat. Hereupon a little sigh came up,
  from the huddled hoops of the ribs; and the cut of the nostrils lifted
  faintly; and the throat began to quiver, with a longing to expel a bark that
  had stuck fast in it. By great skill and care, he was gradually brought
  round; but such was his exhaustion, that when he tried to sit up, and lick
  his master's hand once more, his cramped legs failed him, and he fell among
  the hay-bands.</p>

  <p>As soon as his favourite was out of danger, the vicar (who had shouted in
  vain for Thomas), returned, in a settled frame of mind, to see how far his
  household gods were shorn. Being now assured that no life was
  taken&mdash;unless it were that of old Thomas, which appeared scarcely
  possible to any one who knew him&mdash;the master of the premises was ready
  to consider what had happened, in its proper order. And <i>Nous,</i> who
  displayed much more excitement, because he considered the whole fault his
  own, came staggering after him, to learn the worst.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Aggett, by this time, was evil to approach. She had found her
  daughter Lizzie, in the sermon-room, crying, not from the effect of the
  discourses piled around&mdash;however touching they might be,&mdash;but
  through inability to escape from them, and the idea of the tombstones which
  they suggested; in addition to anxiety about her only parent, and a deep
  inner sense that she had had no dinner. Intolerant of misplaced lamentation,
  the mother proved the fitness of her survival, by delivering a hearty thump
  between the mourner's shoulders, then bidding her be off, and thank the Lord,
  for bread and dripping, she bustled round the house, to see how much was left
  of anything.</p>

  <p>So far as a hasty survey revealed, there was very little gone of any real
  value. The plate was untouched; but some old-fashioned knives, and notably an
  ancient Oxford carver (with a heel to it, and a curved hartshorn handle), had
  vanished; and so had a double-barrelled gun, and a 2 lb. canister of powder,
  and a stiff three-jointed fly-rod, and a book full of tackle, and a few other
  things from the lobby of sporting implements. "A must a' been one of they
  dratted poochers," Mrs. Aggett exclaimed, with great relief; "and welcome a'
  be to all thic rubbish."</p>

  <p>However, when the master came to look, he found that a little bag of
  tithes was gone, containing about £40 in gold, which he seemed to himself to
  have hidden right cunningly, in a hole of his bed-room wall, behind the
  barometer; which every one was afraid of, as a piece of wicked witchment.
  Like a sensible man, he was vexed to lose his money, although he had plenty
  more that could not be stolen; but remembering at once, that his meaning had
  been to spend most of this in charity, he perceived that his charity must be
  curtailed. But before he was much consoled by this, he came upon a dearer
  loss, which taxed his finest feelings.</p>

  <p>His grandfather, Admiral Short, had been a person of great punctuality,
  timing all his movements by a large gold watch, and thereby measuring the
  minutes needful to defeat the enemy. He was called "Punctuality Short";
  because in a contest of some celebrity, he had said, "we shall have her in
  twenty-five minutes;" then holding his watch, with the going side outwards,
  upon a nice round abdomen, he worked his guns to such effect, that she struck
  in 24 minutes 30 seconds. And when he discharged, with punctuality also, no
  more guns, but the peaceful debt of nature, his last words were, "my grandson
  Tom is to have the Victory chronometer." A chronometer it was, and beat that
  of the ship; though portable watches were content, as yet, to be called
  "watches," and no more.</p>

  <p>Finding his money flown, the parson hurried to the case in which he kept
  this triumph of the Barwise firm. By it, he had the church-clock set; and by
  it (whatever the church-clock said) he had the bells rung on a Sunday
  morning, to tell the parish when eight o'clock was; for the women (who always
  got up first on a Sunday) to put their husbands' clothes out, and for the
  little girls to soap their brothers, and for the barber&mdash;having fifty
  long beards to hew down, between that and ten o'clock&mdash;to pour his
  boiling water on his dish of suds, and set off to do the halfpenny fellows
  first. For, as many of the men as paid a penny, got another good hour to
  stretch their arms.</p>

  <p>There were perhaps a thousand things, of almost equal moment, for which
  this big watch struck the spring&mdash;or, if that expression be an
  involution, awoke the time of day for Christowell. But what is the use of
  detailing them, when the watch, and all its works, were gone?</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable instance of the overpowering effect of great
  catastrophes, that when Mr. Short found his true Palladium conspicuous by its
  absence, the only thing he did was, to double his fists unwittingly, and the
  only thing he said was&mdash;"What a bad job!"</p>

  <p>"Hath a' tuk the kay along wi' 'un? Ay, that a' hath!" cried Mrs. Aggett,
  with some admiration, as she came up, to see what her master was about; "but
  the zeals be all here. Well, I said a' was a gentleman; though a' might be a
  black one."</p>

  <p>This observation recalled Mr. Short's attention from the deed, to the doer
  thereof; and knowing&mdash;as a preacher has opportunity of doing&mdash;how
  soon the clearest impression will fade, he began at once to question his
  housekeeper, concerning her assailant. And it seemed to him almost to be an
  excess of her wonted peculiarities, when she charged the blame wholly, and
  solely, on himself, evincing goodwill, if not downright gratitude, to the man
  who had fastened her to the pump. The only description she could give, or
  would, was that he seemed to be "a tall black gentleman, going about very
  graciously;" till the vicar at last lost his patience, and exclaimed, "you
  had better say I robbed my own house. Upon my word, I believe you think
  so!"</p>

  <p>"Noo, noo, twadn't you," the good woman replied; "a' was dree times so
  tall as you be. 'Twor as much as the odds, atwixt thic, and thiccy." She held
  up her long middle finger, as she spoke, to indicate the robber gentleman;
  and then, as figurative of her master, displayed the top-joint of her dumpy
  thumb. Mr. Short strode away; for if anything annoyed him, it was an allusion
  to his modesty of stature.</p>

  <p>"The poor old woman is so deaf," he pronounced, in a voice quite loud
  enough to reach her, "that the villain stole behind her, while she was at the
  sink; and I dare say she never set eyes on him at all. But
  Lizzie&mdash;Lizzie must know something. And Thomas! Good heavens! is a house
  to be surprised, and robbed in broad daylight, and the people burked, and
  gagged, and not a soul be able to tell anything about it? Lizzie, come here,
  child. You have had time enough to get over your fright, and to satisfy your
  hunger. Now what was this fellow like, that 'keyed' you in the
  sermon-room?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say, sir, indeed I can't," Lizzie Aggett answered, beginning to
  whine at the remembrance of her fright; "only he was big, and black, and
  hugly. If you was to tear me in pieces with wild horses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tush!" cried the parson; "was there ever such a set of nincompoops? What
  became of Thomas, child? Is he in a trance? Was he scared off the premises?
  Did he see a vision?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, please, sir; leastways not as I knows of. But he seed a
  half-crown, laying under the laylac, by the stable-door, sir. And he come to
  ouze, and he saith, 'I must go and see, whether this here be a good coin of
  the kingdom.' And please, sir, he ain't been back; though I hollered, like a
  peg bein' killed, out of windy."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I understand. I shall have to groom <i>Trumpeter</i> myself; if he is
  to be groomed at all. Run, and see who is thumping at the back-door so."</p>

  <p>But the girl trembled so, that the vicar went himself; and there he found
  the landlord's daughter from the <i>Three Horse-shoes.</i></p>

  <p>"Oh, do please to come, sir, as soon as you can," she held up her hands,
  with urgency; "it isn't raining, anything to speak of now, sir. And your
  Thomas is that tipsy, in our bar, and laying about him with a pewter pot,
  that nobody dare go anigh him. We would send for constable, if it wasn't for
  your reverence. But father saith, to let you know, sir, first; for fear you
  should take it unkind of us. Father could tackle of him peart enow; if must
  be. But mother hold him back, by reason of the pewter pot. Your Thomas is
  a-laying about, so dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"I wish he had layed about with equal vigour here," poor Mr. Short
  muttered, as he set forth again, without a bit of food, and with wet shivers
  running through him; "bolt the door, Lizzie. Ah, I need not tell you; 'when
  the horse is stolen,' &amp;c. Don't be afraid, child. They won't come again;
  for the most rational of all reasons. The Greeks had a proverb, about the
  great difficulty experienced, even by that most ingenious race, in skinning a
  skinned dog."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; VERY FINE IDEAS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">According to many sound opinions&mdash;at variance with
  others almost as sound&mdash;the valley of the Teign, near Fingle Bridge, is
  the finest thing to look at, in the West of England. As in the vales of Lyn,
  or Barle, the rugged lines of Exmoor descend in grace; so here, the sterner
  height, and strength, of Dartmoor fall into beauty, yet preserve their
  grandeur. The windings of the great hills, as they interwend each other, come
  down with sweet obeisance to the shelter of the valley. Their rounded heights
  are touched with yellow of scant grass, or grey of rock; but under the bleak
  line, furze begins, and heather, and oak foliage. With rapid step, as must be
  down a pitch of such precipitance, the foliage slides from tone to tint, and
  deepens into darker green. But the play of lighter colours also, and the
  glimpse of silver stems, arise around the craggy openings, and birth of some
  fern-cradled rill. Far in the depth, short loops of water flash, like a clue
  to the labyrinth.</p>

  <p>All this is very fine, and may be found in many other places also. But the
  special glory of the Fingle Vale, is the manifold sweep of noble curves, from
  the north, and from the south, by alternate law, descending; overlapping one
  another, by the growth of distance, and holding up their haze, like breath
  that floats, to and fro, between them. These, with winding involution, and
  recessed embosoming, in fainter and fainter tones retire, to the dim horizon
  of the heights.</p>

  <p>A scene of beauty had many days yet for keeping its rapture to itself; and
  echoes of solemnity had not learned to exclaim&mdash;"come here, Harry," and
  "oh lawks, Matilda!" Our good British race had not yet been driven, to pant
  up hill, and perspire down dale, for the sake of saying that they had been
  there. And people, afoot for their holidays, sought the renown of each place,
  in the larder.</p>

  <p>Of this kind was Sir Joseph Touchwood; a man with no humbug about him, in
  any pursuit, except that of a contract. "Don't talk to me about your views,"
  he said to his lady, who was picking up all the picturesque expressions;
  "they don't cost a penny; and they don't bring one in. I have seen some
  hundreds of them, and was none the wiser. Lazy folk may talk about them. I
  want my dinner."</p>

  <p>"Julia, dear," began Lady Touchwood, who was always more affectionate, in
  the presence of papa; "do persuade your father, to come with us, for once. It
  would do him so much good; and he must not always slave." The young lady
  looked at her father; and perceiving by his lips, that his mind was sternly
  set, was wise enough not to run the risk of failure.</p>

  <p>"He knows best," she answered softly; "and perhaps his mind, instead of
  relaxing, would only be impatient, all the while. It is happy for us, not to
  have such a heavy sense of duty; and that he has it. But darling papa will
  not object to our having a holiday, and asking a few friends."</p>

  <p>"You may have all the world and his wife," said Sir Joseph, who was always
  cross, when hungry; "but no Champagne, mind; only the Saumur; unless Sir
  Robert Moneywig is quite sure to be there, and to bring his daughter,
  Chrysolite. After all I have done, and the style you live in, and the table
  you keep, when I am out of the way, it does seem a little too atrocious, that
  when I come home, I must keep awake till midnight, to amuse a lot of fellows,
  who have not got sixpence."</p>

  <p>Lady Touchwood, although of fervent spirit, resolved to have it out with
  him by-and-by, hoping that her daughter would come forward now, and receive a
  little check to her impertinence. But Julia saw through that manoeuvre.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why that is, papa?" she asked, with a smile sweetly void of
  satire. "It is because you are too good-natured, and so extremely amusing. Of
  course, we all do our best; but still, none of us can talk as you do."</p>

  <p>"You have not been through such things as I have," replied Sir Joseph, who
  could talk of nothing, except the weather, and the price of corn, and
  leather; "if you had, with your abilities, my dear, you could describe almost
  anything. Oh, dinner is up, is it? And high time too. If Master Richard
  appears, just tell him, he may go to the pantry; he shall not come in to us.
  There shall be punctuality in my house. When I was a boy&mdash;oh dear, oh
  dear!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Lady Touchwood&mdash;or at least she "breathed it," according
  to the fashion of expression now. Too often, Sir Joseph would flout the
  stately air of his "princely apartments," with sudden reminiscence of the
  days when he was hungry, and the things he enjoyed, with his apron on. His
  daughter always laughed, and said, "do tell us more;" but his wife, as a
  matter of duty, quenched it.</p>

  <p>"Now I do not wish you to misunderstand me," this strong-minded baronet
  took care to say; when the dinner was over, and he began to spy about (in a
  full frame of mind) for his pipe, and round chair, and the clearance of the
  women; "what I said was plain enough. If you are certain, that Sir Robert
  means to be with you, take half a dozen of the very dry champagne, and for
  the girls the sweeter stuff. No Saumur; I would not have it said; and the
  name is on the corks, confound them! I heard of it once; when I myself took
  the labels off the bottles. An idiot said&mdash;but I will not spoil my pipe.
  Under any circumstances, take champagne. Julia will count, how much there is.
  But open no 'Extra Sec,' until you see Sir Robert, and his daughter, with
  those wretched old screws they keep. Mind, I wish things to be done
  handsomely, and in accordance with my reputation; if anybody comes at all,
  who is capable of judging."</p>

  <p>"All shall be done, to the very utmost of my poor ability," his daughter
  replied, as she rose to fetch his pipe, and the ancient brass tobacco-box,
  which had cost him a penny, when pence were scarce. Then she drew towards the
  fire his favourite chair; for a fire was still a comfort, and however grand
  the room might be, where he dined, there he would have his pipe, and in no
  other chair but that. Cushions, and sloping backs, he hated, but loved this
  old ashen seat, which was not even polished, but closely railed round the
  back, and cupped in the centre, and supported by six substantial legs.</p>

  <p>Whatever might be said against Sir Joseph, his bitterest enemy, or the man
  who got the worst of him, could scarcely describe him as a "stuck-up cad;"
  for his common sense kept him from that disgrace. His "social
  duties"&mdash;as his wife and daughter called them&mdash;were the greatest
  pest of his life. He felt that he had earned, as well as needed, his nap on a
  Saturday eve, and his curtained pew on Sunday, and the bliss of not having to
  listen, while people talked of things, that concerned him not. Yet, with the
  vigour, which had led him to success, and the patience which confirmed it, he
  was ready to go into his best clothes often, and show the hospitality, for
  which the West was famous.</p>

  <p>But his strong sense of duty failed to carry him into this "Gipseying;" as
  outdoor parties away from home were called, in that more simple time. The
  money, and provisions, he would furnish, when convinced that other wealthy
  people had to do the like, and when allowed to grumble without any
  contradiction. Outside his own desk, it was his chief ambition to settle his
  daughter Julia well, for he was really proud, as well as truly fond of Julia.
  And to hear that she had enjoyed herself, and made a good figure among rich
  people, and to receive a grateful kiss from her brightly smiling lips, was
  very nearly as good to him, as a sounder investment of the cash. Therefore,
  when he got his pipe that evening, he said that I they might go as far as
  five and twenty guineas; so long as they bothered him no more about it.</p>

  <p>Miss Touchwood at once resolved, in private, to stick at nothing short of
  fifty guineas, if she could manage to spend so much; for she wished to make a
  stir in the neighbourhood, and arouse a spirit of lively competition. And she
  managed to persuade her dear papa, that this noble scheme would at once
  release him, from giving grand dinners, for a month to come, and also relieve
  him from the great-gunned assault, setting in upon the most sacred arches of
  his cellar. For a canon of Exeter had discovered (Providentially, as he told
  his wife, who said&mdash;yes, that was the proper word; for his dear
  constitution required a fillip) that, in the cellar at Touchwood Park,
  lingered still a ruby shadow of the finest vintage ever known, upon the Alto
  Douro;&mdash;the finest, but the scantiest, when the grapes were trodden by
  the war-horse. It was a wine distinctly placed far above the range of lay
  understanding; and the canon (though strongly adjured by Mrs. Botrys, to
  confine his discovery to his own bosom) in a genial discussion of some
  bottles of his own, with a brother canon, and a prebendary, frankly referred
  to that loftier standard; and a meeting of the Chapter was held, next
  day.</p>

  <p>"You may still save some of that dry old stuff, from the even dryer people
  who come after it," with such words Julia consoled her father; "by giving
  these gipseyings, instead of dinner-parties. Even a canon cannot expect port,
  so early in the day, even if it bore the carriage; and they don't know
  anything about champagne. Papa, you might get a lot at an auction, or
  smuggled, at about a pound a dozen. Nobody would suspect you, and nothing
  could be fairer. The Government try to cheat you always; and you have a right
  to cheat the Government."</p>

  <p>"Julia," said Sir Joseph, with a deep interior twinkle, which might have
  been interpreted&mdash;'instruct your grandfather in the suction of
  gallinaceous products;' "my daughter, it is better not to say such things,
  even without meaning them. Persons, not conversant with my career, and
  slow-mouthed at making, or taking a joke, would misunderstand you, and stare,
  and talk about it; whereas, if there is one rule of the very highest
  principle, it is to have no words about a contract, made for the nation's
  good, and carried out with energy. I have a bin of very ancient Hock,
  possibly a little beyond its prime. The sourer it is, the more the clever
  people smack their lips. Work it off first, my dear; you know some words of
  German; nobody else does, and it will prove your schooling. Half a pinch of
  snuff; and then the chair to put my legs up."</p>

  <p>The lady of the house was not best pleased with her daughter, for coming
  forward so. "What do you know about such things?" she asked. "If you take any
  more upon yourself, you may take all. I shall stay at home; and you may put
  all the invitations in your own name. No doubt that would be the proper thing
  to do, according to the style the chits of girls are now introducing, from
  America. Don't say another word. I won't go."</p>

  <p>This was rather awkward; but the clever girl got over it, and smoothed
  down her mother, to sweet interest in the matter. And the most delicious
  invitations, such as ladies alone can write, convinced everybody who received
  one, that the whole success of a daring enterprise hung upon his, or her,
  acceptance. And more than that, everybody wanted to be there.</p>

  <p>"Oh I do wish that I could go," cried Rose, running with a letter into
  "Naboth's Vineyard," as she wickedly called the last hobby of the captain,
  because she had not the free run of it; "it is such a glorious idea, father
  dear! And to think of my getting such a sweet invitation! All of it is done
  to please you, of course. But I know how hard you are, to please."</p>

  <p>"And how easy to displease," her father answered smiling, with his
  thoughtful face rather red from stooping; "an Ogre, a Draco, a
  child-devouring Saturn. Show me this honeyed invitation, Rosie, that my
  malice may find an outlet. By the Poles, how affectionate the lady is!
  'Darling Rose!' Whose darling are you?"</p>

  <p>"Papa, I am so glad, whenever you are jealous. But read on. Do be fair for
  once."</p>

  <p>"'Darling Rose,"' read Mr. Arthur, with well-feigned wrath, well softened
  off; "'for <i>really</i> your kindness to my <i>dear son</i> compels me to
  cast off formality&mdash;will you do us yet <i>another favour?</i> In the
  quietest of all quiet ways, and with one or two <i>delightful people</i>
  coming, chiefly dignitaries of the Church, we are going to that <i>most
  romantic</i> spot, Fingle Bridge, next Thursday. We propose to do nothing
  more than <i>look about,</i> with an interval of mild refreshment. It has
  been said that we should refresh our taste for the <i>grand and the
  beautiful,</i> more often than we do. I scarcely understand what such things
  mean; but <i>I feel,</i> when they tell me, that I am <i>bound</i> to do it.
  If <i>Captain Arthur</i> could be induced, by any sense of duty, to join us,
  how he would <i>enhance</i> our pleasure, and be able to explain, to the
  reverend gentlemen, the names of the trees, etc.! But that, I fear, is a
  <i>hopeless thing.</i> Only do coax him, for I am quite sure that you <i>can
  coax</i> irresistibly, to let <i>you</i> come to this <i>most secluded</i>
  party; and a carriage with a lady-friend of yours inside it, Miss Perperaps,
  the daughter of the doctor, will be ready for you, at your <i>private
  gate,</i> at <i>ten o'clock, on Thursday.</i> Ever gratefully, and truly
  yours, Mariana Touchwood.'" Her church-name was 'Mary Anne.'</p>

  <p>"Now it is a pretty letter, and full of generosity," Rose exclaimed, with
  the fervour of bright youth; "and so kind of them, too, to invite Sporetta. I
  like Sporetta, she is so straightforward; and if she had been at a good
  school, she would have been the cleverest girl you can conceive. Oh, how I do
  wish, I could go!"</p>

  <p>"Stop! Here is a postscript about your friend. 'We have not asked Spotty
  yet, and do not mean to do so, unless we hear that you will join us. Julia
  Touchwood.' What do you say to that, my child?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think that whoever put that in must be candid, and truthful, but
  not very nice. Miss Touchwood is a very great beauty, I believe; but I don't
  think I should like her. As regards Master Dicky, they owe poor Spotty, at
  least a hundred times as much, as they owe me. And they should have invited
  her, first of all. I don't care at all, about going now, among such
  ungrateful people."</p>

  <p>"You are a most hot-headed little creature," Mr. Arthur answered, though
  his smile undid his censure; "but look at it in another way, my dear.
  Possibly Miss Perperaps longs to go most awfully (according to the phrase
  they all use now, but which I especially object to), and if you decline, you
  destroy her chance."</p>

  <p>"But, papa, I was sure that you would never let me go."</p>

  <p>"Oh then, that was why the grapes were sour! My darling, I cannot bear to
  rob you of every enjoyment, for the short time such enjoyment lasts. You have
  never seen the loveliest spot round Dartmoor; and I think that you ought to
  go, for your friend's sake. Neither of you has much change of scene, or
  chance of harmless pleasure. I particularly wish you to go, my Rosie."</p>

  <p>Filial duty was her strongest point, and she could not bear to ask for
  money. Her father also, being light of cash, and a man of rather lofty
  temperament, took a large and distant view of the things belonging to the
  outward female, and too often absorbing the inward one. Now and again, he
  would give her a bit of something to match with her sweet pretty self, and he
  praised the results of her own handiwork; but a good round sum, to go to
  Exeter, and sit down with, on one of those wondrous high shop-stools, was not
  beyond his compass only, but wholly in the vacant distance of imagination.
  The subject demands even less to be touched with extremest reservation, than
  to be run away from, by people who have not studied it. And the safest thing
  is to quote feminine verdict, in a question for female jury.</p>

  <p>"Lor a' mussy," Mrs. Pugsley cried, when the young lady went through a
  process of careening, after the accident at Moreton; "Tim, her hathn't got a
  hook and eye, about her!"</p>

  <p>Husbands, in a great degree, fathers, in a greater one, are well content
  with their own contentment; the which is a saving virtue. "Gew-gaws utterly
  spoil your appearance," they declare right nobly; "take my word for it, my
  darling, that nothing could improve you." But the darling likes to take other
  words as well, and is reasonable in doing so; while they all despise
  extravagance.</p>

  <p>"Father has stumped up a five pound note. I knew where it was, and I gave
  him no peace," said Spotty to Rose, while there yet was time to make up
  things, if you could only get them. "What do you think, I said to him, dear,
  when he took the key out of his box, with a bang? And I knew very well, who
  put him up to it. She is in such a way about not being asked, that I only get
  cheese-rinds for supper, ever since. I said, 'Very well; it is no concern of
  mine. I don't care twopence how I look. I shall go with Dicky Touchwood's
  bandages on. They came from the valends of the broken down bedstead. And
  there is quite a beautiful fringe to them. Starched up, and plaited, they
  will look quite grand. And perhaps Master Dicky will not recognize them. If
  he does, he will know they are in the bill.' I wish you could have seen my
  dear parent's face. But I am very glad you did not hear what he said. How
  much is the captain going to stump up?"</p>

  <p>"My father has a very large mind," said Rose, who could not help laughing,
  though sadly shocked; "I never dream of speaking to him, in such a
  manner."</p>

  <p>"They have all got large minds, to save their pockets," answered the
  impious Sporetta; "but you can't go, in anything you have got. Tell the
  captain, you will go with your nightgown on."</p>

  <p>"Miss Perperaps, if you talk so coarsely, I shall decline to go with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Go in sack-cloth and ashes. I will sit on the box, and leave
  you all the inside. That stuck-up Julia will be delighted, to see you look
  such a perfect fright. She knows you are ten times prettier than she is. And
  she is after some young fellow, who dotes on you. Oh my! Wouldn't I try to
  cut her out, if the Lord had made me handsome?"</p>

  <p>Miss Arthur did her utmost to repel such low ideas; and she would not even
  deign to ask, about any gentleman, called "a young fellow." Without any
  arrogance, and purely from her own distinct ideas of right, and
  wrong&mdash;which come down, in questions of behaviour, to be called good
  manners, and bad manners&mdash;she had found that Spotty Perperaps did not
  suit her. And no low taunts, about being a frump, or a dowdy, had any effect
  upon her mind, whenever she brought it up strictly to the question.</p>

  <p>"Come down, Rosie, here is a box for you," her father shouted up the
  stairs one day, when she was doing Arachnoid work, in the quarters of a
  Sunday frock that suffer most from piety; "tenpence to pay, and you to pay
  it; and Master Pugsley vows that he can't afford to book it. Hunt up your
  purse, and come down, and pay; if you will do things so recklessly."</p>

  <p>"I have not got tenpence in the world," cried Rose; "how very unkind it is
  of people! It must be the old books, I left behind; and I am sure they are
  not worth tenpence. But I have got fourpence, if you can only manage to lend
  me sixpence, till next time."</p>

  <p>"What a fine expression!" Mr. Arthur answered, looking up the stairs
  impatiently; for he enjoyed, like a child, the assault of pleasure; "when
  will next time be? Come down, and have it out with the carrier."</p>

  <p>"Niver you be in a hoory, Missy," Pugsley advised, in his leisurely way.
  "I be allays in a hoory, and my life gooth out o' me, by rason of dooty; but
  you be young. It's Pugsley here, and Pugsley there, till there bain't a
  button of me left, to answer. Lor, if I wor to go and cut a cord like
  that&mdash;wutt be you about, Miss Rosie? There have been gunpooder, at the
  tail of Teddy."</p>

  <p>"That makes him go so fast, I suppose," said Rosie, who was getting much
  excited by this time; "my scissors won't go through this cord. I am not going
  to pay tenpence for nothing; and you may take it back, and try to get twenty
  pence, at the other end. That is the law of it, about the letters."</p>

  <p>"Her dothn't know nort about the law; no more nor I do. Please to pay up
  the tenpence, Missy. I be vast to-day, I be." The carrier favoured the
  captain with a wink.</p>

  <p>"The only way you can be fast," she answered, "is when you stick fast; as
  you did the other day. What makes you in such a dreadful hurry now? You shall
  have the tenpence, if the things are worth it."</p>

  <p>"Many's the time it hath been my lot," Master Pugsley went on heavily, "to
  carr' tuppence-worth, and have to ax tew shillin'&mdash;presents and
  sichlike, from rich folk to poor ones. But carryer must have 's money, all
  the zame, whether a' bringeth good vally, or no. Please goo, and vetch the
  tenpence, Missy. Teddy can't baide no longer."</p>

  <p>"I never knew you show such a mean, greedy, avaricious spirit. Oh, I beg
  your pardon, heartily, and humbly! I had no idea that you could play a part
  so well."</p>

  <p>Master Pugsley exploded, as none can explode, but a Devonshire man, who
  has corked himself down, and corded his cork on a joke of his own brewing,
  mellow, well-seasoned, and full of body. "Wull'e strike, agin' paying the
  tenpence now?" he asked, with the tears of laughter reddening on his cheeks,
  from the purple ground they ran upon; though a fine sense of humour would
  have scarcely bred a smile, out of that common material, surprise. But Rose,
  instead of joining in his laugh, was hard put, not to burst into tears; such
  a power of shame arose, through her delight; because she had been cross at
  pure kindness.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry&mdash;it was all your fault. I never saw anything so
  lovely, in my life. Oh, father, you must have spent a hundred pounds! I don't
  deserve a thread of it. Do let them take it back. It is only fit for some
  great Princess."</p>

  <p>"It is fit for you, my child; and you for it. Or at any rate, I hope, the
  things will fit you. I had not the least idea, in my stupid way, that you
  were so badly off for clothes. But good Mrs. Pugsley has enlightened me; and
  your kind school-mistress managed all the rest. So now run away. Let Moggy
  take the box up; and by-and-by, come and show me, how you look."</p>

  <p class="first">It is too hard upon a quiet little village (where everybody
  knows, twice a day, how everybody else's cough is; and scarcely can the most
  industrious woman find anything to say, that she has not said thrice)
  suddenly to be swept off its legs, by a hurricane, a water-spout, an
  earthquake, and a thunderbolt, all coming down upon it, in one clap. To say,
  that Christowell suffered all these things at once, would be scarcely true
  perhaps, at any rate for the present; although they were soon to come bodily.
  But even now a heavy strain was put on the constitution of society; and folk
  who had scarcely had a thing to talk of, going on now for a twelvemonth
  (except the Post-office, and its insolence), were now flung into this deeper
  pit&mdash;that they did not know, what to talk of first. Who can deny, that
  this is by far the more dangerous of the two extremes?</p>

  <p>There are, in history, periods when the popular verdict is of value; but
  these are of very rare occurrence, and are not to be forced, by most
  dexterous use of the powerful implement of Samson. Good men may be knocked
  down, by that, and bad ones hoisted into their seats, and the rogues prevail,
  by the prevalence of fools. But, upon the heels of pale ignominy, ruddy
  dignity returns at last; and the nation pays cheerfully an enormous price,
  for recovering the power of blushing. Because it feels itself, to be again a
  nation.</p>

  <p>Not far otherwise, at Christowell, faction (headed by the cobbler, tailed
  by the tailor, and stomached by the tripeman) had wriggled up a wretched
  little insurrection, against faith, honour, and dignity. But no sooner had
  the people seen what such things led to, by the insolent robbery of the
  vicarage, and the cording and colandering of a female (whose tongue was
  universally respected), than a wholesome, and hearty revulsion ensued.
  Trickey, (who had long ago been waxing over-haughty and vamping himself up,
  with office, and stamping on the young Queen's head, destroying of her
  picture,) had aided, and abetted the felony, to the utmost of his power, by
  delivering the letter, which alone had prevented the parson from shooting the
  perpetrator. The tripeman, in spite of all the rain, had been out with his
  dog-cart; and that looked bad. And though the tailor had stayed at home, he
  knew best what his reason was. As soon as the planks across the water, (which
  the flood had washed away), were replaced, unanimous opinion met upon them;
  and the men sat down, to let the women use their voices. And by such means,
  everything became so clear, and the merits of the vicar so victorious, that
  if any of the three anti-clerics had been up to "Malicious
  height"&mdash;which has since come down&mdash;the constable in the next
  parish but one, who went to Petty Sessions, would have heard of it.</p>

  <p>Even as no man can be looked at, without having knowledge of
  it&mdash;though it be but the spinal seam of his coat, that receives the
  impact&mdash;so these three men, before any of the others had smoked a pipe,
  perceived the feeling in the air about them. They met together, and then came
  out, laying aside all sense of rank, and even of money owing to them, in
  their strong indignant manhood; which grew more indignant, as conscious
  debtors grew more determined not to see them. Suppressing successfully all
  sentiments of cash, they addressed the public, which already was ashamed; for
  the three men had their best coats on; and what they said, was to the
  purpose, and without a wasted word.</p>

  <p>"Dothn't Mother Aggett zay, 'twor a gentleman, as dooed it?"</p>

  <p>"Her doth; her doth. Her be zure of that," the public, from all its
  planks, replied.</p>

  <p>"And hath Mother Aggett had oppurtoonity, to jidge of a gentleman, when
  her zees 'un?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, that her hath. Her hath a' been in vaine vam'lies, let alone Passon
  Shart's."</p>

  <p>"Well then, doth ere a wan of us dree zim laikely to be taken for a
  gentleman? Spak the Lord's truth, and no lies now."</p>

  <p>"Never a wan of 'e; by a blaind man, nor a deaf 'un; lave alone a 'ooman,
  as hath lived in vam'lies."</p>

  <p>Without another syllable, of reasoning or reproof, the cobbler, the
  tailor, and the tripeman turned, and marched all abreast to the <i>Three
  Horse-shoes;</i> and shame alone stopped their calumniators, from hastening
  after them, to drink their health.</p>

  <p>But this episode, instead of allaying, served only to enlarge the ferment;
  and the scores of rumours, that took wing daily, proved&mdash;if such a thing
  requires proving&mdash;that the slow mind is the most inventive. All,
  however, was invention; without a stroke of discovery; even though there were
  as yet no police, round Dartmoor, to handcuff discovery. And Mr. Short, in
  his brief way, said that detection is like dining; if a man wants it done, he
  must do it for himself.</p>

  <p>In this fine spirit, he resolved to go, though most people said that he
  ought to stop at home, to the party of distinguished gipseys, about to encamp
  at Fingle Bridge. "A vast amount of chaff must be met somehow," he thought,
  with a knowledge of that material, partly derived from his dealings therein;
  "and I had better meet it in the lump. They will shoot their brilliant flight
  so thick, as to knock one another out of aim. I shall fail to understand
  them; till they explain their jokes. And a joke expounded, is a joke
  confounded. And it will be a treat, worth a lot of heavy banter, to see Rose,
  and Julia, meet."</p>

  <p>Discharging his duty still, as parson of the parish, he had been to see
  Miss Arthur's new apparel; a foretaste of which had astonished him in church.
  And superficial though his learning was, in matters of that high nature, or
  art, he had contrived to give, as well as to find, a refreshment of soft
  pleasure. For the maiden's innocent delight (not only in comely, and tasteful
  attire, but also in her own fitness for it, and above all, in her father's
  loving kindness) was enough to please any but a very churlish person, and to
  tempt forth many a smile of praise. Captain Larks looked on, with
  resignation; having heard the same things said, fifty times now, and making
  his mind up to complain of tautology, when he had heard them a hundred
  times.</p>

  <p>"Suppose, it should be a most lovely morning, as lovely as even this
  <i>liliet</i> of something," said Mr. Short, while Rose turned round, to
  escape a tea-leaf on the carpet; "and then when everybody is up on the hill,
  where there is not a furze-bush for umbrella&mdash;one of our Dartmoor storms
  comes on."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Short, you have sent such a shiver&mdash;I mean, you have
  startled me so sadly. And you are always right, about the weather. Please to
  say, that you do not mean it."</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me to foretell such woes: I never pretend to know
  anything, about the character of the day after to-morrow. Even to-morrow has
  beaten me now; for I never expected that day of deluge, when my little house
  was robbed. But somebody else did, and made a fine thing of his weather-lore.
  Whoever it was, he foresaw a great rain; for the letter was posted the day
  before, and he knew that my house would have no one near it; he sent me away,
  and the place was at his mercy. He knew more of the weather, than I do."</p>

  <p>"That alone ought to supply some clue," Mr. Arthur broke in upon their
  lighter talk; "or at any rate, it restricts your search. It must be some
  fellow, almost living on the moor, and out of doors perpetually, who can beat
  you and me, in the weather signs. I know them pretty well; you know them
  better; but the weather beat both of us that day. I would have bet ten to
  one, especially after the way I saw the trout rise, that the day would be
  fine; but now I remember,&mdash;yes, I saw some worms expecting; and a frog
  had got his hind-legs crossed."</p>

  <p>"When the tadpoles go up and down&mdash;" said Rose. "But who are we, or
  who are they, to beat all men of the loftiest science, with centuries of
  instruments to help them? It seems too bad, that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You had better wait, my darling," Mr. Arthur said, for fear of her turn
  of mind becoming scientific&mdash;the uttermost disaster that can befall a
  female; and Rose was already beginning to know a barometer, from a
  thermometer, and the north-east wind, from the south-west; "my Rose, you had
  better wait a little, and consult the tadpoles, instead of Mr. Short."</p>

  <p>"The tadpoles know a great deal more than I do," the vicar acknowledged,
  with the candour of a man, who has been mistaken lately; "but they turn to
  croakers; and I will not. Let us hope for weather, as lovely as all the
  pretty things, that will be there."</p>

  <p>When the day came, there were many pretty things "come to see, and to be
  seen"&mdash;according to one of those grand "examples," which abide in the
  mind, when the rule is lost, in the dissolution of Syntax. But though a round
  dozen&mdash;and round they were&mdash;of Devonshire beauties came to the
  scratch (to adopt Mr. Short's low metaphor), all, except every single one of
  them in private, confessed that they were only fit to hold a candle, to Julia
  Touchwood, and Rose Arthur. Upon such a question, a good bold statement is
  better than elaborate description. And, as to the palm betwixt those twain,
  Julia was sure that she ought to have it, but wanted to get her opinion
  confirmed; while Rose, without dreaming of any competition, admired Miss
  Touchwood's dress, very, very candidly.</p>

  <p>When they met, in a beautiful path of the wood, with the officious Dicky
  fetching them, there really was a nice piece of manners, as well as a pretty
  interview. Either had heard of the other so much, and formed such imaginary
  portraits, that both were a little excited; but one thought it wise to
  conceal that condition; while the other never thought about it.</p>

  <p>Julia Touchwood had long intended to be "garbed with simplicity," at this
  feast of nature; or as our best authorities express it, to be "dressed with
  studious plainness." But her mother, with the eagle-eye of the superior sex,
  had found a hole in this, or made one. "You want to look, as if you were not
  come out. You may try that, after thirty; but at your age, you should try to
  look older."</p>

  <p>"I shall suit myself," the young lady replied; and truly she had done it.
  She was just in that interval of the ages&mdash;if such an interval there
  be&mdash;when the velvety half of the human race take superior views of
  apparel. Therefore, it was not to please herself, but others, that she had a
  new costume from Paris imported by her father, and so refulgent, that the
  customhouse people winked every eye.</p>

  <p>"How charming it is to discover you, at last!" Miss Touchwood exclaimed to
  the sweet simple Rose, as if she had lit upon a flower in a hedge-row. "You
  have been so wonderfully kind to my dear brother! Dicky, be off. We want to
  talk." Dicky made a face, and desired to stop. But the weight was against
  him, and he had to go.</p>

  <p>"But I have always been at home," said Rose, as quiet, and truthful, as
  her pearl-grey dress, which was of some material unknown to Julia, soft, and
  supple, and of mild sub-lustre, yet void of shrinking, and fast not to run;
  "I have always been at home, Miss Touchwood; except on the day, when you
  happened to call upon us. And you understood, that I could not call on
  you."</p>

  <p>"I did not expect you; and that makes it all the kinder, on your part, to
  be with us to-day. I hope to introduce you to some very famous people. Their
  names might frighten you; but when you come to talk to them, they scarcely
  seem to know anything at all; or if they do, they keep it very close. I
  always expect to be amused. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I have never thought about it, in that kind of way. It is so seldom that
  I go from home. And at home I have so many things to do. If you will kindly
  allow me, I shall be much happier, without being introduced. There are
  several people whom I know here; quite enough to keep me from feeling lonely.
  And this place is so lovely, that it seems a shame to talk."</p>

  <p>"Why that was the principal thing we came for," Miss Touchwood answered,
  with a lively smile; "but you shall do just as you like; unless the bishop
  comes, as he half promised to do, if his many engagements allowed it. If he
  does, you must be presented to him; because it is lucky for young
  people."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know the bishop very well indeed; he has always been most kind to
  me. If he comes, I shall go at once, and see him."</p>

  <p>Julia, with all her good manners, could not help looking, and almost
  expressing, her surprise; while Rose coloured deeply, not because of the
  bishop, but through fear that she might have spoken rashly.</p>

  <p>"She has told a great fib," was Miss Touchwood's inference, sped by her
  sense of a small one of her own; for she knew that the bishop could not come,
  and fancied that Rose might know it too. However, she only said, "Oh, you
  know him? How delightful he is, when he likes to be! And he does love trout.
  Have you heard of my clever brother Richard's scheme? A diversion, in the
  best sense of the word. Mr. Short is in such a fume about it! Has Dicky told
  you? He is in such glory!"</p>

  <p>"He is full of ideas," said Rose most gravely; at which the other laughed
  most merrily. "Yes, he is indeed; when he could not shake his foot, he spent
  most of his time in inventing."</p>

  <p>"No wonder he talks about you so much, because of your noble faith in him.
  He has invented one thing, I believe, the only thing he ever will invent; and
  that is perpetual motion. What a plague he must have been to you! He wears me
  out of my wits sometimes, even when he ought to be as tired as a pack-horse.
  But his present invention is not his own, or at least it seems much too good
  for him. It certainly is a very fine idea; for it helps on the day, at so
  many turns. He wanted to bring fifty terriers here, and treat all the canons
  to a rat-hunt; but of course we would not hear of that. So he struck out this
  new light, which promises much excitement. People call him stupid; but I do
  not. If he were stupid, could he get at least fifty rough men to admire him,
  and to obey his orders?"</p>

  <p>"He has an extraordinary gift of being liked," said Rose, with a smile,
  for she liked him herself; "especially with the labouring men. Our man,
  Samuel Slowbury, very rarely indeed is wide awake. But your brother formed a
  friendship&mdash;I beg your pardon, an acquaintance with him; and Sam can
  scarcely sleep, if 'Squire Dicky's' name is mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Just so; that is the state of feeling in our house, and round it. And he
  has taken advantage of it, to order his army in this direction. At the
  hoisting of a flag where the two paths meet, at least five-and-twenty men are
  to descend from Cranbrook Castle, where they keep their beer, with shovels,
  and two-bills, and all that, on their shoulders. And nobody is to know what
  they are to do, until they have done it, and the result is ours. I hope I
  have roused your curiosity. But if you meet Mr. Short, try not to ask him;
  for he thinks it a hundred-fold worse than the lashing of his Mrs. Aggett to
  the stake&mdash;I mean the pump. I must run away now; but I shall look for
  you again; and don't forget your promise about the bishop. I shall send some
  one, to keep you in view. You have got your sketch-book; I shall claim
  one."</p>

  <p>Rose, being left to herself, or at least with none but strangers
  sauntering near, turned up a steep, and zigzag path, which seemed likely to
  lead to a fine view up the valley. Here she was obliged to be very careful,
  as her pretty dress was in frequent peril; but without mishap, she gained a
  corner, where a glorious opening shone. At the just height, and the proper
  turn, to catch the long avenue of winding vale, a grassy knoll gave
  standing-place, and the obstruction of the wood sank down into copse, that
  only paved the foreground. With a short breath of wonder, and a long one of
  delight, Rose stopped, and sat down by a low whortle-bush, with a pink frill
  still adorning it. Before her were folded, and unfolded, the long hazy
  windings of the Fingle vale, the loveliest view that had ever filled her
  eyes. The perfection of beauty made her sad; she threw down her useless
  drawing-book, and hung upon the turn of thought for tears.</p>

  <p>Suddenly vigorous steps came near, firm steps that sounded not unknown;
  and before she had time to look bright, and thoughtless, a young man was
  gazing at her, with profound surprise. Good manners told him haply not to
  notice her confusion; but love, and love's sympathy, got the better of good
  manners, or in nature bettered them. Without formality, he took her hand, as
  if she wanted caring for.</p>

  <p>"Why are you sitting like this, all alone? And with tears in your eyes!
  Have any of those stupid people dared to be rude to you? Or has that poor
  little Hop o' my Thumb&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, he has been very good," she answered, forgetting that she should have
  asked, who was meant. "I am as happy as possible here. Every one has been
  most kind to me. I did not expect to see you, Mr. Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"And I scarcely hoped that you would be here. I knew that you had been
  invited, but&mdash;well, I came in the forlorn hope of it. Is your good
  father here? I fear not; because you are never far apart."</p>

  <p>"No, there was no chance of his coming. If he went out once, he would have
  to go always, because everybody likes him so. Lady Touchwood would have been
  more delighted than she could describe, as she very kindly told me; but it
  was useless to think of such a thing. Now wasn't it kind of him, to let me
  come?"</p>

  <p>"That it was; especially to me. You know, your father is always most kind
  to me. And he told me, that he liked me."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that he did that? It does not sound like his way at all. I
  never knew him say that to anybody." Rose looked up doubtfully; but Jack was
  sure about it.</p>

  <p>"You must not tell him that I boasted of it, because he would think me so
  conceited; and perhaps it would set his mind against me; which I do hope you
  would never try to do. I never yet saw any one I liked so much&mdash;I mean
  of course counting up the gentlemen I know, and leaving out the
  ladies&mdash;as your dear father, my dear Miss Arthur. And he certainly felt
  some good-will towards me; though not to be spoken of,&mdash;I mean, not to
  compare with my intense admiration, and affection for him."</p>

  <p>"But you have only seen him once!" said Rose, looking, as if her father
  ought to produce these grand impressions at a glance, but did not always do
  so; "how can you have managed to understand him so entirely?"</p>

  <p>"Because the gift runs in our family," he answered, with the vigour which
  comes of believing a thing. "My father has got it twice as much as I have,
  because he has seen so much more of the world. He is down the hill now. He
  finds his legs a little stiff. He has been a good deal shot about, and
  bayonetted in three places. But he wants to come up, if there is anything to
  see; and he sent me on first, to make sure of it. Please to stay here, just
  where you are; and look like yourself, when he comes up; I will have him
  here, before you have time to think about him. It takes a long time to think
  about him."</p>

  <p>"How fond he does seem to be of his father! And how much he admires mine!"
  thought Rose; "it is a very rare thing, they say, to meet with such high
  principles now."</p>

  <p>Not only did this young man now take stand on a very high level of
  principle, but he carried out with vigour filial duty, and helped his father
  up the hill. Almost before Miss Arthur could get into a nice indifferent
  state, and absorb her mind upon the landscape, John Westcombe came into view
  again, with one end of a long stick in both hands, and his dear father's hat
  at the other end rising. "Stiff work, stiff work; don't pull too hard. It is
  worse than any Spanish mountain," the elder gentleman panted forth; "don't be
  in such a hurry, my dear Jack. We have got all the day before us."</p>

  <p>"Allow me to introduce," said Jack, excited beyond all filial bounds, "my
  dear father, Colonel Westcombe. Miss Arthur, this is Colonel Westcombe!"</p>

  <p>"Lugged in at the utmost disadvantage," said the colonel, labouring to
  make a flourish. "But, bless my heart, I know you, my dear! Shake hands,
  while I think how I came to know you."</p>

  <p>"I am certain," said Rose, with her bright blushing smile, as he took both
  her hands, and admired her, "that if I had ever met you before, sir, I should
  not have forgotten you."</p>

  <p>"And yet I have forgotten you? Well put! That would be a disgrace to me.
  No; I suppose it was but a fancy. My memory begins to play me tricks. But if
  I do not know your face, I know its expression; and it does me good. It does
  me good to look at you, my dear, and to think of the days when I was young.
  There are very few lovely faces now. The young ladies are so pert, and
  forward; and that spoils the prettiest face in the world. Have you been
  drawing? And may we see it?"</p>

  <p>"No; I could not even tell where to begin. I can only draw a barn, or a
  linhay, or a stile; great distance, and grandeur, are beyond me altogether. I
  know what I can do; and what I can't."</p>

  <p>"Then," replied the colonel, who rejoiced in common sense, "you know the
  most important thing, there is for us to know. It is just what the young
  ladies never seem to know now; nor even the old gentlemen. I am very much
  afraid my son will tell you, that I don't, for one. As for him, he does not
  know what he can do; and he is too bashful to find out."</p>

  <p>"I like to hear my father talk," said Jack; who had been observing, with
  intense delight, the conquest of the colonel, by the maiden of his love; "he
  positively hates conceit, and no one can have less of it than he has. Yet one
  of the foremost objects of his life, seems to be&mdash;to make me
  conceited!"</p>

  <p>"We must not trouble you, at first sight," his father said to Rose very
  gravely, meaning thereby to rebuke his son, for intruding family politics,
  though himself had set the example; "with such little discussions, as we have
  at home. When we have the honour of knowing you better, there will be time
  enough for that. But why are you sitting here all alone? Has any jealousy on
  Julia's part&mdash;I mean have they contrived, for some young ladies are not
  entirely above all tricks, to put you aside, to shelf you&mdash;as we say,
  with any one no longer wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Quite the contrary. I ran away. I am so accustomed to be alone. A crowd
  of strangers bewilders me. I have scarcely begun to enjoy this view yet. Have
  you ever seen anything more beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"Never; at least of its own special kind. But we are interfering with your
  enjoyment. It was not my fault, it was my son's; though I must not blame him,
  for so pleasant a surprise. But promise me one thing, if you are not engaged,
  allow me to take care of you, when we meet by-and-by. I don't know what the
  arrangements are. But after the great engineering scheme, the fires will be
  lighted, and some cookery ensue. I mean, if the rain should have the manners
  to keep off. My old friend, Short, says that it will pour before six o'clock;
  and he is nearly always right. We must hope for the best. What would all the
  ladies do?"</p>

  <p>Rose promised gladly to place herself in such good care; and upon that
  pledge, they left her, and returned to the gay folk in the valley.</p>

  <p>"Now you understand why I brought you up," John Westcombe said, as they
  were going down the hill. "That is the young lady, I mean to marry; that is
  to say, if I can. If I don't, I shall marry nobody."</p>

  <p>"I never heard you speak like that before, and I think you might have
  asked my leave, or (if that is out of date) my opinion at least," his father
  replied, rather sharply for him, "You remind me of our great commander. She
  is a very sweet, and charming girl. But I must know a great deal more about
  her. How did you make her acquaintance, my boy?"</p>

  <p>Jack told him all about it, and all that he could tell, without breaking
  his pledge to Mr. Arthur; and the colonel's brave eyes shone with softness,
  when he heard of what Rose had done. "A noble girl! A most noble girl! I am
  not surprised at your infatuation, Jack," he exclaimed as he shook his son's
  hand again; "but you must not be in such a hurry. Such maidens are not to be
  won in a moment. Moreover, I must know more about her, or at any rate about
  her father. Keep out of sight, for the rest of the day; and leave her to me
  entirely. I shall manage better than you would."</p>

  <p>This arrangement was not at all to the liking of the younger gentleman;
  but he could not oppose it with any good grace, when his father had just been
  so kind to him. But before he had time to think much about that, or make any
  promise about it, a great patch of yellow was seen betwixt the branches,
  waving and flapping, over Fingle Bridge. "It must be a flag of 'keep away,'
  as we used to call it," said the old soldier to his son; "perhaps there are
  gipseys there, and small-pox."</p>

  <p>"No, it is a flag of 'come on;' a signal for the men on the hill, and for
  us to assemble. The 'great piece of sport,' as Dicky Touchwood calls it, or,
  as Mr. Short describes it, 'the atrocious bit of poaching,' is now to come
  off, for our enjoyment. That flag is the handkerchief of Canon Botrys, a
  bandana as large as a table-cloth. He is famous for them, and for his
  knowledge of port wine."</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe felt a deep interest in this, for he always liked to
  follow up such questions, and had often heard of Canon Botrys. "He deserves,
  then, to fly his own flag," said he.</p>

  <p>But no time remained for discussion of the canon's merits, or of even more
  important subjects; for spectacle, and action, at short notice, took the
  place of dialogue.</p>

  <p>"You are not to go, until they have begun. I beg of you, ladies, to be
  good enough to keep back; you will be in the way, and get frightfully
  splashed," Dicky Touchwood was shouting, again and again; but the ladies were
  determined to be in good time, and were zealously hurrying one another. For
  Dicky had been too proud of his scheme, to keep his own counsel about it.</p>

  <p>"If you will only wait a quarter of an hour," he cried in despair, as the
  ladies still rushed on, "I will have a path cut for you, such a nice path,
  that you will be able to get along, without the least danger to your dresses.
  But now&mdash;oh, dear, there will be such a lot of mending!"</p>

  <p>At this, the ladies only laughed, and bore on all the faster; and a saucy
  girl called back to ask, if he thought she had never been in a wood till
  now.</p>

  <p>"There won't be a fish, not a single minnow even, if you go ten steps
  further. Upon my word and honour, it is too bad, after all my trouble, to be
  laughed at!" So hot was his wrath, that he strove to get in front of the
  ladies, to bar the way; but the track was so narrow, and the ground so steep,
  that without a rude push he could not do it. And Dicky was more polite than
  they, as a host, and a gentleman must be. But suddenly, the ladies met their
  match.</p>

  <p>A shortish old man, with hedger's gloves on, and a rip-hook swinging in
  one hand, confronted the fair troop at a sharp corner, where the narrow path
  overhung the river. "Yew baide there, till nex' taime," said the old man,
  planting a sheep-hurdle, stuffed with furze and briar, under the saucy young
  lady's nose, and proceeding to lash it, with tough oak frithles, to a pair of
  stout ash-saplings; "so zoon as Maister Dicky hath had one of 'e a bit, a'
  wull know better than to razon wi' a vemmel." Having fastened his hurdle at
  the foot as well, John Sage proceeded with some more important work; and the
  ladies confessed themselves beaten, for the moment.</p>

  <p>"The wood is full of vipers newly hatched," they said to one another, with
  their usual knowledge; "and even if one could get out of their way, there is
  no getting through the vile brambles." So they made up their minds, that
  there was nothing worth seeing. Nevertheless they were all very angry, or at
  any rate, pretended so to be; until they were called to their first
  refreshment, which proved most satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"Now come and see my engineering," cried Dicky, running down the path, in
  a reek of mud and water, as one who had been labouring, the while they were
  indulging; "no pop-stuff for me, no thank you! One glass of ale, and I am off
  again. Mr. Short, you call yourself a great fisherman; come, and see me catch
  more in one hour, than you will catch in the whole course of your life."</p>

  <p>It was villainously true; wicked advantage had been taken of a doubt of
  the river about its course, where a violent flood had once endeavoured to cut
  short a gentle winding of the glen. "It ought to be straight," Squire
  Touchwood said, with a true Briton's love of brevity; "between its extreme
  points, it has no right to go twisting in that clumsy way. I will get the
  man's leave, and do it for him. We will invite him to see it done. It will
  improve his property ever so much; and if he behaves well, he shall have some
  fish." So Farmer Crang came down, to see what they were going to do with him;
  and he lived upon so steep a hill, that when he had to go home at night, it
  kept on knocking him on the chin, much as he tried to keep above it, while
  feeling that he meant what he had a right to do&mdash;to get to his house, at
  the top of it.</p>

  <p>But that happened later. At present, he belonged to the Rechabites, for at
  least twenty minutes, in spite of all the ladies coming up to him with
  glasses. But when he saw a cork go up, like the rising of a lark, into the
  sky, Farmer Crang said, "A' must be zumthin undernathe 'un. I winder if a'
  wud make me go up." It made him go up, for a brief elevation, and come down
  sadly afterwards.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the whole thing was a great success. Without taking anything to
  raise their colour, the ladies were refreshed into a finer peace of mind; and
  the gentlemen took heart, and tried to please them. And in excellent spirits,
  they all set off, to see the great spectacle, now prepared. For the river,
  running under Fingle Bridge, was ruddy with more than legendary slaughter, or
  muddy perhaps with the stir of many "navvies." Miss Arthur, inheriting some
  little share of her father's love of solitude, and as yet unaccustomed to
  wine and noise, had been wandering in the wood, while the luncheon went on,
  with a quiet young lady, whose acquaintance she had made; and even Jack
  Westcombe had failed to find her. But now, she came down, to see what was
  going on, for fear of being thought rude and odd. At once Miss Perperaps, who
  had been doing particularly well among the bottles, ran up and embraced, and
  scolded and fed her, and turned away the other young lady, and led her to
  behold the engineering feat.</p>

  <p>Alas the poor Teign, like the Achelöus, or the river that offended Cyrus,
  had been turned out of its ancient bed, for nearly a quarter of a mile. At
  the head of a long loop, a dam had been piled, while a channel was cut into
  the heel; the dastardly water, perpetually labouring to degrade itself most
  rapidly, rushed down the new cut, and deserted the old, with all the
  bosom-friends enshrined in it. These, in their honest faith, never could
  believe that the sweet haunts of childhood would bewray them; and they said
  to one another, as the banks went up, and their own swimming places seemed to
  go down very low, that here must be a new form of drought, beginning with
  dreadfully muddy water. But the elderly trout were not satisfied with this;
  they knew that the world is full of angles, and they hurried up and down, to
  learn the meaning of it all. Unluckily for them, they added nothing to their
  wisdom; if they went down stream, John Sage stopped them, with all his
  descendants wading gladly; if they darted up stream, things were worse, for
  thick legs in worsted stockings were puddling all the water. Therefore they
  assembled in their pools, to think about it. And this was as stupid a thing,
  as they could do.</p>

  <p>Men are so prone to think about themselves only, and from a higher view
  endowed so largely with contempt of what other beings think of them, that
  scarcely more than two minds, of all the many present, dwelt with any feeling
  on this outrage to the fish. Mr. Short was shocked, and so was John
  Westcombe, from that love of fair play, which is bred of manly sport; and
  these two would not even go to see what happened, neither would they taste a
  fish thus murdered. Rose Arthur also thought it a cruel piece of business;
  but Spotty was in ecstasy, and dragged her on to look at it.</p>

  <p>To describe such a villainous slaughter of trout, would be almost as bad
  as to share in it. Enough, and more than enough to say, that these poaching
  scamps got as much as they could carry, with two strong donkeys to help them;
  and the only piece of luck was that Canon Botrys, in his greed for stewed
  eel, got his thumb bitten through by a patriarch of that nimble race; and his
  circulation being somewhat thick, congestion ensued, and he was put upon
  gruel, without even a spoonful of crusted port to flavour it, until the
  following October. Sir Joseph Touchwood heard of it, and was truly
  thankful.</p>

  <p>But for the others there was vengeance also. Every one of them became a
  fish, or wished to be one, for several hours of his life that night. The rain
  avenged the river, not by sheer wrath only, but also by a subtlety of fine
  skill, and high finish. Astutely it began, as if meaning nothing beyond a
  drop or two to lay the dust, and to set the birds singing, and the young men
  winging their umbrellas for the maidens of their love. The leaves, now
  growing to a steadfast colour&mdash;for oak-apple day was come and
  gone&mdash;took only as many drops as they could hold; so that eyes under new
  bonnets might be lifted up, and admire them, without fear of wet response.
  "How lovely they do look in their tears!" exclaimed a young lady in sky-blue
  silk.</p>

  <p>"But I hope they won't cry too much," said Spotty.</p>

  <p>Laying aside further dread of that, when Prebendary Woolfleece (who kept a
  rain-gauge) staked his reputation on a lovely evening, all the company, full
  of bright alacrity, assembled, in the open space below the bridge, to fry
  their great hoist of fish, and cook their other dainties. Lady Touchwood (who
  had kept as much out of the way, as was possible for the feast-lady, by force
  of many good reasons of her own) came forward now, to show her daughter's
  fearful ignorance of the soundest of all accomplishments. The fires of furze
  made a beautiful blaze, succeeded by a sweet glow of embers; frying-pans
  abounded, and bladders of lard, and jars of very lightly salted butter, and
  any one, with the rudest rudiments of knowledge, was at liberty to try his
  hand, or hers, or both together. They did it; they did not care what came of
  it, because they had nothing to pay for it; and supposing a trout to be coal
  on one side, and as raw as a candle on the other, they found out some part of
  him done very nicely, and praised one another's cookery. And more
  engagements, with a view to matrimony, were made, before it began to rain
  again, than had ever been heard of in so short a time, or than parents
  approved, or than ever came to anything.</p>

  <p>In this witching hour of the time, with gentle feelings, and genial smells
  beginning to pervade the valley, and the sparkle of the sun upon the lightly
  sprinkled leaves contributing myriad playfulness, Jack Westcombe, who never
  had been capable of coping with the growth of the age in
  facetiousness&mdash;the cuckoo, that has ousted both wit, and
  humour&mdash;was looking as if he would like to take one of his hosts by the
  neck, and lay him in a frying-pan. The desire was natural, but far from just;
  for Dicky was behaving in his very best style, and for the good of the
  company. While laid up so sadly, and yet so sweetly, at Lark's Cot, he had
  found out that Rose was a ministering angel at the frying-pan, and especially
  in the last offices of trout. In right of this knowledge, he brought her
  forward to a central pan upon the embers, where the poor creatures were being
  murdered again, by an elegant lady from Exeter. But Rose, though her heart
  was aroused at such a sight, drew back, with the sensitive recoil of genius,
  until the other lady upset the frying-pan, and ran away to make a boast of
  it!</p>

  <p>Then Miss Arthur was moved beyond her wont, and resolved to do things
  properly; for the substance and spirit of good work were in her, and slur and
  waste were an outrage to her mind. Without a word of anything, she tucked her
  sleeves up, so as not to leave a crease upon them, and she asked for some
  butter with no salt in it, and a cold frying-pan without seam on the bottom.
  Bad work cannot be turned into good; any more than wrong can be turned into
  right, in this world. Men of great learning came up to help her; but she only
  bowed, and begged them not to do so. Only, for the sake of her frock, she
  accepted Archdeacon Barleycorn's offer of his "long front"&mdash;who came to
  an apron afterwards&mdash;to save her <i>liliet</i> from rockets of the fire
  capricious. Then she busked up the fire; for it is not good to have too slow
  an ember, neither to let the pan sit down on it; and then&mdash;it would be
  very unfair to say how&mdash;she fried trout, so that they were grateful. And
  (as every one who does good work, in this age of slur, gets over-worked
  immediately,) from every other bonfire, fish came pouring; and the Chapter
  came to an appetite again, by sniffing, and beholding laymen eat; and Dicky
  Touchwood was in ecstasies, and Julia loftily sarcastic. For Sir Robert
  Moneywig had just arrived, and his daughter Chrysolite shone most
  grandly.</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe watched all these things duly, in his quiet
  well-contented style; while Mr. Short bustled about among the ladies,
  allotting to every one her proper period, as if he still carried his
  grandfather's watch. After these duties, he foregathered with his friend,
  bringing a bottle of the "Extra Sec," intended for the great Sir Robert. "Now
  what do you think of those three girls," he asked, "Miss Moneywig, Miss
  Touchwood, and Miss Arthur?"</p>

  <p>The colonel, in a personal question like this, made a point of forming no
  hasty opinions; unless he was downright forced to do so, by indignation,
  admiration, or some other power that stormed his judgment. In his active
  days, he had waited to be told what he was to do; and then he always did
  it.</p>

  <p>"Short, you know as well as I do. They are all very beautiful girls," he
  said. "How is good <i>Nous?</i> Is his throat-wound gone?"</p>

  <p>"Now don't attempt to put me off, like that. I have told you all about
  him, long ago. Much credit to you, that such things should happen. They have
  made you a Justice of the Peace; and you must stir. But I will know your
  opinion of my lovely little Rose."</p>

  <p>"She is no little Rose, she is a fine tall girl, and very soon will be a
  beautiful woman. I will not say a word against the others. But even while she
  works, see how she walks! No Devonshire maid can walk like that. When I was a
  young man once in Spain&mdash;but never mind; all has been ordered for the
  best."</p>

  <p>"I should hope so. You villain, how dare you sigh? But here comes
  something, both to sigh for, and to groan; as old Farmer Pook said in church,
  when I exhorted my hearers to sigh for their transgressions. 'Dunno the way
  to zaigh,' he shouted out, for I happened to look at him, as I spoke; 'our
  vam'ly always groanies.' And here comes a groaning time for all young ladies.
  I told you all along, what it would be."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; EGYPTIAN NIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now all these people&mdash;and there must have been a
  hundred, of the polished material, and as many of the rough, according to the
  division now in vogue&mdash;had thoroughly enjoyed a very pleasant day, and
  could scarcely expect, as reasonable beings, to enjoy the night as well.
  Without slaying a black sheep, in honour of the wind, or a white one, to
  propitiate the moon, or even paying heed to weather-glass, they had ventured,
  at a risky time of year, into the stronghold of bad weather; and they did not
  even bless their stars, for the luck so far vouchsafed to them. So they
  wanted a lesson, and they got it most impressively.</p>

  <p>Having made an exemplary mistake of late, and paid for it with his
  chronometer, Parson Short (although boldly prophetic to the colonel) had
  refused to do more than shake his head, when the ladies consulted him about
  their clothes. The wisest of men loses faith in his wisdom, when it has cost
  him a lump of his tithes, and suspects a vein of irony; as the Pythia might
  have done, after failing to predict her own robbery. But now there was no
  possibility of mistake, to any one acquainted with the manner of the moor.
  "Have you brought your close carriage, as I told you?" asked the parson.</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe replied that, much as he disliked to be shut up in a box
  on wheels, he had come in his wife's carriage, both to please her, and to
  help any women who might be in trouble of the rain.</p>

  <p>"There are lots of great people here," said the parson, smiling wickedly,
  "without so much as Tim Pugsley's poke, to protect their sumptuous raiment.
  Not one of them will bear the idea of being soaked, although they all have
  courted it. The Touchwoods have two closed carriages here; but the hired
  things (such as Rose, and Spotty came in) are as open as a net; a tarred net
  is their similitude. With half an hour's rain, they drip black drops, that
  never come out, though you wash and wring, for ever. Little Rose deserves a
  better fate than that. How lovely she looks in her silver grey! She has not
  the least sense of the rain impending; and rain, and ruin, are the same word
  to her frock. She will cry; for she never had such a frock before; and she
  won't care twopence for its value perhaps, but for the disaster to her
  father's kindness. Your carriage will be besieged by mighty ladies; but they
  can afford to get tarred every day. Make Rose go with you, and put her in
  first, and dare her to come out, and put your terrier on her cloak; or else
  they will turn her out, or sit upon her lap; those ladies are such tremendous
  crushers."</p>

  <p>"Short, I have known you for twenty years," said his old friend, looking
  with surprise at him; "but you are full of unknown corners still. See to it
  all yourself. I cannot perceive any ground for rushing into action, before
  completing my dinner. One reason why we generally got off pretty well, was
  that we seldom went into action with empty bellies; as our brave foes very
  often had to do. What we had was tough; but we got through it, and were fit
  for tough work afterwards. Ah, there will never be such days again. Our
  muscles stood up, like stubs of wire, and our teeth would go through heart of
  oak. How well I remember an old Spanish cock, when I had the honour of
  dining&mdash;but perhaps, I have mentioned that to you before."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely less than fifty times. The tale has an improving tendency; and I
  wish there were time for another edition. This lamb is excellent, and eke the
  lobster. Take a bone with you, like an old campaigner; and get your horses
  in, as soon as may be. In a few minutes, there will be helter-skelter. Here
  comes the swirl of air, that outruns the storm. I will bring Rosie to the
  road across the bridge."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you get in front of Jack," called out the colonel, as the
  parson made off, with the wind behind him; "Jack must learn to do the proper
  business for the ladies. You have had your time, and let it go by. Leave Rose
  to Jack; she is too young for you. You may do the best you can, with Julia.
  Don't hurry me. I won't be hurried. What are these petty drizzles, after the
  mountain-storms I have had to encounter, for whole weeks together? True it
  is, that I was younger then&mdash;" he added, as his hat flew away into the
  river; "but never mind, I can always tie my head up. The rising generation is
  a wonder; but if they lose their hats, their heads go too. Equally hollow
  both of them."</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe very seldom said a spiteful word; but it was enough to
  vex him, to see his new beaver display no swimming power, in the rapids of
  the Teign; and to hear a loud laugh from some young fellows (meant for
  gentlemen) who, if they had been at all up to their birth, would have jumped
  into the water, and pushed one another out of it, in rivalry to help a
  white-haired man. The colonel, in reply to their laugh, bowed gravely, to
  thank them for having observed his trouble; and then, with deliberation,
  walked into the river, found his water-logged hat, and without another glance
  at them, crossed the rugged channel, to save going round by the bridge, for
  his horses. Jack Westcombe, who was watching Rose, saw by her glance that
  something was wrong in that direction; and as soon as he found out what it
  was, indignation made him act amiss. For he took the two leaders, in the
  heyday of their grin, and recalled their jocularity to their own concerns, by
  delivering them handsomely into a lively stickle.</p>

  <p>Scarcely was there time to get fairly through this, before the full brunt
  of the storm was upon them, and the valley was swept with confusion. The
  hills seemed to bow in the darkening air; and torrent wisps, like
  pitch-forked hay, covered all the lines of wood, and crag. Away went canvas,
  kettle-poles, and hampers; and not even a bottle full of stout could keep its
  heels. The ladies, who would not heed a word of warning, clung to the trees,
  and strove to bring their skirts behind them; for skirts were then worn,
  where they now have heel-flaps. Like arrows a cloth-yard long, thickened in
  with cross-bow bolts, came the flight of the rain, with a cast of blue among
  the tree-trunks, where it ran into the forest haze. Where it struck the young
  leaves, they went up, like shells, with the glazed side downward; and any
  brown folio of last year, still sticking to its musty chronicle, was whirled
  and tossed off, like a winnowing.</p>

  <p>But one of the worst things, for all the good people, who had fed on the
  fat of the land all day, and plucked every flower of the valley, was the
  rising of their ashes, into their own eyes, and teeth. Stacks of dried furze
  from the hill had been burnt, to enable them to spoil cookery, and many a
  poor tree had been harried of its young leaves, by their skeltering smoke.
  And now, being full of intelligence, they owned&mdash;whenever they found
  space for a whisper&mdash;that there is such a thing as paying dearly for
  one's roast.</p>

  <p>Young Westcombe had observed, with much vexation, that through Squire
  Dicky's manoeuvre about Rose, his own good father had been robbed of the
  pleasure of her company, at dinnertime. After all the kindness of Mr. Arthur,
  and the confidence placed in his honour, Jack had felt, throughout the day,
  that it would be mean on his part, to take advantage of this neutral ground,
  and endeavour so to steal into forbidden graces. Nevertheless, it had seemed
  quite fair to bring about, as far as might be, a feeling of good will, and
  independent liking, between the fair stranger, and the colonel. And now, when
  he saw the hope of this cut short, in the general confusion, and nobody
  coming to the aid of poor Miss Arthur, his heart burned within him, to
  redress the sad neglect. Without a moment lost, he ran up, and led her into a
  beautifully sheltered spot, where a cove of dry stone was overhung with
  fringe of ivy. "You never think twice about yourself," he said; "they have
  roasted you, and run away, and left you to get sodden."</p>

  <p>"It is not quite so bad as that," she answered, while the storm increased
  around; "I am not even wet; and if I were, it would not hurt me, except for
  my father's kindness."</p>

  <p>"How fond you are of your dear father! I am sure, I am not at all
  surprised at it. I have met him several times; and I feel as if&mdash;but he
  does not want any praise of mine."</p>

  <p>"He is far above anybody's praise," said Rose, lifting her gentle eyes
  with pride; and then for fear of seeming rude, she added,&mdash;"but I am
  very glad that you speak so; because you are so straightforward."</p>

  <p>"And what did you think of my father, if you please? You have not seen him
  at his best to-day. People of this kind put him out; because he is so
  unpretentious. I was in such a rage, when they called you away, just when my
  father would have got on well. It was too bad of that little miserable Dicky.
  I would gladly have put him on the bonfire. I hope he is drenched by this
  time."</p>

  <p>"You should not say such little things. I am sure you do not mean them. He
  is not well yet; and he is never very strong. There was such a rush of dust,
  that I cannot be sure; but I think I saw Lady Touchwood, in the distance,
  putting him into the great yellow carriage, with a tall man to take care of
  him. He requires to be well looked after."</p>

  <p>Jack Westcombe laughed, for he was greatly pleased. Young men seem to have
  no confidence at all, either in their own choice, or in the judgment of the
  chosen one; or why do they continually get so jealous of some fellow utterly
  below contempt?" You scarcely seem to share his dear mamma's opinion of him,"
  Jack became quite noble, as he cast off petty feelings; "but, Miss Arthur,
  there are many things about him, that one cannot help feeling an affection
  for. He does not give himself half the airs, that might be expected of him.
  He is very kind-hearted, and he loves his bit of sport, and he tries to set
  up a strong way of his own; if his mother, and sister, would only let him. He
  won't take to cheating, like his father,&mdash;at least, that is not what I
  ought to say; what I mean is, that he does not love commerce, and contracts,
  and those dishonest ways of getting half-a-dozen carriages. He is soft; but
  by way of contrast, I like him. Squire Dicky is not a bad fellow at all."</p>

  <p>Rose Arthur looked at Jack, as he shook his head judicially, after summing
  up in favour of Dicky Touchwood; and she wondered at his impartiality about a
  gentleman, whom he had longed so lately to put upon one of the bonfires.
  Somehow or other, she had formed great faith in the stability of this Jack;
  and now he seemed a Jack of both sides.</p>

  <p>"You must not suppose that he will ever do anything," continued the other,
  for fear of having helped to exalt his rival dangerously; "he will never do
  any good, as long as he exists. Only it is a great thing to do no harm; for
  people who have gone up so, and made a heap of money. But you have not told
  me, what you thought of my good father."</p>

  <p>"I never saw anybody I liked so much, without knowing anything about them.
  He seems to me to be of the very noblest nature; and he had just come up a
  tremendous hill!"</p>

  <p>"He can go up a hill now, every bit as well as I can," said Jack with
  filial poetic licence; "if it wasn't for his wounds, I could never overtake
  him. But that is a trifle, compared to what they say about him, in all the
  great histories. In at least three battles with the entire French army,
  everything depended upon my father; and he did it so superbly, that their
  only chance was, to run away immediately. He never mentions it; and he would
  be very angry, to think that I knew anything about it. But history is
  history, and there you find the whole of it. Though I should not have known
  half as much as I do, if it had not been for old General Punk. The general is
  a most opinionated man, and a great friend of my father's; and when anything
  is said, he shuts one eye, and just glances with the other at my father. If
  you could only see him, you would understand how our old officers conceal
  their exploits."</p>

  <p>"I have always thought, and I am quite sure now," cried Rose, blushing up
  to her long eyelashes, as she dropped them in sweet excitement, "that my
  father must have done great exploits too; because he never speaks of them. He
  was in the thickest of the war in Spain; as I know from a quantity of little
  things, about olives, and grapes, and cork-trees. But oh, Mr. Westcombe, I
  never meant to speak of it; and I beg you not to say a word about it. My
  father's desire is to live in strict retirement; as nearly all the great men
  long to do. I may trust you, I am sure, not to say a word about it."</p>

  <p>"Your father has trusted me," Jack answered, with a gaze magnanimously
  calm, and abstract, considering the state his heart was in; "I know a great
  deal more of him, than anybody else does. He said, that he could see what I
  was quite plainly; and I do not violate any confidence, in telling you that
  he liked me."</p>

  <p>It may be doubted, whether this was purely upright, on the part of Mr.
  John Westcombe. And he even felt some doubts upon the point himself, when he
  came to think of it afterwards. But for Rose to be looking at him, as she
  was, and for him to be looking at her, and knowing how seldom he got any
  chance of so doing&mdash;purely through his own uprightness&mdash;and feeling
  what a difference it made to him, even to be near her, in the very worst of
  weather; and what a thing it would be, to have made her think a little of
  him, just now and then, with a gentle bit of sympathy, and a soft curiosity
  about his thoughts&mdash;all this, in one moment, crowding in upon him so,
  left him very little time for neglecting his own interests.</p>

  <p>"If the rain would only stop," said the young lady, looking round, for
  something superior to talk of; "but it seems to be growing darker, almost
  every minute. It serves me quite right, for my selfishness in coming."</p>

  <p>"You should never say that. You did not come, to please yourself; but
  because your father wished it. Leave everything to me. I will take good care,
  that you shall get home quite dry, and very nice&mdash;though nothing could
  make you look anything but nice. Now will you be frightened, if I run away,
  for less than ten minutes; and will you promise strictly to stay here?"</p>

  <p>She laughed at the idea of being frightened; and nodded, with a pretty
  smile, her promise to stay there. "But I am so afraid that you will get wet!"
  she said, with a glance worth a thousand thorough duckings. In fear of making
  answer too impulsive, Jack kissed his hand, and set forth into the storm,
  wishing hotly that there was a hurricane, or deluge, to meet for her sake,
  and to shield her from. And she came to the corner of the shelter, and peeped
  round, with her beautiful hair scattered down the outward shoulder, and her
  hat blown back, and the carmine of the wind striking the oval of her gentle
  face.</p>

  <p>"Go back," he shouted; and she obeyed him, and thought of him, the whole
  time that she was left alone.</p>

  <p>The age of our country was already falling into that querulous dotage of
  finicking, now so universal in the toothless time; but still a young
  Englishman was ashamed, to put himself under an umbrella; though now his only
  shame is, to have one too large to be taken for more than his essential
  parasol. Jack never knew&mdash;for love was still existing&mdash;whether it
  rained, or blew, or thundered, or whether an earthquake was running in the
  neighbourhood. The only occupation of his mind was, to consider the doings of
  Rose, and the sayings of Rose, the lookings of Rose, and the thinkings of the
  same, whenever they were not past finding out. And he never said to
  himself&mdash;"I may be a fool;" the wisdom, or the folly, of himself was
  never mooted. His heart was gone entirely beyond his mind's discussion; and
  the two agreed to let it be; so long as they were happy.</p>

  <p>"Why, Jack, my boy, you look as if you had just come across an angel," Mr.
  Short exclaimed, in his unromantic style, as Westcombe rushed in, among a
  score of people fighting for a dry place, until they got their carriages;
  "come along a little way, and I will introduce you to Canon Botrys, and our
  good Archdeacon. Young men should never miss an opportunity. I know a man who
  got a living, because his handkerchief was dry. You ought to be in orders,
  and you shall be yet; because it is too late for anything else. They are
  under a wall; and they have got nice daughters. You will go away, without
  having seen a single soul."</p>

  <p>"I have seen everybody in the place worth seeing; and I don't know how to
  see souls;" Jack answered, with a rudeness unusual to him; but the levity of
  Bachelor Short was distasteful to his feelings. "All I want to know
  is&mdash;where is our trap, and where is the governor?"</p>

  <p>"Let me put you up to a little thing, Jack," the vicar replied, with a
  turn of kind thought, which the young man had scarcely earned of him; "if you
  want to keep a seat, in your good father's carriage, for some one very nicely
  dressed, and likely to shed tears at the drops of tar-water, let the other
  flys, and rumbelows, come down first. The ladies will rush into the first
  that come; without two thoughts of ownership. And the colonel is so polite,
  that he would let them pack your carriage, up to the glasses, and order him
  all about with it. You would never get home to-night, to begin with; and you
  could not squeeze even Spotty Perperaps in, not to speak of any other
  well-dressed young lady. You twig me. Ha, see the first proof of it!" A
  lumbering fly came down; and was crammed, four on each seat, before the horse
  could stick his heels in.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" cried Jack. "What a clear head you have got! Mr. Short, I beg
  your pardon. You have obliged me greatly. But keep Miss Perperaps for our
  carriage."</p>

  <p>In another instant, he was running up the hill, just in time to stop his
  father's carriage from coming down it; though the colonel, defiant of all
  rain, was on the box. "Draw aside a bit, I want to speak to you," cried Jack;
  and his father obeyed him, for he saw that it was earnest.</p>

  <p>"Take the reins, and manage it yourself," replied the colonel, as soon as
  he had heard what his son's idea was; "I dare say you are right; and it would
  please me more, to save a poor young lady, than a dozen of these grand
  madams, who have fifty fine dresses at home."</p>

  <p>"She never thinks twice about her dress," said Jack; "she would look just
  as well in a potato-sack. It is only because her father was so kind about it.
  Miss Perperaps told me the story; and I hope to have her with us also;
  because she is not very rich. Father, jump inside, you are very wet
  already."</p>

  <p>By this good management, it was brought about, that the colonel, and Miss
  Perperaps, had the carriage to themselves, and Mr. Short stood by the horses,
  while Jack, with a great pile of wrappings, went to look for his beloved. She
  had obeyed his injunction to stay there, and added such a pretty blush of
  pleasure, to her look of gratitude for his thoughtfulness, that he scarcely
  knew how to protect her enough.</p>

  <p>"Please to remember one thing," he said, as her dimpled chin protruded
  from his mother's carriage-fur, and he took the liberty of asking for a pin;
  "unless you keep quite close to my arm, through the wood, everything will
  blow away, and my father will abuse me. He always says, that I am so clumsy,
  whenever ladies are concerned."</p>

  <p>"Then I doubt, whether he can understand the subject; or, at any rate, not
  so well as you do. You have done everything, to perfection; and I shall never
  be able to thank you enough."</p>

  <p>In a quarter of an hour, Jack was driving up the winding hill, towards
  Drewsteignton; a very long roundabout road, but the only one fit for a
  carriage towards the moor; while Mr. Short fetched his own horse, and faced
  the storm, up the steepy track, that climbs to Cranbrook Castle. "I shall be
  at Christowell, long before you are," he had called in at the window, as he
  saw Rose sitting, in a happy condition, at the colonel's side, and Spotty set
  up opposite, in a grin of lively comfort. "Young ladies, shall I tell your
  dear parents all about you?"</p>

  <p>"You had better not," cried Miss Perperaps audaciously; "we are all right
  now; and we want them to get anxious. My pa would be very anxious, if he
  dared."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell your dear step-mamma, that you have been drowned; it will be
  such a shock to her&mdash;when you come home alive."</p>

  <p>Spotty was delighted with this tantalising prospect; and she had such a
  real style of laughing, when she did laugh&mdash;which was not very often,
  for a frequent is a feeble laugh&mdash;that the parson, in spite of all the
  weather, caught it up, and said to himself, as he rode away briskly, "I know
  a good many young fellows, who might do worse than marry Spotty Perperaps. In
  the dark she looks almost as well as Miss Arthur; and we mortals spend most
  of our time in the dark. I must get up this hill, though, before it grows
  darker; or down I go through the tree-tops."</p>

  <p>For the gloom of night was closing in; so that the valley seemed to
  deepen, and grow narrower, with the folds of the storm-cloud sweeping through
  the hollows, the devices of crag thrown forth, by the bowing of trees to the
  wind, and the patches of gorse-land darkened by the soaking rain. Jack
  Westcombe was fain to urge his horses up the hill, that he might get past the
  dangerous places, before the last of the daylight waned.</p>

  <p>"What a shame to let him get so wet!" said Spotty, who very soon dropped
  formality. "You must have brought a coachman, Colonel Westcombe, or a
  footman, or somebody."</p>

  <p>"Only one man, to look after the horses; and I lent him to some ladies,
  whose driver had enjoyed the refreshments of the day too heartily. I fear
  there will be many accidents to-night. Six casks of XXX, from Dunsford
  brewery, was an error of judgment upon Master Dicky's part. However, have no
  fear about my son. He gets wet upon the moor, continually."</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary thing," replied Spotty, who liked to give the world
  all the benefit of her shrewdness, "that your son should know the road, on
  this side of the moor, so well! I thought that you lived, all away by
  Okehampton. There is no carriage-road, in that direction, from our
  village."</p>

  <p>"Well, now you speak of it, I am surprised a little. Jack is always
  riding, or walking about, here, there, and everywhere, without much object.
  His dear mother calls him a Jack-of-the-lantern. But that would not teach him
  these roads, as you say; but rather the places where there are no roads.
  However, he seems to know his way right well. He has a most wonderful memory,
  that young man. It would be wrong for me to praise him; but I never meet any
  one, who does not admire his abilities, and what is far more, his discretion,
  and steadiness, high principles, and truly noble feelings."</p>

  <p>"He seems to know how to drive, at any rate. Don't you think so, Rosie,
  dear?"</p>

  <p>"I know so little of carriages, that I cannot pretend to be a judge,"
  answered Rose. "The only carriage I understand, is Mr. Pugsley's tilt-cart;
  but I have a very slight acquaintance also, with Mr. Short's yellow
  four-wheeled gig."</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe laughed, and took her hand in his. "I like you very
  much," he said, "because you are so truthful. Your father must allow you to
  come, and spend some time with us. I have heard, that you have no mother;
  only a good father, to whom you are greatly attached, and who lives a very
  quiet life, just as we do."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Rose (who had never found time, in the hurry and flurry, to
  think about it) discovered, that this most kind and loveable gentleman,
  looking so gently at her, was Mr. Short's friend, whom he had wished to bring
  over to see them, two or three months ago. She ought to have known it long
  ago; but her mind had been occupied so entirely, with the many new
  impressions of this strange day, that the one perception, of most importance
  to her own little world, had escaped her. Now if, through her selfish
  stupidity, her father's indulgence, and confidence, should recoil upon him,
  in the very result which he feared the most, better had she never beheld this
  day. Better, at any rate, would it be, to walk the many miles of rain and
  darkness, than to bring to her father's door the man, whom least of all he
  wanted there. She longed to jump out of the carriage at once; but a second
  thought showed her the folly of arousing curiosity, by an outrageous act. So
  she leaned back in the darkness, with a miserable mind.</p>

  <p>"You do not answer me, my dear," said Colonel Westcombe, in his quiet
  winning tone, as if he sought a favour; "perhaps you are thinking, that I
  should have asked your father's kind consent, before I spoke. If so, I
  believe that you are quite right. I spoke, on the spur of the moment, from a
  wish not only to please myself, but to add to the happiness of my dear wife.
  Her health is not at all what we could wish. She is quite unable to meet
  rough people, or even our general visitors. But she loves a gentle face like
  yours, and a soft voice, and sweet quiet ways. And I am sure, you will not
  think me rude in saying, that no young lady would be the loser, by the
  friendship of one so good, and kind, and motherly, and wonderfully
  well-informed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what it would be; I have very often felt it. It is the very
  thing that I should like most dearly," Rose answered, with a little sigh;
  which vexed her when she thought of it. "But there are always
  troubles&mdash;or at least, I should say obstacles&mdash;I cannot express
  myself very well, I know&mdash;but I thank you with all my heart; and you
  will understand me."</p>

  <p>"It is the way her pa shuts her up," Miss Perperaps explained, reaching
  forward to the colonel, as if he were deaf, as well as stupid; "the very same
  thing, that my step-ma does to me. Only I do want dragooning, I admit;
  because I am awfully fond of pleasure. But she&mdash;you might put her in a
  bucket, and wind her up and down a well, all day; and she would smile, every
  time she came out at the top."</p>

  <p>"You are a remarkable young lady too," said the colonel, looking, with new
  interest, at as much as he could make out of this quick movement, which came
  to his shirt-frills, and then jerked back; "you seem to lose no time, in
  making up your mind, and if possible, less in declaring it."</p>

  <p>"That's my card. I am sat upon a good bit; because my pa must go, and have
  another sort of wife; when I was doing bloomingly. But I am beginning to come
  round; and now, they find me hot to sit upon."</p>

  <p>Of all the things Colonel Westcombe loathed, slang from a young girl's
  lips was foremost. The girls of the present day fancy it a new thing, and a
  "rise" upon their elders, to patter this vile English. If they knew, that
  their grandmothers were beaten out of all that stale stuff, in their infancy,
  perhaps they would eschew the nauseous trick.</p>

  <p>"Are you an intimate friend of Miss Arthur?" Colonel Westcombe asked,
  without showing surprise; "and did her father entrust her to your
  charge?"</p>

  <p>"I am not half so thick with her, as I should like to be. I scraped
  acquaintance first, professionally; and I haven't got much further now;
  though I like her. And as for her coming under my wing, colonel, there is not
  a year between us, I believe; and we both came under the Reverend Short; but
  he was spoons all day, on Julia."</p>

  <p>The elderly man was made quite happy by this explanation; for he knew the
  deep obstinacy of his son; and how love even screws down the lids of blind
  eyes. And it would have made a sad want of echo in his heart, if his only boy
  had loved a girl capable of being "very thick" with Spotty Perperaps. Then,
  his generous nature told him, that he had wronged Miss Arthur, by the
  questions he had put; and he scarcely saw how to let her know it, except by
  endeavouring to find her hand again.</p>

  <p>Her hand was trembling, when he found it; for a tallow-candle, stuck in a
  blacking-jar, and twinkling through lozenges of green glass, revealed the
  toll-gate on the Exeter road, within a mile of Christowell; and the poor girl
  could think of no device, for keeping this carriage from her father's gate.
  Very soon, a splashing, and a grinding sound announced the crossing of the
  Christow ford, below the village; and then Spotty called out, "There's my
  pa's house! Highly genteel, with a red bull's eye. Hold hard, mister; and
  thank you very much."</p>

  <p>Miss Perperaps, after shaking hands with the colonel, bounced out, and
  rang the paternal bell; while Rose made a quick attempt to follow, but
  without a rude push could not get by. "No, no, my dear; we will take you to
  your own door; or as near to it as we can get," Colonel Westcombe said
  decisively; "this is not a night for walking, one step more than can be
  helped. Drive on, my boy, as far as Mr. Arthur's. Don't tell me about the
  road," he continued, as Rose began imploring him not to risk his carriage;
  "if Pugsley can go there, so can we. Gee up, coachey!" Jack (though he had
  his own misgivings as to what might come of it) aroused his nags with a
  cheerful flick, which made them sidle into one another; as men do, when the
  whip is in the air; both for the sake of sweet sympathy, and that the other
  may get the first turn of it.</p>

  <p>"What a dark night!" said the colonel, as they came to the bottom of the
  hill, below Lark's cot; "perhaps we have met the moorland air. I never
  understand about such things, though I ought to do so thoroughly. It seems to
  me, to come in through the glass, a great deal more than the rain did. But
  perhaps I ought to lay the blame on my old eyes. Jack must have cats' eyes,
  to keep out of the ditch."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he has very nice eyes, Colonel Westcombe; not at all like cats'
  eyes. And we ought to be very thankful to him, for the care he has taken of
  us all to-night."</p>

  <p>"You seem to like Jack very much," said the colonel; though he felt, that
  it was not at all the thing to say.</p>

  <p>"I never saw any one I liked more, as a stranger, of course, and a
  gentleman; unless it was yourself, Colonel Westcombe."</p>

  <p>That gentleman thanked her, and said no more. Only to himself he
  thought&mdash;"Jack has still got his work to do; if he means to have this
  lovely girl. She respects him; but she does not love him yet. No girl, worth
  having, tumbles into deep affection, even for such a fine fellow as my son.
  He must have opportunities; and he shall have them, if her father is worthy
  to be her father. And I ought to find that out at once."</p>

  <p>To his great chagrin, and the pure delight of Rose, who was thinking
  mainly of her father still, the densest depth of night, that ever drove down
  from Dartmoor, came around them. The rain stopped suddenly, and the wind was
  hushed, except in the tops of invisible trees; and a streak of black boggy
  fog settled heavily. The carriage-lamps (which had long been flickering, but
  managed to survive, while they got air) now gave up the ghost, in the murky
  reek.</p>

  <p>"I can't see where to stop," Jack called in, through the front glass of
  the carriage. "I'm afraid that we must have passed the gate. Please to ask
  Miss Arthur."</p>

  <p>"Please to stop here, if you have got my daughter," a clear voice, from
  one unseen, replied; and the panting horses, with their superior sense, came
  to a standstill suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You shall not get out, Colonel Westcombe; I beg of you, for my sake, not
  to get out," cried Rose, that her father might know who was come. "Oh, father
  dear, how you must have been frightened! I will never go away again."</p>

  <p>Jack Westcombe heard kissing, which went to his heart, as Rose sprang into
  her father's arms; and then Mr. Arthur, forgetful of everything, except the
  duty of a gentleman, came forward to the carriage-door, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Colonel Westcombe, I thank you, with all my heart for your great kindness
  to my child. Will you come into my cottage, and have something? You have many
  miles, I fear, to travel yet."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I am very much obliged to you," the ancient officer answered,
  without even trying to descry the other's face, of which the darkness gave
  small chance; "but we must not stop, now we have done our duty. And a
  pleasure too,&mdash;the very greatest pleasure, to have been of the smallest
  service to a young lady, who has charmed me so. Good night, sir. Good night,
  my dear Miss Arthur. I only hope, that you have not caught cold."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do like him so much," said Rose, as the carriage rumbled down the
  hill; "he reminds me continually of you, papa. I do believe, you must have
  been a great deal together."</p>

  <p>"It can hardly be possible," thought the colonel to himself; "and yet, I
  seemed to know the voice so well. But if so, poor fellow, how he is to be
  pitied! I scarcely know, what will be the proper thing to do."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; ON THE "DEFIANCE"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The vicar of Christowell, all this time, though he entered
  into society&mdash;as the people, who like to be from home, express
  it&mdash;was not unmindful of his wrongs. He had the pusillanimous feeling of
  a fellow, who objects to the wrong end of the stick; which now is received by
  our noble country, with a sweet request for more. The latter, no doubt, is
  the loftier way of getting the worst of it, and leads up to the surety of
  getting it again. However, the old style seems to have been, to lay hold of
  the cudgel, after serious groanings, and try how it would work, with the
  other end.</p>

  <p>It was not any very low desire for redress, nor even that selfish sense of
  property, which now is being exploded by the powers of the age; nay, nor even
  that stability to dinner-time, which is now lost, because there is neither
  time nor dinner&mdash;but it was a larger thing, which bound the parson
  fast&mdash;as his own Mrs. Aggett had been tied that day, to the steadfast
  righting of his wrongs.</p>

  <p>"Bain't no good for 'e, to prache to me," old Betty Sage had declared to
  Mr. Short, when he could not help calling her to account for language,
  because of a baby running in between her legs, when the day was warm, and she
  was rather short of breath. "Passon Shart, tend thee own ouze, fust. Happen,
  you swared a bit, when they robbed 'e. Goo, and vaind 'un out, if 'e knooeth
  Holy Scripter."</p>

  <p>It was not her opinion only (although it carried great weight in the
  parish, now that her husband was away, and believed to be earning twice as
  much as he was worth) but it was the universal sense concerning the parson,
  and the sad way in which his people touched their hats to him, and the heap
  of small condolence which came in through Mrs. Aggett, that really drove this
  very clever-minded man, to try to do something that should set him up again.
  For he could not bear to be pitied, and advised, and to get no stick-thumps
  on the floor, for the shrewd hits, and "prime doctorin'," of the oldest, and
  wisest, of all his sermons.</p>

  <p>For the better preservation of the peace, an Act had been passed, in the
  very last session, and already was beginning to do a good deal of mischief,
  no further off than Exeter. A very considerable quantity of men had been
  appointed to preserve the peace, as "county, or district constables;" but
  preferring foreign words to English, and knowing the fear that springs of
  them, they began to call themselves "Rural Police." Christowell had not heard
  of them yet, except through Carrier Pugsley; but there was a man at Manaton,
  a superior parish constable, who said that he knew all about them, and could
  swear that they were the biggest fools going in the county.</p>

  <p>Mr. Short, though he could not foresee the rising incapacity of this
  force, resolved (as a hater of new-fangled ways) to make no appeal to their
  vigilance. In his own shrewd mind, he had formed a firm belief, though
  without any premises producible, that the man, who had robbed his house, was
  no other than the rogue in the swamp, who had fired at his <i>Nous.</i> The
  people of the village,&mdash;though they tried to recollect, with a jogging
  of one memory against another,&mdash;could not be sure that they had seen
  anybody, in the very heavy rain, going by that day; though they thought they
  must have looked at him, if they had, because he would have been so wet-like.
  But without twice moving of their minds, they spied the sense of it. The One
  that jumped to the top of church-tower, the same came down to vicarage; both
  praying, and preaching, was an empty gun-shot, if you couldn't keep him out
  of your own kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Physician, heal thyself," is the hardest, and most unanswerable of all
  taunts&mdash;in the present condition of medicine&mdash;and when it is proved
  against the parson of a parish, that he cannot keep the Prince of evil out of
  his own house, the sphere of his usefulness&mdash;to put it in the mildest
  form possible&mdash;becomes restricted. Parson Short was bound to be the
  master of his parish; and he vowed a great vow, not to give away sixpence,
  until his flock should be as dutiful as ever, and proud to run a race, when
  he whistled.</p>

  <p>There was a little woman now, living at Okehampton, who knew everything
  about almost everybody. She was closely connected with literature, not only
  because she kept a little paper-shop, but also that she had a female cousin
  who wrote verses, and some of them were printed. The verses were good, and in
  the style of Dr. Watts, a poet under-valued now, almost as much as he is
  misquoted. But that is quite beside the present question. Only that some
  people took it on themselves, to declare that Mrs. Petherick never could have
  known all she did, except for her connection with the press, and her son
  being prenticed at Exeter.</p>

  <p>"The women are a hundred times sharper than the men, round our part of the
  country," Jack Westcombe had said to Mr. Short, one day. "The men see things,
  and think no more about them; but they generally tell them to the women, at
  the time; and the women make the meaning out of them. The next time you come
  our way, go, and buy something from little Mrs. Petherick. You need not make
  her talk. She will do it, without asking; and you may pick something up, for
  she knows everybody. Don't tell her, who you are; see how cleverly she will
  find out."</p>

  <p>The vicar had already made some expeditions into the depth of the
  moorland, and among the lonely farm-houses on the outskirts, in the vain hope
  of finding some trace of the fellow, who had carried off his money, and what
  he valued more, the watch of his respected grand-sire. Sometimes he took a
  fishing-rod, sometimes a gun, as a pretext for his wanderings; and once or
  twice he rode, and fastened up his horse, while he was exploring dangerous
  parts. He even called once at the <i>Raven,</i> and saw the man who could
  have told him many interesting things; but Gruff Howell held his peace; and
  neither there nor elsewhere, was any sign forthcoming of the enemy. So now he
  went to see Mrs. Petherick, without even calling at Westcombe Hall.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the age, whose main desire is to give fair play to every
  one, but first and foremost to all rogues,&mdash;as they perpetually prove,
  by preferring foreign to British produce&mdash;had lately made a mighty step
  towards enlightenment, and adulteration&mdash;a march of intellect, known to
  the present generation, as the "Reform Bill." Although from a bill, it
  ungrubbed itself into an Act, and went hovering about, without doing half the
  harm expected (as a cock-chafer, after his larva stage, is harmless, and
  amuses bad boys, when he is stuck upon a pin), yet there was a sad piece of
  mischief done here, in the very town where Mrs. Petherick lived. That
  ancient, and honourable town, Okehampton, baronial, royal-chartered, standing
  on two rivers, was found to contain such a scarcity of rogues, that it must
  not send any up to Parliament.</p>

  <p>This blow had killed Mr. Petherick, according to the evidence of his
  widow, who must know best about it. He had always taken the lead, among one
  hundred and fifty freemen, who returned two members, with the truest
  pleasure, every time they required returning. There could be no meaner thing,
  than to dream of any possibility of harm in this. However, it must have been
  dreamed of; or why should Mrs. Petherick (who used to wear her own lace, on
  nomination-day, and again at the chairing, in her own bow-window) be driven,
  at the present time, to sell papers&mdash;though papers were a very decent
  trade, as yet&mdash;and spectacles, and tea-spoons of best Britannia metal,
  and to keep three young women in the back parlour, making lace to pattern for
  the ladies all around?</p>

  <p>Mr. Short knew very little of Okehampton, and was pleased to see how nice
  it looked, with its quiet old windows, and round-pebbled street, and church
  peeping down upon it from a wooded crest, and another church bravely sending
  back the look; and above all, two very tidy bridges, scarcely half a pipeful
  of tobacco apart. Leisurely, and round-faced, folk live here, with a large
  amount of female fatness, and a breadth of brogue so spacious, that even a
  Devonshire man can hardly make out, what the boys are holloaing to one
  another. They all said, "Sarvant, sir," to Mr. Short, as soon as they had
  seen his horse, and white tie; for the coaches, then running through the town
  from Falmouth, had a tendency to import good manners; wherein the railways do
  an export trade alone. Sturdy urchins, vying with one another, without any
  dream of a halfpenny for guerdon, led Mr. Short to Mrs. Petherick's shop;
  while <i>Trumpeter</i> stopped at the White Hart, considering the important
  subject of refreshment.</p>

  <p>If Mrs. Petherick had a fault (besides the original one of curiosity,
  which standeth in the following of Eve) it was that she preferred a new
  customer to an old one, being taken with the beauty of the bird in the bush.
  In the present loose days of co-operative stores (when the noble mind
  hesitates, betwixt the pang of paying twice too much for a thing, and the
  pain of aggrieving a fine neighbourly spirit) it may be true wisdom in a
  solid tradesman, to flit about after fickle winds of money, because he has no
  sure trade-wind. But forty years ago, a hap-hazard shilling might cool itself
  on the counter, while the books were being done.</p>

  <p>"And what can I do for you sir, now? It is a pleasure to see a new face in
  Okehampton; the breeze of our wind brings a beautiful colour into the cheeks
  of our visitors. I hope you are come, to make a long stay, sir. The change of
  the weather makes such a difference, don't it? The clergy ought to go, for
  change of air more often. Surely I must have the pleasure of seeing the Rev.
  Brown, of Manaton?"</p>

  <p>"I heartily hope that you may, Mrs. Petherick," Mr. Short answered,
  without surprise, being used to the style of the Devon shopkeepers; "but I
  fear that you will have to wait some time; for he is in the hands of three
  doctors now."</p>

  <p>"Ah, poor dear! It is very hard upon him. What a wicked thing that gout
  is, to be sure! It always attacks the clergy so bad! And what a lovely set of
  lace, I sold him; perhaps you have seen it upon Mrs. Brown, sir? Necklet,
  with lappets down to here, and cuffs to match, and a wide turn-over; all of
  the finest Honiton! And then the lady wanted more; and I made sure that you
  was come about it. But what can I do for your good lady, sir? Eliza, bring me
  drawer No. 3. We have just done a set, of new Shinyoister pattern, the
  fashionable flower at the young Queen's court, all drawed first on
  tissue-paper, and improved by my own hand, sir."</p>

  <p>"They are indeed beautiful;" said Mr. Short; "How I envy your taste, Mrs.
  Petherick! But alas, at present, there is no Mrs.&mdash;Ah, there, I was
  going to be rude, and trouble you with my name; which would not interest
  you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, it would, sir, very much. Sometimes it appears to me very
  hard, that we poor shop-keepers should be bound to keep our own names, over
  the door, and yet have no idea, who rings the bell. Did it ever strike you,
  in that light, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Never, till now. But I at once confess the grievance. But oh, Mrs.
  Petherick, you know too much already! I hear that you are the cleverest lady,
  in Okehampton."</p>

  <p>"Only in the way of laces, sir, and book-learning, and politeness. There
  are many as can buy, and sell me; because what they sell is downright
  rubbish. I just get the cost of the thread, and the time, and the victuals my
  young ladies eats. You may see them at work, if you come here. They like to
  be looked at by a gentleman; but away go their pillows, if a lady peeps
  in."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Mrs. Petherick, you are too bad. I did not mean to buy any
  lace. But have you any pattern in roses? I know a young lady&mdash;quite a
  child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, sir, I have the very thing for you. Moss-roses in the bud, my own
  designing; the loveliest thing, and so reasonable!"</p>

  <p>The parson bought a very pretty piece of work, for a couple of guineas,
  and was having it packed, when the coach from Falmouth, the old
  <i>Defiance,</i> came over the western bridge at a brisk trot, with a great
  horn-blowing, and pulled up at the inn. Mrs. Petherick rushed to the window
  to gaze, and her customer opened the door, to do the same.</p>

  <p>"My goodness, there he is! I shall drop; sir, I shall drop," the little
  woman cried; but she did not drop, though her ruddy cheeks lost all their
  colour. "What a burning shame it is to our country, that such a villain
  should walk the earth!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Short, without asking what she meant, stepped back, to be sure that
  she did not want help; and then, instead of going to the door again, took a
  chair, and sat down to watch the coach, through the light things hanging in
  the window. There was nothing unusual, so far as he could see. The coachman
  did what a coachman always does, or did until he became extinct. He threw
  down the reins, with a condescending nod, handed his whip to a gentleman
  behind&mdash;for the gentleman on the box descended to stand treat&mdash;and
  then after thumping himself on the chest, although it was a shirt-sleeve day,
  down he went, very clumsily and slowly, even as a boatman is one of the worst
  to get into, or out of, his own boat.</p>

  <p>"He is a most abstemious man," said Mrs. Petherick; "at this time of year,
  he scarcely ever takes anything stronger than brandy and lemonade. That man
  has fourteen children. And he scarcely looks five and thirty yet. He is
  planting his children all along the road. He drives twelve stages, up one
  day, and down the next; and they say that he means to have two children at
  every stage, all born in holy matrimony; as I myself can testify, because his
  wife was a barmaid here." The lady of the shop had now recovered from her
  scare, and seemed anxious to divert attention from it. But the parson would
  not have it so.</p>

  <p>"If I may ask, without rudeness," he said, "what was it that frightened
  you, when the coach came in? They all seem very quiet, tidy people. My sight
  is pretty good. I can see their faces; and I cannot see anything formidable
  yet. Perhaps, the one that frightened you jumped down, before I looked."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he is there with his shoulders towards us, and his back against
  a brown-haired trunk. These day-coaches carry no proper guard; they only have
  a boy to blow the horn; and the man I mean is sitting, or slouching, next to
  the one who is opposite the boy. There, he has put his hand up to his
  chin!"</p>

  <p>The street is of a good width in that part, and the coach having stopped
  some little way back, as well as on the other side, and having luggage on the
  roof, the hind passengers could not be discerned very clearly, from the
  window of the paper shop. And the man with his hand to his chin appeared to
  be sleepy, and scornful perhaps of the town; so that he did not turn round,
  and stare about.</p>

  <p>"You will see him better presently, when they come by; but you had better
  not seem to notice him," Mrs. Petherick continued, as she hung a scarf
  across, to baffle any eyes that might invade her. "I would not let him see
  me, not for £50; to know, I mean, that I was watching him. Sometimes I have
  lace to repair for ladies, worth £200 or more; let alone ten, or twelve,
  drawerfuls of my own."</p>

  <p>"But surely, my dear madam, you never mean to say, that a man would be
  riding about on a coach, in broad daylight, who would break in, and steal
  your lace!"</p>

  <p>"Not lace in particular, sir, but anything. Nothing comes amiss to him;
  and he can break in, anywhere. And as for his riding on the coach, there is
  no one, in the town or out of it, who would know him, in the manner he is
  dressed up now; or if they did, they would not dare. He is quite the
  gentleman, when he chooses; and he got some very good clothes, no doubt, when
  he plundered that stupid Parson Short."</p>

  <p>"What Parson Short?" asked the parson of that name; "there are several in
  the diocese, I believe."</p>

  <p>"The rich Parson Short, sir, of Christowell. I am told, it was a most
  amusing thing. He was lured from home, like a simple Simon; and when he come
  back, he found his cook tied up, and all his dinner eaten, and the other maid
  locked in, with no other food than his sermons, for the day. And I hear that
  she found them uncommon tough, and dry. No wonder, poor girl, for he is the
  very dryest man that ever went up the pulpit-stairs. Our people did laugh,
  when they heard the joke. And they say, that he boiled the parson's spinach,
  for he is a bit of an epicure, you must know, and was going to have it with a
  breast of lamb; but the other man enjoyed it, and then fastened up the dish,
  over the face of the poor fat cook. But the other man had his disappointment
  too; for the gentleman's leg-garments would not come below his knee. Short by
  name, he is, and short by nature."</p>

  <p>He was almost short in language too; and his clear and clean face flushed
  with wrath, at this stinging description of his woes.</p>

  <p>"This must be a most outrageous town for gossip," he said, looking sternly
  at the streets thereof; "and full of wicked falsehoods, and very low
  ones."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not more than anywhere else," Mrs. Petherick answered
  pleasantly; "but we do love a pretty tale about a clergyman; and every word
  of what I have been telling you is true. But here they are off, with a
  flourish of the whip. Now, if you will look between that paper and the
  tambour-work, you will have a good view of the gentleman that did it. Shall I
  tell you, what he has been to Falmouth for?"</p>

  <p>"I know that some parts of your story are wrong, and I doubt whether you
  know anything about it." He spoke a little rudely, to provoke her tongue,
  while he watched for that felonious passenger.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, you are quite right. I don't know an atom about him. I don't
  know the figure, how he holds himself, whatever clothes he may put on, nor
  the individdle way of making lines inside his clothes, that the men get, by
  reason of no stiffness. And perhaps I don't know why he went to Falmouth, to
  get the best price for a celebrated watch, such as they can work a ship by. I
  did hear that it was worth £200. But I don't know, I am sure; I don't know
  anything."</p>

  <p>"It is the man!" cried Mr. Short, as the coach passed slowly, with
  laborious wind of horn; "I can't tell how I know it; but I am sure that he is
  the man. What makes him come through the town, like this, when he might have
  got down, four or five miles back? And how far will he go with the coach?
  Mrs. Petherick, you seem to me to know everything."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, no. I make no pretences. But to my humble thinking, he has come
  through the town, because it was the safest thing for him to do. His pockets
  are full of money; and a robber is always most frightened of being robbed.
  There is a gang of louters, Sourton way, who would cry shares with him, if
  they spied him in his clericals. And as for the danger of the town, there is
  none. We have a man, who calls himself a constable; but he never stirs
  without a warrant; and we have a very nice old gentleman indeed, just made a
  Justice of the Peace; but all he can do is to fight the battle of Waterloo,
  or Salamander, again. And as for the mayor, he won't do nothing, ever since
  we were robbed of our old borough. The whole of the difference between right,
  and wrong, was upset, when they took away both members."</p>

  <p>"What is a lobster worth, without his claws? But how far will this
  clerical gentleman go, after riding in triumph through Okehampton?"</p>

  <p>"As far as Crosscombe, sir, most likely, and then take the lane to
  Sticklepath, or Belstone. That will bring him back to the wild parts of the
  moor, by an easier way than Sourton. And he shifts about pretty often, I
  believe; though he is more at home than welcome, as we say, whatever part he
  lives in. But good heart alive, you are never going after him! You would be a
  baby, in his hands."</p>

  <p>"Babies are troublesome creatures sometimes," exclaimed Mr. Short, being
  vexed once more; "but I am not going after him, with any idea of laying hands
  on him, among a lot of cowards; when he has fire-arms, and I have none. I beg
  you to make no stir about it; for that would defeat my object. Do not even
  see me, when I get my horse out. I am Mr. Short, of Christowell, whose
  dryness in the pulpit is proverbial here, though quite satisfactory to his
  own parish. It is not true, that yonder fellow ate my dinner; but still I
  have a bone to pick with him; and my chance will be spoiled, if you talk
  about it. I thank you for your very shrewd hit about my watch. The cleverest
  woman in the town should be so far superior to her sex, that she can hold her
  tongue, when a great pinch is put on it."</p>

  <p>"The only difficulty that I find is, to express myself, not to contain
  myself, sir. When poor Petherick was paying of them freemen, average of £15
  per vote, and the other side was trying every low inducement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Another time, if you please, I shall be delighted. I want the old
  <i>Defiance</i> to get well in front; and I don't want to seem to be riding
  in chase. It is a long hill towards Crosscombe, and stirrups will easily beat
  traces. Now if you say nothing about this affair, I will not even tell my old
  friend Colonel Westcombe, to fight his battles over again with me."</p>

  <p>"You have read me a lesson, to be shy of the clergy, sir. They always
  looks, as if they was so gracious; and then they drop on you, like the core
  of a box-oven. But you had better not take your lace, sir."</p>

  <p>"No; I will pay for it, and ask you to send it to kind care of Colonel
  Westcombe. I hope to be there, in a day or two. Good-bye, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, sir. I need not tell you, I think, to take care of yourself;
  you are sure to do that. It would take a sharp man to eat his
  dinner"&mdash;she continued to herself, as she beheld him crossing the
  street, without any sign of hurry, to get his horse out of the stable. "Short
  he may be; and no wonder he was short with me, after what I said of him; but
  the short men are the best to wrestle, after all. Why there he goes, horse
  and all! The Lord deliver him!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Short however required no especial deliverance, on this occasion. At a
  mile, or so, over East Ockment bridge, he sighted the <i>Defiance</i> on the
  crown of a hill, and his keen eyes showed him, that the interesting passenger
  was sitting in the same place on the roof. Then he followed very cautiously,
  and kept behind the corners, until the coach stopped, where a narrow lane
  departed, on the right hand side, towards Belstone, and the moor. Here he saw
  the tall man get down, and pay his fare, and swing a little knapsack on his
  shoulder, containing perhaps some good things from Falmouth. Then the villain
  looked about, to be sure that no one watched him, and presently set off along
  the narrow lane, with the top of his hat showing over the dry wall. Short
  rode into a gateway of the turnpike-road, and considered that hat, as it
  jogged along the loopholes of the granite slabs.</p>

  <p>"I could cut him off easily enough," he thought; "and call him to account;
  but he would settle me. He is sure to have at least one tremendous pistol;
  and I have nothing but this hunting-crop. It would have been foolish to
  attack him on the coach; for nobody would have helped me, and there were two
  women there. It would be still more foolish to attack him now, without even a
  witness to my murder. After all, that is not my hat. It is much too
  respectable to belong to me. He bought it at Falmouth with my money. Perhaps,
  I am a coward; but why should a good man be killed for nothing? What would
  Mrs. Aggett say? And who would carry on all my works? Nay, I will be
  discreet, and only observe him beyond bullet-range. If I accosted him, as a
  neutral, it would do more harm than good; as I know him already, and he then
  would know me, which is not at all to be desired."</p>

  <p>With these reflections, he restrained himself, as a truly wise man is
  bound to do; and calmly postponing the settlement of accounts, resolved to
  help it one line forward, by observing the route of the enemy. Therefore, as
  soon as he came to a gate, where the rocky expanse of the desert began, he
  fastened up his horse, and going warily afoot, had the pleasure of descrying
  a dark figure in the distance, and watching it follow the desolate windings
  of Belstone Cleeve, towards the source of the Skate river. Here a
  three-knuckled hill, with water-clefts, and yellow knolls of rushes, and
  swamp-reeds, barred the view; and the distant form disappeared among them,
  after turning to the right.</p>

  <p>"He has made for Cranmere. It is about a league further. None but the
  moormen could find him there. It is hard enough to find the place itself,
  much more such an atom as a man, among it. Well, well, I have done something;
  and as much as I could hope to do. <i>Trumpeter</i> must be quite tired of
  waiting. Suppose we go quietly home to dinner, with gratitude, and a fine
  appetite."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; FOR MY SON'S SAKE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">People of so bald a nature, as to find but little joy in all
  the things around them, take at any rate some delight in their own superior
  thickness. With pleasure, they look down upon the fads, the crotchets, and
  the hobbies, of the few who still have soft enjoyment, outside money, and
  away from show. Yet these latter smile at laughter; and the smile outlives
  the louder operation; even as the sun survives the storm.</p>

  <p>Every just man has his periods for incurring the opinions of the
  wiseacres, when his name turns up, through a law-suit, or an accident, or
  perhaps some great wrong done to him. And his true course is to exclude all
  care, not only as to what those wiseacres say, but whether they even draw
  their fleeting breath about him. And after short disquietude, and a little
  counsel with himself, Mr. Arthur resolved to follow this true course. His
  friend, Mr. Short, would have done the very same, in his own case, if
  possible. But he, as a clergyman, must not suffer fools to undermine his
  influence.</p>

  <p>Fearing to have brought upon her father, not only unpleasant recollection,
  but sad perplexities imminent, Rose Arthur was delighted to find him as
  cheerful as usual, on the following day. He listened, with interest and
  amusement, to the thousand and one things she had to tell, about her first
  great party; and he said, that he hoped it would not be very long, before she
  had another little change, to make her lively.</p>

  <p>"No, papa, no; I want no more, for a very, very long time indeed," she
  answered; "and I was so vexed at what happened last night,
  because&mdash;because I know, that you dislike to be disturbed so."</p>

  <p>"It was no disturbance, my dear child. I am glad, upon the whole, that it
  has happened so. Colonel Westcombe was most kind to you; and I wish that I
  could thank him better. But I do not in the least expect, that he will ever
  come again."</p>

  <p>He said this with a smile, which seemed to Rose a very sad one. And she
  was grieved, more than she liked to show, at such a conclusion to her sudden
  friendship, though she would not ask, why it must be so.</p>

  <p>"There are reasons, which I cannot explain to you, my dear," Mr. Arthur
  continued, as he understood her glance, "which prevent me from having any
  intercourse with the man, whom of all in this part of the world, and I may
  even say in the entire world, I respect, and admire, and like the best. If
  circumstances should entirely change, or even without that, if I should be
  taken with dangerous illness, it would become my duty to explain everything
  to you; or if I should be taken from you suddenly, all the particulars will
  be found in writing, as I have told you, once or twice. Now, for the work of
  the day, my darling. Busy hands make happy minds. The storm of last night has
  done good, upon the whole, and the air is beautifully soft to-day. But there
  must be a lot to do in the little vineyard; and I think I must call upon you
  to help. The wind is the worst foe the vine has in this country; though the
  May-frosts are worse than wind, in the east of England. In any part of
  Southern England, where those bitter May-frosts do not prevail, it is my firm
  belief that, with proper care and skill, and experience as to the right sort
  to grow, a much finer table-grape can be got, out-of-doors, than you can buy
  in Germany, or the northern half of France; and for this simple reason,
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, dear father, you like to deliver that lecture after supper. And you
  will be angry with yourself, and me too, if we stop to have it now&mdash;for
  it always lasts an hour&mdash;when we ought to be hard at work, in Naboth's
  vineyard. It is the first time you have ever had the manners to invite me, to
  do a bit of work there&mdash;you are so jealous! I quite understand it. There
  are plants of mine, that you dare not touch, in your most audacious moment.
  However, I will go and get my 'tuck-ups,' as you call them, and overtake you
  in two seconds. But what am I to sit upon&mdash;the ground?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that. There are flowerpots there, that your stupid
  Pugsley brought, only fit to sit upon; and some of them kick up, even so.
  There never was a pot of sense, till I invented mine, and had them made. And
  even, after that, the clay was so inferior, and they were kilned in such a
  doltish manner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of this lamentation passed out of hearing, as the puffs of the
  captain's pipe flitted through the bright air, while he was marching away
  among his pear-trees, and glancing at the increase of their hopes. The fresh
  remembrance of the rain, was on them, sparkling still from some cupped leaf;
  and the new shoots of summer were embrowning slowly their thick sappy green,
  into the dignity of rind. In sturdy little sheaves, were the young pears
  standing, with the setting of their eyes pricked up like cloves, and the
  bronzing of the sun, and air, shed round their sides already. Others, of the
  long curved stalk, and pensive habit, hung their heads, with paler tints
  generally, and more grey upon their oval drops.</p>

  <p>Thankful as a gardener is, at the prospect of a noble crop, he is anxious
  also that it should not fail, through failure of his grumbling. Right well he
  knows, through vast experience, what blows descend from heaven upon his first
  indulgence in a vaunt; and grateful as he is, beyond mankind, he humbly
  secretes his gratitude. "What a lot of thinning there will be to do! We shall
  never get through it;" cried Mr. Arthur.</p>

  <p>"Won't we, though? I can do a score of trees before breakfast, any fine
  morning," his daughter answered, as she overtook him; "and even you
  acknowledge, that I understand that work. We ought to be only too glad, to
  have to do it. But it goes to my heart, at every tap, to see the little
  darlings hopping on the ground. Now shall I go on to Jezreel, or begin
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I will not have my little nook called 'Naboth's Vineyard.' The confusion
  of ideas is too feminine. Am I, the owner, envious of my own ownership,
  because I shut out clumsy people? The only analogy, that can be imagined,
  would set you down first as an Ahab."</p>

  <p>"Very well, dear, if that will please you better, it shall be Solomon's
  Vineyard, such as he describes&mdash;I believe, somewhere. And I will be the
  Queen of Sheba, come to see it. Only you must have the manners, in that case,
  to provide me with at least a sound flower-pot, to sit upon, instead of one
  of your break-downs. And none of your sound ones have got anything to sit
  upon. Oh, papa, you are so clever, do invent something that is not all
  holes."</p>

  <p>"The special virtue of my pots is this," Mr. Arthur stopped short, when he
  began upon that, although in a great hurry to get on; "that they are all
  holes, or at any rate contrived so that you can tell, at a glance, what is
  going on inside. There is a very clever Frenchman, of the name of Beaumont,
  who has found a man endowed with a window in his digestive organs, by means
  of a bullet, or a grapeshot. He is thus enabled to ascertain&mdash;but never
  mind, my dear, you are too young, as yet, for inquiries of pure science. And
  I would not have hinted at the&mdash;well I may call it, the troublesome part
  of the human system&mdash;except to elucidate my theory of pots. There are
  three essential qualities in a flower-pot, to begin with; and there are
  fifteen of less, but still important consideration&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Her be coming, her be coming, at a rattle," Moggy, the maid, came hotly
  shouting; "shall us let 'un in, or shall us shut 'un out?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it, that causes you so much excitement, Moggy?" her master asked,
  with some little vexation, for he was just warming up to his subject, with
  the pleasure of the vines in prospect; "I have no time to see any one."</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship, Lady Tichwudd; I knowed that bragian boy in front, as
  looketh daown on his own kearful moother. No room for he, in my kitchen. I
  was vorced to box the ears of 'un, last time."</p>

  <p>"Do it again, if needful, Moggy. We will go, and meet Lady Touchwood, at
  the gate. Her carriage cannot cross the stream. Come, Rose, and thank her for
  her kindness to you yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Keep the horses exercised for one hour, and then be here again, to see if
  I am ready," Mr. Arthur, and his daughter, heard the order given, as they
  came back reluctantly to the drawbridge, and beheld their visitor, with the
  page behind her, crossing the space between the river and the lane. "Ah, how
  pleased I am to see you!" she exclaimed, as the captain lowered his plank,
  and politely led her across it; "I scarcely expected such good luck. And
  darling Rose, how well you look! It was very dull yesterday for you, I fear.
  But you would run away so. There was to have been a little dance, if the
  weather had only been propitious&mdash;what my son Richard will call a 'hop;'
  and then perhaps somebody would not have run away so, or at any rate, would
  not have been allowed the chance. I know one, who would have pleaded very
  hard; and he generally manages to get his own way. How ingenious it was about
  all those fish! I never saw so many, and how fresh they were! And how
  wonderfully you did cook them, dear! Canon Botrys made a splendid joke, so
  Mrs. Botrys herself told Julia, who between you and me, captain, is a trifle
  jealous. The canon said, 'that young lady dresses fish, almost as well as she
  dresses herself.' Not so very bad for a dignitary of the Church. And he stuck
  to his plate, till he got wet through. And then Julia, who understands all
  the foreign tongues, said&mdash;'give him some extra sec to dry him.' Upon
  the whole, it was very pleasant, except for that abominable rain. But I never
  heard how you got home, my dear. You must not think it remiss, on my part.
  All was such desperate confusion, in the storm."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I got home beautifully, Lady Touchwood. Colonel Westcombe brought
  Miss Perperaps to her own house; and then he brought me to my father's
  gate."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! What a gallant old officer! It seems to me that Colonel
  Westcombe does almost everything. And I suppose, his son was with him, too. A
  very polite young man, I believe; though with very little to say for
  himself."</p>

  <p>"We did not want him to talk," Rose answered, with a little flush of anger
  on her cheeks; "what we wanted, or at least what he wanted, was, to bring us
  safely through the dark stormy night, and the dangerous roads, which he
  ventured on for our sake. And he did it; though he must have been
  half-blinded by the rain. Very few people could have done it, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"My son is a noble whip, and he faces any weather. But I made him come
  inside; for he is not of coarse fibre. And even so, I fear, that he has taken
  a sad cold. Ever since that sad calamity on your premises, he has caused me
  great uneasiness. Perhaps no other young man, in the world, could have
  survived it. But he is of such elastic tissue, and unusual harmony of
  juncture,&mdash;as an eminent medical authority pronounced, before he was
  breeched (I beg your pardon for the word), that he seems to rise superior to
  all trials."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope, then," said Mr. Arthur very kindly, "that he will soon throw
  off his cold. Shall we go into my little sitting-room, which cherishes a
  memory of pipes, I fear? Or would you like to rest a little, in my summer
  plant-house, which is thrown open now, and has no sun upon it?"</p>

  <p>"No, if I may choose, I would rather be in doors. Under glass, I should
  have an expectation, every moment, of my son coming tumbling in upon me. And
  I do not object to the smell of tobacco. Sir Joseph, in his few angel-visits
  to the park, calls for his pipe immediately. And my beloved son tries very
  hard to do it. Such ideas consecrate a smell, however nasty."</p>

  <p>"You prove again the well-known truth of the unselfishness of ladies," Mr.
  Arthur answered, with a smile more genial, than any he had yet vouchsafed
  her. For nothing but the stiffness of his manner, and the fence of distant
  courtesy, had kept this lady from breaking into the coveted circle of his own
  affairs. While, according to the laws of nature, she held him in tenfold
  esteem, and viewed him with a hundredfold of interest, because she could not
  get at him; "but my Rosie sees that this room is well-aired; and the door
  into the greenhouse keeps it fresh."</p>

  <p>"I call it charming&mdash;a lovely little room," Lady Touchwood declared,
  as she tied her parasol up; "and the flowers that come tapping, tapping, as
  somebody, perhaps Lord Byron, says. Julia loves him; but my son Richard, who
  has Grecian features, and should be a judge, pronounces his morality
  imperfect. However, I never read such subjects. What's the use of rhyme? We
  don't talk in rhyme; and it must take a dreadful lot of time to make it. Oh,
  I should so like to take that moss-rose to my son! May I ask your daughter to
  go, and cut it for me? We can't grow moss-roses, at Touchwood Park."</p>

  <p>While Rose ran away on this little errand, the visitor told Mr. Arthur
  briefly, that she was come to speak about his dear child, and could not do it
  in her presence. So another commission was found for Rose, and she went about
  it gladly.</p>

  <p>"You have thought it very strange of me, to come so early," the visitor
  resumed, when the coast was clear, "but oh, Captain Arthur, you can make
  allowance for the deep anxieties of a mother. Tired as I was, after all the
  fag of yesterday&mdash;for, in simple truth, those parties are a dreadful
  plague&mdash;not a wink of sleep could I get last night, with perpetual worry
  about my darling boy. He never used to know his own mind at all; and that was
  so delightful of him. But now, I fear that his heart is fixed irretrievably,
  irre&mdash;something, I never can remember those big words, something like
  bad play at whist."</p>

  <p>"Irrevocably, perhaps?" asked the captain with a bow; "but, excuse me,
  perhaps that is not the word."</p>

  <p>"That is the word to a nicety, and I suppose there is no English for it.
  Irrevocably fixed his poor young heart is, upon your very charming daughter.
  Now, don't say a word until I have finished; and then we shall understand
  each other. I could have wished it otherwise, as I need hardly say; although
  I confess it would be difficult to find a nicer, a more charming; a more
  lady-like young lady. Her behaviour yesterday was simply perfect; for she
  scarcely said anything, and all she did was useful. Many of the very highest
  people were quite captivated with her. What a sweet, pretty thing she had got
  on! I am sure it must have been made in Paris. My daughter Julia was quite
  put out; and it pleased me to see, how well she bore it."</p>

  <p>"Excuse my saying that Miss Touchwood, in her style, is above all
  possibility of rivalry." Mr. Arthur felt that politeness called for this,
  after all those gratifying praises of his daughter.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, that was her own opinion. Julia never under-rates herself; as
  my son Richard always does. People make a great mistake, on that account.
  They positively think that my son Richard is below the average of intellect.
  Because he is modest, and conceals his gifts, he is supposed not to have
  them. But how could he conceal them, if he had not got them? Now that is
  sound reasoning, as you must perceive. Even Mr. Short, with all his chatter
  about logic, could never get out of such an argument as that. Yet people keep
  on saying, that we ladies cannot argue!"</p>

  <p>"There can be no greater mistake," replied the captain; "it should rather
  be said, that ladies can argue always."</p>

  <p>"I am so glad that you agree with me, because it saves so much reasoning;
  and excitement does not suit me now. I consider you infinitely superior, in
  the style of your mind, to Mr. Short; who has the nastiest way of putting
  things. And I have always found the military far more reasonable than the
  clericals. Now, you have been an officer, haven't you, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Mr. Arthur, who could not help smiling, for the turn was
  sudden, even for a lady; "it would be very unpolite on my part, to decline a
  lady's commission."</p>

  <p>"It is not curiosity that makes me ask, nor any inferior sentiment; but a
  lofty sense of duty only. The daughter of an officer, whether he has fought
  for his country, or whether he has been more fortunate, stands upon a social
  level, which&mdash;which is very excusable, for any rank to fall in love with
  her. But Captain Arthur, if this is to go on, you would, I trust, leave off
  gardening. It is a very amiable peculiarity, especially if you lose money by
  it; which elevates it above trade, and makes it quite respectable. You must
  not feel hurt, at my expressions, but to have your name upon a
  basket&mdash;what would the county families say?"</p>

  <p>"I have not considered the subject yet, from that point of view, which is
  a new one to me. But would the county families pay for all I should lose, in
  the way of wicker-work?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not; for they are dreadful screws. They sell their grapes, and
  pine-apples, but they object to the appearance of their names. However, you
  might have a private mark, a star, or a lion, or your family crest; so we
  might get over that objection. But you must come out of your retirement,
  Captain Arthur; your seclusion, I might even call it. You must resume your
  rank, and visit people."</p>

  <p>"Lady Touchwood, you mean well, and kindly. And I am bound to hear, what
  you have to say, not only with courtesy due to a lady, but also with some
  gratitude. For you have not touched on one point, which would have been the
  foremost, with many ladies placed as you are. You have not spoken of my
  poverty. Of that I am not ashamed&mdash;for no one need be&mdash;still it is
  kind of you, not to refer to the difference in worldly goods between us; and
  for that, I respect, and like you. And that makes it far more difficult for
  me to say, what I must say, before we understand each other."</p>

  <p>"If it is anything about&mdash;about any misunderstanding, between you and
  the law, surely we can get it put to rights. Sir Joseph has such influence,
  in the very highest quarters."</p>

  <p>"No, there is nothing of that kind," he replied, with a smile that was
  perfectly convincing; "I have never done anything felonious. My seclusion is
  of my own seeking. What I have to say, is about your son, who is a most
  amiable, and lively youth. He brought a new spirit into our dull round; and
  we all missed him greatly, when he left us. But if there were no other
  obstacles, although, as you clearly see, there are plenty, there is a fatal
  one at the outset. The character of your son is not formed yet. He is
  volatile, versatile, clever in his way; but a perfect boy, at present."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what his father says," Lady Touchwood answered, with
  unwonted self-control; "but youth is a fault that will right itself. You will
  not condemn him, on that account."</p>

  <p>"It is a fault that should right itself, before marriage, and even before
  an engagement is formed," Mr. Arthur said decisively; "unless the lady is of
  strong commanding spirit, and can shape her lord. My little Rosie is gentle,
  sensitive, warm-hearted, loving, and impetuous sometimes, but never inclined
  to be imperative. She is wholly unsuitable for your son."</p>

  <p>"Then am I to understand, Mr. Arthur, that you decline to have anything to
  do with my Dicky?"</p>

  <p>"By no means; I am always glad to see him; and indeed I have a hunt in
  view for him. But concerning of my daughter, as the people say here, it is
  not to be thought of; and I can trust her."</p>

  <p>Lady Touchwood looked at him, with anger in her eyes, and the vertical
  lines of temper, on her forehead, deepening into a puzzle of dismay. She
  wanted to say the rudest thing that she could think of, and cast about for
  it, and would have found it, if the eyes of her antagonist had either
  flashed, or wavered. But the captain regarded her, from his superior height,
  with a gaze of good will, not only philosophical, but of the very finest
  breeding. "He must be somebody. Perhaps he is a lord! He would jump at Dicky,
  unless he was a lord," were the ponderings of her mind, which made her
  humble.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Captain Arthur, that you mean it for the best." She relapsed,
  from the baffled issue of great wrath, into the common-place, as hot people
  do. "You are the best judge upon such matters. You have seen a vast deal of
  the world, that is certain, from the common sense, of what you say. Nobody
  gets common sense, without it. I am disappointed. I can say no more. My son
  is an exceedingly interesting young man; and hitherto nobody has been able to
  resist him. He is so much accustomed to have his own way; this will be a
  bitter blow to him."</p>

  <p>"And it will do him good, a weight of good, a world of good. You will have
  cause to be glad of this little check to his rapidity. Ladies have such
  sympathy with love-affairs, that they scarcely ask how they will react upon
  themselves. If your son were engaged, before he is a man, what peace would
  you ever have with him? Every day, he would vow to be married to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"That is true enough," said Lady Touchwood. "How you have understood his
  brave nature!"</p>

  <p>"Then, if you let him marry, what would come of it? His bride would be
  everything, while she was a bride; and he would even be rude to his dear
  mother. Let him wait, ten years, Lady Touchwood; and he will be a man by that
  time; or at any rate, he ought to be."</p>

  <p>"Your advice is excellent," the lady answered; for some of her tenderest
  feelings had been touched. "Dicky is already very difficult to manage. And if
  he had a wife to encourage him, my condition would be dreadful, as you say. I
  quite agree with you, that he should wait for many years. But I have such a
  dread of his being entangled by some objectionable person; and he turns up
  his nose against girls with money. There is a most charming girl, Chrysolite
  Moneywig; not half so nice as your daughter, I admit, because she is
  captious, and conceited, and a prig, and thinks too much of literature, and
  she dresses according to the poets always; which is the most absurd thing,
  with a hundred thousand pounds. However, I could keep her down, no doubt:
  because she must be a foolish thing. But Dicky is afraid of her; and she
  won't have him, unless he should happen to be senior wrangler. And he doesn't
  seem to care to be that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Never mind; let him act according to his lights," Mr. Arthur answered,
  with a cheerful smile. "You are happy in having a son, Lady Touchwood, who is
  healthy, active, and easily pleased, and as frank as the day, about
  everything. Such natures are happiest in the long run; for they seldom fall
  into great depth of trouble. He will soon get over this, and be as bright as
  ever."</p>

  <p>"But will you break it to him? He has been so plaguesome. Yesterday
  something made him frightfully jealous. And you have more influence with him,
  than any one. He always speaks of you so highly."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I will; if you wish me to do so. I will be gentle with him; as
  I need not tell you. And it is better to act at once, decisively."</p>

  <p>With this understanding, Lady Touchwood left, feeling more good will
  towards Mr. Arthur, than could have been expected in so delicate a case.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; PERILOUS ENTERPRISE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Whenever a thing begins to move, it is wonderful how it will
  go on. There was a man in Devonshire, who lay in bed, as his own wife said of
  him, for one and twenty years, with no other reason than because he liked it,
  and found his constitution thrive. He enjoyed a pension, from the British
  crown, of twelve shillings a week, paid quarterly; because his
  father&mdash;much against his own desire&mdash;had received a bullet intended
  for a member of the royal family. It appears, that the fate of the parent
  dwelled, with singular force, upon the filial mind; and the son reasoned
  justly, that as his dear father had brought on his decease, by standing up,
  he of the next generation might avoid the like result, by lying down. It is
  impossible to penetrate into the human mind; and this man's motive, or
  determination not to move, may have been even larger. However, there he was
  for thrice seven years; and the neighbourhood respected him, because he did
  no work. And he might have been there now, if he had only stuck fast. But
  there came a new curate, of uneasy mind, who fancied that this man was
  neglecting duty, and who would rouse him up to a sense of his position. He
  made him get half-way up at first, and look out of the window, and see the
  river; and with six months of energy, he stirred him up into his breeches,
  which were hanging on a peg by the door; like mildewed stirrups, when the
  horse is dead. Even a pensioner may thus be killed. The poor fellow saw the
  churchyard, from a window going downstairs, and shook his head; for he
  preferred a pillow to a tombstone. For a few days, he exerted some reluctant
  steps, and then became a walking funeral.</p>

  <p>So it is also with the rest of us, who must get out of bed, because we
  have no pension. When once we get out of the tranquil horizontal, into the
  whirl of the vertical state, we are hurrying ourselves, very much against our
  own desires, to a larger world. Neither is that, however bad it may be, by
  any means the worst of it. For we have provoked, into a restless mood, things
  that are only too glad to have some excuse, for not standing still on us.
  With sudden alacrity, they begin to slide; and like sticks in an avalanche,
  we go too.</p>

  <p>The perception of this great truth was clearer, in the ancient times, than
  it is to-day. We find it consistently impressed upon us, by the chorus in
  Greek plays, by Pindar also, and the wise Theognis, and the genial Herodotus.
  Hence, with flowing weight, it descends into the grand lines of Lucretius,
  the torrent of Catullus, and the sudden turns of Horace. And there used to be
  plentiful sense of it with us, till loftier science took command of
  sense.</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. George Gaston was a very able man, and one of great activity;
  therefore he laughed at the maxim of antiquity, <i>quieta noli movere;</i>
  which is, in our vernacular, "let sleeping dogs lie." He had roused up
  sleeping dogs, to make them follow him; and at first they seemed to do so,
  without troubling him to whistle. But before very long, they began to sniff
  about, and make little excursions on their own account.</p>

  <p>In this man's arrogant inroad on Mr. Tucker, he had been guilty of the old
  mistake of supposing, that Devonshire people are thick-headed, with a
  thickness that leaves no space inside. It is not to be denied that their
  skulls are solid; but every melon-grower will maintain that the substance of
  his rind has its own advantage, and enhances the coolness of the choice
  contents. Therefore it would have been a more sagacious act on the part of
  Gaston, to have kept his temper, poured graceful praises on his host's glass
  drum-sticks, and cordially departed, with a hope to come again.</p>

  <p>Not that this excellent old gentleman, retired from the timber-trade,
  fostered any twist of sap about it. His grain was good, and he would cut up
  well; and before he was cut up, or even cut down, he was a fine piece of
  maturity, and sound at core. The impertinence of his red-faced guest was gone
  from his mind, when he said his prayers, that night. And when it was brought
  up again, the next day, by some indignation of his sister, Mr. Tucker only
  said, that such a class of persons was below the contempt of right-minded
  people. And the only thing that acted on his mind at all, was a doubt whether
  it might be his duty, to write to the gentleman on Dartmoor, and tell him,
  that some low fellow was inquisitive about him. But doubting lets the time go
  by; and time went by, without a letter to deliver.</p>

  <p>All this was according to the manner of mankind; who, when worthy of the
  name, cast off as a plaguesome burden, little enmities. But even as a man may
  kill his own queen-wasps, and bring in their bodies, and have them pitied;
  so, if he is too magnanimous to kill them, somebody will set forth, to do
  that duty for him, and probably it will be a lady.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Giblets, and her daughter Mary, when they heard what the
  high-coloured man had said, and done, longed only to run after him, and pull
  him off his horse. But finding that he was gone too far, for any chance of
  laying hands on him, they consoled themselves with some fine old proverbs,
  whose pith was, that their time would come. And so it did, to their own great
  amazement; although they had been so confident about it. For it happened that
  the whilom Mayoress of Barum (whose Mary had been born into a silver cradle,
  as well as with a silver spoon in her mouth) possessed a sister of a
  wandering turn, who, after many ups and downs, had turned up well. That is to
  say, she had married a man for the third time&mdash;not the same man, of
  course; though such a thing has happened, in these cycles of
  divorce&mdash;and the third time was lucky, as it ought to be. Husband No. 3
  made up for 1, and 2, who had gone to their rest at the public expense; for
  although he had entered on the matrimonial stage, with more courage than
  cash, he obtained his reward. He invested £5, on his very wedding-day,
  reasoning well that he could not be hit both ways; and only keeping fifteen
  shillings, for the outlay of the honeymoon. Fortune repaid his manly
  confidence so briskly, that his £5 turned into five and twenty, before he got
  his first uxorial wigging; that is to say, within three days. For that was
  the golden era of the railway rush, when even solid heads were spinning, and
  generally got the worst of it, in clashing with the light ones. In a few
  months, Mr. Snacks was worth more than five and twenty thousand pounds; then
  he got in his cash, invested in safe mortgages, which were almost going
  begging, bought a nice house near Regent's Park, and only kept a small amount
  in speculation.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Snacks had always borne in mind the kindness of her brother, Mr.
  Tucker, and her sister, Mrs. Giblets; both of whom had helped her, to the
  best of their convenience, in the bygone days of poverty. And now she longed
  to make them some return, as well as to show them her new house, and prove to
  Mr. Snacks what she had always said&mdash;that she belonged to a family, he
  might be proud of. Also there was a little Snacks by this time, the first
  fruit of the lady's triple conjunction, and he seemed sometimes to languish
  for lack of admiration. Neither was it utterly beyond the book of fate, that
  some of the pleasant timber-merchant's money might be directed, by a
  hospitable turn, towards his godson, the junior Snacks. Mr. Tucker however
  declined stage-coaching, and could not bear the jolting of the rail beyond
  it; which the driver of the <i>Quicksilver</i> declared would kill a bull.
  His sister, being younger, might attempt it, if she chose; and Mary could
  never have enough see-saw. Therefore, these two accepted invitations; and a
  swing was put up in the old walnut-tree, to bring them into training for the
  tossings of the line.</p>

  <p>It must have been the middle of July, when they were ready; and they all
  wept heartily, when they said "good-bye." The travellers took a cask of
  salted butter, three Devonshire hams, and a round of spiced beef, and
  asserting (to assure themselves) their confidence in Heaven, set forth upon
  this enterprise of ambition, and audacity.</p>

  <p>After many marvels, and a vast prolongation of their lives&mdash;if life,
  as is now contended, can be measured only by perceptive jerks,&mdash;these
  two positively were in London; and they thought so little of it, that their
  minds were gone. They would not say a word, to hurt the feelings of Aunt
  Snacks, who set this down to their abashment; but as soon as she was gone,
  they declared in one breath, that Exeter was much the finer city; and that
  London was all trees, and little windows, and big spikes, without any
  Fore-street, for the folk to come together.</p>

  <p>And the more they saw of our vast metropolis, the less they thought of it,
  and the more they wanted to be back again, in a town where they knew the
  people. There was nobody, in this stuck-up place, even to touch his hat to
  them; and although they never looked for it around their house at home, they
  liked to have it done, and contrived to let their tradesman know, if his
  young men failed to do it. They felt that they were downright strangers here,
  and could not expect to be saluted, and must get accustomed to be passed,
  like posts. They saw that it was reasonable; but they did not like it.</p>

  <p>To the acclimatized urban mind (degenerating into the less urbane), few
  things are more wondrous, than the memories of their "country cousins." If a
  genuine Yorkshire, or Devonshire man&mdash;before the railways spoiled them
  both&mdash;ever espied, in a country lane, a Londoner trying to enjoy
  himself, and met him again, after changeful years, as a cock upon his
  own&mdash;or rather let us say, as a gentleman treading his own street, the
  rustic would hail him, and invite him to a parley, and tell him what his hat
  and waistcoat were, when faded from the owner's memory. That gentleman's
  large heart might be fervent with great business; but the other would never
  let him go, until he declared that he remembered all about it.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. Giblets, and her daughter Mary, walking in a broad North-western
  street, suddenly espied the red-faced man, they did not by any means act
  thus; but endeavoured to preserve their dignity. They gave one another a
  nudge, to point perception, and enjoin discretion; and then they walked past
  him, with their bonnets turned aside, and their countenances lost in many
  ribands of eclipse. Mr. Gaston caught a glimpse of bright country colour, and
  marched on, none the wiser. But they, with a spirit beyond their wont, and
  inspired perhaps by the air of town, turned, and at sagacious distance
  followed, to see what became of that very odious man. To find out where he
  lived, would be a precious feather in their caps; for Mr. Tucker had
  reproached himself, over and over again, for letting that visitor go, without
  knowing more about him.</p>

  <p>"Mary, you leave it all to me. But your eyes are more younger like." Mrs.
  Giblets spoke with some excitement, because she was obliged to walk rather
  fast, and she had just been enjoying a long look at a turtle, as the relict
  of a mayor was bound to do, and she had longed to go in, and tell them who
  she was; and afterwards it made her sigh to walk, not for two thoughts of the
  animal, but only from remembering what her husband said, when the silver
  cradle was sent home, with a lace coverlet, and a Bristol turtle in it; for
  if any one knew how to do things well, the Barnstaple people in those days
  did. "Mary, you push on afront; he wouldn't know you again, so soon as me;
  because you be scarcely come to any size yet; and his cousin, Sir Courtenay,
  had acquaintance of your father, unless he were a story-teller, which I do
  believe of him. Keep you on, my dear, because you are so limber; and you may
  surely count on me behind&mdash;the same as they put the pelisses
  here&mdash;to come a long way afterwards. But be sure that you walk
  fittily."</p>

  <p>Mary, like a child, was proud as Punch, to be so important, and to walk
  alone in the perilous streets of London; however, she preserved discretion,
  and walked fittily, even when her dear mamma was a hundred yards behind her.
  For the red-faced man strode along at good speed; and short Devonshire legs
  had to go two for one, to keep him anywise in view.</p>

  <p>At length, in a place where the street narrowed into a road, without
  windows on either side, Mr. Gaston stopped, at a door in a high wall,
  unlocked it, and entered, and slammed the door behind him. A little further
  on, there were large folding gates, with real timber trees overhanging them;
  such an entrance to a mansion standing back in its own grounds, as Mary had
  seen in the outskirts of Exeter, but did not expect to find in London. "It
  must be some very great man that lives there, a nobleman at least, and
  perhaps a prince," Mary Giblets said to her mother, when she met her coming
  round the corner with an anxious heart; "don't cough, mother, or he will hear
  you. I dare say he is inside the wall, now just. He looked back once, and I
  thought I should have dropped. It was just the way he looked at me, when I
  skipped through the stile of the little ham, where the bull was."</p>

  <p>"Don't you be put upon your ropes, my dear," Mrs. Giblets answered calmly,
  though her clothes were hot; "if it is a prince as lives behind this wall, it
  never can be Red-face himself. He may be the butler, or the man-cook; for you
  heard what your Uncle Snacks said yesterday. They keep a man to roast and
  boil, in London, because of their complexions being cooler. And like enough,
  that is why he hath a ruddy countenance. But come you in here, and have a
  bun, dear heart. It is a little shop; and I love a little shop, because it
  looks like double-bakes. And if they don't know nothing else in London, they
  know better than hath visited our country, how to keep the glasses and the
  plates together."</p>

  <p>These two ladies were not only thirsty, as ladies nearly always are, but
  also hungry to a very large extent. For the air of London, with its fine
  circulation, brings into the upper stomach of the recent visitor a very
  delightful (although to the slower mental faculties imperceptible)
  recognition of prime joints, revolving at the bright well-springs of all that
  smoke. Possibly, that is not the cause, or only one among many; but the
  upshot is the same. When people from the country come to London, they are
  hungry at the end of every street, or sometimes at the beginning.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I should ask, I am sure," Mrs. Giblets said to the
  pastry-cook, as he would have been called in Devonshire; "for we have such a
  number of large houses in our parish; but do you happen to know, sir, who
  lives across the road, inside that wall? It looks so respectable, and rare in
  London."</p>

  <p>"I conclude, ma'am," answered the pastrycook, "you are only just come from
  the country?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, yes; to some extent. But we know a great deal about London
  ways; and every day makes a difference. We are accustomed to a city; and this
  does not seem to be one."</p>

  <p>"You are right, ma'am. We are quite in the country here. Two and
  eightpence; fourpence change."</p>

  <p>"But you should not speak with so much haste. Mary, my dear, look in my
  purse. I thought I put down three and sixpence. There was four and sixpence
  in that end. Oh no, I see; I beg your pardon, sir. But you have not told me,
  who lives in there."</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, that is easier asked than answered; for they shut themselves
  up, like a convent almost, instead of doing any good to trade. But the house
  belongs to Lord Delapole; and, for all I know, he may be living in it."</p>

  <p>"But surely you must know. You must feel some interest. I do not ask, out
  of mere curiosity. We happen to have some knowledge of a gentleman, who has
  just gone in, at the door up there. He paid us a visit, not so very long
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know Mr. Gaston, do you? A very nice gentleman, no doubt. Ladies,
  you had better go, and ask him about his own business; for he knows it
  best."</p>

  <p>"How horribly rude these London people are!" Mrs. Giblets exclaimed, as
  they walked away. "They positively seem to care no more about you, the moment
  they have got your two and eightpence. However, we know the place now, Mary,
  dear; and we will set your Uncle Snacks to work. He must be the cleverest man
  in London, to have made such a fortune, in such a horrid place."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; HEARTY KINDNESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">If ever anything has been proved to the satisfaction of
  mankind, it would seem to be their assimilation to the substance wherein they
  deal. A man who desires to improve his character, or confirm his principles
  (when he finds them beginning to be honest) must strictly withhold his steps
  from many paths of life, that should be straight, but only run straightway
  down-hill. Why are the greatest statesmen of the age far beyond credence of
  the most credulous? Because they have so long handled liars, that they follow
  their turns, and fall into them. Why is the most eminent British general
  inclined to quake, when returning thanks, on behalf of our noble army? Not
  because he ever felt fear himself; but from handling so many short-service
  soldiers, fugitive as a cheap French jelly.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, to deal in good stiff stuff, sets a man up, and puts
  core into him. A man who sells wire-netting, when requested to quote lowest
  prices, at wholesale rate, by post tomorrow (after a long interview, and a
  half inclination to come down), stiffens up again, and writes&mdash;"Dear
  sir; We are sorry to have quoted our price too low. Upon examination of our
  books we find"&mdash;something that rose in his conscience only. Whereas a
  good dealer in soft woollen nets can scarcely refuse any reasonable
  offer.</p>

  <p>Throughout the years, which Mr. Caleb Tucker had spent in honest business,
  the timber chiefly in demand was oak. For every sort of work that was meant
  to last, in exposure to the wind and rain, people insisted upon having oak;
  and the blessings of free-trade (which, like those of Isaac, have descended
  upon the wrong head hitherto) had not yet filled our walls with cracks, and
  our diaphragms with quaking. This power of material had helped to consolidate
  Mr. Tucker's character, so that he could read the most important letters,
  without losing half a mouthful of his breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Dear Uncle Caleb," said the one upon the table, "mother, and I want, oh
  so sadly, to be home again with you! There are no cob-walls here, and no
  flowers, unless you pay a lot of money for them; and a little cracked cabbage
  you would take to the pig-sty, costs twopence halfpenny, and impudence too.
  There are plenty of nice people, but they live so far apart, that you may go
  miles without seeing them; and even then, they have no time to spare."</p>

  <p>"What a number of complaints&mdash;poor little Mary!" Uncle Caleb
  muttered, at the bottom of three pages; "well, it will teach them to enjoy
  their home. Halloa! What is this? I must read slowly."</p>

  <p>"We have come across a thing, that you ought to know; and I am afraid that
  I cannot tell it clearly. Do you remember that gentleman, who came on
  horseback, in the spring, and behaved so badly? You were quite upset by his
  bad manners, because you would not answer all his crooked questions. You
  doubted very much, whether he had given his right name; and you talked about
  going to the gentleman on Dartmoor; but old Jerry fell so lame, that you
  could not do it; and you said that you did not like to write about it. It
  seems that his name was right enough, and better than his nature, as we say.
  We met him on the streets, about a week ago, and found out where he lives,
  and all about him. He seems to be a steward, or agent, or whatever it is, to
  a wealthy nobleman, who has a great house, all walled in, almost like a
  country place. And he is a very strange man, they say, and may go off at any
  time. Uncle Snacks knows a great deal about him, because of his being in the
  railway line; and this lord will not let them come through a field of his,
  without fighting for it. He seems to have no one to care about him, except
  the servants, and it makes him fret; for he lost his grandson a little while
  ago, a fine boy, but he caught the small-pox. And not so very long ago, he
  had lost his son, the father of his grandson; and they say that he has
  another son somewhere, who disgraced himself shockingly, back in the
  war-time, and never could get on with his father. But now Mr. Gaston tends
  the whole of his concerns, they say, and he is accounted unusual honest;
  although they live like cats and dogs, for his lordship has a temper, and so
  has Mr. G. Uncle Snacks told me to write all this; and mother says no lawyer
  could have done it better."</p>

  <p>"Neither he could," said Mr. Tucker, going to the fire, for some more hot
  fried potatoes; "though it requireth to be read again, to know which is
  which, of all them, 'he's.' 'Tis late in life for me to meddle with the
  concerns of other folk however. But here comes different sign manual to the
  foot of it. Must have my thick specks, they new ones is like
  shop-fronts."</p>

  <p>With the help of his thick horn spectacles, which he was not allowed to
  wear on Sundays&mdash;and this was a Sunday, as his breakfast proved, for he
  had sausages with his fried potatoes&mdash;the dealer in oak, of former days,
  made out the thin scrawl of the jobber in shares, whose hand he had never
  seen before.</p>

  <p>"Dear sir. If convenient, you should come up. Mary says, that you know all
  about things going on, I won't say where. Robbery, which might be regretted
  when too late, and worse things to come afterwards. With best respects, yours
  faithfully, John Snacks."</p>

  <p>"Well! I did intend to go to church. And I will go to church, because I
  hear the bells," Mr. Tucker thought slowly, and with memories of childhood;
  "the best ideas always come in church, because they have no business."</p>

  <p>He did as he had said, and came to this conclusion, that his duty by no
  means required him to go to London, upon other people's business; but that it
  might be a matter to repent of, if neglected altogether. Old Jerry (the only
  horse he owned at present), although getting better, was scarcely fit to
  climb stony places with a tender feeling; and his master, after looking at
  him in the afternoon, resolved to take the chariot of Pugsley, towards the
  heights of Christowell. Pugsley had no right to carry passengers for hire,
  and no one must go over Exe-bridge with him, unless it were a child of tender
  years, such as Rose Arthur used to be. But if Master Timothy discovered on
  the road a respectable wayfarer, looking weary, his manner was to ask him
  whether he would ride, in a social rather than commercial spirit; though it
  tended, by-and-by perhaps, towards half-a-crown.</p>

  <p>The carrier, and the timber merchant, knew one another on the road of old,
  and cherished mutual respect. And Mr. Arthur, from time to time, had sent a
  present of fruit, or flowers, or honey, to his city friend, by good care of
  Pugsley. Therefore, after long discourse, and easy turns of summer lanes, Mr.
  Tucker was set down within a mile of Lark's Cot, in the early afternoon.
  Timothy would have gone further with him; but the old gentleman's legs were
  good, and as there was nothing in the cart for the captain, he would not work
  the old horse on. How to get home, was another question; but he was sure of
  hospitality.</p>

  <p>"Why what a lovely place it is!" Mr. Tucker could not help exclaiming, as
  he crossed the little meadow, and descried the cottage, nestled in with
  fruitful trees, and plumed with roses, and honeysuckles; "it was not like
  this, when I bought it for him, but looked all bleak and shivering. All the
  work of his own hands. Ah, that is the way to fence the world out. I wonder
  if they will let me in. Pugsley told me, to pull this wire."</p>

  <p>He pulled the wire, and a bell, that hung outside the porch, made answer;
  and presently Moggy, the maid, came out, with an apron over her head, because
  she had curled her hair on Sunday; and after a parley in broad dialect, she
  went to look for her master, up the stream. In a very short time, Mr. Tucker
  was resting in the pleasant bower by the brook, while the captain was opening
  a bottle of cider, and Rose was gone to the house, to speed the prospects of
  an early dinner.</p>

  <p>"I am heartily glad to see you once more, in the place that owes
  everything to you," Mr. Arthur said, as he filled a long bright glass, with
  brighter liquid. "You see, that I am quite a native now, and trying to
  advance upon the native ways. Tell me what you think of that. A perfect cure
  for gout, and rheumatism. How many kinds of apples are there in it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps twenty; or there might be fifty," Mr. Tucker replied, with
  the fresh colour flowing into his cheeks, and a polish on his lips; "it is
  fine enough for fifty, as we say."</p>

  <p>"Three, and no more," said the captain slowly, and with stress upon every
  word; "three, and no more, is the secret, or at least the main secret, of the
  way to do it. But who knows an apple from a pippin here, or a pippin from a
  crab, or a crab from a service? You may talk for ever; but they only know,
  that 'their veythers always did this, or thiccy; and they don't need to be no
  wiser than their veythers was.' They admit that mine is better; they can't
  help doing that; and if any one is ill, they send for it. But as for budging
  out of their own ways, or trying to learn one tree from another&mdash;they
  tell me, they actually have told me several times, that it goes against
  Genesis, and the Parables!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is all the better for them,"&mdash;Mr. Tucker was a Tory of
  good type,&mdash;"to be contented with their ancient ways. They make it
  anyhow, and they drink it anyhow, and they thrive upon it soberly. But if
  their liquor was like this, they would soon be above their work, and be
  getting gout, for the sake of such a medicine. People are always gabbling
  now, about elevating everybody. Nobody knows what it means; and I would
  rather see them hanged; because there you are. Good health to you, my
  lord&mdash;for so I believe you are by this time."</p>

  <p>"I have not received any notice of it; and hope that you may be mistaken,
  Mr. Tucker. It would be the worst thing, that could befall me. In the outer
  world at least."</p>

  <p>"We never know, what is good for us;" it appeared to the timber-merchant,
  that it must be good to be a lord; "and I am too old to be carried away, by
  any ups and downs of life. But at first sight, sir, it looks like promotion;
  and I promised myself some pleasure, in offering first congratulations. But
  excuse my saying that you take peculiar views of things."</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Tucker, I do not. I look at things, as every gentleman, and every
  man of honesty, in whatever station, must look at them. You know part of my
  story, but not all. When you know the whole, you will merely say, that in my
  place, you must have done the same. But tell me, what have you heard about
  me, or rather about my relatives?"</p>

  <p>"It appears from this letter," the old man answered, spreading his niece's
  long epistle on his knee, and feeling (as a true Briton must) some pride in
  this connection with the peerage, "that your elder brother is dead, my lord;
  I have not the exact date of his death; but his departure from this world
  seems certain."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of that. I avoid newspapers; as I have good cause to do.
  However, that came to my knowledge, through an accident. But before you go
  further, let me beg of you one thing, in which I am sure you will oblige me.
  Do not call me 'my lord;' but speak to me, just as you always used to
  do."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tucker bowed, and smiled, and then proceeded. "Well, sir, I peruse the
  papers; as a man in my humble position must do. But I was not aware, until I
  got this letter, that your brother's only child was dead. He appears to have
  been carried off by small-pox. Sad indeed for any one, but most sad for the
  heir to an Earldom, and large property, where the railways want to come."</p>

  <p>"I am grieved to hear it, for my father's sake, as well as the poor little
  boy's. Are you certain, that it is so?"</p>

  <p>"If you will kindly take this, and read it, you will know as much as I
  know. The women may pick up things amiss. But brother Snacks must be an
  accurate man, to have made all his money; and he backs it up."</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur took the letter, and read the part of Mary's writing that
  concerned himself, and the brief lines of the new-found uncle, of whom Uncle
  Caleb felt dire jealousy already.</p>

  <p>"Every word of it looks like the truth," said Mr. Tucker; "though you
  never can tell nowadays. Mary is a truthful maid, as can be; but that sort
  gets imposed upon. And what do you say to it now, if you please?"</p>

  <p>"There may be a little exaggeration," the captain answered quietly; "there
  always is that, in a case of this kind. But most of it is true. Who is that
  Mr. Gaston? He paid you a visit, last spring, I see."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and a fine sort of a visit. I should live behind a river, if such
  visitors were common. We did the best we could for him, in our unpretentious
  way; and I offered him refreshment, to the best of my ability; but he showed
  himself unworthy, and made light of my intentions, because I would not
  furnish him with all information about you. I ought to have written to you
  about it; but I thought it would be better, to come and see you; but somehow
  or other, the time went by; and I humbly ask your pardon for neglect."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. It is most kind of you to come now. You knew quite well, that
  I would not see the man; and to hear of him, would only have annoyed me. But
  what in the world could he have wanted of me? Did he give you any idea?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that he wanted to see you, but to know for his own
  purposes, where to find you. Possibly to prevent other people from seeing
  you. But I will tell you what he said, that you may judge for yourself; after
  making all allowance for his off-hand style, and remembering that he would
  try, most likely, to deceive me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tucker took a pinch of snuff, to stimulate his memory, and then told
  his host, as correctly as need be, the purport of George Graston's words
  about him.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what became of him, when he left you?" Mr. Arthur asked,
  after listening to this tale; "or whether he went on with his inquiries about
  me? Having contrived to find you out, he would be pretty sure to find me
  too."</p>

  <p>"That is not so certain; for you live in a place so secluded; and he would
  not know your name. But I saw no more of him, and heard no more of him, until
  I got this letter. Only I have a suspicion, that he went to a firm of low
  land-jobbers, in the suburbs of St. Thomas. I met one of them in the
  timber-yard soon after&mdash;for I go there, now and then
  occasionally&mdash;and he called out to me, like a low fellow as he
  is&mdash;'I say, old gentleman, can you give us a glass of rum?' Of course
  that proves nothing; but it struck me, at the moment, as a remarkable
  coincidence."</p>

  <p>"You may depend upon it, you were right. He knew that I had bought land,
  through your good offices, and he seems to have known my purpose too. From
  such people, who know you, and keep no doubt a jealous eye upon your doings,
  he would speedily discover, for a small fee, all they knew; and then put them
  to find out what they did not know. I must act upon the presumption, that
  this man knows me, my name, my dwelling-place, and all about me. By the way,
  a thought strikes me&mdash;but I will find that out to-morrow. Now what can
  the motives of this Gaston be? A revengeful, malicious-looking man, you say?
  But I cannot have wronged him. His name is quite unknown to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, he must have some motive; and you may be pretty sure, that it
  is a bad one. Perhaps to get your property for himself, and blacken you to
  the poor old nobleman."</p>

  <p>"I do not see how it can be that. The property is in strict settlement. If
  all that you have heard is true, after my father's time, I must take it, if I
  choose to do so; except the merely personal part, which is trifling, or at
  any rate, used to be so. I cannot see what this man can mean, by hunting me
  out, and then leaving me in the dark."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, sir, you may be quite clear, that he means wrong, and you
  must take him for an enemy, a bitter, and crafty enemy. If he had meant to do
  the honest thing, he would have found you out by public means; or if there
  was anything against that, he would have come to you like a man, as soon as
  he discovered you."</p>

  <p>"No doubt he would; if indeed he has discovered me; and of that there
  cannot be much question." The captain looked around, as if he would like to
  know the opinion of his trees, at this cruel disturbance of their master, and
  to ask them whether they would break their hearts, at the loss of the man who
  loved them so. The trees however showed no concern.</p>

  <p>"I am sure I cannot tell, sir," the timber-merchant said, while the other
  was reflecting sadly; "you know best, what suits your life; but if I may say
  so, without being rude, within the four seas there may be four men, and no
  more, that would be sorry to be found out so&mdash;to be called to great
  wealth, and a high position, and with a dear child to inherit it. Miss Rose
  has grown into the loveliest young lady; and her manners are as lovely as
  herself. For one thing, you may thank the Lord, sir&mdash;if I am not to call
  you, by your proper title&mdash;and that is the opportunity you have had, of
  bringing up a sweet simple nature, without any of the spoilings of the world.
  She never would have been like what she is, if her lines had fallen among gay
  rich people."</p>

  <p>"There is much truth in what you say, my friend. And you may be sure that
  it has occurred to me; though nothing in the world could have spoiled my
  Rose. But it is on her account, that I am most perplexed. If it were not for
  that darling child, I could act according to my own wishes, which are very
  simple, and have long been shaped. But her interests must be thought of, more
  than my desires."</p>

  <p>"Certainly they ought to be. No just man could think twice, upon such a
  point as that." Mr. Tucker spoke decisively, and almost sternly; for he was a
  man of strong clear sense, and had often condemned, in his own shrewd mind,
  what he thought to be the sensitive weakness of the other. "You may have your
  own ideas," he continued, "and your own views of happiness, and contentment;
  upon which I have never ventured to intrude, in spite of your flattering
  confidence in me. For yourself, you have a perfect right to judge; but for
  others&mdash;however it is not my place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not your place," Mr. Arthur answered, looking at the old man
  gratefully, "to offer advice, without a thorough knowledge of all that has
  happened to us. This you have never had, for various reasons; most of which
  are now gone by. You knew very little of my affairs; and yet, through some
  sympathy, you took my part."</p>

  <p>"Ay, that I did; and I couldn't tell the reason, unless it was the trouble
  on the both of us. Your dear wife was dead; and mine was gone; and a faithful
  partner she had been. 'Caleb,' she used to say, 'never you be hard; it comes
  so easy to be hard; no fear of nobody neglecting that. But it needeth a man,
  to be soft, my dear.' Perhaps her meaned, that the women wasn't so. But
  goodness knows, she never meant no harm. There I be talking, as if I wasn't
  eddicated! All of us does, when we thinks of trouble; from the way we go on,
  in the natural times. And then you came, with your hat-band on; and there was
  no complaint outside your eyes. And I was dwelling upon her, that
  moment."</p>

  <p>The turn of the old man's mind had brought the long review of his own life
  up; and the captain, having much of his own to look back on, waited for his
  sigh, before speaking again. For the sigh of the old, is the spirit's adieu
  to a mournful subject, until next time.</p>

  <p>"But we must have another talk about this cider," Mr. Tucker continued, to
  save abruptness; "it should be indeed a thing to talk of, if a stranger could
  beat all Devonshire, like this! When you have time, sir, whenever you have
  time, I shall be happy to meet you, on that subject; for I used to fancy that
  I understood it, and I made an improvement in the presses once; and I ought
  to have had a patent for it."</p>

  <p>"I hope to have many good talks about it; and especially about the best
  fruit for it," the captain answered briskly; "for the Devonshire apples
  puzzle me; partly by their local names, and their infinite variety, but still
  more, by their general badness. I can go on talking about fruit, for ever,
  when I find any one to care about the subject, which I scarcely ever do. I
  suppose, we are all born with a turn for something; however the turn of our
  lives may obscure it. But I see, by the top of the kitchen chimney, that our
  plain dinner is as ripe as a good fig. My daughter will call us, in about two
  minutes. You have walked far to-day, and you ought to be hungry; or at any
  rate, you must be tired, my good friend."</p>

  <p>"Not as I knows of," Mr. Tucker answered; for Devonshire legs go up and
  down, by power of habit, without much strain. "But at my time of life, that
  comes afterwards, to think of."</p>

  <p>"You shall not walk another step, to-night; except to my cottage, and a
  stroll by-and-by, if you fancy it, in my garden. We will make you as
  comfortable, as we can; and my Rosie is no bad hand at that. You have been a
  very true friend to us, Mr. Tucker. I never like to press my affairs upon any
  one; for we all make a great deal too much fuss, about ourselves. But if you
  would like to hear my little story, to which you have never had the key as
  yet, you would do me a favour by listening by-and-by; and even a greater one,
  by your advice upon it."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I may say, though I am not curious, that I have very often longed to
  know it."</p>

  <p>"Here comes my darling! She shall go to bed early. For I would not disturb
  her, on any account. And then, if you are not too tired, you shall know, what
  has driven me to this peculiar life; though I do not complain of it, and wish
  for nothing better. The happiest of mankind is he, who does what he likes,
  and yet works hard."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; JACK O' LANTERN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">John Sage had now spent several weeks in Colonel Westcombe's
  service, giving, and receiving the most lofty satisfaction. Without the
  warmest urgency, on the part of the pisci-capturists (for a fish is not to be
  called a fish now, and everything connected with him is pisci-something), the
  colonel never would have spared this wisest, and therefore best, member of
  the human race. But it had been felt on every side, that John was the only
  one who could do it; and even at Touchwood Park, it was whispered, that old
  Sage was the first to put it into Master Dicky's head. But John, with a
  guinea in the lining of his waistcoat, took a view of all of them; and walked
  away in silence. For, if so be, he had boasted much, he could have done no
  less than stand treat.</p>

  <p>He was perfectly capable now of standing treat, and might have had credit
  for a side of bacon, at Betty Cork's shop in Christowell. But he shunned all
  extravagance, took his pint as usual, in exchange for good advice, and
  enjoyed his three-halfpenny rasher with his wife, when he came home on
  Sundays, to applaud Parson Short. And when he rode down the hill, from
  Dartymore desert, on the colonel's old gray pony, there might have been found
  in front of him, by insidious search beneath his old hill-coat, a bag of some
  capacity, not idly so endowed, but exerted to its utmost, to contain good
  things. For he had advised the colonel's cook, how to fetch her sweetheart
  round, when hankering after less peppery charms; and the female heart excels
  the male, in being grateful <i>gratis.</i> And, though the high principles of
  old John were far too prudent to accept the very sweetest essence of unlawful
  meat, and compelled him indeed to keep a sharp look-out, that nobody else did
  such a thing, he found himself enabled, with all imaginable honesty, to
  secure some peaceful tributes to domestic virtue. The colonel knew, that he
  went forth in marching order, on a Saturday, victualled for his camp that
  night, among the Pixies, and the Kists; which demanded body, and spirit too,
  in the liquid half of nourishment. And the only reason old John had, for
  putting his coat upon his bag, as he rode into Christowell, and buying, in a
  public manner, that rasher for three-halfpence, was that if he failed to do
  so, the hospitable feeling of his neighbours would compel his wife to give a
  tea-party, as soon as ever his back was turned.</p>

  <p>If ever a man deserved such things, and better than the best of them, John
  Sage used to feel that man, inside his own shirt, as he rode proudly down the
  hill. Full of the spirit of the moor (which always rushed upon him
  gloriously, as soon as he was off it), he despised these people, who had lain
  down here, like a pack of cowards, asleep all night, and were coming out now,
  in their shirt-sleeves, after being lathered by their wives&mdash;for the
  barber could not find soap for any one, under a penny&mdash;to be shaved; and
  then (as if they had done a brave thing) would go back, and blow the bellows,
  till the kettle boiled. And all of these, when they looked at John,
  considering where he had passed the night, instead of being critical of what
  he had in front of him, were almost afraid to say, "Marnin' to 'e,
  Maister!"</p>

  <p>In such a lofty character, there scarcely should have been a single
  vestige of conceit. And knowing what he was, he strove his utmost, not to let
  other people know. But, with the usual wilfulness of fame, the less he spoke,
  the more she blew his trumpet; until he could scarcely have his pipe in
  peace, and was obliged to bar the door, before he filled it. And then he used
  to meditate upon his many dangers, and flourish his stick in self-defence,
  until he broke his pipe-stem. For Weist-Tor, where he had to pass the night
  of almost every Saturday, was enough to make a man enjoy existence, when he
  got away from it.</p>

  <p>"Sage, I shall be glad to have a talk with you, this evening," Mr. Short
  said, when he came out of church, one fine Sunday in August, with the
  congregation drawn up outside, for the secular postscript to his good
  Church-words; "come up about seven o'clock, if you can." This vicar, after
  learned and impartial research, had come to the definite conclusion, that
  Sunday ended at six p.m.</p>

  <p>John Sage thought it hard, to go all that way, with his legs still bowed
  from so much saddle, and his supper, by that time, sure to be inside him. But
  his mind was up with admiration; for the sermon had not contradicted his
  opinions; and he saw that the parson meant no less than half-a-crown. So he
  promised to go; and in good time went, recalling to his mind that he never
  could have won his fine rise of wages, without the parson's word. Moreover,
  he valued Mrs. Aggett highly; and he knew that excessive self-respect was the
  only power that could have stopped her, from coming on a Sunday afternoon, to
  gather sweet particulars about the cook at Westcombe. Therefore he opened the
  vicarage gate, with a mind at once loyal, and lofty.</p>

  <p>"How famously you look, John!" Mr. Short observed, as soon as the wisdom
  of the village was shown in; "you have recovered all the substance of your
  wrestling days. You used to be a fine hand at it, I am told, with a trick of
  the inner crook, of your own invention."</p>

  <p>"Ay, sir, I have drowed a good few vormerly. But there bain't no wrastlin'
  fit to speak of now. Last time I went to see 'un, I were compelled for to up
  sticks."</p>

  <p>"I can understand the wrath of a scientific hand. They tell me it is come
  to a mere bout of kicking. But you were the champion, at one time, Sage."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, no. I wor not big enow for that. I could drow any man, within
  two stun of me. But there used to be men, as could take me up with one hand,
  and shake me like a handkercher. What use of playing, with such men as them?
  But their mothers never bring forth such men now."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is true," said Mr. Short, considering himself with
  sadness; "I fear that the Englishmen get smaller, like onions sown where they
  grew last year. But, John, let us come down from such great subjects. You are
  doing very nicely, over there, at Colonel Westcombe's?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I never complain. Vact is, I be too old, to begin
  complaining."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever leave off, John?" the parson asked, with a quick look, such
  as he gave them in church, when he hit their thoughts, with his own almost.
  They always liked this, because it showed that they were men; and now old
  John grinned&mdash;which he very seldom did, else would his fame have been
  far smaller.</p>

  <p>"A' maight be better; and a' maight be wuss."</p>

  <p>"That means, that it is as good as can be. And you know as well as I do,
  John, that you never had such a kind master before. Now, if you take
  advantage of him, if you sit upon a stump, and go to sleep, if you get too
  much into his back kitchen, or put too much into your bag on a Saturday
  night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"However did they rob you, Maister? You be that sharp, I should have
  thought it were not compuss!"</p>

  <p>"If you do such things as I have said, John Sage, you will not only lose
  the best place you ever had, but you will be a disgrace to Christowell, and
  to me who recommended you. I know, that you are a very honest man; but I also
  know that very honest men begin to slide, under too much opportunity. Now
  when you come home, on a Sunday morning, bring your bag, like a man, without
  any coat over it."</p>

  <p>"Passon, you be too bad; and a' most unlike a Christian, after all the
  holy things you be bound to think of, leastwise on the Sabbath day. I never
  wud a' drummed to you, a' church this morning, if I cud a' zeen the inside of
  your mind. I be dree score year and five of age, and no importation on my
  karákter yet. And who is there, as would come home across the moor, wi'out a
  bit of zummat, to the front of him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, John, you know that I am speaking for your good. You bear a high
  character, and you deserve it. Whatever is given to you, is your own; if the
  proper people give it. But bring it as your own, without concealment. That
  was the first thing, I had to say to you. But I also have another thing, upon
  my own account. How often are you sent to pass the night, at Weist-Tor?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes once a week, sometimes twice. According to the weather, and the
  doings of the birds. But I wudn't baide alone there, for a thousand pounds
  a'most. Joe cometh with me, always."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. Your son Bill's boy. Colonel Westcombe employs him; and it
  all helps up. You must have passed a dozen nights there, by this time. Have
  you ever seen anything particular?"</p>

  <p>"Sartin, sir. His Honour had a door put up, to keep the wind out; and us
  always goes together, to look out; afore bedding down upon the hathe. No, I
  never draw my money wi'out arning of it. Sometimes 'twould be the moon, and
  another time the stars, or leastwise the clouds in front of 'un. And once
  'twas Jack o' lantern, so sure as I be living!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Short, "that does seem odd. I have heard of him a hundred
  times, but never seen him. I would ride fifty miles, to see that thing. You
  shall have a guinea, John, if you can put me up to it. I shall come, and
  visit you, some night, when it is likely. But what did Jack o' lantern do,
  that night you saw him? And did you go down, to look after him?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord forbid! Why, passon, you know, as well as I do, 'tis sartin
  death to volly 'un. No, no, us barred the door, and kept each other company.
  Joe be as brave a'most, as I be."</p>

  <p>"How long is it, since you saw that sight, or peeped at it, and ran away,
  you brave generation?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, maight a' been a fortnight mainly. I don't keep no account of
  time, too partiklar. The Lord hath ordained for us martels not to do so, with
  our eyes looking forward to the kingdom. But it wur of a Tuesday; that I be
  sure of, by reason of the time to kill the fowls."</p>

  <p>"Tuesday is the day, that a sheep is always killed. How many Tuesdays,
  have you been there? Try to recollect; you are famous for your memory."</p>

  <p>"Never of a Tuesday, but that once. Nobody can put up they fowls but me,
  wi'out a clack coming out o' their tongues. They be such a noisy set, to that
  side o' the moor. And once the good lady, that, keepeth to her chimber,
  heer'd them a gruntin', when it wur done badly; and his honour come out, and
  I told him they were vules, and cudn't administer kingdom come, to a young
  cock with dacency; and so he saith, 'You do it then; John, you do it for the
  future time.' And I did sixteen on 'em, wi'out a murmur; and ever since then,
  I has to do it. But happened one Tuesday, they was to have a holiday; and
  that wur the night, us seed Jack o' lantern."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Sage. Now will you manage to do them early, Tuesday next,
  unless they are to have another holiday? And then, to be up on the hill, that
  night; and I will come to you, to see Jack o' lantern. If we see him, you
  shall have a guinea; and if we don't, you shall have a crown. Don't say a
  word of it, to any one; unless your master gives you orders not to go. If he
  does that, just say, that it is my particular wish that you should be there;
  and then, he will be sure to let you come. But I don't want young Master John
  to know a word about it. If he did he would insist on coming too."</p>

  <p>"Sartin sure, he wud. He be a push-about young gentleman. No, no, I wun't
  let 'un hear tell of it. Passon Shart, it shall be done, ezakly to your
  bidding."</p>

  <p>Any man, who has not been on Weist-Tor at night, or at any rate towards
  evening, might underrate the courage of John Sage, and his grandson Joe, in
  sleeping there. It is perfectly true, that they barred the door, and stopped
  their ears, if they heard a noise, which it was wiser to ignore than to
  inquire of; but still every right-minded person knows, that if love laughs at
  locksmiths, a power (too often supreme in love) ridicules the blacksmith too.
  Can any bolt, or bar, keep out the Devil?</p>

  <p>There is not only this to be considered, but also the general tone of the
  place, without such visitations. At any time of day, this is very bad indeed,
  because there is nothing to enrich, or even soften it. Somewhat as a man of
  rugged nature, or a roguish elephant, hardens into his own bad seams, from
  lack of female society. But when the night comes down from heaven, or
  deepens, without any sign of heaven, up the long hollows, and over the grey
  waste, fantastic things stand forth of shadow, and images of fear perplex the
  distance.</p>

  <p>"Bravo! Here you are! Well done, my friends," Mr. Short exclaimed, for he
  was glad to see them, as the long day went to rest; "what a large place it
  is! I began to think, that I should never find you."</p>

  <p>"Good eyes be needed, to find the biggest man, as ever trod the earth, or
  the biggest thing, he hath ever piled upon it, in the loose ways the land
  hath here about. Little Joe, and me, be like a pair of murmets, hurning about
  on a big tombstone. Passon, here be pulpits, and the word of God to preach
  from." John Sage put down the bone of ham, that he was sucking, upon a
  kistvaen, and gazed largely around.</p>

  <p>"I have been here before," answered Mr. Short, who never would be capped
  with his own hat; "but one forgets this sort of place. Did you bring a bone
  for me, John?"</p>

  <p>"Must needs be a dry one, to agray with such as you, sir. But coom inzaide
  the little 'ouze, sir. A' be done winderful, winderful golaightly."</p>

  <p>"So it is. Very clever, very cumpuss, as you say; and with nicks in the
  rock, for you to hide in, if the enemy beat down the bar. And here you sleep,
  on this sweet heather, as plum as any horse-hair. It might blow, and rain,
  for fifty hours, without a drop, or a breath upon you. You have chosen your
  place well, with the scoop of the crag to shelter you, and the standing slabs
  for your side-posts, and your little roof of furze, and ling, the colour of
  the rocks around. The pixies themselves could scarcely find you, unless you
  make a fire here. But, where do you keep the pony, John?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, he never wandereth far, unless the moor-ponies comes a 'ticin
  of 'un. But he hath a bed of 's own close by, under the big loggin stone. Us
  can hear him gruntin', as he drameth; and a' maketh rare company, by night.
  But, passon, 'tis an unkid place, and requaireth a brave man, with the fear
  of the Lord around him, for to smoothe his eyes to slape."</p>

  <p>"You have had your supper, and you want your sleep," replied Mr. Short;
  for he never encouraged what he called "Psalmodic piety;" and he knew that
  all men, who live under the sun, must follow him with their inclinations;
  "take little Joe inside, and bar the door. I shall want no help from you. But
  show me first, where the Jack o' lantern was."</p>

  <p>Old Sage saw, that his courage was not held in very high esteem; but he
  felt, within himself, that it lacked no vindication. Therefore, he was
  satisfied with showing, by some general signs, where the dancing light had
  shone; and then, to keep all blame away, he called his grandson to hear him
  say&mdash;"The Lord have mercy upon thee, passon! Thou bee'st a minister of
  He. If thy horders draiveth thee, to vollow up the Evil One, us will come,
  and zee, when thou hast catched un." With these liberal sentiments, he pulled
  his head in, and barred the door.</p>

  <p>Mr. Short had inherited much, from his grandfather, the admiral, of even
  greater value than the Victory chronometer. Among the best of these things,
  were sturdy courage, and strong love of justice; both of which seem to be
  evaporating now, into clouds of magnanimity. The parson sat down, in a square
  niche of rock, which fitted him better than if made to measure; and from the
  pockets of his shooting-coat, which was made of stout dark fustian, he drew
  forth some little things he had prepared, with a hope that they might prove
  useful. There was no kind of fire-arm among them; nor even what was then
  called a "life-preserver;" but there was a running noose, of supple round
  leather, and some strong silk rope from his own window-curtains, and a
  steel-chain, ending with a short spring-loop. He considered these a little,
  and arranged them, so that he could pull out any one, or all, when needed;
  and then, making up his mind for some hours of patience, lit his pipe, and
  calmly watched the deepening of the darkness.</p>

  <p>Not even a sheep, or a dump of a pony, broke the contracting gloom before
  him, with a spot of movement. Down the hillside, slabs of granite, tilted
  against one another, or leaning out of the earth, or piled (like tombstones,
  in pictures of the Resurrection) glanced the faint descent of light, still
  overlapping the western crest; upon which the cumbrous tor was losing its
  jagged blackness, in the growth of night. The restless wind, (that ruffles
  the scanty herbage there by daytime, and bares the edges of desolation,)
  after a few weak, moaning shivers, sank into the universal calm; and there
  was not even the twinkle of a star, to mar the dark brown depth of night. "If
  ever he wanted his lantern, he will want it now," thought Mr. Short; "but how
  deadly cold the air is getting!"</p>

  <p>He arose, and flapped his strong round breast, with thickset arms, and
  solid hands; and then walked to and fro, for half an hour, on a narrow track
  of safety, at the bottom of the tor. Below this, yawned a great rock circle,
  of the kind that is called "Druidical," though probably quite as true a work
  of nature, as a fairy ring is. To rush through this, in the darkness, would
  be to tempt at least a broken leg; and he had marked his track, to the right
  or left, before the gloom became so deep. Also he had brought a strong oak
  staff, to feel his way down the hill, and to assure it; for his chief fear
  was of bogs. But these are either slightly luminous, or else intensely black,
  upon a summer night like this. Whatever he did, he must preserve his presence
  of mind, and walk with care.</p>

  <p>At last, when he was almost beginning to weary of the shivering solitude,
  a faint light twinkled far away; and then disappeared, and then shone
  clearer, down the valley towards the right. Then, it began to rise and fall,
  and stop sometimes, and even vanish, as something intercepted it; but upon
  the whole, it was coming nearer; like the light of a vessel beating up
  towards the bar. Although the weather, and the time of year, were suitable
  for that phosphoric proceeding, known as "Will o' the Wisp," in the north,
  and "Jack o' lantern," in the south of England, the parson, without thinking
  twice, was sure, that he had no pale spectre of that sort, before him. In
  that particular seam of hill, up which the light was advancing, there was no
  morass, nor even peaty quagmire; but a little rill, running down a narrow bed
  of rock-scoop, scarcely so wide as a mangle, and tufts of gorse, interlaid
  with short sweet grass&mdash;shelter, meat, and drink, and music, for the
  serious-minded sheep. "Ah, he knows what good mutton is; and perhaps that is
  why he did not eat mine. Mother Aggett will so over-flour it."</p>

  <p>With these reflections, ill-suited perhaps to the gravity of the moment,
  the vicar of Christowell made some steps, towards a clearer knowledge of the
  case before him. He knew, that he was going to a perilous encounter, with a
  man as superior to himself in size, as inferior alas, in principle. But he
  relied upon the justice of his cause&mdash;as everybody does, who ever goes
  to war; and although his grandfather's clock was gone, he had serious hopes
  of getting back some rusty remnant of his other household gods. But, just as
  he was setting forth, a squeaky little voice came after him, and a little
  figure followed it. "Oh, do 'e let me coom, passon; do 'e let me coom, 'long
  of 'e."</p>

  <p>"I am surprised to see you here, when all good boys are fast asleep. Go
  back, Joe Sage, to your grandfather." Mr. Short spoke crossly; for he warmly
  "undesired"&mdash;as the western improvers of our language put it&mdash;to
  have his little expedition talked of, all over Christowell, to-morrow. "Go
  you to bed," he said; "and tuck your little toes up."</p>

  <p>"Grandfather be aveared of pixies, sir," said the boy, still holding on to
  him; "but I been to schule, outside of your parish; and I ain't got no faith,
  in none on 'em."</p>

  <p>"Then, go back, you unhappy little sceptic," Mr. Short answered, without
  applause; for he knew what comes of that warty state of mind, which crop-up
  lads get into. "The birch is the right thing, for you to believe in."</p>

  <p>Little Joe Sage was discouraged by this view of his intellectual
  advancement; and he went back slowly, till his footsteps dropped into the
  silence of the hill. But then he turned, and listened, and pursued the vicar,
  at safe distance, and with frequent palpitations of his small, but not
  ignoble heart.</p>

  <p>Feeling his way down the steep, with his stick, and watching the movements
  of that light, the wary parson kept on steadily, until he came to a furzy
  bottom, where a small brook tinkled through. Here were many little windings,
  such as water brings to pass, and juts of sudden turn, and even a breadth, or
  two, of flat land among the furze. It was much too dark to make out all that;
  but according to the general manner of the moor, there would be short sweet
  pasture here, and gentle slopes to lie down upon, and herbs that improve both
  the flavour, and texture, of a conscientious mutton.</p>

  <p>The Dartmoor sheep is a thoughtful fellow, who knows what a greedy world
  it is, and therefore sleeps with one eye open. As Mr. Short came down this
  hollow, two or three woolly forms rushed by him, elder members of the flock,
  who had taken the alarm, and made off betimes. But, whether from selfishness,
  or no worse than sleepy lapse of duty, they failed to raise the warning
  "baa," that should have stirred up their relatives.</p>

  <p>"That fellow can't be far off now; and of course he will conceal his
  light; my best plan will be to get behind this ridge, and watch what he is up
  to." With these reflections, Mr. Short slipped quietly into some broken
  ground, commanding a little strip of pasture, hedged with bushes, and granite
  slabs. Here were at least a score of sheep; and the air was thick with their
  oily smell. By the aid of a feeble glance of light, partly from a lifting
  cloud, and partly from the water, and white gravel on the brink of it, the
  watcher could make out their position, and could guess at their different
  attitudes. Some were already afoot, and listening, with short ears pricked,
  and long bald noses pointed up, to catch the air; some were half-rising, with
  their weight thrown forward, and hind feet scratching on the ground, for
  leverage; while others, of the fatter order, still lay grunting, well aware
  that something was being talked about, but convinced that it was nothing, but
  a pack of stuff.</p>

  <p>Among these last, was a very worthy wether, an excellent animal in truly
  prime condition, with a speciality of mind, which had enabled him to fatten
  in the right style, and must add superior relish to his body. Confident in
  his own integrity, and fitness to survive all other sheep,&mdash;though a
  butcher might have taken it for fitness to be killed,&mdash;this sheep
  declined all participation in the low misgivings of the leaner lot. For fat,
  when laid on in the proper places, enlarges, enriches, and ennobles the mind;
  as every one acknowledges, who has grown fat. But this sheep had little time
  for more self-gratulation. For suddenly, a long dark form was upon him. He
  found himself grasped, by the back of the neck, and raising his head to
  remonstrate, lost all further knowledge of existence. There was nothing of
  him left, but wool, and mutton; and a long carving-knife was stuck into the
  grass, among the last marks of his pretty nibbling teeth. "Rare bit of stuff
  that parson's knife is! The only prize he ever got at Oxford, I'll be bound.
  And no doubt he stole that from the buttery."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short, as he heard that most untrue description of his university
  career (which had been good), found it very difficult to hold his peace. But
  keenly apprehensive of the <i>suo sibi cultro,</i> he kept his head down, and
  laboured not to grind his teeth. For he knew, that if he did prevail against
  this Ajax, it must be by the tactics of Ulysses. There stood the
  slayer,&mdash;as the grand speech has it,&mdash;but there was not a symptom
  of remorse as yet, and to-morrow's sun might announce, to Mrs. Aggett, the
  decease of the wrong man, the one who paid regularly eightpence halfpenny a
  pound, for all his mutton, "I will stick here, instead of being stuck;"
  thought Mr. Short, with that brevity which made his sermons so
  delightful.</p>

  <p>The skilful slayer took his time as well. He had once been famed for
  hospitality; and the desertion of his friends, which ensued upon his trouble,
  though it might have blunted, had not wholly soured a nature capable of good.
  And in fact, he was making preparations now for a dinner-party, upon a good
  scale, to a highly select list of rogues at the <i>Raven.</i> One, or two of
  these had expressed some doubt, concerning the quality of Dartmoor mutton;
  because they had only had it, as supplied by contract, at the charges of the
  British prison-ratepayer. And undoubted as their right was to good things, in
  gaol (when restricted of their right to steal them), not one of them had sat
  down to a good juicy leg, till they came to believe, that there was no such
  thing. This was enough to make any man labour, when he had nothing else to
  do, to establish his opinion, by some very careful work. Without this in
  view, Mr. Wenlow perhaps would scarcely have come upon this hunting-ground
  again, and at night; when a sheep might be shot any day, or at any time of
  night, with comfort. But it was his business to regard things now; and
  whatever faults there might be in his constitution, it was good of him, thus
  to desire to impart the results of his long experience in mutton. However,
  this virtuous weakness led, as it too often does, to calamity.</p>

  <p>It was a time of year, when meat must not be thumped about, or used as a
  weight to be "putted," or a hammer to make holes in its dear brother joints;
  as railway porters treat it now. Mr. Wenlow, understanding this, proceeded
  with hospitable care, to sling his good animal upon his back; so that the
  prime parts might ride well. With the aid of his lantern, which had been left
  in brief eclipse, he nicely corded the cold hind-feet together, then
  carefully wiped his knife, and thrust it into a sheath at his left side.
  Then, after blowing out his candle, and concealing it; with a trifle of a
  groan, he shouldered this fine weight of mutton, and found that he could
  manage it. Not that he meant to go, all the way home with it&mdash;for strong
  as he was, that would have tried him&mdash;but only to get to a cool dry
  place, where his prize might be stored, for future operations. "I ought to
  have him now," thought Mr. Short; "I will let him get tired; and then tackle
  him."</p>

  <p>The sheepslayer, under his burden, walked with a long heavy stride, which
  prevented him from hearing any light sound of pursuit. So that, although the
  night was very dark, and still, the parson could keep him pretty well in
  view, with the help of the white body, hanging on his back. And it was not
  likely that a man, with such a load, would depart from the downward track, if
  he could help it. For the ground was uneven, though not bouldery, nor
  morassy; and a strong man had as much as he could do, to get along, with a
  weight, like a bag of potatoes, to stoop to, and small opportunity of picking
  every step. And sure enough, before very long, this began to come hard upon
  the wind of Mr. Wenlow. Mr. Short heard him begin to pant a little; and then
  he could see, that the sheep, upon his back, was swagging about, as if its
  death had been a dream, and it were trying to get up, to graze again.</p>

  <p>"Now I will have him, as he had Mother Aggett, and cord him fast to his
  own dinner."</p>

  <p>Meditating thus, and with presence of mind in every quick joint of his
  body, the vicar of Christowell, who was a wonderful hand at knotty subjects,
  came swiftly behind the sheep-felon, and flung a running noose of well-soaped
  round leather (formerly the rein of <i>Trumpeter)</i> over his head and down
  his arms, and then tightened, and turned it, on the backbone of the sheep.
  "Halloa!" cried Mr. Wenlow; and "Halloa!" replied Mr. Short; but paused for
  no further conversation. In a second, he had hitched his running rein, and
  passed the silk rope of his curtains, round the knees of the man who had
  invaded his domestic life, and knotted it strictly, in that crampy portion of
  the human system. Down went Wenlow, with his foul deed on his back, and
  fouler words issuing vainly from his mouth; which was stopped, by the soft
  obstruction of a clump of moss, of the <i>Sphagnum</i> order.</p>

  <p>"To swear is as futile, as it is wrong;" the parson remarked, while he
  tightened up his knots, and proceeded to add to the embarrassment of his
  prisoner, by buckling some straps around him. "My friend, you are captured;
  and your wisest course is, to reconcile yourself to the situation. I don't
  want to hurt you, more than I can help. There, now you may be quite
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>"I am chok&mdash;chok&mdash;choking;" the other gasped from out the moss;
  "if you don't want to kill me on the spot, take that d&mdash;d sheep off my
  neck."</p>

  <p>"By no means, my friend. You put him there yourself; and it is not fair to
  blame him. However, hold up your nose a moment; and I will give you more room
  to breathe." With these words, the parson drew forth his own knife, from the
  sheath at the side of the robber; and smiling at the oddness of the
  situation, mowed the moss around his prisoner's face; who moved his nose
  nervously about, from this novel mode of shaving. "My hand is very steady;
  keep quite still. There now, you will do nicely," continued the vicar; "and
  can safely express any gratitude you feel."</p>

  <p>"I don't feel much;" replied Mr. Wenlow.</p>

  <p>"From long experience, I never expect much;" the other answered
  pleasantly. "But how long, can you stay here, without inconvenience?"</p>

  <p>"Either murder me at once; or take that weight off me."</p>

  <p>The prisoner uttered this, with such a painful groan, that Mr. Short was
  really afraid to leave him so, while he went for the needful help to deliver
  him to justice. Humanely, but unwisely, he relieved him of that burden, while
  taking good care not to release his arms, or legs. Then, feeling that his
  fastenings were all secure, and knotted out of reach of any twisting power,
  the parson sat down to recover his breath (for he had been working nimbly),
  as well as to consider, how to carry on his work. It had been a very hard job
  to catch this fellow; and now it seemed a harder one, to dispose of him, when
  caught. Here he was, at midnight, many miles away from any inhabited house
  that he knew of; and though the tall man could have carried him with ease, it
  was out of his power, to carry the tall man. If he could have set him up, to
  begin with, his head would have hung upon his hat-crown, like a gurgoyle;
  while his heels dragged on the ground, like the hoppers of a seed-drill.
  Meditating thus, Mr. Short, with joy, heard a squeaky little voice, and
  beheld Joe Sage. "You are a brave boy," he said; "and here is a brave job for
  you." Then giving him careful directions, and promise of a crown-piece, if he
  deserved it, the vicar set off for a long trudge across the moor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; FAST BIND, FAST FIND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Arthur, and his guest, Mr. Tucker, sat up, that night,
  far beyond the usual hour of bed-time, at Lark's cot. When a man begins to
  tell the story of his life, however concise he may attempt to be, he is
  pretty sure to wander into many side issues, and get entangled among
  incidents, that require explanation. The timber-merchant, though accustomed
  to an early pillow, listened, with scarcely a yawn, to the long, and rather
  strange, narrative of his host, and made him repeat some parts, to be sure of
  them; so much at variance did they seem, with the ordinary course of human
  nature.</p>

  <p>"Whether you be right, sir, or whether you be wrong, is not for me to
  judge," he replied at last; "all dependeth on the thing, that should be
  uppermost; when two big principles run counter to each other. But whether you
  be right, sir, or whether you be wrong; there is not a man in fifty thousand,
  would have done, as you have done."</p>

  <p>"I have not been free from doubts myself," his host acknowledged, with a
  weary sigh; "and that has made it so much harder for me. But now, knowing
  everything, will you tell me, what you believe to be my first duty?"</p>

  <p>"Give me the night, sir, to think it all over; though I don't see, how
  there can be much doubt about it. But I never heard tell of such affairs
  before; and things might come across me, like enough, in the night-season;
  and the head is always clearer, in the morning." The thing, that was coming
  across the old man, was sleep, heavy sleep; for he had walked far that day,
  and the change to the Dartmoor air was lulling.</p>

  <p>"It is too bad of me, to keep you up so late," Mr. Arthur said, as he
  looked at his watch. "Good night, my friend; and no dreams of battle. What a
  poor life it is to dream of!"</p>

  <p>After shaking that honest old hand right heartily, the captain sat down,
  to compose his mind, which was stirred with the many-pronged fork of memory.
  It was not to please himself, that he had told his tale; but partly that he
  might not appear mysterious, or churlish, to a trusty friend, and partly
  because he did really desire advice, in the present see-saw of his fortunes.
  A strong man scarcely ever takes advice&mdash;except in professional
  questions, or the like&mdash;still he may be glad sometimes, to have it, and
  consider it; even as he would contemplate a pill.</p>

  <p>While Mr. Arthur was meditating thus, in the flatness that follows
  excitement, he heard something soft strike the window behind him, which he
  had just closed for the night. At first, he took it for the flip of a bat, or
  perhaps of a Sphinx-moth, attracted by his light; but when it came again, he
  went, and opened out the lattice; and there he saw a rosebud, upon the sill
  outside.</p>

  <p>"Come down softly," said a voice which he knew well, though forgetting,
  for a moment, whose it was; "I want to speak to you, without disturbing any
  one." Mr. Short made certain that he must be known; but his friend, with a
  mind intent upon its own affairs, took a big stick before he opened his door;
  for the outer world was very dark, to eyes contracted by candle-light, "Don't
  knock me down," Mr. Short said briskly; "I am not a thief&mdash;no such
  luck&mdash;only a thief-catcher."</p>

  <p>"Set a thief, to catch a thief," replied the good man of the house; "but
  what have you done with him, and what is it about? Come in, and tell me all
  about it. You are tired; you want something."</p>

  <p>"I never wanted something more, in all my life. Starvation is staring me
  in the face; and dark as it is, I don't like her looks. I feel as if I could
  crunch a bone, after <i>Nous</i> had polished it."</p>

  <p>"You shall have as nice a bit of cold salt round, as ever came from
  Moreton. I was lucky to have it in the house, for we have had an unexpected
  guest to-day. But he is gone to bed. Is your thief fastened up?"</p>

  <p>"I defy him to get away," replied the hungry vicar; "and even if he does,
  it is better than to sacrifice a life, so valuable as mine. I spent all my
  dinner-time, in making springles; and my poor inside has springled me."</p>

  <p>"We will soon cure that," said Mr. Arthur; "come into the kitchen. It is
  the best harbour, in a storm of that sort. There now, you can talk, while I
  fetch the victuals."</p>

  <p>"Erroneous man, you put the cart before the horse. I will talk, by-and-by.
  For the present, let me feed. Sweet are the uses of adversity. The next
  fellow I see, with an empty stomach, shall walk into my larder. Ha, what a
  draught of ale! Now for the loaf! You might cut that meat, a trifle thicker.
  Shaving is a waste of time. I can't stop to say, 'thank you.' You will
  perceive my gratitude, in my proceedings. Three more slices; never mind about
  the mustard. I never tasted anything so delicious in my life! What a piece of
  luck, that I saw your candle!"</p>

  <p>"And a piece of luck for me," said the hospitable captain; "I was going to
  bed, perhaps a little in the dumps. I will take a glass of ale myself; and
  then I am at your service, if there is anything to do."</p>

  <p>"There is a lot to do; but I cannot bear to take you from your home, at
  this time of night. It is simply this&mdash;that I have caught, and strapped,
  and left in the depths of the moor, that fellow who robbed my house, and
  corded Mrs. Aggett, and stole my grandfather's famous watch. But I don't
  know, how to bring him down. Like all good-for-nothings, he weighs heavy."
  There may have been some jealousy in this remark; but the captain was
  thinking of more urgent matters. "How many miles do you think it is? And how
  long is it safe to leave him? You make a point of having him, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I should think I did. About six miles, I should say. But the moor
  scatters all one's ideas of distance."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then rest yourself, for half an hour. It will be no loss of
  time; because the moon will be rising, and then we shall be able to go twice
  as fast. Meanwhile I will get ready my <i>feretrum</i>."</p>

  <p>"My very kind friend," said Mr. Short, as he gladly took the offered pipe,
  and put up his legs to rest a little, "you often use Latin words, rather
  aptly. Among your other innumerable gifts, that one especially surprises me.
  For a man, who has knocked about much in the world, forgets straightway every
  syllable of Latin; except the examples in his grammar."</p>

  <p>"But suppose, that I was brought up for the Church? Is not the first of
  all needs, for holy orders, a lively acquaintance with dead languages?"</p>

  <p>"My object is to smoke my pipe in peace. Go you, and get your stretcher
  ready."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I believe he was intended for a parson," thought the weary
  vicar, as he worked his pipe; "and a very good parson has been lost to the
  world, by some sad mishap; not impossibly a pluck. But they never used to
  pluck men, in the good old times, half as pluckily as they do now. And the
  man has brains enough for anything; but for his extraordinary crotchet of
  manuring the ground with them. However, he is a noble-hearted fellow. Here's
  to his health, and the increase of such!"</p>

  <p>"Now, you can see what a simple thing this is," said his host, returning
  from the darkness of the door. "I ought to have a patent for it;
  but&mdash;but I don't care. It has cost me a good deal of thought, I can
  assure you; though you may see nothing worth thinking about. It has these
  four legs, so that you can rest it. And you fold it up like this; and the
  legs fold too; and it rides upon your back, as easy as an artist's easel. We
  have often had 3 cwt. of pot-vines upon it. And here, in case of heavy
  weight, we can have cross braces. You take them, and I will carry it; in
  about two minutes, we will set forth. But I must leave a note for my dear
  Rosie. She will be about, long before we can return; or at any rate, she may
  be, if anything delays us."</p>

  <p>Soon the two sturdy men set forth, with the waning moon lifting an ivory
  shoulder, like that of Pelops, from the eastern bank of haze. They talked but
  little; for the way was rough, and the captain's thoughts reverting to his
  own affairs; of which he said nothing to the parson, having done ample
  violence already to his habits, by that long narrative to Mr. Tucker. Their
  course was a winding one, by reason of the ground, and of dark water-beds
  with bogs among them, so that the pale streak of dawn began to show, below
  the mounted moon, by the time they reached the Tor. "Shall we knock up old
  Wisdom in his bed?" asked Mr. Short.</p>

  <p>"You know best;" his companion replied. "But I think, it would only be
  waste of time. We can fetch him out, when we come back; if we want a little
  change of bearers. You seem very certain, that your man cannot be gone. But I
  am never sure of anything."</p>

  <p>"If he is gone, henceforth I will believe in witchcraft," the vicar
  answered merrily; "even as my congregation do. Samson himself could not
  escape such withes."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, we had better lose no time. 'Fast bind, fast find,' is an
  excellent proverb, with a play upon words; such as most of them have. It was
  a pity, that you left that boy so near him."</p>

  <p>However, Mr. Short was as cock-sure as ever, and full of fine faith in his
  knowledge of knots. So they strode on vigorously, down the pastured
  bottom.</p>

  <p>"I could almost have vowed that this must be the spot," the parson
  exclaimed at last, with serious misgivings; "but places are so terribly
  misleading, in the dark. It must have been round the next corner, at the
  latest."</p>

  <p>They turned the next corner, and there was no other, but a long straight
  reach of open valley; neither was there any living form in sight. With a grim
  look, and a little grinding of his teeth, Mr. Short led his friend back, to
  the bend they had just quitted. "We must have passed him, among these bushes.
  It is simply impossible, that he should have moved. I defy him to have
  stirred ten yards," he said.</p>

  <p>The captain smiled provokingly, for he had some experience of the way, in
  which captives do break loose. "Show me where he is; I will put down my
  hand-barrow. We can find it in a moment, if we find him."</p>

  <p>"Of course we shall find him," replied the other; "no sane person can have
  a doubt about it. He may have rolled a little, as a shot rabbit does; but
  there is no hole, for him to creep into. Either he has rolled into a clump of
  furze, or into the bed of the brook. That's it. He has managed to get down to
  the brook, to drink. How stupid of me, to have overlooked that!"</p>

  <p>With certainty renewed, he went back to find him, and searched every tuft
  of rush, and wet growth; but there was no sheep-stealer there.</p>

  <p>"This is the spot where the combat was; and here is the mark where the
  poor sheep bled," Mr. Arthur called down to him, as the light grew clearer:
  "but neither sheep, nor man, remains. Is it your opinion, that the sheep
  rolled too?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Short laughed, and said, "You are too right. We are done; that is
  clear. I never thought about the sheep. If the mutton is gone, so the man
  must be. What a fool I was, to ease him of his burden so! And he has had the
  impudence to walk off with it. What an atrocious scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I rather admire him, for sticking to his purpose. A common rogue
  would have made off, light-footed. Gone he is, in spite of all your lashings.
  There can be little doubt, that the boy released him."</p>

  <p>"Little Joe Sage! He would never dare to do it. But what is this, stuck
  upon the furze-bush here? 'Best respects to Rev. Mr. Short, and will return
  his visit, some fine night.' Upon my word, it becomes too bad! I seem to be
  made, only to be laughed at."</p>

  <p>"Recover your spirits, my dear friend," said the captain, with a lofty
  endeavour not to smile; "there are times, when all of us have that feeling.
  But every right-minded person will look grave, at hearing of your trials, and
  how well you bear them."</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't look over-grave, to begin with," complained the poor
  parson; and then he burst out laughing, wherein Mr. Arthur joined, with
  freedom of true sympathy.</p>

  <p>"It is all very fine for you to laugh," resumed the parson, as if he had
  not been the aggressor in that vein; "but it is high time to look things in
  the face. Sheep are a property, unusually sacred in the eye of the law,
  because so usually stolen. An act of this kind is not to be passed over. When
  my goods were stolen it was <i>penes me,</i> to put up with it in silence, or
  to make a stir. But when I see another man's sheep made off with, I have no
  right to sit down, and contemplate the process. I am bound to regard him,
  with the utmost rigour of the law."</p>

  <p>"You have done that already, and a great deal more than that. You have
  made him fast to his own <i>corpus delicti.</i> But you loosed him; and he
  took his own <i>habeas corpus</i>."</p>

  <p>"It is too true; there is nothing more stinging, than amiability abused.
  However, it is not that, that moves me; but the strict compulsion of a simple
  duty. I shall have to lay the whole of this matter, before the nearest
  magistrate, Colonel Westcombe; not the nearest to Christowell, but the
  nearest to the place, where this happened. And I believe he has a kind of
  shooting-lease, of this very part, where we now stand. So that it would be
  rude almost, to apply to any other Justice first."</p>

  <p>"Certainly it would be. You are quite right." The captain detected, or
  perhaps imagined, some particles of malice in the parson's words. "If it
  becomes a matter of business, I am ready to appear, before Colonel Westcombe,
  or anybody else, who may be the proper man. But we must not blame the boy;
  until we know a little more about it."</p>

  <p>"Boys are a bad lot," said Mr. Short decisively; "they prefer what is
  nasty to nice things to talk of; and they would rather do mischief, than be
  useful. But I will get it out of him. Let us be off. Old Sage used to be a
  good sort of fellow, enormously conceited; what I call a fool of wisdom. He
  knew a great deal better than Farmer William, the senior churchwarden, when I
  spoke well; and everybody looked to him, to nod his head, before they durst
  rattle a stick in church. But since he has been at Okehampton so much, he has
  heard some fellows, who preach without a book; and it seems to have lowered
  his character. Let us go, and rout him up, at once. You had better leave your
  pot-barrow, to be sent for."</p>

  <p>"Not I;" replied the captain, with a good-tempered smile, for he saw that
  his valued friend was cross. "I am not going to have my invention stolen. The
  beauty of it is its portability. Best foot forward; and I am your man."</p>

  <p>When they came to the hut, with the beauty of the morning resting on the
  crags above, they found old John, looking wiser than a thousand Sphinxes, in
  the fore-front of the hill. "Ah, you gentlemen, gentlemen," he said, "you do
  looke crule tired surely! I cud a' told 'e, 'twur no good, to go hunting Jack
  o' lantern. Howsever, I never expects narrabody to barken to me,
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Fetch out your little rogue of a grandson; "the vicar demanded
  sternly.</p>

  <p>"Passon, have a care what you be saying," Mr. Sage answered, as he
  shortened up his braces; "ne'er a one of our vam'ly hath had that name
  applied to him, without haction, good at law. The poor buy hath been fast
  aslape all night, in the cornder, behind of me. Did you plaze to think, he
  were your Jack o' lantern?"</p>

  <p>"This beats everything!" exclaimed the parson; while the captain laughed,
  till he was almost fit to cry; and old John, with amazement, regarded them
  both.</p>

  <p>"'Twor natteral," he said, "to come of so much night-work. You good
  gentlefolks be pixie-ridden. What a many cases of it I have zeed! My own
  grandveyther had it dree times, because he were a bit weak-minded. But it
  comes off easy, when you know the cure. Go you to the biggest stone in sight,
  and make the cross upon it, and then eat fried bakkon. Her shall be ready,
  gentlemen, by the time you be; if so be, I can only get little Joe awake, to
  rout the vire up." Having washed at the spring, he went indoors apace; for he
  wanted his breakfast also.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30">CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; QUO WARRANTO?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"There is nothing to be done," said Colonel Westcombe, when
  Mr. Short had told him the whole of his adventures; "it was your duty, as
  eye-witness of a felony, to lay an information about it. But after that, you
  see, we get no further. None of us can say, what this man's name is. We have
  heard something vague about a warrant being issued, and a good reward offered
  for his apprehension. But who can apprehend him, when even you have failed?
  And, if he were taken, he would soon get off. There is not a lock-up that
  would hold him, in the county; and we could not send him off to London, if
  that is where he ought to be, without at least three examinations, and
  remands&mdash;supposing that he would stay in custody, so long; which could
  hardly be expected of him. But you may feel this, as you go home&mdash;which
  you shall not do till you have dined with us&mdash;that you have done your
  utmost, and been wonderfully near the fulfilment of a public duty. Although,
  as I have said, he would have got off afterwards, by the aid of attorneys, or
  the ironmongers. I have had some experience of the Bench already; our
  intentions are good, but we do not see our meaning. Whenever he is caught,
  (as he must be, in the end,) I hope that it may be beyond us altogether. I
  would not discourage you, from laying hands on him; but, if you can do it,
  outside our division, it would be a much better thing for everybody."</p>

  <p>"And that is your settled conclusion, is it? That, because a man is hard
  to catch, we must not attempt to catch him! If your practice with the
  Frenchmen had been such, what a thorough thrashing you would have got!"</p>

  <p>"Of course we should," the colonel answered; "and thoroughly deserved it
  too. But there never will be such a set of men again. There are no such
  fellows, in the commission of the peace."</p>

  <p>"If you consider it the right thing, to be beaten by a rogue, because you
  have none but fools to help you; there is nothing more for me to say, Colonel
  Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"Now don't be so peppery, my dear friend," said the colonel, offering an
  easy chair; "if there is anything you can suggest, sit down, and talk over it
  quietly. Everybody knows your abilities, Short. You must not imagine that
  because they have made me a 'beak,' as it is called, I set myself up, to lay
  down the law, to a clever man like you. I know nothing whatever of the law,
  any more than the rest of the J.P.'s do. We try to act, according to the
  light of common sense. And what more can you expect of us?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, nothing beyond common sense. We are glad that you should have
  it&mdash;possibly, as a new gift of office. But is it common sense, that a
  neighbourhood, however wild, and thinly peopled it may be, should be harassed
  for months, by a desperate fellow, simply because he is desperate? And that
  you, with your stern sense of discipline, my friend, should put up with it,
  and make excuses for it!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't like it. And I may be doing more than you know of, to try
  to put a stop to it. Whose sheep was it, that was killed, and stolen? He
  should come, and sign a deposition."</p>

  <p>"The sheep affair is nothing, in comparison with the rest. Are we all to
  be sheep, and have our throats cut, at the first convenience of that villain?
  How much longer, till you do something?"</p>

  <p>"That depends mainly upon circumstances," replied the colonel blandly;
  "drum-head law will not do here. There is some informality about the warrant;
  if what I was told, the other day, is true. The coroner issued his warrant
  first, somewhere in Surrey, or in Bucks, perhaps it was. And after that, the
  magistrates issued theirs; and both of them were wrong, they seem to say.
  However, that is not in any way my business; and I have heard a dozen
  stories, as to what his name is. If I could have my own way, my plan would be
  to treat him as a brigand, hunt him down, and then hand him over to the civil
  authorities, with a double twist of tent-rope, round his moving members. But
  such things are not to be done, in this age."</p>

  <p>"I fear that we are tumbling all to pieces now;" said Mr. Short, trying to
  be brisk about it; "I am not at all a stickler for the fine old times; but I
  do like a little bit of decency. When a man shows any sign of real wit, I can
  make over-much allowance for him; for the chuckle in his brain upsets his
  sense. But look at this thing, written here in pencil; there is no wit in it,
  only vulgar insolence."</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely expect," replied the colonel, examining the paper
  found upon the furze-bush; "that a man's jocosity should be at its best, when
  he has been strapped up for some hours. But I call this very fair; not
  strikingly facetious perhaps, but civil, and well-worded. And it shows good
  will, to a limited extent. Come, come, we must not be too hard upon him. I
  never did believe that story, about his murdering two women. Look! The man
  spells every word correctly, at any rate so far as I can judge; and I have
  had some experience in that, though I left school very early. Do you mean to
  tell me, Short, that any man would murder two women, who could spell like
  that, on the spur of the moment, and by a lantern?"</p>

  <p>"A' maight, and yet again a' maightn't; as our Farmer William says;" Mr.
  Short was not going to add to his troubles an argument, on so abstruse a
  point. "I suppose he has let your grouse alone?"</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe was too good to suppose, that his friend could mean, by
  that last remark, any paltry insinuation. "I don't know whether he has, or
  not," was all he said about it.</p>

  <p>"Well now," continued the vicar, who ought to have been more ashamed than
  he actually was; "I want to know, what you make out of those letters, or
  half-letters, here at the top of the paper. You see that this paper has been
  torn off, probably after being doubled down, from a sheet of
  something&mdash;perhaps a letter. The crease, which has guided the severance,
  was meant, most likely, to have come beneath the last line of the letter; but
  instead of that, it happens to have taken the last line, pretty nearly along
  its belt; as one might say. We have the lower half of the words still here;
  in some places more, and in some parts less; for the writing is not, to a
  nicety, straight, though more so than happens, in nine cases out of ten. Can
  you make out, what these words have been?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied the colonel; "'tis as much as I can do, to make out
  words, when I get them in the lump. I could not read even print, bisected.
  And, if this is a private communication, what right have we to exert our
  brains upon it?"</p>

  <p>"Every possible right, against such a villain; to protect society from
  him. I have spared no labour to decipher that bisected line; and I am pretty
  sure that I have done so; although there are some words still uncertain. With
  the upper half, it would have been much easier work; still I think that I
  have made the words out&mdash;'to remove her, at one day's notice. But beware
  of harming her.' And the signature, in the same line with it, was either Y.
  Y. or G. G.&mdash;What mischief is this fellow up to next?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, I shall be much obliged to him, if he will do it on your
  side of the moor. Over in Bovey Tracy, and Moreton, and Newton, there are
  magistrates of long magisterial descent, who understand wicked ways, and the
  way to deal with them. But here, there is nobody to give me the lead, or even
  to back me up, if I should take it. And everybody wants me to put down
  everybody else, because I have been accustomed to fight the French. It is
  quite another pair of shoes, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is, and they do not fit you; however, you will trudge on,
  till they do. You have the right stuff for it; good will, common sense,
  activity, and the love of justice. You will be the best Justice in the
  county, after two or three years of experience, and the most popular, and the
  most respected one; because of your upright, and generous nature."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be more consistent, Short; you were running me down, not two
  minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"And so I will, when it is necessary; for I give every man his due, be it
  praise or blame. But without going into that, what does this line mean? I
  make something serious of it."</p>

  <p>"If you can make head, or tail of it, although it is all tail already, you
  ought to be chief-constable of the county."</p>

  <p>"A man who can't catch his own thief! However, by the light of
  imagination, I do make some tail of it. My interpretation is, that these
  rogues mean to carry off Rose Arthur."</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe looked at Mr. Short, with intense, yet rational
  amazement. "I have known you make wonderful hits," he said; "and the
  cleverest woman in Okehampton says, that you have beaten her thoroughly.
  Still, you must have something more to show, than this broken line, before
  you speak like that."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I have other things to go by; and I will tell you what they
  are. I have not spoken about them sooner; because my friend Arthur had his
  reasons&mdash;which are quite unknown to me&mdash;for holding aloof from your
  good worship. But since you have found him out, and met him, my restriction
  vanishes. I mean, that I am at liberty to mention him to you; which I could
  not properly do before. Very well; I know, though I have not told him of it,
  that this infamous fellow, whoever he may be&mdash;has been prowling, more
  than once, about his place; although there are no sheep there to steal,
  neither is his house worth robbing. Also I know, from two or three things,
  which I have picked up, in hunting out my own grievance, that he has done
  this, at the instigation of another fellow, perhaps even worse than himself.
  Therefore, I begin to smell a rat."</p>

  <p>"I never could see into a complication," the colonel replied, with his
  honest face quite red, for he had taken a great liking to Miss Arthur; "I
  always look at men, as if they were like me."</p>

  <p>"That is the worst of being honest. You are almost sure to make that
  mistake. And poor Arthur makes it also, and will probably have to pay for it.
  He believes entirely in a stupid fellow, who means no harm, I dare say; but
  means his own good, first of all. The fellow relies on his thickness; like a
  crocodile letting down his eyelids. But he sees a deal more, than he pretends
  to see; and Betty Sage tells me, that he has been and bought a red-cushioned
  chair, to go to sleep in. It follows, that he must have had a tip; and where
  would he get it, without treachery? He never comes to church, and he doesn't
  send his children. They are becoming a nest of savages, at Brent-fuzz corner,
  where he lives. I have told Arthur, that it is his duty, to make his workmen
  come to church; but he told me, that he never meddled with such matters."</p>

  <p>"I think that he was quite right," replied the colonel; "he might try to
  persuade them; as I do with mine. Anything more is beyond his business. They
  resent it; and in their place, we should do the same."</p>

  <p>"That is true enough; and I have not pressed it. Still, the fellow used to
  come to church; and he sleeps enough for two, in the week-days. Our
  schoolmaster used to have to knock him on the head, on account of the snoring
  noise he made; and that was sometimes undesirable. But it roused up the
  others; and in his absence, old Jacobs, who must be doing something with his
  rod, has given offence, by administering a rap to men, who are considerable
  ratepayers. And that makes us miss Sam Slowbury."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that. But reflect a moment, Short. May not the want of
  this outlet for the stick have created some prejudice, in your mind, against
  the man?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. It has only induced me to consider his evil ways. And I
  do not dwell upon these large points only. But the other day, I came upon
  him, round a corner, in the thick of my friend's plantation. And instead of
  being fast asleep, he was standing up, staring as if he had just seen a
  ghost. 'What's the matter, Sam?' I said; and <i>Nous,</i> who was with me,
  pelted away, in full hunt of some enemy. Sam could not answer; but his eyes
  were jumping, like peppercorns, in a mill, going to be ground. He wanted to
  look at me; and he wanted to look after the vanished one; and also after
  <i>Nous;</i> and most of all, he wanted to be looking nowhere. So I spoke
  again; and I said, 'Sam, the Devil hath got hold of thee.' When he heard
  those words, he laid hold of a tree; and you might have heard his heart go
  thumping. 'Make a clean breast of it, Sam,' I exhorted him, in my deepest
  pulpit-voice; and he gurgled in his throat, and was trying to fetch words;
  when back comes that confounded <i>Nous.</i> You know, what the training of
  that dog is. When he has anything particular to say, or any excuse to urge
  for his failures, he sits up, and begs, like a little lap-dog. Well, he came,
  and sat up in that ludicrous style, between Sam Slowbury and me; and the
  whole of Sam's conscience was gone, in a second. I never felt more put out
  with <i>Nous.</i> I know it was unjust&mdash;you need not tell me. But there
  was a sort of crisis; and he had undone it. I shall never get such an
  opportunity again. Before I could recover my condition to go on with it,
  Slowbury was grinning, with a fine red face, and all his little budget of
  wits come back."</p>

  <p>"And a little budget will beat a big one, Short," said the colonel, who
  enjoyed his friend's upset; "I have seen that, a hundred times; and I have
  done it myself, sometimes, with the clever people. Not that I could ever do
  it, with you though, my friend. Keep out of the range of the rifle-men."</p>

  <p>"It is a trifle altogether," continued the vicar, "that I should be
  laughed at, through the sheer force of circumstances&mdash;which have been
  most sadly against me of late&mdash;by a disloyal member of my parish, who
  was just reduced properly to his marrow-bones. I care not two skips of a flea
  for that; because I must collar him, by-and-by. I trust in the justice of my
  cause, and the coal and blanket club; to which he must pay up seven shillings
  and sixpence, or lose fifteen. I shall have him full of piety, by All Saints'
  Day; but the pest is to have lost the clean breast he was making. I could not
  help giving <i>Nous</i> a smack, for his absurdity."</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to have had it yourself," said his friend; "but what do
  you suppose you would have heard from Sam? You have such a gift of putting
  things together, that you must know, (almost as well as if you had heard it)
  what had happened to him."</p>

  <p>"He had given audience to some rogue; perhaps this very villain who has
  robbed me of my watch, and who wants to have his turn with Arthur. Why should
  <i>Nous</i> have set off, like that, unless he smelled a well-known enemy? A
  common tramp, or a workman on the lounge, would never have stirred him up
  like that. He recognized some one who had wronged him, by his scent, and
  probably pursued him, till he crossed the stream."</p>

  <p>"You will lose your favourite," replied Colonel Westcombe; "unless he
  controls his feelings better. That man will kill him, if they meet again. But
  why have you not given Mr. Arthur warning, of this dangerous fellow prowling
  round his place? That seems to me the first thing, you should have done."</p>

  <p>"With an ordinary man, it would have been so. And even in his case, I have
  doubted. But he lives a peculiar life, and detests any interference, or
  suggestion. Also I have felt that, without more proof, I might do a great
  wrong to Slowbury, who has a large family, depending on his wages. Therefore
  I resolved to wait a little, and endeavour myself to intercept the danger.
  And now, I shall be glad of your advice."</p>

  <p>"I believe, that you have acted aright so far. Wisely, I mean, as well as
  justly. But what to do next&mdash;I must have time to think." Here the
  colonel began to move his thick grey eyebrows, as he always did, to aid grave
  mental process. "In the first place, it cannot be the desire of the law, that
  such a fellow should go on defying it, for ever. Sarcastic as you are, you
  can hardly maintain, that such would be the desire of the law."</p>

  <p>"One would scarcely think so; unless one judged the law, by its actions.
  And that would not be fair; because it does not judge us so."</p>

  <p>"Very well; let us take that for granted. Assuming then, as we may safely
  do, that the law would like to catch that man, how are we to carry out its
  wishes? I am told, that it would take at least a company of soldiers, not
  such fellows as they have now, but really disciplined, and seasoned men, to
  surround his haunts, and work him out. He shifts his quarters, according to
  the weather, and the time of year, and the condition of his health, which
  must upon the whole be strong; or surely he would be laid up with ague. How
  he escapes it, I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>"He must be doubled up with rheumatism, if it were not for the frequent
  change of air, and the constant use of this specific." Here Mr. Short showed
  Colonel Westcombe the cover of a pill-box, which he had found near the place
  of his conflict with the felon; and his friend knew immediately what it was,
  and shook his head sadly, that the rogue should be so clever.</p>

  <p>"He may live in the bogs for weeks together, if he has plenty of those,"
  said the colonel; "I wish I could get my young grouse to take them; for I
  fear they find the climate damp. But now, about this villain&mdash;if indeed
  he is a villain; for I hear that he entertains a high regard for me, though
  he has not extended it to you, my friend&mdash;it appears to me, that we must
  not be rash, but first get a new warrant from head-quarters; which would
  prove that we are in earnest; and then put our heads together, how to execute
  it. I don't know this matter right out, at present. As Jack used to say, when
  he was at Oxford, 'I haven't got it up;' though he never broke down, because
  he is blest with such ability. But from what I hear, he was first to be
  arrested, upon the warrant of the coroner; and when that came to nothing,
  some jealousy arose; and I don't know exactly, how it was. However, there
  seems to be a warrant now flourishing; only I am told that the name is wrong.
  However, I shall see a man on Tuesday fortnight, who will be able to tell us
  more about it. And then, we shall be able to take some steps."</p>

  <p>"But how many steps will he have taken? My dear friend, you used not to be
  like this. Did you wait, till Tuesday fortnight, when the enemy was in front
  of you?"</p>

  <p>"Not we. But that was quite a different thing. We understood what we were
  at. But now, I must tell you candidly, that I don't know." Then the colonel
  laughed; and the parson did the same.</p>

  <p>"It is all very fine to laugh," resumed the latter; "but the thing is no
  joke, after all. It seems to be a lucky thing, that he got away; or you might
  have committed me, for an assault. I shall take good care, not to risk my
  life again; if this is the proper course of justice. But who is our great
  authority, who will set things straight, in three weeks' time?"</p>

  <p>"My old friend, General Punk, has promised to be with us, for the shooting
  then. Of course, you will join us, and bring <i>Nous.</i> Now you need not
  smile; for the general has promised to go to the authorities, and put things
  straight. It is useless to beat about the bush like this. I feel the reproach
  of it, as much as you do. And the very first instant, when I see my
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The truth of it is," said Mr. Short, "that the brigands, and the
  soldiers, were hand in glove in Spain; and you love, and admire, the whole
  tribe of them."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; THE SILVER KEY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While these things thus were going on, or to put it more
  correctly, sticking fast, the people, concerned about them in London, were
  getting into active ways. Mrs. Giblets, and her daughter Mary, now went out
  along the streets, and across them too, almost as calmly, as if it had been
  Northernhay. Finding no harm come of this, they began to despise both road,
  and pavement; till the widow of Barnstaple's mayor, at last, took to hitching
  up her dress, and holding up her hand, and putting a stop to the public
  conveyances, as often as fancy impelled her to see, what that shop over the
  way was. In a word, they treated our vast metropolis, as if their own family
  had built it.</p>

  <p>"Only you mind one thing, Mary," Mrs. Giblets used to say, before she tied
  her bonnet-strings; "if any man asketh you the way to this part, or to
  thiccy; you look at him, as if you knew, but refused to hold discourse with
  him. It is the commonest trick they have, for finding out where you come
  from; and then they get you down an alley; and your friends may put you in
  the paper." To which Mary always made reply, "Not they, mother. Have no fear
  for me; 'twould take a deep one to best me now. You ask Aunt Snacks, what I
  said to the tea-fishman. If ever you saw a man look astonished&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He won't be the only one, my dear. We shall astonish more than him,
  before we get back to Exeter."</p>

  <p>For now Mrs. Giblets had strict orders from her brother, to leave no stone
  unturned, in tracing the intentions of the red-faced man. There had been some
  counsel, between Mr. Arthur, and his good friend, the timber-merchant;
  wherein, Mr. Tucker, having keen appreciation of the great human final cause,
  £ s. d., urged upon his host the expediency of going, to look after that same
  in London. However, it is not an easy thing, to break the habitude of years,
  and the sense of peace; and beyond that, the captain had good reason, for not
  quitting home just now. His foremost duty, and entire love, bound him to his
  daughter there. And to leave her, in that lonely house, or to put her
  elsewhere, or to take her with him, would all be either bad, or doubtful.
  Moreover, he had his own proud dislike, of making any overture to his father,
  after all that had passed between them; and he felt that the hand which had
  driven him away, should be held out to him, before he rushed to take it.
  Therefore, he refused to go to London.</p>

  <p>But an agent is often more impulsive than his principal; and so was Mr.
  Tucker now. To him it appeared a burning shame, that rogues should be left to
  work their will, through magnanimous neglect. On the captain's behalf, and
  with his leave, he resolved at least to watch the case, and keep him informed
  of urgency. And to help him, he could scarce have found a better ally, than
  the enterprising Snacks.</p>

  <p>That gentleman's conduct was not wholly untainted by self-interest. He had
  the privilege of knowing Messrs. Powderhorn and Bullrush, the solicitors for
  the railway company, whose hot haste had been so impeded, by the crotchety
  old earl. With the arrogance of all railway-lawyers, they had taken it quite
  as a personal affront, that their powers of compulsory purchase should meet
  with even a moderate demur. To overbear all such small nonsense, was their
  manner, with small men. But a great landowner, like the earl, was not to be
  overborne so gaily; and there were some informalities about their plans, and
  notices, which might throw them over for another twelvemonth, if keenly
  sifted, by big-fee'd counsel. Therefore they hated the earl, as if he had
  rushed into their office&mdash;which the gout, alas, prevented&mdash;and
  submitted to them, for counsel's opinion, a vigorous kick at every acting
  partner. Being aware of this perhaps unworthy, but certainly natural
  sentiment, Mr. Snacks saw his way to getting a grateful allotment, below
  market-figures; if he could only succeed in putting a big spoke into the bad
  earl's wheel. So that he shared the tender interest of his Devonshire
  visitors, in the gloomy, and rather lonely mansion, standing within those
  ivied walls.</p>

  <p>If any man wants to get into a house, where he has no right to be, let him
  set feminine wits at work, and defy them to accomplish it. It does not
  follow, that he will get in himself; but the better one will do so, and tell
  him all she sees; which is certain to be far beyond his sight. And good Mrs.
  Snacks, being stirred up thus, resolved that the mistress of three husbands
  should never be beaten, by a stupid lot of maids, who understood nothing but
  the way to bang the door.</p>

  <p>If there were time, it might seem worth while, to tell how this lady did
  get in; after carefully watching all the bays of wall, to be certain where
  the run might best be made. But although it was a noble exploit, who but she
  can tell the tale? And there is not room to let her do it; because the
  largeness of her mind embraces a family of fifty narratives, during the
  production of a single one. Enough it is to say, that some very honest
  fellow, who supplied the premises with something large&mdash;whether it were
  milk, or oil, or ale,&mdash;was persuaded to consider half-a-crown so long,
  that he set down his cans against the spring-door in the wall; and Mrs.
  Snacks, quite overcome with the heat of the day, slipped in, and fainted.
  Being still unmarried, this man became alarmed, for Mrs. Snacks was of
  considerable size; and he hurried to the house, and called out maids; in
  pursuance of whom, came the housekeeper; a truly pretentious, and excellent
  woman, married into the name of "Tubbs." At first, Mrs. Tubbs was inclined to
  be haughty, and to fetch the gardener, and a groom, and send the invader to
  the nearest chemist's shop. But as soon as she saw a magnificent gold chain,
  peeping through the sick lady's mantle, and six fine rings upon the poor limp
  fingers, the noblest feelings of humanity were touched, and she whispered the
  sad words&mdash;"Cholera, syncope, collapse, I fear! Sir John says, that it
  is not infectious. Don't be frightened, you stupid girls. Bring the poor
  dear, to my downstairs room. Luckily, Mr. Gaston is from home. We are not
  quite savages, I should hope. Stuff! If you won't help to carry her, I
  will."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tubbs knew a good deal of medicine, and kept certain antidotes of her
  own; which she longed to try first upon somebody else. And so efficacious
  were these, that Mrs. Snacks, submitting, like a martyr, to the palatable
  parts, comprising very old cherry-brandy, was able to sit up, in
  three-quarters of an hour, and confessed to a genial glow, throughout her
  system.</p>

  <p>"How sad it does seem, that we should be such poor things!" she whispered,
  through her tears, to her kind preserver; "but without that, how should we
  ever know the warm hearts from the cold ones? I suppose, that we all adhere
  to life; even when best prepared to go. And in my case, it would have been so
  sad; because of my husband, who adores me, and my child, who has such lofty
  expectations. Oh, Mrs. Tubbs, shall I live long enough to thank you?"</p>

  <p>"I trust that you will, ma'am; if you take another glass. Your colour has
  come back most charming. I was very near sending for Sir John Tickell, his
  lordship's own doctor; but you looked up at me, out of symptoms, so
  confiding. And you see, he could not have done much more."</p>

  <p>"Nor a quarter so much, dear Mrs. Tubbs. I shall always declare that you
  saved my life. It came all across me, in such a sudden way; and you
  understood it, in a moment!"</p>

  <p>"That I did, ma'am; from keeping my eyes open. What else can I do, in such
  a house as this? But there! I mustn't trouble you, with our affairs."</p>

  <p>"It seems to be a sort of institution. It struck me in that light, before
  my seizure; and I just had the sense, to think it safer than the street. But
  little could I dream of such skill within."</p>

  <p>"'Tis a queer sort of institution, ma'am. However, it is not my place to
  talk; and talk I never do, not to my own sister, though her husband is a
  tanner in Bermondsey."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Tubbs, you are quite right. People are so apt to pry; and gossip is
  so hateful. In all my life, I never could abide it, and shut myself out of
  many doors, through that. You may know what I am, when I tell you, that
  although we have a nice house, with bow windows, looking right over the
  Regency Park, it never hath come into my mind, to ask whose institution this
  was here. I look out of my windows, and my neighbours may look in; but as for
  a desire to look into theirs, the mere idea of a thought about it hath never
  been known to come into my mind."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, ma'am," Mrs. Tubbs replied, with a new light of interest
  kindling in her eyes; "but if I may make so bold, did you happen to come from
  the West of England?"</p>

  <p>"From the west, and the best of the west," said Mrs. Snacks, who could
  tell what Mrs. Tubbs was; "my father lived at Crediton, all his life; and my
  brother was the Mayor of Barnstaple."</p>

  <p>"I am not Devonshire, so to speak; or not altogether that, and that only,"
  Mrs. Tubbs answered, with her finger-tips meeting, while she thought the
  subject out; "but my father was of very excellent parentage, in Somerset; and
  my dear mother, who I lost without the knowledge, came away direct, in early
  days, from a substantial house at Appledore. And if we can only find the
  papers, and mygood husband comes up again,&mdash;which he generally does, at
  about three years, because he is a seafaring man,&mdash;the best authorities
  agree, that no one will be able to keep us out of it. Perhaps you have heard
  of the matter, ma'am&mdash;West Boddlebury farm, near Appledore?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I have, over and over again. But my husband is the one, who
  understands those things; and we have very influential friends near there.
  Some of them are at our house now; come to see London, and spend their money.
  If you could manage to come, and see us, and have a bit of early dinner with
  us, as they do in Devonshire, my husband, who is an extraordinary man, might
  thank you for saving my life, or at least prolonging it&mdash;although I feel
  a little queer again&mdash;and you might gain some information, of the
  greatest value to you."</p>

  <p>"Looking at you sitting there, ma'am," said Mrs. Tubbs, who had thought it
  prudent to take some disinfectant fluid, "with your fine west-country colour,
  such as London burns away, thinking of what you might have been in an hour,
  as our fishmonger was, bluer than his own mackerel fish; it do seem to me, to
  have been a providence, that the side-walk door was open. We have a great
  gentleman here, who is the master's master, as the saying goes, and keeps the
  household most select. None of the lower ones can get out; and he would like
  to keep me boxed up too. But I went to my lord, when I knew that he was in
  one of his kicking tempers; and I said&mdash;'My lord, is it your orders,
  that I am to be locked in here, after all the years that I have served you?'
  And he roared out&mdash;'Tubbs shall go where she likes. Tubbs has my orders
  to go, when she pleases, to'&mdash;not at all a nice place, ma'am, which I
  will not offend you by speaking of, though patronized by the nobility. And
  ever since that, I have made a point of taking my walk in the park, of a
  Sunday, and looking about for sailors' hats; for my husband must come home
  some day, and perhaps with a pocket full of money. For the Lord, He doeth all
  things well."</p>

  <p>"Indeed He does," Mrs. Snacks replied; "my husband knows all about the
  shipping, and he has some connection with the Docks. Then Mrs. Tubbs, we
  shall expect you, at two o'clock next Saturday. We generally have a turbot
  first, with Aylesbury ducks, and marrowfats, to follow. But perhaps that
  would not be to your taste. In these large establishments, you live so
  well."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, ma'am, not at all. We are kept very close here, I can tell
  you. We lead a very assceltic life; and have not even seen a lamb's fry
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear Mrs. Tubbs, we shall expect you. Here is my card, and our
  gate is never locked. Or shall we send the carriage for you? No, you prefer
  to be independent. And I will follow your example. I will just slip out, and
  get a cab, before that formidable man comes back. He might consider me an
  intruder; and that would be unpleasant to you, I can see."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," exclaimed Mrs. Tubbs, "I am not one, to be lorded over, by
  a man no better than myself. It has been going on too long. I never speak of
  private matters. But you will not blame me, when I come to see you, if I
  should make bold to consult you a little, concerning my own position, which
  is a trial beyond my mind, at times."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when this faithful person, punctual to her hour on Sunday,
  had made a pre-eminent dinner, and admired the view of a crowd in the park
  (who might be taken, thus far off, for London trees walking off their woes),
  and then had refused more Frontignac&mdash;a wine that has now gone the way
  of all fashion&mdash;because she was determined to consider slowly what Mr.
  Snacks had said, about investment, when she happened to confess that she had
  put by, in spite of hard times, just a little bit of money; and when she had
  been persuaded, as a favour, to everybody present, and especially her host,
  to relent from that refusal, and touch flower-bells with Mr. Snacks (who was
  an exceedingly pleasant man), really such a desire to please those, who had
  pleased her so much, became established in her kind heart, that Mrs. Giblets,
  and Mrs. Snacks, and even Mary&mdash;although she was ordered to run away
  three times, and so lost three half minutes, before she ventured back
  again&mdash;one with another, putting things together, could enter into all
  the affairs of that interesting house, almost as clearly, as if they had the
  privilege of living there.</p>

  <p>To put into a few words a story which cost many, the present Earl
  Delapole, although by nature of haughty and imperious vein, in his later
  years had fallen deeply under the influence of a man, who had made his way
  upward from post to post. From the position of farm-bailiff, and
  rent-collector's deputy, upon a small part of the earl's estates, he had
  risen to be the general agent, steward, manager, and master. There still were
  times, when the rightful lord, who was of a very suspicious mind, would
  rebel, break out most violently, and order his enemy to quit his sight, and
  his premises, for ever. At such times, Mr. Gaston used to fling out of the
  house, and bang the door; but the next day, he was back again, having made
  himself indispensable; all that violence only tightened the noose, as with a
  well-set wire. Mrs. Tubbs could not say, whether she considered him a rogue,
  or not; perhaps, if he had not been so boisterous, and so domineering, she
  would have thought him deficient in principle; but she had never known a
  rogue, with a voice so loud, and a face so red.</p>

  <p>The earl, being now in his eightieth year, was falling, more and more
  completely, into the power of this tyrant. No one ever came to brighten his
  dulness, or divert his mind towards any kind of charity; although he must
  have a mint of money, in land, and houses, and leather bags. Mr. Gaston would
  take good care of that. Only his doctor, Sir John Tickell, who always went
  about with a trumpet&mdash;which perhaps was make-believe, because he hated
  questions&mdash;and his lawyer, Mr. Latimer, though even he seemed to be shut
  out now, and his shaver (who could not be shut out); these were all that were
  let in now, with any sort of grace about it. If any old gentleman, who had
  carried on highly, in the fine old times, with his lordship, desired to shake
  him by the hand once more, and to lighten it up for him to hold on, and to
  say things witty, as they used to be&mdash;there was no other message, when
  his card came in, but that his lordship was in great pain to-day. And so, the
  very best of them dropped off; gentlemen, who must have been the foremost of
  their day, in carrying on high wickedness. Mrs. Tubbs liked them, because
  they were gentlemen; not such soft-mouths, as you see now. But although she
  liked them, and they liked her (as their compliments on her appearance
  proved), she durst not authorize man, or maid, to show them up to his
  lordship's room. And this had grown sadly upon the earl; quite according to
  Mr. Graston's wishes; ever since the grandson died, following that poor lord
  his father, who had never been much to speak of. However, it was known among
  the older ones, that there was another son somewhere, or at any rate there
  used to be; but the earl had refused to have him mentioned, because of some
  trouble that he had been through. And although he might forgive him now, for
  the sake of the land, and the title, Mrs. Tubbs was sure, that Mr. Gaston
  would give him no chance of repentance.</p>

  <p>"That is how things always goes, with our great families;" said Mr.
  Snacks, a liberal of the largest order, who liked the world to go up and
  down. "Men who think, that nothing less than a coach and four, of their own
  driving, is fit to come through their property. Their time is pretty well up,
  on this earth. But the son, if there is one, should be looked up; to make a
  good title to the company."</p>

  <p>Through the caution of the timber-merchant, none of those present knew,
  that the missing son could be found on Dartmoor; though some of them began to
  suspect it.</p>

  <p>"But if these troubles go on much longer, what am I to do?" asked the good
  housekeeper, who felt that she might have unburdened her mind, to bring worse
  burden afterwards; "I can throw up my situation, of course; and goodness
  knows, it is a gloomy one."</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am, no!" exclaimed Mr. Snacks; "you must not contemplate such a
  step. For the good of the family, you must not do that. You are so placed,
  that an immensity depends upon your discretion, and forbearance. Tomorrow is
  Monday. I will feel my way, towards getting you those shares we spoke of. If
  I succeed, as I fully hope to do, your money will be doubled by Friday
  morning. My investments are never speculative; but sound as the Bank of
  England. I will not say a syllable, to disturb your mind. Cast off every
  thought about it. I shall act for you, with even more discretion, than I
  should employ about my own affairs. And I think I can promise you another
  thing. From my intimate acquaintance with the Docks, I shall have the
  pleasure of telling you next Sunday, if you most kindly repeat your visit,
  the latitude, and longitude of Captain Tubbs; and perhaps the very day when
  he must come home, after making all allowance for wind, and weather."</p>

  <p>This brought a very nice smile into the eyes of the house-keeping lady,
  who was not so very old; and if Mr. Gaston could have seen, how warmly, and
  gratefully, she wished her new friends good-night, perhaps it would have made
  him grind his teeth, and hesitate about his next proceeding.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; UNDER THE ASH-TREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The evening of a ripe summer day was slanting down the
  western heights, and spreading waves of peace and rest (too soft to be called
  shadows yet), along the fertile lowland, and the villages, where people talk.
  The striped proceedings of the harvest, and the winding tree-girt roads, and
  meadows coned with hay, uncarted still (because of summer-floods), patches
  also, streaked according to the coat they had put on (whether of beans, or
  rape, or turnips, or the hungry and hungrifying potato, or brown vetches
  spent in pods), and the green leisure of soft pasture, frilled with alders by
  the brook&mdash;these, and a thousand other beauties, spreading wide content
  to gaze at, lay in the mellow summer eve, below the rampart of rough
  moor.</p>

  <p>Returning from Christowell, in time to get her father's supper ready,
  Rose, with one hand full of wood-bine, blue-cup, and dark beads of worts,
  espied a lovely place to rest in, and enjoy the varied view. A bend of the
  wandering lane lay open, where a gate had once kept guard; for time had
  dispersed the gate; and man, and his cattle, had dispensed with it. Over the
  moss-browed granite posts, (whose heads were antlered, like a stag's,) a
  grand old ash-tree, hung with tassels, spread a cool awning, to improve the
  sight. Ferns, and foxgloves, and puce heath-flowers, fringed the descent of
  the steep fore-ground; while the lowland distance wavered with the slowly
  gliding shades of hill.</p>

  <p>Here she sat, to think a little of the beauties earth presents, and
  perhaps (although she was so young) of the many troubles it inflicts. She was
  capable&mdash;as she thought&mdash;of putting two and two together; but this
  capability had not brought the comfort of so rare a gift. Nothing came of
  meditations; and perhaps the wisest plan would be, to stop them altogether.
  But this was easier said, than done; none but the most commanding minds can
  turn their pressure off and on; and Rose was not given to pry continually
  into her own machinery.</p>

  <p>The sweetness of the hovering light, and calm of summer fragrance, were
  enough to make one think of nice things here, and scorn anxiety. Far in the
  distance people clearly were at work, but made no noise; and nearer toward,
  at the hill-foot, cows (as quiet as the milky way) jotted the winding
  meadows, with slow movement, seeking the prime of dew. There was nothing to
  disturb one's mind, under the dignity of that tree; unless the disturbed one
  brought it with him, or let himself be vexed (through excess of sensibility),
  by the lightly mended fractures, which the Christow made a murmur of. In
  defiance of breakage, the brook flowed on; in erasure of shadows, the evening
  spread; and over the lines of care and trouble, the young heart passed into
  the like repose.</p>

  <p>There could not have been a better time, for any one to look at her, with
  her head reclined against the granite pier, and her hat full of flowers by
  her side. The rugged face of the stone set off the delicate damask of her
  own, and the hoary lichens, of a hundred years, made a foil for the
  brightness of silky young locks. It was doubtful, whether she was
  half-asleep, or wholly thinking; but in either case, a gentle smile was
  sweetly resting with her. And not to disturb its beauty, or his own delight
  in watching it, a young man (who had come softly up the turfy slope) drew
  back, and pondered.</p>

  <p>By some strange gift of time, and place, this happened to be John
  Westcombe, who had long been in a condition of mind, more easy to feel, than
  to describe. It had neither been distraction, anguish, transport, misery,
  temerity, abasement, nor any of the many dark profundities of despair.
  Rather, there had been, from time to time, some element of all those moods,
  combining undesirably, and confounding self-inspection. And now to see the
  cause of all this stir, intensified it. For since that day at Fingle-bridge,
  he had only seen her far away, although he had diligently fished the river,
  to the utmost of his privilege. "This is a fair chance now," thought he, "on
  neutral ground&mdash;the Queen's highway, or at any rate, a parish road. Am I
  to go on like this, for ever, until some dishonourable fellow cuts me out?
  How sweetly lovely she does look! There never was any one like her."</p>

  <p>For her simple dress, long-waisted, flowing (and neither skewered in, nor
  scrimped to show a foot squeezed into a lobster's claw, nor thatched with
  stripes of hideous hues) followed the elegance of her form; as nature's self
  would have provided, if the human race were born in husks, as a comely
  filbert is. The finish of every part was perfect, like a sculptor's dream
  (but happily quite unlike his deeds), from the tapering fingertips, and
  nails, resembling the aforesaid filbert, to the carven curves, and flexured
  tracery of soft little ears, that had never been bored. To these Jack
  Westcombe thought it now good time to make his love's appeal.</p>

  <p>"You did not know that I was here. I came up, quite by accident. And I
  hope you won't be angry with me, for&mdash;for looking at you?"</p>

  <p>"After all your kindness, how could I be angry with you, for&mdash;for
  looking at me?"</p>

  <p>"But I want to do a good deal more than that. I want to tell you, if I
  may, the continual things I think of you. You cannot understand them; but I
  should like to make them clear to you."</p>

  <p>"But how can you do that, if they are beyond my understanding?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Jack; "if you will only try to put yourself in my
  place. Suppose that you loved anybody, with all your heart, and for all your
  life. The first thing you would want to do, would be to make it clear to
  them."</p>

  <p>"But they would be sure to know it. Why should I tell them, what they knew
  already? They would feel, that I was doing it."</p>

  <p>"Then do you feel, that I am doing it, doing it ever more, for you? And if
  you do, are you vexed about it?"</p>

  <p>Rose had risen, and was looking at him, with maiden bashfulness, and some
  grief. "You are not thinking what you say;" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am. I have thought about it, for days, and nights, and weeks, and
  months. Ever since I first saw you, nothing else has been (really in my
  thoughts. I cannot expect you to care for me yet; but only say, that you will
  try. Put it in this way to yourself. Say, 'here is a fellow not worth much,
  and in no single way to be compared to me. But he loves me, with all his
  heart and soul; and lovely as I am, I never shall get any body else, to do it
  half so well.'"</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Westcombe, if I am to talk to myself like that, I must be a
  mass of self-conceit."</p>

  <p>"So you ought to be. And then, go on like this&mdash;'although I don't
  care about him now, and he does not come up at all to my ideas, it is my duty
  to give him fair play, and not for a moment to entertain a single thought of
  any other person; until I have tried my very best to like him.' Now, will you
  promise to consider it like that?"</p>

  <p>"Surely your ideas of fair play," she answered, with a smile of pleasure
  at his skill in putting things, so as not to terrify her, "are fairer to
  yourself, supposing that&mdash;that you make a point of me, than they are to
  any other person; such as I am not to think of."</p>

  <p>"How can I argue with you," said Jack, contriving to get very near to her,
  without any perceptible nearing, "unless you could spare me your hand, that I
  might count my reasons on it?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, that I ought to go home;" said Rose.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for being afraid;" he answered, with much ability offering his
  hand, in the manner of one who says, 'Good-bye;' "because it seems almost to
  mean, that you are not afraid to be with me. It seems almost, as if you were
  beginning at last to understand, just a little, how I worship you."</p>

  <p>"Hush! You must not use such words. It is quite sinful. You may say 'love'
  me. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you give me leave to say 'love you,' I shall care for nothing
  more. Come, you can never call that back."</p>

  <p>"But I have given you no leave at all! You are taking the whole of it,
  yourself," said Rose, as he began to count her fingers, in one of the many
  bedazements of love, as mothers count the baby's toes&mdash;"Good-night, and
  good-bye, was the leave you were to take. And if you won't do it, I must do
  it for you."</p>

  <p>"I am off, at once. Or at least I shall be off, before you can count ten.
  Only before I go, be so very kind, as to do me one little favour. You know
  that I am not unreasonable?"</p>

  <p>"I have always thought that of you, until&mdash;till now."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, for you to think it still. I ask you nothing more than
  this&mdash;to give me both your hands, and say&mdash;'John Westcombe, I will
  think kindly of you.'"</p>

  <p>"Why those are the very words Sam Slowbury says, that his wife used to
  him; and whenever they quarrel, he reminds her of them."</p>

  <p>"I shall be quite content to be reminded of them, fifty thousand times, if
  the result is the same in our case." This was confusion of thought on Jack's
  part. But what better could be expected? For Rose, with her gentle graceful
  manner, gave him both her hands, and said&mdash;"Mr. Westcombe, I will think
  kindly of you."</p>

  <p>The bloom of a bright blush deepened on her cheeks, as her eyes met his
  courageously; and then she turned her face away, lest any tell-tale tears
  should own, that her promise had been fulfilled already.</p>

  <p>"I will ask no more," John Westcombe said, longing to see her face again,
  but like a man, forbearing; "you have given me all that I can expect. There
  are many obstacles between us. But as sure as I love you, they shall vanish.
  Now darling, give me one sweet flower, from where the sweeter head has
  been."</p>

  <p>A tear fell into her nosegay, as she stooped to choose a pretty one; and
  without a word, she gave him a truss of woodbine, seven sweet rosy bells.</p>

  <p>Then she took up her hat; and trembling fingers played among the other
  flowers; because he might think her sadly stingy, for only giving him that
  one.</p>

  <p>But it was the one, on which the tear had fallen, as Jack's sharp eyes had
  perceived with joy.</p>

  <p>"This flower shall be with me all my life," he said, as he held it
  reverently; "now Rose, my Rose, I must see you home; because there are great
  rogues about. You shall go in front, and I will watch you; as I mean to do
  all my life."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; AMONG THE CORN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When big rogues are about, which happens seven days in the
  week at least, honest men, and women, feel the deepest interest in them. Not
  from fear alone; oh no, even the women are not afraid; but partly from pure
  joy at having one's neighbour robbed, and not oneself; and partly from
  jealousy of beholding enterprise beyond one's own. Any play, that has a fine
  thief in it, makes us heartily thump the floor; and the tale of his life
  holds us suspended, until the dear hero is <i>sus. per coll.</i></p>

  <p>Any such romantic doings of the night are doubly refreshing to the human
  system, in the glare of day, and the social glow, and the radiant
  encouragement of a large beer-can. And when the men have worked hard, and
  earned their talk, and have women among them, at once to enliven, and
  chasten, the tenour of their discourse, the truth of their tales receives a
  flash of fancy, at which they will shudder, when they go home, in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Farmer Willum" (as Mr. William Bird was called, to distinguish him from
  his brother John) was renting, besides his Moorland farm, on which he would
  never think of trying to grow wheat, a snug little piece, of about thirty
  acres, down in the lowlands below Christowell. Here there was rich alluvial
  soil, stolen by the river from its earlier stage, and spread out well above
  the reach of floods, for man to stick his staff of life in. And Farmer Willum
  had stuck it in well, with stable support, and the increment of cows; ere
  ever the farmers began to be cheated, with stuff they now test in their
  tobacco pipes. But not to say a word, that might afford ground of action to
  any artificial company, it would be a libel to deny, that Farmer Willum had
  got a very prime piece of wheat just here. He was as proud as Punch, about
  it, although he only said&mdash;"Middling, well middling. I have seen worse,
  and I have seen better. In these bad times, us must be thankful, for aught
  that it pleases the Lord to send. But a' never would have been like that,
  without sixty load of muck, as I drawed in."</p>

  <p>Now the day was come for reaping this, after Farmer Willum had been in and
  felt it, and found the kern gone out of milk, and looked fifty times at his
  weather-glass, and tapped it with his knuckles, every time, to detect any
  wavering of its hand, and listened for it to tick&mdash;for he never could
  understand how it could go without ticking; and after a long council with his
  wife, who despised a clock that never told the time of day, down he went to
  the <i>Three Horse-shoes,</i> on a Saturday night, when all the useful men
  were there; and he said through a beard, that would be reaped to-morrow,</p>

  <p>"Drat the weather; I can't make head or tail of 'un. And John Sage never
  cometh here now. But rain, hail, or shine, I've a made up my mind, to cut
  they three Ox-lands, Monday morning. Any of you lads, as has worked for me
  afore, come into the traveller's room, and speak your minds concerning
  it."</p>

  <p>And now, here they were, and had been hard at it, up to eleven o'clock of
  day, according to the stroke from the high church-tower, which came down the
  valley, and rejoiced their hearts.</p>

  <p>Then they flung down their sickles, and they left their binds; and the
  children, who had long been endangering their spotty fat legs, among the
  flash of steel, raced down to the ditch, for their father's knotted
  kerchiefs, or hats, according as the case might be, and brought them with a
  dutiful sniff at the contents, to the spot where the cider-barrel stood upon
  its wheels.</p>

  <p>The sun was very strong, and it was time to call a halt. Brawny men wiped
  their reeking brows, and untied the fillet, that kept their shaggy hair back;
  and some, with stiff legs bowed by straddling, went down to the brook, to
  cool arms and faces. The rest made straightway for the cider-barrel, where
  Mrs. Willum sat upon a milking stool, to temper liberality with justice. And
  this was a thing requiring care, and quick memory, as well as strength of
  mind; so many were the tricks of crafty men, coming with a hat on, coming
  with it off, coming with their neighbour's hat, meanly sending their
  neighbour's wife, when their own had had it; and worst of all, turning their
  coat, like liberals, for the sake of another pint out of the spigot. But the
  farmer's wife was tolerably sharp; and the sharpest of them cheated her no
  more than twice; and that was the stupid Sam Slowbury.</p>

  <p>For this was a man of such deliberation, and so many children, that a very
  distant gaze was needed, to take a sinister view of him. His countenance
  alone, and his style of thinking&mdash;which could be seen in his forehead
  when he did it&mdash;and the gentle kindling of his eyes, when he began to
  begin to understand a thing; and above all, the slow and steadfast wrinkles
  of his smile, which came like a summer ground-swell, as soon as it was
  impossible for him not to understand&mdash;these, and many other gifts, to be
  envied rather than imitated, proved, beyond doubt, that if nature can be
  trusted, Sam was the last man she intended for a rogue.</p>

  <p>It is not within the present limit, to enter into, far less to
  settle&mdash;as every one does to his own content&mdash;points of extreme,
  and extremely vague delicacy. But for the sake of human nature (which in
  spite of its own convictions, does not always know exactly what it is about)
  it is only fair to say, that if Sam Slowbury was a rogue at all, he was so,
  without privity of his own conscience, and purely for the sake of his
  family.</p>

  <p>"Missus," he said, when he had done some of his dinner, but kept some more
  to be done yet, and a horn of cider to go after it; "if 'e can foind to spare
  a minute, come, and zit upon this here stook, out o' the zin; and tell up a
  bit."</p>

  <p>Betty Sage&mdash;for Sam was speaking, with this freedom of address, to no
  less a person&mdash;looked at Sam, as much to say, "Young man, you are making
  too bold, with your betters." But it came to her mind, that the harvest-field
  might level, for the moment, even the distinction, between the head-gardener
  of a colonel, and a mere captain's understrapper: therefore she smiled, as
  Sam showed his horn of cider, and letting down her linsy-woolsy, followed to
  hear what this labourer might have to tell her.</p>

  <p>Slowbury's wits were at their best, because he had been working hard,
  being compelled to keep pace with the rest, unless he were prepared to taste
  reaping-hook; and the movement of his body had worked his mind up. Moreover,
  he was conscious of some cash in pocket; and his consciousness was brisker to
  rejoice therein, than his conscience to grieve over it. And who shall blame
  the parent of so many small bread-baskets?</p>

  <p>"Why, Sam! I never knowed 'e looked so peart," Mrs. Sage began, almost
  before they had settled their quarters, upon the two stooks, in a corner the
  sun had done with; "whativer hath come to 'e now, Sam Slowbury? Too much
  zider, I reckon&mdash;hand me over. I han't had a drop, to count on."</p>

  <p>But this solution of his "psychical phenomena," by a disinterested
  observer, was not satisfactory to Sam. "Naw, naw," said he; "pl'aize to baide
  a bit. The time of the women-volk beginneth, when the time of the men be
  zatisfied."</p>

  <p>To illustrate this, he sloped his horn, displaying a throat, well adapted
  for its duties, and intent upon them now, according to the evidence of a
  sliding lump in front. This was observed by Betty Sage, with a large and
  liberal contempt.</p>

  <p>"Did 'e drame, thou zany, as I wanted thy zider?" she asked, as Sam laid
  down the empty horn.</p>

  <p>"Your maister be getting on bravely, they tell, over yonner to Ockington,"
  said Slowbury, with his tones refreshed; "I have a'-heered zay, putting wan
  thing with anither, and allowing of what a' bringeth home on Zinday,
  faive-and-twenty zhillin' a week, be not a brass farden below the vally!"</p>

  <p>"What heed of thaine, Sam Slowbury?" inquired Mrs. Sage, leaning forward
  on her stook, and with sternly set wrinkles, regarding him; "'tis the brains
  as doeth it; and if the Lord, in His wisdom, hath not gifted thee with a
  haverage, He hath made it thy dooty not to grumble."</p>

  <p>"And I be not a'-grumbling," answered Sam, humbly fingering his big head;
  "I be quite zatisfied, with my haverage; though a' don't vetch their vally,
  out of harvest time. But I coom here, to do 'e a good turn, Mother Sage; and
  all I gets for it, is to foind 'e a-zitting in the zeats of the
  scornful."</p>

  <p>"Not the worst of my henemies can say that of me," Betty Sage answered,
  with politeness, as Sam began to fill his pipe, with a nod of superior
  indifference; "if thou hast aught to say, Sam, say it. Thy moother was a
  sensible woman, before thee; and many's the good turn, I've a'doed her. And
  her always said 'my son, Sam, will repay thee?' Can 'e call to mind the
  red-brick taybeggin?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and the lather there was, when I brak 'un; because her were a
  marriage-present. So be, Missus, I'll be toord, and tell 'e. Don't 'e let
  your maister ever goo to Weist-Tor, of a Friday night. He be getting on in
  years; but the life of him wur gived to him, for so long as he can count
  it."</p>

  <p>"And why, if you plaize, Sam Slowbury, is John Sage to be denied of going
  to Weist-Tor, of a Friday night? Hath a' doed any sin, for Old Nick to grab
  'un?"</p>

  <p>"No more nor the main of us, to my knowledge, Missus. And old John be
  pretty wull a match for Old Nick, with his General sin, to help 'un. But
  though a' was a fust-fly wrastler, on a time, and could show a good fall yet,
  wi' sich a chap as I be; what could a' do, Missus, what could a' do, wi' a
  score of big men a' top of 'un?"</p>

  <p>"A' maight crape out. A' can turn winderful," the old lady answered, with
  a smile at thinking of some of her husband's stories; "but who be they, that
  he be bound to ware of?"</p>

  <p>"I've a' told 'e enough," Master Slowbury answered, shaking all the
  sheaves of the stook, as he got up. "Rippers be to wark agin; time for me to
  vall in, or vorvet dreppence."</p>

  <p>"Reckon, thou wilt spake agin bumbai. Us shall have to wait upon 'e,
  zupper-time."</p>

  <p>"Missus, it goo'th agin my conscience; and nort but old times wud a' made
  me zay the words as I have zed. Dont 'e tell no one. For good now, don't
  'e."</p>

  <p>"I'll pay the dreppence, Sam, for half-an-hour of thee. For good now, stop
  a bit, and unfold thy maning."</p>

  <p>"If I wor to spake anither word," said Slowbury, buckling up his breeches'
  strap, to go to work again; "twud be worse than the procading of thic
  beastie, by the gate."</p>

  <p>Farmer Willum's donkey had come down the hill, with a basket of
  refreshment for Mistress Willum, and the maids of the farm, who were hungry;
  and perceiving no sign of the like for himself, was unburdening his
  grievances in a loud hee-haw. "You get along, I don't attach no importance to
  'e," Mrs. Sage exclaimed, as Sam strode away, with his rip-hoop swinging;
  "thy moother were a fule, before thee; and I doubt, whether thou be bigger
  fule, or rogue, Sam Slowbury."</p>

  <p>Although her mind was eased by this discharge, in a minute or two, it
  became again uneasy, as she saw Sam swaying in the reaper's rank. He was the
  biggest man there, save one, and he seemed to make the cleanest sweep of all;
  and he laughed, beyond the power of the rest, at jokes, without taking any
  pains to make his own; the which is the wisest of all human wit.</p>

  <p>Betty Sage watched him, and went reasoning with herself, that he must have
  something in him, to behave like that. And when the reapers halted, in the
  bottom by the hedge, and one of them sought counsel of Sam, and he scolded a
  fellow of some cleverness, for setting the stooks up badly, Mrs. Sage was
  glad indeed, to see Betty Cork come up the rigs.</p>

  <p>"I hope I see you well, ma'am. How hot the sun be! But her maketh no
  difference to your complexion. Ah, Mrs. Cork, with my John away so, I can
  hardly pronoonce the words inside me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cork, who was the mother of Solomon (now earning his keep and £5 a
  year, under my lady at Touchwood Park), and herself kept the chief shop in
  Christowell, was not come to work, of course, but to look at the work, and
  deliver her opinion, and jot down the names of the men who were earning
  corn-wages, and must be looked up next Saturday night, to pay their debts,
  ere ever they spent them. But though Mrs. Cork had an eye to business, as
  every one must have to live thereby, she was not above enjoyment of herself
  sometimes, and of pleasurable doings around her.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mrs. Sage paid ready money, though she might have had credit up
  to thirty shillings, if she booked her orders; and Mrs. Cork, being of
  liberal mind, refused to be irritated by the lies, that came to her shop,
  about old John spending all the loose of his money at Ockington. Her faith in
  him was, that he kept it all tight, and could not even bear to run a bill up;
  because of the pain accumulating, at the time of settlement. These
  meditations made Mrs. Cork, although with her holiday gown on, speak quite as
  if Betty Sage were her equal.</p>

  <p>"And I hope, I see you well, ma'am, also," she replied, with an elegant
  nod of her bonnet; "if you are as good as your looks, Mrs. Sage, we never
  need tremble about 'e. Tis the sperrit as keepeth our heads up, ma'am; and I
  wish I wur like 'e; sometimes that I do. 'Tis a down-hearted thing to
  contend, as I do, without ever a husband, to go on at. He hath been in
  churchyard, seven year now; and though he took his pleasure ill-convenient
  sometimes; when it cometh to the slating work, I do miss 'un sadly. What a
  gift a' had of the rathmetick!"</p>

  <p>A person scant of reverence for his betters (when gone beyond
  expostulation) might have been low enough almost to say, that the late Mr.
  Cork's arithmetical gifts were mainly exerted, in doubling the objects within
  his field of vision. But Mrs. Sage knew what mankind is, and never blamed any
  man, seven years too late.</p>

  <p>"His gifts of discoorse led 'un into faine society," she replied, as she
  made a soft place for Mrs. Cork; "I've a' often feared the same of my good
  man; but John sticketh fast by his airnings. I have heered say, ma'am, that
  your Master Cork could hold his own, with the best of they, as writes this
  papper!"</p>

  <p>"He were the front of them, the foremost on the rank;" Mr. Cork's widow
  made answer, as she struck a celebrated journal with her knuckles; "I've a
  zeed him, many times, correct they printers, though a' never zeed a printer's
  press himzell! Winderful to my mind, however a' could contraive it! I takes
  in the papper still, for the sake of my Harry; but a' never zim'th to be
  worth rading now. Half the long words is gone, since they lost his vaine
  larnin'! Here's a bit of stuff! To think what Harry would a' made of it!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cork, although she talked like this, was proud enough, as everybody
  knew inside the shop, of taking, and managing to make out mainly, an
  admirable journal of the West of England; which combined all the dash of the
  brightest London style, with a sharpness of wit, which is not to be got,
  where nobody knows his next-door neighbour.</p>

  <p>And now she had brought this paper, not only to jot down upon it the names
  of her debtors, but also to astound any wide-eared friend, with an article in
  it, concerning Christowell. "You put on your specks, ma'am, and read that,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>This was not a nice thing, for her to say; but rather in the sarcastic
  vein of the paper she indulged in. For she knew, that no specks of the very
  highest power would enable Mrs. Sage to make out a single word. "Deary me!
  I've a been and left my specks at home," said the old lady, after a sham
  search among her pockets; "but you do read so bootiful, ma'am; would you
  plaize put your tongue to it, for me?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cork smiled, because she loved her education; and then, without even
  putting any glasses on, which made the feat more wonderful, to any one who
  heard her&mdash;which half a dozen women, and a man, began to do&mdash;she
  read, with such disdain of all difficulties, that she skipped them, the
  following remarkable paragraphs:</p>

  <p>"When a matter is beyond our explanation, we have always considered it the
  most judicious plan, to abide in our patience, until the inexplicable
  gradually brings about its own solution. With a certain exalted prelate,
  exalted above the highest scope of human reason, we have felt ourselves
  driven to adopt this system, because he was amenable to no other."</p>

  <p>"Why they've got three column agin' the poor bishop, in this very papper!"
  Mrs. Cork stopped to say, with a breath of surprise, which proved that she
  did not understand the sweet manners of journalists; "but perhaps the man who
  wrote this, forgot all about it.</p>

  <p>"But though"&mdash;continued this eloquent writer, "we have lapsed into
  the silence of despair, concerning a 'churchman,' as he loves to style
  himself, who is all church, and no man; we did indulge a hope, that in our
  peaceful county, there was nobody else we need shudder to mention. Far, very
  far, be it from us to institute a parallel, however well suggested, between
  his lordship of Exeter, and a poor man who has not had his advantages, any
  more than his sinecure to batten on.</p>

  <p>"This poor man appears to be comparatively honest, and to have some very
  charitable feelings, such as we would gladly find elsewhere. When driven by
  straitened circumstances to commit a robbery, he does it like a man, and with
  a tenderness for women, which might afford a lesson to our admirable
  b&mdash;&mdash;p. And, unless we are misinformed, a certain amount of good
  feeling characterizes this felon, which has not yet been found, though with
  many tears sought for, in the precincts of our venerable pile.</p>

  <p>"But not to over press this extraordinary analogy&mdash;for we hear that
  his lordship did weep last week, when he lost a fine appointment for a member
  of his family&mdash;our duty is simply to point out, that measures are about
  to be applied to this minor Dartmoor evil, which a vigorous Government should
  rather have exerted upon the more <i>crying evil</i> we have feebly
  indicated. We are informed, upon the very best authority, that as those noble
  dunderheads, our great J.P.'s, only wring their fat hands, when they can
  spare them from their knives, and forks, and bottles of old port, at the
  lawless proceedings of the <i>unmitred</i> felon, a very famous general, with
  a name suggestive of tinder, has been ordered to encamp over against him. We
  have one great warrior already, in the West, qualified for the commission of
  the peace, by wholesale slaughter of French patriots; but the remnant of his
  energies has been absorbed, in the production of grouse, and some other
  French game.</p>

  <p>"We can assure our readers, that we shall observe, with deepest interest,
  the result of this twofold experiment, this attempt to kill two birds with
  one stone; premising only two things&mdash;that if the poor outlaw could have
  limited his appetite to farmer's produce, instead of devouring the sumptuous
  dinner of a Sybarite high-church rector, he might have enjoyed the fine
  mountain air, for many years, unmolested. Also that, in our very humble
  opinion, that British commander, of the fire-eating name, might have received
  more appropriate instructions&mdash;to bombard the P&mdash;&mdash;ce of our
  fire-eating b&mdash;&mdash;p. We trust, that when he has caught the inferior
  felon, he may gird up his loins, to the larger, more glorious, and infinitely
  more needful task."</p>

  <p>All the good people, who heard this read (as it was read by Betty Cork,
  with many sagacious nods at the words that went beyond three syllables),
  said, "thank you, ma'am; you have dooed it winderful; and winderful faine
  thic writing be!"</p>

  <p>So fine indeed was it&mdash;though rather below, than above, this paper's
  standard&mdash;that none of the listeners could make out any more, than that
  the writer was a clever man as need be, but unfit to have any faith laid in
  him, without his right name to the foot of it. The rule, to their minds, was
  that any honest man could get on, with speaking simple. If he wanted to be
  clever, let him speak it with his voice; there was no such thing, as to laugh
  by ink and paper; you might as well try to get salvation, from a sermon you
  clapped eyes upon the parson with his pen at.</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Sage was of keener intelligence; as the wife of the seer of the
  parish should be. She took in a great deal of the meaning of the paper; and
  added thereto a great quantity of her own. By this double process, her mind
  became most active, combining conception, and generation.</p>

  <p>"Never you tell me," she screamed to Mrs. Cork (who was off, amid a
  rounder of "Thank 'e, ma'am; thank 'e; plaize to come again, and tell us
  more;"), "never you tell me that the holy gentleman, with window-blind
  sleeves, who hath laid his hand dree times upon my head, and bettered me
  continual, be put alongside of a shape-staling villain, by the biggest thief,
  as ever wrat upside down. I'd scratt 'un, if I coom acrass 'un, that I wud,
  and gie 'un the tail of 's own talk."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; GENERAL PUNK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Young Squire Touchwood had borne, as well as could
  reasonably be expected, the blight, or even worse than that, the blasting of
  his ardent hopes.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Arthur, in the kindest manner, set before him the state of the
  case, and denied him all hope of his daughter, Dicky replied, with some
  dignity, that he was old enough to understand his own business, and could not
  allow even Captain Arthur to lay down the law for him, about his own good.
  With orders to clear out, he must do so, although he must say that it was
  very hard upon him; particularly when he would be having to bunk, in about
  six weeks, to Cambridge. For he must keep next October term, and glad he
  would be to do it; for he found the people of this neighbourhood, inclined to
  sit upon him; and he had left three dogs, at a shilling a week for grub, in
  the mews near Sidney Sussex. Upon the whole, he thought, that dogs were
  better, to be kind to a fellow, than human people. However, he would stick up
  to Miss Arthur still; because he had never seen anybody like her, until he
  was kicked off the premises.</p>

  <p>Captain Larks could not help smiling, at the natural mixture of his ideas,
  and the downfall of his sportive face, and the classical cast of woe, by Lady
  Touchwood compared to the 'muteness of a Niloby.'</p>

  <p>"Don't be too hard, sir," he said; "I shall have to bunk, in next to
  no-time; and if I could go away without being sacked, it would keep me to the
  scratch, and set me fine. I know, that Miss Arthur is a million cuts above
  me. But still, I might think; and it keeps me thinking. Old Jakes, or at
  least I mean our Senior Tutor, says that nothing has ever been proved against
  me, except some want of thought, and a leaning towards trivial amusements.
  But this is so long-winded, and so bursting, that I am sure he would approve
  of it."</p>

  <p>"You put these matters in a light quite new to me, but perhaps a very
  excellent one," said Mr. Arthur; "of our great universities I know nothing.
  If it will help you, in your <i>curriculum,</i> as I believe you term it, to
  call upon me, when you come home for the holidays&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But we never come home for the holidays, sir. We go down for
  vacation."</p>

  <p>"Well, when you are vacant, or whatever it may be, we shall be very glad
  to see you again. Your mind is a very candid one; and open to good
  impressions."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, sir, whatever you may think, that nothing can ever be a patch
  upon the impression, I am suffering from. But as facts are against me, I must
  go. No gentleman could do otherwise. Only I would like to have two things
  settled. First, that a dreadfully stuck-up young fellow, of the name of
  Westcombe, shall not be allowed to take advantage of my absence, and jockey
  me (as we say at Cambridge), by dodges, such as we cannot stoop to; and again
  that I may be allowed to come, and say 'good-bye,' before I go back to old
  Alma."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if I am at home, we shall be very glad to say 'goodbye;'
  though there must be nearly two months yet to run. But as to Mr. Westcombe,"
  said the captain smiling, "I cannot undertake to warn him off the premises,
  any more than has been done already. He is a good young man; and you should
  do him justice, like another man."</p>

  <p>"Well, he may be good enough;" Squire Dicky confessed, in his fine candid
  manner; "but for all that, I call him exceedingly nasty. I like a man to be
  honest, and upright, and come to the front-door, as I always do; instead of
  going fishing round the corner. Now, sir, please to make a mem. of what I
  say. I have seen a good deal of the world, in my time; and I never knew any
  good come, of those fellows, who stick up to be everything wonderful. If
  anything happens to your house, worse than our reverend friend had to put up
  with, you will find, that the blame lies upon that young Westcombe. He rushes
  all over the moor, like a moorman; and he must fall into bad company. And you
  know, as well as I do, what comes of that."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Touchwood," Captain Larks could not help saying; "surely it is
  not Mr. Westcombe; but somebody else, who in a youthful manner, seeks the
  society of sporting men. You called him a 'stuck-up young fellow,' just now;
  though he must be four or five years, your senior. And if that means
  anything, it seems to mean, that he would hold himself above&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Begging your pardon, sir, for interrupting you, it seems to mean that, to
  a certain extent. But I have had more experience, than you might suppose, to
  look at me. And I know what men of that character always prove to be, at
  Cambridge. Till you come to know them, you would fancy that butter would not
  melt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I may interrupt you, in my turn, I would say, that such things might
  be spoken more fairly, in the presence of the person they concern. Or at
  least, that some instance should be given."</p>

  <p>"That is the very thing; they take good care, that there never shall be
  any instance to give. I have nothing particular to say against him. I give
  you my general conclusions, founded upon his behaviour to me; which has not
  been that of a gentleman. I thought that he was after my sister Julia; which
  would have been a very proper thing. And poor Judy thought so too, as I may
  tell you; of course, in the strictest confidence. I offered him a shake-down
  at our place, and the run of my best Imperials. But he preferred to have a
  crib, at Parson Short's."</p>

  <p>"We had better quit the subject. He behaved quite rightly, in declining
  your hospitality, under the circumstances. When you are older you will look
  at things more fairly. Take the word of a man, who has seen something of the
  world; which you fondly imagine you have done. Hold your own course
  resolutely, when it is a worthy one; say nothing, against those who cross it,
  unless you say it in their presence; and make more allowance for their view
  of the question, than you expect them to make for yours."</p>

  <p>"I have a great deal to thank you for," replied Dicky, who was not
  ungrateful; "but I'm blest, if I can make much allowance for that fellow. You
  bear in mind my warning about him. I always stick fast to what I have said.
  Right, or wrong, I stick to it; though many people call me a duffer.
  Good-bye, sir; you may trust me to come again, before I go up."</p>

  <p>It was all the more unfair, on the part of Squire Dicky, to go on in that
  style about Jack Westcombe, because he knew not a syllable as yet, of what
  Jack had been saying in the gateway. The knowledge of that might have hurt
  his feelings, beyond all reserve of judgment; as a man who tumbles into a
  liquid manure-tub, when delivering a lecture on astronomy, must be pardoned
  for loss of philosophy. But the young squire, humble though he was in many
  ways, could not help thinking, from his knowledge of the fair sex, that he
  ought to get on with them, at least as well as Westcombe did. Jack had not
  half as much to say, as Dicky, neither did he understand the style of
  dresses, or the turn of thought shaped to some half-a-dozen types, which the
  young lady chooses, and changes, very properly. Dicky's knowledge of these
  subjects made him always most agreeable, if he only got a fair chance of
  displaying it; while it enabled him to be, when baited, nicely disagreeable
  to all of them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mr. John Westcombe now was full of magnanimous ideas.
  He felt an extremely contemptuous charity&mdash;which could not in such a
  case be rendered into "love,"&mdash;towards the versatile, and lighthearted
  Dicky. No provocation would have made him punch the head of his rival, in the
  present fine state of things. He bore with him well; as the man who has got
  into the right box, sympathises with the outsider&mdash;a sitting down
  sympathy, which abides in its breaches. Not that John Westcombe was at all
  cocksure of winning his beloved Rose, for a long time to come; only that it
  became a joy to him to find, that the other fellow's innings were cut short.
  And reason as we may upon such a state of things, they turn out to be both
  above, and below, reason.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you something, father," said the youth to the colonel,
  at a genial time, when a quiet, and solid repast had been dealt with; or in
  plainer English, after a good dinner; "we shall have visitors to-morrow; and
  I dare say, as long as there is anything to shoot, General Punk will stick
  here."</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, your tone is inhospitable;" the father replied, with mild
  reproof. "My old friend is coming, to enjoy himself, and also to afford us
  pleasure. He has been a highly distinguished soldier, and must not be made
  light of, because no longer wanted. Under Providence, he has contributed
  greatly to the discomfiture of our foes. He deserves our best welcome; and he
  shall have it."</p>

  <p>"You may trust me, sir, to be at his service wholly; even if he shoots me,
  as he partly did, last time. All I mean is, that I shall have little chance
  of a quiet talk with you, when he begins bombarding."</p>

  <p>"He discharges his battery, before he has unlimbered;" Colonel Westcombe
  answered, with some grave thought; "but it is delightful to see how he
  smiles, when he seems to have brought down something. His eyes are not
  capable of fine discrimination, after all the powder smoke they have been
  through. I shall observe him very carefully, my boy; and if I find him worse,
  than he was last time, we can simply load him with blank-cartridge. You are a
  good shot. Fire, when he does; and bring him whatever you knock over."</p>

  <p>"It is the only safe plan, I believe;" Jack Westcombe replied, as he
  rubbed his left leg, where he still had a pellet of the general's
  bombardment. "And if we put in five drachms of powder, he would never find it
  out, through want of kick. However, let him have some shot, the first day,
  and see how he goes on with it. There is one great comfort, that as he cannot
  walk, he nearly always fires over other people's heads. But the great danger
  is, when a hare gets up. Keep behind him, father, I entreat you. Let him
  shoot <i>Nous,</i> or Mr. Short, or me; if he must hit something."</p>

  <p>"He seems to have a gift of hitting something; though not at all the thing
  he aimed at. But we will hope for the best, my boy. What was it, you were
  going to say to me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I was thinking that you ought to know, that I had the good
  luck to meet Miss Arthur, two or three evenings ago, as I came up from
  fishing in the valley; and I said to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You promised to have nothing to say to that young lady; until I had some
  explanation with her father."</p>

  <p>"I know I did. But upon the understanding, that you should have it
  speedily. Well, that must have been nearly six weeks ago, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose it is. I don't call that much," said the colonel, with his
  broad grey eyebrows moving. "I tell you that is no time; and you have behaved
  badly."</p>

  <p>"I call it a very long time;" answered Jack, looking at his father, with
  the very same glance, which the latter would have given five and thirty years
  ago; "and begging your pardon, I have not behaved badly. But I should have
  behaved very badly indeed, and in my own opinion, sneakingly&mdash;if I had
  passed her like a stranger; simply because you hang fire so long."</p>

  <p>"You express yourself in a most disrespectful manner; and until you beg my
  pardon, for using such language, I shall not regard you as a gentleman."</p>

  <p>The colonel, in this most tremendous, and at the same time almost
  tremulous, state&mdash;for he never had such a quarrel with his son
  before&mdash;doubled up his napkin, and cracked an early filbert (of the
  thin-shelled Cosford kind) with the napkin, instead of the crackers; and
  crunched up the nut without a bit of salt, to prove the tranquillity of his
  mind. And instead of looking any more at his son, he directed his gaze at the
  decanter-stoppers first, and then higher, and higher, until he took in all
  the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Jack Westcombe, though his feelings too were hurt; "I confess
  that I spoke disrespectfully, and deserve to be well thrashed for it. I beg
  your pardon with all my heart; and will promise to do nothing of the kind
  again."</p>

  <p>Then the gaze of the father came back from the ceiling, and fell upon the
  bright eyes of his son; and if the two had been of any race but ours, there
  must have been a little scene between them.</p>

  <p>But equally possessing that most precious birthright, self-control, and
  disdain of outbursts, they were satisfied to know, from each other's look,
  and manner, that the discord between them was put quietly away.</p>

  <p>"Very well; now you may go on," said Colonel Westcombe; "and I will try to
  make every allowance for you, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I went up to Miss Arthur; as any one, but a sneak, must have
  done. And I told her exactly what my views were."</p>

  <p>"That you meant to marry her, I suppose, without anybody's leave, except
  her own, and the parson's?"</p>

  <p>"How could I put it in so coarse a way?" the young man asked, with an
  undercut at his admirable father; "no, sir, what I said was very mild indeed;
  and I am sorry to say, that there was nothing settled."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say, Jack, that you were so afraid of me, that you durst
  not speak out, in a straightforward manner?"</p>

  <p>"No, it was not quite that, so much. Though, of course, you are very hard
  upon me. But I felt, that I could not press a young lady, very young still,
  and without any mother, to engage herself to me, even if she liked me:
  against her father's wishes, and my own father's too."</p>

  <p>"Then, after all, nothing came of your proceedings."</p>

  <p>There was some contempt in Colonel Westcombe's voice, as well as a little
  touch of disappointment, for he had taken a very great liking to Rose, and
  pitied her peculiar position. "You young fellows never know your own minds
  now."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do, with all the other minds against us?" the young fellow
  asked, as if his will were only wax; "in such a state of things, what would
  you have done, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the colonel, "I would have done just this. I would have
  taken the young lady in my arms, very tenderly, but without any warmth, to
  alarm her; and I would have said, 'my dear, they are all against us; but if
  you stick to me, I will stick to you; and the Lord will carry us through with
  it;' and possibly then, I might have kissed her."</p>

  <p>"Sir," answered Jack, with a smile, and a blush&mdash;for his mind was
  very delicate&mdash;"you have taught me the proper thing to do, next time. I
  am very much obliged to you; and if I ever have such luck, I shall add, 'I am
  acting on my dear father's orders.'"</p>

  <p>"You will add nothing of the kind," said the colonel, trying not to smile
  at this bad turn of the case; "I authorize no such extreme proceeding. I have
  not to consider my own wishes only, nor even yours; which are yet dearer to
  me. I have to consider, what is right, and upright. And the matter is full of
  grave difficulties. And the worst of it is, that I cannot tell you, what they
  are. However, I think we can do no great harm, by drinking the health of that
  sweet girl. Fill your glass, my boy; and here is my love to Miss Rosie. I
  will candidly own, that I like her dearly. I would not desire a better wife
  for you; if things can only be brought round."</p>

  <p>"I don't care, whether things are round, or square," cried Jack, after
  standing up (as decency used to require, when a lady's health was given);
  "but if you are with me, sir, (as you have now pledged yourself,) the only
  trouble for me is, to make her love me."</p>

  <p>Having a very vast opinion of his son, Colonel Westcombe would not say a
  word of any sort, upon that particular question; upon which Jack was hoping
  for a good word, to encourage him. His father guessed as much; and looked
  mysteriously at him, with a shake of his head, and a tightening of his lips,
  and a well-meant effort at a formidable frown. Then in fear of having gone
  too far, he said&mdash;"Let us go and see where John Sage is."</p>

  <p>There was nothing, on the turnpike roads of England, to be compared now
  with the <i>Quicksilver</i> mail; which ran, at the full speed of horse,
  whip, and man, right away from Exeter to London; and back again, in the
  duplicate; crossing one another, with scarcely time, for Jehus to lift elbow.
  Although the rail was open now to Bristol, and yet westward, the
  <i>Quicksilver</i> held her own&mdash;from her haste she was a
  female&mdash;and swallowed up the plains, and the hills as well, at the rate
  of fourteen miles an hour, from the General Post-office to the <i>London
  Inn,</i> at Exeter. Then with a modified, but still rapid speed&mdash;far
  greater than that of our suburban trains&mdash;she went on to Plymouth, and
  even to Falmouth; with some loss of vehemence, among the quiet
  Cornishmen.</p>

  <p>General Punk was not the man to travel inside the best coach that ever
  breathed, or panted&mdash;by means of its horses; moreover he liked to save
  his money, whenever he could do so, without self-expense. He rode upon the
  roof; and let nobody know what his importance was; because he must have had
  to give half-a-crown, where a shilling answered nobly. Two coachmen retired
  to the bosoms of their families, one at Salisbury, and one at Exeter, without
  guessing, what a hero, (both of fame, and cash,) had been sitting behind them
  and watching them keenly, and giving them a shilling to be thankful for. If
  they had known, they would have looked each one, at his shilling
  arithmetically; as the time-hallowed manner of the cabman is; who seems to
  say, "there are twelve pence in it; and I scorn you, for every one of
  them."</p>

  <p>But when the <i>Quicksilver</i> began to lose some of its too mercurial
  properties, westward of the faithful city; and a coachman sat upon the box,
  who had almost time enough to speak, without pulling out his watch; General
  Punk came forward well, with some very shrewd remarks about the weather;
  every one of which would have cost him twopence, if offered in the earlier
  stages. They would stand him in that amount, even now; but he knew that he
  must come out handsomely, when he should stop at Colonel Westcombe's gate;
  and having brought up his courage to a full crown-piece (for the coachman,
  and guard, to apportion), he might as well have his talk, out of it.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes after time already;" he said, pulling out a vast gold watch,
  as they trotted between the two Tawtons; "but I suppose you don't care about
  time, down here."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not very much," the coachman answered; "we gets a lot of
  gentlemen, with heaps of luggage, that we ought to have left behind, of
  rights. Where be you going to get down, sir?"</p>

  <p>"At Colonel Westcombe's,&mdash;Westcombe Hall, a little way beyond
  Okehampton. My luggage need not cost you more than thirty seconds, if you
  have arranged it properly."</p>

  <p>"Colonel Westcombe is a very nice gentleman, sir. Likewise a liberal one
  in all his ways. We shall not grudge a minute or two, at his gate."</p>

  <p>"My things must be handled with care," said the general; "and it takes me
  a little time, to get down. These coaches are made so confoundedly narrow. I
  have got the cramp, in both my legs, and a Frenchman's bullet in one of them.
  I must not be hurried, if it takes ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Right, sir; you shall not be hurried," the coachman answered cheerfully.
  "The likes of us must make allowance, for the gentlemen as have fought for
  us."</p>

  <p>"This fellow will expect at least half-a-guinea," thought the general,
  regretting his patriotism, and relapsing into silence, to save gold. For here
  was one of those rich men, who look after their money sharply; having enough
  to make it worth their while. Neither do they value it, one halfpenny the
  less, for the very weak reason, that they soon must say "good-bye;" but
  rather, (with the loyalty of friends, who soon must part,) cling heartily,
  and faithfully, to every token of it.</p>

  <p>This was not the only thing, that made him so respectable. For General
  Punk had a hundred virtues, even more noble than parsimony. He was brave,
  determined, straightforward, contemptuous, candid, loquacious,
  tender-hearted, fiery, and conservative. And people, who began with making
  sad mouths at him (from the salt of his crust), very often went on (when they
  were compelled to do so), deeper into him, with a nicely growing relish. For
  he had in him that making of a liking among men, which all of us are glad to
  feel for, and to meet half-way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; WORLDLY WISDOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The sagacious Jack had brought down a pair of steps, for he
  knew that General Punk was shaky, in his lower members. That distinguished
  officer had never been at Westcombe Hall before, and was now determined to
  have a good time of it. When last he came to shoot something, or somebody, in
  the company of his ancient friend, Colonel Westcombe was a poor man, living
  in a little house near Frome; and only able to procure, from wealthier
  neighbours, a day or two of sport, just to keep his hand in. But the general
  had enjoyed his visit rarely, and abstained from shooting anything, except a
  little piece of Jack. Now when, with the help of that young man, he was
  safely landed at the colonel's gate, and rendered into the owner's arms, the
  general counted all his boxes, blew up his man, because one of them was
  uncorded, and then shook hands with everybody, including John Sage, who had a
  red waistcoat on. "Magnificent," he said, "magnificent! I had no idea there
  were such hills in England."</p>

  <p>In honour of this special guest, Mrs. Westcombe came down that day to
  dinner, which she very seldom did; not from any small reserve; but because
  she could not take food like the rest, and feared to make her visitors
  uncomfortable. And the colonel was in the very best of spirits, and prepared
  to fight his way through anything.</p>

  <p>"We hoped to have had a very lively young lady, and a very handsome one as
  well," he said, "who would put even General Punk upon his mettle&mdash;my
  fair godchild, Julia Touchwood. But she cannot come, until to-morrow. Prepare
  yourself to capitulate, for the first time in your life, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Westcombe, I have brought my two stars with me, as big as those on
  the panels of the <i>Quicksilver;</i> would you recommend me to wear them? Or
  will they only be my death, like my old friend Nelson's?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Westcombe laughed, and they got on well together; for the general had
  always a good word among the ladies. He looked down upon them, and yet up to
  them; which makes them feel pleased with themselves, and their admirers.</p>

  <p>"Jack, you be off now. We want to talk about you," Colonel Westcombe said,
  when the dessert was done with, and the upshot of sunset, on the brown oak
  beams, was quivering like water-weeds. "Take Plover, and Bell, for a run; or
  go, and catch us half-a-dozen trout for breakfast."</p>

  <p>"A very extraordinary young man," the general observed to the colonel; as
  Jack with a bow, but without a word, withdrew. "I never could bear the idea
  of having a son; because they are so envious. But if I could have had a boy,
  of such discipline as yours, I do believe, I could have got on with him."</p>

  <p>"You must not suppose that I have grown Master Jack, as I grow a cabbage,
  or a cucumber. He is the result of a quantity of care, and discipline, and
  good example. But in spite of all that," said the colonel, coming nearer, "he
  falls out of the ranks sometimes. He is a very steady-going young fellow; but
  he has a confoundedly strong will of his own."</p>

  <p>"No soldier is much good, without that, when it comes to close quarters,
  and the bayonet."</p>

  <p>"That is true enough, as we have often proved. But this must be taken in a
  different light. It is a most extraordinary thing altogether; and I cannot
  tell what to make of it. You remember young Pole, of the 'Never mind Whats,'
  as we used to call them; and the mysterious scrape he got into?"</p>

  <p>"I should rather think I did," replied General Punk, shaking off the
  drowsiness of his long journey; "Westcombe, that was one of the things, which
  I never could make head or tail of, and never hope to do so."</p>

  <p>"You would have said, that he was the very last man in the whole British'
  army, to act as he did?"</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the general, with a strong expression; "I would as soon have
  believed it of myself, or you."</p>

  <p>"So would I. So would I," exclaimed Colonel Westcombe; "I had reason to
  love, and admire that young fellow, as I have often told you, for the very
  rarest pluck, and self-possession. But what can you say, in the teeth of a
  man's own statement, and confession?"</p>

  <p>"I have thought that he was bribed to confess himself a coward. A fellow
  may speak falsely, for reasons of his own, but cannot act falsely to his
  whole nature."</p>

  <p>"I know that you have sometimes looked at it in that way; and sometimes I
  myself have done so. But the man lives under a ban, for his life; whether he
  has earned it by his deeds, or by his words. And you would not like your only
  son to marry that man's daughter."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, while the father lived uncleared. But he is dead long ago.
  And his daughter may be pardoned."</p>

  <p>"You are a generous man, as well as a man of the world;" Colonel Westcombe
  answered, with a sad look at his friend. "But Pole is not dead. He is living
  here on Dartmoor; and my son Jack is in love with his daughter. And worse
  than that, he has engaged himself so far, that he cannot honourably draw
  back."</p>

  <p>"What a kettle of fish to be sure! It serves you quite right for educating
  him. We never wanted any education. I can spell 'Officer,' but I can't spell
  'Military.' And I don't believe the sharpest fellow on the Staff could do it;
  or at any rate not without three tries. What did you send him to Oxford
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Because he was such a dab at Latin; and there wasn't any fighting to be
  got. However, it is too late, to talk about that. The question is, what am I
  to do? And before you can say a word upon that point, you must listen to all
  that I have got to tell you."</p>

  <p>"A young fellow is generally at his worst, from two to four and twenty;"
  General Punk, with good reason, declared, having suffered lately from one of
  them. "He looks back with contempt upon boys, who are a thousand times more
  amusing than himself; and he is stupid enough to hold his tongue, when he
  might make pleasant blunders."</p>

  <p>"Jack is a sensible fellow," said the colonel; "although he may not be
  amusing. But he says very clever things sometimes, according to my weak
  judgment. But he has not done a clever thing in this, I must confess;
  according to the views of the world, at least. But, my dear friend, we must
  not be too worldly; and when you hear the facts, you will be able to excuse
  him."</p>

  <p>After this little preface, he fell to, and recounted (so far as he knew
  it) all the story concerning his son, and Rose Arthur. The general listened,
  as a judge does to a junior Counsel, with a patronizing smile, and
  comfortable nods, to show that he was attending.</p>

  <p>"One thing you must remember," said the colonel, at the finish, not being
  wholly pleased to have it taken coolly; "the young lady is a girl after my
  own heart, innocent, ladylike, gentle, and affectionate; careful, and
  thrifty, an admirable cook, highly accomplished, most simple, and modest; not
  at all a chatterer, not at all a gadabout, not contradictory, not full of her
  own beauty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A model of every feminine virtue,&mdash;except cash, and a father who can
  be produced."</p>

  <p>"Well, I must expect you to look hardly at it. But as for the
  cash&mdash;that is no obstacle at all. Upon the whole, I prefer that she
  should not have it. Jack will have plenty to rub on with."</p>

  <p>"Then you would not like her to be one of the greatest heiresses in
  England? I suppose that would be another obstacle, Westcombe?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the general watched his friend, to test his sincerity, as the
  best friends do.</p>

  <p>"That would be a very great obstacle indeed, and a fatal one altogether,
  because&mdash; But Punk, you are joking. Her father is a poor man,
  maintaining himself by his own work."</p>

  <p>"I did not even know that he was living," the general answered, with the
  smile of one, who has the clue to an astonishment; "it was said that he had
  shot himself; and it seemed quite natural. But if he is living, and can prove
  his identity, he is now Lord Pole, by courtesy; the only surviving son of
  that rakish old hermit, the old Earl Delapole."</p>

  <p>"But there is a grandson, Lord Pole's son, who stands between this man,
  and the succession. The son of that man, who tried to screen his poor
  brother. I know that he is dead, but his son is living."</p>

  <p>"Not he," cried the general; "he is as dead as this nut-shell. He was
  carried off by small-pox, some months ago. The poor old earl was mad about
  it, and would not even let the news get into the papers."</p>

  <p>"Oh why, and oh woe&mdash;as old Dods used to say&mdash;what a difference
  a little thing makes! You remember the Marquis of C&mdash; and three bullets
  that he carried on his watch-chain, for intercepting his three interceptors.
  But Pole lives such a lonely life, and is severed from all his friends so
  wholly, that I dare say he has not heard a word of all this. And from what I
  am told of him, he will not want to hear it. Is it generally known, in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"Probably, among all who care to know it. I heard it; but it did not
  concern me much; and I never thought about it, from that time to this. But
  what a fine chance, for Master Jack!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for the poor fellow, and disappointed on my own account. But
  perhaps it is all for the best," said the colonel; "he may fret a little; and
  he must not walk so much."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked General Punk; "your course is clear; mapped out,
  as we used to say, by the march of the enemy. You nab the young heiress at
  once, of course; and your son is a made man, gets in for the county, where
  the old earl's property lies, and invites me to shoot over fifty square
  miles. I have earned that, by bringing you this great news."</p>

  <p>"No," said Colonel Westcombe, looking sternly, but speaking as mildly as
  he could to his ancient friend, and present guest; "my boy's course is the
  opposite to that; unless he cuts loose from his father, and from his old
  father's ideas of"&mdash;honour he was going to say, but for fear of wounding
  his friend, said&mdash;"justice; Jack must withdraw, immediately."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" quoth the general. "Quixotic rubbish! Westcombe, you are
  joking. Clinch the nail at once. All is fair, in love, and war. Who will ever
  know, that you had ever heard of this?"</p>

  <p>"I shall know," replied his host, with the self-control which age had
  taught him. "And that is the first thing a man must consider. My dear friend,
  when you come to think, you will see that I could not act so."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry if I have given bad advice;" the general answered warmly.
  "That comes of considering the interests of one's friends. But really, your
  scruples are quite childish."</p>

  <p>"Wise, or unwise, they are not to be got over. If you were in my place,
  you would have them. Now, acting according to them, what am I to do? The
  position is a most unpleasant one."</p>

  <p>"From my point of view, which you reject, the position is a commanding
  one. But a great deal depends upon one question. Is the girl in love with
  Jack?"</p>

  <p>"That is more than I can say at present. My son is so diffident, that he
  fears to believe it. But I think that she likes him. How could she help it?
  But he has not had so very many chances."</p>

  <p>"If the girl is in love with Jack," General Punk laid down the law, as if
  he were Cupid's Commander-in-chief&mdash;"allow me to put up my bad leg, in
  the absence of the ladies&mdash;then sooner or later, she will have him,
  whatever you may do, my friend; or else she is not a true-born Pole. What is
  she like? Has she got their chin?"</p>

  <p>"I did not notice it particularly; and I did not know then who she was.
  Her eyes took my attention mainly. Let me see&mdash;yes, she has a very good
  chin; pointed, without being sharp, you know."</p>

  <p>"Then she will have Jack, you may depend upon it. The girls always have
  their own way now. It is not as it used to be. All you have to do, is to do
  nothing; if you will not make a bold stroke for it."</p>

  <p>"I must consider. I must counsel with my wife. She always hits upon the
  proper course. But come, I am neglecting my duty to you. You always have one
  glass of Burgundy, I know. There is no gout in your system. They have knocked
  that pretty well out of us both. There is a good side to everything."</p>

  <p>"I'll believe it, when I find one to my bad leg;" said the general who was
  not an optimist.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36">CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; ROVING SHOTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, "Captain Larks," as he liked to be called by his
  neighbours, was going on steadily. Of all the busy year, which surrounds the
  gardener, with a zodiac of clustering tasks, there is no busier time, than
  when he expects once more to see the Pleiads. The dry heats of summer are
  mainly gone then, and the nights of muttering thunder; and the drowsy weight
  of the air begins to tissue its track with gossamer. For the gentle dew,
  which has failed the short weak night, is spread abroad again, and a new
  bloom mantles on the seasoned leaves, and the morning, getting up when men
  can see it, glistens at its leisure down long avenues of lustre.</p>

  <p>A gardener ought to be a short man fairly, so that his fruit may not knock
  him on the head. That he, with amazement at his own skill&mdash;which after
  all, has not much to do with it&mdash;may stand with his hat on, and look up,
  and thank Providence for its bounty, and hope to save some of it from
  felonious boys. For there is no other work of all the poor exiles of
  Paradise, beset with so many expulsive plagues, as this of their original
  breakdown. Man seems to know it, and to modify his hopes; or, when experience
  has killed them, to moderate his grumbling to the utmost. Who ever heard a
  gardener grumble? Farmers do so, because it is their nature; and in better
  days, it kept the prices up. Moreover, they find in their work less solace.
  How can they identify themselves, over three or four hundred sprawling acres,
  with every object of their care? Their common plan is to attend to the good,
  and let the bad go home to its author.</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur (who was born a gardener, and a warrior only by after-birth)
  often bewailed his own size, and stature, which cumbered him in the leafy
  walks of peace, especially at pot-work.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Short, my good friend," he exclaimed one day, when he had knocked
  half the bloom off a fine bunch of grapes; "what would I give for six inches
  off, and to have my head where my shoulders are!"</p>

  <p>"And what would I give for six inches on," the vicar answered pleasantly,
  "and to have my shoulders where my head is!"</p>

  <p>This proves nothing but the discontent of man&mdash;a matter which
  requires no proving. But the captain, on the whole, was not discontented now,
  if only he could have his own way. For his pears were growing ruddy from the
  passage of the wind&mdash;which colours fruit infinitely more than any
  sun&mdash;and his apples were clustering against each other's cheeks, and his
  grapes were swelling, like that bunchy apparatus of a cow, which society
  loves, but never mentions.</p>

  <p>"I never had such a grand crop, in all my life, in spite of all the
  maggots, and the earwigs, and the drought;" the captain declared candidly to
  his pipe in confidence. "But the wasps are coming out, and the rabbits
  getting troublesome, and a lot of bluetits have come down from the furze. To
  go away now would be simple murder. And thirty new pears, from Leroy, come
  into bearing, that must be watched every day, at least, and the big ones
  fastened to their spurs with bast. All of Van Mons', or Esperen's raising, or
  that other old officer&mdash;what a queer thing it is, that since the peace
  set in, so many French and Belgian officers of cavalry have been great
  pear-growers. The one pursuit seems to lead up to the other. But here comes
  Rose! What now, my pet? How pale you look! And it takes a good deal to make
  my little girl look pale."</p>

  <p>"No. Sometimes I become so stupid, that it makes me ashamed, when I begin
  to think."</p>

  <p>As Rose pulled her hat off, and tried to look back, through the twinkling
  maze of leaves, her father set off, at a very rapid pace for a person of his
  age, and substance. He scattered a score of pears, right and left, even from
  his best nursed pyramids, and he rushed to the river-course (arcaded now with
  filberts which danced above the stream, for the trout to jump at) but neither
  there, nor anywhere could he descry a robber. He had given chase, according
  to his daughter's frightened glance, and in sequence of his own
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody," he said, as he came back, short of breath. "What made
  you think there was anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Because I saw him," answered Rose, with vivid reason. "I saw him, as
  clearly as I see you now. A tall dark man, with a rough coat on, standing in
  the bushes, and staring at me."</p>

  <p>"Show me the spot, where you fancy that he stood. You have been a little
  nervous, for some days, my darling. If a man has been there, we shall find
  some traces."</p>

  <p>Some clearness is required, as in marking down a woodcock, to show, among
  a crowd of trees, precisely the position of the something that has caught the
  eye. But Rose, who worked lovingly among her father's trees, and knew them
  all as thoroughly as her own stitch-work, led the way at once to a quick turn
  of the Christow, where a crest of fern hung over it. "He was in this fern;
  for I saw a broken frond hanging down between me, and his sandy-coloured
  legs."</p>

  <p>"Well done, my dear!" said Mr. Arthur, with a laugh, to restore her to a
  lighter mood. "His sandy-coloured trousers, I suppose you mean, or breeches,
  or whatever 'tis, that adorns the rat-catcher's nether man. No doubt it was a
  rat-catcher, or some other poacher. Dicky Touchwood pays sixpence, a head,
  for live rats, to keep his new pack of little terriers in training. No place
  is sacred where a rat lives now."</p>

  <p>He knew, as well as Rose, that it was no rat-catcher; but he could not
  bear to see her frightened in her own home-quarters.</p>

  <p>"I thought that the rat-catchers always brought their dogs," she answered,
  "and at least one boy, for company. I told you what Mike Smith said to
  me&mdash;'if you was to give me three score pun', Miss, I would not go
  arattin', up the river, by mysel'.' And Mike is considered, as you are aware,
  the bravest man in Christowell, except John Sage."</p>

  <p>"The fault of those excessively brave men is their tendency to under-rate
  their own courage. But certainly, there has been some one, or other, here;
  probably intending ill to my poor pears. Ah, now I see; how stupid of me!
  That man near Exeter&mdash;whatever is his name? The one who was so terribly
  put out, because he had nothing fit to hold a candle to my <i>Léon
  Leclerc,</i> and could not find out the name of them, although it was upon
  them. Depend upon it, he has heard of this new batch in bearing, exemplifying
  all the recent gains. And I, like a fool, have left the labels still on some
  of them. I am thankful, that he has not put his saw through every one of
  them. Of all jealous mortals, I am sorry to confess, that a gardener is the
  most jealous, narrow, and secretive. His main point is, to keep his wretched
  scraps of knowledge to himself, most strictly. Whereas a liberal-minded man
  should impart to everybody everything he knows."</p>

  <p>"And leave all the labels on his trees," said Rose; which made her father
  smile, while he told her that she could not see the proper force of any clear
  reasoning.</p>

  <p>"But what was this jealous fellow like, my dear?" he continued, as he saw
  that all her little scare was over. "To rob me of my money, is a charitable
  theft; but to rob me of my knowledge is the rapacity of a cur."</p>

  <p>"How can I tell what he was like, dear father; when the mere sight of him
  so frightened me? But he did not look like a gardening man; for they
  generally get into a lazy kind of stare."</p>

  <p>"Like mine, for instance; or Sam Slowbury's, who is off so disloyally
  harvesting, just when his hoe is wanted most. He will make a pound
  <i>extra,</i> and be three months out of work, when Farmer Willum has done
  with him. But I told you what he said to me&mdash;'The Lord made the farm;
  but the ladies makes the gardening;' with a contemptuous reference to you,
  Miss Rose."</p>

  <p>"I am sure that he never meant me; because he told me that I had very good
  ideas, sounder and more solid, ten times over, than any of my father's. He
  believed it thoroughly. And who was I to correct him?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all the proper one to do it. It would have been most ungracious.
  But I will take a walk with you, by-and-by, my dear. We will go as far as
  Brent-Fuzz corner. Mrs. Slowbury has a sore throat you say; we will take her
  some medlar jelly. And there may be something left there for us, by Master
  Pugsley. Let us work all the day, and have a walk this evening."</p>

  <p>The captain was as free from small personal fear, as any man in England.
  But the bravest man is troubled by a prowling foe, when he has a precious
  home to guard. To think that his daughter could not walk in his own garden,
  without being skulked upon and scared, aroused not his anger only, but a
  stinging sense of insecurity. He watched her as far as the porch; and then
  returned to examine the track of the enemy. But of this he made nothing; for
  the ground was very dry; and the man who had been there was cunning enough.
  So the only conclusion he arrived at was, that he durst not leave home for
  the present, without having settled his daughter in safety elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Neither did his visit to Brent-Fuzz corner tend to reassure his mind. Sam
  Slowbury was not at home, but hard at work at a harvest supper about a mile
  away; and as he took lead in the choral roar, the breeze brought his voice up
  the valley, much improved by the softening influence of travel.</p>

  <p>"He do sing bootiful!" Mrs. Slowbury whispered, wiping away an unbidden
  tear, whose source was more in the distance perhaps, than the deep inner
  meaning of her husband's words; which were, as you could make out, if you
  went to the barn-door, half a mile nigher to his lungs&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"'Tis the stroke o' the clock, to be jolly, boys;<br>
  'Tis a crack'd plate weeps for its folly, boys;<br>
  'Tis a handkercher of holly, boys,<br>
  Should tickle the prickles of the staid folk.<br>
  When a man hath been swinging his hook, boys,<br>
  He desarveth better than a book, boys,<br>
  And a' must give his leg an uncrook, boys:<br>
  By the will of the Lord, who hath made folk.<br>
  With a hip, hip, hip, hurrah, boys!"</p><br>

  <p>And a clinking of all cans in chorus.</p>

  <p>"He do sing so bootiful; it maketh me feel sad, when I look on all they
  little ones, if his breath was to go from him. And the man who sang second to
  my Sam, last year, have got the grass gone to seed over him."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of your family, Mrs. Slowbury," said the captain,
  considering the baby, who was gazing through her dangling hair at him; "you
  must not take the melancholy side of things. Think of your husband, with good
  wages now, and work for the winter before him, whatever the weather may be,
  if he keeps straight."</p>

  <p>"Ah, if he only kapeth straight," she answered; "Sam had never a better
  maister over him. But, I tell you, sir, though I cut away the bread from my
  children's lips, by saying it, he be not kaping straight, down to your
  place."</p>

  <p>"Whatever he may be doing, Mrs. Slowbury (and I have had grounds for
  suspicion lately), I will not hear a word of it, from you. It is honest, and
  very good of you, to wish to tell me. But I cannot have it so."</p>

  <p>"Sir, you are a gentleman," the poor woman answered, wiping more tears
  away, with her baby's elbow; "and you can make allowance for a poor man as is
  tempted. My Sam is so honest as the day, by temper; but what can he do again
  they golden guineas?" With a deep sob, she went to a little cupboard by the
  fire-place, and with anguish interlaced with pride, brought out a blue jar of
  coarse Bovey ware. It was half full of brown sugar, which she turned out on a
  plate; and at the bottom of the sugar were three broad guineas.</p>

  <p>"Take them, sir," she said; "they be all foul-earned. I had them out of my
  Sam's waistcoat pocket, when he were a' talkin' in his sleep, one night. A
  thing as I never knowed him do in fifteen year of married life, by reason of
  the curse of Achan. When he come to feel for 'un, I said, 'Sam, Satan hath 'a
  sent 'un; and Satan hath taken 'un away.' And he turned as white, as this
  here plate. And a' hathn't had the face to ax no more about 'un. A score of
  times, I've yearned to go, and see you, sir, concarning it. But my mind was
  so upset, that I bided, and I bided."</p>

  <p>"Bide no longer," said the captain cheerfully, "in an anxious state of
  mind. Put by those tempters for an evil day. I shall not be hard upon your
  husband, Mrs. Slowbury. A man who has an honest wife, and conscience so loud
  as to whisper in his sleep, when he sleeps as hard as Sam does, will come
  straight by-and-by, if he is well looked after."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, them's the very words, though not so grammary, as I laid to my
  buzzum, when my Sam were drunk last night. But a' must come home zober
  to-night, for a' hath to lay down the time to their voices, with the neck of
  whate, same as the first fiddler doth with his bow, in parson's gallery. Ah,
  the voice of 'un is foine, with no more nor half a gallon; and him goin' on
  for nine little 'uns now! You've took a girt lump off my mind, sir. And the
  Lord will bless 'e for doing of it; and the bootiful young leddy
  like-wise.'</p>

  <p>However there was no great lump taken off the captain's own mind, as he
  walked home with Rose; who had formed her own sensible conclusions. Neither
  was his relief increased, when he met Betty Sage, going home to the village,
  with a big sheaf of gleaning on her back, which poked her old bonnet down
  over her eyes, and chafed her with stings of ingratitude.</p>

  <p>"That's the way we poor volk zwets," cried Betty, instead of "Good
  evening, sir!" while she scratched at some fly, in the nape of her neck. "And
  the young leddies goo'th about in zilks and zatins, with zun-kivers up, when
  the zun be gone down."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so cross, Mrs. Sage," said the captain&mdash;the worst advice
  that can be given to a virtuously indignant female. "Turn in at my gate, and
  have a draught of cider."</p>

  <p>"I don't want none o' your zider, nor the 'toxicating stuff as you makes
  of harmless apples. Bain't zour, bain't zour enough to zet my teeth up. But
  I'll give e' a bit of advice, cappen. You look to your own house more
  sharper. You knows no more of what be going on, than a marly-scarly."</p>

  <p>"Run on Rose, my dear, and see whether Moggy has peppered the mushrooms.
  Now what is it you want to say, Mrs. Sage?"</p>

  <p>"Nort, sir. I never says nort of my thinkings. But they all comes true,
  without words to them. You've got a bad man about your place, cappen. A vule
  to look at, and a vule to talk to; but 'a may make vules of them, as holds
  theirselves more cleverer."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean Sam Slowbury, then?"</p>

  <p>"I shan't say who I mane, or who I don't mane. A' looketh as straight as a
  crowbar. But a' hath as many ins and outs, as the pocket of a crab-fish."</p>

  <p>"There are times of everything," thought Mr. Arthur, as old Betty trudged
  away; for he by dint of lonely work was become a meditative man; "times of
  trouble, times of peril, times of poverty, and&mdash;worst of all, times of
  perpetual advice. What will my next time be? I wonder. Probably one of
  perplexity."</p>

  <p>He could scarcely have made a better guess, what though&mdash;as every
  prize-poet always puts it&mdash;he had added, to the wisdom of the snakes of
  Wistman's wood, the rapid acumen of the moorland fox&mdash;that reynard who
  dwells in the centre of a tor, and will not be dug out by the deepest
  archæologist.</p>

  <p>For behold, on the following day, there were puffs of smoke in the breezy
  distance, and far away sounds of feeble pops, such as a little boy makes with
  a foxglove. Now this was General Punk, in pursuit of the colonel's grouse,
  who had not behaved well, but maintained an ungrateful attitude. From first
  to last, they could scarcely have cost anything under a guinea apiece; and
  their duty was, to get up at the proper distance, and tumble down again, when
  the gun went off. But instead of that, what they did, was this. No sooner did
  they see a man, half a mile away&mdash;the very man perhaps to whom (after
  Providence, and their parents) they owed everything, than away they went,
  like a flight of stars shooting upon the horizon, instead of being shot. And
  the one, or two, that did have the manners to lie decently, never fell at
  all, when they were shot at; but appeared to receive no more injury from
  lead, than a patient does from pills, at which he shakes his head
  externally.</p>

  <p>This might have been explained very naturally, if none but General Punk
  had shot at them. But when Mr. Short, who was a first-rate marksman, had
  fired three times, without bagging a feather, and the colonel, who was also
  tolerably straight, had banged more than once, with no better result,
  <i>Nous,</i> who had done his very utmost, came, with the young lemon setter,
  who had listened to his orders, and sat down, and looked at the four
  gentlemen, General Punk, Colonel Westcombe, and Jack, and his own valued
  master, with a gaze of sad inquiry. There was no contempt in it, or at any
  rate not much, for he had known such things occur before; and he was not a
  cynical dog, but capable of much indulgence to human errors. His beautiful
  brown eyes simply said&mdash;"Well, gentlemen, you have done very badly.
  Perhaps you sat up too late, last night. But do try to pull yourselves
  together; or else you will ruin this young dog here, who is out for the first
  time, and has not had my experience."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what it is," said Mr. Short; "John Sage is at the bottom of
  all this. Westcombe, you put the grouse under his care; and he has made them
  as wary as himself. John can bag things; but who could bag him?"</p>

  <p>"Passon be so peart," answered old John, with a grin; "I've a'knowed 'un
  bag a man, and let 'un goo out of the bag."</p>

  <p>"Well done, John!" exclaimed the colonel, with a laugh. "Short, you'd
  better let old John alone, till Sunday. Come, gentlemen, I can see our
  luncheon on the hill, and Miss Touchwood come to enliven it. Let us have it;
  and then put our barrels straighten Jack, you have not had one shot yet."</p>

  <p>"'Tis better to have shot, and missed, than never to have shot at all;"
  said the vicar, with a knowing glance at his young companion; "Jack, you are
  in the dumps to-day; and general, even you, on your pony, have not brought so
  much as a hat down."</p>

  <p>"I never shoot at hats, without heads inside them," answered the general;
  and again the parson got the worst of his own wit.</p>

  <p>But after luncheon, as usually happens, a different state of things set
  in. Julia was there with sparkling eyes, brighter than the colonel's best
  champagne; and most radiant she showed herself, to every one but Jack, whom
  she treated with a dignified reserve. Then they laid out their plan for the
  afternoon, to shoot in two divisions; for a brace of old pointers had come
  with the food. Colonel Westcombe, and Mr. Short, were to go in one direction,
  while the general and Jack, with old John to help them, were to follow up a
  mark, and take the likeliest places, towards the eastern boundary of the
  moors; where they might find partridges as well as grouse, for the day of St.
  Giles was with them.</p>

  <p>As it happened, the course of the sport led this division of the party
  towards Christowell; and the general, with John Sage to load his gun, and
  lead the grey pony, when needful, parted company for some time with young
  Westcombe, who had hit upon a family of wild ducks, and went after them down
  a marshy glade.</p>

  <p>"Sage, who lives in yonder cottage in the hollow?" asked General Punk,
  pointing down to Larks' cot; "what a sweetly romantic spot! Have they got any
  beer? My throat is quite parched; and I have had enough of shooting. The road
  is not so very bad. I shall just ride down. They will not refuse a tired man
  a glass of ale, I dare say. The good folk about here are always
  hospitable."</p>

  <p>"The gentleman as liveth there, be zummut of a rum 'un, and kapeth volk
  out of's pramishes mainly. But he be a girt friend of Passon Shart; and if so
  be, you spakes the name of passon, he'll not denai thee zummut to wash down
  the pillum. Cappen Larks be the name of 'un."</p>

  <p>"Very well; then you stop here, my man," said the general, handing his gun
  to John; "for fear of our losing Mr. Westcombe altogether. And when you have
  let him know where we are, you can come, and lead my pony up the hill
  again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur was aware that his friend Short had been asked to join the
  shooting party; and as the west wind brought the sound of fowling-pieces, he
  thought it not unlikely that the parson might come down from the moor, for a
  glass of his cider. To meet this chance, he begirt himself to a troublesome
  task of pruning, to take out a thicket of dead wood, from an ancient, and
  thoroughly crabbed apple-tree&mdash;a stern aboriginal of the place,
  unshapely, uncouth, ungenial, standing out with snags and tatters, yet
  knuckled here and there with clumps of fruit, as thick as a pile of
  toadstools. Ungainly, nubbly, fruit it was, as hard and tough as hartshorn,
  raspy, to the teeth, and fetching strong language out of the lips of the
  biter. Nevertheless, there was no such apple on the place, to bring out, and
  tarten up, the flavour of the gentle ones in cider; as a vein of adversity
  braces, and brightens, the mellowness of the genial mind. Therefore, and for
  the sake of contrast with the cones of shapely culture round it, the captain
  spared this ancient crab, and let it follow its own bent.</p>

  <p>Working upon his light double ladder here, and taking out the dead wood
  with a little curved saw, he commanded the view of the track from the downs,
  which scarcely deserved to be called a road. And presently he espied a
  figure, which clearly was not Mr. Short's, coming slowly down the hill upon a
  fat grey pony. "A soldier, as sure as I'm alive," thought the captain; "I
  seem to know that peculiar seat. But he looks very feeble, and in trouble. I
  must go and help him."</p>

  <p>Getting down from his ladder, he unlocked a little spiked gate in the
  fence, and went to meet the stranger. The general was in danger, for the
  steepness of the hill had jarred his wounded leg, and he could scarcely keep
  the saddle; while the old grey pony, who had a will of his own, was
  threatening to make a rush of it. Then the captain ran up, and took the pony
  by the head, and the old man, tired, and trembling, and in agony, fell
  forward, and rested on the other's shoulder. Mr. Arthur supported him, and
  looked up at him, and told him to rest himself there for a while.</p>

  <p>"God bless me!" cried the general, "who are you? If my name is Punk, I can
  swear that yours is Pole."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37">CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; THE WAY THE CAT JUMPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The behaviour of a man, who has long been "under a cloud,"
  when he finds that cloud rent open, depends very much upon his constitution;
  and his constitution is made up of a quantity of constituents. Towards the
  milder, and larger half of life, the mind begins to work, on its own account,
  and to seek its own wages, after a generation of steady discipline, and
  useful reverence. Disturbing influences (such as universal brotherhood, dread
  of illiberality, the worship of women, and nature, and the like, and the
  dreams of perfection, as illusive as herself) settle down into a wholesome
  desire to do one's best, and believe in it. But there still remains the
  tender love of the few, who still depend upon him.</p>

  <p>Captain Larks had never set up to be a man of particular largeness. He
  could not abstract himself into great thoughts, and soar in a circumference
  far above his head. He liked his little jobs, and stuck very close to them,
  and was vexed, when they did not turn out well. And the stir of little
  interests kept him fresh, and sweet to mankind, and manly.</p>

  <p>"You are tired, and weak, and in pain," he said to the old man, who had
  discovered him; "my cottage is a little way down this lane. Come, and rest
  there, until you feel well again."</p>

  <p>"But you don't mean to tell me, that you are not Pole!'" the general
  replied, as he yielded gladly to the strong man's aid and guidance. My name
  is Pole. And I take you to be the General Punk, under whom I had the
  honour&mdash;'Fire and Punk'was your pet name, sir."</p>

  <p>"So it was, so it was," the old man answered; "and I wish it was still,
  Pole; I wish it was still. Ah, those were the days, it was life to live in!
  But you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Consider me as one you have never seen before; and yet who is only too
  glad to have the chance of doing you the smallest service."</p>

  <p>General Punk was in too much pain, to care to talk of any one, except
  himself. And he graciously submitted to be led down the hill, and taken off
  his pony by careful hands, and helped into the cool, and shadowy cottage.</p>

  <p>"What a delightful nook!" he said; "take care of my leg, my dear young
  lady. Ah, I see, by your smile, that I need not tell you. Now don't begin
  supposing that I have got the gout. No such luck, it is ten times worse. Not
  that I mean to take the smallest notice of it. Half an hour's rest will quite
  set me up again. Now what is your name, my pretty dear? An old man may take
  liberties, you know."</p>

  <p>"My name is Rose Arthur, sir;" she said, "and I hope to have the pleasure
  of helping you, a little."</p>

  <p>"You have done that already, and more than a little. You seem to feel
  everything, as if you had got it. But I must soon be off; or I shall lose my
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"It is not to be thought of," said the captain coming forward; "you must
  submit to our rough fare. To attempt to ride, ten or twelve miles, as you
  are, is utterly out of the question. I know what an old wound is, when
  jarred. Rest, and coolness, are the only things for it. We will send up a
  message to the game-keeper."</p>

  <p>The general vowed that he would not have it so; and got up, to prove his
  activity. But all that he took by the movement was a thrill of pain, a
  stagger, and a biting of the lips; because he was too good to swear, in the
  presence of a lady. "I can't bear to trouble you," was all that he could say;
  for his bad leg began to get worse very fast.</p>

  <p>Now this was a difficult position, for all three, the general, the
  colonel, and the captain; as well as for younger people, whose affairs were
  involved in what might come of it. The worst case of all was the general's;
  because he could nor get away from it, and was driven, by the irony of facts,
  to shout for a man disgraced out of the army. No one could lift him, except
  this man; for the general was heavy, towards the centre of his system; and he
  wanted a good deal of lifting, and refreshment, whenever Dr. Perperaps had
  poked at him.</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe also felt the urgency of things. Here was a guest of his
  by right, driven, by the force of circumstances, into alien shelter. He felt
  it his duty to follow him up, and see that he was treated properly. But how
  could he do so, against the broad fact, that he was not wanted over
  there?</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said quietly to Miss Touchwood, "you are very young; but you
  know much more of the ways of the present world, than I do. It happens, that
  I cannot well go over now, through peculiar circumstances, with which I will
  not trouble you."</p>

  <p>"I know that there is a maze of mystery among them," answered Julia, who
  was generous, and by no means always spiteful; "but, Uncle John, they are to
  be pitied, not condemned; until people get to the bottom of it. Write a kind
  letter, an exceedingly kind letter, to General Punk, congratulating him, upon
  having fallen upon his legs&mdash;no, that might seem too personal&mdash;upon
  being thus among good Samaritans; and say you will only be too happy to send
  the carriage, with the soft linings, for him; as soon as the doctor lets him
  up."</p>

  <p>"I think that would be rude," replied Colonel Westcombe; "not to him, I
  mean, but to his entertainer. You are right about writing a letter, my dear;
  but it must not be to the general. It must be to poor Pole himself."</p>

  <p>"Pole! Who is he?" the young lady asked. "How many more aliases has he
  got? There must be some very great secret somewhere. Uncle John, shall we
  ever understand it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied the colonel, with a smile at her quick manner; "and
  if so, it will be a little lesson to us, to attend to our own business."</p>

  <p>"I cannot regard it, from that point of view, with any satisfaction.
  Because it appears to me so wrong, and so dishonest, to get into society,
  under false pretences. The thing of all others that annoys me most, is that
  my own mother, who has never been taught to bridle her curiosity, sits down
  before that mysterious man, as if she quite feared to say, 'how do you
  do?'&mdash;because the question might seem inquisitive. And then our poor
  Dicky is afraid of him too. In the name of the Seven Wonders, who is the man?
  I am sure, by your face, that you know. Now tell me; or I won't say a single
  word, all dinner-time to-day."</p>

  <p>"You never would punish both us, and yourself, to that extreme, dear
  Julia. Your nature is to talk; and you cannot help it. But if other people
  don't want to talk, what right have we to force them?"</p>

  <p>Captain Larks, on the other hand, as every man has his own regard, felt
  most strongly that of all this trouble the worst part fell on his own
  shoulders. He was under no debt of friendship, whatever, to General Punk,
  thus forced upon him; and to have his little cottage thus again invaded, was
  a trial to even his serenity. "I know what old Punk is," he said to himself;
  "and I never shall forget, how he scowled at me, upon the saddest occasion in
  all my life. He was bound to do so, by his own ideas; and by those I must
  measure him. But how differently Westcombe looked at me! There are times in
  one's life, when the value of it hangs upon a single gaze. I must do my best
  for this man, of course. But it will not be from gratitude."</p>

  <p>It was not the trouble to his little household, that vexed
  him&mdash;although that was no trifle,&mdash;nor even the untimeliness of the
  occurrence, just when his own affairs were pressing; but what disturbed him
  chiefly, was the difficulty about Colonel Westcombe.</p>

  <p>There are some few men, come across, at far and casual intervals, whom we
  grieve to have never met, at the age when there was friendship. It is not for
  their fame, or deeds, or virtues, that we long to know them; but because
  there is something in them, heart-akin to our own hearts. We care not, what
  their views may be, in politics, in literature, or any of the passing fancies
  of the day; but we say to ourselves&mdash;"here is a man, whom we must have
  loved, if we had only had the luck." And then, we sigh, that it is now too
  late; and fall back upon our old acquaintance.</p>

  <p>However, it is a very ill wind, that blows no good to any one. And
  although young Westcombe was abashed, at first, by this sudden turn of
  things, and obliged to keep sadly in the back-ground ,&mdash;wherein he found
  a big black tor, to sit upon, and watch the smoke, whose lower breath had
  gone into the general's sick broth&mdash;before very long, things turned up
  so, that he could come in for his own share of them.</p>

  <p>Partly no doubt, this was owing, as it generally is, to diligent exertions
  of his own. For he ventured to call, without violent intrusion, upon Dr.
  Perperaps; because he was in a condition of throat which loudly demanded
  liquorice.</p>

  <p>"You must be very careful," said the doctor; "breathe just a little hard.
  Thank you, sir, thank you. As yet there is nothing to arouse solicitude. But
  we must not rest content with such condition of the tonsils. The trachea also
  shows premonitory symptoms. The earliest indications of scarlet&mdash;but I
  will avoid language, that might make you perhaps susceptive. My dear young
  sir, I would entreat you, to abstract your mind from disquietude. This little
  instrument proclaims to me, that all is not quite right here; "the doctor
  tapped his waistcoat over several parts, for fear of hitting the wrong one;
  "it is well that you have applied to me, in this early stage. Has there been
  anything, anything external, to set up internal phlogitis?"</p>

  <p>"I borrowed some very bad tobacco last night, from an old man of ours,
  whom I met upon the moor; and while I was thanking him, I swallowed a strong
  whiff."</p>

  <p>"You should have consulted me at once, my dear sir. But I trust sincerely
  that it is not too late. You require an emultient, then a sedative, and after
  that a due course of tonics. Spotty, my dear, make up No. 77."</p>

  <p>Established thus upon a course of medicine (all of which followed the
  course of the river), Jack Westcombe found himself upon a healthy road, to
  get near his darling Rose, once more. Youths of the present day, who dash
  headlong over every obstacle betwixt them and their loves&mdash;when assured
  that the money bag is on the right side of it&mdash;never would put up with
  such little items of scruples, as stopped Jack Westcombe. And even he was
  inclined, at last, to push aside punctilio; as he found the season passing,
  and his love no nearer gathering. Then, as usual, fairer aid appeared, and
  seduced him into side-long tricks. Sporetta hated Julia Touchwood, who had
  snubbed her nobly; and she knew that Julia had a weakness for the son of her
  godfather.</p>

  <p>One day, at the top of the village, she met that nobly-principled young
  man, coming from his course of medicine, at her father's home of health. Jack
  was casting sheep's eyes up the road, that led to the captain's gate; but
  sternly bracing his mind towards the footpath leading to Farmer Willum's,
  where he now put up his horse. Then Spotty declared her own opinion.</p>

  <p>"I call you no better than a muff," said she. "How can you carry on like
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Like what, Miss Perperaps!" he inquired, looking at her loftily; "I
  scarcely understand your question."</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean, well enough. Why don't you go in, and win?"</p>

  <p>"You still speak in parables;" answered he, with a desire to be off; but a
  stronger desire to hear out her words.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you show a little pluck? Or, if that is not fine enough
  language for you, a little determination? You love Rose; and Rose loves you.
  Why don't you checkmate the old fogies?"</p>

  <p>"Really you seem to take a most kind interest in my affairs, Miss
  Perperaps! Who told you, that Miss Arthur ever even deigned to think of
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Bosh!" exclaimed the lady; "it is plainer than a pikestaff. But I am not
  going to tell you all I know." With that she showed her new boots, and said
  "Good day!"</p>

  <p>"This is most unfair and most unfeeling;" cried Jack, going after her, as
  she knew he must do. "Miss Perperaps, my dear and kind Miss Perperaps, I beg
  you to explain yourself, and not to run away."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was you, that were in such a hurry. But my dear father wants
  me. I have ten dozen pills to make up, before five o'clock. Good day, Mr.
  Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"I'll make the pills. Or I'll come and help you. And you can have mine, to
  begin with; I have got at least three dozen here; and I can spare them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have got some fun in you, after all," Spotty replied, with a very
  broad grin; "I thought you were a stick, and took them all. My father
  considers you a splendid patient."</p>

  <p>"So I am; so I am. The most devoted. Oh, I won't get well for a year, Miss
  Perperaps; if you will only tell me, what you meant just now."</p>

  <p>"I meant just what I said," she answered, sitting on a roadside slab, to
  talk. "Miss Arthur is as fond of you, as you are of her."</p>

  <p>"That is a simple impossibility. If you could only tell me, what makes you
  think so, how I would, how I should&mdash;it would be so nice of you!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I owe you a good turn, or two; and I can't bear to see your tongue
  so white. Did you ever pick an oak-apple, in the Fingle Valley?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I found a very pretty one, fluted like a love-knot; and I ventured
  to give it to Miss Arthur, just to look at. And I don't think she gave it
  back to me."</p>

  <p>"Of course she did not. Is this like it? I stole it out of her most sacred
  corner, where she keeps her dead mother's handkerchiefs. And as soon as she
  missed it, what a way she was in! Though of course, she pretended not to care
  one rap. She has not the least idea that I have got it; or gentle as she is,
  she would slap me, I believe. And that's not all, that shows the way the cat
  jumps. For I began to run you down, one day, on purpose to torment her. And
  her eyes&mdash;my goodness, you will have to look out, when she is Mrs.
  Westcombe!"</p>

  <p>"You have made me so happy, I could kiss your hands, after you have rolled
  a thousand pills. But after all, it is not very much, when one comes to think
  of it."</p>

  <p>"Then go, and get more, you insatiable young man. But I tell you, it is
  everything. Do you think I don't know, what girls are? Shake yourself
  together well; and go, and pop the question."</p>

  <p>"What a practical mind you have!" he answered, with much admiration. "But
  how am I to do it, when I can't get in? I am under no promise about it now:
  but still there is a general understanding, that I am to be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Backward in coming forward. Very well; don't let me advise you<i>;</i> or
  when the days of repentance come, you will say&mdash;'she did it.' My Step
  said that to my beloved parent, about somebody unknown, when they had a
  little scrimmage, last Sunday night. Therefore, I would advise you strongly,
  not to be anywhere, this evening."</p>

  <p>"But how can I help being somewhere? You know where I ought to be; and you
  will not tell me."</p>

  <p>"How sharp you are! You've been eating sparrow-pie. But whatever you do,
  fight shy, this evening, of the captain's leather-coat apple-tree. Where the
  hill comes up under the cliff, you know, at the highest corner of his
  property. Somebody goes there every evening, with her heart in her mouth, to
  peep over the moor; and it would never do, for you to be there too."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly, I should be an interloper. I thank you for warning me to
  keep my distance. Miss Perperaps, I hear that Betty Sage is ill. I hope it is
  nothing serious."</p>

  <p>"Not much, for her. She ate three hedge-hogs, for breakfast, on Tuesday,
  and they were not well baked. Her appetite was good, and she swallowed some
  spines; and she says that they have stuck fast in her own. But you had better
  tell John, to keep away from home. He will have sense enough to do that, when
  he knows it. His Betty would say, that it was all his fault; although he was
  a dozen miles out of sight; and then she might die, to prove it. But I have
  taken her out of father's hands; and she begins to perceive the difference.
  If she is only left to me, she will come round, for certain. But if my father
  gets another turn at her, it will be a very narrow squeak indeed. I have told
  her, to shut up her pill-trap against him."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the general's case, as you seem to form your own
  opinions so? When will he be able to come back to us?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell. My father is getting sadly jealous; he won't let me have a
  turn at that old shaver. I belong to the positive school. Kill or cure, is my
  ticket for soup."</p>

  <p>"And the right one, I believe;" Jack answered mildly, for he had not had
  time to think of it; and Spotty's strong views were strange to him; "the next
  time I ring the bell, I shall ask,&mdash;is Dr. Miss Perperaps at home, and
  her father gone away, so as not to spoil her practice?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would. I'd give a guinea, if you would; and I've only got one
  against my bill at Mother Cork's. My Step would get the message, and my
  criky, she would stare! But you haven't got the spirit to do it; any more
  than you have, to go near the crab-tree to-night. Good-bye."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38">CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; UNDER THE CRAB-TREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing can be further from the mark than to take a man, and
  how much more a woman, strictly according to self-appraisement. Nature has
  provided us, with things to think of, far more important than our own
  concerns&mdash;our neighbours in the first place, and politics, and the
  weather, and the last new murder, and the last old judicial joke&mdash;for
  our judges now are our finest jokers&mdash;and if we ever get home again, to
  think about ourselves at all, modesty steps in, and spoils the balance.</p>

  <p>Conspicuous among the men, who underrate themselves, was Dr. Perperaps, of
  Christowell.</p>

  <p>He felt that he ought to be more than he was; and his views were
  exceedingly scientific. But no outlet for them, and no income from them, as
  well as the recent death of a large ratepayer, from lockjaw&mdash;which
  everybody said he should have stopped&mdash;combined to make him yearn for
  something solid, a fine, slow case, a protracted cure (if any), and the money
  on the nail; which he therefore must abstain from hitting on the head too
  speedily.</p>

  <p>Throughout the summer, he had reproached himself, and been reproached by
  his wife, at pensive periods, for letting Dicky Touchwood get well so
  prematurely. And now he was resolved to avoid so sad an error, in the new
  opening offered by the general's bad leg.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take?" Mr. Arthur asked him, wistfully. "Not that I have
  any wish to hurry him, of course. But when will he be able to be moved, with
  safety?"</p>

  <p>"He is an ancient warrior;" the doctor answered warily; "what a privilege
  it is, to be useful to him! Our country owes everything to these old heroes.
  And a brother-in-arms, sir, a brother-in-arms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but how long will he be in my arms? I appreciate the privilege. But
  I want to know its duration. Because I have to make some arrangements of my
  own."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, the first physician in England could not tell you. I have
  scarcely had time for even an elementary diagnosis yet. My
  impression,&mdash;observe that I do not state it as more than a rudimentary
  impression,&mdash;is that the hero of a hundred fights has got suppressed
  gout in his system. I have tested him gently for arthritic indications; but
  he strongly objects to being tested."</p>

  <p>"I heard him request you, to go to the Devil."</p>

  <p>"It was a truly consistent request; and tended to confirm my diagnosis.
  Gouty patients do that always; forgetting what would happen to themselves,
  when left behind. But, my dear sir, if you cannot entertain this
  distinguished visitor, in his sad distress, perhaps I could contrive, without
  much danger, to have him brought down to my humble abode."</p>

  <p>This made the captain look as fierce as Pharaoh; and the doctor
  facetiously held up his bamboo, to protect himself; and therewith made
  off.</p>

  <p>"What must be, must," thought the other, as he went about his work quite
  cheerfully; "old Fire and Punk seems very much at home. But he is not the
  man, to be long upon his back. If it were not for that pompous rogue of a
  Perperaps, Punk would be up, and off, to-morrow. Wait a bit. Something will
  arise, within a week, to change the situation."</p>

  <p>Something arose within an hour, to change the situation largely. What man,
  having begun a job, can bear to leave off at three-quarters done? When he has
  only done a little, it may be in his power to lay his tools down, and go
  away, muttering to himself,</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Dimidium facti, qui bene c&oelig;pit, habet.</i>"</p><br>

  <p>But when he has got beyond the half (which comes none the sooner, for the
  mere beginning) his spirit is up; and his eyes, and fingers, itch to admire
  the end of it. And this is the spirit of the mighty artist.</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur, in his little way, was a mighty artist. He could so enwrap
  himself in his work, as to let everything else slip off; like water, from the
  plumage of a sweetly oily duck. And he had that fine desire to complete a job
  well, through want of which, so many men of genius fail. This led him again
  to that leathery crab-tree,&mdash;not at all a pleasant job, to a gardener of
  high art; because it was a crude, cantankerous subject. But his mind was set
  upon it, to make good the interruption of the general's disaster, a few days
  ago.</p>

  <p>Now General Punk had been quite terrible, all day; and especially severe
  to all who did their best to help him. If anybody whispered that, "he would
  very soon be better," the strongest words were helpless to express his
  indignation; and he scowled at such atrocity.</p>

  <p>Even Rose, to whom he had been courteous, and gentle, in his very worst
  pangs hitherto, had been obliged, this day, to relieve his tongue, which
  suffered (in sympathy with his system) from repression, by making some very
  hasty exits. And Moggy said, without euphemism, he was "nort but an auld
  divil."</p>

  <p>Towards eventide, Miss Arthur, who had enough to do among them, came out
  for a breath of sweet-languaged air, and the freedom of dwelling with larger
  things. She had always loved the great moorland view, and the calm
  ennoblement of the hills, as they drew the sinking light around them, and
  fostered every farewell glance. She loved to see, how they yielded rank, to
  the larger lands behind them, and accepted shadow, as they cast their own, in
  stately grades subordinate.</p>

  <p>Our minds must be very much improved, no doubt, from the condition of the
  old British mind, as it used to work, not more than a hundred years ago. When
  it wants to describe a thing, the mind makes words, or at any rate, doubles
  up the old ones into new cocked-hats, and is proud of having found out
  something fresh. Upon this new windfall, out dash a score of other minds; as
  a yardful of sparrows gives chase to the one, who has fatally found
  pie-crust; or as men run after the man, who has hit upon a scampish trick,
  that pays. The great artists are the men who have taught our eyes to see, and
  our tongues to speak.</p>

  <p>Now this fine sense of abstract beauty should&mdash;if it did its business
  well&mdash;suffice to keep the mind, from dwelling on little side-issues of
  its own. But it is to be observed, in the history of all great artists, that
  the largest perception of "the beautiful" never has so sufficed at all. They
  are full of it, possessed, inspired, radiant; but the expansion of their
  minds has its little puckers still.</p>

  <p>How much more then, is this to be expected, when the mind, inspired by
  large outlook, is only that of a poor young maiden, left to its own
  philosophy! There was comfort in the quiet of the hills to her, and a
  soothing power in the evening light; but still her heart came through her
  mind; as the round fruit blushes through the glistening of the leaves. And
  her heart, though not put into words, was full of something, and somebody.
  For surely, with the better half of mind, there is nothing more grievous,
  than to think, and think, and have nothing to say about any of it; and the
  breast, and the hearty parts, that go on very well (if the brain will only
  let them have their turn) must come up sometimes, and say, that they too have
  a share in the system.</p>

  <p>There had been many things combining (as things generally do) to come down
  upon Rose, and torment, and vex her, to the furthest boundary of her large,
  and gentle patience. To a proud, quick-minded, and sensitive girl, it was no
  small pain, to begin with, to see how her father was behaving towards his
  unexpected guest. Her father evidently knew full well, why the general was so
  polite to him,&mdash;coldly polite, not even swearing, when the captain was
  in the room. The latter never stayed longer than to discharge the duties of a
  host, with a pleasure as stiff as a formal dinner-party.</p>

  <p>Then while he was doing it, the general watched him, with a supercilious
  gaze, tempered now and then, when his pains came on, with a cross indignant
  pity.</p>

  <p>"What can my father have done?" thought Rose. "What can he have done, to
  lead to this? He never can have deserved it; but what induces him to put up
  with it&mdash;he who is one of the proudest of mankind?"</p>

  <p>Moreover, she was troubled, to the limit of her untried capacity for
  trouble, by the colonel's conduct. What made him keep away, so entirely from
  them, and only send inquiries, by some servant, or casual visitor across the
  moor? And why did her father seem to think that right, when her own sense
  told her that it was quite wrong?</p>

  <p>Over, and above, and perhaps below these thoughts, were many, no less
  grievous, touching the tenderness of her own cares. Without confession to
  herself, or any direct discussion of the subject, somehow or other, she had
  been led to think so highly of young Mr. Westcombe, that he seemed to be the
  one to solve all this.</p>

  <p>But not even once had he been near her, to the utmost of her knowledge,
  since, under the ash-tree, he had seemed to set his heart, upon her kindly
  thoughts of him. "No doubt, he despises me, as everybody else does," was the
  bitter conclusion of her poor young heart; "when people live in mystery, they
  must expect it. I will be like my father; I will disdain them all; although
  it is most uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Thinking thus, she looked towards the west; as people out of doors do
  mainly, when their spirits are in declination. She was standing inside her
  father's fence; which was hard to climb just there, and gave her strong sense
  of security. After her recent scare, she feared to wander in the lower ground
  alone; but here she could see any sign of approach, and might run away home,
  without being cut off. And the rise of the ground gave her plenty of height,
  to look over the fence, to the long sweep of moor, and the coving of the
  combes, that made dark-elbowed shades below them.</p>

  <p>Why should the human race, or any other, have two eyes&mdash;till their
  brethren knock out one&mdash;unless it is, to see two things at once? By a
  thousand arguments it may be shown, that the large, benevolent, orthodox,
  intelligent, and intelligible, law of nature, was&mdash;that binocular beings
  should squint. For the first week of our lives, we all do so; and if wisely
  let alone, we might retain that gift. But the nurses go against it; and the
  supple sequacity, which has been nursed into us from our cradles, induces one
  eye to go after the other, and become shackled to it; in spite of the nose,
  which was meant to keep them independent After this what reasonable hope can
  we have of objectivity?</p>

  <p>Without the large outlook, vouchsafed to those mortals, whose twain eyes
  turn outward, Rose Arthur contrived to see two figures, at the very same
  moment, though far apart, and quite invisible to each other. One was in a
  swampy goyal, partly lit by sunset, through a gap in the western heights
  above; and the other was on the hill-front, towards her, rapidly
  descending.</p>

  <p>The one, in the goyal, had something, that looked like a long gun, on his
  shoulder; and he suddenly turned into a shadowy corner, and so far as she
  could make out, sat down. The other came hastily into the track, where the
  general had met with his disaster, lately; and then running down to the
  little spiked gate, looked through, and saw her, and implored to be let
  in.</p>

  <p>"Why should I let you in?" asked Rose, doubtfully feeling for her key.</p>

  <p>"Why should you keep me out?" asked the other, "it is very important that
  I should come in."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be rude to keep you out. But this is not the proper way
  to call; nor the proper time of day, to expect to get in. But you may come
  in, Mr. Westcombe.</p>

  <p>"It is most kind of you to let me in," said Jack, taking care to get
  inside, before the young lady could change her mind; and then looking at her
  with steadfast eyes, which expressed an enormous stock of admiration, and a
  mild determination, to make something of it. "But it would have been a cruel
  thing, to keep me out. You never do cruel things, do you, Miss Arthur?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Westcombe; or if I ever do, I am always sorry afterwards. I am
  obliged to kill things, very often. What can we do with slugs, and
  grubs?"</p>

  <p>"But if you have pity for them," said Jack; "nasty marauders as they are;
  how sorry you must be, to trample on your own poor fellow-creatures!"</p>

  <p>"But I never do anything of the kind," Rose answered, looking at her
  little feet to make quite sure; "unless you mean poor Squire Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean him. I wish I did; the more you trample upon him, the
  better. I mean one a little better, at any rate, than that fellow; though a
  very humble individual still. If you look at me, you will see my sad
  meaning."</p>

  <p>Rose smiled very sweetly, as she looked at him, and said&mdash;"If you
  have been trampled on, you bear it very well. You show no signs of ill-usage;
  but rather every symptom of happiness, and self-content. Mr. Westcombe, in
  what way are you pitiable?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps, for the moment, rather less so than usual; because in a
  certain sweet presence, I am always pervaded with a sudden rush of happiness.
  It is like coming out of the shade into the light, from the winter to the
  summer, from a coal mine to a meadow full of bright flowers, and sunshine.
  Don't laugh now; that is too bad of you. I know that I am not at all
  poetical&mdash;but still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think you are very poetical indeed. Squire Dicky never said
  anything, half so fine. He only said two things at all poetical; though he
  seemed to be trying, very hard, and very brilliantly."</p>

  <p>"Oh tell me, what his two flights of poetry were. I never should have
  dreamed, that he could do so much as that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did. He told me once, that he would rather sit, and look at me,
  than see a badger drawn, by his best dog, 'Bob.' And another time, he said,
  that the sound of my voice was sweeter than the tinkle of a new tap of pale
  ale, running into a three quart jug."</p>

  <p>"So it is. He was quite right. But how could you resist him, after such a
  noble flight of poetry? I should have been quite terrified; if I had known he
  was so clever."</p>

  <p>"One must grow capable of more, and more resistance, as one grows older
  rapidly." This gave the talk a serious turn, and made them look at one
  another; the result of which was as usual.</p>

  <p>Rose thought, how noble, and how simple was his mind; and his heart so
  soft, and excellent; and his outward form quite good enough, to defend her,
  and be managed by her. Jack thought how lovely, and how sweet she was; with
  at least as much mind as any husband wants, and a heart that his own yearned
  after. Their eyes met gently; and he drew her to him.</p>

  <p>"Darling Rose," he said; "how long, am I to be uncertain, what you mean?
  You are not one of the flimsy kind, who have no heart worth having. Your
  nature is noble, steadfast, grand."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing very grand about me," she said, prolonging the sweet
  surrender; "if you think that, you will be sadly disappointed."</p>

  <p>"But give me the chance of the disappointment. I ask for you, only as you
  are; according to my own account, not yours. You promised to think kindly of
  me. Have you done it? Have you been able to do it, sweet Rose?"</p>

  <p>"I have done it. And I have made up my mind, that I like you, as well
  as&mdash;as well as you like me."</p>

  <p>"Liking has nothing to do with it, Rose. Do you love me, as I love
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You must not be too hard upon me. I have never had this to do before. But
  I do love you, John, a great deal better than myself."</p>

  <p>"Then you will give yourself to me," John Westcombe said; and perceiving
  that her eyes were bright with tears, as she bowed her head, he laid the head
  gently upon his shoulder, and kissed away the tears; and then found it
  essential to kiss the trembling lips as well; because there were symptoms of
  a happy sob between them. "Now you are mine; for ever mine;" he was
  whispering, in the most lovely rapture; when a stern voice came, from behind
  the crab-tree.</p>

  <p>"Halloa, sir! What are you doing there?" And the voice was followed by a
  tall man striding, who took Rose from Jack, as a bird whips a feather from
  another bird's nest, and said,&mdash;"Go home directly. I will speak to you,
  by-and-by." Then, to John Westcombe, he spoke disdainfully&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sir, I had imagined, that you were a man of honour."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so hasty, sir," Jack answered; for he possessed the true basis
  of all courage&mdash;self-command; "I am not ashamed of anything that I have
  done, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you are not. You consider it no harm whatever, to have broken
  your parole."</p>

  <p>"You forget, sir, how the time goes by. I have broken no parole. I pledged
  myself, for the fishing season; because you allowed me to come up your water.
  Not that I cared for the fishing, two tails of a gnat; but that I could see
  your house. When the fishing expired, my bond expired. And the trout in the
  Christow are beginning to prepare to spawn before very long; as Mr. Short
  says, who understands them well. And Mr. Short says, that it has been agreed,
  by all who understand the subject, that the fishing in these upper waters
  ceases, upon partridge-shooting day. And that was a week ago almost; so that
  I have taken no advantage, but purposely left it all on your side."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for your sake," said the captain, looking at him, so that
  Jack's grey eyes went down; "that your honour can be satisfied, with such
  flimsy stuff as this. To use it as an argument, is an insult to me; or else a
  disgrace to your own self. Say rather, that you were overcame by youthful
  haste; and then I will endeavour to respect you again."</p>

  <p>This to a young man of Jack's shy pride, was almost too bitter to put up
  with, even from the father of his Rose. His solid face worked, and his grey
  eyes flashed, with the strain he was putting upon himself. If he had spoken
  what was upon his lips, he must have lost his love for ever; so bitter was
  his thought; and so resolute the nature, which it would have outraged. For it
  was upon his lips to say&mdash;"Who are you, to talk of honour? You, who are
  obliged to hide yourself, and dare not even meet my father!"</p>

  <p>But he thought of Rose, just in good time, and said&mdash;"Well, sir,
  perhaps I have been tempted. But I thought it was fair; and I think so
  still."</p>

  <p>"Two words will show you, that it was not fair," Mr. Arthur answered, in a
  much kinder tone; "possibly you thought, that your promise had expired; but
  how was I to know, that you thought so? You were bound to let me know, that
  you would cast off your pledge, instead of doing so, without my knowledge,
  and taking advantage of my ignorance."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of doing such a thing as that," said Jack; "it would have
  been mean, and low, and snobbish. I never dreamed, that any one could judge
  me so."</p>

  <p>"Very likely not. But you see what comes of being your own judge, and
  jury. Good evening, now! I will ask you for no more promises."</p>

  <p>"But it never can be your intention to mean," cried the young man, looking
  as deplorably as he spoke, "that I am to be ordered off your premises,
  altogether!"</p>

  <p>"Not quite so. Let us rather put it thus&mdash;you are not to come, until
  you are invited. And I shall not invite you; until your father wishes it"</p>

  <p>"Very well. You can treat me, as you like, sir. But for all that, I am
  quite resolved to marry your daughter."</p>

  <p>"And I am quite resolved that you shall not; in the present condition of
  things, young man."</p>

  <p>The captain looked sternly at Jack, as he spoke; and Jack looked firmly at
  the captain. Both having strong wills, neither of them said anything more
  than, "Good evening!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39">CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; A WILD-DUCK HUNT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The twilight was now in that interesting stage, with the
  last blush of day fading out of the heavens, when the mystery of the moor is
  grandest, the whisper of tremulous love most thrilling, and the quack of the
  mallard most ecstatic. For this is the moment, when that noble bird, (after
  sleeping the day out, on a breezy pool, or among the deep sedges of a lonely
  water-course,) with slow flaps, and stretches, get out of his bed, and draws
  up his red feet tingling. Then he opens the valves of his nostrils, and
  utters a little sharp snort to his family. With a few strong beats, he is up
  and away, along the crystal bars of light, and the sprinkle of his rise falls
  far behind. The flush of his start has set all the others off; and the
  silvery sound of wings flows back, as the cleft air closes, and the dusk is
  left behind.</p>

  <p>But he, with velocity of instinct, guiding all his race to health and
  food, himself the head of the rapid arrow high above the ups and downs of
  earth, urges his powerful pinions, strains his long neck through the
  whistling air, and sleeks all the plumage of his breast with speed. Until, in
  the stagnant scene below him, he espies the little place, he wants to be
  in,&mdash;either a malty-looking barley stubble, or an oasis of fat green
  ooze, or the glistening gem of a lonely pond, chastely enamelled with fat
  black slugs. Here he descends, as the stars begin to blink; makes the circuit
  once, with his family behind him; all peering for the hateful human race.
  Then spying none of that, flop they breast the water, ploughing up less of it
  than could be expected, but flinging it largely behind them, as they dash,
  helter-skelter, through the cataract of their own rapture.</p>

  <p>These are general facts; but the very fine family of ducks, now dealt
  with, conformed very fairly with ancestral usage. Neither was it contrary to
  experience (the race of man, and gun, being equally abundant) that while they
  were rollicking in their first delight, a big gun flamed at them, from forth
  a traitor bush, and five unblemished birds turned their poor toes up; while
  the rest, without halting to lament, took wing.</p>

  <p>"I've gived them pepper," cried the man, who had been doing it: "never
  made a finer shot in all my life. But it don't seem so easy to come at 'em,
  as I thought. Shall have to get wet up to my middle, I'm afeared."</p>

  <p>This was the man, whom Rose had seen afar, following the seam down the
  hill-front. And now he stood gazing at the dusky pool, begirt with peaty
  swamp, and sedge, which the little moorland rills had made. There were his
  victims, far out of reach, and not to be pelted to the other side with
  stones, even if stones had been at hand; neither was there any wind, to drive
  them ashore. He doubted for a moment, whether he should leave them so, and
  return in the morning, with a dog to fetch them out. But his home was some
  miles away; and he determined, at any rate to have a try for it. "Dare say,
  it ain't so very deep after all," he muttered to himself contemptuously;
  "I'll pull off my togs, and go in for 'em."</p>

  <p>Raiment was not very plentiful with him; so he carefully laid what would
  spoil, upon a rock; then he drew the stout ramrod from his gun, to probe the
  depth before him, and stepped in bravely. At first, the swamp was shallow,
  scarcely taking him knee-deep; and beginning to laugh at his own misgivings,
  he waded with his ramrod swinging. Then suddenly, down he went, over head and
  ears, not in clear water, but in black quagmire, floundering, and flapping,
  like a fly in beer and treacle. His mouth was filed with sludge, and his eyes
  dabbed up with slough-crust; and his arms could scarcely move, among the
  clog, and clam, they battled with. The harder he fought, the worse he fared;
  he could not even tell what way to strike for; everything turned black above
  him, and his breath went into gurgles.</p>

  <p>But just as he was disappearing softly, with only his grey hair left
  behind, a stout crook of ground ash came into his woollen shirt, and his body
  was hauled out. John Westcombe, on his way to fetch the pony, had heard the
  gunshot, and seen the distant flash, and set off as hard as his legs would
  go, to catch the poacher on his father's beat. He knew the spot well; for it
  was the very one, to which he had followed another flight of ducks, when he
  parted from the general on the moor; and he was just in time to rush into the
  swamp, and keeping on the brink of peat, haul out the poor fellow, at his
  last gasp. Strong as he was, and self-possessed, Jack had as much as he could
  do, to fetch out his burden through the inky slush, and then through the
  tangle of the swampy margin, without drowning him; if indeed that still
  remained to do. But the young man, as soon as he got a firm grasp, lifted his
  load; and the black slime from it trickled among the light green
  water-grass.</p>

  <p>"You must do your very best to breathe," said Jack, who had never read
  directions to revive drowned persons; "let me wash the dirt off first; and
  then you won't have to swallow it. You will get on very nicely, if you don't
  think about it. I heard him breathe! Now try again, sir; and you shall have a
  doctor, if you go on well."</p>

  <p>The poor man could not even lift his chest against it; though the helpless
  droop of his neck showed plainly, that he knew what he was threatened with.
  "Very well," said Jack, who was quick of observation, "if you will come
  round, you shall not have him. I will see to you myself; and I am not a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>What sweeter speech can be made to any man, whose spirit is hovering, just
  conscious of the horrors, it may prefer to leave behind?</p>

  <p>With a spirit of recovery, this man drew breath; his nostrils quivered
  with consolation, and the numb little spring of his heart began to give a
  weak jog, to go on again. Young Westcombe did to him exactly, what he thought
  he himself would have wanted, in the like condition; and, by-and-by, the man
  sat up, and sneezed, and appeared to seek about for refreshment. "Spirits
  have I none," said Jack; " but if you could manage a little drop of old
  Madeira, diluted largely&mdash;or to speak more plainly, mixed with good
  spring-water&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had too much water a'ready," said the man; "and Mydeary wine never goeth
  well with it."</p>

  <p>"Then have it, as it is," advised John Westcombe. The man took his advice,
  and left a rueful hollow in the shooting-flask, for Jack to go home upon,
  without a bit of dinner.</p>

  <p>"That have done me real good. Never thought to taste no more of such. I
  knows the very farm where that was growed."</p>

  <p>Westcombe was surprised at this, and thought that the poor man's wits were
  still abroad. But looking at him keenly, in the clear mellow light of the
  harvest moon, which had now risen grandly, he perceived, on his bare breast
  and arms, the tokens of a wandering, outlandish life. There was a deep
  tattooing, in various tints; a heart done in red, where the weak heart beat
  below; and a chain of little charms, clotted in a lump with mire.</p>

  <p>"Let me get my togs on," said the man, looking up at him; "my legs feels,
  as if they were somebody else's. I must go, and have a wash first. You may
  trust me, not to run away, sir."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of your running away. Why should you want to run away, my
  friend? Do you suppose, that I want to apprehend you?"</p>

  <p>"Bah! I know, well enough, what you swells be," said the other, refusing
  Jack's hand to help him up, although his legs were shaking, and his teeth
  upon the chatter; "you come to nab me, and nab me you have; and a good job
  for me, in one way. Think, I don't know you, Squire Westcombe? But I won't
  make no resistance, sir, after what you have done to me."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, my friend, that you must be a fool, if you think that I want
  to punish you. My father never makes a fuss about the wild-ducks. My father
  is the best man in all the world. And I quite agree with him, in that. Why,
  even if I had caught you netting grouse, or partridges; I should never take
  advantage of you, in this condition. You shall not only go home, as you
  please, but you shall take your ducks with you, if I can get them. You are a
  plucky fellow, and you deserve them; and I will not even ask you, what your
  name is. Now, get your clothes on, and finish up the wine; which you
  understand, better than I do. If you had been worthy to be called a poacher,
  you would have known how to get those ducks out."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the man, as he went to wash and dress himself; "it is
  the first time I have tried here. Though I never would have told you so, if
  you had persecuted." John Westcombe very easily laid hand upon the
  wild-ducks, by going round the pool, and wading in, from the opposite bank,
  where the ground was firm enough. Then he brought them back, and gave them to
  the gunner, who expected to see him march off with them.</p>

  <p>"You have done me a real good turn;" he said, thinking more of this
  kindness, so far as could be judged, than of Westcombe's gallant act in
  saving him; "and very few now ever does me a good turn. If it lies in my
  power, sir&mdash;and I believe it do&mdash;you shall have a good return for
  it. Mean to tell me, that you don't know, who I be?"</p>

  <p>"I give you my word," answered Jack, with a smile, "that you may be the
  man in the moon, for all I know. Only, I don't suppose he is such a good
  shot."</p>

  <p>This compliment pleased the man, almost as much as anything; and his surly
  manner, which had long been yielding, gave way altogether; as he sat upon a
  big lump of granite, and spoke with a sad deep tone.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, who I am, Squire Westcombe, then. My name is 'Gruff
  Howell,' they call me mostly; and I keep the old inn, by the mines, the
  <i>Raven.</i> I have often seen you pass, sir, both on horseback, and afoot;
  and the moor-men told me who you was. Happen to be a dinner-party, ordered to
  our house, next Friday, of some sharp blades, not too partiklar, how their
  victuals come, so long as they be good. They made a great cue about ducks;
  there must be two ducks to each end of the table, and Captain Lark's
  marrowfats, to go with them. Well, sir, we put up the ducks with barley-meal,
  and settled the very day to stick them, when down come old Reynard, and his
  vixen, from the tor, with a starving lot of little ones waiting for them; and
  away goes our four fat ducks, in a winking. I heard a tremendous quack-quack,
  in the night, and out of bed I jumped, with this here gun; but I might as
  well have fired at the moon, or the comet. So I made up my mind to get some
  wild-ducks instead; for they would set the house on fire, if I crossed them;
  and the valleys led me on, till I got here."</p>

  <p>"You must have got a capital gun," said Jack; "to kill these five ducks so
  clean, at forty yards. It is more than any gun of ours would do."</p>

  <p>"I picked her up in Spain, sir; she is of Spanish make. She will put a
  shot through a slate, at fifty yards, sir; and that is more than any English
  gun will do."</p>

  <p>"But, when were you in Spain? You are shivering, you are cold. You have
  been in the tropics, I dare say, too. You are still wet underneath. If you
  stand about like this, the night-air from the hills will pretty nearly make
  an end of you. Come along; stir up; I will help you homeward."</p>

  <p>Gruff Howell was getting very stiff by this time; as a man of three score
  years and ten deserved to be, after going through so much of long walking,
  and waiting, with his eyes upon the stretch, and then falling into mire, and
  being dragged out, and spread to dry by moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you are wonderfully good," he said; "but I can get home well enough;
  or sleep in a furze-bush, this fine weather. In the old days, I have had many
  a worse bed, and got up sprightly in the morning. I have been through more,
  than ever you could have stood, sir; strong as you are, but not brought up to
  it."</p>

  <p>"I dare say. But you are not very young now. And I have often heard my
  father say, that men, who have been in hot climates long, are upset
  altogether by the night-air, on these hills. I shall see you on your road,
  till I am sure that you are safe. How far is it to the <i>Raven</i>? I should
  say, at a guess, at least five miles."</p>

  <p>"Better than that, sir; and all rough walking. But the moon is good, and I
  know my way. You have got many miles to go home to-night; and you are wet to
  the skin, and young men gets consumption. Not another step shall you come,
  with me: as if I was an old woman gone astray. And to tell you the truth,
  'twould do me more harm than good, and stop me from doing any good to you.
  There is a pair of sharp eyes aspying on me always. But I would like dearly,
  to have a talk with you; and might be important to you to hear it. When could
  you make it handiest, to give me a meeting somewhere? Somewhere out upon the
  moor, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Any day, and any time you like," Jack answered; "to-morrow, if it suits
  you; or perhaps the day after. I want to go to Tavistock to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, let me think. To-day is Wednesday. Friday, my dinner is to be,
  or supper, or whatever they may call it. Would Saturday suit you, to meet me
  somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, as well as any day; or best of all, I might say; because I am coming
  towards you that day, for a quiet little bit of shooting. I am coming all
  alone, and will call upon you, if you like, at your own place, the
  <i>Raven.</i> Or if you like it better, I will meet you somewhere."</p>

  <p>"It would never do, for you to come near our house, sir; or at least not
  to stop there, for any time of talk. But you know the Island Rocks, of
  course. Would your shooting bring you round that way, about three, or four
  o'clock, on Saturday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I might easily manage it so. I am very fond of that wild place.
  There are widgeon, or teal there, very often. But it is a long way from your
  house. Bring your Spanish cannon, Howell."</p>

  <p>"That I will, sir, with your leave; for I might want her, for
  self-defence. It is a long way from our place, surely; but so much the better
  for that, to my thinking. The men as comes to our place now, if they was to
  see me talking to you, would take me by the scruff of the neck, and pitch me
  down the old mine-shaft, at road-end. But the crest of the hill is no place
  for talking. Good-bye, sir, till Saturday."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch40"
     id="ch40">CHAPTER XL. &mdash; THE NOBLEST MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I call it too bad of them all, Uncle John," said Julia
  Touchwood, that same day, "to run away, and leave us <i>tête-à-tête,</i> like
  this. If they go on so, I shall run away to-morrow, and have an intellectual
  combat with poor Dicky; or go, and nurse the general&mdash;a dangerous, but
  interesting task; because he will want to swear so dreadfully, yet dare not,
  in my presence; and I shall drive him to the very verge of suppressed
  insanity, by sweet ministrations, of the most irksome order. Ah, it would be
  capital fun! His face is such a study; when his lips are burning for a good
  round something, and his eyes rolling sadly, at the fair sex in the
  room."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry him, my dear?" asked Colonel Westcombe; "you might
  always enjoy that fine sight then."</p>

  <p>"Alas no, dear uncle! Where is your knowledge of mankind? How lavishly,
  how rapturously, would he swear before his wife; and at her too, before three
  days were over!"</p>

  <p>"Julia, in spite of all your attractions, you will have to put up with an
  old man, I do believe. Your turn of mind is too sarcastic, too uncharitable,
  for young men to be pleased with you. They like something softer, something
  sweeter-natured, something more confiding, and simple, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And sawny. Very well; they may like what they please&mdash;somebody with
  as much brains as themselves. I shall not break my heart for them, Uncle
  John. If the worst comes to the worst, I shall have old Mr. Short; I can do
  that, by holding up my finger any day. He is the only one I get the worst of;
  when it comes to a chaffing-match. And after all, matrimony comes to that. I
  have no faith in love, or spoony doings, or the heart. The heart is corrupt,
  and desperately wicked; according to inspired authority. Then what is the
  good of it? I don't want it; I would rather have a man, with mind, and body,
  that I must look up to, than a lot of stupid hearts. If Mr. Short's head was
  at the top of his hat, I would have him to-morrow; to spite every one, and to
  rout out that spiteful old Aggett, who insulted me. Don't suppose that I am
  excited, Uncle John; I am not; I never am; and I never mean to be. Now you
  can tell me, what you think."</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," said Colonel Westcombe, after looking about a bit, and
  admiring Julia's flashing eyes, which seemed almost to light up the room,
  where they sat in the twilight, with the cloth removed; "you must remember
  that I am quite old-fashioned; that I never have been, what is called a
  'ladies' man,' nor even accustomed to smart society; because I was poor; and
  poor people are stupid&mdash;as to worldly views, at least. You may be quite
  right, as among rich people, in describing marriage as a 'chaffing-match;'
  and, if so, it is desirable, of course, that the husband should be the best
  hand at it; so that he may be looked up to. But my view of the question is
  widely different. I will not trouble you with it."</p>

  <p>"Why not, Uncle John?" She spoke in a soft low voice, and did not look at
  him; for tears were lurking in her proud bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Because, my dear, it would do no good. Your nature in many ways is noble,
  Julia; but too fiery, and not at all submissive. If you ever marry, as I
  heartily hope that you will do&mdash;and you have years yet, to consider
  it&mdash;you ought to have some one, as quick of mind as you are; but
  possessing far more self-command."</p>

  <p>"I get it from my mother. I can't help it. I know that I am peppery, and
  contemptuous. But, oh, Uncle John, how I could adore a man like you, for
  instance!"</p>

  <p>"My dear, you may find a thousand men, of far finer character, than mine
  ever was; and I find myself growing sadly selfish now. I heartily hope, that
  you may find one, to suit you, appreciate you, and&mdash;and&mdash;well I
  will say it&mdash;peg you down; as anybody must, to live happily with you.
  Mind, I only mean, at first. After that, you would go on well."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Uncle John, for that reprieve. How my self-knowledge is
  enlarged! If it ever comes to pass, and I am bullied horribly, I shall cry
  out, on the funeral pyre, 'O Uncle John!' with a loud voice thrice; as the
  Eastern king did, with the torches under him. And then, will you come, and
  unbind me?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I do not, at the present moment, recall the situation, to which
  you refer. I suppose it is in the <i>Arabian Nights.</i> And that reminds me
  of story-telling. Your mind is a little excited, for the moment; and I have
  said harsh things to you. Instead of going up, and dwelling upon them, would
  you like to hear me tell the story, for which you have so often begged, of
  the noblest man I ever knew?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you will only tell me that&mdash;and it is the very time for it.
  If he only underwent reproach like me?"</p>

  <p>"That he did, Julia. And without deserving it. To screen another from
  rebuke, and shame. It was one of the saddest things I ever knew; and I have
  met with many sad ones. But you must allow me not to mention names, or at any
  rate only Christian names; for reasons, which&mdash;which are binding still.
  And you must not speak of it lightly; because it would pain me greatly, if
  you did so."</p>

  <p>"Much as I may want pegging down, Uncle John; I should want it still more,
  if I could do such a thing. Sit in this comfortable chair, and then
  begin."</p>

  <p>"No, I will sit just where I am. Whenever I go back to those old times, I
  am ashamed of my present luxury. But come you, and rest here, my dear child;
  because my voice is not always clear. Now, are you ready? Then please not to
  interrupt me, because it throws out my memory; and I have not told that
  story, for a long time now.</p>

  <p>"After the battle of Talavera, which was a very hard-fought field, and by
  no means decisive, the British army, and I may say the whole Peninsular
  cause, was in the greatest jeopardy, for several days. Our force was small;
  we had lost a great many of our very best troops, in the two days of combat;
  we had no clear knowledge of the position, strength, or intentions of the
  enemy; we could not trust the Spanish general, to act in concert with us, or
  even to keep us informed of his movements; the French were in far superior
  force, both in front, and in our rear; we were hemmed in the narrow valley of
  the Tagus, between a rapid river, and trackless mountains; worst of all
  perhaps, or at any rate most depressing, we could count one another's bones
  with famine. For an entire month, we did not receive so much as ten full
  rations. The Spaniards did the feeding, and left us to do the fighting. Their
  men were like dripping-pans; ours like gridirons. You may suppose, what our
  condition was, when I tell you, my dear Julia, that the offal of a goat,
  rank, leathery, reeking, would sell for as much as my best sheep is worth;
  and that I have seen dainty young officers, who would turn up their noses at
  cold meat in England, chase the gaunt swine in the forest, and devour the
  flesh, with the bristles on, raw, and quivering. Spanish ham raw, and without
  any garlic&mdash;and the Spaniards, whose place it was to supply us, even
  accused us of theft for this!</p>

  <p>"What with anxiety, weariness, and famine, we were all very miserable, as
  you may suppose; many of our best friends lay dead, or wounded&mdash;I myself
  had lost a beloved schoolfellow, as brave a young fellow as ever breathed, in
  that terrible charge of the 23rd&mdash;; we expected the French to fall upon
  us, in overwhelming numbers; and as yet, we had not that implicit confidence
  in our great commander, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, which afterwards made us
  so irresistible. The wisest of us thought, that the whole scheme of the
  campaign was wrong (as is now confessed freely), enforced upon our general,
  perhaps by the politics of the day. While the more foolish of us (who were a
  thousand times as many, naturally) were convinced, by starvation, that the
  object of the patriotic Spaniards was, to destroy us also. They could not
  bear to see us upon their land; although we were there to defend it. And the
  more of us died&mdash;instead of themselves&mdash;the better they enjoyed
  it.</p>

  <p>"I may be narrow-minded, and an unfair witness; but nine out of ten of us
  say the same. Many a time we longed for a good charge, into the centre of the
  Spanish army; if it deserved to be called an army. But we got to respect the
  French, and like them; they are not hidalgoes, but gentlemen; and every bit
  as brave as our own fellows. If they had been led, as well as we were, with
  one head present over them, instead of a lot of jealous marshals,
  countermarching one another, we should have left our bones behind in 1809:
  for we were not many, and the few we had were starved.</p>

  <p>"However, I am rambling into big questions, instead of going through with
  my little one. When we retired, after Talavera, leaving our sick and wounded
  there, to the care of the Spaniards, who deserted them; nothing but a bold
  stroke on the part of our commander, and the remissness of Napoleon's
  puppet-king, preserved us. Sir Arthur crossed the Tagus, just in time, by the
  bridge of Arzobispo; and then it became of vital import to seize the bridge
  of Almaraz, lower down; by which our retreat might be intercepted. To make
  sure of this momentous point, a force of light cavalry was sent in advance,
  with all possible despatch. And the first, to arrive at the bridge, were the
  same Hussars, of whom I spoke before; most dashing, impetuous, reckless
  fellows.</p>

  <p>"The night was very sultry, and unusually dark, darker than I have ever
  known a summer night in England; and I suppose that is quite natural. We, the
  main body of the army, were eight, or ten miles, higher up the river,
  labouring along with the lame-horsed guns, and places where no horse could
  drag them up. Then the black night fell upon us; and we boiled our empty
  kettles. Men, who have marched far, with nothing in their stomachs, fall into
  a jog-trot sort of resignation, a weary trust in Providence, that having had
  the bad side, they ought to find the good one turning up. I remember the
  night quite well, because I had never been so lame in all my life; and I went
  down to the Tagus, where a little brook ran in, from a place they call the
  'Meza d'Ibor;' and though I could not spare the time to bathe, because
  somebody else would have gobbled up my supper, I soaked my hot feet in the
  cool mountain water, and from limping, was able to jump again. For all of us,
  officers as well as men, had taken a strong pull at the guns that day.</p>

  <p>"I assure you that we were more full of fatigue, than of anything else, to
  sleep upon; for a quarter of a pound of unground wheat was all the bread we
  had for supper; and the meat was an ounce of goat's flesh. We were thankful,
  we enjoyed it, and we tried to spare some, for our friends with weaker
  appetites, who had taken the fever, or been wounded. But there was a heavy
  feeling in the air around us; and the night, that came over, seemed to lie
  upon our bodies, instead of drawing round us, like a curtain.</p>

  <p>"The insects were enough to eat us up; the heavier the air is, the harder
  they do labour. There is a fearful creature there, with a saw in his head,
  like a prawn's; and in his tail, a gimblet, with a fir-cone structure to it.
  When a weary man is fast asleep, this fellow takes his stand, in some
  sensitive part of the system, where he can find a little eminence of the
  surface, not far from an equal depression. Then he spreads his legs, like a
  painter's trestle, and works his head-saw through the hill before him, while
  he screws the cutting worm of his tail-gimblet, into the valley behind him.
  And the worst of it is, that you never can catch him.</p>

  <p>"In spite of all our weariness, these, and other plagues, allowed us
  scarcely a good wink of sleep; and we distinctly heard trumpets, miles away,
  and the sound of small arms, carried to us, by the peculiar condition of the
  night, and the formation of the hills around us. We were puzzled; for we
  thought that the French could not be there; but none could ever say where the
  Spaniards might be; for their great delight was, to keep us in the dark about
  it</p>

  <p>"We marched very slowly, on the following day, down the left bank of the
  Tagus; the weather being most oppressive, the track very difficult, and our
  horses broken down. But when we arrived, on the evening after that, opposite
  the boat-bridge at Almaraz (which had been so important to us), we saw a very
  sad, and moving scene, which will never quit my memory. In a bend of the
  river, where the setting sun threw shadows on the yellow ground it had
  scorched up, a firing-party was taking position; and before them stood a
  British officer.</p>

  <p>"I had never seen a thing of that kind yet; neither had those around me;
  but we knew, as if by instinct, what it was, and we drew aside, and trembled.
  The verdict of court-martial was being read aloud, and we heard the
  words&mdash;'cowardice, and treachery, in the presence of the enemy;' and the
  sentence&mdash;'death.'</p>

  <p>"There stood a group of officers, illustrious now throughout Europe, as
  long as any history shall last; the commander-in-chief, looking stern as the
  rocks; and a part of the celebrated Light Division, drawn up like a wall, and
  as mute, and still. But the faces of many of the men were working; for they
  loved the man they were to slay.</p>

  <p>"He stood calmly looking at them, as firm as I am now, and a great deal
  firmer; and he even seemed to smile, at such a fuss about his life. He was
  asked, if he had anything to say, and he said&mdash;'Nothing.' And then with
  a stately step he went, and took his place, where the distance had been
  measured, and stood with his hands at his side, his heels together, and his
  broad chest expanded, for the bullets. I saw him, with the sunset on his
  face, and knew him&mdash;the man who had saved my life&mdash;the bravest man
  I had ever met with.</p>

  <p>"The guns were levelled at him, he was opening his lips to say 'Fire!' as
  he had claimed the right to do,&mdash;when, swifter than a flash of steel, a
  man leaped before the muzzles, turned round, and cried&mdash;'Shoot me, shoot
  me! I did it all. He knew nothing of it. Shoot me; if you must shoot any
  one.'</p>

  <p>"It was the mere click of a trigger, that both of them were not shot
  together. The general held his hand up; the men dropped their muskets; the
  two, in such peril, stood side by side, each challenging the death-shot. In a
  moment, it was known that they were brothers, and a buzz of wonder broke the
  awful silence. Before we could see any more of them, they were both under
  guard, by Sir Arthur's orders, for the further consideration of their
  case.</p>

  <p>"Now the story is a strange one; yet not to be doubted, in the face of all
  the evidence. These two brothers were of very good birth, and a family
  well-known in England. Well-known, not only for their property, and lineage,
  but also for their strong peculiarities. It was said, that they never
  thought, as other people thought; and never even acted upon what they
  thought, as others would have done, who thought so. And this seems to have
  shown itself, in the actions of these two, which I have not been able at all
  to understand, up to the present moment. And my good friend, General
  Punk&mdash;though he will not confess it&mdash;is no wiser.</p>

  <p>"However, I can tell you, that these two brothers, Philip, and Lewis, were
  in the same regiment of Hussars, attached to the Light Division, of which you
  have heard me speak before. A fashionable, and a proud regiment it was,
  famous for discipline, dash, and daring. Lewis, the younger brother, had been
  with it some time, and was exceedingly popular, both with the men and his
  brother-officers, though considered rather odd, and romantic in his views. He
  was given to roving among the woods, whenever he could get the opportunity,
  and was always collecting plants and mosses; which of course he had to leave
  behind him. His colonel had called him to order, once or twice, for habits
  rather unsoldierlike; but the knowledge of the country, which he obtained,
  had more than once proved useful; he brought many welcome contributions to
  the mess, such as fish, fruit, truffles, &amp;c.; and above all there was no
  calmer head, no stronger hand, no bolder heart than his, in the charge, the
  surprise, or the rally.</p>

  <p>"The elder brother, Philip, had only joined quite lately, exchanging from
  some other regiment: and there had not been time, to know much about him yet;
  except that he was very different from his brother Lewis, in everything,
  except appearance. In person, the brothers resembled one another, like twins;
  though I believe, there were three or four years between them. But Lewis had
  been exposed to climate, and hardship; while his brother, the
  viscount&mdash;for he was that by courtesy&mdash;had been living at home, in
  luxury. But they were not like twins, in anything, except the outward form, I
  do believe. For instance, there was no especial love between them; they
  avoided one another, when they could well do so; and seemed to have widely
  different tastes.</p>

  <p>"All this came out afterwards, as you must know; for no especial heed of
  them was taken, with so many great events around us. Neither would we have
  heard that much about them, except for the extraordinary upshot of the case.
  We had plenty of young noblemen, and heirs to titles, headed off, like
  poppies, when the French struck straight. But the oddness of this thing, and
  the contradiction of opinion, made us notice it. And I tell you, Julia, that
  I was only too glad, to have been out of the way when it happened; because I
  should not have known what to say, if they had called upon me for
  evidence.</p>

  <p>"The night had been very dark; all agreed to that; and we had found it so,
  a few leagues higher up the river. A very close, and heavy cloud, fell over
  all the land; without any mist or dew (which help to carry light, they say),
  and without a flash of lightning, to enliven it. Those Hussars, or rather a
  detachment of them, not more than a hundred and fifty sabres, under urgent
  orders of despatch, rode into the black pine-wood, between the mountains and
  the river-bank. I was told by one of them (quite a boy, who died gallantly in
  action at the Coa, next year) that they could hardly see their hands, before
  their faces, in the depth of that pitchy pine-wood; and but for that officer,
  who seemed to know every stick of it, they never could have found their way
  to the rickety boat-bridge. There they dismounted, sent fifty of their number
  across, saw to their horses, and sat down, by the black streak of the river,
  to their scanty, hot, dry rations.</p>

  <p>"Now, hereupon hangs the whole gist of the question, so far as there can
  be any question, where a man not only pleads guilty, but is the absolute
  witness against himself. Did the younger brother, Lewis&mdash;who was the
  senior officer, you must understand, and in command of the detachment, with
  his elder brother under him&mdash;did he cross the boat-bridge, as he should
  have done&mdash;for the danger was upon the other side, if any&mdash;or did
  he, as he himself declared, send his brother across, and remain with the main
  body? The night was so dark, and the brothers so alike, in figure, stature,
  dress, walk, and gesture, that the story must be left between themselves.</p>

  <p>"That night, the most marvellous disgrace that ever befell a fine
  regiment, befell those Hussars. They were terrified, where no fear was; they
  were stricken with a panic, they were scared out of their lives, or rather of
  their wits; for they never thought twice of their lives in the matter, I do
  believe. At any rate, off they went, helter-skelter, with what the French
  call a <i>sauve qui peut,</i> every man jumping on the first horse he could
  catch, and tearing away, as if the devil tore behind him.</p>

  <p>"In the morning, the bridge was wide open for the French, and the still
  more important ford below; and if they only had Napoleon with them, or even
  Soult unthwarted, not a British soldier, who fought at Talavera, would have
  told the tale, except in a French prison. The two best troops of the best
  British horse, that ever struck stirrup, or drew sabre, were leagues away on
  the road to Deleytoza, and came back at noonday; with even their horses
  hanging their tails, like a dog to be thrashed.</p>

  <p>"It is said, that in the blackest hour of that black night, when these
  brave men lay sleeping&mdash;except the outpost across the
  river&mdash;sleeping the heavy sleep of men deadly weary, and with nothing on
  their stomachs to make them dream,&mdash;a fear came through the air around
  them, a shudder, without voice or sound, a terror of the spirit, and a
  trembling of the flesh.</p>

  <p>"All at once, it seized them, asleep or waking, lying on their backs, or
  sitting up against a tree, thanking the Lord for being still alive, or
  swearing at the insects, for knowing it; whatever they were doing, who ever
  they were, howsoever they strove to man themselves,&mdash;a black fear came
  into the marrow of their hearts; man breathed it into man, horse into horse;
  and not one of them stayed there, to cough, or to snort.</p>

  <p>"Their friends, across the river, took the panic at a back-stroke. Like
  frogs on the leap, they sprang over the bridge, caught their horses, and
  clung to their necks, while they spurred them, anyhow, anywhere, anyway, to
  be out of that black devilish wood. Three, or four, were killed against the
  branches; the others caught the main lot, and added to their terror. Bridles
  were not dreamed of, all was spur, and lie-along, and horses' throats were
  knocked up by the heels of horses. 'The devil take the hindmost' was the only
  cue, among as brave a lot of men, as ever feared the Lord.</p>

  <p>"One man alone remained behind; an officer, who had not shared the panic,
  but could no more stop it, in the dark, than you or I could make a rabid dog
  sit up, and beg. This was the officer, who had crossed the river; that is
  admitted beyond all doubt, and shown by a curious circumstance, which I shall
  remember by and by, perhaps. The brother in command (the senior in the
  regiment, though the younger by birth) should have certainly done this;
  because that was the side where the attack would be. However it appears, from
  his own statement, that the elder brother, Philip, was the brave one. The
  younger brother was the cause of all the shame; which was clearly shown to
  have begun with the officer, who remained in command, on our own side of the
  Tagus.</p>

  <p>"The rest of the story, my dear Julia, goes into a very few words; and I
  am sure, I owe you many thanks, for having listened to so long a tale, with
  so much patience. Our great commander, after sifting all the facts, so far as
  the hurry of the time permitted, referred the matter home; for the sentence
  of court-martial, confirmed by himself, could not be set aside lightly.
  Home-influence was brought to bear, no doubt; for the father of the two young
  men stood high with the government, and had a special hold, it was said, upon
  His Royal Highness. How that may have been, I cannot say; but such things
  never seem to fail of their due weight. The upshot of it was that the
  'Headlong Hussars,' (as we called them, until they redeemed their disgrace,
  by dying, almost to a man, in battle) lost both the officers of that great
  night-scare. The younger was cashiered; and the elder threw up his
  commission, with applause, having acted nobly, and saved his poor brother, at
  the risk of his own life."</p>

  <p>"But, Uncle John," cried Julia Touchwood, who had listened most
  attentively to that long story; "you know best, of course, because you were
  there, and saw it all; which makes all the difference; but for my part I see
  nothing wonderfully noble, in a man jumping suddenly before a lot of guns, to
  save his own brother from their contents. Why, I would have done as much as
  that, for Dicky. You may think I am boasting; and perhaps I am. But I feel
  sure, that I could do that much."</p>

  <p>"So do I. I know you would," Colonel Westcombe answered quietly; "in
  moments of excitement, we think nothing of our lives. The noble action was
  not that. The nobility was, that a nobleman should take upon himself, for the
  sake of a younger brother, the shame of arrant cowardice, and
  treachery&mdash;for that was charged, and supposed to be proven&mdash;the
  ruin to his life, the contempt for ever, the scorn of his regiment, his
  relatives, and country. He was a man of the world; he knew it; he knew that
  he would blast all his young life to the root; yet he faced it all&mdash;to
  save his brother."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know something, as to what he had been;" said the
  sceptical Julia, as if to herself; "I mean, before he went out to Spain.
  Whether he had shown himself so very noble then; or whether he had been
  loose, and slippery. You knew, what his brother was; but nothing about
  him."</p>

  <p>"But my dear child, these were the facts, according to his own confession
  of them. It is a maxim of law, which I have heard at petty
  sessions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care that," she answered, snapping her long, strong, tapering
  forefinger&mdash;"for the maxims of the laws, even of the Medes and Persians;
  which were the only laws, worth having, because even bribery could not change
  them. My plan is, to judge people, by their nature; in accordance with their
  acts, and their characters, and looks. And I say that the man, who had proved
  himself thoroughly brave, in a thousand perils, could not have run away,
  could never have given the shameful order to run away, and would have stuck
  to the bridge of boats for ever; till Spanish starvation made him drop
  between them."</p>

  <p>"But suppose that he was bribed, my dear; or had some other crooked
  motive. Something of the sort seemed to be implied, in some side words,
  or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Uncle John, I am quite ashamed of you. A man who saved your life, and
  stood to be shot at, as well as even you could do!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it is mean, shabby, low, and nasty of my mind, to be crossed with
  such vile ideas. And it never could have happened to me, but for the quantity
  of the world, that I have seen."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch41"
     id="ch41">CHAPTER XLI. &mdash; DULY EXECUTED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At this very time, there was going on in London that sad,
  but inevitable work of nature, the death of an old, and once powerful man. A
  breath of great heat had gone into the town, crossing the Thames from
  light-soiled hills, and commons, where fern and furze were dead with fire.
  Great heat, and great cold, especially the latter, have to repeat their onset
  long, before they get into those brick and stone bowels; but once let them
  get in, and they have their revenge. There are forests, that no brief storm
  can enter. The still mass of air within them walls out momentary impact; but
  when it once yields to persistent pressure, the fury of the baffled wind is
  greater, than on the open plains outside. So now, in this great September
  heat, London was a living furnace. Mrs. Giblets, and her daughter Mary,
  accustomed to fine country air, and even Mr. and Mrs. Snacks, and baby
  Snacks, lay prostrate.</p>

  <p>At the great house, within the old ivied walls, a special batch of hot air
  settled down; so that the crusty bricks were like a baker's, the windows like
  oven-doors, the grass-plots cracked as wide as a frog-jump, and the elms
  crisped off, with leaves as brown as the wares of a London greengrocer. The
  people inside, with true urban wisdom, threw all the windows open, thus
  sucking in (to cool themselves) air thirty degrees hotter than that of the
  house. So that the big house, which might have stood a siege of a week's
  heat, with the port-holes down, was as hot, in a day, as the heat
  outside.</p>

  <p>When this had gone on for three days, with a blazing sun, and hazy nights,
  that nursed the sun's work, till he came back; when every slate was like a
  fire-tile, and every window-sill a hearth-stone, and an egg might reasonably
  have been roasted on the wood-work of the frames; it happened that the last
  room in the house, that contained any cool air, lost it. This was the largest
  room of all, the ball-room of the younger days, now made into two, by a great
  black screen, for the sick lord to sit, and to sleep in. The door, a double
  one, with heavy purple hangings, faced the head of the broad old staircase,
  which was made of chestnut wood, with steps of only two-inch rise; for the
  ancestors of our present builders considered ladies' ankles, and their
  lovers' tightened knees.</p>

  <p>Now, in the depth of this hot dark night, when the doors were thrown open,
  with a needless weight to stop them, and not even a window-blind had the life
  to rustle, at the head of the stairs, a loud voice cried&mdash;"Lewis, Lewis,
  my son Lewis!"</p>

  <p>The deep hollow sound, and the loneliness of it, frightened every
  weltering heart at first; and they whispered in the darkness&mdash;"it is no
  concern of mine." But the housekeeper, Mrs. Tubbs, to set a good example,
  ordered back her trembles, and came out. She was dressed very nicely&mdash;as
  she always liked to be&mdash;and had not even put her night-cap on, for bed
  was the hottest place of all (she said), but was dozing in a stamped leather
  chair, and dreaming, in her chintz "pegnor," of the absent Captain Tubbs.
  With as little fear as she could manage, this brave woman stole to the foot
  of the main staircase, by the light of the night-lamp burning in the hall. At
  the head of the stairs, she beheld a gaunt figure, wrapped in a blue silk
  dressing gown, standing between two white marble statuettes. The effigies
  were of two boys, young boys: and the dying father, who had lost them both,
  was come to spend his last minutes there. The weak breath of his end was
  nigh; but his voice was clear, and his mind was keen, as in days of noblest
  arrogance. In the shadow of the images, he spread one withered hand to
  either, and lamented.</p>

  <p>"One, through wild indulgence, gone; and one, through savage tyranny! Is
  there any one faithful to me? How can I expect it?"</p>

  <p>Then he called, with the pain of great wrong in his heart&mdash;"Lewis,
  Lewis, my son Lewis! If I could see you, before I die!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Tubbs (who was growing rather stout, from dining every
  Sunday with her dear friend, Mrs. Snacks) was working her way up the big
  staircase; for his lordship's despair of any loyalty had touched her, as well
  as the sadness&mdash;so she told the undertaker&mdash;"of him having two
  himages of boys, not grown into any breeches yet; when he might have had two
  live officers, with as much gold lace as a footman; if it hadn't been for his
  own wickedness." Being a woman, she forgot every bit of his wickedness now,
  in his wretchedness.</p>

  <p>"My lord," she said, approaching very carefully, because of the shadows,
  and of his condition; "you were asking for some one faithful to you. I have
  always been that; and have always borne the highest possible character, for
  honesty, integrity, industry, high principle, combined with an eagerness to
  oblige&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then oblige me, by holding your tongue. Oh, Tubbs! Of course it is Tubbs.
  Tubbs, come in here."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship looks very ill indeed," observed the lady, entering the
  large room, with some fear&mdash;for a pair of wax candles were but timid
  ghosts of light&mdash;"let me put on my bonnet, my lord,&mdash;I have no
  fear,&mdash;and run for Sir John, this moment."</p>

  <p>"No, Tubbs; Sir John can do me no more good, nor harm. Thanks to the
  fishmonger, I am dying. He sent no ice. It was Gaston's place to see to it.
  He bribed him not to send it; I am quite sure of that. For he heard Sir John
  say, that heat would kill me. But I will floor him yet; if he will only keep
  away. Where is he? Does he know, that I am up and moving? He generally sticks
  to me, as tight as any horse-leech."</p>

  <p>"He must have heard your lordship's call; but you know what Mr. Gaston is,
  in a thunderstorm. And though I have not heard thunder yet, I saw a bright
  flash of lightning, just before your lordship shouted." Even as she spoke, a
  pale blue current flickered through the gloomy room.</p>

  <p>"I did not call. I was talking to myself. Lightning again! If it would
  only last for two hours, I would fight off death."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tubbs started; for the flash was much nearer, and a long peal of
  thunder rumbled through the house. "That will drive him into the
  coal-cellar," she said; "he has no fear of God, or of Satan; but he can't
  abide a thunderstorm."</p>

  <p>The old man trembling, (not with fear, but weakness,) went to the great
  coved window, facing to the south-east, whence the tempest was approaching.
  "The curtains are too heavy; draw them back; that I may see the night."</p>

  <p>Following his steps, and order, the housekeeper drew the hangings back;
  but of the night there was nothing to be seen, except black distance. Then
  there came a lifting flash, that showed St. Paul's, and the two shot-towers,
  a far away flash upon the Kentish hills.</p>

  <p>"Gaston is a coward," said the earl, as he fell into a chair, and wiped
  his forehead; "the storm is twenty miles away as yet. Tubbs, are you afraid
  of summer lightning?"</p>

  <p>"Not I, my lord. In the very worst of weather, I feels myself under the
  hand of the Lord. Mr. Gaston, you know, has been struck by lightning; and a
  burnt child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tubbs, you shall have a thousand pounds, if you fetch me a lawyer, while
  I sit here alive. Give me my elixir first. Double quantity&mdash;all in the
  bottle. When the cold comes, after the storm, I shall die."</p>

  <p>As the housekeeper hurried down the stairs, she peeped into Mr. Gaston's
  room, which commanded the approach to the old earl's quarters, as well as a
  general survey of the basement. The red-faced man was not there; he had fled
  to the cellarage, under the pantries and kitchen, as the surest refuge from
  the storm. Mrs. Tubbs turned her nose up; for she hated that man, if
  possible, more than she feared him; and then, with feminine insolence, she
  took his best umbrella from the stand, and quitted the premises by the little
  door, where poor Mrs. Snacks had been so unwell.</p>

  <p>There was no rain yet; but flips of reflected lightning, here, there and
  everywhere, shone upon the roadway, or flickered at the corner, or flitted
  behind some big tree, or black house. Mrs. Tubbs went on bravely; of all the
  works of the Lord, she feared man only, finding him to be the only bad one.
  She said this to herself, to make the best of things&mdash;because there were
  no men about, but plenty of the higher works of Providence&mdash;as she
  hastened towards "Amalgamation Villa," the hospitable abode of Mr.
  Snacks.</p>

  <p>That gentleman was up, and wide awake, carefully conning
  share-lists&mdash;for the weather was never too hot for that&mdash;and as
  soon as he had heard the tale, he went for his hat, a writing-case, and a
  double-barrelled pistol; which he loaded, and pocketed, without the knowledge
  of the ladies. "Now, we'll checkmate the red-faced man," he said to Mrs.
  Tubbs, as they set forth together; "no lawyer in the land can draw a better
  will than I can. Ha! here comes the rain, and in earnest too! Take my arm,
  madam; I will keep you dry."</p>

  <p>The old house was shaken to its deep foundations, by the din of rolling
  thunder, and the long windows glared with the fire of the skies; but the old
  earl was sitting, with the leaded lattice open, cherishing the last breath of
  above-ground air. The butler of the house, a very old dependent, had been
  sent up by the housekeeper, before she hurried forth. He was standing by the
  curtain now, overcome with want of courage, flinching from the lightning, and
  the tempest roar outside; flinching even worse, from that which he must soon
  look straight at&mdash;the growth of death before him; and still from habit,
  peering towards the staircase door, in fleshly dread of his bugbear, Mr.
  Gaston.</p>

  <p>"Here I am, my lord," said Mr. Snacks, advancing boldly; "grieved to hear
  how much your lordship has suffered from the recent heat. At last the change
  has come; and I hope, it will benefit your lordship."</p>

  <p>"That is no concern of yours. You are here to draw my will. To what firm
  do you belong?"</p>

  <p>"The long established firm, your lordship, of Snacks, Giblets, Tucker and
  Co. I am the senior partner, William Snacks, entirely at your service."</p>

  <p>"If you were not respectable," said the earl, with his old keen look
  revived&mdash;for he did not like the style of man&mdash;"Tubbs would not
  have called you in. And if you can draw a valid will, it does not matter who
  you are. Now put into legal form what I tell you. 'I, Earl
  Delapole'&mdash;describing me aright&mdash;'leave all that I have to dispose
  of, to my only surviving son, Lewis Arthur, now Viscount Pole, for his
  absolute use, and I appoint him my sole executor, if he be surviving. But, if
  he be dead, I leave all the above to his children, if any; and if none, to
  the right heirs of my lands and titles; appointing in that case as my
  executor, Mr. Thomas Latimer, of the firm of Latimer and Emblin, who have
  long been my solicitors. For legacies, I leave £1,000 to Mrs. Tubbs, my
  housekeeper; to each of my domestic servants £50; and to my agent, George
  Gaston, the pair of felt slippers, which he stole from me, to come skulking
  about my door at night.' Be sure you put that in. Tell me, when you are
  ready."</p>

  <p>Entering into the spirit of the man&mdash;hot and imperious to the
  last&mdash;Snacks, with his writing materials ready, called for a large
  supply of candles. For the play of lightning, round the house, and across the
  open windows, dimmed, and sometimes seemed to quench, the pale and feeble
  light inside. Then with a good many amplifications, and fine sweep of
  verbiage, in the manner of the most accomplished lawyer&mdash;who after
  slaying his slain three times, drags him nine times round the walls&mdash;Mr.
  Snacks discharged his meaning, and comparatively that of the testator
  also.</p>

  <p>"There is no time to waste in words; put it anyhow," said the earl, who
  knew much more of law than his new lawyer. "I have little to dispose of. The
  land is all secured. The chief thing is about executor. Gaston was that; but
  he won't be now. I feel better. It has done me good to discharge this bit of
  business. Snacks, you shall have fifty guineas&mdash;though you are no
  lawyer, any more than I am, and I remember something about you now&mdash;when
  you bring me a receipt for this concern, from Latimer and Emblin. They are to
  keep it dark, you know&mdash;not to write to me about it&mdash;only to see
  that it is valid, and give you a private receipt for it. Now let us have the
  witnesses. Tubbs is no good; Tubbs is a fat legatee&mdash;no allusion to your
  figure, loyal Tubbs. I am not going to die yet; don't you think it. I love
  the lightning; it has set me free. Be off, all of you, as soon as this is
  done with. I shall go to sleep, exactly as I am; give the Devil legal notice,
  that I don't intend to die."</p>

  <p>His lordship was right. After duly executing this last will, and
  testament, he turned over in his chair; and his mind was so relieved, that he
  enjoyed a bowl of ox-tail soup, next morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch42"
     id="ch42">CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; THE ISLAND ROCKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Brisk with air, and sparkling ways, and melodies of water,
  Island Glen, on a sunny day, is a place to sit in patiently. The river,
  breaking through a fissure of the hills, with two dark tors to guard it,
  divides among vast blocks of granite, into myriad gleam, and shade. Standing
  up in scores of tons, the granite scorns the water, as a thing that has come
  to cool its feet, and may dribble below its instep. The water, believing in
  its own business, and heedless of stony contempt, comes on, with a thousand
  checks; but at every check, scattering bright loquacity. The gravity of
  grey-bearded boulders only makes it leap the more, and spread in tumbling
  shelves around them, to meet again in some calm pool.</p>

  <p>In spite of hard rocks, there is brushwood here, and even some leafy
  attempt of trees. Dwarf oak, birch, and alder, nestle, below the brown ravage
  of the upland gales, with the kind encouragement of the stream, across whose
  spray they shed their own. And here, beside the white foam, glisten scarlet
  waves of mountain-ash, a companion cascade of coral.</p>

  <p>Under the largest tree, that lapped the water both with root and branch,
  Gruff Howell sat, with his long gun, waiting for young Squire Westcombe. He
  was thinking of his own sad plight, and the tangle he was stepping into, less
  through love of justice perhaps, than fear of sad injustice. For he knew,
  that not his licence only, but his liberty was imperilled, by the freedoms of
  the outlaws now assembling at the <i>Raven.</i> It behoved him, however, to
  be very wary, in his dealings with that crew; unless he were resigned (which
  as yet, he was not) to contribute, personally, to the nurture of the young
  birds on the ivied crag. Gruff was a resolute man, but owed his life to
  himself, and his native land.</p>

  <p>These reflections had given him pause, and made him regret, in the clear
  sunlight, the gratitude of his moonlight mood. His life had been saved, by
  the courage of another; and he certainly had, for a limited period, felt a
  sort of gratitude. This strange feeling&mdash;the rarest of all our
  sensations, and the most fugitive&mdash;was now beginning to be explained
  away, by the larger logic of the tranquil mind.</p>

  <p>"He pulled me out of a bog, it is true; but why did he do it? Why, to
  please himself. Of course he got wet; but not half so wet as I was. It was a
  wonder that he hooked me; for he never ventured out of his own depth. And
  after all, I had better have gone down, than found things, as they were, when
  I got home. He did not even know who I was&mdash;pooh, pooh! One may make too
  much fuss of things. I am thankful, of course, and all that. But still, I am
  not going out of my way, about it. What I have to consider is, what will be
  most for my own good. And, unless I see my way to something, I am not going
  to put my life in danger. Anybody might have done it. I would have done it
  for him, and never mentioned it. Directly you come to look fairly at it, 'tis
  an accident, not an obligation. It will be very nasty of him, if he thinks I
  owe him anything."</p>

  <p>John Westcombe did not think, that Mr. Howell owed him anything. He was
  not come here, to obtain reward for his little service in saving life; and he
  did not even expect to hear anything to care about. Having been asked to
  come, he came; for the place suited well with his land-falls; and he thought
  to hear some trifle, more to interest, than concern him. With his strong
  light step, he came across the rocks, balancing his gun upon his shoulder;
  while the lemon-coloured setter, having found a retired watering-place, lay
  down in it, and lapped; and with his ears adrip, cherished a pious, but
  futile hope, that his fleas would go floating down the river.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are none the worse, for your wetting," said Westcombe, as soon
  as he descried the other man<i>;</i> "it was a long way to walk home, with
  wet clothes on."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I find myself all the better," the innkeeper answered, with a
  lift of finger half-way towards his cowskin cap; "I had got a bit of a cold
  coming on; but the peat-water seem to have took 'un away."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of that, more than once. No doubt there is some good reason
  for it. The peat-water never is so cold as the river-water, I believe. But
  you asked me to come, about something."</p>

  <p>"So I did, sir; so I did. But a ticklish thing, for me to talk of, and
  requires understanding. Perhaps you have heard of Captain Larks, not far from
  where you pulled me out. He lies to the bottom of it. But least said, soonest
  mended. What concern to you or I, if they put a bullet into him?"</p>

  <p>"It would be a very great concern to me, and to you too&mdash;I should
  hope&mdash;to dream of such an atrocious murder. Speak out, Howell. You had
  better tell me all."</p>

  <p>"My own belief is," said Gruff, quite calmly; "that it isn't the captain
  they are after. What good could he be, to any of them? But I hear them say,
  that he hath a young daughter, a very fine-looking maid indeed; and betwixt
  you and I, sir, excusing my opinion, what they want most is, to get hold of
  missy. However, I better say no more. Least said, soonest mended."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong there;" said Jack, with his eyes so fierce, that Howell
  went further back, under the tree. "Either you will tell me all you know, or
  I will pitch you from this rock into that black hole; and out you don't come
  again, my fine fellow. Tush for your gun&mdash;I will snap it in two."</p>

  <p>He wrenched the man's gun from his hand, as he spoke, and struck his knee
  under the breech, to snap it across the stock; but the man looked at him
  piteously, and did not move.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Westcombe; "I will spare it. I don't want to spoil a
  fine gun, if I can help it. But make up your mind, that I will stand no
  nonsense. I had no right to threaten your life, my man; and I am sorry that I
  did so, for it was a cowardly thing to do. But unless you carry out your
  promise, I will march you to my father's house; and to jail you go, as a
  thieves' accomplice. Make your choice, in one minute, Howell. I am not in a
  mood to be trifled with."</p>

  <p>This was plain enough, without words; but the old man saw, that there was
  room for reason, as the young one recovered self-control.</p>

  <p>"You can march me, wherever you please," he said, as if he must put up
  with tyranny; "because you are a young man and I am an old one; and you are
  twice as big as me. But for all that, you don't get a word out of me; without
  it is by fair means, Squire Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what you call 'fair means.' If you mean bribery,
  you shall have none. Though of course, your behaviour would be borne in mind,
  when the licensing question arises. Else, you will have to quit for certain,
  as a notorious harbourer of thieves. Now make your choice in one minute,
  Griffith Howell."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you leave little choice. But I care not much, what comes of
  it. Nothing but one thing makes me care to stick in that old rats' castle.
  One thing only; and I dare say, nothing will come of it, as usual."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what it is; unless it is a secret." Westcombe looked at him, with
  a kindly heart, for he saw by the glisten of the old man's eyes, that some
  tender feeling moved him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir. Only I was thinking of my son&mdash;a gadabout fellow, the
  same as I have been. But not a bad sort, Squire Westcombe. As fine a nature,
  as the Lord ever made."</p>

  <p>"Let me know something about him;" said Jack, with no pursuit of his own
  ends; but because he had that gift of interest in other people's affairs,
  which made the colonel so popular.</p>

  <p>"It is a long tale, sir; and a sad one. But a better soldier never lived,
  than my son Rees, in the Spanish country. He was in the light cavalry, five
  campaigns; and I followed the army as much for his sake, as to make my
  pickings out of it. Since the penny post came in, they brought me a letter
  from him. And I been in hopes to see him ever since; and if I was driven out,
  from where I be, he might come, and he must go again."</p>

  <p>"You shall not be driven out. I will take care of that," young Westcombe
  answered, as if he were the chairman of the quarter sessions; "all you have
  to do, my friend, is to tell me everything you know. Sooner or later, and
  perhaps very soon, a stop must be put to the lawless doings, that have been
  the disgrace of our neighbourhood. When you talk of danger to Captain Larks,
  and even to&mdash;to the members of his household, you must perceive that
  things are going much too far. Have you thrown in your lot, with such
  miscreants?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. But I have let them creep in round me, and order me out of my
  own house. There was only one at first; and he paid me fair; and came for his
  letters, and all that. There seemed to be no harm. It was no concern of mine,
  to know him from the man in the moon; and so long as he brought no others, I
  put up with it; though I guessed that he was a wild one. It was not my place
  to betray him, was it; though I guessed that he was a bad one?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. You were quite right there. As long as he behaved well on
  your premises, it was no concern of yours. You stood in the position of a
  host to him."</p>

  <p>"So I did, sir; reasonably, and by sound interpretation. But when he began
  to make a feasting place of my poor inn, and bring stolen sheep there, and
  black sheep from the mines to eat them, it was a different pair of shoes. I
  found myself put against the law, and the law put against me, more and more.
  And when I was ordered about, like a slave, and had to be out of bed all
  night, and could not even get my money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that was very bad indeed. The least they could do was to pay upon the
  nail."</p>

  <p>"That they did not, sir. And if I said a word, they would roast me, in
  front of my own joints&mdash;leastwise, what they makes me cook for them. It
  have come to such a pitch, that I can't abide it. Why, what do you think
  their last move is? The craze of the world is free-trade now; and free they
  make with my trade. Every one must have of me everything he likes, pretty
  much at his own figure; and then they come, and clear my till for me. They
  tell me that is the true free-trade. Squire, it is time to put a stop to
  it."</p>

  <p>"It shall be stopped;" Jack Westcombe answered, stamping on the granite,
  as he spoke. "We hold a warrant now against one fellow. General Punk himself
  came with it; because there had been a good many before; but nothing was ever
  done with them. So my father locked it up, till needed; and the general has
  been ill ever since. You might as well throw it into the fire, as to give it
  to the 'police,' to execute. But it is quite new, and it should do something.
  We have found out his right name at last&mdash;'Guy Wenlow;' they had it
  'George' before."</p>

  <p>"For sure now, that made it all wrong," said Howell, with a Welshman's
  nicety in law; "we call him 'the black gentleman;' for a gentleman he must
  have been, some day. You never saw any man so knowing of his vittles; which
  downright proves the gentleman. But who is to catch him, sir? I won't be a
  party to it. Although he has carried on with me, too bad."</p>

  <p>"Howell, I respect your feelings there. Treachery is of all things the
  lowest. You shall not be asked to do anything of that sort, upon your own
  premises. At the same time, you may, in all fairness, tell me what their
  designs are upon Captain Larks. Otherwise, you become a party to them. How
  many of them are there?"</p>

  <p>"Four, sir. All of them desperate men; enough to overpower any household.
  Every one of them carries his life in his hand; and little he seems to care
  for it. Wenlow, as you call him, is the master of them, and can handle them
  as he pleases. It is clear to my thinking, that he gets his orders from some
  one, who keeps out of sight&mdash;somebody with money, and some end to serve;
  or why should he deal with such a gang? Captain Larks is at the bottom of it;
  not to do things, but to be done by. Sir, do you know, what has crossed my
  mind? It was through my thinking of my son, that it came to me. From what I
  heard say, I made up my mind, to have a good look at that Captain Larks,
  without his knowing of it. And so I did. And if ever I saw a man well-known
  to me, in the times when the great fighting was, Captain Larks is the man,
  and no mistake."</p>

  <p>"We have no business with what he used to do;" Jack answered quickly, in
  his loyalty of Rose; for he really feared, after many dark surmises, and
  hints from divers quarters, that the father of his beloved had done something
  beyond inquiry; "the only question we have to deal with is&mdash;what do
  these fellows want with him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, that is more than I can say," replied the landlord of the
  <i>Raven;</i> "but something to do with the old thing, most likely. They
  watch him close enough; I can answer for that. They don't tell me, of course,
  what their orders are; but I hear them talk, more than they think of. I
  believe their orders are to shoot him outright, if he tries to go off
  suddenly. But if they get wind of his meaning to go, their plan is to carry
  off his daughter; that he may stay at home to look for her. Anyhow, he is not
  to go from home."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, a very pretty state of things!" Jack exclaimed so loudly,
  that the other put his hand up&mdash;"a gentlemen is not to leave his own
  house, not to go about his own business even, without the permission of a lot
  of sheep-stealers! Howell, I don't believe a word of your nonsense."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, please yourself about all that. Only I have told you my
  opinion, at the risk of my life; and if you laugh at it, you can't well blame
  me afterwards. Squire, I wish you good afternoon."</p>

  <p>"No, you shall not do anything of the sort. Here you are, and here you
  stop; until I have something settled with you. What good do you do me, by
  vague warnings? I want to know, how to stop such mischief, and to punish
  every mother's son of them. If a scoundrel was scheming against me, to suit
  his own rascally purposes, do you think I wouldn't have it out with him? And
  when it is done against those that I love, am I likely to run away, and let
  them do it? Howell, I shall go with you, to your house."</p>

  <p>Whatever his licence may be, no man desires to be consumed on his own
  premises.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Howell; "it would make a great row; which is just the
  thing to be avoided. And what good could you do? You are strong enough, and
  brave enough to meet one man, I dare say. But here are four of them; and all
  with heavy fire-arms. You have saved my life, and I will not destroy yours;
  which would be done at once, if you ran in among them. The 'black gentleman'
  has a liking for your father&mdash;that I know, from many things&mdash;but it
  would not keep him from blowing out your brains, sir, if you tried to cross
  him. You must bear in mind, how long he has lived out of doors; and that
  makes men think much less of life. I have been out of doors myself, for
  months together; and life becomes a puff of air, among such people."</p>

  <p>"What you say is sensible. And I have no right to bring you into danger.
  You have acted fairly, and kindly by me; and you shall have no reason to
  regret it. But the worst of it is, that I don't see what to do. I am nothing
  of a hand at scheming. Tell me how to stop it, and it shall be done. My plan
  is to collar the ringleader, to lay Wenlow by the heels in jail."</p>

  <p>"Not at my house, sir," Howell answered; "not at my house, whatever you
  do. There is no house within three miles of mine. I should be murdered if you
  tried to do it there. But have him in his own place, if you can. No pack of
  hounds can come nigh an old tor-fox; and no regiment could catch
  Bog-Wenlow."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! I should only like to join hands with a certain friend of mine,
  who knows that fellow; and within a week we'd have him fast enough. I don't
  know him by sight; or I would have a shy at him immediately. He shifts about,
  here, there, and everywhere, they say; according to the weather, and his
  wants, or whims; but Cranmere is his head-quarters, I believe; and I know
  Cranmere as well as any one can know it. I have been there several times, to
  look for him."</p>

  <p>"So you might, sir, fifty times; and he be there all the time, without
  your twigging him. I can give you a case, of what I know to be a fact. He
  laid a guinea each, with them other three chaps, that they would not find him
  there, if they searched all day; and he gave his honour to go on as usual,
  cook his dinner, smoke his pipe, sit out in the sun&mdash;if there would be
  any&mdash;and go on like a common turf-cutter. Well, sir, they hunted all
  day, and they vowed that there could not be a snipe there, out of mark, and
  that he was a liar; and they were blessed, if they would pay,&mdash;when
  sudden there he was, in the middle of them, with one of them new-fangled
  pipes in his mouth, that are made of the froth of the sea, by all account. He
  had been there, all day, looking at them sometimes; sometimes not concerned
  to do it."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a rap of all that story," said Jack, who was hardened
  into disbelief, at Oxford; "I don't mean to say that you exaggerate at all.
  You believe it, no doubt, because you heard them tell it. And perhaps they
  believed it. But I don't. Unless the day was full of thick fog; and of that
  there has not been much, you know, for a most unusual time. The springs are
  very low; the bogs are down. Cranmere is only three or four miles from here.
  Howell, make your mind at ease. I shall have that fellow, in a day or two.
  And of course, I shall hold you clear of it. Nobody shall know, that I have
  even seen you."</p>

  <p>"If I may ask you a favour, sir, it would be to leave it, till my son
  comes home. Rees is the bravest man, that ever stepped the earth, and might
  have been an officer, except for being bashful. He knows all the ins, and
  outs, of half the bogs on Dartmoor; and the turn of his mind is, to catch the
  proper end of things. Not to go dwelling on this side-stroke, or on that; but
  to lay hold on the core of it, and pull it up to daylight. Ah, if he had only
  been born, when I was, he would have stood next to the duke, by now."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish, with all my heart, that he was here," said Jack, whose
  forehead was wrinkled with a world of doubts; "my father has been a great
  officer, but he waits for authority always."</p>

  <p>"So he ought, sir; so he ought; and I beg you to do the same, Squire
  Westcombe, concerning of my poor premises. I have put myself straight anyhow,
  with you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Yes, to a certain extent, you have. I shall take my own course; but I
  will keep you clear of trouble. You want to be off. Good-bye, my friend! Let
  me know at once, if your son comes home. But don't expect me to wait for him.
  I shall keep a very sharp look-out, and strike, if I get the
  opportunity."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch43"
     id="ch43">CHAPTER XLIII. &mdash; TWO PROUD MEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In spite of all these turmoils on its banks, the Christow
  went on well, although the summer was so dry, and long. For this water came
  from a noble depth of bog, purely inexhaustible; and the bell-ropes of the
  church, with three men upon a plank, had failed to give sign of its having
  any bottom. And not only so, but if anything happened, to choke the gullet of
  that bog, this fortunate brook possessed at least a dozen little pitchers,
  bedded in the hill-side, and with crystal radiance brimmed. Each had a very
  small supply to start with; and a stone could overwhelm, or a turf of dried
  peat sponge it up: but after a little run, they ran faster, and rejoicing
  leaped into one another's bosoms.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there still was green sward here, and green bushes waving off
  all dreams of autumn, in the captain's garden, where the sun was mild.
  Refreshing sounds arose, through the brushwood overhanging; and the play of
  light was pleasant, in the channel of the shadows. But what heed do men pay,
  to such trifles, when their minds are working, and their hearts are up?</p>

  <p>Two proud men stood, facing one another, on the quiet grass bank here,
  beside the little river. Not proud unjustly, neither manifesting pride, nor
  even conscious of it; though its power underlay every tone of their voices,
  and turn of their thoughts. In little things, there could have been no
  humbler men, none more gentle, slow to anger, mild, and quiet-hearted.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand, once for all," asked Colonel Westcombe, looking
  firmly at the other, whose eyes met his, with equal firmness; "that you
  refuse me any kind of explanation?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond any doubt, you must understand it so, I am sorry that it is so.
  But so it is; and must be."</p>

  <p>"Have you considered, that it is not only your own question but also that
  of others? That this set obstinacy wrecks the prospects of one, who is dearer
  to you than yourself? I mean not only as concerns my son&mdash;though he
  loves her dearly, and would have made her happy&mdash;but also concerning all
  her chance of settling, in her own rank of life, with a man she could
  respect?"</p>

  <p>"All that I have thought of, not only now, but for years; and it grieves
  me deeply; but it does not alter my resolve."</p>

  <p>"You admit, that you could clear yourself, if you chose," the colonel's
  glance was very keen, and almost stern; "you admit that a word from you is
  the only thing needed, to make your daughter happy, with us or elsewhere; as
  well as to set yourself right with the world? And yet, from some miserable
  pride, you refuse it?"</p>

  <p>"I have not admitted anything of the kind. You have put your own
  construction upon the case. And it is not for you, to talk of pride."</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean. You have rebuked me there. But only from the most
  romantic point of view. Can you expect me to look over the position, in which
  you choose to stand?"</p>

  <p>"No, Colonel Westcombe, I do not," Mr. Arthur answered calmly; "neither
  would I let you do so, if you wished it. The remedy is simple&mdash;have
  nothing more to say to us."</p>

  <p>"And you can put it all aside, like that? As if you had no flesh, or
  blood, in you!"</p>

  <p>"What else can you expect? It is the manner of the world&mdash;the world
  you belong to, and which governs now your actions. You scorn me, because I
  despise its opinions. You must act by its judgment. I act by my own."</p>

  <p>"I can believe of you," Colonel Westcombe answered, with a gaze of deep
  astonishment, "anything, and everything, when you talk thus. There is nothing
  that such a man may not do; because he is his own standard. But there never
  yet was any one, so wise, and grand, as to measure himself aright, by his own
  measure."</p>

  <p>"That is the last thing, I would desire to do. I prize the good opinion of
  all good men&mdash;and especially yours, Colonel Westcombe."</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur bowed, to end the conversation thus. But the colonel, who was
  looking rather harshly at him, because he thought him arrogant, caught a
  gleam in his eyes, that changed the tone of thought, and feeling, towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, we have stood together, with our lives upon the wind; and
  caring for them, as little as for the wind itself. In deadly peril, you saved
  my life. But for your wonderful courage, I could not be here now, to speak to
  you. I hope that I never was a coward; but I could better believe it of
  myself, than of you. I beg you, as one who could love you as a
  brother&mdash;drop, this dark mystery between us. If you forgot yourself
  once, confess it bravely. There are moments, when none of us know what we do.
  Only scatter that horrible charge of treachery, which was imported into your
  sad business&mdash;and I will face the world about it, side by side with you;
  and your Rose, and my Jack, shall be happy together. Pole, as a dear friend,
  I take your hand, and ask a favour."</p>

  <p>Then the pride of the other man was beaten, by this large humility; and
  the cold decision of his gaze was lost. Conquered by the kindness of this old
  friend&mdash;the man of integrity, unspotted honour, wide fame, and large
  benevolence, he bowed his head, and said&mdash;"Give me one month longer. One
  month more, is all I ask. And surely your son, hot and hasty as he is, will
  be able to endure one month of doubt."</p>

  <p>"Jack is a hot-headed fellow," said the colonel, smiling, as he always
  did, when he had to say anything about his son; "a month to Jack, is as much
  as a twelvemonth to us, who know how time goes. But, upon the whole, he has
  behaved most wonderfully well, throughout these proceedings. You scarcely
  seem to understand my son; but at least, you will do him justice there."</p>

  <p>"Gladly I will," answered Mr. Arthur; "I have been rough to him, once or
  twice; as much for your sake, as my own. Because I knew, how you would be
  vexed about this. But I will own to you, that if I had the choice of the
  world for my son-in-law, I would choose your son."</p>

  <p>"Nobly said, most nobly said!" cried the colonel, with great warmth
  seizing the hand of the captain, and getting a good grip from it; "and I will
  tell you, my dear fellow, that though I have seen very little of your Rose, I
  love her, as I would love a daughter of my own. You may think me very hasty,
  and very sentimental. And it is not for me to say otherwise. But my judgment
  is considered, by good judges, to be very sound, and slow. May I tell Jack,
  what you have said about him? He is slightly depressed, and rather
  melancholy. Perhaps you have found me harsh, through that. But what you have
  said of him will set him up again."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, tell him. I owe him great amends. I was very short with him,
  when I caught him going on&mdash;you understand; as we might have done, in
  our young days."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. True enough, we never make allowances. We are bound to keep
  them down; we must scold and snub them. But when we come to think of it, we
  begin to feel, that we ought to have remembered, what we used to do. What a
  pair they will make; if the Lord allows it! They seem to have been cut out,
  for one another. But we won't tell them that, till it comes to smooth
  sailing. They shan't see each other for a month; that is certain. At any
  rate, not with our approbation. Jack is under excellent discipline&mdash;Punk
  observed it, with great admiration&mdash;though, now and then, he gets over
  me; and he can manage his mother, more than I can. However, we will put him
  upon his honour. He never fails of that&mdash;as you know."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the captain, with a twinkle in his eyes; "he would not be
  like his father, if he ever failed in that. And he is like his father; and
  that set me in his favour, the first time he came to catch my fish."</p>

  <p>"Aha!" exclaimed the colonel, to whom a very obvious joke was none the
  less attractive; "and he has caught your fish, your pet of all fishes. But he
  has not quite landed her yet. Time will show. But let us have patience. I am
  satisfied to leave it so. How glad I am, that I came to see you, at last! It
  makes things so much more comfortable."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch44"
     id="ch44">CHAPTER XLIV. &mdash; SMINTHEUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Saturday, in its proper course comes round, bringing to
  schoolboys half-holiday (ennobled by a lie-a-bed to-morrow), to working men
  wages, and intellectual delights, to women a zeal to go marketing, and an
  emulous desire, not to cheat, but only to get the right side of their little
  bargains (for the pleasure of proving their wit, by its fruits), and to
  gentlemen responsible, and ladies ornamental, a Christian gratitude, that the
  week is over.</p>

  <p>This was the large way, in which the flight of time was regarded from the
  heights of Touchwood Park. Not that there was any pride, in any bosom there.
  Lady Touchwood was sure, that instead of going up, she was come down, more
  than she could describe, from what her ideas used to be. At one time, she
  expected to be in the House of Lords; and nothing but the way in which Sir
  Joseph would insist upon seeing his money come back again, had stopped her
  from being there, at the coronation. But the only way to get up there, was to
  be in London, and to give parties to the Royal Family, and people on the
  stairs, especially Prime Ministers; and Sir Joseph could afford it as easy as
  a glove; but he stuck to his money, and he stuck to the dirt. However, she
  was happier, as she was. Though it had been said in Plymouth, that she was
  born, to adorn the most exalted rank.</p>

  <p>Miss Touchwood thought that the people in London were probably quite as
  big fools, as those in Devonshire. But every young lady, in her position, had
  a right to go, and see what the others were about; and it seemed to her very
  stingy of her father, to be giving trumpery gipsy-parties; when he ought to
  have taken them all to town, before the season was over. For her part, she
  was tired of this neighbourhood. Nobody seemed to understand her. If she
  quoted a line of Byron, people thought it came out of a valentine, and asked
  her confidentially, who had sent it; and even a French, or German proverb,
  was supposed to come out of a cookery-book. In a word, there was no one to
  associate with.</p>

  <p>Her brother, Squire Dicky, took a different view of things. He detested
  clever girls, who could quote his head off, and were shocked at the idea of
  having beer for breakfast. He had seen enough already of society, for him;
  and in his veteran opinion, it was humbug. He had never known more than one
  girl, worth the end of a cigar&mdash;and that one had sacked him. Or at any
  rate, her dad had done it; and he knew she was too good for him. But he was
  blest, if he was going to be miserable. The time for popping at the birds was
  come. He would send for the finest fellow he had ever known, who had promised
  to be with him in September; and then there was nothing he would wish for
  better, than to catch that stuck-up Westcombe poaching.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he sent for Alec Howe of Trinity, a young man of great bulk,
  and stature; who was happy all day with him, but wretched in the evening,
  when the time came for swallow-tails, and white choker. Miss Touchwood
  enjoyed this young visitor, with prolonged delicious cruelty. He was as shy
  as any youth can be, who has never met a clever and accomplished girl, and
  has to do the graceful to her, at a table, where everything is beyond his
  understanding. Julia, being in a very spiteful mood just now, from a variety
  of causes, missed not a single opportunity of deepening, and barbing, his
  bashful embarrassment. Beneath her clear gaze, his great hand shook, and his
  big lips opened, and closed, in silence; and nearly as much of his sillery,
  or hock, passed outside, as inside his throat. And yet he was a gentleman by
  birth, and of cleaner descent than his fair tormenter; only not familiar with
  wealthy ways.</p>

  <p>Now this young man, and his host, the noble Dicky, were come home from a
  long day's shooting, that second Saturday in September. They had done well;
  for Howe was a fine shot; and Dicky pretty good, if he began well; though
  when he began ill, he would shoot amiss all day. That day he began well (by
  shooting a cat, who was hunting young rabbits, in a turnip-field), and he had
  gone on well, killing two birds out of three, which is not bad work for a
  Cambridge man. Also they had shot a hawk, and two whimbrels, three or four
  landrails, and some hares, and coneys, making altogether a nice mixed bag,
  which they spread out on the capping of a low curved wall, where the road to
  the stables, and the kitchen-parts, divided. This was Dicky Touchwood's
  beloved camping-place, commanding easy access, both to men and women, and
  allowing him to get into view of either; or upon occasion to mediate between
  them. And to say, that the servants always liked him to be there, proves that
  he was a very honourable youth.</p>

  <p>When Dicky, and his friend and hero, Alec, had spread out their game, to
  the utmost advantage, and stroked and felt everything, as if the defunction
  of its virtue went into the slayer&mdash;as the Norsemen, and Red Indians
  believed&mdash;they spread out their own noble bodies on the handy, or rather
  perhaps legsome, height of the low wall. Howe, being six feet and a quarter
  high, found the wall rather too low for him; but Dicky had his legs hanging
  above ground and his neat heels drumming. The head game-keeper, with his
  honest bluffness, stood a little way off, looking affable, for the young
  gents had not hurt his feelings much that day; and admiring stablemen in
  their shirt-sleeves approached, with a venerating hope of beer.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel, Alec?" asked the lightsome Dicky; "I am as dry, as a
  hard-roed red herring. What do you vote for, champagne, or swipes? There's a
  first-rate 36 of Burton, just on tap."</p>

  <p>"I go in for that;" answered Howe, in whose mind champagne was now sadly
  associated with the very dry sparkle of Julia.</p>

  <p>"So do I, with all my heart. But the deuce of it is, that I have found a
  key working the old governor's best lock, where he keeps some stuff, that he
  thinks no end of. And I feel that I shall have earned no ease of mind, until
  I have had a good peg at it. Tell you what I'll do, to make it square. Well
  enjoy the swipes; and these chaps shall have champagne."</p>

  <p>"Don't be such a fool;" said Alec Howe. Although he had not yet seen Sir
  Joseph, he guessed, from many sources, what he was like. But Dicky was off,
  to carry out his new idea.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't they have what they like?" he inquired, coming back, with
  young Solomon behind him, whose face was in a bubble of anticipation; "now
  this boy pours out lashings of wine perpetually; yet he never tastes it,
  except when he licks the glasses. Sol, my lad, you shall have first bumper.
  See your father draw the corks for you! Why, your name is Cork&mdash;you are
  the son of a cork. Now see, how I send you up into the liquid sky!"</p>

  <p>Of the loftier humanities fostered at Cambridge, a main one was the art of
  discharging a cork full bang, from a bottle of poppish fluid, without loss.
  The process requires some experience, and quickness; but Dicky was a Master
  of Arts therein. He took a long pull at the pewter of ale, looking towards
  Alec, and in three half minutes, had three bottles of his father's most
  choice comet vintage "on tap," (as he termed it) for the brave stablemen. The
  keeper stood aloof, and would not touch it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in the very midst of them, stood the master of the place, Sir
  Joseph Touchwood, cold, and pale, with quiet rage. With a sweep of his hand,
  he struck over all the bottles, then emptied the can of ale upon his son's
  head, and without a word to any one, strode off to the front door.</p>

  <p>"My criky, we are in for it!" the poor boy spluttered, through the deluge
  of beer, which had checked his breath; "I never saw the governor in such a
  way before. But don't you be frightened, my good fellows. I will take all the
  row. You needn't turn a hair. And you shall have your three bottles, if I
  have to buy them. What an extravagant old cove it is!"</p>

  <p>Calling his friend, Alec Howe, who was trying to smile at this great
  outbreak, the heir of the Touchwoods went in, with all the dignity he could
  compass, by the kitchen door, made Alec pump over him, at a servant's sink,
  and then hurried up, to his dressing-room. He strove to be wrathful, but fear
  was foremost; and his teeth chattered sadly, as he got into his bath. He
  would have given all his ready cash&mdash;which he kept low,&mdash;for a
  little private talk with his dear mother. But her ladyship was dressing, and
  he got no chance of sending a message to her.</p>

  <p>Very soon, he was trying to compose his mind, by smoothing the pile of a
  velvet waistcoat&mdash;for which he owed £<i>3</i> 10<i>s</i>. in Cambridge,
  and admiring in the glass the gentle dawn of reddish whiskers, brightened and
  strengthened, as examination showed, by the rich shower of fine-bodied ale.
  "I will rub them with the very best Bass, every day, and perhaps then Rose
  will like me," he was saying to himself, when a knock at the door made him
  jump, and a little note came under it. Running to the door, he called out,
  "Judy, Judy dear, darling Judy!" for he knew the sound of her firm light
  step; "Julia, I want you desperately." But either she could not, or she would
  not hear; and the whisk of her dress was a memory round the corner.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to do it all, by myself," he groaned, for he guessed too
  well what the letter was; "in for a penny, in for a pound. At any rate, the
  relieving officer shall know what I think of him. Halloa!"</p>

  <p>The relieving officer,&mdash;as the male parent was called in those days,
  at our great universities,&mdash;had set down these few words, for his study.
  "Richard, as there will be no dinner to-day, I shall be glad to see you, in
  the dining-room, five minutes from receipt of this. (Signed) Joseph
  Touchwood."</p>

  <p>"What a kettle of fish! Don't you wish you may catch it? I'll have a
  bar-out. The stable-cads shall supply me with grub, through the windows. But
  the governor would cut it, with a demon-laugh, and leave a brace of
  dogberries to run me in. I will quit me, like a man. I'll go down, and have
  it out. 'Never say die,' is the ticket for soup."</p>

  <p>When the young man appeared, in the barren dining-room, he saw his father
  sitting in the six-legged chair, too deep in thought, even to look at him.
  His face was very stern, but with trouble, more than anger; and Dicky saw,
  that larger things than his, had gone amiss. He began to say
  jauntily&mdash;"Why, where's the dinner?" which was a serious concern to him.
  But his father made no answer; so he stood, and waited.</p>

  <p>"Who is there? Oh, Richard, is it? Boy, stand, and look at me. I am not
  going to talk to you, about my affairs; but simply to explain, what yours
  will be. Hitherto, you have led a life of idle pleasure. Henceforth you will
  have to earn your own bread. Before I was half your age, I was doing that. It
  will make a man of you. How do you like the thought of it?"</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not at all, sir. In fact I could not do it. I have never been
  accustomed to such proceedings."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You need not begin, till Monday. To-morrow, you will get your
  clothes together, and live at my expense, as usual. On Monday morning, you
  will shoulder what you want for immediate use, and be off at six o'clock, for
  the office of Mr. Growgray at Stonehouse. Mr. Growgray is a well-known
  dry-salter; and, through my connection with him, he has promised most kindly,
  to find an opening for you. I have paid a considerable premium to him, and
  your salary will be a pound a week&mdash;a great deal more, I fear, than you
  will be worth, for a very long time, at any rate. Your stock of clothes will
  last you, for at least two years; and I shall endeavour to allow you five
  shillings a week, for pocket-money. Also, you will be allowed to come, and
  see your mother and your sister (wherever they may be) one Sunday in every
  three months."</p>

  <p>"It is quite impossible that you can be in earnest. Sir, you must either
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I am neither mad, nor intoxicated; nor even hasty in this
  arrangement. It has been thought of for some months; while you were busy with
  your rats, and rabbits. Nature has made you a fool; and circumstances have
  concurred with nature. You are now provided with a good start in life. Fools
  always prosper the best, in the end. I have often heard you boast, that
  almost everybody likes you. That lays the foundation of a large sound
  trade."</p>

  <p>"But I can't be a dry-salter, and I won't be a dry-salter, and I never
  could put up with the smell of it," Squire Dicky declared, as he fell into a
  very luxurious chair, and embraced it. "Why, I should have to sit upon a
  three-leg'd stool!"</p>

  <p>"No; you might stand all day, if you preferred it. However, that is all
  the choice before you. Now leave me; I have more important things, to think
  of."</p>

  <p>Dicky Touchwood was quick of thought about himself; but even on that
  subject now, his readiness was gone; so sudden was this outrage, and so
  overwhelming. He arose, without looking at his father, and made off; but his
  spirit came back, when he got to the door. "Sir, you will be sorry for
  attempting this," he said, with his voice half-choked by tears; "I have
  plenty of good friends, who will stand by me. I will not go near any vile
  dry-salter. If you turn me out of doors, I will get an honest living as a
  rat-catcher, and contract for all the rats at Plymouth."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch45"
     id="ch45">CHAPTER XLV. &mdash; THE MUZZLE MUZZLED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dartmoor, many-fountained Dartmoor, mother of a myriad
  streams, and wet nurse of a million mists, is not often scrimped with
  drought; but when the drought once gets established, how it smites the rocky
  land! Furze, and heath, dwarf rush, and bracken, even the cotton-grass of the
  swamp, and sedge that lines the tinkling rill, fade into one dreary yellow,
  or dingy red, that jades the sight. The power of the dry sun is reflected
  from the stark rocks down the vales, and nothing is hidden from the heat
  thereof.</p>

  <p>When such seasons come, they are so far asunder (in the hills and valleys
  of the distant years) that nobody remembers that they ever came before. And
  with one accord the people there, not being used (like brick-bound townsmen)
  to an unventilated oven, begin to make sad complaint, and outcry; which add
  ten per cent, to their temperature. They then fan themselves with their
  husband's hats&mdash;as many as have got husbands&mdash;and they feel that
  they owe it for a duty to the world, not to be over-charitable. In fact, they
  are cross, and they make the worst of everything, in the spirit of the flies
  that enter into their weak places.</p>

  <p>Even at Christowell (cool and crystal, with the wandering leisure and
  bright import of the brook), dryness of the ground, and of the skin, began to
  tell upon the children, and the women, and the men. Not one of them all had
  the least idea, that it made any difference to her, or to him; but every one
  had a very large perception, that no one else was, as he ought to be.
  Horse-flies began to descend upon mankind, in lack of their nobler nurture,
  spotted flies, with broad heads and big tweezers; and wherever there was
  moisture for a gnat to nip, he nipped, and was exceeding thirsty.</p>

  <p>But, if in the valley, where the grass still grew, and the leaves still
  cherished the nursing of the brook, nature was depressed, and her mighty
  masters petulant; how much worse must the pest of season be, on the brown,
  unshadowed, and unswarded crags! And worst of all round the dry desert of the
  <i>Raven;</i> where mine-slag, sparry rocks, and spelter dust combined, to
  glare with intense heat, and cast it all around. All around was heat, and
  drought, dull tremor of the air, and pulse of haze, that twinkles when the
  dews of night are drained. Even the moormen would not come, to get their
  usual pint of ale, sadly although they needed it, for fear of the fury of the
  vipers round it, and the sun-death in the glare of rock.</p>

  <p>However, the house, with its thick granite walls, and stone-floors watered
  from the well, was fresh with cooling shade inside, and the glisten of cool
  tankards. "Gentleman Wenlow"&mdash;as he now was called, from the dinners he
  had given there&mdash;sat without reproach, in a cambric-bosomed shirt
  (kindly borrowed from Parson Short), and considered the business that lay
  before him. The heat of the weather had stopped his parties, for the moment,
  because no meat would keep, and his guests declined to face the yellow
  distance from their greener glens. Upon the whole indeed, this gentleman was
  not much displeased with that. It was quite as well to intermit the duties of
  a host, whilst this roasting weather held; and to steal sheep enough for his
  own consumption, was as much as an active man could do.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was not social need, or sense of solitude that made him
  frown, as he sat with his cooling pot, of cider, rum, and borage, thinking
  how to carry out the orders of his patron. These were easy enough to
  understand, but not quite so easy to execute; even with the aid of the
  blackest boon companions. And the matter, from a moral point of view, was not
  altogether to his liking. For a long time now, he had been compelled to
  appropriate alien property. But he had striven to do this with a lenient
  hand, and a fine regard for justice, robbing only those who could afford it,
  and robbing even them at honest intervals, impartially. All his laxities were
  of necessity, all his lapses caused by largeness. What man has any right to
  own the earth, with a hundred better people born upon it, every minute? And
  if he cannot own the earth, as the whole includes the parts, how can he own
  any part of it? How much less then, can he be the owner of the things that
  move about on it, and have got four legs; while he, who lays claim to them,
  has only got two? Such reasoning is unanswerable; or if it can be answered,
  the best of the argument is with him, who has had the dinner, and digested
  it.</p>

  <p>But what Guy Wenlow did not like, and in spite of his reputation found to
  be outside his province, was the commission of downright murder, in cold
  blood, and with no excuse. Captain Larks had never harmed him, whereas George
  Gaston had been his ruin. With pleasure would he have shot the latter, in
  conflict, or upon insult; whereas now the relentless force of facts was
  driving him, too surely, towards the necessity of shooting the other. His
  orders newly received were brief, sadly to the point, and stringent&mdash;"It
  is too late for weak measures now. To carry off the girl is useless. If he
  leaves home, you shall swing for it. I am not like the fools round Dartmoor.
  Make a short job of it, for your own sake. With management, there can be no
  risk. Trust to me, for your escape, and a better land to winter in, with
  plenty of cash, and no more skulking. Let me hear of no more delay. If I have
  to come down, it will be the worse for you. I am watching you; and you have
  no escape, from me, or without me. Turn upon me, if you dare. Obey me, and
  you shall be free, rich, and happy."</p>

  <p>The writer had taken good care, that none should identify his writing. It
  was hopeless, for a poor felon to denounce, or even break with him. The
  tempter had not allowed him funds, to attempt escape across the sea; and
  Wenlow even began to suspect, that Howell was bribed against him. His only
  chance lay in obedience to the deeper, and wealthier scoundrel. His own life
  was set against that of another; and he must not indulge in scruples. It
  would be a very easy business, to dispose of Captain Larks. Through many a
  flying visit, and many a lair among the bushes, he knew the ins, and outs,
  and rounds among beloved plants and trees, of that too sanguine gardener. And
  his favourite double-barrel'd gun would carry a ball, as true as any rifle,
  and was certain for a rabbit at a hundred yards. At six o'clock, on this
  evening of the week, the captain was sure to be in his little vineyard,
  sitting on a pot, with his deep-bowled meerschaum, and presenting the very
  finest target for a shot. What right had any man to be so happy, and go on,
  as if the world was a playground for him?</p>

  <p>With a frown, to confirm his resolution, he gulped the contents of his
  tankard; and then it occurred to him, that nothing could be easier than to
  secure proofs of <i>alibi,</i> in case of the worst coming to the worst, and
  a charge being made against him. He knew that Gruff Howell was not at home;
  but his wife was there, and would do much better. Accordingly, when
  everything was ready, and a bullet dropped into either barrel of his gun, he
  unlocked his door, and went downstairs, in his shirt-sleeves, yawning
  heavily. Mrs. Howell was sitting in the bar, half asleep, with her spectacles
  by her, and the big Bible open, at her favourite story of Joseph and his
  brethren, which she read daily, because it reminded her hopefully of her
  absent son.</p>

  <p>"Fill this again for me, mother," said the guest, setting down his empty
  tankard. "What o'clock is it? Why, a quarter-past four! Are you sure your
  clock is right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Or if anything, he be a little slow. We timed 'un by the
  baker's watch, only yesterday; and he brought the time from Bovey tower."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then I shall go to sleep again. This hot weather takes all the
  life out of me. I am not to be disturbed, mind. I want sleep. Only when the
  rabbits come, I may fire a shot at them. Don't be alarmed, if you hear my
  gun, about six o'clock, or so. No supper, till I call for it."</p>

  <p>Receiving his tankard, with another stretch and yawn, he went to his room,
  and locked the door. Then he laid his other gun, which had once been Mr.
  Short's, upon the broad oak window-sill, with the lattice thrown back, and
  the muzzle outside, pointing towards the cliff, where the rabbits came to
  play, in the late afternoon, when the inn was quiet. He had shot two or three
  of them, before this, from the window; and now he fitted that into his deadly
  scheme. He corded the gun against recoil, and set a slow fuse of hemp to the
  touch-hole, which would smoulder for an hour, or perhaps more; and then he
  descended from the window, by a method, which he had devised against attack.
  There was nobody to see him; all the brown moor was void with loneliness and
  lassitude; not a shadow, except his own, moved faster than the sun directed
  it. But he, at a pace that would make a lazy man lie down to watch it,
  scoured the hollows of the sun-burnt hills, to the wild outskirt of
  Christowell.</p>

  <p>Why make we light of our parents' wisdom, why imagine so vain a thing, as
  that they had no eyes to see, ears to hear, or tongues to taste? Denying them
  every other merit, we must admit, that they knew what was good to eat, far
  better than we do. Would they have given as much for American flour, as for
  English? Would they have made their bread, with German paste, instead of
  brewer's yeast? Would they have bought fish, three weeks iced, and wine made
  where no grape gets ripe? And of the grape, and other fruit, would they have
  grown it for show, or for savour? Already in 1840, the rage for the pride of
  the eyes, and the pang of the belly, was making way among superior circles;
  and the ladies began to say, to one another&mdash;"if you can save my
  pine-apple from being cut, dear, I will lend it to you, for your dinner, on
  Wednesday."</p>

  <p>But Captain Larks was happy still, in tending the good gifts of the earth,
  for graceful, and for grateful use. He sat upon his pot, and smoked his pipe,
  and working gently all the while, enjoyed the view of his own things first,
  and over, or between them, of the things beyond. For the wisdom of the quiet
  life was his&mdash;first to consider one's own affairs, without any wrath of
  anxiety; and then through their leisure, or over their ease, to enjoy a large
  view of the neighbourly cares. Thus was he behaving, in his vineyard, as soon
  as the heat of the sun declined, and the shade of the high parts cooled the
  rest, and the birds by the brook began to sing again, and the trees freshened
  up from the drooping of the day.</p>

  <p>Sloping down the hillside now, the light was tempered variously, with
  narrow flush, broad hovering patch, and faint fringe of suffusive haze. But
  in bold relief, sat the gallant captain, moving both arms briskly, with his
  broad chest prominent between his braces, and a smile of pride upon his
  tranquil face. For here were his grapes, swelling off from stoning,
  clustering richly below their leaves, sheltered from brunt of the day, and
  expecting the bloom of dew, to crisp their stalks. Some were clouding with
  soft blue tissue of the promised purple, some were pearly with pellucid
  white, others traced with stippled veins of tints that would be amber; while
  the rest were scarce emerging from pubescent green and grey. The gardener
  felt his heart maturing, with good will, towards God, and man.</p>

  <p>"Impossible to miss him now. I can perceive the buttons of his shirt, and
  the beating of his heart. With this rest for my gun, I can hit him, to a
  square inch anywhere. He shall not even know, that he has been shot. I will
  give him a minute, just to finish up his pipe; and then off he goes to a far
  superior world."</p>

  <p>With these thoughts, Wenlow, having dead point-blank at the
  self-congratulating Captain Larks, suspended his pull upon the trigger; not
  from mercy, but that delicacy of feeling which a man has, a smoking man, for
  a fellow-smoker's pipe&mdash;a feeling, whose depth is in nature's bowels,
  deep as the founts of calm volcanoes.</p>

  <p>Presently the captain put his pipe down, being come duly to the end of it;
  and the man in the valley laid his eyes between the gun-cocks, to renew true
  aim at him. True enough it was, and too sure would have been the
  vinedresser's fate, as regards this world&mdash;when a shadow fell across, in
  front of him, and before him stood his daughter Rose. Wenlow drew back his
  fore-finger from the trigger; he could not shoot the father, in the presence
  of the child. "I will wait, and see how they go on," he thought; "to save my
  own life, I could not take his, thus." He withdrew the muzzle softly, and in
  the deep shade, listened.</p>

  <p>"Father, my mind is made up," said Rose, as she threw her arms round the
  captain's neck, and kissed him. "I have been considering, what you said; and
  I mean to stick to you&mdash;to you. You say that I may come to rank, and
  riches, and live in a very different way from this, if I give up all thoughts
  of&mdash;of every one but you. But you must know well, that I never think of
  that. I would rather be, as I am, without those things; if I only have you,
  and you love me, as you used. I will try to think no more of&mdash;of poor
  John Westcombe; or of any other person in the world, but you. Only, it would
  break my heart, to go away, and be rich, and gay, and high, without him. He
  would think that I had deceived him, sold him, cast him off, for bright
  things, and great people. I would rather be dead; than be thought of so, by
  him. I will give him up, as you require it so. But not
  disgracefully&mdash;father, not disgracefully. I beg of you, to promise me
  one very little thing."</p>

  <p>"My darling, there is nothing that I would not promise, rather than see
  you cry, like this. You know, that you are all the world to me."</p>

  <p>"I used to think so; but how can I think so now? The only thing I ask you
  to promise me, is this&mdash;that if I give him up, I shall still stop
  here,&mdash;here, where I have nothing; only things to love me; and where I
  cannot seem to have thrown him by, for grandeur. How I wish I was a little
  girl again, coming home for the holidays, with nothing but a Sunday hat!"</p>

  <p>"What would Mrs. Pugsley say to such a wardrobe? My dear child, there is
  no earthly reason, why you should work yourself up to such a fervour. I have
  asked no pledge of you, and want none. I love you very dearly, dear; and all
  the better perhaps, for being just a little bit excitable. I hate
  cold-blooded people; though I am considered one of them, by those who do not
  know me. But surely you may have enough of confidence in me, Rose, to let me
  take my own time, in a matter of this kind. I have never asked you to cast
  off young Westcombe. I was certainly very much put out with you, for the
  things that took place beneath the leather-coat pippin, wrongly called the
  crab-tree. But I have forgiven you all that, because&mdash;because you are my
  darling Rose. And the utmost that I ask of you, is to wait. One way, or
  another, I shall soon know what to do. I may have to go away, and leave you,
  my dear. But I dare not leave you here, at present. I could have left you
  happily at Exeter, either with your good school-mistress, or with Mr. Tucker.
  But she is away, for her holidays; and he has no ladies in his house, at
  present. If I have to go suddenly, I must even trust you to the charge of
  Mrs. Pugsley, at Moreton; as soon as we are quit of the poor general."</p>

  <p>"I am sure she would be very kind to me, indeed. I could do very well
  there, if you must go. But oh, father, don't go, if you can help it. I shall
  be so miserable, without you. And who will look after all our things here?
  What would become of all these grapes, for instance? I am sure there is a fox
  prowling after them, already."</p>

  <p>"Well, we must hope that he would find them sour. Now come home, my
  darling. I have no heart to work any more, after seeing you in this grievous
  state."</p>

  <p>As soon as they were gone, black Wenlow rose, and filled his pipe, with a
  happier heart than he had enjoyed for months, and years. He was conscious,
  according to his special form of conscience, of having done a very noble act
  indeed. But when he got back to the <i>Raven,</i> and found (upon clambering
  in, at his open window, and going down to order supper) that his gun had gone
  off about half-past five, he was wroth at the waste of so much ingenuity. For
  no clearer <i>alibi</i> could have been proved, than the one Mrs. Howell, and
  two visitors in the tap-room, were ready to depose to, from the proof of
  their own ears.</p>

  <p>He deserved to have his slippers, like a gentleman at his inn, who pays
  his way, when he can do it; and he felt that after having been so good that
  day, he might trust in providence against police. One of his chief merits
  was, that (in spite of some luxury during boyhood) he had taken to the bogs,
  and windy life; as if he had been born without a cradle. That was a
  side-shoot, so far as one may guess, perhaps of his sporting tendencies. If
  so, how much more was it to his credit, not to shoot a man, when he had him
  on his bullet! Into all this he entered, with the exhaustive comprehension of
  a fine mind, dwelling on its owner's compensations. Then he made a great
  supper, to support introspection, and slept, upon a four-footed bed, the
  sleep of the just, with two guns loaded.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch46"
     id="ch46">CHAPTER XLVI. &mdash; SOME CONFUSION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Reasonably now was Mr. Gaston discontented with the state of
  things. There was not much to stand between him, and the dark flight of
  disgrace and ruin&mdash;"transportation beyond the seas." There might be even
  more than that. Forgery (lately a capital offence), was still considered next
  to murder; and he might get a term of hard labour first, before patriotic
  farewell. He had freely exerted his power to write the old earl's hand to a
  nicety, as well as robbed him in fifty other ways; and now the account of his
  stewardship lay under difficulties, far more appalling than those of the
  unjust steward in the parable.</p>

  <p>So long as the old earl lived, George Gaston felt himself safe against
  that account. Indolence, bad health, and general cynicism had led the aged
  man to defer strict inquiry; though his faith in the agent had never been
  profound, and of late years had grown less and less. But he said to himself,
  that he should go from bad to worse, if he introduced new hands, to rob him;
  and Gaston contrived, by many insolent devices, to keep out any who might
  interfere, especially the good firm of Latimer and Emblin. But now the old
  nobleman had nothing more to do with this world; except in the posthumous
  form, of last will and testament, and black-edged paper. George Gaston had
  left him to wrestle with his death; and there was no one nearer, or dearer,
  to him than Mrs. Tubbs, to close his slowly vanquished eyes.</p>

  <p>When the great physician, Sir John Tickell, came down softly, and
  announced that all was over, Mr. Gaston strode forth, with a stick of black
  sealing-wax, nearly as large as a rolling-pin, a coil of wax-taper, and his
  own signet-ring; and he said to all the servants, "I must do my duty; let
  Tubbs come round the house, with me. I require a witness for this act." But
  nobody could tell him where the housekeeper was; so he took the trembling
  butler for his witness.</p>

  <p>"As sole executor, I am responsible for the safe custody of everything,"
  he pronounced, with an air of sad importance; "all his lordship's jewels,
  plate, documents, &amp;c, must be put under seal at once."</p>

  <p>Although he had stolen a good many of them, there were still enough left
  in chest, bureau, strong-box, writing-desk, and the like, to occupy him one
  good hour, in the careful discharge of this solemn duty. The butler carried a
  roll of red tape, and a sharp pair of scissors; and whenever the seal would
  not go on the slit, the tape was stretched across, and sealed.</p>

  <p>"That makes five and thirty done, and the two room-doors, containing all
  the lighter things;" Mr. Gaston wiped his red face, as he was speaking;
  "sorrow, and duty, are alike dry things. Jenkins, go down for a bottle of old
  port, and be sure to bring the winding cork-screw. Here, take the key. Only
  one bottle, mind you." "As if I was a thief!" the old man muttered; for
  Gaston had the gift of offending everybody.</p>

  <p>"Down with it, on the big table in the dining-room, you poor old numskull;
  will you never understand, that I am master now?"</p>

  <p>But timid as he was, and shaking knuckles out of elbows, Jenkins had too
  fine a sense of order, to obey such orders. With the skill of ancient
  vintagers, he drew the cork, and set the bottle down upon a marble slab, with
  two glasses by it, that he might have one.</p>

  <p>"Be off, old chap!" said Gaston; "when I want you, I will ring. Don't let
  any undertakers come near me. Tell them to send estimates to-morrow morning.
  Nothing else keeps such robbers down. I am in a position of responsibility;
  and I must have time to turn my thoughts. No, Mr. Latimer! Not now, not now.
  Tomorrow morning, if you please."</p>

  <p>For here was Mr. Latimer (of the reputable firm of Latimer and Emblin)
  advancing in the full power of grief, at the loss of a client of importance.
  His ancestor's shoe-buckles flashed upon his insteps, for he had not stopped
  to put gaiters on; above them his black silk stockings shone; the frills of
  his shirt were as stiff as a sting-ray; and his face as dry as a law-digest.
  Behind him strode his tall partner, Emblin, swinging a cane of rather
  sporting aspect; and behind Mr. Emblin came a gentleman, unknown to Gaston,
  but in haste to introduce himself.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, this pleasure takes me by surprise;" Mr. Gaston spoke loudly,
  for they seemed to be coming on so; "decency might have induced you to wait,
  and self-interest too; for this is not at all the manner, to secure my custom
  for your firm. I understand my duties, without your aid. And you should at
  least have waited, till I sent for you. But as you have chosen thus, to act
  without me, I shall be bold enough, to act without you. When I need your
  services, I will send. Jenkins, show these people out."</p>

  <p>"Sir, we have no wish to intrude upon you," Mr. Latimer replied, as he
  took a chair, and waved his hand to the butler, to close the door; "and
  indeed we need not do so, if you will withdraw. But under the late earl's
  will, it is our duty, to see to the safety of all his effects, before the
  preparation of the inventory. We shall, therefore, proceed to seal up all
  keys, papers, jewels, plate, and such like, and place a trusty person in
  possession, until we can communicate with his lordship's son. If he declines
  to come forward, and desires that you should continue in the agency, we shall
  take his instructions to that effect in writing, and gladly place everything
  under your charge."</p>

  <p>"What an old fool you are," said Gaston, opening his square jaws, with a
  haughty grin, "to throw up a lucrative connection thus! If you had played
  your cards with any skill, I might have continued you in the business, slow
  and stupid as you are. What's the good of coming here with that old will,
  made at the death of the boy, months ago? Under this later will, I am sole
  executor; and all is left to my discretion. There now, what do you think of
  that, my friends? Fie, fie, what are lawyers come to?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, we are come, to do our duty; according to the best of our belief. If
  you hold a will, of the purport you describe, duly executed, and of later
  date than the 5th of the present month, we have no more to say; except that
  we shall scrutinise it closely, because it is at variance with our
  instructions. Otherwise, this is the last, and therefore the only valid will,
  of our lamented client. You will see the date; the fifth day of September,
  anno doming 1840. It is brief, and certainly somewhat curt, and bald,
  deficient perhaps in that fulness of language, which a legal education alone
  can impart. Nevertheless most creditable to a layman"&mdash;Mr. Latimer bowed
  to Mr. Snacks&mdash;"and as valid a will, as I have ever yet had the honour
  of perusing."</p>

  <p>"Let me see it." George Gaston's high colour had ebbed, to the tint of the
  paper of the will.</p>

  <p>"Don't let him touch it;" cried Snacks prematurely.</p>

  <p>"Under correction," Mr. Latimer said gently, with a bow of repression, to
  the lay-minded Snacks; "my duty is not to permit the original to quit my
  possession, however briefly. But we have prepared two copies; one of which my
  valued partner, Mr. Emblin, will have great pleasure in handing to you.
  Perhaps you will peruse it, and inform us, whether you have anything of later
  date."</p>

  <p>Mr. Emblin lifted his long form, and grimly smiling held forth a sheet of
  draft paper, headed, "Copy of the will of the Right Honourable Earl Delapole,
  etc., etc., bearing date Sept. 5th, 1840."</p>

  <p>Gaston glanced at it, took its meaning in a moment (because it was not a
  lawyer's work) and quelling his rage by a desperate effort, made the last
  cast of audacity.</p>

  <p>"Really, gentlemen," he said, "perhaps the best thing will be, to call in
  some one else; some one quite neutral, and not a mere lawyer. The poor old
  earl's mind was so vacillating lately, and designing people plied him
  so&mdash;that Tubbs for instance, who goes in, I see, for £1000 in this
  document,&mdash;that it seems to me only too probable, that none of these
  wills will hold water. I believe that mine&mdash;I will not be quite certain,
  for I knew not that the date would be so important,&mdash;is two days
  subsequent to this of yours. His lordship rallied; and his mind improved. He
  again perceived, who was his real mainstay; and he remembered the baseness,
  and cruelty of his son. It matters but little to me, you are aware; for my
  position in any case, is a mere trusteeship. His lordship has not made me the
  heir, even of the little he could dispose of. The bulk of the property is in
  settlement. Only I feel perhaps a little goaded, at the idea of being kicked
  out (after so many years of confidence), through the intrigues of a woman
  like this Tubbs. It was probably Tubbs, who got this will made. She has long
  lived apart from her husband, if she has one; and his lordship was given to
  gallantry."</p>

  <p>Here was a new light shed upon the subject. Mr. Gaston saw, that he had
  made a hit, and folded his arms, for his words to soak in; while he was
  trying to remember whether there would be any chance, of shifting snugly the
  date of the will, under which he was the master.</p>

  <p>Lawyers generally perpend&mdash;to use a word of their own&mdash;towards
  that solution of a problem, which involves the lower view of human nature.
  Moreover, there always is among them, an inclination for old channels, a
  desire to treat still, through, or with, the "party," through, or with, whom,
  they have treated hitherto, and a hovering doubt about loss of good
  connection, by siding with the powers not established yet. Mr. Latimer looked
  at Mr. Emblin, and that loyal partner returned his gaze. But suddenly Mr.
  Snacks cut in.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "it cannot be pretended, that I have any interest in
  this case. Mr. Gaston has proposed to call a third party in, to settle
  something about dates. Well, here am I, a third party fair enough; able to
  put down twenty thousand pounds, and without twenty pence in question here.
  Also, although but a layman, able to make out the date upon any document, in
  the English writing of the present day. If this good gentleman doubts about
  his dates, (which are apt to go out of the best head, in trouble,) let him
  put the other will in my hands; and I will very soon tell you, which is the
  correct card. He spoke of it as being in his pocket now; or at any rate he
  tapped his coat over it. And if he will hand it to me,&mdash;why there, we
  need have no more trouble."</p>

  <p>"Sir, it is a sensible, and frank proposal," Mr. Latimer replied, with
  some relief; "and if Mr. Gaston meets it frankly, we will abide by the issue,
  for the present; at least as regards the present custody of effects."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Gaston would not meet the challenge; for the very good reason that
  he could not. It would take him some hours, at least, to shift the date, and
  bribe the two attestants.</p>

  <p>"All this sounds very well; but it is not business," he said, with all his
  ancient arrogance. "It is more like child's play, than sound legal sense. I
  stand here alone, without any legal aid; and I will ask Mr. Latimer, and Mr.
  Emblin, as experienced men of law, whether a trustee, placed as I am, in
  great responsibility, would be doing his duty, by assenting to such a
  hugger-mugger style of slap-dash. Gentlemen, you know that I am no lawyer. I
  am acting entirely in the interest of others. And I might have a bitter
  account to render, if I took another step, without legal advice. There is no
  advice, that I should prefer, if the question were my own, to that of the
  learned firm here present. But they are precluded, by their position, from
  giving me their valuable counsel now. I hope to have recourse to them
  hereafter, and probably large dealings with them, as his lordship's habitual
  advisers. For the moment, however, I must ascertain, from other sources, what
  my duty is. I have realized, by years of honest labour, a sufficient
  competence to make this matter one of supreme indifference to me. But acting
  for others, I must do my best; and I shall not flinch from an unpleasant
  duty."</p>

  <p>"Gammon!" said Mr. Snacks, or began to say it; but was requested to
  reserve his observations.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Latimer, after a little quiet conference with his partner, arose,
  and spoke decisively. "We have no wish to take you by surprise, Mr. Gaston,
  or to force your intentions from you. We will gladly meet any one appointed
  by you, and consider his views, in an amicable spirit. Neither do we
  entertain any idea of 'kicking you out'&mdash;as you rather strongly put it.
  On the contrary, we hope for your good-will, to which we shall have some
  claim, by relieving you from onerous, and unprofitable work. Our course is
  clear; and nothing, except the production of a will, superseding this, can
  make our duty doubtful. We will not, for the present, remove your seals, but
  simply place our own beside them&mdash;a duplicate security, so to
  speak&mdash;and it will help us much, to follow your suggestions of value, by
  noting what articles you have sealed. Our senior clerk, who was out on
  business, will be here by this time, and will do the manual part, and remain
  in charge, until further instructions. If you will come round with us, so
  much the better; or send with us any one you think fit. You clearly
  understand, that we must do our duty; and no sensible man can take offence at
  that."</p>

  <p>While the senior partner spoke, Mr. Emblin fingered the little golden
  horse-shoe, in his white cravat&mdash;which was all the gamesomeness he dared
  to carry about him in office-hours&mdash;and fixed his eyes as keenly upon
  Gaston, as if he were the Derby, or a great sculling match. Also, Mr. Snacks
  was regarding him, as sharply as if he had been a share-list. And Gaston
  detested to be stared at.</p>

  <p>"How much more of this?" cried he, with his furious temper leaping forth
  his eyes, and his broad face in a blaze again; "you are taking a little too
  much upon yourselves, with some dirty paper, you have forged. Quips, and
  quirks, and Does and Roes, and d&mdash;d rogues all the lot of you. I'll tell
  you what I'll do, to settle it. I'll kick out you two thieves myself; and
  fetch up a scullery-wench, to put out this old ass, with the shoe-paste, who
  is too weak for me to handle. Pull up your coat-tails, you two sneaks; and
  give me a fair run at you."</p>

  <p>"Try it with me first;" said Mr. Emblin, calmly. He was not a weak man,
  though of slighter build than Gaston.</p>

  <p>"Allow me first honour," cried the ever ready Shacks; "here I am, sir;
  kick me out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gaston could have done it, without much trouble, and began to make a
  mad charge at him. But suddenly, his face turned purple-black, his closed
  fists fell at his side, and his thick red neck could not support his head.
  Down he fell upon the floor, with a crash that shook the room; the fire of
  his rolling eyes went out, like a spark from a chimney vanishing; and a gush
  of bright blood, from mouth and nostrils, dyed the broad plaits of his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Run for a doctor;" cried Mr. Latimer, "give me that cushion; keep his
  head up; cut his collar open with your pen-knife. Oh dear, oh dear, what
  mischief comes of taking the law into one's own hands!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch47"
     id="ch47">CHAPTER XLVII. &mdash; SHORT MEASURES NEEDFUL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">However, on the whole, it seemed at first, as if Mr. Gaston
  could scarcely have done better, in this risky coil of things, than go off
  both his head and feet, and become a helpless patient.</p>

  <p>Whenever a man is ill, (however he may have earned his illness,) a fount
  of pity, and good will, arises, in the breasts of all, who are not brutes.
  Especially, when he is a man of strength and power, that seemed to defy small
  ailment, people (conscious of their own more common weakness) feel for him
  kindly, and put off hard measures, with the popular spirit of fair-play.</p>

  <p>Mr. Latimer had a most amiable heart; Mr. Emblin, though sharper, was not
  hard. As soon as the doctor had pronounced, that further excitement must
  prove fatal, and that nothing but the free flow of blood had saved his
  patient from a fatal stroke, the lawyers resolved to proceed with their duty,
  as tenderly as possible. The best room in the house, and all its comforts,
  were placed at the service of the steward; and every one was to attend to his
  orders, as if he had been the master still. None of his seals were removed,
  but those of the firm were placed beside them; and everything was done, as if
  it still were doubtful, who might be the true executor.</p>

  <p>The old earl was buried, with a quiet happy funeral, in the heart of his
  land, and among the bones of his forefathers. All the servants had good
  mourning, and were ordered to be patient, in the question of their legacies,
  until the law said, whether they were to have them. Neither did the public,
  for some days, hear "of the heavy loss it had sustained;" but sustained it,
  without knowing it</p>

  <p>Although Mrs. Giblets, and her daughter Mary, were beginning to pack up
  for Exeter, they had bought such a number of things in London, to give to
  every friend they could call to mind, and to last on the mantel-piece for
  ever, that Mr. Snacks had to fetch down, from his cock-loft, every ancient
  port-mantle that would hold together. Mr. Snacks, every morning of his life,
  declared, that write he would to brother Tucker, that same day, and no
  mistake. But every day, when he was girt up to do it, Mrs. Snacks implored
  him, to wait just till to-morrow; it was so inhospitable, and downright
  unlucky, to write in front of people, who were leaving your own house. She
  had known a bridegroom, and bride, and a baby, killed by flying against
  decency so. And that was before those temptations of the Lord, that he was
  always meddling with, began to boil on gridirons.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mrs. Tubbs held out such hopes of the great things, she could
  well do now (with purest honesty, and sense of trust) in the way of handy
  little things; which his poor sainted lordship had a hundred times assured
  her, that he should have no rest in his grave, if anybody else was to steal,
  and make away with&mdash;and after the way she had been spoken of, assert her
  right she would, concerning what never had been doubted of hitherto.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Giblets, in reply to this, was very careful what she said. She
  heartily desired a great many things, not only for the mantelpiece, but to
  set up Mary, in a thirty-pound house of her own, whenever she had sown her
  wild grass&mdash;which is perhaps the feminine of oats&mdash;and should come
  to see that young Jemmy Splinters, of the timber-yard, would make her a good
  husband. Mrs. Giblets smiled upon Jemmy's suit, for his father was down for
  Mayor of Exeter, which to her mind was next in county-dignity to the Mayor of
  Barnstaple. But Mary, as yet, turned her pretty nose up at him; because he
  had no whiskers. But her mother was confident, that these would come, with
  the bottles she had seen at the London hairdressers, whereof she had
  collected a fine store for him; and then Mary, who was reasonable, must give
  way.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gaston entered into none of these niceties of behaviour. Being ordered
  to keep his head well up (not only in figure of speech, but of body), he sat
  in the earl's long cushioned chair&mdash;a chair as extinct as pig-tails now.
  It was a wonderfully easy chair; and a natural mind (however active) would
  have gone to sleep in it, after so much loss of blood. But Mr. Gaston was not
  of a nature, that could at all be counted on. Whatever thing he ought to
  do&mdash;not from a moral point of view, but according to analysis, or
  synthesis, or human diathesis, or anything else, whereby philosophers guide,
  explain, and actuate human action&mdash;that thing was the very last that he
  would do.</p>

  <p>He should now have been thankful (not only as a duty, but as a necessity
  of nature), to Latimer and Emblin, to Mrs. Tubbs (who brought him up good
  soup, made with her own hand, little as he deserved it of her), and even to
  Mr. Snacks, who tried, with a hundred horse-power of charity, to doubt of his
  villainy, because he was so ill.</p>

  <p>But he was not half so ill, as they supposed, and as he wished them to
  suppose. With the strength of will, which always helped him, and had made him
  what he was, he fetched his mind back, to meet his troubles, and his bodily
  power, to be up and doing. There was not a day to be lost, nor an hour to
  spare; if he hoped to save himself. Any minute, the jump of events might
  catch him, and the crash of his character bury him. Was he to lie there, and
  await the stroke; or strike for himself, as he used to do?</p>

  <p>His pride in himself, and contempt of mankind awoke, as he thought of his
  enemies; and he rang for three new-laid eggs, a long glass, and a bottle of
  Solera. He broke the raw eggs into the big deep tumbler, filled up with wine,
  and swirling round the mixture, gulped it off, and flung the tumbler at the
  doctor's bottles.</p>

  <p>"I am your lord," he shouted to old Jenkins, who was wondering whether it
  would kill him; "if you want to escape the workhouse, Jenkins, your only
  chance is to stick to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord! yes, sir, I should say. I did hear, the last thing
  was&mdash;that you was to have the property."</p>

  <p>"Right enough. No doubt of that. Why you know it, you old fool. Who signed
  his lordship's will but you, last week, at Mr. Foil's desire!"</p>

  <p>The old man rubbed his eyes, and thought; and then he said; "I
  disremember; things go through my head so, now. But I have heard say, that
  you can't sign, without forfeiting of legacies. And we was told there was
  £50, old and young, for all of us. Disappointing, after fifty years, sir;
  disappointing, I do say. But if my three young grandsons gets it, the same as
  their old granny, we must try to put up with it, sir, forgetting of the
  merits of the family. The Lord hath justice in his eyes. Though would a'been
  a fairer thing to think on&mdash;£200 to me, and their share
  independent."</p>

  <p>"So it would be. It is very hard upon you, my old friend, after so many
  years, and all you have been trusted with. To give Tubbs a thousand pounds,
  and you fifty, is an insult as well as a robbery, but under the will you
  signed, there was the power to me, and the order to me, to divide a thousand
  pounds among the servants, according to my own judgment. And the first thing
  I should do, would be to pay you down £500; to do whatever you like
  with."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I'm sure I don't know nothing. The times is so much against us
  all. They tell me, it will come to a fight of lawyers; and not a honest soul
  get a sixpence of it."</p>

  <p>"That's a heap of lies. We can keep out the lawyers, and all the pack of
  robbers round us, and do proper justice to the old retainers, by establishing
  the rightful will. Why, you must remember signing it, no longer ago than
  Wednesday week? Call upon your memory, Jenkins; you will have to swear to it.
  Are they all off now, to the funeral?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, all gone. Only three carriages! Why there was six, when the
  young lord died, and that was called out at, for shabbiness. Nothing is ever
  done now, as used to be. They asked me to go; but I said, 'no, thank you; not
  behind less than four horses, to disgrace myself.' Five and thirty miles to
  travel<i>;</i> and only the hearse, and one carriage, have got four!"</p>

  <p>"They will come back by rail. But they won't be here, till six or seven,
  this evening. I feel better; I shall take a little walk in the garden. Keep
  the rest of the servants indoors, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Bless my poor old bones, sir, you must never think of doing that! Why, if
  anything was to happen to you, Mr. Gaston, how should we ever get our
  money?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous, old chap. I am better. I feel as strong as a horse
  again. Stick by me, and I will stick by you. Jenkins, they want to give me
  the sack; because I am too honest for them. And they want to do the same with
  you. Your interest is bound up with mine. We shall beat them. Never fear. You
  know what thieves those lawyers are. They want to throw it all into Chancery;
  and then no one gets twopence, except themselves. But they reckon without
  their host, old boy. Tubbs is gone to the funeral, of course. Tubbs is a spy;
  and she wants to rob you, and your grandsons, and every one of us. Such
  things make me ill, to think of. I must go, for a breath of air. Let no one
  know, that I have left my room. You get away, and have a bottle of port wine.
  They never even offered you a glass, I'll be bound. A nice way to conduct a
  funeral!"</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, Gaston, with a large cloak on, and a strong oak stick to
  lean upon, slipped out of the door in the ivied wall, found a cab, and drove
  off to Hunter Street, and thence to an alley called 'Bishop's Gardens;' where
  he knocked at the door of Mr. Foil, a lawyer not too legitimate. That
  gentleman, with large-viewed discretion, was not to be caught, in his first
  blush, at home; but gradually came down to that condition, after long
  mediation of a boy, who could be trusted, because his name was 'Bill
  Foil.'</p>

  <p>"I thought you would never come down; and I have not a moment to waste,"
  said Gaston; "how can you be so hard up as all this?"</p>

  <p>"Hospitality! hospitality, my good sir; you can understand it. It has
  brought down our family to answer their own bell. And yet with my abilities,
  experience, and character, any day we may go up; any day we may look down
  upon our enemies."</p>

  <p>"Meaning the fools, who have given you credit. Send away that grinning
  brat of yours; I want to speak to you quietly. Have you any place free from
  listeners?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Foil, with a pleasant wink; "you know what my love of
  silence is&mdash;surpassed, my good sir, by my love of nothing, except
  sterling honesty; of which I regard you as the champion."</p>

  <p>"Among the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Your clients are a shady lot,
  I fear. Well, here we are snug; and let us have no humbug. You remember this
  will, which you prepared, and attested, together with the shaky old butler,
  when the earl was in his right mind, and knew his meaning? Thieves have got
  hold of him since, in my absence, and have made him sign something
  scandalous. Downright robbery; and honest men should leave no stone unturned
  to baffle it. I would rather pay a thousand pounds, than knock under to such
  villainy. Now don't begin to talk about caveats, tedious law-suits, and all
  that. The remedy is short and simple; if we are resolved to have our rights,
  and sweep aside wretched formalities. To make a man do what he meant to do;
  as long as he knew his own poor mind."</p>

  <p>"That question will be for a jury, I fear; and it always is a most
  ticklish one. A thousand pounds is but a drop in the ocean, when we come to
  fight a will."</p>

  <p>"I know that; and the reason is plain&mdash;because it goes into so many
  pockets. But a thousand pounds in one man's pocket, without a farthing to pay
  out, and with plenty of legal pickings to come, is enough to make one labour
  for the right."</p>

  <p>"Put it plainly," said Mr. Foil; "What am I to do, for the thousand
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>"As simple a thing as you ever did; and a thing as truly respectable. The
  will is dated 7th of May; it ought to be 7th of September."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a bold one, Mr. Gaston! Transportation for life is what it
  comes to, on conviction. And to face it out, with that old Jenkins! Jenkins
  has no nerve at all."</p>

  <p>"All the better for that, you stupid. Jenkins is not certain now. He has
  no memory; but you have. Remind him of something he did that day; and that
  will prove it to him. There is nothing like a fine old fool, to baffle the
  sharpest lawyers. Make an entry in your day-book, under 7th of
  Sept.&mdash;'Prepared, and attested Earl Delapole's will;' and out with the
  leaf of the 7th of May. It will not take them by surprise; for I have
  prepared their minds for it. I told them, when they produced their will, that
  I had one of later date; and was going to submit it to a lawyer. Enter my
  visit to you to-day&mdash;'Mr. Gaston, to consult me about the recent will.'
  Make me a copy, to flourish before them, with the date Sept. 7th. I shall not
  let them have it in their hands. They will take it for the original; it will
  be in the same handwriting; and when they come to see the real thing, they
  will believe, and I shall swear, that it never has been out of my possession;
  unless they stole it, while I was ill. You know plenty of fellows, who can
  take out ink, without a sign. Make one of them do it, upon something else,
  for a test of skill: and steal some of his stuff. Don't let him see the will,
  of course. Nothing can be easier; and you see, the date occurs but once."</p>

  <p>"The cash is not sufficient, to sustain one's conscience, in a task like
  this. There may be justice in it; but her scale must have more weight than
  that."</p>

  <p>"I knew that you would try to drive me. But remember that, happen what
  will, not an acre of the land will ever come to me. All that is in
  settlement, and goes with the title. Why, if I get my rights, you must know
  as well as I do, it will scarcely come to fifteen thousand; including the old
  house, which is unsettled. I will give you ten per cent.; fifteen hundred
  that will be; five hundred, as soon as we can get probate, and the balance as
  soon as I realise. And here&mdash;you can have fifty on account, for
  expenses."</p>

  <p>This, as Gaston knew well enough, proved the most tempting bait of all. To
  a man who lives from hand to mouth&mdash;which is the true way to taste
  things, and to lick one's fingers deliciously&mdash;the ninepence on the nail
  is more than the noble in the neighbourhood. Mr. Foil put his hand out; and
  the rest was a question of detail.</p>

  <p>"Only one thing must be certain. Without one assurance, I do nothing,"
  said Foil, at the end of a longish talk, "and that is that the new man must
  not turn up. If once he gets to London, all is over. He lives in some
  outlandish part, and he has not heard of these things yet; according to your
  account of him. If once he appears, it is all over with one's desire to do
  justice. The lawyers will be as keen as cats, in their obsequiousness to him.
  I know what a difference it makes, when a man attends to his own work. All
  will be sifted; nothing will pass muster. Seals will be broken, accounts
  pried into, dates raked up, and the deuce knows what. Their place is to fetch
  him, without losing a day. And how do you know, that they have not done it?
  You may find him in the house, when you get home now."</p>

  <p>"No fear of that. I have masked him well," Mr. Gaston answered, with an
  easy smile. "Those old fools may have tried to find him out; and find him
  out, in the end, they must. But it won't be done in a day, I can assure you.
  I can promise you at least a week, without him."</p>

  <p>"A week is not enough; nor yet a month. You know how slowly the law moves.
  It is not himself, that we need fear; for, from all that you say, he is an
  idiot. But it is the effect, that his presence would have. You know all about
  him. You must contrive to keep him away, for at least three months. Nothing
  can keep him from the land, and the title. But if we get probate, we may snap
  our fingers at him, as regards the part that concerns us. You can realise
  everything, and be off."</p>

  <p>"My good fellow," said Gaston roughly; "leave that part of the affair to
  me. Brace up your mind, and this little document, to the correct chronology.
  I will take this copy, with the proper date upon it; and expect you with the
  real thing, to-morrow. Then I shall place you as my agent in possession, and
  set off westward, to confront the foe. I feel quite confident of defeating
  all their tricks, crafty humbugs as they are. Now keep yourself stiff. Do
  your work, and earn your money. That has always been my rule in life."</p>

  <p>He got into a cab, and was enraged to hear a nasty buzzing in his ears, a
  sound as of a hive of bees, at sunset, after a busy August day. "Pest upon
  the doctor. His filthy drugs fizz in my brain. He has made me like an old
  jakes of eighty. If it were not for that beastly Devonshire job, I would sham
  for a week, and they would dare touch nothing. Ha, a fine idea! With young
  Mills to help me, and Sarah, and old Jenkins, I might be gone three days,
  before they found it out; and three days ought to cook his goose for him.
  Think, think, think! Dash me, if I can think! I must have a flip to my
  system."</p>

  <p>Returning to his room unseen&mdash;for some of the servants were gone to
  the funeral, and the rest were drinking their good health&mdash;he obtained
  his flip, in the form of half a tumblerful of Irish whisky; and then with all
  his colour restored, and even heightened, sat down to consider his urgent
  condition. He was playing a desperate game, as he knew, and one that required
  even more of luck, than skill; but either he must play it on, for some stages
  further, or fly at once, a beggared, and a banished thief.</p>

  <p>In the days, when he might have laid up store, from the proceeds of
  embezzlement, he had spent as fast as he stole, being even more a gambler
  than a niggard. He had taken time by the forelock now, so far as to seize and
  hide the cash-box, before the intrusion of lawyers; but fully confiding in
  his own position, he had not destroyed all the proofs of his robberies; but
  had sealed up many things, and so got them sealed against him, into which he
  should rather have dipped his fingers. Mr. Latimer had left a trusty agent in
  possession; and Gaston could get hold of nothing for the moment, good enough
  to run away with, and forego all chance of further booty. Therefore, he must
  carry on for the present, taking his stand upon, and maintaining the will of
  which he was executor; until it should come to the test of a law-court; by
  which time he might be prepared to retire, with competent pickings, if danger
  arose. Of course, Mr. Foil would never get more than the £50 he had jumped
  at; unless things went so smoothly, that the proving of the will might pass,
  without challenge, or by compromise.</p>

  <p>First and foremost of all was this&mdash;to prevent the arrival of the
  present earl, alias Captain Larks, alias Mr. Arthur. He might be an idiot, as
  Mr. Foil had said; but such is the enthusiasm of the English mind, that great
  people generally may lose their wits, without loss of the worship paid to
  them. So if Captain Larks now were to march up the big stairs, with a basket
  of apples on his shoulder&mdash;which he was capable (in body and in mind) of
  doing, and of whittling all the way&mdash;every mind, and body, in the house
  would knock the doors down, with joy, and acclamation, and my duty to your
  lordship. For still there lingered among them legendary lore concerning
  him.</p>

  <p>But the wily Gaston&mdash;who, but for his violent temper, might have been
  a first-rate rogue, equal to any of this finer generation&mdash;had so
  contrived things, that Latimer and Emblin (although, no longer ago than last
  May, they had written to Captain Larks, direct by post, as "L. Arthur,
  Esquire," and had received&mdash;as they supposed&mdash;his answer) sent off
  in the wrong direction now, to find that newly important client. In their
  books was the copy of their letter, addressed to him at "Christowell, near
  Exeter," followed by the entry of that very rude reply; a copy whereof had
  been sent to the old earl, and had driven him to execute that hasty will
  against him. To Gaston, however, it was undesirable, that they should
  preserve the correct address, which he had given them for his own purpose;
  and therefore he had said, "It was a wonder almost that your letter ever
  found him. Nobody ever calls it 'Christowell,' now; though that may have been
  the old name of it. 'Carswell' is the pronunciation, and the mode of spelling
  now in vogue." Upon this, Mr. Latimer, void as yet of all suspicion, had
  carefully erased, (with penknife and with pounce, in the diligent manner of a
  fine old firm) the genuine name of that very happy village; and had set it
  down as "Carswell." Now there are three Carswells (as Mr. Gaston knew, having
  taken the trouble to find out this) in the region of Devon, round about the
  loyal city; and perhaps there may be more. At any rate, the missive, or the
  messenger, would have to exhaust first Carswell proper, which is a hamlet
  near Honiton, and then King's Carswell, and then Abbot's Carswell, which are
  in the neighbourhood of Torquay; and when that was painfully done in vain (by
  means of cross-country lanes, and rough hirings), it would have to be
  reported, and fresh instructions waited for.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," thought Mr. Gaston, "short measures are needful. I shall cut
  down straight, screw Wenlow to the sticking-point at once; and then come
  back, to meet scandal at my leisure. Who cares what is done in those wild
  parts? That gardener must be sent to the garden of Eden. The people in the
  distance, the far-off cousins, are a poor lot, who will jump at their good
  luck, and be easy enough to handle."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch48"
     id="ch48">CHAPTER XLVIII. &mdash; A STROKE OF BUSINESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is all very well, for strong-willed people, to stand up
  for their rights, and to kick against their wrongs, and to shove the world
  out of its way, to get their own. But how much more worthy of consideration
  (and therefore how much less likely to get it) are they, who being of a
  weak-willed sort, rejoice in the joys of the good folk around them, and
  soothe their own woes, with the woes of others!</p>

  <p>Dicky Touchwood was under urgent orders, to render himself up, on Monday
  morning, without more clothes than he could put upon his back, to the driest
  of all the dry-salters of Plymouth, Mr. Growgray of Stonehouse Wall. Dicky
  had neither strong mind, nor strong will, nor anything else very strong about
  him; except the desire to be pleased, and as an echo (weaker, but generally
  on the premises, when the weather permitted it) a desire to please all who
  pleased him; and the echo's main refrain was, "Beer&mdash;beer, after the
  rain, and beer again&mdash;let nobody ask for beer, in vain."</p>

  <p>This form of sympathy is perhaps of all sympathies the noblest. It touches
  a key&mdash;the tap-key perhaps&mdash;of the human system, which frees the
  best mind, and speeds the quickest thrill, through the human barrel, up to
  its oral vent-peg. When it was reported, at Touchwood Park, before
  service-time on Sunday, that Squire Dicky was to be turned out, and sent into
  a bacon-shop&mdash;for that was what it came to&mdash;there was not a man,
  and much more a woman, in, or around the park, and belonging to it, who did
  not cry scandal, and get up before eleven A.M. to behold it.</p>

  <p>Dicky was the hero of the day, and felt it. Instead of withdrawing from
  the public gaze, he put on his brightest apparel, and went to church, with
  some fine independent farmers, who cared not a snap for Sir Joseph. "We'll
  see you through it, sir; you keep your back up," was the comfort and the
  counsel, he received on every side; and several young ladies, who had thought
  him "rather fast," longed to kiss him in the absence of witnesses.</p>

  <p>"Am I to be debarred from my own son?" Lady Touchwood asked, with
  concentrated essence of pathos, in her voice, and eyes. "Shall he be torn
  from my arms, before I have fitted up his dressing-case? Oh, Sir Joseph, you
  are a wilful man, and you always have your own sad way! But reflect, I
  implore you; ponder, I implore you, the results of this sudden, and
  outrageous whim."</p>

  <p>"It is not sudden; and it is no whim. I have had it in my mind, for
  months. You know nothing of the circumstances. The boy wants pulling down; we
  all want pulling down; and now we shall have it, with a vengeance. To-morrow,
  I shall see the auctioneer, about selling this place, this gilded millstone
  round my neck, which has been the ruin of me; and off we go into lodgings at
  Plymouth."</p>

  <p>"After all we have done, to be a credit to you!" Her ladyship burst into a
  wild flood of tears. Through all the hot weather, she had kept her temper, in
  her daughter's absence, so that she scarcely knew herself; and this was all
  the reward she got! But Sir Joseph had nothing more to say. He had put on the
  shabbiest clothes, he could find&mdash;and he had some of most friendly
  shabbiness&mdash;although it was Sunday, and he ought to go to church, at
  least once, for the sake of example. He treated his partner in life to a
  sniff, which meant, "You may cry away, as long as it amuses you;" and then he
  walked off to his own little room, and locked himself up, with some
  cash-books he had brought.</p>

  <p>"He may starve, if he likes; but you don't catch me at it," Squire Dicky
  exclaimed, when his sister brought him word, that the table was not to be
  laid for dinner; "I suppose he's broke at last. I have always been expecting
  it; and that has made me so thrifty. I heard an old chap at Cambridge
  say&mdash;'chousing, and carousing, leads to out-housing,' and we shall all
  have to turn out to-morrow. Not that we have had much carousing, however.
  What blunt have you got to begin the world with, Judy?"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to tell you," his sister answered; "you'd get it all out
  of me, and spend it, before the shops were open."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you what to do. Marry old Short, and make a crib for us.
  I don't approve of the 'wide, wide world.' And a dry-salter I never will be;
  I never will be a dry-salter; sooner would I lose my liberty, by putting my
  neck into a halter. There, I made that in church to-day, with the ladies
  admiring my waistcoat. Not so dusty, for your most obedient!"</p>

  <p>"Adversity will indeed have sweet uses, if it fetches your slang out of
  you. But in reward for your brilliant stanza, I will invite you to dinner
  to-day. In my room at six o'clock. Mother will be there. She has been crying
  so, and she looks so poorly, that I cannot ask your friend. He must think he
  has fallen among strange people, to get no dinner for two days."</p>

  <p>"Not he! He is a gentleman, and regards it as one of the many ups, and
  downs, of trade. He knows, that we are only tradespeople, and must dine upon
  the counter, when the business is pressing. I have told him that we always do
  it, when the ships are sailing, for fear of his being uncomfortable. He says
  that he enjoys it; but he must be off this evening, by the mail from
  Ashburton."</p>

  <p>"If there is anything I detest," Miss Touchwood answered, with a tranquil
  brow, "it is to hear of trade continually. Trade is such a low thing;
  commerce is the proper word; and even that has nothing lofty in it Make your
  friend understand, before he goes (if so stupid a gentleman can understand)
  that my father has nothing to do with either trade, or commerce; but is
  simply and solely, a government contractor, moving in a very wide circle,
  discharging duties of the first magnitude, and commanding European
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"I had better chalk it up, to have it right this time. I'll tell him all
  that, on the way to the coach; and then at the tail of it, I shall stick in,
  'but the governor's busted up now, and must go back to the apron he began
  with, in the lollipop shop at Plymouth.'"</p>

  <p>"There will not be any dinner in my room to-day." Miss Touchwood spoke
  with dignity; and departed, to preserve it.</p>

  <p>That stern announcement compelled the young squire, to hasten to his
  mother's room; which he had shunned, all day, through terror of maternal
  outburst. But now he must try hard to get dinner, both for himself, and for
  his guest, who was being dismissed so curtly. And in that just enterprise he
  succeeded, to and beyond his warmest hopes; for her ladyship, having allowed
  herself to be trampled on so shamefully, was now in the growing tumult of
  recovery, and reaction.</p>

  <p>"Sir Joseph is master of the dining-room," she said, after bedewing her
  son, with one of the last tears left in her system; "in all high circles, the
  master of the house is the master of the dining-room. But feminine,&mdash;or
  perhaps rather I should say, according to the way in which you look at
  it&mdash;masculine licence stops there, my dear. Good society has always
  maintained, as one of its first rules of existence, that the drawing-room is
  the ladies' realm. There they may do anything they like, among themselves,
  without being interfered with. They may lock the doors, they may play
  pianoforte, they may order up anything from the cellar, that&mdash;that they
  can get the keys to. When your father built this house&mdash;and I am sure, I
  wish that he had never done it, to be a 'millstone round his neck,' and to
  turn us, neck and crop, out of it&mdash;I took the trouble to buy a book,
  laying down the laws about great people, their rooms, and their dress, and
  their habits of feeding, and the way they behave to one another, and to the
  people they have nothing to do with. I knew it all, well enough, being of a
  highly respectable family myself, my dear; as you may find yet, if your poor
  father goes to prison; but it is a great point to have anything printed,
  because it must be impartial. Therefore, I shall order you some dinner in the
  drawing-room, and come myself to see you eat it; and you will be welcome to
  bring in that large young man from Trinity&mdash;this trouble has driven his
  name out of my head&mdash;I mean, of course, the one whose bottles your dear
  papa kicked over."</p>

  <p>This was managed well; and Julia, proud but not relentless, came; and the
  large young man from Trinity, sighed, according to his magnitude, whenever he
  could sigh aside. For not only was he large, but tender; and the pricks of
  the barb, that were meant to sting him, had acted as with a good
  rumpsteak&mdash;they had only made him sweeter. But feeling that he had no
  money, he sighed behind his handkerchief. Julia gave him several glances, in
  her well experienced style, soft, and rich, and to be cherished; so that his
  heart might ache quite nicely, when he was a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>Lady Touchwood saw all this, and thought that her daughter should not be
  so cruel, even on a Sunday; the best day of the seven by rights; but the
  worst in fact of cruelty. For then, do schoolboys bully most; then do men
  most beat their wives; and then are all the great battles fought. And then
  Sir Joseph Touchwood raged, because he had little else to do.</p>

  <p>When Dicky came home, in a gloomy mood, after seeing the last of his
  friend and hero, his mother watched for him, and found time to say a few
  words privately. "You are ordered to go away, tomorrow; and you must show
  obedience. Your father is in a very dreadful state; through some heavy
  losses. He cannot be contradicted now; and I have borne with him, like an
  angel. But as for your going to that dry-salter, it shall never be, while I
  have breath. Bring me the bag you put your beer in, for your sporting
  expeditions, the one you strap across your back; and I will put you up some
  things. And then you shall have a good hot breakfast, and set off for
  Christowell, before your father comes downstairs. I have written a letter to
  Mr. Short, begging him to be most careful about the airing of your bed. I
  have asked him to ride over here, as early as ever he can do it, and to come
  in by the stable-way. He will comfort me; he always does, because he knows my
  nature; and I shall endeavour to make him useful, as he always likes to be.
  It would not do to write it down; but you might say (if he should happen to
  ask) that poor Julia is in great distress, and has no one to rely upon."</p>

  <p>Smelling a rat, as he coarsely put it to himself, the young man obeyed,
  and on the Monday morning knocked at the vicarage door, with his knapsack on,
  when the parson was sitting down to breakfast. "Well done! We shall have an
  earthquake now," said Mr. Short, as Dicky marched in, with some contempt for
  people, who were just come down to breakfast; "in the name of wonder, what
  has made a lark, of such a lie-a-bed?" Then Dicky sat down, and told his tale
  and produced his mother's letter. In an hour's time, before Sir Joseph had
  his sulky meal upstairs, Parson short was holding council with the lady of
  the house. "I have no real friend, but you; and you always know what to do,"
  she added, after full detail of woes.</p>

  <p>The vicar knew little of commercial matters, and even less of heavy
  contracts, handled like a balanced pole, which may crack the operator's
  skull. But having shrewd sense, and more doubt of Sir Joseph's truth, than of
  his skill, he thought it most unlikely that the great contractor had lost his
  balance, beyond all recovery. "It is but a trick of his," he thought, "to get
  out of some bad job." But he could not say that, to Sir Joseph's wife.</p>

  <p>"It will all come right; depend upon it, with patience, it will all come
  right." He smiled as he spoke, for Lady Touchwood's faith in his wisdom was
  amusing. "But what can I do, without the risk of fatal offence to Sir Joseph?
  He is not the man to put up with any meddling by&mdash;by a stranger almost
  to him, although an old friend of yours, and eager to be of any use to
  him."</p>

  <p>"No," said the lady; "I quite see that. Nobody would think of meddling
  with him. But it might be possible perhaps to ascertain what the public
  opinion is about it."</p>

  <p>Public opinion had not yet arrived at its present condition of debility,
  when it goes with the pull of some sledge-dog journals, or the push of the
  man who can swear the hardest. Therefore Mr. Short did not disdain it; but
  asked&mdash;"where is it to be got?"</p>

  <p>"Only in Plymouth," said Lady Touchwood, "and I can't bear to think of
  such a thing."</p>

  <p>"Of such a thing as my going to Plymouth? Why, what is that for
  <i>Trumpeter</i>? About two-and-twenty miles, by the Post-bridge road; and he
  can have three hours' rest, while I lounge about, and call upon some friends.
  I know a man who knows everything, about the business-people&mdash;I mean the
  highest mercantile circles&mdash;and without an inkling of my object, I can
  learn&mdash;you will under-stand."</p>

  <p>"Whether my husband is bankrupt, and the roof over our heads our own, or
  not. Oh, Mr. Short, what a blessed, happy, thing it is, to be in the Church
  of England! There you can do what you like; you have your own parsonage, and
  your own opinions, and your own time to do nothing. Everybody looks up to
  you; and you go out in the morning, to see what the people are about; or not
  to see it, if you don't like. You order your dinner, and they send you
  presents; and you think how much work you have done! No wonder you are wise;
  no wonder you can advise poor women well."</p>

  <p>The parson laughed; though he could not think that this description of his
  duty did fair justice to his trials, and earnest labours to be master of the
  parish. But he knew that nothing can change a lady's opinion upon great
  subjects (any more than it can upon little ones), and so he slacked
  <i>Trumpeter's</i> curb three links, for a long day's work, and mounted.</p>

  <p>"This is a new turn of things, and a very nasty one to my mind," he
  thought, as he struck from a bridle-lane, up a combe, into the old Roman
  road; "who can make either head, or tail, of the things that may come out of
  it? That I should be put to discover the state of Sir Joseph's affairs, for
  his wife's satisfaction! I should have declined such a ticklish errand. It
  will require the greatest tact, and what I detest&mdash;some subterfuge. But
  he must be almost a brute, to keep his own wife and children, in the dark. He
  is playing some deep game, and recks not a rap, how wretched he makes them,
  to suit his own ends. Perhaps my first impulse, was right; but now, right or
  wrong, I must go through with it. Go along, <i>Trumpeter;</i> we are on a
  smooth road now."</p>

  <p>The worthy horse put his best foot foremost, for his spirit was willing,
  and his flesh not weak; so that they were both in Devon-port, ere the
  dockyard-men streamed forth to dinner; which is a date of the day to be
  trusted, for rapid punctuality. Then the parson, having seen his horse in
  comfort, and kindly receiving nourishment, called upon a quiet man, a
  Christowellian, own cousin to Mrs. Aggett's relicks&mdash;as she called her
  dear dead husband&mdash;and now rising steadily into social excellence, as a
  widely esteemed ship's chandler. His name was Codd, and he was mounting into
  such a sphere of wholesale merit, that he was beginning to nod to Sir Joseph,
  instead of touching his hat to him, and had even shaken hands with him, at
  Christmas times. But he did not pretend to be on a par with the vicar of the
  parish he was born in.</p>

  <p>"Servant, sir," he said to Mr. Short, touching his forelock, like a
  Sunday-school boy; "glad to see 'e, once again, sir. And how are all the good
  folk up to home, like?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, considering the long dry weather. I never saw the moor so
  parched before. Our people say, that Colonel Westcombe's grouse have done it.
  But I want a little talk with you, Master Codd."</p>

  <p>Codd was a simple, straightforward fellow, getting on slowly, by dint of
  downright honesty, attention to business, and heed of ancient maxims. Mrs.
  Codd (who had been a housemaid at Lustleigh, wooed by Codd with his apron on)
  happened to be upstairs, engaged in the periodic increase of an honest race;
  and so there was freedom of tongue, and of ears.</p>

  <p>"I hope you may be wrong," said Mr. Short, as soon as he had heard the
  other's story, which came without any questions, for the subject was hot,
  that day, in Plymouth; "and I cannot help thinking you must be wrong. Sir
  Joseph Touchwood, after all his years of dexterity, and of experience, should
  be about the last man in the kingdom, to break up suddenly, as you
  describe."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I only know what I hear tell; and I heartily hope it may be
  wrong. Many a poor head will ache, and many a poor belly quag, if it is so
  bad as they tell me. And I am sorry for the poor folk round our parish. Sir
  Joseph hath found work for a sight of 'em, in the winter-time; so the people
  tell me. He mightn't be altogether honest; but he hath been honourable. And
  if he hath failed, you may say for certain, he hath failed respectably."</p>

  <p>"That means for a big lump of money. The morals of trade are wonderful.
  Tell me, Codd, since it is town-talk now, where I shall have the best chance
  of correct particulars."</p>

  <p>Mr. Codd told him; and the parson, with excitement most unusual with him
  (because he was full of things larger than money), hastened to the gentleman,
  who knew all about it, according to his own belief, and that of all the
  public. This gentleman was not inclined however to impart the smallest
  decimal of his knowledge; until Mr. Short spoke very plainly to him, and
  declared that he was likely to be involved in it. It then became the duty of
  the businessman, to come down with the truth, to the utmost of his knowledge;
  and the parson thanked him, and went to fetch his horse.</p>

  <p>Then his horse fetched him, at such a pace (because he was on the homeward
  road, and his shoes were got into wearing) that it was not dark to a
  clear-eyed man, when the parson of Christowell pulled the bell of the great
  front-door of the Touchwood house. "I want to see your master himself," he
  said. "You can't see Sir Joseph, sir, I fear, just now. He is not very well
  to-day, and he keeps his room." "Then let me see him in his room. I simply
  insist upon seeing him. Show me where he is, without any message."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed, for he held Mr. Short in some awe, for various reasons;
  and presently the vicar was face to face with the great contractor, in his
  private room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Short? Ah!" Sir Joseph spoke mildly, after closing his mighty oak
  desk with a bang, to indicate sense of intrusion. "Important business, Mr.
  Short?"</p>

  <p>"That depends entirely upon how you take it. You may think me troublesome,
  but not, I trust, impertinent, when you have heard what I have to say."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, and say it, my good sir. You are the last man to be
  impertinent."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You are a man of business, Sir Joseph; and so am I, in my
  little way. To-day I happened to be in Plymouth"&mdash;Mr. Short coloured, at
  this highly-coloured version of the fact&mdash;"and there I heard things
  which grieved me. I heard that your firm, the first in the West of England,
  was in difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they say that, do they? Very well; supposing it to be so, we are not
  in your debt, that I am aware of."</p>

  <p>"No, you owe nothing to me. But I owe something to you, after many years
  of hospitality and kindness. And now you can do me another kindness, by
  letting me make a good investment. I have long been looking for a sound
  investment for £25,000, which came to me about two years ago. If I may place
  it, at fair interest with you, I shall be under a deep obligation."</p>

  <p>"What you mean to say is, that you will have placed me under a deep
  obligation."</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say. I have perfect confidence in your sagacity, and
  enterprise. I know that the sum which I mention is nothing in vast affairs,
  such as you conduct. But I wish to secure for myself a good chance; however
  selfish it may be of me. If you think five per cent. too much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fifty per cent would not be enough for money invested in a falling house.
  Sir, you have made me very grateful to you, for your faith in me, and most
  friendly offer. I shall never forget it, while I live; for not one of my best
  friends has come to do it. But I am happy to tell you, Mr. Short, that,
  although I have suffered serious loss, my business is as good as ever; and I
  can put a guinea on the top of every shilling I owe in the world. I tell you
  this, in strict confidence; for I wish to alarm my own family. It is high
  time to stop their most reckless profusion, and to pull them up sharply upon
  their marrow-bones. I have not said a word, that they can lay hold of; I have
  left both them, and the public, to form their own opinions, about my affairs;
  because it suits me, at this time, that both should be certain of my
  bankruptcy. Concerning the public, I will not tell you why, though it is a
  legitimate enterprise. But concerning my family, you know as well as I do,
  that they winnow my gatherings on every wind of whimsy. I have pulled them
  up, and I shall keep them so; if you respect my secret. It was my good wife,
  who sent you to Plymouth. Tell her exactly, what you heard there."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short was a little surprised, and showed it. He thought that he had
  got away most cleanly, on his Plymouth expedition, and accomplished it most
  cleverly. But here was the subject of it, looking at him, as if he had been
  the ordaining cause. Sir Joseph smiled, and took the upper hand again.</p>

  <p>"Tell her exactly what you heard; and let her have a night of it. I have
  had many a night of tossing, with the way they have scattered my substance.
  It is time for them to have a turn. I have not let even my daughter know. A
  man may be blown up with a ton of powder&mdash;such as I have just got on my
  books&mdash;and the women don't care what becomes of his pieces, if they can
  only pick his pocket up, with money for their laces, and ribbons in it.
  Short, you are very wise, to be a settled bachelor. Good-bye; I shall bear in
  mind your kindness though."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short disliked that reference to his present domestic condition; for
  if anything had moved him beyond the lines of prudence, to the tune of a
  quarter of a plum, surely it was not misogyny.</p>

  <p>But Sir Joseph shook his hand, more cordially than he had ever done
  before, and looked at him, with a deep gleam of heart in his well-worn eyes,
  so hard in general, and so bound in business vellum.</p>

  <p>"Henceforth, that man is my steadfast friend," thought the parson, as he
  went downstairs; "also he thinks highly of me, for having so much cash to
  spare. But my part is difficult, none the less. I must not allow it to be
  imagined&mdash;and then there is this puzzle, about poor Dicky. Ah, Lady
  Touchwood, well met indeed! I was coming to look for you quietly."</p>

  <p>Her ladyship thought he had just arrived, for she saw his horse, led to
  and fro by a groom. "Come in, and tell me all," she said; "I can bear the
  worst, better than this suspense."</p>

  <p>Being bound by her husband's confidence, he could tell her only what they
  said at Plymouth. But seeing her deep distress, he could not help adding some
  words of comfort.</p>

  <p>"You know that I do not say things rashly; I am sure, that all this is
  grossly magnified by malice and envy. You will see Sir Joseph rise above it,
  like a lion, or rather perhaps an eagle, and it will have done good to your
  spirited son, to be restricted for a while in cash, and credit, and sportive
  joys. I will feed him, as well as he ought to be fed, in the proper course of
  dry-salting; and I will borrow a gun, having only one left, and walk him off
  his legs with <i>Nous.</i> He shall stay with me, till this little breeze is
  over; for I am not afraid of Sir Joseph."</p>

  <p>"You are the best friend I have ever had. How could I compare Captain
  Larks to you? But do please to see that my darling boy puts his feet in hot
  water, for half an hour, every time he wets them. Oh, Mr. Short, you do
  manage people so, how I wish you had Julia to keep in order?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the parson, with a bright blush on his fair well-nourished
  countenance; "that is a happiness too high for me. But I would try to be
  equal to it, Lady Touchwood."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch49"
     id="ch49">CHAPTER XLIX. &mdash; CRANMERE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"'Tis a terrible rough road, sir," said the famous Mr.
  Perrott, of Chagford, not then so widely known as now, but already called
  'the Dartmoor-guide,' "or rather I should say, no road at all, after you be
  past Kestor rocks. But you can't miss the way, without a fog comes on; if you
  go according to my directions."</p>

  <p>"Thou art very accurate; and I am not a fool. After passing Kestor, I see
  Watern tor, about two miles to the west, the one with the hole in it, which
  thou sayest a man of great stature can ride through. When I get there, I go
  south-west, and cross the Walla brook, as thou hast called it, and then over
  some rough ground, to another little stream, which is the head-water of the
  Taw, and then over a hill, to Cranmere pool."</p>

  <p>"You've got it as right as can be, sir; but you can't get to Cranmere very
  well on horseback, even now that the bogs be down so. In the winter-time,
  'tis a bad job afoot; without you know the ground as I do. But now, if you go
  heedful, there isn't much to risk; for the oldest man never knew the moor to
  be dried up so. All the black places are safe enough now; for the crust is
  firm on the top of them. And wherever the rushes grow, you can step freely;
  but you must have a care of the bright green moss; for it won't hold a dog
  up, let alone a heavy man. But you better let me come with you, sir, though I
  am not very fond of Sunday-jobs. You may be within a score landyards of
  Cranmere, and never find 'un after all. I've known a party beat about the
  hill all day, and come home, and swear there was no Cranmere."</p>

  <p>"Spare me that rubbish, friend; unless thou art afraid, that this
  queer-looking horse of thine will break down."</p>

  <p>"<i>Charlie</i> break down! Not unless you throw him. <i>Charlie</i> will
  travel three-score miles a day, without bit or sup. He is true forest-breed.
  Only you put him up, where I told you. But mind you one thing. No weather
  won't hurt <i>Charlie;</i> but it may hurt you, sir. And to my mind, the
  weather will break up, before the day is out. The sky was all red in the
  east, last night; and the moon lay as flat as a frying-pan. 'Tis eight
  o'clock now; you should be there by eleven, allowing for roundabouts, and bad
  travel; be back here by three o'clock, if you can sir."</p>

  <p>The elderly gentleman, in outward semblance (who had slept last night at
  the <i>Three-crowns</i> Inn, and hired Mr. Perrott's best horse for the day),
  set off, without answer, at a good round trot; with the murky morning sun
  behind him, and the heavy dry air slowly waving the silvery locks, beneath
  his broad-brimmed hat. "Queer sort of a Quaker, to my opinion," the shrewd
  Perrott muttered, as he went back to breakfast; "I have heard say, that they
  take no heed of Sunday; but never, till now, that they can put away six
  rummers of hot brandy and water, in a hour and a half."</p>

  <p>That spirited explorer, Mr. Gaston, who had accomplished this feat last
  night, and now looked the soberest of the sober, rode on apace to the bridge
  across South Teign, and then through Teign-combe, to the foot of Kestor,
  where all road failed him, and the wild moor lay around. Then he pulled off
  his hot Quaker hat, and hotter wig (both of which he had bought at Exeter)
  and hiding them in a deep tuft of bracken, at the foot of a tall rock, which
  he would know again, wiped his warm forehead, and used hot language,
  concerning the state of the weather. For the glare of the scorched earth
  rose, like a blister, and the coppery clouds compressed it; and the sparkle
  of splintered and powdered granite, like glistening needles, pricked the
  eyes. Mr. Gaston's face came forth in spots, as his mind came out in tainted
  language; for which there is no space, but gaps. Then he drew from his pocket
  a folded cap, to cover his tawny cropped head from flies, and getting upon
  <i>Charlie,</i> set forth again.</p>

  <p>His landmarks were plain, and far too plain; as he might have known, if he
  had ever cared for nature. The delicate haze of fair-set weather (which had
  mantled the hills, for weeks and weeks, till the power of the sun dispersed
  it), was gone altogether, and the soft gaze of distance was shortened into a
  hard near stare. To the north, and west, the beetling slabs, and jags, and
  juts, of many a pile (Steperton, Mill-tor, Yes-tor, High Willhays, and others
  shouldering under them) seemed scarcely half a mile away, so clear was every
  seam and scrag. To the left, as he trudged up Okement hill, having left his
  horse in an old peat-hut, he could see the dark bulk of Fur-tor, the most
  lonely and dismal of all the moor, which even John Sage might tremble to
  approach, in the very bravest sunshine; for this is the haunt of the fiercest
  demons, that shriek along the windy waste, or howl in the morasses.</p>

  <p>Gaston was rather quick of step, for a man of ripe size, and no
  feather-weight; but he found the travelling full of travail, as he sought for
  "the mother of waters." It is generally supposed (with as much of truth as
  there is in general opinions) that five rivers have their fountains here; as
  if five Naiads could live together. But five get out of the ground, within
  the space of one square mile, perhaps; and the earth, in the power of such
  production, cracks and splits, like a thin-skinned fig. Especially on the
  eastern side (from which Mr. Gaston was striving to get in), deep black
  channels, interlacing one another, and lapped with heath, required great
  outlay of long leaps, or much light downing, and heavy upping, of boots
  encrusted with the cake of mire. As wearisome a plod, as a light foot can go
  through with, or a heavy one stick fast in, with much aching of the
  knee-caps.</p>

  <p>George Gaston began to lose courage; and bad temper took the place of it.
  His great square jaws began to work, like those of a panting bull-dog; and
  his cheeks darkened into the colour of peat-water, where it is suffused with
  iron; for his recent illness had left its traces, both upon countenance, and
  in limb.</p>

  <p>And a pestilent thing from his point of view&mdash;which may not have been
  a correct one&mdash;was the impossibility of finding any steadfast place to
  stand upon, for the mighty relief of a cordial swear. If ever he stood still,
  for that congenial purpose&mdash;which <i>non solvitur
  ambulando</i>&mdash;his heels began to be infernally absorbed, and his foul
  tongue was jerked into the roof of his great mouth. Thus was he obliged to
  hold it well, with hard wear, and tear, of constitution.</p>

  <p>Suddenly springing from a channel of black ooze, in a labyrinth of deep
  gullies, roofed with sedge, and heath, he stood face to face with a man who
  had risen from a bog-seam to the same quivering crest. "Who are you?" cried
  Gaston, pulling out a big horse-pistol."</p>

  <p>"You needn't shoot me," replied the other; "I am only going home, sir, and
  I won't hurt you."</p>

  <p>Ashamed of his flurry, Mr. Gaston muttered something about the notorious
  robbers on the moor, while he narrowly observed the stranger&mdash;a grizzled
  man, perhaps about fifty years of age, embrowned by the sun, and deeply
  scarred upon one cheek. He was tall, and active, and straight of figure, and
  carried a bundle on a ground-ash stick; while he failed not to return, with
  interest, the inquiring gaze which he received.</p>

  <p>"If you know this beastly country," said Gaston; "I wish you would show me
  where Cranmere is. I must have been hunting for it, at least two hours; and
  as yet am no wiser than when I began. A bumpkin told me that 'he hideth
  himself'; and so he seems to do, with a vengeance."</p>

  <p>"I used to know it well enough," was the answer; "but the ground is so
  quaggy, that the landmarks shift. However, I dare say, that I can find it;
  but when you get there, there is nothing to see."</p>

  <p>"I wonder who you are? I should be glad to know;" cried Gaston, as he
  followed, with some trouble, the long light stride of the stranger.</p>

  <p>"It may seem an odd thing, sir, but the very same idea came into my mind,
  about you. Here we are; this is the place, they make a fuss about. Ah, they
  haven't seen the world, as I have."</p>

  <p>Rightly had he said indeed, that there was not much to see there. In spite
  of the drought, there was water then (which has since disappeared, through
  some tapping of the peat), but the water was not large enough, to cast any
  light, or life, around. The only comfort to the heart of the persevering
  traveller, was that he never henceforth could be, in a more uncomfortable
  spot.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Gaston briskly; "it has fulfilled my expectations.
  One thing certain in our life is, to find everything misdescribed. The
  Fleet-ditch, according to my recollections, presents a more striking scene
  than this. And the smell of dead stuff is less lively here. Good-bye, my fine
  fellow; don't let me detain you. It is a Sunday morning; and if there is a
  place that won't let me in, I shall sit down to moralise. Would you like to
  have anything, for your trouble? Or are you superior to such thoughts?"</p>

  <p>Without any answer, his guide departed; being a rough man of the world,
  who had learned to form dislikes with swiftness, and to express them slowly.
  Among the black rifts of the wild, he disappeared, as if he had sunk into the
  earth; while Gaston sat down upon a tuft of rusty heath, and his heart became
  as dismal as the dreariness around. He had worked very hard, and beyond his
  weakened health, to secure his own purpose&mdash;which was good in his own
  eyes; and he thought it very hard, that his fortune should have driven him,
  into a place so lowering. For a resolute man of that sort rejoices in stiff
  hills, and steep valleys; but finds no pleasure in a vast expanse, hovering
  between hill and valley.</p>

  <p>The fault of the man was his selfishness, and the narrow pursuance of his
  own desires. If he had been born about six ranks higher in the social scale,
  educated to that mark, and taught to tread the marble steps, he might have
  become an ascending figure, and a statue at the top of them. For the firm set
  will, tough-fibred heart, power to turn wrong into right, and large readiness
  to dispense with scruples, adorned by imperious rudeness also, would have
  made him a popular idol. But having had no start in life, save the push of
  his own hands and feet, he had lapsed into the crooked ways, whose end is
  desolation.</p>

  <p>Some turn of words in his troubled mind, and the melancholy waste around
  him (darkening with the heavy gathering of a most peculiar sky) set him
  perhaps on meditation, a very unusual thing with him. But he shook off that
  weakness, and returned to his own anxieties.</p>

  <p>Lives there a man who can enjoy the grandest of all prospects, with the
  smallest of all flies in his eye? And in George Gaston's mental eye, were no
  small perils, disquietudes and pains. In the first place, although he bore
  some ill-will towards his intended victim, for crossing his path so
  vexatiously, he had suffered no personal wrong, to give flavour and warmth,
  to the coming atrocity. Scoundrel, and therefore self-deceptive, as he was;
  yet scarcely even to himself could he maintain, that he had any right to take
  a harmless life, because it interfered with his. He could only put aside that
  question, and lament the stern necessity which drove him; and reflect, that a
  man who could bury himself in such a dismal wilderness, must be happier, out
  of this world, than in it. Whose doing was it, that he, poor Gaston, was
  driven, in spite of all his struggles, to this pass? Why, clearly that
  fellow's, whose selfish cowardice, and wicked dislike of his own flesh and
  blood, had compelled another to supply his place, and thus fall into this
  complication.</p>

  <p>"How much longer, shall I beat about the bush? The sky is thickening over;
  there is no time to spare. To be caught in a storm here, would be a frightful
  thing."</p>

  <p>Rising, he shook his heavy shoulders and big neck, for the weight of the
  drowsy air bowed his head; and then he whistled thrice upon his nails, with a
  sound like the call of a curlew. In less than two minutes, a rough dark man
  was striding through the swamp, towards the pool; the style of whose dress
  was not church-going.</p>

  <p>They saluted each other, without much good will, or courtesy of
  expression; and then the last comer sat down, and crossed his legs, and
  stared at his visitor complacently.</p>

  <p>"You are not at all the thing, my city friend," he said; "you want a
  course of Dartmoor. London life, gambling, and hot whisky, play old Harry
  with the constitution. If nature had gifted you with a delicate complexion,
  what an interesting subject you would be! Come down, and live under the peat
  with me. Dry, genial, bracing quarters. I will board you for a fortnight, for
  ten pounds."</p>

  <p>"There is no time for rubbish. I am come to know, why you have forsworn
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"There are many legal axioms that might be quoted. A bad oath is honoured
  by the breach. And again, no man is bound to the impossible."</p>

  <p>"What impossibility has there been? That would be the only excuse for you.
  Unless you can prove that to my satisfaction, things will go badly with you,
  Master Wenlow."</p>

  <p>"Threats become a joke," replied the other, with a smile; "when the
  threatener is wholly in the power of the threatened one. You have gallantly
  ventured into the lion's den; and without my permission, you go forth no
  more. You are covered by a carbine where you sit; and to shoot me, would only
  bring your own death-shot. Look round as much as you like, George Gaston! but
  you will not see my noble mate. Now listen to sound reason, and attempt no
  threats. I went, to carry out my agreement with you. But the man's daughter
  came between us. Could even you have slain him, in the presence of his child?
  If you could&mdash;take the job out of my hands altogether. Why don't you do
  so? For the crime is just the same. But I suppose you cannot trust your eyes,
  like mine."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," returned Gaston, for he wished to skip that question; "at
  any rate you must do it, quite alone. You must not take that other ruffian
  with you."</p>

  <p>"What ruffian? George Gaston? Oh, I see, you mean my friend, who is
  watching my interests! No, he knows nothing of this little by-play. He is
  under a cloud; but he never could bring himself to shoot an honest man; as
  you, or I, might do. Ah, it is not complimentary! But we don't stand upon
  such trifles now."</p>

  <p>"I am here upon business; and not for stale jocosity. You are entirely
  outside the world; you have no chance of returning to it, in this stiff
  little kingdom. I offer you the chance of a new world, where you may start
  anew, and cultivate your much neglected virtues, rise in position, found a
  family, and look back upon this boggy period, as no more than a black dream
  gone by. In exchange for all those blessings, you have simply to remove one
  worthless life. A life extinguished in disgrace already, tired of itself, and
  desirous to depart. And what is that to you, who have taken two already!"</p>

  <p>Gaston's coarse cynicism foiled itself. Without those last words, he might
  perhaps have conquered. For the other man was desperate, and well-nigh sunk
  into that black depth of our nature, in which we scorn our lives, our
  brethren's, and the will of Him who gave them. But the sense of wrong was
  vivid in a soul, where the power of right lay prostrate.</p>

  <p>"It is a lie, a gross lie!" he shouted, overbearing Gaston with the fury
  of his eyes, as he pressed down his shoulders with the vigour of his hands.
  "They died through me. But I did not kill them. If anybody knows the truth,
  you know it. Without you, none of it would have happened. Gaston, I believed
  that there was no devil. But when I look at you, I am orthodox again."</p>

  <p>"Once more, there is no time for bandying words. You have broken your
  pledge so abominably, that the fellow is preparing to start to-morrow. If he
  once gets to London you will rue it, more than I shall. This very day you
  must carry out the matter. You know his ways, as no one else does. Do it; and
  be off to-night for Falmouth. There you shall have your passage-money to New
  York, and five hundred clear, to make your fortune with."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be done for the money. Five hundred! A thousand is the very
  least, that I will hear of."</p>

  <p>"It is out of my power. I cannot do it now. Be fair with me, and I will be
  generous. Five hundred down, and you shall have security for the other five
  hundred, in six months' time. That will be much better for you, than to have
  it all at once."</p>

  <p>"A thousand thanks for such thoughtful kindness. But now as you have no
  time to lose, understand me. You say that I have taken two lives already.
  Very well, that is enough for one lifetime. My conscience pricks me through
  your words. I will not commit this murder for you. I have done many bad
  things; but nothing half so villainous as this. Go, and do it yourself,
  George Gaston; you may trust my honour not to peach."</p>

  <p>"Scoundrel, after all that I have done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hard words break no bones, my friend. Pop at me, if you like, but first
  look round, and see my body-guard, as dead a shot as I am. Mike, stand up.
  Our friend is pugnacious. Ah, now you are wise; to shoot me would never help
  you. One word of counsel in return, my friend. I have seen you rather nervous
  in a thunderstorm. Well, the heaviest and biggest there has been for
  generations, is gathering in the south-east now. If you are caught upon the
  moor, and lose your head, you will certainly get bogged; unless the lightning
  saves the trouble. Farewell, George. We shall never meet again. If I were
  revengeful, you would not go so."</p>

  <p>Without further ceremony, off he walked, and vanished in a shaggy cloof,
  beside the black morass; while Gaston looked after him, as if he would like
  to shoot him, but could not yet afford the pleasure</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch50"
     id="ch50">CHAPTER L. &mdash; SEEKING REFUGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Abandoned thus, in this desert place (the most "unkid," both
  to see and feel, within the British kingdom), Mr. Gaston lost his
  temper&mdash;or rather found, and gave way to it&mdash;for the valuable space
  of half an hour. He was not weak enough to suppose that powerful language has
  power upon facts; but he was amply weak enough to find comfort in the
  free-trade of words, called "swearing." Then his spirit came back to him,
  much refreshed; and that his bodily strength might tally, he put away one
  pistol, and pulled out another, whose charge was liquid, and discharged
  it.</p>

  <p>"A flip for the desert, and the bogs, and thunder! This Dartmoor is but a
  trumpery hole," he exclaimed with the 'Dutch courage' rising. "It is
  something to have saved a thousand pounds, and to do these ticklish jobs
  oneself. That cowardly fellow tried to frighten me with thunder. A liar he
  always was, and will be. Why, the clouds are clearing off!"</p>

  <p>Overhead, for the moment, the dull air lifted, and a dirty yellow light
  streamed down; but before the hope of this grew stronger, a low growl
  trembled far away.</p>

  <p>"Tush! It is those fools firing at Plymouth. Admiral come out of
  church&mdash;or something. They are always making some row there. I will get
  out of this beastly oven. Two cannon-shot never come into one hole. A man,
  who has been struck by lightning once, must be free of it, like small-pox.
  Those fellows who call themselves 'electricians,' are nothing but thundering
  quacks, after all. How can there be any such thing as special attraction in
  certain persons? Bah, I don't believe a word of it. Besides, I don't believe
  there will be a storm at all; and if there is, it will draw to the highest
  spots like Yes-Tor. George Gaston is not going to be scared for nothing, in
  this crisis of his fortunes. Forth among the blessed bogs again! I am
  beginning to understand them."</p>

  <p>This sanguine view of the position restored the deep red colour to his
  cheeks; which lasted for an hour, or more, while he plodded on right
  stubbornly, over and through the shaggy fen-growth, scorched at the top, and
  sodden at the bottom. Then he came to a little dark-eyed runnel, stealing
  from its cradle-head, with tottering uncertainty; and tumbling into little
  flutters, where it lay, and rested.</p>

  <p>"This ought to be the Taw, but I am much afraid it isn't," thought Gaston,
  pursuing its direction for a minute; "instead of the Taw, it must be the
  Tavy; and instead of getting near my horse, I must have gone away from
  him."</p>

  <p>A sudden shift of the panting air and wavering light had misled him. For
  the track of the sun was now lost in the sky, as completely as if he were
  quagmired; while a flit of tawny haze obscured the coronet of distinctive
  tors.</p>

  <p>In a rage with himself, and the weather, and the world, he turned upon his
  track at the head of Tavy cleeve, and making a correct landcast this time,
  found his way to the fountains of the Taw, and so to the peat shed.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Perrott's stout horse, <i>Charlie,</i> was getting uneasy about
  the weather, and had well-nigh jerked his bridle off. With gladness he
  accepted Mr. Gaston's weight, and set his head towards the Chagford stable.
  For he was a native of the broad moorland, and inhaled the subtle tissue of
  the cloud and breeze, as if he were the west wind's legal heir, though
  restricted in the airy part of his own system.</p>

  <p>"This is all very fine, old chap," said Gaston, whose coarse nature must
  have coarse expression; "but before we get back to Thirlstone, there will be
  bellows to mend, and no mistake. But go ahead, while you can, my boy."</p>

  <p>The willing horse made play, with vigour, and with gaiety, among the
  rugged boulders, and the combings of the tussocks, and the tiring softness of
  the many oozy tangles; till the roughness of the ground, and breathless
  burden of the air, began to tell upon his lathered flanks, and legs that
  wanted scraping. He panted with long labour, and began to hang his head down,
  as he carefully put foot after foot, on the steppy rise that winds along the
  breast of Watern-tor. There Gaston halted him upon a rocky platform, and took
  a careful survey of the wild and threatening prospect.</p>

  <p>By this time it was rightly manifest, both to man and beast, that a great
  turmoil of the world above them was preparing to break loose. Over the
  heights, dark clouds were piling, like sacks upon a wool-comber's wain; in
  the deep glens, heat-fogs still were huddling; while along the followings,
  and ins and outs, of landscape, a confusion of the settlement of light and
  shade was moving.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gaston felt his hair prick up, and the whole of his system throb with
  fear. He looked for the Kestor rocks, the most conspicuous height in front of
  him; and lo, they were covered with a depth of tempest, letting down vast
  loops of gray! He looked to the right and left, along the hollow reaches of
  the waste, and towards him rolled the sable billows of storm-clouds big with
  thunder.</p>

  <p>Then his spirit failed within him, and his heart sank low, and he deeply
  wished for a cellar, or a cave, in the bowels of the wholesome earth. He
  durst not go for his broad-brimmed hat, and wig, concealed in the bracken,
  but urged his reluctant horse out of the homeward track, and down to the low
  ground. This led him to the source of the South Teign; and so along some
  winding bottoms, to the Moreton road. Gaston, in his terror, would have been
  too glad to set off at full gallop for Moreton; and as it was, he followed
  that road for some distance, until it began to mount a cloud-capped hill,
  another nucleus of the storm. For according to all accounts of that great
  tempest, it differed from all others within memory, not only in power and
  extent, but also in the manner of its formation. For it neither came with the
  wind, nor against it (although first appearing perhaps in the south-east),
  but accumulated gradually round the whole horizon, converging steadfastly
  towards the zenith, and compassing (as with a great black tent) the whole of
  the moor, till it filled it all with fire.</p>

  <p>As yet, there had been neither flash nor peal, only one or two distant
  rumbles, over the sea, or the lowland. And except for a strange thick
  feeling, and a difficulty of breathing, and a weak uneasy drowsiness, a man
  (who was a moderate conductor) might have got into a quarry pit, and gone
  into his conscience, without extreme severity. Mr. Gaston, however, had a
  lively sense of being too good a conductor, and he found himself tingling
  already, with a nervous surcharge of electricity. This added considerably to
  his alarm; and he would have been glad to perspire it off; but his ploddings
  in the sultry morning, and great radiations of profane expletives, had left
  the bodily surface dry, and clogged with saline particles.</p>

  <p>"All haste now for the <i>Raven;</i> what a fool not to have thought of
  it!" he whispered to himself, for he feared to speak aloud, lest it should
  bring down the impending thunder-crash. "This hollow must lead towards it;
  and there is deep shelter there. Get along, you old screw; what are you
  afraid of? The proper thing, for you, is a stout crab-stick."</p>

  <p>The horse deserved none of these coarse reproaches, being ready, and
  steady, both in saddle and in harness; and now if he were nervous, whose
  fault was it? He felt that his rider was in a sad stew of terror; and he
  would not have been a horse, unless he shared it. And above him, on his
  off-side and his near side&mdash;from his own point of view, a ridiculous
  distinction&mdash;unknown monsters, without any love for horseflesh, were
  preparing, with tremendously long lashes, to descend on him. Away for the
  <i>Raven,</i> or for any other spot, where manger, hay, and brother horses
  could be found!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he heard a pleasant sound, a sound associated in his healthy
  mind with a quiet day's rest in a meadow, a discourse through a hedge with a
  ladylike cow, or a tranquil survey (with the chin upon a gate) of a road,
  that will not jar the hoofs till to-morrow&mdash;the sound of a bell, calling
  human flesh to church. Clearly enough it was a large rich bell, a long way
  off, in some high tower, melodiously, with measured swing, inviting all of a
  quiet mind, to hear good words in a holy place. Through the menace of the
  brooding storm, and deepening awe of cloud and crag, the mellow tone came,
  gently varying, with the ebb and flow of sound. To a youthful sinner,
  wavering and tremulous, it might have been the pulse of mercy, or throb of
  some good angel's heart</p>

  <p>To this man there was no such message, for the echo of his soul was gone.
  All his misgivings were of the body. If church, or chapel, would save his
  body; that was the sacred place for him. He pulled up the horse, and with his
  hand spread from his eyebrows, peered along the hovering arcade of storm.
  Rising from the lower level, half a league away or so, and not as yet
  enveloped in the cloud-mass of the moor, was a shapely tower of fair granite,
  the finest, and best proportioned piece of masonry, round Dartmoor.
  Successful miners had built it, as their free thankoffering to the Lord, in
  the days when men were not too sublime to believe in a Power over them. It
  was the tower of Christowell. The bell, with native silver rich, the largest
  of the seven, ceased calling; and the four o'clock service was begun.</p>

  <p>"It must be more than twenty years, since I saw the inside of a church,"
  Gaston communed with himself; "but any port in a storm, we say; and nobody
  knows me hereabout. And if they did, it would all tell for me. Larks will not
  be there, of course. But I will not go, if I can help it. On for the
  <i>Raven,</i> if we can. When the storm is gone by, my turn will come."</p>

  <p>He was keeping to the right, to pass the church afar, and get into a track
  below the crest; when the volume of the storm came sweeping towards him, like
  a rolling-up of heaven. "We will hasten to the house of the Lord," he cried,
  in a stupor of wild ribaldry, shot across with memory of childhood's faith,
  and of kneeling beside his mother. In a few minutes, he was at the churchyard
  gate, where the coffins rested in bad weather; and he pulled the trembling
  horse in through, and knotted the bridle on a tombstone.</p>

  <p>They were singing the psalm before the sermon, with an unusual depth of
  voice; encouraging one another's vitality, as they do at funerals. Each man,
  with his open mouth, nudged up to his neighbour growing dark to him; and the
  women in the lower row, held hands, to keep their voices. A peculiar smell
  oppressed the church; as if the dead were rising.</p>

  <p>The great west door, beneath the tower, was open, where the bell-ropes
  hung, with the frayed hemp glistening in the darkness, like so many hangman's
  nooses. Gaston stole his way between them, to the pillar of the western arch;
  and slipped into the church unseen; for every mind was overborne with a heavy
  load of doubt and fear; and every eye was cowering, at the creeping shades of
  roof and wall.</p>

  <p>The cold awe of the vaulted gloom redoubled Gaston's terror; and he sank
  upon a low bench fitted round the octagonal plinth of a tall, gray pier. Then
  he pulled off his flexible hat, and muttered some confused words into it; and
  if they were not words of prayer, it was from want of practice.</p>

  <p>The vicar, with a slow and solemn step, went up the winding pulpit-stairs,
  every rustle of his surplice sounding, through the breathless hush around.
  And when he knelt, for his own silent prayer upon the cushion, the murmuring
  of the Christow brook came in at the chancel window, and was heard throughout
  the church by many, who had never heard it there before, and never should
  here it anywhere again.</p>

  <p>The parson's voice was trembling slightly, not from fear, but solemn awe,
  as he pronounced his text, the prayer of David in the hour of
  dread&mdash;<i>Let me fall into the hand of the Lord.</i> Before he had
  pronounced it twice, thick blackness fell upon roof, and window, pillar,
  arch, and sepulchral stone. A man could scarcely see his wife, or little
  ones, at his elbow; mothers caught their children up, to be sure of being
  near them; and the preacher's voice came out of the night.</p>

  <p>In this last moment of his life, Mr. Gaston knew not what he did. Supreme
  terror held him, soul and body; while his blood, like a boiling fountain,
  rushed. A delicate figure, dressed in white, stood near him at the column's
  base. Trembling, so that he could not stand, he spread one hand before his
  eyes, with the elbow on a ledge for books. Then his other hand came forth,
  and clasped, in wild hope of some saving power, the skirt of a gentle maiden.
  It was Rose, who stood with her form so straight, and her face as firm as
  marble; the daughter of the man he was come here to murder.</p>

  <p>Then fell the greatest crash of tempest ever known in England. The tower
  was cleft, the church was rent, the people cast, like blasted straws. The
  roof flew wide, the pillars snapped, the timbers fell like cobwebs, and the
  walls were riven as a bladder bursts. Pitchy night, and stifling vapour,
  shrouded all who were unconsumed.</p>

  <p>This was not for one moment only; but (if any human reckoning of such time
  were possible) to count it by the things that happened, makes five minutes of
  it. For instance, there were eight boys piled upon the communion-table, who
  after their dinner had been at school, and were sitting round the
  altar-rails. They all got off, when their sense returned&mdash;which could
  not have happened immediately&mdash;and then another electric fling, though
  less severe, replaced them. Also, it is quite certain, that a man who was
  surviving (being Thomas Read, the warrener) made the first attempt to go out
  of church; with his brindled dog, covered in sulphur sparks, sniffing the way
  in front of him. But when the dog came to the arch of the tower, where a man
  was sitting steadfastly, he was caught up, and whirled seven times round, and
  cast upon the step into the tower, as dead as if he never had been born. This
  made Thomas Read draw back, and saved him from an unripe end; for the bier of
  the church, with its six legs flying, went by him like artillery practice,
  and must have passed through the chancel window, being found in the thatch of
  a linhay far below, when the burials were done without it.</p>

  <p>All, who got over it, are agreed that it must have gone on, for at least
  five minutes; and some say a great deal more than that. It began, with a
  great ball of fire descending, and splitting the north side of the tower,
  then scorching all the bell-ropes, and passing up the nave, after killing one
  man in the archway. Then it killed another man, with his head against a
  stone, by driving his skull into the granite, took all the hair off an
  elderly woman (her Sunday hair, new that morning), and then parted into a big
  globe, and a small one; the big going out through the roof, and the small one
  through the chancel window.</p>

  <p>After that, nobody knows what happened; for they all fell down upon their
  faces, with the thundering of stones and beams above them, and conviction of
  the Judgment-day. In the stench of sulphur, men held breath, and women chewed
  their handkerchiefs. Through the woodwork of the pews, they could see the
  lightning to and fro, like clotted snakes; and a roar (like an overshot wheel
  in a flood) rang along their backbones. For it was not one explosion only,
  but a continuous rush and blaze, of which there is only one other instance*
  recorded in this country&mdash;a volume of solid fire, like that fearful
  power "field-lightning"which wraps with flame a league of herbage, in the
  Jura Mountains.</p>

  <p>* The great storm at Widecombe in the Moor, Sunday, October 21, 1638.</p>

  <p>When the worst was gone, but the shattered building filled with blue
  sulphureous fog, and smother of bitumen, the first to stand up was Farmer
  Willum, being the parish-warden. "Neighbours, in the name of God, shall us
  venture forth, as many as be alive of us?" he asked, for he could not see the
  parson, through the thickness of the air. But Mr. Short stood up in the
  pulpit, unharmed, and without any sign of fire; and he said, with a resolute
  voice, "Not so; first let us thank the Lord, who has preserved us; and then
  let us pray, that our courage may return." With great presence of mind, he
  put by his sermon, to do for the next Sunday afternoon, when he added some
  most impressive words. One of the covers had been consumed; and the other
  bore the image of a death's head upon it, stamped by the lightning, or the
  fire-ball. To the present day, it is as plain as ever; and it has been
  declared, by all who knew him, to be the head of George Gaston.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch51"
     id="ch51">CHAPTER LI. &mdash; SENT TO JUDGMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In a commemorative poem, even finer than that inscribed upon
  the tablet, where the fire first came in, the gifted author (who is said to
  have been the schoolmaster of the village) has inserted the following
  apposite reflection&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Oh that our people, with as good a heart,<br>
  Would come to church, as then they did depart!<br>
  True zeal were that, oh what a joy to see,<br>
  Folk flocking in, as fast as they did flee!"</p><br>

  <p>However, that can hardly be expected, in the present condition of human
  nature. It is said, that one very affectionate mother was so much astonished,
  that she went home, without remembering that she had taken her only child to
  church with her. But coming to herself, when she returned to see the dead
  bodies brought out of the church, which was not done until evening, she
  besought the sexton to go in and look; and there the little child was found,
  going hand in hand with another little child, neither of them hurt, nor
  showing a sign of fear, or fire, in their faces. And it is a remarkable
  thing, that while seven people were killed, and sixty-two were injured, not a
  single child in the church was hurt; though the seats they were sitting on,
  were torn up fiercely, and some even cast up through the roof.</p>

  <p>The reason why Rose was sitting by the western arch, instead of in her
  father's pew, was simply that she had been late for the service, and did not
  like to disturb the people. Her father stayed at home, preparing for that
  journey to London, which he could no longer put off; although he knew not,
  even now, the full urgency of the case; because the clerk, despatched by
  Latimer and Emblin, had failed as yet to find him. But he now was aware of
  his father's death; and loth as he was to claim his own position, he could
  not but feel, that his duty to Rose compelled him to come forward.</p>

  <p>He would have kept Rose at home as well, because of the threatening
  weather; but she begged so hard to go, for this last time, and promised so
  sincerely to escape the rain, if any, that she got her own way as usual. But
  the captain could not help thinking, that he had been very foolish in letting
  her go. As the sky grew darker and darker, his heart became more and more
  uneasy; until he could not stay in the house, but must go forth to see
  things. What he saw, from the spur of the hill, enforced his fear upon him
  mightily; for the church, betwixt him and the village, was wattled round with
  thick black clouds, rolling downward spirally. Then it seemed to be swallowed
  up, with one vast roar, as if the earth closed over it; and then it
  reappeared, with shattered ribs, and liquid fire running through them, like a
  metal-foundry. It looked impossible, after that, for any one to be alive
  inside.</p>

  <p>With a crawling heart, the captain ran, as fast as ever his legs would go,
  not so much to save his dear child's life, as to drag her body from the
  flames. Church, and churchyard, all alike, appeared to be one mass of fire;
  which may have been the effect of the sulphur, covering all things with blue
  reek. He would have rushed into the church, before the force of the crash was
  over&mdash;which also shows that it lasted long&mdash;and perhaps he would
  thus have lost his life; but the western doors (having square studs of iron)
  were torn from their hinges, and flung across the way. The same thing had
  happened to the side-door on the north; but that not being so heavy, Captain
  Larks was enabled to drive a way through, with his foot; and he was setting
  off for his own pew, through the smoke and crush of everything&mdash;the last
  explosion of the air, which slew the poor dog, being over&mdash;when he saw
  close to him a soft white figure; and there was his daughter in his arms!</p>

  <p>Her beautiful hair had been shed all round her, and she cried a good deal,
  as might be expected; and her hands, and face, were deadly cold. But beyond
  that, and her clinging to him (as was natural to life, in so much death)
  nobody could have guessed, to see her, that she had been in the middle of a
  fireball. Yet that is truly no exaggeration; let those explain it, who have
  the power.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come away, my darling?" asked the captain, who was weeping
  also, in this great relief of heart. "Darling, there will be floods of rain,
  almost instantly. Do come."</p>

  <p>"Father, this poor man holds my dress; and I fear that he is not well,"
  she said, pointing round the granite plinth. "He was frightened a great deal
  more than I was; and I hope the Lord has spared him."</p>

  <p>But the Lord had done otherwise; and all must be resigned to it. The
  captain put forth his hand, and laid it, through an especial thickness of
  air, upon the head of a man, who was sitting forward, propped by his elbow on
  a desk. The scalp of the man was there, with hair as stiff as wire upon it;
  also his countenance shining blue, and set in the form of a coffin, as it had
  been, in his boyhood. But his brains were gone, and lay behind him in a grey
  heap on the flags.</p>

  <p>"Come away, my darling," the captain whispered, detaching the dead hand
  from her dress, and getting between, that she might not see; "he is
  frightfully stunned. We will go, with all haste, and send the doctor to
  him."</p>

  <p>Shuddering himself he led his shuddering daughter through the darkness,
  and a sudden chill, as if heaven had exhausted all its heat, blew round
  them.</p>

  <p>Then began the most furious rain, ever known even on Dartmoor. It must
  have burst forth on the heights ere this; for the Christow was coming down,
  like a brown wall, jutted on the crest with jags of rock. Three months of
  drought were to be made up; and nature spared no effort towards it. Rose, and
  her father, were drenched, before they passed through the gate of their
  meadow; and the moment they had crossed the drawbridge, a dash of flood-wave
  carried it away. Till the morning, they were quite cut off from chance of
  hearing any more than the roll of deluged thunder, and the rushing of the
  flood.</p>

  <p>But in the morning, courage came to the stunned, and battered village, and
  the quiet runs of shadow, where poor people live and are content. Many a
  cottage, not so tall as to invite the lightning, nor so big as to challenge
  the wind-blast, had been robbed of long paternal comforts, and of high
  maternal pride&mdash;settles, wool-chairs, feather-beds, dishes, "dowered
  with" a gravy-well, and Britannia-metal teapots&mdash;by the roaring felony
  of the little brook, that scarcely filled their kettles, when they went to
  church. And worse than that, ten times as bad, there was scarcely a cot,
  accustomed to soft gossip, and loving desire to know all about its
  neighbours, that was not full of scalding groans, and quick pain rolled in
  greased lint.</p>

  <p>In this deep trouble of the wounded, and the dying, there appeared a hero,
  and a heroine. Or, to put it more correctly, all the good deeds done centred
  by attraction round those two, as in Classic Mythology, and in every British
  crisis. Now this pair was, Dicky Touchwood, and Sporetta Perperaps.</p>

  <p>Poor Squire Dicky, still in exile at the vicarage, and stanch in his scorn
  of drysalterism, had escaped the worst issue of that great electric force, by
  the perfect formation of his feet. Of this he was not, at the moment, aware;
  but his mother proved it afterwards.</p>

  <p>It appears that the lightning ran under his insteps, which were arched by
  nature (in a Gothic arch, like those of all young ladies now), and instead of
  tearing, it only tossed him, like the lad of pith he was. Coming down happily
  on all fours, he was not only unhurt, but filled with activity, hitherto
  undeveloped, though latent in his system; as a close observer might have
  judged, from his manner of dancing one foot. And few of the many strange
  facts recorded concerning that great commotion of the elements, are stranger,
  than the permanent change effected in the nature of Squire Dicky.
  Unscientific persons might ascribe that effect to other causes; alarm for
  instance at his father's conduct, or daily intercourse with Parson Short, or
  the fright of the storm, and the narrow escape, or the saddening power of
  deep suffering around. But science is always correct, and allows no room for
  any but its own opinion; and science declared that the organic substances,
  and protoplastic synthesis of psychic neontology, in that portion of the
  Cantab which was called his mind, had (through the agency of thermo-electric
  currents) undergone a process of precipitation, not impossibly combined with
  fusion, which&mdash;to put it in plain English&mdash;had made him much less
  of a fool than he used to be.</p>

  <p>Thus, when five men could not lift the beam, which had dropped between the
  parson and the clerk, jamming Mr. Short up in the pulpit, so that he could
  not help others or himself, it was young Squire Dicky to whom it first
  occurred, that there is in this country a tool, called a saw. Neither did any
  one else perceive, until he impressed it on them, that the first attention
  should be given to the living, and not to those who were beyond all help. For
  the poor folk were scared out of all possession, by this roaring fury of the
  Evil One.</p>

  <p>For as soon as the people, who escaped from church, told their story to
  the people who had stayed at home, they found out the meaning of all that had
  happened; which they could not in any way account for before, without
  thinking ill of the House of the Lord. But now, it was much to the credit of
  the church, that its principal enemy had been inside it. For the blacksmith
  of Christowell, a long-haired grimy man, never known to go to church, or
  chapel, had been visited by Satan, some years back, while swearing very hard,
  because he could not get a plough-share into form. He was panting by his
  bellows, and his quart of beer was empty, when the Evil One stood by him,
  with an apron on, and said, "I will do it for you, Josiah, for a very little
  manners on your part. Promise me, that if you go to sleep in church, I may
  pass my fingers through your hair." "Done," replied the blacksmith; "for I
  never go to church." Then the stranger touched the plough-share with one
  finger, and it smoked, and bent, like a hedger's glove, into the shape
  required. For seven years, Josiah carried on his business, without going to
  sleep in any church whatever, because he remained outside the door. But when
  he lost his wife, his daughter Betsy did persuade him to come to church with
  her, on the Sunday next the funeral, to show their black clothes, as all
  respectable folk do. The weather was so drowsy, and the church so hot, that
  his head began to nod towards his knees; and then he put his elbows on his
  new black breeches, and his chin between his thumbs, and could not help
  snoring. Then there was seen at the <i>Three Horse-shoes,</i> a lean dark
  figure, on a tall black horse. He called for a quart of ale; and it was
  noticed by the maid who served him, that it hissed down his throat, like the
  quenching of hot iron; and the pot smelled of brimstone ever afterwards. When
  he came to the churchyard, he threw the horse's bridle on the tombstone of a
  man, who had cut his own throat; then striding in through the west arch, with
  smoke around him, passed his hand through the long hair of Josiah, and
  vanished up the tower, which he cleft in twain, with a tremendous
  thunder-clap.</p>

  <p>This tale had been proved to be over true, by a man upon the road, where
  the air was clearer, who could swear, if it was his dying day, that while the
  great roar was going on, a horse with broken bridle, flashed by him, like a
  mad thing; and Mr. Perrott knows that his good nag, <i>Charlie,</i> came
  piteously crying to get in, that night, drenched and foundered, and most
  eager to relate adventures as yet not in human language.</p>

  <p>Moreover the blacksmith's corpse was found, more than ten landyards from
  the church; where it certainly never could have fetched itself.</p>

  <p>Miss Perperaps escaped, even more completely than the gallant Cantab,
  simply by not being there at all, but attending to poor Mrs. Sage, who still
  suffered from the spines of the hedgehog, on account of her age. Also her
  father had exercised the medical privilege of contemplating the sacred
  building externally. And now these two laboured in their vocation, earning
  quantities of money, which never were paid. Except that the doctor was wise
  enough not to part, without the money down, with a single one of his
  prophylactic antiphlogistic pillules; without which, no person in Christowell
  ventured near a cloud of any sort, that winter.</p>

  <p>One of the most severely scorched, of the sixty-two who got over it, was
  poor Samuel Slowbury. And this was all the more hard upon him, because he
  came very much against his will, and only to oblige his wife, by getting rid
  of Achan's curse. He had pledged himself on his father's Bible (to escape bad
  dreams, and scoldings even worse), that he would slip into the church-bag,
  that day, done up in brown paper, as if it were a penny, those three guineas
  which he had received for betraying, and spying upon, his master. Not thus,
  however, was he justified; but paid with his skin, for the sin of his soul.
  Men of science have declared that no man can survive the loss of more than 28
  per cent. of his natural covering against the air. Sam Slowbury lost, at the
  mildest computation, very nearly twice as much as that; yet after a time of
  suffering (which made him feel, enough for fifty, and to the end of his
  existence hate all flies), he was finally restored to his large, but lean,
  family, with the stamp of the royal mint upon him. Under his girdle&mdash;or
  in stricter fact, his waistcoat pocket&mdash;on the toughest of his cracklins
  not singed off, were two indelible George and Dragons, and one fine
  countenance of George the Third, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
  and Defender of the Faith. Sam charged a shilling, to a great extent, for
  showing these; and reared an honest family, without excessive labour.</p>

  <p>What with the furious rain, and the fright, and the darkening of the
  evenings&mdash;for now it was come to the equinox&mdash;the shattered church
  was scarcely cleared of the poor scorched sufferers, that night. All, who
  were unhurt, worked hard, under the guidance of Mr. Short, Dicky Touchwood,
  and Miss Perperaps. After the flood came down in full, the Christow could not
  be passed for hours, except at one spot, where a pair of granite pillars
  served to carry some long planks; and this delayed the clearance of the
  church as well. The large proportion of the wounded to the killed (being
  almost as nine to one) surprised all who were not in either number, and
  aroused their pious gratitude. And thus the didactic poet above mentioned,
  after delicate allusion to Slowbury's case, which he feared to describe too
  nicely, declares with true poetic force&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I am astonished, both in heart and head,<br>
  To see so many, yet so few, lie dead."</p><br>

  <p>Those, who were happily absent, must not speak as if they knew much about
  it; yet it was maintained upon inquiry, that the rush from heaven, which
  clove the tower, dashed to pieces all it met; while the fire of the stony
  floor, and of the earth replying, burned the outside faces, and skin
  coverings, of the people.</p>

  <p>And a sad case indeed was that of the excellent Mrs. Aggett; who deserved
  to be spared, if ever anybody did; and was so connected with the very pulpit,
  that she could speak orders for the sermon's length, to the make-up, and the
  measure, of her own kitchen-fire. If she had been roasted, with her best
  dress off, and the little dog to turn the spit, she never could have been
  more purely browned, and she never could have carried on the noise she did
  about it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Short was much concerned. But knowing many others to be ten times
  worse, he would not have her seen to first; for which she promised to forgive
  him, as soon as she should be strong enough. Forgetful of his own interest,
  he pushed on, carrying with his own sturdy arms some of his charred
  parishioners, to an empty barn of Farmer Willum's, which was to be the
  hospital, for those who could not be carried home. Then the dead were taken
  home; and it must have been quite midnight, when, with lanterns raised, they
  came to one, unknown to any present.</p>

  <p>"What a fearful sight!" the parson whispered, holding back the others.
  "The face is a very remarkable one; and the figure is that of a large, strong
  man. Is there no one here who knows him?"</p>

  <p>All shook their heads, as they gazed with awe. "A bad 'un whoever he
  were," said one; "I reckon 'twere he, who drawed down the storm."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" replied Mr. Short; "who shall judge a man, gone to his judgment?
  If no one knows him, let him stay. To move him would destroy all knowledge.
  No rain falls here. Go, and fetch the curtain that fell from the chancel
  window. We will fix it before him, until to-morrow. All the neighbourhood
  will be here tomorrow, and some one, perhaps, to identify him. Any one, who
  has ever seen it, will recognise such a face as that."</p>

  <p>So, that which had been George Gaston spent the first night of death, with
  none to heed it; alone in the awful darkness, and the grisly taint, and
  ghastly ruins; itself the most awful form of darkness, and the most ghastly
  ruin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch52"
     id="ch52">CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; UNVEILED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Oh, father dear, even if he comes, I beg you to put it off
  a little. After all the years, we have spent at Christowell, it will seem so
  unkind to leave it now. And I am&mdash;I seem to feel so very odd to-day. The
  things, that I have heard, seem to strike me, like the lightning; after my
  being in the midst of them. But how wicked of me, to be talking of
  myself!"</p>

  <p>Already, on the Monday morning, frightful, and (if that were possible)
  exaggerated tales of the Christowell catastrophe had reached Larks' Cot; and
  the captain's main reason for insisting on departure, at the time appointed,
  was his dread of the effect upon his darling's health. The furnace of death,
  from which she had come forth unscathed, like the holy children, might have
  spared her only for the moment, if she stayed among the scenes which
  followed. Therefore he rejoiced, that he had fixed that day, for Pugsley to
  fetch them to Moreton; where Rose would remain, while her father went on to
  London. But now he looked closely at this dear child&mdash;whose life was all
  the world to him&mdash;and he doubted, whether she could bear the jolting of
  what Master Pugsley described as, "our oncommon aisy vaheykkel."</p>

  <p>"Here he is! Here he is, I do declare! What can have brought him without
  his breakfast?" cried Rose, who was always excited about Pugsley; "and the
  stream is still very strong for him to cross; and he really has got
  two&mdash;two gentlemen with him. One is that kind old Mr. Tucker. But I have
  no idea who the other is."</p>

  <p>The other soon proved who he was; for strong indignation is not silent,
  except in a highly superior mind. Mr. Greatorex, a young insurgent attorney
  of the future, the foremost desk, and the cleverest quill, in the clerks'
  room of Latimer and Emblin, had been sent from pillar to post, for a
  fortnight, to find out such a hole as this!</p>

  <p>Pugsley's red face was expanded, with a glow of gentle joy. The common lay
  mind hates the lawyer; as the lay body objects to the doctor, and the soul is
  timorous of the parson. So that both Pugsley, and Master Tucker, had
  listened, throughout the long drive from Moreton, to the plaints, and menaces
  of this warm youth, with furtive shrugs, and some interchange of winks. The
  clerk and the carrier now came up, with decorous salutes to a genuine earl;
  but the timber-merchant gave his hand as usual; and Captain Larks bowed, as
  he pressed it warmly.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been here before now," Mr. Tucker explained, with
  dignity; "not for the change in your fortunes, my lord; but because of my
  duty, to a man who trusts me. But the fault is not mine, sir; as you will
  see. Our folk never came home, till Saturday night, with all their heads
  turned. Never to London shall they go again, so long as I be living. You
  would think there was nothing to Exeter, good enough to put their shoes on;
  yet all the time they was in London, they was crying up Exeter. And Snacks,
  who married my sister, has behaved the worst of all. Whether it was that he
  knew too much, or too little, or compounded with the lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not so," said Mr. Greatorex, coming forward; "our firm is above all that.
  But it was felt, my lord, that in a position like this, you should be well
  advised; and that our firm should approach you first, with an accurate
  statement of the case. I was despatched, with promptitude; but, through wrong
  information purposely supplied, I have been wandering for several days, over
  this beautiful, but frightfully rough county. Perhaps none but myself would
  have found your lordship now. I have no skin left, in several
  places&mdash;but that will form the basis of a future action. May I have the
  honour of speaking with your lordship, quite in private?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as you please. But Mr. Tucker shall hear all. Mr. Tucker is the
  truest friend I have. And I wish him to hear everything."</p>

  <p>General Punk, who had been cured in three doses, by Spotty Perperaps, was
  now gone back to Westcombe, and preparing there for a great campaign. The
  captain showed them into the room, which had been his; while Pugsley told
  wonderful tales in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"I am in the best possible hands," said the captain, as soon as he had
  learned all particulars of moment; "and I see no occasion for extreme haste
  now. Perhaps you, Mr. Greatorex, will return at once to your excellent
  principals, with a note from me. I will follow, as soon as things permit You
  have heard of the terrible disaster here. I must go down. Will you come with
  me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tucker had hired a carriage at Exeter, on the Sunday morning, hoping
  to be at Christowell that day; but at Moreton, the moor rose frightfully
  before them, swathed in black, and laced with fire. The driver turned in at
  the <i>White Hart,</i> and stopped, and would not come out again; and there
  they found the lawyer, also weather-bound, and fuming. Some one told them
  that Pugsley was ordered to start, right early in the morning, to fetch a
  gentleman; who proved to be the very one they both were seeking.</p>

  <p>Now while these three were gazing with amazement, at the sad wreck of the
  tower, and the crocketed pinnacles stuck into the earth (like the sceptre of
  Canute, in pictures), Mr. Short, who had been up to the leads
  almost&mdash;while every one trembled at his hardihood&mdash;and had sounded
  the bells, of which not one was hurt, and had pushed a great stone down,
  calling "ware, below," and had waved his hat out at the tremendous
  thunder-hole, so that people fell flat in the churchyard&mdash;he, with his
  week-day hat full of something, came out, as rank-minded, as if there were no
  Satan. "Just look at this," said he; "it is extraordinary stuff. Opposite the
  hole where the flash came in, there is a great dab of it on the wall, as
  large as&mdash;" his expression must not be repeated; but the object he
  referred to may be found in pasture land. "I shall keep some, as a curiosity;
  although it certainly does not smell nice."</p>

  <p>"It stinks alive!" exclaimed Mr. Tucker; "pitch, and brimstone, and dead
  men's flesh! I have heard of it before, but never seen it. Cast it from you,
  reverend sir."</p>

  <p>"No, gentlemen. I am getting used to horrors, after nothing else, for
  nearly twenty-four hours. This deposit should be in the British Museum. But
  come in, and see, what is greatly on my mind."</p>

  <p>The vicar of Christowell, heretofore so keen, judicious, and sensible, was
  driven from his usual frame of mind, by long excitement, and want of sleep.
  "There," he said, drawing the red curtain back; "we cannot identify this poor
  man. And how can we bury him, without it? The strong face shows a man of
  mark; yet none of the thousand gazers know him."</p>

  <p>"I know him by name," cried Mr. Tucker, shuddering, for he was
  gentle-hearted; "I am sure, it is one George Gaston."</p>

  <p>"And I know him, more than by name;" said young Greatorex. "What villainy
  was he come for here? Lord Delapole, it is your deadly enemy. The man who has
  laboured, to rob, and ruin you."</p>

  <p>"I never harmed him; and I am truly glad of it. I have long felt that some
  one was against me; but I never even knew his name, except through Mr.
  Tucker. Let us say nothing against him now."</p>

  <p>He spoke very softly, as a man impressed with the littleness of human
  things; and the others, in such a presence, felt that he was right, and
  screened the dead.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon, when Greatorex was gone off, in all haste to London, and
  Mr. Short, with his mind relieved, though sad and heavy for his people, was
  resting at last in his own room, but Christowell churchyard still was
  thronged with timid, and wondering people; among tossed monuments, and
  headlong tombstones, cast about like skittle-pins, two persons met, and
  looked with some surprise, at one another.</p>

  <p>"Like a bombardment, ain't it, sir?" said the younger of the two, though
  well of age, as he made a soldiers salute; "reminds me of how it was at
  Badajos."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you were there? I know your face, but at present, I forget your name,
  my friend; if indeed I ever knew it."</p>

  <p>"Rees Howell, sir, of the &mdash; Hussars, 'the never-mind-what,' they
  used to call us. Most of us knew Colonel Westcombe."</p>

  <p>"Because I knew most of your officers," answered the colonel, with his
  usual modesty; "but where are you living now, Rees Howell?"</p>

  <p>"At the <i>Raven,</i> with my father, sir. I only came home yesterday.
  Just in front of this great storm. I never saw worse, in any of the Serries,
  as they call them. 'Tis as bad as a general action almost. The barns are full
  of groaners, as we used to call the wounded chaps. I've a great mind to tuck
  up my sleeves, and help. I have seen a good bit of scorching."</p>

  <p>"Rees Howell, I am going to do the same, with permission of the doctors. I
  hope you have no friend, or relative hurt."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. The only one that I know is a dead man, and he might have made
  one of me yesterday; for he drew a pistol on me, by Cranmere; and I made sure
  he would have shot me. Ah! he was a bad one, by his face. I speak the same of
  a chap, live, or dead. You can't hurt him, when he's gone to the devil. And
  if ever I see a man fit for roasting&mdash;and I've been about the world a
  good bit too. But who do you think I saw here, not half an hour agone, sir,
  and made me stare so, when I met you? It never rains, but it pours sure
  enough, about Dartmoor; though I knew from my father, that you were there,
  colonel. Why the poor young captain, young enough he was then, who told such
  a pile of lies, to save his brother, and was ready to be shot for it, without
  a button moving. There was only myself, and one other man beside their two
  selves, that knew all about it."</p>

  <p>"Howell, you surprise me;" answered Colonel Westcombe; leading him to a
  retired tomb stone; "I have always understood&mdash;is it possible, that any
  man can have sacrificed himself so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I suppose, they made it square between them, for the younger
  one to take the shame, with a heap of cash to ease it. The elder one gave
  £50, for me, and Bill Hosier, to divide&mdash;the only two that could swear
  to the truth&mdash;upon oath to hold our tongues about it. And not being
  asked, why should we speak, sir, when they had settled it between them?"</p>

  <p>"That was your view of it, and natural enough. But how could you two alone
  know the truth, and be out of all doubt concerning it?"</p>

  <p>"Simply enough, sir; as you will say. The night was like pitch, you may
  remember; and after ten hours in saddle, our eyelids was the brightest part
  of them. The shame of it turned upon the question, which of them two crossed
  the river; for the one that had crossed could have nothing to do with the
  runaway&mdash;make, or mention it. And it may sound queer, but true it is,
  the night being such, and the wood so black, and the boat-bridge so dangerous
  in the dark, not one of us might have been sure, next morning, which of the
  brothers came with us, without a little causal accident. Leastways, the two
  were so much alike, in size, and voice, and standing, that I could not have
  sworn which was which, in the dark, against their own word about it. Although
  I should have known, in my own mind, which it was, from his manner of giving
  orders. But there happened to be, on the further bank, a pit of white stuff,
  as white as pipe-clay; and into that our captain popped, up to the tops of
  his big saddle-boots, and Bill Hosier, and me, gave a hand to pull him out.
  The bridge was unsafe in the dark for horses, so we crossed on foot, to keep
  a look-out there.</p>

  <p>"Colonel, I ran away, as fast as anybody, when the great alarm arose; back
  over the bridge, in a twinkling, every one of us, and up on the first horse
  we could lay hold of, and skittered on the heels of the rest of them. The
  captain drew his sword, and stood before us, but the rush of men went over
  him, and he had the place all to himself and welcome. In the morning we slunk
  back, all straggling anyhow, and ashamed to look at one another; and he must
  have slipped from a by-road in among us, to share the disgrace of the lot of
  us. And he did more than that, he took it all upon himself, when the general
  rode up to inquire; and you know the rest, as well as I do. But Hosier, and
  I, saw the white stuff on his boots, and could swear where that had come
  from, and who was the only man that kept his post, and tried to deliver us
  from being laughed at; and his name was 'Captain Arthur Pole.'"</p>

  <p>"And you were content to stand by, and see him shot, for the sake of £50,
  you scoundrels!"</p>

  <p>"No, Colonel Westcombe, that is not fair. The money was not spoken of,
  till after that, when his life was out of danger. But you know what the
  service was, and what men are. Neither Hosier, nor I, had a chance to open
  mouth. We were all under guard, and could not get at one another; and we did
  not hear a word of what was going on. Bill thought, the same, as I did, until
  we got together, that the saddle would surely be put on the right horse. And
  when we were brought out to see the execution, 'Silence' was the order, and
  not one of us dare move; though our flesh upon our bones was creeping. If one
  of us had broken rank, a bullet would be through him. For the general, to add
  to our disgrace, had drawn the rest of the Light Division round us. Ah,
  colonel, I never shall forget that day. But we made up for all of it
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Ay, that you did. You were desperate fellows. I never shall forget the
  next time you were in action. Howell, I am delighted to have heard your tale.
  It has solved a great mystery, that has lasted many years. I suppose you are
  ready to make oath to it, before any magistrate, if called upon."</p>

  <p>"At any moment, colonel. And Bill Hosier is living. I came across him, not
  so very long ago. He keeps the <i>Nag's Head</i> at Ipswich."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Say no more about it, unless you are called upon to do so. But
  don't leave this neighbourhood, without my knowledge."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch53"
     id="ch53">CHAPTER LIII. &mdash; RESIGNATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before any one, at Touchwood Park, could hear of the great
  calamity, a letter from Mr. Short arrived, with assurance of Dicky's safety.
  But the young squire, thinking that they well deserved a fright, had added
  these words, without the parson's knowledge. "It is true that I am spared;
  but in divine retribution on my father's impious scheme, I bear upon my brow,
  for ever, the vivid impression of a high-dried ham. We are all marked with
  something; and I am marked with this, from its constant presence in my mind.
  However, it makes no difference."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a word of it," said Miss Touchwood; "Dicky always has
  been a dreadful story-teller. And if he has got it, we can rub it out with
  pumice-stone, and squeeze a little <i>aqua fortis</i> in. Don't be so
  foolish, mother dear. He would have written three pages, if it were true. And
  even if it is, why should we weep? He will be useful in the world, at last,
  by giving people an appetite. And it proves how right my father was, in
  choosing his vocation. He can show a sample of his goods; and they dare not
  run a skewer through it."</p>

  <p>"Julia, you have no feeling. That has always been your fault. Oblige me,
  by ordering the carriage, at once. Mr. Short begs me earnestly, not to go
  over, because of the awful sights, and scenes. But what scene can be
  imagined, half so awful, as the Grecian countenance of my only son, with a
  high-dried ham upon its brow? I shall go, and tell your father my opinion of
  him. Don't talk to me about men, after that." In spite of all his strength of
  mind, Sir Joseph got the worst of it, and was glad to hear wheels at the
  door, once again.</p>

  <p>In such a condition of things, Miss Touchwood had no idea of being left
  behind. With a quickness of kindness, which did her credit, she put on a
  pretty half-mourning dress, with a gentle imaginative want of pattern, and a
  mildness of lustre, like tears that are suppressed. It became her wonderfully
  well; and she was not entirely ignorant of that fact.</p>

  <p>Not far from the turn-pike, they overtook a very nice old gentleman, a
  squire in a poor way now, but rich with long descent of education (even as
  <i>Nous</i> among dogs was); and he never was arrogant to the Touchwoods,
  although he was so much poorer. Now Julia had a weakness for nice old
  gentlemen, as handsome and clever girls often have; and so she invited Squire
  Wrey into the carriage, little dreaming of the consequence to her own life.
  For Mr. Wrey, who had been present in the church, and about among the people
  afterwards, could speak of nothing else, but the grandeur, and sublimity, of
  Mr. Short's behaviour. Like a strenuous churchman, and stiff-hearted Tory, he
  almost considered this great blow a blessing, from the glory accruing to the
  Established Church.</p>

  <p>"'Heroic,' is scarcely the word for it, madam," he said, (being rather
  hard of hearing) in reply to Lady Touchwood's agonised inquiry, whether her
  son had a ham on his forehead; "you pronounce it heroic; and you may well do
  so. But it was something much higher than that. There was a grandeur of
  self-possession, a dignity, a trust in Providence, combined with a majestic
  self-reliance, and a nobility of presence&mdash;although I am sure he must
  have longed to be somewhere else&mdash;which inspired us all, like the voice
  of a Nelson; but with a more tranquil, and lofty courage. With a beam,
  computed at three quarters of a ton, crashing, as you may say, between him,
  and the clerk (who made off with all celerity), this reverend, and most
  resolute, gentleman stuck to his text, till he couldn't hear his own voice.
  And after that, when there were seven people killed, and sixty-two wounded,
  and the church all in rags, did he say, 'let us run away'? No, madam, he
  said, 'let us pray.' And his prayer saved fifty lives at least; for if the
  survivors had all rushed out, one shudders to think of what must have
  happened. I never heard a grander prayer in all my life; though I like them
  out of the prayer-book, best."</p>

  <p>"But how could he see above the beam?" asked Julia; "he is so&mdash; I
  mean he is not very tall."</p>

  <p>"In the moment of trial, he seemed to tower. His moral elevation raised
  him, so that he looked gigantic in the smoke. Depend upon it, my dear young
  lady, no warrior in the battle-field has ever performed any feat of valour,
  half so noble, half so heroic&mdash;for after all, that is the word for
  it."</p>

  <p>"But has my son got a ham on his forehead?" Lady Touchwood almost shouted;
  so difficult was it to get a word in. "It is not at all unlikely," the squire
  answered calmly; "most people have got some mark, or other. One highly
  respectable young woman has a grid-iron with seven bars; so that they might
  &mdash;. But I must not make light of your anxiety, Lady Touchwood. Even if
  he has, how thankful you must feel!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed then, I shall not. I shall never get over it. How much longer in
  going up this hill? Julia, call out to him, to whip them well."</p>

  <p>"Your son has behaved with most admirable kindness," the old gentleman
  resumed, to make amends; "I hear golden words everywhere of him, Lady
  Touchwood. He has spent every farthing of his money; and what is more, he has
  worked like a horse with his own hands."</p>

  <p>"He always does spend every farthing of his money," replied his sarcastic
  sister; "but it is quite a new thing, for him to work with his own hands,
  like a horse. But here we are! Dicky, take your hat off, and show us the ham,
  upon your classic brow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was only to bring you over, and to get the governor into a row,"
  Squire Dicky replied, without a blush, and in like style eluding the maternal
  hug. "No, no; not a hair have I turned yet; though I hear that Betty Cork
  lost a good five pounds' worth, not long come from Exeter. Come and see
  Short; he is a splendid fellow. You ought to have corking pins stuck into
  your backs, and the salting stool to sit against; instead of white silk and
  eider-down. Then you might understand some little of my doings. I am an
  altered man, from this day forth."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't care; so long as your face is the same." His dear mother
  wetted a lace handkerchief, from natural sources, and polished the marble of
  his Grecian forehead.</p>

  <p>"An altered man! An altered boy;" exclaimed the jealous Julia. "But any
  change must be for the better. There is no change yet, in fibs and brag. What
  have you done? Mr. Short has done it all."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed he has not;" cried the parson, coming out from the sick house
  Dick was entering; "Lady Touchwood, your son is a wonderful fellow. I had not
  the least idea, of the good stuff in him. He has been up all night, he has
  torn up all his linen, he has put up, like an angel, with any quantity of
  groans, and&mdash;and really, he has not once asked for so much as a single
  glass of beer!"</p>

  <p>"Then he must be an altered character indeed;" said Julia, looking
  incredulous.</p>

  <p>"You frighten me. Such things are out of all nature. Robert," exclaimed
  Lady Touchwood, "drive at once to the <i>Horse-shoes,</i> or whatever the
  place is called, and bring half-a-dozen of their best bottled ale. Oh, Mr.
  Short, can I ever be thankful enough, for this wonderful preservation. But,
  to carry it so far, is tempting heaven. Don't mind me. I shall get over it,
  if allowed to sit with Richard."</p>

  <p>Mr. Short saw that he was not wanted; for her ladyship now desired to cry.
  "I would ask you, if you can spare a moment," said the ready Julia, "to show
  me, at least, the outside of the church."</p>

  <p>"Gladly would I show you the inside too," replied Mr. Short, without any
  second meaning; "but I fear that it would be too great a venture. Stones, and
  beams, keep tumbling down."</p>

  <p>"I should have no fear, with you to guide me," she answered, in her
  softest voice, with a glance that made him tremble more, than the most
  furious electric flash; "oh, how I do admire lofty courage, and grand
  chivalry!"</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Mr. Short; "but one doesn't know where to find them. I
  believe that the only brave creature in the church&mdash;for I know that I
  was scared out of all my seven senses&mdash;was that beautiful Miss Arthur.
  For one moment, there came a lane of light between us, from some driftage of
  the smoke and reek; and there she stood, like a glorious Greek statue; not
  defiant, not dramatic, but simply with her courage gathered, to live, or to
  die, as the will of God might be. The sweet nobility of her face was beyond
  all the powers of sculpture."</p>

  <p>"No doubt. That young lady is gifted with graces, which always have the
  fortune to come out. Others must always disappear, the moment she appears
  upon the scene. She must have some wonderful transcendant height of courage,
  by which she defies the lightning, and fries fish. How long have you
  worshipped that Greek statue, Mr. Short?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, Miss Touchwood, I had no idea, that you could talk such
  nonsense, if you tried. I am old enough to be little Rose's father, and I
  don't fall in love with the girls I christen. As it is, I have set my heart
  on a young lady, much too young for me to think of, in my nine and thirtieth
  year. I am even supposed to be older than that, from the dryness of my
  sermons, and the absence of anything florid in my theology; as well as
  because I keep my hair so short&mdash;and other things ladies cannot enter
  into."</p>

  <p>"Yes they can. I demand to know them all; because my mother thinks so much
  of you. I have heard of Mrs. Aggett being sadly roasted; and it makes me so
  anxious, about&mdash;about your dinners. Mr. Wrey says that you have tasted
  nothing, but brimstone and bitumen, since your Sunday breakfast. I wish I
  knew anything about cooking&mdash;like the Greek statue&mdash;but I don't, I
  don't. Oh, Mr. Short, who is that young lady, so much too young, for you to
  think of? Will she let me come, and help her? For you are sure to have
  her."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had any such faith in my powers. Will you promise to help me,
  with all your heart; if I tell you who it is?"</p>

  <p>Miss Touchwood nodded blandly, and with an inexpressible slyness in her
  brilliant eyes, which even Mr. Short could not interpret. But he said to
  himself, "now, neck or nothing!"</p>

  <p>"The young lady's name is Julia Touchwood. And I have loved her, for
  several years."</p>

  <p>"And you had every right to do it;" said Julia, in her straightforward
  way; "and the lovely object has long suspected, that you felt an interest in
  her. But she waited for a proof, of what you were; because she has not much
  faith in words. And now she has got the proof; and is very proud to get
  it."</p>

  <p>"Then, Julia, do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do; and you may repent it. But I am too proud ever to repent;
  even when my mother has boxed my ears. Oh, Mr. Short, you won't do that?"</p>

  <p>The place was a lonely one, and Mr. Short (scarcely believing in his good
  luck) did something else, to feel sure of things. And Julia said, "It is
  resignation; remember now, it is resignation only; which I have heard you
  insist upon, as at once a duty, and a blessing."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch54"
     id="ch54">CHAPTER LIV. &mdash; CONJUGATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ashamed of furious outbreak, and fierce outrage upon tree,
  and flower, and friendly banks that cradle it, the Christow brook fell back
  to music, thoughtful pools, and smiling shallows. Among the captain's pears,
  remained the "witnessed usurpation;" but not a tree was washed away; so
  prudently had he taken heed of the possible range of water. Neither were his
  grapes much hurt; for no hail fell, within the focus of the storm; though
  around its margin, as at Plymouth and at Hatherleigh, hailstones as large as
  turkeys' eggs, and some of even 9-oz. weight, are reported to have fallen.
  Some of his bunches had their rich bloom slurred by the violence of rain, and
  some were splashed; but the tan had saved most of them from this; and upon
  the whole, they looked bright and handsome; and he might sell them, if so
  minded, as noble earls do nowadays, to turn an honest sixpence.</p>

  <p>Reluctant still to take the needful plunge into the world of uproar,
  strife, deceit, and greed; and knowing that his interests could not suffer,
  in the hands of the good solicitors; he lingered awhile among his favourites,
  nearer to his nature, than pomp or luxury, wealth, or grandeur. For a week of
  bright October weather (the golden reckoning of fine years) was gleaming
  gently round all fruitage, with tender touch to ripen it. In the lovely
  afternoon, of tempered sun, and mellow shade, the captain took his accustomed
  course, with a tranquil mind, among tranquil things. Then a brisk step, as of
  an elderly man, going more on his heels than he used to do, fell softly,
  where the leaves were falling, and the grass was touched with gray.</p>

  <p>Colonel Westcombe held out his hand, and bowed&mdash;a low bow, such as he
  never offered, even to the most exalted rank, unless his heart went with it.
  The captain looked at him, with some surprise, knowing what his nature was;
  and even with some pain, as if there were ceremony put between them.</p>

  <p>"I am heartily ashamed to look at you;" said the colonel, gazing none the
  less, with his thick gray eyebrows moving; "what a fool I have been, for
  trusting facts, instead of trusting character!"</p>

  <p>"You have been the kindest of the kind," the captain answered warmly;
  "when every one else disdained me, you had doubts, whether I deserved it. And
  I am not sure, that I do not. A man is too prone to acquit himself. But who
  has told you anything?"</p>

  <p>"Everything has been told me, by a man who knows all about it. I resolved
  to think it over first; lest I should seem to seek you, through your altered
  position in the world. But a little thought convinced me, that it was mean to
  imagine, that a man like you would impute such motives to me. So I waited for
  the month you fixed, and came the first day after it."</p>

  <p>"I have been hoping to see you. Come, and sit upon my bench of thought;
  and tell me all that moves your mind."</p>

  <p>"Nothing moves my mind," said Colonel Westcombe, listening thoughtfully to
  the murmur of the brook, and warbling of the independent robin; "so much as
  the wrongs, that we men do to one another, carelessly. Upon our own affairs,
  we cannot make our minds up, though desiring to have perfect balance; but we
  settle another man's business for him, and blast his name, without two
  thoughts. I feel, that I have done this to you; not wantonly, as some people
  have; but narrowly, very narrowly; and I ask your pardon for it. A young man
  would not have judged you so. The longer we live in this world, the less we
  come to know of it."</p>

  <p>"Where is Jack?" asked the captain smiling; "according to your theory, my
  friend, we should call him in, to teach us wisdom."</p>

  <p>"And you would not be so far wrong there. That young man is of very keen
  perception. When old Punk said something, in Jack's hearing, concerning the
  father of a certain lovely girl, my son forgot the reverence due, to those
  who were born before him. Jack has been brought up like a Spartan, under the
  code of&mdash;I forget his name, Solon, or Epaminondas&mdash;and sooner would
  he let the fox gnaw out&mdash;but I never get straight in a metaphor. What I
  mean is, that I told him to stop across the water; and no power on earth can
  bring him over, until he receives the signal. Now I have two points to
  settle. First, for my own satisfaction&mdash;but you need not tell me, unless
  you please&mdash;why did you ruin your life thus? And then, what do you mean
  to do, about my Jack?"</p>

  <p>"I did what I did," said the captain slowly; "because it was impossible,
  not to do it. We have supposed ourselves to be, of many generations, without
  taint. Taint of cowardice, or treachery, I mean; for the taint of any other
  vice seems light. My father knew that his heir, my brother, was of a violent
  weak nature; brave enough, so far as that goes, but in no way steadfast. In
  all, except the heirship, and the money spent upon me, I was always looked
  upon as the elder of the two; and this made my brother dislike me. Or
  perhaps, I have no right to say that, and perhaps the fault was on my side
  too; but we never were comfortable together. When we got our commissions, I
  promised my father, to look after Philip, so far as I could (because he was
  wild and thoughtless), and to keep him from doing disgrace to our name, by
  any unfashionable vices.</p>

  <p>"Philip fought shy of me as much as possible. He believed that I despised
  him, because he was so self-indulgent; and perhaps to some extent, I did. But
  I do not want to puff myself, at his expense. He had always been indulged,
  and had known no curb; while I had the benefit of being kept short. He fell
  into trouble, in London; and my father, who had then much interest, contrived
  to get him sent out to join us, hoping that discipline, and rough work, might
  stiffen up his character. Philip submitted, with a very bad grace; and I saw
  that he would get into some scrape soon, though I little imagined what it
  would be.</p>

  <p>"For I can assure you, Colonel Westcombe, that he was as brave as the best
  of us; as brave, I mean, in mere bodily courage, and contempt of visible
  danger. What ailed him, that night, when he lost his mind so, and rushed away
  headlong, like a tail-piped dog, carrying our men after him, was the terror
  of an evil conscience. He had done an unmanly thing at home; and he paid for
  it, with his manhood. He had seduced, under promise of marriage, a beautiful,
  and innocent young girl, the daughter of one of our chief tenants. Abandoned
  to disgrace, she drowned herself, after writing him a letter, such as no man
  should receive. And now, in the depth of that dark night, by the melancholy
  moaning of the Tagus, her form came slowly up the water to him, bearing her
  dead babe on her breast. He leaped on his horse, and shouted madly, calling
  on his men to save him; the flight was sounded, and away went all, scouring
  out of the ghastly wood, in a panic never known before. My part was simple. I
  had to redeem my promise to my father, and to save the heir of our race, and
  our ancient title, from ignominy. Even my father never knew the truth; for he
  refused to see me, and I could not write against my brother. I lived abroad
  for several years, after marrying a maiden, whom I long had loved, and who
  forsook the world for me. When I lost her, I came back to England, with one
  only little child, and settled in Devon, for my dear wife's sake.</p>

  <p>"Now, whether I have been right, in point of conscience, to maintain a
  lie, is a question for others to decide; who have not been placed as I have.
  But I never have regretted it; and on the whole, my life has been a happy
  one."</p>

  <p>"So it ought to be," said Colonel Westcombe, not disdaining to shed tears.
  "I hope, that I might have done the same. But I fear, that my heart would
  have broken. And to keep the secret all these years, and to be prepared to
  die with it! Pole, you are the noblest man, I have ever known, or heard
  of."</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," said the captain smiling; "there was nothing noble in
  it. Halloa! there is Jack, on our side of the water! You said, no power would
  bring him over."</p>

  <p>"And I said it, in all good faith. What can have brought him? Why Rose,
  dear Rose, my own child Rose&mdash;as you are going to be, I hope,&mdash;what
  has brought you here, in such a flurry?"</p>

  <p>"I am not in a flurry, Colonel Westcombe; I am calm&mdash;considering all
  my treatment. For at least three months, I have had such orders&mdash;not to
  go to this place, and not to go to that&mdash;and then your son, Mr. John
  Westcombe, jumps all across the river, into my carnation bed! It appears to
  me, as if there was no law left. And instead of protecting me, you are going
  to betray me."</p>

  <p>"My darling," said her father; "it is I who must do that. Jack, come here.
  You were brave enough, just now. Rose, don't be foolish. What did I catch you
  doing, under the leather-coat apple tree?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't catch me doing anything, papa&mdash;only having it done to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Very well; so it shall be now. John Westcombe, take her two hands in
  yours; if she will give them, as I think she will. Then the colonel will kiss
  her; and so will I."</p>

  <p>"I will kiss my own dear father first," said the maiden, with a prospect
  of much blushing; "and then Colonel Westcombe&mdash;and that will be quite
  enough."</p>

  <p>Now whether she carried out that arrangement, without the lady's
  postscript to it&mdash;where the gist of the communication lies&mdash;is a
  question for Jack, and herself, alone. For the colonel, and the captain,
  marched away, discussing the days, "when life was life" (because there was so
  much death, to enliven it), and with great breadth of instance, proving how
  sad it would be, to be one's own grandson. Happy is the fine fruit ripening
  thus, with pity for the bloom-bud forming at its base, pleasure in the memory
  of bygone storms, and sunny content with its own rich honour.</p>

  <p>But there was a little tumult yet to come, when General Punk, on a
  Dartmoor charger, twelve hands and a half in height, set forth at the head of
  a vast expedition, to capture, or slay, Black Wenlow. That armament still
  forms a date, in the annals of the moor, and of Okehampton; for verily there
  it was fitted out, the day before great market-day. Every breast was
  inspired, with ancestral valour, every stomach, with contemporary thirst and
  hunger; because the old general stood treat. And if, after that, they caught
  nobody at all, it was simply because there was nobody to catch. As for Guy
  Wenlow, and the very extraordinary things that happened to him, his reasons
  for taking to savage life, his great single-handed encounter with
  <i>Nous,</i> the effect upon his mind of Mr. Gaston's sad end, and the
  marvellous device and ingenuity, by which he built himself a dry house
  beneath the peat, and furnished it purely at his neighbours' expense&mdash;it
  would be a Wenlovian, or even a Munrovian act, on our part, to pirate the
  work, which Mr. Short has in hand, upon that subject.</p>

  <p>Neither has Mr. Short yet finished that "Song of the Rose," which he
  promised to the world; for which delay there are two good reasons&mdash;the
  first, that Dicky Touchwood, upon his return to Cambridge, developed
  extraordinary poetic power (which raised him above all competition), whether
  from the way in which he was taken off his feet, or whether from such sense
  of wrong, as invented the iambus. And a still better reason was, that Julia,
  though generally submissive, and enwrapped in children&mdash;who were called
  "the tall Shorts" every where&mdash;could, by no fallacy of connubial logic,
  be urged into sufferance of such an outrage.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the best reason of all was this&mdash;that the subject was
  above him; as the beauty of the rose is above imagination; because it is
  nature's beauty.</p>

  <p>Yet, the purest, and grandest beauty, (far beyond that of the fairest
  flower, and high above nature's noblest work), is of the mind and soul, that
  labour to enlarge our humble course; by no defiance, or heroism, or even
  conscious teaching; but by patience, cheerfulness, and modesty, truth,
  simplicity, and loving-kindness.</p>
