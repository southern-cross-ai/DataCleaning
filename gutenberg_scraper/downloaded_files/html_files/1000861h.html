  <p class="cp"><small><i>There is nothing so powerful as truth&mdash;and often
  nothing so strange.</i> &mdash;Daniel Webster</small></p>

  <h3>First published by Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1947<br>
  First UK edition: Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1948</h3>
  <hr>

  <h3 style="page-break-before:always">THE STORY</h3>

  <p class="blurb">This is the story of two modern people&mdash;a young
  American who, both as a scientist and as a man, faced some of the biggest
  problems of our times; and the girl who gave him all her heart and brain.</p>

  <p class="blurb">When Jane met Dr. Mark Bradley in London she was only
  eighteen. She and her mother were both attracted by "Brad," and the situation
  thus engendered proved fateful, since it led to Brad's association with a
  great Viennese physicist and to his involvement in a tragic drama. But there
  was another drama, larger and less personal, that drew him into its widening
  orbit, a drama that became a secret and later an obsession.</p>

  <p class="blurb">Probing yet protective, Jane's love makes the strong thread
  in a pattern of deeply moving and significant events&mdash;strange events,
  too&mdash;and yet, to quote Daniel Webster, there is often "nothing so
  strange" as the truth.</p>

  <p class="blurb">Although the earlier scenes of <i>Nothing So Strange</i> are
  laid abroad, its outlook is American and its climax could only have taken
  place in America. It is as exciting and as human as anything Mr. Hilton has
  ever written.</p>

  <h2><a id="part1"
     name="part1">PART ONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Yes, I knew him," I said, "but it was years ago&mdash;in
  England...."</p>

  <p>You can make things sound very simple when you are answering questions on
  oath and there is a girl at a side table scribbling shorthand and giving
  little shrugs of appeal if the words come too fast. You don't know what the
  questioner is trying to get at, and you almost feel that your answers are
  cross-examining him; you watch for the extra flicker of interest, the sudden
  sharpness of the next question. And all the time, behind the facts as you
  truthfully state them, there's the real truth that you remember slowly, as
  when you stretch in bed the morning after a long walk and explore the aches.
  That, of course, isn't the kind of truth you've promised to tell, but it
  probably shows in your eyes and makes you look as if you were hiding
  something. Which, in a sense, you are.</p>

  <p>"Where did you first meet him?"</p>

  <p>"In London. At a party."</p>

  <p>"When was that?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen thirty-six. I remember it because of all the Mrs. Simpson talk
  that was going on." (The unsolicited detail, to account for an answer that
  had been perhaps too prompt.)</p>

  <p>"Were you friendly?"</p>

  <p>"Off and on&mdash;for a time."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean ... well ... some weeks I might see him twice or three times,
  other weeks I wouldn't see him at all.... I didn't have an affair with him,
  if that's what <i>you</i> mean."</p>

  <p>Shock tactics, but it failed; the man across the table referred to his
  notes and said quietly: "You were seventeen."</p>

  <p>"Eighteen," I corrected, but he had killed my line. I can't help it; I act
  profusely when I'm nervous, and I'm nervous often when I've no need to be.
  It's the same when I hear a motorcycle overtaking my car along a parkway,
  even though I know I can't possibly be guilty of anything; or, perhaps more
  subtly, because I don't know I can't possibly be guilty of anything.</p>

  <p>Not that the man across the table looked like anyone to be afraid of. He
  had sandy hair, blue eyes, a nose that looked small because the chin and the
  mouth were set so squarely, a pink healthy complexion, rather pudgy hands. I
  would not have noticed him in the street or a crowd, but if I had had to sit
  in a dentist's waiting room and stare at somebody, it might have been at him
  for choice. He wore a bow tie, dark blue pin-stripe suit, white shirt, and I
  couldn't see what kind of shoes under the table. His name (from the letter he
  had written me, fixing the appointment to see him) was Henry W. Small. It
  didn't particularly suit him, except that it was a good name to go unnoticed
  by.</p>

  <p>"Bradley was then twenty-four," he continued, referring again to his
  notes. Then he looked up. "What was he doing?"</p>

  <p>"Studying at London University. So was I. That's how we met."</p>

  <p>"You said it was at a party."</p>

  <p>"Yes, a dinner party given by a professor. We were fellow guests."</p>

  <p>"Did you get to know him well at that party?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't speak to him till afterwards and then only a few words. When I
  met him again at the college I knew him just about enough to say hello to.
  Then gradually a bit more than that, but not <i>much</i> more. He wasn't the
  kind of person you get to know <i>well</i>."</p>

  <p>"Did he have other friends?"</p>

  <p>"Very few, I should say."</p>

  <p>"Did you meet any of them?"</p>

  <p>"Not often."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet anyone called Sanstrom?"</p>

  <p>"Sanstrom?... No, I don't think I remember the name."</p>

  <p>"But you're not certain?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's nine years ago. I can't remember the names of everyone who
  might have been at some college party."</p>

  <p>"You lived a rather social life?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly."</p>

  <p>"More of a social life than Bradley, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you knew everybody and he didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. He knew them, but they were more acquaintances than friends. He
  wasn't easy to be friendly with."</p>

  <p>"Would you call him <i>un</i>friendly then?"</p>

  <p>"No, no ... not that at all. He was just ... well, shy. There was a sort
  of barrier you had to break down."</p>

  <p>"Ah, a barrier. And you broke it down?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps partly."</p>

  <p>"So that you became his only real friend?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't say that either.... The fact was, he worked so hard he
  hadn't much time for personal contacts of any kind."</p>

  <p>"Where was he living?"</p>

  <p>"In furnished rooms."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever visit him there?"</p>

  <p>"Once&mdash;but only for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"Would you say&mdash;from that one visit&mdash;that his style of life
  fitted with the job he had?"</p>

  <p>"Oh sure. He didn't earn much money and everything about him looked like
  it."</p>

  <p>"Where were you living then?"</p>

  <p>"With my parents. They had a house in Hampstead. They usually went over
  for the summer."</p>

  <p>"Were Bradley's rooms also in Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>"No. In Belsize Park. Or Chalk Farm. Just a few miles away."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;Belsize Park or Chalk Farm? Don't you know
  which?"</p>

  <p>"Belsize Park if you wanted a good address, Chalk Farm if you didn't care.
  He didn't care."</p>

  <p>He looked puzzled, but he made a note of Belsize Park or Chalk Farm. "Now
  on these occasions when you met him, Miss Waring, what did you usually talk
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Everyday things. Sometimes my work."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever discuss his work?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't have&mdash;it was far out of my range. I was taking history.
  His stuff was mathematics, physics, and that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"So he could discuss history although it wasn't his subject?"</p>

  <p>"Anybody can discuss history whether it's their subject or not. But try
  talking about mathematics with an expert when you've never got beyond
  quadratic equations."</p>

  <p>"All right.... Did you ever discuss America?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes he spoke of his boyhood on a farm. Dakota, I think. Early
  struggles ... all that."</p>

  <p>"Politics?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. Just news in the paper. The Wally Simpson business, if you call
  that politics. We didn't agree about it&mdash;I was against the marriage, he
  was all for it."</p>

  <p>"Did he like living in London?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. Most Americans do."</p>

  <p>"You mean you did yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever say whether he preferred England or America ... or perhaps
  some other country?"</p>

  <p>"Goodness, no. It wasn't what he preferred, it was where he could work.
  London University gave him a research fellowship."</p>

  <p>"And American universities wouldn't?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe they hadn't any&mdash;of the kind he wanted."</p>

  <p>"So he might have had a grudge against them&mdash;or perhaps against
  American life in general?"</p>

  <p>"A <i>grudge</i>? That man never had a grudge even when he ought to have
  had."</p>

  <p>As soon as I said it I regretted the emphasis; I knew it would lead to
  questions I wouldn't answer at all. They came.</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Just that he wasn't the type for harboring grudges. He lived for his work
  and nothing else mattered."</p>

  <p>"You don't think he could ever be actuated by a motive to get even with
  somebody?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't think so."</p>

  <p>"You can't recall any incident of such a kind?"</p>

  <p>"No. Never."</p>

  <p>"In fact you never saw anything wrong with him at all, did you, Miss
  Waring?"</p>

  <p>I caught a faint smile on his face and answered it with a big one of my
  own. "Of course I did&mdash;he was far too tied to his work for any girl to
  think him faultless."</p>

  <p>"So he didn't take you out enough?"</p>

  <p>I laughed. "No, not nearly enough." I felt we were establishing the right
  mood and it would all be plain sailing if I stuck to it.</p>

  <p>"Did he have other girl-friends?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't know anything about his love life. I never asked
  him questions about it. And incidentally, Mr. Small, why are <i>you</i>asking
  all this about him now? How did you find out I ever knew him?"</p>

  <p>"Just let me put the questions, Miss Waring." There was nothing brusque or
  unkindly in that, just a carefully measured firmness.</p>

  <p>"But I don't see why you shouldn't tell me. If he's in any trouble I'd
  want to help him."</p>

  <p>"Why?" The question shot out at me like the fang of a non-poisonous
  snake.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;well, because I like him."</p>

  <p>"Still?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense. I don't forget people I've once liked, and I did like him. Is
  that extraordinary of me? Well, as I said, I'd want to help him if ... if I
  could, that is. Maybe I couldn't. I suppose it depends on the kind of trouble
  he's in...."</p>

  <p>I stopped, realizing he was just letting me talk. When he could see I
  didn't intend to go on, he said: "Why should you expect him to be in any
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say I expected it. I said <i>if</i> he is."</p>

  <p>"What put such a possibility in your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're questioning me about him as if he'd done something wrong.
  Or aren't you? Isn't this a branch of the F.B.I, or something?"</p>

  <p>He took out a cigarette case and pushed it across the table towards me.
  "Smoke?"</p>

  <p>I said no thanks, because I thought my hand might tremble while I held a
  cigarette for him to light.</p>

  <p>He went on: "How long since you had any communication with Bradley?"</p>

  <p>"Oh years. Not since before the war. The English war&mdash;1939."</p>

  <p>"Nineteen thirty-six being the year you knew him in London?"</p>

  <p>"That's right." I thought: Now it's coming; and was inspired to add
  quickly: "My parents and I returned to America the following year."</p>

  <p>"Did <i>he</i> return to America?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of."</p>

  <p>"At any rate you didn't see him in America?"</p>

  <p>"No, never."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he write you any letters?"</p>

  <p>"Only a few&mdash;for a while. Then we lost touch. I wish you'd give me
  his present address if you have it."</p>

  <p>"So that you could renew your friendship?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not that, but I'd write to him&mdash;for old time's sake."</p>

  <p>"And offer your help?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if he needed any."</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly. Then he lit a cigarette for himself and leaned back in
  the swivel chair. "Tell me, Miss Waring&mdash;and please remember I'm not
  trying to trap you into anything you don't want to say&mdash;all I'd like is
  a personal opinion, just between ourselves...." He made a finger gesture to
  the girl taking shorthand. "Miss Sutton, don't put this down&mdash;it's off
  the record...."</p>

  <p>My father always said that when anyone ever tells you something is off the
  record you should be doubly on your guard; so I was, instantly, and
  concentrated on trying not to show it. I smiled, pretending to relax. He went
  on: "You're a very loyal person&mdash;I can see that. Loyal to friends, just
  as you'd be loyal to your country. When you first got to know Bradley and
  found yourself beginning to like him, naturally you'd hope to find in him the
  same kind of loyalties. Did you?... Or were you ever a little disappointed in
  some ways?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. I liked him. When you like people you don't weigh
  them up like that. At least I don't."</p>

  <p>"You never felt there might be things he was keeping from you?"</p>

  <p>"We weren't close enough friends for me even to think about it. He wasn't
  a very talkative person, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You mean that if he'd had any secrets he'd probably not have shared them
  with you?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not. And I might not have shared mine with him. We were neither of
  us the tell-everything type."</p>

  <p>He looked at me till I thought I was going to blush, so of course I did
  blush. As if satisfied, he pressed down the clasp of his briefcase and stood
  up. I saw then that he wore black shoes.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Waring, I guess that's about all. Thank you for coming
  over.... And if by any chance we should need to bother you again...."</p>

  <p>"It's no bother at all to <i>me</i>, but I have an idea something must be
  bothering <i>you</i>. Can't you let me in on it?"</p>

  <p>"No," he said, smiling completely for the first time. He had good strong
  teeth and the smile made rather babyish dimples. I took off ten years from my
  first guess of his age; perhaps he was thirty-five.</p>

  <p>"A secret?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Top secret?" (They like you to use their jargon.)</p>

  <p>"Just a secret." (Perhaps it wasn't their jargon.)</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>I smiled back and walked towards the door. He overtook me, yet somehow
  without hurry, before I reached it; turning the handle, he put himself with
  me in the doorway. "Nice of you to come so promptly. I hope you didn't make a
  special trip&mdash;any time within a few days would have been all right."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I go downtown quite a lot."</p>

  <p>"Your father's office?"</p>

  <p>"Oftener the Village. More in my line than Wall Street."</p>

  <p>"Ah yes, of course. Writers and artists." He cupped my elbow with his
  hand. "I'll have to think over your request for Brad's address. Might be able
  to oblige you, though of course we're not a bureau of missing persons....
  Well, thanks again.... Good-by."</p>

  <p>"But he isn't exactly missing if you know his address, is he?... Good-by,
  Mr. Small."</p>

  <p>In the elevator going down I thought I had done rather well. Or had I?...
  Suddenly I realized that he had called him <i>Brad.</i> Was that to test me?
  But of course I would have admitted readily enough that I used to call him
  Brad. Nothing significant about that. It was probably their
  technique&mdash;to leave you with a feeling that they know more than you
  think they know, so that you can chew it all over and work up a fine state of
  nerves afterwards.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I took a taxi uptown and had early dinner alone at the
house. There were
  plenty of friends I could have called up, but I didn't feel like making a
  date with anyone, or even going to a movie later on by myself. The weather
  was probably the last cold spell of the winter; a bitter wind swept in from
  the north, and ice crackled where there had been any water in the gutters.
  Even after a couple of cocktails the dining room looked so big and dreary I
  was glad to have coffee upstairs and turn on all the lights in my personal
  rooms. It's a cheerful suite on the fifth floor&mdash;bedroom, bathroom,
  dressing room, and den; I was allotted them as a child, and have never wanted
  anything bigger, even when the rest of the house was free for me to choose
  from. The furniture is good solid stuff from either New or Old England; my
  mother probably bought it at the auctions she liked to frequent. And the
  heating vents are built in the window sills, so that you lean on them and
  burn your elbows if you want to look down and see what's going on in the
  street. Nothing much, as a rule; those middle sixties between Park and Fifth
  keep pretty quiet. That evening, as I looked down, I saw the familiar steam
  curling out of the manholes, and from the look of it as it scurried I knew
  the temperature had dropped a good deal since I left the downtown office. The
  low sky held captive the glow of the city; anglewise across Park Avenue I
  could see the Rockefeller buildings lost in clouds about the thirtieth floor.
  John came in to pull the blinds; I told him not to bother, I would do it
  myself later.</p>

  <p>"There's still supposed to be some rule about lights," he said.</p>

  <p>"All right, then, pull them down." At that stage of the war New York
  didn't bother much about the partial blackout, but John's a stickler about
  such things. We've been real friends from my childhood. My father enticed him
  from a duke about twenty years ago, since when he's become naturalized, but
  he still calls himself English except when English visitors ask him if he is,
  then he says he's American or, if further pressed, a Scot.</p>

  <p>"Are you going out again, Miss Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Not me, I'm off to bed soon with a good book."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>Forever Amber</i>, I hope?" He has a corny humor, unchanged from
  the time I was young enough to appreciate nothing else.</p>

  <p>"No. I take my history straight. Always did, ever since I studied it in
  London."</p>

  <p>I don't know what made me bring that up, but I realized it was the second
  time that day I had mentioned something that I often go months without even
  thinking about.</p>

  <p>He said, as he pulled the blinds and then the curtains: "I'd like to see
  London again sometime."</p>

  <p>"You probably could, when the war's over."</p>

  <p>"They say it's considerably changed."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet our part hasn't. Hampstead Heath and round about there."</p>

  <p>"Several bombs fell near the house, I've been told," he said thoughtfully.
  It was still "the house" to us both. "Can I get you anything?"</p>

  <p>"No thanks&mdash;I'll be asleep very soon, I'm terribly tired. Good night,
  John."</p>

  <p>After he had gone I stood at the window, pulling aside the blinds just
  enough to see that it had begun to snow. The two great cities, each with its
  own flavor, hold you like rival suitors, perversely when you are with the
  other; and that night, as I watched the pavement whitening, I thought of
  those other pavements that were called roadways, and the subways tubes, and
  the whole long list of equivalents Brad and I once compiled as we tramped
  across Hampstead Heath on a day when other things were in our minds.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I first met him at Professor Byfleet's house in Chelsea,
but I didn't
  catch his name when we were introduced, or perhaps we weren't&mdash;the
  English are apt to be slack about that sort of thing, they are civil but not
  solicitous to strangers, and when you visit one of their houses for the first
  time it's hard not to feel you are among a family of initiates, or else a
  dues-paying but nonvoting member of a very closed-shop union.</p>

  <p>This dinner at the Byfleets' wasn't anything important, at least by
  comparison with many we went to; Byfleet was an anthropologist who wanted my
  father to finance an expedition to New Guinea, so he doubtless thought he'd
  have us meet his friends. I suppose they'd all been told we were rich
  Americans, with the blow softened by adding that my mother was English. My
  father never did finance the expedition, anyhow.</p>

  <p>As I said, I don't remember actually meeting Brad, but when we got to the
  table I noticed him some way further down on the other side, next to my
  mother. Now and again I glanced at him, and with a rather odd feeling that I
  had seen him somewhere before, though I couldn't be sure; he was good-looking
  in a restrained way, with dark, deep-sunken eyes, a long straight nose, and a
  chin that was firm without being aggressive. There was also a mood of gravity
  over him, tempered by a sort of intermittent nervousness as if he were
  waiting for a chance to say something, not because he wanted to, or had
  anything to say, but because he thought everyone must be wondering why up to
  halfway through dinner he hadn't spoken a word. I hoped my mother would soon
  take pity on him, but his other partner moved first, and I could see that the
  more she tried to draw him out the more he drew himself in. She was one of
  those voluble unkempt Englishwomen who invade a conversation rather than take
  part in it, and have a conspiratorial smile for the maid or butler, just to
  show they've been to the house before.</p>

  <p>I missed what was happening across the table for a while, for my own
  neighbor engaged me, a hearty professor of biology who mentioned, apropos of
  the veal cutlets, that man had only scratched the surface of his possible
  gastronomic repertoire, that practically the entire insect world was an
  untapped storehouse of taste novelties, that dried locusts made an excellent
  sandwich, that there were many edible caterpillars fancied by the Chinese,
  and that native tribes in the Andean foothills pick lice from each other's
  heads and eat them with gusto. He seemed surprised when I wasn't upset, and
  after I had accepted another cutlet he confessed that he often opened up like
  that to <i>jeunes filles</i> whom he found himself next to at dinners,
  because in the event that they were bores their distress at least made them
  momentarily entertaining; but he could see I was not a bore, so perhaps I
  would now talk about something serious. I said I could never talk seriously
  to any man with one of those bristly little toothbrush mustaches, and was it
  true that in certain crack regiments of the British Army men were compelled
  to have them? He answered, Good God, how should <i>he</i> know, better ask
  our host, who was a recognized authority on totem and taboo. After that we
  got along fairly well, and presently he paid me what many Englishmen think is
  the supreme compliment; he said he wouldn't have guessed I was American.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I was relieved to see that my mother, across the table, was
  talking to her nervous neighbor. I knew then that everything would be all
  right. She was adept at putting young men, indeed men of any age, at their
  ease; she didn't mind if they talked politics or business or art or
  sport&mdash;even if they were intellectual she never tried to match them at
  it, and if they weren't she would make them feel a freemasonry existing
  between her and them in a world, or at a table, of highbrows. Actually she
  was cleverer than she pretended&mdash;not that she was especially modest, but
  in her bones she felt that men do not like clever women, and what she felt in
  her bones counted more than anything she could think out with her
  intelligence. She had had an upper-crust education composed of governess,
  boarding school, then finishing school abroad, and probably she had forgotten
  95 per cent of everything she had ever learned from textbooks; but she had
  done nothing but travel and meet some of the world's most interesting people
  for almost twenty years, and the result was a quick-minded knowledgeableness
  unspoiled by knowledge. It made her understand politicians rather than
  politics and diplomats rather than diplomacy. She talked plenty of nonsense,
  and it was easy to trap her, though not always to prove that she was trapped;
  and she would go on discussing a book she said she had read but manifestly
  hadn't, or she would break up a dull conversation with some fantastic
  irrelevance for which everyone was secretly grateful.</p>

  <p>After dinner I wasn't anywhere near the nervous man, but when the party
  broke up it appeared we were scheduled to drop him where he lived, which was
  in our direction, and because we were also taking two other guests on their
  way, he sat in front with Henry. We dropped these others first and then he
  moved inside, but there was hardly time for talk before he began urging us
  not to drive out of our way, his place was only a short walk from the main
  road, anywhere near there would do. But my father insisted: "No, no, we'll
  take you right up to your door"; so Brad had to direct Henry through a
  succession of side streets, and eventually gave the stop signal in the middle
  of a long block of four-story houses with basements. He said good-night and
  thanked us, bumping his head against the top of the car as he got out.</p>

  <p>"North Dakota," my father said, as we drove away.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he told me too," said my mother. "I'd have known it was somewhere in
  the Middle West from his accent."</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness for that," I said, and mentioned the Englishman's
  compliment to me.</p>

  <p>My father smiled and seemed in an unusually good humor. He wasn't always,
  after parties at other people's houses. He said: "I find my own Kentucky
  drawl a great help with the English. It makes them think me tough and
  guileless, whereas in reality I'm neither."</p>

  <p>"And in reality you haven't even got a Kentucky drawl," said my
  mother.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I? How would you know?... Well, coming back to Dakota. I had some
  talk with him after the ladies left the table. Seems he's a research lecturer
  at your college, Jane."</p>

  <p>"Then that's where I must have seen him before. I had an idea I had."</p>

  <p>"A young man of promise, from all accounts," my father went on. "Byfleet
  spoke highly of him."</p>

  <p>My mother commented: "If we'd had any sense we'd have dropped him at the
  corner as he asked us. He probably didn't want us to know the sort of place
  he lives in."</p>

  <p>"Oh nonsense. A boy like that, making ends meet on a few fees and
  scholarships&mdash;nobody expects him to stay at the Ritz. Probably has to
  count every penny, same as I did when I was his age in New York. It's good
  for him, anyway, till he gets on his feet.... Brains, good looks, and a
  tuxedo&mdash;what more does he need?"</p>

  <p>"He's very shy," my mother said.</p>

  <p>"That'll wear off."</p>

  <p>"So will the tuxedo. It was frayed at the cuffs already."</p>

  <p>My father looked interested. "You noticed that, Christine? I'll tell you
  what <i>I</i> noticed&mdash;he doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, and he was
  hoping you'd rescue him from that Hathersage woman he was next to, but you
  didn't till nearly the coffee stage.... Must read her new novel, though. They
  say it's good."</p>

  <p>That was typical of my father; he respects achievement and is always
  prepared to weigh it against not liking you, so that in practice he likes you
  if you are successful enough. Julian said that once, and he was successful
  enough; doubtless therefore in those days my father thought Brad was going to
  be successful enough. I remember arguing it out with myself as we drove
  home.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I saw Brad the morning after the Byfleet dinner; we ran
into each other at
  the College entrance in Gower Street. I suppose this was really our first
  meeting; he would have passed me with a nod, but I made him stop. "So you're
  here too?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Hi, there. Sure I am."</p>

  <p>"That was a good party last night."</p>

  <p>"Er ... yes...." Then suddenly, with an odd kind of vehemence: "Though I
  don't like big parties."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't so big. Were you bored?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, not a bit. I'm just no good at them. I don't know what to say to
  people."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. I just chatter when I'm chattered to."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could do that.... Or no, perhaps I don't. It's a terrible waste
  of time."</p>

  <p>"For those who have anything better to do. Do <i>you</i> think you
  have?"</p>

  <p>He looked as if he thought that impertinent. I think now it was.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, smiling.</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather arrogant."</p>

  <p>But now he looked upset. He didn't like being called arrogant.</p>

  <p>"No, no, please don't misunderstand me.... I guess I just tell myself it's
  a waste of time because I can't do it. Especially amongst all the big
  shots&mdash;like last night. I don't know why I was asked."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go?"</p>

  <p>"Professor Byfleet has helped me a lot, I didn't like to refuse."</p>

  <p>"He probably asked you on account of my father, who's an American
  too."</p>

  <p>"I know. He told me. He asked me what my work was, but I was a bit tongue-
  tied. I'm afraid I made a fool of myself."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you did. It's by talking too <i>much</i> that most people
  do that."</p>

  <p>"Personally I agree with you." There was no inferiority complex about him,
  thank goodness. The truculence and the humility were just edges of something
  else.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," I said, "he liked you."</p>

  <p>"<i>Did</i> he?" Because he looked so embarrassed I couldn't think of
  anything else to say. He fidgeted a moment, then glanced at his wrist watch.
  "Well, I must be off to my lecture...." His second smile outweighed the
  abruptness with which he left me standing there.</p>

  <p>When I got home that night I told my mother I had seen him again. She
  said, with a flicker of interest: "Really? I think Harvey had better ask him
  here sometime&mdash;some evening we're just ourselves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But of course there wasn't often such an evening. My
parents both liked
  company; my mother preferred musicians, artists, society people, and my
  father balanced this with businessmen, lawyers, politicians. Without much
  snobbery, he had a very shrewd idea of who was who and who really mattered;
  and in England he felt that he still mattered himself, not merely because he
  was rich, but because few English people appreciated the changes in America
  that had put him out of favor. So also English and foreign politicians
  listened to his advice, not with any idea of taking it, but as an act of
  educating themselves in some mythical American viewpoint which they believed
  he represented, and they were doubtless relieved to find him a generous host
  and a reliable keeper of secrets. I didn't have a feeling that I was ever
  completely close to him, or that, inside his own private world, he had ever
  got over the death of his only son by a former wife during the First World
  War.</p>

  <p>As I said, he wasn't much of a snob, and though he had a connoisseur's
  appreciation of titles and liked to say "Your Excellency" once or twice and
  then call the man Bill, he wouldn't have me presented at Court or "come out"
  in any accepted social sense. It just happened that when I was sixteen I
  began having a place at table if there were a dinner party, though at first I
  would go up to bed soon afterwards; then when I enrolled at the College that
  seemed to make me adult enough to stay up as long as I liked. Most people, no
  doubt, took me for older than my age, just as they took my mother for younger
  if they met her without knowing who she was.</p>

  <p>Ever since I was a child we had come over to England for the summer; once
  we took a house in Grosvenor Street, with real flunkeys, but my mother
  thought that was a bit too grand, so next time my father chose Hampstead, at
  the top of the hill as you climb from the tube station, and that suited them
  both so much that they never looked anywhere else. For many years it had even
  been the same house, which my father would have bought if the portrait
  painter who owned it had been willing to sell. There was a studio attic
  overlooking the Heath, with a huge north window, and from the other upstairs
  rooms you could see the London lights at night and as far as the Crystal
  Palace on a clear day.</p>

  <p>I used to have a favorite walk&mdash;it was along the Spaniards' Road to
  Highgate Village, then back downhill and up again through Parliament Hill
  Fields. I loved it when it was crisp and sunny and windy enough for the
  little ponds to have waves and for the roads to look like bones picked clean.
  There's no place in New York as high as Hampstead Heath and as near to the
  center of things, except of course the roofs of high buildings, where you
  look deep down; but from the Heath you look far over, which is different. My
  father once said you couldn't climb a mere four hundred feet anywhere else in
  the world and feel higher.</p>

  <p>We had good times at that hilltop house, and when Christmas was over in
  New York and we were packing for Florida (where my father got out of the land
  boom in time to keep a fortune), already I was looking forward to April and
  the ocean crossing. Sometimes we spent Easter in Paris, which was exciting,
  but I never wanted to stay there long. Then when I was twelve my father
  thought it was time I gave up governesses and started a proper education, so
  we tossed up whether it should be over here or over there. Out of compliment
  to my mother he asked her to flip the coin, intending (so he told me
  afterwards) to give way if the result disappointed her too much. But it
  didn't, and I went to a boarding school in Delaware for three years, spending
  only a few weeks in London during the summer vacation. After that my father
  told me to choose a college myself, anywhere I liked.</p>

  <p>I suppose to have been born in England means something, even the way it
  happened to me. It was in April 1918, when the Germans looked quite likely to
  win <i>that</i> war. My father had been shuttling back and forth across the
  Atlantic a good deal in those days; I have never been able to find out quite
  what he did, except that it was connected with the war and was apt to be so
  important that he traveled under another name with secret service people
  watching him. Anyhow, during one of these hush-hush visits he met my mother
  and during another he married her. He took her to New York, soon after which
  my grandmother fell ill; my mother then went back to England to stay only a
  few months, but she postponed returning as she postponed so many things, with
  the result that she was actually driving to Waterloo Station to catch the
  boat train for Southampton when she realized she was too late. Thus I became
  a Cockney, one might say, accidentally; and also, if it meant anything, I had
  done a good deal of traveling even before I was born.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I saw nothing of Brad for some time after the Byfleet
dinner; his tracks
  didn't cross mine at the College and I didn't particularly look for him or
  them. I did, however, meet a man named Mathews who had a laboratory next to
  his in the Physics Building and shared with him certain amenities. Mathews
  was amused when I asked if they were friends. He laughed and said: "What's
  that word you used? <i>Friends</i>? The fellow doesn't have time for such
  nonsense. Works his head off, goes nowhere, cares for nothing but crystals
  under a microscope or whatever it is. Sometimes I take him in a cup of tea.
  He says thanks very much, but I don't do it too often because it makes him
  feel obligated. Once, by way of returning the favor, he insisted on buying me
  a lunch at an A.B.C. And I don't like A.B.C.'s."</p>

  <p>"Does he talk to you?"</p>

  <p>"Only about work. I sometimes think he tries out his lectures on me. You
  might not think it, but he's a good lecturer. He also writes a few things for
  the scientific magazines...."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't he have any hobbies ... fun?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. Once a week, on Sundays, he finds some hill to climb.... Very
  invigorating."</p>

  <p>"You mean Hampstead and Highgate?"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't call <i>them</i> hills. Nothing less than Dorking to
  Guildford with a final run up the Hog's Back. I went with him once. Never
  again. Eighteen miles at four miles an hour. Not my idea of fun. But then,
  perhaps it isn't his either. Perhaps he does it for self-discipline or
  mortifying the flesh or something. He told me he never let rain stop
  him."</p>

  <p>I wasn't surprised at that because I like walking in rain myself. A few
  days later (and it <i>was</i> raining, by the way) I saw him coming out of
  the A.B.C. after lunch. He wore no hat or mackintosh and after standing a
  moment in the shop doorway to put up his coat collar he suddenly sprinted
  across the road towards the College entrance. Then he saw me and changed
  course, still at a sprint. He went out of his way to greet me. "Oh, Miss
  Waring.... I'd been wondering if I should meet you before ... before we meet
  again."</p>

  <p>That didn't seem to make too much sense, so I just smiled till he went on:
  "I'm coming to your house next Thursday. Your father invited me&mdash;he says
  there'll be nobody else there. That shows he <i>did</i> notice what a fool I
  was at the party."</p>

  <p>"It also shows he doesn't think any less of you for it."</p>

  <p>"I hope so ... but I also hope he doesn't think I really <i>mind</i> other
  people. What I mean is, I wouldn't like him to put himself out for me."</p>

  <p>There wasn't much I could say. It didn't seem at all likely that my father
  would put himself out for such an unimportant person; on the other hand, it
  was rather rarely that we were ever at home without a crowd. Afterwards I
  found that it was my mother who had arranged it.</p>

  <p>That Thursday evening began rather well, despite the fact that our
  landlord dropped in to dinner uninvited. Or perhaps partly because of it, for
  the talk got on the subject of painting, and that led to music and then my
  mother went to the piano and played Chopin. She was a fairly good amateur
  pianist and liked to play if there were no notable musicians present; she
  also sang, the <i>diseuse</i> style&mdash;you called her an English Yvette
  Guilbert if nobody else said it first. That evening I thought she sang rather
  better than usual and I told her so.</p>

  <p>"And what does Mr. Bradley think?" she asked from the piano stool.</p>

  <p>It was a silly question because it invited flattery and she might have
  known he wasn't the type to have it ready. He just looked uncomfortable and
  walked over to the piano. "I can sing too," he said.</p>

  <p>My mother jumped up laughing. "Why, of course&mdash;that's wonderful. Take
  over."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;I don't play the piano. Can you accompany for me?"</p>

  <p>"Depends what the song is."</p>

  <p>"I expect you know 'John Brown's Body' or 'Annie Laurie'...."</p>

  <p>I then felt a bit uncomfortable myself, chiefly because of the painter,
  who was ultrasophisticated about art and might consider songs like that very
  na&iuml;ve; also I thought he'd think Brad had bad manners in putting a stop to my
  mother's singing. I don't really mind if people have bad manners, but I don't
  like an American to have them in front of an Englishman, or vice versa for
  that matter. My mother, of course, carried it off gaily, starting at once
  into "Annie Laurie," and somewhat to everyone's surprise Brad turned out to
  have a rather good baritone. Halfway through my mother joined with him and
  made it a duet. They went on after that, singing other songs together, after
  which Brad asked her to sing some more on her own, so everything was all
  right. He said good-night about eleven, leaving the rest of us to conduct the
  post- mortem.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said my father. "We haven't had so much music since Cortot
  came here." Maybe he meant that to be ironic.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't so shy this time," said my mother.</p>

  <p>The painter asked who Brad was and what he did. My father answered: "A
  young scientist from one of our prairie states; he's working at University
  College where he got a Ph.D. last year."</p>

  <p>I hadn't known that before.</p>

  <p>"Nice voice," said the painter.</p>

  <p>My father smiled. "It's remarkable for one thing at least, it sings more
  readily than it talks."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, Waring, when it does talk it talks sense. While we
  were visiting your gent's room after dinner I asked him what he thought of
  the landscape in the hall&mdash;of course he didn't know it was mine. He said
  he didn't understand why a modern painter would ignore the rules of
  perspective without any of the excuses that Botticelli had, and I thoroughly
  agreed with him. I'm fed up with that pseudoprimitive stuff I went in for
  years ago."</p>

  <p>My father said: "I wouldn't have thought he knew anything about
  Botticelli."</p>

  <p>"He knows how to sing too," said my mother. "I mean <i>how</i> to
  sing&mdash; though I don't suppose he's ever been taught. His breathing's
  exceptionally good."</p>

  <p>"He takes long walks," I said. "Maybe that helps."</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the whole evening was a success, after all my fears that it
  wouldn't be.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">From then on I'd see him fairly often, but not to say more
than a few
  words to. I sometimes went to the A.B.C. shop where he had his regular lunch
  of a roll and butter and a glass of milk, we smiled across the crowded room,
  or he'd stop to say hello if my table was on his way to the cash desk. Twice,
  I think, I joined him because there was no place elsewhere, but he was just
  about to leave, so there wasn't much conversation. And another time the
  waitress said when she came to take my order: "Dr. Bradley isn't here yet.
  It's only seven past twelve and he never comes in till ten past. We tell the
  time by him." She must have thought I was looking for him.</p>

  <p>One lunchtime he threaded his way deliberately amongst the tables towards
  mine. "I've been wanting to ask you something," he began, sitting down. "I've
  been thinking I ought to return your parents' hospitality. Of course I don't
  have a house where I could very well ask them to dinner...."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they know that&mdash;they wouldn't expect it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But perhaps a hotel&mdash;I wondered if you could tell me any particular
  place they like."</p>

  <p>My father liked Claridge's and my mother the Berkeley, either of which
  would have cost him at least a week's pay. So I said: "They really don't care
  much for dining at hotels at all.... Why don't you ask them to tea? I know
  they'd love that."</p>

  <p>"Tea?... That's an idea. Just afternoon tea&mdash;like the English?"</p>

  <p>"My mother <i>is</i> English."</p>

  <p>"Tea and crumpets, then."</p>

  <p>"Not crumpets in the middle of June. Just tea."</p>

  <p>"And what hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Does it have to be any hotel? Why don't you make tea in your lab? Mathews
  does."</p>

  <p>"Mathews? You know him? We might invite him too." I didn't know what he
  meant by "we" till he added: "Would you help?"</p>

  <p>"With the tea? Why yes, of course."</p>

  <p>It was fun making preparations. I had never been inside his laboratory
  before, or even seen what "Dr. Mark Bradley" looked like on his letter box.
  It was an ugly room on the top story of the Physics Building, with less
  scientific equipment in it than I had expected and a rather pervasive smell
  that I didn't comment on because there was nothing to be said in its favor
  and doubtless nothing that could be done about it. I tidied the place up a
  bit, dusted the chairs, and soon had the kettle boiling on a tripod over a
  Bunsen burner. Mathews came, talked, drank tea, and had to leave for a
  lecture. My parents had promised to be there by four, and I was a little
  peeved by their lateness, not because it really mattered but because I could
  see it was making Brad nervous. He kept pacing up and down and looking out of
  the window. Suddenly he cried "They're here!" and rushed out and down the
  stairs. But when he came back there was only my mother with him. She was full
  of apologies; she had been shopping and hadn't noticed the time; and also my
  father couldn't come owing to a meeting in the City that had lasted longer
  than usual. "Of course you shouldn't have waited for me." Then she looked
  appraisingly round the room, sniffing just as I had. "What a jolly little
  place! How secluded you must be here&mdash;almost on the roof! And all those
  wonderful-looking instruments&mdash;you simply <i>must</i> tell me about
  them."</p>

  <p>There were only a couple of microscopes, a chemical balance, and a Liebig
  condenser, but he went round with her, exhibiting and explaining, answering
  in patient detail even the most trivial of her questions, and all without the
  slightest trace of nervousness or reticence. It looked to me like a miracle,
  till I remembered that Mathews had said he was a good lecturer.</p>

  <p>Then we had tea, and I knew that it <i>was</i> a miracle, because all at
  once he was actually <i>chatting</i>. She asked him most of the questions I
  had wanted to ask him, and he answered them all. About his early life in
  North Dakota, the farm near the Canadian border, droughts, blizzards, hard
  times, bankruptcy, the death of both his parents before he was out of grade
  school, and his own career since. She asked him such personal
  things&mdash;had he left a girl in America, did he have enough money? He said
  there was no girl and he had enough money to live on.</p>

  <p>"But not enough to marry on?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to marry."</p>

  <p>"You might&mdash;someday."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"How can you be certain?"</p>

  <p>"Because of my work. It takes up so much of my time that it wouldn't be
  fair to any woman to marry her."</p>

  <p>"She mightn't let it take up so much of your time."</p>

  <p>"Then it wouldn't be fair to my work."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather ... inhuman?"</p>

  <p>"Not when you feel about your work as I do."</p>

  <p>"You mean as a sort of priesthood&mdash;with a vow of celibacy
  attached?"</p>

  <p>He thought a moment. "I don't know. I hadn't figured it out quite like
  that."</p>

  <p>But the oddest thing was yet to come. About six o'clock a boy put his head
  in at the doorway, grinned cheerfully, and asked if he could go home. "I've
  fed the cats and mice and fixed all the cages, sir."</p>

  <p>Brad said: "You'd better let me take a look first." He excused himself to
  us and was gone a few minutes; when he came back my mother was all ready for
  him. "What's this about cats and mice and cages? Is that what the smell
  is?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "I hope it doesn't bother you. I'm so used to it myself I
  hardly notice it."</p>

  <p>"But what do you have them for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't have them at all&mdash;they belong to the man next door. I keep
  an eye on them when he's out. He uses them for his experimental work."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" She flushed a little. "But of course, that's very
  interesting. I'd like to see your menagerie. Could I?"</p>

  <p>I hoped he would have more sense and I tried to signal danger to both of
  them, but without effect. I didn't know him well enough, anyway, to convey
  signals, and somehow at that moment I didn't even feel I knew my mother well
  enough. She had a spellbound look, as if she were eager for disaster. Brad
  just said: "Sure, if you like, but I warn you, the smell's worse when you get
  close."</p>

  <p>We walked down a stone corridor and into another room. It was full of
  cages, numbered and tagged and placed methodically on platforms round the
  walls. The cats had had their milk and were sleepily washing themselves; they
  purred in anticipation and rubbed their heads against the wire when he went
  near them. My mother looked hypnotizes as she followed him from cage to cage.
  She asked him how the cats were obtained. "I suppose the University buys them
  from somebody," he answered. "Most of them are strays&mdash;they're often
  half- starved when they first come here. We feed them well, of
  course&mdash;they have to be healthy before they're any use."</p>

  <p>Without reply see suddenly opened the door of one of the cages. A black
  and white cat squirmed eagerly into her arms and tried to reach up to her
  chin. See fondled it for a moment, then put it back in the cage. "What a pity
  I have to," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"You like cats?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I adore them. Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Dogs too."</p>

  <p>It wasn't a very intelligent end to the conversation but I could see it
  <i>was</i> the end. My mother was already putting on that glassy look she has
  when see is saying charming things and thinking of something else at the same
  time. I've often seen it at the tail end of a party. "I think perhaps I ought
  to be going.... So nice of you to ask me here and tell me everything. We must
  have you to the house again soon."</p>

  <p>He saw us down to the street, where Henry was waiting. In the car my
  mother was silent for a while, then she said: "It was my fault. I shouldn't
  have poked my nose in."</p>

  <p>When I didn't answer she added: "I suppose they have to do it."</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> doesn't. They weren't his."</p>

  <p>She was silent again for some time, then asked suddenly: "Do you think you
  understand him?"</p>

  <p>"Not after the way he talked to you today."</p>

  <p>"Why, what was wrong about that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, only I'd always thought he was reserved and shy."</p>

  <p>"He is."</p>

  <p>"Not with you. He told you more in five minutes than he'd tell me in five
  years."</p>

  <p>"Wait till you've known him five years. You'll be a better age."</p>

  <p>"So you think that's why he doesn't talk to me as he does to you? Because
  I'm too young?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Darling, don't be annoyed. And I might be wrong too. I've never
  met scientists before. They must be queer people. The way they can <i>do</i>
  such things ... and yet have ideals. The distant goal&mdash;he's got his eyes
  fixed on it and he can't see anything nearer.... And all his hard life and
  early struggles haven't taught him anything. He doesn't realize that even in
  the scientific world you've got to get about and make friends if you want to
  be a success. He lives like a hermit&mdash;anyone can see that. It would do
  him good to fall in love."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "Mathews says he's scared of women altogether."</p>

  <p>"Mathews?"</p>

  <p>"The man next door to him."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes ... the one who ... yes, I remember...."</p>

  <p>"All the same, though, he wasn't scared of <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>She cuddled my arm and answered: "No, darling, it was I who was scared.
  He's a <i>peculiar</i> man."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ever since schooldays I have kept a diary of sorts, mostly
the jotting
  down of engagements, never anything literary or confessional. Brad makes his
  appearance the first day I saw him; there's the record: "Dinner Chelsea
  Professor Byfleet. Gave a lift home to American boy researching at Coll.
  Shy." The entry for the day on which my mother came to tea is similarly
  brief. Just: "Tea in Brad's lab. Mother. Cat." And about a week later comes
  this: "End of College Term. Cat."</p>

  <p>What happened was that I got home from an afternoon walk to find my mother
  and Brad in the drawing room. They were talking together and my mother was
  nursing a black and white cat which immediately she thrust into my arms.
  "Look, Jane! It's the same one! Brad just brought it&mdash;he's given it to
  me!"</p>

  <p>"It's lovely," I said, and I noticed she had called him Brad. So I said:
  "Hello, Brad."</p>

  <p>"Hello," he answered.</p>

  <p>She went on breathlessly: "And it wasn't what we thought at all.... Tell
  her, Brad, unless...." She began to smile. "Unless you think she's too young
  to know."</p>

  <p>My mother and I adored each other, but ever since I was about fourteen she
  had talked <i>to</i> me as if I were her own age, but <i>of</i> me as if I
  were still about twelve; and when this happened before my face I often got
  confused and said just what a twelve-year-old would say.</p>

  <p>I did then. I said: "I'm not too young to know anything." Brad took it
  seriously. "I should say not. There's nothing indecent about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be silly&mdash;I was only joking," my mother interrupted. "Tell
  her."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing much. Apparently you both thought those animals in the room
  next to my lab were kept for vivisection. Anything but. All they have to do
  is to reproduce, reproduce, and keep on reproducing. Probably quite pleasant
  for them. Mathews is doing some new research in Genetics&mdash;he breeds a
  succession of generations to find out how certain characteristics crop
  up."</p>

  <p>Now that I had the explanation the fact that even jokingly I had been
  considered too young to know it made me almost feel I was. I said, in a
  rather asinine way: "Wouldn't Mathews mind you taking away his cat?"</p>

  <p>"He hadn't begun any records of this animal, so any other would do just as
  well. He said so. Technically, of course, I've stolen the property of the
  University of London. How about calling the police?"</p>

  <p>We all laughed and I handed the cat back to my mother.</p>

  <p>"Mind you," he went on, "don't think I'm a sentimentalist. There's a lot
  of nonsense talked about cruel scientists&mdash;I've never met any myself.
  Certainly at the College the men who have to do vivisections
  occasionally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My mother broke in: "You mean that it <i>does</i> go on there? I thought
  you said&mdash;just for breeding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must have misunderstood me&mdash;all I said was that the animals
  <i>you</i>saw, the ones Mathews keeps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, all right, let's not talk about it any more."</p>

  <p>"But you do believe me when I say that scientists aren't cruel?"</p>

  <p>Brad was like that, as I found so many times afterwards; he could never
  let well enough alone.</p>

  <p>My mother said: "Many people are cruel. Wouldn't you expect <i>some</i> of
  them to be scientists?"</p>

  <p>"Statistically, yes...."</p>

  <p>"Then I've won my argument. Have some tea."</p>

  <p>I said good-by to him long before he went because I had to go upstairs and
  pack; I was leaving for a holiday in Ireland the next morning. I think he
  stayed till my father came home just before dinner.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">My mother wrote while I was away, just her usual gossipy
letters; one of
  them mentioned Brad and said he had been up to the house for dinner. "We had
  more music and sat up talking till late. He's really beginning to be quite
  human...."</p>

  <p>I was in Ireland over a month and returned to London for the beginning of
  the autumn term. It was September, and in a few weeks, if they followed their
  usual plan, my parents would return to America. I wondered what it would feel
  like to be on my own in London; I was halfway thrilled at the prospect.</p>

  <p>I didn't see Brad for a few days; then suddenly he met me as I was leaving
  a lecture. We shook hands and he asked about Ireland. "Did you climb any
  mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly mountains. We hiked about, though. There were plenty of
  hills."</p>

  <p>"Did you visit Donegal?"</p>

  <p>"No. Should I?"</p>

  <p>"Someone told me that in the mountains there you get quartzite with a
  capping of sandstone&mdash;obviously the result of denudation...." He went
  on, when I didn't answer: "Geology's one of the things I wish I knew more
  about. Do you enjoy walking?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, very much."</p>

  <p>"Would you care to take a walk with me next Sunday?"</p>

  <p>I said I would and he looked me up and down as if for the first time he
  were reckoning me physically. "Good legs and good boots are all you
  need."</p>

  <p>"Shoes," I corrected. "And I don't know <i>anything</i> about geology, but
  I'd like to."</p>

  <p>I thought he might be relieved to feel there was always a topic in
  reserve.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We went to Cambridge by an early train because he had to
call at the
  Cavendish Laboratory there to leave some papers. It was the first time I had
  been to the university town and I wouldn't have minded sight-seeing, but
  apparently this was not part of his program; we ignored the colleges and
  began a brisk walk along the riverbank. After what Mathews had said, I was
  quite prepared to cover the miles without comment or complaint, but as a
  great concession, doubtless, we picked up a bus at some outlying village and
  the bus happened to be going to Ely. The way I'm telling this sounds as if I
  were having fun at his expense all the time; and so, in a quiet way, I was,
  because people who are too serious always make me feel ribald inside. Not
  that he was as serious as I had expected. We didn't discuss geology
  once&mdash;perhaps because there isn't much geology between Cambridge and
  Ely. There were just large expanses of mud everywhere, and especially by the
  river, for heavy rain had fallen and the sky was full of clouds threatening
  more. Ely was like a steel engraving, but inside the Cathedral the octagon
  window had the look of stored- up sunshine from a summer day. I said it would
  be strange if some of the medieval stained-glass experts had actually
  discovered how to do this, and he assured me gravely that they couldn't have,
  it was scientifically impossible. I then gave him a short lecture on English
  Perpendicular, to which he listened as if he thought me clever though what I
  was saying relatively unimportant. "But of course you're only interested in
  scientific things," I ended up.</p>

  <p>"No, that's not true. Your mother played some Mozart to me the other
  evening&mdash;it was the first time I really liked classical music."</p>

  <p>"She loves Mozart."</p>

  <p>"Of course when she was younger she had time and opportunity to cultivate
  a sense of beauty&mdash;that's hard for the average American."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. I think it's Americans who do cultivate things, as a
  rule."</p>

  <p>"Then she just <i>has</i> them&mdash;was born with them, perhaps.
  Generations of aristocratic background."</p>

  <p>"My mother's people wouldn't like you to call them aristocrats. They're a
  fairly well-known Yorkshire family&mdash;commoners, but we can trace
  ourselves back for a few centuries without much trouble."</p>

  <p>"She happened to mention a sister&mdash;Lady Somebody, I forget the
  name."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing. Tides don't mean aristocracy. All my aunt did was to
  marry a man who got knighted&mdash;that can happen to anyone."</p>

  <p>"You sound rather cynical about it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not. But it's amusing, sometimes, the way Americans make mistakes. My
  aunt and uncle were once visiting us in Florida and the local paper called
  them English blue bloods. They're no more blue-blooded than you are."</p>

  <p>"Speaking scientifically?"</p>

  <p>"No, speaking snobbishly. If you want the snob angle, at least get it
  right. Of course I don't mean you, I mean the Florida paper. Personally I
  don't think much of titles."</p>

  <p>"Because you come of a family that's proud of its age rather than
  rank?"</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right. It's probably an inverted snobbery. We certainly
  think we're superior to a lot of these businessmen baronets."</p>

  <p>"You say 'we.' Does that mean you feel yourself more English than
  American?"</p>

  <p>"When I'm talking to you I do. When I'm talking to an Englishman I feel I
  want to chew gum. It's the perverse streak in me."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean you feel American when you're with your mother?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes.... Though she's not so terribly English. I've met Russians and
  Irish that are more like her. She's more true to herself than to any
  nationality. Not that I mean she doesn't act, sometimes. But when she does,
  she doesn't really mind if you see through it. And you can act back. She
  doesn't mind that either."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm not much good at acting."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't meaning you personally."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was just talking generally. I'm sorry if you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How did we get onto this argument, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I forget."</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment, then said: "We were discussing beauty&mdash;the
  sense of beauty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Were we?"</p>

  <p>"Mozart, it started with...."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, you said you were beginning to like classical music."</p>

  <p>"I think I <i>could</i> like it, if I heard more. It's strange
  how&mdash;if you're in a certain mood&mdash;the awareness of beauty comes
  over you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It comes over me in <i>any</i> mood. I mean, it can <i>put</i> me in the
  mood. When we were in the Cathedral just now, for instance...."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but it didn't get me as much as Mozart."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we should have asked the organist to play some Mozart."</p>

  <p>"I'll ask your mother when I'm next up at the house."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do.... You come up quite often now, don't you? While I've been
  away.... I'm so glad."</p>

  <p>We returned to Cambridge by bus and he called at the Cavendish again to
  pick up something&mdash;"results," he said, that he had left there in the
  morning for a check. When he glanced over them later in the train I tried to
  tell from his face whether everything had been satisfactory, but he looked
  neither pleased nor displeased&mdash;only preoccupied. Presently, as he put
  the papers away, he said: "Well, that's that."</p>

  <p>"What is?"</p>

  <p>"A month's work and it turns out to be wrong."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to be sorry about. It's not an emotional matter."</p>

  <p>"But a whole month! Couldn't you have found out you were wrong
  sooner?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not&mdash;though the Cavendish does have better facilities. Might
  save time in the future if I had access to them more often."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you work there?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You don't know how lucky I am to be able to work anywhere. You
  should have known me the last time I went inside a cathedral."</p>

  <p>"Where was that?"</p>

  <p>"St. Patrick's, New York."</p>

  <p>"Are you a Catholic?"</p>

  <p>"No. I used to go in for warmth and rest when I was looking for a job.
  That was in 1931."</p>

  <p>"You've come a long way in five years."</p>

  <p>"It's not how far you come that counts&mdash;it's the direction you take
  and whether you ever find the right track."</p>

  <p>"Do you think you've found it?"</p>

  <p>"I think I know where to look for it. And a few wrong answers won't put me
  off."</p>

  <p>There was a sort of grittiness in his voice that made me think he was
  fighting down disappointment over his wasted month. He added almost
  ferociously: "The trouble is, I don't <i>know</i> enough. I'm trying to build
  too high without scaffolding...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After that day at Cambridge I thought I was bound to have
crossed some
  sort of barrier, and that henceforth I could count on seeing him fairly
  regularly, either at the College or at the house; but in fact a rather long
  interval elapsed, so that I stopped Mathews once and asked how Brad was. He
  said he was wearing himself out as usual, or rather more than
  usual&mdash;indeed, he'd given up one of his teaching classes in order to
  devote more time to his own work.</p>

  <p>"Can he afford that?"</p>

  <p>"Evidently. Or else he's making himself afford it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what work it is?"</p>

  <p>"Vaguely. Some sort of mathematics. But you can't know much about other
  people's work nowadays, not when they get past the elementary stage. Even
  genetics has its mysteries. Why don't you come and see my mice? I don't have
  cats any more&mdash;they're not quick enough on the job. And besides, they're
  apt to attract visitors." He always joked about my mother's acquisition.</p>

  <p>I went up with him. "I wouldn't disturb him while he's busy," he said, as
  we passed Brad's door. I hadn't had any such intention, but the warning made
  me ask what special reason there was for all the high pressure.</p>

  <p>He said he thought something had "happened" at Cambridge. "He goes to the
  Cavendish there fairly often. He told me after one trip that a physicist was
  no damned good unless he was also a mathematician, so that's what he's doing
  now, I suppose&mdash;in what he calls his spare time.... Come and see these
  creatures again when you feel like it. Perhaps he won't be so busy."</p>

  <p>He was, and I didn't bother him. But one afternoon, inside the College
  near the Physics Building, I met my mother walking along as if she had far
  more right to look surprised than I had. She asked if I were going up to see
  Brad. I replied: "Certainly not. Have <i>you</i> just been to see him?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, why 'certainly not'?"</p>

  <p>"Because he hates to be interrupted when he's at work. It's a thing I'd
  never dream of doing.... But I suppose you <i>have</i> seen him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but not in the way you think. I've been to one of his lectures."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see any reason against it. He has a beginners'
  class&mdash;anybody can join who enrolls. I've enrolled. It's interesting.
  And he explains things so wonderfully. One ought to have something serious in
  life, oughtn't one?"</p>

  <p>"What does Brad say about it?"</p>

  <p>"Brad?... yes ... it suits him, doesn't it?... Or perhaps it's just that I
  never did like Mark and I couldn't go on calling him Mr. Bradley&mdash;Dr.
  Bradley, I mean.... Anyhow, I think the less formal we all are the better.
  That's what the trouble is with him&mdash;he's <i>too</i> formal&mdash;he
  doesn't seem to believe in any pleasure, amusement, relaxation.... But I have
  an idea I'm beginning to convert him&mdash;gradually."</p>

  <p>She looked so adorable as she said it that I laughed. "And he's managing
  to convert you a little at the same time, eh?"</p>

  <p>No, she answered, he was not converting her&mdash;not really. He was only
  showing her something she had already been aware of in life, or had guessed
  existed. Physics was a symbol rather than the thing itself. "I've often
  thought I have a rather empty existence&mdash;just dinner parties and social
  engagements and treading the same old beaten path&mdash;London, New York,
  Florida. I've never been completely satisfied with it. Even when I was a girl
  I wanted to be a nurse." (This was news to me, and it may have been true, but
  my mother was always capable of reinforcing an argument with some happy
  improvisation.) "Darling, you at least ought to understand, because you've
  chosen to do something worth while instead of wasting your time as so many
  girls in your position would. Surely it's the happy medium we must all strive
  for. For instance, he <i>ought</i> to waste a little bit of his time, and
  I've quite an ambition to make him do it&mdash;I'd <i>love</i> to make him
  break a rule&mdash;just one little rule...."</p>

  <p>"Did he break any at the lecture when he saw you?"</p>

  <p>"Not him. He's so different when he's lecturing. Not a bit
  nervous&mdash;and yet still shy."</p>

  <p>"Did he know you were going to be there?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I <i>enrolled</i>&mdash;didn't I say that? I asked him if he
  thought it would all be above my head and he said no, it was as elementary as
  he could make it&mdash;he's not exactly the flatterer, is he?... But never a
  smile or a look during the lecture&mdash;I was just one of his students. And
  when he finished he picked up his papers and dashed away as if he was afraid
  of someone chasing him."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was."</p>

  <p>"Now darling, are you trying to make fun of me?"</p>

  <p>I wondered if I were; it wouldn't have been surprising, for my mother and
  I got a good deal of amusement out of each other. But I had a curious feeling
  that we were both more serious than we sounded, and that the badinage was a
  familiar dress to cover something rather new in our relationship.</p>

  <p>She said, as if it finally clinched the matter: "Well, he's coming to
  dinner on October tenth. I <i>did</i> chase him to ask him that. He said he
  couldn't make it earlier because he's working for some examination that
  finishes on the ninth."</p>

  <p>"But will you still be here? I thought the end of September was when you
  and Father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We're staying a few extra weeks this year. We thought it would be nice
  not to leave you too soon."</p>

  <p>I said I was glad, which was true enough, though of course I knew I'd be
  perfectly all right on my own.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It wasn't a party on the tenth, but that rare "just
ourselves," with not
  even a chance visitor after dinner except Julian Spee. Julian was a rising
  English lawyer; still in his middle forties, he had already taken silk and
  found a seat in Parliament; there seemed nothing to stop him from whatever he
  aimed at, which was probably high. He was handsome in a saturnine way, a
  brilliant talker, unmarried, and an accomplished flirt. He lived in a house
  not far from ours, facing the Heath, and had formed a habit of dropping by
  whenever he felt like it, whether we had a party or not. He was sure of his
  welcome and one knew he was sure. I think he liked my mother more than most
  women, and she in turn was flattered by his attentions and always willing to
  give advice about his love affairs. A pleasantly romantic relationship can
  develop in this way, and it had done, over a period of years. I wasn't at
  ease with Julian myself, because I never felt he was quite real, but on the
  few occasions when he hadn't treated me as a precocious child I had been
  aware of his attractiveness. My father, who collected him as he collected all
  celebrities, once said that in any other country but England you would have
  taken him for a homosexual, to which my mother replied mischievously: "And in
  any other country he would have been." As often it wasn't very clear what she
  meant.</p>

  <p>My father had got back from Germany that day, tired from the trip and
  gloomy about affairs over there. He didn't any longer attend to ordinary
  business matters, but if something cropped up of a kind in which his personal
  acquaintance with politicians and diplomats might help, the job was usually
  passed on to him. I think the Nazis were interfering with some of his
  "interests"; the State Department hadn't been able to do much, and because he
  had once met Hitler during the twenties he'd been called in like a rainmaker
  after a prolonged drought. But big shots were always apt to disappoint him
  after a while&mdash;Lenin had, and Lloyd George, and Mussolini, and Ramsay
  MacDonald, and now it was Hitler's turn. Roosevelt hadn't yet, but one felt
  sure he would. My father was too rich to care for money for its own sake
  (despite the Marazon disclosures that did him so much harm); he knew, as
  moderately rich men didn't, how little you could bribe those whose real
  currency was power, and this in turn made him flatter poor men who became
  powerful. But of course, because they were powerful, sooner or later they let
  him know that he had only money. I think now (though I knew nothing much
  about it then) he must have been having this kind of experience in Germany,
  and it hadn't been pleasant.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Brad's mood that night was at the other extreme. With his
  examination over even he couldn't help relaxing, the more so under the
  influence of good food and my mother's gaiety. Then, somehow or other, when
  we were in the drawing room afterwards and Julian had joined us, the
  conversation grew personal and the atmosphere changed. Julian had met Brad
  before, and they had seemed to like each other well enough, in spite or
  perhaps because of their obvious oppositeness. But now I sensed a hostility
  between them which my father was quietly fanning; it was as if he were
  holding his own unhappy thoughts at bay by encouraging both my mother and
  Julian to put Brad on the spot. Soon they were in the thick of a discussion
  of Brad's ambitions, what he wanted to do in life, his ideal of science as
  something to be lived for, and so on. All ideals sound na&iuml;ve when brought out
  under cross-examination, but my mother had a special knack of creating
  na&iuml;vete in others&mdash;something in the way she used wits rather than brains
  for an argument, certainly not knowledge, which she didn't have much of about
  most things. But she was always fluent, and couldn't endure to wait while
  others hesitated or pondered, so she would tell them what she thought they
  were going to reply, and it was often so deceptively simple that the other
  person would agree in a bemused way and presently find himself defending some
  vast proposition more suitable for a school debating society than anything
  between adults. I think this must have happened to Brad that night, for he
  got to telling us eventually that scientists were actuated by a desire to
  "save" humanity, and that science, in due course, would do this in spite of
  other people whose chief concern was worldly success. (Which was probably a
  dig at Julian.)</p>

  <p>"Meaning," said Julian, "that scientists don't go for that sort of
  thing?"</p>

  <p>Brad answered that no true scientist could, or if he did, it proved he
  wasn't a true scientist. As neat as that!</p>

  <p>"But my dear boy&mdash;" (Julian always called people "dear," which
  sounded more affected than affectionate till you got used to it, and then you
  realized it was neither, but just a habit)&mdash;"my dear boy, if you ignore
  all worldly success, how do you suppose you're going to get a chance to prove
  <i>anything</i>? You can't sit in a corner all on your own and just <i>be</i>
  a scientist&mdash;it's not like writing an epic poem or contemplating your
  navel&mdash;you need money for food, equipment that you couldn't afford, a
  room to work in that your house doesn't have, and a job to make it worth
  somebody's while to pay you a regular salary!"</p>

  <p>"Well, a job's all right. There's nothing worldly in that."</p>

  <p>"But unless it's a good job you'll wear yourself out marking papers and
  teaching teen-agers to blow glass! I know, because I remember my own
  schooldays."</p>

  <p>"There <i>are</i> good jobs."</p>

  <p>"And how do you suppose they are got? College heads aren't supermen, they
  don't know much about science themselves, and because they can only judge a
  reputation by the look of it, they're human enough to favor a man who knows
  how to draw attention to himself. So if he's smart, that's exactly what he
  does. Politics is one way&mdash;though dangerous. Social success is safer.
  And doing stuff on the side that attracts publicity&mdash;you Americans know
  the kind of thing&mdash; pseudoscientific articles in your Sunday supplements
  that aren't <i>too</i> phony, just phony enough." (Julian liked to use
  American slang, which he said was enriching the English language at a period
  when otherwise a natural impoverishment would have set in. We had another big
  argument about that once.)</p>

  <p>"So you don't think real distinction counts, Mr. Spee?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that. Of course it counts&mdash;but it counts a good deal
  more if you add salesmanship and what your Hollywood people call
  glamour."</p>

  <p>"<i>Glamour</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly.... An interesting new theory, developed by Professor So-and-
  So in Vienna ... it's like your sparkling new comedy, straight from its
  phenomenal success on Broadway ... even if it only ran three nights....
  Vienna is the Broadway of the scientific show business.... I'd strongly
  recommend a year or two there for you."</p>

  <p>Brad had the same trouble that I had in deciding whether Julian was
  serious or not, and I could see him wondering about it now.</p>

  <p>My father said quietly: "Might not be a bad idea at that."</p>

  <p>Brad was still puzzling over Julian's epigram. "Show business, eh?" he
  echoed, in a rather shocked tone. "I hope it isn't quite so bad."</p>

  <p>"It's not bad at all, my dear boy, it's human. We live in an age of
  headlines, not of hermits."</p>

  <p>"Someday," said my mother, in her random way, "the hermits may make the
  headlines."</p>

  <p>"Vienna's a good place," said my father. "A very good place indeed."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that everyone was talking at cross-purposes. "I can't
  believe that the true scientist cares much about headlines," Brad said.</p>

  <p>"No?" Julian gave his rather high-pitched feminine laugh. "I could mention
  the names of at least a dozen who care about them passionately. And they're
  big men, not charlatans, don't make any mistake. They'll give you some
  competition if you go after the plums."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want the plums. I'm not a bit ambitious for things like that-
  -I wouldn't enjoy the kind of thing some people call success. All I ask is
  the chance to work usefully at something that seems to me worth while." He
  added, as if he had listened to his own words: "And if that sounds priggish I
  can't help it&mdash;it's the only way I can express what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;not priggish at all," Julian assured him. "Just an honest
  mistake you're making about yourself. Do you mean to tell me you really
  <i>wouldn't</i> like to head a research department of your own somewhere, to
  have no more drudgery, to get yourself recognized as an equal by those whose
  names in the scientific world you know and respect?... Of course you
  would.... And as for scientists being worth-whilers and world-savers, let me
  prick that bubble for you too. I've known a good many of them, and in my
  experience, though some may fool themselves about it, they have one simple
  and over-riding motive above all others.... <i>Curiosity</i>."</p>

  <p>"Brad's motive isn't that," my mother interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Then by Christ, if you'll pardon the expression, it had better be, unless
  he's a mere moralist hiding behind a rampart of test tubes!" He turned to
  Brad with his easy confident smile. "Perhaps you are&mdash;perhaps you'd
  really be more at home in a pulpit than a laboratory."</p>

  <p>"No, no, Julian," my mother interrupted again. "That's absurd&mdash;he's
  not a moralist, and why should he hide anywhere? He's a real
  scientist&mdash;he even defends vivisection!"</p>

  <p>It was part of my mother's charm that her mind flew off at tangents
  usually capable of changing a subject. This time, however, both Brad and
  Julian ignored her and the argument went on. "Of course, my dear boy, I'm
  neither defending nor attacking&mdash;I'm just diagnosing what I've always
  felt to be the real germ of the scientific spirit. You probably know much
  more about it yourself, but my own opinion is, it's Pandora's box that lures,
  not the Holy Grail. And I haven't yet met a scientist who wouldn't take a
  chance of busting up the whole works rather than not find out something.
  Maybe civilizations have been destroyed like that before. History covers too
  small a fragment of life on earth for anyone to say it's unthinkable. After
  all, we know the Greeks excelled us in several of the arts and perhaps in one
  of the sciences, that of human government&mdash;why not some earlier
  civilization in engineering or medicine? Anyhow, it's a beguiling
  thought&mdash;that all the great discoveries have been made and remade over
  and over again throughout the ages. What do you say, Jane? You're the
  historian."</p>

  <p>I said it all sounded very pessimistic and somewhat Spenglerian.</p>

  <p>"Personally I find it more agreeable than what the last century called
  progress."</p>

  <p>"It's worse than pessimism," Brad said. "It's a sort of nihilism."</p>

  <p>"Coo ... listen to 'im! Sech lengwidge!" Julian mimicked banteringly.</p>

  <p>My father, who had taken little part in the argument and had seemed to be
  listening in a detached way, now intervened almost irritably. "Nihilism ...
  <i>nihilism</i> ... just a word. At various times in my life I've been called
  an economic royalist, a communist, a fascist, and a merchant of death ... so
  don't let nihilist floor you, Julian."</p>

  <p>"I won't," Julian retorted, though he looked as if my father's sudden
  support had rather startled him.</p>

  <p>Brad was hanging on to the argument. "But at least, Mr. Spee, the peak of
  each civilization could be higher than the one before?"</p>

  <p>"Why <i>should</i> it? We don't know. Perhaps there've been vast cycles of
  civilizations&mdash;some upward in trend, others downward&mdash;and these
  cycles, in turn, may have belonged to even vaster movements. All pure
  speculation, of course. You can argue about it endlessly, just as&mdash;" and
  he turned deferentially to my father&mdash;"just as your Dow-Jones theorists
  do when stocks drop and they try to figure out whether it's a real bear
  market or just a dip in a boom. Wait and see's the only solution, but if the
  waiting means a few million years, what can you do? Even Spengler won't go
  that far."</p>

  <p>Julian laughed, but as if he had become already uneasy about the argument.
  He was extremely sensitive to timing and atmosphere, and soon afterwards he
  made rather abrupt excuses and left us. Brad stayed, and my father rallied
  himself into an appearance of affability. But I was still at odds with his
  mood; I couldn't quite understand it, and his totally unnecessary mention of
  having once been called a merchant of death was especially strange. It was
  true, he had been called that, but it wasn't true that he had been
  unconcerned about it; on the contrary he had been much hurt at the time and
  would have prosecuted somebody for libel if his lawyers had let him.</p>

  <p>I also noticed that he was refilling his glass rather oftener than usual.
  "Well, Brad," he said, switching over to his side. "We certainly had him on a
  soapbox, didn't we? I hope you weren't too impressed."</p>

  <p>Brad laughed. "So long as I don't have to agree, that's the main thing.
  I'd like to think over what he said in terms of the Second Law of
  Thermodynamics. Might be interesting."</p>

  <p>"What beats me," my father said, "is the way that fellow knows other
  people's business.... Yours ... and mine ... the Dow-Jones theory ... how
  does he get that way?"</p>

  <p>"Probably most of what he knows is on the surface," Brad answered,
  entirely without malice.</p>

  <p>It was late and he looked at his watch. I think we were all a little
  tired. Just before he left my father called me to the library. "Henry can
  drive him back," he said. "Why don't you go with him for the ride?"</p>

  <p>I was surprised at the suggestion and wondered if he thought there was
  anything emotional between Brad and me&mdash;that would have been too
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"He'd probably rather take the tube," I said.</p>

  <p>"No, let Henry bring the car round."</p>

  <p>"He'd hate to think he'd been keeping Henry up. He's fussy about those
  things."</p>

  <p>"Then get a taxi and you can come back in it."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't have taxis&mdash;he can't afford them and he wouldn't like me
  to pay."</p>

  <p>My father's irritation showed through again. "Well, for once he can&mdash;
  because I want you to tell him something. Tell him I wasn't joking, even if
  Julian was, about the idea of him going abroad. I've been thinking for some
  time it might not be a bad thing. Tell him that."</p>

  <p>"Why don't <i>you</i> tell him?"</p>

  <p>"I did, but I don't think he heard me. I'm sorry Julian talked of it so
  flippantly&mdash;it's really what Brad ought to do. He's probably got all he
  can out of this London job by now.... So tell him, will you? There's a bunch
  of physicists in Vienna, if he could get fixed up with the right connections.
  I might be able to help him in that."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> might?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have&mdash;er&mdash;contacts there."</p>

  <p>"In Vienna?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But what about the Cavendish at Cambridge? Isn't that as good?"</p>

  <p>"Cambridge isn't the only place where they're doing interesting things in
  his line. The Continent would give him a different angle...."</p>

  <p>"You mean the glamour?"</p>

  <p>"No, no ... or anyhow, that's not the word for it. I wish Julian hadn't
  butted in with his witticisms.... Well, you talk things over with Brad. Ask
  him how he'd like to spend some time working with Hugo Framm."</p>

  <p>"<i>Hugo Framm</i>?"</p>

  <p>"He'll know who Framm is. Ask him. Ask him."</p>

  <p>The telephone then rang; I took it, as I often did; it was New York. Those
  business calls were generally very dull as well as private, so I handed him
  the receiver and edged away towards the hall doorway across the room.</p>

  <p>And then I saw Brad. His back was towards me, and in front of him, almost
  hidden, was my mother. The lights in the hall were subdued, and all I could
  see of her distinctly was the knuckle of her right hand as she held his
  sleeve. She had been talking to him earnestly and I caught what was evidently
  a final remark: "... and you mustn't take any notice, Brad.... I'd
  <i>hate</i> you to be influenced at all...." Only that, whispered very
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>He said nothing in reply, then suddenly, glancing round his shoulder with
  a little side movement of her head, she saw me, I think, though she pretended
  not to. I stepped back into the room. Presently my father finished his
  call.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I was saying, Jane, see how he feels about it."</p>

  <p>I answered: "Yes, but not tonight. I'll talk to him at the College
  tomorrow. I <i>know</i> he'd rather go home by tube."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I could have met him at lunch the next day and been sure of
not
  interrupting his work, but I went straight to the lab about eleven-thirty,
  committing the unforgivable sin, if it were one, with a certain gusto. After
  all, he couldn't already be working for another examination&mdash;or could
  he? Anyhow, I caught him (so far as I could judge) doing that rare thing,
  nothing. But he looked preoccupied and not really surprised enough; he asked
  me to sit down, but I said it wouldn't take me long to deliver a message.
  Then I told him what my father had said about Vienna and Hugo Framm. His
  whole manner changed. He seemed bewildered at first, then slowly and
  increasingly pleased. He went to a shelf of books and showed me everything he
  could find that had anything to do with Framm, who was apparently a
  scientific star of magnitude. There was a paragraph about him in a recent
  issue of <i>Discovery</i>, and an article by him in a German magazine.
  Altogether I began to think it rather wonderful that Brad should have a
  chance to work with such a man. "But I don't see why he should even consider
  me," he kept saying. "There's nothing I've done yet that could possibly
  impress him."</p>

  <p>"But my father knows him, Brad."</p>

  <p>"Of course I realize your father has influence, but in a question of pure
  science...."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't a question of pure science. Perhaps Framm's a bit human.
  Perhaps he takes notice of what his friends say about people. My father's
  opinion of you might be high enough for someone to <i>want</i> to have
  you."</p>

  <p>"But is he such a close friend of your father?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard his name mentioned before, but that doesn't mean anything.
  My father knows so many people everywhere. He meets them once and then
  they're on his list of&mdash;well, I suppose you could call them
  <i>distant</i> friends."</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable."</p>

  <p>"My father <i>is</i> remarkable."</p>

  <p>"So's your mother&mdash;in a different way."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's a darling."</p>

  <p>"I'd guess she's a good bit younger."</p>

  <p>"Than my father?... Twenty years."</p>

  <p>"As much as that?"</p>

  <p>"Your surprise doesn't flatter her. Or perhaps it flatters him."</p>

  <p>He thought that out. I added: "I don't think years matter much,
  anyway&mdash; especially as you grow older."</p>

  <p>"That's true. It's when you're younger that the difference counts."</p>

  <p>I wondered if he was thinking of the difference between his age and mine.
  Then he went on: "Not that I <i>feel</i> she's any older than I am."</p>

  <p>"She is, though. Nearly twice as old."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, that can't be. I'm twenty-four."</p>

  <p>"And she's thirty-eight."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's not twice...."</p>

  <p>"I said <i>nearly</i> twice."</p>

  <p>"You also said years don't matter much."</p>

  <p>"And <i>you</i> said they <i>did</i>, when people are younger."</p>

  <p>"I think we're getting tied up in this argument. Let's have some
  lunch."</p>

  <p>That was a novelty, and a further one when we didn't go to an A.B.C., but
  to an Italian place near the Tottenham Court Road. We had minestrone and
  chicken <i>cacciatora</i>, meanwhile talking about Framm; or rather, he did
  most of the talking&mdash;I could see him building up a vision and I hoped he
  wouldn't expect too much. After all, my father's influence had its limits.
  But apparently it was only an already existing vision in a new form&mdash;a
  sort of frozen white-hot passion for whatever it was that couldn't be
  satisfactorily explained to a first-year history student. I let him
  rhapsodize all the way back to the College.</p>

  <p>There was grand opera at Covent Garden that evening and someone had lent
  my parents a box. We went to dine at Boulestin's first. I don't care for
  opera and all afternoon as I thought of it I grew more and more out of humor.
  Then when I got home I found my mother still lingering over tea. "I asked
  Brad to come," she greeted me, "but I don't suppose he will." She overdid the
  casualness and as soon as I looked at her she began to look at me in what I
  think, she thought was the same way.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't imagine so," I answered. "He was here only last night and
  it's quite a trip for a cup of tea."</p>

  <p>"You like him, don't you, Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He'd be rather hard to dislike."</p>

  <p>"I shall miss the lectures when he goes to Vienna."</p>

  <p>"<i>If</i> he goes. Or is it settled yet?"</p>

  <p>"I think your father's written to somebody. I hope it works out all
  right.... I can't help wondering if he really wants to go there. He always
  talked to me about the Cavendish."</p>

  <p>"To me too, but at present I think he's quite set on Vienna&mdash;on
  account of this man Framm."</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd had a chance to help him more&mdash;not as Framm can, of
  course, but that's not all the help he needs. I'd like to have made
  him&mdash;well, a bit more at home with life. More ... sophisticated ...
  easy- mannered...."</p>

  <p>"Worldly?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no, Jane, not that. He's naive, but I love it and I hated the way
  Julian talked the other night. I don't know what possessed him&mdash;he
  seemed to be trying to break down every ideal the boy had.... No, let him
  keep his ideals&mdash; he doesn't even have to be a worldly success if he
  doesn't want&mdash;but he ought to learn to get some fun out of life, that's
  my point. Worldly success has nothing to do with having fun."</p>

  <p>"It has just a bit, Mother."</p>

  <p>"Oh, just a <i>little</i> bit, perhaps&mdash;one must have <i>some</i>
  money. But not too much. I could be perfectly happy on a thousand a year.
  Pounds, I mean."</p>

  <p>"So could a great many English people who have to live on a fraction of
  that."</p>

  <p>"Well, say five hundred ... provided of course I had other things to make
  life worth living."</p>

  <p>"What other things?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, don't cross-examine me.... All I know is that Brad needs to
  learn what happiness there <i>can</i> be in life, and he ought to stop being
  such a hermit. But I'm all against him giving up his ideals, whatever Julian
  says."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me I'm the only person who's satisfied with him as he
  is."</p>

  <p>"Are you, darling? <i>Entirely</i> satisfied?"</p>

  <p>She gazed at me measuredly, as if the question needed a careful answer.
  But there wasn't time, for at that moment Brad arrived. He looked nervous,
  and almost as shy as when I had first seen him. He said he hadn't thought
  he'd be able to come, but at the very last he'd managed it. He was sorry he
  was so late and hoped he hadn't kept her waiting.</p>

  <p>"Did you come up by tube?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I took a taxi."</p>

  <p>"I'll send for some fresh tea," my mother said, and rang the bell, but
  nobody came; the servants were preparing for their evening out and hadn't
  expected to serve any more. I said I'd go to the kitchen and see about it,
  which I did, and then went upstairs to change.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Looking back now, I can see so much more than then. Even
when you are
  supposed to be adult for your age, it's hard to think of grownups as in the
  same world; you only want to feel you can be in theirs, and you just hope any
  mistake won't be noticed. And yet you are aware of things often more acutely
  than ever afterwards, your mind has antennae roaming into the unknown; you
  can even walk into it with eyes peering, but the step that isn't there always
  brings you up with a shock and a jolt.</p>

  <p>I had that shock about Brad, though I couldn't put any sufficient reason
  for it into words. When a man, after working three times harder than he
  should, slows down to twice as hard, there doesn't seem much for any of his
  friends to worry about. Nor when the same man spends a wet Sunday afternoon
  listening to a charming woman play Chopin, instead of drenching himself to
  the skin on Box Hill.</p>

  <p>Brad gave notice to the College authorities and they were very reasonable
  about it. They waived the full term they could have held him for, and said he
  could leave whenever he wanted. And my parents postponed again their return
  to New York&mdash;still presumably on my account.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile my mother kept on attending his lectures, at which he never (she
  said) gave her a look or a smile; but he did break a few of his other rules,
  whether it was she who tempted him or not. He began going to piano recitals,
  theaters, movies, and private views&mdash;sometimes alone with her, sometimes
  with my father or me also. There was nothing to stir gossip, much less
  scandal, in our fairly sophisticated circle; Julian Spee had escorted her
  similarly when he was less busy. She had often been in the throes of some fad
  or other, and perhaps my father figured that Brad was just an unusually
  masculine successor to Dalcroze Eurhythmics, Japanese flower arrangement, or
  the English Speaking Union. And it was sometimes my father himself who would
  make the date; he would say&mdash;"Oh, by the way, Christine, I've got a card
  for Marincourt's new exhibition&mdash;it's next Tuesday at the Wigmore
  Galleries. I shan't have time to go myself, but you might take Brad and show
  him what passes for art nowadays...." But when he had issued these
  invitations he had an odd look of only half pleasure whether they were
  accepted or not.</p>

  <p>That diary of mine jots down all the times Brad came to the house to dine.
  On Wednesdays it was, most often, and as the weeks passed it came to be every
  Wednesday, and always quite informally, without special invitation, with few
  or no other guests, and with plenty of music afterwards. He learned to sing
  "Schlafe Mein Prinzchen, Schlaf Ein," which suited his voice very well.</p>

  <p>Then all at once he let go his work. With anyone else I wouldn't have been
  surprised, since he was leaving the College so soon and there couldn't have
  been much to finish up before the end of term. But he did it with such
  abandon, and idleness didn't fit in with his personality. I used to see him
  wandering up and down Gower Street as if he had nowhere else to go; even
  Mathews made a comment. Probably the waitress at the A.B.C. did also, for he
  took to dropping in for coffee at unexpected times, and often lunched at
  better places. All of which adds up to nothing at all except an idea that
  grew in my mind and was never put into words.</p>

  <p>One morning towards the end of November my father announced that the great
  Hugo Framm was on his way to London to receive some degree or deliver some
  lecture, I forget which. "We'd better give a dinner for him. Good idea for
  Brad to meet him first at our house."</p>

  <p>My mother agreed it would be a good idea, but she lacked her usual
  enthusiasm for party planning. "Give me a list of people to ask," was all she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Brad can help you. He'll know a few professors and you can mix them up
  with anyone else you like." And he added, thoughtfully: "I don't think it has
  to be champagne."</p>

  <p>"Oh God," exclaimed my mother, "let's have champagne even if it
  <i>is</i>only professors."</p>

  <p>They tiffed about it in front of me in a way which was not only new in my
  experience, but out of character for both of them&mdash;my father being the
  last man to act the parsimonious host, and my mother not normally caring what
  wines were drunk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I didn't see Brad again till the party. If my mother saw
him she didn't
  tell me, not that it would have been a secret, but somehow we didn't talk
  about Brad much, and perhaps for that reason we talked a great deal about
  Hugo Framm. My mother was no respecter of celebrities, and we shared the same
  sense of humor, ribald and vagrant and often rather rude. Between us we built
  up a huge joke about Professor Framm that made us both afraid we might laugh
  indecently when the man actually took shape before our eyes. We first said he
  would be fat and pompous, with a thick German accent and a mustache that
  would get in the way of the soup; then we changed the picture because it
  seemed too much the conventional <i>Punch</i>-cartoon-type of German
  professor; we finally decided on a tall thin man more like Sherlock Holmes,
  with the most exquisite manner and an Oxford accent. He would kiss my
  mother's hand and look up at her at the same time, which made her say she
  wouldn't shoot till she saw the whites of his eyes. I said he'd probably
  engage in some scientific argument and shoot somebody else, or at least
  demand a duel on Hampstead Heath. "Now that's enough," she laughed. "We'll
  never dare to meet him if we keep on...." We didn't bother to ask my father
  what the man was really like, and I suppose I could have found a photograph
  of him somewhere if I'd wanted.</p>

  <p>It snowed a little the day of the party, just a white film over roofs and
  lawns; the traffic soon scoured it from the streets. There were about twenty
  people, and I wondered how Brad would like that, or if he cared any more. He
  had suggested only a very few of the names. But my mother, or else
  experience, had certainly done something to him socially; he was still shy,
  but not awkwardly so, rather now as if he didn't care whether he were shy or
  not. On the whole it was a dull crowd, far too many people who were only
  distinguished enough to be unsure whether others knew they were distinguished
  at all. The man next to me had explored some buried cities in Honduras, and
  my other neighbor was shortsighted and thought I was Lady Muriel Spencer,
  whom he had been talking to over cocktails. Brad was between my mother and
  the real Muriel; Framm was opposite him between my mother and Baroness
  Regensburg, who threw a little German at him occasionally. But there was no
  need; he spoke good English, though with an accent; while as for his
  appearance, it was nowhere near either my mother's foolery or mine; and that,
  perhaps, introduces him best, for he was the kind of man it would have been
  hard to imagine in advance. I had certainly never met anyone who so obviously
  looked important; you would have stared at him anywhere, if only on account
  of his large frame and massive, wide-browed head. In age he might have been
  anything between forty and sixty; the bushy hair was iron-gray, the eyes were
  blue and keen, the lips sensitive and also sensual. He gave an impression of
  physical and mental vigor that dominated without effort, and therefore
  without offense; and his voice had a matching quality that lured the listener
  from whomever else he was listening to, yet it wasn't loud&mdash;there were
  times when you wondered how you had managed to hear it. I think I was not the
  only person at that dinner party who was fascinated, but I wished there had
  been something in him to catch my mother's eye about and smile.</p>

  <p>Looking back on that first and only time I ever met Hugo Framm it is
  tempting to overload the diagnosis; but I do recollect, during dinner,
  wondering what faults a man like that would have, and deciding they must
  include vanity (since he had clearly so much to be vain about), and a kind of
  arrogance, since the continual experience of other people's admiration would
  give him either that or shyness, and he certainly wasn't shy. Yet these were
  deductions, not observations; and I cannot say that at any time he was either
  boastful or overbearing. Whether he was talking to my mother, or to the
  Baroness, or to Brad, or to the whole table, there was a constant radiation
  of what, for want of any other word, must be called charm; and in the end it
  was the constancy of this that seemed to me its only possible drawback. If
  only one could have caught a glimpse of something beneath the charm; one knew
  it was there, so there was no taint of superficiality, but one was teased,
  after a time, by the withholding.</p>

  <p>After dinner we sat in the drawing room in changing groups. It was not the
  sort of party for music, but there was a billiard room across the hall where
  card tables were set up. A bridge four detached themselves from the main
  party; they weren't missed and I wasn't aware of it when they returned. It
  must have been an unsatisfactory game. My father kept moving from group to
  group, the considerate host, and during one of these movements he found a
  chance to whisper in my ear that Brad had decided to accept Framm's
  offer.</p>

  <p>"You mean he's only just decided? I thought it was all settled weeks
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Well, no. Apparently he wasn't sure till they talked just now."</p>

  <p>"I didn't see them talking much."</p>

  <p>"It was after you left the table. They had quite a private chat. Framm has
  to go back to Vienna tomorrow night and if Brad can make arrangements in time
  they'll go together."</p>

  <p>"<i>Tomorrow night</i>?" That came as a shock.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that quick work?"</p>

  <p>"He won't have much to pack&mdash;Brad, I mean. Lives in furnished rooms,
  doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I've never been there."</p>

  <p>"Well, your mother must have&mdash;or else he once told me."</p>

  <p>"Father, do you really think it's the best thing he can do to go with
  Professor Framm?"</p>

  <p>"Why, don't you like Framm?"</p>

  <p>"I think he's very charming, but it does seem rather sudden if Brad only
  made up his mind tonight and he leaves tomorrow. I hope it's the right
  thing."</p>

  <p>"It's a great chance&mdash;if he uses it. Of course if he doesn't use his
  chances, nothing at all will do him much good.... We shall miss him when he's
  gone&mdash;your mother will, I know.... By the way, where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In the billiard room, I think. There's some bridge going on."</p>

  <p>But later I noticed that the bridge players were back in the drawing room,
  and I also couldn't see Brad anywhere. I was sure people had begun to notice
  my mother's absence and I ran upstairs to see if she were feeling ill, but
  there was no trace of her. I could see my father a little preoccupied behind
  his facade of suavity, and every now and then Hugo Framm's voice would
  somehow make a silence and then quietly fill it. About eleven o'clock John
  served more champagne and I hoped this was not a sign that the party would
  continue late, for I was beginning to feel a tension in the
  atmosphere&mdash;or perhaps it was only in my own mind. About a quarter past
  eleven my mother walked into the room with flushed cheeks and clenched hands.
  Few actually saw her, but she seemed to look for an audience from the doorway
  before speaking out as if to gain one. "I hope you'll forgive me for being
  terribly discourteous, but I've been at the radio&mdash;we've got one that
  picks up New York&mdash; it's the only way you can get the latest about the
  Simpson case over here...."</p>

  <p>It was a few days before the story broke officially in England, though the
  American tabloids and radio were agog with it, and London's informed society
  was already gossiping. There had been talk of it at the dinner table, and
  nobody seemed unwilling to discuss it again. While this was going on I saw
  Brad enter the room behind her. He edged into the crowd and stood by the
  bookshelves in an alcove, listening in a detached way and not taking sides in
  the argument, though I knew he was pro-Simpson. So was my mother&mdash;and
  never more emphatically, or perhaps I should say more naively, than then.
  Others differed and there was a lively exchange of views. Suddenly, amidst
  the chatter, I heard Framm's voice again and saw him towering above my mother
  with his large expansive smile, the charm turned on full.</p>

  <p>"I entirely agree with you, Mrs. Waring. There is no reason at all why
  your King should not marry whomever he wishes. There are many precedents for
  such marriages. Your Queen Mary's own grandmother was a mere Hungarian
  countess- -Claudine Rhedey, I think her name was, who married a Duke of
  W&uuml;rttemberg who was nephew to the Emperor. And there is, of course, the
  well-known example of Mrs. Fitzherbert's marriage to the Prince of Wales who
  later became your George IV. Two other direct descendants of George III were
  also married morganatically&mdash;Prince George to Louisa Fairbrother, an
  actress, and the Duke of Sussex to a lady called Cecilia Buggin ...
  <i>Buggin</i>... which is not, I have been told, a very nice-sounding name in
  English...."</p>

  <p>We all gaped at this display of erudition, and I couldn't myself decide
  whether it proved how thoroughly Framm made himself master of subjects
  outside his own field, or that he was just a snob. Anyhow, he sounded so
  authoritative that nobody tackled him from the other side, if there was any
  other side.</p>

  <p>The party broke up soon after that, and Brad left with the rest. I thought
  it was strange he didn't stay for a more personal good-by when the others had
  gone, but my father said he was probably hoping to get a lift into town with
  Framm. "He hasn't much time to spare if he's to catch the evening train
  tomorrow. It leaves at eight."</p>

  <p>I said: "He might have given me the chance to wish him well."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he knows you do. Anyhow, you can telephone tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"He's not on the telephone. It's another of the things he can't afford ...
  like taxis."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Rain fell during the night, but the next morning there was
blue sky and
  sunlight. I had breakfast before anyone else, then went out for a walk on the
  Heath. It was more than sunshine there, it was pure radiance. I followed my
  usual trail, along the Spaniards' Road to Highgate and then down the hill. I
  kept thinking of Brad and Framm and how odd, in several ways, the previous
  evening had been.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as I was crossing Parliament Hill Fields, I remembered my
  father's remark about Brad's furnished rooms and that my mother "must have"
  been there; if that were so, or even if it weren't, the conclusion leaped at
  me that there was no reason against my calling on him myself. I also
  remembered the address from that night of the Byfleets' party when we drove
  him home and he gave directions to Henry; it was 25 Renshaw Street, off the
  Camden Road. I found a tram that took me near by. In daylight the street
  seemed what it mainly was, a slum; but in London appearances can be
  deceptive; some of those identical houses have declined to different levels,
  so that they are not always either as bad or as passable as they look. The
  one Brad lived in had the remains of quality; it was dingy but not dirty; one
  could have lived in it if one had to. There was a rack of names in the
  hallway, and the stale smell of cabbage and floor polish that seems to
  pervade so many London houses whether slums or not. Brad was on the second
  floor; I climbed to it and tapped on his door. He called "Come in," as if he
  had left it ready for someone to open.</p>

  <p>It wasn't such a bad room, especially in the morning sunshine. The windows
  were tall and there was a marble mantelpiece surmounting a small gas fire.
  The furniture was shabby and the whole place littered as one might expect
  when anyone has a day's notice to pack for abroad. I took in the surroundings
  first because Brad was in some inner room; he came out fixing his tie.
  "Well...." he exclaimed. "This <i>is</i> a surprise...."</p>

  <p>I said yes, I imagined it was, and I hoped he didn't mind my having called
  on him without warning. "I was just taking a walk, it's such a lovely day, I
  thought I'd drop in to say good-by properly ... there wasn't a chance last
  night."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "So many things were happening."</p>

  <p>I laughed also. "I see you're packing and I know you must be terribly busy
  ... but I did want to wish you plenty of fun and success."</p>

  <p>"That's nice of you&mdash;very nice of you."</p>

  <p>I decided I wouldn't stay more than ten minutes, but in the meantime I
  might as well sit down. When I did so he moved over to the mantelpiece,
  leaning his back against it and looking as if he didn't know what to say
  next.</p>

  <p>I said: "I'm glad I've seen where you live. These old houses do have big
  rooms, that's one thing."</p>

  <p>"I changed from the set upstairs a few months ago. These are bigger and
  there's a kitchenette. I couldn't exactly afford the change, but I decided to
  spend more on luxury. I'm not such an austere devil at heart as some people
  imagine."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't call it <i>luxury</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, <i>you</i> wouldn't."</p>

  <p>There was a silence then which both of us, I think, kept up deliberately
  till it was broken by some rather noisy plumbing in another part of the
  house. He laughed again. "Do you wonder I didn't give any dinner parties
  here? Impossible place, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. You once said all you wanted was to do useful work.
  Plenty of useful work has been done in rooms like this."</p>

  <p>"And you think I've changed since I said that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe it's just the mood you're in at the thought of
  leaving."</p>

  <p>He said suddenly: "Let's take a walk."</p>

  <p>"<i>Now</i>? A walk? But ... can you...." I looked round at the unfinished
  packing.</p>

  <p>"You said it was a lovely day."</p>

  <p>"On the Heath, yes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then let's go there."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you've enough time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"All right then."</p>

  <p>We took a bus up the Hampstead Road, and during the ride he went on
  talking of his rooms and their amenities so ironically that I began to see
  less and less point in it. Was he trying to hate the place just to help him
  over the wrench of departure? I hinted at that, and he answered: "Wait till
  we start walking and I'll let you into a secret."</p>

  <p>We got out at Jack Straw's Castle, then took to the open Heath. "Well?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going away."</p>

  <p>I had a curious instant of relief that surprised me more than he had; then
  I was shocked.</p>

  <p>"You mean you're not leaving for Vienna tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not leaving for Vienna ... at all."</p>

  <p>I asked if that meant that the whole arrangement with Framm was
  canceled.</p>

  <p>"Yes ... or will be when he gets to hear of it."</p>

  <p>"You haven't told him yet?"</p>

  <p>"I called him at his hotel and they said he wasn't to be disturbed until
  noon. The prima donna."</p>

  <p>"You don't like him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;he's great. A genius, if ever there was one."</p>

  <p>"But you were packing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes ... until I changed my mind."</p>

  <p>"When was that?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't look at the clock."</p>

  <p>"You just <i>suddenly</i> changed your mind?"</p>

  <p>"I'd been thinking it over most of the night. I didn't sleep."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Brad, I'm so sorry."</p>

  <p>"Sorry that I'm not going? That doesn't sound as if I were very
  popular."</p>

  <p>"You know I don't mean that.... I'm just sorry you've had all this worry.
  You must have been worried if it kept you awake all night."</p>

  <p>"And you're also sorry I've decided to stay here ... aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Brad, it's no good asking me for an opinion till I know what made you
  change your mind. Maybe you have a perfectly good reason."</p>

  <p>"And what if I haven't? Supposing I just don't want to go? Dammit, I've a
  right to please myself, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"And to change my mind as many times as I like?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>We walked some way without speaking; then I said: "You should know best.
  Whatever the reason is, I hope you're right. My father will be disappointed,
  but that doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"It does, though. He's been very kind to me. You've all been kind." I
  caught the tremor in his voice and thought how foolish it would be if we both
  broke down and wept in the middle of Hampstead Heath for no reason that
  either of us would mention.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't keep on saying that, Brad. My father often helps promising
  young men&mdash;he gets a kick out of it. I don't mean he doesn't genuinely
  like you, but I wouldn't want you to feel so terribly grateful ... he enjoys
  it, just as he enjoyed it while Julian was baiting you the other night."</p>

  <p>"Baiting me?... <i>Julian</i>...?"</p>

  <p>"That argument you had&mdash;about science and civilization, all that.
  Julian was trying to break down something you believed in."</p>

  <p>"That's what your mother seemed to think."</p>

  <p>"Of course a good deal of what he said may be true. It doesn't pay to be
  too idealistic. You said just now you weren't as austere as some people
  imagined, and that's a good thing&mdash;you used to be <i>too</i> austere.
  But you needn't go to the other extreme."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea what you're talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I think I have. Only you don't help me to understand you. Perhaps you
  don't want me to."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that. I'm not sure that I properly understand myself." We walked
  a few hundred yards, then he took my arm (the first time he had ever done
  so); he said quietly: "Let's chuck the argument. Do you mind? I told you the
  secret&mdash;nobody knows yet that I'm not going ... till I can wake the
  professor. I don't think it'll bother him much, that's one thing."</p>

  <p>"The real secret is why you changed your mind."</p>

  <p>"You're a persistent child."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a child at all, but that would make another argument."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let's not have one. Not even a small one, from now on. Change the
  subject&mdash;talk of something else&mdash;anything else.... It <i>is</i>
  beautiful here, as you said. I didn't somehow expect this sort of weather.
  Everyone in Dakota knows about London fogs, but this bright cold air.... Look
  at those boys&mdash; they're optimists&mdash;they've brought sleds ... or
  sledges, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Sledges over here. Sleds in America."</p>

  <p>He picked up the topic with grateful artificial enthusiasm. "Lots of words
  like that, aren't there? Sidewalk, pavement&mdash;but in England pavement's
  called roadway. And of course subway and tube. Though that's not quite right,
  because there aren't any real tubes in New York.... But the oddest of all, I
  think, is thumbtack and drawing pin.... <i>Drawing pin</i>.... Can you beat
  that?"</p>

  <p>I tried to, and we kept it up till we reached the pond at the top of Heath
  Street. Then, as we were so near, I felt I wanted to go home. There was
  nothing else I could say, and nothing at all I could do. I asked him not to
  see me to the house and we separated at the tube station. "Oh, Brad," I said,
  as he put coins into the ticket machine, "you don't have to tell me anything
  you don't want, but I hope you aren't going to make a hash of things."</p>

  <p>He gave me an empty look and my arm a final squeeze, then dashed for the
  elevator ... lift, my mind checked, just as emptily, as I walked away.</p>

  <p>My father had left for the City, John told me; also that my mother was out
  shopping and would not be in to lunch. So I lunched alone, then went to the
  library, listened to the radio (wireless), played phonograph (gramophone)
  records, then got out my history notes and tried to concentrate on Stubbs's
  Select Charters. It wasn't particularly easy.</p>

  <p>My mother came home in time for tea, and I couldn't help thinking how
  beautiful she looked, with her face flushed from the cold and her hair a
  little wind-blown. And there was a quality in her eyes, too elusive to
  describe, but "trancelike" occurred to me even though I had never seen anyone
  in a trance; a sort of serene observance which, if there is any difference
  between the words, must be a less active and more ritual thing than
  observation. She pulled off her gloves with long slow movements, gossiping
  meanwhile about her shopping and the special shortcakes she had been able to
  get at Fortnum and Mason's, and the trouble Henry had had to avoid skidding
  on the slippery roads. "It wasn't really a day for driving&mdash;more for
  taking a walk."</p>

  <p>That was my cue, if I had wanted one, to tell her about my own walk on the
  Heath with Brad and his change of mind about Vienna. But I wondered also if
  she had deliberately given me the cue, and that made me decide to say
  nothing. I just watched her, as she poured tea, and thought how close you can
  be to someone you love, so close that you dare not go closer lest you break
  that final shell of separateness that is your own as well as the other's
  precious possession. Dusk came into the room; she went over to the fire to
  poke it into a blaze, and as she did so, carrying the poker and chattering
  all the time, she looked like a gay sleepwalker, if there ever has been such
  a person.</p>

  <p>Presently she asked me what I thought of Framm.</p>

  <p>I said: "He wasn't a bit funny, as we thought, was he?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, nobody is ever funny like that."</p>

  <p>"Did Brad listen to the radio with you?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Brad</i>? Why?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him come in from the hall just after you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was in the billiard room." She began to laugh. "I'll ask him
  if you like."</p>

  <p><i>Ask</i> him? I saw the flush on her face deepen as she caught my eye.
  She added: "I mean&mdash;when I see him&mdash;or write to him. Or don't you
  think I'll ever see him again?"</p>

  <p>I said: "It was all settled he should leave London this evening."</p>

  <p>"I know, but things sometimes happen at the last minute. A most absurd
  rush, if you ask me. Why couldn't he have more time? And so close to
  Christmas.... Maybe he just won't go&mdash;I wouldn't blame him."</p>

  <p>"Framm's leaving tonight too, so it seemed a good idea for them to go
  together."</p>

  <p>"<i>It</i> seemed, <i>it</i> seemed. All so impersonal. People are human
  ... or don't scientists think so?" She lit a cigarette and offered me her
  case. Her hand was trembling. "Your father would worry about that."</p>

  <p>"You mean your hand trembling?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, we really are in two different worlds today. I was cold in the
  car, I'm still a bit shivery.... No, I meant he'd say I oughtn't to encourage
  you to smoke."</p>

  <p>"He lets me have drinks at parties."</p>

  <p>"But you don't drink much, I've noticed. I'm very glad."</p>

  <p>"I don't smoke much either."</p>

  <p>"I know. You don't do anything to excess. And you're truthful and decent
  and growing up charmingly. Really, I'm very happy about you, Jane."</p>

  <p>"I don't always tell <i>all</i> the truth."</p>

  <p>"Who does?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to be able to, though."</p>

  <p>"One of these days you'll fall in love, then we'll see."</p>

  <p>"See what?"</p>

  <p>"Whether you do <i>that</i> to excess ... and also if you tell all the
  truth about it."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't want to fall <i>half</i> in love."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you? It's pleasanter sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Not if you're in love with someone who's in love with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be too sure. That doesn't always make it plain sailing. Or
  plain telling, either."</p>

  <p>John came in with the week-old <i>New York Times</i> that had just
  arrived. It reminded me to ask if there were any definite plans for her
  return to America with my father.</p>

  <p>"We'll spend Christmas here anyway. After that I don't know. New York's
  impossible in January and February, it simply means going straight to
  Florida. Harvey likes Florida, of course." Calling my father Harvey was a
  sure sign she was thinking of something else.</p>

  <p>She went on: "Oh Jane, darling, don't bother me for plans. How can one
  make them so far ahead? Things are all going to pieces, anyhow ... in Europe
  ... everywhere.... They're building up for another war."</p>

  <p>I said, deliberately: "I wonder how that would affect Brad in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"He's an American, he'd be neutral. Of course I know that wouldn't stop
  him from getting into trouble. You might not think it from the shy manner he
  has, but he's very impulsive."</p>

  <p>"I know that."</p>

  <p>"Such a one-idea'd creature. All or nothing. No compromise ... and
  sometimes so impractical."</p>

  <p>"I know that too."</p>

  <p>"But a very delightful person." The cat had followed John into the room
  and was now curling about our legs. "To give somebody a cat, for instance.
  I'll never forget John's face when Brad brought it that afternoon. It broke
  the ice, though. After that we got to be friends quite fast."</p>

  <p>"The cat and you?"</p>

  <p>"No, darling. Are you still in that other world of yours? The cat and I
  were friends instantly. Some men take a little longer."</p>

  <p>"I was in Ireland."</p>

  <p>"So you were.... I saw quite a lot of him while you were away.... More
  than when you came back.... I don't know why. It's a pity he's so poor ...
  poor and proud ... it's a frightening combination...." The cat purred loudly
  into the silence that followed. Then John re-entered and some kind of spell
  was broken. "Mr. Waring just telephoned to say he wouldn't be in to dinner,
  madame, and he might be late, so please not to wait up for him."</p>

  <p>"I certainly shan't&mdash;in fact I'll have a snack in my room and go to
  bed early. I need some rest after last night.... What about you, Jane?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be all right. I've got work to do, or else I'll find someone to go
  to a movie with."</p>

  <p>"You're not thinking of going to the station to see Brad off?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not&mdash;he wouldn't want me."</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly that, but...." She didn't know how to finish the
  sentence, and then I sensed, almost with certainty, that she knew of Brad's
  change of plan, or at any rate suspected it; and that out of simple affection
  for me she didn't want me to hang about Victoria Station in the cold, looking
  for someone who wouldn't turn up. At least I think that was her motive. As I
  said, you get so close, but the very closeness brings you up against the
  barrier.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The mail always came to the house early; John used to sort
it and bring it
  to the bedrooms. There was a letter for me the next morning with a London
  postmark and addressed in a writing I didn't recognize, yet as I tore it open
  the thought came to me, clairvoyantly if you like, that I had never seen
  Brad's writing before.</p>

  <p>It said: "My dear Jane&mdash;" (and he had never called me that before,
  either- -in fact I don't think he had ever called me anything after the first
  few Miss Warings at the beginning)&mdash;"Thank you for coming to see me, and
  the walk and talk on the Heath. I'm just leaving for the boat train at
  Victoria to join Hugo Framm&mdash;we shall be in Vienna the day after
  tomorrow. After all, I've a right to change my mind as often as I like, and
  he needn't know how narrowly I missed the chance of working with him. When I
  say work, by the way, that's just what I mean, <i>work</i>. So don't expect
  me to write too often, but there's a warm welcome if ever you come to Vienna,
  as perhaps you might some day&mdash;who knows?&mdash; In great
  haste&mdash;Brad."</p>

  <p>I took the letter downstairs but didn't mention it; not that they would
  have dreamed of asking to see it, but it might have seemed peculiar if I
  hadn't offered to let them.</p>

  <p>We never talked much at breakfast; my father would read the papers and
  sometimes make comments on the news; if he didn't, or if we had nothing much
  to say in reply, nobody thought anybody else was surly.</p>

  <p>However, this morning he folded the paper at last and put it by his plate
  with a gesture I knew meant he was going to read something from it; first of
  all, though, he spread marmalade on a piece of toast and crunched off a big
  corner. "Well, well," he said, still crunching, "our friend will be halfway
  across France by now...."</p>

  <p>I looked at my mother.</p>

  <p>He went on: "It says here 'Professor Hugo Framm left for the Continent
  last night accompanied by his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Dr. Mark Bradley, who will spend
  some time in the professor's Viennese laboratories....'"</p>

  <p>My mother put her hand to her face for a moment and when she took it away
  she had on that glassy smile, as if she were about to say hello to a
  maharajah.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought it was important enough to put in the paper,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't have been," replied my father, "but for Framm's instinct for
  publicity. This is how it goes on.... 'Asked what would be the subject of
  their work together, Professor Framm replied: "I don't know yet, but Dr.
  Bradley is an excellent chess player, so I shall certainly put him on to
  something difficult"'&mdash;Newspapers go for things like that. Incidentally,
  I didn't know he was a chess player."</p>

  <p>I said: "Neither did I."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," said my mother.</p>

  <p>Then she rang the bell for more coffee.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I have tried to tell all this as it looked to me then;
which is perhaps
  the best way when nothing happened afterwards to make completely certain any
  of the things that were conjectural at the time. Of course, as I grew older,
  I balanced the probabilities more maturely; for instance, it seems to me now
  far less unthinkable that my mother was capable of a love affair. When you
  are young you tend to feel that things like that can only happen in newspaper
  cases, and that your own family has some special exemption from frailty; then
  as you live on, you learn, and what you principally learn is a frailty in
  yourself that makes you include others for sheer companionship. I know now,
  looking back on it all, that it was the first major "situation" in which I
  felt myself involved, and that I was so anxious not to blunder that I tiptoed
  all around it, deliciously thrilled as well as troubled, whereas nowadays I
  would probably cut in with a few straight questions to somebody.</p>

  <p>And yet I am rather sure that the affair, in any downright sense, never
  came to anything. Perhaps only because Brad left in time. I think they were
  both in love, but after the first shyness he may have been more breakneck
  about it than she, partly from inexperience, but chiefly because my mother
  had a very realistic valuation of what life could offer; she loved comforts
  and gaiety and society; I don't believe she would ever have been happy with a
  poor man in spite of what she said.</p>

  <p>I think it possible that after Brad had met Framm at the party and had
  definitely decided to go to Vienna, she saw him alone and persuaded him
  against going; that he then asked for some rash show-down, perhaps even
  suggested her running away with him. Of course she wouldn't consent to that;
  what she really wanted was for things to go on as they had been, agreeably
  and perhaps dangerously, with Brad taking her about everywhere and my father
  an appeased if not entirely deceived spectator. It wouldn't have been heroic,
  but it was the sort of thing my mother could have carried off with
  virtuosity, if only Brad had been willing. I would guess that he was not. Yet
  after the argument between them she probably thought he would change his mind
  (as he actually did, before he changed it back again), and this gave her that
  trancelike happiness the next day, that confidence that somehow or other she
  could always hold him where she wanted and on her own terms. I know she was
  dumbfounded when he left, and for a time quite shattered.</p>

  <p>Had I been a little responsible for his second change of plan? Perhaps. I
  have often thought that the walk and the talk we had on the Heath may have
  just tipped the scale.</p>

  <p>Neither of them ever discussed it with me afterwards, but three years ago,
  when my mother was dying from the effects of a motor smash in Texas, my
  father said something under stress of great emotion. It seemed she had been
  driving too fast, alone and at night, and the police sergeant who had reached
  the scene of the accident met us at the airport and told us she had given as
  an excuse that she was hurrying for a doctor to attend her son who was ill.
  Of course she may have been half out of her mind when she said this, but I
  also think it possible that she didn't know how badly she was hurt and was
  just trying to talk herself out of a traffic summons. It would have been like
  her.</p>

  <p>As we left the hospital when it was all over, my father mumbled: "It was
  like that with the radio that time. Did you ever try to get America on the
  set we had in London?... You couldn't." I didn't tell him I had known that
  all along.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part2"
     name="part2">PART TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Again I was in the little room on the twenty-fifth floor
  with Mr. Small. I was much more aware of my surroundings than on the first
  occasion; I noticed how the desk between me and him had kick marks on the
  front and cigarette burns on the top, how dirty the windows were, and how
  last month (and it was already the eighth of July) had not yet been torn off
  the pictorial calendar.</p>

  <p>"Ah, good morning, Miss Waring." He half rose and bowed; I smiled and sat
  down as before. He opened his briefcase, riffled through its contents, then
  found some papers which he laid on the desk. "I was hoping I wouldn't have to
  bother you again, but something cropped up."</p>

  <p>I said it was all right to me, no bother at all. But as a matter of fact
  it had been; I was leaving New York that night and had many last-minute
  things to do. I suppose I could have ignored the letter and pretended
  afterwards that it didn't reach me in time, but I had a curiosity to know
  what Mr. Small still wanted&mdash;indeed, it was more than curiosity, there
  was a touch of apprehension that had grown since my earlier visit.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was imagination that Mr. Small's manner seemed a little brisker
  than before, if not actually brusque.</p>

  <p>"Miss Waring, according to your statement on March fourteenth, you didn't
  see Bradley after the year 1936, when you were both in London?"</p>

  <p>"I ... I don't remember saying that."</p>

  <p>"You don't?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly."</p>

  <p>He picked up a sheaf of papers. "Here it is ... verbatim.... Question:
  'How long since you had any communication with Bradley?'&mdash;Answer: 'Oh
  years. Not since before the war. The English war&mdash;1939.' Question: '1936
  being the year you knew him in London?'&mdash;Answer: 'That's right. My
  parents and I returned to America the following year.' Question: 'Did he
  return to America?'&mdash;Answer: 'Not that I know of.' Question: 'At any
  rate you didn't see him in America?'&mdash; Answer: 'No. Never....' Would you
  like to verify this?" He slid the typewritten sheets across the desk.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it's all right," I said, taking them.</p>

  <p>Mr. Small lit a cigarette for himself but did not offer me one this time.
  "Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to read through the entire
  transcript. Then you can tell me if there are any answers you wish to
  withdraw or qualify. And if everything's correct, sign it. You really ought
  to have done that when you were here before."</p>

  <p>I read it, pretending to do so slowly so that I would have more time to
  think. It was curious and not at all reassuring to note how some of the
  questions now seemed far more challenging and my own answers far more evasive
  than I had thought at the time. But I said cheerfully in the end: "Okay.
  Where do I sign?"</p>

  <p>"At the bottom of each page." He handed me a pen.</p>

  <p>After that was over he thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and
  tilted back in the swivel chair. "And now, Miss Waring, what about the time
  you saw Bradley <i>after</i> 1936?"</p>

  <p>I had myself under control.</p>

  <p>"You did, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did."</p>

  <p>"When was it?"</p>

  <p>"The next year&mdash;1937."</p>

  <p>"The year you said you and your parents returned to America?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but...."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Please tell me what you were going to say."</p>

  <p>"All right. I was going to say that all the statements I made were
  actually and literally correct. I <i>did</i> return with my parents to
  America in 1937, but later in the year I went back. And I didn't see Bradley
  again <i>in London</i>. You didn't ask me if I saw him again
  <i>anywhere</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it have been natural for you to tell me? Unless of course you
  weren't anxious for me to find out."</p>

  <p>"If you'd been anxious to find out you'd have asked me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I was more anxious to find out whether you were being altogether
  frank."</p>

  <p>"I'm not on oath to be frank. I'm on oath to tell the truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;the whole truth and nothing but the truth," he finished for me.
  "Have you had a legal training?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then you probably aren't aware of the narrow difference between
  <i>suggestio falsi</i> and <i>suppressio peri</i>."</p>

  <p>I was but I chose not to say so. Either he didn't think writers knew much
  or else he didn't know I was a writer; the first might have been less
  personally unflattering, yet I hoped it was the latter because I could excuse
  him more easily.</p>

  <p>He went on: "Well, no need to argue. Perhaps I can save time by referring
  to a few notes I have." He consulted them. "I see you were in Vienna in 1937.
  Bradley was also in Vienna then.... Now let's begin from there, shall
  we?"</p>

  <p>I tried to absorb the shock and perhaps succeeded. "Certainly. There's no
  secret about any of it. But I still don't like your saying it would have been
  natural for me to volunteer information. It isn't as if we'd both been having
  a friendly chat."</p>

  <p>That was a mistake. He said: "If you'd rather chat than answer questions,
  do so by all means. Chat about the time you met Bradley in Vienna."</p>

  <p>But of course it was next to impossible with that shorthand girl at my
  elbow; the words fizzled out like a car stalling; I had to press the starter
  again and again. Finally came the full stop, then silence. I think all I said
  was: "My father was in Europe on business&mdash;I was with him&mdash;he had
  to pass through Vienna, and while I was there I naturally took the
  opportunity to look up an old friend. He was working in some laboratory. We
  only met for an hour or so."</p>

  <p>"What work was he doing in this laboratory?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly. Probably the same sort of thing he did in London
  ... physics ... mathematics ... whatever it was."</p>

  <p>The second full stop. Presently: "Did you meet any of his friends in
  Vienna?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he liked working there?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed to."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak German?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well."</p>

  <p>"How do you think he got on with the people he was working with?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I expect if you work in a laboratory you have to get on
  with the others or else quit."</p>

  <p>"He didn't take you to visit the laboratory?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Or suggest it?"</p>

  <p>"No. There wasn't time, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Where was he living?"</p>

  <p>"In rooms. Somewhere near the East Station, I believe. I didn't go
  there."</p>

  <p>"Was he very busy?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine so."</p>

  <p>"And so far as you could judge he was satisfied with his position?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>"Would you say it was a better job than the one he had had in London?"</p>

  <p>"He said it gave him more time for research, which was what he wanted to
  do."</p>

  <p>"I understand the London University people were sorry to let him go. Did
  you know that?"</p>

  <p>"No, but it doesn't surprise me."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever complain that he didn't get enough time for research in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"He never complained of anything. Not to me."</p>

  <p>"So you can't think of any particular reason why he might have preferred
  the Vienna job?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he wanted a change of scene, but that's only a guess."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you tell me what you <i>know</i>."</p>

  <p>"But I <i>don't</i> know. It's so many years ago, for one thing."</p>

  <p>He looked me over in a way I didn't quite like. "<i>Eight</i> years ago.
  So that trip to Vienna doesn't stand out very importantly in your life?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. My father and I were only there a couple of days."</p>

  <p>"But what about the <i>next</i> visit ... in 1938?"</p>

  <p>I don't think I succeeded in disguising much of the shock then. I said,
  when I was ready: "So you know about that too?"</p>

  <p>He made a grimace that was almost a smirk. "You bet. But you'd have gotten
  around to chatting about it sooner or later, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>I decided to be brazen. "No, perhaps I wouldn't. I can't see the reason
  for all this questioning. I'm the sort of person you'd get far more out of if
  you'd tell me what it's all for. And also where Bradley is now."</p>

  <p>He began doodling on a scratch pad. "I don't think you quite appreciate
  your position, Miss Waring.... However, we might as well call a halt for this
  afternoon." He signaled to the shorthand girl, who thereupon closed her book
  and crossed the room to a typing table. "Have Miss Waring sign that before
  she leaves."</p>

  <p>He got up, concentrated his glance on my left thigh, and said: "Going
  away, then?"</p>

  <p>I looked down and saw that the airline envelope containing my ticket was
  sticking halfway out of my coat pocket. Perhaps he thought it proved how
  honest I was, for when I merely said "Yes" he didn't ask me where I was going
  or seem particularly interested. He shook hands with me before he went
  out.</p>

  <p>That girl took half an hour to do the job. She was so slow I was tempted
  to offer to do it myself except that I knew she wouldn't let me. I smoked and
  chafed at the delay and read the only literature lying loose in the
  office&mdash;a 1945 <i>World Almanac</i> and a book called <i>This Man
  Truman</i> which was all about that man Truman.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It's partly a wartime neurosis, maybe, the feeling that
Uncle Sam is
  always stern and monitory, and that any of his official inquiries can only be
  directed towards somebody's undoing. But it's also an American (and for that
  matter a British) tradition that you do not have to be afraid of your own
  government if you have done no wrong. Thus, as I left Mr. Small's office for
  the second time, I realized how unco-operative I had been again, but I was
  not in the least scared on my own account&mdash;though that may partly have
  been due to a family background of wealth and security. When I was a child it
  really mattered to be a Waring, and I was fortunately grown-up before I
  realized it could also be a handicap.</p>

  <p>I was, however, a little bit scared on account of Brad. That he had got
  himself in a jam of some sort seemed obvious, and I wanted to help him,
  whatever it was, but without exactly perjuring myself. Of course if he turned
  out to be guilty of something serious my attitude might have to change, but
  so far I hadn't been allowed to discover anything. This gave me a sort of
  alibi; even if Brad <i>were</i> guilty of anything serious I could give him
  every benefit of every doubt so long as I was myself kept in these
  doubts.</p>

  <p>Throughout the plane journey to California that night I kept turning over
  question and answer in my mind. I wondered if I had been merely cautious, or
  so <i>over</i>cautious that I had actually made things worse. How much did
  Mr. Small already know about Brad in Vienna?... I tried to sleep, and between
  Chicago and Kansas City succeeded; but after that the climb to high altitude
  wakened me and I stared for miles out of the window. We were flying through
  cloud, and all I could see was a part of the wing, shimmering like a silk
  dress with silver buttons; there must have been a moon, but the effect was of
  pale air, infinite, shadowless. Gradually I dozed off again, and then Vienna
  came back to me, eager to be remembered, over the wastelands of New
  Mexico.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I went there with my father in the summer of '37. Earlier
in the year I
  had returned to London after a short trip to America, and had failed to pass
  the examination that was the first step to a history degree. I don't know
  quite why, beyond the obvious reason that I didn't get enough marks; I had
  studied fairly hard, and am not exactly stupid, but perhaps I am also not a
  good examinee&mdash;if a question interests me, I spend too much time on it,
  so that I have to rush through some of the others. The only relevance my
  failure has here is the effect it had on my father; it made him just slightly
  aloof, as if I had told him a risque story he had heard before. My mother's
  attitude (by letter) was to ignore the whole thing completely. She had lost
  her interest in educational attainments since Brad's departure, and I never
  heard that she ever attended a physics lecture again.</p>

  <p>My father's business would take him to several European countries, so he
  picked me up in London when term ended and we made a tour that included
  Paris, Berlin, and Rome. We flew most of the way, were given parties and
  receptions, and met various people of political and financial importance.
  Being the first time I had traveled alone with him as a social equal, it
  proved an exciting experience for a nineteen-year-old. In Rome he learned he
  would have to go to Budapest, and only this chance put Vienna on our
  itinerary. We stayed a night at the Bristol, and after some trouble the next
  morning I managed to telephone Brad at his laboratory and ask him over to
  lunch. His voice was calmer than mine and he told me he couldn't ever lunch
  so far from his work, because it would take up more than the hour he
  permitted himself, but if we cared to sample a local restaurant he would be
  pleased to entertain both of us.</p>

  <p>This sounded chilly, and when in due course I saw the place I was glad my
  father had excused himself at the last moment. It was a pavement cafe on the
  Mariahilfer Strasse, crowded and rather dingy, the outside tables occupied by
  unshaven furtive men who looked as if they were plotting revolution but were
  probably only watching for some girl. Brad waved from an inner table as I
  entered; he seemed well enough at home there. He was cordial, rather
  detached, and said he was sorry my father couldn't come, sorry also our stay
  was so short (I had told him on the telephone we were leaving for Budapest
  that afternoon), and sorry especially about the hour limit for lunch. It was
  some scientific equipment that had to be constantly tended, otherwise of
  course he could and would have got away for longer. The explanation took the
  sting out of his behavior, and I gave him a look that told myself that I
  still liked him. Then the proprietor came up with a greasy typewritten menu,
  everything very cheap, and I realized how far Brad had developed from the shy
  boy who had timidly asked me to suggest some expensive London hotel where he
  could wine and dine my parents in the style to which they were accustomed.
  Obviously now he took the view that what was good enough for him was good
  enough for anybody, and on the whole I approved the change, though it would
  doubtless show itself truculently till he got used to it. He seemed much more
  than six months older to me, but that again was likable; it gave the
  impression of an adult process, a maturing of personality, nothing to cause
  worry about what had "happened" to him. I commented that he did not drink or
  smoke, but he said he did sometimes, an occasional cigarette or glass of
  beer. "And it's uncommonly good beer in Vienna," he assured me, as if he had
  been a connoisseur of beer in many other cities; it was almost reassuring to
  find that his na&iuml;vet&eacute;, though disappearing, was still there in patches.</p>

  <p>The food was not bad for its price, and I noticed that he got special
  attention from the waitress who served us and who talked to him familiarly in
  German. His own replies were halting, and he said he made a point of
  practicing on her as much as possible, because textbook German, which he
  could read quite well, was so heavy and uncolloquial.</p>

  <p>All in all, he looked settled and by no means unhappy, and after what had
  been in my mind as a possibility I was much relieved. He also said, when I
  asked, that his work was making progress, though of course it had so far
  hardly more than begun.</p>

  <p>"And how do you like Framm?"</p>

  <p>"He's remarkable. His sort of mathematics is beyond anything I could have
  dreamed of."</p>

  <p>"So he's teaching you?"</p>

  <p>"He's giving me time to learn. He has to, before I can be of any use to
  him. It's like a new language&mdash;in fact, that's what it really is."</p>

  <p>"And what about him being of use to you?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally that goes with it. I can't ever be grateful enough to your
  father for giving me such a chance."</p>

  <p>"You still haven't told me how you like him, though. Framm, I mean."</p>

  <p>"He can be very charming."</p>

  <p>"But do you <i>like</i> him?"</p>

  <p>"Well enough. And it wouldn't matter if I didn't. He's the sort of man you
  don't have to like."</p>

  <p>I said I didn't know what kind of man that was.</p>

  <p>He laughed and said: "All women like him, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"That's still not an answer."</p>

  <p>"All right ... let's change the subject. How's Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>"Fine.... Do you still manage to get your long Sunday walks?"</p>

  <p>"I've been to the Semmering several times. That's not far away. Very
  beautiful country."</p>

  <p>"And altogether you're quite happy in Vienna?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's fine too." We sat over coffee and I told him about my
  failure to pass the examination. He sympathized. "But you'll try again next
  year?"</p>

  <p>"If I'm still in London. I don't have any exact plans. I'm beginning to
  think I'd like to earn a living."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble. Journalism maybe. I'd like to get on a paper but the
  fact that my father controls one inhibits me. I've a feeling I'd either be
  favored or else never be given credit even if I deserved any. Perhaps I could
  change my name."</p>

  <p>"The easiest way to do that would be to get married." It was the sort of
  remark he couldn't possibly have made a year before, but there was still
  naivete in it&mdash;a small boy's approach to intimacy.</p>

  <p>I said: "Yes, if there were anyone I <i>wanted</i> to marry."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present.... What about you? Any nice <i>Fr&auml;uleins</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty, if I had time for them." But he said it now with a smile and felt
  the need to add: "I'm serious&mdash;I <i>don't</i> have the time, I work ten
  hours a day as a rule."</p>

  <p>"And then go home and dream mathematics?"</p>

  <p>"Often."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch, paid the check, and signaled a taxi for me on the
  pavement outside. "Where do you live?" I asked, detaining him.</p>

  <p>"Near the East Station. About the same kind of place I had in London, but
  the plumbing makes a different kind of noise. A Viennese noise."</p>

  <p>"That ought to be quite musical."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "You could come and hear it if you were staying longer, but
  since you're leaving today&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's too bad. I wish I weren't, but this is just a flying
  visit&mdash; literally. I must try to manage another trip."</p>

  <p>"And your mother&mdash;she's not with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's in Maine. I don't think she'll get across this year&mdash;she
  probably thinks she owes America a summer."</p>

  <p>"Well, remember me to your father."</p>

  <p>"Of course. And you remember me to the charming Professor."</p>

  <p>"I will.... And have a good time in Budapest. I've not been there, but
  they say it's well worth seeing."</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know," I cried, out of the taxi window. "Good-
  by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I did let him know, in a chatty letter, which rather to my
surprise he
  answered, and for the next six months we corresponded fairly regularly,
  though at longer intervals. They weren't interesting letters, except one. He
  usually mentioned the weather, any particular walk he had taken, the fact
  that he was still very busy, and his progress with German. No reference ever
  to theaters or concerts or operas. He might have been living in a village
  instead of one of the world's gayest capitals. Actually he had reverted to
  the sort of life he had had before meeting my mother, except that the
  background was different and he himself stood bigger in the foreground. But
  once he wrote, quite exceptionally and rather astonishingly:</p>

  <p>Scientists in movies and magazine ads are always shown examining test
  tubes as if on the brink of some great discovery, but I guess the outside
  world doesn't know how rarely one ever discovers anything, the road to the
  frontier is already so long and difficult, and when you get there you feel
  rather lonely and undramatic like someone who finds himself off the trail on
  a mountain at night, with just a small flashlight and an average amount of
  nerve. I can't push the metaphor any further because the mountaineer only
  wants to find the trail again, whereas the scientist wants&mdash;well, what
  <i>does</i> he want? (You remember that argument with Julian Spee?) Anyhow,
  if he gets it, even the smallest fragment of it, then there comes a moment of
  sheer exhilaration comparable, I suppose, to what an artist feels when he
  knows he's done something good. Next comes the doubting period, the check and
  countercheck, and- -as often as not&mdash;the disappointment. It wasn't new
  after all. Or else it wasn't true. And the reason I'm writing all this is
  that today, I think for the first time, I've had that exhilaration without,
  so far, the disappointment. Of course that may come tomorrow. It's just a few
  lines of equations&mdash;a trifle, most people would think, to get so excited
  about. But if it stands up after all the tests it will get, especially from
  Framm, then I'm an inch or so into the unknown. That's all. I didn't feel
  like celebrating at first, but I went into the streets for a breath of fresh
  air, and the sight of all the people concerned with other
  things&mdash;chiefly politics, these days&mdash;made me feel aloof and rather
  pitying, until I realized how they'd pity me if they knew the hours I work
  and what sort of a life I have. So I turned into that little restaurant we
  had lunch at and drank a couple of beers. There happened to be a man there
  who likes chess, and we played till two A.M., which was about an hour ago,
  and that's the full extent of my celebration. Not very thrilling,
  perhaps?</p>

  <p>... Perhaps not, but I still think those beers had something to do with
  his sending me such a letter. He never wrote like that again, and
  incidentally, it was the only time he ever mentioned Framm.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later that year, 1937, our correspondence seemed to peter
out, probably my
  fault as much as his. I didn't try for my examination a second time, because
  I hankered more and more after a journalist's life; what I really wanted was
  to travel and write about what I saw, especially the political and economic
  side of things; but here again I was up against the curious obstacle of my
  name. As this is not my family's story, or even primarily my own, I can pass
  over the matter briefly. My father has acquired that basic unpopularity in
  public life which comes of personifying the wrong kind of myth for his age. A
  century ago he might have been held as a model for American boyhood; a
  century hence historians may give him his due, which won't be overwhelming,
  but may well be adjusted to the realization that he was no worse than others
  whose reputations now stand higher. I think he knows all this, and it makes
  him grateful for chance encounters on trains and park benches where people
  listen to what he says because they don't know who he is. He once called
  himself the Forgotten Man whom everybody remembers, and another time he said
  he hadn't only backed the wrong horse, he <i>was</i> the wrong horse. Anyhow,
  it's ironical that I got my first job from people who were anxious to please
  him, and was fired because the stuff I wrote didn't show any similar anxiety
  on my own part. Then I tried the people who weren't anxious to please him,
  but mostly they weren't anxious to please me either, because I was his
  daughter. However, I had money, so I traveled on my own, writing what I
  liked, sometimes getting it into print, mostly not. I suppose I was too young
  even to expect to free-lance successfully, but I didn't feel I was; one never
  does, at the time, though since then I have thought there was a certain
  impertinence in a girl barely twenty bombarding editors with articles about
  the state of the world. I did, however, discover by experience that my
  reporting was preferred to my opinions, so I wisely concentrated on the
  former, and tried to be where reportable events were happening. This was the
  main reason I arrived in Vienna in the early part of 1938. The political
  kettle there was coming to the boil, and all the signs were that Hitler would
  make <i>Anschluss</i> with Austria the first big test of his rising
  power.</p>

  <p>I wrote to Brad ahead of my arrival, announcing it and giving details.
  Because the weather was unsuitable for flying I traveled from Paris by train
  through the Arlberg. I thought it just barely possible he might be on the
  platform at the West Station to meet me, and when I couldn't see him I had a
  cup of coffee at the station restaurant in case he came late and would look
  for me. While I was there, with my small suitcase and a portable typewriter
  on the floor near by, I noticed that a young woman was eying them, as I
  thought, suspiciously. Then she came over and asked me, in quite good
  English, if I were Miss Waring.</p>

  <p>That name has so often heralded me badly into fresh company and new
  places, I've almost developed a suppression complex about it.</p>

  <p>I answered rather rudely: "What do you want to know for?"</p>

  <p>She said: "I'm Mrs. Bradley. He sent me here to meet you."</p>

  <p>I pulled the luggage aside and made her sit down and ordered more coffee,
  all to gain time while I came to terms with any emotion in me that would
  follow the shock. It didn't prove to be too much, or at any rate whatever it
  was surrendered to discipline. But the shock lingered; I kept looking at her,
  trying to make my glance less scrutinizing; in the end I decided to be frank.
  I said: "You must excuse me for staring&mdash;I've known Brad off and on for
  several years&mdash;I always hoped he'd marry someone nice, and already I'm
  thinking he has."</p>

  <p>She smiled a quiet, composed smile, as if she liked the compliment, but
  was not going to be overwhelmed by it. No doubt she was just as curious about
  me, as any wife is about her husband's pre-marital girl-friends, but I was
  slightly piqued that she was able to conceal it so well; I envied her the
  achievement, knowing how incapable I was of matching it. She was attractive,
  and the more so after you decided she was; you could then evaluate her good
  features, dark timid-looking eyes, clear complexion, and exceptionally small
  and beautiful hands.</p>

  <p>I reached for one of them and pressed it. She kept on smiling. Then,
  because I felt my emotion again needed disciplining, I flagged the waiter.
  "Let's go ... and while we're in the cab, tell me about him. How <i>is</i>
  he? I suppose he was too busy to come himself, so he sent you.... I'm
  glad&mdash;it was a lovely surprise.... I'm so happy about it ... but
  <i>tell</i> me about him...."</p>

  <p>"He's ill," she said, as we left the table. "That's why he sent me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Ill</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing serious&mdash;just a high temperature. I thought he ought not
  to go out."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Quite right. And you mustn't let me bother him, if you think I
  oughtn't.... Perhaps it would be better if I saw him in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"No. He sent me. He expects you."</p>

  <p>There was something both dutiful and inexorable in that.</p>

  <p>During the taxi journey we discussed Vienna and general affairs, and
  probably I began talking as freely as I might have done in London or New
  York, for she interrupted: "It is best not to talk politics outside."</p>

  <p>"<i>Outside</i>?" There was no one who could have heard except possibly
  the taxi driver.</p>

  <p>"It is better to be careful," she answered. "Especially when you mention
  names."</p>

  <p>We drove along the boulevards and even though I had seen so little of the
  city on my first visit I had an impression of deterioration. People looked
  tired, peevish, strained; there were many signs of poverty and unemployment.
  Soon I became aware that the taxi driver <i>was</i> listening, so I talked
  trivialities for the rest of the journey. When he pulled up at the address he
  carried my luggage across the pavement with almost excessive cordiality and
  gave a sketchy version of the Nazi salute.</p>

  <p>"Evidently he didn't understand English," I said when he had driven
  off.</p>

  <p>She answered judicially: "One cannot be sure. He may have."</p>

  <p>"Then why would he be so polite after what I said about Hitler?"</p>

  <p>"He would know you are foreign and that might make him wish to be polite
  so that you could go back to your country and say the Nazis are all right in
  Austria because the taximen are so polite. Like the trains in Italy that run
  on time. So many foreigners are impressed by things like that. But of course
  I know you are too sensible. You will soon get underneath the surface of
  things, and then you will realize how careful one has to be."</p>

  <p>I think I did realize that, fairly soon, but it led me into a
  misunderstanding about Pauli that wasn't cleared up until she, being careful
  herself, trusted me sufficiently.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">No doubt he was bound to look a little different. He was
sitting in an
  armchair under a reading lamp, and that gave him a look of thinness and
  pallor that wasn't real. He seemed quite genuinely pleased to see
  me&mdash;much more than when we had met a year earlier at that restaurant.
  But the brightness of his eyes was probably due to temperature, I told myself
  cautiously. I rallied him about being ill&mdash;I said I had always thought
  he enjoyed the sort of health that is called rude. He said yes, that was true
  in the main, and he had been perfectly well till a couple of days ago, when
  he had caught a chill. His temperature had been at one time as high as a
  hundred and three, but was now down to ninety-nine point five, which showed
  that he was almost better.</p>

  <p>While we talked, just chatting about this and that, Pauli moved about the
  small apartment with the quiet efficiency I was beginning to expect in all
  that she did. Presently there was a meal on the table, nicely served and well
  cooked. Yet it didn't give an impression of being specially achieved for my
  benefit. I noticed too that everything was neat and homelike and spotlessly
  clean, though there were no elegancies and nothing that showed any sign of
  money to spare. It was not a place one would have chosen to live in, however
  austerely, if one could have afforded something a bit better. Every city has
  its prevalent smell, and this apartment had the Vienna smell at full
  strength&mdash; a mixture of coffee, bread baking, paprika, and drains. There
  was nothing anyone could do except to learn to tolerate it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Brad said, when Pauli was in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"She's lovely," I answered. "I think you're very fortunate."</p>

  <p>"You bet I am.... She's quite a scientist, too&mdash;used to work in the
  laboratory with me&mdash;that's how we met. She also taught me German. I
  taught her English. We have a rule that we speak nothing but English and
  German every other day, but today we broke it&mdash;in your honor."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have. I can speak German fairly well too."</p>

  <p>"How fortunate," said Pauli, coming into the room with a plate of
  pastries. "It will enable you to study the political situation, which is what
  I understand you have come here for." (I suppose Brad had shown her my
  letter.)</p>

  <p>Brad yawned. "That's a signal for me to go to bed. <i>Politics.</i>
  Vienna's leading industry nowadays. Where I come from they have a big dose
  every four years, but here it keeps on all the time.... Good night, Jane.
  You'll get all the politics you want from Pauli."</p>

  <p>He called me Jane so easily now. And he had also said "where I come from"
  as if I weren't American also.</p>

  <p>Pauli said she thought it best for him to go to bed early, because of his
  temperature. I said I wouldn't stay long myself, but she begged me not to
  leave immediately. "All right," I agreed, "provided we skip politics. I'd
  much rather talk about you ... and Brad."</p>

  <p>"So would I," she answered, smiling that same composed smile. "So you call
  him Brad?... <i>I</i> call him Mark."</p>

  <p>"Sounds reasonable. His name <i>is</i> Mark." And then, for no reason I
  could think of, I added: "It was my mother who started calling him Brad."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes? ... He was once in love with her, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Was</i> he?"</p>

  <p>"He told me so. I think it is lucky when the first woman a young man falls
  in love with is someone very charming and much older than himself whom he
  knows he cannot marry because she is already quite happily married."</p>

  <p>Well, I thought, if that's what he told you, or how you look at it,
  fine.</p>

  <p>She went on, still smiling: "So you see I am not a bit jealous. Mark and I
  are very happy."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you are."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me she was laying a foundation on which we could be friendly,
  and that the only difference in our attitudes was that I was prepared to be
  friendly without any foundation at all.</p>

  <p>I said: "Brad told me you worked with him in the laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, but <i>for</i> him, not <i>with</i> him." A sort of proud
  humility in that. "He is going to be a very great scientist, did you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Scientist or mathematician, which is it?"</p>

  <p>"The one includes the other, in his case. Of course the work he does is
  far beyond me now, but it is still possible for me to save some of his time.
  I type out all his notes."</p>

  <p>"That must be a help. And incidentally, you speak excellent English, and
  you cook so beautifully...."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think so. You must come here as much as you can during your
  stay."</p>

  <p>"If Brad doesn't mind. He might. I was just a friend, that's all."</p>

  <p>"I know. He doesn't have any <i>close</i> friends. But you were the
  nearest to it."</p>

  <p>Had I been? It would have been more thrilling to learn it less
  retrospectively.</p>

  <p>She went on: "He used to take walks with you, he said. If you have time,
  when his chill is better, I wish you would do that with him here ... some
  Sunday. That is one of the things I cannot do, owing to a lack of strength."
  A slight accent and an occasional phrase like that were the only signs that
  her English was studied. Brad had done his job well.</p>

  <p>I told her I'd be very glad to, if Brad asked me.</p>

  <p>"I will suggest it," she answered, with that same touch of inexorableness
  matching the humility. "He needs the recreation. He works too hard. Far too
  hard."</p>

  <p>"Professor Framm must be a bit of a slave driver," I commented.</p>

  <p>"I would not say he is to blame," she replied, in a curiously guarded way.
  "It is Mark's own desire to work that drives him."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I agreed. "He always was like that."</p>

  <p>"But now he is more like that than ever. And if it goes on, I am afraid
  there will be a disaster." She then told me that since he had come to Vienna
  two years before he had had no time off except Sundays, and often even then
  he worked at home. "It is true of course that we could not afford a holiday,"
  she added, as if anxious to be fair.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't Framm pay enough?"</p>

  <p>But she wouldn't admit that either. "In Austria, unfortunately, there is
  very little money."</p>

  <p>"Nor is there anywhere&mdash;for anything educational. Even in America,
  which is supposed to be rich, teachers are the worst paid of all the
  professions."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but in America...." I have so often heard those words spoken by
  Europeans, and nearly always with the sentence unfinished. It is as if the
  words stopped short at the beginning of the dream.</p>

  <p>I left soon after that, telling her I'd use my influence, which wasn't
  much, and my walking capacity, which was considerable, to make Brad give
  himself a day in the fresh air. She took me to a corner where I could find a
  cab. There was a parade passing the end of the street, with banners,
  uniforms, and scattered raucous shouting. "This is a district where there is
  sometimes trouble," she said&mdash;not nervously, but with a certain
  watchfulness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He said he was too busy to take a full day off, but I had
him and Pauli to
  dinner at my hotel several times, and one Sunday, after I had called at his
  apartment after lunch, he and I took a tram to the center of the city and
  walked in the Burggarten. There seemed little reason why Pauli should not
  have come with us, but she said she had his notes to type and that was that.
  She was the sort of person who makes up her mind, and I wondered whether she
  had at some exact moment made up her mind to marry Brad. That she loved him
  and would devote herself to him was obvious, but whether in all things he
  liked to be managed quite so efficiently I also wondered.</p>

  <p>There had been rioting in the streets that morning, with many casualties
  and arrests, yet the open-air orchestra in the Burggarten was playing the
  overture to <i>Egmont</i> according to advertised schedule, and a throng of
  all ages and classes listened intently. The music seemed to make a little
  island of truce in the ocean of political turbulence; one did not feel that
  listeners were indifferent to the political issue, but&mdash;much more
  wonderfully&mdash;that for an hour or so they were putting it aside. I was
  impressed by students who followed the score from large folios, and by the
  shocked glances turned on someone who struck a match. All this could not have
  happened in Hyde Park or in Central Park, I thought, but neither could the
  marchings and countermarchings in which many of these listeners would take
  part when the truce was over. There was something both frantic and pitiable
  about the whole Viennese situation, and as we moved away from the crowd when
  the overture ended I gave Brad a cue to talk about it.</p>

  <p>But he had little to say. Politics was not in his line. He had a typical
  American phobia for foreign issues; his view of Europe as a group of
  squabbling states with no Washington (the city, not the man) had that large
  simplicity that was, at root, pure Dakota&mdash;a rationalization of the
  farmer's exasperation with distant city-bred troubles. But in addition to
  that, he had taken refuge in the scientist's ivory tower, much higher and
  less accessible than artists had ever had. He said he did not like the Nazis
  any more than I did, but he thought the basic idea of <i>Anschluss</i> was
  sound economically, except that it was far too fragmentary&mdash;there should
  really be an <i>Anschluss</i> of all western Europe, though not under German
  dictatorship. Such a large concept was doubtless impractical, but that, after
  all, was the fault of the politicians who made it so and of the peoples who
  elected the politicians. As far as Vienna was concerned, he hoped that the
  Nazis would not come into power, but if they did, he hoped they would stop
  the disorders in the city; that at least would confer a benefit. "Anyhow," he
  ended, "I'm not a politician. I don't pretend to know much about the various
  methods of hood- winking the electorate."</p>

  <p>"And to you it's all nothing more than that?"</p>

  <p>He smiled as if my seriousness required a concession. "Perhaps it's a bit
  in my bones to feel that way. I had an uncle I was very fond of as a child
  because he was a bit of an amateur geologist and I used to think he knew
  everything. As I was at the age when I wanted to know everything too, I asked
  him once what had formed North Dakota&mdash;I meant geologically. He answered
  'The Republican Party, because they wanted two extra seats in the Senate.' I
  puzzled a lot over that answer then, and politics still puzzles me. Whenever
  I hear a hot political argument I feel I'm eavesdropping in somebody else's
  world."</p>

  <p>"You once said the aim of science was to save the world. You can't do that
  if you don't know what to save it from."</p>

  <p>"From politics, maybe&mdash;or from itself." He laughed, then looked
  embarrassed. "Did I really say that about saving the world?"</p>

  <p>"You did. One night at the Hampstead house when Julian Spee came in after
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"'M, I remember. No wonder he asked me if I wouldn't feel better in a
  pulpit than a laboratory. But even he didn't go so far as to suggest a
  political career.... By the way, what happened to Julian?"</p>

  <p>"He's still doing quite well ... but I'd rather talk about what's happened
  to you. So you don't think any more that science could save the world?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean exactly."</p>

  <p>"Whatever <i>you</i> meant that night."</p>

  <p>"Probably I was thinking of mere technics."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh ... crop management, reforestation, sanitation, health and welfare ...
  that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing very mere about it."</p>

  <p>"True&mdash;and I expect there <i>are</i> a hundred men in the world
  today&mdash; most of them names one hasn't heard of&mdash;who could blueprint
  a paradise on earth and organize it into existence ... provided everyone else
  would take orders from them for a few generations. But what chance is there
  of that?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a good idea."</p>

  <p>"It would be, until the politicians got hold of it. Then you'd see some
  changes made. Where would <i>they</i> be without the vested interests that
  make and duplicate their own jobs?"</p>

  <p>"So you'd require science to stage a world-wide revolution as a first
  step?"</p>

  <p>"That's a big order too. There's supposed to be a science of revolution,
  but I never heard of any scientist who was interested in it&mdash;only the
  politicians, for their own ends. Where are we, then, after all this argument?
  We agree that the world needs saving, and that's as far as we get."</p>

  <p>"We also agree that the world could save itself by letting scientists save
  it if they <i>would</i> save it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the world doesn't want to save itself. It often behaves as if it
  didn't. Anyhow, until it makes up its mind, science has enough to do to
  follow its own natural aim&mdash;which is to discover truth simply because it
  <i>is</i> truth."</p>

  <p>"Curiosity, Julian called it."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;to an outsider it might look like that."</p>

  <p>"And I love that word 'outsider.' It fits in perfectly with the ivory
  tower."</p>

  <p>"If you knew us better you wouldn't think so badly of us."</p>

  <p>"You put yourselves on a pedestal."</p>

  <p>"If we do, it only makes us a better target. The politicians all hate us.
  They're also a bit afraid of what we might do someday&mdash;so they label as
  well as libel us whenever they can. Bolshevik science, Germanic science,
  Jewish science- -you hear plenty of that sort of nonsense nowadays in
  Vienna."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your work."</p>

  <p>"You mean my own work&mdash;at Framm's laboratory?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Or is it private?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not&mdash;nothing's private. But I think you'd find it a bit
  dull if I went into details. To put it vaguely, we're trying to find what the
  world's really made of&mdash;what makes it go...."</p>

  <p>"And where it's going?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all included."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's silly to ask if you've had any luck yet."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "We've got a few ideas, but they can't be expressed outside the
  language of mathematics."</p>

  <p>"I see. Not much good to the man in the street."</p>

  <p>"None at all. I know that sounds superior, but I can't help it. From an
  everyday standpoint it certainly isn't of any immediate practical
  importance."</p>

  <p>"You say 'we.' Do you mean yourself and Framm?"</p>

  <p>"Well no, that would be flattering myself&mdash;<i>yet</i>. I should have
  said <i>they</i>&mdash;meaning a few investigators scattered about the world
  who don't think a century or so's too far to look ahead. They keep in touch.
  They exchange results through articles in scientific journals. They don't
  bother about frontiers or nationalities. Even wars don't interrupt them.
  During the last war, for instance, Einstein put out his general theory, and
  certain proofs of it required astronomical observations that could only be
  made on a certain date from a certain place in the Atlantic Ocean. British
  scientists wanted to make these observations, and I've been told that the
  German Navy was contacted and agreed not to torpedo the ship. As it happened,
  the war was over before the specified date, but the idea of pure science as
  something above and beyond ordinary affairs had survived a pretty good
  test.... Of course the whole thing had to be kept dark. Neither the British
  nor the German public in wartime could have endured the thought of anything
  international quietly going about its business as if all the nonsense weren't
  happening."</p>

  <p>"Do you and Framm work together?"</p>

  <p>"We have our separate angles of research, but they overlap somewhat the
  further one gets."</p>

  <p>"And your own angle ... is it coming along well?"</p>

  <p>His voice became slightly excited. "Yes, I'd say it is. That's why I've
  been working my head off lately. I'm beginning to feel I'm
  <i>near</i>something.... Remember that letter I once wrote you? Well, it's
  like that again, only the whole thing's bigger. Perhaps soon I'll be ready to
  publish something. Of course it won't make any headlines."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it will make one person very happy."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;me?"</p>

  <p>"Actually it was Pauli I was thinking of."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure&mdash;and she'll deserve it after the way I've been neglecting
  her lately. We could take a holiday somewhere&mdash;go on a real spree. You
  might not think it, but she can be very gay at times."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for telling me she's human."</p>

  <p>"And I'm not&mdash;is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"No, I think you're <i>very</i> human, but you sometimes don't like people
  to know it.... Why didn't you write to me about your marriage?"</p>

  <p>He thought a moment, then said: "I'm wondering why myself. Maybe it was
  because of a talk your mother and I once had&mdash;that time she came to tea
  at my lab. I was so emphatic in saying I'd never marry, so I suppose I
  thought it would make me out a fool when I did ... though she's probably
  forgotten the whole thing long ago.... Where is she, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"In New York."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't come to England for the summers any more?"</p>

  <p>"She didn't last year and she probably won't this year."</p>

  <p>"What's happened to the house at Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>"The painter died and the place was sold. My father didn't know till too
  late, or he'd have bought it."</p>

  <p>"Is he in New York too?"</p>

  <p>"I think he's in Paris at present. We don't keep exact track of each
  other's movements."</p>

  <p>We walked on, through the park to the boulevards. One could feel the rise
  of tension like a physical change in the atmosphere, and on the tram there
  was some sort of row in progress that we couldn't exactly diagnose&mdash;at
  one moment it sounded political, then it turned domestic and seemed to be
  concerned with the rival relationships of two women and a man. It went on,
  intermittently, till we got out, by which time it was political again; and I
  suppose many rows were like that, personal animosities fanned by and fanning
  a rising flame.</p>

  <p>Pauli had finished typing when we reached the apartment. Brad seemed
  anxious to go over what she had done; he gathered up the script and went into
  the bedroom to be alone. Pauli then made coffee and talked. She was genuinely
  pleased that I had been able to persuade Brad to take even a few hours'
  recreation, and I felt she had at last decided I was really a friend and to
  be trusted. We discussed the crowds in the park and the incident on the tram.
  Till then I had assumed, doubtless because she was always urging me to be
  "careful," that she was nothing but that herself&mdash;and especially careful
  to avoid taking sides. I did not blame her, though I had made no secret of my
  own feelings. But now she told me how warmly and bitterly she shared them. It
  surprised me; I had not suspected such partisanship, and I was even more
  surprised at the effort she must have made to avoid disclosing it before.
  "One has to be careful," she said again. "It was not that I did not think you
  were sincere. But you are American&mdash;you are so used to saying anything
  you like&mdash;anywhere&mdash;as you did in the taxi when we first met. I
  have waited till you learned a little."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you think I have, but really, I was always able to keep a
  secret&mdash;even in America."</p>

  <p>"In America surely there can be no secrets like ours."</p>

  <p>"Not quite like yours. But we have our own."</p>

  <p>"At least there can be no work for the <i>agent provocateur</i>." She
  looked all at once conspiratorial, with a darting glance to the doorway as if
  to confirm that the handle wasn't being slowly turned; and I reflected then,
  as I have often done, how in moments of complete sincerity yet of rather
  unusual tension, so many people adopt the attitudes and gestures they have
  seen on the stage. The phrase <i>agent provocateur</i> seemed to have touched
  off a series of them; presently she became once more her normal
  undemonstrative self. "We live in peculiar times," she said, with apologetic
  triteness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

  <p>"How is your study of the situation progressing?"</p>

  <p>"It's not exactly a study. I'm just looking round and sizing things
  up."</p>

  <p>"And writing articles for American newspapers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a few. They don't always take them."</p>

  <p>"I read one. I thought it very good."</p>

  <p>This startled me because she couldn't possibly have seen any in print; she
  added, perhaps interpreting my look: "It was one evening we dined at your
  hotel and I went up to your room afterwards. There was a piece of typing in
  your machine and I could not help seeing it was an article for a
  newspaper."</p>

  <p>True, and I could imagine myself doing the same thing in somebody else's
  room, only I doubt if I would have admitted it afterwards. Perhaps this also
  she read in my face, for she went on: "I wanted to tell you.... I wanted to
  tell you how much I liked it ... and also to warn you not to leave things
  like that where anyone going into your room can read them.... But I did not
  know you well enough then."</p>

  <p>"Well, you do now, thank goodness&mdash;and as for leaving papers about,
  I'm careful not to do it any more."</p>

  <p>"You are wise. Though of course it will be known what you have written.
  The Nazis soon learn who their friends are."</p>

  <p>"But we don't always learn who the Nazis are."</p>

  <p>She gave me a shrewd glance. "I think you understand things very well. It
  is a state of mind, to begin with. Even in the educational and scientific
  world you meet with it." She waited a moment, then said: "Professor Framm,
  for instance."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Is he one of them? Secretly, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I think today he does not mind so much if people suspect it."</p>

  <p>"Does Brad know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. But he says they never discuss politics."</p>

  <p>"So they get along?"</p>

  <p>"I would not say they are friends. But doubtless they respect each
  other&mdash; as scientists."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that would be enough for me. Or for you either."</p>

  <p>"That is so.... And I am worried about the position Mark is in. It becomes
  more difficult every day. There have already been riots in the university.
  The students are divided, so are the professors. It is a grave problem."</p>

  <p>"What do you think he should do?"</p>

  <p>"That is hard to say. I am so much against the Nazis myself&mdash;I have
  reasons that Mark does not have. If there were some other job, in another
  country ... but that, I know, is not easy to find."</p>

  <p>"You worked for Framm yourself, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Formerly." I waited for her to say more, and presently it came in a
  little rush of words through tightened lips. "He does not like me. He showed
  that when Mark and I were married."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"We had been hoping I might keep the job, so that with the two salaries
  there might have been more comfort."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>Though sympathetic, I could not help discounting a little after this
  confession, with its mixture of frankness and inconsistency, and its reminder
  of what I had seen on the tram&mdash;the personal and the political
  intermixed, each one inflaming the other. She added, clinchingly: "Well, it
  is good that you should know all this, then I do not have to mention him
  again."</p>

  <p>The more I saw of Pauli the more I liked her, though the more she told me
  about herself the less I felt she gave me her complete confidence. It was a
  curious progress into intimacy&mdash;she letting me see into her life a
  little, I realizing with each new view how much more there was than I had
  previously suspected.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The following week I went to Prague. It was the first time
I had been in
  Czechoslovakia, and after Austria it was a nerve tonic. The Czechs were
  prosperous and cheerful; Hider was unpopular among them, but it was still
  possible to believe in the Czech Army and the Czech Maginot Line and to have
  confidence in the future. Events, however, provided a fascinating though
  ominous drama across the border, for at such a distance the Austrian dilemma
  was in sharpest focus&mdash;less huge and blurred than in Vienna itself, yet
  arresting and of spectacular importance. There could not have been a better
  grandstand for an objective view of the European crisis, and as I was staying
  at the house of politically-minded people the days passed in a flurry of
  discussion, newspaper snatching, and radio dialing. Something would happen
  soon; rumors started that the Luftwaffe was already poised at Munich, waiting
  for the word; some said that if Austria resisted she would have the support
  of both France and Italy. I wrote a few articles for American papers, and for
  the first time in my life an editor cabled his acceptance and asked for
  more.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, at a pavement cafe, I picked up a paper that someone had
  left on the table. Every journalist has a technical interest in newspapers,
  even in a language he doesn't read; he likes to see the format, to judge how
  modern or antiquated the plant must be, and so on. My own Czech was limited
  to a few phrases; I could just make out the general sense of the headlines,
  which told of nothing particularly new that day. But on an inside page I
  caught a word that leapt to the eye as if it had been printed in red
  ink&mdash;the word <i>Framm</i>, embedded in a half-column of small type
  date-lined Berlin. I could not make anything else of it, so I took the paper
  to my friends and had them translate. Even for them it was not easy, for it
  appeared to be the report of a lecture delivered by Framm to some scientific
  group in Berlin&mdash;highly abstruse, but apparently of news value. Framm, I
  gathered, had done something to correlate a theory of electromagnetism with
  some other theory&mdash;an achievement which his Berlin audience had received
  with all the greater acclaim because of its Viennese origin. It demonstrated,
  one was asked to believe, the essential and triumphant unity of pan-Germanic
  science.</p>

  <p>My friends were cynical enough to suggest that Framm was giving himself a
  sweet piece of publicity. They were unqualified to assess the value of his
  discovery, but of its timeliness there could be no doubt; for if Hitler
  should take over Austria there would be scientific plums as well as other
  kinds to be distributed among the faithful. My Czech friends, like Pauli and
  Julian, were clearly of the opinion that scientists did not live for science
  alone.</p>

  <p>That evening I had a wire from Pauli. It asked me to return to Vienna, if
  I could possibly manage it, and she would meet me at the station. I felt a
  sudden aversion to mysteries, suspense, speculation of all kinds, so I wired
  back "Will come if necessary but what is wrong? Is anyone ill?"&mdash;which
  may not have been too courteous, but expressed some of the irritation I felt.
  I didn't want to leave Prague; I only realized then how refreshing it was as
  an antidote. Back after a few hours came the answer: "No illness but please
  come it is very important." So I left the next day, fully prepared for a
  small tiff with her if the reason for summoning me were not adequate. I
  couldn't think of anything but illness that would be.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She was a little distraught when we met. She rushed up to
me amongst the
  crowd leaving the train and dragged me aside to assure me that Brad wasn't
  ill.</p>

  <p>I said: "Of course not&mdash;you told me in your wire that nobody was
  ill."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you might think I had said that just to reassure you."</p>

  <p>That was too subtle for me. I said: "No, I believed you. Illness isn't a
  thing to fool people about&mdash;one way or the other."</p>

  <p>She said: "I am sorry. You are yourself so direct. It is much worse than
  his being ill, anyhow. Unless he were <i>seriously</i> ill."</p>

  <p>"Just tell me what's the matter." I took her arm as we crossed the
  concourse; she did not make for the cab rank, but turned into a small
  restaurant. It was fairly empty and there was a table in an alcove that
  offered privacy. I ordered coffee, and put my hand across the table as I had
  done once before to touch hers. It was cold but quite steady; the
  distraughtness was in her eyes. They roved over the restaurant as if
  apprehensive of who might be within seeing or hearing distance; then they
  searched the coffee cups for specks of dirt. She wiped them with a paper
  napkin before pouring. "I did not do this when we first met," she said,
  "because I thought you would consider it not good manners. But it is a fact
  that they are not very careful in these places."</p>

  <p>I said: "Now, please, what <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

  <p>She watched the waiter back to his counter, then produced a folded
  newspaper from her handbag. It was a Vienna paper of the previous day; she
  passed it to me with her finger marking one of the pages. After a few seconds
  I could see that it was just the Framm news over again, in German instead of
  Czech and dressed up with a local personality angle.</p>

  <p>I said: "Yes, I happened to see this in Prague."</p>

  <p>"There also?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's news, I suppose. I don't know how important it is, but Framm
  certainly seems to have done himself no harm by bringing it out just
  now."</p>

  <p>Her lips tightened. "So you think it is just ... a <i>stunt</i>?" She
  often used words like that, with great deliberation and as if they were bound
  to effect some miraculous conveyance of ideas between an Austrian and an
  American.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps hardly that. There doesn't seem anything catchpenny about it ...
  like a cancer cure or a new rejuvenation technique&mdash;that's the sort of
  stuff to make the headlines. Electromagnetism is for scientists.... What does
  Brad say about it?"</p>

  <p>"That is just the point." She tried hard to be calm. "Because ... because
  ... it is his own discovery ... <i>Mark's</i> ... and Hugo Framm has stolen
  it." This took a little time to take in, and meanwhile she had to go on
  saying the hated word. "Do you not understand? Hugo Framm has <i>stolen</i>
  it. It is Mark's work, not Framm's at all."</p>

  <p>"That's a pretty serious accusation," I said at length. "How would you
  prove it?"</p>

  <p>"I have hundreds of proofs. Pages and pages of Mark's notes. I have been
  copying them out for him every night when he came home from the
  laboratory&mdash; every night for months. And I know his work enough to
  recognize that all the conclusions are the same ... Mark was only waiting for
  some final tests before assembling the whole material into a thesis." She
  tried to give me technical details, but they weren't comprehensible; she
  could only assure me that the theft was flagrant, and one thing I was
  convinced of, her sincerity. My silence made her exclaim: "You do not think I
  speak the truth? You think it is impossible?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. It just takes my breath away&mdash;the idea of Brad doing
  all the work and Framm getting all the credit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no.... Because I am not going to let that happen. Something must be
  done to upset this. Something <i>will</i> be done. Do you think I would stand
  by and see my husband cheated?"</p>

  <p>Her face then, lit by passion, seemed almost that of another person. She
  was even speaking loudly enough to be overheard, if anyone else in the cafe
  were acutely listening. The "carefulness" had been like a mask, suddenly
  dropped, or perhaps like a habit, momentarily forgotten.</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell me what Brad said. You can't do much on your own."</p>

  <p>"I know. That is why I sent for you. Because you are of his nationality
  and would understand perhaps better how to talk to him."</p>

  <p>"You mean he doesn't even know about it yet? You haven't told him?"</p>

  <p>"He knows. He saw it in the paper himself. But he refuses to do
  anything.... That is the trouble. That is what you have to talk to him
  about.... I shall go back now&mdash;alone. You visit us later, then I can
  tell you all this again, in front of him, and you can say how much it shocks
  you." She stared at me hard. "But perhaps you are not so shocked?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. It's a scandalous thing that a man's work should
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it does not surprise you that he refuses to do anything? Perhaps you
  understand him better than I?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly."</p>

  <p>"You have known him longer."</p>

  <p>"But not so intimately ... ever.... And I <i>am</i> surprised, except that
  I'm not surprised to be surprised, if you know what I mean...."</p>

  <p>"<i>Intimately</i>?" she repeated. I could see she was thinking of a
  specific meaning of the word. But that was equally true, and what I had
  partly meant, and it certainly gave her the edge, if she needed one. There
  was a deep, friendly, and highly intelligent jealousy between us, something
  both of us recognized, concealed, and refused to waste time in worrying
  about. It had its own queer limits too; she did not, for instance, in the
  least object to my walking with Brad in the Burggarten while she stayed at
  home to do his typing. But once, when she had seen me using my own portable,
  she had said, almost cattishly: "Only two fingers? That would not do for me.
  It is necessary for me to be quite expert when I work for Mark."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was towards ten o'clock when I reached the apartment,
and what happened
  was much simpler than Pauli had planned. I told Brad I had seen in the Prague
  paper a report of Framm's lecture, and this was to have been Pauli's cue, but
  Brad picked it up quicker. "You've touched on a tender spot," he said,
  suddenly reaching for his hat and overcoat. "Pauli and I have just had our
  first quarrel about it.... Tell her if you want, Pauli&mdash;I'm going round
  the corner for a glass of beer."</p>

  <p>And he stalked out, leaving us to a conversation that was not part of our
  program.</p>

  <p>"It is unlike him to do that," Pauli said anxiously.</p>

  <p>I said a few drinks might not be a bad thing, they might loosen him up and
  we could then hammer the whole thing out with fewer inhibitions. I asked if
  there had really been a quarrel and she replied: "Of course not. I told him
  what he must do and he said he could not do it, that was all." But that, I
  reflected, might well be his idea of a quarrel, even if not hers.</p>

  <p>He came back about midnight, looking relaxed, good-humored, almost jaunty.
  Perhaps the beer had done this, though there was certainly no sign that he
  had drunk too much. He said he had found someone to play chess with, and had
  won the game. I asked if it was the same man he had played with that night he
  wrote me the long letter about science, and he answered: "No. I don't know
  his name and he didn't ask mine. That's the good thing about chess. You just
  play it with anyone who can."</p>

  <p>I had suggested to Pauli that she leave us alone to talk things over, and
  this she now did, though rather reluctantly. As soon as I heard her busying
  herself in the kitchen I said: "Well now, Brad, what's it all about?"</p>

  <p>"Our little quarrel? Didn't she tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes ... and is she right, that's what I want to know. Did Framm steal
  your stuff?"</p>

  <p>He smiled, as to a child who has asked something uncomfortably na&iuml;ve. "I
  like simple words, Jane, but when they're too simple they don't always
  help.... You talk about somebody stealing my stuff. <i>What</i> stuff? A few
  pages of algebra&mdash;how can such a thing be <i>my</i> stuff&mdash;or
  anybody's stuff? So what do you mean by <i>stealing</i>? Mathematicians don't
  take out patents. We don't have copyrights, trademarks, Good Housekeeping
  seals of approval.... And besides, Pauli's prejudiced&mdash;she hates Framm.
  Well, that's all right&mdash;I don't blame her. But it's no reason why I
  should accept her viewpoint in everything. She has a great sense of
  possession&mdash;most women have. To her the whole thing's just as if I'd
  left an umbrella on the tram and someone had run off with it."</p>

  <p>All of which impressed me only until I realized how completely it evaded
  the issue. I answered: "Brad ... will you answer me this question ...
  honestly ... how much of Framm's discovery covers the same ground as your own
  work?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a great deal. It actually confirms my work. That's fine. To have a
  scientist of Framm's eminence state with confidence something which you
  yourself have postulated only tentatively&mdash;it's a great encouragement if
  you look at it the right way."</p>

  <p>"Are you being sarcastic?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you understood me better than that."</p>

  <p>"I don't. Or rather, I don't know whether I do or not. But I think I
  understand Framm a little, even though I've only met him once. He's ambitious
  and unscrupulous and I'd say he's quite capable of grabbing anybody else's
  work to bolster his reputation&mdash;to cut a dash in Berlin so that if
  events move the Nazi way he'll get a big job."</p>

  <p>"Might be. As a politician he's probably the worst shyster in the
  world&mdash; it's only as a scientist that I can guarantee him."</p>

  <p>"How about him as a man&mdash;a man of honor?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't any idea. We don't cover that territory."</p>

  <p>"You mean you're indifferent? Don't you really <i>mind</i> what he's done?
  You don't think any less of him for it? It's what you were willing to have
  happen? You feel you can go on working with him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One question at a time," he interrupted, "or I won't remember them. To
  begin with, you're making all this far too personal. It isn't a question of
  whether I like Framm less or more or even at all. As I told you once he's the
  kind of man you don't have to like&mdash;not when you work with him
  professionally. And if you ask me whether I'm willing for him to use my work,
  then that's an easy one&mdash;of course I am. Any scientist can use my work.
  And I can use his. We take that for granted.... Don't look so indignant. Your
  slant's a bit better than Pauli's, but it still makes everything too simple.
  From pinching an umbrella we've progressed to quoting from a copyrighted
  author without proper permission ... am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Brad, if you were in this mood with Pauli I don't wonder she quarreled
  with you. What I'm trying to get at, and what you've evaded so far, is
  whether Framm did anything which in your own world, amongst scientists who
  knew all the facts, would be considered unethical. I can't answer that
  question&mdash;maybe Pauli can't&mdash;but you can. And so far you haven't.
  Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose I said because it's nobody else's damned business."</p>

  <p>"All right. That's a straight answer and it leaves me nothing else to say.
  I'll go now ... let me know when you're next free for a walk."</p>

  <p>He answered with sudden cordiality: "Any time&mdash;tomorrow if you like,
  provided we don't get onto arguments like this."</p>

  <p>I went to the kitchen and whispered to Pauli that I hadn't had any luck in
  influencing him, maybe it would be better to try again some other time when
  we'd both had a chance to think things over. "I've a feeling if I stay I
  shall mess things up. It's late, anyhow, and I'm tired."</p>

  <p>So I said good-night. Brad came downstairs and accompanied me along the
  street to the corner where I usually found a taxi. There were still crowds
  everywhere; a Nazi rally had just broken up and the participants, inflamed
  with oratory, were drifting belligerently home. As we passed a cafe that was
  open late, Brad suggested going in for a drink.</p>

  <p>We found a table. The place was very hot, smoky, and noisy. "Is this where
  you played chess?" I asked, for something to say.</p>

  <p>"No, I've never been here before. It's pretty bad, isn't it? Do you
  mind?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, if you don't. But I'm not exactly in sympathy with these
  roisterers."</p>

  <p>"Neither am I. They're getting bolder&mdash;they're not afraid of being
  arrested nowadays.... We'll find somewhere else if you like."</p>

  <p>"No, there's not time. I'll have to go soon."</p>

  <p>We drank beer. A mechanical piano struck up to add to the racket. A girl
  began to sing shrilly.</p>

  <p>Brad said, contemplatively: "So you don't like my mood."</p>

  <p>"I don't, but as it isn't normal, I guess I can stand it. In some ways
  it's an improvement. You wouldn't normally ask me to drink beer with you at
  one in the morning, and never before have you said 'any time' when I've asked
  when you were free for a walk." He called for another beer. "And it's the
  first time, to my knowledge, that you've drunk so much."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean <i>so</i> much or <i>too</i> much?"</p>

  <p>"So much. You're not an alcoholic yet."</p>

  <p>"Five beers."</p>

  <p>"Good. You ought to do this oftener."</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to be here oftener with me."</p>

  <p>"That clinches it. You're <i>not</i> normal. I've never known you gallant
  before."</p>

  <p>He laughed. The surface badinage was working us both into a feeling of
  intimacy. "To tell you the truth, Jane, I got tired of arguing when I knew
  Pauli was listening from the kitchen all the time."</p>

  <p>"It's a small apartment."</p>

  <p>"I know. But she does have several attributes of the successful female
  spy. Among them a great loyalty to whoever or whatever it is that she
  serves."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>," I said.</p>

  <p>"I know. And I'm not really worth the kind of devotion she gives me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think she's wise to give it, anyway. She might come a cropper
  sometime."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't get as much out of me as she'd like. That's my fault. I don't
  think any woman would. I guess the truth is, my work comes first. But she
  knew that when she married me&mdash;she'd seen the way I work at the
  lab&mdash;she knew how it&mdash;<i>consumes</i> me."</p>

  <p>"She probably fancied herself as a reformer. Women do. And there are women
  who <i>could</i> reform you, I daresay."</p>

  <p>He stared at the table, and suddenly I knew he was thinking of my mother,
  and that he knew I was also. It made us both somehow uncomfortable, so that I
  went on with forced lightness: "Well, we were talking about your apartment. I
  still think it's small enough for her to have heard without listening."</p>

  <p>"And this place is noisy enough to listen without hearing. Wouldn't you
  really like to try somewhere else?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the noise is all right&mdash;especially if we're going to argue
  again."</p>

  <p>"But we're not. <i>I</i> won't, anyway. I don't like the feeling you're
  against me."</p>

  <p>"I'm not against you, Brad. But I'm against other people pushing you down
  and you pretending you accidentally fell.... Did Framm behave unscrupulously
  or not? It's a simple question if you choose to answer it."</p>

  <p>"Better not mention names here."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Let's call him <i>he. Did</i> he?"</p>

  <p>"Did he what?"</p>

  <p>"Did he do what you would have done in his place?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me quizzically for a moment, then said: "God, I wouldn't be
  in his place for anything."</p>

  <p>"That's evading the point again."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't. It's the real point...." He leaned forward across the table
  so that our faces were close; it was the only way he could drop his voice and
  still be heard. "You know what Pauli wants? She'd have me raise a stink, hire
  lawyers, start a fight about it. I won't do that. I wouldn't even if it were
  actionable, which I doubt."</p>

  <p>"I could get an opinion. I know a very good lawyer here."</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your time. I wouldn't fight. And I don't mind a bit if you
  call me a coward. Too many people have wasted time fighting just to be
  thought not a coward. Because in my own mind I've nothing to fight about. I
  was quite sincere when I said his lecture encouraged me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Encouraged</i> you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'd had just a slight doubt about a certain item in my chain of
  reasoning&mdash;it was beginning to keep me awake nights. His&mdash;his
  announcement cleared the matter up, because he wouldn't have made it if he
  hadn't been sure there wasn't a flaw."</p>

  <p>"You have that much faith in him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because ... because he's a much better scientist than I am&mdash;or ever
  will be. Sorry to keep on using that word&mdash;scientist, <i>scientist.</i>
  Most people think of them as romantic pioneers, or else plodders trying one
  thing after another till the miracle simply has to happen&mdash;like the
  Curies with radium.... Actually it's mostly plodding without the miracles and
  pioneering without the romance. Yet there <i>are</i>moments&mdash;moments
  that none of those words suit&mdash; moments when what's needed is the guess
  of sheer genius&mdash;the bull's-eye of a first-class mind operating with a
  flair. It's hard to explain, but there's almost poetry in it as well as logic
  and luck. I've seen <i>him</i> at such moments. He may be other things too,
  but he's a&mdash;here's that word again, I can't help it&mdash;he's a
  <i>scientist</i>."</p>

  <p>There wasn't much I could say to that. The beer had made him a little
  expansive. He went on: "Besides, the truth is, I'm not really ambitious in
  <i>his</i> way. All the fuss that was made over him in&mdash;in the place
  where he lectured&mdash;all that would just bore and bother me to distraction
  if I ever had to put up with it. And I certainly don't hanker after some big
  administrative job where I'd have to play politics. So everything he can
  possibly have deprived me of, he's welcome to."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you even have liked the slightest acknowledgment from him?"</p>

  <p>"That's another ambition of his I don't share&mdash;to sit pretty with
  the&mdash; those&mdash;" He checked himself in time. "Let's call them
  <i>them.</i> You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>I nodded and glanced round the cafe. "There seem to be plenty here."</p>

  <p>"Sure. It's too bad that science has to be interfered with by such
  arrogant nitwits. They've even closed down the laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Pauli told me."</p>

  <p>"Why are you smiling?"</p>

  <p>"Because you called them arrogant. They are, but you are too, whenever you
  use the word 'science.'"</p>

  <p>"Am I? I can only say that my own work makes me feel very humble."</p>

  <p>"That's only another form of arrogance. Mystics have it. Makes them pretty
  hard to get along with."</p>

  <p>"Then I can't be one ... and I don't think I'm a mystic anyhow. A bit
  monkish, if you like&mdash;perhaps scientists <i>are</i> the modern monks.
  They shut themselves up in their cells and let the nonsense go on
  outside&mdash;and they have a distant goal that makes them myopic about the
  foreground.... I remember your mother once asked me if I felt my work as a
  sort of priesthood&mdash;it startled me at the time, but now I think she
  might have been partly right."</p>

  <p>"She also mentioned a vow of celibacy."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Oh, count me out of that...."</p>

  <p>"Good."</p>

  <p>"You too, I should think?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Should</i> you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed again. "Well, I've sometimes wondered. You're attractive,
  intelligent, on your own, and you travel about the world meeting all kinds of
  interesting men.... What <i>can</i> I think?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly." We both laughed.</p>

  <p>He began to assemble the saucers that would show the amount of his bill.
  "This conversation's getting too personal. Shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, after one more question. Mind?"</p>

  <p>"I might. But go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Just this. You once told me that scientists are in constant touch through
  scientific journals&mdash;a sort of international freemasonry, quite small,
  but very elite. Now if <i>he</i> hadn't jumped the gun, wouldn't you have
  liked to see your work in one of these journals, with your own name on
  it?"</p>

  <p>He said quietly: "Yes, it would have given me pleasure. But honestly, not
  as much as to know that for the last two years I've been on the right track,
  not the wrong one."</p>

  <p>"But you'd have had that too."</p>

  <p>"I have it now, that's the main thing. That's why I'm
  celebrating&mdash;like this."</p>

  <p>"Brad, I don't believe you. I think you're quite a bit hurt by what's
  happened. Only you're tied to an ideal&mdash;you feel you oughtn't to care
  about credit, therefore you try to make yourself not care."</p>

  <p>"And if I succeed, then it's true that I don't care."</p>

  <p>"But that could make you a bundle of complexes and inhibitions."</p>

  <p>"Freudian stuff, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why so many scientists sneer at Freud."</p>

  <p>"We don't. All we have against him is that the field he opened up became
  an immediate playground for amateurs. I'm glad my own field doesn't offer the
  same attractions."</p>

  <p>"There's something chilly about your mind, Brad."</p>

  <p>That made him laugh again. "Only about my mind, though. Tonight I can
  almost understand why people like to shout and get drunk and beat their
  wives."</p>

  <p>"But to understand why people do things isn't the same as wanting to do
  them yourself."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope not. Would you like me to beat Pauli?"</p>

  <p>"Quarreling with her might be worse."</p>

  <p>"Listen ... get this straight about me and Pauli. She's a wonderful wife,
  I'm in love with her, and she has her own way nine times out of ten."</p>

  <p>"But this is the tenth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And more important than all the others?"</p>

  <p>"To me&mdash;naturally. Otherwise I'd have been delighted to give in as
  usual."</p>

  <p>"You'd rather fight Pauli than <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>"That's an unfair way of putting it and you're quite smart enough to know
  it is. I wouldn't mind fighting him at all if it were on ground where a fight
  would be in order. If he'd announced something I thought wrong, for
  instance&mdash; though I'd have been a bit hesitant to set my mind against
  his&mdash;still, I'd have done it, no matter how impolitic it might have
  been. I'm not that sort of coward."</p>

  <p>"But his discoveries don't happen to be wrong. They don't even happen to
  be his."</p>

  <p>"I told you before that in the sense I look at it, they're neither his nor
  mine, but the common property of anyone who can use them."</p>

  <p>"Holy ground, eh? Only strictly scientific fights permitted. If you want a
  private one, run home to your wife. You must be pretty hard to live with,
  Brad."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm easy. I have few vices and my virtues are decently hidden.
  Furthermore, I'm a very affectionate animal. So is Pauli. We get on pretty
  well. You don't have to worry about us."</p>

  <p>"I know. She's very happy with you&mdash;personally.... And by the way,
  I'm neutral."</p>

  <p>"In what?"</p>

  <p>"In anything you have arguments about with her."</p>

  <p>He had paid the bill and we were walking out of the cafe. He summoned a
  taxi that was already curving towards us. "I can see <i>your</i> side, Brad,
  and it's wonderful and superb, like the Matterhorn, but if I were Pauli I'd
  probably see her side better."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, you wouldn't. You'd still see mine," he said, timing it for the
  last word as he waved good-night.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I didn't meet or hear from him again for several days,
despite his
  expressed readiness to take a walk; but I did mention the matter to my lawyer
  friend, a brilliant young Austrian named Bauer, strongly anti-Nazi, whom I
  had met at a party and liked exceedingly.</p>

  <p>It was the political angle that interested him most, and he confirmed the
  likelihood that Framm was boosting himself in Berlin with an eye to a big job
  if and when the Nazis moved into Austria. "It's a smart thing to do, the way
  things look, and they certainly look worse every hour."</p>

  <p>I asked him what chance he thought Brad would have, supposing he were
  willing to begin any legal action.</p>

  <p>"Probably not much. To begin with, those documentary proofs you say exist-
  -the notes and so on&mdash;they're all abstrusely scientific, I
  suppose?&mdash;you couldn't explain their meaning to a court&mdash;you'd need
  expert evidence from other scientists even to interpret them. Well, where
  would you get such witnesses? Why should anyone back an unknown person
  against an influential big shot? And furthermore, even if you <i>could</i>
  show that Bradley's notes were more or less in line with the Berlin lecture,
  who's to say that your friend worked independently?"</p>

  <p>"Pauli could testify to that."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't count&mdash;she's his wife. She was also, I understand, a
  former employee of Hugo Framm till she was dismissed by him.... Not good, not
  good."</p>

  <p>"But it could be proved that Bradley left his notes lying around in a desk
  at the laboratory, where Framm could have had access to them."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Framm did the same and Bradley could have had similar access.
  What if Framm were to say that Bradley copied <i>his</i> notes?"</p>

  <p>"You mean he copied them with a view to bringing an action later? Isn't
  that farfetched?"</p>

  <p>"A jury might think it looked like blackmail."</p>

  <p>"<i>Blackmail</i>.... That's fantastic."</p>

  <p>"You understand, Miss Waring, the idea's purely hypothetical. I'm only
  trying to imagine what I might say if I were Framm or his counsel."</p>

  <p>"Of course. But it's still fantastic."</p>

  <p>"No more than the whole issue. That's the trouble. If it were plagiarism
  in a book or a play you could get the hang of it, but all this scientific
  stuff.... What's Bradley's salary, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly, but far less than it ought to be&mdash;which is
  another thing that might show a jury the kind of man Framm is."</p>

  <p>"It might also be used to show them the kind of man Bradley is. Framm
  could say: 'These are good wages for a mere laboratory assistant working
  under my supervision all the time....' And there's another thing.... The
  legal issue would narrow down to whether Bradley had any ownership claim on
  work done while he was a salaried worker for Framm, even if you could prove
  that Bradley did do everything on his own."</p>

  <p>"So you think it's all rather hopeless?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing's <i>quite</i> hopeless in a court of law. Sometimes a decision
  goes against all logic as well as evidence. Framm's a charmer&mdash;I've seen
  him in action&mdash;he has that kind of brilliant ruthlessness that makes him
  nearly irresistible&mdash;and yet, you never know&mdash;some people might
  side with David against Goliath. What's his type?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't got a type exactly. He's shy in manner and quite good-looking.
  Of course he hasn't the slightest intention of bringing an action. I told you
  I was merely asking out of curiosity."</p>

  <p>He said, just before I left his office: "The real dynamite in a thing like
  this would be political. Nobody cares about electromagnetism.... But if the
  case were even to be started it would do Framm harm, and that might be worth
  while from a number of angles.... Look, I'll take it on. I don't think we'll
  win, and unless we do win and get damages, it's understood there'll be no
  fee."</p>

  <p>I said I was positive Brad wouldn't bring any case.</p>

  <p>"Ask him again." Bauer's enthusiasm seemed to be rising as he contemplated
  the matter. "After all, what can he lose? Tell him my offer."</p>

  <p>I promised, and when I did tell Brad, the result was emphatically what I
  had expected. Brad said: "So I'm to provide a nice little <i>cause
  c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> for the politicians to smack their lips over? Tell your lawyer
  friend I've <i>everything</i> to lose&mdash;everything that I care about- -my
  time, my work, and my peace of mind. The only thing I haven't to lose is
  doubtless what he was thinking of ... <i>money</i>."</p>

  <p>"All right, but don't be sarcastic. He's not as different from you as
  you'd think. Why don't you let me arrange a meeting? You might even like him.
  You could use a few more friends in this town."</p>

  <p>"No, Jane, please keep him out of my affairs. And for heaven's sake don't
  tell Pauli you've found a free lawyer. It's the cost of the case I've been
  stressing to her."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's easier to explain than the other reasons I have."</p>

  <p>The international sky darkened, with Vienna as its storm center. The city
  throbbed with rumors and counter rumors, ranging from the dangerously
  plausible to the sheerly impossible, but behind the smoke screen one thing
  was clear: events were now too presaging to be gainsaid, either by wishful
  thinkers or by those whose adherences tied them long after the expiry of
  either wishing or thoughtfulness. I have been a witness of several upsets
  that could be called revolutions, and one thing that strikes me as an almost
  clinical sign of approaching crisis is the way it is smelled ahead by those
  who have never been extreme enough to make a change of views difficult, or
  important enough to have such a change suspected. Perhaps the bulk of people
  go this way and that, not so much aiming to be with the tide as to avoid any
  feeling that it exists.</p>

  <p>There was a curious vacuum in the Viennese atmosphere during that pre-
  crisis week, a definite break in tension; the crowds in the streets
  diminished, or perhaps one thought so because they went about more quietly; a
  few misread the signs and wondered if everything would now "blow over." But
  from across the frontier accurate reports came more alarmingly than before,
  so that the seeming lull was ominous rather than satisfying. To me it was as
  if curtains were being drawn over big store windows, while behind them
  dressers were at work, changing the display for some moment of sudden
  unveiling in a now predictable future. Few people, probably, are consciously
  hypocritical when, to suit their convenience, they swap sides. Even to
  themselves the move must be rationalized, must be given that appearance of
  sincerity which it partly has; and this requires a little time, a few days at
  least, a small tribute of delay paid by human apathy to the freedom which it
  surrenders.</p>

  <p>I wrote articles during those strange days, and once I called at Brad's
  apartment but did not stay long. I was distressed to see that the issue
  between him and Pauli had already caused a rift, and I knew that especially
  now I must avoid making Pauli resent my own friendship with him. There had
  been no sign of this so far, but it could doubtless thrive on any backing I
  gave him in his attitude. For Pauli, however, mere neutrality was not enough;
  I soon saw that to keep her warm to me I would have to be on her side against
  Brad, and this was even less possible.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it was in the papers that Framm had returned from Berlin, a
  considerably more eminent personage than when he went. The laboratories were
  still closed, owing to the likelihood of further political rioting, but Framm
  contrived to get himself into a steady limelight of statements and
  interviews. He was clever enough not to seem boastful about his Berlin
  success, but to allow the common knowledge of it to support his political
  attitude, which now became openly pro-Nazi.</p>

  <p>During this interval I also heard a curious story from Bauer to the effect
  that Pauli had approached another lawyer, denouncing Framm and inquiring
  about the possibilities of a lawsuit; to which this lawyer had replied that
  since action could only be started by Bradley himself, there was no point in
  discussing it except with him. However, the story got around. I thought this
  a pity, since it made Brad's attitude look somewhat unheroic; but again there
  was nothing I could do either by argument or by advice.</p>

  <p>Then came a memorable afternoon when I walked in the Prater, watching
  children play their games as if nothing were amiss in the world&mdash;as
  perhaps, for children who can romp, nothing is. The first hint of spring
  warmed the air and touched the trees; workmen were taking down barricades
  from the sideshows in the amusement park, and there was something both
  comforting and sad in all this&mdash;comfort in the thought that fun would
  still be bought and sold, whatever happened, sadness when one reckoned how
  many of the quiet unpurchasable pleasures of life were at stake.</p>

  <p>I came out of the park to the Lasalle Strasse about four o'clock and
  waited for a tram to take me to the center of the city. The usual knot of
  newsboys stood at the corner, selling their rival editions. They did not look
  particularly excited, nor did those who bought from them. Then suddenly
  another boy jumped off a passing truck with a sheaf of papers under his arm
  and began shouting something I could not catch above the traffic noise; but
  its effect was to magnetize a crowd, so that the next minute nothing happened
  but people edging out of it, taking a few slow paces while they read, then
  scampering across streets or onto passing trams. By the time I reached the
  corner all the papers had been sold, but a passer-by told me what had
  happened: Schuschnigg had surrendered to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. It was the
  first step to <i>Anschluss</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Opern-Ring when I got there by tram special editions of all the
  papers were out; I then learned the details. Seyss-Inquart was to have a post
  in the Austrian government, all Austrian Nazis under arrest were to be
  amnestied. I read and reread the meager reports of what had happened at
  Berchtesgaden; it was several minutes before I caught sight of another news
  item on an inside page. This reported that Professor Hugo Framm had been
  attacked and wounded by a woman not yet identified.</p>

  <p>Of course I thought immediately of Pauli and then forced myself into
  statistical argument; surely there could be <i>other</i> women who hated
  Framm ... yet when, shortly afterwards, I read her name in print in a later
  edition the absence of further shock proved how one's mind jumps all hurdles
  at such a time; the real surprise would have come if it had not been
  Pauli.</p>

  <p>The details were that she had telephoned for an interview with Framm that
  afternoon, had been told he was busy and could not see her, but had later
  seized a chance to force her way into his private office adjoining the
  laboratories. These were still closed to students, so that no one had seen
  her enter. Sometime later a janitor, passing along the corridor, heard angry
  voices, and as one of them was a woman's, he thought it more tactful not to
  intervene. A few minutes after that came shouts and screams. The janitor then
  rushed to the scene; the woman was held and the Professor taken to the
  hospital with a stab wound in the chest. The woman, it was said, "made a
  statement."</p>

  <p>I went to Brad's apartment, hoping he already had the news. It does not
  always help to have a friend break things gently; sometimes it is easier to
  take the first shock alone, without an audience and without that compulsion
  to act before one that afflicts all of us at such times, especially those who
  reckon to be best controlled. But I was too early; Brad was working and had
  heard nothing; aware of political excitement mounting both in the press and
  on the radio, he had deliberately avoided contact with them all day. So I
  told him what had happened, not only in Austria's life but in his own; I
  showed him the paper. Then I left him for a moment while I went in the
  kitchen and pretended to tidy a few things.</p>

  <p>He took it quietly, as I had expected he would; after the first moment of
  incredulity a slow stricken glare in his eyes became the only outward sign.
  Of course his first thought was that he must see her.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you, Brad. Where do you suppose they took her?"</p>

  <p>"There's a police station almost across the street from the
  laboratory."</p>

  <p>We drove there in a cab. On the way I asked what had happened during the
  day.</p>

  <p>"Nothing out of the ordinary. I was working at home. We had a meal
  together about noon, then she went out. She didn't say where she was going or
  when she'd be back, but that's not unusual either. I was working pretty hard,
  I didn't notice the time passing."</p>

  <p>"Had she talked of going to see Framm?"</p>

  <p>"Never a hint. She hated him."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell them that at the police station."</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. What <i>would</i> you tell them?"</p>

  <p>"As little as possible.... But you might as well be frank with me. Did you
  have a quarrel with her before she went out?"</p>

  <p>"No. Just the regular argument about the lawsuit, she was still urging me
  to start one; but it's hardly an argument any more, it's a sort of wall
  between us and we push our heads against it now and again just to see if it's
  still there.... But for her to do a thing like this.... I can't
  <i>imagine</i> it. She's not the type."</p>

  <p>"The crime isn't a typed one either."</p>

  <p>He rocked his head in his hands. "I still can't imagine it. She was so
  quiet, so ... so discreet. Never lost her temper. Of course she liked to get
  her own way&mdash;who doesn't? But violence ... it's
  <i>unthinkable</i>...."</p>

  <p>"But it's happened," I said, "and you must pull yourself together."</p>

  <p>"I've got to help her," he kept saying.</p>

  <p>At the police station they wouldn't even let him see her, but they took
  particulars about both of us and forbade us to leave the city. The police
  attitude seemed confused as well as worried&mdash;as if they expected blame
  to attach to them for what had happened and must therefore make haste to
  blame others equally guiltless. I think most of their hostile manner was due
  to that; it showed itself in a trifling fuss because we had broken the rule
  that whenever an alien visits a police station for any purpose whatsoever he
  must bring along a passport for identification. Behind this nonsense one
  could sense the political winds rising; everyone seemed preoccupied with more
  than the thing itself.</p>

  <p>After the police let us go I intended to take Brad to see Bauer (which I
  already felt I should have done first of all), but he said immediately: "Now
  let's go to the hospital."</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have been concentrating on one thing all the time,
  because I answered blankly: "Hospital? <i>What</i> hospital?"</p>

  <p>"The Margareten&mdash;that's where the papers say they took him."</p>

  <p>Then I realized what he was talking about. Beyond any surprise I felt, I
  had the fear that we should miss Bauer at his office if we didn't get there
  soon.</p>

  <p>"They probably won't let you see him," I said.</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to find out how he is."</p>

  <p>"They may not know yet. Perhaps he's unconscious."</p>

  <p>"Then I could leave a message&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A <i>message</i>?"</p>

  <p>He said irritably: "Dammit, what else can I do? Your wife flies into a
  temper and stabs a man you've been working with for over a year&mdash;surely
  you ought to say <i>something</i> ... or don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>I hadn't thought out the problem at all till he mentioned it, which
  establishes, perhaps, a gulf between his mind and mine. But I could see the
  minutes slipping by; if Bauer left his office we might not be able to see him
  till the morning, and the loss of a day might be important. "Let's go to the
  lawyer first," I said. "We can call at the hospital later. There'll be all
  evening for it."</p>

  <p>He then consented, we took a cab across the city, and were lucky to catch
  Bauer just in time. He had seen the newspapers and looked very grave. He
  asked immediately if Brad wanted Pauli's case to be handled by him, and when
  Brad eagerly agreed, he replied: "All right&mdash;but it's only fair to tell
  you that my known views might not help her at the trial. What's happened now
  is vastly different from the civil action I wanted you to bring. I'll be glad
  to do everything I can provided you realize that with events hastening the
  way they are I might not be your best choice. On the other hand, I can't
  recommend anyone else. A lawyer of opposite political opinions probably
  wouldn't handle the case at all. Or if he did, he might handle it
  badly&mdash;<i>deliberately</i> badly. It's just a question of which risk
  you'd rather take."</p>

  <p>Brad said he would engage Bauer whatever the risk, and I think there was
  already an awareness between them of some kind of basic division of humanity
  in which they would generally find themselves on the same side. Bauer then
  said he would try to get an immediate interview with Pauli; he did not know
  whether he could at such an hour, but he arranged to meet us again at eleven
  o'clock at the Erzherzog Karl Hotel, where I was staying. Brad turned to me
  and said this would give us plenty of time to call at the hospital during the
  interval. But then Bauer questioned him, and when Brad disclosed his
  intention to send Framm a message Bauer said: "I can see you're the kind of
  client a lawyer has to watch. Take my advice and don't go near the
  hospital...."</p>

  <p>"But surely ... after all...."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;write what you want and let me read it when I get back.
  Then we'll have the argument if it's necessary...."</p>

  <p>I took Brad to my hotel for dinner, but we neither ate nor talked much. He
  came up to my room afterwards and I mixed him a stiff whisky. He said he had
  never tasted whisky before and couldn't think why anyone should drink it for
  pleasure. We made a joke of that. I said I would write to my father in Paris
  and see if he could pull any strings through the Embassy. The Austrians, of
  course, would not concede that Pauli had become even halfway an American
  citizen, but it was possible, nevertheless, that some degree of influence
  might be exerted.</p>

  <p>Brad then wrote his note to Framm and asked my opinion of it. As it simply
  and briefly expressed regrets and good wishes for a quick recovery, I said I
  thought it couldn't be improved on.</p>

  <p>Before the arranged time Bauer rejoined us, helped himself to a drink, and
  read the note which was still lying open on the writing desk. Without
  commenting on it then he gave us the news. He had managed to see Pauli,
  though not alone. He thought she was a little out of her mind; she kept
  denouncing her victim and defending her action. And she had evidently told
  the whole story about Brad and Framm and the electromagnetism issue; the
  papers had got hold of it; there would be headlines in the morning. "Oddly
  enough," Bauer said, "she's so emphatic and unrepentant that the thing almost
  carries a bit of conviction. Of course it's her only possible defense."</p>

  <p>I looked at Brad, who said after a pause: "You mean I'll have to back her
  up in all that?"</p>

  <p>"If you didn't, you'd be signing her death warrant," Bauer answered.</p>

  <p>"<i>Death</i> warrant?"</p>

  <p>"Yes ... because Framm's not expected to live. She punctured one of his
  lungs."</p>

  <p>"Good God," Brad muttered.</p>

  <p>"In a struggle," I intervened. "Didn't it say there was screaming and
  shouting? How do we know what really happened? Framm's a big powerful man....
  Suppose she picked up whatever it was on the spur of the moment...."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately she didn't. She stabbed him with a kitchen knife she took
  with her when she left home. It was premeditated. She admits that, anyhow....
  So all she can rest a defense on is the reality of her grievance. That won't
  be a strong defense, but if her husband confirms it...."</p>

  <p>I looked at Brad again and for a fraction of a moment I was unsure of him.
  Then when he spoke I knew it was my fault, not his. He said quietly: "I'll do
  that. Tell her she can count on me."</p>

  <p>Bauer put his hand on Brad's arm. "Good.... Then in that case, if you
  don't mind...." He went over to the writing desk and crumpled the letter.
  "Not that there's anything bad in it, but you can't quite tell how it might
  be interpreted by the other side.... Now tell me more about this mathematical
  stuff. Where's all your material about it?"</p>

  <p>"At my apartment."</p>

  <p>"We'd better get it now before the police make a search. Might occur to
  them to do that, once they gather their wits."</p>

  <p>"All right."</p>

  <p>We got to the apartment about midnight and in an hour or so had everything
  sorted and packed into a suitcase. Then I said good-night to Brad and
  promised to see him again in the morning. Bauer took the suitcase and we
  returned to my hotel. "Dr. Bradley had better come here tomorrow and start
  work," he said. "I can't do it for him, and neither can you, I imagine.... In
  a way, though, all this has made things easier to prove. People will say
  there must be <i>something</i> in it if a woman would try to kill for it....
  Proof by murder&mdash;rather appropriate to our day and age.... By the way,
  you call him Brad- -do you think he would mind if I did?... I like him very
  much...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next few days passed with something of the unarguable
quality of a
  dream; one did strange things for strange reasons, as if events had twisted
  motive and behavior alike. Brad set himself to the task of building up a case
  against Framm&mdash;the very last thing he had ever wanted to do; but now,
  because Framm's life was in danger and Pauli was in jail, it was what he had
  to do. Even the pages of algebra seemed to take on meaning under this added
  stress of circumstance, and as I watched him riffling through his notes I had
  a curious impression of existence on different levels&mdash;the personal
  melodrama of danger and rescue, the larger battleground of nationalism and
  conquest, and above them both, dim save to a few, the icy eternal truths
  expressible only in symbols such as the square root of minus one.</p>

  <p>The authorities still would not allow Brad to see his wife, and Bauer
  could give us little news except that Pauli's truculent attitude remained
  unaltered. Meanwhile the affair grew larger in the newspapers as its
  political angles were further explored; it was now revealed that Framm had
  been high in the confidence of the Berlin government, and the rumor even
  spread that the crime was entirely political and that Pauli had improvised
  her story to conceal it. Brad then wanted to announce publicly that he was
  prepared to testify to its entire truth, but Bauer advised against this,
  thinking it better tactics to spring the thing as a surprise when the actual
  trial came on. By this time we had got hold of a Berlin scientific journal
  that contained a presumably verbatim report of the lecture, so there was a
  good deal to work on, though most of it was meaningless to Bauer and me.
  Nevertheless, after Bauer had given it a careful reading he commented: "You
  know, Brad, there's one thing strikes me&mdash;assuming that Framm did use
  your stuff, he wasn't too smart. All he had to do was to mention your name
  just once&mdash;to say at the end of the lecture&mdash;'I want to express
  thanks to my assistant, Dr. Mark Bradley, for helping me in this work....'
  Supposing he'd said something like that, he could still have kept 99 per cent
  of the credit, and you wouldn't have had even a talking point against him....
  I wonder why he didn't say it. Sheer hoggishness, I suppose...."</p>

  <p>Brad went on with the quiet preparation of his case, needing no spur to
  effort, yet at the outset (he told me) despising unutterably the task of
  reducing a complicated and beautiful mathematical concept to the terms of a
  legal brief. (He used the word "beautiful" without embarrassment.) Presently,
  however, this touch of intellectual fastidiousness left him, or was submerged
  in sheer anxiety about Pauli; and though I had all along guessed that Brad
  loved her very deeply, I had not been prepared for the emotion, quite
  frantic, that he began to show. I found a task for myself in calming him into
  a mood in which he could sit up till midnight, working against time, and
  then, with the help of a drug, get a few hours of heavy sleep. Several times
  he stayed in my room all night, and once Bauer arrived in the morning to find
  him asleep on my bed. I neither knew nor cared what anyone thought, till
  Bauer hinted that hotel gossip might be an adversely complicating factor that
  we should do well to avoid. So we did, after that.</p>

  <p>When at last the notes were finished I typed them out, performing Pauli's
  job with only two fingers. Then I took the script to Bauer's apartment. He
  gave it cautious approval, but seemed distraught by the return of tension in
  the streets; all of any lull was over. We talked for a while; then I went
  back to my hotel and found Brad prudently gone. I took several sleeping pills
  myself and did not wake till nearly noon the next day, March the twelfth.</p>

  <p>That was the day on which Hitler's troops crossed the frontiers into
  Austria.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The marching, the swastikas, the tanks and armored cars,
the hysteria of a
  city applauding the pageant of its own extinction, all were described at the
  time by eyewitnesses; it is history now, not ten years old, but already in a
  former world. I wrote articles that sought to convey what I thought I should
  have felt had not my mind been obsessed with a personal projection of the
  issue; but perhaps the obsession was really a prism through which I saw the
  thing more and not less clearly. And I was wryly amused to note that my
  waiter at the hotel, a decent timid fellow, became stanchly Nazi
  overnight&mdash;the pluperfect type, Bauer called him&mdash;one of those who
  knew now they <i>had</i> been Nazi all along.</p>

  <p>Brad watched the crowds from my hotel window, saw them progress from
  ecstasy through intoxication to hang-over, though his own private nightmare
  was so intense that I doubt if he realized fully what was happening. We were
  not far from the head office of the German Tourist organization, where a huge
  portrait of Hitler stimulated the crowds to especial fervor; day and night
  this did not cease, but grew more malevolent in its outcome; soon began the
  attacks on Jews, and those also progressed from roughhouse bullying to acts
  of quieter but more sinister sadism. Bauer had now little hope, either for
  Pauli or for himself. He had heard that Framm's death was expected
  momentarily, and he thought the new regime might well feel that a
  disciplinary example must be made. He even wondered whether, for her sake, he
  ought to turn the case over to some lawyer in better standing, but he had no
  success in finding one, and was too loyal to quit for personal reasons of his
  own. The sole chance lay now in some possible international angle; the Nazis
  might conceivably wish to placate American opinion. Were there not strings to
  be pulled through Washington or the Embassy? Was not my father an American of
  wealth and influence?</p>

  <p>I said I had already written to him in Paris, but so far had had no
  reply.</p>

  <p>"Maybe your letter didn't reach him. I happened to hear the other day that
  he's in Linz."</p>

  <p>"<i>Linz</i>? What would he be doing there?"</p>

  <p>Bauer shrugged, and I don't know any certain answer to this day. Nor have
  I much idea how Bauer knew he was in Linz. I found out later that the lawyer
  was a member of an anti-Nazi group which, after the <i>Anschluss</i>, went
  underground; I imagine that the movements of a man like my father could have
  been the subject of secret information. There are those who say that my
  father backed Hitler, but I don't believe he did with any consistency,
  certainly not with any conviction after his trip to Germany in 1935; I would
  think it more probable that he fumbled around, as he had done with Lenin
  during the N.E.P. period, and as he did with Roosevelt during the early days
  of the New Deal, hoping that by some sleight-of-brain he could make himself a
  power behind any sort of throne. He never could. He had a shrewd sense that
  the world had passed into different hands, and he wished to touch them with
  his own, the old dead Midas touch of an earlier age. Somebody once said that
  in the twilight of capitalism my father stalked around like a frustrated
  ghost, wondering whom he should haunt.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go to see him?" Bauer urged. "Take Brad with you and see if
  you can get him to do anything."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">So happened the curious visit to Linz. We left Vienna by a
slow train that
  traveled all night and should have reached our destination in the early
  morning. But frequently we were held up in sidings while a procession of
  troop trains passed; half sleeping in the compartment we heard shouts and
  cheers that still celebrated the bloodless conquest. We reached Linz several
  hours late in pouring rain. Bauer had said that the likeliest hotel for my
  father to be staying at would be one called the Kaiserhof, facing the Danube
  near the quays where the river boats put in. We went there, clattering over
  the cobbled streets in an old droshky, since all motor vehicles had been
  commandeered. The town looked dreary in the rain, and even the newly arrived
  German soldiers had dropped their spirits to match the gray skies. There was
  a general feeling of anticlimax.</p>

  <p>We found the hotel in a state of utter disorganization; a line of German
  officers waited at the desk, making demands for meals, beds, and other
  accommodations which the staff met with a head-on courtesy that had already
  become mere nervous obsequiousness. While Brad was trying to push his way
  through and make inquiries, I had wandered across the hall to the dining-room
  entrance; and across that room, at a table next to the windows overlooking
  the rain-swept river, my father was having breakfast with a woman.</p>

  <p>I went back for Brad, and we then entered together. My father gave us a
  courteous greeting, but he was naturally surprised, not having known I was
  even in Austria. He introduced his companion, a Madame Larousse, who spoke
  fairly good English with a French accent and was rather charming. Then he
  asked us to breakfast with him, but as they had almost finished their meal I
  said no, only coffee. We chatted about the weather and everyday topics (not
  politics, of course) for a while, and Madame Larousse joined in with an
  evident desire to be pleasant to my father's daughter and to a man whom she
  doubtless took to be my father's daughter's future husband; then she
  tactfully said she had letters to write and left us.</p>

  <p>The waiter brought more coffee and when he too had gone I told my father
  briefly all that had happened. He had seen in the papers about the attempted
  assassination (that was what he called it, and I suppose it was that, though
  somehow the description startled me), but he had missed the name of the
  arrested woman, and the rest of our story was news indeed. "Well?" he said
  unhappily, when I paused.</p>

  <p>I murmured something about his using influence, pulling strings, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think I have influence any more? They don't listen to me in
  Washington. Might even do the woman more harm than good if I put in a
  word.... It's a political crime, the way they'd see it. You couldn't get them
  to believe all that stuff about mathematics. And if they did, where's the
  angle? She's not an American citizen."</p>

  <p>"But married to one."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that would mean a thing."</p>

  <p>Brad said heavily: "We just thought it was worth making the trip to see
  you about it, sir." I had never heard him call my father "sir" before, and it
  sounded less a sign of respect than of antagonism. "Since apparently it
  wasn't, we'd better be getting back to Vienna&mdash;there's perhaps something
  we can do there on our own."</p>

  <p>My father bowed slightly. "I hope so. I do indeed."</p>

  <p>"Brad," I said, "go out and wait for me in the lobby. I'll join you in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>"Okay." He nodded to my father and walked away. Then I said: "Excuse him
  for being brusque. He's going through a terrible strain."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I understand that.... He's grown into quite a fellow.... A
  sort of you-be-damned look in his eyes ... different from the way he was in
  London...."</p>

  <p>My father's detached appreciation of an attitude that had been slightly
  insulting was typical of him; but at that particular moment it irritated me.
  I said: "He has that look now, maybe, but it's not normal in him."</p>

  <p>"But he's acquired poise ... he's more sure of himself.... I think he's
  developing very well."</p>

  <p>And at any other time this too might have pleased me, but not now. "Isn't
  there anything at all you can do for his wife?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Of course you can't <i>promise</i> ... but won't you give it a try? There
  might be other places besides Washington where you could put in a word."</p>

  <p>He checked me over with his glance, then replied: "I can't think of any,
  at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Father.... I hate to put the matter to you personally ... but you know,
  in a sort of way, you were in this business at the beginning&mdash;I mean you
  recommended Brad to go to Vienna and you had him meet Framm at our house....
  I know that doesn't make you in any way responsible, but surely it gives you
  an interest ... an extra interest...."</p>

  <p>"I don't have to have an extra interest. I'd help him willingly if I
  could. You ought to know that."</p>

  <p>"Then you will if you can&mdash;is <i>that</i> a promise?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, but I don't see how ... at present. If anything should occur
  to me...."</p>

  <p>"And it might! You'll try to think of something?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, of course." I kissed him and he went on, a little pathetically:
  "You and I don't see as much of each other as we used. You go roaming all
  over the Continent looking for trouble...." He pinched my ear in the almost
  standardized mood of a father pretending to have all the standardized
  fatherly virtues.</p>

  <p>"So do you," I said.</p>

  <p>"No, not <i>looking</i> for it ... just <i>finding</i> it." He dropped the
  pose and his voice also; when he spoke again it was in an almost petulant
  undertone. "I don't really <i>like</i> these people. Even when they do the
  right thing they do it the wrong way. And they won't
  <i>listen</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whether he had any special reason for saying so on that rainy March
  morning in the city of Linz I have often wondered but have never been able to
  determine exactly.</p>

  <p>I rejoined Brad and we took the next train back to Vienna. I told him my
  father had promised to think the matter over, and that with even such a
  limited result the trip could not be called a waste of time. But he was too
  dejected to respond much, and most of the journey we dozed against the
  cushions. It continued to rain and at Vienna was still raining. We went to my
  hotel and telephoned Bauer's office and home, but he was away from both. It
  was almost dinnertime by then, and we had had no food all day, but neither of
  us was hungry. We were served a rather bad meal in the hotel dining room,
  which was crowded with German officers. Then Brad said he would go back to
  his apartment and get some sleep. I walked with him to the corner of the
  Opern-Ring, where he usually took a tram. On the way he said suddenly: "Who
  was that woman your father was having breakfast with?"</p>

  <p>"I got the name as Larousse&mdash;Madame Larousse. French, from her
  accent. I never heard of her before."</p>

  <p>"Do you think your father's living with her?"</p>

  <p>I was startled by his asking the question rather than by the question</p>

  <p>itself; after a second or so I answered: "I shouldn't wonder. She looked
  nice."</p>

  <p>I noticed that a tram passed by which he could easily have caught.</p>

  <p>He said: "Not, of course, that it's any of my business."</p>

  <p>"It isn't really, is it? Or mine either.... To tell you the truth, I know
  very little of his private affairs. He and my mother haven't seemed to be
  getting along lately...."</p>

  <p>"They haven't?"</p>

  <p>"Oh well, how do I know? Perhaps they have, when they've been together.
  But they've been so often separated."</p>

  <p>"They didn't have to be. She used to go with him everywhere."</p>

  <p>"She got tired of gadding about, I suppose. Or else she likes a different
  kind of gadding about ... maybe that's it.... I've often thought they weren't
  very well suited."</p>

  <p>"I used to think that too, in London."</p>

  <p>We waited for the next tram in silence, but I could see that his mood was
  changed, and it struck me as odd that such a matter should be capable of
  lifting him out of dejection into something like a controlled excitement. The
  tram came up and I said "There you are&mdash;run for it!"&mdash;because I
  didn't want him to continue the conversation.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Towards the end of March Bauer had news that the date of
the trial was
  postponed and that in the meantime Pauli had been removed to a prison outside
  Vienna. He had no idea where, and could not find out; nor did he think they
  would allow him to visit her again. Brad was still unable to obtain
  permission to visit her at all. The new regime was getting into its stride
  and Bauer was utterly downcast; he no longer hoped for a fair trial, or that
  he would be given a free hand as counsel for the defense&mdash;many of the
  normal rights of lawyers in dealing with clients had already been suspended.
  He wasn't even certain he might not be arrested himself.</p>

  <p>Then one morning the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He was
  at the Bristol, he said, and could Brad and I see him as soon as
  convenient?</p>

  <p>We were in his sitting room within an hour. The baroque furnishings, so
  typical of the age in which these luxury hotels were built, seemed strangely
  inappropriate to the heaviness in our minds; and I never see a Buhl writing
  desk now without remembering one on which, at the end of the interview, Brad
  wrote his signature.</p>

  <p>He and my father shook hands as we entered, then my father glanced along
  the corridor before closing and bolting the door. "The chambermaid comes in
  at such odd moments," he said, playing down his precautions. "She's quite
  dumb, but it would be a nuisance."</p>

  <p>He settled himself in an easy chair. "Tell me, Brad," he began abruptly,
  "what's the real thing you're after?"</p>

  <p>I suppose the question seemed so general that Brad hesitated&mdash;perhaps
  he even wondered if it had anything at all to do with what was uppermost in
  his mind.</p>

  <p>My father went on: "What I mean is, does your wife come first in all
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" The reply was decisive enough now.</p>

  <p>"All right. So you have one aim only&mdash;to get her out of trouble and
  resume your life with her?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"And you'd do anything possible for such a thing to happen?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Waring, you don't have to waste time asking me questions
  like that...."</p>

  <p>"Please ... let me deal with this my own way. I want to be quite sure that
  in bringing these accusations against Framm you're actuated solely by a
  desire to come to your wife's defense."</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"You're sure you've no <i>personal</i> interest in substantiating them?
  You're not thinking of your professional standing&mdash;anything of that
  sort?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, you never had, prior to the ... er ... the attempt
  on Framm's life ... any idea of bringing a civil suit against him?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>I intervened. "Pauli urged him to, but he refused. It wasn't the kind of
  thing he could be bothered with. That's not to say that Framm wasn't guilty.
  There's plenty of evidence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please, Jane.... This is between Brad and me. I just want to be certain
  of his position."</p>

  <p>"He's told you. He wants to save Pauli, that's the only thing that matters
  now."</p>

  <p>Brad nodded emphatically.</p>

  <p>"All right. Then I can put forward a proposition ... and one which, if he
  accepts it, will enable Pauli to join him in some other country within a few
  months."</p>

  <p>As the full meaning of this came to him, Brad's face was illumined. He
  made as if to get up and seize my father's hand but I tugged at his
  sleeve.</p>

  <p>"I'll do <i>anything</i>" he muttered. He had no voice for more.</p>

  <p>"First of all, this is what will happen if you agree to the proposition.
  Your wife will be brought to trial and found guilty, but there'll be medical
  evidence that she's insane. She'll then be sent to some place of detention
  for a time. However, after a reasonable interval she'll be allowed to leave,
  provided she doesn't stay in Austria.... You understand?"</p>

  <p>Brad still could not reply. I had never seen him so moved.</p>

  <p>I said: "He understands. Now what is it he has to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that. It's quite simple and if he feels as he says, he can
  have no possible objection. What the ... er ... the authorities will require
  is a statement from him ... as a matter of fact, I have it here with me
  now&mdash;all he has to do is to sign it ... a simple statement to the effect
  that there's no truth whatever in his wife's accusations against Framm.
  That's all."</p>

  <p>Brad looked up, but I could not read what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>I said bitterly: "I see. They want to whitewash Framm's reputation."</p>

  <p>"Put it that way if you like. The main thing is that they're prepared to
  pay for it by giving Brad what he says <i>he</i> most wants."</p>

  <p>"So he has to go into court and swear his wife's a liar?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt if there'll be any need for that. She may not even have to
  testify. I expect Brad will just read his statement and that will be all
  that's necessary."</p>

  <p>"Let me see it. You said you have it here."</p>

  <p>"Certainly." My father went to his briefcase, took out a large Manila
  envelope and passed it over. I read for a moment, then exclaimed: "Why, this
  is the biggest swindle I ever heard of! Brad has to give his whole case away
  and gets nothing in exchange! There's not a mention of any promise to release
  Pauli."</p>

  <p>"There couldn't be. That sort of thing never gets into a document....
  However, I understand on quite high authority that what I have said will be
  done."</p>

  <p>"What high authority?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it matters, but one source is Professor Framm
  himself."</p>

  <p>"I thought he was dying."</p>

  <p>"They say now he has a slight chance of recovery."</p>

  <p>"But what guarantee has Brad?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. He just has to take somebody's word."</p>

  <p>"For what it's worth."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And how much is that?"</p>

  <p>"You can judge as well as I can."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Framm?"</p>

  <p>"I saw his representative."</p>

  <p>"But supposing they break their word? Brad's got no redress. He's giving
  away everything ... everything that could possibly help her at the
  trial!"</p>

  <p>My father said grimly: "What you must remember is that <i>nothing</i> can
  help her at the trial&mdash;except this signed paper. If he doesn't sign,
  she'll be found guilty after a short hearing and the sentence will be carried
  out. Assuming that Framm doesn't die, the penalty for attempted murder is, I
  believe, from ten to fifteen years."</p>

  <p>"You think they'd do that?"</p>

  <p>"I can't see anything to stop them. Framm's an important man&mdash;and
  going to be more so if he lives."</p>

  <p>All this time Brad had said nothing. He had listened in a half-bewildered
  way, sometimes nodding or shaking his head. Now, however, he reached over and
  snatched the paper from me. He went over to the Buhl desk and I followed him,
  grabbing the paper back. "Don't do anything yet, Brad&mdash;we've got to
  think this out&mdash;we need at least a day to decide in&mdash;we'll take
  this with us and come back tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My father snapped: "That won't do. You have to decide now. I promised an
  answer this morning."</p>

  <p>"Then let me call Bauer. He's the lawyer. Brad oughtn't to sign anything
  without consulting him first."</p>

  <p>"He can't do that either. If anyone else moves in you might as well tear
  it up right away, signed or unsigned. This isn't a matter for lawyers....
  It's what you might call ... well ... well...." There was a saving irony in
  his voice as he added: "A gentlemen's agreement?"</p>

  <p>"With the only gentleman in the case offering everything in exchange for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we can gain much by going over the whole ground again. For
  one thing, there isn't time."</p>

  <p>"Why is there such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>"People who can conquer a country in two days get the habit of being in a
  hurry."</p>

  <p>There was silence after that, during which my father fidgeted impatiently.
  If it were true that he was being pressed for an answer, I could well
  understand his mood, for it was the kind of situation he would find
  humiliating as well as irksome.</p>

  <p>At length Brad muttered almost inaudibly: "How long was it you said ...
  till they release her?... A few months?"</p>

  <p>My father nodded.</p>

  <p>"She's going to have a baby in September."</p>

  <p>I turned to Brad, wanting to say something quick and warm, but the words
  would not come at such a moment; I could only smile at him in case he looked
  my way.</p>

  <p>My father said quickly: "I think you can count on it she'll be with you
  before then."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll sign."</p>

  <p>So he did so, at the Buhl desk, with the scratchy hotel pen. My father
  verified and witnessed the signature, then put the document back in his
  briefcase and grabbed his hat and coat. We all went out together. As we
  stepped from the elevator on the ground floor he said: "Good-by, Jane ...
  Brad.... I think we probably go in different directions...."</p>

  <p>We let him walk ahead through the lobby on his own, while we pretended to
  study the list of entertainments on the hotel notice board. <i>The Great
  Ziegfeld, Romeo and Juliet</i>, and <i>Scarface</i> were among the movie
  attractions. <i>The Magic Flute</i> was at the Opera House. But the little
  cinema round the corner where I had seen some of the best French and
  pre-Hitler German films was now, it appeared, closed until further
  notice.</p>

  <p>I was due to leave the next morning for Rome, where I had people to
  interview for a magazine. As I should be away about a week Brad took me to an
  appropriate farewell dinner at a small Italian restaurant near the Stephans-
  Dom; we drank a bottle of Chianti and he grew cheerful towards the end of the
  evening, as one who has taken the only possible course and might as well hope
  for the best from it. I agreed with him it had been the only possible course.
  After the strain of recent weeks, it was perhaps natural to react
  excessively, though even while he was doing so the more sober part of himself
  made the necessary corrective. "I'd better not let myself go," he said,
  midway through the second bottle. "It would be too bad if I caught myself
  feeling grateful to these sons of bitches...."</p>

  <p>It was near midnight when we separated outside my hotel. "Anyhow," he
  said, having talked all round the compass and back again, "I'm glad Framm's
  got an outside chance. Not that he deserves it, but he'd be a loss to
  science...."</p>

  <p>Those were practically the last words Brad spoke to me for years, though I
  was far from guessing it then. He was a little drunk and would have kissed me
  good night, perhaps, but for knowing he was a little drunk.</p>

  <p>From my room a few minutes later I telephoned the Bristol, thinking that
  my father deserved at least the few words of thanks I had till then had no
  time to convey. But a voice told me in unctuous German that he had left a few
  hours before by the Orient Express for Paris. I waited a few more minutes,
  then telephoned again and asked for Madame Larousse. The same voice told me
  she had left a few hours before by the Orient Express for Paris.</p>

  <p>I remembered also for years those parting words of my father's: "Good-by,
  Jane.... I think we probably go in different directions...."</p>

  <p>I think we always have.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">High authority, as he had tactfully called it, kept its
word at the trial,
  which came up a few weeks afterwards. Pauli did not testify, and Brad gave
  his stipulated evidence&mdash;legally irrelevant, the judge observed, but
  desirable in order to refute certain mischievous rumors that had been widely
  circulated by enemies of the Gross-Deutschland. Pauli was then declared
  guilty but insane, and the whole thing was over within a matter of hours. The
  newspapers gave great prominence to the high character of Professor Framm, so
  strikingly vindicated by his American colleague and assistant, and the total
  impression was that the two of them had been bosom friends, that the young
  man had unfortunately married a homicidal lunatic, and that thanks to the
  large- hearted wisdom of the new regime such a distressing matter was being
  wound up both equitably and expeditiously&mdash;in contrast, doubtless, to
  what would have happened earlier or elsewhere. I think also that anyone
  unacquainted with the inside story (which meant nearly everyone) could easily
  have concluded that this young American was a warm sympathizer with the
  Gross-Deutschland, its policies, personalities, and plans for the future. The
  court proceedings were stage-managed with extreme skill, and Brad's
  statement, read by him in English, sounded much more emphatic in the German
  translation that immediately followed.</p>

  <p>I heard all this from Bauer, because when I tried to return to Vienna from
  Rome, the German consulate refused to renew my visa. Certain articles of mine
  in the American press had, it appeared, made me <i>persona non grata</i> with
  the Nazis. So I went to Switzerland and there waited for Brad, if he should
  care to join me for a time; but he wrote that he would rather save his money
  for a long holiday with Pauli as soon as she was released. That made me
  insist on lending him a thousand dollars, which he returned, and when I sent
  it again even more insistently he returned it with a note in which he laid
  bare the entire state of his finances. He had about five hundred and thirty
  dollars, he said, which he reckoned ample for all expenses until he found
  another job; and for any emergency he owned twenty shares of A.T. and T.
  Common which his uncle in North Dakota (the amateur geologist) had willed him
  before he died. I thought it was a good stage in our relationship, if not a
  romantic one, that he should give me details of this sort.</p>

  <p>I did not hear from him again, and several of my letters were returned as
  undeliverable. I wrote to Bauer for news, but also without answer.</p>

  <p>Then one evening at a London cocktail party I met a half-tipsy Englishman
  lately in Austria who said he had a vague idea he had heard somewhere that
  Pauli was dead. I didn't tell him that my interest in her was in any way
  personal. It was a noisy party and I had to yell the next question in his
  ear. "And her husband? Did you hear anything about <i>him</i>?"</p>

  <p>He yelled back: "Well, he practically ditched her, didn't he, at the
  trial?... American chap.... Don't know what's happened to him since." He
  flicked an olive stone into an ashtray and ventured: "Maybe he went back to
  America...."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part3"
     name="part3">PART THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I woke to see the hostess nudging me. "Sorry to trouble you,
  but we're coming down at Palmdale. There'll be a bus to take you into
  Burbank.... It's on account of fog."</p>

  <p>She moved to the passenger in front and delivered the same message. The
  plane was already noticeably descending and instruction to fasten seat belts
  came on while I was blinking myself awake. I felt a little irritated at the
  thought of a long bus journey and wondered whether the studio would have sent
  a car to meet me at Burbank.</p>

  <p>My trip to California was mainly because I had recently published a book
  called <i>Great Circle</i>, in which I gave an account of my world wanderings
  to date. It had sold quite well, and a Hollywood studio bought the movie
  rights. Presently someone discovered, as should have been apparent from the
  outset, that there was no "story" in it, but so far from discouraging them,
  this merely whetted their desire for the authoress herself to construct one.
  I told them I had no talent for that sort of thing, but I suppose such
  frankness convinced them far more than if I had jumped at the idea; anyhow,
  in the end we compromised on my spending a few weeks in Hollywood for
  "consultation." Everything about the arrangement sounded reasonable except
  the fee, which was absurd.</p>

  <p>I had been to California before, several times, and had liked it fairly
  well, and the fact that my father was now living there would give me a chance
  to pay him the visit which I felt was due, after a somewhat longer interval
  than usual.</p>

  <p>There was a full moon and a clear sky at Palmdale, but no sign of a bus.
  The disembarked passengers converged towards a make-shift army hut in that
  peculiar mood of strandedness inflicted nowadays only on those who travel the
  modern way. The bus, we were told, was "coming"&mdash;had been delayed by a
  flat tire. I was just about to doze off again in a chair when a loudspeaker
  yelled my name and the information that a car was waiting for me outside.
  Everybody stared, waiting for a person called Waring to move, and something
  of my chronic phobia surged up and almost made me decide to remain anonymous,
  but I knew I should be found out after succeeding yells; so I pushed rather
  ill- humoredly through the small crowd and was doubtless the object of
  comment and envy.</p>

  <p>A large black Cadillac stood at the curb, attended by a uniformed
  chauffeur who saluted in style. As he fixed me inside with a rug he remarked
  how fortunate it was that he'd been able to arrive before I got on the bus. I
  thought so too. Warmth and comfort began to pacify me even before we left the
  airport precincts, and soon I was musing on the hospitality of Hollywood
  studios, and whether it would change when they found out I hadn't fooled
  them. Or would, they think I had?</p>

  <p>I must have slept, because the next thing I remember was the crunch of
  gravel as the car slewed through big gates into an upward curving driveway. I
  thought this could hardly be where a hotel room had been booked for me, and I
  was rousing myself to lean forward and question the chauffeur when we pulled
  up in front of a rather immense Spanish-type portico.</p>

  <p>"But where <i>is</i> this?" I asked, when he held open the door.</p>

  <p>"Vista Grande, miss."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Waring's house, miss. Vista Grande...."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Waring's?... My ... but ... but I'm supposed to go to a hotel in
  Beverly Hills.... I thought this was a studio car...."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Waring's car, miss. He telephoned the airline and found you were
  coming down at Palmdale."</p>

  <p>"There must be some mistake, though. Mr. Waring didn't expect me here ...
  or maybe he didn't know about the hotel. Better keep my bags in the
  car&mdash;I'll be going on there later.... Is Mr. Waring in?"</p>

  <p>By this time several servants from the house had joined in the
  proceedings, and it was all adding up to the kind of fuss I dislike.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Waring is in the library," somebody said.</p>

  <p>As I climbed the steps the chauffeur called after me, in a friendly way:
  "I shouldn't think you'd want to go to Beverly Hills tonight, miss. It's
  about a hundred and fifty miles from here...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Entering Vista Grande through the large vaulted hall, with
a servant
  leading the way like a stage servant, I couldn't help thinking how my
  father's life must have changed since losing my mother, first by divorce,
  then by her death. She would never have been happy in a place like this. I
  could almost hear her voice protesting: "But Harvey, this is
  <i>impossible</i>...." She had always liked a gay, cheerful, offhand sort of
  house, and though she had a flair for furnishing, she mixed styles and
  periods "for Pete's sake," as I used to think as a child. For when my father
  came back to our house, wherever it was, to find some new carpet or curtains
  or a reorganization of the furniture, he would say: "Christine, for Pete's
  sake, what's been happening?" But now it had stopped happening for some
  years, and the result was all opulence, impeccability, and loneliness. The
  place looked like a cathedral that wasn't sure there was a god. Even the name
  was typical&mdash;the second word, anyhow. It lacked the touch of humanly
  bastard Spanish that enlivens so many of the homes of Southern California; it
  was the real thing, for those who sought their realities in wood and stone. I
  admit that after I had got used to Vista Grande I liked it better, but I
  never quite overcame that first chilling impression.</p>

  <p>The library was a long room, walled with books in alcoves between heavily
  curtained windows; the lamps were dim, but a log fire sent spears of light to
  show the carved ceiling and the leather bindings on the shelves. This was not
  so alarming as the hall; indeed, in a somber way it was rather fine, though
  personally I would have expected to write with more comfort in a motel.</p>

  <p>As I entered, my father rose slowly from an easy chair by the fire, and he
  looked so much older that I was immediately touched. We had drifted apart
  after the divorce; it wasn't that I had sided with my mother so much as the
  plain fact that I liked her better, and since it was she who had taken over
  the New York house (and John), I saw her oftener during the scattered
  intervals when I wasn't traveling. After she died I acquired the house
  myself, though it was far too big and unnecessarily expensive; I wasn't,
  however, in a mood to find somewhere else. I saw my father occasionally and
  in various places till he began to change in slight but noticeable ways that
  set him further from me. As this had to do with politics, and largely
  out-of-date politics now, there is no point in going into detail. We
  corresponded from time to time; he told me his health wasn't so good, and I
  learned (long after he had mostly recovered from it) that he had had a slight
  stroke. The next I heard was that he was compelled to rest a good deal and
  had bought a place in California which was quite isolated and fabulous.</p>

  <p>And now he was welcoming me to it. "Jane.... How <i>are</i> you?... Good
  to see you after all this time...."</p>

  <p>He kissed me, and the servant (a young Italian-looking boy with a
  beautiful face) helped him back into his chair.</p>

  <p>My father went on: "It's just lucky your plane came down at
  Palmdale&mdash; much nearer here than Burbank. You've saved at least an
  hour."</p>

  <p>After that I could see I should have to spend the night there, but already
  I didn't mind so much. The Italian-looking boy, still hovering around, seemed
  to read my acceptance of the situation, for when I went to bed later my bags
  had been taken up and unpacked without further instructions.</p>

  <p>"So you're quite a famous person now, Jane! <i>Hollywood</i>.... I saw it
  in the papers. Well, you can make this your headquarters as long as you
  want&mdash; it's only a couple of hours' drive."</p>

  <p>More than that, I reflected, if it were a hundred and fifty miles; but in
  any case, I was certain that Vista Grande would not suit me at all. There was
  no point, however, in arguing the matter then. I said: "I'm glad to find you
  settled down like this, Father. It all looks rather stupendous, but of course
  I haven't seen it yet in daylight."</p>

  <p>"You'll like it when you do. There's a fine view over the mountains."</p>

  <p>I hadn't realized it was in mountain country, which I prefer to any other
  kind. My father went on: "Now tell me about yourself. Not married yet, I
  know. But not even engaged&mdash;or interested in anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Interested in a great many people, but not engaged."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six, my dear. Getting time. Or is it twenty-seven?"</p>

  <p>You put up with that sort of thing all the more easily when you have
  received and rejected quite a number of proposals. Also it occurred to me
  that he was matching his behavior, as he matched his furniture, to an
  approved style- -perhaps Lewis Stone or Lionel Barrymore or some other
  popular father-myth.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-seven," I answered, "and I know it makes me very old, but I
  started everything early&mdash;you remember I began dining out at
  sixteen...."</p>

  <p>I said that lightly, not expecting it to echo along the corridors of his
  memory and finally wake something.</p>

  <p>"Yes ... yes ... I remember.... That painter fellow at Hampstead let me
  down over the house. I told him if he ever wanted to sell I'd buy."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, never mind. You wouldn't be living there now, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Not now, of course ... but when the war's finally over
  everywhere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"England won't be the same, though. Europe won't be the same. Only America
  will pretend to be the same."</p>

  <p>"That's what you said in your book.... But how are they going to put that
  sort of thing on the screen?"</p>

  <p>"They aren't. I can't think why they bought it unless they just want to
  use the title."</p>

  <p>"H'm.... I didn't think it was such a wonderful title."</p>

  <p>"Neither did I."</p>

  <p>We talked on, as inconsequently as that, and presently I telephoned the
  hotel that I wouldn't be arriving that night. Then we climbed the stairs and
  he showed me to my room. I took his arm with more meaning because I knew he
  needed it. The bedroom and adjacent bathroom and dressing rooms were so
  sumptuous that I couldn't restrain a whistle, whereupon he remarked, as if
  making a confession: "I know&mdash;it wasn't cheap."</p>

  <p>I said jokingly: "Even income tax doesn't get you down?"</p>

  <p>"I have so much in tax-exempts," he answered seriously.</p>

  <p>He led me to the open window and pulled a curtain. Very dimly, in the
  clear moonlit sky, could be seen the horizon of a mountain range. "There's a
  little snow on some of them&mdash;it stays all the year sometimes. You'll
  like the look of things in the morning, Jane."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I shall. And such utter silence&mdash;that's strange after New
  York. How far are you from your nearest neighbor?"</p>

  <p>"About four miles. It doesn't bother me."</p>

  <p>"Why should it? Only a few minutes' drive."</p>

  <p>"But I don't even <i>know</i> them. I care for company less and less." He
  added, with frail gallantry: "Except <i>present</i> company."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I said, a little touched.</p>

  <p>"Good night, then...." But he paused on his way to the door. "You know,
  Jane ... this is what I ought to have done after the Marazon inquiry. I
  should have settled down in a place like this instead of spending so much
  time abroad...."</p>

  <p>God, I reflected&mdash;how my mother would have hated it. But I was also
  surprised because this was the first time I had ever heard him refer to that
  unhappy incident directly. Of course I had been too young when it happened to
  know much about it, but I had read of it since, and the fact that it
  doubtless still cropped up in many people's minds when his name was mentioned
  (or mine either, for that matter) had become a quite unspeakable thing
  between us. For this reason his broaching of it now and so casually seemed to
  me a pathetic sign of age and weakening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why bring that up?" I said. "Good night, Father."</p>

  <p>He fumbled his way out and I was surprised to find myself sorrier for him
  than I had felt even at my mother's graveside. He <i>had</i> been rather
  unlucky in that Marazon business. Maintaining a representative to watch your
  business interests at an international peace conference must always require a
  good deal of tact. My father's representative on that occasion was not
  tactful, and as he was also the son of a Senator the whole thing became a
  political football. That was the time when my father was publicly attacked as
  a merchant of death, and I think he would have done better to ignore the
  attacks than to argue, as he did, that cement was not a war material and that
  he had no idea that the sale of it in huge quantities to a European
  government could have had anything to do with the construction of
  fortifications. But cement was not the worst of the things my father had
  interests in, nor was it revealed that he had been selling to one side only;
  indeed, the thorough investigation that ensued was the last thing he should
  ever have courted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning I woke early, drew the curtains, and saw
the breath-
  taking view across the Santa Modena Valley. The range that had been palely
  visible in the moonlight was now a deep green meeting the blue of the sky,
  and beyond it, at some far distance, were higher ranges tipped with snow. I
  came to know and love that view during the weeks that followed; it was the
  kind that had a different enchantment for every time of day and variation of
  weather.</p>

  <p>My father did not get up till noon, the Italian-looking boy told me (and
  also that his own name was Dan). He added that all arrangements had been made
  to drive me into Hollywood whenever I wished. I took a solitary breakfast on
  an outdoor terrace overlooking the view, then said I would leave at ten
  o'clock. That gave me time to wander about the house and grounds. It was a
  large property and, considering the wartime labor shortage, excellently kept
  up. In strong sunlight the house itself did not look so somberly impressive,
  which was all to the good; and I could admit the value of dark interiors as a
  contrast to the vividness outside. The air was already so warm that I
  suspected the place might get uncomfortably hot at times, and I commented on
  this, but Dan said it was too high up&mdash;about four thousand feet&mdash;to
  be ever unbearable, and that in any case the house itself was
  air-conditioned.</p>

  <p>I drove into Hollywood with no clear decision in my mind about returning.
  I felt I ought to have explained that the distance was much too great for
  driving often, and that a hotel room on the spot would really suit me better.
  But my father hadn't come down to breakfast and I didn't want to hurt his
  feelings; perhaps another night would do no harm, and I could tell him after
  dinner.</p>

  <p>We drove for miles over a succession of ridges, passing hardly any
  traffic, till we joined the main Bakerfield&mdash;Los Angeles highway.
  Arrived at the studio I found everyone at lunch and no apparent sign that I
  had been missed or was wanted: but about three o'clock I was welcomed with
  great courtesy by the head of the organization. He chatted for a while
  without supplying any evidence that he had read my book&mdash;and apologized
  for the absence of a Mr. Chandos, who was visiting the dentist. Mr. Chandos
  was expected back at the studio about four&mdash;would I perhaps care to
  wait, or would it suit me better to meet Mr. Chandos some other day? I said I
  would wait, and somehow would have minded less if everyone hadn't apologized
  so much. It was almost as if I were being told that waiting was humiliating
  and that therefore it was too much to ask me to do it. Perhaps for this
  reason I grew rather bored as four o'clock came, then half past, and still no
  Mr. Chandos. Every few minutes his secretary put her head in at the door and
  said she was sure he wouldn't be gone much longer, but if I preferred, she
  knew he would understand if I chose not to wait. That made me wait more
  exasperatedly than ever, though it was really not hard to pass the time in
  Mr. Chandos's office, equipped as it was with radio, phonograph, armchairs,
  and all the latest magazines. These Hollywood magnates do themselves well, I
  reflected: and that set me wondering what sort of man Mr. Chandos was, as my
  mother and I had once wondered what sort of man Hugo Framm was. But it wasn't
  much of a game to play solo, and my expectations of Mr. Chandos were hardly
  amusing and not very cheerful. I suppose subconsciously I thought of the
  Hollywood one reads about, because when finally Mr. Chandos did appear he
  surprised me very much.</p>

  <p>To begin with, he was young&mdash;not mere than thirty-odd, quite good-
  looking, and exceedingly literate. He apologized briefly for his lateness,
  but obviously considered a sudden tooth extraction reason enough (which it
  was): he also said a few polite but not extravagant things about my book.
  Then we began talking about various parts of the world we had both visited;
  and by five o'clock I knew a few of the facts of his life, such as that he
  was unmarried, had been rejected by the army for medical reasons, and had
  come to Hollywood originally from Harvard Law School by way of journalism in
  Chicago and a doctor's recommendation of the California climate.</p>

  <p>"So you like it here," I said.</p>

  <p>"It's good for my lungs," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Not for anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Well ... for my pocket, if you count that."</p>

  <p>"Let's be realistic and count everything."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "All right. But I warn you&mdash;I'm an idealist. I'd like to
  make a picture that would cost a couple of millions and lose at least one of
  them. Hollywood won't let me. It's all I have against the place. Or nearly
  all."</p>

  <p>"So what do you do in the meantime?"</p>

  <p>"I compromise."</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose your ideal picture would fail commercially?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose so many pictures that are not ideal succeed
  commercially?"</p>

  <p>"That's not answering my question. I want to know whether you believe it's
  Hollywood's fault or the people's."</p>

  <p>"Both ... and also neither's. Think of the task of making fifty-two
  pictures a year for a public that expects to see a new one every week. How
  can fifty-two per year of anything in the creative field be more than
  averagely competent? Are there fifty-two good books every year? Or good
  canvases or good musical compositions?... You can't expect Hollywood to be an
  exception. It's a machine for the production of financially profitable
  entertainment, and it does that pretty well&mdash;so well that if it produces
  a miracle now and again it really <i>is</i> a miracle. It's almost as if one
  car on the Ford assembly line should suddenly turn out to be a
  Hispano-Suiza."</p>

  <p>"So to work miracles you should get out of Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the even greater miracle of getting a miracle out of Hollywood
  always tempts me. It's such a wonderful place for sheer technical
  competence.... Look, why don't we celebrate this first meeting?" He turned to
  a cabinet which proved to be a miniature bar and began setting out
  glasses.</p>

  <p>I said I would have a very dry Martini, not too large, because I had a
  drive ahead of me. He made it with some of the sheer technical competence he
  had been talking about, and this challenged me to say: "Since you've been
  frank, I might as well be also. I can't imagine why your studio bought my
  book for filming. There's no story in it, and its real value, if it has any,
  couldn't be got on the screen."</p>

  <p>"That's what <i>you</i> think," he answered, quite rudely. "And see here
  ... in my office there's one taboo&mdash;one only. Never say that a certain
  thing can't be got on the screen. What would you have said to anyone who set
  limits to music or painting only half a century after their first
  beginnings?"</p>

  <p>"All right," I said. "But I've heard that before in another form. The
  difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer. It's the
  sort of gag you see framed on the office wall of a toilet-paper manufacturer.
  Art isn't half so arrogant. It accepts limits&mdash;in fact, the limits are
  part of it...."</p>

  <p>We went on talking and arguing till past six, and set a date for another
  meeting the following Wednesday. I wasn't quite clear what the purpose of
  these meetings was to be (so far we hadn't discussed the picture or the book
  at all in any specific terms), but I was being well paid for whatever Mr.
  Chandos wanted from me, and if it was only general conversation I could not
  complain. I drove back to Vista Grande with a growing conviction that I
  rather liked him.</p>

  <p>My father had held up dinner and his patience in doing so seemed to me
  quite pathetic. He asked many questions about my visit to the studio, and
  then I suddenly got the angle of his interest, which was also
  pathetic&mdash;he had heard some of the classic stories of Hollywood
  dilatoriness and hoped I would be one of those people who come originally for
  a few weeks and stay on endlessly. As this was precisely what I intended
  should not happen, it was hard for me to give him the kind of replies he
  wanted. He reiterated how pleased he was to have me staying at Vista
  Grande&mdash;that it was what he had hoped for ever since he bought it. He
  also told me something about the house, which had apparently been modernized
  from the shell of an old ranch house dating back to Spanish- Mexican times.
  He had chosen it, he said, because he thought it a pleasant place to end his
  days in; and when I protested (aware that we were both conforming to a
  certain pattern of behavior), he said that of course he didn't mean to die
  yet, his doctor had said it might be years&mdash;many years, if he took care
  of himself. So he was doing that, and the climate suited him; he took drives
  and found the mountain air invigorating; he also went to Santa Barbara or
  Palm Springs occasionally and just pottered about the streets, well content
  that nobody ever recognized him. Which reminded him: it happened that he had
  been fortunate in getting a private supply of gasoline&mdash;quite
  unofficially, of course&mdash;so that my trips to the studio were all right,
  so far as he was concerned, though perhaps I had better not tell anyone I was
  driving so far.</p>

  <p>I thought it again pathetic that he should so easily switch from talk of
  death to a confession of black marketeering; for both were further signs of
  the change in him&mdash;perhaps also of a change in the world around him. The
  truth was, I figured, that though his career had doubtless contained many
  incidents of a dubious character, they had all been large matters, like that
  of Marazon Cement; in the small things, until the war, his right to priority
  and privilege had never been questioned; indeed, an army of underlings had
  always been at call to ensure that he got the best seat, the fastest plane,
  the promptest service, the ringside table, the choicest cut. But now this was
  changed also, and though he could still get most of what he wanted, he had to
  chisel like any small-time grafter.</p>

  <p>I told him I certainly wouldn't wish to use gas for frequent trips, but
  that in any case I hadn't to visit the studio again for a week; which meant
  that tacitly I was agreeing to stay at Vista Grande. (And I later telephoned
  the hotel canceling my room.) We sat by the fire in the library after dinner
  listening to the radio&mdash;just the news and a commentator. I had never
  known him bother much with the radio in years gone by, for the reason that he
  never wanted to listen except when he was tired, and then he would certainly
  have been too tired to listen to a commentator. But now he was only too tired
  to comment on the commentator. Some kind of declining equilibrium seemed to
  have been reached, offering perhaps a tranquility that offset even the
  loneliness. He went up to bed about ten, kissing me good night as he had
  kissed me when I used to go up to bed as a girl. It was all more like a home
  than I had had for years, although (or else because) there was something in
  it that dragged at the heart.</p>

  <p>I stayed up myself till nearly midnight, examining the books and generally
  pottering about. They were a sound collection of mainly modern authors, quite
  unnecessarily rebound in full calf, and with a few good first editions, among
  them a boxed copy of the 1847 Currer Bell <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which I
  remembered my father had once bought in London. I took it down to reread that
  immortal opening sentence&mdash;"There was no possibility of taking a walk
  that day"&mdash;with its hint of English rain and Victorian servitude. I was
  still at the books when Dan entered. He had forgotten to tell me, he said,
  that someone had telephoned during the day ... a Mr. Small.</p>

  <p>"<i>Small</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss. He said he'd like to see you tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>"To <i>see</i> me? But he's&mdash;he's in New York!"</p>

  <p>"He said he'd be here, miss. Shouldn't I have told him you'd be in?"</p>

  <p>"No, no ... it's all right. I'll see him, of course."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The thought of Mr. Small kept me restless till almost dawn,
after which I
  slept a few hours and woke up wondering what part of my life I was in. Then I
  saw the sun through the curtains and felt the silence that was, of all things
  after New York, least familiar. It was past nine. I bathed and dressed
  hurriedly, having told Dan to take Mr. Small to the terrace and offer him
  breakfast if he came. But when I got down I found there was another man, whom
  Mr. Small introduced as a Dr. Newby. They had declined anything to eat, but
  were sipping coffee, sniffing the air, and taking in the view with a good
  deal of quizzical admiration. Mr. Small had made concessions to California in
  the shape of two-color shoes, sunglasses, and a Panama; he seemed quite
  cheerful and asked if I were surprised to see him again so soon.</p>

  <p>"Nothing surprises me any more," I answered, deciding on a line. "You must
  have taken practically the next plane. How did you know where I'd gone?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You didn't make it very difficult for me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't try."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "That's so." Then he looked around. "Nice. Good place to settle
  down and write another book.... Is that the idea?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm in California on a short business trip. But I'm still puzzled how
  you found I was here, because I'd originally intended to stay at a
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"That's what the hotel people said."</p>

  <p>"How did you know which hotel it was, or did you try them all?"</p>

  <p>"I knew where the picture company had booked you a room."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake how did you know there <i>was</i> a picture
  company?"</p>

  <p>"It was in <i>Variety</i> that they'd bought your book to make a film....
  So you see none of it was really difficult."</p>

  <p>I suppose it was a very elementary example of sleuthing, and it probably
  impressed me more than it should have. I smiled ruefully. "All right. So you
  know everything."</p>

  <p>"No. There's a lot that you still haven't told."</p>

  <p>I thought I might as well force an issue then as later, so I retorted:
  "And I'm not going to&mdash;unless I'm given at least a ghost of a reason for
  all this grilling. No doubt it's very important, or you wouldn't have
  followed me out here, but that doesn't alter my attitude&mdash;I'm just not
  going to answer any more."</p>

  <p>"Of course you know you could be legally compelled to."</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;by subpoena. And then you'd be surprised how little I could
  tell you. I'm apt to have a bad memory about things that happened so many
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"That would certainly put us in a spot."</p>

  <p>"Not you. Bradley's the one who's in a spot, and you won't tell me
  why."</p>

  <p>He thought that over for a moment, then said: "You'll notice, Miss Waring,
  I haven't brought a shorthand writer with me. You're not even on oath."</p>

  <p>"As I don't intend to lie, that doesn't make much difference."</p>

  <p>"I thought it might make you feel more inclined to co-operate."</p>

  <p>I didn't answer. He went on: "At any rate, it ought to set the key for a
  friendlier talk than we had last time."</p>

  <p>"What's happened in the interval to make <i>you</i> feel friendlier?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "I don't see why I shouldn't tell you. I read your book." He
  stared at me through his sunglasses. They gave him a moonfaced appearance
  that belied certain of his qualities that were known to me. He might be kind,
  but I couldn't see him ever as benign. "My wife read it too. She said it gave
  a very fine picture of Americanism."</p>

  <p>I hadn't ever thought of it that way, but when you have written a book you
  get so used to unusual compliments that you blink at them no more than at
  unusual insults.</p>

  <p>"My wife's a very good judge of a book&mdash;and of a writer. She said you
  looked at things without prejudice and you had a passionate devotion to
  freedom, so that what you wrote was what you felt as well as what you
  saw."</p>

  <p>This somewhat took my breath away, because it was so nearly the epitaph I
  would choose, if any, to have inscribed on my tombstone. I was making up my
  mind to remember it when he added: "That's why she called it a picture of
  Americanism. And I must say I agree with her. It seems to me as American
  as&mdash;as- -"</p>

  <p>"Apple pie?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well yes, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Or cornbread ... chewing gum ... clam chowder...."</p>

  <p>By that time he realized I was trying to be funny. And I don't know why I
  was, except in relief at the vision of Mr. Small at home with his
  intellectual wife and their solemn discussions of books. Perhaps they
  discussed them from one twin bed to another.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he summed up, "your book certainly made a hit with her. She
  also said it could only have been written by one who knew from deep
  experience what it means to be born in this country."</p>

  <p>"Except that I wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>He must have known; it would be the first and easiest thing to discover
  about me. Was it just another test to see if I were being frank? I went on
  with a sort of nervous facetiousness that I don't like but sometimes can't
  help: "The great event happened in London, England, and if my mother had been
  taken ill a few hours later it would have been on the <i>Olympic</i>. What
  would that have made me&mdash;an Olympian?"</p>

  <p>He blinked. "I must tell her that.... An Olympian, eh?... One thing,
  anyhow, it convinced <i>me</i> of ... the book, I mean."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>He took off his glasses and became suddenly an alarmingly different
  person. "That you're somewhat your own worst enemy, Miss Waring. You're not
  always wise in what you say, or how you behave. I should think you've got
  into a good many scrapes, one way and another ... haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. It was the simplest and truest answer.</p>

  <p>"But your heart's in the right place. And you're loyal. You've been
  careful all along not to say anything against a man who was once your friend.
  You've been equally careful not to lie&mdash;even if you've concealed a good
  deal of the truth. As it happens, the problem ought not to arise for you
  again. At least we hope not."</p>

  <p>"Who's we?"</p>

  <p>"The authority I represent."</p>

  <p>"And a nice frank answer, I must say."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't expect much better in wartime."</p>

  <p>"Something to do with the war&mdash;I guessed that. So what do you do if I
  lose my memory? Send me to jail?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should first tell you some of the things we already know. We
  know all about Bradley's activities before the war, we know of his
  friendships with Nazi professors, we know how he defended one of
  them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But that's not true!" I interrupted. "I daresay it may have looked like
  that, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We're not questioning you about it&mdash;that isn't what I've come for.
  I'm fairly satisfied that your friendship with this man must have been just
  personal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;which is fine&mdash;no blame attaches to you at all."</p>

  <p>"But you think it does to <i>him</i>?... I see. So he's under
  suspicion.... I can only tell you how utterly wrong you are."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. There may be perfectly good reasons for everything he did, even
  for the fact that he worked in Germany up to the very day war broke out in
  1939&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>? He worked in <i>Germany</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you didn't know that?... Well, let's not worry too much about it.
  The main thing for you to realize&mdash;as his friend&mdash;is that being
  under suspicion means exactly what the word means&mdash;no more and no less.
  He may be completely innocent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But of <i>what</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Of anything we could possibly suspect.... We certainly <i>hope</i> he's
  innocent, if only because of his army record."</p>

  <p>"Army?"</p>

  <p>"Does that startle you too?"</p>

  <p>"No ... no ... but I hadn't heard from him for so long&mdash;I didn't even
  know he'd come back to be drafted. Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"In this country. In a hospital."</p>

  <p>"<i>Wounded</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Well, injured. A flying accident. He pulled a pilot out of a burning
  plane.... At some risk to himself."</p>

  <p>"But what happened to him? You said he was injured."</p>

  <p>"Not very seriously, though he probably won't be any more use in the Air
  Force."</p>

  <p>"Where's the hospital he's at?"</p>

  <p>"In Arizona."</p>

  <p>"Can I ... could I ... go to see him?"</p>

  <p>"You'd like to, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and since it's only the next state ... <i>Could</i> I?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think there'd be any objection." He smiled. "That's what you get
  for writing a good book."</p>

  <p>If he hadn't mentioned the book again I might not have had the misgiving
  that suddenly came to me. I stared over the Santa Modena Valley and wondered
  vagrantly if those snow-tipped summits in the distance were reachable, and if
  the quest for truth would somehow be easier alone at that level than across a
  breakfast table between two persons sparring for position in what was still a
  conflict of minds. For already I sensed that it was not quite permission to
  see Brad that I had been granted, but rather that Mr. Small was quite anxious
  now that I should see him.</p>

  <p>I said: "Well, thanks." And then, jumping the gun as usual: "Of course I
  don't suppose for a moment you're doing all this to please me. It's all part
  of some plan or other."</p>

  <p>"Sure, what do you take me for? I've a job for you if you'll do it. You'd
  probably be doing it anyway&mdash;you're that kind of person."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes and ears open&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>"Why?... When?"</p>

  <p>"When you meet your friend. Same as you did when you were traveling all
  over Europe to get material for your book. If you saw anything then that
  struck you as odd or significant you made a mental note of it&mdash;I'll bet
  you did. You certainly didn't miss much, and I'm inclined to think it took
  someone pretty smart to fool you."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're smart and you're fooling me now."</p>

  <p>"No." He added quietly: "I think you'll know what I mean when you see
  Bradley."</p>

  <p>"Why? What's the matter with him? You said it wasn't serious?"</p>

  <p>"Physically, no.... He's almost recovered. Now don't get alarmed. He's not
  a raving lunatic either."</p>

  <p>I said as calmly as I could: "Please&mdash;since you've said so much about
  him- -tell me the whole truth. What's wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"That's part of our problem. Dr. Newby here can talk about it&mdash;he's a
  psychiatrist. He's studied the case. He thinks Bradley has something on his
  mind."</p>

  <p>I looked then at the other man, who hadn't spoken a word so far, but who
  now seemed to emerge into a private limelight of his own. He was middle-aged,
  pale, and soulful-eyed, with a somewhat fussy manner and an air of reaching
  out for sympathy but hardly expecting it. Of the few psychiatrists I have
  known personally, all have seemed in need of a psychiatrist themselves, and
  my snap judgment was that Dr. Newby was no exception. He said in a rather
  dulcet voice: "Yes, that would be my opinion. Something on his mind."</p>

  <p>"Why? What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;ell, his behavior&mdash;to the trained observer&mdash;has been
  sending out certain warning signals."</p>

  <p>"Such as what?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you are at all familiar with the field of
  psychiatry, Miss Waring?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly." I don't think I am, but I wanted an answer.</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;ell, then you will know what is meant by a complex. Persecution
  complex, guilt complex...."</p>

  <p>"Is that what he has?"</p>

  <p>"To some extent."</p>

  <p>"<i>Both</i> of them?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, I would say so. Plus some queer ideas that are just a little bit
  on the psychopathic borderline.... And a neurosis about flying&mdash;which,
  of course, isn't uncommon after a plane crash."</p>

  <p>"But he'll get better&mdash;normal again?"</p>

  <p>"No reason at all why he shouldn't&mdash;when the cause is removed."</p>

  <p>"Is what you're doing for him helping?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so.... But he doesn't co-operate very well. He <i>resists.</i> If
  only he'd talk about himself more."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that proved how thoroughly sane he is."</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;ell, that could be true, in some cases. But in his case I think
  it merely shows he has something to hide."</p>

  <p>"I don't follow that at all."</p>

  <p>Mr. Small interposed. "Let's stick to the original phrase&mdash;that he
  has something on his mind. If he has, we all know it would do him good to
  talk&mdash;but he <i>won't</i> talk&mdash;so far&mdash;to anybody. That's his
  problem as well as ours."</p>

  <p>"Then why should you think he'd talk to <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Because he wrote to you, Miss Waring. He's been several months in
  hospital and you were the only person he wrote to the whole time. That's what
  brought you into the picture. We figured that if you meant that much to him
  and nobody else did...."</p>

  <p>"So you intercepted his letter. May I have it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. But it wasn't a letter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Small took something from his wallet and handed it to me. It was a
  highly colored picture postcard of a desert scene, dated the previous March,
  and addressed to me care of my publishers in New York. Scribbled in pencil
  was the hospital address and the message: "Good book, especially page 117,
  last paragraph.&mdash;Yrs. Brad."</p>

  <p>"So this is why you got in touch with me in the first place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And why I got your book. But I really ought to have read it through
  instead of just page 117. It would have helped me to understand <i>you</i>
  better."</p>

  <p>"He must have been wondering why I didn't reply."</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"I don't remember what was on page 117."</p>

  <p>Mr. Small opened his briefcase. "You see I carry it around." He passed it
  to me. It opened at the page where the corner was turned down. The last
  paragraph read:</p>

  <p>One day I walked with a very good friend of mine into the Burggarten where
  the open-air orchestra was playing the Overture to <i>Egmont</i>. We watched
  as well as listened, because the spectacle of so many music-lovers following
  the score, which at some trouble they must have brought with them, seemed the
  strangest possible contrast to the rioting in the streets, and perhaps a
  reassurance that when all the nonsense of the modern world has exhausted
  itself, Beethoven will remain, together with (my friend insisted) the
  Binomial Theorem and a few other intangibles....</p>

  <p>"Was Bradley the very good friend of yours?" Mr. Small asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He had been keeping his eyes on me with a sort of lie-detector intensity,
  but that didn't bother me, because I usually tell the truth, as I did then,
  and I only lie when I can justify it to myself enough to be able to stare
  anyone in the face. There was, however, a core of puzzlement in me about the
  whole business that I thought might soon make me look confused, so I was glad
  when Dr. Newby created a diversion by asking: "What exactly do you mean by a
  very good friend, Miss Waring?"</p>

  <p>I stared at the doctor and thought how dreadful it would be to have that
  melancholy raffishness around all the time, which presumably was Brad's fate.
  He looked as if his experiences, whatever they were, had converted a slight
  original eagerness about life into mere inquisitiveness. I couldn't resist
  the temptation to shock him.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I'd have gone to bed with him if he'd ever asked me."</p>

  <p>"Even though he was married?" Mr. Small put in quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you know that too?... No, I didn't really mean it. I was just
  joking."</p>

  <p>"Did you know his wife?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly."</p>

  <p>"What happened to her?"</p>

  <p>"I heard she died."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know.... You said I could visit him at the hospital. When?"</p>

  <p>Before he could answer Dan came from the house to say that Mr. Chandos was
  on the phone. I was glad of the chance to excuse myself. All Mr. Chandos
  wanted was to convert the following Wednesday's appointment into a lunch
  date; he sounded very cordial and chatted so desultorily that, thinking of
  Mr. Small waiting for me all the time, I was probably rather abrupt in my
  replies. When I did return to the terrace, however, there was already a
  changed atmosphere. I guessed they had been discussing me during my absence,
  and that some kind of clinching conclusion had been reached. It was not long
  in disclosing itself, for Mr. Small opened up briskly: "We've had an idea,
  Miss Waring. Perhaps a good idea, if you think it is too. How would you like
  Bradley to visit you here instead of you going to Arizona to see him?"</p>

  <p>I was a bit amazed by the proposition. "Well yes," I answered, perhaps
  seeming doubtful. "Yes, that sounds all right."</p>

  <p>"Only all right?"</p>

  <p>"All right is all right, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"So you agree to it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure ... why not?"</p>

  <p>"Would it be convenient for him to stay perhaps a week or ten days?"</p>

  <p>I hadn't envisaged that even as a possibility, but it came as an
  increasingly welcome one. "I think so. It's my father's house, as you know,
  but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't object. And it's big enough &mdash;nobody
  need get in anyone else's way."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. An excellent place from every standpoint.... Why don't you write
  today, asking him here for a visit if he can get leave? Dr. Newby will
  arrange the rest."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll do that."</p>

  <p>"In fact you might write now and we can air-mail it from
  town&mdash;that'll be quicker."</p>

  <p>I went back to the library and wrote a brief note, as in answer to the
  postcard, which I said had been unaccountably delayed through reforwardings.
  I sealed the envelope and stuck some of those charity stamps over the flap;
  when I handed it to Mr. Small I saw him notice them; perhaps he thought they
  would make it harder to open the envelope and reseal it. I was fairly certain
  he intended to read what I had written.</p>

  <p>They left soon after that, and I took them to the car in the driveway.
  "Maybe he won't resist <i>you</i> so much," said Dr. Newby, pumping my hand
  up and down.</p>

  <p>"I shan't mind if he does. He's not the type for all this confession
  business&mdash;you ought to have seen that for yourself. You'd probably
  rather confess to him, but he wouldn't like that either."</p>

  <p>Mr. Small smiled as he took my hand after Dr. Newby had let go of it. I
  think he enjoyed the way I tore into the poor little doctor.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week passed, probably the laziest of my life, and
doubtless it did me
  good. I had been leading a rackety sort of existence in recent years, all
  work and travel, full of interest and sometimes excitement, but a bit hard on
  the nerves. I began to realize what I had missed when I woke up on those
  bright summer mornings, stared at the mountains, and remembered I had nothing
  to do all day. I pottered about the gardens and sun-bathed by the pool,
  enjoying myself with all the greater abandonment because I knew how this
  <i>dolce far niente</i> routine would begin to bore me within measurable
  time. And I took long naps in the afternoon and chatted to my father during
  and after dinner. He had been perfectly agreeable to having Brad as a house
  guest, but he wondered how Brad would like it; and then he told me something
  I had not known before&mdash; that in the summer of 1938 Brad had written him
  a rather bitter letter, blaming him for everything.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;<i>everything</i>?"</p>

  <p>My father looked uncomfortable. "Oh, the whole business. It was a wild
  letter&mdash;the kind I could forgive because the boy was so obviously not
  himself when he wrote it. You see his wife died before they could release
  her."</p>

  <p>"You mean she died in the Nazi prison?"</p>

  <p>"Or wherever it was they were keeping her.... I could understand how he
  felt, so when he blamed me I didn't hold it against him."</p>

  <p>It was like my father to cling to any edge of circumstance in which he
  could be an injured party.</p>

  <p>He continued: "I answered his letter but there wasn't much I could say. He
  didn't write again ... so you see how it is ... if he comes here...."</p>

  <p>"I guess he won't then. But you didn't mind my asking him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all. And if it's still on his conscience that he blamed me
  unjustly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should hardly think it would be."</p>

  <p>My father shook his head wearily; I could see he had already chalked up
  Pauli's death as his own tragedy more than Brad's&mdash;one further proof of
  some vast unluckiness clinging to everything he touched. Which was absurd, if
  one appraised the opulence of Vista Grande. But it was also true that the
  possession of money had never outweighed his own personal failure to attain
  some ideal&mdash;and what exactly that was I have often wondered&mdash;maybe
  some impossible combination of Maecenas and Napoleon. Something impossible
  for these days, anyhow.</p>

  <p>"Did he give you any details about Pauli's death?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head again, not so much negatively as helplessly. "It wasn't
  a sensible letter. Accusations ... reproaches ... not like him at all."</p>

  <p>Yes, that was true; it was unlike him. I remembered I had told Mr. Small
  during our first interview that Brad never had a grudge even when he ought to
  have had one. My father evidently thought that in 1938 he ought not to have
  had one.</p>

  <p>"You didn't keep the letter?"</p>

  <p>"No.... I think your mother took it&mdash;and you know what happened to
  letters when <i>she</i> got hold of them...." The flicker of a smile.</p>

  <p>"You were with her when the letter came?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;we were staying with Princess Franzani at Cannes. A whole batch
  of forwarded mail arrived there&mdash;matter of fact, I think she opened it
  first."</p>

  <p>I had heard about that visit to Princess Franzani. It was the last time my
  father and mother appeared socially together before the breach. They had
  agreed to patch things up for a last try, but perhaps a house party at Cannes
  was not the happiest background; and since it was presumably my father's
  choice (the Franzanis being <i>his</i> friends) it was like him to have made
  that final blunder. Anyhow, the patching didn't work and the divorce was
  started soon afterwards.</p>

  <p>I could see that these memories were distressing him, but I had to ask one
  last question. "What did my mother think of the letter?"</p>

  <p>"She didn't say much. She talked of writing to him herself, but I don't
  know whether she ever did. As you know, she often said she was going to do
  things and then forgot about them...."</p>

  <p>It was curious how my mother's faults&mdash;numerous enough, especially
  the small ones&mdash;were all neatly assembled in his memory, ready to be
  smiled over sadly, or indulgently excused. But her virtues, of which she had
  some big ones, gave him no task at all. Not that he denied their
  existence&mdash;merely that they did not fit the mood in which he could keep
  himself, a weather-worn Hamlet, always in the center of the stage.</p>

  <p>When I looked at him across the dark expanse of oak dining table, with the
  silver gleaming in candlelight and the paneled walls carrying the eye into
  sepia shadows, I saw why it was my mother had finally tired of him. She
  wanted <i>life</i>; he wanted something else. I believe that of all the
  treasures of Vista Grande the only one she would have keenly appreciated was
  Dan's face. She loved beauty&mdash;physical beauty&mdash;and in people more
  than in views and things.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Wednesday I lunched with Mr. Chandos. I had a special qualm
about gas
  after my father's assurance that I could use all I wanted, so I refused the
  Cadillac and chauffeur and compromised on borrowing Dan's midget car to drive
  myself; which doubtless sizes up my patriotism well enough, for with only
  small extra trouble I could have taken the bus from the main road. Mr.
  Chandos was very affable and decided on lunch at the Brown Derby. We made the
  short distance from the studio in his rather rakish sports car; he drove with
  a certain abandon that fitted his conversation but made me feel I should not
  be happy on a long trip with him. We were already in the midst of an argument
  by the time we left the parking lot; he was saying that his early training as
  a maker of B pictures, mostly comedies, had given his mind a kind of
  contamination he did not think it could ever quite shake off. "For instance,"
  he said, as we passed a gas station, "if I notice a thing like that&mdash;"
  and he pointed&mdash;"I immediately think of how you could get a laugh out of
  it. Fade-in the drawing room of an apartment high above the
  street&mdash;there's a woman singing opera at a grand piano&mdash;exaggerated
  tremolo and considerably off key. Camera then moves out of the window down to
  the sidewalk where a young man can hear the voice&mdash;he has a quizzical
  look, as if he too isn't sure whether he likes it or not. Then he walks on
  and sees <i>that</i>, and you get your laugh." The "that" was a notice in the
  gas station that said "We Fix Flats." "Isn't it terrible? And done with
  practically no mental effort at all&mdash;that's the danger of it."</p>

  <p>"I've seen worse gags on the screen," I said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"But to go through life with an eye for them&mdash;it's the worst kind of
  occupational disease."</p>

  <p>"Journalists have it too. Anything to catch the reader's attention &mdash;
  nothing much to catch his mind. And yet if you catch his mind by even a
  little, it's worth it, and sometimes only a gag can do it. A few good gags
  about the world's future might help to ensure that it has one."</p>

  <p>"Don't let them hear you talk like that in any studio."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"They might offer you a writing job at four figures a week."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't tempt me."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that, but also curious. Aren't you interested in money?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am, but I earn enough the way I like without doing something
  I don't think I should like."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't any uncles and aunts in Scranton whom it would be nice to
  send help to, and your father isn't still struggling along at a job he can't
  properly afford to retire from?"</p>

  <p>"No. My father's well enough off to support himself whatever happened to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" he said; and then suddenly the idea dawned on him, later than it
  does to most people. "Why ... he's not by any chance ... or <i>is</i> he? ...
  Are you the daughter of ... <i>the</i> Waring ... <i>Harvey</i> Waring?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's odd. Somehow I didn't connect you with him at all."</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why you should."</p>

  <p>"Now what exactly do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>It was as good a way as any other into the kind of talk we had during
  lunch. We dawdled over coffee till nearly three, then he drove me back to the
  studio where my car was, having made another lunch date for the following
  Wednesday. Again we had discussed almost everything except the book and the
  picture, and I still thought I liked him&mdash;perhaps more than after the
  first meeting.</p>

  <p>When I reached Vista Grande towards dusk I found two notes awaiting me,
  one from Brad to say he would be glad to come and would arrive at San
  Bernardino the following day at 5:20 P.M.; the other was from Dr. Newby to
  say he happened to be traveling to Los Angeles on business and so could
  accompany Brad and hand him over to me if I were to meet the train; of course
  in that case I would be careful not to disclose any previous acquaintance we
  had had.</p>

  <p>I wired back to Brad that I would meet the train.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I took Dan's midget car again and was at the station by
five. It was very
  hot, at the low level, and the great wartime trains kept pulsing through in
  both directions, like part of some tremendous heartbeat in a creature too
  large for comprehension. The soldiers leaned out of the windows, bronzed and
  sweating, ready to whistle at a girl because doing so, in this war, appeased
  some of the loneliness that was also too large to be comprehended.</p>

  <p>Presently the train came in, and I thought at first he wasn't on it; the
  windows I ran alongside were full of other faces. Then I caught sight of Dr.
  Newby, half hidden behind a Pullman porter. He let Brad get down and approach
  me, and when that happened I forgot all about the doctor till he came up to
  us a moment later.</p>

  <p>We stared at each other, Brad and I; then we shook hands rather solemnly
  and I said: "Hello, Brad."</p>

  <p>"Hello," he answered.</p>

  <p>We went on staring and the moment stretched itself into impossibility. At
  length I asked if he had any luggage.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a suitcase. They'll put it out."</p>

  <p>"Did you have a nice trip?"</p>

  <p>He said slowly, still staring down at me: "Not very. It was crowded. And
  the cooling system didn't work."</p>

  <p>Then Newby came up, and I was glad in one sense, because it gave Brad the
  necessary job of introducing us. But Newby seemed to enjoy overdoing the show
  of never having met me before. "Well, well...." he beamed, pumping my hand up
  and down. "So <i>this</i> is the young lady?... Lucky fellow.... Take good
  care of him, Miss Waring."</p>

  <p>"You bet I will."</p>

  <p>"And no night clubs. Plenty of sleep ... fresh air ... and your own
  charming companionship. I envy him the cure!"</p>

  <p>The porters were shouting "All aboard"; Newby remained waggish to the
  last.</p>

  <p>Then we walked along the platform to the piled-up luggage. Brad found his
  suitcase and carried it to the car in the station yard. "The fool," he
  muttered. "He's the doctor who's supposed to have been looking after me."</p>

  <p>I said nothing, because already I had forgotten Newby again and it was
  Brad I was thinking of, trying to decide what he was like, as if a first
  impression might tell me something clairvoyantly. I couldn't see anything
  wrong with him at all. Of course he looked older, much older; but then he
  <i>was</i> much older, so was I; seven years make a difference, even without
  a war. I said: "It's hot here, but cooler up in the mountains where we're
  going. You know California? It was hot in Arizona too, I expect. Why do they
  put hospitals there? Good for lungs, I suppose...."</p>

  <p>As we entered the car he told me I looked very well.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm all right. I'm fine. You look all right too."</p>

  <p>"I enjoyed your book. It was in the hospital library."</p>

  <p>"Was it?... By the way, I looked up what you said on the card&mdash;page
  117. The <i>Egmont</i> Overture in the Burggarten.... Yes, I remember that so
  well."</p>

  <p>We threaded through the town traffic, then took the road to the mountains.
  At two thousand feet the air was noticeably fresher; at four thousand a cool
  breeze held the warmth of the sun in pockets. The nameless mountains clothed
  in chaparral rose all round us. I wondered aloud if he were nervous of
  mountain roads, but he said no.</p>

  <p>"Only of flying, then?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>And of course I couldn't have known it without being told; it was a slip.
  I covered it as best I could. "Elementary, my dear Watson. You're a flyer out
  of hospital. Injured flyers often have nerves afterwards&mdash;about flying.
  The ones I've met did, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't a flyer, as you call it; I was a navigator. I could fly, and
  damn well, but I was too old to be an Air Force pilot ... too old at thirty-
  one, that's a nice thing."</p>

  <p>I seemed to have touched a sore spot, but at least it tided over the slip
  I had made; he had evidently accepted my explanation. He went on: "You don't
  fly yourself, do you?"</p>

  <p>I do, all the time; I love it, and I'm taking lessons; I've done seven or
  eight hours solo already. I said: "Sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"I won't if you'd rather I didn't."</p>

  <p>The strain lifted from his face; he smiled and said that was sweet of me.
  But I was not too happy over his swift change of mood. There was something
  odd and rather frightening in the casual way he accepted the idea that I
  would change a habit just to please him. It was either arrogance of a kind I
  had never seen in him before, or else he knew I had made the promise without
  intending to keep it, and he was yet able to find satisfaction in the promise
  alone.</p>

  <p>He asked me again about my book, how successful it had been, the Hollywood
  sale which he had read of, and so on. I told him about Mr. Chandos and my
  studio visit. He said then he was glad I hadn't visited him at the hospital
  because we shouldn't have been able to talk like that.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Newby would have listened all the time."</p>

  <p>"Well, it wouldn't have mattered&mdash;there's nothing confidential about
  it.... Not that I'd choose to have him around, though."</p>

  <p>He didn't speak for a while and I asked him why Newby did so much
  listening.</p>

  <p>"It's his job. Psychiatrists aren't supposed to have any manners or
  decencies&mdash;one doesn't expect them to, but Newby has embarrassments,
  which makes everything rather worse." He laughed. "You know, if an ordinary
  person hears you yelling in your sleep he wakes you, but a psychiatrist comes
  rushing into the room with a notebook and pencil to take it all down."</p>

  <p>"Does Newby do that?"</p>

  <p>"Practically. But I don't think he's got much out of it so far. Matter of
  fact, I fool him a good bit. Whenever he comes in with trick questions I give
  him trick answers."</p>

  <p>"He probably knows you're only joking."</p>

  <p>"He never knows anybody's only joking. The man has no sense of humor at
  all. That's why it's such a holiday to be away from him."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you feel it is. It's wonderful to see you in such good
  spirits."</p>

  <p>"I'm not really in good spirits. I'm damned low."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry then. I hope you're going to enjoy staying at the house. Nobody
  will bother you there. And if you yell in the night I'll probably hear and
  I'll rush in to wake you, but I won't listen to anything, I promise
  that."</p>

  <p>We drove on through the gathering dusk, and at the level of the pines the
  mountain air had a touch of ice in it. Then the sun dipped, and the last few
  miles were in darkness.</p>

  <p>Vista Grande was dim and cool, sheltered a little in its high valley. We
  had rum cocktails on the terrace, where there were patches of warm air
  lingering from the day; I introduced him to Dan, and he said afterwards: "I
  like the look of Dan. Where did you get him from?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't an idea. For all I know my father took him with the house."</p>

  <p>"How is your father, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly well ... or rather, not very well. You'll notice a
  difference."</p>

  <p>"So will he, I expect."</p>

  <p>I wondered if this meant that he regretted the angry letter but I thought
  it better not to let him know I knew anything about it.</p>

  <p>Then my father joined us, Dan helping him. He and Brad shook hands and the
  ticklish moment passed without awkwardness. But I soon noticed that my
  father's presence seemed to put a damper on the conversation, so I filled in
  most of the gaps with chatter of my own. As the dinner progressed I noticed
  also a peculiar waywardness in the remarks Brad occasionally made&mdash;not
  the flashing, puckish waywardness that my mother used to have, but something
  sharper, acider&mdash;as if, out of a tired distillation of his day's events,
  the last drops were bitter. I did not think he would enjoy the usual after-
  dinner hour in the library listening to the radio, and when my father
  suggested it I was not surprised that he excused himself and said he would go
  to bed early. I took him upstairs to his room. He said: "Tell him I'm sleepy.
  I've had enough of the radio. At the hospital it was on day in, day out. I
  used to count the number of times the announcers said 'And now' and 'But
  first.' And now, but first. But first, and now."</p>

  <p>I left him muttering that, before and after he said good-night.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning I found him already on the terrace when I
came down; he
  was admiring the view and talking to Dan. He said he had slept well and I
  said I hadn't heard any yells from his room, but maybe that was because I had
  slept well too. He answered seriously: "It doesn't often happen. The yells, I
  mean. Only when I dream of flying&mdash;or people watching me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Watching</i> you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm supposed to have what Newby calls a persecution complex.
  Everybody watching, listening, waiting, setting traps. And they do, too.
  That's what I tell him when he says I have hallucinations about being spied
  on all the time&mdash;how can it be a hallucination when <i>he</i> spies on
  me all the time?"</p>

  <p>"A nice question for a psychiatrist."</p>

  <p>"And he couldn't answer it, naturally. He's not much good. I told you I
  fool him. He keeps on asking if I'm getting over my fear of flying. Once I
  said yes, I'd like to go up again, because I wanted to be a skywriter, I
  wanted to write an obscene word in the sky. I spelled it out for him. He was
  fascinated. I could imagine him telling his fellow psychiatrists about a most
  remarkable case he had, a patient with a unique exhibitionist symptom.... I
  got a lot of fun out of it."</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't quite fair," I said, "even to Newby. After all, what
  science would ever get anywhere if people fed it with deliberately wrong
  information?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, with sudden harsh intensity that made me feel I had touched
  a wrong note somehow or other. "But who's talking about science? Psychiatry
  isn't a science. It's a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>He glared, as if waiting for me to say something, and I was anxious now
  not to blunder again. "Well?" he continued. "Are you going to tell me that
  science is a conspiracy too?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"Because it would be a damned good answer&mdash;for this day and age."</p>

  <p>His face was clouded over and I devoutly wished I hadn't begun the
  argument. Dan brought breakfast and we ate for a while in silence. Then he
  said moodily: "What does one do in a place like this all the time?"</p>

  <p>"Anything one likes. I haven't been here long enough yet to establish a
  routine."</p>

  <p>"Ever take walks nowadays?"</p>

  <p>"Like the one we had once from Cambridge that day? Not often. I don't
  believe I've ever walked so far since.... Do <i>you</i> still keep it up?" I
  realized the absurdity of the question and added: "I mean, <i>did</i> you,
  before&mdash;before you were in the hospital?"</p>

  <p>"Before I was in the hospital I was in the army and they walk you plenty
  during training.... In Alabama, that was. Too flat. I prefer mountains."</p>

  <p>"Cambridge to where we walked was flat."</p>

  <p>That proved another conversational blind alley. I broke the silence this
  time. I said: "Have you done any mountain climbing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Then the dark mood spread over him like some final curtain, and I knew
  there <i>was</i> something wrong with him, something on his
  mind&mdash;perhaps even, as Newby had said, something he was trying to hide.
  I wondered how I could approach the barrier, but then I decided the best
  thing was probably not to approach it at all, but to let it stay till he
  liked it between us as little as I did, if that feeling should ever come to
  him.</p>

  <p>I said cheerfully: "Well, you can swim or sun-bathe or read or play some
  game or just do nothing."</p>

  <p>"And what about you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do whatever you do, unless you'd rather be left alone."</p>

  <p>"No, no, of course not." He put his hand on mine across the table&mdash;a
  gesture instead of an answering look. "But I'm afraid I won't always be very
  good company."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Brad, don't talk like that. Good company is being with people you
  like. I like you, that's enough."</p>

  <p>"Do you play chess?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well."</p>

  <p>We played most of the morning, and of course he beat me so easily it must
  have been as boring to him as it certainly was to me; not that I was bored by
  being bored, which is the main thing. Then Dan came by and watched our game,
  and Brad asked him if <i>he</i> played. It seemed he did, and I was glad to
  resign in his favor; moreover he played so well that I knew I shouldn't be
  asked again. I sat around, reading the papers and wondering what kind of film
  would eventually be made out of my book. Then we had lunch, and in the
  afternoon Brad took a nap; my father joined us for cocktails and dinner,
  after which Brad went to bed early again. It wasn't exactly an exciting day,
  but doubtless the kind that would do him good&mdash;more good, anyhow, than
  being psychoanalyzed all the time.</p>

  <p>It was several days before he suggested any variant of chess. Then one
  morning, when the sky was unusually clear, he pointed to the snow peaks in
  the distance and asked what they were, how far and how high. I told him and
  fetched maps. "We could drive as far as here," he said, pointing, "and then
  climb this way if there's a trail...."</p>

  <p>"And Dan will lend us his car and we can take a picnic basket...."</p>

  <p>"Rucksacks," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll see if there are any."</p>

  <p>"Have you enough gas?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," I said, with no qualms at all.</p>

  <p>Dan managed to find rucksacks and by ten o'clock we were on the road. We
  drove the length of the Modena Valley and then through winding foothills to a
  ridge whence the mountains heaved up in a huge panorama. I asked him if he
  would like to drive, but he said no, he felt sleepy; and for half an hour he
  did sleep. I think there is a peculiar happiness in seeing people asleep when
  you like them and they are in your charge; there aren't many ways it can
  happen, but a car provides one even when the other person snores and you can
  only give a half-glance now and again because the road is narrow and winding
  and has precipices on one side. He woke when we were almost at the place on
  the map. "You've been asleep," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I didn't dream."</p>

  <p>I said nothing, and he went on: "I'm so used to that question&mdash;what
  did you dream? I invent dreams too, just to give Newby something to think
  about."</p>

  <p>"Is it worth it?"</p>

  <p>"Is what worth what?"</p>

  <p>"The effort of inventing dreams just to give Newby something to think
  about."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "I didn't dream just now, anyway. I'd have told you if I
  had."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you would. I wouldn't want to tell all the dreams
  <i>I</i>have."</p>

  <p>We parked the car where the paved road ended in a dirt track that led
  steeply upward. There was no other car, or any sign of habitation. We hitched
  up the rucksacks and began to climb. The sun was hot through the cool air,
  giving every breath a chance of being warm or cold. After a mile or so the
  dirt track narrowed to a trail that zigzagged through the chaparral;
  presently came the first manzanita with its reddish trunk and olive-drab
  leaves. He said that was a sign we were above a certain height, I forget how
  much, because I was thinking of an even happier sign&mdash;that he had a
  trace left of his old lecture urge. I asked him a few leading questions and
  he talked on about trees, but soon the trail grew too steep for conversation.
  We came to a gap where a valley opened out. The snowpeaks were now so near
  that we knew how far they were, and that we couldn't possibly reach any of
  them and get back that day. I said we should have started earlier.</p>

  <p>"Next time," he answered indifferently, but I liked the indifference
  because he had assumed there would be a next time.</p>

  <p>We sat on a patch of grass, ate sandwiches, and drank coffee out of a
  thermos. Then we smoked, and he went to immense trouble to stamp out the
  stubs. I am just as careful as anyone about brush fires, but I do it with
  less commotion. However, it was good to see him fidgeting. Presently he lay
  on his back and closed his eyes till a plane flew over, too high to see but
  loud enough to look for. I wondered if he had any fear of planes, as such, or
  as a symbol of something, or if it were only a matter of flying in them; and
  I wanted to be frank with him about my own flying. I was just about to be
  when he said suddenly: "I suppose you knew that Pauli died."</p>

  <p>I lay down also looking up to the sky. "Yes, I heard so. I was terribly
  sorry."</p>

  <p>He said nothing for several moments; then I said: "Is that what's been on
  your mind, Brad?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, irritably rather than in denial; then he exclaimed:
  "What's the matter with me? Do I look as if there's something on my mind?
  There ought to be something on everybody's mind, anyhow."</p>

  <p>I didn't know what to say to that. He went on: "They follow me around
  expecting me to spill the beans. <i>What</i> beans? They're going to spill
  their own beans soon ... human beans." He laughed. "That must be a joke.
  Newby would get out his notebook."</p>

  <p>I still didn't speak. He continued: "You're a good listener. Yet you don't
  look like Newby when you're listening&mdash;ears pricked up, memory all at
  attention.... I guess you're just casually interested in me."</p>

  <p>"Not so casual."</p>

  <p>"Casual enough. I like it."</p>

  <p>There was yet another silence and presently he raised himself on one elbow
  to look at me. "I'd say there was something on <i>your</i> mind too."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd like to smoke again, but if you're going to worry about setting
  fire to the mountains I won't bother."</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you."</p>

  <p>"I think you can." So I lit a cigarette. "And I mean that, too, Brad. If
  there <i>is</i> anything you want to tell me ... about anything."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything you'd like to know ... about anything?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, plenty. I haven't an idea what happened to you after we said good-by
  in Vienna seven years ago. I was barred, you know, from going back."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard. You were against them and they thought I was for them.
  Where were you when the war started?"</p>

  <p>"Which war? Nineteen thirty-nine or nineteen forty-one?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen thirty-nine."</p>

  <p>"I was in Brazil."</p>

  <p>"Writing?"</p>

  <p>"More or less."</p>

  <p>"You've been around, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've been around, but I don't know exactly where it's got me.... Perhaps
  back to where I started. Living in my father's house amidst all the luxuries
  ... and taking walks with you.... That's how it did start."</p>

  <p>"But it's so damned different now."</p>

  <p>"Of course. I was only joking."</p>

  <p>"<i>Joking</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Well, your joke was worse&mdash;about human beans."</p>

  <p>I had noticed before that there were certain things that made his face
  cloud over, as if some hidden nerve had been touched. I said hastily: "Let's
  not talk about my life, anyway. Most of it's in my book&mdash;which, by the
  way, I thought you'd read."</p>

  <p>"Parts of it. I find I can't concentrate on reading nowadays."</p>

  <p>"You find chess easier?"</p>

  <p>"Not easier&mdash;but less troubling."</p>

  <p>"What <i>really</i> troubles you, Brad?"</p>

  <p>"Still the casual interest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if that's all you want."</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know someday. I can't now. But I'll tell you what happened
  after Pauli died."</p>

  <p>He leaned over and took a cigarette out of my pack. "I went a little bit
  out of my mind," he said, lighting it. "That's what happened&mdash;chiefly. I
  was waiting for her to join me in Switzerland. The authorities hadn't let me
  see her or even write a letter. I don't know that she ever knew why it was I
  defended Framm at the trial&mdash;I don't suppose they ever told her it was a
  bargain to get her released. I expect she died thinking I'd deserted her at
  the crucial moment. Probably others thought that too. It must have seemed
  strange.... How did it look to you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, I knew the reason, so I didn't think it strange."</p>

  <p>"But others did?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>He fidgeted, then added: "Did people talk about it&mdash;to you?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes."</p>

  <p>"And you had to tell them they'd got it all wrong."</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell them anything at first. I didn't want to queer anything
  till Pauli was actually released."</p>

  <p>"But afterwards&mdash;when you heard she'd died?"</p>

  <p>"Then it was too late for people to be interested. Things are so quickly
  forgotten&mdash;every journalist finds that out. Even a newspaper sensation
  like Pauli's trial doesn't leave more than a few scattered recollections....
  And besides, there's another thing. Suppose I'd tried to convince people you
  were really <i>against</i> Framm and the Nazis, how could I have explained
  why you went to work for him in Germany afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"So you know that too?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't then, but what if they'd told me?"</p>

  <p>He gave me a wry smile. "You'd have been considerably puzzled?"</p>

  <p>"I still am."</p>

  <p>"Yet you&mdash;you don't think badly of me?"</p>

  <p>"Brad, that's another thing I've learned as a journalist. The world's so
  full of strange actions and strange motives&mdash;don't condemn people just
  because they do what you can't immediately understand. Or even always because
  they do what seems to you not good. Wait till they've had a chance to
  explain."</p>

  <p>"So that's my chance now?"</p>

  <p>"Only if you want it. I'm quite willing to go on taking you on trust."</p>

  <p>"If I told you I worked for Framm in Germany because I planned to kill
  him, would you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes ... but did you?"</p>

  <p>"Did I work for him?"</p>

  <p>"No. Did you kill him?"</p>

  <p>He grimaced. "You're so damned matter-of-fact, that's what gets me. You
  can take plenty in your stride. I like you for that...."</p>

  <p>Tempting though this was as a side issue, what I really wanted was his
  story, and soon he began. It came in fragments at first, but not reluctantly.
  And he urged that if he wasn't clear about anything I was to interrupt as he
  went along and ask for any further details I wanted. I think my remark about
  not condemning people for an absence of apparent motive made him specially
  anxious for me to understand his, and sometimes he would pause as if to
  invite questions. The whole thing built up to something I can put more
  connectedly at this stage into the third person; so here it is.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part4"
     name="part4">PART FOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When the time came near for him to expect Pauli's release,
  Brad went to Switzerland to await her. He had been told he would not be
  permitted to meet her in Austria; she would be put on a train under escort to
  the Austrian border town of Feldkirch; the train would then take her,
  unescorted, across the international bridge to the Swiss border town of
  Buchs. The Teutonic exactitude of all this irritated him, yet seemed also a
  perverse guarantee of authenticity. At any rate, he would be at Buchs when
  the day came.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he found an inexpensive but comfortable pension at Interlaken
  and began to plan the quiet holiday they would both have together before the
  birth of their child. He chose Interlaken mainly because he knew a doctor
  there, but it was also a good climbing center, and during the time of waiting
  he built up his own physique after many years of overwork.</p>

  <p>The porter brought the letter to his bedroom along with coffee and
  brioches. When he saw the postmark "Wien" and the official seal on the
  envelope he thought it was what he had been waiting for. A minute later he
  knew he must do something drastic with himself or he would go totally mad. It
  was the morning of a perfect September day, and out of the window he could
  see the mountains. He stared at them for a long time. Then he dressed, packed
  a rucksack, put on heavy boots, and told the proprietress downstairs that he
  was off for a few days' climbing. She smiled and wished him a good time.</p>

  <p>He walked through the town and took the train to Lauterbrunnen. By evening
  he had reached the high ground. He was a good climber, though not quite an
  expert. After a night at the Roththal Hut he crossed the rock and ice
  <i>ar&ecirc;te</i> to the main peak of the Jungfrau, climbed it, and made a descent
  towards the Jungfraujoch. By that time he was at a point of uttermost
  physical exhaustion, and the last hours across the glacier were endured
  amidst a peculiar vacuum of sensation that left his mind swinging clear like
  a compass needle. It was then that he reached a decision.</p>

  <p>He took the cog railway down from the Joch through Scheidegg and Wengen;
  by midnight of that second day he was in his bedroom at the pension. There he
  slept off his tiredness, packed his bags, and told the proprietress that he
  had to leave for good. She was a friendly woman, who had grown to like him
  during his weeks with her; he had never talked much about himself, but
  perhaps she sensed there was something wrong and wondered if it were money
  trouble&mdash;so many people nowadays couldn't get their funds out of other
  countries. If that were so with him, they could come to an arrangement; she
  told him this, but he said it wasn't money, he had to leave for another
  reason.</p>

  <p>He then made the long roundabout train journey through Lucerne, Zurich,
  and Sargans, to the frontier at Buchs. He wondered if he would have trouble
  there, but his former Austrian visa was apparently still good, and at
  Feldkirch the uniformed official stamped it without comment.</p>

  <p>A day later he reached Vienna. He found a room at a cheap hotel, slept,
  and was up early.</p>

  <p>Bauer's office was occupied by another firm; they very pointedly could not
  tell him where Bauer was. He then tried Bauer's apartment, with the same
  result. But there had been a tired elderly secretary named Sylvie; he had
  once had to leave some of Bauer's papers at her home, so he remembered where
  it was. He now went there again. She was very nervous on seeing him,
  admitting him reluctantly into the small shabby apartment. She said she
  didn't know anything, couldn't remember anything&mdash;all Bauer's papers had
  been impounded; she herself was Aryan and had been promised a job in the
  Deutsche Bank&mdash;it must be understood that she retained absolutely no
  connection at all with her former employer's business affairs.</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking you about them. I just thought you might be able to tell
  me where Bauer is."</p>

  <p>He placed money on the table with a gesture he disliked all the more in
  such surroundings; at least, if one bribed, one ought to do so handsomely and
  without the indecent help of another's obvious poverty. But the small sum was
  all he could afford. He said: "I'm not mixed up in politics&mdash;never have
  been. I just want a talk with him, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, sir...." She began to slide the money back across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, sir."</p>

  <p>He got up briskly and left the money where it was. "All right. I don't
  blame you.... I'm staying at the Kaiserling Hotel on the Laudongasse if you
  change your mind.... Good day."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Next he went to the American Embassy. The young man who
listened to him
  there was polite but not very helpful.</p>

  <p>"But Mr.&mdash;Dr. Bradley&mdash;what is it you expect us to do?"</p>

  <p>"I want to find out some details about my wife's death."</p>

  <p>"But on the evidence of this letter...."</p>

  <p>"I'm not satisfied with this letter."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any personal inquiries of your own?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I want to do. They didn't send for me in time. Not even for
  the funeral. I thought you might be able to help me. I'm an American
  citizen."</p>

  <p>"But your wife, I understand, was Austrian...."</p>

  <p>"Does that matter?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, so far as we are concerned, it leaves us without much
  <i>locus standi</i>. And this private arrangement you claim to have had with
  the authorities could hardly be made a basis for any...."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I know all that. I don't expect you to declare war or send a
  gunboat up the Danube."</p>

  <p>He knew that from then on the young man's only aim was to get rid of
  him.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, Dr. Bradley, I don't know how we can help you. If you were
  contemplating a return to America, you might try to interest someone in
  Washington...."</p>

  <p>"Meaning that you're not interested here?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that at all. But for certain things it is almost a disadvantage
  to be on the spot. Of course if your request were for something definite,
  practical...."</p>

  <p>"It is. An autopsy."</p>

  <p>"<i>Autopsy</i>?"</p>

  <p>"That's what you have when you want to find out how somebody died, isn't
  it?" No point now in lengthening the argument.</p>

  <p>But the young man was still polite. "A formal request for additional
  information can be lodged with the authorities, but even then...."</p>

  <p>"They'll take no notice of it&mdash;is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I was about to say that without supporting evidence you could hardly
  expect...."</p>

  <p>He went away with growing awareness that he had been rather stupid and
  probably unfair.</p>

  <p>When he returned to his hotel he found a message that someone had
  telephoned in his absence but would call again later. The second call came
  during the afternoon; it was a woman's voice that sounded as if it might be
  Sylvie's with an attempt at disguise. The voice told him that if he still
  wished to meet the person he had asked for, he would find him at a certain
  street corner in the Leopoldstadt district at ten-thirty that night.</p>

  <p>He kept the appointment, and after a few minutes of waiting a man touched
  him whom he did not at first recognize. Then he saw that it was Bauer dressed
  in rough clothes with a beard grown stubbly; he would have passed for an
  out-of- work laborer. He took Brad along a side street and presently down
  some steps to a slum basement. Noisy voices could be heard from the next
  room. "Speak quietly in German," Bauer said. "Would you like some beer?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. Why are you like this?"</p>

  <p>"I am on my way out of this country. The police are looking for me, but I
  hope to be in Bratislava within a few days. I have friends there. You must
  forgive me for making you wait at the corner. I had first to make sure that
  it was you."</p>

  <p>"I understand."</p>

  <p>"Now tell me why you are here again. It is an unfortunate country to
  return to."</p>

  <p>"I want to find out about Pauli."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say she is dead."</p>

  <p>"I know that. I was waiting in Switzerland for her to join me&mdash;that
  was the arrangement. Then they sent me a letter. It said she died in a
  hospital at Wiener-Neustadt."</p>

  <p>"Have you got the letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." He passed it to Bauer, who read it and gave it back without
  immediate comment.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Brad said at length.</p>

  <p>"What is there to say, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Ought I to believe it?"</p>

  <p>After another pause Bauer answered: "Perhaps yes&mdash;for your own peace
  of mind."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>Bauer gave a shrug which Brad had already begun to adopt for his own use;
  it was a gesture of not knowing where to begin in the enumeration of losses,
  problems, tragedies, injustices; the Masonic sign between those who accept
  despair but refuse defeat. Ever since those moments on the glacier Brad's
  mind had been building a framework within which he could come to similar
  terms with events; but this framework was so strange at first that nothing
  seemed strange inside it, neither Bauer with dirty nails and patched clothes,
  nor a basement cellar in which one lit a solitary candle on a table and saw
  the cockroaches scurrying into their holes.</p>

  <p>He repeated: "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Bauer replied in a whisper: "I know she did not die in Wiener-Neustadt.
  She died at Graz. She was sent there about a month ago."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"We have ways of finding out these things."</p>

  <p>"What else have you found out?"</p>

  <p>Again the shrug.</p>

  <p>"Who is responsible?"</p>

  <p>Bauer gave him a long look and answered: "Who do <i>you</i> think, my
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"Framm?"</p>

  <p>"He was in Berlin when she died."</p>

  <p>"Does that answer the question?"</p>

  <p>Bauer said after another pause: "I wonder whether you are wise in asking
  it. The thing is done and cannot be undone. You are an American&mdash;you can
  go back to your own country where things like this do not happen. And if I
  were you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brad interrupted: "I <i>must</i> know. Framm had motives&mdash;she knew a
  great deal about him&mdash;<i>against</i> him&mdash;and if he could not
  silence her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please do not speak so loudly. And I do not want you to stay long
  here.... Yes, he had motives.... And when you leave you had better go
  alone."</p>

  <p>"One more question.... Was it pneumonia?"</p>

  <p>"It may have been. But that would not affect the issue."</p>

  <p>"Because it was due to something else&mdash;something that led
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In one way or another it should not have happened, my friend. I would
  rather leave it at that ... for your sake."</p>

  <p>"Bauer, I want information, not sympathy. You have evidence against
  Framm?"</p>

  <p>"We have enough&mdash;of the kind of thing one gets. Much of it would be
  inadmissible in a court of law&mdash;if there were any left that deserve the
  name."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't interest me&mdash;I've had enough experience of courts. I want to
  know for my own ... for reasons of my own. <i>Was Framm responsible</i>? Yes
  or no? Or can't one get that sort of answer out of a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>Both men's nerves were risingly on edge. Bauer stood up, leaned across the
  table, and seized Brad with both arms. "For God's sake, man, talk softer!...
  What do you want from me? I have told you enough. Do you want me to say there
  is a hundred per cent proof when there is only ... perhaps ... ninety-
  five?"</p>

  <p>Brad subsided. "I am sorry. Thank you. I now understand."</p>

  <p>"Then you had better go."</p>

  <p>Brad proffered his hand, which Bauer took. "Again I am sorry. Your legal
  mind and my scientific mind do not condemn easily.... It is good of you to
  have arranged this meeting. I hope it has involved no risk to you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not much, since there are many of our friends in Leopoldstadt. It
  is unfortunate, however, that the wrong impression was given at the trial....
  Most of them would not trust you now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the other side does, and that will not be so unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"I see your point. But do not look for certainties&mdash;only
  probabilities."</p>

  <p>"That's beginning to be good advice even in mathematics."</p>

  <p>Bauer smiled then, the first time, and Brad shook his hand again, wished
  him luck, and climbed to the street.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He spent several days after that in a solitude of thought.
Aware that he
  would never tackle a scientific problem before minutely scrutinizing all the
  elements in it, he realized that his own problem required no less, perhaps
  more. It appalled him now to recollect his na&iuml;ve approach to Sylvie and the
  man at the Embassy&mdash;truculent as well as na&iuml;ve, which was a bad mixture.
  There must be no more such improvisations, he decided, but a clear blueprint
  in his mind for every possible behavior; he must be attitude-perfect, not
  merely word-perfect, when the moment came.</p>

  <p>He knew already that Framm was back at the laboratory, having made a
  remarkable recovery. There were frequent references to him in the
  newspapers&mdash; gossip that he might shortly organize an Austrian branch of
  the Reichsforschungsrat, a report from Berlin that he was in line for an
  appointment there. It was this latter, with its likelihood of an early
  departure from Vienna, that made Brad speed up his intention.</p>

  <p>He called at the laboratory one morning in August. It was like stepping
  back into his own past to climb the familiar steps to the portico, push open
  the swing doors, and walk the length of the corridor. But there was an iron
  gateway now to intercept a visitor to the main building, and a tough-looking
  trooper of the new regime eyed him up and down when he gave his name and said
  he wanted to see Dr. Framm. "You'll have to wait," the man muttered, and
  began some complicated telephoning. Presently he said: "Dr. Framm will see
  you in an hour's time. Will you wait here or come back again?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come back again," Brad said.</p>

  <p>He walked about the hot streets, rehearsing any number of parts. When he
  returned to the gate the man was ready for him, unlocked it, and led the way
  to the room Brad knew so well. It was large, with an enormous littered desk,
  high bookshelves, various tables of instruments, and a few worn and
  nondescript chairs. Along one entire wall was a blackboard scribbled over
  with mathematical oddments: Framm liked to work out his thoughts in chalk
  rather than pencil; it made for easier erasure, and also saved his eyes from
  overstrain. Another wall contained a huge and evidently recent map of the
  combined Germany and Austria. Except for this, there was not much change in
  the appearance of things; but in any event the change in the professor
  himself would have demanded first attention.</p>

  <p>Reports of Framm's recovery had led Brad to assume that he would look much
  the same. Actually, in some ways, he looked better now; he had lost surplus
  weight, and the slight physical excess of every feature-quality had been
  fined down to a spiritual extreme. The large strong nose seemed longer
  because it was thinner, the eyes were more sunken and gleamed brighter, so
  that their ranging glance had a mystical aspect superimposed on the merely
  magisterial. And all this because of a punctured lung, Brad reflected; it was
  almost as if the man's personality had put suffering itself to work to make
  himself more remarkable.</p>

  <p>When he saw Brad he got out of his chair, and the whole effect was then
  concentrated; he looked fabulously aquiline as he held out a bony hand. But
  he had not changed in another way; charm came out of him as before, an
  instant distillation. "Well ... well ... <i>Bradley</i>! ... How ... how
  <i>generous</i> of you to come...."</p>

  <p>"I hope you're better," Brad said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm pretty well. Not so fat, as you can see, but that's all to the
  good.... Now tell me how <i>you</i> are." Brad hesitated, a little dazed by
  the reception, not because he had expected anything different, but because
  (he now realized) he had been quite incapable of expecting anything at all;
  but he held to his resolve to talk little about himself and nothing at all if
  in doubt about his answers. Then Framm went on: "Come, come ... there are
  things we have to say and it is well to get them over.... First, I was
  distressed indeed to hear of your wife's death. There are words that would
  put that more fulsomely, but I know you would not care for them.... Second,
  your publicly expressed loyalty gave me the keenest gratification, and I only
  regret you had the ordeal of displaying it in such sordid and tragic
  circumstances.... And third ... I was&mdash;and of course you must have
  realized it&mdash;deeply grateful for your help in those electromagnetic
  researches that have lately attracted some notice...."</p>

  <p>He reached to a shelf and took down a volume, opened it and found a page.
  "Here ... you see?" Brad saw it was an official collection of the lectures
  delivered to a Berlin scientific society; one of them was Framm's lecture,
  and at the conclusion of it there was a sentence expressing "sincere
  gratitude to my American assistant and co-worker, Dr. Mark Bradley, for his
  aid in the preparation and assembly of these results." Brad remembered
  Bauer's remark that if such an acknowledgment had been made there would have
  been no case at all, either legal or ethical, and that if Framm had been
  really smart he would therefore have made it. So now it appeared that Framm
  <i>had</i> made it, at any rate in time for the issue of an official text;
  probably he had done so deliberately when there seemed to be a chance of the
  matter being raised as part of Pauli's defense.</p>

  <p>Brad smiled and handed back the volume. He wondered if if would be
  possible to find out definitely that the acknowledgment had not been made in
  the original spoken lecture. Not that he cared at all, except to the extent
  that it revealed Framm's behavior.</p>

  <p>Framm went on: "I'm sorry you haven't been with me lately&mdash;you'd have
  been interested in one little matter.... Perhaps you remember this
  equation...."</p>

  <p>He swung round to the blackboard, grabbing a piece of chalk and a duster.
  The blackboard had hardly any room on it, and it had always been his habit to
  begin at the top, writing with one hand, while he rubbed away space with the
  other. From the back, with both arms thus outstretched, he looked like a
  scarecrow, and that would have been the time to kill him, except that as soon
  as this occurred to Brad, the hands stopped moving, and an image in his mind
  changed from a scarecrow to a crucifixion. Then came an equally odd
  idea&mdash;that it was taboo to kill a professor while he was writing on a
  blackboard; it would be like killing a priest while he was at his
  prayers.</p>

  <p>Framm swung round. "Now, Bradley, this is the point...."</p>

  <p>He swung back to the board and resumed rapid movement with both hands.
  When he next turned round there were lines of equations. "Look that over," he
  said suddenly, throwing down the chalk and duster. "I'll be back in a
  moment."</p>

  <p>He went out and Brad had a feeling that the absence was deliberately
  timed, though for what purpose he could not decide. He stared at the
  equations, unable to summon enough concentration to give them meaning; it was
  months since he had done anything more mathematical than check his change;
  his mind for this sort of thing was tired, clogged, out of gear. But all at
  once something turned over like a rusty key in a rusty lock; he reached for
  paper and pencil on the desk and began copying the top line. He could work
  only on paper himself.</p>

  <p>Presently Framm came back. "Well, how goes it?"</p>

  <p>Brad said: "Extraordinary&mdash;that's the one thing that bothered me all
  the time&mdash;I wasn't sure of it till I read your lecture. Then I knew I'd
  been right."</p>

  <p>"But you hadn't been. Neither had I. Because look...." And he went to the
  blackboard and wrote again for several minutes; then he explained and they
  argued for several more minutes. It had to do with contravariant tensor
  densities. Finally he said: "I shall issue the correction in time for any
  reprint. Will you set it out?"</p>

  <p>Brad stared at him incredulously. "You mean I should work ... here ...
  <i>again</i>...?"</p>

  <p>"If you want to. I thought that's why you came to see me. There are very
  few people qualified for this sort of thing&mdash;it would seem a pity for
  you to be doing anything else.... And by the way, I might be taking a post in
  Berlin soon- -if you liked you could come along with me."</p>

  <p>Brad said: "I'll.... I'll have to think it over."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. Let me know in a week or so."</p>

  <p>As he left the building Brad realized that going to Berlin would give him
  ample opportunity for what he intended, and perhaps the only possible
  opportunity.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He stopped talking and lit another cigarette. The sun had
moved round, so
  that we were now in shade, and that made the air instantly cold. "Perhaps we
  should move," I said, meaning move a few yards into the sun.</p>

  <p>He said: "Yes, let's go down. We don't want to be back too late. And I've
  talked enough."</p>

  <p>"We can come here again."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. Tomorrow if you like. But let's start earlier and climb
  higher."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>We gathered up the picnic things. "These are good rucksacks," he said.
  "Norwegian style. They fit squarely down the back. Where on earth did you get
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't an idea. Maybe they came with the house."</p>

  <p>"Like Dan and everything else?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"What made your father want to live in a place like that?"</p>

  <p>"He says it suits his health."</p>

  <p>"I thought he preferred Florida."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it had too many memories after my mother's death."</p>

  <p>"I read about that. I was terribly shocked. I wanted to write to you but I
  didn't know any address.... Were you with her?"</p>

  <p>"I was in Canada. There was just time to join my father and fly to where
  it had happened. She died soon after we got there."</p>

  <p>"Texas, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What was she doing?"</p>

  <p>"Driving too fast at night."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"God knows. Why do people do things?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "That's the same question, isn't it? The one we were talking
  about."</p>

  <p>We followed the rest of the trail to the car in silence. Dusk falls
  quickly in the mountains and before we were many miles along the road it was
  almost pitch-black, with just the feel of high earth or empty air out of the
  window. Despite the climb and the long conversation he didn't seem so tired
  as during the outward drive; at any rate, he didn't sleep. Once the
  headlights focused on a coyote in the middle of the road ahead; I slowed down
  and eventually stopped, for the animal did not move, but seemed hypnotized by
  the glare. Finally I switched off the lights and heard it scampering away.
  The darkness was alarming then; it invaded the car like something unleashed
  on us. Suddenly he leaned over and kissed me, not passionately, but rather
  experimentally.</p>

  <p>I said after a while: "I hate to put on the lights but if we're going to
  stay here in the middle of the road...."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Put them on."</p>

  <p>I did so and then drove a little ahead, parking at a safe place.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I guess you didn't like that."</p>

  <p>"I did, but I'd hate to be run into. After all, you were fussy about
  fires."</p>

  <p>"I know. They scare me. Maybe one reason is the way I was injured. The
  plane caught fire. I thought I was going to be roasted alive."</p>

  <p>"And I understand you pulled the pilot out?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind."</p>

  <p>He said sharply: "Don't figure me a hero, that's all. I never got within a
  thousand miles of the enemy. <i>I</i> smashed up in Texas too."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it makes much difference where you happen to be when you
  risk your life for other people."</p>

  <p>"You're being far too romantic about it."</p>

  <p>"You're being much more romantic in belittling yourself. All the storybook
  heroes do that. They say&mdash;Oh, it was nothing. But I know it wasn't
  nothing, or you wouldn't have been in a hospital for the past six
  months."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't badly hurt. I was damned lucky."</p>

  <p>"But you keep on thinking about it&mdash;as you showed just now."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>thinking</i> of it exactly."</p>

  <p>"It might do you good to fly again sometime."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. It isn't important, anyway."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;not important?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, compared with other things." He paused, then said: "Shall we move
  on, or...."</p>

  <p>I switched out the lights. He was still nervous and rather sweetly afraid
  that being kissed in a car was not quite the sort of thing I cared for. He
  said "cared for," but I expect he meant "used to." I said: "I'm not used to
  it, but it's not the first time it's happened."</p>

  <p>He answered: "Nor with me, either. But in Europe one doesn't have a car so
  much."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a great convenience, a car."</p>

  <p>He said: "I always used to wonder what affairs you had, traveling about
  everywhere and meeting so many people.... I thought perhaps there'd be some
  hints in your book."</p>

  <p>"No ... I can keep secrets."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that."</p>

  <p>And the cloud again, the hidden nerve touched. It was so obvious, even
  while I was keeping one eye on the road, that I said: "Oh, Brad, what comes
  over you at times when you suddenly look like that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I can tell you about."</p>

  <p>"All right. I don't mind."</p>

  <p>"If that's true, it's wonderful."</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> true, Brad. Please get it into your head that you don't have
  to say a thing. You've explained why you went to Germany, that's what I was
  really curious about."</p>

  <p>"And now you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you said you went there to kill Framm."</p>

  <p>"But you don't really believe me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I believe you if you say so."</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't even startle you?"</p>

  <p>"No more than so many other things. The world's been a bit full of queer
  happenings these last few years. I've seen a lot that weren't pretty. I've
  seen people beaten up, starved, terrorized, bombed&mdash;I've seen them under
  stress of all the crude emotions that you could only make credible to Park
  Avenue if you got Lillian Hellman to write a play about them&mdash;and then
  the audience wouldn't believe in <i>them</i>, they'd only believe in the
  play.... When you tell me you decided to kill somebody it doesn't seem too
  remarkable in a world that nowadays seems to have decided to kill
  everybody."</p>

  <p>"By God, you're more right than you know. But you take it so calmly."</p>

  <p>"How else can I take it? You were calm when you visited Framm in his
  office that day. You must have been, or else he'd have suspected you."</p>

  <p>"I used to wonder whether he did. He certainly must have puzzled over my
  motive in coming back to work for him. And <i>his</i> motive
  too&mdash;because after all, <i>he invited me</i> ... but why? It was an odd
  situation. He'd grabbed all the credit for my work, and he must have known I
  knew that; he knew too that my public defense of him was only for Pauli's
  sake. And he must have doubted whether I really accepted what had happened to
  her as a natural death. Of course he may have thought I was just a sucker
  about everything&mdash;except mathematics. Perhaps that fascinated him, to
  have someone like that around all the time ... I don't know. I've often tried
  to think it out. He was a strange man. There were different layers of his
  mind all revolving oppositely in concentric circles. And then, mixed up with
  everything else, was the work we did. I don't mean that it brought us
  together in any sentimental sense, but it kept us apart from all other
  issues, while we were both at it. It was a sort of world in which being
  either a murderer or a sucker was irrelevant ... if you can understand
  that."</p>

  <p>"I think I can. But it makes me wish I knew that world myself."</p>

  <p>"Too bad I can't explain much&mdash;if I tried to make it simple you
  wouldn't get the right idea. It wasn't anything dramatic or romantic. Those
  discoveries you read about in the papers&mdash;everything twisted out of its
  context to make the whole business seem like a treasure hunt&mdash;science
  isn't really like that at all. But people think it is&mdash;it's the kind of
  science they want to believe in, so they choose it, just as in an earlier age
  they chose the kind of religion that suited them. I remember once Framm got
  hold of an American comic strip&mdash; Buck Rogers, I think&mdash;he'd never
  seen anything like it before, and it amused him enormously&mdash;he passed it
  to me with a roar of laughter and said&mdash;'Look&mdash;
  <i>Science</i>!&mdash;the opiate of the people!' That's why it's hard to
  discuss science with nonscientists. It isn't that they don't know what you're
  talking about&mdash;I wouldn't know what a biochemist or a biologist was
  talking about, but as a member of the same general trade, so to speak, I
  should know the language of his thought even if I didn't have the jargon. And
  it's the jargon that people get a smattering of so easily these days. Framm
  once said that in medieval times the really popular argument was how many
  angels could dance on the end of a needle, whereas nowadays, judging from the
  magazine ads, people prefer to worry about how many microbes can dance on the
  end of a toothbrush.... And he wasn't sure that was progress."</p>

  <p>"I believe you rather liked Framm," I said.</p>

  <p>"<i>Liked</i> him? Good God, no. But when you've made up your mind to kill
  somebody and you're not sure when or how the chance will come, it's
  surprising what a tie that makes between you."</p>

  <p>I wondered if he were serious till I saw his face. It was under the cloud
  again, and we were at Vista Grande having drinks before it lifted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We didn't climb the next day, for a number of reasons; Brad
was tired and
  got up late, and Dan's car showed a flat that had to be repaired in the
  nearest village several miles away. It wasn't perfect weather,
  either&mdash;rather moist and misty, but towards evening the sky cleared and
  Brad said he reckoned we should start at five in the morning if we wanted to
  reach the snow line. He didn't promise the summit.</p>

  <p>We drove as before and by ten o'clock were at the place where we had
  picnicked. We stopped for coffee, then pushed on with the added zest of
  covering new territory. We hadn't talked much, during either the drive or the
  climb, and I realized, as the trail steepened and became more overgrown, that
  we were on ground that might not have been trodden for weeks or even months
  by any other human being. Not that this was a feat, merely that so few people
  cared for uncelebrated mountains, or in wartime had the time or the gas for
  them. The whole enterprise, I said to Brad, was thoroughly unpatriotic
  whichever way you looked at it.</p>

  <p>"Suits me," he said, refilling the thermos with water. Then he walked on
  ahead, and as I guessed he was in a mood to be alone, I followed a few
  hundred yards behind. We must have climbed for an hour like that. Suddenly we
  came to a point where we could see the ridge above us flattening out into a
  kind of meadow meeting patches of snow. "That's where we'll stop," he said,
  pointing, and though I thought we should do better after another rest I kept
  on without making the suggestion.</p>

  <p>The trail grew sketchy, then lost itself in a wilderness of boulders, and
  with that curious change of perspective that mountain scenery offers, the
  ridge itself looked more distant as we climbed. There came a moment when I
  knew we were off the trail and that the rocks were hazardous if one of us
  should slip. He was still ahead of me, often out of sight, and I began to
  wonder how much more of it I could stand. Then, having scrambled up a chimney
  with knees and elbows, I found myself against a huge slab, steep and smooth,
  with only a crack for a foothold and a hundred-foot drop if one missed it.
  There was no other way of continuing, and I didn't think I could keep my
  nerve. I shouted and heard nothing but an echo. I called his name again and
  again. Then I saw him. He had crossed the slab and was a stage higher, but at
  a place that led to a sheerly perpendicular rock face that hadn't even a
  toehold. He was staring up and down as if bewildered. It seemed impossible
  that he had not heard my calls. "We can't do it," I shouted. "At least I
  can't. Let's go back."</p>

  <p>He waved to me, but did not speak. The way he was standing hid his eyes
  and expression. But suddenly, as if a message had come directly between us, I
  knew he was scared. I called out: "Stay there, I'm coming up. It's all
  right."</p>

  <p>That made him yell back: "No, don't. You stay where you are. It's no
  use."</p>

  <p>"I know it's no use, but you're in a bad spot. I'll help you down."</p>

  <p>"For Christ's sake, don't try it. I'm all right. Give me time."</p>

  <p>I waited, perhaps for several minutes, then began to inch my way across
  the slab. I don't know if he even saw me doing it. The crack was crumbly in
  places, and when a fragment fell the interval before it hit anything gave me
  an extra qualm. I don't know how I got across, but at last I could relax and
  steady myself for a moment, gasping with a kind of fear that was new to me. I
  once stood in a doorway in a Paraguayan town with bullets crisscrossing the
  street and smashing windows all round, but I wasn't quite so terrified.</p>

  <p>"You're crazy," Brad said, when I reached him. His face was gray and his
  hands still trembled.</p>

  <p>"You're crazy too."</p>

  <p>"Why the hell didn't you stay where you were?"</p>

  <p>"Because I could see you weren't very happy up here."</p>

  <p>"You're damn right I'm not. I'm stuck. I've no nerve to go up or down.
  That's no reason why you should have come, though."</p>

  <p>"You'll get your nerve back soon."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I shall. I'm stuck, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"That's nonsense. You don't suppose you're going to be left here to
  starve, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Very funny, very funny."</p>

  <p>"Now look here. Pull yourself together. Let's sit down for a while and
  rest. Then if you're still scared I'll go down myself and bring men with
  ropes or something."</p>

  <p>"Men with ropes? What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Got to be done, if it's the only way. There must be people in the valley-
  -forest rangers, maybe. They could climb up higher and drop a rope. Of course
  you might have to spend the night here first."</p>

  <p>"Too damn cold."</p>

  <p>From the way he said that I knew he was already calmer. I made him sit and
  there was so little room that we practically clung to each other for
  equilibrium. It was far too uncomfortable to be in any way romantic. We had
  left both rucksacks below, but we had a few cigarettes. We smoked, and all at
  once he began to laugh. "It <i>is</i> funny," he cried. "I've climbed all
  those mountains in Switzerland&mdash;the Jungfrau, the Matterhorn, even the
  Finsteraarhorn- -and now I get stuck in a place like this that hasn't even
  got a name!"</p>

  <p>"You're not stuck. You'll be all right in a minute."</p>

  <p>"I'm a nervous wreck, that's what's the matter with me."</p>

  <p>"No, you're not. I was nervous too. Most people would be. I'd like to see
  how Newby would shape up here."</p>

  <p>"Oh God, Newby! Think of it!" He thought of it and it set him laughing
  again. That way it effected a cure&mdash;perhaps the only time Newby really
  did him any good.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do we do?" he asked at length. "Is it to be up or down?"</p>

  <p>I liked the question even if it were partly bravado. "Down," I said,
  "unless you want to get us into some real trouble."</p>

  <p>"All right, but I'd like to try this again someday. I had my eye on that
  snow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we can come here again."</p>

  <p>But I didn't think we should; it was about <i>my</i> limit, anyhow. We
  finished the cigarettes and began the descent. It wasn't as hard as I had
  expected and we both kept our nerve. Half an hour later we were eating
  sandwiches and drinking the ice-cold spring water. I suppose the small
  adventure gave us sensations of special ecstasy now that it was all over and
  no harm done. The snow still beckoned, but our eyes were much more drawn to
  the rock slab that had perhaps (though perhaps not) come near to finishing us
  off. I told Brad I felt I could gloat over it.</p>

  <p>He answered: "Perhaps that's how Framm felt about me, if he could really
  read my mind, but I don't think he could."</p>

  <p>He stared at the rock for a long moment, then went on: "Perhaps I was
  gloating too, in a different way. Over Framm, I mean. The motive of personal
  revenge isn't an adult one for a civilized person, so, if it comes, he has to
  do something to it, or else let it do something to him&mdash;or more likely,
  both things meet in a compromise. You said I liked Framm&mdash;no, I
  didn't&mdash;I <i>loathed</i> him, but there were times when I'd have been
  sorry if I'd heard he'd died in his bed. Once he had a bad cough&mdash;his
  chest was always weak after the injury&mdash;and I insisted on taking his
  temperature and making him go home.... And once the screen of the X-ray
  machine wasn't fixed properly and he nearly got electrocuted&mdash;fifteen
  hundred volts&mdash;that would have finished him off, but I wasn't
  thinking&mdash;I dragged him away in time. It gave me an idea, though.
  Meanwhile our show of getting on well and being on friendly terms would
  doubtless provide a good psychological alibi. The thing began to appeal to me
  as a problem as well as an act of retribution. I don't know whether you'd
  call me mad for having such thoughts. And, as I said before, there were
  <i>his</i> motives too&mdash;they gave me another problem. I could never be
  certain how he felt about me, apart from knowing I was damned useful to him.
  Because I was, by this time. I did all the routine stuff that cropped up in
  his computations. I had begun to be a real mathematician, and he knew that,
  and I knew that he knew it, and there was that unspoken awareness between us
  that always exists when two people can share a tough job without wasting each
  other's time."</p>

  <p>"He seems to have worked much more closely with you in Berlin than he did
  in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. In Vienna we only met when he came around every few days to check
  the galvanometer or glance at the graphs&mdash;he'd say 'Getting along all
  right?'&mdash;and I'd answer 'Oh yes'&mdash;and that would be all for perhaps
  another week. He probably thought I wasn't much good, so why should he
  bother."</p>

  <p>"He didn't think your work was much good until he found it worth
  appropriating."</p>

  <p>"In a sort of way, that's exactly true, and from him it was the perfect
  tribute.... He'd used other people's work before&mdash;I found that out....
  On the other hand, I can see now there was a special reason why he didn't
  think I was much good when I first started with him in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because ... well, it concerns your father."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you knew it, but he paid Framm to take me as his
  assistant."</p>

  <p>"He <i>paid</i> Framm?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't find out till I was in Berlin, and then, of course, I understood
  why Framm hadn't taken me very seriously at first. He just thought I was a
  rich man's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, so he set me to work on what he thought wouldn't come to
  anything and left me to it. He had a few rich students he treated the same
  way. He'd take anybody's money, but you couldn't exactly buy him with
  it&mdash;he'd let you think you could and then secretly go back on the
  bargain."</p>

  <p>I couldn't help smiling. "My poor father! If he knew that he'd have to add
  Framm to the list of all the other people who disappointed him.... Just for
  curiosity, have you any idea what my father <i>did</i> pay?"</p>

  <p>"My whole salary."</p>

  <p>"Good God! So all the time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all the time I was in Vienna I was costing Framm nothing."</p>

  <p>"That's one way of looking at it. But I was thinking also that if the
  arrangement was for my father to pay your salary, then my father was a bit
  responsible for you being underpaid."</p>

  <p>"Or else generous for offering to pay for me at all."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps.... It's odd, though, how much easier it is to forgive Framm for
  exploiting you totally than to excuse my father for not putting up a few
  extra dollars. Particularly as...."</p>

  <p>I stopped in time. It had been on my tongue to say: "Particularly as he
  had a reason to get you out of the way."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Brad said.</p>

  <p>"Particularly as he's so rich," I answered. But perhaps it sounded as
  improvised as it was.</p>

  <p>"Shall we start going down?" he asked, and we tramped a mile or more
  before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>We had cached a thermos of coffee at the old picnic place and it made a
  pleasant excuse for another halt. But we were tired now, exhausted in nerves
  and bones; the feeling came on suddenly while we were lying on the grass. We
  smoked cigarette after cigarette and, as the afternoon progressed, rolled
  over in deep lassitude to stay in the sun.</p>

  <p>"What exactly did you do in Berlin?" I asked, lazily. "Routine work for
  Framm, you said. But wasn't there anything you did on your own?"</p>

  <p>"Not so much. Now he knew I was good and he was paying me himself he kept
  me busy most of the time. But of course his work and mine weren't so far
  apart. Electromagnetism links up with the entire field of quantum
  mathematics."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you have any personal life? Any fun? Didn't you go
  anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Berlin wasn't a gay city in those days."</p>

  <p>"But there must have been a few places&mdash;theaters, movies...."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I went to a few."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you visit anybody's home? Of course I remember what you were like
  in London...."</p>

  <p>"That was different. I was shy then. I wasn't shy in Berlin. But I didn't
  go anywhere&mdash;except once to a party Framm gave."</p>

  <p>"Oh? At his house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I wanted to see what it was like. He had a big villa in
  Charlottenburg. His wife was all right&mdash;quite pleasant&mdash;the
  gracious hostess&mdash; probably what we should call in America a socialite.
  But domestic also. The place was swarming with little Framms. Kids of all
  ages from two to twelve. It was a big party&mdash;professors and professors'
  wives, and the kind of half- professors they call <i>Privatdozenten</i>. All
  very Nazi, of course. And nobody packed the kids off to bed, as they should
  have, and the more they romped and misbehaved the more Framm seemed to enjoy
  it."</p>

  <p>"Just one happy family."</p>

  <p>"Maybe ... if you can work that in with the fact that Framm was notorious
  for his affairs with other women. I'd known that in Vienna, but I didn't meet
  his family there, so it hadn't looked like such a paradox. To see him playing
  silly games with those kids, who obviously adored him, when all the time one
  knew what a swine he was...."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever visit his house again?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'd had enough. Perhaps he'd had enough too&mdash;I wasn't asked. But
  he'd introduced me very charmingly to everybody. Of course they knew what had
  happened in Vienna&mdash;who I was, and about Pauli. I was his American
  specialty&mdash; the young mathematician for whom the privilege of working
  with Hugo Framm outweighed all personal and private complications.... Or
  no&mdash;perhaps that's going too far. I don't know what was in his mind
  about me. He had an air of showing me off as a novelty, but then I <i>was</i>
  a novelty. Not many Americans studied in Germany after the Nazis came to
  power."</p>

  <p>"Of course they must have thought you were sympathetic."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I wanted them to think so. It was part of my plan.... You'd better
  let me tell you the whole story consecutively...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Technische Institut was outside Berlin, a functional
edifice,
  deliberately unacademic in style; different branches of science were housed
  floor above floor, and as in London, Physics was at the top, not from any
  symbolic recognition of its importance but for the opposite reason that more
  favored sciences chose the more accessible space. Brad, however, did not mind
  that. To ascend by the slow elevator through the sounds and smells of so much
  practical experimentation in other fields, most of it geared for war, and to
  reach finally the quietude of his own room under the roof gave him a feeling
  that he was in, but not of, the hive.</p>

  <p>He soon realized that it was a political as well as a scientific hive.
  Within the aggressively Nazi framework of staff and student bodies there were
  continual interdepartmental struggles&mdash;for government appropriations,
  extra personnel, and that continuance of political favor on which very
  existence depended. Framm spent at least half his time and energies on these
  exhausting battles, and usually he won them. He was utterly unscrupulous, a
  wily tactician, a dangerous enemy and a false friend; but Brad had to admit
  that, so far as dealing with the higher authorities was concerned, these
  attributes were necessities of survival. It was when they showed in his
  treatment of subordinates that Brad hated him with a pure intensity that
  nourished his own personal decision.</p>

  <p>He had wondered at first how his co-workers would accept him into their
  midst, but he found he had so little contact with them, professional or
  personal, that problems of behavior rarely arose on either side. He had been
  at the Technische Institut for weeks before he exchanged more than a
  good-morning with anyone except Framm and Framm's secretary.</p>

  <p>Then for some reason this girl gave up her job and another arrived one
  morning in her place. She was friendly, and since Framm happened to be away
  most of her first day, she used her conversation on Brad, who would not have
  encouraged her but for a curious circumstance which he soon
  discovered&mdash;that the girl knew what had happened in Vienna, but did not
  yet connect Brad with it. And she was most anxious to chat about her new
  employer, for whom she had already conceived the ardent admiration that women
  so readily felt for Framm. Wasn't he wonderful? Such a brilliant mind ... and
  his eyes&mdash;they seemed to bore through you. And so pale&mdash;perhaps he
  didn't have good health. She had heard he nearly died after that madwoman
  attacked him in Vienna.</p>

  <p>Brad thought this as good a method of exploration as he was likely to
  find. He said "yes" in answer, and added a few details to whet her eagerness
  both to give and to take. Presently she said: "Of course you know what was
  really behind it all?"</p>

  <p>So the accusations Pauli had made against Framm were common gossip, Brad
  reflected; he wondered how that would help or hinder the accomplishment of
  his purpose. He said: "No? What was it?"</p>

  <p>Then she said something that so utterly shocked and amazed him that even
  the girl, who had expected to create a small sensation, was surprised at the
  larger size of it.</p>

  <p>What she said was this: that Pauli had been Framm's mistress and that when
  the Nazi movement in Austria began to flourish, Framm got rid of her because
  she was a quarter Jew.</p>

  <p>Brad had known this latter fact, which had meant nothing to him, but the
  suggestion of her relationship with Framm was shattering, even though he was
  aware that the girl might only be repeating untrue gossip. Nor did he know
  quite what it shattered. Not his faith in Pauli; nor his hatred of Framm,
  which in many ways it accentuated. Eventually he decided it must be something
  inside himself that had nothing to do with either.</p>

  <p>Later in the same day the girl came to him, full of apologies and
  embarrassments; doubtless during the interval somebody had told her who
  Framm's assistant was. He patted her arm and said it didn't matter, it hadn't
  been her fault; but they talked no more on any subsequent occasion, and soon
  Framm's temper and temperament made her quit as had her predecessor.</p>

  <p>Brad found that coming to terms with the new idea, true or not, put Framm
  in perspective, made the focus of his own observation almost fascinatingly
  sharper, so that he accumulated data with less impatience. When he saw
  Framm's ruthlessness in trampling opposition he felt more certain than ever
  that the man had been responsible for Pauli's death, yet he was also willing
  to wait longer till he discovered some final clinching evidence. For this
  reason he welcomed and even relished every fresh display of Framm's malice;
  each instance added a fragment to the mosaic of indictment. There was a
  clever young biologist who had criticized some administrative scheme that
  Framm was trying to put over&mdash;sound criticism, since afterwards Framm
  changed his scheme accordingly. But he could not forgive the instigator, and
  had him hounded from a minor university post on a racial count. Not that he
  believed in the prevalent nonsense about Aryanism, but he found the nonsense
  useful. If one of his subordinates were part Jewish, a good scientist, and
  also subservient to him personally, he would protect him, but if he weren't
  good or showed any sign of independence, then the racial angle provided a
  weapon. The way he used it against the biologist was typically improvised; he
  spread the story that the man was a Jew when actually he wasn't. In all such
  maneuvers Framm had no conscience, no hesitation, and no pity. He despised
  the mob and the Nazi mob as much as any other, but he was willing to pay it
  all the necessary kinds of lip service.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, overhearing in Framm's office half of a telephone talk that
  revealed either the lip service or the ruthlessness, Brad would be unable to
  keep back a look that told plainly enough what he thought; and Framm would
  catch the look, interpret it correctly, yet seem by no means displeased.
  Gradually Brad came to realize that these interpretations did not put to
  hazard a relationship which, on the surface, he still wished others to take
  for one of close friendship; on the contrary, Framm at times seemed to derive
  perverse enjoyment from the situation. And perhaps because of this, and also
  because Brad was an American, Framm was less guarded in what he said in front
  of him. He agreed that the division of science into good Germanic and bad
  Jewish was sheerly idiotic; he had admitted this, freely and cynically, when
  Brad had argued the cause of the biologist. And when he saw the look in
  Brad's eyes, he said: "You'll probably kill me one of these days, Bradley,
  but I know you won't peach on me."</p>

  <p>In this fantastic way he trusted Brad, and no less when Brad's hostility
  became outspoken. He too became then more outspoken; he began to make Brad an
  audience whenever he had trouble with the authorities or with his rival
  department heads. He would rehearse an argument, or conduct a post-mortem on
  one; he would unleash his wits in dangerous territory after carefully making
  sure that the doors were closed and that his secretary was at lunch. He was
  capable of referring to Hitler as "that inspired <i>Quatschkopf</i> into
  whose hands God has entrusted the destiny of the world." He confided in Brad
  all the details of his continuous and frustrating feuds with the Nazi
  higher-ups, he would read over his briefs in defense of theoretical work; and
  then, less tactfully, he would let loose a devastating blast against the
  intelligence of certain persons in authority. Nor could anyone be much more
  devastating than Framm when he was in vitriolic form. His voice and gestures
  were of such excellent acting quality that Brad once asked why he wasted them
  on a single hearer. Framm replied: "They are not wasted&mdash;they are
  indulged in."</p>

  <p>As for the work, that too progressed so well that it reached many an
  abstract discussion point. Framm would enter Brad's laboratory after some
  tigerish outside struggle in which he had bested an opponent, placated a
  superior, or sacrificed an underling; and for very relief he would launch
  into an expounding of his own scientific philosophy&mdash;a synthesis of the
  practical and theoretical in which, at the higher levels, there was no
  necessary basis of deduction from observed facts, but the mere waving of
  theory, like antennae, to set a course for later experimentation and possible
  discovery. The mathematician, he was fond of saying, could construct a field
  theory for the unknowable as well as the unknown; and he was also fond of a
  quotation from (of all persons) G.K. Chesterton to the effect that "the
  difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet tries to
  get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to get the
  heavens into his head." Good, Framm commented, except that there was no
  fundamental difference between the two behaviors, and he would scribble some
  half-impish equation on the blackboard to illustrate.</p>

  <p>Brad's habit was to do his own experimental work mostly in the mornings;
  but later in the day, when he had his graphs and computations to assemble, he
  would move into a world of pure symbol-expression; and sometimes then a
  curious trancelike ecstasy would take possession of him, an ecstasy that
  Framm's hand on his shoulder did not disturb.</p>

  <p>What <i>was</i> disturbing, whenever he was outside his own workroom, was
  the whole bludgeoning atmosphere of Nazi domination during that last year
  before the outbreak of war. He was in Berlin during the period after Munich,
  and on a March day in 1939 he heard Chamberlain's Birmingham speech over
  Framm's special radio. When the storm troopers marched into Prague and Memel,
  Framm's exultation had been unbounded. Brad realized that beneath the skin of
  derision which was no more than a privately intellectual arrogance, Framm was
  a perfect Nazi. That <i>Quatschkopf,</i> as he put it, had been inspired
  again. Presently there would be moves on Danzig, then Poland. The European
  democracies would not fight, because they had no fight left in them. And as
  for America, Framm added contemptuously....</p>

  <p>It was years since Brad had been in his own country, yet Framm's scorn
  took him back in mind immediately. While he saw the towers of Manhattan and
  the wheatfields of the Dakotas, he looked at Framm with the cold answering
  thought: I must do what I have to do and then get going....</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I said I was glad he had felt like that about America. "I'd
been afraid
  you were getting to be the kind of American that Julian once said was like
  some kinds of wine&mdash;they don't travel well...."</p>

  <p>He answered moodily: "I don't know whether I travel well or not, but I
  sometimes wish I hadn't traveled at all. It would have been better fun to
  stay where I was born."</p>

  <p>"And know no more mathematics than I do?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Plus no more politics and history than I do. Then we might both
  have been happy."</p>

  <p>"Together?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "There comes the flaw. I wouldn't even have met you if I
  hadn't traveled."</p>

  <p>"You'd have met somebody else and I'd have met somebody else."</p>

  <p>"But that's exactly what we did. I met Pauli and you met&mdash;oh,
  everybody."</p>

  <p>"Not quite that. But even if I had, I don't know what we can do about it
  now. We're so old."</p>

  <p>"Now you're kidding...."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you're not. You really feel we're aged in the wood and the
  wood's a bit rotten. I don't blame you. I just managed to miss one world
  war&mdash; you've had two. But I had a head start on you by being a
  precocious brat even when I was eighteen."</p>

  <p>"You certainly were. And I was a bit of a prig until...."</p>

  <p>He hesitated and I said laughing: "This sort of confession ought to be
  good for the soul, if a scientist believes in one."</p>

  <p>"And even if he doesn't."</p>

  <p>"I wish I was sure about souls. I wish I knew as little as my mother did
  and understood as much."</p>

  <p>"What made you think of her?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"I often think of her. I miss her more than I ever thought I would. She
  was a darling. You knew her&mdash;you remember what a darling she was."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember." He looked uneasy.</p>

  <p>"But get on with your story. Tell me about Framm&mdash;if you still want
  to."</p>

  <p>I lay back and waited. When he resumed, it was abruptly and faster, as if
  he had got to a part that had to be carried in stride. "Framm often worked at
  night and so did I. We'd have the whole floor practically to ourselves when
  the others had gone home. That of course would provide the opportunity. And
  yet, you know, I wasn't <i>eager</i> in any sense of time&mdash;I mean, it
  didn't have to be today or tomorrow or the next day, provided I knew it was
  going to happen someday. And meanwhile inside our own private world I was
  able to admire and envy his sheer brain stuff more than that of anyone else I
  have ever known, before or since. That's a plain fact and I'll never deny it.
  It hadn't anything to do with <i>liking</i> the man. But at odd moments, when
  a certain quality in his mind revealed itself, I had a feeling that I can
  only call a religious one ... of worship, if you like ... not worship of
  <i>him</i>, for Christ's sake, but of something quite distant, impersonal ...
  the soul, if you like the word, that a scientist believes in. You were
  talking about that just now."</p>

  <p>There was no comment I ventured to make. At length he said roughly: "Do
  you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Partly."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't be surprising if you didn't. Perhaps you think they were right
  to put me in a psychiatric ward. They had their reasons, maybe. If only they
  hadn't kept on watching me all the time, as if I carried the secret of the
  universe in my pocket. Perhaps somebody thought I did and gave them
  orders&mdash; Follow that man, he knows too much, he worked with Framm.... He
  has the magic formula, economy size, made like a doctor's prescription, not
  one ingredient, but several...."</p>

  <p>I could see him becoming excited in a peculiar way, and I thought it bad
  for him. "It's getting late," I said. "Don't you think we ought to start
  back?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, let's go."</p>

  <p>I hated to do that, but above all things I wanted the wild look out of his
  eye. We hoisted our rucksacks and began to trudge down the trail, tiredness
  now in every limb and muscle, so that when we reached the car he slumped
  inside and slept all the way to Vista Grande, while I kept myself awake by
  thinking about him.</p>

  <p>That evening his behavior had that raw edge that made me realize he was
  still in trouble. I don't think my father noticed it, but for me there were
  danger signals in the way he fidgeted and talked. His face, too, carried a
  flush that wasn't sunburn, and when afterwards he quite docilely submitted to
  having his temperature taken I found it was two degrees above normal. It was
  possible, I judged, that the nervous strain of our rock adventure had caused
  this, and I was not especially worried, though I began to wonder what we
  should do if some physical ailment required a doctor. There was my father's
  doctor, who paid a semisocial call every few weeks, but it would be awkward
  to bring him onto the scene. However, in the morning Brad was sleeping hard
  and did not look worse, so I left instructions that he wasn't to be
  disturbed, and then made my own departure to see Mr. Chandos again.</p>

  <p>During the night I had been wakeful for hours. I knew by now that I wanted
  to help Brad far beyond the casual desire I had had at first; I knew also
  that this intention was fixed, unless events or revelations should take some
  quite appalling turn. But most of all I knew I had a quest of my own,
  separate from anything Small might have, because it occurred to me at this
  stage that the killing of Framm might be what was really on Brad's mind; or
  perhaps, I even thought, he had come to a point in his story beyond which he
  didn't know definitely what had happened, since the final act might have
  taken place in one of those trancelike moods he had talked about. Amateur
  psychology, perhaps; but whatever had happened, or how, it seemed to me there
  was one simple step to be taken immediately. So that morning I called at the
  central library in Los Angeles and looked for Framm's name in various
  reference books. I could find no recent information about him; the war years
  had left gaps in the biographies of enemies. But then it occurred to me to
  try a newspaper office; they would have files there, possibly, or some way of
  checking on whether a fairly well-known scientist was or was not still alive.
  I was lucky enough to find a man who had read my book and could think of a
  number of reasons (but not the real one) why I was interested in the matter;
  he was very obliging and assiduous, and in due course brought me the news
  that Hugo Framm was undoubtedly dead, because in one of the books he had
  consulted there was the phrase "after Hugo Framm was killed."</p>

  <p>I'm afraid my face showed shock, so that he added waggishly: "Not a pal of
  yours, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not. Did it happen to say <i>how</i> he was killed?"</p>

  <p>"No, but perhaps I could find out. Is it urgent?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly <i>urgent</i>, but&mdash;well, I could call back in the
  afternoon or perhaps telephone if you think you'd have the information by
  then."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I might. Give me a ring.... How's the picture coming along?"</p>

  <p>Like most Los Angeles journalists he read the <i>Reporter</i> and
  <i>Variety</i>and liked to feel that movie affairs were within a home-town
  gambit; and as I was anxious to undo the effect of the shocked look I
  gossiped a bit and told him I was just about to lunch with Mr. Chandos at the
  Brown Derby to discuss matters. He said he knew Mr. Chandos, who had once
  visited the office in search of background material for a newspaper
  story&mdash;a very fine producer, full of ideas; I was certainly fortunate in
  having him do my picture. (He too called it <i>my</i> picture.)</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, still holding myself casual though with some effort, I
  found myself in a booth at the Brown Derby with Mr. Chandos, who had called
  me Jane as soon as we met at the studio and whom I was trying to think of as
  Paul without immediately being reminded of Pauli. He probably noticed my look
  of preoccupation, for he asked: "What's on your mind?" in a way that wasn't
  quite the conventional opening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, things in general."</p>

  <p>"The war looks like being over pretty soon."</p>

  <p>"I know. And what then?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's the problem. And all the answers you get are gags&mdash;a
  plastic helicopter for every back yard&mdash;soldiers coming home to find
  everything just the same, including Mom's mince pies ... ever read the ads in
  the magazines?"</p>

  <p>"I've even written some of them. But not any more."</p>

  <p>"You with your ad-writing and me with my B pictures. We're a fair
  match.... What are you going to do next? Another book?"</p>

  <p>"Probably&mdash;sometime. At present it's in the air&mdash;like the two-
  million- dollar picture they won't let you make. What would that be about, by
  the way?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "What <i>wouldn't</i> it be about? I keep on getting new
  ideas. I got another one last night, while I was driving home. I live in the
  Valley&mdash;not far out of town, but there's a mile or so of fairly dark
  road before you come to my house. Of course I know every inch of that
  road&mdash;even the holes in the pavement&mdash;but last night, as I was
  driving, I suddenly thought&mdash; What if I <i>don't</i> come to my house?
  Suppose I just drive on, without thinking at first, and then of course the
  thought would soon come to me&mdash;What's happened? Where <i>are</i> you?
  You must have passed your house ... so I stare out of the window, expecting
  to recognize something, but I can't&mdash;it's just a road with trees and
  hedges&mdash;not a house in sight. So&mdash;quite a bit puzzled&mdash;I make
  the turn and drive back. Presently I <i>must</i> come to my house. But I
  still don't. I drive four or five miles&mdash;and the road's still just trees
  and hedges. Now this is beginning to be really queer. Four or five miles from
  my house in any direction would take me to other houses, shops, schools, and
  so on.... Well, there's nothing to do but just go on driving. Maybe I'm on a
  road which, for some quite extraordinary reason, I never knew about before.
  But after ten miles a queer sort of tingling sensation gets into my
  spine&mdash;because there hasn't been a side turning ... and no car has
  either passed or overtaken me, and I know that within a score miles of Los
  Angeles such a thing simply isn't possible! However, I still drive on and
  on&mdash;there <i>must</i> be something soon ... but there
  isn't&mdash;there's nothing but the road&mdash;paved&mdash;white line in the
  middle&mdash;fairly straight and level&mdash;<i>but it doesn't go
  anywhere</i>! And there isn't a light, or a sign, or a mailbox, and in a few
  more miles I shall run out of gas!... So what do I do?"</p>

  <p>"You turn on the car radio," I said.</p>

  <p>"By God, I never thought of that!" He grew suddenly excited. "Yes, I turn
  it on.... But what do I get?... Why, just nothing ... all round the dial.
  Everything's dead. Maybe it's an air-raid warning&mdash;the Hundred and
  Nineteenth Interceptor Command has ordered all stations off the air...."</p>

  <p>"Or else," I said, "you <i>do</i> get something. You get the same thing
  from every station."</p>

  <p>"But <i>what</i>, Jane? Tell me <i>what</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Heatter reading the Hundred and Nineteenth Psalm.... 'Teach me, O
  Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. Give me
  understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my
  whole heart. Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
  delight. Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. Turn
  away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy
  way....'"</p>

  <p>I don't know quite how or why, but as I spoke the words, which I
  remembered from having learned them at school, the thing that had begun as a
  gag became somehow serious, so that my own voice trembled and I saw tears
  come into Paul's eyes. He reached for my hand across the table and presently
  muttered: "Well, I guess there's not much for either of us to say after
  that...."</p>

  <p>We were silent for quite a while and the hubbub of the restaurant rose
  around us into a roar; the place was filling up; flash bulbs were popping at
  personalities; the cartooned faces of famous patrons stared down from the
  four walls.</p>

  <p>I said at length: "I'd like you to meet a friend of mine sometime. He
  reminds me a bit of you."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I'd be glad to."</p>

  <p>"He's not in your line, though. A scientist."</p>

  <p>"That's all right. I've nothing against scientists. Bring him along the
  next time."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I can. He's ill at present. He was in the Air Force and
  crashed.... But I'd like you to meet him sometime."</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>The waiter appeared, carrying a telephone which he plugged in to a near-
  by socket. "For you, Mr. Chandos...."</p>

  <p>He took it, listened a moment, then said: "No, it's for you, Jane."</p>

  <p>"For <i>me</i>? But it can't be. Nobody knows I'm here."</p>

  <p>"Probably someone saw you coming in and thought of a good way to bother
  you&mdash;they do that, you know, in this town.... Shall I handle it for you?
  If it's autographs or interviews I'll stall...." He spoke back into the
  instrument: "Yes?... No, Miss Waring isn't here, but I'll take a
  message&mdash;what is it?... Yes ... yes ... <i>What</i>?... Say that name
  again.... Spell it.... Spell the other name too.... Well, I don't know what
  it's all about, but I'll tell her when I see her.... Okay.... G'by...."</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that Paul Chandos gave me the details about Hugo
  Framm's death, and though he was obviously curious, he was tactful enough not
  to ask a single question. I liked him more than ever for that.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I got back to Vista Grande during the late afternoon and
found Brad
  sitting by the pool. He looked tired, which wasn't remarkable after our
  previous day's exploit; and there was still the look in his eyes which I
  didn't like. I thought I had best get to the point quickly. "Brad," I said.
  "I found out what happened to Hugo Framm. He was killed in a British air raid
  on Peenem&uuml;nde in 1944."</p>

  <p>He didn't look surprised. He said: "I knew that. At least we were told so
  at Oak...." He stopped. "Oakland.... I was there when I heard about it.
  Peenem&uuml;nde's the place on the Baltic where the Germans had their experimental
  station for V-2S. That wasn't much in his line. God, what fools they were,
  not to give him a free hand. Drop all the theoretical stuff&mdash;that was
  the cry at the beginning. Then afterwards it was too late to catch up. He
  probably fought them as long as he could, but I guess he didn't win. He made
  too many enemies."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't kill him."</p>

  <p>"No, I left that for the R.A.F. I told him a lie instead, which certainly
  killed him in one sense if it sent him to Peenem&uuml;nde. But perhaps it
  didn't&mdash;so much could have happened in the interval. But I do know
  Peenem&uuml;nde wasn't where he should have been. It was some other place&mdash;in
  Norway&mdash;where they were making heavy water."</p>

  <p>"Heavy water?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "That was his idea all along if they'd given him a free hand."
  He added, changing the subject with marked abruptness: "By the way, Newby
  called this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"What did he want?"</p>

  <p>"To look me over. To see how I was getting on. To hear if I'd had any more
  dreams. Perhaps to see you if you'd been in. I told him I still dreamed of
  being a skywriter but I'd changed the word I wanted to write. I spelled it
  out for him. It was a German word that Framm used a lot&mdash;not a nice word
  at all. Newby didn't know that, but when he gets back he's going to ask
  someone who understands German and that'll fix him for a while. I think of
  the darnedest ways to keep that man interested, don't I?"</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't," I said. "It isn't worth wasting time on."</p>

  <p>"What else should I waste time on while I'm waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Waiting for what?"</p>

  <p>"Something we're all waiting for."</p>

  <p>"Something good, I hope."</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>I said: "It may be very trite and old-fashioned of me, but what I'm
  waiting for is the end of the war&mdash;victory and peace&mdash;all
  that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think we'll get them?"</p>

  <p>"We'll get victory."</p>

  <p>"But not peace?"</p>

  <p>"Depends. We shall see."</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what you think we shall see."</p>

  <p>He said glumly: "Maybe a bad word written in the sky."</p>

  <p>I sat down next to him; he was in swimming trunks and had been in the
  pool, because the towel near him was damp. His body (which I had never seen
  so near nude before) was slim and muscular, though he could well have taken
  on a few more pounds. The desert air had browned him, the mountain air was
  now adding a clear gloss. He looked fine, except for his eyes, which offered
  a minority report on his general recovery.</p>

  <p>I asked what the lie was he had told Framm.</p>

  <p>He replied: "Call it twice two are five."</p>

  <p>"If you say things like that I shall bring out a mathematics textbook and
  ask you to give me lessons."</p>

  <p>That made him laugh. I didn't like the laugh either. And I didn't like the
  thought that Newby had been around. I suddenly felt a deep urgency in what
  was beginning to dominate me&mdash;I must find out what was on his mind
  quickly ... before it was too late. The idea of no time to be wasted came to
  me unarguably, yet with frightening sureness.</p>

  <p>He began to talk about the work he and Framm had been busy on in Berlin
  until the outbreak of the war. It was concerned with the mathematics of
  nuclear structure; the construction of a field theory to account for certain
  phenomena already noted experimentally; but also, if the theory were correct,
  to point the way to phenomena <i>that had not yet been observed</i>, because
  adequate experimental technique lagged behind. The theoretical work had been
  in progress for months, with Framm giving it all the time he could spare, and
  Brad with him as an equal, except that he saved Framm's time by doing all the
  laborious computations. There was nothing remarkable in the apparent slowness
  of the procedure, but to some of the high-up Nazis it was hard to explain or
  defend. They lacked sympathy with anything so unproductive; visionary stuff
  was not truly Germanic; Hitler was planning for a short war, and a single new
  weapon in the blueprint stage was worth a whole territory of long-range
  speculation.</p>

  <p>Then events moved fast on all sides. The Danzig crisis boiled up into the
  actual imminence of war, which meant that the intrigues of Framm's rivals to
  have his department reorganized under a more "practical" head rose to an
  equal climax. And also ... something stirred inside the private world of
  experiment and visionary analysis, so that Hugo Framm and his assistant began
  to discuss, like conspirators, the chance that they were on the edge of
  something big&mdash; something that would not only widen the scope of
  theoretical knowledge, but could in due course affect the practical character
  of life on earth. As scientists they were intensely skeptical of all such
  dreaming, yet as humans they could not forbear to tiptoe a few paces into the
  unguessable, just far enough to send them back to work with rueful anxiety.
  For the thing was not even yet at a beginning&mdash;it was only at the
  beginning of a beginning. In those talks with Brad, Framm revealed the
  curious division of his soul. Part of him, perhaps the deeper part, was the
  pure researcher, impatient of other people's impatience, willing to devote
  years to an inch's extension of the mind's territory, willing even for that
  inch itself to be unknown to all save the few initiates. Never had Brad heard
  him trounce more scathingly the "practical" scientists who had grown to high
  favor with the regime by setting teams of underling scientists to work on
  some immediate problem of industry. <i>Engineers</i>, he sneered. "One of
  these days you and I will write all we have discovered on the back of an old
  envelope and send it to them. In a few years they will begin to learn what it
  is all about. Then after a few more years Siemens will be interested in the
  patent rights. And meanwhile you and I will still be fighting those who would
  close down this laboratory and turn it into a gymnasium for teaching storm
  troopers how to crack skulls."</p>

  <p>That repeated "you and I" gave Brad a feeling that was not a qualm, but a
  nudge of reminder inside himself. "So we must continue our work," Framm went
  on. "One of these days the world will wake up to what we have done."</p>

  <p>Brad did not care for this sort of magniloquence. "The world won't do
  anything of the sort," he said. "A few scientists in other countries will
  read about it in the technical journals and you'll probably be asked to
  deliver some lectures."</p>

  <p>"You are forgetting there will be no communication with foreign scientists
  during the war."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they'll manage to exchange ideas through Sweden or Switzerland
  somehow or other."</p>

  <p>"Not this time." Framm was emphatic. "There is already the rule of secrecy
  in operation."</p>

  <p>"But surely that doesn't apply to mathematics."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it doesn't, but perhaps also it should and must."</p>

  <p>"If it did, then don't forget I'm foreign myself."</p>

  <p>Framm put on the roguish smile that was the sign of an approaching display
  of charm, but which Brad had learned to recognize as less charming in what it
  often concealed or preluded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we shall have to make a German citizen of you then.... Or perhaps
  since you are American it does not matter. Americans have no ambition to
  conquer."</p>

  <p>"What's that got to do with it? Why should they? Why should anybody?"</p>

  <p>"I think I must prepare a number of answers to your question, Bradley. But
  the argument should be at Berchtesgaden, not here. It would be interesting to
  demonstrate that by a proper application of quantum mathematics Germany can
  become the first master of the world."</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing ought to appeal&mdash;at Berchtesgaden," Brad said
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but only if it could be done in six months. That man is obsessed with
  <i>Blitzkrieg</i>. You have no idea how impossible it is to talk to him of
  serious matters. Planck could not. Haushofer could not. Anything that he
  cannot understand is no use, and he can understand so little. He has pushed
  his luck too far. Bradley, there are times when the second-rate mind is
  criminal. And there are things that history will not forgive unless they are
  done once only to achieve world conquest. The end can only justify the means
  if the end is large enough."</p>

  <p>"You see world conquest as a real possibility?"</p>

  <p>"Provided other countries are not already ahead of us in these matters.
  And provided our <i>Quatschkopf</i> can be persuaded to look further than the
  end of one of his long howitzers."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think the world would gain by being under German
  domination?"</p>

  <p>"Bradley, I think there must be a world order if there is to be any world
  worth living in. I can see no possibility of world order unless it is imposed
  on those who would be too selfish or too stupid to submit voluntarily. I can
  think of no country with both the power and the will to perform this task but
  Germany.... And Germany is now at the mercy of a crystal-gazer!"</p>

  <p>He seemed after that to regret having been so outspoken, and there was a
  barrier between them, as if he could sense in Brad's attitude some new
  dimension of hostility.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dan brought us cocktails and Brad said: "Dan, these are
always so good.
  Where did you learn to make them like this?"</p>

  <p>"In San Francisco," Dan replied. "I used to mix drinks at the Seacomber
  bar there."</p>

  <p>"Ever been in Houston?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. You wouldn't get a drink like this in any bar in Texas. They
  don't sell hard liquor."</p>

  <p>After he had gone, Brad said: "I keep on thinking I've seen Dan somewhere
  before.... Maybe not.... Where was I?"</p>

  <p>I said: "You were telling me what Framm said about Germany."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes.... Well, I decided then there was no more time to waste. The
  truth was, I'd been postponing things because I'd been so damned interested
  in the work we'd been doing."</p>

  <p>He sipped at the drink and looked at me over the rim of the glass. "Would
  you want any more proof?"</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the state of my mind. How I hated that man and loved the work I did
  with him. I hated him more than I'd ever hated anybody&mdash;more than I'd
  ever loved Pauli, for that matter."</p>

  <p>"How can you compare love and hate?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, I don't know, but you can." He went on: "He was away, out of
  Berlin, wrangling as usual with the big shots. So I didn't get any
  chances.... I think I told you before that we often worked all night, when
  the building was practically empty&mdash;only janitors and guards who knew us
  well and never came near.... But he was <i>away</i>.... You see how it
  was?"</p>

  <p>I caught the rising excitement in his eyes; I said quietly: "Yes, I
  see."</p>

  <p>"Actually, he did go to Berchtesgaden, though I didn't learn that till
  later. Everything was racing to a climax. The British were threatening war if
  Poland were attacked. Framm's personal enemies were closing in on
  him&mdash;he was in the doghouse, the way it looked. Mostly his own
  fault&mdash;too many tricks and treacheries had caught up with him. But it
  was also the war emergency that put him in a real spot&mdash;because the
  mounting hue and cry was for less theory, more practice&mdash;for results
  certain and immediate, not distant and problematical. That gave his enemies
  just the weapon they needed, so that his last chance became his only
  chance&mdash;to sell some enormous novelty in the very highest market, and
  entirely on trust. If he could pull it off it would be a master stroke, but
  from the point of view of sober science, it was all far too premature. Some
  of our earlier checks had been encouraging, but there was a crucial one still
  to come. I was working on that while Framm was at Berchtesgaden, or perhaps I
  should rather say on <i>those</i> because it included a statistical analysis
  of all the checks. Nothing absolutely accurate was either expected or
  conceivable, but 95 per cent would be encouraging, 80 per cent would leave us
  still in doubt, and less than 70 would put us back where we'd been before we
  started. It was an especially delicate part of our calculations that was
  involved&mdash;something speculative and&mdash;if you can imagine that in
  mathematics&mdash;a bit <i>inspired</i>. I've been trying to think of a
  rather wild parallel&mdash;not to the thing itself&mdash;but to the kind of
  wild-goose chase it was. Suppose that by sheer chance in reading a certain
  chapter of the Bible you discovered that the forty-ninth word from the
  beginning was "Shake" and the forty-ninth word from the end was "spear."
  Suppose some mad genius told you that this wasn't a coincidence, but a secret
  clue to the meaning of the universe provided you could find other poets'
  names embedded similarly in other books. Suppose you were crazy enough to
  try, by picking up books and counting words at random in a public library.
  Then suppose some even madder genius offered a formula for taking you
  directly to a certain page of a certain book on a certain shelf. So you tried
  it, and there, counting up and down, you found the words 'bitter' and 'nut.'
  But you'd never heard of a poet called Bitternut&mdash; his name wasn't in
  any of the encyclopedias&mdash;maybe he was only a very minor poet indeed....
  Does all that sound <i>too</i> fantastic?"</p>

  <p>"Probably less so than the mathematics would."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow, it was the sort of question I'd got as far as&mdash;How
  much of a poet was Mr. Bitternut? Was he even a poet at all? All night I
  tried to find out, alternating between the laboratory and my office desk,
  assembling the results and fitting them into place. I was very
  tired&mdash;I'd been on the job, more or less, for two days and two nights. I
  hadn't even gone back to my rooms in Wilmersdorf, but had snatched a few
  intermittent hours of sleep on the couch in Framm's office. And meanwhile, if
  I looked through the window, I could see ominous signs of
  events&mdash;armored cars rattling by, men in field-gray scampering along the
  pavements. The radio, whenever I turned it on, gave fresh news of the crisis,
  instructions for mobilization, rationing, air-raid precautions. It was all
  cold and efficient, with no jubilant crowds, cheers, or flag waving. Never,
  it seemed to me, had a country moved to war with less enthusiasm&mdash;yet
  the lack of it had its own peculiarly frightening quality. During the evening
  the sirens shrieked and a few minutes later a rather agitated janitor rushed
  into the room to order me to the air-raid shelter in the basement. I told the
  old man I'd rather stay where I was, I was very busy&mdash;which wasn't
  bravery, by the way, but just my own guess that it could only be either a
  false alarm or a practice drill. The janitor finally compromised by saying I
  could stay there provided I put out all the electric lights. I said all
  right, I could work by candlelight. So I did, and when he'd gone, with the
  city blacking out all round me, I ate a sandwich and drank some cold coffee.
  Then I got down to the job again. Within an hour, I reckoned, I should have
  pushed the results to a point where success or failure could be tentatively
  applied to the work of many months. The calculations were not only fairly
  difficult, but extremely laborious. Towards four o'clock (I had been too
  optimistic in my forecasting) I came to the last calculation. It was one in
  which two sets of figures, neither of them predictable,
  should&mdash;according to the theory&mdash;bear an algebraic relationship;
  the final process was the plotting of positions on a graph. As the minutes
  passed and I got closer to what I knew must be the finish, I couldn't have
  imagined anything in the world more dramatic than my own solitary behavior in
  that lonely room, working by candlelight in the middle of the night at the
  outbreak of a world war&mdash;and yet I suppose most people would have
  reckoned it, compared with events outside, a very dull business. Even by
  technical standards it didn't look much of a climax. There were no color
  changes on litmus paper, no test tubes held up to the light, no retorts
  bubbling over Bunsen burners, none of the rigmarole of magazine-ad science
  ... even the X-ray machine, which usually made noises, had been switched off
  into silence. All I had to do was to sit at a desk and put a few pencil
  points on paper. I did so, then joined them up to make a curve. The curve
  bulged to a position that gave a reading, by a prefigured scale, of three-
  point-five-seven-five-five; the predictable reading, based on theory alone,
  had been three-point-five-five-nine-three. It was near enough. Mr. Bitternut
  was a poet."</p>

  <p>He drank the rest of his cocktail at a gulp, but waved away any more.
  Presently he continued: "When I realized what this amounted to, the word
  success did come, but it had a strange sound, almost like a sound without
  meaning. What I chiefly felt was an overwhelming weariness, both of mind and
  body. I gave myself a shot of Framm's brandy and lay down on his couch. I
  must have slept instantly, for when I woke there was dawn at the edge of the
  window blinds. I had not heard the 'all clear' sirens even if there had been
  any. I crossed the room to look down at the street; there was a line of
  trucks and armored cars parked outside the building and knots of men were
  gathered about. I turned on the radio; the voices of announcers, full of
  their ghastly tired eagerness, were repeating old news, but it was new to me:
  that the German Army was already far across the Polish frontier; war had
  begun.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that was a turning point of my life&mdash;a moment of complete
  flux, when I might have done almost anything if one of a number of impulses
  had been a mite stronger&mdash;perhaps if I had had a few drops more brandy,
  or even a few drops less. If Framm had returned exactly then I think I should
  have killed him somehow or other&mdash;and been promptly caught, tried,
  sentenced, and hanged. An American spy, they'd probably have said&mdash;not a
  real scientist at all. I thought of that as I stared down at the street, and
  then the thought came to me- -supposing that was what I had been, all along,
  would Framm have suspected it? But of course America doesn't have
  spies&mdash;or didn't have then. We were so God- damned innocent in those
  days. We'd debunked the First World War so thoroughly that it was hard to
  believe in another&mdash;much easier to sell scrap to Japan and at the same
  time blame the munition makers.... I won't try to tell you all the thoughts
  that ran riot in my mind, while every now and then the announcer on the radio
  would say '<i>Achtung</i>' and give out an emergency instruction about
  something or other ... that word echoed inside me like a bell tolling ...
  <i>Achtung ... Achtung</i>....</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was only five or ten minutes in that condition, but it seemed a
  long while, and then all at once it came to me that there was only one thing
  I could do, in Framm's absence, and now indeed <i>because</i> of Framm's
  absence. It was something very quiet, involving no one else, and it was also
  something no one else could do. But it would take time, perhaps not less than
  several hours, and whether I should have that much time I could not forecast.
  So there was the need to begin immediately and not stop till it was either
  finished or interrupted."</p>

  <p>"And forget about killing him?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Private revenge would only have got in the way of what I
  intended to do. Don't you see, he <i>trusted</i> me&mdash;and that was more
  essential to what I now planned than his death could ever have been. I wanted
  him to <i>live</i>&mdash;and to go on trusting me for a while longer. Viewed
  against that, my original desire to kill him seemed almost like a sort of
  self- indulgence&mdash;like putting my own affairs first. The enemy I really
  hated wasn't to be countered by any personal vendetta, and the hate I had
  wasn't sharp and emotional, but glum and also rather limitless. That was the
  mood I was in as I set to work. First I assembled all the results on the desk
  before me. They were roughly penciled with many erasures already; this helped
  rather than hindered. Framm had never looked them over; he had had (and it
  was ironic now to think of it) implicit confidence in my ability to do the
  job, and there was also a certain basic laziness in him that made it tempting
  to hand work to others. He had never checked where another type of man might
  have been concerned to do so, and he had been far too busy lately, fighting
  his battles with the authorities, to acquaint himself with even a minimum of
  detail. All this made it less difficult to do what I set out to do. It took
  me just over two hours. By the time the sun was hot on that early September
  morning there was a collection of rough notes, computations, and graphs, in
  perfect shape for him to examine. But the end-result now was a reading of
  two-point-one-three- four-eight. Not near enough any more.</p>

  <p>"When I had written it down I was not only utterly exhausted but
  also&mdash; and this is a confession&mdash;I had a deep depression of spirit.
  It was so different from anything I had ever felt before that I tried to
  analyze it in my mind; it could not be remorse, because I had accomplished my
  purpose, and I was tremendously relieved at having been lucky enough to have
  the chance. And yet I felt worse, not better, for having done something I did
  not regret. It was as if I had committed the sin I always puzzled over when I
  was a small boy at Sunday School&mdash;I puzzled over it because I didn't
  know what it was, and for that reason I suspected that, like most sins, it
  must be something pleasant to do even if one were wicked for doing it. But
  now it occurred to me as something exactly the opposite&mdash;it was
  <i>horrible</i> to do, even if, in this particular instance, it was
  justifiable. It was the sin against the Holy Ghost, if one believed in
  science as I did, and as Framm did too, with one part of his damned
  schizophrenic soul."</p>

  <p>The dinner bell sounded from the house. "Don't bother," I said. "My father
  isn't coming down, so it can wait as long as we like."</p>

  <p>"Why isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He's not too well. I suppose when you've had a stroke you never really
  get completely better."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes you do."</p>

  <p>"Not at his age."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's old, isn't he?... Much older, I remember, than your mother
  was."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He was moody for a moment, then said: "Let's have dinner, though. I've
  talked enough."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know what happened when Framm came back. I suppose he
  did?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll tell you afterwards&mdash;if we can come out here again."</p>

  <p>"We'll have coffee here. It'll still be warm. You could even bathe again
  if you wanted to."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He went off to change, and we dined alone, talking little
while Dan was
  around. Not that there was anything special that mustn't be overheard, or so
  it seemed to me; but I had noticed before that suspicion was deep-sunk in his
  general attitude towards people and circumstances&mdash;doubtless part of the
  snarl of phobias and complexes that made up what was wrong with him. And in
  the dining room, so full of shadows and dark perspectives, his unease was
  very noticeable. It lifted a little afterwards, when we sat by the pool
  again. The air was still warm&mdash;even warmer than sometimes during the
  day, for the breeze came from the long valley, full of earth scents. A small
  moon curved over a hill and lit the edge of it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Brad went on:</p>

  <p>... I was asleep when Framm arrived, about ten o'clock on that September
  morning, but the commotion he made woke me. He had the radio on at full force
  so that he could hear it as he moved from room to room. As soon as I saw him
  I knew he was in a mood that would make it easier for me. The war news, or
  else the trip to Berchtesgaden, had brought out the <i>Junker</i> stuff in
  him&mdash;he was Prussian-born though he had lived most of his life in
  Vienna. And his mood had a peculiar way of showing this in his movements;
  when the <i>Junker</i> superseded the scientist, he seemed to stiffen to a
  height of a few extra inches and his walk became quick and military. At other
  times he would stoop and amble; it was an extraordinary phenomenon of
  change&mdash;as if he felt a need to dramatize something that went on inside
  him.</p>

  <p>He did not tell me whether he had seen the man whom he sometimes called
  "our <i>Quatschkopf</i>." But he radiated an impression that his mission had
  been well worth while, that he had done much of what he wanted to do, and had
  prepared the way for more. That also&mdash;his air of mystery and
  secrecy&mdash;was part of the transformation; he did not confide at such
  times, but snapped out minimum facts like communiqu&eacute;s. So now I got only part
  of a story. I didn't care. It was better for me not to have him put his arm
  on my shoulder and say: "Well, how goes it, Bradley? Have we yet found out
  what makes the universe tick, or only the philosopher's stone?" But now he
  just said: "Been working? Not finished yet? We've got to hurry."</p>

  <p>I said: "It's finished. The results are on your desk."</p>

  <p>He picked up the papers, briskly but without apparent excitement, merely
  muttering: "I think they will show that I am right." For a moment then the
  sick depression came over me afresh. His whole attitude was a mixture of
  something superb and something arrogant, and at the last moment of all, with
  a touch of the inconsequent that so often intrudes, he couldn't find his
  glasses&mdash;he wondered if he had left them on the plane, or if he had a
  spare pair at his house. "Well, tell me, tell me," he said irritably. "I
  can't read without them...."</p>

  <p>So I told him. "It doesn't work out," I said. "The bulge is in the wrong
  place."</p>

  <p>He glared at me, and for an incredible second I wondered if he could read
  in my eyes what I had done; but I knew that without his glasses he couldn't
  even see me properly. The sudden fierceness was just the Prussianism, the
  age- old barbarian reaction to the bearer of bad news. He banged his fist on
  the desk. "So it is in the wrong place, eh? And it could not have happened at
  a worse time! No&mdash;not in a century!"</p>

  <p>Behind him on the blackboard were a number of equations connected with the
  general plan of the work we had been doing. He swung round to give them a
  stare that lasted several moments, then in an access of rage seized the
  duster and wiped the rows of chalked symbols into a smudge. "Very well ...
  since these are our mistakes, the truth must lie elsewhere." It was clear
  that any idea of doubting the accuracy of my calculations had not even
  remotely entered his mind- -which was in a way dreadful, and yet exactly what
  I had hoped. "But I shall find it," he muttered angrily, as if even the truth
  were capable of yielding to threats.</p>

  <p>That gave me my chance to say: "I'm afraid I shan't be able to help you in
  it, Dr. Framm. The war makes it necessary for me to return to America."</p>

  <p>He seemed hardly interested. "Oh it does, does it? When do you want to
  go?"</p>

  <p>"Immediately."</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>I left his office a few minutes later. At the doorway as we shook hands he
  turned on the charm for a few seconds, but it was tired and semiautomatic; I
  could see his mind was elsewhere. "Of course you are deserting me," he said,
  but that too was automatic, just one of his numerous attitudes, posing as a
  martyr when he was in no position to play the tyrant. I had seen it work so
  often, but now there was nothing for it to work on ... and it was hardly a
  wasted effort because it was not even an effort.</p>

  <p>I gathered up the few personal things that were in my own laboratory and
  then went down the slow elevator for the last time. And I never saw Framm
  again.</p>

  <p>But an odd thing happened that same afternoon as I was leaving the
  American Express office. I ran into a biochemist named Muller, whom I had
  sometimes chatted with in the corridors of the Institut&mdash;a quiet decent
  fellow who disliked Framm and had often expressed surprise that I apparently
  got on so well with him. I told him I was leaving Germany and he said: "I'm
  very glad&mdash; for your sake. It will save you a good deal of trouble." He
  then told me that the war crisis had generated a good deal of feeling against
  foreigners working on scientific projects, and Framm, he added, had recently
  thrown out hints that he considered me not altogether "reliable," and that he
  had been "watching" me for some time.</p>

  <p>This threw me into a mood of near-panic, coming when it did; and for a
  moment it seemed to me an example of special villainy on Framm's part, until
  I reminded myself that my own behavior and intentions, if he had suspected
  them, would have amply justified him. Actually, however, though I did not
  decide this till long after I had left Germany, I don't think Framm suspected
  me at all, ever, or of anything. I think he <i>trusted</i>
  me&mdash;personally as well as professionally. I think he found me a willing
  and occasionally able slave, and was ready to use me as long as possible, but
  he was also preparing an alibi for himself, in case the antiforeign feeling
  should increase. All this would have been exactly like him, for I had seen
  him do the same sort of thing to others far more innocent than I was....</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"So it was a good thing you didn't kill him," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't have had much chance to get away with it if what Muller
  said was true."</p>

  <p>"I think you got away with quite enough, if it prevented his success in
  whatever it was he was trying to do."</p>

  <p>"Don't exaggerate. In itself it was a very minor piece of sabotage. What,
  if anything, it prevented or delayed, nobody can ever say exactly. Perhaps
  very little. The Germans were often so stupid that no outside assistance
  could have made them blunder more than they did." He added, as if eager to
  leave the issue: "There's an ironic little anticlimax to file away with the
  rest. Just before I left Berlin I went to the bank to close my account. My
  weekly salary had come that morning and though I couldn't take money out of
  Germany I thought it might buy something on the train trip. But when I tried
  to cash it I found it had already been stopped.... Now that's what I call
  attention to detail. It must have been one of the first things he did after I
  left ... perhaps the <i>very</i>first. I couldn't help laughing, right there
  at the bank counter. To think that after the wrong figures I'd given Framm
  the wrong one he gave me was only on a check!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That was the night, after the talk, when I was wakened by
hearing a
  scream; I sat up in bed to listen and it came again. It didn't sound like
  Brad, but immediately I thought of him, and when I got outside his door he
  screamed again, so I knew. But it still didn't sound much like him. I went in
  and shook him; he was in a state of complete nervous terror; I had never seen
  anything quite like it. When he was properly awake he mastered himself and
  began to apologize, but the sweat still gathered beads on his face. I told
  him it didn't matter, nobody else had been disturbed, and only I because I
  was a light sleeper.</p>

  <p>He kept on saying he was sorry.</p>

  <p>"Brad, <i>will</i> you forget it?... I don't mind a bit. Is there anything
  you'd like? Some coffee?... I could go down and make it.... Or would you like
  me to get a book and read here till you go to sleep again?"</p>

  <p>He said if I would just stay for a little while without a book or
  bothering with coffee.... "I'll be all right. It's happened before. It's not
  important provided nobody else thinks it's important.... Did I
  <i>say</i>anything?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Say</i> anything?"</p>

  <p>"Was I talking ... when you came in?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>He eyed me sharply. "But you'd say that even if I had been, wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He saw me wondering if I would have; that made him laugh a little.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he went on. "It's just one of the things I'm up against. The
  feeling that everybody's watching me all the time, listening to me when I'm
  asleep ... hoping I'll have a nightmare and spill something."</p>

  <p>"Was it a nightmare, Brad?"</p>

  <p>"Sort of."</p>

  <p>"About flying?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What then? Or don't you want to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I'd tell you if I could. Maybe it was too much of that wonderful fish
  chowder at dinner."</p>

  <p>"Or too much Framm after dinner."</p>

  <p>He smiled nervously. "We're through with him now, anyway.... So he was
  killed at Peenem&uuml;nde."</p>

  <p>"You said you knew."</p>

  <p>"We ... I ... yes, I had that information. But one couldn't be sure. I
  suppose they got proof after Germany collapsed."</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment; then he said thoughtfully: "I wonder if the
  bastard was brave ... at the end. Probably. But physical bravery's a swindle.
  The worst people can have it&mdash;yet you like them for it ... more than you
  like screamers in the middle of the night."</p>

  <p>"You know what you're asking for when you say that."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"An argument, Brad. If bravery's the opposite of screaming in the night,
  then <i>what is it you're afraid of</i>?"</p>

  <p>He answered moodily: "I'm not afraid <i>of</i> anything. I'm afraid
  <i>for</i>something. I'm afraid for the whole bloody world."</p>

  <p>I waited for him to add to that, but he shook his head in what I took to
  be an advance refusal of any of the possible questions I hadn't yet asked. I
  said at length, cheerfully: "Anyhow, it wasn't about flying."</p>

  <p>"No, not this time. And I've an idea about that&mdash;or rather it was
  your idea. Maybe I <i>should</i> go up again?"</p>

  <p>"You would? Oh, that would be fine&mdash;when would you like to? There
  ought to be a place where we could rent something."</p>

  <p>"Not so easy these days."</p>

  <p>"We'll find out."</p>

  <p>"You mean you'd go up with me?"</p>

  <p>"Why not if you can fly? You said you could."</p>

  <p>He hugged me as much as he could in the positions we were in; he was
  leaning up in bed, I was sitting on the edge of it. "You'd trust me as much
  as that?"</p>

  <p>"That isn't so much."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but surely...."</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "I'd hate you to think me <i>too</i> trusting. I fly a
  bit myself. I think I could land a dual-control if you got scared."</p>

  <p>"Of course that spoils it all." But he was smiling again.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, it just makes it sensible. I'm quite serious about it if you
  are."</p>

  <p>There was a book on his bedside table that had a map of California; we
  measured a rough line a hundred and fifty miles inland, for the seaward side
  of that was forbidden to private flying in wartime. We figured it could not
  be more than fifty or sixty miles from where we were to the nearest likely
  flying ground we could use; that would be in the desert somewhere. "Or the
  mountains," he said, studying the map.</p>

  <p>"Except that it wouldn't be too safe over mountains. Those small planes
  don't go higher than eight or nine thousand. And there are downdrafts."</p>

  <p>"You've done some real flying, then?"</p>

  <p>"A few hours solo&mdash;in the East."</p>

  <p>He began to talk technicalities, and if anyone had been listening at the
  door it must have sounded a rather teen-age conversation. I left him after
  about half an hour; we were both sleepy by then.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The days that followed had a degree of eventfulness that
made them
  timeless. I suppose there are only a few weeks in every century when the
  accumulated stresses of years break through to absolute flash point. July of
  1945 was like that. The Okinawa battle was over; the great fire raids on
  Japanese cities had begun. A total end of the war looked near, and then
  nearer.</p>

  <p>In my own life the pattern of California sun and sky slipped over the
  days. They were not without happenings. My father had another slight
  stroke&mdash; not more serious than the first, but cumulative in its effect.
  He did not now leave his room, and there were nurses in attendance; he
  regained part of the lost ground but it was clear he would never recover
  completely. I did what I could to cheer him up, but it was little enough. He
  spoke with a slur, like someone at pains to conceal the effects of drink; and
  he was sad about himself, with moods of reminiscence that took him back to
  old times and places. He pondered a great deal about his will, in which (he
  said) I was the chief legatee. There were relatives of my mother's in England
  (he also said) to whom he had left less than he had once intended, because
  now he didn't want much of his money to go out of America. (Could this be
  patriotism?) But surely, I argued, with lend-lease at the rate of millions a
  day what difference could it make? But no, it wasn't that; it was the new
  English Labour government. He didn't like them. He remembered once meeting
  Attlee&mdash;he hadn't thought much of him. And as for that fellow Strachey
  whom they had made Food Minister&mdash;a most peculiar person, he had met him
  also once, and there was a portrait of him in the Tate Gallery with a beard
  and very long legs lolling in a wicker chair. Fancy a man like that being
  given a ministry!</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of <i>Lytton</i> Strachey," I said. "He's dead. The Food
  Minister's another Strachey...." I had to convince him of that.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow," he said, "England's changing. They wouldn't like me there
  any more. I remember poor old Neville Chamberlain saying the last time I saw
  him, that was in January 1939...."</p>

  <p>He was always poor old Neville Chamberlain to my father, perhaps because
  he too had been disappointed....</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Small telephoned once. What was happening? Anything?
Was it worth
  while yet for us to have another meeting? How <i>was</i> he? Had I anything
  special I wanted to convey?</p>

  <p>I said no; he was all right; we were taking walks; there was no need for a
  meeting yet.</p>

  <p>"You think you're getting anything out of him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know quite what you're expecting...."</p>

  <p>"Get all you can, whether it's what we expect or not."</p>

  <p>I didn't like the way he said that, or maybe it was the telephone voice
  that sounded more strident than it really was. Yet I couldn't think of any
  sufficiently challenging reply, so I just waited in silence till he
  exclaimed: "Hello ... hello ... what's the matter? Are you there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "I'm still here."</p>

  <p>I was childish enough to think that would confuse him but seemingly it
  didn't. He merely said: "Well, I'm not going to bother you, but do remember
  he's not simply on holiday. Taking long walks and climbing mountains is all
  right, but ... oh well, never mind. We'll give you a bit more time, but if
  nothing happens we'll have to have him back."</p>

  <p>"<i>Back</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. He's not well yet by any means. Newby wanted a lot of convincing
  before he'd agree to the experiment, and if it doesn't work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I interrupted: "I think it will work. Give me another week. I'll call you
  then."</p>

  <p>"No, I'll call you. Or else one of us will come up and see him....</p>

  <p>"Okay, then. Good-by."</p>

  <p>As I hung up the receiver one decision was already made in my mind. Brad
  must get discharged from that hospital. I hadn't an idea how I could expedite
  this, but there were doubtless things I could do or help him do for
  himself.</p>

  <p>As I walked away from the library table something else occurred to me,
  quite icily. I didn't think I had ever said anything at all to Mr. Small
  about mountain climbing. Or had I? And if I hadn't, how had he known? And had
  his slip, if it were one, been accidental, or deliberately to intimidate?</p>

  <p>I told myself that the spy business was catching, that the imagined eye
  and ear at every keyhole was the most diabolical softener-up of everything
  gutlike in one's brain and personality; all the more reason, then, why Brad
  should free himself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And I lunched again with Paul Chandos. This time it was I
who noticed that
  <i>he</i> was preoccupied. I asked if he were worrying about the picture.</p>

  <p>He said no.</p>

  <p>"That's good. I hate to ask you, because you never mention it&mdash;but of
  course I'm a bit interested in how it's coming along."</p>

  <p>"Fine. I'm halfway through."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The writing, I mean. I'm what they call a writer-producer."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;you mean&mdash;you've already got a story?"</p>

  <p>"A sort of one, though I may change it. The main thing is, I've got a
  character."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"You."</p>

  <p>He went on hastily: "I didn't intend to tell you yet, but I don't suppose
  it matters. I think you're a rather remarkable person. Your whole book is
  really about you&mdash;not egotistically, that's what's so good&mdash;but
  because you're real. You're real in the book. And now that I know you
  actually, I know that you're <i>really</i> real."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get it. You mean that these meetings we've been having have
  been just to study me, as it were ... like sittings for a portrait
  painter?"</p>

  <p>"At first I thought they were, but I've enjoyed them so much that...." And
  he suddenly leaned forward across the table. "I don't know how you
  feel&mdash;I don't know if you even like me, though I know we look at things
  the same way ... so many things.... Incidentally, are you&mdash;by any
  chance&mdash;engaged&mdash;or tied up to anyone?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said, doubtfully. And because I wanted to spare him whatever he
  might be risking, I added: "I like you very much&mdash;perhaps as much as any
  man I've ever met, with one exception."</p>

  <p>"Ah," he replied. And then, quite briskly after a pause: "You know, Jane,
  you <i>are</i> the part. What a pity you can't act!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know I can't? I can when I'm nervous enough. I'm acting a bit
  now.... Shall we break a rule and have a drink before lunch? I feel like
  it...."</p>

  <p>"Sure, but it's no rule. I hate rules, anyway." He summoned the waiter and
  ordered two martinis. "How's your scientist getting on? Recovering?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so. It's mental more than physical. He's staying with
  us&mdash;with my father and me. I'm trying to set him right. He's the man in
  my book&mdash;on page 117&mdash;the man in the Burggarten in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"The one who thought the Binomial Theorem would survive along with
  Beethoven?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. The sweetest compliment he could have paid me was to know that
  so instantly.</p>

  <p>He said: "Now I <i>would</i> like to meet him. When can you arrange
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Soon. You might be able to help him too&mdash;by talking and arguing. I
  think he's your kind of person. Perhaps we both are."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And one morning I drove eastward towards the desert. Dan
had found there
  was an airfield at a place called Lost Water, used by the C.A.P. since the
  war, but owned by a certain Mr. Murdoch who sometimes rented out a plane if
  he knew who you were. Because of the gas shortage you weren't supposed to fly
  for pleasure, so it was all very chancy; I should just have to go there and
  see what it was like, or perhaps let Mr. Murdoch see what I was like. The
  distance was over eighty miles, but the last thirty were arrow-straight, so
  that far ahead one saw where Lost Water must be. It had an elevation of
  twenty-two hundred and lay in a shallow saucer with gritty hills rimming it
  on all sides. A plume of smoke on the horizon indicated a small town that
  from the map was half a dozen miles further on.</p>

  <p>The "airfield" turned out to be nothing but a T-shaped patch cleared of
  scrub, but not of stones, sand, and weeds. A tumble-down hut surmounted by a
  windsock was the only likely sign of habitation; a few rough sheds housed
  planes. When I drove up a grizzled dust-gray character came out of the hut to
  introduce himself as Murdoch. He looked like an old-style sheriff who had
  somehow switched from the horse to the air age without anything in between.
  He scratched his head and stroked his chin when I asked if there was any
  chance of going up. He wasn't supposed to do it, he answered; he would get
  into trouble; there were so many government regulations nowadays. But even as
  he said all this I could see he was the kind of man who resents government
  regulations enough to break them now and again out of sheer nostalgia for
  pioneer freedom. All he asked after we had talked for a while was which plane
  I preferred; I chose the newer-looking red-painted Porterfield. Quite
  efficiently then he checked the oil and gas, warmed up the machine, and
  climbed inside. "Now show me what you can do," he said. I removed the chocks,
  got inside with him and took off. After about ten minutes in the air he told
  me to land, which I did. He made no comment, except to warn me of prohibited
  military areas near by, so I flew on my own for an hour or so, made several
  near-landings, then came in finally because of approaching dust storms. The
  warm air and the ground altitude were conditions new in my experience and I
  was glad to have had some practice with them.</p>

  <p>When I paid Mr. Murdoch I asked if he had any suggestions for a full day's
  excursion somewhere. You couldn't do it, he answered promptly, because of
  wartime restrictions and gas shortage and one darned thing and another. But
  presently he said that the real trouble was too few landing grounds near
  enough; except for one at Giant's Pass there wasn't any that a civilian could
  use.</p>

  <p>I told him I wasn't asking on my own account, but for an Air Force friend
  who had crashed and wanted to get rid of a fear-neurosis about flying. But he
  wasn't impressed by that either. "<i>What's</i> he got? We didn't have it
  when <i>I</i> started flying&mdash;that was in nineteen-oh-four. Not much
  good then if we'd been scared of a few crashes.... I've crashed a heap of
  times&mdash;never got hurt, though&mdash;not to speak of."</p>

  <p>He was still a pioneer, but now of a new species&mdash;the ancient airman,
  yarning of old times.</p>

  <p>I listened, and I could see him enjoying an audience; soon he was
  enumerating all the interesting spots one could fly over on the way to
  Giant's Pass. There were rocks where the bandit Valdez had hidden for months
  from the state guard back in the eighties, and a cave where a German spy in
  World War One was supposed to have operated a secret wireless station, and
  another place where legend said were long-lost gold mines. All this seemed to
  cover such a wide territory of popular fiction that I thought Hollywood might
  have done far better to engage Mr. Murdoch's services than mine. I liked him,
  though, and I had him in the end promising to telephone me some very early
  morning when the weather looked suitable for a trip.</p>

  <p>Then I drove back and told Brad. I said the call would come on the right
  sort of day, and if he really wanted to fly, that was fine, but if he didn't
  we needn't go, and even if we did go and he changed his mind, that would be
  all right too. I described the place and the plane and Mr. Murdoch, and with
  the map spread out on the library floor I tried to remember the spots he had
  said were worth flying over. We decided also to take sandwiches and coffee
  and make a picnic of it, provided it didn't look like a picnic.</p>

  <p>"Not that I've any conscience," I said. "You made one flight that wasn't a
  picnic&mdash;you can use a little gas now for your own pleasure."</p>

  <p>Physically, now, I would have called him almost well, but though there had
  been no more nightmares he was still moody and nervous. The look in his eyes,
  a haunted look, was sometimes as if it must tear through them; and during
  meals, when Dan was around, conversation was always difficult. At other
  times, after he had suspiciously made sure we were alone, he talked at random
  about his past, though only up to the time of his leaving Germany. I asked
  him once if he thought the false results he had given Framm would be
  repudiated by later investigation; and he said yes, he hoped so.</p>

  <p>"You <i>hope</i> so?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, if it hasn't been done already."</p>

  <p>"You think it may have been?"</p>

  <p>"On the whole I'd guess it hasn't. Not because it couldn't easily be, if
  anyone took the trouble, but because nobody was likely to waste time in a
  direction that Framm would appear to have given up as unpromising. Even with
  all the secrecy it would leak out that he'd taken a wrong turning. That's
  what research is for&mdash;not only to find the truth, but to rope off the
  blind alleys. And you tend to take people's word that they <i>are</i> blind,
  just as you take on trust the logarithm tables." He smiled grimly and then
  ceased to smile. "After all, why not? If scientists can't trust each other,
  whom can they trust? Nobody, perhaps, these days ... and for that reason the
  world can't even trust science."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it can still trust God."</p>

  <p>He said whimsically: "But He moves in such a mysterious way."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why anyone should mind that. It may make him hard to track
  down, but then, so was your Mr. Bitternut."</p>

  <p>He looked puzzled till he remembered the name. I went on to tell him that
  recently I had got hold of a book about quantum mathematics. "From what I
  could gather, the universe is governed by statistical probability rather than
  logic. But that still makes it wonderful. If life is like throwing a six a
  hundred times in succession, we know that isn't likely to happen oftener than
  once in so many centuries, but we also know it could happen in this room
  tonight without upsetting the cosmic applecart. That's reassuring."</p>

  <p>He said thoughtfully: "Is it? ... What made you want to read about
  mathematics?"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>.... Of course it was only one of those popular books&mdash;the
  romantic smattering, as you once called it. I'm not arrogant enough to think
  I could ever climb into your mind."</p>

  <p>"Be damned glad you can't. And don't say <i>climb</i>."</p>

  <p>Our talks so often ended in this kind of bitter barrier that I said: "I
  don't even want to. It's what's <i>on</i> your mind that still bothers
  me."</p>

  <p>When he didn't answer I thought I might as well be hanged for a sheep as a
  lamb, so I asked him outright: "What happened after you came back to
  America?"</p>

  <p>He replied, far too casually: "I just bummed around for a time."</p>

  <p>"Various jobs?"</p>

  <p>"Er ... yes."</p>

  <p>"How did you manage about the draft?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was ... er ... deferred."</p>

  <p>"War work?"</p>

  <p>"More or less...." He added, as if jumping with relief to firmer ground:
  "And then I got fed up and joined the Air Force."</p>

  <p>"You mean you quit the war work voluntarily?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You said just now you got fed up. What were you fed up with?"</p>

  <p>He answered, rather testily: "With not being in uniform ... let's settle
  for that."</p>

  <p>I said okay, I'd settle for it, but he was already on his way out of the
  room. I followed after a moment and overtook him by the pool. "Oh Brad," I
  said, "don't be in a huff. I promise not to ask you anything else. Whatever
  secret you have and want to keep, I'll try not to be curious about it. It's
  only that ... if you weren't being bothered by <i>my</i>questions ... you'd
  be having to put up with Newby's nonsense ... or worse...."</p>

  <p>"Or <i>worse</i>? What do you mean?" His voice was angry, but he had
  seized on the one word that had slipped out. I answered vaguely: "I didn't
  mean anything special.... Newby's a fool, but there <i>might</i> be worse
  people put on you ... that's all I meant."</p>

  <p>"No, you meant more than that. I want to know. What are they going to do
  to me? You know more than you'll say!"</p>

  <p>I took his arm. "Honestly, I don't. But that's an odd remark, coming from
  you. Don't <i>you</i> know more than you'll say?"</p>

  <p>He let me walk him through the gardens till he was calmer. "They won't
  leave me alone," he kept saying. "They never did let me alone&mdash;even in
  the service. Mysterious teletypes all the time. 'Bradley, I've had an inquiry
  about you from Washington....' They wouldn't send me overseas ... you know
  that? They kept saying I'd be in the next outfit, and then somehow or other I
  wasn't. And they tailed me when I was on leave in New York&mdash;I knew
  it&mdash;you can feel when you're being watched. Even here sometimes ... what
  do you know about the servants? What about Dan?... I suppose you just think
  I'm crazy for asking that...."</p>

  <p>It was on my tongue to say something, but at that moment Dan appeared,
  hurrying along the path from the house. The timing looked sinister, but could
  hardly have been anything but accidental, for he came to tell me I was wanted
  on the telephone.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay here," Brad said, so I walked back with Dan. I asked who it was
  and he said Mr. Small.</p>

  <p>When I saw the receiver lying on the blotter on the library table top I
  had an almost physical reluctance to touch it. I waited a moment before
  picking it up.</p>

  <p>A voice said rather curtly: "Miss Waring?... This is Small. I'd like to
  come up to your place tomorrow morning, if you don't mind, for a discussion.
  I'm not satisfied with the situation as it is.... Don't tell Bradley.... No,
  we can't talk over the phone.... Tomorrow, then, about ten. Good-by."</p>

  <p>I walked slowly back to Brad. It was after early dinner; dusk was falling;
  the beauty of the scene assembled itself almost excessively. Beauty to me is
  like that; up to a point it has the freshness of daffodils, but beyond that
  there can be too much, a tropical surfeit, foliage too rich and groves too
  dark, a place for fears to stalk. Or perhaps all this was only in my mind as
  I saw things then. I was relieved when Brad said he was tired and would go to
  bed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I slept badly, thinking of Mr. Small and what reason he
might have for not
  being satisfied. There had been something in his voice that worried me; or
  perhaps something in me was now prepared to worry. Already it seemed years,
  not merely days, since I had come to Vista Grande. I suddenly wished my
  mother were alive, because she had always known so easily how to deal with
  men. She, I felt sure, could have found out what was on Brad's mind; and she
  could handle Mr. Small, whatever mood he was in tomorrow. She would sweep
  them both into some realm of inconsequence and reign over it like an
  absent-minded queen.</p>

  <p>The telephone woke me. I saw by the clock it was 4 A.M. I didn't recognize
  the voice at first and was too sleepy to ask. Somebody talking about the
  weather ... perhaps a wrong number.... Then I caught Murdoch's drawl. "Dawn
  looks fine from here. Might be a good day if you don't mind it a bit hot.
  Sorry to waken you but that's what you asked."</p>

  <p>I was just about to tell him it was too bad I had an engagement that
  morning when an idea came that held me still listening. Presently I said:
  "Well, thanks, we'll probably be along.... Oh, as soon as we can make
  it...."</p>

  <p>Then I went to Brad's room and woke him. He yawned, looked indifferent,
  and replied, as if he were doing me a favor: "Okay. Give me ten minutes to
  dress."</p>

  <p>I took less time than that. Afterwards I made coffee and sandwiches
  downstairs, and left a note for Dan. I told him to give Mr. Small my
  apologies and say we had gone away "for a few days." I thought that would
  stop him from waiting around for our return.</p>

  <p>So we were on the road by four-thirty.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Feel like going up?" I said. "You don't have to. It's a
nice drive,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>He answered: "I'll probably try. But alone&mdash;first of all."</p>

  <p>"Oh no."</p>

  <p>"So you think I need an instructor?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not, but just in case...."</p>

  <p>"Just in case. I like that. I'd have you know I had five hundred hours to
  my credit before the Air Force decided I was only fit for map reading."</p>

  <p>So it still rankled. But I liked the mood he was working himself into.
  "All right. But in that case why bother to try it yourself first?"</p>

  <p>"Because I want to show off in front of you."</p>

  <p>I doubted that. I think his real reason was twofold: he thought he might
  be scared, once he was in the air; and if he were, he didn't want me to see
  it, and perhaps also he didn't trust me to take over in such an event. I had
  noticed before his deep reluctance to discover me able to do anything but
  write.</p>

  <p>When I quit the argument he seemed almost disappointed. Throughout the
  drive he was alternately jaunty and fretful, peeved at the car radio because
  at that distance it wouldn't yield the morning news bulletin. "We can get a
  paper somewhere," I said, but he shrugged indifferently. The sun rose,
  showing first in saffron tints on the peaks of mountains. Soon I could point
  out the plume of smoke that was just a few miles beyond the airfield. "Desert
  towns," he said, rememberingly. "You can spot them sometimes a hundred miles
  away&mdash;even if they don't have any factory smoke. They show up like a
  kid's breath on a windowpane ... someone said."</p>

  <p>"Who said? I like that."</p>

  <p>"A friend ... the only fellow I really got to know in the army. His name
  was Bill Manson. He said it once flying east from El Paso. Those little Texas
  towns, stuck in the middle of nothing.... Bill was a fine pilot, a cowboy
  before the war. Not well educated, but he thought things out and he saw
  things clear."</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"Died in a hospital, after a crash at sea. He was ten days drifting about.
  One of those raft stories. There were five on it, three died before they were
  picked up. Bill died after being brought home. A shark had mauled him. He was
  unconscious most of the time. The papers made a thing of it&mdash;about how
  the two survivors had prayed all night for rescue and then a ship had seen
  them at dawn. As the fifth man was the only one who could tell me what had
  really happened I got leave to see him. He told me. Before I left I asked if
  it was true they had prayed. He said&mdash;'Well, I didn't, but I guess Bill
  did, if you could call it a prayer. He kept calling out "For Christ's sake,
  God, what are you trying to do to us?" Of course that was after the shark got
  him.'"</p>

  <p>Brad stirred uncomfortably. "I suppose that's what some folks would call
  blasphemous, but to my mind it's in the same key with other things Bill said,
  and I don't call it a bad prayer ... if you're on a raft. And we're all on a
  raft these days, if we only knew."</p>

  <p>"Knew what?"</p>

  <p>"Knew we were on a raft ... drifting."</p>

  <p>I had purposely slowed down for him to say as much as he would, but I
  couldn't spin it out any more; we were already at Lost Water and Mr. Murdoch
  was waving from one of the planes. There were three now; I wondered if
  business were looking up, but he said when he came over to us: "I got a
  better one for you this time, miss."</p>

  <p>I had thought he would have respect for Brad as an Air Force man, but he
  didn't show any. "Don't let him get up to any tricks," he warned me. "None of
  that acrobatics stuff." I was tickled that he assumed I was to be in command.
  In point of fact I had no right to be; I hadn't yet got my certificate and
  taking up a passenger was forbidden. But Murdoch had never asked about that.
  "He wants to go up alone first," I told him.</p>

  <p>Murdoch looked even dubious, and I was beginning to reassure him when I
  noticed Brad's face, moody and rather pale as he stood a little way off. "I
  don't have to," he interjected, coming over. And then rather superiorly: "No
  thrill to me." I recognized that as an act put on for a stranger. Fine, if it
  helped him.</p>

  <p>While Murdoch was checking the gas I asked again: "Brad, are you sure you
  want to go up at all?"</p>

  <p>"Let's get into the damn thing and see," he snapped. "<i>You</i> take
  off...."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later we were high above the desert and Mr. Murdoch's hut
  looked like a nutshell on a yellow carpet. The seats were back and front;
  Brad was behind me. I could feel the pressure of his hand on the dual stick
  and rudders; he was letting me fly, but doing so, I thought, with an effort.
  I turned to look at him once, but his face was clenched; I thought he was
  nervous. Then suddenly I felt no pressure from him at all; he had given up
  the back-seat driving. I looked round again; he was staring out of the side
  window. "All right?" I shouted.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he shouted back.</p>

  <p>The plane was too noisy for conversation. I climbed to five thousand, then
  headed for Giant's Pass. It was about a hundred and fifty miles, almost due
  north, and against a head wind. The air was bumpy over the scrubby hills. I
  watched the instruments, checked on the map, looked out for emergency
  landings&mdash; the routine I had learned. There were pans of dried-up lakes
  here and there. Soon I went off course to pass over the rocks where Valdez,
  whoever he was, had hidden. I pointed them out to Brad, but he seemed
  unconcerned, and so was I&mdash; they were just like any other rocks. But a
  mood of exaltation came over me as we flew on; I shouted back to
  him&mdash;"Like to take over?" I half let go of the controls and in a few
  seconds he was flying. Of course anyone could have, even a pupil having a
  first lesson; yet as I sat there, my hands and feet idle, I felt I was
  accomplishing something in what he was accomplishing. I unpacked the
  sandwiches and he took one, but the air was too bumpy for coffee. I thought
  that now he had settled down he would probably find the rest of the trip
  dull.</p>

  <p>Abruptly he swung the plane in a complete right-about turn, then throttled
  down. In the sudden near-silence the wind through the struts was like a
  fingernail on piano wires.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Just to talk. I hate shouting."</p>

  <p>"How do you like it?"</p>

  <p>"Fine."</p>

  <p>"I guessed you wouldn't be scared."</p>

  <p>"I thought I would, but I'm not. Perhaps you give me confidence. You're
  not bad. Maybe you'll really know how to fly one of these days."</p>

  <p>"Well thanks." It was as much of a compliment as I could have hoped for.
  "Another sandwich?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet." He began to sing "Auld Lang Syne" at the top of his voice, and
  I remembered the last time I had heard that was at the Hampstead house years
  before. "Sorry," he said, after a few bars. "I guess that's like wanting to
  skywrite."</p>

  <p>"Go on," I said. "Sing all you want."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we'd best get back to the right direction. I'm turning, then
  she's all yours again."</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to keep on?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm lazy. You do the work."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>He throttled up, made the turn, and I took the controls. We flew for an
  hour and Giant's Pass was still some thirty or forty miles ahead. The wind
  blew now in gusts and flurries; sometimes the plane seemed to stand still in
  the air, like a bird hovering. Once I watched the shadow of the wing as it
  passed a certain rock; I didn't know how large the rock was, but I was sure
  that a car could have quickly overtaken us on the ground if there had been a
  road. I checked as well as I could from the map and confirmed this. Not that
  it mattered; we had all day. But suddenly Brad leaned over and shared the
  same misgiving&mdash;how were we for gas? I said, not wanting to alarm him:
  "Getting a bit low, but I think we'll make it."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he shouted back: "We won't. Better look out for a
  place to land."</p>

  <p>I had already thought of that too.</p>

  <p>We covered a few more miles. This would be my first emergency landing,
  though I had often pointed out to instructors where I would make one if I had
  to, and had come down to within a hundred feet of some likely field. But that
  was not quite the same as actually doing the thing, and in any case, fields
  were different from the desert in a high wind.</p>

  <p>Brad touched my shoulder and pointed far ahead to a white patch gleaming
  in the sun. "Try for that," he shouted. I changed course, and the white patch
  approached so slowly that the ground as well as the air seemed in battle for
  every inch. Even descending did not give much extra speed, because at the
  lower levels the wind was a hurricane. I had never flown, much less landed,
  against such odds, and had there been gas I would have turned back to Lost
  Water rather than try it. I glanced at Brad and saw his face a little set; I
  wanted to beg him to make the landing himself; but I couldn't ask, because he
  had said he had confidence in me and if he were nervous that was all he was
  depending on. I flew down to a thousand feet and at one moment had trouble in
  keeping the plane right side up; I wondered what would happen if it did
  capsize; there were things you could do if you thought of them quickly
  enough. I tried to remember them. The white patch rose like a wall as the
  downdraft increased; I pulled back the stick and then felt a forward pressure
  as Brad checked the movement. I realized a few seconds later he had probably
  saved us from a stall. "Try again," he shouted over my shoulder. "But with
  power this time."</p>

  <p>I had never done that before either. I flew round again and remade the
  approach. A terrific gust dropped the plane five hundred feet in a single
  swirl, but with power on I managed to level up till the white patch lay
  beneath. It proved to be the dried bed of a lake, smoother than any airfield
  runway; except for the wind a landing would be easy. I waited for lulls
  between gusts, then came down in a hurry. After we had touched ground the
  next gust almost blew us over. "Don't stop," Brad shouted. "Taxi over
  there...." He pointed in a direction where the lake bed elbowed into
  surrounding upland. We covered half a mile, tacking like a yacht whenever the
  big gusts came. Presently in the lee of a hill the wind lessened. We stopped
  and clambered out.</p>

  <p>"Well!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he answered, and slapped me on the back. Then he put stones
  against the wheels and climbed up to unscrew the cap of the gas tank. "Down
  to the last drop," he reported.</p>

  <p>"We were lucky."</p>

  <p>"The motor's fouled up too&mdash;didn't you notice the engine
  missing?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice anything...."</p>

  <p>"Bad gas. Or else worn rings. Or loose bolts on a cylinder head.... You
  made a pretty good landing. I'd half a mind to do it for you, at the end, but
  then I thought you'd like the practice."</p>

  <p>"Practice! Do you know I've never done a thing like that before?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you hadn't. That's why I said you did pretty well."</p>

  <p>"And ... and weren't you scared of letting me?"</p>

  <p>"No. For one thing, I was a bit confident you'd make it."</p>

  <p>"Any other reason?"</p>

  <p>He was already pouring coffee from the thermos. "I don't want to sound
  melodramatic, but I suddenly realized while we were flying that I don't give
  a damn about certain things any more ... and one of them's my life."</p>

  <p>"Another must be <i>my</i> life, in that case."</p>

  <p>"Sure.... Sit down. Coffee's only warm&mdash;altitude always loosens
  corks. You should squeeze them tight again after you climb."</p>

  <p>We sat in the shade of a yellow rock and I had a queer feeling that nobody
  else since the earth began had been exactly where we were. Which was quite
  possible, for we were a mile from the roughest road, and twenty from the
  nearest town. "We've got to get gas," I said, searching the map.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> have. My job's on the motor. I didn't quite like the way she
  behaved those last few miles."</p>

  <p>"No? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Just that I wouldn't want to fly her anywhere else without a checkup. I'm
  a good mechanic&mdash;did you know that? Take me about a couple of
  hours&mdash;time for you to hitchhike to the nearest gas station.... But no
  hurry. Eat your sandwiches and have a cigarette.... I like it here. For the
  first time in God knows how long I'm reasonably sure I'm not being spied on."
  And suddenly he drew me down to him on the desert sand and kissed me. It was
  different from that time in the car. Perhaps the relief after tension made us
  both responsive to something no longer within bounds.</p>

  <p>He said later, beginning quietly: "You think I'm still out of my mind,
  don't you? All this stuff about being watched everywhere.... Neurosis ...
  psychosis ... one of those jargon words. You're calm about it, that's one
  thing. You're always calm. I like that. It's my favorite cure. When I saw
  your head in front of me while we were flying I was calm too. And I didn't
  care what happened. That was part of the calmness. I kept thinking of
  Bill&mdash;probably because we'd talked about him in the car. When we were in
  those gusts I thought 'For Christ's sake, God, what are you trying to do to
  us?'&mdash;but I wasn't mad about it, as Bill was, I was calm. It seemed a
  good question. Something worth a bit of research, if anyone had time for it
  these days and wasn't being watched. There I go again&mdash;the neurosis.
  Just for the moment I even suspected Murdoch&mdash; because they put the
  unlikeliest people on to jobs like that&mdash;just as they did in the army
  ... in New York ... Washington ... and ... other places.... Of course it
  sounds incredible. I sometimes dream it's still just algebra&mdash;with a
  flaw in it somewhere. A big dud. That's what I hoped&mdash;that's what they
  knew I hoped. So they watched me afterwards. Maybe in case I suddenly wrote
  the truth in the sky. The mysterious way in which God moves, specially
  prepared for those over two-thirty-five, and when you read God backwards it
  spells Dog. In another moment I will give you my prediction for the end of
  the world, but first, a message from your announcer...."</p>

  <p>"Stop talking like that," I cried. "Whatever it means, stop it&mdash;stop
  it!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Perhaps I <i>am</i> out of my mind. Maybe they don't watch me
  half as much as I imagine. Or maybe I'm not watched at all and it just proves
  I'm out of my mind for thinking so."</p>

  <p>"No, no, don't worry about that. You're not out of your mind."</p>

  <p>"But if I think I'm being watched when I'm not ... because <i>you</i>
  don't believe it, do you?"</p>

  <p>I saw the look in his eyes and knew there was no longer any alternative. I
  said simply: "Darling, yes. I believe it."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it. I believe <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"Hey, let's get this straight. So I <i>am</i> being watched? It's true,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I believe you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what evidence have you? You know more than you'll say, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Brad, please&mdash;please don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, I want to know what <i>you</i> know. What makes you agree with me
  that I'm being watched all the time? Who's on the job now? Is it Dan? Why do
  you think <i>anyone's</i> watching me?"</p>

  <p>I pulled his head against mine and held it there while I whispered:
  "Because <i>I</i> am, Brad."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>I told him then about Mr. Small. I told him how I had gone to a downtown
  office in New York to be interrogated, how Mr. Small had followed me to
  California for further questioning, and how Brad's visit to Vista Grande had
  been arranged so that I could keep an eye on him, size him up, try to get him
  to talk&mdash;but precisely about what, they wouldn't tell me. It was the
  vaguest assignment. "So I said I'd try, but I didn't try&mdash;except for
  what I wanted myself, and that was to get to know you again after all these
  years."</p>

  <p>After the first shock he was calmer than I had expected, and he wasn't
  angry with me at all, as I thought he might have been. "So <i>you've</i> been
  watching me," he said reflectively, as if he must make it fit in with other
  things in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but not for him. For myself."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to tell him?"</p>

  <p>"Either everything or nothing, darling, but not half and half."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's the mistake I've already made and perhaps you have too."</p>

  <p>He said with a sigh: "You're uncanny sometimes.... And you've helped me
  tremendously. D'you know, I'm <i>relieved</i> at what you've said&mdash;about
  you watching me. I began to think I was going out of my mind&mdash;I wasn't
  sure ... sometimes I wondered if it were all my imagination. Now I
  <i>know</i> it isn't.... Fine.... And I can fly too&mdash;that's something
  else you've shown me." He took my hand and held it rather solemnly. "Just
  like you, Jane. Remember that time in Vienna when I said you'd always be on
  my side?"</p>

  <p>That wasn't quite what he had said, but I liked the misquotation.</p>

  <p>"What do they suspect me of?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Brad. Maybe the fact that you worked with Framm started
  them off. But after what you did in the army I don't see why you shouldn't be
  able to make them trust you.... That is, unless there are other angles I
  don't know about."</p>

  <p>"There are."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you&mdash;now. I wish I could and it's perhaps absurd that I
  can't, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right. Don't bother."</p>

  <p>"What's so wonderful is that <i>you</i> trust me. It doesn't occur to you
  that I might have done anything bad, does it?"</p>

  <p>"Have you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "But I love the way you ask. You remind me of the
  priest who heard a confession of murder and merely asked very calmly 'How
  many murders, my son?' Not that the parallel fits me, but I think it does
  you."</p>

  <p>"It might. Or maybe I'm just remembering Daniel Webster's remark that
  there's nothing so strange as truth. I can always imagine you getting into
  the most complicated trouble from the highest possible motives. I'm capable
  of doing that myself, that's why it doesn't shock me so much."</p>

  <p>He laughed and then asked seriously: "When do you see this man again?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, exactly. He was coming today, to the house, but we've
  missed him by making this trip. I did that deliberately."</p>

  <p>"Good for you."</p>

  <p>"But he'll come again. You can't keep him off."</p>

  <p>"What sort of man is he?"</p>

  <p>"That kind. The kind you can't keep off. Otherwise not so bad. Fairly
  fair. Nothing Gestapo-ish. He told me they don't know anything against you. I
  guess they just can't let you alone&mdash;any more than I can, but not in the
  same way."</p>

  <p>"Did he want to see me today?"</p>

  <p>"No, only me. To find out what I'd found out&mdash;or if I'd found out
  anything. He seems to think I have an inside track on you."</p>

  <p>"And you have." All his nerves, and mine too, came to rest in the way he
  said it.</p>

  <p>"That makes me very happy."</p>

  <p>"Me too." He leaned up on one elbow. "I wish we could stay here longer, or
  come again, but perhaps that's impossible.... I'm glad we had this day,
  anyhow. A lovely time.... When you see him again, will you tell him
  something?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course."</p>

  <p>"Tell him...." He hesitated and half smiled. "I'm sorry it sounds so
  mysterious, but I can't help it.... Just tell him I've kept my word so far.
  Will you tell him that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You've kept your word&mdash;so far."</p>

  <p>"But don't make the 'so far' sound like a threat. It's a fact. I can't be
  blamed if ... well, never mind.... That's all." He began to get up. "And now,
  if you're ready...."</p>

  <p>"Sure ... the gas."</p>

  <p>"And the motor. We've both got to get busy."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The road was round the corner of the hill, according to the
map, but I had
  no idea what chance there would be of a lift. It's an experience to start off
  alone across the desert land; you set a course, as when flying or sailing,
  but distances have a fabulous unreality; the place you keep your eye on may
  be one or five or ten miles away. I aimed just for the outer edge of the lake
  bed; caked hard, it made good walking, and soon the little plane was beyond
  sight against the background of hills. Presently I came to a jutting rock
  round which the road should be; but then came the hot wind, laden with dust
  and tumbleweed. I fought my way and struck the road almost before seeing it.
  A dirt road, not very encouraging, though there were fairly recent tire marks
  in the ruts. I began to wonder what I could do if no car overtook me. Just
  nothing, I supposed, except keep on walking. Twenty miles to Giant's
  Pass&mdash;say six hours. I should be scorched and thirsty and dead-beat, but
  probably I could do it.</p>

  <p>A car came along after a quarter of an hour&mdash;an aged Ford, driven by
  a Mexican. He spoke little English, and grinned when I used my Spanish on
  him. I don't think he understood much of what I explained, but he cheerfully
  made room for me amongst crates of eggs and bundles of alfalfa. We bumped
  along for four or five miles, then joined a paved highway for the rest of the
  journey.</p>

  <p>Giant's Pass was a small place, with not more than one of anything except
  wooden shacks. It looked like a ghost town either reviving or not quite dead.
  But for its altitude it would have been impossibly hot. Dogs lay sprawled in
  the shade; their barks and the occasional bang of a screen door were the only
  sounds. At a single gas pump in the midst of a litter of weather-worn auto
  cabins a boy of about fifteen listened curiously to my tale of a forced plane
  landing in the desert. It occurred to me later he probably thought it a trick
  to buy gas without coupons. Even when I had convinced him of the story there
  was another problem; he said he couldn't leave his place to drive me
  anywhere, nor did he know anyone who could. I tried to talk him into a change
  of mind till suddenly I saw the Mexican repassing; I yelled out to ask if he
  were on his way back. He answered with the same cheerful grin. So I handed up
  the cans and found the eggs and alfalfa replaced by enough groceries to keep
  a large family for a month. Perhaps that was what they were for. At the last
  minute, as we were leaving Giant's Pass, I remembered the newspaper and
  dashed back to the general store for one.</p>

  <p>It's curious to recollect where you were when you learned of big events. I
  was having a music lesson in the New York house when John came in to tell us
  excitedly that Lindbergh had landed in Paris; I was with a group of friends
  in Boise, Idaho, arguing after a long late Sunday breakfast when news came
  over the radio that the Japs had attacked Pearl Harbor; I was walking in
  Central Park when I saw all kinds of people struck by some strange
  dumbfoundedness and presently a girl's voice, overheard as I passed by, told
  me with sobs that Roosevelt was dead.</p>

  <p>And I was riding with a Mexican through the California desert when I
  picked up the paper and first saw the name Hiroshima.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Mexican, with a beaming disregard of his tires and
springs, had
  insisted on driving right through the scrub to the plane. He helped fill the
  tank, accepted a reward with genial dignity, and drove off in a second cloud
  of dust. Brad said he had fixed and checked everything. It hadn't taken
  either of us as long as he had expected, so we could now relax again before
  leaving. "Sit down and smoke. It's an easy take-off and whatever wind there
  still is will help us back, though it'll probably slacken by evening."</p>

  <p>"It's begun to slacken already," I said.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and lay outstretched on the sand. "I still say I like
  this place. I don't want to leave it somehow." I handed him the paper; he let
  it fall on his lap. "Oh, so you got one? Any news?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said.</p>

  <p>Then he picked it up, glanced at the headlines, and I saw the glance
  become a stare.</p>

  <p>He made no comment at first, and I watched him covertly while I packed the
  picnic things. I stowed them away in the plane, still to give him more time;
  then I came over.</p>

  <p>"Read about this new bomb?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary thing."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I reckon a good many people are finding it pretty hard to believe."</p>

  <p>"Probably."</p>

  <p>"Looks like they can only split atoms out of rare stuff like
  uranium&mdash;so far. And at terrific cost. One of these days, though,
  they'll find out how to do it cheaper out of common material&mdash;hydrogen,
  say. Nothing impossible about that&mdash;in theory."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Sure no. All it needs is the short cut. Somebody'll find it sooner or
  later."</p>

  <p>All this casualness had been so absurdly overdone that I simply looked at
  him, wondering how best to convey not so much what was in my mind as the fact
  that he would have to act much better if he wished to conceal what was in
  his.</p>

  <p>Presently he said: "What's the idea, staring like that? Anything
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>I lay beside him. "You've kept your word long enough, Brad."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Seems to me you're free to talk&mdash;after these headlines."</p>

  <p>He made smoke rings through an uneasy silence. Then he said: "I guess
  that's so&mdash;to some extent. But I see they don't go into the science of
  it much."</p>

  <p>"Oh, to hell with <i>that</i>. Tell me what happened to <i>you</i>. That's
  what I'm interested in."</p>

  <p>"It oughtn't to be."</p>

  <p>"I know ... the world ... the future ... science ... all that's more
  important. But with me, last things come first."</p>

  <p>"What last things?"</p>

  <p>"The last things we'd have if we lost everything else. Human
  relationships."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that must be what they call the woman's angle."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="part5"
     name="part5">PART FIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He told me, during the several hours that followed, more or
  less what had happened. The story was often disjointed in the way he gave it,
  and I had to probe to get certain parts clear; but in the end it assembled
  itself.</p>

  <p>He had intended, he said, to return to America at once, in September 1939;
  but after his year in Berlin he found that crossing the frontier into a free
  country gave him a part-fascinated, part-frantic interest in the world drama
  that was developing. With the release of his mind from technical work he
  turned with something of the same intensity to a grandstand scrutiny of
  chaos. Perhaps oddly, he said, he hated the Nazis more and not less when he
  saw them in this perspective; it was as if Berlin had been too much the
  center of the whirlpool, just as America would be too far beyond the outer
  edge. At any rate, he lived in France, the nearer distance, throughout the
  so-called phony war and most of the invasion. In June, just before that
  country's fall, he crossed to England and was in London during the worst of
  the blitz.</p>

  <p>I asked him what he was trying to get out of all this and he answered:
  "Experience. You yourself once said that scientists lived in an ivory tower.
  I'd lived in one so long I couldn't even wait to come down the stairs&mdash;I
  had to jump out of the window."</p>

  <p>"How did you make a living?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't. For the first time in my life I idled&mdash;idled while Rome
  was burning. I pottered about France and then I pottered about England."</p>

  <p>"During the blitz?"</p>

  <p>"Well ... I took my turn at fire-watching, air-raid work and so on. I
  wanted to see what was happening."</p>

  <p>"And you saw?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw plenty. I guess you did too. Only I hadn't the excuse of a
  book to write&mdash;it was just for my own private education."</p>

  <p>"What did you use for money while you were idling as you call it?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Those twenty A.T. and T.'s that my uncle had left me. I sold
  'em without a qualm."</p>

  <p>He went on to say that he lived quite happily&mdash;yes, that was a true
  word, however strange it might sound&mdash;throughout 1941. Once he tried to
  enlist in the R.A.F. (he had always wanted to learn to fly), but there were
  difficulties about his citizenship. They didn't worry about that in air
  raids, though. He liked the English very much, he said&mdash;much more than
  he had during his earlier period in London. But of course after Pearl Harbor
  he wanted to return to America. He reached New York in January 1942, an
  out-of-work and practically penniless mathematician, than which there is
  normally no more maladjusted person on earth. But for him, just then, his own
  country seemed a wonderful place. He tried again to enlist, and again in the
  Air Force, but to his surprise they found something wrong with his blood
  count&mdash;it was the first time in his life he had ever had to think of his
  body in a way that less fortunate people do all the time. The doctor heard
  where he had lived during recent years and suggested that he take things easy
  for a while, fatten up on sunshine, fresh air, and plenty of good food. But
  he had no money to idle any more, besides which, he wasn't in any mood to
  idle in America. The only thing he could think of was to go back "home," and
  home was North Dakota, where members of his family still lived. To his
  surprise he got quite a warm reception, which was just as well, because
  almost immediately his health broke down, the accumulated strains and
  stresses of many years exacting a sudden price.</p>

  <p>He said: "I don't know what I'd have done if it hadn't been a farm. When
  you're ill on a farm people don't bother much about you, they don't fuss,
  they have their own work that can't be neglected, and their contact with
  animals and animal ailments makes them very considerate yet also very
  practical. And then when you get better you can always find some little job
  that really helps them yet doesn't tax you too much."</p>

  <p>"What really was the trouble&mdash;your trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'd call it a nervous breakdown. If I'd taken much notice of
  it I'd probably be having it still."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that you aren't having it still."</p>

  <p>He retorted harshly: "Oh, nonsense. There's nothing the matter with me now
  except ... well, anyhow, let's get on with the story. I improved. I worked on
  the farm. I learned to fly&mdash;got my license&mdash;did quite a bit of
  local flying. That took me up to pretty near the end of 1943. Then one day I
  went on some farm business to Chicago. On the train I ran into an old school
  friend who had since gone into teaching and was science professor at a
  college in Iowa. He knew roughly what my own field was because he was
  interested in it too, and he told me of some important research being done in
  Chicago that was altogether in my line. 'It's war work,' he said, rather
  mysteriously, 'and I daresay they could use you.' So while I was in Chicago I
  called at the place. They were cordial if also a bit mysterious; they said it
  was quite likely they could give me a job. But they had to pass me on to
  someone else who made all the appointments, and after more questions and
  form-filling I was told they would let me know. I went back to the farm and
  didn't really expect to hear from them again. But after a few weeks I
  did&mdash;they wanted me in Chicago for another interview. This was a
  different kind&mdash;very thorough, not quite hostile but
  <i>almost</i>&mdash;a bit like a cross-examination in court. I found they
  knew much more about my association with Framm than I had told anybody.
  Anyhow, in due course they sent me to this place in Tennessee&mdash;I see one
  can mention its name now. They gave me a job there. Perhaps I'd better not
  say what, though it couldn't be much of a disclosure, because it was the sort
  of thing any sixteen- year-old physics student at college could have learned
  in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you ask for something more suitable?"</p>

  <p>"I did, and nothing came of it. Then I figured that after all, my name was
  unknown and my credentials weren't of surpassing weight. But the real reason
  was probably in me&mdash;I'm not personally ambitious, never have been, and
  if that was the way they wanted me to help win the war, it was perfectly
  okay. They had some fine mathematicians already working for them&mdash;I
  wasn't boastful enough to think I had anything unique to contribute."</p>

  <p>"Not even your knowledge of the kind of thing Framm had been doing?"</p>

  <p>"I'd told them about that. It wasn't exactly on the same lines as their
  work. I'm sorry I can't explain more fully."</p>

  <p>"I probably wouldn't understand it if you did. So you settled down at this
  elementary job and what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. There's really no eventfulness in this part of my story.
  After Vienna and Berlin it's quite without drama. I'm afraid you're going to
  be disappointed."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not. I'm glad. You've had enough drama for one lifetime. Or don't
  you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so too."</p>

  <p>"What was it like to live at this place? Tell me all the unscientific
  things about it."</p>

  <p>He answered grimly: "That would certainly get to the root of the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind.... I know what <i>you</i> mean. The everyday details. Well,
  that's fairly easy. The place grew to have a population of sixty or seventy
  thousand&mdash;mostly laborers on the actual construction of buildings. They
  had to be housed, with their families, so there were shops, banks,
  schools&mdash;just like any other town. But you couldn't drive in and look
  round. You had to have some business there before they'd give you a permit,
  and even then you couldn't get in the plant without another permit. And
  inside the plant you had to have extra permits to go from one part to
  another. One got used to it after a time."</p>

  <p>"Where did you live?"</p>

  <p>"In a sort of two-by-four apartment&mdash;just a room and bath&mdash;or
  rather, it was a stall shower which I shared with three other men. I shared
  the room with one other. Rather primitive, but that couldn't be
  helped&mdash;the place was impossibly crowded, you were lucky to have a roof
  over your head. The rent was low&mdash;the government fixed it that way; and
  we also got our meals at government cafeterias&mdash;cheap and fairly good.
  And there were movies and dances and tennis courts and everything else you
  could wish for in the way of normal recreation. I've no complaints against
  the physical conditions of living&mdash;they were as good as could be
  expected in the circumstances. My roommate was a nice boy out of Harvard.
  Presently he was drafted into the army, put through basic training, then sent
  back to the Project on army pay&mdash;that was done with a good many of the
  younger men. Some of them resented it, but compared with the boys who were
  doing the fighting overseas I couldn't myself see what they had to kick
  against, except, of course, that munition workers and longshoremen weren't
  treated that way&mdash;only scientists. I half expected the authorities would
  do the same to me, because I was sure I was quite fit again, and I wouldn't
  have minded at all, but I was thirty-one and I guess that put me over an age
  limit they must have had. I got quite friendly with this Harvard boy&mdash;he
  had the same keen and almost emotional interest in science that I had had at
  his age, and so he was less able than I to accept our common fate&mdash;which
  was routine work far beneath our capacities. An even harder thing for him was
  that there were no facilities to continue study&mdash;no classes to attend
  that would have given him the feeling of not entirely wasting his time. There
  was a library in the place, but it contained no books of any advanced
  character in his field&mdash;in fact I was told that all such books were
  quietly withdrawn from every public library throughout the country. Anyhow, I
  taught him some tensor analysis in the evenings, and I think it was a relief
  to both of us while it lasted. When he came back from the army he was put on
  another job&mdash;not better, just different&mdash; and I didn't see much of
  him then. It wasn't easy to make or keep friends except by the coincidence of
  working or rooming with them&mdash;times and places were hard to arrange,
  unless you were just satisfied to see a movie or watch a football game.
  Personally I'd been somewhat schooled to an isolated life by working with
  Framm, though there had been the compensation in that of doing a job that
  taxed me fully. And of course there were certain things that never did bother
  me at all anywhere&mdash;the regimen of work and sleep, plain meals, little
  social life, long walks in the country&mdash;it was all the kind of thing I'd
  been used to, and I was far happier with it than some of the others were. One
  thing it did&mdash;it gave me a chance to read, and I filled up some
  deplorable gaps in my general education&mdash;history, economics, literature,
  political science. You'll find me not quite so stupid as I used to be."</p>

  <p>"I'd already noticed it," I said dryly. "And I've also noticed that you're
  a bit on the defensive about this place. You didn't really like it, did
  you?"</p>

  <p>He demurred; it wasn't quite so simple as that. It was true there was an
  atmosphere there that weighed irksomely at times&mdash;an atmosphere hard to
  describe except by the negative word "unscientific"&mdash;which, of course,
  for a scientist was a very bad word indeed. All the paraphernalia of secrecy
  and counterespionage&mdash;possibly quite necessary&mdash;got on one's nerves
  after a while&mdash; and especially on a scientist's nerves. Maybe it didn't
  get so much on a soldier's nerves or a lawyer's.</p>

  <p>"Why a lawyer's?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He said there were a good many bright young lawyers working on
  counterespionage&mdash;the type that would have been forging ahead in
  district attorneys' offices but for the war. "I expect your Mr. Small is one
  of them."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't like them?"</p>

  <p>"I rarely met them. You may be right, though&mdash;their presence didn't
  make life any smoother. And yet, when I come to think of it, the only two
  lawyers I've ever known personally&mdash;Julian Spee and Hans
  Bauer&mdash;were men I liked very much."</p>

  <p>"Tell me some more about the place."</p>

  <p>"There's not much more. As I said, nothing exciting happened&mdash;nothing
  in the personal sense. Plenty, of course, in every other sense, though I
  wasn't high enough up to be told anything."</p>

  <p>"But you knew what was being done?"</p>

  <p>"More or less. I knew what it was a race for between us and the
  Germans."</p>

  <p>"And you stayed on the job because of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, partly. It wasn't hard to hope that we should win. And yet...."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I can't quite put into words the feeling I had&mdash;and which others may
  have had, though I never discussed it with them. We didn't want the Germans
  to get the thing first&mdash;that was firm enough in our minds to build a
  cathedral on. But, assuming that the Germans didn't get it, did we want to
  get it ourselves? <i>Did</i> we?... Perhaps some of us did&mdash;I don't
  really know. I can only confess that a sort of cynicism grew in me as I saw
  the whole place getting bigger and bigger and costing more and more&mdash;I'd
  have guessed the truth from that, even if I hadn't known it from any other
  source. I'd have been sure that no government on earth could afford so much
  for anything except destruction. And I half wanted the thing to turn out to
  be a gigantic dud&mdash;not from mere technical mistakes, but because of some
  basic factor that would rule out the whole thing forever as an impossibility.
  There wasn't much hope of that, I already knew, but I clung to it, and if in
  the end the damned thing hadn't gone off and all the billions had been proved
  wasted I think I should have joined quite a few of my co-workers in the
  thankfulest horselaugh that ever was heard on government property."</p>

  <p>He got up then and stretched himself. "Wind's dropped," he said, staring
  into space. But the still air was hotter. He walked a few paces, then came
  back to lie against my side.</p>

  <p>"Oh well," he went on, "we've practically won the war and that's quite a
  thing. If I were on a Pacific island or an aircraft carrier I'd help myself
  to some strength through joy tonight."</p>

  <p>"So will thousands at home who have boys out there."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Looks like there'll be a surrender in a day or two. Must
  be&mdash;if we have a few more things like this up our sleeve. You're a sap,
  Mr. Jap. I guess we've proved it."</p>

  <p>"But as a scientist you feel that isn't quite everything?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, forget the scientist. As a draftee I feel it's a hell of a lot."</p>

  <p>"I know. And it is. And yet...."</p>

  <p>"And yet what, for God's sake?"</p>

  <p>"You were saying 'and yet' just now. Can't I?"</p>

  <p>He didn't answer. He lay back again, face to the sky. He looked old-
  young, like so many men these days; premature age and retained youth neatly
  packaged and telescoped into the standardized product, the sort of man you
  would like to be seen with, the sort that smiles at you in cigarette ads, or
  wisecracks from the screen in the zany comedies. All that on the surface.
  Beneath it there's something you have to discover for yourself, if it
  exists&mdash; the freakishness or the frailty, occasionally the
  sainthood.</p>

  <p>I said: "Go on telling me what happened even if nothing happened."</p>

  <p>He pondered. Then he said that one day he had grown mildly excited at a
  development in his work that seemed to offer scope for a promising though
  quite minor piece of research. It was mainly theoretical and required no
  special equipment, only time and patience, of which he had both to spare. So
  he began to work late, after most of the men in the same building had packed
  up for the day; and this went on for some time till he realized that his
  behavior was attracting notice.</p>

  <p>"You mean you were being watched?"</p>

  <p>He said they were all watched, but that in his case there seemed something
  a bit extra about it. Anyhow, he'd made no secret of what he'd been doing, so
  he went to the head of his department and explained the whole thing fully.
  Then he received a graphic demonstration of the size and character of what
  was going on, for this head of a department, quite a big shot in his way,
  proved to be only a somewhat larger cog in the complicated machine&mdash;he
  revolved with just as much precision and with a conditioned distaste for
  extraorbital behavior. All he said was&mdash;"H'm, very interesting." And a
  few days later he called Brad to his office and asked if he would please
  discontinue the research.</p>

  <p>"He sounded rather embarrassed," Brad said, "especially when he gave me
  some reason about keeping the guards on duty after hours, which I knew was
  nonsense, since guards were on duty everywhere at all times. However, I said
  that naturally I'd give it up if those were his instructions, and he didn't
  like the hint that he'd been instructed, and because he didn't like it I knew
  he <i>had</i> been instructed. That was the way one was apt to get to know
  many things, and it didn't add to one's mental or spiritual comfort. But of
  course the Project wasn't designed for our mental and spiritual comfort. One
  had to remember that."</p>

  <p>"And did you&mdash;always?"</p>

  <p>"I think most of us managed to, though there were moments when you felt
  you'd raise a little hell when the war was over."</p>

  <p>"Which is practically now."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope so."</p>

  <p>He was silent and I tried to bring him back to the subject. "Well, so you
  were asked to stop the research and you did. Then what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. That's the end of the incident. There were a few
  others&mdash;not similar, but equally unimportant. And nothing dramatic, as I
  warned you. No Central European high jinks. I just went on with the job."</p>

  <p>"Getting more and more bored and cynical all the time."</p>

  <p>"Not even that. <i>At</i> times, not <i>all</i> the time."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, you gave the job up and joined the army. What finally drove you
  to it?"</p>

  <p>"There again it's hard to point to any specific cause. Perhaps meeting
  Sanstrom had as much to do with it as anything else...."</p>

  <p>"<i>Sanstrom</i>?" The name struck an echo in my mind; I tried to remember
  where I had heard it before; then suddenly I knew. It was Mr. Small who had
  asked me, during our first interview, if I had ever met one of Brad's London
  friends named Sanstrom.</p>

  <p>Brad caught my look. "What's the matter? Heard of him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." And I told him when.</p>

  <p>He said grimly: "I see."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into another silence and I had found there was no better way
  to start him again than by simple pestering. "Go on," I said. "Tell me about
  this meeting with him."</p>

  <p>He called his thoughts to order. "Yes, Frank Sanstrom. I hardly recognized
  him at first. A man suddenly rushed up and began pumping my hand one day as I
  was walking to the cafeteria for lunch. As I say, I hardly recognized
  him&mdash;he'd changed a good deal in ten years. We'd been friends at
  University College, partly because we were both Americans and studying
  physics, but chiefly because you couldn't help being friendly with Frank. I
  think he left college the same year you came&mdash;that would be 1936. He had
  the lab next to mine before Mathews took over with those stinking animals....
  We hadn't kept in touch, but I'd followed his career sketchily&mdash;I'd read
  a few papers of his in scientific journals, so I knew he was doing advanced
  work and establishing a reputation. And here he was, full of the same warmth
  and geniality, though about thirty pounds heavier than he ought to have been.
  We said the usual things one does on such occasions&mdash;how good it was to
  see each other again, and what were we doing there, and how had life been
  treating us&mdash;all the questions that aren't intended to be answered at
  the time they're asked. 'I'm just on a visit,' he said, beaming. 'The Cook's
  Tour ... and these gentlemen are the cooks.' He had to say something, I
  suppose, because two army officers had by this time come up; I realized
  afterwards that they had been escorting him and he had broken away from them
  on seeing me. They didn't look too pleased at his little joke. He seemed to
  think they'd know me, and when they didn't he made the necessary
  introductions&mdash;explaining that I was an old friend of his London
  University days. I can't remember their names or even their rank. They didn't
  find his affability infectious, so he ended the conversation by shaking hands
  again and telling me to look him up if I happened to be in Washington during
  the next few weeks&mdash;he'd be at the Carlton Hotel....</p>

  <p>"I don't know quite why, because I'm not usually sensitive to the glad-
  hand kind of reunion, but meeting Frank Sanstrom like that had a big effect
  on me. Of course the warmth of our early friendship came back, and I was
  pleased to have been so well remembered; but I think also it was the
  contrasting iciness of the military gents and the way they looked at
  me&mdash;the officer- private look plus something else that wasn't any more
  palatable. Anyhow, I had vacation time due me and I made up my mind to take
  Frank at his word and call on him in Washington.</p>

  <p>"Which I did&mdash;without notifying him ahead, because I didn't want to
  make the visit seem more than casual. I just went to Washington, found my way
  to the Carlton, and called him up on the house telephone. If he'd changed his
  plans by that time and gone, or if he weren't in, it didn't matter. I'd never
  been to Washington before and I could enjoy some sight-seeing. But he
  <i>was</i> in. And I caught a note of surprise in his voice when he heard
  mine&mdash;well, perhaps surprise was natural, even in spite of his
  invitation&mdash;but there was another note which I could almost diagnose as
  dismay. I had time to think things out in the elevator going up to his room;
  I said to myself&mdash;Something's happened but he probably won't say what. I
  was used to that sort of thing&mdash;we all were. It was part of the
  technique of secrecy&mdash;do what has to be done, don't talk, don't explain,
  don't accuse, don't confirm or deny. When the Harvard boy was drafted, for
  instance, I couldn't help wondering whether it had been partly my own fault-
  -but I knew I should never find out, and that he wouldn't either."</p>

  <p>"I thought you said they did that to be able to put people on army
  pay?"</p>

  <p>"Often it was the only reason one could think of. But they didn't treat
  everyone like that ... and I knew it had been noted that I'd been working out
  mathematics problems with the boy in the evenings&mdash;nothing was said
  about it to either of us, but I had a suspicion&mdash;quite
  unprovable&mdash;that my wastebasket had been examined.... On the other hand,
  that might have been just routine. Watching was also routine. It carried no
  stigma."</p>

  <p>He was on the defensive again. He said that I mustn't get him wrong; he
  wasn't complaining about the system. "When pure science becomes a war weapon,
  you're bound to have secrecy, espionage, counterespionage, and all the
  tricks. If a scientist feels less happy in the atmosphere of an Oppenheim
  novel than a college lecture room, it's just too bad, isn't it? And there
  <i>are</i> secrets, no doubt, that it's in the national interest to
  safeguard&mdash;and therefore the system can be held justifiable. I don't
  know whether it kept the spies in the dark, but it certainly kept the outside
  public&mdash;you, for instance&mdash; and to a large extent the unimportant
  insiders, such as me."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't like it," I said, as I had said once before.</p>

  <p>"Hell, no ... how could I?" he replied, less cautiously. "When you've been
  brought up to an idea of scientific truth as something that transcends
  frontiers&mdash;something that can't be bought or sold or patented or
  hidden&mdash;when you've been used to wandering about from one laboratory to
  another and asking questions about another man's work&mdash;or submitting a
  problem to someone in another country to see if either of you can save the
  other's time ... it's a bit hard to get the viewpoint that you're working for
  Macy's or Gimbel's but not for both.... Mind you, I'd had a part training for
  that sort of idea in Berlin. Only somehow there it was Nazi stuff&mdash;easy
  to hate and therefore easier to discount. Over here it was harder to hate
  because you knew it might be necessary, but being harder to hate didn't make
  it much easier to forget.... Is that too complicated?... Anyhow, where was I
  before I began all this?... Oh yes, on my way to see Frank Sanstrom at the
  Carlton. He had a small suite on one of the middle floors&mdash;elegant and
  impersonal till he'd littered it up, just as he'd always littered up his
  rooms in London. He was that sort of man. As soon as he greeted me I knew
  again that something was wrong. He offered me a drink and mixed one for
  himself. I had a feeling he wanted time to make a decision. Then he began to
  talk about the weather and Washington and the war news in a way I simply
  couldn't stand. I'm afraid I ... I rather lost my head. I realized then the
  effects of the strain that I'd perhaps not entirely recovered from, and that
  the plant life&mdash;h'm, I didn't mean that, but it'll do&mdash; the plant
  life hadn't helped. I realized also how much I'd been looking forward to an
  utterly free conversation with someone in my own field. I flew off the handle
  a bit&mdash;I said he couldn't deceive me, I knew something was the matter,
  and I challenged him to tell me what it was, to forget for one moment the
  never- confirm, never-deny technique that filled the air at times so that one
  couldn't breathe.... He looked at me for rather a long time, then suddenly
  motioned me into the bedroom. 'We'd better talk in here,' he said. The
  bedroom was on an outside corner; the inside walls were against the bathroom
  and the sitting room. I knew what he meant, but the fact that he should be so
  cautious magnified the concession he was making in treating me like a human
  being, an old friend, and a fellow scientist. It moved me almost to tears. He
  sat on the bed while he told me what he knew. He said that after our chance
  meeting at the plant he had been questioned about his early knowledge of me
  in London, and he had gathered that for some reason I was under a cloud. They
  didn't say why&mdash;of course they wouldn't. He then asked me what my
  particular job was, and I saw no reason not to tell him. 'Good God,' he
  commented. I asked if it surprised him, and he answered: 'No. I guessed
  something of the sort&mdash;that's why I asked. It's probably their idea of
  how to keep an eye on you with least trouble and risk.'</p>

  <p>"'You mean it's <i>deliberate</i>? They know the sort of thing I'm
  qualified for, yet they prefer to waste....'</p>

  <p>"'It isn't a question of waste. They probably don't want you to know too
  much about what's going on.'</p>

  <p>"'But why?'</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps because they think you know too much already. Ever hear the old
  Russian proverb&mdash;"Those who know enough are my friends; those who know
  too much are my enemies"?... Tell me about your association with Framm.'"</p>

  <p>"So I told him."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"<i>Everything</i>?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well," he answered. "He'd heard about Pauli already&mdash;but of
  course from a rather different angle."</p>

  <p>"So you put him right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I explained the arrangements about the trial and my suspicions when
  she died, and the way I went a bit out of my mind afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him you planned to kill Framm?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and that the war started before I got a chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that you gave him false results instead?"</p>

  <p>His face clouded. "No, I didn't tell him that. I've never told anyone that
  except you."</p>

  <p>I wanted to ask why, but another question seemed more urgent. "What did he
  say? I'm curious to know how it would strike another person."</p>

  <p>What I really meant was that I wondered how far his not quite complete
  story would seem plausible to anyone who, unlike me, had no personal
  verification of any part of it.</p>

  <p>Brad answered: "He said he thought it explained why the authorities
  weren't so sure about me."</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised he was even sure of you himself."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Oh, I'd be sure of Frank, so I guess he'd be sure of me. We
  were really friends, you know, in London. Besides, he'd met Framm
  once&mdash;at a scientific congress somewhere. He hadn't liked him&mdash;he'd
  got the impression that the man was just a shyster. Of course I told him he
  was far more than that in both directions&mdash;a crook, and also a very
  great scientist."</p>

  <p>"So once again you found yourself defending Framm?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Defending</i> him?... Heavens, no&mdash;but I knew Frank hadn't sized
  the man up properly. After all, I'd <i>worked</i> with him."</p>

  <p>I was a little moved by that, because it seemed to give me, in a flash,
  some central vision of Brad's personality as well as the clue to what had
  often made trouble for him, and doubtless would again. I suppose if you
  concentrate on getting one thing into clear focus, as he did, everything else
  gets a little bit out of focus; and the sort of thing that comes naturally to
  you, as a mere instinct of fairness or logic, carries an air of eccentricity
  or even untrustworthiness elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"All right," I said. "Go on."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He went on:</p>

  <p>... I asked Sanstrom what he thought the authorities suspected me of, and
  he answered: "Nothing&mdash;which is probably the worst thing to be suspected
  of if you're suspected at all. Because it means there's nothing you can do
  about it. They're not accusing you, so you've nothing to refute or disprove.
  You're like the coin that the automatic machine refuses&mdash;not necessarily
  bad, maybe only bent."</p>

  <p>"Except that they didn't refuse me, Frank."</p>

  <p>"That's so. For bent ones they have another automatic machine that
  combines the most effective methods of Henry Ford and Sherlock Holmes.... Of
  course you can always quit if it gets on your nerves, and with a good
  conscience, I'd say. Matter of fact if I were you I <i>would</i>quit. Why
  don't you? You might be doing far more useful work somewhere
  else&mdash;teaching, for instance&mdash;I seem to recollect you had a real
  aptitude for that. I could fix you with a job if you like."</p>

  <p>He then told me he had been "loaned" to the government for liaison work
  between the educational world and the Project; in other words, to steer into
  it young scientists fresh out of college. "Sometimes," he said, "I feel like
  the Judas animal they use in the stockyards to lead the other animals to the
  slaughter&mdash;except that I'm saving some of them from another kind of
  slaughter, there's always that consolation. I only hope we'll get a good many
  of them back in the colleges when the war's over. Assembly lines aren't
  educational, even when you staff them with Ph.D.'s."</p>

  <p>And then, with extraordinary freshness and freedom, he began to argue the
  whole issue. Perhaps it wasn't really so extraordinary, but after the
  atmosphere I'd lived in it seemed so. One hardly ever discussed what we were
  doing in the place where we were doing it. There had been a sort of social
  taboo. Some moment must have come when even the least intelligent guesser had
  an idea what was shaping up, but the chances are he wouldn't share his guess
  with anyone else, or if he did, the other fellow would neither confirm nor
  deny.... So now, in this hotel bedroom with Sanstrom, I felt that something
  like a miracle was taking place. He assumed I knew plenty, and of course I
  did; but for him to take a chance of telling me something I mightn't know was
  a return to sanity that made me gasp with relief. He even discussed some of
  the details, scoffing at the idea that any secrets should exist between one
  accredited scientist and another. "In any case," he said, "most of this
  secrecy concept has been built up by nonscientists. It tickles their vanity.
  Some of them enjoy stamping 'restricted' on stuff that might as well be sold
  for junk for all the harm it could do. Every time they show a badge or
  whisper a password it gives them a kid thrill straight back from their
  boyhood. Their private opinion of scientists is that we're a bunch of
  irresponsible long-hairs with queerly subversive and international ideas
  who're at last being made to toe the line and behave. Secrecy makes a good
  excuse to put us in separate cages where we can do what we're told like good
  little boys and leave the grand strategy to the short-hairs...." I began to
  laugh at that, because it was in Frank's old familiar vein of exaggeration,
  and he laughed too, recognizing what had always been my own impulse to check
  his wilder extravagances. We had been good foils for each other that way.
  "Don't mind me," he continued, "I'm in a mood to let off some
  steam&mdash;just as you were too just now. Because&mdash;my God&mdash; don't
  they realize that about 90 per cent of the whole thing's no more secret than
  yesterday's weather? Einstein's equation dates from 1905, the spectograph's
  nearly as old, so is the principle of gaseous diffusion, even chain reaction
  goes back to 1939&mdash;yet from the way some of them behave you'd think it
  was Lydia Pinkham's formula for a magic dandruff remover!"</p>

  <p>I said soberly that there was a good deal of difference between knowing
  how a thing was done and knowing how to do it, and that the real secrets were
  probably in the field of engineering and production methods.</p>

  <p>He waved that aside; oddly like Framm, he had the purist's disregard for
  the nontheoretical. "The real secret," he said, "is what's going to be done
  if and when we've made the thing. Is it to be <i>delenda est</i> Berlin or
  Tokyo, or will there be a trade show on some uninhabited place? That's the
  sort of secret that keeps a sane man awake at nights. Because it seems to me
  that if we <i>do</i> use the thing ruthlessly, then we can never again call
  anything in warfare an atrocity, and the fact that we finish the war with it
  and so save life numerically is merely the end-justifying-the-means argument
  that Hitler used when he machine-gunned refugees on the roads during
  blitzkriegs. Of course you can say that our war's righteous and his isn't,
  which is true enough comparatively, but it's an argument that won't make it
  easy to outlaw the total use of the thing when the war's over and other
  allegedly righteous nations want to use it for <i>their</i> wars. So frankly
  I hope we don't use it. Which means I devoutly hope the war ends before we
  can."</p>

  <p>There was always something about the way Frank Sanstrom presented an idea
  that made you want to dispute it, if only as a devil's advocate. I replied
  that, the way I saw things, all countries in war adopted an
  end-justifies-the- means policy, because the use of physical force implied
  that. The real problem wasn't the technics of war but war itself.</p>

  <p>"True in theory," he answered, "but in practice the use of atomic energy
  for destruction makes such a difference in degree that it constitutes a real
  difference in kind. For the first time in human history it becomes possible
  to destroy whole cities and populations in an instant."</p>

  <p>I said that the slow death of thousands by economic blockade didn't seem
  to me more merciful than the quick death of thousands by bombs.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of mercy. The humanitarian approach was always wrong-
  -"</p>

  <p>"That's why I say, Frank, the real problem is war itself. And the
  scientist should tackle that not only as a scientist but as a citizen. What I
  dislike about the present setup is not so much that the powers-that-be want
  us to make bombs, but that they don't seem to want us to do anything else.
  They never invite us to use the scientific method plus unlimited funds on the
  general problems of world affairs or the organization of society."</p>

  <p>"You're darned right they don't&mdash;and why should they? We'd throw most
  of them out on their ears as quick as we'd scrap a leaky vacuum pump."</p>

  <p>"To correct the simile, Frank, we wouldn't scrap a leaky vacuum
  pump&mdash; we'd repair it. And some of the people who run things aren't
  bad&mdash;they just need an educational repair job...."</p>

  <p>"Try and do one on them. Suggest an educational qualification for
  political office. You'd run straight into the right divine of a democracy to
  elect all the shysters and nitwits it wants."</p>

  <p>"An educational qualification wouldn't keep out the shysters."</p>

  <p>"Then let's have one for voters. That might do something."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it would give the shysters the best chance they've ever had of
  fixing elections."</p>

  <p>"Not if it was done properly."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be. The one-man-one-vote idea may have its absurdities, but
  in practice it keeps the fixers at bay. And the fools cancel each other out
  on either side."</p>

  <p>"That's the most cynical argument in favor of a two-party system I ever
  heard. But what if somebody starts a party that doesn't have any fools?"</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, Frank, only a fool would do that."</p>

  <p>He laughed enormously, enjoying the argument as much as I did. I wish I
  could remember more of it; it lasted several hours, and though I didn't agree
  with him altogether, and he tended to over-stress and overload his points,
  much that he said was somehow a crystallization of my own drifting
  misgivings. I particularly recall one of his remarks&mdash;that if the
  development of atomic energy was, as might be claimed, the biggest landmark
  in human knowledge since the discovery of fire, then the decision whether or
  not to use it for destruction was the biggest ethical question mark since the
  one that faced Pilate.</p>

  <p>"And the odd thing is," he added, "that even in a democracy this decision
  has been or will be made without the mass of the people having the ghost of
  an idea of what's afoot. Is that bad? Or is it inevitable? Or both?... Mind
  you, I'm not suggesting you can hold an election or a referendum about it in
  the middle of a war. But if the ethical question should crop up any time in
  the future, would it be a valid excuse for an average citizen to plead that
  he didn't know what was going on in his own country? Because that's the
  excuse we'll get from a lot of Germans when we blame them for the
  concentration camps."</p>

  <p>"But in their case it won't be true."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. Middle-class respectable folks are so damned
  innocent&mdash; what does my Aunt Lavinia know about the brothels that exist
  only a few blocks from her house?... But the time's coming when ignorance
  <i>won't</i> be an excuse, it <i>mustn't</i> be, it ought to be the last of
  all the excuses one can ever accept. Which, incidentally, is why I'm all for
  free speech and free education. <i>Mehr Licht,</i> Goethe called it."</p>

  <p>I asked what he thought an individual could do, and he answered: "Little
  enough, till the war's ended, except think things out and occasionally talk
  them over with a kindred spirit&mdash;as we're doing now. Matter of fact, I'm
  very loyally co-operating with the authorities&mdash;you noticed how
  carefully I brought you into this bedroom before we began to talk? I insist
  that when I discuss science with a fellow scientist no bellhop shall be
  listening at the keyhole."</p>

  <p>He went on to talk of the future and the possibilities of infinite
  disaster to the world. Once or twice what he said reminded me of that old
  argument with Julian Spee at your house years ago&mdash;it was frightening to
  realize how much that had then been purely speculative and philosophical had
  since become sober prophecy. And it was frightening also to realize that such
  a phrase as "the collapse of civilization" struck an almost stale
  note&mdash;the sort of subject you'd set for a schoolboy's essay or a college
  debating forum. We'd all been warned so much and so often, the average man
  was bored rather than scared. "Yet you can't exaggerate the mess we're
  in&mdash;a technological crisis bringing to a head the moral crisis that
  we've all shirked for centuries. It's infinitely beyond any question of how
  much can be kept secret by one nation for a few more years at most. I tell
  you frankly I <i>am</i> scared, and when I talk with people who aren't I get
  more scared than ever. Mind you, don't think I'm in favor of handing over
  secrets, such as they are, to all and sundry as an act of faith. If any
  country's got to get ahead, even in a rat race, let it be ours. But there's
  the whole pity of it. Atomic energy's such a big thing it's the curse of Cain
  that we should be thinking first of bombs. It could make heaven on earth if
  only we'd let it&mdash;if only we'd use it for peace with a tenth of the
  energy we've worked on it for war. And that's where research comes in&mdash;
  open research inside a framework of free science. So far as I'm concerned,
  Free Science is the Fifth Freedom, and if we don't get it back and hang onto
  it, then count me out of science altogether&mdash;I'd rather go fishing for
  the little time that's left&mdash;rather anything than be a hired witch
  doctor muttering top- secret spells behind barbed-wire fences. Might come to
  that in the end&mdash;or just before the end. Might come to a point when you
  and I stage our sit-down strike&mdash; what you might call an
  all-war-short-of-aid policy&mdash;while our harnessed and muzzled colleagues
  carry on till the bombs start falling and they finish up, like everyone else
  on that doomsday, Men of Extinction...."</p>

  <p>I said I didn't think a sit-down strike would work, and in any case it was
  defeatist; and then suddenly something flared up inside me so that I remember
  saying: "By God, Frank, the future's not a club you can resign from! It's
  part of the whole world's problem, and as you say, we've shirked it for
  centuries. But now we've got to stop shirking it, and in that fight <i>count
  me in</i>&mdash;both as a scientist and also, if you'll pardon the
  expression, as a good American!"</p>

  <p>Sanstrom laughed and patted my arm. We were both good Americans, for that
  matter, and therefore a bit shy of striking the patriotic note. The telephone
  rang while we were still arguing; it was a girl Sanstrom was having to
  dinner; he asked me to stay and make a third, he thought I might find her
  interesting. I did; she was English, working for British
  Information&mdash;rather good- looking and vivacious and well-schooled in
  that phony understatement about her country that impresses so many outside
  it. She dropped most of the phonyness when she learned I'd been in the blitz;
  she was really quite a sincere person. And she didn't know anything about the
  Project, which was a relief; so we chattered on general topics over cocktails
  and then went out to a restaurant where they served New Orleans food. The
  conversation sank in importance as it rose in agreeableness&mdash;I guess
  that's one way of describing the rest of the evening. We returned to the
  hotel for more drinks and took her to the British Embassy, where she was
  staying; after which Sanstrom and I strolled back along Massachusetts Avenue
  in the chill evening air and calmed ourselves down. But we were still a bit
  exalted. Finally, as we shook hands at the hotel entrance, he said: "It's
  been good seeing you. Don't let things get you down. Look at me&mdash;I worry
  all the time but I don't lose weight."</p>

  <p>He was a big man, Sanstrom, not unlike Emil Jannings, if you remember
  those old films. Everything was rather oversize about him&mdash;arms and head
  and mouth and arguments and gestures&mdash;it had been hard for him to lower
  his voice in the hotel bedroom, and when I had told him what Framm had said
  about the Buck Rogers strip&mdash;"Science is the opiate of the
  people"&mdash;any cruising bellhop could have heard his laugh as far off as
  the elevators.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I asked Brad if he had talked to Sanstrom again, and he
said no; he knew
  he was a busy man and he didn't want to trade on an old friendship. As a
  matter of fact, he wandered about Washington on his own the next day, seeing
  the sights; and in the evening, because he found he could get a seat on a
  plane to Knoxville, he made the return trip with a day to spare before he was
  expected back to work. So he set out for a walk in the surrounding country.
  The air was cold and the northern slopes of the hills ribbed with
  snow&mdash;the kind of weather he liked best. He walked a long way&mdash;much
  further than usual. He felt that the talk with Sanstrom had staged some sort
  of revolution in his mind; not that he had entirely agreed with him, but the
  unaccustomed freedom of speech and exchange of ideas had shaken loose some of
  his own; and he tried to chart out this new mood of his, as accurately and as
  scientifically as he would have done any other observed but puzzling
  phenomena. Soon he came to one of the road blocks; a soldier stopped him, he
  showed his identification papers and chatted for a while, but the
  interruption made him ready to walk back. When at last he came to the hill
  from which the enormous size of the plant was spectacular, he stopped to
  stare as if he had never seen it before. He lit a cigarette and sat on a
  fence near an abandoned farm. A phrase came that seemed to fit his
  predicament&mdash;his own and Sanstrom's and the world's&mdash;a predicament
  symbolized by the identification papers he had to carry and by the soldier
  guarding the exit to the vast enclave. <i>A conspiracy of silence</i>. He
  must have seen that phrase unnumbered times&mdash;a clich&eacute; if ever there was
  one. But then, because he was physically and mentally tired, his mind glided
  easily into another phrase, not such a clich&eacute;.... <i>Conspiracy of science
  ... silence ... science ... silent science</i> but not exactly <i>holy</i>
  science ... and at that he thought he had better pull himself together and
  stop the output of what the psychiatrists call echolalia.</p>

  <p>He slept badly that night and by morning was certain of at least one
  thing&mdash;that he was headed for another breakdown if he didn't get a
  change. He realized now that even in spite of the routine character of his
  job he had been overworking, or perhaps overworrying; he knew, at any rate,
  that he had reached some climax of misgiving hardly to be put into words.</p>

  <p>He went to the head of his department that day and offered his
  resignation. It caused a small stir.</p>

  <p>What was his reason?</p>

  <p>He hesitated&mdash;he hadn't really thought out an adequate reason.</p>

  <p>Ill-health?</p>

  <p>Well no, not exactly.</p>

  <p>Overwork?</p>

  <p>Partly.</p>

  <p>Or perhaps some personal reason?</p>

  <p>Well yes, in a sort of way&mdash;a personal reason.</p>

  <p>The head of the department passed him on to a doctor, who examined him
  thoroughly without offering any comment, but said afterwards that he would
  gladly certify him in need of a rest. They were very careful (it occurred to
  him) in a considerate way, or else very considerate in a careful way. No need
  to talk of resigning&mdash;how about a leave of absence? All right. To go
  where? Oh, anywhere. New York, maybe. For how long? A month? Yes, that would
  be fine. He was by that time simply anxious to get away.</p>

  <p>He went to New York. Before leaving he was reminded of the penalties under
  the Espionage Act for any disclosure of official secrets; he said that of
  course he understood all that.</p>

  <p>In New York he rested by seeing plays, movies, and walking the streets.
  One day in the circular bar of a hotel on Lexington he thought he saw the
  same man whom he had seen a few days before walking along upper Broadway. It
  might have been, of course.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly he made up another part of his mind. He called on his draft
  board (he had been registered in New York on his return from Europe). They
  listened to what he had to say and promised to get in touch with him at the
  address he gave, a hotel on West Forty-fourth, very convenient for the
  Algonquin.</p>

  <p>A few days later a man came to see him at the hotel. He had the wrong kind
  of personality, and the interview ended with Brad exclaiming sharply: "I
  guess this is still a free country&mdash;a man can choose whether he offers
  his brains or his life for it, especially when they don't want his
  brains...."</p>

  <p>That, he realized as soon as he had said it, was absurdly melodramatic and
  by no means fair.</p>

  <p>But he insisted, and rather to his surprise they let him have his way. He
  got his calling-up notice, he took his physical (and was relieved to find
  himself passed as medically fit); he was inducted, given his choice of the
  Air Force, and in due course found he was too old to be a pilot. But he made
  a good navigator, passed all his tests in fine style and waited to be shipped
  overseas. That was about October of 1944. But they didn't send him. In fact
  he was somehow unaccountably omitted from one overseas outfit after another.
  He began to feel sure that this was deliberate. And about this time also he
  began to have an additional feeling that he was watched. Additional, that
  was, to any earlier kind of feeling. Once in a New Orleans restaurant, for
  instance, when he was talking to some civilians, he thought he recognized a
  man he had seen before in a movie house in Montgomery. But of course it might
  not have been, because when you begin looking round for faces you have seen
  before <i>and seeing them</i>, a certain danger point has been reached. From
  then, doubtless, his special neurosis dated.</p>

  <p>And then came the crash in Texas.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We lay back in the warm air, and the story somehow petered
out in random
  afterthoughts prompted by my own questions, but presently both question and
  answer followed at longer intervals till there was at last a silence; and it
  was then, without any words between us, that I knew he loved me. It wasn't
  entirely love-making that had made me sure of that, because love-making isn't
  so very unique, but there was something quieter and rarer that showed in the
  way he looked at me&mdash;the deep unspoken assumption that all was well
  between us, no matter what was ill with the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>The sun dipped behind the ridge and it was time we were beginning to
  return. We walked to the plane, still without speaking; he climbed in and
  gave me the signals; I swung the prop and got in the seat behind, willing for
  him to do the flying if he wanted, though there had been no arrangement about
  it. He taxied across the lake bed into what wind was left; it was almost a
  glassy calm by now; the mountains looked like stage scenery. He made a sharp
  take-off, the professional kind, and set an immediate course for Lost Water,
  climbing till the sun was visible, then higher than necessary till the far
  ranges came in sight, pink-tipped with snow. Nothing moving caught the eye
  except the long shadows of the wings, crawling over rock and sand; and all
  the time I was thinking over what he had said, till suddenly the effort of
  thought broke through a barrier and I wasn't thinking at all, but just living
  the moments through with him, whether he knew it or not.</p>

  <p>About six thousand feet he closed the throttle.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he shouted, over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Fine," I answered.</p>

  <p>In case he wanted to talk I chose one of the many topics, but not the most
  abstruse. "I like what you told me about Sanstrom," I said. "I wish I'd been
  in time to know him in London."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's a good fellow. A bit technicolored for a scientist, if you know
  what I mean, but perhaps that's not always a fault. Some of us are too
  black-and-white."</p>

  <p>"You ought to keep in touch with him. Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"I think in the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

  <p>"They're about a thousand miles off the coast of Ecuador&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but what on earth made him go there?"</p>

  <p>"He was sent. They suddenly put him in the army&mdash;he was only thirty
  and unmarried, so I suppose there was reason enough.... And the Gal&aacute;pagos
  Islands are quite interesting scientifically. Anyhow, he'll be back when the
  war ends. I'll see him then."</p>

  <p>"Are you hinting that because he met and talked to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm hinting nothing. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. We were watched, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"Watched in the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. After all, why not? If they distrusted me they'd want to keep
  an eye on whom I contacted. Just as they took a look at you after I wrote you
  the postcard."</p>

  <p>He throttled up and made a steep left bank till we were facing the distant
  snow line. We climbed again to make up for lost height, crossing the valley
  over ridges of nearer hills. It would be dusk soon and I was puzzled by his
  change of direction. I shouted once to ask the reason for it, but either he
  didn't hear or chose not to reply. I didn't ask again, because what he had
  said about Sanstrom had made me feel icily indifferent to whatever happened
  so long as I was with him. The thought even came that he might have some
  strange idea in mind, and if he had I believed I could make terms with it
  without rebellion. As the sky grew darker and the last glow left the
  snowpeaks I felt easier, almost cozier, than I had ever felt on earth. He
  looked round once, as if expecting me to say something, but I didn't. Then
  abruptly he made the turn.</p>

  <p>We almost had trouble at Lost Water, it was so dark. But Mr. Murdoch had
  turned on the headlights of several cars, so that we made a rough but
  satisfactory landing. He cursed us, threatened to report us, and finally
  asked us to remember that when the war was over he could put us in the way of
  good bargains in used planes.</p>

  <p>Brad drove the car&mdash;another symbol, I hoped, of his own self-
  conquest. We were several miles along the straight stretch before either of
  us spoke. Then I told him very simply that I wanted to go on helping him.</p>

  <p>"Okay," he answered, matter-of-factly. "But you might wish you hadn't
  taken on the job."</p>

  <p>"I'm not scared. They can't send <i>me</i> to any islands."</p>

  <p>"Now listen," he said, embarrassedly. "Maybe I shouldn't have told you
  that about Sanstrom. I've no proof&mdash;and besides, if they really
  suspected me I can see their problem. I wouldn't have minded being sent there
  myself&mdash;might have been a good place to think things out. I'm an odd
  creature&mdash;you ought to be warned about it. I don't seem to have the
  knack of being most likely to succeed, and some people won't ever be sure I'm
  not in the pay of the enemy, whoever the enemy is, but I guess there'll
  always be an enemy."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll always have me to sort things out and put things straight.
  Even with Mr. Small."</p>

  <p>"You think you could? And with Newby too?"</p>

  <p>"Sure ... but why him particularly?"</p>

  <p>"It's a good deal up to him when I get let out of the hospital."</p>

  <p>I was glad he had brought up a matter which had been heavily on my mind; I
  had been chary of broaching it myself lest the question of getting a
  discharge might begin to worry him. I didn't myself know yet whether he would
  find it hard or not.</p>

  <p>I said guardedly: "Does the idea of going back to the hospital bother
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not especially, but I've a feeling I don't want to waste any more
  time."</p>

  <p>I thought that was the best kind of answer he could have given, so I
  promised as much as I dared. "You won't have to. I think you can count on
  that. So far as I can see, you're cured."</p>

  <p>We drove on another mile or so, and I wondered whether what I had said was
  true. Perhaps true enough. We're none of us cured, in any strict sense. And
  if he still had a complex, of guilt or persecution, or whatever it was,
  hadn't we all ... or if we hadn't, shouldn't we have?</p>

  <p>I said presently: "We've talked each other nearly hoarse, but there's one
  other thing that's been a puzzle ever since you mentioned it. You said you
  never told anyone else about the way you faked the results for Framm. I know
  that makes it a great compliment to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No? Well, never mind. But it does seem to me that if you <i>had</i> told
  others&mdash;when they questioned you&mdash;it might have been better.... Or
  were you afraid they wouldn't believe you?"</p>

  <p>"They mightn't have, that's true. But I was more afraid that they
  might."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They might have thought well of me."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And wouldn't that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted: "No, no&mdash;I'd hate to be thought well of for something
  that's on my conscience."</p>

  <p>"But you still don't regret what you did?"</p>

  <p>"I'd probably do it again in the same circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Then why should you have it on your conscience?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me. It's irrational, no doubt. I told you I was an odd
  creature."</p>

  <p>"You also told me it was a sin against the scientist's holy ghost, but I
  thought that was just the way you felt immediately after you did it."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Perhaps the ghost still haunts.... You know, Jane, choosing
  between God and Mammon gets all the publicity, but it's easy compared with
  some of the other choices...."</p>

  <p>He looked at me as if he thought I wouldn't catch that, and as if he
  wouldn't mind if I didn't.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about me," he went on. "I'll never be any
  different&mdash;I mean, about certain things."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to be. Just tell me about them. As you have been doing.
  That wasn't so hard, was it?"</p>

  <p>His mind was still on the one thing, for after a considerable pause he
  answered: "It was certainly easier than telling a fellow like Sanstrom. The
  idea of deliberately falsifying results, no matter what the reason, would
  seem a bit unprofessional to a scientist. At least I hope it would."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you told me because you didn't care what <i>I</i> thought
  of you?"</p>

  <p>He was thoughtful for another moment. Then he said: "D'you know, in a sort
  of way that's true. And yet, in another way...."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Damned if I can explain exactly how I do feel about you."</p>

  <p>"Can't you? I can explain how I feel about you. It's simple. I love
  you."</p>

  <p>I had often wondered what he would say if I told him, but since afternoon
  I had found out enough not to be apprehensive&mdash;only a little more
  curious.</p>

  <p>He said nothing for a while, then he slowed down and put his arm round me.
  "That's nice," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>I wasn't sure whether he meant what I had said or what he was doing till
  he added: "Because I love you, too."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you mentioned it," I said, half laughing because I found it
  impossible from then on to speak in a level voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, you knew, didn't you, Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;it's&mdash;it's made me so&mdash;so very happy to be
  told."</p>

  <p>We drove on another mile or so before he said: "There was always something
  between us."</p>

  <p>And till now there had always been <i>somebody</i> between us, I thought,
  but did not say.</p>

  <p>He went on musingly: "The right mixture of caring and not caring&mdash;I
  suppose that's what love is."</p>

  <p>Oh well, if he wanted to diagnose, analyze, dissect, interpret&mdash;all
  that was all right with me. His mind might be up there, but his arm wasn't;
  and we had actually said, once and in those words, that we loved each other.
  But words were my field, just as analysis was his, so we were both putting
  happiness to the test we valued most; perhaps even in mathematical terms I
  could be somewhere in his mind, just as he would be somehow in my next book,
  whatever it was.</p>

  <p>Oh God, I was happy as we drove on. It was like coming home after a winter
  walk, expecting a fire in a warm house, yet not realizing how warm and bright
  it could be ... and how dark the night outside.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When we left the desert and climbed into the hills there
was a mist that
  covered everything but the section of road ahead and the white line down the
  middle of it. Brad drove slowly and the miles crept by as if we should never
  get to Vista Grande at all. I couldn't help recalling Mr. Chandos and his
  story of the road that went nowhere, and my own suggestion of the voice on
  the radio reading the psalm that began&mdash;"Teach me, O Lord, the way of
  thy statutes"; and this, I suppose, made me switch on the car radio there and
  then. It was very faint&mdash;a news bulletin from somewhere&mdash;I could
  only catch the phrase: "This morning, on the Japanese city of
  Hiroshima...."</p>
