      <a name="RaffertysRule"></a>Rafferty&rsquo;s Rule </b></h2>
  <p>The General Manager of the Transcontinental System glared at the young man
  who stood facing him across the office desk. &ldquo;Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t
  last three months!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m qualified for the position,&rdquo; young Holman went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  done my stint with the construction gangs and I&rsquo;ve spent four years
  in the Eastern shops. You promised me that if I&rsquo;d stick I&rsquo;d have
  my chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if I did, I didn&rsquo;t promise to put you in the way of making
  a fool of yourself and a laughing-stock of me, did I? You may be qualified
  technically, I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been
  rather pleased with you; that&rsquo;s one reason why you&rsquo;re not going
  out there to tackle something you can&rsquo;t handle. If men like Rawson
  and Williams can&rsquo;t hold down the job, what do you expect to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No worse than they, at least,&rdquo; Holman answered, quietly. &ldquo;Look
  here, uncle, that&rsquo;s just the point. There aren&rsquo;t any of the men
  want the position, so I&rsquo;m not jumping anybody to take it. I&rsquo;ll
  not make any laughing-stock of you, either. I&rsquo;m not going out as the
  Old Man&rsquo;s nephew; just plain Dick Holman. If I don&rsquo;t make good
  you can wash your hands of my railroad career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the General Manager, severely, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  make rash statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pushed the papers on his desk irritably to one side. Then he frowned.
  Two years ago, when the road had dug, blasted, burrowed, and trestled its
  right of way through the mountains, they had built the repair shops for the
  maintenance of the rolling stock, and from the moment the first brass time-check
  had been issued the locomotive-foremanship of the Hill Division was no subject
  to be introduced with temerity anywhere within the precincts of the executive
  offices. One man after another had gone out there, and one after another
  they had resigned. &ldquo;Hard lot to handle,&rdquo; Carleton, the division
  superintendent, had replied to the numerous requests for explanation that
  had been fired at him. And now Dick wanted to go. The general manager&rsquo;s
  fingers beat a tattoo on the desk and his frown deepened into a scowl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  a young fool,&rdquo; he grunted at last.</p>
  <p>And Holman knew that he had gained his point &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good
  of you, uncle,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d see it my way.
  When may I start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll get there soon enough,&rdquo; his uncle answered
  grimly. He rose from his chair and accompanied Holman to the door. &ldquo;Well,
  go if you want to, but remember this, young man, you&rsquo;re going on your
  own terms. When you resign from <i>that</i> position, you resign from the
  road, understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, uncle,&rdquo; Holman laughed in reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Three days later, as Number One pulled into Big Cloud, Holman swung himself
  to the platform. Up past the mail and baggage cars, the steam drumming at
  her safety, a big ten-wheeler was backing down to couple on for the run through
  the Rockies. There was the pride of proprietorship in his glance as his eyes
  swept the great mogul critically, for in his pocket was his official appointment
  as Locomotive Foreman of the Hill Division, vice Williams, resigned.</p>
  <p>It was not until the last of the Pullmans had rolled smoothly past him that
  he turned to take stock in his surroundings. The first impression was not
  prepossessing. Before him, just across the yard filled with strings of freight
  cars, were the low, rambling, smoke-begrimed shops and running shed, while
  beyond these again the town straggled out monotonously.</p>
  <p>To the westward, through the mountains, were the curves and grades that
  wrenched and racked and tore the equipment he would hereafter be accountable
  for. To the eastward&mdash;but &ldquo;eastward&rdquo; was only two hundred
  yards away, for there his eye caught the &ldquo;Yard Limit&rdquo; post,
  that likewise marked the end of the division.</p>
  <p>If after this cursory survey there still lingered any illusions of the picturesque
  in Holman&rsquo;s mind, they were rudely dispelled by the interior of the
  barn-like structure at the side of the platform that did duty for station,
  division headquarters, general storeroom, and anything else that might seek
  the shelter of its protecting roof. The walls were adorned with such works
  of art as are afforded by the Sunday supplements, interspersed here and there
  with an occasional blue-print and time schedule. The furnishings bore unmistakable
  evidence of having seen service with the construction staff when the road
  was in the making. At the right of the door, as Holman entered, the despatcher
  was poring over the train sheet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said he in answer to Holman&rsquo;s inquiry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  the super over there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman crossed the room and proffered his credentials.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; was Carleton&rsquo;s greeting, as
  he rose and extended his hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been expecting you. Williams
  went East this morning on Number Two. Sit down. That&rsquo;s your desk there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman glanced at the battered table toward which the other pointed, then
  back again to the four days&rsquo; growth on the super&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>Carleton grinned. &ldquo;Fixings aren&rsquo;t up to what you boiled-shirt
  fellows down East are used to. Out here on the firing line most anything
  goes. I&rsquo;ve been requisitioning office fixtures for months. Ain&rsquo;t
  seen any way-bill of them yet, Davis, have you?&rdquo; he called across to
  the despatcher.</p>
  <p>Davis got up with a laugh and joined the other two. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
  he, shaking hands with Holman, &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And not likely to, either,&rdquo; continued the super. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  rough and ready out here, Holman. The staff quarters up there,&rdquo; he
  jerked his thumb toward the ceiling, &ldquo;are all-fired crude, and the
  Chinese cook is a gilt-edge thief and most persuasive liar; but we&rsquo;ve
  got the finest division of the best railroad in the world, and we&rsquo;re
  pushing stuff through the mountains on a schedule that makes Southern competition
  sick. We&rsquo;re young here yet. Some day, when the roadbed&rsquo;s shaken
  down to stay, we&rsquo;ll build the extras.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The enthusiasm and bluff heartiness of the super was contagious. Holman
  put out his hand impulsively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard a lot of you fellows
  down East,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve got a chance
  to chip in.&rdquo; His eyes swept around the room and came back to meet the
  super&rsquo;s smilingly. &ldquo;Even if accommodations <i>are</i> below &lsquo;Tourist
  Class,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added.</p>
  <p>So Holman came to the division and joined the staff. Spence, chief dispatcher,
  had shaken his head. &ldquo;Twenty-eight and locomotive foreman of <i>this</i> division
  with the roughest, toughest bunch on the system&rsquo;s pay-roll to handle!
  Hanged if he isn&rsquo;t a decent sort, though, even if he will shave and
  wear collars. Imagine Williams with creased trousers! And say, his wardrobe&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  actually got a dress suit with him! Wouldn&rsquo;t that ground the wires!
  Who is he, Carleton? Got a pull with the Old Man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t inquire,&rdquo; returned Carleton bluntly. &ldquo;Let
  him try out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If the super waited before passing judgment on the latest addition to the
  staff of the Hill Division, the shop hands did likewise&mdash;but for another
  reason. They waited for Rafferty. Rafferty was boss. Who Rafferty&rsquo;s
  boss was, was his affair, and it did not concern them. What Rafferty said&mdash;went.
  It was two weeks before he delivered his verdict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A damned pink-faced dude!&rdquo; he announced and terminated his
  remark with a stream of black-strap juice by way of an exclamation mark.</p>
  <p>The fiat had gone forth!</p>
  <p>Down in the pits, stripping the engines of their motion gear, the fitters
  passed resolutions of confidence in Rafferty&rsquo;s judgment, and among
  the lathes and planers the machinists did likewise. The concurrence of the
  forge gang was expressed by a vicious wielding of the big sledges that sent
  showers of sparks flying from the spluttering metal whenever Holman was sighted
  coming down the shop on a tour of inspection&mdash;a significant intimation
  to him to keep his distance. And that the sentiment of the shops might not
  be lacking in unanimity, the boilermakers, should Holman have the temerity
  to pause for an instant before a shell on which they were at work, would
  send up a din from their clattering hammers intolerable to any but the men
  themselves whose ears were plugged with cotton waste.</p>
  <p>As for Holman, he might have been entirely unconscious of the hostility
  and ill-will of his subordinates for all the evidence he gave of being aware
  of it. He was busy mastering the routine and details of his new position.
  For a month he said nothing; then one morning over at headquarters he turned
  to Carleton, who was reading the train mail that had just come in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did Williams resign?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Carleton, startled out of his calm by reason of
  the suddenness of the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did Williams resign?&rdquo; Holman repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Tired of the life out here, I guess,&rdquo; Carleton
  evaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it Rafferty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton turned sharply to scrutinize the other&rsquo;s countenance. Holman
  was gazing out of the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Rafferty,&rdquo; Carleton admitted after a moment.</p>
  <p>Holman&rsquo;s gaze never shifted from the window. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t
  Rafferty fired?&rdquo; he asked in the same quiet tones, but this time there
  was just the faintest tinge of accusation in his voice.</p>
  <p>Carleton&rsquo;s face flushed. An instant&rsquo;s hesitation, then he answered
  bluntly: &ldquo;He weighed more, that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Holman significantly. &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t
  you recommend Rafferty for the position long ago and save all the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would have if he could do anything more than sign his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman turned angrily to face the super. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;when
  a fellow comes out here he has to play a lone hand, eh? A show-down with
  Rafferty, shop hands, and the whole division drawing cards against him. You,
  Carleton, I didn&rsquo;t put you down as a man with a pet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton got up and put his hand on Holman&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  do it, either,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run off your schedule
  that way, son. It has always been man to man, and I wasn&rsquo;t appealed
  to. So far it has been all Rafferty. It&rsquo;s easier to get a new foreman
  than a new shop crew, so I haven&rsquo;t interfered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Holman blankly.</p>
  <p>The super laughed shortly. &ldquo;Rafferty has the men where he wants them.
  If he got on his ear he could tie us up so quick we wouldn&rsquo;t know what
  happened. A nice thing for me to admit, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s so.
  I suppose I should have nipped the whole business in the bud, but I kept
  on hoping that each new man would beat Rafferty at his own game. Has he got
  you going, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman gathered up the repair reports from his desk and started for the
  door. &ldquo;Game&rsquo;s young yet,&rdquo; he flung over his shoulder as
  he went out.</p>
  <p>From the office Holman walked up the yard to the spur tracks at the end
  of the shops where three or four engines were waiting their turn for an empty
  pit. He glanced at their numbers, comparing them with the papers he held
  in his hand, then turned and walked back, pausing on the way to inspect an
  engine, bright and clean as fresh paint and gold leaf would make her, that
  had been hauled out of the shops that morning. He passed in through the upper
  doors to the fitting-shop. Already another engine had been shunted in to
  replace the one that had gone out. Her guard-plates, links, cross-heads,
  main and connecting rods were lying on the floor beside her, and the labor
  gang were jacking and blocking her up preparatory to running the wheels out
  from underneath her.</p>
  <p>There was a trace of heightened color in Holman&rsquo;s face as he turned
  to look for Rafferty.</p>
  <p>The boss fitter was in his usual place. Down the shop, hands dug deep in
  his trousers pockets, legs spread wide apart, he swung slowly round and round
  on the little iron turntable that intersected the handcar tracks where they
  branched out in all directions through the shops. As Holman approached he
  stopped the motion indolently by allowing the toe of his boot to trail along
  the floor around the table.</p>
  <p>Holman&rsquo;s manner was quiet and his voice was soft, almost deferential,
  as he spoke: &ldquo;I see you have 483 finished, Mr. Rafferty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rafferty looked down from his superior two inches and said: &ldquo;Yis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Holman, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve run in 840 in
  her place?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Rafferty again, this time even more indifferently
  than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, really, Mr. Rafferty, I&rsquo;d like to know why you did
  it? You know I told you yesterday to be particular to take 522 next.&rdquo; Holman&rsquo;s
  tones were more nearly those of apology than of expostulation.</p>
  <p>For answer Rafferty gave a little shove with his foot and the turntable
  began to revolve slowly. During the circuit Rafferty coolly gave some directions
  to the men nearest him, and then as he once more came round facing Holman
  he stopped. &ldquo;Fwhat was ut you was sayin&rsquo;, Mr. Holman?&rdquo; he
  drawled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is the biggest division on the system, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Holman
  asked inconsequently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; demanded Rafferty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Longest division&mdash;most mileage&mdash;covers quite a stretch
  of country,&rdquo; Holman amplified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; returned the other with a grin. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll
  be thinkin&rsquo; so if you ever sthay long enough to git acquainted wid
  ut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason I am beginning to feel cramped&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
  only been here a month, you know,&rdquo; Holman smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fwhat d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, curiously, it doesn&rsquo;t seem big enough or wide enough or
  long enough for even <i>two</i> men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman purred his words in soft, mild accents, and Rafferty, understanding,
  sneered in quick retort: &ldquo;Was you thinkin&rsquo; av lavin&rsquo;, Mr.
  Holman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Holman, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
  was. I thought perhaps the matter might be adjusted, and I&rsquo;d like to
  ask your advice. Now, if you were locomotive foreman and you found that the
  foreman of this shop, in a dirty, low, underhanded fashion was discrediting
  you with the men, and furthermore flatly disobeyed your orders, what would
  you do, Mr. Rafferty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By the time Holman had completed his arraignment, Rafferty was mad&mdash;fighting
  mad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you fwhat I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; he yelled, shaking
  a great horny fist under Holman&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d plug him
  good an&rsquo; hard, that&rsquo;s fwhat I&rsquo;d do! See!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather drastic,&rdquo; Holman commented after a pause, during which
  Rafferty drew back and with hands on hips stood scowling belligerently. &ldquo;But
  desperate cases sometimes require desperate remedies, and I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo; his
  fist shot out and caught Rafferty fairly on the point of the jaw&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re
  right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rafferty, staggering back from the impact of the blow, set the table whirling.
  His feet went out from under him and he fell sprawling to the floor. As he
  picked himself up, Holman sprang toward him and swinging twice landed two
  vicious smashes on Rafferty&rsquo;s face. Then, except for a confused recollection
  of a rush of men, that was all Holman remembered until he opened his eyes
  to find himself in his bunk at headquarters with Carleton bending over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sight,&rdquo; Carleton commented grimly. &ldquo;What
  was the muss about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman explained. &ldquo;I took Rafferty&rsquo;s advice and plugged him,
  you see, and after that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for old Joe, the turner, running
  over here to tell us, they&rsquo;d have killed you. Don&rsquo;t you know
  any better than to stack up against Rafferty like that, let alone the whole
  gang? Did you expect to do them all up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. I expected there&rsquo;d be something coming to
  me, but I had to do it. I&rsquo;ll admit, Carleton, I was in a blue funk,
  but I just <i>had</i> to. Moral effect, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carleton savagely, &ldquo;the moral effect is great!
  It will be as much as your life is worth to put your head inside those shops
  again. You don&rsquo;t know the men you&rsquo;re dealing with out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, dead wrong, Carleton, I do. You said it was man
  to man, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, then, either I&rsquo;m running the shops
  or Rafferty is. Rafferty has the men with him because he&rsquo;s a bully
  and they&rsquo;re afraid of him. It was mere force of habit made them pile
  on to me. You wait until they&rsquo;re cooled off a bit and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Carleton shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bloomin&rsquo; fool,&rdquo; he
  summed up judicially, &ldquo;but here, shake! You&rsquo;ve got your grit
  with you, if you did leave your sense behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the rest of the morning Holman nursed his injuries, but at one o&rsquo;clock
  he was at his desk again. Five minutes afterward Rafferty came in. He was
  not a pretty sight with his cut lip and battered eye as he limped past both
  Spence and Holman. With a vindictive glare at the latter he marched straight
  across the room to where Carleton sat. He leaned both hands on the super&rsquo;s
  desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ut&rsquo;ll be just a show-down, Mr. Carleton, that&rsquo;s all there
  is to ut. Me or him, which?&rdquo; he announced.</p>
  <p>Carleton tilted his chair back, put his feet up on the desk and his thumbs
  in the armholes of his vest. &ldquo;State your case; Rafferty,&rdquo; he
  said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Case!&rdquo; Rafferty spluttered. &ldquo;Case is ut? I&rsquo;m sick
  av bein&rsquo; bossed bye kids out av school that was buildin&rsquo; blocks
  whin I was buildin&rsquo; enjines. I quit or he does!&rdquo; Rafferty jerked
  his thumb in Holman&rsquo;s direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all you have to say, Rafferty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size av ut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Rafferty, you can get your time,&rdquo; said Carleton
  quietly.</p>
  <p>For a moment Rafferty stared as though he had not heard aright, then he
  swung round on his heel only to turn again and face the super with a short
  laugh. &ldquo;All right, Mr. Carleton, you&rsquo;re the docthor. It&rsquo;s
  satisfied I am. Whin I go out, every bloomin&rsquo; man in the shops &lsquo;ull
  go out wid me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton&rsquo;s feet came off the desk like a shot, his chair came down
  to the floor with a bang, and the next instant he was standing in front of
  the boss fitter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See here, Rafferty,&rdquo; he blazed, &ldquo;you know me&mdash;the
  men know me. While I&rsquo;ve held the bank there&rsquo;s been fifty-two
  cards in the case and every mother&rsquo;s son of you has had a square deal.
  You know it, don&rsquo;t you? No man on this division ever came to me with
  just cause for complaint but had a chance to state his grievance on a clear
  track and no limit on his permit either. Now, I&rsquo;m entitled to the same
  line of treatment I hand out, and I won&rsquo;t stand for threats!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rafferty shifted uneasily and to hide his confusion reached for his &ldquo;chewing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; agin you, Mr. Carleton, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  givin&rsquo; you fair warnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he mumbled as his teeth met in
  the plug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you make trouble on this division you make trouble for me,&rdquo; said
  Carleton bluntly. &ldquo;As for warning, I give you warning now that if
  you start any disturbance in those shops it will be the worse for you. Now
  go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They watched him through the windows as he crossed the tracks. Finally,
  as he disappeared inside the shops, Carleton turned with a grave face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s going to be a bad business,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; Holman burst out, &ldquo;that
  the men are fools enough to quit just because one man with a grouch says
  so, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you that you didn&rsquo;t know the class of men out here&mdash;they&rsquo;re
  partisan to the core&mdash;it&rsquo;s bred in them. I&rsquo;m not blaming
  you, Holman&mdash;not for a minute! As I said this morning, I&rsquo;ve seen
  it coming for a long while&mdash;long before Williams gave up the ghost.
  Now it&rsquo;s here, we&rsquo;ll face the music, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good of you to say so, old man,&rdquo; said Holman,
  slowly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve put you in a bad hole, and it&rsquo;s up to
  me to get you out of it. Inside of two weeks with the repair shops on strike
  our rolling stock won&rsquo;t be able to handle the traffic.&rdquo; He put
  on his hat and started for the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Carleton demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rafferty&rsquo;s not going to have this all his own way. The men
  have no grievance, and I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll follow him out
  if they&rsquo;re talked to right. I&rsquo;m going over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I know it, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Carleton grimly. &ldquo;There
  may be a coroner&rsquo;s inquest before this affair is settled, perhaps more
  than one if things get nasty, but I&rsquo;m hanged if I propose starting
  in that way this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Holman replied doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m&mdash;Eh? What&rsquo;s up, Carleton? What&rsquo;s
  wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spence had bent suddenly over the key, and Carleton, with a startled exclamation,
  was staring at the words the dispatcher was hastily scribbling on the pad.
  Holman leaned over the super&rsquo;s shoulder and even as he saw Carleton
  reach to plug in the telephone connection with the roundhouse, he read the
  message: &ldquo;Number Two wrecked Eagle Pass. Send wrecker and medical assistance
  at once.&rdquo; The next instant he was flying across the yard to the shops.</p>
  <p>As he burst in through the door he was greeted with a snarl. The men were
  massed in a body around one of the locomotives in the fitting-shop, and Rafferty,
  from the cab, was talking in fierce, heated tones. At sight of the master
  mechanic he stopped short and with an oath leaped from his perch straight
  for Holman. The crowd divided, making a lane between the two men, then, with
  startling suddenness, breaking the ominous silence that had fallen, there
  came three short blasts from the shop whistle&mdash;the wrecker&rsquo;s signal.
  It halted Rafferty when but an arm&rsquo;s-length from the locomotive foreman.
  Then Holman spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hear that, men? Number Two has gone to glory up in Eagle Pass.
  You, Rafferty, get the wrecking crew together, <i>quick!</i> The rest of
  you get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; Rafferty yelled. &ldquo;A measly, putty-faced,
  starch-shirted liar, d&rsquo;ye hear? Ut&rsquo;s a plant! You can&rsquo;t
  work any sharp trick loike that on me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a low, menacing growl from the men and they edged in close. But
  Holman gave them no heed; he took a step nearer Rafferty, looking straight
  into the other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rafferty,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve a wife and
  kids, haven&rsquo;t you? And you&rsquo;re a railroad man, aren&rsquo;t you?
  Well, there&rsquo;s wives and kids and mates up there in that wreck. The
  other affair can wait until we get back. Now, will you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Rafferty went&mdash;at the head of the wreckers&mdash;out into the yard
  where the switching crew were working like beavers making up the relief train.
  Two passenger coaches to serve as ambulances, behind them a flat, then the
  wrecking crane, the tool car, and a caboose. As Rafferty was piling his men
  into the train, Holman raced across the tracks to the station. On the platform
  the doctors, hastily summoned, were crowded around Carleton. Holman stopped
  beside them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready, Carleton,&rdquo; he announced;
  then to the others: &ldquo;You fellows had better get aboard; we&rsquo;ll
  be off as soon as we get the track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spence will have the line clear in a minute,&rdquo; said Carleton,
  as the doctors started for the coaches. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending a dispatcher
  up with you; he can tap in on the wires. How many men did you scrape up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The regular crew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Rafferty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you did it, and there&rsquo;s no time for
  explanations now; but I think, Holman, you&rsquo;d better leave Rafferty
  behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And have the whole crew quit, too? It&rsquo;s no use, Carleton, he&rsquo;s
  got to go. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton shook his head doubtfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of
  you two getting up there together. There&rsquo;s no need of you going, and
  you&rsquo;d better not go. You don&rsquo;t know the man; if you think he&rsquo;ll
  forget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, I do. I told you so before; anyway, it&rsquo;s
  too late now&mdash;we&rsquo;re off. Here&rsquo;s Spence with the orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before Carleton could reply, Holman had grabbed the tissue and was running
  for the train. As he swung himself into the cab of the engine and handed
  Hurley, the driver, his orders, Rafferty climbed in from the other side.</p>
  <p>At sight of Holman, Rafferty hesitated and half turned around in the gangway
  to go back to the caboose; but Holman reached out and caught his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Rafferty,&rdquo; he said quietly. And during
  the nerve-racking thirty-mile run to Eagle Pass no other words passed between
  them. Sometimes in the mad slur of the locomotive as she hit the tangents
  their bodies touched; that was all.</p>
  <p>Holman, by virtue of railroad etiquette, had climbed to the fireman&rsquo;s
  seat and once or twice he had glanced around at the great bulk of the man
  behind him, at the grim, set features, at the eyes that would not meet his,
  and wondered at his own temerity in inviting a physical encounter. And what
  good had it done? Was Carleton right after all? Perhaps. And yet behind the
  stubbornness, the self-will, the purely physical, there must be the other
  side of the man. If he could only reach it&mdash;only touch it. He <i>had</i> touched
  it. His appeal for the injured.</p>
  <p>Hurley was eating up the miles as only a man at the throttle of a wrecker
  with clear rights could do it. A long scream from the whistle that echoed
  through the mountains above the pounding, deafening rush of the train brought
  Holman back to his immediate surroundings. Another minute and they had swung
  round the curve and thundered over the trestle that made the approach to
  the Pass.</p>
  <p>Half a mile ahead of them up the track they saw the horror. Hurley latched
  in his throttle and began to check. As the brake-shoes bit into the tires,
  Holman slipped off his seat and faced Rafferty. There was a curious look
  in the other&rsquo;s eyes, and Holman understood. Understood that here Rafferty
  was his master&mdash;and knew it. So this was the meaning of it. This was
  how he had touched the other&rsquo;s better nature! Rafferty had cunningly
  seized the opportunity of placing him at an even greater disadvantage than
  before. For an instant he hesitated as he bit his lip, then he canceled the
  personal equation. &ldquo;Go ahead, Rafferty,&rdquo; he said quietly, answering
  the unspoken challenge, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re better up in this sort of thing
  than I am. You&rsquo;re in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Rafferty without a word swung himself from the cab.</p>
  <p>To Holman the first five minutes was unnerving. It was his first bad wreck.
  Down East it had never been his province to go out with the crew&mdash;nor
  was it here, he reflected grimly, and at that moment was grateful for the
  veteran Rafferty. It was like some hideous nightmare to him. All along the
  line of burning wreckage lay the dead, their silence the more awful by contrast
  with the shrieks and cries of the wounded still imprisoned in the wreck.
  And then the feeling passed and he worked&mdash;worked like a madman.</p>
  <p>Once a woman had caught his arm and, sobbing, dragged him toward the stateroom
  end of one of the Pullmans. Through the smoke and scorching heat of the flames
  he had fought his way in, then back with the child. The woman had thrown
  her arms hysterically around his neck.</p>
  <p>It was all a mad, furious turmoil, and he gloried in it. The crunch of the
  ax through glass and woodwork, the wild rush into the heart of things to
  stagger back blinded and choked with his helpless burden. The fierce joy
  if life still lingered; the tender reverence if life were gone.</p>
  <p>Up the track toward the engine there was a crash and a chorus of excited
  cries. He rushed in that direction. A half-dozen of the wrecking crew were
  grouped around the forward baggage-car. As Holman reached them, disheveled,
  clothes torn and scorched, face blackened with smoke and daubed with blood
  where glass and splinters had cut him, the men drew back aghast, staring
  white-faced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; one cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>him!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s me! Are you crazy? What&rsquo;s the matter with
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man pointed to the blazing car. &ldquo;Some one said you was in there,
  and he went in after you just before she crumpled up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Holman shouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rafferty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Holman made a dash for the car. The men held him back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  try it, sir; it&rsquo;s too late to do any good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook them off, and with his arms crossed in front of his head to protect
  his face he half stumbled, half fell through the opening that had once been
  a door. The car was half over on its side. The trunks, dashed into a heap
  on top of each other when the car had left the track, were all that supported
  the burning roof timbers. Between the trunks and the edge of the car there
  was a little space with the floor at an angle of forty-five degrees, and
  along this, head down, Holman crawled blindly. The floor was already beginning
  to smolder, the metal-bound edges of the trunks blistered his hands as he
  touched them. His senses reeled, but on and on he crawled, and in his mind
  over and over again the one thought: &ldquo;Rafferty! My God, Rafferty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then his hands touched something soft, and slowly, painfully, inch by inch,
  he struggled back dragging Rafferty after him. Somehow he reached the door,
  then a confused jumble of noises and nothing more until he returned to consciousness,
  and to the knowledge that he was back in his room at Big Cloud with the almond-eyed
  factotum in attendance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Belly much better? Likee eat?&rdquo; inquired that individual solicitously.</p>
  <p>Holman grinned in spite of the pain. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; then
  as he closed his eyes again he muttered: &ldquo;Tell Carleton I was right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he was, for two days afterward Rafferty publicly abdicated. He gathered
  the men in the fitting-shop and mounted to the cab of an engine jacked halfway
  up to the ceiling as before, only on this occasion it was at noon hour and
  not in the company&rsquo;s time. His words were few and to the point, delivered
  with a force and eloquence that was all his own:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sed he was a damned pink-faced dude, so I did. Well, I take ut
  back, d&rsquo;ye moind? An&rsquo; fwhat&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll flatten
  the face av any man fwhat sez I iver sed ut!&rdquo;</p>

      <a name="TheLittleSuper"></a>The Little Super</b></h2>
  <p>Tommy Regan backed the big compound mogul down past the string of dark-green
  coaches that he had pulled for a hundred and fifty miles, took the table
  with a slight jolt, and came to a stop in the roundhouse. As he swung himself
  from the cab, Healy, the turner, came up to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great lad, that av yours,&rdquo; Healy began, with a
  shake of his head&mdash;&ldquo;a great lad; but mind ye this, Tommy Regan,
  there&rsquo;ll be trouble for me an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; him an&rsquo; the
  whole av us, if you don&rsquo;t watch him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter this time, John?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matter,&rdquo; said Healy, ruefully; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s matter
  enough. The little cuss come blame near running 429 into the pit a while
  back, so he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; Regan asked, with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Devil a bit I know. I chased him out, an&rsquo; he started for over
  by the shops. An&rsquo; about an hour ago your missus come down an&rsquo; said
  the bhoy was no-wheres to be found, an&rsquo; that you was to look for him.&rdquo; Regan
  pulled out his watch. &ldquo;Six-thirty. Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  go over and see if Grumpy knows anything about him. Next time the kid shows
  up around here, John, you give him the soft side of a tommy-bar, and send
  him home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Healy scratched his head. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  do ut. He&rsquo;s a foine lad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan crossed the yard to the gates of the big shops. They were still unlocked,
  and he went through into the storekeeper&rsquo;s office. Grumpy was sorting
  the brass time-checks. He glanced up as Regan came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; fer yer kid again,&rdquo; he
  said sourly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am, Steve,&rdquo; Regan returned, diplomatically
  dispensing with the other&rsquo;s nickname.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Grumpy announced, returning to
  his checks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been through the shops, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d
  seen him if he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The engineer&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;He must be somewhere about, Steve.
  John said he saw him come over here, and the wife was down to the roundhouse
  looking for him, so he didn&rsquo;t go home. Let&rsquo;s go through the shops
  and see if we can&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get no overtime fer chasin&rsquo; lost kids,&rdquo; growled
  Grumpy.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, he got up and walked through the door leading into the forge-shop,
  which Regan held open for him. The place was gloomy and deserted. Here and
  there a forge-fire, dying, still glowed dully. At the end of the room the
  men stopped, and Grumpy, noting Regan&rsquo;s growing anxiety, gave surly
  comfort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t likely be here, anyhow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fitting-shop
  fer him; but we&rsquo;ll try the machine-shop first on the way through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men went forward, prying behind planers, drills, shapers, and lathes.
  The machines took grotesque shapes in the deepening twilight, and in the
  silence, so incongruous with the usual noisy clang and clash of his surroundings,
  Regan&rsquo;s nervousness increased.</p>
  <p>He hurried forward to the fitting-shop. Engines on every hand were standing
  over their respective pits in all stages of demolition, some on wheels, some
  blocked high toward the rafters, some stripped to the bare boiler-shell.
  Regan climbed in and out of the cabs, while Grumpy peered into the pits.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw! he ain&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; said Grumpy in disgust, wiping his
  hands on a piece of waste. &ldquo;I told you he wasn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s
  home, mabbe, by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan shook his head. &ldquo;Bunty! Ho, Bunt-<i>ee</i>&rdquo; he called.
  And again: &ldquo;Bun-<i>tee!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, and he turned to retrace his steps when Grumpy caught
  him by the shoulder. The big iron door of the engine before them swung slowly
  back on its hinges, and from the front end there emerged a diminutive pair
  of shoes, topped by little short socks that had once been white, but now
  hung in grimy folds over the tops of the boots. A pair of sturdy, but very
  dirty, bare legs came gradually into view as their owner propelled himself
  forward on his stomach. They dangled for a moment, seeking footing on the
  plate beneath; then a very small boy, aged four, in an erstwhile immaculate
  linen sailor suit, stood upright on the foot-plate. The yellow curls were
  tangled with engine grease and cemented with cinders and soot. Here and there
  in spots upon his face the skin still retained its natural color.</p>
  <p>Bunty paused for a moment after his exertions to regain his breath, then,
  still gripping a hammer in his small fist, he straddled the draw-bar, and
  slid down the pilot to the floor.</p>
  <p>Grumpy burst into a guffaw.</p>
  <p>Bunty blinked at him reprovingly, and turned to his father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s been fixin&rsquo; the &lsquo;iger-&rsquo;ed,&rdquo; he
  announced gravely.</p>
  <p>Regan surveyed his son grimly. &ldquo;Fixing what?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;iger-&rsquo;ed,&rdquo; Bunty repeated. Then reproachfully: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  know w&rsquo;at a &lsquo;iger-&rsquo;ed is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Regan, &ldquo;the nigger-head, eh? Well, I guess
  there&rsquo;s another nigger-head will get some fixing when your mother sees
  you, son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He picked the lad up in his arms, and Bunty nestled confidingly, with one
  arm around his father&rsquo;s neck. His tired little head sank down on the
  paternal shoulder, and before they had reached the gates Bunty was sound
  asleep.</p>
  <p>In the days that followed, Bunty found it no easy matter to elude his mother&rsquo;s
  vigilance; but that was only the beginning of his troubles. The shop gates
  were always shut, and the latch was beyond his reach. Once he had found them
  open, and had marched boldly through, to find his way barred by the only
  man of whom he stood in awe. Grumpy had curtly ordered him away, and Bunty
  had taken to his heels and run until his small body was breathless.</p>
  <p>The roundhouse was no better. Old John would have none of him, and Bunty
  marveled at the change.</p>
  <p>He was a railroad man, and the shops were his heritage. His soul protested
  vigorously at the outrage that was being heaped upon him.</p>
  <p>It took him some time to solve the problem, but at last he found the way.
  Each afternoon Bunty would trudge sturdily along the track for a quarter
  of a mile to the upper end of the shops, where the big, wide engine doors
  were always open. Here four spur-tracks ran into the erecting-shop, and Bunty
  found no difficulty in gaining admittance. Once safe among the fitting-gang,
  the little Super, as the men called him, would strut around with important
  air, inspecting the work with critical eyes.</p>
  <p>One lesson Bunty learned. Remembering his last interview with his mother,
  he took good care not to be locked in the shops again. So each night when
  the whistle blew he fell into line with the men, and, secure in their protection,
  would file with them past Grumpy as they handed in their time-checks. And
  Grumpy, unmindful of the spur-tracks, wondered how he got there, and scowled
  savagely.</p>
  <p>When Bunty was six, his father was holding down the swivel-chair in the
  Master Mechanic&rsquo;s office of the Hill Division, and Bunty&rsquo;s allegiance
  to the shops wavered. Not from any sense of disloyalty; but with his father&rsquo;s
  promotion a new world opened to Bunty, and fascinated him. It was now the
  yard-shunter and headquarters that engaged his attention. The years, too,
  brought other changes to Bunty. The curls had disappeared, and his hair was
  cut now like his father&rsquo;s. Long stockings had replaced the socks, and
  he wore real trousers; short ones, it is true, but real trousers none the
  less, with pockets in them.</p>
  <p>When school was over, he would fly up and down the yard on the stubby little
  engine, and Healy, doing the shunting then and forgetting past grievances,
  would let Bunty sit on the driver&rsquo;s seat. In time Bunty learned to
  pull the throttle, but the reversing-lever was too much for his small stature,
  and the intricacies of the &ldquo;air&rdquo; were still a little beyond him.
  But Healy swore he&rsquo;d make a driver of him&mdash;and he did.</p>
  <p>The evenings at the office Bunty loved fully as well. Headquarters were
  not much to boast about in those days. That was before competition forced
  a doubletrack system, and the train-dispatcher, with his tissue sheets, still
  held undisputed sway. They called them &ldquo;offices&rdquo; at Big Cloud
  out of courtesy&mdash;just the attic floor over the station, with one room
  to it. The floor space each man&rsquo;s desk occupied was his office.</p>
  <p>Here Bunty would sit curled up in his father&rsquo;s chair and listen to
  the men as they talked. If it was anything about a locomotive, he understood;
  if it was traffic or bridges or road-bed or dispatching, he would pucker
  his brows perplexedly and ask innumerable questions. But most of all he held
  Spence, the chief dispatcher, in deep reverence.</p>
  <p>Once, to his huge delight, Spence, holding his hand, had let him tap out
  an order. It is true that with the O. K. came back an inquiry as to the brand
  the dispatcher had been indulging in; but the sarcasm was lost on Bunty,
  for when Spence with a chuckle read off the reply, Bunty gravely asked if
  there was any answer. Spence shook his head and laughed. &ldquo;No, son;
  I guess not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to maintain our dignity,
  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That winter, on top of the regular traffic, and that was not light, they
  began to push supplies from the East over the Hill Division, preparing to
  double track the road from the western side of the foothills as soon as spring
  opened up. And while the thermometer crept steadily to zero, the Hill Division
  sweltered.</p>
  <p>Everybody and everything got it, the shops and the road-beds, the train
  crews and the rolling-stock. What little sleep Carleton, the super, got,
  he spent in formulating dream plans to handle the business. Those that seemed
  good to him when he awoke were promptly vetoed by the barons of the General
  Office in the far-off East.</p>
  <p>Regan got no sleep. He raced from one end of the division to the other,
  and he did his best. Engine crews had to tinker anything less than a major
  injury for themselves: there was no room in the shops for them.</p>
  <p>But the men on the keys got it most of all. As the days wore into months,
  Spence&rsquo;s face grew careworn and haggard; and the irritability from
  overwork of the men about him added to his discomfort. Human nature needs
  a safety-valve, and one night near the end of January when Regan and Carleton
  and Spence were gathered at the office, with Bunty in his accustomed place
  in his father&rsquo;s chair, the master mechanic cut loose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, Spence,&rdquo; he cried savagely, bringing
  his fist down with a crash on the desk. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a pair of
  wheels on the division fit to pull a hand-car. Every engine&rsquo;s a cripple,
  and getting lamer every day. The engine ain&rsquo;t built, nor never will
  be, that&rsquo;ll stand the schedule you&rsquo;re putting them on through
  the hills, especially through the Gap. That&rsquo;s a three per cent, with
  the bed like an S. You can&rsquo;t make time there; you&rsquo;ve got to crawl.
  You&rsquo;re pulling the stay-bolts out of my engines, that&rsquo;s what
  you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton, being in no angelic mood, and glad to vent his feelings, growled
  assent.</p>
  <p>Spence raised his head from the keys, a red tinge of resentment on his cheeks.
  He picked up his pipe, packing it slowly as he looked at Regan and the super. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  taking all they&rsquo;re sending,&rdquo; he said quietly. He reached over
  for the train-sheet and handed it to the super. &ldquo;You and Regan here
  are growling about the schedule. It&rsquo;s your division, Carleton; but
  I&rsquo;m not sure <i>you</i> know just what we&rsquo;re handling every twenty-four
  hours. It&rsquo;s push them through on top of each other somehow, or tell
  them down East we can&rsquo;t handle them. Do you want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carleton, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; and what&rsquo;s
  more, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spence nodded. &ldquo;I rather figured that was your idea. Well, we&rsquo;ve
  about all we can do without nagging one another. I&rsquo;m near in now, and
  so are you and Regan here, both of you. I&rsquo;ve got to make time, Gap
  or no Gap. There&rsquo;s so much moving there isn&rsquo;t siding enough to
  cross them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Carleton; &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t afford
  to jump each other. We&rsquo;re all doing our best, and each of us knows
  it. How&rsquo;s Number One and Two tonight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spence studied for a moment before he answered: &ldquo;Number One is forty
  minutes off, and Number Two&rsquo;s an hour to the bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton groaned. The Imperial Limited West and East, officially known on
  the train-sheets as One and Two, carried both the transcontinental mail and
  the de-luxe passengers. Of late the East had been making pertinent suggestions
  to the Division Superintendent that it would be as well if those trains ran
  off the Hill Division with a little more regard for their established schedule.
  So Carleton groaned. He got up and put on his hat and coat preparatory to
  going home. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said from the doorway, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
  stand for &rsquo;most anything if we don&rsquo;t misuse One and Two. They&rsquo;re
  getting mighty savage about that, and they&rsquo;ll drop hard before long.
  You fellows have got to take care of those trains, if nothing else on the
  division moves. That&rsquo;s orders. I&rsquo;ll shoulder all kicks coming
  on the rest of the traffic. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Bunty left the office that night and walked home with his father, he
  had learned that there was another side to railroading besides the building
  and repairing of engines, and the delivery of magic tissue sheets to train
  crews that told them when and where to stop, and how to thread their way
  through hills and plains on a single-track road, with heaps of other trains,
  some going one way, some another. He understood vaguely and in a hazy kind
  of way that somewhere, many, many miles away, were men who sat in judgment
  on the doings of his father and Spence and Carleton; that these men were
  to be obeyed, that their word was law, and that their names were President
  and Directors.</p>
  <p>So Bunty, trotting beside his father, pondered these things. Being too weighty
  for him, he appealed: &ldquo;Daddy, what&rsquo;s president and directors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan&rsquo;s temper being still ruffled, he answered shortly: &ldquo;Fools,
  mostly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bunty nodded gravely, and his education as a railroad man was almost complete.
  The rest came quickly, and the Gap did it.</p>
  <p>The Gap! There was not a man on the division, from track-walker to superintendent,
  who would not jump like a nervous colt if you said &ldquo;Gap!&rdquo; to
  them offhand and short-like. A peaceful stretch of track it looked, a little
  crooked, as Regan said, hugging the side of the mountain at the highest point
  of the division. The surroundings were undeniably grand. A sheer drop of
  eighteen-hundred feet to the ca&ntilde;on below, with the surrounding mountains
  rearing their snow-capped peaks skyward, completed a picture of which the
  road had electrotypes and which it used in their magazine-advertising. What
  the picture did not show was the two-mile drop, where the road-bed took a
  straight three per cent and sometimes better, to the lower levels. So when
  Carleton or Spence or Regan, reading their magazines, saw the picture, they
  shuddered, and, remembering past history and fearful of the future, turned
  the page hurriedly.</p>
  <p>But to Bunty the Gap possessed the fascination of the unknown. He was wakened
  early the next morning by his father&rsquo;s voice talking excitedly over
  the special wire with headquarters about the Gap and a wreck. He sat bolt
  upright, and listened with all his might; then he crawled noiselessly out
  of bed, and began to dress hastily. He heard his father speaking to his mother,
  and presently the front door banged. Bunty was dressed by that time and he
  crept downstairs and opened the door softly.</p>
  <p>It was just turning daylight as he started on a run for the yard. It was
  not far to the office,&mdash;a hundred yards or so,&mdash;and Bunty reached
  there in record time. Across the tracks by the roundhouse they were coupling
  on to the wrecker; and answering hasty summons, men, running from all directions,
  were quickly gathering.</p>
  <p>Bunty hesitated a minute on the platform, then he entered the station and
  tiptoed softly up the stairs. The office door was open, and from the top
  stair Bunty could see into the room. The night lamp was still burning on
  the dispatcher&rsquo;s desk, and Spence was sitting there, working with frantic
  haste to clear the line. In the center of the room, the super, his father,
  and Flannagan, the wrecking boss, were standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a freight smash,&rdquo; Carleton was saying to Flannagan&mdash;&ldquo;east
  edge of the Gap. You&rsquo;ll have rights through, and no limit on your permit.
  Tell Emmons if he doesn&rsquo;t make it in better than ninety minutes he&rsquo;ll
  talk to me afterward. By the time you get there, Number Two will be crawling
  up the grade. She&rsquo;s pulling the Old Man&rsquo;s car, and that means
  get her through somehow if you have to drop the wreck, over the cliff. You
  can back down to Riley&rsquo;s to let her pass. We&rsquo;ll do the patching
  up afterward. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flannagan nodded, and glanced impatiently at Spence.</p>
  <p>The super opened and shut his watch. &ldquo;Ready, Spence?&rdquo; he asked
  shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; Spence answered quietly.</p>
  <p>Bunty waited to hear no more. He turned and ran down the stairs and across
  the tracks as fast as his legs would carry him. He scrambled breathlessly
  up the steps of the tool-car and edged his way in among the men grouped near
  the door. He was fairly inside before they noticed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; cried Allan, Bunty&rsquo;s bosom friend of the fitting-gang
  days, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the little Super! What you doin&rsquo; here, kid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to the wreck,&rdquo; Bunty announced sturdily.</p>
  <p>The men laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I guess <i>not</i> much, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;What
  do you think your father would say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Bunty, airily. &ldquo;I just comed from the
  office,&rdquo; he added artfully, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you about the
  wreck if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men grouped around him in a circle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at the Gap,&rdquo; Bunty began, sparring for time as through
  the window he saw Flannagan coming from the office at a run. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
  a freight train, and&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all smashed up, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The train started with a jerk that nearly took the men off their feet. At
  the same time Flannagan&rsquo;s face appeared at the car door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All here, boys?&rdquo; he called. Then he announced cheerfully: &ldquo;The
  devil&rsquo;s to pay up the line!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Bunty, taking advantage of the interruption, had squirmed his
  way through the men to the far end of the car, and the train had bumped over
  the switches on to the main line before they remembered him. Then it was
  too late. They hauled him out from behind a rampart of tools, where he had
  intrenched himself, and Flannagan shook his fist, half-angrily, half-playfully,
  in Bunty&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You little devil, what are you doing here, eh?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>And Bunty answered as before: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Flannagan, with a grin. &ldquo;Well, I guess
  you are, and I guess you&rsquo;ll be sorry, too, when you get back and your
  dad gets hold of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Bunty was safe now, and he only laughed.</p>
  <p>Breakfastless, he shared the men&rsquo;s grub and listened wide-eyed as
  they talked of wrecks in times gone by; but most of all he listened to the
  story of how his father, when he was pulling Number One, had saved the Limited
  by sticking to his post almost in the face of certain death. Bunty&rsquo;s
  father was his hero, and his small soul glowed with happiness at the tale.
  He begged so hard for the story over again that Allan told it, and when he
  had finished, he slapped Bunty on the back. &ldquo;And I guess you&rsquo;re
  a chip of the old block,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>And Bunty was very proud, squaring his shoulders, and planting his feet
  firmly to swing with the motion of the car.</p>
  <p>The speed of the train slackened as they struck the grade leading up the
  eastern side of the Gap. Flannagan set the men busily at work overhauling
  the kit. He paused an instant before Bunty. &ldquo;Look here, kid,&rdquo; he
  said, shaking a warning finger, &ldquo;you keep out of the way, and don&rsquo;t
  get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It would have taken more than words from Flanna-gan to have curbed Bunty&rsquo;s
  eagerness; so when the train came to a stop and the men tumbled out of the
  car with a rush, he followed. What he saw caused him to purse his lips and
  cry excitedly, &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Right in front of him a big mogul had turned turtle. Ditched by a spread
  rail, she had pulled three boxcars with her, and piled them up, mostly in
  splinters, on the tender. They had taken fire, and were burning furiously.
  Behind these were eight or ten cars still on the road-bed, but badly demolished
  from bumping over the ties when they had left the rails. Still farther down
  the track in the rear were the rest of the string, apparently uninjured.
  The snow was knee-deep at the side of the track, but Bunty plowed manfully
  through it, climbing up the embankment to a place of vantage.</p>
  <p>His eyes blazed with excitement as he watched the scene before him and listened
  to the hoarse shouts of the men, the crash of pick and ax, and, above it
  all, the sharp crackle of the fire as the flames, growing in volume, bit
  deeper and deeper into the wreck. Fiercely as the men fought, the fire, with
  its long start, kept them from making any headway against it. Already it
  had reached some of the cars standing on the track.</p>
  <p>From where Bunty stood he could see the track dipping away in a long grade
  to the valley below. They called that grade the Devil&rsquo;s Slide, and
  the wreck was on the edge of it, with the caboose and some half-dozen cars
  still resting on the incline. As he looked, far below him he saw a trail
  of smoke. It was Number Two climbing the grade. By this time the excitement
  of his surroundings had worn off a little, and the arrival of the Limited
  offered a new attraction.</p>
  <p>He clambered down from his perch and began to pick his way past the wreck.
  Flannagan, begrimed and dirty, was talking to Emmons. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  like to do it,&rdquo; Bunty heard Flannagan say, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll have
  to blow up that box-car if we can&rsquo;t stop the fire any other way, or
  we&rsquo;ll have a blaze down the whole line. The train crew says there&rsquo;s
  turpentine&mdash;two cars of it&mdash;next the flat there, and if that catches&mdash;Hi,
  there, kid,&rdquo; he broke off to yell, as he caught sight of Bunty, &ldquo;you
  get back to the tool-car, and stay there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Bunty ran&mdash;in the other direction. He knew Number Two would stop
  a little the other side of the wreck, and that there would be a great big
  ten-wheeler pulling her, all as bright as a new dollar and glistening in
  paint and gold-leaf. When he pulled up breathless and happy by the side of
  Number Two, Masters, the engineer, was giving Engine 901 an oil round, touching
  the journals critically with the back of his hand as he moved along.</p>
  <p>At sight of Bunty, the engineer laid his oil-can on the slide-bars and grinned
  as he extended his hand. &ldquo;How are you, Bunty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>And Bunty, accepting the proffered hand, replied gravely: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  pretty well, Mr. Masters, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, Bunty. How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I comed up with the wrecker-train. It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; awful smash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it, now! Think they&rsquo;ll have the line cleared soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Bunty replied, eyeing the cab of the big engine wistfully. &ldquo;Not
  for ever and ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Masters&rsquo; eyes followed Bunty&rsquo;s glance. &ldquo;Want to get up
  in the cab, Bunty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; Bunty cried breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Masters, boosting the lad through the gangway.
  Then warningly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Bunty promised.</p>
  <p>It was only four hundred yards up to the wreck; but that was enough. Masters
  and his firemen left their train and went to get a view at close quarters.
  When it was all over, it was up to the wrecking boss and the engine crew
  of Number Two. Flannagan swore he blocked the trucks of the cars on the incline;
  but Flannagan lied, and he got clear. Masters and his mate had no chance
  to lie, for they broke rules, and they got their time.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, Bunty sat on the driver&rsquo;s seat of the Imperial
  Limited and watched the engineer and fireman start up the track. He lost
  sight of the men long before they reached the wreck. They were still in view,
  but he was very busy: he was playing &ldquo;pretend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bunty&rsquo;s imagination was vivid enough to make the game a fascinating
  one whenever he indulged in it, and that was often. But now it was almost
  reality, and his fancy was little taxed to supply what was lacking. He was
  engineer of the Limited, and they had just stopped at a station. He leaned
  out of the cab window to get the &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo; signal. Then his
  hand went through the motion of throwing over the reversing-lever and opening
  the throttle. And now he was off; faster and faster. He rocked his body to
  and fro to supply the motion of the cab. He sat very grim and determined,
  peering straight ahead. He was booming along now at full speed. They were
  coming to a crossing. &ldquo;<i>Too-oo-o, toot, toot!</i>&rdquo; cried Bunty
  at the top of his shrill treble, for the rules said you must whistle at every
  crossing, and Bunty knew the rules. Now they were coming to the next station,
  and he began to slow up. &ldquo;<i>Ding-dong, ding&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>BANG!</i> </p>
  <p>Bunty nearly fell from his seat with fright. Ahead of him, up the track,
  there was a column of smoke as a mass of wreckage rose in the air, and then
  a crash. Flannagan had blown up a car. Bunty stared, fascinated, not at the
  explosion, but at the rear end of the wreck on the grade. He rubbed his eyes
  in bewilderment, then he scrambled over the side of the seat. He paused half-way
  off, looking again through the front window to make sure. There was no doubt
  of it: the cars were beginning to roll down the track toward him. He waited
  for no more, but rushed to the gangway to jump off. Then he stopped as the
  story Allan had told about his father came back to him. Bunty&rsquo;s heart
  thumped wildly as he turned white-faced and determined. No truly engineer
  would leave his train; his father had not, and Bunty did not.</p>
  <p>The reversing-lever was in the back notch where Masters had left it when
  he stopped the train. It was Bunty&rsquo;s task to reach and open the throttle.
  He climbed up on the seat and stood on tiptoe. Leaning over, he grasped the
  lever with both hands and pulled it open. What little science of engine-driving
  Bunty possessed, was lost in the terror that gripped him. The runaway cars
  were only a couple of hundred yards away now, and, gaining speed with every
  rail they traveled, spelt death and destruction to the Imperial Limited,
  if they ever reached her. The men at the top of the grade were yelling their
  lungs out and waving their arms in frantic warning.</p>
  <p>The train started with a jolt that threw Bunty back on the seat. For an
  instant the big drivers raced like pin-wheels, then they bit into the rails,
  and aided by the grade, Number Two began to back slowly down the hill.</p>
  <p>Bunty picked himself up, his little frame shaking with dry sobs. The freight-cars
  had gained on him in the last minute, and had nearly reached him. Again he
  leaned over for the throttle, and hanging grimly to it, pulled it open another
  notch, and then another, and then wide open. 901 took it like a frightened
  thoroughbred. Rearing herself from the track under her two hundred and ten
  pounds of steam, she jumped into the cars behind her for a starter with a
  shock that played havoc with the passengers&rsquo; nerves. Then she settled
  down to travel. The Devil&rsquo;s Slide is two miles long, and some pretty
  fair running has been made on it in times of stress; but Bunty holds the
  record,&mdash;it&rsquo;s good yet,&mdash;and Bunty was only an amateur!</p>
  <p>It was neck and neck for a while, and there was almost a pile-up on the
  nose of 901&rsquo;s pilot before she began to hold her own. Gradually she
  began to pull away, and by the time they were half-way down the hill the
  distance between her and the truant freight-cars was widening. The speed
  was terrific.</p>
  <p>Pale and terror-stricken, Bunty now crouched on the driver&rsquo;s seat.
  Time and again the engineer&rsquo;s whistle in the cab over his head signaled,
  now entreatingly, now with frantic insistence. But Bunty gave it no heed;
  his only thought was for those cars in front of him that were always there.
  He cried to himself with little moans.</p>
  <p>There was a sickening slur as they flew round a curve. 901 heeled to the
  tangent, one set of drivers fairly lifted from the track. When she found
  her wheel base again, Bunty, shaken from his hold, was clinging to the reversing-lever.
  He shut his eyes as he pulled himself back to his seat. When he looked again,
  he saw the freight-cars hit the curve above him, then slew as they jumped
  the track and, with a crash that reached him above the roar and rattle of
  the train, the booming whir of the great drivers beneath him, go pitching
  headlong down the embankment.</p>
  <p>Bunty rose to his knees, and for the first time looked out of the side window,
  to find a new terror there as the rocks and trees and poles flashed dizzily
  by him. He turned and looked behind. A man was clinging to the hand-rail
  of the mail-car, and another, lying flat, was crawling over the coal heaped
  high on the tender. Bunty dashed the tears from his eyes; he was no &ldquo;fraidy&rdquo; kid.
  He stood up, and holding on to the frame of the window, staggered toward
  the throttle. As he reached for it, 901 lurched madly, and Bunty lost his
  balance and fell headlong upon the iron floor plate of the cab. Then it was
  all dark.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Number Two pulled into Big Cloud that night ten hours late, and it brought
  Bunty. His father and Carleton and Spence and the shop-hands were on the
  platform. From the private car, which carried the tail-lights, an elderly
  gentleman got off with Bunty in his arms. The men cheered, and while the
  master mechanic rushed forward to take his son, the super and Spence drew
  back respectfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Regan,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;you
  ought to be pretty proud of this little lad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan tried to speak, but the words choked somehow.</p>
  <p>The old gentleman swung himself back upon the car. &ldquo;Good-by, Bunty!&rdquo; he
  called.</p>
  <p>And Bunty, from the depths of the blanket they had wrapped around him, called
  back, &ldquo;Good-by, sir!&rdquo; When Bunty was propped up in bed, his
  father told him how the express messenger had stopped the train and carried
  him back into the Pullmans.</p>
  <p>Bunty listened gravely. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, nodding his head; &ldquo;they
  was awful good to me, and the man that tooked me off the train told me stories,
  and then I told him some, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo; Regan asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;bout trains and shops and presidents and directors and&mdash;and
  lots of things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presidents and directors!&rdquo; said Regan, in surprise. &ldquo;What
  did you tell him about them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told him what you said&mdash;that they was fools, and you knew, &rsquo;cause
  you&rsquo;d seen them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan whistled softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Bunty, &ldquo;he laughed, and when I asked
  him what he was laughing at, he gived me a piece of paper and told me to
  give it to you, and you&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan groaned. &ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s my time all right,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
  the paper, Bunty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He putted it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan drew the chair with Bunty&rsquo;s clothing on it toward him, and began
  a hurried search. He fished out a narrow slip of paper and unfolded it on
  his knee. It was a check for one thousand dollars payable to Master Bunty
  Regan, and signed by the President of the road.</p>

  <p>East and West now, the Transcontinental is doubletracked, all except the
  Hill Division&mdash;and that, in the nature of things, probably never will
  be. If you know the mountains, you know the Hill Division. From the divisional
  point, Big Cloud, that snuggles at the eastern foothills, the right of way,
  like the trail of a great sinewy serpent, twists and curves through the mountains,
  through the Rockies, through the Sierras, and finally emerges to link its
  steel with a sister division, that stretches onward to the great blue of
  the Pacific Ocean.</p>
  <p>It is a stupendous piece of track. It has cost fabulous sums, and the lives
  of many men; it has made the fame of some, and been the graveyard of more.
  The history of the world, in big things, in little things, in battles, in
  strife, in sudden death, in peace, in progress, and in achievement, has
  its counterpart, in miniature, in the history of the Hill Division. There
  is a page in that history that belongs to &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Breen. This
  is Breen&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>It has been written much, and said oftener, that men in every walk of life,
  save one, may make mistakes and live them down, but that the dispatcher who
  falls once is damned forever. And it is true. I am a dispatcher. I know.</p>
  <p>Where he got the nickname &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; from, is more than I can tell
  you, and I&rsquo;ve wondered at it often enough myself. Contrast, I guess
  it was. Contrast with the boisterous, rough and ready men around him, for
  this happened back in the early days when men were what a life of hardship
  and no comfort made them. No, Breen wasn&rsquo;t soft&mdash;far from it.
  He was just quiet and mild-mannered. It must have been that&mdash;contrast.
  Anyway, he was &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; when I first knew him, and you can draw
  your own conclusions as to what he is now&mdash;I&rsquo;m not saying anything
  at all about that.</p>
  <p>Where did he come from? What was he before he came here? I don&rsquo;t know.
  I don&rsquo;t believe anybody knew, or ever gave the matter a thought. That
  sort of question was never asked&mdash;it was too delicate and pointed in
  the majority of cases. A man was what he was out here, not what he had been;
  he made good, or he didn&rsquo;t. Not that I mean to imply that there was
  anything crooked or anything wrong with Breen&rsquo;s past, I&rsquo;m sure
  there wasn&rsquo;t for that matter, but I&rsquo;m just trying to make you
  understand that when I say Breen had the night trick in the dispatcher&rsquo;s
  office here in Big Cloud, I&rsquo;m beginning at the beginning.</p>
  <p>Breen wasn&rsquo;t popular. He wasn&rsquo;t a good enough mixer for that.
  Personally, it isn&rsquo;t anything I&rsquo;d hold up against him, or any
  other man. Popularity is too often cheap, and being a &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t
  always a license for a man to puff out his chest&mdash;though most of them
  do it, and that&rsquo;s the high sign that what I say is right. No, I&rsquo;m
  not moralizing, I&rsquo;m telling a story, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean before
  I get through. I say Breen wasn&rsquo;t popular. He got the reputation of
  thinking himself a little above the rank and file of those around him, stuck-up,
  to put it in cold English, and that&rsquo;s where they did him an injustice.
  It was the man&rsquo;s nature, unobtrusive, retiring&mdash;different from
  theirs, if you get my point, and they couldn&rsquo;t understand just because
  it was different. The limitations weren&rsquo;t all up to Breen.</p>
  <p>If they had known, or taken the trouble to know, as much about him as they
  could have known before passing judgment on him, perhaps things might have
  been a little different; perhaps not, I won&rsquo;t say, for it&rsquo;s pretty
  generally accepted in railroad law that a dispatcher&rsquo;s slip is a capital
  offense, and there&rsquo;s no court of appeal, no stay of execution, no anything,
  and to all intents and purposes he&rsquo;s dead from the moment that slip
  is made. There have been lots of cases like that, lots of them, and there&rsquo;s
  no class of men I pity more&mdash;a slip, and damned for the rest of their
  lives! I don&rsquo;t say that because I&rsquo;m a dispatcher myself. We&rsquo;re
  only human, aren&rsquo;t we? Mistakes like that, God knows, aren&rsquo;t
  made intentionally. Sometimes a man is overworked, sometimes queer brain
  kinks happen to him just as they do to every other man. We&rsquo;re ranked
  as human in everything but our work. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not
  right. In the last analysis I suppose it has to be that way. It&rsquo;s part
  of the game, and we know the rules when we &ldquo;sit in.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve
  no reason to complain, only I get a shiver every time I read a newspaper
  headline that I know, besides being a death-warrant, is tearing the heart
  out of some poor devil. You&rsquo;ve seen the kind I mean, read scores of
  them&mdash;&ldquo;Dispatcher&rsquo;s Blunder Costs Many Lives&rdquo;&mdash;or
  something to the same effect. Maybe you&rsquo;ll think it queer, but for
  days afterward I can&rsquo;t handle an order book or a train sheet when I&rsquo;m
  on duty without my heart being in my mouth half the time.</p>
  <p>What&rsquo;s this got to do with Breen? Well, in one way, it hasn&rsquo;t
  anything to do with him; and, then again, in another way, it has. I want
  you to know that a blunder means something to a dispatcher besides the loss
  of his job. Do you think they&rsquo;re a coldblooded, calloused lot? I want
  you to know that they care. Oh, yes, they&rsquo;re human. They&rsquo;ve got
  a heart and they&rsquo;ve got a soul; the one to break, the other to sear.
  My God! think of it&mdash;a slip. That&rsquo;s the ghastly horror of it all&mdash;a <i>slip!</i> don&rsquo;t
  you think they can <i>feel?</i> don&rsquo;t you think their own agony of
  mind is punishment enough without the added reproach, and worse, of their
  fellows? But let it go, it&rsquo;s the Law of the Game.</p>
  <p>I said they didn&rsquo;t know much about Breen out here then except that
  he was a pretty good dispatcher, but as far as that goes it didn&rsquo;t
  help him any, rather the reverse, when the smash came. The better the man
  the harder the fall, what? It&rsquo;s generally that way, isn&rsquo;t it?
  Perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering what I know about him. I&rsquo;ll tell you.
  If any one knew Breen, I knew him. I was only a kid then, I&rsquo;m a man
  now. I hadn&rsquo;t even a coat&mdash;Breen gave me one. I&rsquo;m a dispatcher&mdash;Breen
  taught me, and no better man on the &ldquo;key&rdquo; than Breen ever lived,
  a better man than I could ever hope to be, yet he slipped. Do you wonder
  I shiver when I read those things? I&rsquo;m not a religious man, but I&rsquo;ve
  asked God on my bended knees, over and over again, to keep me from the horror,
  the suffering, the blasted life that came to Breen and many another man&mdash;through
  a slip. Yes, if any one knew Breen, I did. All I know, all I&rsquo;ve got,
  everything in this whole wide world, I owe to Breen&mdash;&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Breen.</p>
  <p>You probably read of the Elktail wreck at the time it happened, but you&rsquo;ve
  forgotten about it by now. Those things don&rsquo;t live long in the mind
  unless they come pretty close home to you; there&rsquo;s too many other things
  happening every hour in this big pulsing world to make it anything more than
  the sensation of the moment. But out here the details have cause enough to
  be fixed in the minds of most of us, not only of the wreck itself, but of
  what happened afterward as well&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know which of the
  two was the worse. You can judge for yourself I&rsquo;m not going into technicalities.
  You&rsquo;ll understand better if I don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll remember I
  said that the Hill Division is only single-tracked. That means, I don&rsquo;t
  need to tell you, that it&rsquo;s up to the dispatcher every second, and
  all that stands between the trains and eternity is the bit of tissue tucked
  in the engineer&rsquo;s blouse and its duplicate crammed in the conductor&rsquo;s
  side pocket. Orders, meeting points, single track, you understand? The dispatcher
  holds them all, every last one of them, for life or death, men, women and
  children, train crews and company property, all&mdash;and Breen slipped!</p>
  <p>No one knows to this day how it happened. I daresay some eminent authority
  on psychology might explain it, but the explanation would be too high-browed
  and too far over my head to understand it even if he did. I only know the
  facts and the result. Breen sent out a lap order on Number One, the Imperial
  Limited, westbound, and Number Eighty-Two, a fast freight, perishable, streaking
  east. Both were off schedule, and he was nursing them along for every second
  he could squeeze. Back through the mountains, both ways, all through the
  night, he&rsquo;d given them the best of everything&mdash;the Imperial clear
  rights, and Eighty-Two pretty nearly, if not quite, as good. Then he fixed
  the meeting point for the two trains.</p>
  <p>I read a story once where the dispatcher sent out a lap order on two trains
  and his mistake was staring at him all the time from his order book. I guess
  that was a slip of the pen, and he never noticed it. That was queer enough,
  but what Breen did was queerer still. His order book showed straight as a
  string. The freight was to hold at Muddy Lake, ten miles west of Elktail,
  for Number One. Number One, of course, as I told you, running free. Somehow,
  I don&rsquo;t know how, it&rsquo;s one of those things you can&rsquo;t explain,
  a subconscious break between the mind and the mechanical, physical action,
  you&rsquo;ve noticed it in little things you&rsquo;ve done yourself, Breen
  wired the word &ldquo;Elktail&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Muddy Lake&rdquo;&mdash;and
  never knew it&mdash;never had a hint that anything was wrong&mdash;never
  caught it on the repeat, and gave back his O. K. The order, the written order
  in the book, was exactly as it should be. It read Muddy Lake&mdash;that was
  right, Muddy Lake. You see what happened? There wasn&rsquo;t time for the
  freight to make Elktail, but she got within three miles of it&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
  as far as she ever got! In a nasty piece of track, full of trestles and gorges,
  where the right of way bends worse than the letter S, they met, the two of
  them, head on&mdash;Number One and Number Eighty-Two!</p>
  <p>And Breen didn&rsquo;t know what he had done even after the details began
  to pour in. How could he know? What was Eighty-Two doing east of Muddy Lake?
  She should have been waiting there for Number One to pass her. The order
  book showed that plain enough. And all through the rest of that night, while
  he worked like a madman clearing the line, getting up hospital relief, and
  wrecking trains&mdash;with Carleton, he was super then, gray-faced and haggard,
  like the master of a storm-tossed liner on his bridge giving orders, pacing
  the room, cursing at times at his own impotency&mdash;Breen didn&rsquo;t
  know, neither of them knew, where the blame lay. But the horror of the thing
  had Breen in its grip even then. I was there that night, and I can see him
  now bent over under the green-shaded lamp&mdash;I can see Carleton&rsquo;s
  face, and it wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant face to see. One thing I remember Breen
  said. Once, as the sounder pitilessly clicked a message more ghastly than
  any that had gone before, adding to the number of those whose lives had gone
  out forever, adding to the tale of the wounded, to the wild, mad story of
  chaos and ruin, Breen lifted his head from the key for a moment, pushed his
  hair out of his eyes with a nervous, shaky sweep of his hand, and looked
  at Carleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible, horrible,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;<i>but
   think of the man who did it</i>. Death would be easy compared to what he
   must feel. It makes me as weak as a kitten to think of it, Carleton. My
   God, man, don&rsquo;t you see! I, or any other dispatcher, might do this
   same thing to-morrow, the next day, or the day after. Tell me again, Carleton,
   tell me again, that order&rsquo;s straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your nerve,&rdquo; Carleton answered sharply. &ldquo;Whoever
  has blundered, it&rsquo;s not you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Irony? No. It&rsquo;s beyond all that, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s getting
  about as near to the tragedy of a man&rsquo;s life as you can get. It&rsquo;s
  getting as deep and tapping as near bed-rock as we&rsquo;ll ever do this
  side of the Great Divide. Think of it! Think of Breen that night&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  too big to get, isn&rsquo;t it? God pity him! Those words of his have rung
  in my ears all these years, and that scene I can see over again in every
  detail every time I close my eyes.</p>
  <p>In the few hours left before dawn that morning, there wasn&rsquo;t time
  to give much attention to the cause. There was enough else to think of, enough
  to give every last man on the division from car tink to superintendent all,
  and more, than they could handle&mdash;the investigation could come later.
  But it never came.</p>
  <p>There was no need for one. How did they find out? It came like the crack
  of doom, and Breen got it&mdash;got it&mdash;and it seemed to burst the floodgates
  of his memory open, seemed to touch that dormant chord, and he knew, knew
  as he knew that he had a God, what he had done.</p>
  <p>They found the order that made the meeting point Elktail tucked in Mooney&rsquo;s
  jumper when, after they got the crane at work, they hauled him out from under
  his engine. Who was Mooney? Engineer of the freight. They found him before
  they did any of his train crew, or his fireman either, for that matter. Dead?
  Yes. I&rsquo;m a dispatcher, look at it from the other side if you want to,
  it&rsquo;s only fair. That bit of tissue cleared Mooney, of course&mdash;but
  it sent him to his death. Yes, I know, good God, don&rsquo;t you think I <i>know</i> what
  it means&mdash;to slip?</p>
  <p>It was just before Davis, Breen&rsquo;s relief, came on for the morning
  trick, in fact Davis was in the room, when Breen got the report. He scribbled
  it on a pad, word by word as it came in, for Carleton to see. For a minute
  it didn&rsquo;t seem to mean anything to him, and then, as I say, he got
  it. I never saw such a look on a man&rsquo;s face before, and I pray God
  I never may again. He seemed to wither up, blasted as the oak is blasted
  by a lightning stroke. The horror, the despair, the agony in his eyes are
  beyond any words of mine to describe, and you wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear
  it if I could tell you. He held out his arms pitifully like a pleading child.
  His lips moved, but he had to try over and over again before any sound came
  from them. There was no thought of throwing the blame on anybody else. Breen
  wasn&rsquo;t that kind. Oh, yes, he could have done it. He could have put
  the blunder on the night man at the Gap where Mooney received his Elktail
  holding order, and Breen&rsquo;s order book would have left it an open question
  as to which of the two had made the mistake&mdash;would probably have let
  him out and damned the other. You say from the way he acted he didn&rsquo;t
  think of that and therefore the temptation didn&rsquo;t come to him. Yes,
  I know what you mean. Not so much to Breen&rsquo;s credit, what? Well, I
  don&rsquo;t know, it depends on the way you look at it. I&rsquo;d rather
  believe the thought didn&rsquo;t come because the man&rsquo;s soul was too <i>clean</i>.
  It was clean them&mdash;no matter what he did afterward.</p>
  <p>There have been death scenes of dispatchers before, many of them&mdash;there
  will be others in the days to come, many of them. So long as there are railroads
  and so long as men are frail as men, lacking the infallibility of a higher
  power, just so long will they be inevitable. But no death scene of a dispatcher&rsquo;s
  career was ever as this one was. Breen was his own judge, his own jury, his
  own executioner. Do you think I could ever forget his words? He pointed his
  hand toward the window that faced the western stretch of track, toward the
  foothills, toward the mighty peaks of the Rockies that towered beyond them,
  and the life, the being of the man was in his voice. They came slowly, those
  words, wrenched from a broken heart, torn from a shuddering soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish to God that it were me in their stead. Christ be merciful!
  I did it, Carleton. I don&rsquo;t know how. I did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one answered him. No one spoke. For a moment that seemed like all eternity
  there was silence, then Breen, his arms still held out before him, walked
  across the room as a blind man walks in his own utter darkness, walked to
  the door and passed out&mdash;alone. Those few steps across the room&mdash;alone!
  I&rsquo;ve thought of that pretty often since&mdash;they seemed so horribly,
  grimly, significantly in keeping with what there was of life left for the
  stricken man&mdash;<i>alone</i>. It&rsquo;s a pretty hard word, that, sometimes,
  and sometimes it brings the tears.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I let him go like that. I was too stunned to move
  I guess, but I reached him at the foot of the stairs as he stepped out onto
  the platform. There wasn&rsquo;t anything I could say, was there? What would
  you have said?</p>
  <p>No man knew better than Breen himself what this would mean to him. He was
  wrecked, wrecked worse than that other wreck, for his was a living death.
  There weren&rsquo;t any grand jurys or things of that kind out here then,
  not that it would have made any difference to Breen if there had been. You
  can&rsquo;t put any more water in a pail when it&rsquo;s already full, can
  you? You can&rsquo;t add to the maximum, can you? don&rsquo;t you think Breen&rsquo;s
  punishment was beyond the reach of man or men to add to, or, for that matter,
  to abate by so much as the smallest fraction? It was, God knows it was&mdash;all
  except one final twinge, that I believe now settled him, though I&rsquo;ll
  say here that whatever it did to Breen it&rsquo;s not for me to judge her.
  Who am I, that I should? It is between her and her Maker. I&rsquo;ll come
  to that in a minute.</p>
  <p>Yes, Breen knew well enough what it meant to him, but his thoughts that
  morning as we walked up the street weren&rsquo;t, I know right well, on himself&mdash;he
  was thinking of those others. And I, well, I was thinking of Breen. Wouldn&rsquo;t
  you? I told you I owed Breen everything I had in the world. Neither of us
  said a word all the way up to his boarding-house. It was almost as though
  I wasn&rsquo;t with him for all the attention he paid to me. But he knew
  I was there just the same. I like to think of that. I wasn&rsquo;t very old
  then&mdash;I&rsquo;m not offering that as an excuse, for I&rsquo;m not ashamed
  to admit that I was near to tears&mdash;if I&rsquo;d been older perhaps I
  could have said or done something to help. As it was, all I could do was
  to turn that one black thought over and over and over again in my mind. Breen&rsquo;s
  living death, death, death, death. That&rsquo;s the way it hit me, the way
  it caught me, and the word clung and repeated itself as I kept step beside
  him.</p>
  <p>He was dead, dead to hope, ambition, future, everything, as dead as though
  he lay outstretched before me in his coffin. It seemed as if I could see
  him that way. And then, don&rsquo;t ask me why, I don&rsquo;t know, I only
  know such things happen, come upon you unconsciously, suddenly, there flashed
  into my mind that bit of verse from the Bible, you know it&mdash;&ldquo;if
  a man die, shall he live again?&rdquo; I must have said it out loud without
  knowing it, for he whirled upon me quick as lightning, placed his two hands
  upon my shoulders, and stared with a startled gaze into my eyes. I say startled.
  It was, but there was more. There seemed for a second a gleam of hope awakened,
  hungry, oh, how hungry, pitiful in its yearning, and then the uselessness,
  the futility of that hope crushed it back, stamped it out, and the light
  in his eyes grew dull and died away.</p>
  <p>We had halted at the door of his boarding-house and I made as though to
  go upstairs with him to his room, but he stopped me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not now, Charlie, boy,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head and trying
  to smile; &ldquo;not now. I want to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so I left him.</p>
  <p>Alone! <i>He wanted to be alone</i>. Were ever words more full of cruel
  mockery! It seems hard to understand sometimes, doesn&rsquo;t it? And we
  get to questioning things we&rsquo;d far better leave alone. I know at first
  I used to wonder why Almighty God ever let Breen make that slip. He could
  have stopped it, couldn&rsquo;t He? But that&rsquo;s not right. We&rsquo;re
  running on train orders from the Great Dispatcher, and the finite can&rsquo;t
  span the infinite.</p>
  <p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll think it queer that I left Breen like that, let him go
  to his room alone. You&rsquo;re thinking that in his condition he might do
  himself harm&mdash;end it all, to put it bluntly. Well, that thought didn&rsquo;t
  come to me then, it did afterward, but not then. Why? It must have been just
  the innate consciousness that he wouldn&rsquo;t do that sort of thing. Some
  men face things one way, some face them another. It&rsquo;s a question of
  individuality and temperament. I don&rsquo;t think Breen could have done
  anything like that, I know he seemed so far apart from it in my mind that,
  as I say, the thought didn&rsquo;t come to me. He was too big a man, big
  enough to have faced what was before him, faced conditions, faced the men,
  though God knows they treated him like skulking coyote, if it had not been
  for her. I want to stand right on this. Breen would never have done what
  he did if she had acted differently. That much I know. But, I want to say
  it again, I&rsquo;ve no right to judge her.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve read that story of Kipling&rsquo;s about the Black
  Tyrone Regiment that saw their dead? Well, Breen, as I told you, at the beginning,
  wasn&rsquo;t popular, and the boys had seen their dead. Do you understand?
  Pariah, outcast, what you like, they made him, all except pity they gave
  him, and I say he would have taken it all, accepted it all, only there are
  some things too heavy for a man to bear, aren&rsquo;t there? Load limit,
  the engineers call it when they build their bridge. Well, there&rsquo;s a
  load limit on the heart and brain and soul of a man just as there is on a
  bridge; and while one, strained beyond the breaking point, goes crashing
  in a horrid mass of twisted wreckage to the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on, to the bottom
  of the gorge, into the rushing, boiling waters of the river beneath, the
  other crashes, a damned soul, to the bottom of hell. Kitty Mooney had seen
  her dead. Kitty Mooney, the engineer&rsquo;s sister! And Breen loved her,
  was going to marry her. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
  <p>How do I know? How do you know? Perhaps it was grief, perhaps it was hysteria,
  perhaps it was according to the light God gave her and she couldn&rsquo;t
  understand, perhaps it was only wild, unreasoning, frantic passion. I don&rsquo;t
  know. I only know she called him&mdash;a <i>murderer</i>. She couldn&rsquo;t
  have loved him, you say. Perhaps no, perhaps yes. Does it make any difference?
  Breen thought she did, and Breen loved <i>her</i>. I don&rsquo;t know. I
  only know that where he looked for a ray of mercy, <i>her</i> mercy, to light
  the blackened depths, for the touch, <i>her</i> touch, that would have held
  him back from the brink, for the word of comfort, <i>her</i> word, that would
  have bid him stand like a gallant soldier facing untold odds, he received,
  instead, a condemnation more terrible than any that had gone before, and
  a bleeding heart dried bitter as gall, a patient, grief-stricken man became
  a vicious snapping wolf, and &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Breen&mdash;a devil.</p>
  <p>Would I have been a stronger man than Breen? Would you? Would I have done
  differently than Kitty Mooney did if I had been in her place? Would you?
  We don&rsquo;t know, do we? No one knows. God keep us from ever knowing.
  The poor devil in the gutters, the wretched, ruined lives of women who have
  lost their grip and drunk the dregs, the human, stranded, battered wrecks
  we see around us, were once like you and me. We don&rsquo;t know, do we?
  God pity them! God keep us from the sneer! Our strength has never been measured.
  It may be no greater than theirs. To-morrow it may be you or I.</p>
  <p>It was pretty lawless out here in those days. We had the riff-raff of the
  East, and worse; and there was nothing to restrain them, nothing much to
  keep them in check, and they did about as they liked. They brought the touch
  into the picture of the West that the West hasn&rsquo;t lived down yet, and
  I&rsquo;m not sure ever will. The brawling, gambling, gun-handling type,
  the thief, the desperado, the bad man, rotten bad, bad to the core. They&rsquo;ve
  been stamped out now most of them, but it was different then. <i>They</i> didn&rsquo;t
  turn a cold shoulder to Breen. Why should they? They were outcasts and pariahs,
  too, weren&rsquo;t they? And Breen, well, I guess you understand as well
  as I do, and you know as I know that when a man like that goes he goes the
  limit. There&rsquo;s no middle course for some men, they&rsquo;re not made
  that way.</p>
  <p>Whatever holds them for good, or whatever holds them for bad, it holds them
  all, either way, all, body, mind and spirit, all. And that is true in spite
  of the fact that, often enough, there&rsquo;s some one thing, it may be a
  little thing, it may be a big thing, but some one thing that the worst of
  us balk at, can&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s not morality, it&rsquo;s not conscience,
  a man gets way beyond all that; it&rsquo;s a memory of the past perhaps,
  a something bred in him from babyhood. I don&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t
  treat human nature like a specimen on the glass slide under a microscope.
  There is no specimen. As there are millions of people, so is each one in
  some way different from the other. You can&rsquo;t classify, you can&rsquo;t
  tabulate the different kinks into a list and learn it by heart, can you?
  The man who says he knows human nature says he is as wise as the God who
  made him, and that man is a poor fool. That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it?
  And so I say that, strange as it may seem, in the worst of us, fall as low
  as we will, there&rsquo;s generally some one thing our soul, what&rsquo;s
  left of it, revolts at doing. Breen was a railroad man. Railroading was in
  his blood. I want you to get that. It was part of him. Any man that&rsquo;s
  worth his salt in this business is that way. It&rsquo;s in the blood or it
  isn&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;re a railroad man or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
  <p>Breen disappeared from Big Cloud and I didn&rsquo;t see him from the day
  Kitty Mooney turned him from her door until the night&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
  coming to that&mdash;that&rsquo;s the end. There&rsquo;s a word or two that
  goes before&mdash;so that you&rsquo;ll understand. He disappeared from Big
  Cloud, but he didn&rsquo;t leave the mountains. Maybe back of it all, an
  almost impossible theory if you like, but I can understand it, a something
  in him wouldn&rsquo;t let him run away. He did run away, you say. Yes, but
  there&rsquo;s the queer brain kink again. Perhaps he temporized. You temporize.
  I temporize. We try to fool and delude sometimes, snatch at loopholes, snatch
  at straws, to bolster up our self-respect, don&rsquo;t we? That&rsquo;s what
  I mean when I say it&rsquo;s possible he couldn&rsquo;t run away. He clung
  to the straw, the loophole, that running away was measured in <i>miles</i>.
  I don&rsquo;t say that was it, for I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s possible.
  We heard of him from time to time as the months went by, and the things we
  heard weren&rsquo;t pleasant things to hear. He drifted from bad to worse,
  until that something that he couldn&rsquo;t do brought him to a halt&mdash;brought
  the end.</p>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t ask me when Breen threw in his lot with Black Dempsey and the
  band of fiends that called him leader&mdash;the ugliest, soul-blackened set
  of fiends that ever polluted the West, and that&rsquo;s using pretty strong
  language. Don&rsquo;t ask me how Breen got to Big Cloud that night away from
  the others waiting to begin their hellish work. Don&rsquo;t ask me. I don&rsquo;t
  know. <i>Why</i> he did it&mdash;is different. That, I can tell you. What
  they wanted him to do, to have a part in, was that one thing I was speaking
  about, the one thing he couldn&rsquo;t do. Breen was a railroad man, railroading
  was in his blood, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;but it&rsquo;s everything&mdash;railroading
  was in his blood. As for the rest, maybe he didn&rsquo;t know what they were
  really up to until the last moment, and then stole away from them. Maybe
  they found it out, suspected him, and some of them followed him, tried to
  stop him, tried to keep him from reaching here. But what&rsquo;s the use
  of speculating? I never knew, I never will know. Breen can&rsquo;t tell me,
  can he? And all that I can tell you is what I saw and heard that night.</p>
  <p>I had the night trick then&mdash;Breen&rsquo;s job&mdash;they gave me Breen&rsquo;s
  job. It seemed somehow at first like sacrilege to take it&mdash;as though
  I was robbing him of it, taking it away from him, wronging, stripping, impoverishing
  the man to whom I owed even the knowledge that made me fit, that made it
  possible, to hold down a key&mdash;his key. Of course, that was only sensitiveness,
  but you understand, don&rsquo;t you? It caught me hard when I first &ldquo;sat
  in,&rdquo; but gradually the feeling wore off; not that I ever forgot, I
  haven&rsquo;t yet for that matter, only time blunts the sharp edges, and
  routine, habit, and custom do the rest. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that
  I remember that night. Remember it!</p>
  <p>That was before this station was built, and in those days we had an old
  wooden shack here that did duty for freight house, station, division headquarters,
  and everything else all rolled into one. The dispatcher&rsquo;s room was
  upstairs.</p>
  <p>Things were moving slick as a whistle that night. No extra traffic, no road
  troubles, in&mdash;out, in&mdash;out, all along the line the trains were
  running like clockwork from one end of the division to the other. If there
  was anything on my mind at all it was the Limited, Number Two, eastbound.
  We were handling a good deal of gold in those days, there was a lot of it
  being shipped East then&mdash;is still, from the Klondyke now, you know&mdash;and
  we were getting a fair share of the business away from the southern competition.
  We hadn&rsquo;t had any trouble, weren&rsquo;t looking for any, but it was
  pretty generally understood that all shipments of that kind were to get special
  attention. Number Two was carrying an extra express car with a consignment
  for the mint that night, so, naturally, I had kept my eye on her more closely
  than usual all the way through the mountains from the time I got her from
  the Pacific Division. At the time I&rsquo;m speaking about, four o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning, I was almost clear of her, for she wasn&rsquo;t much west
  of Coyote Bend, fifteen miles from here, and she had rights all the way in.
  Half an hour more at the most, and she would be off my hands and up to the
  dispatchers of the Prairie Division. She had held her schedule to the tick
  every foot of the way, and all I was waiting for was the call from Coyote
  Bend that would report her in and out again into the clear for Big Cloud.
  Coyote Bend is the first station west of here, you understand? There&rsquo;s
  nothing between. She was due at Coyote at 4.05, and I want you to remember
  this&mdash;I said it before, but I want to repeat it. I want you to get it <i>hard</i>&mdash;she
  had run to the second all through the night.</p>
  <p>My watch was open on the table before me, and I watched the minute hand
  creep round the dial. 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08. I was alone in
  the office. The night caller had gone out perhaps ten minutes before to call
  the train crew of the five o&rsquo;clock local. There wasn&rsquo;t anything
  to be nervous about. I don&rsquo;t put it down to that. Three minutes wasn&rsquo;t
  anything. Perhaps it was just impatience, fretfulness. You know how it is
  when you&rsquo;re waiting for something to happen, and I was expecting the
  sounder to break every second with that report from Coyote Bend, Anyway,
  put it down to what you like, though I didn&rsquo;t want a drink particularly
  I pushed back my chair, got up, and walked over to the water cooler. The
  dispatcher&rsquo;s table was on the east side of the room, the door opened
  on the south side, and the water cooler was over in the opposite corner.
  I&rsquo;m explaining this so that you&rsquo;ll understand that the door was <i>between</i> the
  water cooler and the table. That old shack was rough and ready, and I&rsquo;ve
  wondered more than once what ever kept it from falling to pieces. It didn&rsquo;t
  take more than a breath of wind to set every window-sash in the outfit rattling
  like a corps of snare drums. That&rsquo;s why, I guess, I didn&rsquo;t hear
  any one coming up the stairs. It was blowing pretty hard that night. But
  I heard the door open. I thought it was the caller back again, and I wondered
  how he&rsquo;d made his rounds in such quick time. With the tumbler half
  up to my lips I turned around&mdash;then the glass slipped from my fingers
  and crashed into slivers on the floor. My mouth went dry, my heart seemed
  to stop. I couldn&rsquo;t speak, couldn&rsquo;t move. It was Breen&mdash;&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Breen!</p>
  <p>I saw him start at the noise of the splintering glass, but he didn&rsquo;t
  look at me. He clung swaying to the door jamb for an instant, his face chalky
  white, then he reeled across the room&mdash;<i>and dropped into his old chair</i>.
  I saw him glance at my watch and his face seemed to go whiter than before,
  then he snatched at the train sheet and a smile&mdash;no, it wasn&rsquo;t
  exactly a smile, you couldn&rsquo;t call it that, his whole face seemed to
  change, light up, and his lips moved&mdash;I know now in a prayer of gratitude.
  You understand, don&rsquo;t you? He knew the time-card, knew that Number
  Two, after he had seen my watch, should have been <i>out</i> of Coyote Bend
  four, perhaps five, minutes before, but the train sheet showed her: still
  unreported. His fingers closed on the key and he began to make the Coyote
  Bend call. Over and over, quick, sharp, clear, incisive, with all the old
  masterful touch of his sending Breen was rattling the call&mdash;cc,cx&mdash;cc,cx&mdash;cc,cx&mdash;cc,cx.</p>
  <p>And then I found my voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God in Heaven, Breen!&rdquo; I stammered, and started toward him. &ldquo;You!
  What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sounder broke. Coyote Bend answered. And on the instant Breen flashed
  this order over the wire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold Number Two. Hold Number Two&rdquo;&mdash;twice the sender spelled
  out the words.</p>
  <p>Then Coyote Bend repeated the order, and Breen gave back the O. K.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Breen!&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;What are you doing? Are you crazy!
  What are you doing here? Speak, man, what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had straightened in his chair, and a sort of low, catchy gasp came from
  his lips. It seemed as though it took all his power, all his strength, to
  lift his eyes to mine. I sprang for the key, but he jerked himself suddenly
  forward and pushed me desperately away. And then he called me by the old
  name, not much above a whisper, I could hardly catch the words, and I didn&rsquo;t
  understand, didn&rsquo;t know, that the man before me was a wounded, <i>dying
  man</i>. My brain was whirling, full of that other night, full of the days
  and months that had followed. I couldn&rsquo;t think. I&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charlie&mdash;boy, it&rsquo;s all right. Black Dempsey in the Cut.
  I was afraid I was too late&mdash;too late. They shot&mdash;me&mdash;here&rdquo;&mdash;he
  was tearing with his fingers at his waistcoat.</p>
  <p>And then I understood&mdash;too late. As I reached for him, he swayed forward
  and toppled over, a huddled heap, over the key, over the order book, over
  the train sheet that once had taken his life and now had given it back to
  him&mdash;dead.</p>
  <p>What is there to say? Whatever he may have done, however far he may have
  fallen, back of it all, through it all, bigger than himself, stronger than
  any other bond was the railroading that was in his blood. Breen was a railroad
  man.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know why, do I? You don&rsquo;t know why, after Number Two
  had run to schedule all that night, it happened just when it did. It might
  have happened at some other time&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t. Luck or chance
  if you like, more than that if you&rsquo;d rather think of it in another
  way, but just a few miles west of Coyote Bend something went wrong in the
  cab of Number Two. Nothing much, I don&rsquo;t remember now what it was,
  don&rsquo;t know that I ever knew, nothing much. Just enough to hold her
  back a few minutes, the few minutes that let Breen sit in again on the night
  dispatcher&rsquo;s trick, sit in again at the key, hold down his old job
  once more before he quit railroading forever with the order that he gave
  his life to send, to keep Number Two from rushing to death and destruction
  against the rocks and boulders Black Dempsey and his gang had piled across
  the track in the Cut five miles east of Coyote Bend.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;If a man die, shall he live again?&rdquo; I leave
  it to you. I only know that they think a lot of him out here, think a lot
  of Breen, &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Breen&mdash;now.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>4<br>
      <a name="Spitzer"></a>Spitzer</b></h2>
  <p>Spitzer was just naturally born diffident. Sometimes that sort of thing
  wears off as one grows older, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. When it doesn&rsquo;t,
  it is worse than the most virulent disease&mdash;it had been virulent with
  Spitzer for all of his twenty-two years.</p>
  <p>Spitzer wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, neither was he of much account on
  the Hill Division. Some men rise to occasions, others don&rsquo;t; as for
  Spitzer&mdash;well, he was a snubby-nosed, peaked-faced, touzled-haired little
  fellow with washed-out blue eyes that always seemed to carry around an apology
  in their depths that their owner existed, and this idea was backed up a good
  bit by Spitzer&rsquo;s voice. Spitzer had a weak voice and that militated
  against him. The ordinary voice of the ordinary man on the Hill Division
  was not weak&mdash;it was assertive. Spitzer suffered thereby because everybody
  crawled over him. Nobody thought anything of Spitzer. They all knew him,
  of course, that is, those whose duties brought them within the zone of Spitzer&rsquo;s
  orbit, which was restricted to Big Cloud or, rather, to the roundhouse at
  Big Cloud. Nobody ever gave him credit for courage enough to call his soul
  his own. Even when it came to pay day he took his check as though it was
  a mistake and that it really wasn&rsquo;t meant for him. He just dubbed along,
  doing his work day after day like a faithful dog, only he was a hanged sight
  less obtrusive. Summed up in a word, Spitzer ranked as a nonentity, physically,
  mentally, professionally.</p>
  <p>Of course he never got ahead. He just kept on sweeping out the roundhouse
  and puttering around playing bell-boy to every Tom, Dick and Harry that lifted
  a finger at him. Year in, year out, he swept and wiped in the roundhouse.
  As far as seniority went he was it, but when it came to promotion he wasn&rsquo;t.
  Promotion and Spitzer were so obviously, so ostentatiously at variance with
  each other that no one ever thought of such a thing. When there was a vacancy
  others got it. Spitzer saw them move along, firing, driving spare, up to
  full-fledged regulars on the right-hand side of the cabs, men that had started
  after he did; but Spitzer still wiped and swept out the roundhouse.</p>
  <p>Carleton, the super, called him a landmark, and that hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye.
  Summer, winter, fall, spring, good weather, bad weather, five-foot-five-with-his-boots-on
  Spitzer, lugging a little tin dinner-pail, trudged down Main Street in Big
  Cloud as regular as clockwork, and reported at the roundhouse at precisely
  the same hour every morning&mdash;five minutes of seven. Never a miss, never
  a slip&mdash;five minutes of seven. The train crews got to setting their
  watches by him, and the dispatchers wired the meteorological observatory
  every time their chronometors didn&rsquo;t tally&mdash;that is, tally with
  Spitzer&mdash;and the meteorological crowd put Spitzer first across the tape
  every shot.</p>
  <p>It was just the same at night, only then Spitzer went by the six o&rsquo;clock
  whistle. Ten hours a day, Sundays off&mdash;sometimes&mdash;wiping, sweeping,
  sweeping, wiping, from his boarding-house to the roundhouse in the morning,
  from the roundhouse to his boarding-house at night&mdash;that was Spitzer,
  self-effaced, self-obliterated, innocuous, modest Spitzer.</p>
  <p>Night times? Spitzer didn&rsquo;t exist, there was no Spitzer&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
  expected of him! If any one had been asked they would have looked their amazement,
  but then no one ever was asked&mdash;or asked, which is the same thing the
  other way. Spitzer was like a tool laid away after the day&rsquo;s work and
  forgotten absolutely and profoundly until the following morning. No one knew
  anything about Spitzer after the six o&rsquo;clock whistle blew, no one knew
  and cared less&mdash;that is, none of the railroad crowd knew, and they,
  when all is said and done, were Big Cloud, they owned it, ran it, absorbed
  it, and properly so, since Big Cloud was the divisional point on the Hill
  Division.</p>
  <p>In the ineffable perversity of things is the spice and variety of life.
  Tommy Regan, the master mechanic, was a man not easily jolted, not easily
  disturbed. He was very short, very broad, with little black eyes, and a long,
  scraggly, drooping-at-the-corners, brown mustache. Also, he was blessed with
  a well-defined, well-nourished paunch&mdash;which is a sign irrefutable of
  contentment, a calm and placid outlook upon life in general and particular,
  and a freedom from the ills of haste and worry. A man with a paunch is a
  man apart and greatly to be envied, even when that paunch, as was the case
  with Regan, is of Irish extraction, for then the accompanying touch of Celtic
  temper makes him more like an ordinary, cross-grained, irritable, everyday
  mortal and less of a temperamental curiosity. Regan was justly proud of both&mdash;his
  paunch and his nationality. Regan put it the other way&mdash;his nationality
  and his paunch. That, however, is a matter for individual decision and the
  relative importance of things is as one sees it; the main thing is that one
  permitted him to use fiery words on occasion, and the other enabled him to
  preserve, ordinarily, a much to be commended state of equanimity.</p>
  <p>Perversity of perversities! It was Spitzer that jolted Regan&mdash;not once,
  more than once. And before he got through, jolted him so hard that Regan
  hasn&rsquo;t got over the wonder of it yet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think of it,&rdquo; he&rsquo;ll say, when the subject is brought
  up. &ldquo;Think of it! You know Spitzer, h&rsquo;m? Well, <i>think</i> of
  it! SPITZER!&rdquo; And if it&rsquo;s summer he&rsquo;ll mop his beady brow,
  and if it&rsquo;s winter he&rsquo;ll twiddle his thumbs with his fingers
  laced over his <i>embonpoint</i>, which is to say over the lower button of
  his waistcoat.</p>
  <p>Regan&rsquo;s first jolt came to him one morning as, after a critical inspection
  of his pets in the roundhouse&mdash;big six- and eight-wheeled mountain engines&mdash;-he
  strolled out and leaned against the push-bar on the turntable, mentally debating
  the respective merits of a rust-joint and a straight patch as specifically
  applied to number 583 that had been run into the shops the day before for
  repairs.</p>
  <p>A figure emerged from the engine doors at the far end of the roundhouse
  and came toward him. Regan&rsquo;s eyes, attracted, barely glanced in that
  direction, and then went down again in meditation, as he kicked a little
  hole in the cinders with the toe of his boot&mdash;it was only Spitzer.</p>
  <p>When he looked up again Spitzer was nearer, quite near. Spitzer had halted
  before him and was standing there patiently, an embarrassed flush on his
  cheeks, wiping his hands nervously on an exceedingly dirty piece of packing
  which in his abstraction, for Spitzer was plainly abstracted, he had picked
  up for a piece of waste.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Regan, staring at Spitzer&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;what
  you trying to do? Black up for a minstrel show?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer dropped the packing as though it had been a handful of thistles,
  and rubbed his hands up and down the legs of his overalls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Regan invited.</p>
  <p>Spitzer began to talk, rapidly, hurriedly&mdash;that is, his lips moved
  rapidly, hurriedly.</p>
  <p>Regan listened attentively and with a strained and hopeless expression,
  as he strove to catch a word and hence the drift of Spitzer&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he demanded, when he saw Spitzer was at an end. &ldquo;Speak
  out, man. You won&rsquo;t wake the baby up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer began all over again. This time he did a little better.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dollar twenty-five,&rdquo; repeated the master mechanic numbly.</p>
  <p>Spitzer brightened visibly, and nodded.</p>
  <p>Regan stared, bewildered and dumfounded. Gradually, impossible, incomprehensible,
  incongruous as it appeared, it dawned on him that Spitzer, even Spitzer, <i>Spitzer</i> was
  asking for a <i>raise!</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dollar twenty-five.&rdquo; was all Regan could repeat over again,
  and the words came away with a gasp.</p>
  <p>Spitzer, misinterpreting the tone, his face grew rueful and full of trouble.
  He was appalled at his own temerity in broaching the subject in the first
  place, but now he had overstepped the bounds&mdash;he had asked for too much!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dollar twenty,&rdquo; he ventured, in timid compromise&mdash;Spitzer
  was getting a dollar fifteen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long you been working here?&rdquo; inquired Regan, recovering
  a little and beginning to get a grip on himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four years,&rdquo; said Spitzer faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; mumbled Regan. &ldquo;Four years. A dollar twenty-five,
  h&rsquo;m? Well, I dunno, I guess we can manage that.&rdquo; And then, as
  a new thought suddenly struck him: &ldquo;What the blazes would <i>you</i> do
  with more money, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Spitzer only grinned sheepishly as, after murmuring his thanks, he walked
  back and disappeared in the roundhouse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; muttered Regan, looking after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four years, and a dollar and a quarter, <i>and</i> Spitzer! Good
  Lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan went around more or less dazed all that day. He ordered the patch
  on 583 when he had definitely decided on the rust-joint as the best tonic
  for the engine&rsquo;s complaint, and he figured out how much one dollar
  and fifteen cents a day came to for a year barring Sundays, then he did the
  same with a dollar twenty-five as the multiplicand and compared the results.
  Spitzer&rsquo;s demand was not exorbitant, and it wasn&rsquo;t much to upset
  any man&mdash;that was just it&mdash;it was Spitzer, and Spitzer wasn&rsquo;t
  much. Effect, psychological or otherwise, is by no manner of means to be
  measured by the mere magnitude of the cause, it is the phenomenal and unusual
  that is to be treated with wholesome respect, and for safe handling requires
  a double-tracked, block system with the cautionary signals up from start
  to finish&mdash;the master mechanic found it that way anyhow, and he ought
  to know.</p>
  <p>He unburdened himself that night after supper to Carleton and a few of the
  others over at division headquarters, which had been moved upstairs over
  the station, where the chiefs used to meet regularly each evening for a pipe,
  with a round of pedro thrown in to liven things up a bit&mdash;Big Cloud
  not being blessed with many attractions in the amusement line.</p>
  <p>Carleton grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bad company,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Hard lot, that of yours
  over in the roundhouse, Tommy. They&rsquo;re spoiling his manners. Been a
  long time in coming, but you know the old story of the water and the stone.
  What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in blazes would <i>he</i> do with more money?&rdquo; inquired
  Spence, the chief dispatcher, in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
  <p>Regan glared disdainfully. He had put precisely the same question to Spitzer
  himself, but since then he had been brushing up his mathematics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do with it!&rdquo; he choked. &ldquo;Thirty dollars and eighty cents&mdash;<i>a
   year</i>. Hell of a problem, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t run off your schedule,&rdquo; said Spence,
  a little tartly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s making most of
  the fuss over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell you what, Tommy,&rdquo; remarked Carleton, still grinning, &ldquo;you
  want to look out for Spitzer from now on. I guess his emancipation has begun&mdash;nothing
  like a start. Before you know it he&rsquo;ll be running roughshod over the
  motive power department, including the master mechanic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I give him the raise,&rdquo; said Regan, more to himself than aloud. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
  coming to him, what? Four years, and the first time I ever heard a yip out
  of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more,&rdquo; prophesied Carleton; &ldquo;even if
  he doesn&rsquo;t talk very loud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Regan, puckering up his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Carleton.</p>
  <p>And Regan did.</p>
  <p>Not at once, not for several weeks. But in the meantime a change came over
  Spitzer. He swept and wiped and reported at five minutes of seven every morning
  and kept himself just as much in the background, just as much out of everybody&rsquo;s
  way, just as unobtrusive as he had before, but Spitzer was none the less
  changed.</p>
  <p>It began the day after he got his raise. It was an indefinite, elusive,
  negative sort of a change, not the kind you could lay your hand on and describe
  in so many words. Regan tried to, and gave it up. The nearest he came to
  anything concrete was one day when he came around the tail-end of a tender
  and, unexpectedly, upon Spitzer. Spitzer was sweeping as usual, but Spitzer
  was also whistling&mdash;which was not usual. Regan, it is true, couldn&rsquo;t
  puzzle very much out of that, but then Regan had his limitations.</p>
  <p>Mindful of Carleton&rsquo;s words, Regan kept his eye in a mildly curious
  kind of a way on the little faded, blueeyed drudge, and as he noticed the
  first change without being able to define it, he now, after a week or so,
  noticed a second, with the difference that this time the diagnosis was painfully
  obvious&mdash;Spitzer&rsquo;s return to Spitzer&rsquo;s normal self. Spitzer
  stopped whistling.</p>
  <p>Regan began to catch Spitzer&rsquo;s eyes fixed on him with a hesitating,
  irresolute, anxious gaze about every time he entered the roundhouse. And
  though he didn&rsquo;t quite grasp it, something of the truth came to him.
  Spitzer was screwing up his courage to the sticking point preparatory to
  another step onward in his belated march toward emancipation.</p>
  <p>It was a month to the day from the first interview when Spitzer tackled
  the master mechanic again, and as before, out by the turntable in front of
  the roundhouse, and, if anything, in a manner even more nervous and ill at
  ease than on the former occasion. He stammered once or twice in an effort
  to begin&mdash;and his effort was utter failure.</p>
  <p>Regan eyed him in profound distrust. Once in four years wasn&rsquo;t so
  much, and after all, even Spitzer, now that the shock was over, might be
  expected to do that. But again in a month&mdash;and from Spitzer! Something
  was wrong&mdash;perhaps Carleton was right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;you got your raise. Ain&rsquo;t
  you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer nodded dumbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s the matter with you if you&rsquo;re satisfied?&rdquo; exploded
  the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to get&mdash;&rdquo; the last word trailed off into tremulous,
  quavering incoherency.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You want to get what?&rdquo; growled Regan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sputter
  as though you&rsquo;d swallowed your teeth. What is it you want to get?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firing,&rdquo; blurted Spitzer after a desperate struggle.</p>
  <p>Regan gasped for his breath. Spitzer! SPITZER&mdash;in a cab! He couldn&rsquo;t
  have heard straight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say it again,&rdquo; whispered the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firing,&rdquo; repeated Spitzer, with more confidence now that the
  plunge was taken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Regan weakly to himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.
  I got it right&mdash;firing! He wants to get <i>firing!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can do it,&rdquo; faltered Spitzer. &ldquo;I got to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Regan. &ldquo;You got to? Say,
  you, Spitzer, what the devil&rsquo;s the matter with you anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer wriggled like a worm on a hook, and his face went the color of a
  semaphore arm&mdash;a deep red one. Spitzer was suffering acutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; prodded Regan. &ldquo;Release the air! Take the
  brakes off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m,&rdquo; began Spitzer shamefacedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; He
  gulped down his Adam&rsquo;s apple hard, twice, and then it came away with
  a rush: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get married to Merla Swenson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan&rsquo;s jaw sagged like the broken limb of a tree, and his eyes fairly
  popped out and hung down over the roll of his cheeks. Then gradually, very
  gradually, he began to double up and unhandsome contortions afflicted his
  facial muscles. Spitzer! Spitzer was enough! But Spitzer <i>and</i> Merla
  Swenson! Six-foot-heavy-boned-long-armed Swedish-maiden Merla! Oh, contrariety,
  variety, perversity of life!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; he roared suddenly. &ldquo;Haw, haw! Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo; And
  again&mdash;only louder. The turner and a helper or two poked their noses
  out of the roundhouse doors to get a line on the disturbance.</p>
  <p>Can a stone float? Can a feather sink? Astonishing, bewildering, dumfounding,
  impossible, oh, yes; but it was also very funny. It was the funniest thing
  that Regan had ever heard in his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Ho, ho! Haw, haw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His paunch shook like jelly, and he held both hands to his sides to ease
  the pain. He straightened up preparatory to going off into another burst
  of guffaws, and then, with his mouth already opened to begin, he stopped
  as though he had been stunned. Spitzer was still standing before him, and
  Spitzer&rsquo;s head was turned away, but Regan caught it, caught the two
  big tears that rolled slowly down the grimy cheeks. And in that moment he
  realized what neither he nor any other man on the Hill Division had ever
  realized before&mdash;that Spitzer, too, was <i>human</i>.</p>
  <p>Regan coughed, choked, and cleared his throat. Here was Spitzer in a new
  light, but the Spitzer of years was not so readily to be consigned to the
  background of oblivion. Spitzer in a cab was as much an anomaly as ever,
  conjugal aspirations to the contrary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firing?&rdquo; said he, with grave consideration that he meant,
  by contrast, should serve as palliation for the sting of his mirth. &ldquo;Firing?
  I&rsquo;m afraid not. You&rsquo;re not fit for it. You&rsquo;re not big enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer dashed his hands across his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>can</i> fire,&rdquo; he announced with a surprising show of
  spirit, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I <i>got</i> to. There&rsquo;s smaller ones than
  me doing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;got to&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded the master
  mechanic.</p>
  <p>Spitzer shifted uneasily and kicked at the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merla an&rsquo; me&rsquo;s been making up for quite a while,&rdquo; he
  stammered: &ldquo;but she wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing one way or the other
  till I got a raise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you got it,&rdquo; said Regan.</p>
  <p>Spitzer nodded miserably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; now she says &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t enough to get married
  on, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have to wait till I get firing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; murmured Regan, and he mopped his brow in deep
  perplexity. The destiny of mortals was in his hands&mdash;but so was the
  motive power department of the Hill Division. He could no more see Spitzer
  in a cab than he could see the time-honored camel passing through the eye
  of a needle. Then inspiration came to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Spitzer,&rdquo; said he, soothingly. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
  any use talking about firing, and I ain&rsquo;t going to let you build up
  any false hopes. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you don&rsquo;t need to feel
  glum about it. She loves you, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spitzer&rsquo;s lips moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m?&rdquo; inquired Regan solicitously, bending forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; she says she does,&rdquo; repeated Spitzer in thin tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; well then, when you know women, and as much about &rsquo;em
  as I do, you&rsquo;ll know that nothing else counts&mdash;nothing but the
  love, I mean. It&rsquo;s their nature, and they&rsquo;re all alike. That&rsquo;s
  the way it is with all of &rsquo;em&rdquo;&mdash;Regan waved his hand expansively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right. You&rsquo;ll see. She won&rsquo;t hold
  out on that line.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some men profit much by little experience, others profit little by much
  experience. Spitzer, possibly, had had little, very little, but the dejected
  droop of his shoulders, as he started back for the roundhouse, intimated
  that in the matter of knowledge as applied to the eternal feminine he was
  perhaps, in so far as it lay between himself and the master mechanic, the
  better qualified of the two to speak. And that, certainly, when concretely
  applied, which is to say applied to Merla Swenson.</p>
  <p>Regan couldn&rsquo;t have kept the story back to save his life, and it didn&rsquo;t
  take long for the division to get it. They all got it&mdash;train crews and
  engine crews on way freights, stray freights, locals, extras and regulars,
  the staff, the shop hands, the track-walkers and the section gangs down to
  the last car-tink. At first the division looked incredulous, then it grinned,
  and then it howled, and its howl was the one word &ldquo;Spitzer!&rdquo; with
  seventeen exclamation points after it to make the tempo and rhythm hang out
  in a manner befitting and commensurate with the occasion.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows nobody good. Dutchy Damrosch did the business
  of his life&mdash;he did more business than he had ever dreamed of doing
  in his wildest flights of imagination, for Dutchy had the lunch counter rights
  at Big Cloud. What&rsquo;s that got to do with Spitzer and his marital ambition?
  Well, a whole lot! Merla Swenson was second girl in Dutchy&rsquo;s establishment,
  and Merla was the &ldquo;fee-ancy&rdquo; of Spitzer&mdash;which was a rotten
  bad pun of Spider Kelly&rsquo;s, the conductor, and due more to the brogue-like
  twist of his tongue than to any malice aforethought.</p>
  <p>To see any girl that was in love with Spitzer was worth the price of coffee
  and sinkers any old time. The lunch counter took on the air of a dime museum,
  and the visitors questioned Merla anxiously, a little suspicious that after
  all there might be a nigger in the woodpile somewhere in the shape of a &ldquo;frame-up&rdquo; with
  the hoax on themselves.</p>
  <p>Merla settled all doubts on that score. Unruffled, calmly, stoically, dispassionately
  she answered the same question fifty times a day, and each time in the same
  way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yah, I ban love Spitzer,&rdquo; was her infallible reply, in a tone
  that made the bare possibility that she could have done anything else seem
  the very acme of absurdity. Merla&rsquo;s inflexion struck deep at the root
  of things inevitable.</p>
  <p>After that there was nothing to be said. A few, very few, and as the days
  went by their numbers thinned with amazing rapidity, had the temerity to
  snicker audibly. They only did it once, as with arms akimbo and hands on
  hips Merla advanced to the edge of the counter with a look in her steadfast,
  blue eyes, that was far from inviting, and inquired: &ldquo;Him ban goot
  mans, I tank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was put in the form of a question, it is true, but the &ldquo;put&rdquo; was
  of such cold uncompromise that the result was always the same. The offender
  hastily buried his nose in his coffee-cup, dug for a dime to square his account&mdash;with
  Dutchy&mdash;and made for the platform.</p>
  <p>This was all very well, but unless Regan died and some one with a little
  less&mdash;or a little more, depending on how you look at it&mdash;imagination
  took his place, Spitzer&rsquo;s chances of getting into a cab were as good
  as ever, which is to say that they were about as good as the goodness of
  a plugged nickel. And the trouble was that, as far as Spitzer could see,
  the master mechanic wasn&rsquo;t sprouting out with any visible signs of
  premature decay. Furthermore, as he had suspicioned and now discovered, Regan <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> the
  last word on women; not, perhaps, that Merla put firing before love, only
  she was uncommonly strong on firing. Spitzer was unhappy.</p>
  <p>All things come to those who wait, they say. So they do, perhaps; but the
  way of their coming is sometimes not to be understood or fathomed. The story
  of a man who fell from the eighteenth story window of an office building,
  and, incidentally, broke his neck has no place here except in a general way.
  A friend who took a passing interest in the event was curious enough to investigate
  the cause, and he traced it back step by step, logically, surely, inevitably,
  beyond the possibility of refutation, to the fact that the second hook from
  the top on the back of the man&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s dress&mdash;not the man&rsquo;s
  dress, the dress of the man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;was missing on the morning
  of the day of his untimely decease. The man&mdash;not the man&rsquo;s friend&mdash;was
  an inventor. But no matter. It just shows. Regan being still alive, the chances
  are better than a thousand to one that Spitzer would have known a cold and
  forlorn old age, as Robert Louis puts it, and Merla would never have had
  a second edition of herself if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a few measly, unripe
  crab-apples. What? Yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;crab-apples. That&rsquo;s the
  way Spitzer got where he is to-day&mdash;just crab-apples. Funny how things
  happen sometimes when you come to think of it, isn&rsquo;t it? Spitzer and
  the man who broke his neck aren&rsquo;t the only ones who&rsquo;ve had their
  ups and downs that way, not by several. There isn&rsquo;t any moral to this
  except that here and there you&rsquo;ll find a man who isn&rsquo;t as modest
  about his own ability as he ought to be!</p>
  <p>Spitzer&rsquo;s nocturnal habits, that were a matter of so much unconcern
  and of which the railroad crowd at Big Cloud were so densely in ignorance,
  have a part in this. The truth is that between the lunch-counter and the
  station is the baggage and freight-shed, and behind the freight-shed it is
  very dark; and also, not less pertinent, is the fact that Merla was possessed
  of no other quarters than those shared by her sister-in-arms in Dutchy&rsquo;s
  employ&mdash;which were neither propitious nor commodious. Hence&mdash;but
  the connection is obvious.</p>
  <p>On Merla&rsquo;s night off at eight o&rsquo;clock, Spitzer sneaked down
  through the fields and across the platform, weather permitting, and on those
  nights Merla donned her bonnet &ldquo;for a walk&rdquo;&mdash;at the same
  hour. When the station-clock struck ten and, coincidentally, Number One&rsquo;s
  mellow chime sounded down the gorge, Merla retraced her steps to the upstairs
  rear of the lunch-counter, and Spitzer retraced his across the platform to
  the fields in the direction of the town and his boarding-house; only, of
  late, Spitzer had taken to lingering on the platform way up at the far end
  where it was also very dark and equally as deserted.</p>
  <p>Here he would gaze wistfully at the big mogul with valves popping and the
  steam drumming at her gauges, as she waited on the siding just in front of
  him&mdash;Big Cloud being a divisional point where the engines were
  changed&mdash;to back down onto Number One for the first stretch of the mountain
  run&mdash;Burke&rsquo;s run with 503, and big Jim MacAloon looking after
  the shovel end of it.</p>
  <p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything novel in the sight, but it didn&rsquo;t seem
  to strike Spitzer as monotonous although, when it was all over and he watched
  the vanishing tail lights, he always sighed. It was just the same performance
  each time. Ten minutes or so before Number One, westbound, was due, MacAloon
  would run 503 out of the roundhouse, over the turntable, up the line, and
  back onto the siding. Then Burke would appear on the scene, light a torch,
  and poke around with a long-spouted oil can.</p>
  <p>Spitzer would usually reach his position up the platform in time to see
  the engineer&rsquo;s final jab with the torch between the drivers or into
  the link-motion before swinging himself through the gangway into the cab,
  as the Limited with snapping trucks and screeching brake-shoes rolled into
  the station; but one night it fell out a little differently. The station
  clock had struck ten, Merla had hastened to her domicile, and Spitzer to
  the far end of the platform as usual, but Number One was late.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Spitzer jumped and his heart seemed to shoot into his mouth. There
  was a wild, piercing scream of agony. It came again. The blood left Spitzer&rsquo;s
  cheeks. He saw Burke fly around the end of the pilot, the torch dancing in
  his hand, and make for the cab. Spitzer involuntarily leaped from the platform
  to the track and ran in the same direction, then the safety-valve popped
  with a terrific roar, drowning out all other sounds. He clambered cautiously
  into the cab. On the floor MacAloon was going through a performance that
  would have beggared the efforts of a writhing python, and the while he groaned
  and yelled.</p>
  <p>As Spitzer watched, Burke, who was bending over MacAloon with an anxious
  face, suddenly reached forward and picked up a little round object that rolled
  from the pocket of the fireman&rsquo;s jumper, then another and another.
  Spitzer instinctively craned forward, and in so doing attracted Burke&rsquo;s
  notice for the first time. Burke&rsquo;s look of anxiety gave way to a grin
  and he held out the objects to Spitzer, just as if it wasn&rsquo;t Spitzer
  at all but an ordinary man&mdash;humor, like death, is a great leveler, but
  no matter, let that go. Burke held them out to Spitzer, Spitzer took them,
  and even Spitzer grinned. It didn&rsquo;t need any doctor to diagnose MacAloon&rsquo;s
  complaint&mdash;and the complaint wasn&rsquo;t poetic! Cramps, old-fashioned,
  unadulterated cramps&mdash;just plain cramps and green crab-apples! Some
  things lay a man out worse perhaps&mdash;but there aren&rsquo;t many.</p>
  <p>Burke&rsquo;s grin didn&rsquo;t last long, for at that moment came Number
  One&rsquo;s long, clear siren note, and back over the tender a streak of
  light shot out in a wide circle from around a butte and then danced along
  the rails and began to light up the platform, as the Limited thundered, five
  minutes late, into the straight stretch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy fishplates!&rdquo; yelled Burke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get
  a man to fire. Spitzer, you run like hell to the roundhouse and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Burke stopped. Spitzer stopped him. There are moments in everybody&rsquo;s
  life when they rise above themselves, above habit, above environment, above
  everything, if even for only a brief instant. A chance like this would never
  come again. If he could fire one trip maybe Regan would change his mind.
  Spitzer grasped at it frantically, despairingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burke, I <i>can</i> fire,&rdquo; he fairly screamed. &ldquo;Give
  me a chance, Burke. I&rsquo;ll never get one if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Burke
  gasped for a moment like a man with his breath knocked out of him, then something
  like a dry chuckle sounded in his throat. No one knows but Burke what decided
  him. It might have been either of two things, or a combination of them both&mdash;Spitzer&rsquo;s
  pleading face, or the desire to take a rise out of Regan&mdash;Burke and
  Regan not having been on the best of terms since the last general elections.
  Be that as it may, Burke pointed at the squirming fireman. &ldquo;Take his
  feet,&rdquo; he grunted.</p>
  <p>Together they lifted and dragged the stricken Mac-Aloon out of the cab and
  to the ground. 1108, pulling Number One, had come to a stop abreast of them
  by now, and Burke shouted at the engine crew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;Lend a hand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as both men stuck their heads out of the gangway, he and Spitzer boosted
  the fireman up to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got cramps,&rdquo; explained Burke tersely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
  able to fix him up in the roundhouse. Five minutes late, h&rsquo;m? Well,
  hurry, you&rsquo;re clear. There&rsquo;s your &lsquo;go-ahead.&rsquo; Pull
  out and let me get hold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Burke turned to Spitzer, as 1108 slipped away from the baggage-car and moved
  up the track, and pointed to the gangway of his own engine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a chance to
  fire, and, take it from me, you&rsquo;ll never get a chance to do that or
  anything else again this side of the happy hunting-grounds, my bucko, if
  you throw me down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And while Regan quarreled amiably over a game of pedro upstairs in the station
  with Carleton, 503, with Spitzer, touzled-haired, mild-eyed, heart-beating-like-a-trip-hammer
  Spitzer, in the cab, backed down on the Imperial Limited and coupled on for
  the mountain run. There was a quick testing of the &ldquo;air,&rdquo; a hurried
  running up and down the platform, and then Burke, leaning from the window
  with his arms stretched out inside the cab and fingers on the throttle, opened
  a notch, and the platform began to slide past them.</p>
  <p>Spitzer wrinkled his face and stared at the gauge needle&mdash;two hundred
  and ten pounds, all the way, all the time&mdash;two hundred and ten pounds.
  It was up to him. With a jerk of the chain, he swung the furnace door wide
  and a shovelful of coal shot, neatly scattered, over the grate.</p>
  <p>There is art in all things; there is the quintessence of art in the prosaic
  and laborious task of firing an engine. Spitzer was not without art, for
  in a way he had had years of experience; but banking a fire in the roundhouse,
  and nursing a roaring pit of flame to its highest degree of efficiency in
  a swaying, lurching cab, are two different and distinct operations that are
  in no way to be confounded. 503 began to lurch and sway. Notch by notch Burke
  was opening her out, and the bark of her exhaust was coming like the quick
  crackle of a gatling. Five minutes late in the mountains on a time schedule
  already marked up to a dizzy height that called for more chances than the
  passengers paid for is&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s five minutes, just <i>five
  minutes</i>, that&rsquo;s all. Some men would have left it for the Pacific
  Division crowd the next day on a level track and a straight sweep&mdash;but
  not Burke.</p>
  <p>Spitzer&rsquo;s initiation was in ample form and he got the full benefit
  of all the rites and ceremonies with every detail of the ritual worked in&mdash;and
  no favors shown. So far all was well, the rough country was all in front
  of the pilot, and Spitzer was all business. His pulse was beating in tune
  to only one thing&mdash;the dancing needle on the gauge. Again he swung the
  door open, and the red flare lighted up the heavens and played on features
  that Regan would never have known for Spitzer&rsquo;s&mdash;they were set,
  grim and determined, covered with little sweat beads that glistened like
  diamonds. The singing sweep of the wind was in his ears as he poised his
  shovel. There was a sickening slur. 503 shot round a tangent&mdash;and the
  shovelful of coal shot like bullets all over the cab, and, including Burke,
  hit about everything in sight but the objective point aimed at. Simultaneously,
  Spitzer promptly performed a gyration that resembled something like a back
  hand-spring and landed well up on the tender, to roll back to the floor of
  the cab again with an accompanying avalanche of coal.</p>
  <p>He picked himself up and glanced apprehensively at the engineer. There was
  not a scowl, not even a grin on Burke&rsquo;s face, just an encouraging flirt
  of the hand&mdash;but the flirt was momentous. Wise and full of guile was
  Burke, for with that little act Spitzer, biblically speaking, girded up his
  loins and got his second wind.</p>
  <p>They were well into the foothills now, and the right of way was an amazing
  wonder. Diving, twisting, curving, it circled and bored and trestled its
  way, and buttes, ca&ntilde;ons, gorges and coulees roared past like flights of fancy.</p>
  <p>The speed was terrific. To Spitzer it was all a wild, mad medley of things
  he had never known before, of things that had neither beginning nor end.
  The giddy slew as the big mountain racer hit the curves, the crunching grind
  of the flanges as for an instant she lifted from her wheel-base, the pitch,
  the roll, the staggering reel, the gasp for breath, the beat of the trucks,
  the whir of the racing drivers, the rush of the wind, the echoing thunder
  of the flying coaches behind&mdash;it was all there, all separate, all welded
  into one, a creation, new, vernal, life, the life of the rail, that beat
  at his eardrums and quickened the pounding throb of his heart.</p>
  <p>At first, from time to time, Burke leaned over his levers to glance at the
  pressure gauge, but after a bit he crouched a little further forward in his
  seat and his eyes held on the track ahead where the beam of the electric
  headlight flooded the glittering ribbons of steel. He was getting what MacAloon
  or no other man had ever given him before&mdash;two hundred and ten pounds <i>all</i> the
  way. SPITZER was firing Number One, the Imperial Limited, westbound, on the
  mountain run, <i>three</i> minutes late!</p>
  <p>The sweat was rolling in streams from the little fellow now, and he clung
  in the gangway for a moment&rsquo;s breathing spell, leaning out, staring
  ahead at a few shining lights in the distance. Came the hoarse scream of
  the whistle, the clattering crash as they shattered the yard switches, a
  blurred vision of dark outlines dotted with tiny scintillating points, and
  station, yard, lights, switches and all were behind him.</p>
  <p>Spitzer drew his sleeve across his forehead, and turned again to his work
  as they thundered over a long steel trestle&mdash;Thief Creek. Spitzer knew
  the road well enough at second hand, if not from personal experience. Just
  ahead was The Pass&mdash;Sucker Pass&mdash;straight enough for its quarter-mile
  stretch, but where the rock walls rose up on either side so close as to almost
  scratch the paint off the rolling stock. Eased for a moment in scant deference
  to switches and trestle just passed, Spitzer felt the forward leap of the
  racer as Burke threw her wide open again. He bent for his shovel&mdash;and
  then, quick as the winking of an eye, sudden as doom, came a tearing, rending
  crash, a scream from Burke, and the right-hand side of the cab seemed literally
  torn in two.</p>
  <p>A flying piece of woodwork that struck him across the eyes, a terrific jolt
  as the engine lifted and fell back, sent Spitzer headlong to the floor of
  the cab. Dazed, half mad with the pain, the blood streaming from his forehead,
  he staggered to his feet. Burke lay coiled in an inert heap just in front
  of him by the furnace door. A whizzing piece of steel rose up, crunched,
  slithered, gashed a track of ruin for itself, and was gone. It had missed
  Burke only by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth&mdash;next time there might not be even
  that limit of safety. With a cry, Spitzer leaped forward and dragged the
  unconscious engineer across the cab. Again the jolt, the slur, the stagger,
  the desperate wrench. It seemed like years, like eternity to Spitzer. He
  was living a lifetime in the passing of a second&mdash;it had been no more
  than that, no more than two or three at most.</p>
  <p>There are some things worse, much worse, in railroading than a broken crank-pin
  and a rod amuck, but not when it comes in The Pass, where derailment at their
  racing speed spelt death, quick and sudden. There was just one chance for
  the trailing string of coaches, just one for every last soul aboard&mdash;Spitzer.
  But between Spitzer and the throttle and the air-latch was a thing of steel
  that rose and fell, now swinging a splintering, murderous arc through the
  shattered side of the cab, now grinding into the ties land roadbed, threatening
  with every revolution to pitch 503 and the train behind her headlong from
  the rails to crumple like flimsy egg-shells against the narrow rocky walls
  that lined The Pass. Just one chance for the train crew and passengers&mdash;<i>just
  one in a thousand for Spitzer</i>. And little five-foot-five Spitzer, diffident,
  retiring, self-effaced, unobtrusive Spitzer, with a dry, choking sob in his
  throat, flung himself forward to stop the train. His hands clutched desperately
  at the levers, there was a hiss, the vicious eventualities, and that&rsquo;s
  the way it was with about nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand
  colonists. The company, of course, did take <i>some</i> risk&mdash;they took
  a chance on the one-thousandth man. The company had sporting blood.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>5<br>
      <a name="ShanleysLuck"></a>Shanley&rsquo;s Luck</b></h2>
  <p>If Shanley had only known what was going to happen, he could have saved
  some of his money on that ticket. As it stands now, he has still got transportation
  coming to him from Little Dance on the Hill Division to Bubble Creek, B.
  C. That may be an asset, or it may not&mdash;Shanley never asked for it.</p>
  <p>Third class, colonist, no stop over allowed, redhaired, freckle-faced, an
  uptilt to the nose, a jaw as square as the side of a house, shoulders like
  a bull&rsquo;s, and a fist that would fell an ox&mdash;that was Shanley.
  That was Shanley until the sprung rail that ditched the train at Little Dance
  caused him the loss of two things&mdash;his erstwhile status in the general
  passenger agent&rsquo;s department, and a well-beloved and reeking brier.</p>
  <p>Both were lost forever&mdash;his status partly on account of the reasons
  before mentioned, and partly because Shanley wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested
  in Bubble Creek; his brier because it became a part, an integral part, of
  that memorable wreck, as Shanley, who was peacefully smoking in the front-end
  compartment of the colonist coach when the trouble happened, left the pipe
  behind while he catapulted through the open door&mdash;it was summer and
  sizzling hot&mdash;and landed, a very much dazed, bewildered, but not otherwise
  hurt Shanley, halfway up the embankment on the off side of a scene of most
  amazing disorder.</p>
  <p>The potentialties that lie in a sprung rail are something to marvel at.
  Up ahead, the engine had promptly turned turtle, and, as promptly giving
  vent to its displeasure at the indignity heaped upon it, had incased itself
  in an angry, hissing cloud of steam; behind, the baggage and mail cars seemed
  to have vied with each other in affectionate regard for the tender. Only
  the brass-polished, nickel-plated Pullmans at the rear still held the rails;
  the rest was just a crazy, slewed-edge-ways, up-canted, toppled-over string
  of cars, already beginning to smoke as the flames licked into them.</p>
  <p>The shouts of those who had made their escape, the screams of those still
  imprisoned within the wreckage, the sight of others crawling through the
  doors and windows brought Shanley back to his senses. He rose to his feet,
  blinked furiously, as was his habit on all untoward occasions, and the next
  instant he was down the embankment and into the game&mdash;to begin his career
  as a railroad man. That&rsquo;s where he started&mdash;in the wreck at Little
  Dance.</p>
  <p>In and out of the blazing pyre, after a woman or a child; the crash of his
  ax through splintering woodwork; the scorching heat; prying away some poor
  devil wedged down beneath the d&eacute;bris; tinkling glass as the heat cracked
  the windows or he beat through a pane with his fist&mdash;it was all hazy,
  all a dream to Shanley as, hours afterward, a grim, gaunt figure with blackened,
  bleeding face, his clothes hanging in ribbons, he rode into the Big Cloud
  yards on the derrick car.</p>
  <p>Some men would have hit up the claim agent for a stake; Shanley hit up Carleton
  for a job. But for modesty&rsquo;s sake, previous to presenting himself before
  the superintendent&rsquo;s desk, he borrowed from one of the wrecking crew
  the only available article of wearing apparel at hand&mdash;a very dirty
  and disreputable pair of overalls. Dirty and disreputable, but&mdash;whole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want a job, Mr. Carleton,&rdquo; said he bluntly, when he had gained
  admittance to the super.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do, eh?&rdquo; replied Carleton, looking him up and down. &ldquo;You
  do, eh? You&rsquo;re a pretty hard-looking nut, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley blinked, but, being painfully aware that he undoubtedly did look
  all if not more than that, and being, too, not quite sure what to make of
  the super, he contented himself with the remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a picture, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Carleton. &ldquo;Been up at the wreck, I
  hear&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Shanley shortly. No long story, no tale of what
  he&rsquo;d done, no anything&mdash;just &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and that was
  what caught Carleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; demanded the super.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything. I&rsquo;m not fussy,&rdquo; replied Chanley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Carleton. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look it.&rdquo; And
  he favored Shanley with another prolonged stare.</p>
  <p>Shanley, at first uncomfortable, shifted nervously from one foot to the
  other; then, as the stare continued, he began to get irritated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he flung out suddenly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t on
  exhibition. I come for a job. I ain&rsquo;t got any letters of recommendation
  from pastors of churches in the East. I ain&rsquo;t got anything. My name&rsquo;s
  Shanley, an&rsquo; I haven&rsquo;t even got anything to prove <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your nerve,&rdquo; said Carleton, leaning back in
  his swivel chair and tucking a thumb in the armhole of his vest. &ldquo;Ever
  worked on a railroad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Shanley, a little less assertively, as he saw
  his chances of a job vanishing into thin air, and already regretting his
  hasty speech&mdash;a few odd nickels wasn&rsquo;t a very big stake for a
  man starting out in a new country, and that represented the sum total of
  Shanley&rsquo;s worldly wealth. &ldquo;No, I never worked on a railroad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; continued Carleton. &ldquo;Well, my friend, you
  can report to the trainmaster in the morning and tell him I said to put you
  on breaking. Get out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It came so suddenly and unexpectedly that it took Shanley&rsquo;s breath.
  Carleton&rsquo;s ways were not Shanley&rsquo;s ways, or ways that Shanley
  by any peradventure had been accustomed to. A moment before he wouldn&rsquo;t
  have exchanged one of his nickels for his chances of a job, therefore his
  reply resolved itself into a sheepish grin; moreover&mdash;but of this hereafter&mdash;Shanley
  back East was decidedly more in the habit of having his applications refused
  with scant ceremony than he was to receiving favorable consideration, which
  was another reason for his failure to rise to the occasion with appropriate
  words of thanks.</p>
  <p>Incidentally, Shanley, like a select few of his fellow creatures, had his
  failings; concretely, his particular strayings from the straight and narrow
  way, not having been hidden under a bushel, were responsible, with the advice
  and assistance of a distant relative or two&mdash;advice being always cheap,
  and assistance, in this case, a marked-down bargain&mdash;for his migration
  to the West, as far West as the funds in hand would take him&mdash;Bubble
  Creek, B. C, the distant relatives saw to that. They bought the ticket.</p>
  <p>Shanley, still smiling sheepishly and in obedience to the super&rsquo;s
  instruction to &ldquo;get out,&rdquo; was halfway to the door when Carleton
  halted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shanley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; said Shanley, finding his voice and swinging around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got any money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley&rsquo;s hand mechanically dove through the overalls and rummaged
  in the pocket of his torn and ribboned trousers&mdash;the pocket had not
  been spared&mdash;the nickels, every last one of them, were gone. The look
  on his face evidently needed no interpretation.</p>
  <p>Carleton was holding out two bills&mdash;two tens.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cleaned out, eh? Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame any one if they asked
  you for your board bill in advance. Here, I guess you&rsquo;ll need this.
  You can pay it back later on. There&rsquo;s a fellow keeps a clothing store
  up the street that it wouldn&rsquo;t do you any harm to visit&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With gratitude in his heart and the best of resolutions exuding from every
  pore&mdash;he was always long on resolutions&mdash;Shanley being embarrassed,
  and therefore awkward, made a somewhat ungraceful exit from the super&rsquo;s
  presence.</p>
  <p>But neither gratitude nor resolutions, even of steelplate, double-riveted
  variety, are of much avail against circumstances and conditions over which
  one has absolutely, undeniably, and emphatically no control. If Dinkelman&rsquo;s
  clothing emporium had occupied a site between the station and MacGuire&rsquo;s
  Blazing Star saloon, instead of the said Blazing Star saloon occupying that
  altogether inappropriate position itself, and if Spider Kelly, the conductor
  of the wrecked train, had not run into Shanley before he had fairly got ten
  yards from the super&rsquo;s office, things undoubtedly would have been very
  different. Shanley took that view of it afterward, and certainly he was justified.
  It is on record that he had no hand in the laying out of Big Cloud nor in
  the control of its real estate, rentals, or leases.</p>
  <p>Railroad men are by no stretch of the imagination to be regarded as hero
  worshipers, but if a man does a decent thing they are not averse to telling
  him so. Shanley had done several very decent things at the wreck. Spider
  Kelly invited him into the Blazing Star.</p>
  <p>Shanley demurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get some clothes,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get &rsquo;em afterward,&rdquo; said Kelly; &ldquo;plenty of time.
  Come on; it&rsquo;s just supper-time, and there&rsquo;ll be a lot of the
  boys in there. They&rsquo;ll be glad to meet you. If you&rsquo;re hungry
  you&rsquo;ll find the best free layout on the division. There&rsquo;s nothing
  small about MacGuire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley hesitated, and, proverbially, was lost.</p>
  <p>An intimate and particular description of the events of that night are on
  no account to be written. They would not have shocked, surprised, or astonished
  Shanley&rsquo;s distant relatives&mdash;but everybody is not a distant relative.
  Shanley remembered it in spots&mdash;only in spots. He fought and whipped
  Spider Kelly, who was a much bigger man than himself, and thereby cemented
  an undying friendship; he partook of the hospitality showered upon him and
  returned it with a lavish hand&mdash;as long as Carleton&rsquo;s twenty lasted;
  he made speeches, many of them, touching wrecks and the nature of wrecks
  and his own particular participation therein&mdash;which was seemly, since
  at the end, about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he slid with some dignity
  under the table, and, with the fond belief that he was once more clutching
  an ax and doing heroic and noble service, wound his arms grimly, remorselessly,
  tenaciously, like an octopus, around the table leg&mdash;and slept.</p>
  <p>MacGuire before bolting the front door studied the situation carefully,
  and left him there&mdash;for the sake of the table.</p>
  <p>The sunlight next morning was not charitable to Shanley. Where yesterday
  he had borne the marks of one wreck, he now bore the marks of two&mdash;his
  own on top of the company&rsquo;s. Up the street Dinkelman&rsquo;s clothing
  emporium flaunted a canvas sign announcing unusual bargains in men&rsquo;s
  apparel. This seemed to Shanley an unkindly act that could be expressed in
  no better terms than &ldquo;rubbing it in.&rdquo; He gazed at the sign with
  an aggrieved expression on his face, blinked furiously, and started, with
  a step that lacked something of assurance, for the railroad yards and the
  trainmaster&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>He was by no means confident of the reception that awaited him. If there
  is one characteristic over and above any other that is common to human nature,
  it is the faculty, though that&rsquo;s rather an imposing word, of worrying
  like sin over something that <i>may</i> happen&mdash;but never does. Shanley
  might just as well have saved himself the mental worry anent the trainmaster&rsquo;s
  possible attitude. He did not report to the trainmaster that morning, never
  saw that gentleman until long, very long afterward. Instead, he reported
  to Carleton&mdash;at the latter&rsquo;s urgent solicitation in the shape
  of a grinning call-boy, who intercepted his march of progress toward the
  station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hi, you, there, cherub face!&rdquo; bawled the urchin politely. &ldquo;The
  super wants you&mdash;on the hop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley stopped short, and, resorting to his favorite habit, blinked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton. Get it? Carleton,&rdquo; repeated the messenger, evidently
  by no means sure that he was thoroughly understood; and then, for a parting
  shot as he sailed gayly up the street: &ldquo;Gee, but you&rsquo;re pretty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton! Shanley had forgotten all about Carleton for the moment. His hand
  instinctively went into his pocket&mdash;and then he groaned. He remembered
  Carleton. But worst of all, he remembered Carleton&rsquo;s twenty.</p>
  <p>There were two courses open to him. He could sneak out of town with all
  possible modesty and dispatch, or he could face the music. Not that Shanley
  debated the question&mdash;the occasion had never yet arisen when he hadn&rsquo;t
  faced the music&mdash;he simply experienced the temptation to &ldquo;crawl,&rdquo; that
  was all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; he ruminated ruefully, &ldquo;as though I
  was up against it for fair. Just my luck, just my blasted luck, always the
  same kind of luck, that&rsquo;s what. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t my fault neither,
  is it? I ain&rsquo;t responsible for that darned wreck&mdash;if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
  for that I wouldn&rsquo;t be here. An&rsquo; Kelly, Spider he said his name
  was, if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for him I wouldn&rsquo;t be here neither. What
  the blazes did <i>I</i> have to do with it? I always have to stand for the
  other cuss. That&rsquo;s me every time, I guess. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s logic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was. Neither was there any flaw in it as at first sight might appear,
  for the last test of logic is its power of conviction. Shanley, from being
  a man with some reasonable cause for qualms of conscience, became, in his
  own mind, one deeply sinned against, one injured and crushed down by the
  load of others he was forced to bear.</p>
  <p>He explained this to Carleton while the thought of his burning wrongs was
  still at white heat, and before the super had a chance to get in a word.
  He began as he opened the office door, continued as he crossed the room,
  and finished as he stood before the super&rsquo;s desk.</p>
  <p>The scowl that had settled on Carleton&rsquo;s face, as he looked up at
  the other&rsquo;s entrance, gradually gave way to a hint of humor lurking
  around the corners of his mouth, and he leaned back in his chair and listened
  with an exaggerated air of profound attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so, just so,&rdquo; said he, when Shanley finally came to a
  breathless halt. &ldquo;Now perhaps you will allow <i>me</i> to say a word.
  It may not have occurred to you that I sent for you in order that <i>I</i> might
  do the talking&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This really seemed to require no answer, so Shanley made none.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; went on Carleton, &ldquo;you came to me for a
  job, and I gave you one, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Shanley, licking his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Carleton mildly. &ldquo;I hired you then. I
  fire you now. Pretty quick work, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the doctor,&rdquo; said Shanley evenly enough. He had,
  for all his logic, expected no more nor less&mdash;he was too firm a believer
  in his own particular and exclusive brand of luck. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
  doctor,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a matter of twenty bucks&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; interrupted Carleton; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
  glad <i>you</i> mentioned it. I&rsquo;ll be honest enough to admit that I
  hardly expected you would. A man who acts as you&rsquo;ve acted doesn&rsquo;t
  generally&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; said Shanley stubbornly.</p>
  <p>Carleton reached for his pipe, and struck a match, surveying Shanley the
  while with a gaze that was half perplexed, half quizzical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer card,&rdquo; he remarked at last. &ldquo;Why
  don&rsquo;t you cut out the booze?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my fault, I tell you,&rdquo; persisted Shanley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  a pretty good hand with your fists, what?&rdquo; said Carleton irrelevantly. &ldquo;Kelly&rsquo;s
  no slouch himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley blinked. It appeared that the super was as intimately posted on
  the events of the preceding evening as he was himself. The remark suggested
  an inspection of the fists in question. They were grimy and dirty, and most
  of the knuckles were barked; closed, they resembled a pair of miniature battering-rams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty good,&rdquo; he admitted modestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! About that twenty. You intend to pay it back, don&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a thief, whatever else I am,&rdquo; snapped Shanley. &ldquo;Of
  course, I&rsquo;ll pay it back. You needn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; insisted Carleton coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I get a job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one,&rdquo; said Carleton&mdash;&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; Carleton
  the boys called him, the squarest man that ever held down a division. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  give you one where your fists will be kept out of mischief, and where you
  can&rsquo;t hit the high joints quite as hard as you did last night. But
  I want you to understand this, Shanley, and understand it good and plenty
  and once for all, it&rsquo;s your last chance. You made a fool of yourself
  last night, but you acted like a man yesterday&mdash;that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
  getting a new deal. You&rsquo;re going up to Glacier Ca&ntilde;on with McCann on
  the construction work. You won&rsquo;t find it anyways luxurious, and maybe
  you&rsquo;ll like McCann and maybe you won&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;s been
  squealing for a white man to live with. You can help him boss Italians at
  one seventy-five a day, and you can go up on Twenty-nine this morning, that&rsquo;ll
  take care of your transportation. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley couldn&rsquo;t say anything. He looked at the super and blinked;
  then he looked at his fists speculatively&mdash;and blinked.</p>
  <p>Carleton was scribbling on a piece of paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo; he said, looking up and handing over
  the paper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an order on Dinkelman, only get some one
  else to show you the way this time, and take the other side of the street
  going up. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Carleton,&rdquo; Shanley blurted out, &ldquo;if ever I get full
  again, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; said Carleton grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fire you
  so hard and fast you&rsquo;ll be out of breath for a month. Don&rsquo;t make
  any mistake about that. No man gets more than two chances with me. The next
  time you get drunk will finish your railroad career for keeps, I promise
  you that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Shanley humbly; and then, after a moment&rsquo;s
  nervous hesitation: &ldquo;About Kelly, Mr. Carleton. I don&rsquo;t want
  to get him in bad on this. You see, it was this way. He left early&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  what started the fight. I called him a&mdash;a&mdash;quitter&mdash;or something
  like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes; or something like that,&rdquo; repeated Carleton
  dryly. &ldquo;So I believe. I&rsquo;ve had a talk with Kelly. You needn&rsquo;t
  let the incomprehensible workings of that conscience of yours prick you any
  on his account. Kelly knows when to stop. His record is O. K. in this office.
  Kelly doesn&rsquo;t get drunk. If he did, he&rsquo;d be fired just as fast
  as you will be if it ever happens again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m never fired for anything but that,&rdquo; exclaimed
  Shanley in a burst of fervent emotion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job for life.
  I&rsquo;ll prove it to you, Mr. Carleton. I&rsquo;m going to make good. You
  see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Carleton. &ldquo;I hope you will. That&rsquo;s
  all, Shanley. I&rsquo;ll let McCann know you&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley&rsquo;s second exit from the super&rsquo;s presence was different
  from the first. He walked out with a firm tread and squared shoulders. He
  was rejuvenated and buoyant. He was on his mettle&mdash;quite another matter,
  entirely another matter, and distinctly apart from the paltry consideration
  of a mere job. He had told Carleton that he would make good. Well, he would&mdash;and
  he did. Carleton himself said so, and Carleton wasn&rsquo;t in the habit
  of making many breaks when it came to sizing up a man&mdash;not many. He
  did sometimes, but not often.</p>
  <p>Shanley did not take the other side of the street on the way to Dinkelman&rsquo;s&mdash;by
  no means. He deliberately passed as close to the Blazing Star saloon as he
  could, passed with contemptuous disregard, passed boastfully in the knowledge
  of his own strength. A sixteen-hundred class engine with her four pairs of
  forty-six-inch drivers can pull countless cars up a mountain grade steep
  enough to make one dizzy, but Shanley would have backed himself to win against
  her in a tug of war over the scant few inches that separated him from MacGuire&rsquo;s
  dispensary as he brushed by. None of MacGuire&rsquo;s for him. Not at all.
  Red-headed, freckle-faced, barked-knuckled, bulwarked-and-armor-cased-against-temptation
  Shanley dealt that morning with Mr. Dinkelman, purveyor of bargains in men&rsquo;s
  apparel.</p>
  <p>The dealings were liberal&mdash;on the part of both men. On Shanley&rsquo;s
  part because he needed much; on Mr. Dinkelman&rsquo;s part because it was
  Mr. Dinkelman&rsquo;s business, and his nature, to sell much&mdash;if he
  could&mdash;safely. This was eminently safe. Carleton&rsquo;s name in the
  mountains stood higher than guaranteed, gilt-edged gold bonds any time.</p>
  <p>The business finally concluded, Shanley boarded Twenty-nine, local freight,
  west, and in due time, well on in the afternoon, righteously sober, straight
  as a string, cleaned, groomed, and resplendent in a new suit, swung off from
  the caboose at Glacier Ca&ntilde;on as the train considerately slackened speed enough
  to give him a fighting chance for life and limb.</p>
  <p>He landed safely, however, in the midst of a jabbering Italian labor gang,
  who received his sudden advent with patience and some awe. A short, squintfaced
  man greeted him with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me name&rsquo;s McCann,&rdquo; said he of the squint face. &ldquo;This
  is Glacier Ca&ntilde;on, fwhat yez see av ut. Them&rsquo;s the Eyetalians. Yon&rsquo;s
  fwhere I roost an&rsquo; by the same token, fwhere yez&rsquo;ll roost, too,
  from now on. Above is the shack av the men. Are yez plased wid yer introduction? &rsquo;Tis
  wan hell av a hole ye&rsquo;ve come to. Shanley&rsquo;s the name, eh? A good
  wan, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m proud to make the acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley blinked as he stretched out his hand and made friends with his superior,
  and blinked again as he looked first one way and then another in an effort
  to follow and absorb the other&rsquo;s graphic description of the surroundings.</p>
  <p>The road foreman&rsquo;s summary was beyond dispute. Glacier Ca&ntilde;on was as
  wild a piece of track as the Hill Division boasted, which was going some.
  The right of way hugged the bald gray rock of the mountains that rose up
  at one side in a sheer sweep, and the trains crawled along for all the world
  like huge flies at the base of a wall. On the other side was the Glacier
  River with its treacherous sandy bed that had been the subject of more reports
  and engineers&rsquo; gray hairs than all the rest of the system put together.
  The construction camp lay just to the east of the Ca&ntilde;on, and at the foot
  of a long, stiff, two-mile, four-per-cent grade. That was the reason the
  camp was there&mdash;that grade.</p>
  <p>Locking the stable door when the horse is gone is a procedure that is very
  old. It did not originate with the directors of the Transcontinental&mdash;they
  never claimed it did. But their fixed policy, if properly presented before
  a court of arbitration, would have gone a long way toward establishing a
  clear title to it. If they had built a switchback at the foot of the grade
  in the first place, Extra Number Eighty-three, when she lost control of herself
  near the bottom coming down, would have demonstrated just as clearly the
  necessity for one being there as she demonstrated most forcibly what would
  happen when there wasn&rsquo;t. All of which is by way of saying that rock
  or no rock, expense or no expense, the door was now to be locked, and McCann
  and his men were there to lock it.</p>
  <p>McCann explained this to Shanley as he walked him around, up the track to
  the men&rsquo;s shanties, over the work, and back again down the track to
  inspect the interior of the dwelling they were to share in common&mdash;a
  relic of deceased Extra Number Eighty-three in the shape of a truckless box-car
  with dinted and bulging sides&mdash;dinted one side and bulged the other,
  that is.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Shanley, &ldquo;I dunno what a switchback is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who expected it av ye?&rdquo; inquired McCann. &ldquo;An&rsquo; fwhat
  difference does ut make? Carleton sint word ye were green. Ye&rsquo;ve no
  need to know. So&rsquo;s ye can do as yez are told an&rsquo; make them geesers
  do as they are told, <i>an&rsquo;</i> can play forty-foive at night&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  the point, the main point wid me, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s me yez av to get along
  wid&mdash;&rsquo;twill be all right. Since Meegan, him that was helpin&rsquo; me,
  tuk sick a week back, I&rsquo;ve been alone. Begad, playin&rsquo; solytare
  is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can play forty-five,&rdquo; said Shanley.</p>
  <p>McCann&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The powers be praised!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll enlighten
  ye, then, on the matter av switchbacks, me son, so as ye&rsquo;ll have an
  intilligent conception av the work. A switchback is a bit av a spur track
  that sticks out loike the quills av a porkypine at intervuls on a bad grade
  such as the wan forninst ye. &rsquo;Tis run off the main line, d&rsquo;ye
  mind, an&rsquo; up contrariwise to the dip av the grade. Whin a train comin&rsquo; down
  gets beyond control an&rsquo; so expresses herself by means av her whistle,
  she&rsquo;s switched off an&rsquo; given a chance to run uphill by way av
  variety until she stops. An&rsquo; the same holds true if she breaks loose
  goin&rsquo; up. Is ut clear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Shanley. &ldquo;When do I begin work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the mornin.&rsquo; &rsquo;Tis near six now, an&rsquo; the bhoys&rsquo;ll
  be quittin&rsquo; for the night. Forty-foive is a grand game. We&rsquo;ll
  play ut to-night to our better acquaintance. I contind &rsquo;tis the national
  game av the ould sod.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether McCann&rsquo;s contention is borne out by fact, or by the even more
  weighty consideration of public opinion, is of little importance. Shanley
  played forty-five with McCann that night and for many nights thereafter.
  He lost a figure or two off the pay check that was to come, but he won the
  golden opinion of the little road boss, which ethically, and in this case
  practically, was of far greater value.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bright jool av a lad,&rdquo; wrote McCann across the
  foot of a weekly report.</p>
  <p>And Carleton, seeing it, was much gratified, for Carleton wasn&rsquo;t in
  the habit of making many breaks when it came to sizing up a man&mdash;not
  many. He did sometimes, but not often. Shanley was making good. Carleton
  was much gratified.</p>
  <p>Of the three weeks that followed Shanley&rsquo;s advent to Glacier Ca&ntilde;on,
  this story has little to do in a detailed way; but, as a whole, those three
  weeks are pointed, eloquent, and important&mdash;very important.</p>
  <p>Italian laborers have many failings, but likewise they have many virtues.
  They are simple, demonstrative, and their capacity for adoration&mdash;of
  both men and things&mdash;is very great.</p>
  <p>From Jacko, the water boy, to Pietro Maraschino, the padrone, they adored
  Shanley, and enthroned him as an idol in their hearts, for the very simple
  reason that Shanley, not being a professional slave-driver by trade, established
  new and heretofore undreamed-of relations with them. Shanley was very green,
  very ignorant, very inexperienced&mdash;he treated them like human beings.
  That was the long and short of it. Shanley became popular beyond the popularity
  of any man, before or since, who was ever called upon to handle the &ldquo;foreign
  element&rdquo; on the Hill Division.</p>
  <p>And the work progressed. Day by day the cut bored deeper into the stubborn
  mountain-side; day by day the Glacier River gurgled peacefully along over
  its treacherous sandy bed, one of the prettiest scenic effects on the system,
  so pretty that the company used it in the magazines; day by day regulars
  and extras, freights and passengers, east and west, snorted up and down the
  grade, the only visitations from the outside world; night after night Shanley
  played forty-five with McCann in the smoky, truckless box-car.</p>
  <p>Also the camp was dry, very dry, dryer than a sanatorium&mdash;that is,
  than <i>some</i> sanatoriums. Carleton had been quite right. There was no
  opportunity for Shanley to hit the high joints quite as hard as he had that
  night in Big Cloud&mdash;there was no opportunity for him to hit the high
  joints <i>at all</i>. Shanley had not seen a bottle for three weeks. Therefore
  Shanley felt virtuous, which was proper.</p>
  <p>Some events follow others as the natural, logical outcome and conclusion
  of preceding ones; others, again, are apparently irrelevant, and the connection
  is not to be explained either by logic, conclusion, or otherwise. Rain, McCann&rsquo;s
  departure for Big Cloud, and Pietro Maraschino&rsquo;s birthday are an example
  of this.</p>
  <p>When it settles down for a storm in the mountains, it is, if the elements
  are really in earnest, torrential, and prolonged, and has the effect of tying
  up construction work tighter than a supreme court injunction could come anywhere
  near doing it.</p>
  <p>McCann had business in Big Cloud, whether personal or pertaining to the
  company is of no consequence, and the day the storm set in&mdash;the morning
  having demonstrated that its classification was not to be considered as transient&mdash;he
  seized the opportunity to flag the afternoon freight eastbound. This was
  natural and logical, and an opportunity not to be neglected.</p>
  <p>That this day, however, should be the anniversary of the day the padrone&rsquo;s
  mother of blessed memory had given birth to Pietro Maraschino in sunny Naples
  fifty-three years before is, though apparently irrelevant, far from being
  so; and since its peculiar and coincident happening cannot be laid at the
  door of either logical, natural, scientific, or philosophical conclusions,
  and since it demands an explanation of some sort, it must, perforce, be attributed
  to the metaphysical&mdash;which is a name given to all things about which
  nobody knows anything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yez are in charge,&rdquo; said McCann grandiloquently, waving his
  hand to Shanley as he swung into the caboose. &ldquo;Yez are in charge av
  the work, me son. See to ut. I trust ye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the work at the moment was entirely at a standstill and bid fair to remain
  so until McCann&rsquo;s return on the morrow, this was very good of McCann.
  But all men like words of appreciation, most of them whether they deserve
  them or not, so Shanley went back into the box-car out of the rain to ponder
  over the tribute McCann had paid him, and to ponder, too, over the new responsibility
  that had fallen to his lot.</p>
  <p>He did not ponder very long; indeed, the freight that was transporting McCann
  could hardly have been out of sight over the summit of the grade, when a
  knock at the door was followed by the entrance of the dripping figure of
  the padrone.</p>
  <p>Shanley looked up anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Pietro,&rdquo; he said nervously, for the weather wasn&rsquo;t
  the kind that would bring a man out for nothing, and he was keenly alive
  to that new responsibility. &ldquo;Hello, Pietro,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Anything
  wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pietro grinned amiably, shook his head, unbuttoned his coat, and held out&mdash;a
  bottle.</p>
  <p>Shanley stared in amazement, and then began to blink furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chianti,&rdquo; said Pietro, grinning harder than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Key-aunty.&rdquo; Shanley screwed up his face. &ldquo;What the devil
  is key-aunty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ver&rsquo; good wine from Italia,&rdquo; said the beaming padrone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, is it? Well, it&rsquo;s against the rules,&rdquo; asserted
  Shanley with conviction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules. McCann&rsquo;u&rsquo;d
  skin you alive. He would. Where&rsquo;d you get it? What&rsquo;s up, eh?
  It&rsquo;s against the rules. I&rsquo;m in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pietro explained. It was his birthday. It was very bad weather. For the
  rest of the afternoon there would be no work. They would celebrate the birthday,
  Meester McCann had taken the train. As for the wine&mdash;Pietro shrugged
  his shoulders&mdash;his people adored wine. Unless they were very poor his
  people would have a little wine in their packs, perhaps. He was not quite
  sure where they had got it, but it was very thoughtful of them to remember
  his birthday. Each had presented him with a little wine. This bottle was
  an expression of their very great good estime of Meester Shanley. Perhaps,
  later, Meester Shanley would come himself to the shack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules,&rdquo; blinked Shanley. &ldquo;McCann &lsquo;u&rsquo;d
  skin you alive. Maybe I&rsquo;ll drop in by and by. You can leave the bottle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pietro bobbed, grinned delightedly, handed over the bottle, and backed out
  into the storm.</p>
  <p>Shanley, still blinking, placed the bottle on the table, and gazed at it
  thoughtfully for a few minutes&mdash;and his thoughts were of Carleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;twere whisky,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have no
  part of it, not a drop, not even a smell. I would not. I would not touch
  it. But as it is&mdash;&rdquo; Shanley uncorked the bottle.</p>
  <p>Not at all. One does <i>not</i> get drunk on a bottle of Chianti wine. A
  single bottle of Chianti wine is very little. That is the trouble&mdash;it
  is <i>very</i> little. After three weeks of abstinence it is very little
  indeed&mdash;so little that it is positively tantalizing.</p>
  <p>The afternoon waned rapidly&mdash;and so did the Chianti. Outside, the storm
  instead of abating grew worse&mdash;the thunder racketing through the mountains,
  the lightning cutting jagged streaks in the black sky, the rain coming down
  in sheets that set the culverts and sluiceways running full. It was settling
  down for a bad night in the mountains, which, in the Rockies, is not a thing
  to be ignored. &ldquo;&rsquo;tis no wonder McCann found it lonely,&rdquo; muttered
  Shanley, as he squeezed the last drop from the bottle. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
  very lonely, indeed&rdquo;&mdash;he held the bottle upside down to make sure
  that it was thoroughly drained&mdash;&ldquo;most uncommon lonely. It is that.
  Maybe those Eyetalians &rsquo;ll be thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m stuck up, perhaps&mdash;which
  I am not. It&rsquo;s a queer name the stuff has, though it&rsquo;s against
  the rules, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t get my tongue around it, but I&rsquo;ve
  tasted worse. For the sake of courtesy I&rsquo;ll look in on the birthday
  party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He incased himself in a pair of McCann&rsquo;s rubber boots, put on McCann&rsquo;s
  rubber coat, and started out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; to think,&rdquo; said he, as he sloshed and buffeted his
  way up the two hundred yards of track to the construction shanties, &ldquo;to
  think that Pietro came out in cruel bad weather like this all for to present
  his compliments an&rsquo; ask me over! &rsquo;Twould be ungracious to refuse
  the invitation; besides my presence will keep them in due bounds an&rsquo; restraint.
  I&rsquo;ve heard that Eyetalians, being foreigners, do not practice restraint&mdash;but,
  being foreigners, &rsquo;tis not to be held against them. I&rsquo;m in charge,
  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They greeted him in the largest of the three bunk-houses. They greeted him
  heartily, sincerely, uproariously, and with fervor. They were unfeignedly
  glad to see him, and if he had not been by nature a modest man he would have
  understood that his popularity was above the popularity ever before accorded
  to a boss. Likewise, their hospitality was without stint. If there was any
  shortage of stock&mdash;which is a matter decidedly open to question&mdash;they
  denied themselves that Shanley might not feel the pinch. Shanley was lifted
  from the mere plane of man&mdash;he became a king.</p>
  <p>A little Chianti is a little; much Chianti is to be reckoned with and on
  no account to be despised. Shanley not only became a king, he became regally,
  imperially, royally, and majestically drunk. Also there came at last an end
  to the Chianti, at which stage of the proceedings Shanley, with extravagant
  dignity and appropriate words&mdash;an exhortation on restraint&mdash;waddled
  to the door to take his departure.</p>
  <p>It was very dark outside, very dark, except when an intermittent flash of
  lightning made momentary daylight. Pietro Maraschino offered Shanley one
  of the many lanterns that, in honor of the festive occasion, they had commandeered,
  without regard to color, from the tool boxes, and had strung around the shack.
  Further, he offered to see Shanley on his way.</p>
  <p>The offer of assistance touched Shanley&mdash;it touched him wrong. It implied
  a more or less acute condition of disability, which he repudiated with a
  hurt expression on his face and forceful words on his tongue. He refused
  it; and being aggrieved, refused also the lantern Pietro held out to him.
  He chose one for himself instead&mdash;the one nearest to his hand. That
  this was red made no difference. Blue, white, red, green, or purple, it was
  all one to Shanley. His fuddled brain did not differentiate. A light was
  a light, that was all there was to that.</p>
  <p>The short distance from the shanty door to the right of way Shanley negotiated
  with finesse and aplomb, and then he started down the track. This, however,
  was another matter.</p>
  <p>Railroad ties, at best, do not make the smoothest walking in the world,
  and to accomplish the feat under some conditions is decidedly worthy of note.
  Shanley&rsquo;s performance beggars the English language&mdash;there is no
  metaphor. For every ten feet he moved forward he covered twenty in laterals,
  and, considering that the laterals were limited to the paltry four, feet,
  eight and one-half inches that made the gauge of the rails, the feat was
  incontestably more than worthy of mere note&mdash;it was something to wonder
  at. He clung grimly to the lantern, with the result that the gyrations of
  that little red light in the darkness would have put to shame an expert&rsquo;s
  exhibition with a luminous dumb-bell. The while Shanley spoke earnestly to
  himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queshun is am I drunk&mdash;thash&rsquo;s the queshun. If I&rsquo;m
  drunk&mdash;lose my job. Thash what Carleton said&mdash;lose my job. If I&rsquo;m
  not drunk&mdash;s&rsquo;all right. Wish I knew wesser I&rsquo;m drunk or
  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He relapsed into silent communion and debate. This lasted for a very long
  period, during which, marvelous to relate, he had not only reached a point
  opposite his box-car domicile, but, being oblivious of that fact, had kept
  on along the track. Progress, however, was becoming more and more difficult.
  Shanley was assuming a position that might be likened somewhat to the letter
  C, owing to the fact that the force of gravity seemed to be exerting an undue
  influence on his head. Shanley was coming to earth.</p>
  <p>As a result of his communion with himself he began to talk again, and his
  words suggested that he had suspicions of the truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; my luck,&rdquo; said he bitterly. &ldquo;Jus&rsquo; my
  luck. Allus same kind of luck. What&rsquo;d I have to do wis Peto Mara&mdash;Mars&mdash;Marscheeno&rsquo;s
  birthday? Nothing. Nothing  &rsquo;tall. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my fault. Jus&rsquo; my
  luck. Jus&rsquo; my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shanley came to earth. Also his head came into contact with the unyielding
  steel of the left-hand rail, and as a result he sprawled inertly full across
  the right of way, not ten yards west of where the Glacier River swings in
  to crowd the track close up against the mountain base.</p>
  <p>Providence sometimes looks after those who are unable to look after themselves.
  By the law of probabilities the lantern should have met disaster quick and
  absolute; but, instead, when it fell from Shanley&rsquo;s hand, it landed
  right side up just outside the rail between two ties, and, apart from a momentary
  and hesitant flicker incident to the jolt, burned on serenely. And it was
  still burning when, five minutes later, above the swish of leaping waters
  from the Glacier River now a chattering, angry stream with swollen banks,
  above the moan of the wind and the roll of the thunder through the mountains,
  above the pelting splash of the steady rain, came the hoarse scream of Number
  One&rsquo;s whistle on the grade.</p>
  <p>Sanderson, in the cab, caught the red against him on the right of way ahead,
  and whistled insistently for the track. This having no effect, he grunted,
  latched in the throttle, and applied the &ldquo;air.&rdquo; The ray of the
  headlight crept along between the rails, hovered over a black object beside
  the lantern, passed on again and held, not on the glistening rain-wet rails&mdash;<i>they</i> had
  disappeared&mdash;but on a crumbling road-bed and a dark blotch of waters,
  as with a final screech from the grinding brake-shoes Number One came to
  a standstill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy MacCheesar!&rdquo; exclaimed Sanderson, as he swung from the
  cab.</p>
  <p>He made his way along past the drivers to where the pilot&rsquo;s nose was
  inquisitively poked against the lantern, picked up the lantern, and bent
  over Shanley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy MacCheesar!&rdquo; he exclaimed again, straightening up after
  a moment&rsquo;s examination. &ldquo;Holy MacCheesar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Sandy?&rdquo; snapped a voice behind him, the
  voice of Kelly, Spider Kelly, the conductor, who had hurried forward to investigate
  the unscheduled stop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; replied Sanderson. &ldquo;Looks like the Glacier
  was up to her old tricks. There&rsquo;s a washout ahead, and a bad one, I
  guess. But the meaning of this here is one beyond me. The fellow was curled
  up on the track just as you see him with the light burning alongside, that&rsquo;s
  what saved us, but he&rsquo;s as drunk as a lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Kelly bent over the prostrate form, others of the train crew appeared
  on the scene. One glance he gave at Shanley&rsquo;s never-under-any-circumstances-to-be-for-gotten
  homely countenance, and hastily ordered the men to go forward and investigate
  the washout ahead. Then he turned to the engineer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man is not drunk, Sandy,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is gloriously and magnificently drunk, Kelly,&rdquo; replied the
  engineer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would he be doing here, then? He is not drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping it off. He is disgracefully drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can ye not see the bash on his head where he must have stumbled in
  the dark trying to save the train and struck against the rail? He is not
  drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can ye not smell?&rdquo; retorted Sanderson. &ldquo;He is dead drunk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have fought with him and he licked me. He is a man and a friend
  of mine&rdquo;&mdash;Kelly shoved his lantern into Sanderson&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;<i>He
  is not drunk</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is <i>not</i> drunk,&rdquo; said Sanderson. &ldquo;He is a hero.
  What will we do with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll carry him, you and me, over to the construction shanty,
  it&rsquo;s only a few yards, and put him in his bunk. He works here, you
  know. McCann&rsquo;s in Big Cloud, for I saw him there. After that we&rsquo;ll
  run back to the Bend for orders and make our report.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry, then,&rdquo; said the engineer. &ldquo;Take his legs. What
  are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking of Carleton,&rdquo; said Kelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton? What&rsquo;s
  Carleton got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later when we get to the Bend. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Sanderson, as they staggered with their burden
  over to the box-car shack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea that bash on the head
  is more dirt than hurt. He&rsquo;s making a speech, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; my luck,&rdquo; mumbled the reviving Shanley dolefully. &ldquo;Jus&rsquo; my
  luck. Alius same kind of luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;Set him down and slide back
  the door. That&rsquo;s right. In with him now. We haven&rsquo;t got time
  to make him very comfortable, but I guess he&rsquo;ll do. I can fix him up
  better at the Bend than I can here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the Bend? What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; demanded Sanderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; replied Kelly, with a grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Sanderson saw. So did Carleton&mdash;in a way. Kelly&rsquo;s report,
  when they got to the Bend, was a work of art. He disposed of the nature and
  extent of the washout in ten brief, well-chosen words, but the operator got
  a cramp before Kelly was through covering Shanley with glory. The passengers,
  packed in the little waiting-room clamoring for details, yelled deliriously
  as he read the message aloud&mdash;and promptly took up a collection, a very
  generous collection, because all collections are generous at psychological
  moments&mdash;that is to say, if not delayed too long to allow a recovery
  from hysteria.</p>
  <p>At Big Cloud, the dispatcher, because the washout was a serious matter that
  not only threatened to tie up traffic, but was tying it up, sent a hurry
  call to Carleton&rsquo;s house that brought the super on the run to the office.
  By this time the collection had been counted, and the total wired in, as
  an additional detail&mdash;one hundred and forty dollars and thirty-three
  cents. The odd change being a contribution from a Swede in the colonist coach
  who could not speak English, and who paid because a man in uniform, a brakeman
  acting as canvasser, made the request. A Swede has a great respect for a
  uniform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Carleton, when he had read it all. &ldquo;I
  know a man when I see one. Tell Shanley to report here. I guess we can find
  something better for him to do than bossing laborers. What? Yes, send the
  letter up on the construction train. One hundred and forty, thirty-three,
  h&rsquo;m? Tell him that, too. He&rsquo;ll feel good when he sees it in the
  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Shanley did not feel good when he saw it in the morning, for he was
  nursing a very bad headache and a stomach that had a tendency to squeamishness.
  The letter was lying on the floor, where some one had considerately chucked
  it in without disturbing him. His eyes fell on it as he struggled out of
  his bunk. He picked it up, opened it, read it&mdash;and blinked. His face
  set with a very blank and bewildered expression. He read it again, and again
  once more. Then he went to the door and looked out.</p>
  <p>A construction train was on the line a little below him, and a gang of men,
  not his nor Pietro Maraschino&rsquo;s men, were busily at work. As he gazed,
  his face puckered. The problem that had so obsessed him on his return journey
  from the birthday celebration the night before was a problem no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>was</i> drunk,&rdquo; said he, with conviction. &ldquo;I <i>must</i> have
  been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went back to the letter and studied it again, scratching his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;has happened. What it is,
  I dunno. I was drunk, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not fired. I was drunk, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  promoted. I was drunk, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m paid well for it, very well. I
  was drunk&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which was exactly the advice Kelly took pains to give him half an hour later,
  when Number One crawled down to the Ca&ntilde;on and halted for a few minutes opposite
  the dismantled box-car, while the construction train put the last few touches
  to its work.</p>

      <a name="TheBuilder"></a>The Builder</b></h2>
  <p>There are two sides to every story&mdash;which is a proverb so old that
  it is in the running with Father Time himself. It is repeated here because
  there must be <i>some</i> truth in it&mdash;anything that can stand the wear
  and tear of the ages, and the cynics, and the wise old philosophical owls
  without getting any knock-out dints punched in its vital spots must have
  some sort of merit fundamentally, what? Anyway, the company had their side,
  and the men&rsquo;s version differed&mdash;of course. Maybe each, in a way,
  was more or less right, and, equally, in a way, more or less wrong. Maybe,
  too, both sides lost their tempers and got their crown-sheets burned out
  before the arbitration pow-wow had a chance to get the line clear and give
  anybody rights, schedule or otherwise. However, be that as it may, whoever
  was right or whoever was wrong, one or the other, or both, it is the strike,
  not the ethics of it, that has to do with&mdash;but just a moment, we&rsquo;re
  over-running our holding orders.</p>
  <p>From the time the last rail was spiked home and bridging the Rockies was
  a reality, not a dream&mdash;from then to the present day, there isn&rsquo;t
  any very much better way of describing the Hill Division than to call it
  rough and ready. Coming right down to cases, the history of that piece of
  track, the history of the men who gave the last that was in them to make
  it, and the history of those who have operated it since isn&rsquo;t far from
  being a pretty typical and comprehensive example of the pulsing, dominating,
  dogged, go-forward spirit of a continent whose strides and progress are the
  marvel of the world; and, withal, it is an example so compact and concrete
  that through it one may see and view the larger picture in all its angles
  and in all its shades. Heroism and fame and death and failure&mdash;it has
  known them all&mdash;but ever, and above all else, it has known the indomitable
  patience, the indomitable perseverance, the indomitable determination against
  which no times, nor conditions, nor manners, nor customs, nor obstacles can
  stand&mdash;the spirit of the New Race and the Great New Land, the essence
  and the germ of it.</p>
  <p>Building a road through the Rockies and tapping the Sierras to give zest
  to the finish wasn&rsquo;t an infant&rsquo;s performance; and operating it,
  single-track, on crazy-wild cuts and fills and tangents and curves and tunnels
  and trestles with nature to battle and fight against, isn&rsquo;t any infant&rsquo;s
  performance, either. The Hill Division was rough and ready. It always was,
  and it is now&mdash;just naturally so. And Big Cloud, the divisional point,
  snuggling amongst the buttes in the eastern foothills, is even more so. It
  boasts about every nationality classified in certain erudite editions of
  small books with big names, and, to top that, has an extra anomaly or two
  left over and up its sleeve for good measure; but, mostly, it is, or rather
  was&mdash;it has changed some with the years&mdash;composed of Indians, bad
  Americans, a scattering of Chinese, and an indescribable medley of humans
  from the four quarters of Europe, the Cockney, the Polack, the Swede, the
  Russian and the Italian&mdash;laborers on the construction gangs. Big Cloud
  was a little more than rough and ready&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what
  you&rsquo;d call a health resort for finnicky nerves.</p>
  <p>So, take it by and large, the Hill Division, from one end to the other,
  wasn&rsquo;t the quietest or most peaceful locality on the map even before
  the trouble came. After that&mdash;well, mention the Big Strike to any of
  the old-timers and they&rsquo;ll talk fast enough and hard enough and say
  enough in a minute to set you wondering if the biographers hadn&rsquo;t got
  mixed on dates and if Dante hadn&rsquo;t got his material for that little
  hair-stiffener of his no further away than the Rockies, and no longer back
  than a few years ago. But no matter&mdash;</p>
  <p>The story opens on the strike&mdash;<i>not</i> the ethics of it. There&rsquo;s
  some hard feeling yet&mdash;too much of it to take sides one way or the other.
  But then, apart from that, this is not the story of a strike, it is the story
  of men&mdash;a story that the boys tell at night in the darkened roundhouses
  in the shadow of the big ten-wheelers on the pits, while the steam purrs
  softly at the gauges and sometimes a pop-valve lifts with a catchy sob. They
  tell it, too, across the tracks at headquarters, or on the road and in construction
  camps; but they tell it better, somehow, in the roundhouse, though it is
  not an engineer&rsquo;s tale&mdash;and Clarihue, the night turner, tells
  it best of all. Set forth as it is here it takes no rank with him,&mdash;but
  all are not so fortunate as to have listened while Clarihue talked.</p>
  <p>Just one word more to make sure that the red isn&rsquo;t against us anywhere
  and we&rsquo;ll get to Keating and Spirlaw&mdash;just a word to say that
  Carleton, &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; Carleton, was superintendent then, and Regan
  was master mechanic, Harvey was division engineer, Spence was chief dispatcher,
  and Riley was trainmaster. Pretty good men that little group, pretty good
  railroaders&mdash;there have never been better. Some of them are bigger now
  in the world&rsquo;s eyes, heads of systems instead of departments&mdash;and
  some of them will never railroad any more. However&mdash;</p>
  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t forgotten Shanley you will recall the Glacier Ca&ntilde;on,
  and, most of all, you will recall the Glacier River with its treacherous
  sandy bed that snuggled close to the right of way and forced the track hard
  against the rocky walls of the mountain&rsquo;s base. The havoc the Glacier
  played with the operating department on the night of Shanley&rsquo;s memorable
  heroism was not the first time it had misbehaved itself, nor was it the last&mdash;that
  was the trouble. It washed out the road-bed with such consistent persistency,
  on so little provocation, and did it so effectually as to stir at last to
  resentment even the torpid blood of the directors down East. So they voted
  the sum, though it hurt, and solaced themselves with the thought that after
  all it was economy&mdash;which was true.</p>
  <p>There was only one thing to do against that overhospitable and affectionate
  little stream, and that was to get away from it; but, before proceeding to
  do so&mdash;in order to get elbow room to work so that the flyers and the
  fast mails and the traffic generally wouldn&rsquo;t be hung up every time
  a Polack swung a pick&mdash;they pushed the track out over the chattering
  river on a long, temporary, hybrid trestle of wood and steel. That done,
  the rest was up to Spirlaw&mdash;up to Spirlaw and Keating.</p>
  <p>The plans called for the shaving down of the mountain-side, the barbering,
  mostly, to be done with dynamite, for the beard of the Rockies is not the
  down of a youth. So, when the trestle was finished, Spirlaw with a gang of
  some thirty Polacks moved into construction camp, promptly tore up the old
  track, and set themselves to the task in hand. A little later, Keating joined
  them.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw was a road boss, and the roughest of his kind. Physically he was
  a giant; and which of the three was the hardest, his face, his fist, or his
  tongue, would afford the sporting element a most excellent opportunity to
  indulge in a little book-making with the odds about even all round. His hair
  was a coarse mop of tawny brown that straggled over his eyes; and his eyes
  were all black, every bit of them&mdash;there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any
  pupil at all, which gave them a glint that was harder than a cold chisel.
  Take him summed up, Spirlaw looked a pretty tough proposition, and in some
  ways, most ways perhaps, he was&mdash;he never denied it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the blue blinding blazes, d&rsquo;ye think, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo; he
  would remark, reaching into his hip pocket for his &ldquo;chewing,&rdquo; as
  he swept the other arm comprehensively over the particular crowd of sweating
  foreigners that happened to be under his particular jurisdiction at the time. &ldquo;What
  d&rsquo;ye think! You can&rsquo;t run cuts an&rsquo; fills with an outfit
  like this on soft soap an&rsquo; candy sticks, can you? Well then&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That last &ldquo;h&rsquo;m&rdquo; was more or less conclusive&mdash;very
  few cared to pursue the argument any further. At a safe distance, the Big
  Fellows on the division, as a salve to their consciences when humanitarian
  ideas were in the ascendancy, would bombard Spirlaw with telegrams which
  were forceful in tone and direful in threat&mdash;but that&rsquo;s all it
  ever amounted to. Spirlaw&rsquo;s work report for a day on anything, from
  bridging a ca&ntilde;on to punching a hole in the bitter hard rock of the mountain-side,
  was a report that no one else on the division had ever approached, let alone
  duplicated&mdash;and figures count perhaps just a little bit more in the
  operating department of a railroad than they do anywhere else in the world.
  Spirlaw used the telegrams as spills to light a pipe as hard-looking as himself,
  whose bowl was down at the heels on one side from much scraping, and on such
  occasions it was more than ordinarily unfortunate for the sour-visaged Polack
  who should chance to arouse his ire.</p>
  <p>Some men possess the love of a fight and their natures are tempestuous by
  virtue of their nationality, because some nationalities are addicted that
  way. This may have been the case with Spirlaw&mdash;or it may not. There&rsquo;s
  no saying, for Spirlaw&rsquo;s nationality was a question mark. He never
  delivered himself on the subject, and, certainly, there was no figuring it
  out from the derivation of his name&mdash;<i>that</i> could have been most
  anything, and could have come from most anywhere.</p>
  <p>To say that &ldquo;opposites attract&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t any more original,
  any less gray-bearded, than the words at the head of these pages. Generally,
  that sort of thing is figured in the worn-out, stale, familiarity-breeds-contempt
  realm of platitude, and at its unctuous repetition one comes to turn up his
  nose; but, once in a while, life has a habit of getting in a kink or a twist
  that gives you a jolt and a different side-light, and then, somehow, a thing
  like that rings as fresh and virile as though you had just heard it for the
  first time. As far as any one ever knew, Keating was the only one that ever
  got inside of Spirlaw&rsquo;s shell, the only one that the road boss ever
  showed the slightest symptoms of caring a hang about&mdash;and yet, on the
  surface, between the two there was nothing in common. Where one was polished
  the other was rough; where one was weak the other was strong. Keating was
  small, thin, pale-faced, and he had a cough&mdash;a cough that had sent him
  West in a hurry without waiting for the other year that would have given
  him his engineer&rsquo;s diploma from the college in the East.</p>
  <p>When the boy, he wasn&rsquo;t much more than a boy, dropped off at Big Cloud,
  and Carleton read the letter he brought from one of the big Eastern operators,
  the super raised his eyebrows a little, looked him over and sent him out
  to Spirlaw. Afterwards, he spoke to Regan about him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with him, Tommy; but I had to do something,
  what? Any one with half an eye could tell that he had to be kept out of doors.
  Thought he might be able to help Spirlaw out a little as assistant, h&rsquo;m?
  Guess he&rsquo;ll pick up the work quick enough. He don&rsquo;t look strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe it&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; grinned the master mechanic. &ldquo;He
  won&rsquo;t be able to batter the gang any. One man doing that is enough&mdash;when
  it&rsquo;s Spirlaw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw heard about it before he saw Keating, and he swore fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;m runnin&rsquo; a
  nursery or an outdoor sanatorium? I guess I&rsquo;ve got enough to do without
  lookin&rsquo; after sick kids, I guess I have. Fat lot of help he&rsquo;ll
  be&mdash;help my eye! I don&rsquo;t need no help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But for all that, somehow, from the first minute when Keating got off the
  local freight, that stopped for him at the camp, and shoved out his hand
  to Spirlaw it was different&mdash;after that it was <i>all</i> Keating as
  far as the road boss was concerned.</p>
  <p>Queer the way things go. Keating looked about the last man on earth you
  would expect to find rubbing elbows with an iron-fisted foreman whose tongue
  was rougher than a barbed-wire fence; the last man to hold his own with a
  slave-driven gang of ugly Polacks. He seemed too quiet, too shy, too utterly
  unfit, physically, for that sort of thing. The blood was all out of the boy&mdash;he
  got rid of it faster than he could make it. But his training stood him in
  good stead, and, within his limitations, he took hold like an old hand. That
  was what caught Spirlaw. He did what he was told, and he did what he could&mdash;did
  a little more than he could at times, which would lay him up for a bad two
  or three days of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; Spirlaw scribbled across the bottom of a report
  one day&mdash;a day that was about equally divided between barking his knuckles
  on a Polack&rsquo;s head and feeding cracked ice to Keating in his bunk.
  Cracked ice? No, it wasn&rsquo;t on the regular camp bill of fare&mdash;but
  the company supplied it for all that. Spirlaw, with supreme contempt for
  the dispatchers and their schedules and their train sheets, held up Number
  Twelve and the porter of the Pullman for a goodly share of the commodity
  possessed by that colored gentleman. That&rsquo;s what Spirlaw thought of
  Keating.</p>
  <p>For the first few weeks after he struck the camp Keating didn&rsquo;t have
  very much to say about himself, or anything else for that matter; but after
  he got a little nearer to Spirlaw and the mutual liking grew stronger, he
  began to open up at nights when he and the road boss sat outside the door
  of the construction shanty and watched the sun lose itself behind the mighty
  peaks, creep again with a wondrous golden-tinted glow between a rift in the
  range, and finally sink with ensuing twilight out of sight. Keating could
  talk then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see what you ever took up engineerin&rsquo; for,&rdquo; remarked
  Spirlaw one evening. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the roughest kind of a life
  I know of, an&rsquo; you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; Keating smiled. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m
  not strong enough for it. Why, another year out here in the West and I&rsquo;ll
  be like a horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, you will,&rdquo; agreed Spirlaw, hastily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
  mean just that.&rdquo; Then he sucked his briar hard.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw wasn&rsquo;t much up on therapeutics, he knew more about blasting
  rock, but down in his heart there wasn&rsquo;t much doubt about another year
  in the West for the boy, and another and another, <i>all of them</i>&mdash;only
  they would be over the Great Divide that one only crosses once when it is
  crossed forever. Six months, four, three,&mdash;just months, not years, was
  what he read in Keating&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What I meant,&rdquo; he amended, &ldquo;was
  that you don&rsquo;t have to. From what you&rsquo;ve said, I figur&rsquo; your
  folks back there would be willin&rsquo; to stake you in most any line you
  picked out, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Keating answered, and his face
  lighted up as he leaned over and touched the road boss on the sleeve. &ldquo;But,
  Spirlaw, it&rsquo;s the greatest thing in all the world. Don&rsquo;t you
  see? A man does something. <i>He builds</i>. I&rsquo;m going to be a builder&mdash;a
  builder of bridges and roads and things like that. I want to do something
  some day&mdash;something that will be worth while. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
  going to be an engineer; because, all over the world from the beginning,
  the engineers have led the way and&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve left something
  behind them. I think that&rsquo;s the biggest thing they can say of any man
  when he dies&mdash;that he was a builder, that he left something behind him.
  I&rsquo;d like to have them say that about me. Well, after I put in another
  year out here&mdash;I&rsquo;m a heap better even now than when I came&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  going back to finish my course, and then&mdash;well, you understand what
  I want to do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were lots of talks like that, evening after evening, and they all
  of them ended in the same way&mdash;-</p>
  <p>Spirlaw would knock out his pipe against a stone or his boot heel, and &ldquo;figur&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
  stroll up the camp a bit an&rsquo; make sure all was right for the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A pretty hard man Spirlaw was, but under the rough and the brutal, the horny,
  thick-shelled exterior was another self, a strange side of self that he had
  never known until he had known Keating. It got into him pretty deep and pretty
  hard, the boy and his ambitions; and the irony of it, grim and bitter, deepened
  his pity and roused, too, a sense of fierce, hot resentment against the fate
  that mocked in its pitiless might so defenseless and puny a victim. To himself
  he came to call Keating &ldquo;The Builder,&rdquo; and one day when Harvey
  came down on an inspection trip, he told the division engineer about it&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  how it got around.</p>
  <p>Carleton, when he heard it, didn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;just crammed
  the dottle in his pipe down with his forefinger and stared out at the switches
  in the yards. They were used to seeing the surface of things plowed up and
  the corners turned back in the mountains, there weren&rsquo;t many days went
  by when something that showed the raw didn&rsquo;t happen in one way or another,
  but it never brought callousness or indifference, only, perhaps, a truer
  sense of values.</p>
  <p>They had been blasting in the Ca&ntilde;on for a matter of two months when the
  first signs of trouble began to show themselves, and the beginning was when
  the shop hands at Big Cloud went out&mdash;the boiler-makers and the blacksmiths,
  the painters, the carpenters and the fitters. The construction camp, that
  is Spirlaw, didn&rsquo;t worry very much about this for the very simple reason
  that there didn&rsquo;t appear to be any reason why it, or he, should&mdash;that
  was Regan&rsquo;s hunt. But when the train crews followed suit and stray
  rumors of a fight or two at Big Cloud began to come in, with the likelihood
  of more hard on the heels of the first, it put a different complexion on
  things; for the rioting, what there had been of it, lay, not at the door
  of the railroad boys, but with the town&rsquo;s loafers and hangers-on, these
  and the foreign element&mdash;particularly the foreign element&mdash;the
  brothers and the cousins of the Polacks who were swinging the picks and the
  shovels under the iron hand of Spirlaw, their temporary lord and master&mdash;the
  Polacks, gently ungentle, when amuck, as starved pumas.</p>
  <p>Then the Brotherhood said &ldquo;quit,&rdquo; and the engine crews followed
  the trainmen. Things began to look black, and headquarters began to find
  it pretty hard to move anything. The train schedule past the Ca&ntilde;on was cut
  better than in half, and the faces of the men in the cabs and the cabooses
  were new faces to those in camp&mdash;the faces of the men the company were
  bringing in on hurry calls from wherever they could get them, from the plains
  East or the coast West.</p>
  <p>Every day brought reports of trouble from one end of the line to the other,
  more rioting, more disorder at Big Cloud; and, in an effort to nip as much
  of it in the bud as possible, Carleton issued orders to stop all construction
  work&mdash;all except the work in Glacier Ca&ntilde;on, for there the temporary
  trestle lay uneasy on his mind.</p>
  <p>The day the stop orders went out elsewhere a letter went out to Spirlaw.
  Spirlaw read it and his face set like a thunder cloud. He handed it to Keating.</p>
  <p>Keating read it&mdash;and looked serious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess things aren&rsquo;t any too rosy down there,&rdquo; he commented;
  then slowly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed our men seemed a bit sullen lately.
  They don&rsquo;t care anything much about the strike, it must be a sort of
  sympathetic movement with the rest of their crowd that&rsquo;s running wild
  at Big Cloud&mdash;only I don&rsquo;t just figure how they can know very
  much about what&rsquo;s going on. We don&rsquo;t ourselves, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw smiled grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I caught a Polack
  in the camp last night that didn&rsquo;t belong here&mdash;and I broke his
  head for the second time, see? He used to work for me about a year
  ago&mdash;that&rsquo;s when I broke it the first time. He&rsquo;s one of
  their influential citizens&mdash;name&rsquo;s Kuryla. Sneaked in here to
  stir up trouble&mdash;guess he&rsquo;s sorry for it, I guess he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it,&rdquo; said Keating,
  his eyes opening a little wider in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You was asleep,&rdquo; explained Spirlaw tersely.</p>
  <p>Keating stared curiously at the road boss for a minute, then he glanced
  again at the super&rsquo;s letter which he still held in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton says he is depending on you to put this work through if
  it&rsquo;s a possible thing. You don&rsquo;t really think we&rsquo;ll have
  any serious trouble here though, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw bit deeply into his plug before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, son; I do,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s
  a good many reasons why we will, too. Once start &rsquo;em goin&rsquo; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
  no worse hellions on earth than the breed we&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; next door
  to. Furthermore they don&rsquo;t <i>love</i> me&mdash;they&rsquo;re just
  afraid of me as, by the holy razoo, I mean &rsquo;em to be. Let &rsquo;em
  once get a smell of the upper hand an&rsquo; it would be all day <i>an</i>&rsquo; good-by.
  Let &rsquo;em get goin&rsquo; good at Big Cloud an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll get
  goin&rsquo; good here&mdash;they&rsquo;ll kind of figur&rsquo; then that
  there ain&rsquo;t any law to bother &rsquo;em&mdash;an&rsquo;, unless I miss
  my guess, Big Cloud&rsquo;s in for the hottest celebration in its history,
  which will be goin&rsquo; some for it&rsquo;s had a few before that weren&rsquo;t
  tame by a damn sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired Keating, &ldquo;what do you intend to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m-m,&rdquo; drawled Spirlaw reflectively, and there was
  a speculative look in his eyes as they roved over his assistant. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  what I&rsquo;ve been chewin&rsquo; over since I caught that skunk Kuryla
  last night. As far as I can figur&rsquo; it the chance of trouble here depends
  on how far those cusses go at Big Cloud. If I knew that, I&rsquo;d know what
  to expect, h&rsquo;m? I thought I&rsquo;d send you up to headquarters for
  a day. You could have a talk with the super, tell him just where we stand
  here, an&rsquo; size things up there generally. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course. All right, if you want me to,&rdquo; agreed Keating
  readily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy,&rdquo; said Spirlaw, heartily. &ldquo;Number
  Twelve will be along in half an hour. I&rsquo;ll flag her, an&rsquo; you
  can go an&rsquo; get ready now. I&rsquo;ll give you a letter to take along
  to Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Keating, with a nod of assent, turned briskly away, Spirlaw watched him
  out of sight&mdash;and the hint of a smile played over the lips of the road
  boss. He pulled a report sheet from his pocket, and on the back of it scrawled
  laboriously a letter to the superintendent of the Hill Division. It wasn&rsquo;t
  a very long letter even with the P. S. included. His smile hardened as he
  read it over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Supt., Big Cloud,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;Dear Sir:&mdash;Replying
  to yours 8th inst., please send a couple of good .45s, and <i>plenty of stuffing</i>.
  (&lsquo;Plenty of stuffing&rsquo; was heavily underscored.) Yrs. Resp., H.
  Spirlaw. P.S. <i>Keep the boy up there out of this</i>.&rdquo; (The P. S.
  was even more heavily underscored than the other.)</p>
  <p>Wise and learned in the ways of men&mdash;and Polacks&mdash;was Spirlaw.
  Spirlaw was not dealing with the <i>possibility</i> of trouble&mdash;it was
  simply a question of how long it would be before it started. He folded the
  letter, sealed it in one of the company&rsquo;s manilas, and, as he watched
  Number Twelve disappear around the bend steaming east for Big Cloud with
  Keating aboard her and the epistle reposing in Keating&rsquo;s pocket, he
  stretched out his arms that were big as derrick booms and drew in a long
  breath like a man from whose shoulders has dropped a heavy load.</p>
  <p>That day Spirlaw talked from his heart to the men, and they listened in
  sullen, stupid silence, leaning on their picks and shovels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know me,&rdquo; he snapped, and his eyes starting at the right
  of the group rested for a bare second on each individual face as they swept
  down the line. &ldquo;You know <i>me</i>. You&rsquo;ve been actin&rsquo; like
  sulky dogs lately&mdash;don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t spotted it. You
  saw what happened to that coyote friend of yours that sneaked in here last
  night. I meant it as a lesson for the bunch of you as well as him. The yarns
  he was fillin&rsquo; you full of are mostly lies, an&rsquo; if they ain&rsquo;t
  it&rsquo;s none of your business, anyhow. It won&rsquo;t pay you to look
  for trouble, I promise you that. You can take it from me that I&rsquo;ll
  bash the first man to powder that tries it. Get that? Well then, wiggle them
  picks a bit an&rsquo; get busy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man that hits first,&rdquo; said Spirlaw to himself, as he walked
  away, &ldquo;is the man that usually comes out on top. I guess them there
  few kind words of mine &rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em a little something to chew
  on till Carleton sends that hardware down, I guess they will, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The camp was pretty quiet that night&mdash;quieter than usual. The cook-house
  and the three bunk-houses, that lay a few hundred yards east of the trestle,
  might have been occupied by dead men for all the sounds that came from them.
  Occasionally, Spirlaw, sitting out as usual in front of his own shanty, that
  was between the trestle and the gang&rsquo;s quarters, saw a Polack or two
  skulk from one of the bunk-houses to the other&mdash;and he scowled savagely
  as he divided his glances between them and the sky. It looked like a storm
  in the mountains, and a storm in the mountains is never by any possibility
  to be desired&mdash;least of all was it to be desired just then. The men
  at work was one thing; the men cooped up for a day, or two days, of enforced
  idleness with the temper they were in was another&mdash;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw turned in that night with the low, ominous roll of distant thunder
  for a lullaby.</p>
  <p>Once in the night he woke suddenly at the sound of a splitting crash, and
  once, twice, and again, like a fierce, winking stream of flame, the lightning
  filled the shack bright as day, while on the roof the rain beat steadily
  like the tattoo of a corps of snare drums. Spirlaw smiled grimly as the darkness
  shut down on him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got the little builder out just about the right time, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo; he
  remarked to himself; and, turning over in his bunk, went to sleep again&mdash;but
  even in his sleep the grim smile lingered on his lips.</p>
  <p>The morning broke with the steady downpour unabated. Everything ran water,
  and the rock cut was filled with it. Work was out of the question. Spirlaw
  ate his breakfast, that the dripping camp cook brought him, and then, putting
  on his rubber boots and coat, started over for the track. Number Eleven was
  due at the Ca&ntilde;on at seven-thirty, and she would have the package of &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; he
  had asked Carleton for.</p>
  <p>But though seven-thirty came, Number Eleven did not&mdash;neither did any
  other train, east or west. The hours passed from a long morning to drag through
  a longer afternoon. Something was wrong somewhere&mdash;and badly wrong at
  that. Spirlaw&rsquo;s face was blacker than the storm. Twice, once in the
  morning and once in the afternoon, he started down the track in the direction
  of Keefer&rsquo;s Siding, which was just what its name proclaimed it to be&mdash;a
  siding, no more, no less, only there was an operator there. Each time, however,
  he changed his mind after getting no further than a few yards. The Polacks
  could be no less alive to the fact than himself that something out of the
  ordinary was in the air, and second considerations swung strongly to the
  advisability of sticking close to the camp, so that his presence might have
  the effect of dampening the ardor of any mischief that might be brewing.</p>
  <p>It was not until well on toward eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening and the
  last of the twilight that the hoarse screech of a whistle sounded down the
  ca&ntilde;on grade&mdash;a long blast and three short ones. It was belated Number
  Eleven whistling for the camp&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t stop, just slow down
  to transact her business. Spirlaw, who was in his shanty at the time, snatched
  up his hat, dashed out of the door, and headed for the bend of the track.
  As he did so, out of the tail of his eye, he caught sight of the Polacks
  clustered with out-poked heads from the open doors of the bunk-houses.</p>
  <p>As he reached the line, Number Eleven came round the curve, and the door
  of the express car swung back. The messenger dropped a package into his hand
  that the road boss received with a grim smile, and a word into his ear that
  caused Spirlaw&rsquo;s jaw to drop&mdash;nor was that all that dropped, for,
  from the rear end, as the train rolled by&mdash;dropped Keating.</p>
  <p>White-faced and shaky the boy looked&mdash;more so than usual. Spirlaw stared
  as though he had seen an apparition, stared for a minute in silence before
  he could lay tongue to words&mdash;then they came like the out-spout of a
  volcano.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s the meanin&rsquo; of this?&rdquo; he roared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who in the double-blanked blazes let you out of Big Cloud, h&rsquo;m?
  I&rsquo;ll have some&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get in out of the wet,&rdquo; broke in Keating, smiling
  through a spell of coughing that racked him at that moment. &ldquo;You can
  growl your head off then, if you like&rdquo;&mdash;and he started on a run
  for the shack.</p>
  <p>Once inside, Spirlaw rounded on the boy again, and he stopped only when
  he was out of breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Carleton tell you to stay where you was?&rdquo; he finished
  bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Keating, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s about the first
  thing he <i>did</i> say after he had read your letter, when I gave it to
  him yesterday. Then I tumbled to why you had sent me out of camp. You&rsquo;re
  about as square as they make them, Spirlaw. You needn&rsquo;t blame Carleton, <i>he</i> had
  about all he could do without paying any attention to me or any one else.
  Had any wires or news in here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I knew something was up, because Number Eleven is the first
  train in or out to-day. The express messenger just said they&rsquo;d cut
  loose in Big Cloud and wrecked about everything in sight, but I guess he
  was puttin&rsquo; it on a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t put on anything,&rdquo; said Keating slowly. &ldquo;My
  God, Spirlaw, it was an awful night! The freight-house and the shops and
  the roundhouse, what&rsquo;s left of them, are ashes. They cut all the wires
  and then they cut loose themselves&mdash;the Polacks and that crowd, you
  know. Yes, they wrecked everything in sight, and there&rsquo;s a dozen lives
  gone to pay for it.&rdquo; Keating stopped suddenly, and again began to cough.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw looked at the boy uneasily, and mechanically fumbled with the cords
  of the package he had laid upon the table. By the time he had removed the
  wrappers and disclosed two ugly, businesslike looking .45s and a half-dozen
  boxes of cartridges, Keating&rsquo;s paroxysm had passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess it was exciting enough for <i>me</i>, anyhow&rdquo;&mdash;Keating
  tried hard to make his laugh ring true. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little weak from
  it yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t sick,&rdquo; Spirlaw burst out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  make you sick for comin&rsquo; back here. You know well enough we&rsquo;ll
  get it next&mdash;you knew so well you came back to help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told Carleton he ought to send some help down here,&rdquo; Keating
  interrupted hastily; &ldquo;and he just looked at me like a crazy man&mdash;he
  was half mad anyhow with the ruin of things. &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; he flung
  out at me. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s it coming from? Let Spirlaw yank up his stakes
  and pull out if things get looking bad!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull out!&rdquo; shouted Spirlaw, in a sudden roar. &ldquo;Pull out! <i>Me!</i> Not
  for all the cross-eyed, hamstrung Polacks on the system!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Keating quietly. &ldquo;After
  what I saw last night, I think you&rsquo;d better. There was no holding them&mdash;they
  were like savages, and the further they went the worse they got. They were
  backed up by whisky and the worst element in town. I was in the station with
  Carleton, Regan, Harvey, Riley and Spence and some of the other dispatchers.
  It was a regular pitched battle, and in spite of their revolvers the station
  would have gone with the rest if, along toward morning, the striking trainmen
  and the Brotherhood hadn&rsquo;t taken a hand and helped us out. I don&rsquo;t
  know that it&rsquo;s over yet, that it won&rsquo;t break out again to-night;
  though I heard Carleton say there&rsquo;d be a detachment of the police in
  town by four o&rsquo;clock. I wish you would pull out, Spirlaw. You said
  yourself that all these fellows here needed to start them sticking their
  claws into you was a little encouragement from the other end. They&rsquo;ve
  been afraid of you, but they hate you like poison. Once started, they&rsquo;ll
  be worse than the crowd at Big Cloud for hate is a harder driver than whisky.
  Then besides, I really think you&rsquo;d be of more use in Big Cloud. You
  could do some good there no matter what the end was, while here you&rsquo;re
  alone and you stand to lose everything and gain nothing. I wish you would
  pull out, Spirlaw, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw reached out his hand and laid it on Keating&rsquo;s shoulder, as
  he shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a whole <i>lot</i> to lose,&rdquo; he answered, his
  hard face softening a little. &ldquo;A whole lot. I can&rsquo;t say things
  the way you do, but I guess you&rsquo;ll understand. You got something that
  means a whole lot to you, that you&rsquo;d risk anything for&mdash;what you
  want to do and what you want to leave behind you when it comes along time
  to cash in. Well, I guess most of us have in one way or another, though mabbe
  it don&rsquo;t rank anywheres up to that. I reckon, too, a whole lot of us
  don&rsquo;t never think to put it in words, an&rsquo; a whole lot of us couldn&rsquo;t
  if we tried to, but it&rsquo;s there with any man that&rsquo;s any good.
  I&rsquo;d rather go out for keeps than pull out&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather they&rsquo;d
  plant me. D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d want to live an&rsquo; have to cross
  the street because I couldn&rsquo;t look <i>even a Polack</i> in the eyes&mdash;a
  man would be better dead, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Keating did not answer, he seemed to be weighing the possibility
  of still shaking the determination of the road boss before accepting it as
  irrevocable: then, evidently coming to the conclusion that it was useless
  to argue further, he pointed to the revolvers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the sooner you load those the better,&rdquo; he jerked out.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw looked at him curiously, questioningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; went on Keating, answering the unspoken interrogation, &ldquo;when
  I dropped off the train I saw that fellow Kuryla&mdash;he was pointed out
  to me in Big Cloud yesterday&mdash;and three or four more drop off on the
  other side. I didn&rsquo;t know they were on the train until then, of course,
  or I would have had them put off. There isn&rsquo;t much doubt about what
  they are here for, is there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; Spirlaw ripped out with an oath. &ldquo;No,
  there ain&rsquo;t much doubt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He snatched up a cartridge-box, slit the paper band with his thumb nail,
  and, breaking the revolvers, began to cram the cartridges into the cylinders.
  His face was twitching and the red that flushed it shaded to a deep purple.
  Not another word came from him&mdash;just a deadly quiet. He thrust the weapons
  into his pockets, strode to the door, opened it, stepped over the threshold&mdash;and
  stopped. An instant he hung there in indecision, then he came back, shut
  the door behind him, sat down on the edge of his bunk, and looked at Keating
  grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been one train along, there&rsquo;ll be another,&rdquo; he
  snapped. &ldquo;An&rsquo; the first one that comes you&rsquo;ll get aboard
  of. I hate to keep those whinin&rsquo; coyotes waitin&rsquo;, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no train,&rdquo; Keating cut in coolly; &ldquo;but
  I&rsquo;ll take a revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw growled and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about Kuryla at first?&rdquo; he demanded
  abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know why as well as I do,&rdquo; smiled Keating. &ldquo;I wanted
  to get you away from here if I could. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
  use trying at all if I&rsquo;d begun by telling you that. Wild horses wouldn&rsquo;t
  have budged you then. As for a train, what&rsquo;s the use of talking about
  it, there probably won&rsquo;t be another one along under an hour. In the
  meantime, give me one of the guns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw&rsquo;s refusal died half uttered on his lips, as he sprang suddenly
  to his feet; then he whipped out the revolvers and shoved one quickly into
  Keating&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>Carried down with the sweep of the wind came the sound of many voices raised
  in shouts and discordant song. It grew louder, swelled, and broke into a
  high-pitched, defiant yell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whisky!&rdquo; gritted Spirlaw between his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That devil Kuryla and the coyotes that came with him knew the best
  an&rsquo; quickest way to start the ball rollin&rsquo;. Well, son, I reckon
  we&rsquo;re in for it. The only thing I&rsquo;m sorry about is that you&rsquo;re
  here; but that can&rsquo;t be helped now. You were white clean through to
  come&mdash;Holy Mother, listen to that!&rdquo;&mdash;another yell broke louder,
  fiercer than before over the roar of the storm.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw stepped to the door and peered out. It was already getting dark.
  The rain still poured in sheets, and the wind howled down the gorge in wild,
  furious, spasmodic gusts. Thin streaks of light strayed out from the doors
  of the bunk-houses, and around the doors were gathered shadowy groups. A
  moment more and the shadowy groups welded into a single dark mass. Came a
  mad, exultant yell from a single throat. It was caught up, flung back, echoed
  and reechoed by a score of voices&mdash;and the dark mass began to move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;d better put out that light, son,&rdquo; said Spirlaw
  coolly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use makin&rsquo; targets of our&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before he ended, before Keating had more than taken a step forward, a lump
  of rock shivered the little window and crashed into the lamp&mdash;it was
  out for keeps. A howl followed this exhibition of marksmanship, and, following
  that, a volley of stones smashed against the side of the shack thick and
  fast as hail&mdash;then the onrush of feet.</p>
  <p>Spirlaw&rsquo;s revolver cut the black with a long, blinding flash, then
  another, and another. Screams and shrieks answered him, but it did not halt
  the Polacks. In a mob they rushed the door. Spirlaw sprang back, trying to
  close it after him; instead, a dozen hands grasped and half wrenched it from
  its hinges.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie down on the floor, Spirlaw, <i>quick!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;it was
  Keating&rsquo;s voice, punctuated with a cough. The next instant his gun
  barked, playing through the doorway like a gatling.</p>
  <p>From the floor the road boss joined in. The mob wavered, pitched swaying
  this way and that, then broke and ran, struggling with each other to get
  out of the line of fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Keating. &ldquo;I guess that will hold them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t begun,&rdquo; was Spirlaw&rsquo;s grim response. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
  them cartridges?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the table&mdash;got them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Spirlaw, after a minute&rsquo;s groping. &ldquo;Here,
  put a box in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are they up to now?&rdquo; asked Keating as, in the silence
  that had fallen, they reloaded and listened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; growled Spirlaw; &ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ll
  find out quick enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, from a little distance away, came the splintering crash of
  woodwork&mdash;then silence again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the storehouse,&rdquo; Spirlaw snarled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
  after the bars an&rsquo; anything else they can lay their hands on. Guess
  they weren&rsquo;t countin&rsquo; on our havin&rsquo; anything more than
  our fists to fight with, guess they weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keating&rsquo;s only reply was a cough.</p>
  <p>The minutes passed, two, three, five of them. Once outside sounded what
  might have been the stealthy scuffle of feet or only a storm-sound so construed
  by the imagination. Then, from the direction of the riverbed, sudden, sharp,
  came a terrific roar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; yelled Spirlaw. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the trestle gone&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
  blown it up! They&rsquo;re sure to have laid a fuse here, too. Get out of
  here quick! Fool that I was, I might have known it was the <i>dynamite</i> they
  were after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both men were scrambling for the door as he spoke. They reached it not an
  instant too soon. The ground behind them lifted, heaved; the walls, the roof
  of the shack rose, cracked like eggshells, and scattered in flying pieces&mdash;and
  the mighty, deafening detonation of the explosion echoed up and down the
  gorge, echoed again&mdash;and died away.</p>
  <p>The mob caught sight of them as they ran and, foiled for the moment, sent
  up a yell of rage&mdash;then started in pursuit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make for the cut,&rdquo; shouted Spirlaw. &ldquo;We can hold them
  off there behind the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keating had no breath for words. Panting, sick, his head swimming, a fleck
  of blood upon his lips, he struggled after the giant form of the road boss;
  while, behind, coming ever closer, ringing in his ears, were the wild cries
  of the maddened Polacks. The splash of water revived him a little as they
  plunged along the old right of way where the river, flooded by the storm,
  had again claimed its own. The worst of it was up to his armpits. A grip
  on his shoulder and a pull from Spirlaw helped him over. They gained the
  other side with a bare two yards separating them from the mob behind, went
  on again&mdash;and then Spirlaw caught his foot, tripped and pitched headlong,
  causing Keating, at his heels, to stumble and fall over him.</p>
  <p>Like wild beasts the Polacks surged upon them. Keating tried to regain his
  feet&mdash;but he got no further than his knees as a swinging blow from a
  pick-handle caught him on his head. Half-stunned, he sank back and, as consciousness
  left him, he heard Spirlaw&rsquo;s great voice roar out like the maddened
  bellow of a bull, saw the giant form rise with, it seemed, a dozen Polacks
  clinging to neck and shoulders, legs and body, saw him shake them off and
  the massive arms rise and fall&mdash;and all was a blur, all darkness.</p>
  <p>The road boss lay stretched out a yard away from him when he opened his
  eyes. He was very weak. He raised himself on his elbow. From the camp down
  the line he could see the lights in the bunk-houses, hear drunken, chorused
  shouts. He crept to Spirlaw, called him, shook him&mdash;the big road boss
  never moved. The Polacks had evidently left both of them for dead&mdash;and
  one, it seemed, was. He slid his hand inside the other&rsquo;s vest for the
  heart beat. So faint it was at first he could not feel it, then he got it,
  and, realizing that Spirlaw was still alive he straightened up and looked
  helplessly around&mdash;and, in a flash, like the knell of doom, Spirlaw&rsquo;s
  words came back to him: &ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s the trestle gone!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sick the boy was with his clotting lungs, deathly sick, weak from the blow
  on his head, dizzy, and his brain swam. <i>There&rsquo;s the trestle gone!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he
  coughed it out between blue lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s the trestle gone!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keefer&rsquo;s Siding was a mile away. Somehow he must reach it, must get
  the word along the line that the <i>trestle was out</i>, get the word along
  before the stalled traffic moved, before the first train east or west crashed
  through to death, before more wreck and ruin was added to the tale that had
  gone before. He bent to Spirlaw&rsquo;s ear and three times called him frantically: &ldquo;Spirlaw!
  Spirlaw! <i>Spirlaw!</i>&rdquo; There was no response. He tried to lift him,
  tried to drag him&mdash;the great bulk was far beyond his strength. And the
  minutes were flying by, each marking the one perhaps when it would be too
  late, too late to warn any one that the trestle was out.</p>
  <p>Just up past the rock cut, a bare twenty yards away where the leads to the
  temporary track swung into the straight of the main line, was the platform
  handcar they had used for carrying tools and the odds and ends of supplies
  between the storehouse and the work&mdash;if he could only get Spirlaw there!</p>
  <p>He called him again, shook him, breathing a prayer for help. The road boss
  stirred, raised himself a little, and sank down again with a moan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spirlaw, <i>Spirlaw</i>, for God&rsquo;s sake, man, try to get up!
  I&rsquo;ll help you. You must, do you hear, <i>you must!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he
  was dragging at the road boss&rsquo;s collar.</p>
  <p>Keating&rsquo;s voice seemed to reach the other&rsquo;s consciousness, for,
  weakly, dazed, without sense, blindly, Spirlaw got upon his knees, then to
  his feet, and, staggering, reeling like a drunken man, his arm around Keating&rsquo;s
  neck, his weight almost crushing to the ground the one sicker than himself,
  the two stumbled, pitched, and, at the end, <i>crawled</i> those twenty yards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The handcar, Spirlaw, the handcar!&rdquo; gasped Keating. &ldquo;Get
  on it. You must! Try! Try!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spirlaw straightened, lurched forward, and fell half across the car with
  out-flung arms&mdash;unconscious again.</p>
  <p>The rest Keating managed somehow, enough so that the dangling legs freed
  the ground by a few inches; then, with bursting lungs, far spent, he unblocked
  the wheels, pushed the car down the little spur, swung the switch, dragged
  himself aboard, and began to pump his way west toward Keefer&rsquo;s Siding.</p>
  <p>No man may tell the details of that mile, every inch of which was wrung
  from blood that oozed from parted, quivering lips; no man may question from
  Whom came the strength to the frail body, where strength was not; the reprieve
  to the broken lungs, that long since should have done their worst&mdash;only
  Keating knew that the years were ended forever, that with every stroke of
  the pump-handle the time was shorter. The few minutes to win through&mdash;that
  was the last stake!</p>
  <p>At the end he choked&mdash;fighting for his consciousness, as, like dancing
  points, switch lights swam before him. He checked with the brake, reeled
  from the car, fell, tried to rise and fell back again. Then, on his hands
  and knees, he crept toward the station door. It had come at last. The hemorrhage
  that he had fought back with all his strength was upon him. He beat upon
  the door. It opened, a lantern was flashed upon him, and he fell inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The trestle&rsquo;s out at the Glacier&mdash;hold trains both ways&mdash;Polacks&mdash;Spirlaw
  on&mdash;handcar&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all. Keating never spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno as you&rsquo;d call him a builder,&rdquo; says Clarihue,
  the night turner, when <i>he</i> tells the story in the darkened roundhouse
  in the shadow of the big ten-wheelers on the pits, while the steam purrs
  softly at the gauges and sometimes a pop-valve lifts with a catchy sob, &ldquo;I
  dunno as you would. It depends on the way you look at it. Accordin&rsquo; to
  him, he was. He left something behind him, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>7<br>
      <a name="TheGuardianOfTheDevilsSlide"></a>The Guardian Of The Devil&rsquo;s Slide</b></h2>
  <p>There is one bad piece of track on the Hill Division, particularly bad,
  which is the same as saying that it is the worst piece of track, bar none,
  on the American Continent. Not that the engineers were to blame&mdash;they
  weren&rsquo;t. It was Dame Nature in the shape of the Rockies&mdash;Dame
  Nature and the directors.</p>
  <p>Sir Ivers Clayborn, gray-haired and grizzled, a man schooled in the practical
  school of many lands and many years, who was chief consulting engineer when
  the road was building, advised a double-looped tunnel that, according to
  his sketch, looked something like the figure 8 canted over sideways. The
  directors poised their glasses and examined the sketch with interest until
  they caught sight of the penciled estimate in the corner. That settled it.
  They did not even take the trouble to vote. They asked for an alternative&mdash;and
  they got it. They got the Devil&rsquo;s Slide.</p>
  <p>First and last, it has euchred more money out of the treasury of the Transcontinental
  than it would have taken to build things Sir Ivers&rsquo; way to begin with;
  and it has taken some years, a good many of them, for the directors to learn
  their lesson. The old board never did, for that matter; but, thanks perhaps
  to younger blood, they&rsquo;ve begun now to build as they should have built
  in the first place. It isn&rsquo;t finished yet, that double-looped tunnel,
  it won&rsquo;t be for years, but, no matter, it&rsquo;s begun, and some day
  a good many more than a few men will sleep the easier because of it.</p>
  <p>From Carleton, the super, to the last section hand and track-walker, the
  Devil&rsquo;s Slide was a nightmare. The dispatchers, under their green-shaded
  lamps, cursed it in the gray hours of dawn; the traffic department cursed
  it spasmodically, but at such times so whole-heartedly and with such genuine
  fervor and abandon that its occasional lapses into silence were overlooked;
  the motive power department in the shape of Regan, the master mechanic, cursed
  it all the time, and did it breathlessly. It had only one friend&mdash;the
  passenger agent&rsquo;s department. The passenger agent&rsquo;s department
  swore <i>by</i> it&mdash;on account of the scenery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scenery!&rdquo; gulped the dispatchers, and the white showed under
  their nail tips as their fingers tightened on their keys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scenery!&rdquo; howled the traffic department, and reached for the
  claim file.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scenery!&rdquo;&mdash;Regan didn&rsquo;t say it&mdash;he choked.
  Just choked, and spat the exclamation point in a stream of black-strap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scenery!&rdquo; murmured Mr. General Passenger Agent esthetically,
  waving a soft and diamond bedecked hand from the platform of Carleton&rsquo;s
  private car. &ldquo;Wonderful! Grand! Magnificent! We&rsquo;ve got them all
  beaten into a coma. No other road has anything like it anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have not,&rdquo; agreed Carleton, and the bitterness of his
  soul was in his words.</p>
  <p>Everybody was right.</p>
  <p>The general passenger agent was right&mdash;the scenic grandeur was beyond
  compare, and he made the most of it in booklets, in leaflets, in pamphlets,
  and in a score of pages in a score of different magazines.</p>
  <p>The others were right&mdash;the Devil&rsquo;s Slide was everything that
  the ethics of engineering said it shouldn&rsquo;t be. It was neither level
  nor straight. In its marvelous two miles from the summit of the pass to the
  ca&ntilde;on below, its nearest approach to the ethical was three percent drop.
  There wasn&rsquo;t much of that&mdash;most of it was a straight five! It
  twisted, it turned, it slid, it slithered, and it dove around projecting
  mountain-sides at scandalous tangents and with indecent abruptness.</p>
  <p>Chick Coogan swore, with a grin, that he could see his own headlight coming
  at him about half the time every trip he made up or down. That, of course,
  is exaggerating a little&mdash;but not much! Coogan sized up the Devil&rsquo;s
  Slide pretty well when he said that, all things considered, pretty well&mdash;there
  wasn&rsquo;t much chance to mistake what he meant, or what the Devil&rsquo;s
  Slide was, or what he thought of it. Anyway, be that as it may, Coogan&rsquo;s
  description gave the division the only chance they ever had to crack a smile
  when the Devil&rsquo;s Slide was in question.</p>
  <p>They smiled then, those railroaders of the Rockies, but they&rsquo;ll look
  at you queerly now if you mention the two together&mdash;Coogan and the Devil&rsquo;s
  Slide. Fate is a pretty grim player sometimes.</p>
  <p>Any one on the Hill Division can tell you the story&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
  reason to know it, and they do&mdash;to the last man. If you&rsquo;d rather
  get it first hand in a roundhouse, or between trains from the operator at
  some lone station that&rsquo;s no more than a siding, or in the caboose of
  a way freight&mdash;if you are a big enough man to ride there, and that means
  being bigger than most men&mdash;or anywhere your choice or circumstance
  leads you from the super&rsquo;s office to a track-walker&rsquo;s shanty,
  if you&rsquo;d rather get it that way, and you&rsquo;ll get it better, far
  better, than you will here, don&rsquo;t try any jolly business to make the
  boys talk&mdash;just say a good word for Coogan, Chick Coogan. That&rsquo;s
  the &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo;&mdash;and the only one.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s no use talking about the logical or the illogical, the rational
  or the irrational, when it comes to Coo-gan&rsquo;s story. Coogan&rsquo;s
  story is just Coogan&rsquo;s story, that&rsquo;s all there is to it. What
  one man does another doesn&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t cancel the human equation
  because there&rsquo;s nothing to cancel it with; it&rsquo;s there all the
  time swaying, compelling, dominating every act in a man&rsquo;s life. The
  higher branches of mathematics go far, and to some men three dimensions are
  but elemental, but there is one problem even they have never solved and never
  will solve&mdash;the human equation. What Coogan did, you might not do&mdash;or
  you might.</p>
  <p>Coogan didn&rsquo;t come to the Transcontinental a fullblown engineer from
  some other road as a good many of the boys have, though that&rsquo;s nothing
  against them; Coogan was a product of the Hill Division pure and simple.
  He began as a kid almost before the steel was spiked home, and certainly
  before the right of way was shaken down enough to begin to look like business.
  He started at the bottom and he went up. Call-boy, sweeper, wiper, fireman&mdash;one
  after the other. Promotion came fast in the early days, for, the Rockies
  once bridged, business came fast, too; and Coogan had his engine at twenty-one,
  and at twenty-four he was pulling the Imperial Limited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good goods,&rdquo; said Regan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he is. The
  best ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nobody questioned that, not only because there was no one on the division
  who could put anything over Coogan in a cab, but also because, and perhaps
  even more pertinent a reason, every one liked Coogan&mdash;some of them did
  more than that.</p>
  <p>Straight as a string, clean as a whistle was Coogan, six feet in his stockings
  with a body that played up to every inch of his height, black hair, jet black,
  black eyes that laughed with you, never <i>at</i> you, a smile and a cheery
  nod always&mdash;the kind of a man that makes you feel every time you see
  them that the world isn&rsquo;t such an eternal dismal grind after all. That
  was Chick Coogan&mdash;all except his heart. Coogan had a heart like a woman&rsquo;s,
  and a hard luck story from a &rsquo;bo stealing a ride, a railroad man, or
  any one else for that matter, never failed to make him poorer by a generous
  percentage of what happened to be in his pocket at the time. Who wouldn&rsquo;t
  like him! Queer how things happen.</p>
  <p>It was the day Coogan got married that Regan gave him 505 and the Limited
  run as a sort of wedding present; and that night Big Cloud turned itself
  completely inside out doing honor and justice to the occasion.</p>
  <p>Big Cloud has had other celebrations, before and since, but none quite so
  unanimous as that one. Restraint never did run an overwhelmingly strong favorite
  with the town, but that night it was hung up higher than the arms on the
  telegraph poles. Men that the community used to hide behind and push forward
  as hostages of righteousness, when it was on its good behavior and wanted
  to put on a front, cut loose and outshone the best&mdash;or the worst, if
  you like that better&mdash;-of the crowd that never made any bones about
  being on the other side of the fence. They burned red flares, very many of
  them, that Carleton neglected to imagine had any connection with the storekeeper
  and the supply account; they committed indiscretions, mostly of a liquid
  nature, that any one but the trainmaster, who was temporarily blind in both
  eyes, could have seen; and, as a result, the Hill Division the next day was
  an eminently paralytic and feeble affair. This is a very general description
  of the event, because sometimes it is not wise to particularize&mdash;this
  is a case in point.</p>
  <p>Coogan&rsquo;s send-off was a send-off no other man, be he king, prince,
  president, sho-gun, or high mucky-muck of whatever degree, could have got&mdash;except
  Coogan. Coogan got it because he was Coogan, just Coogan&mdash;and the night
  was a night to wonder at.</p>
  <p>Regan summarized it the next evening over the usual game of pedro with Carleton,
  upstairs over the station in the superb office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apart from Coogan and me,&rdquo; said the master mechanic, in a voice
  that was still suspiciously husky, &ldquo;apart from Coogan and me and <i>mabbe</i> the
  minister&mdash;&rdquo; the rest was a wave of his hand. Regan could wave
  his hand with a wealth of eloquence that was astounding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; agreed Carleton, with a grin. &ldquo;Too bad to
  drag <i>them</i> into it, though. Both &lsquo;peds&rsquo; to me, Tommy. It&rsquo;s
  a good thing for the discipline of the division that bigamy is against the
  law, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be talking of it,&rdquo; said Regan reminiscently, &ldquo;when
  you and me are on the scrap heap, Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted the super. &ldquo;Play
  on, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t. They only talked of Coogan&rsquo;s wedding for about
  a year&mdash;no, they don&rsquo;t talk about it now. We&rsquo;ll get to that
  presently.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Limited was the star run on the division&mdash;Regan gave Coogan
  the thirty-third degree when he gave him that&mdash;that and 505, which was
  the last word in machine design. And Coogan took them, took them and the
  schedule rights that pertained thereto, which were a clear and a clean-swept
  track, and day after day, up hill and down, Number One or Number Two, as
  the case might be, pulled into division on the dot. Coogan&rsquo;s stock
  soared&mdash;if that were possible; but not Coogan. The youngest engineer
  on the road and top of them all, would have been excuse enough for him to
  show his oats and, within decent limits, no one would have thought the worse
  of him for it&mdash;Coogan never turned a hair. He was still the friend of
  the &rsquo;bo and the man in trouble, still the Coogan that had been a wiper
  in the roundhouse; and yet, perhaps, not quite the same, for two new loves
  had come into his life&mdash;his love for Annie Coogan, and his love, the
  love of the master craftsman, for 505. In the little house at home he talked
  to Annie of the big mountain racer and Annie, being an engineer&rsquo;s daughter
  as well as an engineer&rsquo;s wife, listened with understanding and a smile,
  and in the smile was pride and love; in the cab Coogan talked of Annie, always
  Annie, and one day he told his fireman a secret that made big Jim Dahleen
  grin sheepishly and stick out a grimy paw.</p>
  <p>Fate is a pretty grim player sometimes&mdash;and always, it seems, the cards
  are stacked.</p>
  <p>The days and the weeks and the months went by, and then there came a morning
  when a sober-, serious-faced group of men stood gathered in the super&rsquo;s
  office, as Number Two&rsquo;s whistle, in from the Eastbound run, sounded
  down the gorge. They looked at Regan. Slowly, the master mechanic turned,
  went out of the room and down the stairs to the platform, as 505 shot round
  the bend and rolled into the station. For a moment Regan stood irresolute,
  then he started for the front-end. He went no further than the colonist coach,
  that was coupled behind the mail car. Here he stopped, made a step forward,
  changed his mind, climbed over the colonist&rsquo;s platform, dropped down
  on the other side of the track, and began to walk toward the roundhouse&mdash;they
  changed engines at Big Cloud and 505, already uncoupled, was scooting up
  for the spur to back down for the &rsquo;table.</p>
  <p>The soles of Regan&rsquo;s boots seemed like plates of lead as he went along,
  and he mopped his forehead nervously. There was a general air of desertion
  about the roundhouse. The &rsquo;table was set and ready for 505, but there
  wasn&rsquo;t a soul in sight. Regan nodded to himself in sympathetic understanding.
  He crossed the turntable, walked around the half circle, and entered the
  roundhouse through the engine doors by the far pit&mdash;the one next to
  that which belonged to 505. Here, just inside, he waited, as the big mogul
  came slowly down the track, took the &rsquo;table with a slight jolt, and
  stopped. He saw Coogan, big, brawny, swing out of the cab like an athlete,
  and then he heard the engineer speak to his fireman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks like a graveyard around here, Jim. Wonder where the boys are.
  I won&rsquo;t wait to swing the &rsquo;table, they&rsquo;ll be around in a
  minute, I guess. I want to get up to the little woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dahleen answered. &ldquo;Leave her to me, I&rsquo;ll
  run her in. Good luck to you, Chick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coogan was starting across the yards with a stride that was almost a run.
  Regan opened his mouth to shout&mdash;and swallowed a lump in his throat
  instead. Twice he made as though to follow the engineer, and twice something
  stronger than himself held him back; and then, as though he had been a thief,
  the master mechanic stole out from behind the doors, went back across the
  tracks, climbed the stairs to Carleton&rsquo;s room with lagging steps, and
  entered.</p>
  <p>The rest were still there: Carleton in his swivel chair, Harvey, the division
  engineer, Spence, the chief dispatcher, and Riley, the trainmaster. Regan
  shook his head and dropped into a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said in a husky voice. &ldquo;My God,
  I <i>couldn&rsquo;t,</i>&rdquo; he repeated, and swept out his arms.</p>
  <p>A bitter oath sprang from Carleton&rsquo;s lips, lips that were not often
  profane, and his teeth snapped through the amber of his briar. The others
  just looked out of the window.</p>
  <p>MacVicar, a spare man, took the Limited out that night, and it was three
  days before Coogan reported again. Maybe it was the fit of the black store-clothes
  and perhaps the coat didn&rsquo;t hang just right, but as he entered the
  roundhouse he didn&rsquo;t look as straight as he used to look and there
  was a queer inward slope to his shoulders and he walked like a man who didn&rsquo;t
  see anything. The springy swing through the gangway was gone. He climbed
  to the cab as an old man climbs&mdash;painfully. The boys hung back and didn&rsquo;t
  say anything, just swore under their breaths with full hearts as men do.
  There wasn&rsquo;t anything <i>to</i> say&mdash;nothing that would do any
  good.</p>
  <p>Coogan took 505 and the Limited out that night, took it out the night after
  and the nights that followed, only he didn&rsquo;t talk any more, and the
  slope of the shoulders got a little more pronounced, a little more noticeable,
  a little beyond the cut of any coat. And on the afternoons of the lay-overs
  at Big Cloud, Coogan walked out behind the town to where on the slope of
  the butte were two fresh mounds&mdash;one larger than the other. That was
  all.</p>
  <p>Regan, short, paunchy, big-hearted Regan, tackled Jim Dahleen, Coogan&rsquo;s
  fireman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he say on the run, Jim, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t talkative,&rdquo; Dahleen answered shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell,&rdquo; growled the master mechanic deep in his throat,
  to conceal his emotion. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t doing him any good going
  up there afternoons. God knows it&rsquo;s natural enough, but &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
  doing him any good, not a mite&mdash;nor them either, as far as I can see,
  h&rsquo;m? You got to <i>make</i> him talk, Jim. Wake him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> talk to him?&rdquo; demanded the fireman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes. So I will. I sure will,&rdquo; Regan answered.</p>
  <p>And he meant to, meant to, honestly. But, somehow, Coogan&rsquo;s eyes and
  Coogan&rsquo;s face said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to him as they did to every other
  man, and as the days passed, almost a month of them, Regan shook his head,
  perplexed and troubled, for he was fond of Coogan.</p>
  <p>Then, one night, it happened.</p>
  <p>Regan and Carleton were alone over their pedro at headquarters, except for
  Spence, the dispatcher, in the next room. It was getting close on to eleven-thirty.
  The Imperial Limited, West-bound, with Coogan in the cab, had pulled out
  on time an hour and a half before. The game was lagging, and, as usual, the
  conversation had got around to the engineer, introduced, as it always was,
  by the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sure don&rsquo;t know what to do for the boy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  like to do something. Talking don&rsquo;t amount to anything, does it, h&rsquo;m?&mdash;even
  if you <i>can</i> talk. I can&rsquo;t talk to him, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s got to work a thing like that out for himself, Tommy,&rdquo; Carleton
  answered, &ldquo;and it takes time. That&rsquo;s the only thing that will
  ever help him&mdash;time. I know you&rsquo;re pretty fond of Coogan, even
  more than the rest of us and that&rsquo;s saying a good deal, but you&rsquo;re
  thinking too much about it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Carleton. It&rsquo;s got <i>me</i>. Time,
  and that sort of thing, may be all right, but it ain&rsquo;t very promising
  when a man broods the way he does. I ain&rsquo;t superstitious or anything
  like that, but I&rsquo;ve a feeling I can&rsquo;t just explain that somehow
  something&rsquo;s going to break. Kind of premonition. Ever have anything
  like that? It gets on your mind and you can&rsquo;t shake it off. It&rsquo;s
  on me to-night worse than it&rsquo;s ever been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Carleton laughed. &ldquo;Premonitions are out of
  date, because they&rsquo;ve been traced back to their origin. Out here, I
  should say it was a case of too much of Dutchy&rsquo;s lunch-counter pie.
  You ought to diet anyway, Tommy, you&rsquo;re getting too fat. Hand over
  that fine-cut of yours, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stopped as a sharp cry came from the dispatcher&rsquo;s room, followed
  by an instant&rsquo;s silence, then the crash of a chair sounded as, hastily
  pushed back, it fell to the floor. Quick steps echoed across the room, and
  the next moment Spence, with a white face and holding a sheet of tissue in
  his hand, burst in upon them.</p>
  <p>Carleton sprang to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Spence?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number One,&rdquo; the dispatcher jerked out, and extended the sheet
  on which he had scribbled the message as it came in off the sounder.</p>
  <p>Carleton snatched the paper, and Regan, leaping from his chair, looked over
  his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number One, engine 505, jumped track east of switch-back number two
  in Devil&rsquo;s Slide. Report three known to be killed, others missing.
  Engineer Coogan and fireman Dahleen both hurt,&rdquo; they read.</p>
  <p>Carleton was ever the man of action, and his voice rang hard as chilled
  steel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear the line, Spence. Get your relief and wrecker out at once.
  Wire Dreamer Butte for their wrecker as well, so they can work from both
  ends. Now then, Tommy&mdash;my God, what&rsquo;s the matter with you, are
  you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan was leaning over the back of his chair, his face strained, his arm
  outstretched, finger pointing to the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely. &ldquo;I knew it. That&rsquo;s
  what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton&rsquo;s eyes traveled from the master mechanic to the wall and
  back again in amazed bewilderment, then he shook Regan by the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what, what is?&rdquo; he questioned brusquely. &ldquo;Are
  you mad, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The date,&rdquo; whispered Regan, still pointing to where a large
  single-day calendar with big figures on it hung behind the super&rsquo;s
  desk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the twenty-eighth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Tommy,&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton&rsquo;s
  voice was quiet, restrained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean!&rdquo; Regan burst out, with a hard laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  mean anything, do I? &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t anything to do with it, it&rsquo;s
  just coincidence, mabbe, and mabbe it&rsquo;s not. <i>It&rsquo;s a year ago
  to-night Coogan was married.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Carleton did not speak; like Regan, he stared at the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;Regan caught him up roughly&mdash;&ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t think anything at all. I only know it&rsquo;s queer, ghastly
  queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton nodded his head slowly. Steps were coming up the stairs. The voice
  of Flannagan, the wrecking boss, reached them, other voices excited and loud
  joined in. He slapped the master mechanic on the back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder it caught you, Tommy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  almost creepy. But there&rsquo;s no time for that now. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan laughed, the same hard laugh, as he followed the chief into the dispatcher&rsquo;s
  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;East of number two switch-back, eh?&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s
  any choice for hellishness anywhere on that cursed stretch of track, that&rsquo;s
  it. My God, it&rsquo;s come, and it&rsquo;s come good and hard&mdash;good
  and hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It had. It was a bad mess, a nasty mess&mdash;but, like everything else,
  it might have been worse. Instead of plunging to the right and dropping to
  the ca&ntilde;on eighteen hundred feet below, 505 chose the inward side and rammed
  her nose into the gray mass of rock that made the mountain wall. The wreckers
  from Dreamer Butte and the wreckers from Big Cloud tell of it to this day.
  For twenty-four hours they worked and then they dropped&mdash;and fresh men
  took their places. There was no room to work&mdash;just the narrow ledge
  of the right of way on a circular sweep with the jutting cliff of Old Piebald
  Mountain sticking in between, hiding one of the gangs from the other, and
  around which the big wrecking cranes groped dangling arms and chains like
  fishers angling for a bite. It was a mauled and tangled snarl, and the worst
  of it went over the ca&ntilde;on&rsquo;s edge in pieces, as axes, sledges, wedges,
  bars and cranes ripped and tore their way to the heart of it. And as they
  worked, those hard-faced, grimy, sweating men of the wrecking crews, they
  wondered&mdash;wondered that any one had come out of it alive.</p>
  <p>Back at headquarters in Big Cloud they wondered at it, too&mdash;and they
  wondered also at the cause. Every one that by any possible chance could throw
  any light upon it went on the carpet in the super&rsquo;s office. Everybody
  testified&mdash;everybody except Dahleen, the fireman, and Coogan, the engineer;
  and they didn&rsquo;t testify because they couldn&rsquo;t. Coogan was in
  the hospital with queer, inconsequent words upon his tongue and a welt across
  his forehead that had laid bare the bone from eye to the hair-line of his
  skull; and Dahleen was there also, not so bad, just generally jellied up,
  but still too bad to talk. And the testimony was of little use.</p>
  <p>The tender of switch-back number one reported that the Limited had passed
  him at perhaps a little greater speed than usual&mdash;which was the speed
  of a man&rsquo;s walk, for trains crawl down the Devil&rsquo;s Slide with
  fear and caution&mdash;but not fast enough to cause him to think anything
  about it.</p>
  <p>Hardy, the conductor, testified. Hardy said it was the &ldquo;air;&rdquo; that
  the train began to slide faster and faster after the first switch-back was
  passed and that her speed kept on increasing up to the moment that the crash
  came. He figured that it couldn&rsquo;t be anything else&mdash;just the &ldquo;air&rdquo;&mdash;it
  wouldn&rsquo;t work and the control of the train was lost. That was all he
  knew.</p>
  <p>And while Regan swore and fumed, Carleton&rsquo;s face set grim and hard&mdash;and
  he waited for Dahleen.</p>
  <p>It was a week before the fireman faced Carleton across the super&rsquo;s
  desk, but when that time came Carleton opened on him straight from the shoulder,
  not even a word of sympathy, not so much as &ldquo;glad to see you&rsquo;re
  out again,&rdquo; just straight to the point, hard and quick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dahleen,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;I want to know what happened
  in the cab that night, and I want a straight story. No other kind of talking
  will do you any good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen&rsquo;s face, white with the pallor of his illness, flushed suddenly
  red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jumping a man pretty hard, aren&rsquo;t you, Mr. Carleton?&rdquo; he
  said resentfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ve reason to,&rdquo; replied Carleton. &ldquo;Well,
  I&rsquo;m waiting for that story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no story that I know of,&rdquo; said Dahleen evenly. &ldquo;After
  we passed switch-back number one we lost control of the train&mdash;the &lsquo;air&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
  work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you expect me to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to,&rdquo; retorted Dahleen, with a set jaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you do to stop her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I could,&rdquo; said Dahleen, with terse finality.</p>
  <p>Carleton sprang to his feet, and his fist crashed down upon the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are lying!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;That wreck and the lives
  that are lost are at your door, and if I could prove it!&rdquo;&mdash;he
  shook his fist at the fireman. &ldquo;As it is I can only fire you for violation
  of the rules. I thought at first it was Coogan and that he&rsquo;d gone off
  his head a bit, and you are cur enough to let the blame go there if you could,
  to let me and every other man think so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen&rsquo;s fists clenched, and he took a step forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;Enough from
  you or any other man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton rounded on him more furiously than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you a chance to tell a straight story and you wouldn&rsquo;t.
  God knows what you did that night. I believe you were fighting drunk. I believe
  that gash in Coogan&rsquo;s head wasn&rsquo;t from the wreck. If I knew I&rsquo;d
  fix you.&rdquo; He wrenched open a drawer of his desk, whipped out a metal
  whisky flask, and shook it before Dahleen&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;<i>When you
  were picked up this was in the pocket of your jumper!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The color fled from Dahleen&rsquo;s face leaving it whiter than when he
  had entered the room. He wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. All the
  bluster, all the fight was gone. He stared mutely, a startled, frightened
  look in his eyes, at the damning evidence in the super&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgotten about it, had you?&rdquo; Carleton flung out grimly. &ldquo;Well,
  have you anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t anything to say, is there?&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was
  low with just a hint of the former defiance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine, but
  you can&rsquo;t <i>prove</i> anything. You can&rsquo;t prove I drank it.
  D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d be fool enough to do anything but keep my mouth
  shut?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t <i>prove</i> it&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton&rsquo;s voice
  was deadly cold. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out! I&rsquo;ll give you twelve hours
  to get out of the mountains. The boys, for Coogan&rsquo;s sake alone if for
  no other, would tear you to pieces if they knew the story. No one knows it
  yet but the man who found this in your pocket and myself. I&rsquo;m not going
  to tell you again what I think of you&mdash;<i>get out!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen, without a word, swung slowly on his heel and started for the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Carleton suddenly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pass
  East for you. I don&rsquo;t want your blood on my hands, as I would have
  if Coogan&rsquo;s friends, and that&rsquo;s every last soul out here, got
  hold of you. You&rsquo;ve got twelve hours&mdash;after that they&rsquo;ll
  know&mdash;to set Coogan straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen hesitated, came back, took the slip of paper with a mirthless, half-choked
  laugh, turned again, and the door closed behind him.</p>
  <p>Dahleen was out.</p>
  <p>Carleton kept his word&mdash;twelve hours&mdash;and then from the division
  rose a cry like the cry of savage beasts; but Regan was like a madman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; he swore bitterly, breaking into a seething torrent
  of oaths. &ldquo;What did you let him go for, Carleton? You&rsquo;d no business
  to. You should have held him until Coogan could talk, and then we&rsquo;d
  have had him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton laid his hand quietly on the master mechanic&rsquo;s
  shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re too young out in this country for much
  law. I don&rsquo;t think Coogan knows or ever will know again what happened
  in the cab that night. The doctors don&rsquo;t seem quite able to call the
  turn on him themselves, so they&rsquo;ve said to you and said to me. But
  whether he does or not, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference as far as Dahleen
  goes. It would have been murder to keep him here. And if Coogan ever can
  talk he&rsquo;ll never put a mate in bad no matter what the consequences
  to himself. There&rsquo;s nothing against Dahleen except that he had liquor
  in his possession while on duty. That&rsquo;s what I fired him for&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  the only story that&rsquo;s gone out of this office. You and I and the rest
  are free to put the construction on it that suits us best, and there it ends.
  If I was wrong to let him go, I was wrong. I did what I thought was right&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  all I can ever do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; growled Regan, &ldquo;mabbe; but, damn him, he <i>ought</i> to
  be murdered. I&rsquo;d like to have had &rsquo;em done it! It&rsquo;s that
  smash on the head put Coogan to the bad. You&rsquo;re right about one thing,
  I guess, he&rsquo;ll never be the same Coogan again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in a way this was so; in another it wasn&rsquo;t. It was not the wound
  that was to blame, the doctors were positive about that; but Coogan, it was
  pitifully evident, was not the same. Physically, at the end of a month, he
  left the hospital apparently as well as he had ever been in his life; but
  mentally, somewhere, a cog had slipped. His brain seemed warped and weakened,
  simple as a child&rsquo;s in its workings; his memory fogged and dazed, full
  of indefinite, intangible snatches, vague, indeterminate glimpses of his
  life before. One thing seemed to cling to him, to predominate, to sway him&mdash;the
  Devil&rsquo;s Slide.</p>
  <p>Regan and Carleton talked to him, trying to guide his thoughts and stimulate
  his memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember you used to drive an engine, don&rsquo;t you, Chick?&rdquo; asked
  Carleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Engine?&rdquo; Coogan nodded. &ldquo;Yes; in the Devil&rsquo;s Slide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;505,&rdquo; said Regan quickly. &ldquo;You know old 505.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coogan shook his head.</p>
  <p>Carleton tried another tack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were in a bad accident, Coogan, one night. You were in the cab
  of the engine when she went to smash. Do you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The smash was on the Devil&rsquo;s Slide,&rdquo; said Coogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; cried Carleton. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d
  remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always there,&rdquo; said Coogan simply, &ldquo;always
  there. It is a bad track. I&rsquo;m a railroad man and I know. It&rsquo;s
  not properly guarded. I&rsquo;m going to work there and take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Work there?&rdquo; said Regan, the tears almost in his eyes. &ldquo;What
  kind of work? What do you want to do, Chick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just work there,&rdquo; said Coogan. &ldquo;Take care of the Devil&rsquo;s
  Slide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The super and the master mechanic looked at each other&mdash;and averted
  their eyes. Then they took Coogan up to his boarding-house, where he had
  moved after Annie and the little one died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never put his finger on a throttle again,&rdquo; said
  Regan with a choke in his voice, as they came out. &ldquo;The best man that
  ever pulled a latch, the best man that ever drew a pay-check on the Hill
  Division. It&rsquo;s hell, Carleton, that&rsquo;s what it is. I don&rsquo;t
  think he really knew you or me. He don&rsquo;t seem to remember much of anything,
  though he&rsquo;s natural enough and able enough to take care of himself
  in all other ways. Just kind of simple-like. It&rsquo;s queer the way that
  Devil&rsquo;s Slide has got him, what? We can&rsquo;t let him go out there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if he remembers Annie,&rdquo; said Carleton. &ldquo;I was
  afraid to ask him. I didn&rsquo;t know what effect it might have. No; we
  can&rsquo;t let him go out on the Devil&rsquo;s Slide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the doctors said yes. They went further and said it was about the only
  chance he had. The thing was on his mind. It was better to humor him, and
  that, with the outdoor mountain life, in time might bring him around again.</p>
  <p>And so, while Regan growled and swore, and Carleton knitted his brows in
  perplexed protest, the doctors had their way&mdash;and Coogan, Chick Coogan,
  went to the Devil&rsquo;s Slide. Officially, he was on the pay-roll as a
  section hand; but Millrae, the section boss, had his own orders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let Coogan alone. Let him do what he likes, only see that he doesn&rsquo;t
  come to any harm,&rdquo; wired the super.</p>
  <p>And Coogan, when Millrae asked him what he wanted to do, answered simply: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to take care of the Devil&rsquo;s Slide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Chick,&rdquo; the section boss agreed cheerily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  up to you. Fire ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first no one understood, perhaps even at the end no one quite understood&mdash;possibly
  Coogan least of all. He may have done some good&mdash;or he may not. In time
  they came to call him the Guardian of the Devil&rsquo;s Slide&mdash;not slightingly,
  but as strong men talk, defiant of ridicule, with a gruff ring of assertion
  in their tones that brooked no question.</p>
  <p>Up and down, down and up, two miles east, two miles west, Coogan patroled
  the Devil&rsquo;s Slide, and never a weakened rail, a sunken tie, a loosened
  spike escaped him&mdash;he may have done some good, or he may not.</p>
  <p>He slept here and there in one of the switch-back tender&rsquo;s shanties,
  moved and governed by no other consideration than fatigue&mdash;day and night
  were as things apart. He ate with them, too; and scrupulously he paid his
  footing. Twenty-five cents for a meal, twenty-five cents for a bunk, or a
  blanket on the floor. They took his money because he forced it upon them,
  furiously angry at a hint of refusal; but mostly the coin would be slipped
  back unnoticed into the pocket of Coogan&rsquo;s coat&mdash;poor men and
  rough they were, nothing of veneer, nothing of polish, grimy, overalled,
  horny-fisted toilers, their hearts were big if their purses weren&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>At all hours, in the early dawn, at midday or late afternoon, the train
  crews and the engine crews on passengers, specials and freights, passed Coogan
  up and down, always walking with his head bent forward, his eyes fastened
  on the right of way&mdash;passed with a cheery hail and the flirt of a hand
  from cab, caboose, or the ornate tail of a garish Pullman. And to the tourists
  he came to be more of an attraction than the scenic grandeur of the Rockies
  themselves; they stared from the observation car and listened, with a running
  fire of wondering comment, as the brass-buttoned, swelled-with-importance,
  colored porters told the story, until at last to have done the Rockies and
  have missed the Guardian of the Devil&rsquo;s Slide was to have done them
  not at all. It was natural enough, anything out of the ordinary ministers
  to and arouses the public&rsquo;s curiosity. Not very nice perhaps, no&mdash;but
  natural. The railroad men didn&rsquo;t like it, and that was natural, too;
  but their feelings or opinions, in the very nature of things, had little
  effect one way or the other.</p>
  <p>Coogan grew neither better nor worse. The months passed, and he grew neither
  better nor worse. Winter came, and, with the trestle that went out in the
  big storm that year, Coogan went into Division for the last time, went over
  the Great Divide, the same simple, broken-minded Coogan that had begun his
  self-appointed task in the spring&mdash;he may have done some good, or he
  may not. They found him after two or three days, and sent him back to Big
  Cloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have chosen that himself if he could have chosen,&rdquo; said
  Carleton soberly. &ldquo;God knows what the end would have been. The years
  would have been all alike, he&rsquo;d never have got his mind back. It&rsquo;s
  all for the best, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan did not answer. Philosophy and the master mechanic&rsquo;s heart did
  not always measure things alike.</p>
  <p>The Brotherhood took charge of the arrangements, and Coogan&rsquo;s funeral
  was the biggest funeral Big Cloud ever had. Everybody wanted to march, so
  they held the service late in the afternoon and closed down the shops at
  half-past four: and the shop hands, from the boss fitter to the water boy,
  turned out to the last man&mdash;and so did every one else in town.</p>
  <p>It was getting dark and already supper time when it was over, but Carleton,
  who had left some unfinished work on his desk, went back to his office instead
  of going home. He lighted the lamp, put on the chimney, but the match was
  still burning between his fingers when the door opened and a man, with his
  hat pulled far down over his face, stepped in and closed it behind him.</p>
  <p>Carleton whirled around, the match dropped to the floor, and he leaned forward
  over his desk, a hard look settling on his face. The man had pushed back
  his hat. It was Dahleen, Coogan&rsquo;s fireman, Jim Dahleen.</p>
  <p>For a moment neither man spoke. Bitter words rose to Carleton&rsquo;s tongue,
  but something in the other&rsquo;s face checked and held them back. It was
  Dahleen who spoke first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard about Chick&mdash;that he&rsquo;d gone out,&rdquo; he said
  quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it did him any good, but I kind of
  had to chip in on the good-by&mdash;Chick and me used to be pretty thick.
  I saw you come down here and I followed you. Don&rsquo;t stare at me like
  that, you&rsquo;d have done the same. Have you got that flask yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carleton answered mechanically, and as mechanically
  produced it from the drawer of his desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever examine it particularly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Examine it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess that answers my question. I was afraid you might, and I wanted
  to ask you for it that day, only I thought you&rsquo;d think it mighty funny,
  refuse, and well&mdash;well, get to looking it over on your own hook. Will
  you give it here for a minute?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton handed it over silently.</p>
  <p>Dahleen took it, pulled off the lower half that served as drinking cup,
  laid his finger on the inside rim, and returned it to the super.</p>
  <p>Carleton moved nearer to the light&mdash;then his face paled. <i>It was
   Coogan&rsquo;s flask!</i> The inscription, a little dulled, in fine engraving,
   was still plain enough. &ldquo;To Chick from Jim, on the occasion of his
   wedding.&rdquo; Carleton&rsquo;s hand was trembling as he set it down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;It was Coogan who was drunk
  that night&mdash;not you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I figured that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;d read it, you or any other
  railroad man,&rdquo; said Dahleen. &ldquo;It was him or me and one of us
  drunk, in the eyes of any of the boys on the road, from the minute that flask
  showed up. There was only one thing would have made you believe different,
  and I couldn&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;then. I&rsquo;d have taken the same stand
  you did. But you&rsquo;re wrong. Coogan wasn&rsquo;t drunk that night&mdash;he
  never touched a drop. I wouldn&rsquo;t be telling you this now, if he had,
  would I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Carleton.</p>
  <p>Dahleen took the chair beside the desk, and resting his feet on the window-sill
  stared out at the lights twinkling below him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I gave him the flask,&rdquo; he said slowly, as though picking
  up the thread of a story, &ldquo;for a wedding present. The day he came
  back to his run after the little woman and the baby died he had it in his
  pocket, and he handed it to me. &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;m afraid of it, Jimmy</i>,&rsquo; he
  said. That was all, just that&mdash;only he <i>looked</i> at me. Then he
  got down out of the cab to oil round, me still holding it in my hand for
  the words kind of hit me&mdash;they meant a whole lot. Well, before he came
  back, I lifted up my seat and chucked it down in the box underneath. I don&rsquo;t
  want to make a long story of this. You know how he took to brooding. Sometimes
  he wouldn&rsquo;t say a word from one end of the run to the other. And once
  in a while he seemed to act a little queer. I didn&rsquo;t think much of
  it and I didn&rsquo;t say anything to anybody, figuring it would wear off.
  When we pulled out of Big Cloud the night of the wreck I didn&rsquo;t see
  anything out of the ordinary about him, I&rsquo;d kind of got used to him
  by then and if there was any difference I didn&rsquo;t notice it. He never
  said a word all the way out until we hit the summit of the Devil&rsquo;s
  Slide and started down. I had the fire-box door open and was throwing coal
  when he says so sudden as almost to make me drop my shovel:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jimmy, do you know what night this is?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; says I, never thinking, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Thursday.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He laughed kind of softlike to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my wedding night, Jimmy,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;My
  wedding night, and we&rsquo;re going to celebrate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The light from the fire-box was full on his face, and he had the
  queerest look you ever saw on a man. He was white and his eyes were staring
  and he was pushing his hand through his hair and rocking in his seat. I was
  scart. I thought for a minute he was going to faint, then I remembered that
  whisky and jumped for my side of the cab, opened the seat and snatched it
  up. I went back to him with it in my hand. I don&rsquo;t think he ever saw
  it&mdash;I know he didn&rsquo;t. He was laughing that soft laugh again, kind
  of as though he was crooning, and he reached out his hand and pushed me away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to celebrate, Jimmy,&rsquo; says he again. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
  going to celebrate. It&rsquo;s my wedding night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I felt the speed quicken a bit, we were on the Slide then, you know,
  and I saw his fingers tightening on the throttle. Then it got me, and my
  heart went into my mouth&mdash;Chick was clean off his head. I slipped the
  flask into my pocket, and tried to coax his hands away from the throttle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me take her a spell, Chick,&rsquo; says I, thinking my
  best chance was to humor him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He threw me off like I was a plaything. Then I tried to pull him
  away and he smashed me one between the eyes and sent me to the floor. All
  the time we was going faster and faster. I tackled him again, but I might
  as well have been a baby, and then&mdash;then&mdash;well, that wound in his
  head came from a long-handled union-wrench I grabbed out of the tool box.
  He went down like a felled ox&mdash;but it was too late. Before I could reach
  a lever we were in splinters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen stopped. Carleton never stirred, he was leaning forward, his elbows
  on his desk, his chin in his hands, his face strained, eyes intently fastened
  on the other.</p>
  <p>Dahleen fumbled a second with his watch chain, twisting it around his fingers,
  then he went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While I laid in the hospital I turned the thing over in my mind pretty
  often, long before the doctors thought I knew my own name again, and I figured
  that, if it was ever known, old Coogan was down and out for fair even if
  when he got better his head turned out all right again, because he wouldn&rsquo;t
  be ever trusted in a cab under any circumstances, you understand? If he didn&rsquo;t
  come out straight why that ended it, of course; but I had it in my mind that
  it was only what they call a temporary aberration. I couldn&rsquo;t queer
  him if that was all, could I? So I said to myself, &lsquo;Jimmy, all you
  know is that the &ldquo;air&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t work.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
  what I told you that day; and then you sprang that flask on me. You were
  right, I <i>had</i> forgotten it. Whisky in the cab on the night of an accident
  is pretty near an open and shut game. It was him or me, and I couldn&rsquo;t
  tell you the story then without doing Coogan cold, but Coogan&rsquo;s gone
  now and it can&rsquo;t hurt him. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tick of the clock on the wall, the click of the sounder from the dispatcher&rsquo;s
  room next door were the only sounds for a long minute, then Carleton&rsquo;s
  chair scraped and he stood up and put out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dahleen,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal
  to be as white a man as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dahleen shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any one would have done it for Coogan,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>There never was, and there isn&rsquo;t now, anything elusive about the Hill
  Division, unless you get to talking about the mileage&mdash;when you strike
  the mileage you strike deep water, and the way of it is this. Most things
  that are big and vital and enduring develop with the years to their own maturity,
  and with maturity comes perfection&mdash;as nearly as anything is perfect.
  When the last rail that proclaimed man&rsquo;s mastery of the Rockies and
  the Sierras an accomplished fact was spiked to the ties with much ceremony
  and more eclat, to say nothing of the somewhat wobbly and uncertain blows
  with which the silk-hatted, very-important-national-personage performed this
  crowning act, while the rough-and-readys whose toil and sweat and grime and
  blood had bought the miles the orators were eulogizing, being no longer of
  the elect, looked on from a respectful distance&mdash;when all this was done
  the Hill Division, even then, was no more than the rough draft of a masterpiece.</p>
  <p>In the years that followed came the pruning and the changes, the smoothing
  and the toning down&mdash;tunnels bored through the mountain-sides lessened
  the grades and lopped off winding miles around projecting spurs; trestles
  with long embankment approaches added their quota to this much-to-be-desired
  result; while in the foothills, instead of circling around and around, to
  the right and the left and the left and the right of an endless procession
  of buttes, the buttes themselves came to be bisected with mathematical precision.
  All told, many miles, very many miles, have been wiped out in this fashion&mdash;the
  elusive part of it is that, measured in the dollars and cents paid by the
  tourists for transportation and the shippers and consignees for freight hauls,
  the line is just as long as ever it was! And it would appear that a good
  deal of money had been spent with nothing to show for it; but then against
  this is the fact that the directors down East were never rated as imminent
  or near-imminent subjects for a lunacy commission. The mileage is elusive&mdash;let
  it go at that.</p>
  <p>For the rest, the right of way from Big Cloud, the divisional point, just
  East of the mighty blue-blurred, snow-capped range that towers to the skyline
  North and South&mdash;from there to the rolling, undulating country that
  reaches West from the base of the Sierras, the Hill Division is, without
  question, the most marvelous piece of track ever conceived by man, and it
  stands a perpetual and enduring monument to the brains and the genius, ay,
  and the manhood, too, of those who built it.</p>
  <p>Such is the Hill Division. You who know the Rockies know it for the grandeur
  of its scenery, know it for the glory of its conquest over obstacles seemingly
  insurmountable; but there is another side that you may not know, a side that
  the maps and plans and blueprints and the railroad folders and the windows
  of the observation cars, big as they are, do not show&mdash;and that side
  is the human side. It is full of tears and laughter, full of sorrow and joy,
  of dangers and death and mistakes and triumph&mdash;its history would fill
  many pages, but it is a history that will never be written, for the generals
  and the rank and file of its army have fought their battles without the blare
  of trumpets, have done their work and their duty as they saw it, simply and
  with few words, without thought of personal profit and, much less, of fame.
  They tell their own stories amongst themselves, and they hold in honor those
  entitled thereto&mdash;which is a meed beyond any recognition of governments
  or kings or principalities, because it is the tribute of man to man, without
  glamor and without pretense. If you are a man as they measure men, they will
  tell you the stories, too; and, if you care to smoke, they will offer you
  their black plugs with the heart-shaped tin tags that their favorite manufacturer
  imbeds therein and, further, they will hand you their clasp knives with which
  to slice it. If you are wise you will understand that you are honored above
  most men, and you will be becomingly humble and will listen. But if this,
  through circumstance and misfortune, has never been your lot, then, here
  and there, inadequately and meagerly, you may run across, in print, a stray
  breath from the Hill Division&mdash;this is a case in print&mdash;the story
  of &ldquo;King&rdquo; Gilleen.</p>
  <p>Gilleen was a man you would never pass in a crowd without turning your head
  to look at him a second time, not even in a big crowd, for nature had dealt
  with Gilleen generously&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;whichever way it pleases
  you best to consider it. He had red hair of a shade that might be classified
  as brilliant, but which Regan, the master mechanic, described in metaphor.
  Said Regan: &ldquo;You could see that head a mile away on the other side
  of a curve in a blizzard at night when he pokes it out of the cab window.
  You&rsquo;ll never get Gilleen on the carpet because his headlight&rsquo;s
  out, what?&rdquo; Certainly, at any rate, Gilleen&rsquo;s hair was undeniably
  red. He had blue eyes, and a very small nose which, for all that, was, next
  to his hair, the most prominent feature he possessed&mdash;small noses with
  a slight up-cant to the tip <i>are</i> pronounced, mere size to the contrary.
  His face was freckled and so were his hands; also, he was no small chunk
  of a man, not so very tall, but the shoulders on him were something to envy
  if you were friendly with him, or to respect if you were not. That was Gilleen,
  all except the fact that he admitted with emphasis to the blood of some wild
  Irish race of kings coursing through his veins. This last point was never
  established&mdash;every one took Gilleen&rsquo;s word for it, that is every
  one but Regan, who was Irish himself and, more pertinent still, Gilleen&rsquo;s
  direct superior. On this point Regan, who was never averse to doing it, could
  get a rise out of Gilleen quicker than the bite of a hungry trout.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Christmas,&rdquo; Gilleen would sputter on such occasions, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  have you know I&rsquo;m no liar, an&rsquo; if &rsquo;twere not for the missus
  an&rsquo; the six kids&rdquo;&mdash;here Gilleen would always stop to count,
  owing to a possible arrival since the last clash, realizing that any slip
  would be instantly and mercilessly turned against him by the grinning master
  mechanic&mdash;&ldquo;if &rsquo;twere not for them, Regan, you listen to me,
  I&rsquo;d bash your face an&rsquo; then ram the measly job you give me down
  your throat, I would that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Regan would return, &ldquo;when you get to sitting
  on a dinky, gilded throne, sunk to the crown-sheet in the bogs though it
  will be, I&rsquo;d ask no more nor as much from your hands as you get from
  mine&mdash;which is more than your deserts. Who but me would do as much for
  you? You ought to be back wiping. I&rsquo;ve thought some seriously of it,
  h&rsquo;m? Six, is it now?&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a grand race!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon Gilleen would say hot words and say them fervently, while he shook
  his fist at the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you some day, Regan,&rdquo; was his final word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  show you what kind of a race it is, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All of which is neither very interesting nor in any degree witty&mdash;it
  simply shows where Gilleen&rsquo;s nickname came from. Everybody on the division
  called him &ldquo;King&rdquo;&mdash;not to his face, they do now, but they
  didn&rsquo;t then. Queer the way a little thing like that acts on a man sometimes.
  Gilleen was well enough liked in a way, but no one ever really took him seriously
  in anything. Associate a man with a joke and henceforward and forever after,
  usually, the two are inseparable. He may have aspirations, ambitions, what
  you will, but he is given no credit for having them&mdash;with Gilleen it
  was that way. Just Gilleen, &ldquo;King&rdquo; Gilleen&mdash;and a grin.</p>
  <p>The Lord only knows what possessed Gilleen to adhere with such stout-hearted
  loyalty to his ancestors&mdash;you may put an interrogation mark after that
  last word, if you like&mdash;it began with perhaps no more than a boyish
  boast when his official connection with the system was no further advanced
  than to the degree of holding down the job of assistant boiler-washer in
  the roundhouse. The more they guyed him the more stubbornly he stuck&mdash;it
  was a matter worth fighting for, and Gilleen fought. He threw pounds, reach,
  and other advantages to the winds and took on anybody and everybody. By the
  time he had moved up to firing he had fought all who cared to fight, who
  were not a few; and when, following that in the due course of promotion,
  he got his engine, he had by blows, not argument, established his assertion
  outwardly at least. At a safe distance the division, remembering broken noses
  and missing teeth and no longer denying him his royal blood, gave him his
  way, smiled tolerantly in self-solace and called him &ldquo;nutty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan, of course, still guyed&mdash;but Regan was master mechanic. Not that
  he did it by virtue of the immunity his official position afforded him, he
  never gave that a thought. He did it because he was Regan, and Regan was
  built that way. He could no more forego the chance of a laugh or an inward
  chuckle than he could forego the act of breathing&mdash;and live. A joke
  was a joke, just fun with him, that was all.</p>
  <p>But with Gilleen it was different. Being unable to use his fists as was
  his wont, and being possessed of no other safety-valve, the pressure mounted
  steadily until it registered a point on his mental gauge that spoke eloquently
  of trouble to come.</p>
  <p>And so matters stood when, following a rather dull summer, the fall business
  opened with a rush and a roar. Things moved with a jump, and the rails hummed
  under a constant stream of traffic east and west. Here, at least, was no
  joke&mdash;a rush on the Hill Division, single-track, through the mountains,
  never was. A month of it, and every one from car-tink to superintendent began
  to show the effects of the strain. It was double up everywhere, extra duty,
  extra tricks. The dispatchers caught their share of it and their eyes grew
  red and heavy under the lamps at night, and the heads of the day-men ached
  as they figured a series of meeting points that had no beginning and no end;
  but, bad as it was for the men on the keys, it was worse for some of those
  in the cabs. Schedulers went to smash. Perishables and flyers were given
  the best of it&mdash;the rights of the rest were the sidings. It was a case
  of crawl along, sneak from one to the other, with layout after layout, until
  the ordinary length of a day&rsquo;s duty lapped over into fifteen-hour stretches
  and sometimes to twenty-four. Sleep, what they could get of it, the engine
  crews snatched bolt upright in their seats while they waited for Number One&rsquo;s
  headlight to shoot streaming out of the East, or nodded until roused by the
  roar and thunder of a flying freight, cars and cars of it crammed with first-class
  ratings, streaking East, as it hurtled by with insolent disregard for every
  mortal thing on earth.</p>
  <p>Maybe Gilleen got a little more of it than any one else on the throttles,
  maybe he did&mdash;or maybe he didn&rsquo;t. Gilleen thought he did anyhow,
  and naturally he put it down to Regan&rsquo;s account. Regan was head of
  the motive power department of the Hill Division&mdash;there was no one else <i>to</i> put
  it down to. It was Regan or imagination. Gilleen, not being strong on imagination,
  did not debate the question&mdash;he let it go at Regan.</p>
  <p>In from one run, shot out on another&mdash;that was Gilleen&rsquo;s schedule.
  The little woman in the little house uptown off Main street got to be mostly
  a memory to Gilleen, and as for the six brick-headed scions of his kingly
  race he came to wonder if they really existed at all.</p>
  <p>Things boomed and hummed on the Hill Division, and while everybody on it
  snarled and swore and nagged at each other, as weary, worn-out, dropping-with-fatigue
  men will do, the smiles broadened on the lips and spread over the faces of
  the directors down East, as they rubbed their palms beneficently, expectantly,
  scenting extra dividends and soaring stock.</p>
  <p>It was noon one day when Gilleen, with a trailing string of slewing freights
  behind him, pulled into the Big Cloud yards, uncoupled, backed down the spur,
  crossed the &rsquo;table, and ran into the roundhouse. As he swung from the
  gangway, Regan came hurrying in through the engine doors of Gilleen&rsquo;s
  pit from the direction of headquarters, and walked up to the engineer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilleen,&rdquo; said he briskly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to take
  out Special Eighty-three. 1603&rsquo;s ready with a full head on pit two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; snapped Gilleen. &ldquo;Take out a special <i>now?</i> You
  know damn well I&rsquo;m just in from a run. I&rsquo;m tired. You&rsquo;ll
  rub it in once too often, Regan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all tired, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; returned the master
  mechanic tartly. &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re the only one? As for rubbing
  it in, you&rsquo;d better draw your fire, my bucko. There&rsquo;s no rubbing
  in being done except in your eye! Anyhow, that&rsquo;s enough talk. Special
  Eighty-three&rsquo;s carded on rush orders from down East, and she&rsquo;s
  been in here an hour now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you let the crew that brought her in keep
  goin&rsquo; then?&rdquo; snarled Gilleen. It was a fool question and he knew
  it; but, as he had said, he was tired, and his temper, never angelic, was
  now pretty well on edge.</p>
  <p>Regan glared at him a moment angrily. Regan, too, was tired and irritable,
  harassed beyond the limit that most men are harassed. The demand upon the
  motive power department for men and engines had kept him up more than one
  night trying to figure out a problem that was well-nigh impossible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go on!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;You know well enough
  I haven&rsquo;t anything on the Prairie Division men. You know that&mdash;what
  d&rsquo;ye say it for, h&rsquo;m? You&rsquo;re the first man in&mdash;and
  you go out first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It strikes me I&rsquo;m <i>generally</i> the first man in these days,&rdquo; retorted
  Gilleen angrily; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sick of gettin&rsquo; the short
  end of it. I guess I won&rsquo;t go out this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took a breathing spell before the master mechanic could explode adequately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You call yourself a railroad man!&rdquo; he flung out furiously. &ldquo;What
  are you whining about? Every man&rsquo;s got his shoulder to the wheel and
  pushing without talk. We haven&rsquo;t got any room here for quitters. I
  guess that blood of yours you&rsquo;re so pinhead-brained proud&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan did not finish. With a bellow of rage the red-haired engineer went
  at the other like a charging bull, and the master mechanic promptly measured
  his length on the roundhouse floor from a wallop on the head that made him
  see stars.</p>
  <p>Regan scrambled to his feet. His heart was the heart of a fighter, even
  if his build was not. Straight at Gilleen he flew, and the passes and lunges
  and jabs he made&mdash;while the engineer played on the master mechanic&rsquo;s
  paunch like a kettle-drum and delivered a second wallop on the head as a
  plaster for the first&mdash;are historic only for their infinitesimal coefficient
  of effectiveness. It is unquestionably certain that the master mechanic then
  and there would have proceeded to make up for some of his lost sleep, at
  least, if Gilleen&rsquo;s fireman and a wiper or two hadn&rsquo;t got in
  between the two men just when they did.</p>
  <p>Gilleen was boiling mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he bawled, &ldquo;got anything more to say about quittin&rsquo; or
  that other thing? I guess I won&rsquo;t go out this time, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan was equally mad. And as he felt tenderly of his forehead, where a
  lump was rapidly approximating the formation of a goose egg, he grew madder
  still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go out, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Well <i>I</i> guess
  you will; and, what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll go out <i>now</i>&mdash;and
  get your time! I fire you, understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet!&rsquo;&rdquo; said &ldquo;King&rdquo; Gilleen&mdash;and
  that&rsquo;s all he said. He looked at the master mechanic for a minute,
  but didn&rsquo;t <i>say</i> anything more&mdash;just laughed and walked out
  of the roundhouse.</p>
  <p>Naturally enough, the story got up and down the division, and everybody
  talked about it. With their rough and impartial justice they put both men
  in the wrong, but mostly Gilleen for insubordination. The affront Gilleen
  had suffered was not so big and momentous, a long way from being the vital
  thing in their eyes that it was in his. Gilleen was just nutty on that point,
  that was all there was to that. Regan&rsquo;s judgment had been bad and the
  moment he had seized for his thrust and fling was by no manner of means a
  psychological one; but, for all that, Gilleen had no business to strike the
  master mechanic. He had got what was coming to him&mdash;that was the verdict.
  He was out and out for good. It was pretty generally conceded that it would
  be a long while before he pulled a throttle on the Hill Division again.</p>
  <p>What sympathy the engineer got, for he got some, wasn&rsquo;t on his own
  account. It was on account of his family&mdash;not the ancestral end of it,
  however. Six kids and a wife do not leave much change out of a paycheck even
  when it&rsquo;s padded by overtime; six kids and a wife with no pay-check
  is pretty stiff running.</p>
  <p>Gilleen was too hot under the collar to give a thought to that when he marched
  out of the roundhouse that noon; but it wasn&rsquo;t many hours, after he
  had put in a few to make up for the sleep he hadn&rsquo;t had during the
  preceding weeks, that the problem was up to him for consideration with a
  vote for adjournment for once ruled out as not in order.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Gilleen may or may not have shared her spouse&rsquo;s opinions on the
  subject of his illustrious descent&mdash;if she did she never put on any &ldquo;airs&rdquo; about
  it. Washing and dressing and cooking was about all one woman could manage
  for a household as big as hers. That&rsquo;s what she said anyway, whenever
  any one asked her about it. And one glance at the red-headed brood that filled
  the front yard and swung on the front gate, whose hinges creaked in loud
  and bitter protest, was enough to preclude any dispute on that score. Just
  a little bit of a woman she was physically; but bigger practically than the
  whole corps of leading lights in social and domestic economy&mdash;which,
  come to think of it, is damning Mrs. Gilleen with faint praise, whereas too
  much couldn&rsquo;t be said for her. However, let that go. Mrs. Gilleen <i>was</i> practical,
  and she had the matter up to the engineer almost before he had the sleep
  washed out of his eyes. No nagging, no reproach, nothing of that kind&mdash;Mrs.
  Gilleen wasn&rsquo;t that sort of a woman. &ldquo;King,&rdquo; or not, Gilleen
  might have been, Katie Gilleen was a <i>queen</i>, not in looks perhaps,
  but a queen&mdash;that&rsquo;s flat. A fine woman is the finest thing in
  the world, and if that were said a little more often than it is maybe things
  generally wouldn&rsquo;t be any the worse for it&mdash;which is not a plank
  in the platform of the Suffragettes, though it may sound like it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you rowed with Mr. Regan, and he
  fired you. Will he take you back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gilleen lowered the towel to his chin to catch the dripping water from his
  hair&mdash;he had just buried his head in the washbowl the minute before&mdash;and
  looked at his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>ask</i> him, Kate,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Gilleen was proud, too&mdash;but for all that she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will you do, then, Michael?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno yet, little woman. Some of the others will give me a job,
  I guess. Mabbe I&rsquo;ll try the train crews. I&rsquo;ll hit &rsquo;em up
  for something, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s ever so much less money in that&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
  Gilleen&rsquo;s tones were judicial, not plaintive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned Gilleen; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;ll tide us
  over an&rsquo; keep the steam up till we get a chance to pull out for somewheres
  where a man can get an engine without a grinning fool of a master mechanic
  to doublecross him with the worst of it every chance he gets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope it will all come out right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gilleen, a little
  wistfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; Gilleen assured her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry.
  I&rsquo;ll get after a job right away as soon as I&rsquo;ve had a bite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It came easier even than Gilleen had figured it would&mdash;such as it was&mdash;and
  it was about the last job Gilleen had thought of as a possibility. Things
  have a peculiar way of working themselves out sometimes, and, curiously enough,
  by means which, on the surface, are, more often than not, apparently trivial
  and inconsequent. Certainly, if Gilleen, on his way to the station that morning,
  had not run into Gleason, the yard-master, why then&mdash;but he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call-boys kind of scarce around your diggin&rsquo;s since yesterday,
  ain&rsquo;t they, Gilleen?&rdquo; was Gleason&rsquo;s greeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gilleen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See you&rsquo;re headin&rsquo; for the station,&rdquo; remarked Gleason
  tentatively. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; down to patch it up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Gilleen with a hard ring in his voice&mdash;the &ldquo;no&rdquo; was
  emphatic.</p>
  <p>Gleason stared at the engineer for a minute, then took a bite from his plug,
  and the motion of his head might have been a nod of understanding or merely
  a wrench or two to free his teeth from the black-strap in which they were
  imbedded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gilleen again; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; down
  for another job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What kind of a job?&rdquo; inquired Gleason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any kind from any one that will put me on&mdash;except Regan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gleason thought of his choked yards&mdash;the rush had in no way overlooked
  him. Men, men that knew a draw-bar and a switch-handle from a hunk of cheese,
  were as scarce in his department as they were in any of the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yards?&rdquo; he queried&mdash;and blinked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean it?&rdquo; demanded Gilleen, taking him up short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I mean it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; said Gilleen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Night switchman,&rdquo; amplified
  the yard-master. &ldquo;You can begin to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll be on deck,&rdquo; agreed Gilleen; &ldquo;an&rsquo; thanks,
  Gleason. I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Gleason. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much of
  a stake compared with an engine, but it&rsquo;s yours, an&rsquo; welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was quite true. Comparatively, it wasn&rsquo;t much of a stake, and even
  the first night of it was enough to throw the comparison into strong and
  bitter relief. If anything would have put a finishing touch on Gilleen&rsquo;s
  feelings anent the master mechanic it was that first night on yard switching,
  that and, of course, the nights that followed. It wasn&rsquo;t so much the
  work, though that was hard enough, and, being green, the engineer made about
  twice as much for himself as there was any need of, it was a not-to-be-denied
  tendency of his eyes to stray toward the roundhouse every time a gleaming
  headlight showed on the turn-table. If Gilleen had never known before how
  much he loved an engine he knew it in those dark hours while he swung a lantern
  from the roofs of a freight string, or hopped the foot-board of the switcher.
  Up and down the yards from dusk till dawn, to the accompaniment of the wheezing,
  grunting, coughing, foreshortened apology for a shunter, the clash of brake-beams,
  the bump and rattle, staccato, diminuendo, as a line of box-cars grumbled
  into motion, didn&rsquo;t take on any roseate hues from the angle Gilleen
  looked at it; nor did an occasional ten-wheeler, out or in, sailing grandly
  past him with impudent airs help any, either. Gilleen&rsquo;s language became
  as freckled as his face and hands and as fiery as his head. Even that grand
  old Irish race from which he sprang, that wild and untamed breed of kingly
  sires paled into insignificance&mdash;Gilleen was more occupied with Regan.
  What he thought he said, and said it aloud without making any bones about
  it&mdash;said it through his teeth, with his fists clenched.</p>
  <p>Perhaps it was just as well Gilleen was on nights, for, ordinarily, the
  master mechanic had nothing to bring him around the yards, shops or roundhouse
  after sundown&mdash;Regan&rsquo;s evenings being spent with Carleton, the
  super, a pipe and a game of pedro upstairs over the station in the superintendent&rsquo;s
  office next door to the dispatcher&rsquo;s room&mdash;just as well for both
  their sakes; for Regan&rsquo;s physically; for Gilleen&rsquo;s because, little
  fond of his job as he was, there, were certain necessities that even little
  Mrs. Gilleen with all her practicability and economy could not supply without
  money. Anyway, the days went by and the two men did not meet, though Gilleen&rsquo;s
  orations got around to Regan&rsquo;s ears fast enough. The master mechanic
  only laughed when he heard them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilleen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is like the parrot that said &lsquo;sic &rsquo;em!&rsquo; and
  said it once too often. He talks too much. If he&rsquo;d kept his mouth shut
  I&rsquo;d have given him his run back, after a lay off to teach him manners.
  As it is, if he likes switching let him keep at it. Mabbe by the time he&rsquo;s
  tired the throne of his ancestors &rsquo;ll be ready for him, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this was enough to spell ructions in the air, and, ordinarily, the division
  to a man would have hung mildly expectant on the result of the final showdown.
  But the Hill Division just then wasn&rsquo;t hankering for anything more
  to liven it up&mdash;it was getting all of that sort of thing it wanted and
  a little besides. Attending strictly to business was about all it could do,
  a trifle beyond what it could do, and everything else was apart&mdash;the
  boom showed more signs of increasing than it did of being on the wane. There
  wasn&rsquo;t any let-up anywhere&mdash;things sizzled.</p>
  <p>It never rains but it pours, they say; and that&rsquo;s one adage, at least,
  that the railroad men of Big Cloud, and the town itself for that matter,
  will swear by to this day. There are a few things that Big Cloud remembers
  vividly and with astounding minuteness for detail, but the night the shops
  went up tops them all.</p>
  <p>When it was all over they decided that a slumbering forge-fire in the blacksmith
  shop was at the bottom of it&mdash;not that any one really knew, or knows
  now, but they put it down to that because it sounded reasonable and because
  there wasn&rsquo;t anything else <i>to</i> put it down to. However, whether
  that was the cause or whether it wasn&rsquo;t, on one point there was no
  possible opening for an argument&mdash;and that was the effect and the result.</p>
  <p>If you knew Big Cloud in the old days, you know where the shops were and
  what they looked like; if you didn&rsquo;t, it won&rsquo;t take a minute
  to tell you. You could see them from the station platform across the tracks
  far up at the west end of the yards; and they looked more like a succession
  of barns nailed on to each other than anything else, except for the roofs
  which were low and flat&mdash;the buildings being all one-storied. What with
  the quarters of the boiler-makers, the carpenters, the machinists and the
  fitters, the old shops straggled out over a goodly length of ground, and
  a grimy, ramshackle, dirty, blackened, Godforsaken looking structure it was.
  To-day, thanks to that fire and the Big Strike when it came along, there&rsquo;s
  a modern affair of structural steel&mdash;and the rest is but a memory. However&mdash;</p>
  <p>Night in the mountains in the Fall comes early, and by nine o&rsquo;clock
  on the night the fire broke out it had shut down pitch dark. Nothing showed
  in the yards but the twinkling switch lights, the waving lamps of the men,
  and an occasional gleam from the shunter&rsquo;s headlight when it shot away
  from the end of a boxcar. Across the tracks the station lights were like
  fireflies, and there was a glimmer or two showing from the roundhouse. Apart
  from the fact that a pretty strong west wind was brushing the yards, if you
  could count that as anything apart, there was nothing out of the ordinary,
  everything was going on as usual, when, suddenly without warning, a wicked
  fang of flame shot skyward, then another higher than the first. It was answered
  by a yell from the yardmen, caught up in the roundhouse, and then the switcher&rsquo;s
  whistle shrieked the alarm. A minute more, and everything with steam enough
  to lift a valve joined in. Dark forms began to run in the direction of the
  shops, and then the bell in the little English chapel uptown took a hand
  in the clamor. The alarm was unanimous enough and general enough when it
  came, there was never any doubt about that, but the fire must have got a
  pretty stiff start before it broke through the windows to fling its first
  challenge at the railroad men.</p>
  <p>Gilleen and the rest of the yard crew were on the run for the scene when
  Gleason&rsquo;s voice, bawling over the din, halted them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clean out three, four an&rsquo; five, an&rsquo; get &rsquo;em down
  to the bottom of the yards, an&rsquo; look lively!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Leave
  that string of gondolas on six till the last. Jump now, boys! Eat &rsquo;em
  up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oil-spattered floors and oil-smeared walls are a feeding ground for a fire
  than which there is no better. The flame tongues leaped higher and higher
  throwing a lurid glare down the yards, and throwing, too, as the wind caught
  them up and whirled them in gusts, a driving rain of sparks that threatened
  the long, dark lines of rolling stock, for the most part choked to the doors
  with freight&mdash;freight enough to total a sum in claim-checks that would
  blanch the cheeks of the most florid director on the board of the Transcontinental.</p>
  <p>With Gleason in command, Gilleen and his mates went at their work heads
  down. There wasn&rsquo;t anything fancy or artistic about the way they banged
  those cars to safety&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t time to be fussy. Behind them
  the south end of the shops was already a blazing mass. The little switcher
  took hold of first one string then another, shook it angrily for a minute
  as her exhaust roared into a quick crackle of reports and the drivers spun
  around like pin-wheels making the steel fly fire, then with a cough and a
  grunt and a final push she would snap the cars away from her, and the string
  would go sailing down the yard to bump and pound to a stop, with an echoing
  crash, into whatever might be at the other end. There was a car or two the
  next morning with front-ends and rear-ends and both ends at once, that looked
  as though they had been in a cyclone; and there was a claim-voucher or two
  put through for a consignment of nursing bottles and a sewing machine&mdash;not
  that the two necessarily go together, but no matter, they did then. Anyway,
  the record the yardmen made that night is the record today, and in no more
  than ten minutes there wasn&rsquo;t a car within three hundred yards of the
  shops.</p>
  <p>But while the yard crew worked others were not idle. Regan and Carleton,
  both of them, had caught the first flash from the windows of the super&rsquo;s
  room, and they were down the stairs, across the yards and into the game from
  the start. Joined by the nightmen and the hostlers and the wide-eyed call-boys
  they tackled the blaze. By the time they had dragged and coupled the fifty-foot
  hose lengths, it took five lengths, along the tracks from the roundhouse,
  the needle on the stationary&rsquo;s gauge, luckily not yet quite dead from
  the day&rsquo;s work and whose fire-box Clarihue, the turner, now crammed
  with oil-soaked packing, began to climb, and they got an uncertain, weakly
  stream playing&mdash;uncertain, but a stream. After that, things went with
  a rush&mdash;both ways&mdash;the fire and the fight.</p>
  <p>From the gambling hells and the saloons, from the streets and their homes
  came the population of Big Cloud, the Polacks, the Russians, the railroad
  men, the good and the bad whites, the half-breeds&mdash;and the local fire
  brigade. Two more streams they ran from the roundhouse and that was the limit&mdash;the
  rest of the hose was liquid rubber somewhere under the blaze.</p>
  <p>Regan, with a bitter, hard look on his face for the shops were Regan&rsquo;s,
  was everywhere at once, and what man could do he did; but, inch by inch,
  the flames were getting the better of him. The yards were as bright as day
  now, and the heat was driving the circle of fighters back, stubbornly as
  they fought to hold their ground. It looked like a grand slam for the fire
  with the four aces in one hand. Twice Regan had been on the point of ordering
  the men to the roof, and twice he held back&mdash;once he had even ordered
  a ladder planted, only to order it away again. The building was only wood,
  and old, and the roof was none too strong at best; but now, under and supported
  by the roof of the fitting-shop, put in a month before in lieu of the old
  system of jacking and blocking by hand, making the risk a hundredfold greater,
  were the heavy steel girders and hydraulic traveling cranes that whipped
  the big moguls like jack-straws from their wheels preparatory to stripping
  them to their bare boiler-shells. Regan shook his head&mdash;it was asking
  a man to take his life in his hands. For the moment he stood a little apart
  in front of the crowd and just behind the nozzle end of one of the streams.
  Again he measured the chances, and again he shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask a man to do it,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;but
  we ought to have a stream up there, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take it there yourself, then?&rdquo;&mdash;the
  words came sharp and quick from his elbow, stinging hot like the cut of a
  whip-lash. It was &ldquo;King&rdquo; Gilleen, red-haired, blue-blooded, freckled-skinned
  Gilleen.</p>
  <p>The master mechanic whirled like a shot, and for a minute the two men stared
  into each other&rsquo;s eyes, stared as the leaping flames sent flickering
  shadows across the grim, set features of them both, stared at each other
  face to face for the first time since that noon in the roundhouse days before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take it there yourself, then?&rdquo; said Gilleen
  again, and his laugh rang hard and cold. &ldquo;<i>You</i> ain&rsquo;t a
  quitter, are you? There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; wrong with <i>your</i> blood,
  is there? If you&rsquo;re not afraid&mdash;come on!&rdquo;&mdash;as he spoke
  he stepped forward, pushed the men from the nozzle&mdash;and looked back
  at the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>Regan&rsquo;s lips were like a thin, white line.</p>
  <p>Gilleen laughed out again, and it carried over the roar and the crackle
  of the flames, the snapping timbers, the hiss and spit of the water, the
  voices of the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put up the ladder!&rdquo;&mdash;it was Regan&rsquo;s voice, deadly
  cold. &ldquo;Lash a short end around that nozzle, an&rsquo; stand by to pass
  it up&rdquo;&mdash;he was at the foot of the ladder almost before they got
  it in position, and the next instant began to climb.</p>
  <p>Like a flash, Gilleen, surrendering the fire-hose temporarily, sprang after
  him&mdash;and up.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t far&mdash;the shops were low, just one story high&mdash;and
  both men were on the roof in a minute. Gilleen caught the coiled rope they
  slung him from below, and together he and the master mechanic hauled up the
  writhing, spluttering hose.</p>
  <p>A shower of sparks and a swirling cloud of smoke enveloped them as they
  stood upright and began to advance. It cleared away leaving them silhouetted
  against the leaping wall of flame a few yards in front of them&mdash;and
  a cheer went up from the throats of the crowd below.</p>
  <p>Not a word passed between the two men. Foot by foot they moved forward,
  laying the hose in a line behind them to lessen the weight and the side-pull,
  that at first had called forth all their strength to direct the play of the
  stream; foot by foot they went forward, closer and closer, perilously close,
  to the blistering, scorching, seething mass&mdash;for neither of them would
  be the first to hold back.</p>
  <p>High into the heavens streamed the great yellow-red forks of angry flame,
  and over all, like a gigantic canopy, rolled dense volumes of gray-black
  smoke. Came at the two men spurting, fiery tongues, stabbing at them, robbing
  them of their breath, mocking at their puny might.</p>
  <p>Another step forward and Regan reeled back, one hand went to his face&mdash;and
  the nozzle almost wrenched itself from the engineer&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand race!&rdquo; laughed Gilleen, but the laugh was
  more of a gasping cough, and the cough came from cracked and swollen lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a grand race, Regan; an&rsquo; the blood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a choking sob, Regan steadied himself and seized hold of the nozzle
  again.</p>
  <p>They held where they were now&mdash;it was the fire, not they, that was
  creeping forward, pitilessly, inevitably, licking greedily at the tarred
  roof until it grew soft beneath their feet and the bubbles puffed up and
  formed and broke.</p>
  <p>A cry of warning came from below, and with it came the ominous rending groan
  of yielding timbers. It came again, the cry, and rang in Gilleen&rsquo;s
  ears almost without sense. He could scarcely see, his eyes were scorched
  and blinded, his lungs were full of the stinging smoke, choking full. Beside
  him Regan hung, dropping weak. &ldquo;Get back, for God&rsquo;s sake, get
  back!&rdquo;&mdash;it was Carleton&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Do you hear!&rdquo; shouted
  the super frantically. &ldquo;Get back! The roof is sagging! Run for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like the roar of a giant blast, as a park of artillery belches forth in
  deafening thunder, there came a terrific crash and, fearful in its echo,
  a cry of horror rose from those below. Where there had been roof a foot in
  front of the men was now&mdash;nothingness.</p>
  <p>Gilleen, with a shout, as he felt the edge crumple under him, flung himself
  backward and as he leaped he snatched at Regan. His fingers brushed the master
  mechanic&rsquo;s sleeve, hooked, slipped&mdash;and he struck on his back
  a full yard away. He reeled to his feet like a drunken man, and dug at his
  eyes with his fists. Over the broken edge of the shattered roof, hanging
  into the black below, was the dangling hose&mdash;but Regan was gone. Weak,
  spent, exhausted, the master mechanic, unequal to the exertion of Gilleen&rsquo;s
  leap, had pitched downward, clutching desperately, feebly, vainly, as he
  went. Regan was gone, and twenty feet, somewhere, below&mdash;he lay.</p>
  <p>Gilleen staggered forward. It was the far end of the beams that had given
  away and the six or seven yards of the roof that had fallen still separated
  him from the heart of the blaze. The advancing flames lighted up a scene
  of wreck and ruin below in the fitting-shop&mdash;girders and steel Ts and
  cranes and tackles, splotches of roofing, shattered timbers, lay over the
  black looming shapes of the monster engine-shells blocked on the pit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Regan!&rdquo; he called; and again: &ldquo;Regan! <i>Regan!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Above the roaring crackle of the fire, above the surging, pounding noises
  that beat mercilessly at his eardrums, faint, so faint it seemed like fancy,
  a low moan answered him. Once more it came and upon Gilleen surged new-born
  strength and life. He began to drag at the hose with all his might, dropping
  it foot by fool over the jagged edge of the roof until it reached well down
  to the snarled and tangled wreckage below. And then a mighty yell went up
  from a hundred throats&mdash;and again and again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilleen! King Gilleen! King! <i>King!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no gibe now&mdash;just a bursting cheer from the full hearts of
  men. &ldquo;King!&rdquo; they roared, and the shout swelled, but Gilleen
  never heard them as they crowned him. King he was at last in the eyes of
  all men, a king that knows no blood nor race nor throne nor retinue&mdash;Gilleen
  was lowering himself down the hose.</p>
  <p>It was a question of minutes. The fire was sweeping in a mad wave across
  the intervening space. The engineer&rsquo;s feet touched something solid
  and he let go his hold of the hose&mdash;and stumbled, lost his balance,
  and pitched forward striking on his head with a blow that dazed and stunned
  him. Mechanically he understood that what he had taken for flooring was a
  workbench. He got to his feet again, the blood streaming from his forehead,
  and shouted. This time there was no answer. Staggering, falling, tripping,
  stumbling, he began to search frantically amid the debris. The air was thick
  with the smothering smoke, hot, stifling, drying up his lungs. He began to
  moan, crying the name of the master mechanic over and over again, crying
  it as a man cries out in delirium. Bits of oil-soaked waste and wads of packing,
  catching from the glowing cinders, were blazing around his feet, the onrush
  of the flames swept a blighting wave upon him that sent him reeling back,
  scorching, blistering the naked skin of his face and hands. Again he fell.
  A great sheet of fire leapt high behind him, held for an instant, and then
  the dull red glow settled around him again&mdash;but in that instant, just
  a little to the right, pinned under a scanling, half hidden by a snarled
  knot of roof and girders, was the master mechanic&rsquo;s form.</p>
  <p>On his knees, groping with his hands, Gilleen reached him, and began to
  tear furiously, savagely, madly, at the timber that lay across Regan&rsquo;s
  chest. He moved it little by little, every inch tasking his weakening muscles
  to the utmost. Blackness was before him, he could no longer see, he could
  no longer breathe, hot, nauseating fumes strangled him and sent the blood
  bursting from his nostrils. He tried to lift Regan&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;and
  sank down beside the master mechanic instead. Feebly he raised his head&mdash;there
  came the splintering crash of glass, a rushing stream tore through a window,
  hissed against the boiler-shell above him, and, glancing off, lashed a cold
  spray of water into his face.</p>
  <p>The window! Three yards to the window! He was up again, and pulling at the
  dead weight of the master mechanic. Just three yards! He cried like a child
  as he struggled, and the tears ran down his cheeks in streams. A foot, two
  feet, three&mdash;<i>two more yards to go</i>. Axes were swinging now in
  front of him, shouts reached him. Half the distance was covered&mdash;but
  he had gone to his knees. Everything around was hot, it was all fire and
  hell and madness. A yard and a half&mdash;only a yard and a half. Alone he
  could make it easily enough and maybe Regan was dead anyhow, alone and there
  was safety and life, alone&mdash;then he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand
  race, Regan, a grand race,&rdquo; he sobbed hysterically, and his grip tightened
  on the master mechanic, and he won another foot and another and another.
  A black form wavered before him, he felt an arm reach out and grasp him&mdash;then
  he tottered, swayed, and dropped inert, unconscious.</p>
  <p>They got him out, and they got Regan out, and they got the fire out by the
  time there wasn&rsquo;t much left to burn; and, after a week or two, both
  men got out of the hospital. That&rsquo;s about all there is to it, except
  that Gilleen&rsquo;s red head now decorates the swellest cab on the division,
  and that he never fought for his title after that night&mdash;he never had
  to; though, if you feel like questioning it, you can still get plenty of
  fight, for all that&mdash;any of the boys will accommodate you any time.</p>
  <p>Regan isn&rsquo;t an artist as a pugilist, but even so it is unwise to take
  risks&mdash;unscientific men by lucky flukes have handed knockouts to their
  betters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If Gilleen says so that&rsquo;s enough, whether it&rsquo;s so or
  not, what?&rdquo; Regan will fling at you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty <i>good</i> blood,
  ain&rsquo;t it, no matter what kind it is? Well then&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>9<br>
      <a name="Marley"></a>Marley</b></h2>
  <p>There are some men they remember on the Hill Division&mdash;Marley is one
  of them; and his story goes back to the days before the fire wiped out what
  the strike had left of the old rambling shops at the western end of the Big
  Cloud yards, back to the time when &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; Carleton was young
  in the superintendency of the division, when Tommy Regan, squat, fat and
  paunchy was master mechanic, and Harvey, was division engineer, and Spence
  was chief dispatcher, when the Big Fellows, as they were called, wrestled
  with the rough of it, shaking the steel down into a permanent right of way,
  shackling the Rockies, welding the West and the East.</p>
  <p>Marley was not a &ldquo;Big Fellow&rdquo; in either sense of the word.</p>
  <p>Officially, when he started in, he wasn&rsquo;t anything&mdash;that is,
  anything in particular. Sort of general assistant, assistant section hand,
  assistant boiler washer, assistant anything you like to everybody&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s
  duties, if nothing else, were multifarious.</p>
  <p>Physically, he was a queer card. He was built on plans that gave you the
  impression Dame Nature had been doing a little something herself along the
  lines of original research and experimentation&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t well
  enough satisfied with the result to duplicate it! Anyway, as far as any one
  ever knew, there wasn&rsquo;t but one Marley produced. Maybe nature, even,
  isn&rsquo;t infallible; maybe she made a mistake, maybe she didn&rsquo;t.
  You couldn&rsquo;t call him deformed&mdash;and yet you could! That&rsquo;s
  Marley exactly&mdash;when you get to describing him you get contradictory.
  It must have been his neck. That lopped off two or three inches from his
  stature&mdash;because he hadn&rsquo;t any! But if that shortened him down
  to, say, five feet five, which isn&rsquo;t so short after all&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  the contradiction again, you see&mdash;the length of his arms at least was
  something to marvel at, they made up for the neck. Regan used to say Marley
  could stand on the floor of the roundhouse and clean out an engine pit without
  leaning over. The master mechanic was more or less gifted with imagination,
  but he wasn&rsquo;t so far out, not more than a couple of feet or so, at
  that. Marley&rsquo;s hair, more than anything else that comes handy by way
  of comparison, was like the stuff, in color and texture, the fellows on the
  stage light and put in their mouths so as to blow out smoke like a belching
  stack under forced draft&mdash;tow, they call it. Eyes&mdash;no woman ever
  had any like them&mdash;big and round and wide, with a peculiar violet tinge
  to them, and lids that had a trick of closing down with a little hesitating
  flutter like a girl trying to flirt with you.</p>
  <p>But what&rsquo;s the use! Marley, piecemeal, would never look like the short-stepping,
  springy-walked, foreshortened, arms-flopping Marley with the greasy black
  peaked cap pulled over his forehead, the greasy jumper tucked into greasier
  overalls who sold his hybrid services to the Transcontinental for the munificent
  sum of a dollar ten a day.</p>
  <p>Marley&rsquo;s arrival and introduction to Big Cloud was, like Marley himself,
  decidedly out of the ordinary and by no manner of means commonplace. Marley
  arrived &ldquo;&rsquo;boing it&rdquo; in a refrigerator car.</p>
  <p>They ice the cars at Big Cloud and, luckily for Marley, the particular one
  he had, in some unexplained way, managed to appropriate required a little
  something more than icing. They pulled him out in about as flabby a condition
  as a sack of flour. He didn&rsquo;t say anything for himself mainly because
  he was pretty nearly past ever saying anything for himself or anybody else.
  The boys who found him cursed fluently because he wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant
  sight, and then carried him up Main Street on the door of a box-car with
  the hazy notion that MacGuire&rsquo;s Blazing Star Saloon was the most fitting
  Mecca available.</p>
  <p>Marley continued to play in luck. Mrs. Coogan, the mother of Chick Coogan,
  that is, who went out in the Fall blizzard on the Devil&rsquo;s Slide some
  years before, spotted the procession as it passed her little shack, halted
  it, made a hasty, but none the less comprehensive, examination, amplified
  it by a few scathing remarks on discovering the proposed destination, peremptorily
  ordered them into her bit of a cottage and installed Marley therein.</p>
  <p>He was pretty far gone, pretty far&mdash;and he hung on the ragged edge
  for weeks. Nobody knows what Mrs. Coogan did for him except Marley himself;
  but it was generally conceded that she did more than she could afford for
  anybody, let alone doing it for a stray hobo.</p>
  <p>Marley got well in time, of course, for, than old, motherly Mrs. Coogan
  there was no better nurse, even if she had few comforts and dainties and
  less money to buy them with; and then Marley got a job&mdash;or rather Mrs.
  Coogan got one for him.</p>
  <p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything Mrs. Coogan could have asked for and not got
  that was within their power to give her&mdash;she was Chick&rsquo;s mother,
  and with Carleton or Regan or any of the rest of them that was enough. But
  Mrs. Coogan never asked anything for herself&mdash;she had the Coogan pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The good Lord be praised,&rdquo; she would say&mdash;Mrs. Coogan
  was sincerely devout. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m able to worrk, so I am, an&rsquo; fwhy
  should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why should she? They smiled at her as men smile when something touches them
  under the vest, and they want to say the proper thing&mdash;and can&rsquo;t.
  They smiled&mdash;and gave her their washing.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Coogan tackled Regan on Marley&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
  <p>The master mechanic scratched his head in perplexity, but his reply was
  prompt and hearty enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Sure thing, Mrs. Coogan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Send him down
  to me. I&rsquo;ll find him something to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Marley he talked a little differently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t quite sure I like the looks of you,&rdquo; he flung
  out bluntly enough, taking in the new man from head to toe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  no job for you, but I&rsquo;ll give you a chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marley&rsquo;s eyes came down in a flutter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir,&rdquo; he mumbled nervously.</p>
  <p>Tommy Regan wasn&rsquo;t used to being &ldquo;sir&rdquo; ed&mdash;the Hill
  Division did its business with few handles and it wasn&rsquo;t long on the
  amenities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he ejaculated with a snort, and a stream of black-strap
  laid the dust on a good few inches of engine cinders. &ldquo;You can hand
  any thanks you&rsquo;ve got coming over to Mother Coogan. And say&rdquo;&mdash;the
  master mechanic wriggled his fat forefinger under Marley&rsquo;s nose&mdash;&ldquo;thanks
  are all right as far as they go, but I figure you owe her something over
  and above that, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A faint flush came into Marley&rsquo;s cheeks and he darted a quick look
  at Regan. His eyes were on the ground and his hands had suddenly disappeared
  in his pockets before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to board with her a spell,&rdquo; he said in a slow
  way, as though he was measuring every word before it was uttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are, eh?&rdquo; grunted Regan, but the grunt carried a grudging note
  of approval. &ldquo;Well, maybe that&rsquo;ll help some. You can report at
  noon, Marley, and make yourself generally handy around. I reckon you&rsquo;ll
  find enough to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir,&rdquo; said Marley again, as he turned away.</p>
  <p>Regan, leaning on the turntable push-bar in front of the roundhouse, followed
  with his eyes as the other crossed the tracks in the direction of the town,
  then he spat profoundly again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queerest looking specimen that ever blew into the mountains, and
  we&rsquo;ve had some before that were in a whole class by themselves at that,&rdquo; he
  remarked, screwing up his eyebrows. &ldquo;Makes you think of a blasted
  gorilla the way he&rsquo;s laid out, what? Well, we&rsquo;ll give him a try
  anyway,&rdquo; and, with a final glance in the direction of the retreating
  figure, the master mechanic went into the roundhouse for his morning inspection
  of the big moguls on the pits.</p>
  <p>It took the division and Big Cloud some time to size up the new man, and
  then just about when they thought they had they found they hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>Marley, if he was nothing else, was a contradictory specimen.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Coogan said it was like the good Lord was kind of paying her special
  attention, kind of giving her another son&mdash;&ldquo;so quiet an&rsquo; accommodatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; handy
  to have around. A good bhoy was Marley&mdash;a foine lad.&rdquo; One hand
  would rest on her hip, and the other would smooth the thin white hair over
  her ear with quick, nervous, little pats as she talked, and the gray Irish
  eyes, a little dim now, would light up happily. &ldquo;Yes, ut&rsquo;s more
  than I deserve; but I always knew the Lord wud provide. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
  so easy to move the tubs around as it uster be. I guess I knew it, but I
  wasn&rsquo;t willin&rsquo; to admit it till I had somebody to do it for
  me. Sivinty-wan I was last birthday. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t old for a man, but
  a woman&mdash;indade he&rsquo;s a foine lad, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis myself
  that ses ut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down at headquarters Mrs. Coogan&rsquo;s praise went a long way, and after
  Carleton and Regan and the others in the office got accustomed to seeing
  him around they came to accept him in a passive, indifferent sort of a way.
  He was a curious case, if you like, but inoffensive&mdash;they let it go
  at that.</p>
  <p>The men had their view-point. Marley didn&rsquo;t talk much, didn&rsquo;t
  draw out the way a new hand was expected to in order to establish his footing
  with the fraternity. Least of all did he make any overtures tending to anything
  like an intimate relationship with any of his new associates. Marley was
  never one of the group behind the storekeeper&rsquo;s office that had stolen
  out from the shops for a drag at their pipes and a breath of air; never on
  the platform to exchange a word of banter with the crews of the incoming
  trains; never amongst the wipers and hostlers in the roundhouse who lounged
  in idle moments in the lee of a ten-wheeler with an eye out across the yards
  against the possible intrusion of Regan or some other embodiment of authority.
  He was civil enough and quick enough to answer when he was spoken to, but
  his words were few&mdash;no more than a simple negative or affirmative if
  he could help it. And when he himself was in question there was not even
  that&mdash;Marley became dumb.</p>
  <p>All this did not help him any&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call
  exactly popular! So, if he had little to say for himself, the men had plenty,
  and the general opinion was that he was a surly brute that by no possible
  chance was any credit to the Hill Division and by no manner of means an acquisition
  to Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>A few, very few, took a more charitable view, basing it on the shy, slow
  flutter of Marley&rsquo;s eyelids&mdash;they charged it up to an acute sensitiveness
  of his grotesque and abnormal appearance. That isn&rsquo;t the way they put
  it, though.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks like hell, an&rsquo; he knows it,&rdquo; said they judicially. &ldquo;Let
  the beggar alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was good advice, whether their analysis was or wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;Pete
  Boileau, the baggage master, can vouch for that. As the time-worn saying
  has it, it came like a bolt from the blue, and&mdash;but just a minute, we&rsquo;re
  overrunning our targets and that means trouble.</p>
  <p>Things had gone along, as far as Marley was concerned, without anything
  very startling or out of the way happening for quite a spell, and Regan,
  who had stood closer to Chick Coogan than any other man on the division before
  the young engineer died, had begun to look on Marley with a little more interest&mdash;as
  a sort of <i>deus ex machina</i> for Mrs. Coogan. It seemed to afford the
  big-hearted master mechanic a good deal of relief. He got to talking about
  it to Carleton one morning about a month after Marley&rsquo;s advent to the
  Hill Division.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course, I don&rsquo;t know anything about him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody
  does, I guess they don&rsquo;t. But he minds his own business and does what
  he has to do well enough, h&rsquo;m? The old lady&rsquo;s been getting a
  little feeble lately&mdash;kind of wearing out, I guess she is. I was thinking
  Marley was worth a little more than a dollar ten a day, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They were sitting in the super&rsquo;s office, and Carleton&rsquo;s glance,
  straying out through the window from where he sat at his desk, fastened on
  Marley&rsquo;s clumsy, ungainly figure hopping across the yard tracks from
  the roundhouse toward the station platform. He smiled a little and looked
  back at Regan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess so, Tommy&mdash;if it will do her any good. I wouldn&rsquo;t
  bank on it, though. He&rsquo;s a queer card. Impresses you with the feeling
  that there&rsquo;s something you ought to know about him&mdash;and don&rsquo;t.
  I&rsquo;ve a notion, somehow, I&rsquo;ve seen him before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said Regan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. I&rsquo;ve
  thought I had myself once or twice, but I guess it&rsquo;s imagination more
  than anything else. Anyway, he seems to remember what Mrs. Coogan did for
  him. I dunno what she&rsquo;d do even now without the board money, little
  as it is, to help out. There&rsquo;s no use borrowing trouble I suppose,
  but later on I dunno what on earth she&rsquo;ll do. She&rsquo;s prouder than
  a sceptered queen&mdash;and she won&rsquo;t be able to wash much longer,
  nor take a boarder either, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton sucked at his briar for a moment in silence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
  all got to face the possibility of the scrap heap some day, Tommy,&rdquo; he
  said soberly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s harder for a woman, I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;bitter
  hard. Sometimes things don&rsquo;t seem just right. If you want to give Marley
  a small raise, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The master mechanic nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I will,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s queer if you
  like, but that&rsquo;s his own business. Never a word out of him nor a bit
  of trouble since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regan&rsquo;s words stopped as though they had been chopped off with a knife.
  Both men, as though actuated by a single impulse, had leaped to their feet.
  Behind them their chairs toppled unheeded with a crash to the floor, and
  for an instant, as their eyes met each other&rsquo;s, the color faded in
  their cheeks. It had come and gone like a flash&mdash;a wild, hoarse scream
  of rage, a brute scream, horrid, blood curdling, like the jungle howl of
  some maddened beast plunged in a savage, blind, all-possessing paroxysm of
  fury.</p>
  <p>Themselves again in a second, the master mechanic and superintendent sprang
  to the window.</p>
  <p>On the platform, up at the far end, the great form of Pete Boileau rocked
  and swayed like a drunken man, and clinging to him, his legs twined around
  the other&rsquo;s knees, his arms locked around the baggage-master&rsquo;s
  body just above the elbows&mdash;was Marley!</p>
  <p>Regan and Carleton gazed spellbound. There was something uncanny, inhuman
  about the scene&mdash;like a rabid dog that had leaped, snarling, for the
  throat hold.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Marley&rsquo;s legs with a quick, wriggling slide, released their
  hold, his whole form appeared to shrink, grow smaller, he seemed to crouch
  on his knees at the other&rsquo;s feet, then his body jerked itself erect
  to its full stature with a movement swift as a loosed bowstring, his arms
  flew up carrying a great burden, and over his shoulders, over his head, a
  sprawling form hurtled through the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merciful God! He&rsquo;s killed him!&rdquo; gasped Carleton, dashing
  for the door. &ldquo;Come on, Tommy, <i>Quick!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both men were down the stairs in a space of time that Regan, at least, chunky
  and fat, has never duplicated before or since. Carleton, hard-faced and tightlipped,
  led the way, with the picture beating into his brain of Boileau&rsquo;s senseless
  form on the ground and the other above tearing like a beast at its prey.
  He wrenched the door of the station open, sprang out on to the platform,
  stopped involuntarily, and then ran forward again.</p>
  <p>The baggage-master&rsquo;s form was on the ground lying in a curled-up,
  huddled heap, and he was senseless all right&mdash;if he wasn&rsquo;t something
  more than that. But the rest of Carleton&rsquo;s mental picture was wrong,
  dead wrong. Right beside where the fight, if fight it could be called, had
  taken place was a baggage truck, and over this, his head down, his two great
  arms wound round his face, shoulders heaving in convulsive sobs, Marley was
  crying like a broken-hearted child.</p>
  <p>Take him any way you like, look at him any way you like, Marley, whatever
  else he was, was a contradictory specimen.</p>
  <p>Any other man with a skull a shade less tender than Boileau&rsquo;s&mdash;it
  must have been made of boiler plate&mdash;would never have drawn another
  pay check. And even granting the boiler plate part of it, it was something
  to wonder at. He had gone through the air like a rocket, and his head had
  caught the full of it when he landed. How far? Carleton never said. He measured
  it&mdash;twice. But he never gave out the figures of Boileau&rsquo;s aerial
  flight. Pete was a big man, six feet something, and heavy for his height.
  The strength of four ordinary men concentrated in one pair of arms might
  have done it perhaps; mathematically it wouldn&rsquo;t figure out any other
  way. Carleton never said. But what&rsquo;s the use! The division did some
  tall thinking over it&mdash;and Marley cried!</p>
  <p>They picked up Pete Boileau and carried him into the station, and the contents
  of a fire bucket over his head opened his eyes. But it was a good fifteen
  minutes before he could talk, and by that time when they got over their scare
  and thought of Marley the baggage truck was deserted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What started it!&rdquo; growled Boileau, repeating Carleton&rsquo;s
  inquiry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hanged if I know. I was jossing him a little&mdash;nothing
  to make anybody sore. I was only funning anyhow, and laughing when I said
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Said what?&rdquo; demanded Regan, cutting in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, nothing much. He looked so queer hopping across the tracks like
  a monkey on a stick that I just asked him why he didn&rsquo;t cut out railroading
  and hit up a museum for a job, and then before I knew it he let out a screech
  and was on me like a blasted catamount.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo; said the master mechanic gruffly. &ldquo;I
  guess you won&rsquo;t nag him again, I guess you won&rsquo;t. And none of
  the other men won&rsquo;t neither if they&rsquo;ve had any notion that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wicked little devil,&rdquo; snarled Boileau. &ldquo;And
  the strength of him&rdquo;&mdash;the baggage-master shivered&mdash;&ldquo;he
  ain&rsquo;t human. He&rsquo;ll kill somebody yet, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;ll
  do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pete&rsquo;s summing up was a popular one&mdash;the men promptly ticketed
  and carded Marley as per Boileau&rsquo;s bill of lading. There wasn&rsquo;t
  any more doubt about him, no discussions, no anything. They knew Marley at
  last, and they liked him less than ever; but, also, they imbibed a very wholesome
  respect for the welfare of their own skins. A man with arms whose strength
  is the strength of derrick booms is to be approached with some degree of
  caution.</p>
  <p>Marley himself said nothing. Carleton and Regan got him on the carpet and
  tried to get his version of the story, but for all they got out of him they
  might as well have saved their time.</p>
  <p>A pathetic enough looking figure, in a way, he was, as he stood in the super&rsquo;s  office
    the afternoon of the fight. The shoulders were drooping giving the arms an
    even longer appearance than usual, no color in his face, the violet eyes
    almost black, with a dead, hunted look in them. Sorrow, remorse, dread&mdash;neither
  Regan nor Carleton knew. They couldn&rsquo;t understand him&mdash;then. Marley
  offered no explanation, volunteered nothing. Boileau&rsquo;s story was right&mdash;that
  was all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might have killed the man,&rdquo; said Carleton sternly, at the
  end of an unsatisfactory twenty minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can thank your Maker you haven&rsquo;t his blood on your hands&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  a miracle you haven&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t you know your own strength? We can&rsquo;t
  have that sort of thing around here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marley&rsquo;s face seemed to grow even whiter than before and he shivered
  a little, though the afternoon was dripping wet with the heat and the thermometer
  was sizzling well up in the nineties&mdash;he shivered but his lips were
  hard shut and he didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>Carleton, for once in his life when it came to handling men, didn&rsquo;t
  seem to be altogether sure of himself. An ordinary fight was one thing, and,
  generally speaking, strictly the men&rsquo;s own business; but everything
  about Marley, from his arrival at Big Cloud to the sudden beastlike ferocity
  he had displayed that morning, put a little different complexion on the matter.
  A puzzled look settled on the super&rsquo;s face as he glanced from Marley
  to the master mechanic, while his fingers drummed a tattoo on the edge of
  his desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had some provocation, Marley,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m not taking that into consideration&mdash;but
  not enough to work up any such deviltry as you exhibited. You&rsquo;ll never
  get on with the men here after this. They&rsquo;ll make things pretty hard
  for you. I think you&rsquo;d better go&mdash;for your own sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was dead silence in the super&rsquo;s room for a half minute, then
  Regan, who had been sitting with his chair tilted back and his feet up on
  the window-sill, dropped the chair legs to the floor and swung around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I put Logan up firing yesterday,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  a night job wiping in the roundhouse. What do you say about it, Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Marley who answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Yes!</i>&rdquo; he said fiercely.</p>
  <p>Carleton jabbed at the bowl of his pipe with his forefinger and his eyebrows
  went up at Marley&rsquo;s sudden animation. Marley&rsquo;s eyes met his with
  a single quick glance, and then the eyelids fluttered down covering them.
  There was something in the look that caught the super, something he couldn&rsquo;t
  define. There was a plea, but there was something more&mdash;like a pledge,
  almost, it seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said shortly; then, nodding at Mar-ley in dismissal: &ldquo;I
  hope you will remember what I&rsquo;ve said. You may go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marley hesitated as though about to speak and changed his mind, evidently,
  for he turned, walked straight to the door and out, then his boots creaked
  down the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be away from the men there, all except a few,&rdquo; said
  the master mechanic, as though picking up the thread of a discussion. &ldquo;And
  as for them, I&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s no trouble. There&rsquo;s Mrs.
  Coogan now that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Tommy&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton smiled a little&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
  put your interest all down to love for Marley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What gets me,&rdquo; muttered Regan screwing up his eyes, as his
  teeth met in the plug he had dragged with some labor from his hip pocket, &ldquo;what
  gets me is the way he went to crying afterward. Like a kid, he was. It was
  the blamedest thing I ever saw, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s responsible for himself when he gets
  like that,&rdquo; replied Carleton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I am
  afraid of. It comes over him in a flash, making a very demon of him, and
  then the relaxation the other way is just as uncontrollable. I don&rsquo;t
  suppose he can help it, he&rsquo;s made that way. It wouldn&rsquo;t make
  so much difference in an ordinary man, but with strength like his&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton
  blew a ring of smoke ceilingwards&mdash;&ldquo;you saw what he did to Boileau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t likely to forget it,&rdquo; said Regan. &ldquo;But
  if he&rsquo;s left alone I guess he&rsquo;ll be all right. Any man that&rsquo;s
  fool enough to do anything else now will do it with his eyes open, and it&rsquo;s
  his own funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those of the night crew in the roundhouse were evidently of the same mind.
  They received him, it is true, with little evidence of cordiality, but their
  aloofness was decidedly pronounced, and they looked askance at the queer
  figure as it dodged in and out of the shadows cast by the big mountain racers,
  or, at times, stood silently by one of the engine doors under the dim light
  of an oil lamp staring out across the black of the turntable to the twinkling
  switch lights in the yard. They didn&rsquo;t like him, but they had learned
  their lesson well; and, as the weeks slipped away, they practised it&mdash;he
  was to be left alone.</p>
  <p>One thing they grudgingly admitted&mdash;Marley could work, and did. Clarihue,
  the night turner, was man enough to give another his due any time, no matter
  what his own personal feelings might be, and there was some talk, after a
  bit, between him and the master mechanic about Marley getting the next spare
  run firing.</p>
  <p>Clarihue even went so far as to hint at it as a possibility to Marley, and
  for his pains got a surprise&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t used to seeing the chance
  of promotion turned down. Marley had shaken his head and would have none
  of it. He was satisfied where he was. That was all there was to that. Clarihue
  drew back into his shell after that. Marley could wipe till his hair was
  gray for all he cared.</p>
  <p>So Marley wiped; but at Mrs. Coogan&rsquo;s cottage, as the summer waned,
  there wasn&rsquo;t as much washing done as there had been, and the company
  doctor got to dropping in too frequently to put his visits down to the old-time
  occasional friendly calls for an afternoon chat. And then, one day in the
  early fall, the washing stopped altogether, and the doctor&rsquo;s face was
  puckered and serious as he left the cottage and headed down Main Street to
  the station. He entered Carleton&rsquo;s office and, after a few words between
  them, the super sent for Regan.</p>
  <p>That evening Carleton&rsquo;s private car was waiting on the siding when
  Number Two, the Eastbound Limited, Chick Coogan&rsquo;s old train, pulled
  in.</p>
  <p>As the little yard switcher importantly coughed the super&rsquo;s car on
  to the rear Pullman, Regan, in his Sunday best, a store suit of black twill,
  with boiled shirt and stiff collar, came out of the station with Mrs. Coogan
  on his arm.</p>
  <p>An incongruous pair they looked. The little old lady&rsquo;s walk was in
  painful contrast to the burly master mechanic&rsquo;s stride&mdash;her short
  steps had a painful, hesitating, uncertain waver to them. One hand gripped
  tenaciously at Regan&rsquo;s coat-sleeve, while the other held the faded,
  old-fashioned shawl close about her thin, bent shoulders. She carried her
  head drooped forward a little, hiding the face under the quaint poke bonnet.</p>
  <p>A moment later Carleton, too, emerged from the station and joined them.</p>
  <p>The station hands and the loungers eyed the trio with curiosity, and then
  stared in amazement as the two officials helped the old lady up the steps
  of the private car&mdash;Mrs. Coogan was getting the best of it, whatever
  it meant.</p>
  <p>The three disappeared inside, but presently Regan and Carleton came out
  again, and the super dropped to the station platform. He held out his hand
  to the master mechanic as Frank Knowles, the conductor, lifted his finger
  to Burke in the cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by, Tommy; and good luck,&rdquo; he called, as the train began
  to move out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry, take all the time you need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Regan shouted back. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton stood for a moment watching the tail lights grow dimmer until,
  finally, they shot suddenly out of sight with the curve of the track, then
  he turned to walk back along the platform&mdash;and stopped.</p>
  <p>Crouched back against the wall of the freight house, deep in the shadows,
  was Marley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here you, Marley,&rdquo; Carleton called.</p>
  <p>Marley, evidently believing himself to have been unobserved, started violently,
  and then came slowly forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you hiding there for?&rdquo; demanded the super.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to see Mrs. Coogan off,&rdquo; Marley answered a little
  defiantly.</p>
  <p>The tone of the other&rsquo;s voice did not please Carleton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a queer way of doing it then,&rdquo; he snapped shortly.</p>
  <p>Marley was twisting his hands, staring down the track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said good-by before I came down to work,&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke
  as though talking to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Carleton, and looked at Marley sharply, &ldquo;I
  suppose you know what she went East for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marley gruffly. That was all&mdash;just &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; And
  with that he turned abruptly and started across the tracks for the roundhouse.</p>
  <p>Carleton, taken aback, watched him in angry amazement, then the scowl that
  had settled on his face broke in a smile, and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess Tommy is right,&rdquo; he muttered, as he went on toward the
  office. &ldquo;Marley&rsquo;s all in a class by himself. We&rsquo;ve never
  had anything like him in the mountains before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was four days before Mrs. Coogan and the master mechanic came back. Days
  during which Marley slipped into Dutchy&rsquo;s lunch counter at deserted
  moments for his meals, and, if that were possible, drew into himself closer
  than ever.</p>
  <p>The boys were curious about Mrs. Coogan, naturally; curious enough even
  to question Marley. He had one answer, only one. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sick,
  I guess,&rdquo; he said. They got nothing more out of him than that.</p>
  <p>One thing Marley did, though, that Clarihue, while he thought nothing of
  it at the time, remembered well enough afterwards. He asked the turner to
  give him a sheet of railroad paper and a manila, and in his spare moments
  the night before Mrs. Coogan came back he labored, bent over the little desk
  where the engine crews signed on and off, scratching painstakingly with a
  pen. Clarihue caught a glimpse of the sheet in passing before Marley hastily
  covered it up&mdash;just a glimpse, not enough to read a single word, just
  enough to marvel a little at the wiper&rsquo;s hand. Marley was a pretty
  good penman.</p>
  <p>Marley, of course, being on night duty slept daytimes, but the afternoon
  Regan brought Mrs. Coogan back to the cottage he must have heard them coming,
  for he was standing in the little sitting-room when they came in.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Coogan kind of hesitated on the threshold, then she called out quickly
  in a faltering way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marley, Marley, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marley was twisting his hands nervously. His eyes shot a rapid glance from
  the old lady to the master mechanic, and then the eyelids fluttered down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stumbled toward him and burst into tears, crying as though her heart
  would break.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marley, Marley,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lave them do
  ut. Don&rsquo;t lave them do ut, there&rsquo;s a good bhoy, Marley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marley never moved, just licked his lips with his tongue and his face grew
  whiter. Queer, the way he acted? Well, perhaps. Never a move to catch the
  frail, tottering figure, never a word to soothe the pitiful grief. He stood
  like a man listening as a judge pronounces his doom. Oh, yes, queer, if you
  like. Marley, whatever else he was, was a contradictory specimen.</p>
  <p>It was Regan who caught the old lady in his arms, and led her gently into
  her bedroom off the parlor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t give way like that, Mrs. Coogan,&rdquo; he said
  kindly. &ldquo;Just lie down for a spell and you&rsquo;ll feel better. I&rsquo;ll
  ask Mrs. Dahleen, next door, to come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took the master mechanic several minutes to quiet her and persuade her
  to do as he asked, but when he came out again Marley was still standing,
  exactly as before, in the centre of the room. With a black scowl on his face,
  Regan motioned the other outside, and, once on the street, he laid the wiper
  low. Hard tongued was Regan when his temper was aroused and he did not choose
  his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by treating her like that, you scrapings from
  the junk heap, you!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;You know well enough what
  she went away for, and if you&rsquo;ve any brains in that ugly head of yours
  you know well enough what she&rsquo;s come back to, without any printed instructions
  to help you out. What are you playing at, eh? What do you mean? You&rsquo;re
  not fit to associate with a dog! And she the woman that spent about her all
  to save your miserable carcass, you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stop!&rdquo;&mdash;the words came like the warning
  hiss of a serpent before it strikes. Marley&rsquo;s face was livid, and his
  great gnarled hands were creeping slowly upward above his waist line.</p>
  <p>With a startled oath, Regan leaped quickly back: and then, separated by
  a yard, the men stood eying each other in silence.</p>
  <p>It was gone in a flash as it had come, for Marley, with a shudder, dropped
  his hands limply to his sides, and the color crept slowly back into his cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no chance for her?&rdquo;&mdash;no trace of the passionate
  outburst of an instant before remained. The question came low, hesitating&mdash;more
  like an assertion combined with a wistful appeal for contradiction.</p>
  <p>It took Regan longer to recover himself, and it was a minute before he answered.
  Then he shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be stone blind in a month,&rdquo; he said gruffly.</p>
  <p>Marley&rsquo;s eyes came up to the master mechanic&rsquo;s&mdash;and dropped
  instantly with their habitual little flutter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no doubt, no chance of a mistake?&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
  <p>Again Regan shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance. The best man we could find East made the examination.
  We&rsquo;re arranging to get her into an institute&mdash;a home for the blind
  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you would&rdquo;&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s voice was monotonous. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  what she was talking about, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Regan.</p>
  <p>Marley wagged his head with a judicial air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll kill her,&rdquo; he remarked, as though stating a self-evident,
  but commonplace, fact. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll kill her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will,&rdquo; the master mechanic admitted gravely. &ldquo;But
  there&rsquo;s nothing else to do. It&rsquo;s impossible for her to stay here.
  She&rsquo;s got to have some one to look after her, and she has no money.
  God knows I wish we could, but we can&rsquo;t see any other way than put
  her in some place like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you would if it turned out bad,&rdquo; said Marley again,
  in dead tones. &ldquo;I figured it out that way when you were gone.&rdquo; His
  hands were traveling in an aimless fashion in and out of his pockets. Suddenly
  he half pulled out an envelope, started, hastily shoved it back, and looked
  at Regan. &ldquo;I&mdash;I got a letter to post,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, supposing you have,&rdquo; said Regan a little savagely&mdash;Regan
  wasn&rsquo;t interested in letters just then,&mdash;&ldquo;supposing you
  have, you needn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Marley was well across the street.</p>
  <p>The master mechanic gasped angrily, choked&mdash;and went into Mrs. Dahleen&rsquo;s
  cottage on his errand. It was wasted breath to talk to Marley anyhow.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the news to spread around Big Cloud, and for
  three days they talked about Mrs. Coogan pretty constantly&mdash;after that
  they talked about Marley.</p>
  <p>The Westbound Limited schedules Big Cloud for 2:05 in the afternoon, and
  on the third day after Mrs. Coogan&rsquo;s return Marley came down the street
  about half-past one, and crossed the tracks to the shops. Regan was in the
  fitting-shop when Marley walked in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak to you,&rdquo; said Marley, going straight
  up to the master mechanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; grunted Regan, none too cordially.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to come over to Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s office with
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was something in Marley&rsquo;s voice, feverish, impelling, something
  in his face, that stopped the impatient question that sprang to Regan&rsquo;s
  lips. He looked at the ungainly, grotesque figure of the wiper for an instant
  curiously, then without a word led the way out of the shops.</p>
  <p>They traversed the yard in silence, climbed the stairs in the station, and
  entered the super&rsquo;s room. Marley closed the door and stood with his
  back against it.</p>
  <p>Carleton, at his desk, looked from one to the other in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The master mechanic jerked his thumb at Marley, and appropriated a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wanted me to come over. I don&rsquo;t know what for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton turned inquiringly to the wiper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>Marley walked slowly across the room until he reached the super&rsquo;s
  desk. His face was drawn, and he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Mrs. Coogan,&rdquo; he said jerkily. &ldquo;Five
  thousand would be enough, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton stared at the man as though he were mad, and Regan hitched his
  chair suddenly forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you swear to give it to her if I get it for you?&rdquo;&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s
  hand, clenched, was on the desk, and he leaned his body far forward toward
  the super. There was no flutter of the eyelids now, and his eyes stared into
  Carleton&rsquo;s without a flicker. &ldquo;<i>Swear it!</i>&rdquo; he cried
  fiercely.</p>
  <p>Carleton drew back involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marley,&rdquo; he said soothingly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not yourself,
  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; Marley broke in passionately. &ldquo;I
  know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I know she&rsquo;d die in one of them
  charity places. It&rsquo;s up to me. She treated me white&mdash;the only
  soul on God&rsquo;s earth that ever did. And maybe, maybe too, it&rsquo;ll
  help square accounts. You&rsquo;ll play fair and swear she gets the money,
  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Carleton slowly; &ldquo;but
  I&rsquo;ll swear to give her anything you have to give.&rdquo; Marley nodded
  quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
  much to understand.&rdquo; He fumbled in his pocket and brought out a newspaper
  clipping, a column long, which he laid on the desk. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll
  get it all there.&rdquo; The heavy &ldquo;set&rdquo; of the heading leaped
  up at Carleton. &ldquo;$5,000 REWARD.&rdquo; Below, halfway down the column,
  was the reproduction of a photograph&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Regan was up from his chair, bending over the super&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d seen you somewhere before&rdquo;&mdash;Carleton&rsquo;s
  voice sounded strained and hollow in his own ears. &ldquo;It must have been
  the picture. I remember now. You&mdash;you killed a man in Denver a year
  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all there,&rdquo; said Marley, licking his lips again. &ldquo;I
  never saw him before. I killed him like I almost killed Boileau this summer.
  I didn&rsquo;t know till afterward that he was rich, not until the family
  hung out that reward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton did not speak. Regan reached viciously for his plug. Marley stirred
  uneasily, and drew the back of his hand across his forehead. It came away
  soggy wet. In the silence the chime of the Limited&rsquo;s whistle floated
  in through the open window, then, presently, the roar of the train and the
  grinding shriek of the brake-shoes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; said Carleton in a whisper, &ldquo;you want me to
  give you up and get the reward&mdash;for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A queer smile flickered across Marley&rsquo;s face. Heavy steps came running
  up the stairs. There was a smart rap upon the door and a man stepped quickly
  inside. For a second his eyes swept the little group. Then he whirled like
  a flash, and the blue-black muzzle of a revolver held a bead on Marley&rsquo;s
  heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Shorty,&rdquo; he cried grimly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got you at
  last, eh? Put out your hands!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without protest, with the same queer smile on his face, Marley obeyed. There
  was a little click of steel, and he dropped his locked wrists before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Carleton, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&mdash;the newcomer
  had swung to the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carleton numbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hepburn of the Denver police,&rdquo; went on the officer. &ldquo;We
  appreciate this, Mr. Carleton. Shorty here has been badly wanted for a long
  time. We got your letter yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hepburn paused to reach into his pocket, and in the pause Carleton&rsquo;s
  eyes met Marley&rsquo;s&mdash;and he understood. Marley had written the letter
  himself and signed his, Carleton&rsquo;s, name. And, too, it was clear enough
  now, the telegram he had puzzled over the previous afternoon. It was lying
  before him on his desk.</p>
  <p>His eyes dropped to it. &ldquo;Will be on hand on arrival of Limited, (signed)
  Denver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t give you any receipt for him as you requested,&rdquo; continued
  Hepburn, drawing a paper out of his pocket; &ldquo;but here&rsquo;s an acknowledgment
  that his capture is due to information furnished by you. I guess that will
  answer the purpose. You won&rsquo;t have any trouble getting the reward.&rdquo; He
  handed the paper to Carleton.</p>
  <p>The super took it mechanically, and started as it crackled in his fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hepburn briskly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to appear
  abrupt, but there&rsquo;s a local East at two-twenty. We&rsquo;ll move along,
  Shorty. Good-by, Mr. Carleton. Next time you&rsquo;re in Denver look us up.&rdquo; He
  took Marley&rsquo;s arm and moved toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;tell her, Mr. Carleton&rdquo;&mdash;there was a
  catch in Marley&rsquo;s voice, and the words came low.</p>
  <p>Carleton did not answer. He was staring at the paper in his hand&mdash;Marley&rsquo;s
  price.</p>
  <p>Regan had turned his back, with a hasty movement of his fist to his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her&rdquo;&mdash;the plea came again from the doorway.</p>
  <p>Carleton tried to speak and his voice broke, then he cleared his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will never know, Marley,&rdquo; he said huskily.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>10<br>
      <a name="TheManWhoDidntCount"></a>The Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Count</b></h2>
  <p>He was a little gray-haired hostler, wiper, sweeper, assistant night man
  in the roundhouse at Big Cloud, anything you like, and this is the story
  he told me one night, leaning against the blackened jamb of one of the big
  doors, wiping his hands occasionally upon a hunk of greasy waste.</p>
  <p>They were a rough lot out in the mountains in the days when the Hill Division
  was shaking her steel into something like a permanent right of way&mdash;a
  pretty rough lot. The railroaders because they had to be; the rest because
  they were just that way naturally. Miners and Indians made up the citizenship
  mostly, and there&rsquo;s no worse mixture. They&rsquo;ve got the redskins
  corralled on reserves now; but they hadn&rsquo;t then, and it didn&rsquo;t
  take more than one bad word and one drop of bad whisky to set things in lively
  motion.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a few highfaluting poems, and some other things, about the
  noble red man that works you up so when you read them that you get to wishing
  the Almighty had seen fit to let you be a red man, too. Well, that&rsquo;s
  all right in its way because, after you&rsquo;ve rubbed elbows with some
  of the real thing, you realize that the world owes the poets a living just
  as much as it does anybody else, and that what they say has to sound good;
  so you just come to keep the cautionary signals up by instinct, and let it
  go at that.</p>
  <p>But, to give the poets their due, there&rsquo;s one thing they never trip
  up on, and that&rsquo;s the Indian&rsquo;s compound efficiency for smell.
  The Indian can smell. When he sticks out his chest, faces southeast, and
  begins to draw in the God-given mountain air, you&rsquo;re free to bet that
  the distilleries down Kentucky way are doing enough business to make regular
  dividend checks a sure thing. That&rsquo;s generally good whisky. Bad whisky,
  in smell and otherwise, carries farther&mdash;and it&rsquo;s only fifteen
  miles from here to Coyote Bend!</p>
  <p>Coyote Bend wasn&rsquo;t even a pin prick on the engineers&rsquo; blue prints
  when they mapped out the right of way, and there wasn&rsquo;t any such place
  when the steel was all spiked down until the day some wandering prospector
  staked out a bunch of claims&mdash;and the news spread.</p>
  <p>Gold in the Rockies? No; there&rsquo;s never been much of it <i>found</i>,
  but there&rsquo;s an all-fired big superstition that the mother lode of the
  whole country is tucked away here somewhere. That&rsquo;s why, in two days,
  the wilderness and a gurgling stream that trickled peacefully down through
  a high-walled ca&ntilde;on became Coyote Bend; and that&rsquo;s why the local freight
  began to make regular stops to dump off supplies alongside the track. There
  was no station, of course, no agent, no nothing; the stuff was just dumped,
  that&rsquo;s all. The consignees picked out their goods if they could read,
  or guessed at it if they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>Maybe I ought to have told you this before; anyway, I&rsquo;ll stick it
  in now. There are three men that figure in this story, though one of them
  doesn&rsquo;t count for much. He was a young chap named Charlie Lee. A graduate
  of an Eastern college he was, and all he had to his name was his diploma
  and the clothes he stood in when he hit the West. He struck the super for
  a job, and he got it&mdash;braking on the local freight. Hell for a man like
  him, eh? Well, it was, in more ways than one! Anyway, from that day to this
  it was the best job he ever held down long enough to draw a second month&rsquo;s
  pay check.</p>
  <p>The other two were Matt Perley and Faro Clancy&mdash;&ldquo;Breed&rdquo; Clancy,
  they called him behind his back.</p>
  <p>Perley was a very good sort, pretty straight, pretty clean, measuring by
  the standards out here in those days; a little bit of a sawed-off, blond-haired,
  blue-eyed man, full of grit inside, and an out-and-out railroad man&mdash;only
  a freight conductor, conductor on the local, but he knew his business; he&rsquo;d
  have gone up, &rsquo;way up, in time.</p>
  <p>Clancy was a hellion, there&rsquo;s no other name for him, and even that
  doesn&rsquo;t express it&mdash;no one word could. Indian one way, Irish the
  other. He looked mostly Indian; the Irish came out in the brogue. Black,
  swarthy, small eyes like needle points, coarse dry hair that straggled down
  over his eyebrows, a hulking bony frame with the strength of a wrecking crane&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  Clancy, Breed Clancy.</p>
  <p>Oh, yes, he was slick, slick as they&rsquo;re made&mdash;with his hands.
  Faro, stud poker, dice, anything&mdash;it was his business; that, and running
  booze joints. Mining camps and brand-new boom towns were Clancy&rsquo;s meat
  mostly&mdash;after Perley drove him out of Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t ask me. I don&rsquo;t know what there was between them. That
  was before my time. A woman probably&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s generally blamed
  anyhow. Anyway, one night Perley got the drop on Breed and marched him down
  the street in front of his pistol and out of the town. After that, Clancy
  kept away from Big Cloud. As I say, that part was before my time. I only
  know there was bad blood between them; wicked bad blood on one side, as you&rsquo;ll
  see. Clancy disappeared from Big Cloud, and the two didn&rsquo;t foul each
  other again until Coyote Bend started.</p>
  <p>Breed Clancy hit the Bend with the first inrush of the miners, and before
  any of them had time to much more than get a pick into the ground he was
  busy knocking together a bit of a shack he called a hotel, and was ordering
  the furnishings&mdash;liquid furnishings, you understand&mdash;from Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>There were three barrels of it, the hardest kind of fire water that ever
  went into the mountains waybilled to Clancy at Coyote Bend by the local,
  on the first trip that Charlie Lee ever made with Matt Perley. I&rsquo;m
  getting back to Lee now, you see.</p>
  <p>Well, it was about noon when they whistled for the Bend that day, and Lee,
  riding the brake wheels on the front end, could see about a dozen &ldquo;blankets&rdquo; squatting
  alongside the right of way about where the train would stop. Grouped behind
  these were a number of stragglers from the camp, among whom was a big fellow
  in a red shirt you could see farther than a semaphore arm.</p>
  <p>Now, I don&rsquo;t say those Indians were attracted by the gold rush to
  Coyote Bend. Coyote Bend, or any other place, old or new, stale or prosperous,
  would get its share of the redskins. Where they came from or where they went
  nobody knew. They&rsquo;d drop in from nowhere, and, if they liked the place,
  they&rsquo;d grunt and settle down for a spell; if they didn&rsquo;t like
  it, they&rsquo;d grunt, in benediction or otherwise, and leave.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m not saying they smelled the whisky in that train. I&rsquo;m not
  saying they knew Clancy was importing fire water, and they were just there
  to feast their eyes on the barrels and meditate on what was inside. I&rsquo;m
  not saying anything at all about that, or what followed. There&rsquo;s only
  one man that perhaps might have explained it&mdash;-I say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; because
  he never did; and also, because he knew Indian nature as well as any white
  man in the West. That was Perley.</p>
  <p>Whether Perley even knew that Clancy was at the Bend or not, I don&rsquo;t
  know. I only know that he could have known it if he&rsquo;d bothered to read
  the waybills; and it was likewise on the cards that he might have learned
  the day before, down at Big Cloud, that the whisky was going up the following
  morning. I don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s straight. Sometimes I think
  he did; sometimes I think he didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
  <p>Anyway, Lee slid to the ground as the train stopped, and went back to the
  car that held the consignment for the Bend. As he fumbled with the door,
  he got a whiff of raw spirit that nearly knocked him over. And then, right
  behind him, rose a chorus of appreciative &ldquo;ughs!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I told you an Indian could smell whisky, but I didn&rsquo;t tell you why.
  It&rsquo;s his ruling passion. That&rsquo;s straight. I&rsquo;m not judging
  the Indian; the taste was born in him. There are some white men just as bad.
  I&rsquo;m not judging them, either. Some drink for the same reason the Indian
  does, some for others, and some&mdash;some men drink because they have to.</p>
  <p>What was I saying? Oh, yes, Lee getting that whiff. Well, before he got
  the door unfastened, the man in the red shirt had pushed through the Indians
  and come up beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me name&rsquo;s Clancy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did yez bring up any
  stuff for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s three barrels for somebody,&rdquo; replied Lee, and
  slid open the door&mdash;and the next minute he had jumped back with a yell,
  colliding with Clancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; ejaculated the apparition that confronted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk! Majestically drunk! An&rsquo; on <i>my</i> stuff!&rdquo; roared
  Clancy; and then, turning fiercely on Lee: &ldquo;Fwhat did ye let him in
  there for, eh? Fwhat did ye let him in for, ye mealy-faced little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him in nothing!&rdquo; retorted Lee, getting back his grip on
  himself. &ldquo;Here, you, get out&mdash;and <i>quick!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Indian blinked gravely, but never moved. He sat cross-legged on the
  floor, exactly in the middle of the car between the doors, swaying slightly
  backward and forward. Beside him, up-ended and broached, was one of Clancy&rsquo;s
  kegs. The car reeked with the smell of it, for of the half kegful that had
  gushed out what hadn&rsquo;t gone into the Indian had gone on to the floor.</p>
  <p>The half-breed was raving mad. I&rsquo;ve a notion sometimes the man wasn&rsquo;t
  human at all. He had his hand on Lee&rsquo;s throat when Perley came running
  up from the rear end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; he began, and then he stopped. He was
  a cool devil was Perley, and he never turned a hair as he stepped between
  the two men. &ldquo;Ah, Clancy, it&rsquo;s you, is it, you copper-faced renegade?&rdquo;&mdash;no
  loud talk, no bluster, he didn&rsquo;t raise his voice; but his insult, the
  worst he could have laid his tongue to, cut like the sting of a lash.</p>
  <p>Clancy swung around like a flash&mdash;and stared into the muzzle of the
  conductor&rsquo;s .45. His hands were clenching and unclenching as he recognized
  Perley, and the cords in his neck swelled into knotty lumps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ut&rsquo;s your worrk, this job, is ut?&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Some
  day, Perley, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Queer, you say, he&rsquo;d act like that&mdash;nothing to warrant it. Well,
  maybe. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what was between them before;
  but I do know the awful deviltry of Breed Clancy, and I know that Lee, leaning
  back against the car, shivered at the look that passed between the two of
  them.</p>
  <p>Perley cut the half-breed short off. &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; said he contemptuously,
  still quiet, not a tone raised, and his voice the more deadly for it, &ldquo;once,
  perhaps you&rsquo;ll remember, I warned you to keep out of my road. Lee,
  how&rsquo;d that Indian get in the car?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, throw him out,&rdquo; said Perley shortly, snapping his
  watch with his free hand. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This little ruction between Perley and the half-breed has taken me longer
  to tell it, I guess, than it did to happen. Anyway, it didn&rsquo;t cause
  the excitement you might think it would. The &ldquo;blankets&rdquo; were
  too busy drinking in the smell of that whisky to let their hungry eyes wander
  very far from anywhere but the open door of that car. And as for the stragglers,
  by the time they&rsquo;d caught on to the fact that there was something on
  the boards besides that drunken Indian, Perley, with the same cool contempt,
  had slipped his gun back in his pocket and was boosting Lee into the car.</p>
  <p>The Indian offered no opposition as Lee tackled him. He couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;he
  was beyond all that&mdash;he was so full of dead-eye it was oozing out by
  the pores. He just sat there, and Lee slid him to the door just as he was,
  still sitting, and dropped him out. He struck the ground with a thud, rebounded
  a foot, rolled over, grunted, and lay like a log. There was a guffaw from
  the camp stragglers, and a deep and envious chorus of &ldquo;Ughs!&rdquo; from
  the &ldquo;blankets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No, I&rsquo;m not joking&mdash;it&rsquo;s a long way from a joke, as you&rsquo;ll
  see. They <i>were</i> envious. It acted like a red rag on a bull&mdash;the
  possibility of attaining the condition, the state of heavenly bliss, that
  had been reached by their red brother, do you understand?</p>
  <p>Clancy wasn&rsquo;t laughing. He stood where Perley had left him, sullen
  and with twitching face. I don&rsquo;t know, I think it was Perley&rsquo;s
  sheer nerve that kept the halfbreed from drawing and shooting the conductor
  when his back was turned. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;brute beast cowed by the
  human mind, perhaps. No one ever knew Breed Clancy. He had his yellow streak
  at times, and then again the blood that was in him made him worse than a
  frenzied madman. Yes, I guess it was a case of &ldquo;brute&rdquo; all right,
  for there was no cowing him when the frenzy was on him.</p>
  <p>Perley wasn&rsquo;t laughing, either. He was opening and shutting his watch
  impatiently. &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; he cried at Lee. &ldquo;Get
  those barrels out. We&rsquo;ve got to cross Number Two at the Creek. It&rsquo;ll
  be the carpet for ours if we hold her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lee grabbed the broached cask and edged it toward the doorway. The contents
  slopped and sloshed inside as he moved it, and occasionally a little of the
  stuff would spill out through the bunghole. Then, somehow, just as he got
  it to the door, his hold slipped, out it went, bounded on the edge of the
  ties, and then went down the embankment right into the hands of those squatting &ldquo;blankets.&rdquo; They
  didn&rsquo;t squat long; I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that. They were on
  it in a mob, and they got the taste&mdash;they&rsquo;d had the smell&mdash;and
  the fill was to come presently.</p>
  <p>Clancy was cursing in streams; and no fouler-mouthed man than Clancy ever
  lived. He tried once to get the Indians off the barrel, and the stragglers
  backed him up half-heartedly. You might as well have tried to move that mogul
  on the pit there behind you. He didn&rsquo;t try but once, then he fell back
  on cursing again, and Perley was the target for most of it.</p>
  <p>Perley? He never answered him, but his face grew harder and harder&mdash;and
  his gun was in his hand again. &ldquo;Throw out those other two barrels!&rdquo; he
  snapped at Lee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The redskins will get every last drop if I do,&rdquo; objected Lee,
  hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Owner&rsquo;s risk. We&rsquo;ve no station here. Throw &rsquo;em
  out!&rdquo; repeated Perley, grimmer than before, only this time loud enough
  for Clancy to hear him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye do,&rdquo; roared the half-breed, &ldquo;ye do, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  worse than murdher ye one of these&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; said Perley quietly, waving the go-ahead
  signal to the engine crew.</p>
  <p>And out they went&mdash;down the embankment after the first.</p>
  <p>Lee jumped to the ground and banged the door shut, just as the drawbars
  began to snap tight along the train and the local jolted into motion. He
  waited beside Perley to swing the caboose as it came up. And while he waited
  he watched and grinned.</p>
  <p>Funny? I don&rsquo;t know; it depends on the way you look at it, depends
  on what you call fun. Lee thought it was funny&mdash;then. The air was full
  of curses, Indian yells, shouts, oaths; and there was one jumbled mess of
  arms, and legs, and barrels. The Indians were after their <i>fill</i>, and
  this time Clancy and the stragglers were in the game for keeps.</p>
  <p>Up ahead the engine crew hung grinning out of the gangway. Behind, the other
  brakeman was occupying a reserved seat on the top of the caboose. A quarter
  of a mile away over by the camp, men, attracted by the shouting, were beginning
  to run toward the track. Inconsistent kind of a mix-up, eh?&mdash;Indians,
  miners, whisky barrels, and railroaders. I don&rsquo;t know; call it funny
  if you like, though perhaps you can size it up better when I&rsquo;m through.</p>
  <p>By this time the caboose was up to where Perley and Lee were standing. Perley
  motioned Lee aboard, and then swung on himself.</p>
  <p>Just as he did so, Clancy&rsquo;s red shirt loomed up out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,
  his arm lifted, and over the clack of the car trucks pounding the steel came
  the tinkle of breaking glass from the shattered pane in the door&mdash;the
  bullet had passed between the heads of the two men on the platform, missing
  them by a hair&rsquo;s breadth. Another shot followed the first, another
  and another, dangerously close; splintering the woodwork around them; and
  then Perley fired. The half-breed spun round like a top, clapped his hand
  to his face and pitched over.</p>
  <p>Then the curve of the track shut out the scene, but for five minutes after
  they were out of sight they still got the whoops of the redskins, the shouts
  and curses of the miners, and the crackle of guns like the quick fire of
  a Gatling. You see it came to that before it was through, and there was some
  blood spilled&mdash;a lot of it&mdash;and, not counting Clancy&rsquo;s, it
  wasn&rsquo;t all &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; blood, either.</p>
  <p>Clancy? I&rsquo;m coming to him. No, he wasn&rsquo;t killed&mdash;if he
  had been I&rsquo;d never be telling you this story.</p>
  <p>It was two or three days before Lee and Perley got the details of what happened.
  The redskins fought like fiends after the miners began to fire on them and
  had killed one or two, and, though they were finally subdued, the casualties,
  as I&rsquo;ve said, weren&rsquo;t all on their side by a hanged sight.</p>
  <p>But I was talking about Clancy. Well, that bullet of Perley&rsquo;s caught
  him on the cheek bone, glanced in, plowed through his left eye, and landed
  up somewhere against the cartilage of his nose&mdash;a bullet will make queer
  tracks sometimes, worse than surveyors by a heap. They got him down to Big
  Cloud to a doctor&rsquo;s, and before he was half cured he disappeared. They
  had a sort of makeshift hospital here in those days, and when I say &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; I
  mean they found his bed empty one morning, that was all.</p>
  <p>I told you I didn&rsquo;t know whether Perley had any hand in putting that
  Indian in the car, or the other redskins at the Bend. I don&rsquo;t. I told
  you I didn&rsquo;t know what was between him and the half-breed before all
  this happened. I don&rsquo;t. Perley never said. But day after day as he
  and Lee pounded up and down on the local through the mountains, he began
  to grow silent and moody.</p>
  <p>Lee, young Lee then, was the only one that could get anywhere near the inside
  of his vest. He took to Lee, and Lee liked him; but even Lee had his limits
  when it came to confidences. There was lots Perley never opened his lips
  about. No, I don&rsquo;t know as it makes much difference now.</p>
  <p>Lee was the first of the two to hear that Faro Clancy was &ldquo;loose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks to me like a bad business,&rdquo; he said, after telling
  Perley the news.</p>
  <p>Perley&rsquo;s eyes just narrowed a little. &ldquo;It looks more like a
  bad shot, a rotten bad shot,&rdquo; he answered evenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, if you like,&rdquo; returned Lee; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;ll
  be more to follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One would think you <i>knew</i> Clancy,&rdquo; said Perley, cool
  as ever.</p>
  <p>Lee was anxious. Call it presentiment or what you like, from that moment
  the thing was on his nerves. Perley had been pretty good to him; had made
  things a heap easier for the young fellow, green and raw as he was, in a
  hundred different ways. Things like that mean something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Perley,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard some talk,
  and I know there&rsquo;s something behind all this between you and that devil.
  I&rsquo;m not asking for confidences&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perley cut him short, and caught him almost angrily by the shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  meddle!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Let it drop. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t count
  in this, whatever happens. Your being at the Bend that day was an accident.
  What&rsquo;s between me and Clancy concerns ourselves. You don&rsquo;t count.
  Unless you&rsquo;re looking for another run besides the local, just remember
  that and don&rsquo;t meddle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all. Lee never mentioned it to Perley again. Perley was right,
  wasn&rsquo;t he? I told you there were three men in this story, but that
  one of them didn&rsquo;t count. No, Lee didn&rsquo;t count. Why should he?</p>
  <p>What did he have to do with it? Perley was right, I leave it to you.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve been over the division, and you know the Devil&rsquo;s Slide
  just west of the Gap from here. You know the grade&mdash;the worst in the
  mountains. The trains crawl up at the pace a man could walk, because they
  can&rsquo;t go any faster; and they crawl down just as slowly, because they
  don&rsquo;t dare do anything else.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve seen the passengers get off the observation and walk&mdash;so
  have you. Done it yourself probably? I thought so. Extra engine on the rear
  end to push or hold back, and one in the middle if the train&rsquo;s heavy,
  to keep it from breaking apart&mdash;lessens the drawbar pull, you know.
  They&rsquo;re tunneling now to do away with that particular grade, but that&rsquo;s
  nothing to do with this story, nor, for that matter, with the night, some
  six weeks after that business at the Bend, when the local, eastbound, was
  climbing the Devil&rsquo;s Slide.</p>
  <p>It was a dirty night outside the caboose. A storm had been racketing through
  the mountains all afternoon, and by the time it got dark it was a howling
  gale, raining hard enough to float the ties.</p>
  <p>Lee&rsquo;s place was on the front end, going up that bit of track, but
  he wasn&rsquo;t well that night, and the other brakeman was doing his snatch.
  Touch of mountain fever, or something, nothing serious; just enough to make
  him shiver and boil alternately over the little stove in the caboose, sitting
  with his back to the door. Up above him in the cupola, holding down the swivel
  chair where he could watch the train&mdash;that is, see his engine fling
  up the sparks, for that&rsquo;s about all he could see, I guess&mdash;was
  Perley.</p>
  <p>The car was swinging like a hammock with the heave and strain of the big
  pusher coupled right behind it&mdash;it acts queer, that does. Every time
  I&rsquo;ve felt it I&rsquo;ve always thought of a cat and a mouse. It&rsquo;s
  like the engine had the caboose by the scruff and was trying to shake the
  life out of it.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve felt it a little if you&rsquo;ve ever been in the rear Pullman
  going up&mdash;the difference is that a caboose hasn&rsquo;t any springs
  to speak of, you understand? Racket enough to raise the dead. You couldn&rsquo;t
  hear yourself think. Not so much from the noise of the train or the storm,
  but from the booming roar of the trailer&rsquo;s exhaust&mdash;like she was
  trying to cough her boiler tubes out every time the valves slid.</p>
  <p>Now, there&rsquo;s just one more thing I want you to get. The engine crew
  of a pusher naturally can&rsquo;t see any track, road-bed, or anything of
  that kind, and it isn&rsquo;t their business to, either. All they watch is
  the leader and the intermediate, if there is one. Their headlight plays along
  over a few cars if it&rsquo;s high enough, or loses itself on the top of
  the door or the roof of the caboose if it isn&rsquo;t, understand?</p>
  <p>Lee didn&rsquo;t hear anything. He was sitting bent over with his head between
  his hands, and it was the current of air from the opening door that made
  him twist around and look up, thinking it had blown open. I don&rsquo;t know
  as you&rsquo;d call him a coward; maybe yes, maybe no; anyway, he was a white-faced,
  terrified man that next instant, as he started up from his chair. He never
  got to his feet. Instead, he shut up like a jackknife, and went down to the
  floor with a blow over the head from a revolver butt that knocked him senseless.</p>
  <p>It all happened in a second, but in that second Lee got it with more vividness
  than a thousand hours would have given him&mdash;the great, hulking figure,
  the water trickling to the floor in little pools from the dripping clothes,
  the sickly pallor of the face, the thin new skin of the livid scar across
  the cheek, the sightless eye&mdash;Clancy.</p>
  <p>Lee couldn&rsquo;t have lain unconscious more than twenty minutes, perhaps
  it was only fifteen, for it takes about forty minutes to climb the four miles
  of the Slide, you see. Call it twenty, that allows for what happened before
  and what happened after. When he came to his senses the light in the bracket
  lamp was out; blown out by the draft, for the door was open. A stray beam
  or two from the pusher&rsquo;s headlight filled the caboose with an uncertain,
  wavering light&mdash;from the jolt and swing, you know, though Lee thought
  at first it was his head.</p>
  <p>He tried to get up, but he couldn&rsquo;t move. He was bound hand and foot,
  laid out on the flat of his back&mdash;helpless. For a minute he was too
  dazed to understand, then he remembered&mdash;Clancy. He stared up into the
  cupola above him. The swivel chair was empty&mdash;Perley had gone.</p>
  <p>The car trucks were beating a steady <i>clack, clack-clack</i>, as they
  pounded the fishplates; from behind came the full, deep-chested thunder of
  the trailer&rsquo;s exhaust; around, the hundred noises of the creaking,
  groaning, swaying car; without, the patter of rain, the wail of the wind.
  But over it all, low though it was, came a sound that sent a chill to Lee&rsquo;s
  heart.</p>
  <p>It was like a breathless moan, do you understand? That was the inhuman part
  of it; it was breathless&mdash;there was no break&mdash;a sort of sobbing
  monotone. It came from behind him. Lee shivered as he listened, and then
  his heart began to pound as though it would burst. He was afraid&mdash;<i>afraid</i>.
  Premonition, perhaps; I don&rsquo;t know. He rolled himself over on his side,
  and he saw&mdash;</p>
  <p>How can I tell it! A figure was crouched against the side of the car in
  a half-sitting posture, the face was red&mdash;red with the blood that was
  flowing from the forehead. Lee shrieked aloud in terror. &ldquo;Perley! Perley!&rdquo; Then
  he grew sick with the horror that was on him. Worse than murder the half-breed
  had threatened&mdash;and he had kept his word. Perley had been scalped!</p>
  <p>Lee&rsquo;s cry must have reached the poor wretch&rsquo;s consciousness,
  for he staggered to his feet, sweeping his eyes clear with both hands. Lee,
  sick to the depths of his soul, the sweat breaking out in great, cold drops
  upon his forehead, fought like a maniac with his bonds.</p>
  <p>Perley never spoke, never paid any attention to Lee&mdash;he was past all
  that&mdash;but his brain, at least, was still capable of coherent impression.
  It must have been&mdash;to account for what he did. Right in front of him,
  as he hung there tottering and swaying, was a broken bit of mirror tacked
  up on the side of the car. He was staring into it.</p>
  <p>His moaning stopped. The shock of his own awful horror must have revolted,
  shaken his very being. His hand groped weakly, subconsciously perhaps, for
  his pocket&mdash;his revolver&mdash;the end.</p>
  <p>Again Lee shrieked as he struggled to free himself, and then, as Perley
  fired, he burst out into a peal of wild, discordant laughter. His mind was
  giving way. He began to gibber like a madman&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way they
  found him&mdash;with Perley&rsquo;s body pitched full across his chest.</p>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t ask me. I told you Perley was a little, undersized, sawed-off
  man. I don&rsquo;t know, do I? The halfbreed, physically, could have handled
  him like a baby, once he caught him unawares. That&rsquo;s all I know.</p>
  <p>They buried Perley down at Big Cloud; and they buried Clancy where the posse
  dropped him, drilled full of holes. That&rsquo;s the story.</p>
  <p>Lee? Charlie Lee? Why, he doesn&rsquo;t count, does he? He had nothing to
  do with it. Well, if you&rsquo;re interested in him I&rsquo;ll tell you.
  His college diploma never did him any good. Once he got better and out of
  the hospital, he took to drinking periodically&mdash;<i>hard</i>. Between
  times straight as a string, you understand, for six weeks say, then off again.
  That was fifteen years ago, and he&rsquo;s done it ever since. The doctors
  said that blow on the head unsettled him, skull splinter, or something like
  that; but medicine&rsquo;s not an exact science. The doctors were wrong.
  The trouble was deeper than the skull&mdash;it was in his soul. Lee drank
  to save himself from the madhouse&mdash;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I, that
  some men drink because they have to?</p>
  <p>Carleton, the super, and the men before Carleton, understood what the doctors
  didn&rsquo;t, so Lee&rsquo;s working for the railroad yet. Not braking&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  not fit for that, but he keeps the job they gave him&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
  kept for him&mdash;when he gets back after his spells. I&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  the foreman shouting for me. Sorry, but I&rsquo;ll have to go. &ldquo;If
  you&rsquo;re going out on Number One she&rsquo;s just coming down the gorge
  now. Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I lost him in the shadows of the big mogul on the pit behind me. Then I
  turned and walked slowly out of the roundhouse, over the turntable, and across
  the tracks to the station platform. Number One&rsquo;s mellow chime floated
  down from the gorge, then the flare of the electric headlight, and the rumble
  of the train. And in quick, fierce tempo, the beating, drumming trucks caught
  up the name I had heard the foreman shout, and rang it over and over again
  in my ears:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh-you-Lee! Charlie-Lee! Lee! Charlie-Lee&mdash;Lee!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>11<br>
      <a name="WheresHaggerty"></a>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;The Hill Division was proud enough over it, of course, for Carleton
  was its old chief; but, none the less, it read General Order Number 38 with
  dismay and misgiving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T. J. Hale,&rdquo; the G. O. ran, &ldquo;is hereby appointed Superintendent
  of the Hill Division, with headquarters at Big Cloud, vice H. B. Carleton
  promoted to General Manager of the System.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now who in the double-blanked, blankety-blanked blazes is Hale?&rdquo; demanded
  the roundhouse and the engine crews.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton was all to the good, h&rsquo;m?&mdash;what!&rdquo; growled
  the dispatchers.</p>
  <p>The train crews swung their lanterns with a defiant air, and the passenger
  conductors juggled their punches around their little fingers, smiling a superior
  smile to themselves. Hale might be a good, man, perhaps he was, but Carleton
  was&mdash;&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; Carleton. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll get along
  all right with us, <i>but</i> he don&rsquo;t want to get fresh, that&rsquo;s
  all. Where&rsquo;d he come from, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That question, at first, no one seemed able to answer. The general impression
  was that the Transcontinental had got him from some Eastern road. Certainly
  he was a new man, bran new, to the System.</p>
  <p>And then the renown of one Haggerty, who was braking on a passenger local,
  became great, and, in consequence, the displeasure of the Division increased.</p>
  <p>Said Haggerty: &ldquo;When I was on the Penn five years back, this fellow
  Hale was assistant super. I knew him well. You wanter look out for him, you
  can take my little word for that. He&rsquo;s a holy terror, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
  a fact. Got any chewin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty got his chewing, being an egregious liar; and Hale got a damaged
  reputation for the same reason.</p>
  <p>But Haggerty got more than his chewing&mdash;and he had not long to wait.
  On the day that the new super was expected, Haggerty, on passenger local
  Number Seven, got into Big Cloud about noon, and, taking advantage of the
  ten-minute wait for refreshments, straddled a stool at the lunch-counter.
  Between bites, he fired questions at Spence the dispatcher, who was bolting
  his mid-day meal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hale come yet?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him,&rdquo; replied Spence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When d&rsquo;ye expect him?&rdquo; persisted Haggerty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Spence answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so blasted close!&rdquo; snapped Haggerty. &ldquo;You
  ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; away any weighty secret if you let out what time
  his special &rsquo;ll be along, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard of any special,&rdquo; said Spence. &ldquo;Say,
  Haggerty, they tell me Hale&rsquo;s an old friend of yours, h&rsquo;m? No
  wonder you&rsquo;re anxious. I forgot about that. As soon as I get word about
  him, I&rsquo;ll wire up the line to you so&rsquo;s you can jump your train,
  come back on a hand-car, and be here on the platform to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go to blazes!&rdquo; retorted Haggerty, and scowled across the
  counter at an inoffensive looking little fellow who had taken the liberty
  of smiling at the dispatcher&rsquo;s words.</p>
  <p>At Haggerty&rsquo;s look, the smile disappeared in a cup of coffee raised
  hastily to the lips. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Haggerty, by way of driving
  home to the other the audacity and temerity of his act, and likewise the
  inadvisability of repeating it. Haggerty was galled. Once before that morning
  he had been obliged to relegate this insignificant, squint, eye-glassed individual,
  who had persisted in riding on the platform, to a proper sense of submission.
  And the method employed had been no more delicate a one than that of jerking
  the man bodily into the car by the collar of his coat. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he
  repeated, with rising inflexion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Haggerty,&rdquo; went on Spence pleasantly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  you worry. I won&rsquo;t fail you. When the super steps off the train, and
  the first words he says is, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re
  not here to respond in kind I can plainly see there&rsquo;ll be doings. Oh,
  no, don&rsquo;t you fret, I&rsquo;ll not throw you down on anything like
  that&mdash;&rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be wise for us, that&rsquo;s got to live
  with him, to rile him up at the outset! No, it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t,
  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go bite on a brake-shoe, you&rsquo;re too sharp to be munchin&rsquo; doughnuts,&rdquo; snarled
  Haggerty. And, swinging himself from his seat, he went back to his train.</p>
  <p>An hour later when he reached Elk River, the end of his run, he found a
  telegram waiting for him from Spence. He sucked in his under lip as he read
  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sly joker,&rdquo; wired the dispatcher, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
  you tell us that your friend came up with you on Number Seven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty pushed his cap to the back of his head, and swore softly under
  his breath. He began to go over in his mind the passengers that had been
  aboard the train when they ran into Big Cloud. No one individual seemed to
  stand out carded and waybilled as the new super.</p>
  <p>Then an idea struck Haggerty, and he climbed into the rear coach where Berkely,
  his conductor, was making up his report sheets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Jim,&rdquo; said Haggerty, &ldquo;was there any passes into
  Big Cloud this mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Berkely looked up suspiciously. &ldquo;You mind your own business, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
  get along better!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, punk!&rdquo; returned Haggerty. &ldquo;My count&rsquo;s the same
  as your&rsquo;n, ain&rsquo;t it? What&rsquo;s the matter with you, then?
  Honest, Jim, I wanter know. Was there any passes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; grunted Berkely, cooling down a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, you might have said so at first, instead of jumpin&rsquo; a
  fellow for nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Haggerty, and went out of the car
  to hang meditatively over the handrail and spit reflectively at the ties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t that sting you?&rdquo; he demanded of the universe
  in general. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that sting you? Who ever heard of a new
  super comin&rsquo; on the job ridin&rsquo; a local on a <i>ticket!</i> An&rsquo; me
  askin&rsquo; when he was goin&rsquo; to turn up. Oh, yes, it sure would sting
  you! That funny boy Spence &rsquo;ll pass this along an&rsquo;&mdash;oh,
  punk! I ain&rsquo;t sure it wouldn&rsquo;t have been better if I&rsquo;d
  kept my mouth shut about knowin&rsquo; Hale, but who&rsquo;d ever thought
  he&rsquo;d come up on <i>my</i> train! How was I to know, h&rsquo;m?&rdquo; And
  during all that afternoon&rsquo;s layup at Elk River, Haggerty pondered the
  matter. He continued to ponder it as they pulled out for the return trip
  in the evening, and he was still pondering it when they whistled for Big
  Cloud.</p>
  <p>There was no moon up that night, and it was pretty dark as they ran in.
  Haggerty, with his lantern, was standing on the rear end. As the train slowed
  itself to a halt, a man came tearing down the station platform at a run.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rdquo; he called breathlessly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Haggerty promptly, leaning out over the steps
  and showing his light. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back&mdash;&rdquo; and
  he disappeared in the shadow of the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He acts like he was nutty,&rdquo; muttered Haggerty, and swung himself
  off the steps.</p>
  <p>But, though Haggerty waited, the man did not come back, and he had not come
  back when the train began to roll out of the station, and Haggerty was again
  on the rear platform of the car. Then, just as his hand reached out to open
  the door, he stopped and started suddenly as though he had been stung.</p>
  <p>A voice came out of the darkness from the other side of the track over by
  the roundhouse. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rdquo; it demanded anxiously.</p>
  <p>Then Haggerty tumbled, and his face went red with rage. He leaned far out
  over the rail, and, forgetful that the pantomime was lost in the darkness,
  shook his clinched fist in the direction from whence the voice had come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go to he-ee-ll-lll!&rdquo; he bawled, the exclamation shaken
  into syllables by reason of the car wheels jolting over the siding switches
  at that precise moment. And then, his senses being very acute, from where
  the light shone in the dispatcher&rsquo;s window he thought he heard, above
  the momentarily increasing rattle of the train, a laugh&mdash;a laugh that
  produced anything but a quieting effect on his already outraged sensibilities.</p>
  <p>Now Haggerty was not the nature of those who can pass lightly over a joke
  at their own expense, especially if that joke be too prolonged and carries
  with it a hint of underlying venom. Therefore, as the &ldquo;one on Haggerty&rdquo; spread
  over the division, and scarcely an hour of the day passed that the cry &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
  Haggerty?&rdquo; did not reach his ears, he began to sulk and treasure up
  his injury. The division was rubbing it in pretty hard. But the curious part
  of it all was that his bitterness was not directed against himself who was
  the direct cause of his discomfiture, nor against Spence who was the indirect
  cause, but against Hale, who was no cause at all.</p>
  <p>Just once had Haggerty seen the superintendent. Hale was pointed out to
  him on the platform at Big Cloud, and Haggerty had ducked hastily back inside
  his train. Hale was the inoffensive little fellow he had treated with such
  scant courtesy at the lunch-counter, the insignificant, squint-eye-glassed
  individual he had hauled from the car platform by the coat collar! When Haggerty&rsquo;s
  mingled feelings of perturbation and amazement permitted him any speech at
  all, it was rather incoherent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>That</i>&mdash;the runt!&rdquo; he gasped, and subsided into an
  empty seat.</p>
  <p>And in this inelegant, but pithy, summing up of the capacity and dimensions
  of the new official the division was with him to the last section hand. Him&mdash;a
  railroad man! The Hill Division remembered &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; Carleton and
  was ashamed, and it rankled for the shame that it considered had been put
  upon it. Out of it all, Haggerty was the only thing of saving grace! So upon
  Haggerty they loosened, behind the humor, some of their bitterness. Haggerty
  became the safety valve of the division.</p>
  <p>A month had gone by and Hale had lived well up to what his appearance had
  led them to expect. He might have been an automaton for all the signs of
  life that emanated from his office. Just routine, the routine business, routine,
  that was all. The disquiet and unrest that brooded over the division became
  contempt&mdash;the kind of contempt that made the car-tinks put on airs,
  and in their heart of hearts figure themselves better railroad men than he
  who sat over them in supreme authority.</p>
  <p>Even Haggerty no longer ducked out of sight when circumstances required
  that he should breathe the same air as his superior. Haggerty had acquired
  a swagger; also, he now voiced his opinion, his cordially poor opinion, of
  Mr. Hale without restraint and with no check upon his tongue.</p>
  <p>And then Haggerty got a shock. It was imparted by Spence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got it from Hale&rsquo;s clerk last night,&rdquo; said the dispatcher. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  going to run an inspection special over the division, and he&rsquo;s picked
  out the fag end of all things for the crew. He picked you first, Haggerty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; growled Haggerty, with a scowl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s something behind it, though,&rdquo; Spence
  went on, his voice modulated confidentially. &ldquo;Between you and me,
  Haggerty, the inspection trip is a bluff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty pricked up his ears. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Spence serenely, backing to a safe distance, &ldquo;I
  think he&rsquo;s hurt at the way you&rsquo;ve cut him since he&rsquo;s been
  here. He&rsquo;s pining for your company, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty sprang to his feet from the baggage truck on which he had been
  seated, and shook his fist frantically at the fast retreating figure. He
  was still gesticulating fiercely and muttering savagely to himself when the
  window in the dispatcher&rsquo;s room overhead opened softly, and Spence
  stuck out his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey, there, Haggerty,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;quit practising that
  deaf and dumb alphabet. You haven&rsquo;t got any time to waste. You want
  to run along and get the missus to press out a pair of panties, and iron
  a boiled shirt for you. You&rsquo;ll get your orders in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come down for one minute,&rdquo; choked Haggerty, his rage fanned
  to a white heat by the knowledge of his own impotence, for Spence, as he
  well knew, was safely entrenched behind locked doors. &ldquo;Just one minute,
  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make your face look like it had never been born. I will
  that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haggerty,&rdquo; said Spence in an injured tone, as the window closed, &ldquo;you
  are disgruntled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Haggerty was to be still more disgruntled, for the next morning, true
  to Spence&rsquo;s words, he found himself assigned to Inspection Special
  Number Eighty-nine. Haggerty was not happy; but he boarded the forward car,
  as they pulled out for the mountains with the mental resolution that he would
  keep out of the super&rsquo;s way.</p>
  <p>Resolutions, however, like many other things, are sometimes rudely upset
  in the face of conditions that are not taken into account in the reckoning.
  They had been running at a forty-mile clip, and were about into the yard
  at Coyote Bend, when Haggerty nearly went to the floor as the &ldquo;air&rdquo; came
  on with a sudden rush, and the train came jerking to a halt like a bucking
  bronco. The whistle was going like mad for the block ahead. Haggerty grabbed
  his red flag, dropped to the ground, and ran back past the super&rsquo;s
  car to take his distance.</p>
  <p>Up ahead, he could see the tail end of a freight disappearing around the
  bend, crawling into safety on the siding. Nothing very interesting about
  that, somebody would get Tokio for laying out the Special, he supposed. Maybe
  the freight had had a breakdown, and was off schedule making the Bend. Personally,
  Haggerty did not care. It made very little difference to him. He picked up
  a handful of stones, and began to plug them at the nearest telegraph pole.
  Suddenly he changed the direction of his shots, and let fly with all his
  might at a gopher he had spotted squatting in front of his hole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Mac!&rdquo; he ejaculated in unbounded astonishment. &ldquo;I
  believe I hit the cuss!&rdquo;&mdash;and he went back to see.</p>
  <p>Just as he got down the embankment, the Special began to whistle for her
  flag, &ldquo;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four,&rdquo; and Haggerty,
  scrambling to the track again, began to run. But fast as he ran, he had only
  covered about half the distance when the train began to move. It was, therefore,
  a very breathless and panting Haggerty who just managed to grab the rail
  of the rear car&mdash;the super&rsquo;s car!</p>
  <p>There was nothing for it but to pass through and Haggerty, with his acquired
  swagger, started. The super was alone in the rear compartment, seated at
  a table, a mass of papers before him. Haggerty was industriously rolling
  up his flag as he passed along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haggerty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty stopped and swung around at the sound of his name.</p>
  <p>Hale reached his hand into a box of cigars that lay open on the table, selected
  one carefully, lighted it, and leaned back in his chair. &ldquo;I would like
  to offer you one, Haggerty,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but I am afraid
  you would misunderstand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty shifted a little before the super&rsquo;s look. Somehow, there
  wasn&rsquo;t any squint at all; instead, behind the glasses, the gray eyes
  were remarkably bright and clear, and their steadiness was discomposing&mdash;to
  Haggerty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Hale, a little smile playing around the corners
  of his mouth, &ldquo;that they don&rsquo;t measure men by the same standard
  out West here that they did when we were back on the Penn together, eh?&rdquo; Haggerty
  reddened. His only belief would have been in bluster; but, curiously enough,
  there was something about this little man, he couldn&rsquo;t tell just what,
  that made bluster impossible. Therefore, Haggerty held his peace, and his
  fingers played nervously with the flag, twirling it around and around awkwardly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake, Haggerty,&rdquo; the super continued
  pleasantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to rub it in. I want you to know
  that I&rsquo;ve heard the story. I want you to know that I didn&rsquo;t nose
  it out. I heard it at the lunch-counter that day after you went out, and
  before the men there knew who I was. I want to start straight with you, Haggerty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty was puzzled and flustered at this opening. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he
  blurted out, &ldquo;of course you know it was all a lie. I only did it for
  a josh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; Hale answered. &ldquo;In itself it didn&rsquo;t
  amount to anything, but the consequences are a little more than you reckoned
  on, aren&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s acted like a boomerang, and you&rsquo;re
  pretty sore, Haggerty, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The openness and friendly tones of the super took hold of Haggerty, and
  he warmed toward the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, sir, I suppose I am,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
  <p>Hale nodded. &ldquo;Now, I want you to see the other side of it, Haggerty&mdash;my
  side. No division of any railroad, or anything else for that matter, can
  do itself justice unless everyone connected with it is pulling together <i>for</i> it.
  I want <i>every</i> man out here with me, and first of all I want you. There
  is nothing destroys respect so much as ridicule. The division, much after
  the fashion that an epidemic of measles springs up amongst children, took
  it into their heads to dislike the successor of Mr. Carleton, no matter who
  he might be. Now, unfortunately, instead of having checked the spread, the
  germs are being fostered because, back of their fun with you, a description
  of contempt for me is constantly kept alive. So I want you to cooperate with
  me, Haggerty, and show them that, after all, whether I&rsquo;m a holy terror
  or not, whether I&rsquo;m a runt of a giant, no matter what, I&rsquo;m entitled
  to a fair deal out here in the West. There, Haggerty, that&rsquo;s a pretty
  long sermon for me. I&rsquo;m not much at preaching. Just turn what I&rsquo;ve
  said over in your mind, that&rsquo;s all. I think I can safely offer you
  a cigar now. Will you have one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty accepted the cigar with a flustered mumble of thanks, and as he
  went forward to the other coach he chewed the end pensively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s the little fellow? Hope the ride ain&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; him
  car-sick,&rdquo; sneered Slakely, the conductor.</p>
  <p>Haggerty strode up to the other, and shoved his fist savagely within an
  inch of Slakely&rsquo;s nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know, the super&rsquo;s all right, you walleyed
  coyote, you! I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you he&rsquo;s a <i>man</i>. Do I hear
  any remarks to the contrary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; gasped Slakely blankly, retreating down the aisle, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
  the matter with you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo;&mdash;Haggerty&rsquo;s
  explanation was more forcible than explicit, though the meaning of his clenched
  fist which he shook at the other was pointed enough in its inference. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  what&rsquo;s the matter, my bucko,&rdquo; he repeated fiercely, &ldquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
  you forget it! I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; it to you straight, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  take none of your lip about it neither! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty had raised the standard. Not, perhaps, as the super had expected;
  but according to his own ideas, or rather to his fiery temper which led him
  to act blindly on the spur of the moment as his impulse directed.</p>
  <p>But it was not this method of Haggerty&rsquo;s, if such a term could by
  any stretch of the imagination be applied to Haggerty, that was to bring
  about the desired result, and at the same time rid him of his tormentors&mdash;tormentors
  who continued to sound the cry, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rdquo; with
  undiminished frequency&mdash;tormentors who were much too wary to allow themselves
  to be caught anywhere within striking distance, for Haggerty&rsquo;s forearm
  was a thing to wonder at. Instead, the end came from another source as totally
  different as it was unexpected. It came on the third day of the inspection
  trip, up in the Rockies at the new bridge across the Stony River&mdash;and
  it was the new bridge that did it.</p>
  <p>They were to lay out there for the morning, and Haggerty started in to employ
  the two or three hours of leisure this gave him by looking over the work.
  It wasn&rsquo;t much of a bridge as bridges go, for the Stony wasn&rsquo;t
  much of a river; but the approaches were enough to pull the heart out of
  the stoutest bridge crew that ever toiled and sweated and slaved. Just rock,
  solid, gray, massive; and so it was blast, blast, blast, hour after hour
  all through the day, day after day. One span, resting on the shore abutments,
  was to bridge the ca&ntilde;on that yawned six hundred feet below, where the Stony
  swirled and eddied, a foaming, angry, chattering, little stream.</p>
  <p>On the eastern side, where Haggerty stood, the anchorage was pretty well
  under way, but over across on the western shore they were still pitting their
  blasting powder against the stubborn rock of the mountainside. Haggerty crossed
  over on the old bridge to take a look at this. Just as he reached the other
  side a stationary engine blew shrilly for a blast, and the men began to run
  for cover. Haggerty pulled his watch and marked the time&mdash;one minute
  and fifteen seconds. Then the blast thundered, echoed, reechoed, and died
  away through the mountains. He joined the men as they went back to their
  work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Mac!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the foreman, as he peered over the
  edge of the excavation and looked down some fifteen or twenty feet to the
  ledge where the men were already busy again. &ldquo;Holy Mac! You&rsquo;ve
  got to look sharp, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; replied the foreman. &ldquo;We give &rsquo;em
  plenty of time. When the whistle blows the men hump it. We don&rsquo;t touch
  the button till the last one is crawlin&rsquo; over the top of the bank.
  Then, with the time fuse, there&rsquo;s a minute, lots of time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haggerty looked on for awhile, then he turned away, sat down by one of the
  shanties, and loaded his pipe. The pipe once alight, he settled himself in
  a more comfortable position by sprawling on his back, his hands under his
  head. From where he lay, he commanded a view of the other side of the river
  as well as the work before him. He could see Hale across there talking to
  one of the bridge engineers. He watched the two men lazily, in drowsy contentment,
  until he lost sight of them as they started to come over to his side, then
  his attention became riveted again on his immediate surroundings.</p>
  <p>They were getting ready for another blast. Haggerty sat up. It was rather
  exciting to see the men come scrambling out of the hole. The whistle had
  just gone three toots. They were coming now, one head after another popping
  up over the edge, then the shoulders, and finally the men on their feet running
  like deers for shelter&mdash;not far, only a few yards, for the excavation
  itself afforded protection, once clear of it. Haggerty himself was not fifteen
  yards away.</p>
  <p>He counted the men as they came out. It was the eighteenth who, just as
  his head and shoulders appeared, waved an arm and shouted: &ldquo;All out.
  Let &lsquo;er go!&rdquo; He saw the foreman bend over the battery and make
  the connection that would spark the timefuse at the other end, and then a
  groan of horror went up around him. Number Eighteen, with a cry and a desperate
  effort to pull himself over the top, had slipped back and disappeared from
  sight!</p>
  <p>Haggerty&rsquo;s pipe dropped to the ground from between his teeth, his
  heart seemed to stop its beats, a cold sweat broke out upon his face. He
  was on his feet now, and the foreman&rsquo;s words were ringing in his ears: &ldquo;Then
  there&rsquo;s a minute, lots of time! <i>Then there&rsquo;s a minute, lots
  of time!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He began to run, and the seconds, as he ran, lengthened into years and cycles. &ldquo;My
  God!&rdquo; he muttered in a catchy way.</p>
  <p>But fast as he ran, someone was faster than he. Five yards from the edge
  of the excavation, a figure, small, short, speeding like the wind, passed
  him. It was Hale&mdash;the super!</p>
  <p>Behind, the foreman&rsquo;s voice bellowed hoarsely: &ldquo;Come back! Come
  back! Ye can&rsquo;t get to the fuse! D&rsquo;ye hear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; mumbled Haggerty between his teeth, &ldquo;mabbe we
  can get the <i>man</i>. Mary, Mother, help us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hale, flat on the ground, was making to swing himself over as Haggerty,
  for the second time, caught him by the collar of his coat. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t
  strong enough,&rdquo; he grunted, yanking the super back. &ldquo;You help
  me from the top &ldquo;&mdash;and over the edge he went himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s a minute, lots of time!&rdquo;&mdash;the words
  came again unbidden. How much, in God&rsquo;s name how much, of that minute
  had gone, how much was left? His teeth were set, his heart pounds so fierce
  and rapid that his breath came hard and choked, as he lowered himself to
  a little ledge, projecting out some seven or eight feet below the surface
  that had caught and held the body of Number Eighteen. The man lay there groaning.
  It was easy to see what had happened. A misplaced step in the climb, then
  a loosened rock, his balance gone, and the stone had crashed down upon his
  legs and ankles.</p>
  <p>There was a look of helpless terror in the eyes of the wounded man as Haggerty
  reached and bent over him. &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; the white lips quivered. &ldquo;You
  ain&rsquo;t got time. I give the signal. The blast &rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a minute, lots of time,&rdquo; said Haggerty in a sing-song,
  crazy way. He was trying to fit the words to an air he had heard somewhere.
  Queer he couldn&rsquo;t remember it, the words were straight enough! Then
  he laughed&mdash;foolishly&mdash;as he worked like a madman!</p>
  <p>He had raised the man in his arms and now, heaving with all his strength,
  was gradually pushing him up, up. The strain became terrific. Haggerty&rsquo;s
  muscles cracked. One of his arms was almost useless to him owing to the narrowness
  of the ledge that, to maintain even a precarious footing as, little by little,
  he rose to an upright position, forced him tight against the wall of rock
  and earth. Haggerty panted with cruel, gasping sobs. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s
  a minute, lots of time!&rdquo; The repetition of the words came surging upon
  him with a shock of horror, lending him a frenzied strength. A desperate
  twist, and he had made the halfturn that brought his back to the cutting.
  His other arm was free now. A heave, and he had swung Number Eighteen above
  his shoulders within reach of the super&rsquo;s outstretched hands. A second
  more, and, with Hale pulling above and Haggerty lifting below, the man, with
  a cry of agony as his wounded leg banged limply against the ground, was forced
  up over the bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Haggerty! For God&rsquo;s sake, be quick yourself,&rdquo; cried
  Hale. &ldquo;Hurry, man, <i>hurry!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a minute&rdquo;&mdash;Haggerty sprang for the top of
  the bank, clutched it&mdash;&ldquo;lots of&mdash;&rdquo; The last word was
  blotted out as he dragged himself over the edge, and heard Hale&rsquo;s sharp
  command: &ldquo;Lie flat!&rdquo; From behind and below him came the roar
  of the detonation, he felt the ground shake and quiver beneath him, the echoes
  were rolling and reverberating like a park of artillery&mdash;then Hale&rsquo;s
  low, fervent: &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Hale who got it first as the mob of men rushed forward, cheering,
  laughing, gabbling hysterically. And it was at Hale&rsquo;s uplifted hand
  that the clamor died suddenly away, and in its stead came the super&rsquo;s
  voice in quiet tones: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Haggerty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, gwan!&rdquo; sputtered Haggerty sheepishly, trying to fight his
  way out of the crowd that pressed upon him to haul and maul him, to thump
  his back, to shake his hand. &ldquo;Aw, gwan! I wanter get me pipe that I
  left over by the shanty.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>12<br>
      <a name="McQueensHobby"></a>McQueen&rsquo;s Hobby</b></h2>
  <p>There isn&rsquo;t much use in talking about the logical or the illogical
  when you come to couple up with a man&rsquo;s hobby, because a hobby is a
  hobby and that&rsquo;s all there is to it&mdash;with nothing left to be said
  on the subject. Most men have a hobby. McQueen&rsquo;s was coal&mdash;just
  coal.</p>
  <p>McQueen talked coal with a persistence that was amazing. On all occasions
  and under any pretext it was coal. Was he off schedule with a regularity
  that entailed his presence on the carpet before the division superintendent,
  it was coal. Did he break down between meeting-points with the attendant
  result that the dispatchers fretted and fumed and swore as they readjusted
  their schedules and rearranged their train sheets, it was coal. Everlastingly
  and eternally coal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s coal?&rdquo; McQueen would demand oracularly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  carbon and oxygen and hydrogen with a dash of nitrogen, ain&rsquo;t it? Well,
  then, what are you talking about? Coal <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> just coal, some
  of it&rsquo;s mostly slate. Two hundred and ten pounds all the way, all the
  time, with the grate bars cluttered with that, huh! What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No purchasing agent that had ever hit the division had been quite able to
  satisfy McQueen with the brand of the commodity that was supplied in accordance
  with the requisition orders that he drew. And so, day in and day out, big
  802 puffed her way through the mountains, and McQueen, in the cab, absorbed
  coal statistics, coal data, coal everything, with an avidity, a thoroughness,
  and a masterliness of detail, that would have put some noted geologists to
  shame and given the rest a run to hold their rights on the marked-up schedule.</p>
  <p>Up at headquarters&mdash;when things were running smoothly and McQueen was
  behaving himself with no scores chalked up against him on the time-card&mdash;they
  treated his hobby as a joke. So that when his whistle boomed out of the gorge
  to the westward, or shrilled across the cut to the eastward, followed a moment
  afterward by the sight of the big, flying mogul with her string of slewing
  dark-green coaches, the staff on duty at Big Cloud would lean from the upper
  windows and watch the Limited as she shattered the yard switches with a roar&mdash;watch
  as, with a hiss of the air and the grinding of the brake shoes as they sparked
  the tires, she would draw up, panting, at the platform, and the big engineer
  would swing himself from the cab for an oil around. Then the badinage flew
  thick and fast while McQueen swabbed his hands on a hunk of waste and punctuated
  the remarks with squirts from his long-spouted can as he filled the thirsty
  oil cups.</p>
  <p>So the big fellows laughed and joked, and the Brotherhood chaffed him unmercifully.</p>
  <p>If anyone had asked McQueen what had started, let alone caused him to exhaust
  the subject of coal with such painstaking and conscientious insistence, he
  couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him have answered. It had started&mdash;just
  started, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;and, fascinating him, had pursued its insidious
  advance unchecked and unquestioned&mdash;that is, unquestioned until one
  morning when Clarihue, the turner at the Big Cloud roundhouse, kind of jerked
  him up a little on the proposition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re against the red, you and your coal, Mac, all right,
  all right,&rdquo; Clarihue chuckled, as the engineer came in to sign on for
  the day&rsquo;s run.</p>
  <p>McQueen was patting 802&rsquo;s slide bars affectionately. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
  that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oil?&rdquo; repeated McQueen, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure thing! No more coal&mdash;no more slate&mdash;no more cinders&mdash;you
  touch her off, and there you are! You&rsquo;ll have to cut out the coal and
  plug up on oil, Mac.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said McQueen, enlightened. &ldquo;Oil-burners, eh? I
  saw one of &rsquo;em down East. They&rsquo;re evil smelling, inhuman, stinking
  brutes, that&rsquo;s what they are! don&rsquo;t you let &rsquo;em side track
  you like that, son. They may do down there, but not in the hills. Not while
  you and me are pulling throttles, and don&rsquo;t you think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clarihue grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, mabbe,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But say, honest, Mac, what&rsquo;s
  the sense of gassing about coal the way you do? What&rsquo;s to come out
  of it? What&rsquo;s the good of it? You just get the laugh from the boys,
  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>McQueen&rsquo;s answer was to scratch his head. To put the matter into the
  concrete class of practicability was a phase of the subject that he had not
  considered. He scratched his head when the turner had gone; and, also, he
  scratched his head for several days thereafter. Then he caught at a happy
  inspiration whereby to solve the riddle, and therein he fell&mdash;but of
  that in a moment.</p>
  <p>Things were booming on the Hill Division. Traffic was doubled, trebled.
  Everything on the train sheets was in sections. Promotions flew thick and
  fast. Wipers were set to firing, and the firemen moved over to the right-hand
  side of the cabs. Every wheel the division could beg, borrow or steal was
  doing fancy time stunts smashing records. Everyone from car-tink to superintendent,
  was on the jump. Even the directors, not to be outdone in the general order
  of things, worked overtime rubbing fat hands in gleeful anticipation of juicy,
  luscious dividends to be; only <i>they</i> neglected to figure in Noonan
  as an item on the balance sheets.</p>
  <p>Noonan? Where is the Brotherhood that does not number among its members
  men with grievances, fancied or real? Noonan had a grievance,&mdash;no particular
  grievance, just a grievance&mdash;and Noonan was a power in that branch of
  the Brotherhood that held sway over the Hill Division. Noonan always had
  a grievance; due, primarily, to the fact that he had a deep and long-seated
  grudge against himself. It dated way back&mdash;he&rsquo;d been born that
  way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grievances!&rdquo; he spluttered to a group of his admirers. &ldquo;Grievances?
  Why, we&rsquo;re against the worst of it all the time. We&rsquo;re not track-walkers,
  are we? Well then, who runs the road? It&rsquo;s us on the throttles, what?
  Who&rsquo;s to blame for our measly schedule of hours and pay? We are, &rsquo;cause
  we haven&rsquo;t the sand to stand up for our rights. That&rsquo;s what,
  and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a chorus of assent. &ldquo;Noonan&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said one
  Devins, &ldquo;only it don&rsquo;t look to me like now was what you might
  rightly call the time to growl. Times are good, everything&rsquo;s double-headed,
  and the paycar&rsquo;s running carload lots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noonan glared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the brains of a piston head, that&rsquo;s
  what you have,&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s times like these we&rsquo;d
  win hands down. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to wait till there&rsquo;s nothing
  doing, and they&rsquo;re laying the boys off and everybody, mostly, is running
  spare! What chance d&rsquo;ye think any demands would stand then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of a truth it was the accepted time and a most glorious opportunity. In
  that, Noonan was right. Only one obstacle lay between him and the accomplishment
  of his cherished ambition to make something of his trouble-hunting proclivities
  and become a leader of men&mdash;in a strike. That obstacle was McQueen.</p>
  <p>McQueen was a company man. Out and out a company man; though nothing would
  have surprised McQueen more than to learn that he was looked up to as a leader
  by the conservative element of the Brotherhood. True, he and his coal was
  the joke of the division; but that was only a joke, and in no wise to be
  held up against him. His influence, of whose existence he was oblivious,
  was based on things apart from that. Big, kindly, honest, incapable of deceit,
  simple, straight-forward, staunch in his friendships, somewhat inclined to
  stubborness in his beliefs perhaps, easily ruffled but as easily pacified,
  such was McQueen. Such was the McQueen the officials honored, and such was
  the McQueen with whom the boys would gladly and loyally have shared their
  pay checks to the last cent.</p>
  <p>All this Noonan knew. Knew, too, that to gain his end he must first win
  over McQueen. And to that object he began to devote himself. He and McQueen
  shared the honors of the fast mail, and under ordinary conditions communication
  between the two men was limited to a flirt of the hand from the cab as one
  or other of them tore by the siding designated as their meeting-point by
  the lords of the road, the dispatchers. But now things were a bit different,
  everything was more or less off schedule. And while the Limited, East and
  West, was nursed along as near her running time as possible, and generally
  got the best of it over everything else, there were, nevertheless, occasions
  when both men were stalled together on time orders at the same point.</p>
  <p>Noonan tackled McQueen at the first opportunity.</p>
  <p>He picked his way cautiously as though not quite sure of his rights and
  ready for a quick reverse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Mac,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;what do you think of all this talk
  that&rsquo;s going &rsquo;round?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talk?&rdquo; said McQueen. &ldquo;What talk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; gasped Noonan, in well-simulated
  surprise, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t heard it? And the boys are slinging
  it pretty hot, at that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anything,&rdquo; McQueen answered, slightly
  suspicious that Noonan was about to spring one at his expense. &ldquo;What
  you giving us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Straight,&rdquo; confided Noonan earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strike,
  Mac, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; ejaculated McQueen, bewildered. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for!&rdquo; cried Noonan. &ldquo;What for? That&rsquo;s a sweet
  question to ask. Well, pretty dashed near everything,&rdquo;&mdash;he waved
  his hand expansively&mdash;&ldquo;hours, scale, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>McQueen shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kicking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t see anything to strike about. Looks to me as though you fellows
  were hunting trouble. You&rsquo;ll probably get it, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never see anything,&rdquo; Noonan blurted out, irritation getting
  the better of diplomacy. &ldquo;Nothing but the blamed coal you&rsquo;re
  forever yapping about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I know about coal,&rdquo; returned McQueen with dignity, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
  never know. It&rsquo;s a subject that requires brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; Noonan jeered. &ldquo;You tell it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It requires brains,&rdquo; McQueen repeated stolidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that the only man on the division that has &rsquo;em,
  don&rsquo;t know how to use &rsquo;em, then,&rdquo; Noonan prodded. &ldquo;Who
  cares about your blazing old coal and what it&rsquo;s made of? Talk&rsquo;s
  cheap. There&rsquo;s no sense to it, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe there isn&rsquo;t, and then again maybe there is. At any rate,
  there&rsquo;s a dollar a day for every man pulling a throttle,&rdquo; McQueen
  announced triumphantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet just how much for the
  firemen, I haven&rsquo;t figured it on their schedule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noonan pricked up his ears. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, Mac,&rdquo; he
  demanded.</p>
  <p>Here was McQueen&rsquo;s vindication. They&rsquo;d laugh at his absurd,
  pointless theories on coal, would they? Well then, he&rsquo;d show them!
  And it wasn&rsquo;t any of their business, either, how many days he&rsquo;d
  racked his brains, puzzling out an adequate solution to the question Clarihue
  had flung at him! He shook two impressive fat fingers at Noonan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One dollar a day, every day, and the spare men proportionately, that&rsquo;s
  what! Do you get that, Noonan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; said Noonan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go into the
  shops for repairs. You need new stay-bolts on your dome cover!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never you mind my dome cover,&rdquo; McQueen flung back, beginning
  to get exasperated. &ldquo;It may need a little tinkering, but it&rsquo;s
  not ready for the scrap-heap yet, the way some are I could mention&mdash;but
  won&rsquo;t. It all goes back to what I said. It&rsquo;s a subject that requires
  brains&mdash;which you haven&rsquo;t got. There&rsquo;s no use explaining
  anything to you because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Noonan interrupted craftily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  only long on wind, Mac.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You listen to me, you rust-jointed disgrace to the throttle!&rdquo; cried
  McQueen, stung into retort. &ldquo;You listen to me! What are you paid for?
  Mileage, ain&rsquo;t it? How do you get your mileage? Steam! What makes steam?
  Coal! D&rsquo;ye hear? Coal! Coal, and don&rsquo;t you forget it. Well then,
  poor coal means poor steam, and poor steam means poor mileage, don&rsquo;t,
  it, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noonan burst into a loud and derisive guffaw.</p>
  <p>McQueen glared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wild, uneducated, hee-hawing ass!&rdquo; he
  choked. &ldquo;What do you know, anyway? Nothing! But <i>I</i> know! A dollar
  a day I said, and I say so now. I figured it out. It&rsquo;s the difference
  between high grade coal and the muck we burn. It&rsquo;s the difference between
  the mileage we make and the mileage we <i>could</i> make in the same time.
  That totes up one dollar a day. Supposing they wouldn&rsquo;t let us have
  any more mileage than they do now, well, we&rsquo;d do it in better time,
  and the difference would be ours, wouldn&rsquo;t it? And time&rsquo;s money.
  And <i>that</i> totes up one dollar a day just the same. It&rsquo;s the same
  either way&mdash;time or mileage. Take your choice!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, Johnny, that&rsquo;s a good boy, run along and fetch me a
  bucket of steam,&rdquo; Noonan scoffed.</p>
  <p>With a snort of unutterable contempt, McQueen turned to swing himself into
  his cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Mac,&rdquo; Noonan cried, afraid that he had overstepped
  himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get whiffy. I swear, I believe you&rsquo;re right.
  Let&rsquo;s see how you figure it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And McQueen, mollified, figured it. Figured it with the stub of a pencil
  in greasy, scrawling characters on the back of a time order. As to the process
  by which the conclusion was arrived at, that was something of which Noonan
  was in profound and utter ignorance. Whether it was right or wrong, he did
  not know. He never knew&mdash;and cared less! Certainly the result was there.</p>
  <p>McQueen completed the last figure of his calculation with a flourish. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he
  cried exultingly. &ldquo;How about it now, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noonan took the paper, wrinkled his brows, pursed his lips, and stared at
  it with the air of a connoisseur of calculus. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said
  he slowly, &ldquo;are you dead sure it&rsquo;s right, Mac?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; McQueen fairly yelled, touched in another tender spot. &ldquo;Right!
  Confound you, it&rsquo;s there in black and white, ain&rsquo;t it? Figures
  don&rsquo;t lie, do they? Well, what in thunder&rsquo;s wrong with you, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to be sure, Mac, that&rsquo;s all. Holy fishplates, I knew
  it was bad, rotten bad, but I didn&rsquo;t think they were handing it to
  us like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet it&rsquo;s bad. It&rsquo;s the worst ever. There&rsquo;s
  more kinds of coal than there are spikes in the right of way from here to
  Big Cloud and back again, but the coal we get is the last on the list. Bad!
  It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always said, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fierce!&rdquo; continued Noonan with rising emphasis. &ldquo;And
  when the boys hear this, it&rsquo;ll be the last straw. They&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fix who?&rdquo; inquired McQueen, blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, ain&rsquo;t I telling you! The company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was talking about the coal,&rdquo; said McQueen a little
  uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure you were,&rdquo; Noonan agreed heartily. &ldquo;Sure you were,
  and how the company is robbing every engineer on the division of a dollar
  a day, to say nothing of the firemen and the train crews. It&rsquo;s enough
  to make a man mad. Well, I should say yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say the company was robbing us,&rdquo; protested
  McQueen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; cried Noonan sharply; then in apparent
  disgust: &ldquo;So your crazy old figures are just gas-bag filling like the
  rest of your coal talk, eh? They <i>did</i> look pretty scaly, and that&rsquo;s
  a fact. I had my suspicions. That&rsquo;s why I asked you if you were sure
  they were right. But I might have known they weren&rsquo;t without asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you might, might you?&rdquo; exploded McQueen, goaded once more
  into angry outburst. &ldquo;You and your suspicions! Who are you! I tell
  you they are right, and that&rsquo;s the end of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if they&rsquo;re right, why don&rsquo;t you stand by them,
  then? We&rsquo;re being robbed every day we work, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-e-es, I suppose we are,&rdquo; McQueen admitted reluctantly; &ldquo;but
  I didn&rsquo;t figure it out for the purpose of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; Noonan interrupted unctuously, &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
  for you nor me to say the purpose it&rsquo;s to be put to. There&rsquo;s
  others besides us. But I do say, Mac, you&rsquo;re almighty smart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>McQueen shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a company man,&rdquo; he said dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Company man! Of course you are. We&rsquo;re all company men. But
  right&rsquo;s right and wrong&rsquo;s wrong before anything else. Well, ta
  ta, Mac, see you again. I&rsquo;m off. There&rsquo;s Hake with the tissue.
  I&rsquo;ll tell the boys where you stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a somewhat dazed McQueen that in turn pulled himself up into his
  own cab. He stood in the gangway and squinted meditatively at the coal heaped
  high on the tender. To his conscientious self-communion, his triumphant vindication
  had somewhat the appearance of a boomerang. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
  reflected. &ldquo;It is damn poor coal, and&mdash;and figures <i>don&rsquo;t</i> lie.
  We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been getting the worst of it, and&mdash;and a man <i>should</i> stand
  up for his rights.&rdquo; And while McQueen, busy with new and momentous
  problems, was steaming west into the Rockies, Noonan, with his tongue in
  his cheek, was cutting along for Big Cloud with a wide-flung throttle.</p>
  <p>That night, at Big Cloud, Noonan&rsquo;s cronies got the story. That is,
  they got what Noonan saw fit to tell them. And the burden of his tale was
  that McQueen was with the Brotherhood and against the company. That was sufficient.
  They looked with appreciative admiration at the man who had done the trick,
  and then they flew to obey his orders.</p>
  <p>By morning, every engineer on the division had the news. On way freights,
  on stray freights, on regulars, specials, and sections, they got it&mdash;every
  last one of them. And McQueen coming east again on Number Two got it, and
  marvelled a little at his new importance, never seeing Noonan&rsquo;s hand
  in the marked deference paid to him.</p>
  <p>First and last it was a bad business. Bad for the company, bad for the hot
  heads led by Noonan, bad for the others, and bad for McQueen. It caught the
  company none too well prepared, and Carleton, for this happened in the days
  of his superintendency, was hard put to it to move anything. There was pretty
  bitter feeling; and before it was over there was blood spilled. But the roughs
  at Big Cloud, who didn&rsquo;t know the pilot from a horn-block, were responsible
  for the most of that, though, in their own way, too, they ended it.</p>
  <p>It came to a show-down the night they carried young Carl Davis home from
  the yard on a door they had wrenched from a box-car. Davis was braking in
  the yard then, and he was a nephew of McQueen&rsquo;s. He had lived with
  the engineer ever since, as a little chap of ten, he had come out to the
  West. Childless themselves, McQueen and his wife thought as much of the lad
  as though he had been their own.</p>
  <p>McQueen in his grief didn&rsquo;t get the rights of it. Only in a confused
  sort of a way he understood the roughs had winged the boy with a cowardly
  shot, meaning perhaps to do no more than shoot out his lamp as he swung by
  on the top of a car. And while his wife with tender hands busied herself
  in rendering such assistance to the surgeon as she could, McQueen sat in
  a chair and stared, dry-eyed and bitter of heart, at the white face on the
  bed.</p>
  <p>Also McQueen was getting sense. Certainly, he had never intended to strike.
  Now, the shock of Carl&rsquo;s hurt had sobered his judgment and he saw things
  as he should have seen them, saw them as he cursed himself for not having
  seen them before he had allowed his senseless egotism to carry him off his
  feet. As the thoughts came crowding through his brain, his cheeks burned
  dull red at his own shame. But through it all he blamed only himself, with
  never an inkling that he had been used as a cat&rsquo;s-paw by the crafty
  Noonan&mdash;that was to come afterward.</p>
  <p>McQueen waited only to wring a half-grudging assurance from the doctor that
  the boy would pull through, then he took his hat and left the house. It was
  getting on toward eleven o&rsquo;clock when he walked into the hall across
  from the station where the boys had their headquarters, and had been in the
  habit of congregating each night ever since the strike began. Usually noisy
  in a good-natured, devil-may-care way, there was a subdued and serious quiet
  pervading the room as McQueen stepped in. The shooting in the yard was something
  they had not counted on and, like McQueen, it was acting on them as a tonic.
  All except Noonan who, evidently bolstered up with a few drinks, was more
  noisy, hilarious and quarrelsome than ever.</p>
  <p>McQueen answered the questions they crowded at him as to the boy&rsquo;s
  condition soberly, and going over to Noonan took him by the arm and led him
  into a corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The game ain&rsquo;t worth it,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  had my lesson to-night and I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Noonan aggressively. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
  have anything to do with it. We&rsquo;re not responsible, are we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said McQueen sturdily. &ldquo;Morally responsible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Morally responsible!&rdquo; Noonan mocked with a sneer. &ldquo;Oh,
  mamma, listen to him! Streak of yellow, that&rsquo;s you, McQueen.&rdquo; Then
  fiercely: &ldquo;You play the scab and I&rsquo;ll bash your head to jelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; retorted McQueen contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drunk, eh? I&rsquo;m not so drunk but that I know who&rsquo;s running
  this strike. It&rsquo;s me, and don&rsquo;t you forget it! And what I says
  goes, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you to call it off. Blood on our heads I won&rsquo;t
  stand for. Our grievances don&rsquo;t warrant what&rsquo;s likely to happen
  here if things go on. You owe it to the men who followed you into the strike,
  Noonan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I do, do I? Followed <i>me</i> into the strike, eh? How about
  the men that followed <i>you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That followed me?&rdquo; repeated McQueen in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, that followed you! You didn&rsquo;t think I took any stock
  in your batty coal talk, did you? You must think I&rsquo;m green! All I wanted
  was <i>you</i>&mdash;you bit fast and easy enough&mdash;the rest of the softies
  came along then like a pack of sheep. What d&rsquo;ye think now about <i>me</i> owing
  it all to the men, Mr. Morally Responsible, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took McQueen a minute to get the whole of it&mdash;the bitter whole of
  it. Then the blood rushed to his face in a crimson flood. He reached out
  and grasping Noonan by neck and shoulders shook him as a terrier shakes a
  rat. &ldquo;You cur!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, and flung the other suddenly
  away against the wall.</p>
  <p>The men at the sound of the scuffle came running over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a scab! Kill him!&rdquo; shrieked Noonan.</p>
  <p>McQueen turned to face the men. &ldquo;If beating this strike&rsquo;s a
  scab, I&rsquo;m a scab,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out to
  beat it right now! I&rsquo;ve been a fool and I&rsquo;m ready to admit it.
  But I didn&rsquo;t know until to-night that I&rsquo;d been bait for a whining
  thing like that!&rdquo; pointing at Noonan. &ldquo;He says some of you men
  came in on the strike because I did. If that&rsquo;s so, then get out of
  it because I do. Get out of it before there&rsquo;s more on our hands than
  we&rsquo;ll be able to answer for when we go into Division for the last time.
  That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say. I&rsquo;m going over now to ask Carleton
  to put me on again, if it&rsquo;s nothing better than pulling a way freight.
  And&mdash;and I hope you&rsquo;ll come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the flood follows the fracture in the dam, so the breaking of the tension
  filled the room with pandemonium. Cheers, yells, hisses, curses, shouts&mdash;the
  Brotherhood was divided against itself. But ten minutes later, the majority
  of them were clustered behind McQueen in the super&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>Carleton and his staff were sleeping at headquarters those days, and they
  gathered in a group around the green-shaded lamp on the dispatcher&rsquo;s
  table to face the delegation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Carleton,&rdquo; McQueen began, &ldquo;we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all. He never got any further. From the platform outside came hoots
  and cat-calls, and above the chorus Noonan&rsquo;s voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soak the scab! Kill him! If he&rsquo;s so fond of it, let him have
  it! <i>Now!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The window pane was shivered with a crash, and McQueen, struck full in the
  head by a huge hunk of coal, sank without so much as a moan to the floor.</p>
  <p>They cured him of brain fever in the course of time all right, but they
  never cured him of coal. Up and down from one end of the division to the
  other, when he got around again, he talked coal harder than ever&mdash;it
  was his business. McQueen was doing the buying for the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with what I said about coal,&rdquo; he
  asserts with a smile, when the boys put it up to him. &ldquo;Not for a minute!
  Good coal makes better steam, better everything, and pays the company. They
  saw that all right. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m buying it, see? As for figuring
  it into the schedule, the sum was too hard and they couldn&rsquo;t do it.
  Me? Oh, I can&rsquo;t, either, I lost the paper I did it for Noonan on. I
  ain&rsquo;t so good on figures as I was, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>13<br>
      <a name="TheRebate"></a>The Rebate</b></h2>
  <p>He was known as Dutchy, but his name was Damrosch.</p>
  <p>This is Dutchy&rsquo;s story when Dutchy and the Transcontinental were in
  the making; and before, as has been recorded elsewhere, he came to Big Cloud.
  He started railroading as cook&rsquo;s helper on a construction gang that
  was laying track across the prairie. As the mileage grew, so Dutchy grew.
  At first lank and lean, he took on, little by little, the appearance of being
  comfortably nourished, until, by the time they hit the Rockies, Dutchy&rsquo;s
  gait had become a waddle and his innocent blue eyes were almost hidden by
  the great rolls of fat that puffed out his face like a toy balloon. Then
  Dutchy, slow of body and likewise of brain, and yearning for a quiet and
  peaceful existence, secured the lunch-counter rights for Dry Notch.</p>
  <p>Now, Dry Notch, half-way across the prairie, consisted of a water-tank,
  a small roundhouse, a smaller station and a diminutive general store. But
  because of its geographical position, it was headquarters for the Mid-Plains
  Division.</p>
  <p>Here, T. V. Brett was superintendent; Thornley was his chief clerk; and
  MacDonald was dispatcher. And these, with the railroad hands and train-crews
  comprised the population of Dry Notch, unless there might be added a few
  ranchers somewhere in the neighborhood.</p>
  <p>The staff bunked in a room over the station, and the men had their quarters
  in the roundhouse, but one and all they ate at Dutchy&rsquo;s counter. Sinkers
  and coffee, apple pie and sandwiches they stood as a steady diet for a month
  after he had appeared upon the scene, and then a delegation waited upon him
  and demanded dishes more substantial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can make meat pies and chicken stew and all that sort of thing,
  can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; they demanded. &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Dutchy. &ldquo;But
  dot iss oxpensive.&rdquo; Money was no object, they assured him, and thereupon
  proceeded to fix a schedule of prices&mdash;fifteen cents for a meat pie;
  twenty cents for a chicken stew&mdash;with two slices of bread and butter
  thrown in for good measure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil,&rdquo; said Dutchy, &ldquo;so iss it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And a few nights later, true to his promise, they got their chicken stew&mdash;canned
  chicken stew.</p>
  <p>The huge pot, full to the brim, had been emptied, and Dutchy, his face beaming
  with smiles, had bustled into the back room for a further supply, when MacDonald&rsquo;s
  voice rose plaintively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>chicken</i>, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The crowd looked inquiringly at the dispatcher.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; went on MacDonald softly, &ldquo;I&mdash;never heard
  of any chickens, in Dry Notch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, amid the laughter that ensued, Thornley rose dramatically from
  his seat, and, picking up a bone from his plate, waved it aloft.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, this is no time for mirth!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We
  are the victims of a swindle. We are in the clutch of an octopus&mdash;that
  is to say, a food trust, composed of Dutchy and the dining-car conductors
  of Numbers One and Two. It is my painful duty to assert that I recognize
  this bone as the identical bone on which I fed two nights ago coming up the
  line on Number One.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy entered, staggering under the load of the replenished pot, when Thornley
  solemnly demanded a rebate on the spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vat iss it?&rdquo; said Dutchy, halting and peering anxiously into
  the pot; then, evidently reassured that no essential ingredient had been
  forgotten, he looked up at the ring of faces that were regarding him with
  grave inquiry. &ldquo;Vat iss a repate?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;It something
  iss mit der bread und butter for twenty cents to go, yess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The crowd roared, and up and down the division train-crews, engine-crews,
  and section-gangs got the joke and passed it on until the lunch-counter became
  known to every man on the system as &ldquo;The Rebate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They did not explain the joke to Dutchy, and for days he endured the chaff
  stolidly, though with much bewilderment, until, one afternoon, MacDonald
  patiently and ploddingly acquainted him with the unhallowed baseness of one
  Thornley&mdash;helping himself, by way of compensation, to the heap of doughnuts
  under the glass cover.</p>
  <p>Dutchy listened, his cheeks getting redder and redder as MacDonald, exaggerating
  some hundredfold, suavely rubbed it in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot Thornley iss&mdash;iss a pig!&rdquo; shouted Dutchy suddenly,
  as the light burst in upon him.</p>
  <p>MacDonald nodded assent, his mouth too full of doughnut to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Und I a fool iss, yess?&rdquo; continued the proprietor, pounding
  a fat fist on the counter.</p>
  <p>Again MacDonald nodded, smiling sweetly&mdash;and reached for another doughnut.</p>
  <p>But this time Dutchy&rsquo;s fingers were firmly clasped around the cover,
  and he peered suspiciously through the glass at the number of doughnuts remaining,
  then glared at the dispatcher.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you git out from here!&rdquo; he said slowly, but with
  rising emphasis.</p>
  <p>And MacDonald, chuckling, went.</p>
  <p>It was not until after supper that same evening, when Number One pulled
  in, that Dutchy made any move toward retribution&mdash;then Dutchy cut loose.
  It was Taggart who got it&mdash;little Shorty Taggart, the driver of Number
  One, who was red-haired and an inveterate joker, and likewise a great crony
  of Thornley&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>The first intimation MacDonald had that anything was up was an enraged howl
  that, rising above the tumult of the station, reached him where he sat in
  the dispatcher&rsquo;s office. There was no mistaking the voice&mdash;it
  was Dutchy&rsquo;s. MacDonald stuck his head hastily out of the window, while
  Thornley, who was in the room, leaned over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>Dutchy was bellowing like a mad bull. &ldquo;Say it! Shusht say it. Oh!
  py golly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here followed a volcanic eruption of guttural German with one or two words
  common to all languages intermingled.</p>
  <p>Then, flying through the doorway of the lunchroom, dashing down the platform,
  scattering loungers, passengers, and car-tinks in all directions, in a mad
  rush for the engine end of the train, tore a short figure in tight-fitting,
  bandy-legged overalls, whose flaming red hair presented a shining mark for
  the plate that whizzed past his ear and smashed into a hundred pieces against
  a baggage-truck.</p>
  <p>And Dutchy, blowing hard, his sleeves rolled up over the fat of his arms,
  waddled to the center of the platform and shook a frantic fist after the
  retreating engineer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ta fool iss no longer yet, don&rsquo;d it?&rdquo; he screamed, and,
  puffing his cheeks in and out like a whezzy injector, he turned, reentered
  the restaurant, and the door closed behind him with a resounding bang.</p>
  <p>MacDonald drew in his head, and the tears were running down his cheeks as
  he held his sides.</p>
  <p>Thornley groped for a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess Taggart was asking for a rebate,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;It
  was worth pay to see him run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said MacDonald eloquently, when he could get his
  breath.</p>
  <p>The door opened, and Brett, the super, came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see Taggart and Dutchy, Brett?&rdquo; cried Thornley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brett, laughing. Then, more seriously: &ldquo;Look
  here, you&rsquo;d better patch it up with Dutchy. There&rsquo;s no use rubbing
  it in too hard. MacDonald, tell Blaney to put my car on Number Two when she
  comes in. I&rsquo;m going east to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The patching, however, was quite a different matter than talking about it.</p>
  <p>The next morning the lunch-room door was ominously closed&mdash;and the
  staff went breakfastless. By listening at the keyhole, and from an occasional
  glimpse through the window, they knew that Dutchy was inside.</p>
  <p>But to pleadings, threats, and door-kickings the occupant was, to all intents
  and purposes, oblivious. Things began to look serious for the staff and station
  hands who were wont to depend on Dutchy for their grub-stakes.</p>
  <p>Thornley whistled softly and pulled at his pipe, his feet on the dispatcher&rsquo;s
  desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> to open up when Number Ninety-Seven pulls
  in,&rdquo; Thornley was saying, more by way of reassuring himself than of
  presenting any new view of the case to MacDonald. &ldquo;The company won&rsquo;t
  stand for any inconvenience to the passengers&mdash;that is&rdquo; he hastened
  to amend, &ldquo;not of this kind. What? They&rsquo;ve got a sort of lien
  on that joint, and if he waits for them to get after him he&rsquo;ll get
  into trouble. Wish Brett were back&mdash;he&rsquo;d make him open up quick,
  I guess. What&rsquo;s the matter with Number Ninety-Seven, anyhow? Thought
  you said she was on time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So she is,&rdquo; said MacDonald, grinning. &ldquo;Hear her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the eastward came the hoarse shriek from the whistle of a five-hundred
  class.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go down,&rdquo; said Thornley. &ldquo;Coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>MacDonald nodded and got up from his chair. The two men reached the platform
  in time to acknowledge a flirt of the hand from Sanders in the cab as the
  big machine, wheel-tires sparking from the tight-set brakes, rolled slowly
  past them, coming to a halt farther on.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously the door of the lunch-room swung wide open, and on the threshold,
  completely filling the opening with his bulk, stood Dutchy. In his left hand
  he held his bell, which he began to ring clamorously; in his right hand,
  almost but not quite concealed behind his apron, was no less a weapon than
  a substantial-looking rolling-pin. A crowd of passengers began to surge toward
  the restaurant, and among them mingled the hungry railroad men of Dry Notch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted Thornley exultantly. &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d
  have to open up. Here&rsquo;s where we feed&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vait!&rdquo; cried Dutchy imperiously, as the head of the column
  reached him. &ldquo;You, yess; you, no. Vat iss it?&rdquo; He was sorting
  the sheep from the goats, allowing the passengers to enter, pushing the railroaders
  ruthlessly to one side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, yess; you, no. You, yess; you&mdash;oh! py golly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had caught sight of Thornley, and, swinging suddenly, struck out viciously
  in that direction with the rolling-pin. Being obliged, however, to maintain
  his position in the doorway, the strategic key to the situation, the jab
  fell short by two or three inches, barely missing Thornley&rsquo;s nose.</p>
  <p>Thornley fell back instinctively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, you old ass!&rdquo; he yelled angrily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
  had about enough of this. It&rsquo;s past a joke. The company&rsquo;s got
  a lien on that joint of yours, and we&rsquo;ll close it up so tight you&rsquo;ll
  never open it again&mdash;d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy stopped short in the monotonous, &ldquo;You, yess; you, no,&rdquo; on
  which he had recommenced, and his paunch began to shake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dot iss a joke. Oh, py golly, <i>lean!</i> Dot
  iss ven you ge-starving get, yah? Ho, ho! Ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In Dutch&rsquo;s burst of merriment first one and then another joined, until
  even Thornley, his good nature getting the better of him, roared with the
  rest at his own expense.</p>
  <p>But if this apparent return to good humor on Dutchy&rsquo;s part inspired
  any hope in the minds of the railroad men that he had relented and that former
  friendly relations were to be resumed, they were doomed to disappointment,
  for Dutchy stolidly continued to allow the passengers to go in and as stolidly
  barred the entrance to the others.</p>
  <p>Then they gave it up, and bought out the slender stock of canned goods and
  biscuits from the shelves of the general store.</p>
  <p>They messed in the baggage-room and they swallowed their scanty portions
  to the tune of &ldquo;Die Wacht am Rhein,&rdquo; bellowed out by a strong
  and sonorous voice, through the partition, on the other side of which, laid
  out in tempting confusion, as they were painfully aware, was plenty.</p>
  <p>What they had, however, did little more than whet their appetites, and by
  three o&rsquo;clock some of the men were talking of carrying the position
  by storm, helping themselves, and doing a few fancy stunts with Dutchy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have any row,&rdquo; said Thornley, pulling at his
  mustache and staring at MacDonald. &ldquo;What had we better do? The boys&rsquo;ll
  be pulling the old shack down around his ears. He&rsquo;ll fight like blazes,
  and some one&rsquo;ll get hurt. And then the company&rsquo;ll want to know
  what&rsquo;s what. Say, the old geeser has got us where he wants us, sure&mdash;eh,
  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>MacDonald nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; Thornley went on impressively, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
  some one besides Dutchy in this. They&rsquo;ve been giving him a steer, and <i>I</i>&rsquo;d
  give a few to know who it is. It&rsquo;s mighty queer Dutchy would wake up
  so suddenly to the fact that he was a joke. Then, there isn&rsquo;t enough
  to that rebate josh to make him so sore. Some one&rsquo;s been stringing
  him good and plenty. What had we better do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; MacDonald answered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
  go and see if we can&rsquo;t talk him over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the sight of Thornley and the dispatcher heading for the lunch-room,
  the trainmen and station-hands fell in behind them.</p>
  <p>MacDonald halted a few paces from the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You boys, stay here,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Let me see what I
  can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornley and the men halted obediently, while MacDonald went on and knocked
  at the door. There was no response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dut&mdash;Mr. Damrosch!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s MacDonald.
  I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time his knock was answered, and so suddenly as to cause him to jump
  back in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, vat iss it?&rdquo; demanded Dutchy, scowling belligerently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re&mdash;we&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo; stammered MacDonald,
  his confidence a little shaken at the proprietor&rsquo;s attitude. Then,
  desperately: &ldquo;Oh, I say, confound it all, Dutchy, we&rsquo;re hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; Dutchy&rsquo;s exclamation was a world of innocent astonishment
  and kindly interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on MacDonald, diplomatically. &ldquo;You bet we
  are. It&rsquo;s been a good joke, but you&rsquo;ve had the best end of it.
  Let&rsquo;s call it quits, there&rsquo;s a good fellow, and&mdash;and give
  us all a handout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy listened attentively to the appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, a fool iss no longer yet, don&rsquo;d it?&rdquo; he queried softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You most decidedly are not,&rdquo; MacDonald assured him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You vill for repates no longer ask, yet?&rdquo; persisted Mr. Damrosch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; replied the dispatcher earnestly, beginning
  to see daylight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all off. We&rsquo;ll apologize, too,
  if you like. I promise you, we are quite willing to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, den,&rdquo; announced Mr. Damrosch, &ldquo;ve vill aggravate&rdquo;&mdash;and
  he slammed the door in MacDonald&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hold on, Dutchy!&rdquo; cried MacDonald piteously, for he was
  very hungry. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vat I said iss dot ve vill aggravate!&rdquo; shouted Dutchy from
  the other side of the door. &ldquo;Dot iss English, don&rsquo;d it? Aggravate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He means arbitrate,&rdquo; prompted Thornley from the platform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; said MacDonald. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll agree to
  that, Dutchy. Come on&mdash;open up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vill not mit you aggra&mdash;arra&mdash;<i>do it</i>&mdash;hang
  dot vord!&rdquo; Dutchy asserted decisively, but again opening the door. &ldquo;But
  mit Mister Brett I vill do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Brett isn&rsquo;t here, you know that,&rdquo; retorted MacDonald,
  beginning to get exasperated. &ldquo;And, what&rsquo;s more, he won&rsquo;t
  be back until the day after tomorrow. I guess you know that, too, don&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy smiled a patient, chiding smile. &ldquo;Dot iss too bad,&rdquo; he
  remarked regretfully. &ldquo;But dot Thornley a pig iss, und you&mdash;oh,
  py golly! you&mdash;I could not you pelief. Ve vill vait for Mister Brett.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was closing the door again, when MacDonald put his foot against the jamb
  and, leaning toward Dutchy, said quickly, in an undertone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Dutchy, you&rsquo;re going too far. If I couldn&rsquo;t
  see any farther than you, I&rsquo;d wear glasses. Now&rsquo;s the time to
  make your deal. I&rsquo;ll help you&mdash;see? You can get anything out of
  the boys now, but you push them too far and they&rsquo;ll pull the whole
  outfit down over your ears. You say what you want, and I&rsquo;ll get it
  for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy looked meditatively into MacDonald&rsquo;s face, and shook his head
  with a sad smile of wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could not you pelief,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to. You don&rsquo;t have to believe anybody.
  Whatever you want us to do we&rsquo;ll do before you let us in to eat. You
  can&rsquo;t lose. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Damrosch scratched his head pensively, without taking his eyes off the
  dispatcher. After a minute he tapped MacDonald on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I vill tell you. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>MacDonald listened&mdash;incredulously. Then he whistled a low, long-drawn-out
  note of consternation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got a nerve!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;What do
  you think, eh? The boys&rsquo;ll never&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly,
  a smile came over his face, and he chuckled softly to himself. &ldquo;Dutchy,
  you&rsquo;re great! It&rsquo;ll be meat for the boys to make Thornley stand
  for it. That&rsquo;s what you want to do&mdash;make Thornley stand for it.
  Will the boys make him? Oh, will they! Give them the chance. That&rsquo;s
  the way to handle it. I told you I&rsquo;d help you. Now, make your <i>spiel</i>&rdquo; MacDonald
  turned to the group on the platform. &ldquo;Dutchy&rsquo;ll arbitrate!&rdquo; he
  cried.</p>
  <p>At this the men began to push forward, but Dutchy stopped them. &ldquo;Vait
  as you iss! Ven der&mdash;der&mdash;hang dot word&mdash;iss, den iss it.
  Vait!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They waited, and Dutchy began to count on his fingers. &ldquo;Dere iss sixteen
  dot breakfasted didn&rsquo;d,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Dot&mdash;iss&mdash;iss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Average &rsquo;em up at a quarter apiece,&rdquo; prompted MacDonald
  in a whisper. &ldquo;That makes four dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Iss four dollars&mdash;yess,&rdquo; went on Dutchy. &ldquo;Veil,
  I vant dot. Dere iss der crews dot in-came und out-vent und didn&rsquo;d
  eat ven der door vas closed. Dot iss two dollars&mdash;yess? Veil, I vant
  dot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men came to, and a roar of derision rent the air, in the face of which
  even Dutchy was a little shaken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand pat,&rdquo; encouraged MacDonald. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got them
  coming and going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutchy held up his hand for silence. &ldquo;Dere iss der sixteen over again
  yet dot dinnered didn&rsquo;d. Dot iss four dollars&mdash;yess? Veil, I vant
  dot. Dot iss four und two and four. Dot iss ten dollars&mdash;don&rsquo;d
  it? Veil, I vant dot, und den you come in&mdash;yess, one py one&mdash;for
  a quarter py each.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, amid the storm of abuse and jeers that greeted Dutchy&rsquo;s ultimatum,
  MacDonald, with a final injunction to the proprietor to stand by his guns,
  turned and joined Thornley and the men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, py golly!&rdquo; screamed Dutchy above the din. &ldquo;Vat
  iss it? Who was der commencer of dot joke dot iss ten dollars to pay? It
  iss dot Thornley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you wretched old thief,&rdquo; yelled Thornley, &ldquo;Do you
  think we&rsquo;re going to pay you for grub we didn&rsquo;t get, because
  you wouldn&rsquo;t let us have it, and then pay you for it again when you
  do dole it out? We&rsquo;ll see you further, first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It vas agreed in front of der&mdash;hang dot word!&mdash;py der&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agreed nothing!&rdquo; snorted Thornley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot you vill for repates no longer ask, yet, don&rsquo;d it? Veil,
  der price ten dollars iss. Dere iss no repate. Oh, py golly, Mister Thornley,
  dot vas an oxpensive joke&mdash;yess? Dot vas your joke, und I shusht thought
  me dot I hope you will pay dot yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornley paid. With no good grace, but because, as MacDonald had said they
  would, the men made him. Disgruntled and angry, he led the file into the
  restaurant, placing ten dollars and twenty-five cents in Dutchy&rsquo;s hand
  before he crossed the threshold.</p>
  <p>Behind him followed MacDonald and the grinning line of men, each contributing
  their quarters&mdash;in advance&mdash;for the first square meal they had
  had that day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eat vat you like,&rdquo; said Dutchy magnanimously.</p>
  <p>Thornley glared. &ldquo;Eat vat you like! Eat vat you like!&rdquo; he mimicked
  savagely. &ldquo;I like your colossal generosity at my expense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a long time there was no other noise save the rattle of dishes and the
  busy clatter of knives, forks, and spoons. Then Thornley beckoned to Dutchy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, vat iss it?&rdquo; inquired the proprietor from behind the
  counter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who put you on to this?&rdquo; demanded Thornley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  had to stand for it, and I&rsquo;d like to know. I would that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>MacDonald, sitting beside Thornley, noticed, with some misgivings, a peculiar
  expression sweep over Dutchy&rsquo;s face, but to his relief the proprietor&rsquo;s
  only reply was a grunt, as he answered a call for more coffee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the hokey, I&rsquo;ll bet it was that red-haired Taggart!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Thornley suddenly, turning to the dispatcher.</p>
  <p>MacDonald buried his face in his cup, ostensibly to drain the last drop,
  then he set it down quickly and jerked his watch from his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; he ejaculated, and fled from the room.</p>
  <p>An hour later, as Thornley was again sitting with his feet on MacDonald&rsquo;s
  desk, Dutchy stuck his head into the room and beckoned to the dispatcher.
  MacDonald walked across the floor and joined him. Dutchy pulled him out of
  the room and closed the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dere iss one thing dot I forgotted did,&rdquo; announced Mr. Damrosch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired MacDonald.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dere iss five doughnuts dot iss paid for not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said MacDonald.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot vas der time you told dot it vas Thornley&mdash;yess? Dot vas
  von dollar py each. Veil, I vant dot&mdash;yess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; laughed MacDonald. &ldquo;Well, I guess <i>not!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot&mdash;vas&mdash;der&mdash;time&rdquo;&mdash;Dutchy was raising
  his voice, each word growing louder and more distinct than the preceding
  one. Thornley&rsquo;s chair inside creaked ominously. MacDonald glanced furtively
  toward the door, and his face grew red&mdash;&ldquo;you&mdash;told&mdash;dot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a hasty movement, MacDonald clapped one hand over Dutchy&rsquo;s mouth,
  and with the other thrust a five-dollar bill into his fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he choked, and shoved Dutchy violently toward the
  stairs.</p>
  <p>At the bottom, Dutchy halted, turned and looked up with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Py golly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shusht thought me dot I like jokes
  pretty good, and I hope dot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; said MacDonald.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>14<br>
      <a name="Speckles"></a>Speckles</b></h2>
  <p>This happened at a period in the history of the Hill Division when trade
  was very bad, and the directors, scowling over the company&rsquo;s annual
  report, threw up their hands in holy horror; while from the sacred precincts
  of the board-room there emanated the agonized cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Economy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The general manager took up the slogan and dinned it into the ears of the
  division superintendents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Operating expenses are too high,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;They must
  be cut down.&rdquo; And the superintendents of divisions, painfully alive
  to the fact that the G. M. was not dictating for the mere pleasure of it,
  intimated in unmistakable language to the heads of departments under them
  that the next quarterly reports were expected to show a marked improvement.</p>
  <p>John Healy had charge of the roundhouse at Big Cloud, in those days, and
  the morning after the lightning struck the system he came fuming back across
  the yards from his interview with the superintendent, stuttering angrily
  to himself. As he stamped into the running-shed his humor a shade worse than
  usual the first object that caught his eye was Speckles, squatted on the
  lee side of 483, dangling his legs in the pit.</p>
  <p>That is, it would have been the lee side if Healy had come in the other
  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut down operatin&rsquo; expinses, is ut?&rdquo; Healy muttered. &ldquo;Begorra,
  I&rsquo;ll begin right now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he fired Speckles on the spot.</p>
  <p>Now, Speckles&mdash;whose name, by the way, was Dolivar Washington Babson&mdash;had
  been fired on several occasions before, and if he swallowed a little more
  tobacco-juice than was good for his physical comfort it was rather as a gulp
  of startled surprise at Healy&rsquo;s appearance than because of any poignant
  regret at the misfortune that had overtaken him. Nevertheless, he felt it
  incumbent on himself to expostulate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Git out an&rsquo; stay out!&rdquo; said Healy, refusing to argue.</p>
  <p>And Speckles got out.</p>
  <p>For a day he kept away from the roundhouse, the length of time past experience
  had taught him was required to cool the turner&rsquo;s anger; then he sauntered
  down again and came face to face with Healy on the turntable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came down to ask you to put me on again, Mr. Healy,&rdquo; he began,
  broaching the subject timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phwat?&rdquo; demanded Healy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came down to ask you to put me on again, Mr. Healy,&rdquo; Speckles
  repeated monotonously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard you&mdash;I heard you,&rdquo; said Healy, a little inconsistently. &ldquo;On
  ag&rsquo;in, is ut? Ut&rsquo;ll be a long toime, me son, mark that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This being quite different from Healy&rsquo;s accustomed, &ldquo;Well, git
  back to yer job,&rdquo; it began to filter vaguely through Speckles&rsquo; brain
  that his name was no longer to adorn the company&rsquo;s pay-sheets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I fired for good, Mr. Healy?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; said Healy. &ldquo;Just that!&rdquo; Then, relenting
  a little as Speckles&rsquo; face fell: &ldquo;If &rsquo;twere not fer the
  big-bugs down yonder &ldquo;&mdash;he jerked his thumb in the general direction
  of the East&mdash;&ldquo;I might&mdash;moind, I don&rsquo;t say I would,
  but I might&mdash;put you on ag&rsquo;in. As ut is, we&rsquo;ve instructions
  to cut down the operatin&rsquo; expinses, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s an ind
  on ut!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles stood for a moment in dismay as Healy went back into the roundhouse;
  then he turned disconsolately away, crossed the tracks to the platform of
  the station, and, seeking out a secluded corner of the freight-house, sat
  down upon a packing-case to think it out.</p>
  <p>To Speckles it was no mere matter of cutting down expenses. It was a blasted
  career!</p>
  <p>Whatever Speckles&rsquo; faults, and he was only a lad, he had one redeeming
  quality, before which, in the eyes of the business he had elected to follow,
  his strayings from the straight and narrow path dwindled into insignificance&mdash;railroading
  was born in him.</p>
  <p>At ten he had started in as caller for the night-crews, and, during the
  five years the company had had the benefit of his valuable services in that
  capacity, there was not a man on the division but sooner or later came to
  know long-armed, bony, freckled-faced, red-haired Speckles&mdash;came to
  know the little rascal, and like him, too.</p>
  <p>Then Speckles had been promoted to the post of sweeper in the roundhouse,
  and occasionally, under Healy&rsquo;s critical inspection, to washing out
  boiler-tubes. Fresh fuel thereby added to the fire of his ambition, he began
  to figure how long it would be before he got to wiping, then to firing, and
  after that&mdash;even Speckles&rsquo; boundless optimism did not have the
  temerity to specify any particular date&mdash;the time when he would attain
  his goal and get his engine.</p>
  <p>Now, instead, at the age of sixteen, he found himself seated on a cracker-box,
  his dreams for the future rudely shattered&mdash;thanks to Healy, old Sour
  Face Healy!</p>
  <p>So Speckles sighed, and as he sighed the shop whistle blew. It was noon,
  and the men began to pour out of the big gates. Then Speckles, remembering
  that the schools were also &ldquo;letting out,&rdquo; hurried down the platform
  and up the main street. He would confide in Madge. Madge would understand.</p>
  <p>Madge Bolton was the daughter of the ticket agent at the station, and between
  Mr. Bolton and Speckles there existed a standing feud, the <i>casus belli</i> being
  fifteen-year-old, blue-eyed Madge. Speckles kicked his heels on the corner
  until she appeared; then he turned and fell into step beside her, reaching
  a little awkwardly for her strap of books.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, Dol!&rdquo; was Madge&rsquo;s greeting. She was the only person
  in Big Cloud who did not call him Speckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, Madge!&rdquo; he returned.</p>
  <p>Madge glanced at his face and hands. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been to work?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Dol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fired,&rdquo; said Speckles laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Dol, again!&rdquo; she cried reproachfully. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t only the third time, and &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
  for nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Speckles, a bit sullenly. &ldquo;I was only
  restin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolivar Babson,&rdquo; she accused, &ldquo;you were loafing. Oh,
  Dol, you&rsquo;ll never get to firing, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated
  and stopped, her cheeks a little red with the hint of boy-and-girl castle-building
  that would have increased her father&rsquo;s ire against the luckless Speckles
  had he seen it.</p>
  <p>Speckles, somewhat shamefaced, and having no excuse to offer, trudged on
  in silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask Mr. Healy to take you back?&rdquo; she inquired, after
  a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Speckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Dol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Madge, hopefully, &ldquo;perhaps you could get
  a job in one of the stores. I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Timmons, the grocer, if you
  like. I know him pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles came to an abrupt and sudden halt, cast in Madge&rsquo;s face one
  look that carried with it a world of unutterable reproach, handed over her
  books in silence&mdash;and fled.</p>
  <p>He, a railroad man, go into a <i>store!</i> And this from Madge! Madge,
  who, of all others&mdash;it was too much! Speckles ate his dinner, dispirited
  and crushed. Everything and everybody was against him.</p>
  <p>His mother&rsquo;s curt inquiry as to when he was going back to work did
  not in any way tend to mitigate his troubles&mdash;rather, on the contrary,
  to accentuate them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Sour Face won&rsquo;t put me back,&rdquo; he jerked out, in response
  to his mother&rsquo;s repeated question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No wonder he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said his mother sharply, &ldquo;if
  you&rsquo;re as disrespectful as that. I&rsquo;m ashamed of you, and you
  ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles was too much depressed to offer any defense. He finished his meal
  in silence, gulped down his cup of tea in two swallows, took his hat, and
  started out.</p>
  <p>Unconsciously he directed his steps toward the yards, and, some five minutes
  later, arrived at the station. Here, about half-way down the platform, he
  spotted Mat Bolton in the open doorway of the ticket office.</p>
  <p>As he approached, the nonchalant air with which the other leaned with folded
  arms against the jamb of the door aroused Speckles&rsquo; suspicions. To
  reach the seat of his meditations&mdash;the cracker-box in the freight shed
  which had now become his objective point&mdash;he would be obliged to pass
  Mr. Bolton. He therefore began to incline his course toward the edge of the
  platform nearest the rails, so that, when he came opposite the office door,
  some fifteen feet were between him and his arch enemy.</p>
  <p>Mr. Bolton awoke from his lethargy with surprising suddenness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You young rascal,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;what you been doing to
  my girl? I&rsquo;ll teach you to make girls cry, you little speckled-face
  runt, you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a dash for Speckles, but by the time he had recovered his balance
  and saved himself from toppling over the edge of the platform to the tracks,
  Speckles had reached the safe retreat of the freight-shed door. And as the
  irate parent, after shaking his fist impotently, walked back and disappeared
  within his domain, Speckles indulged in a series of pantomimes in which his
  fingers and his nose played an intimate and comprehensive part.</p>
  <p>Perched once more on the cracker-box, Speckles again resolved himself into
  a committee on ways and means. His little skirmish with Madge&rsquo;s father
  had exhilarated him to such an extent that his heavy and oppressing sense
  of despondency had vanished, and in its place came a renewed determination
  to resume, somehow or other, the railroad career that Healy had so emphatically
  interrupted.</p>
  <p>He turned over in his mind the feasibility of applying to Regan, the master
  mechanic, for a job in the shops, but dismissed the idea almost immediately
  on the ground that shop men were not, strictly speaking, railroaders.</p>
  <p>He might start in switching and braking, and work up to conductor. That,
  at least, was railroading&mdash;not to be compared with engine-driving, not
  by long odds, but still it was railroading. His face brightened. He would
  interview Farley, the trainmaster.</p>
  <p>Farley was in his office. Speckles had not very far to go, only a few steps
  down the platform. All the offices&mdash;and Big Cloud was division headquarters&mdash;were
  under the same roof.</p>
  <p>At Speckles&rsquo; request, Farley swung around in his swivel-chair with
  a quizzical expression on his face. Then he grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Want to go on with the train-crews, eh? What do you think, kid, that
  I&rsquo;m running a kindergarten outfit, even if some of &rsquo;em do act
  like it? How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sixteen,&rdquo; said Speckles, with a sinking heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sixteen, eh? Well, come back in a couple of years, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But, for the second time that day, Speckles fled. He was in no mood to stand
  much chaffing, and Farley, as he well knew, had a leaning that way. Speckles
  halted outside the door, undecided what move to make next, when the clicking
  of the instruments in the dispatcher&rsquo;s room overhead came to his ears
  like an inspiration.</p>
  <p>Why hadn&rsquo;t he thought of that before? Spence, who had been on the
  night trick most of the years that Speckles was caller, was now chief dispatcher.
  If he had any friend anywhere, it was Spence, the man at whose elbow he had
  sat through those long, dark hours of the night that beget confidences, and
  into whose ears he had so often poured the tales of his cherished aims and
  ambitions.</p>
  <p>Speckles covered the stairs three steps at a time, in his new-found exuberance.
  Spence looked up from his key and listened as Speckles told his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Healy&rsquo;s contribution to economy, eh?&rdquo; he
  said when Speckles had finished. &ldquo;And he won&rsquo;t take you back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Speckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s pretty rough. But I don&rsquo;t see how I can
  help you any, Speckles. I haven&rsquo;t any rights over Healy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles hesitated a moment and fidgeted nervously from one foot to the
  other. &ldquo;I know you ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but I thought
  maybe you&rsquo;d put me on here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;W-what!&rdquo; ejaculated Spence. Then, smothering a laugh at the
  sight of Speckles&rsquo; woebegone countenance, he demanded gravely &ldquo;You
  mean dispatching?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Speckles, that would never do. You go back and see Healy.
  I&rsquo;ll do what I can for you with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do no good,&rdquo; said Speckles hopelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  asked him twice already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, ask him again. Look here, Speckles, it&rsquo;s up to you to
  square yourself with Healy, somehow or other. If you want your job very badly,
  you ought to be sharp enough to find a way of getting it. Go on, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Speckles descended the stairs to the platform and irresolutely began
  to cross the tracks in the direction of the running-shed. He reached the
  roundhouse and skirmished cautiously along its front. No Healy was in sight,
  so he dived in between two engines and made his way to the rear of the shed.
  Here, by peering around the end of a tender, he could see Healy&rsquo;s cubby-hole&mdash;Healy
  called it an office&mdash;a bit of space about four by six partitioned off
  from the back wall in the corner, with a greasy book the engine-crews signed,
  and two or three others, equally greasy, in which Healy kept tabs on things
  in general.</p>
  <p>In spite of his trepidation, Speckles grinned. Healy was there, bending
  over a very flimsy, spindle-legged table that he had wheedled out of the
  claim-agent some months before. His brows were puckered into a ferocious
  scowl, and he growled and muttered to himself, now laboring furiously with
  a stubby pencil on the sheets of paper in front of him, now pausing to bite
  that unoffending article almost in two in his desperation.</p>
  <p>Healy was working on his invention. All the division knew about Healy&rsquo;s
  ideas on Westinghouse and &ldquo;air,&rdquo; and that these ideas, when perfected,
  were to be patented. As to what the consensus of opinion of their value was
  is neither here nor there, except that in Healy&rsquo;s presence, when referred
  to at all, the subject was treated with dignity and respect, for Healy&rsquo;s
  physical powers were beyond the ordinary, and dearest to Healy&rsquo;s heart
  and most sacred in his eyes was this creation of his brain, or, to be more
  accurate, fancy.</p>
  <p>Speckles sidled up to the cubby-hole, and, without any peroration, took
  the plunge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came to ask you to put me on again, Mr. Healy,&rdquo;&mdash;he
  spoke rapidly, as though he feared his courage might ooze out before he could
  finish.</p>
  <p>Healy wheeled round with a grunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ut&rsquo;s you, is ut?&rdquo; he demanded grimly.</p>
  <p>Speckles, ready to run at the first sign of violence, acknowledged the impeachment
  by nodding his head affirmatively, and smiled sheepishly while Healy scrutinized
  him with a long stare from head to foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Healy, &ldquo;you wait a minute an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  give you me answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles&rsquo; heart bounded in joyous hope. Healy very deliberately gathered
  up his papers, folded them carefully, and opening the cupboard where his
  coat hung&mdash;it was a hot day, and Healy was in his shirtsleeves&mdash;tucked
  them into the inside pocket. Then, like a flash, he turned and reached for
  the first thing in sight. It was a broom.</p>
  <p>But, quick as he was, Speckles was quicker, and he led Healy by the length
  of the pit as he dodged around the tail end of a tender and darted out of
  the running-shed across the tracks to the freight-house.</p>
  <p>Healy followed no farther than the turntable. There he halted, and Speckles,
  from his retreat, saw him shake his fist and listened to the threat that
  thundered across the yards:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show yer face around here ag&rsquo;in, you young rascal, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  bate the loife out av you, so I will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speckles betook himself to the cracker-box, and from his lips there flowed
  a fluent and unrestrained expression of his opinion on things in general,
  but more particularly of Healy, and more particularly still of Healy&rsquo;s
  invention. Then, his indignation subsiding, it was followed by a fit of the
  blues; so that when, at the expiration of half an hour, Healy, still in his
  shirt-sleeves, came out of the roundhouse and walked up the tracks in the
  direction of the shops, Speckles, through the freight-house door, remarked
  the incident in complete apathy and as one in which he had no interest whatever.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes later, however, his apathy vanished and he sprang to his feet
  at the sound of the excited shouts of the men in the running-shed. Some were
  hastily swinging the big engine doors wide open, others were setting the
  table in position, while one started on a run in the direction Healy had
  taken.</p>
  <p>Another minute and the shop whistle had boomed out its warning, and as Healy,
  with the man who had gone after him, came tearing down the track like mad,
  Speckles saw the smoke beginning to curl up over the roof at the back. The
  running-shed was afire.</p>
  <p>With a whoop, Speckles traversed the platform, leaped to the rails, and
  was hard on Healy&rsquo;s heels by the time the turntable was crossed. Healy
  paused but an instant. The thing to do was to get the engines out, and Healy
  was the man to do it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get tackle rigged on 463,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s cold,
  an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have to haul her out. Set the table fer 518; I&rsquo;ll
  take her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he started on the jump for the cubby-hole and his precious papers.</p>
  <p>Now, the tackle that Healy had referred to was stored in the rear of the
  roundhouse in the same general direction as the cubby-hole, and as the order
  had been given to no one in particular, Speckles, shouting &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  get it,&rdquo; started after Healy.</p>
  <p>Some grease and waste had caught and was rolling up a nasty smoke. Through
  it, even while he tugged manfully at the heavy tackle, Speckles saw Healy
  run into his office, snatch his coat, rush out again, and dash for the cab
  of 518, throwing the coat up on the tender. As he did so, something fell
  from the pocket.</p>
  <p>Speckles dropped the tackle and pounced upon it. It was the bundle of papers
  he had seen Healy put in his coat-pocket a little while before.</p>
  <p>It was Healy&rsquo;s invention!</p>
  <p>Speckles&rsquo; first impulse was to shout to Healy, but just then 518
  glided out of the shed, and the men in front of 463 were yelling in chorus
  for the tackle, so Speckles put his tongue in his cheek and the papers in
  his pocket.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t much of a blaze, but it looked bad while it lasted. Even
  after the shop-hands had got their hose-lengths connected and a stream playing
  on the fire, and the engines were all in safety in the yard, the smoke continued
  to roll out in clouds, with here and there a vicious tongue of flame.</p>
  <p>Then Healy, his duty done, bethought him of his coat on the tender of 518.
  And Speckles, as he heard Healy&rsquo;s gasp of dismay on discovering that
  his papers were gone, had an inspiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me papers! Me papers!&rdquo; wailed Healy. &ldquo;Fer the love av
  Mike, I must av dropped thim on the flure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them for you, Mr. Healy,&rdquo; said Speckles, quick
  as a shot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; said Healy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no wan
  risk his life fer thim, bad as I want thim. Hey, come back, you runt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Speckles was gone. Headed straight for the big, yawning doors that vomited
  their smoke and flames? Oh, no, not Speckles! Hardly! Speckles would make
  his attempt from the rear! And around the end of the shed and in behind he
  raced.</p>
  <p>Some of the men were fighting the fire from that side, but they were too
  busy to pay any attention to Speckles. A dab of soot and dirt on his face
  which he obtained by rubbing his fingers along the blackened wall, an artistic
  smudge of generous proportions on the outside of the papers, which he took
  from his pocket, and Speckles&rsquo; make-up was complete and convincing.</p>
  <p>Now, Speckles had an eye for the dramatic and an appreciation of its value.
  He peered in through one of the windows. It was not nearly as bad inside
  as it had been, and he decided there would be no risk and very little discomfort
  in carrying out the plan that had popped into his head.</p>
  <p>So he climbed in through a window and dropped down to the floor on the other
  side. The next minute he had dashed through the running-shed, and emerged
  from a whirl of black smoke into the open in front of the turntable, the
  papers waved aloft in his fist.</p>
  <p>It was effective&mdash;decidedly effective! A cheer went up, and the men
  crowded around, while Healy rushed forward and began to pump Speckles&rsquo; arm
  up and down like an engine-piston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ut&rsquo;s a hero you are, me bright jool av a lad!&rdquo; he cried
  in his delight. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mesilf, John Healy, that ses ut, an&rsquo; the
  bhoys are me witness. Come back to yer job in the mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo;,
  by my sowl, Speckles, I&rsquo;ll niver fire you ag&rsquo;in, niver! An&rsquo; ut&rsquo;s
  more I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promote you. Ut&rsquo;s a wiper you are
  from now on, me son, an&rsquo; to blazes wid cuttin&rsquo; down operatin&rsquo; expinses!
  Where did you foind the papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the floor,&rdquo; said Speckles&mdash;and he told the truth.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>15<br>
      <a name="Munford"></a>Munford</b></h2>
  <p>Munford came to the work before the gangs were deep enough into the hills
  to lose daily, or rather nightly, touch with Big Cloud. And the way of his
  coming was this: The town, springing up in a night, had its beginning in
  the wooden shanty the engineers built as headquarters for the Hill Division
  that was to be. Then, with mushroom growth, came shacks innumerable; and
  these shacks, for the most part, were gambling hells and dives and saloons,
  and the population was Indian, Chinese and bad American. To these places
  of lurid entertainment flocked the toilers at night, loading down the construction
  empties as they backed their way to the spurs and sidings that soon spread
  out like a cobweb around headquarters.</p>
  <p>Naturally, rows were of pretty frequent occurrence between the company&rsquo;s
  men and the leeches who bleed them with crooked games and stacked decks over
  the roulette, faro and stud-poker tables. But of them all in the delectable
  pursuit of separating the men and their pay-checks, Pete McGonigle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden
  Luck&rdquo; saloon was in the van, both as to size and crookedness. And that
  high station of eminence it maintained until the night a stranger wrecked
  it by no more delicate a method than that of kicking over the roulette table,
  sending it and the attendant, who was presiding over the little whirling
  ball in Pete&rsquo;s interest, crashing to the floor. That stranger was Munford.
  And that was how Munford came to join the army of the Rockies.</p>
  <p>A number of the company men were present and they sided in with Munford.
  Before this amalgamation, Pete and his hangers-on went down to ignominious
  defeat, and the &ldquo;Golden Luck,&rdquo; to utter demolishment and ruin.
  News of the fracas spread rapidly to the other &ldquo;joints.&rdquo; The
  dive-keepers joined forces, the company men did likewise, and that night
  became the wildest in the history of Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>Munford took command of his new-found friends from the start. In the street
  fight that followed he did wondrous things&mdash;and did them with zest,
  delight and effectiveness. With his great bulk he towered above his companions,
  and the sweep of his long arms as they rose and fell, the play of his massive
  shoulders as he lunged forward to give impetus to his blows, was a marvelous
  sight to see. But the details of that fight have no place here. Its result,
  however, was that Munford, previously unknown and unheard of, became thereafter,
  a marked man in Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>When the fight was over the company men, elated with victory though somewhat
  the worse for wear, retired to the yard to wait for the construction trains
  to take them up to their work. And while they waited they spent the time
  gazing in admiration at Munford who sat on the edge of a flat-car, his legs
  dangling over, blowing softly on his knuckles, a smile of divine contentment
  on his face.</p>
  <p>What was Munford going to do? demanded McGuire and the cronies of his particular
  gang who had had the honor of being present at Pete&rsquo;s when the evening&rsquo;s
  proceedings were instituted, and who therefore felt they had a prior claim
  to the hero&rsquo;s consideration over and above that of the men from other
  sections of the work who had taken part in the fight. Munford did not know.
  Would he go up the line with them and take a job with their gang if they
  promised to get him one? Munford would. So he kept his seat when the construction
  train pulled out just as the dawn was breaking, and twenty miles up the road
  at Twin Bear Creek they tumbled him off and introduced him to Alan Burton,
  foreman of Bridge Gang No. 3.</p>
  <p>At the sight of his battered and jaded crew, who in no wise appeared fit
  for the day&rsquo;s work before them, Burton swore savagely and with great
  bitterness of tongue bade them get to their work. Then he turned in his ill-humor
  to Munford, who was still standing beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who the devil are you? What you doin&rsquo; here? Where d&rsquo;ye
  come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The questions came quick and sharp like a volley of small arms.</p>
  <p>Munford eyed the wiry little chunk of a man, scarcely up to his own shoulders,
  in silence, taking him in from head to foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; snapped Burton, &ldquo;speak up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Munford&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; said Munford, coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  here for a job. Where I come from ain&rsquo;t none of your blamed business,
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Burton. &ldquo;Well, then, you can walk
  back there, my bucko!&rdquo; and he turned on his heel and followed the men
  to their work.</p>
  <p>Munford sat down on the doorsill of the camp shanty and with a laugh pulled
  out his pipe and began to smoke. He was still sitting there a half-hour later
  when the foreman came back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got far to go,&rdquo; grinned Burton, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
  better get started.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; replied Munford, imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer card,&rdquo; said Burton, after a moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  this about the trouble down at Big Cloud last night the boys are so full
  of they can&rsquo;t do anything besides talk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Munford chuckled quietly. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much, eh? They say you put the &lsquo;Golden Luck&rsquo; and
  Pete McGonigle to the bad, and then cleaned out every dive in town. You&rsquo;re
  quite a reformer, ain&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll tell you this, though, it won&rsquo;t
  be healthy for you around these parts from now on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Munford. &ldquo;Say, how about
  that job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Burton laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a sweet nerve to ask for a job,
  and you responsible for a gang that won&rsquo;t be able to do a day&rsquo;s
  work among the lot of them between now and night. Did up McGonigle&rsquo;s,
  eh? Well, I don&rsquo;t know, I reckon in the long run that&rsquo;ll be worth
  more to the company than the day&rsquo;s work. All right, sport, you can
  go to work&mdash;until Pete and his crowd scare you out, which I predict
  won&rsquo;t be long. And while you&rsquo;re here, if you get itchy for trouble
  don&rsquo;t look for it among the men, come to <i>me.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Munford. &ldquo;Why, I could
  twist you like&mdash;&rdquo; Then he laughed in pure delight at Burton&rsquo;s
  spunk &ldquo;Oh, sure! <i>Sure</i>, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took Munford no longer than a day to get the hang of the work. He was
  already more than a demigod in the eyes of Bridge Gang No. 3, and that counted
  for much. They were eager and ready to show him what they knew themselves,
  whereas the ignorance and rawness of any other newcomer would have been turned
  to good account in the shape of gibes and jests at his expense. In two days,
  from a natural adaptability coupled with his great strength, that was the
  strength of two men, Munford had fitted into place with the same nicety that
  one part of a well designed machine fits into another.</p>
  <p>To the crews of the construction trains bringing up the bridge material
  he was pointed out with pride by his mates&mdash;though, indeed, that action
  was superfluous&mdash;as &ldquo;the boy who did the trick at Pete&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And
  from these in turn Munford learned that down at Big Cloud, Pete and others
  of his ilk had sworn that, sooner or later, they would fix him for it. At
  this he only laughed and, doubling his great arm bared to the shoulders,
  intimated that there could be no greater pleasure in life for him than to
  have them try it. And that night sitting outside the camp after supper, McGuire,
  as spokesman, alluding to the threat, proposed that under Munford&rsquo;s
  leadership they should make another raid on Big Cloud.</p>
  <p>Burton, passing by, caught the gist of the conversation. &ldquo;I want to
  see you a minute, Munford,&rdquo; he called, shortly.</p>
  <p>Munford got up and followed to the foreman&rsquo;s little shanty that stood
  a few yards away from the main camp. Once inside, Burton shoved him into
  a chair and shook his fist under Munford&rsquo;s nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you yesterday morning,&rdquo; he spluttered angrily, &ldquo;that
  if you were looking for trouble to come to me and leave the gang alone? And
  here you&rsquo;re at it again, what? Go down to Big Cloud and raise hell,
  eh? You great, big overgrown calf!&rdquo; Munford blinked at the foreman,
  speechless. It was a long time since he had taken words like these from any
  man, much less a little spitfire like Burton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; continued the irate Burton, hardly pausing for breath. &ldquo;You
  live on it, don&rsquo;t you? Eat it, eh? Well, you&rsquo;ll get a fill of
  it before long that&rsquo;ll give you the damnest indigestion you ever heard
  of. I promise you that! But you keep your hands off my crew! Now you listen
  to what I&rsquo;m saying!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, go hang!&rdquo; said Munford, contemptuously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  help it, can I, if they want to go down to Big Cloud? If you&rsquo;re so
  blamed anxious about them, it&rsquo;s a wonder you don&rsquo;t go around
  every night and tuck &rsquo;em into their bunks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Burton looked as though he were going to jump into Munford
  and mix it then and there; but instead, with a short laugh, he turned and
  walked to the other side of the room, sat down on the edge of his bunk and
  pulled out his pipe. He cut some tobacco from his plug, rolled it between
  his palms, packed his pipe slowly and lighted it. It was five minutes before
  he broke the silence; Munford was beginning to feel uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose throwing a few timbers across Twin Bear Creek
  means much of anything to you, Munford, eh?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so much,&rdquo; replied Munford carelessly, a little puzzled
  at the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No? Well, it means a lot to me, a whole lot! Until that trestle is
  up, we can&rsquo;t shove material over to the other side, ties and rails
  and heavy stuff. Progress on the Hill Division depends just at this minute
  on Bridge Gang No. 3, and concretely on me. I don&rsquo;t propose to have
  it interfered with by the men going down to Big Cloud and getting their heads
  broke, understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we can take care of <i>our</i> heads, if that&rsquo;s
  all that bothers you,&rdquo; drawled Munford. &ldquo;And I furthermore guess
  your bloomin&rsquo; little bridge you seem so stuck on won&rsquo;t take any
  hurt by lettin&rsquo; the boys have their fling. Anyway, whether it will
  or not, what&rsquo;s the use of you shootin&rsquo; off all your talk? You
  can&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em! If they want to go, they&rsquo;ll go. And say,
  Burton&rdquo;&mdash;an inspiration coming to Munford&mdash;&ldquo;come on
  down with us. I&rsquo;ll promise you the time of your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have put it up to you differently, I guess, and saved
  my breath,&rdquo; said Burton in disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a hulk
  of bone and muscle and your head&rsquo;s wood. You can lift a timber and
  swing a pick or axe because you&rsquo;ve got the strength. But that&rsquo;s
  all you know, or all you&rsquo;re good for!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cool contempt in Burton&rsquo;s voice stung Mun-ford more than the words
  themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; he snarled, resorting to his favorite habit of
  blowing on his knuckles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d show you fast enough what I&rsquo;m
  good for, you runt, if you was a little bigger!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;m big enough one of these days,&rdquo; said
  Burton, sharply. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll put it to you straight so that you&rsquo;ll
  understand. I&rsquo;ll show you whether I can stop the gang going to Big
  Cloud or not. No man rides on the construction trains after to-day without
  a pass signed by me. That&rsquo;s orders! If the men don&rsquo;t like it,
  you can tell them it&rsquo;s your fault. The next row in Big Cloud wouldn&rsquo;t
  stop at fists. And as for you, you wouldn&rsquo;t come out of it alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; sneered Munford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool! The thickest-headed, trouble-hunting fool it&rsquo;s
  ever been my cursed luck to run against!&rdquo; exclaimed Burton angrily.</p>
  <p>Munford brushed his great shock of hair out of his eyes with a nervous sweep
  of his hand. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t ever before taken the back talk from any
  man that I&rsquo;ve taken from you&mdash;without hurtin&rsquo; him,&rdquo; he
  said thickly, rising from his chair. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
  get out of here before I hurt <i>you!</i>&rdquo; He walked quickly across
  the shanty and swung around in the doorway. &ldquo;By God, I wish you was
  bigger!&rdquo; he flung out.</p>
  <p>Munford walked back to the men&rsquo;s camp and listened to their conversation
  awhile in sullen silence. They were still on the same topic and were waxing
  more enthusiastic each minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, dry up!&rdquo; said Munford, cutting in at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
  be a long time before any of you see Big Cloud again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo; demanded McGuire, aggressively.</p>
  <p>Munford jerked his thumb in the direction of the foreman&rsquo;s shanty. &ldquo;Him,&rdquo; he
  said laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to stop it? What for? What&rsquo;s the
  matter with him, anyway? It&rsquo;s none of his business!&rdquo; the men
  were talking in chorus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fussy about gettin&rsquo; his dinky little bridge through,&rdquo; sneered
  Munford. &ldquo;He says he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have broken heads interferin&rsquo; with
  it, either. From now on you&rsquo;ve got to get a pass to ride on the construction
  train. Likewise, he said if you didn&rsquo;t like it I was to tell you&rdquo;&mdash;here
  Munford paused to glance around the circle&mdash;&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s my
  fault and I&rsquo;m the cause of all the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo; demanded the crew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told him to go hang. What else would I tell him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; shouted McGuire, slapping his leg in delight. &ldquo;Did
  he fire you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was something Munford had not thought of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire me?&rdquo; he repeated. Then slowly, pondering the idea: &ldquo;No,
  he didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s funny he didn&rsquo;t, though; I gave him back
  talk enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; said McGuire, with a sneer, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy.
  He&rsquo;d have fired you quick enough if he dared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Munford innocently. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
  touched him if he had. He&rsquo;s too small to touch&mdash;I told him that,
  too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; McGuire returned. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t
  afraid of any man, big or little. I&rsquo;ll give him credit for that. It&rsquo;s
  his bridge, and that means his job, that he&rsquo;s afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my gettin&rsquo; fired got to do with the bridge?&rdquo; demanded
  Munford, in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, go on; you know what I mean. If Burton has trouble with us the
  bridge work stops, don&rsquo;t it? And the company&rsquo;ll be askin&rsquo; Burton
  the reason why, won&rsquo;t they? Well, Burton knows there&rsquo;s some things
  we won&rsquo;t stand for, and firin&rsquo; you after we brought you up here
  is one of them. And that&rsquo;s right, too, eh, mates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was emphatic assent from the men.</p>
  <p>Munford, a little flustered at this wholesale exhibition of homage, fidgeted
  nervously. &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said he, clumsily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  put yourselves out on my account. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; broke in McGuire. &ldquo;Burton won&rsquo;t
  try it; he knows better. As for gettin&rsquo; a pass to get out of camp,
  I dunno about <i>that</i>.&rdquo; He got up, stretched himself and yawned. &ldquo;The
  way I look at it, it&rsquo;s more up to Munford here than it is to Burton.
  I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to turn in, but I&rsquo;ll say first that the night
  Munford says Big Cloud, then Big Cloud it is for Bridge Gang No. 3. That&rsquo;s
  the way we talked it before we knew about Burton mixin&rsquo; in, and I reckon
  it stands just the same now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the camp retired to their bunks and to sleep, voicing McGuire&rsquo;s
  sentiments and swearing a unanimous and enthusiastic allegiance to Munford;
  all but Munford himself who did not sleep but lay awake tossing restlessly
  though, withal, in a very self-satisfied frame of mind.</p>
  <p>This outburst of popularity pleased Munford exceedingly. The more so that
  it was directly traceable to his great strength and physical courage of which
  he was inordinately vain. He began to regard Burton with contempt. Burton
  was a man whose backbone wobbled when it came to a showdown! As Munford turned
  the situation over in his mind his contempt grew stronger until he came to
  decide that he despised the little foreman heartily. Would he, he demanded
  of himself with a snort, have fired a man that had talked to him as he had
  talked to Burton, had he been in Burton&rsquo;s place? He would! And the
  gang, bridge, job and everything else could go to blazes! Munford sat up
  to emphasize his feelings on this point with a crash of his fist on the side
  of the bunk. He thrilled with the fierce joy of enacting just such a r&ocirc;le
  as his imagination depicted, despising Burton accordingly for lacking in
  what were, to him, the essentials of a man. He decided, as he fell asleep,
  to make the foreman&rsquo;s life a burden to him&mdash;and he did.</p>
  <p>No flagrant violation or disobedience of orders was there, instead the inauguration
  of a petty little system of nagging that embraced every indignity Munford
  could think of. And the range of his attack was from profound and exaggerated
  attention and politeness to the utter and complete ignoring of the very existence
  of such a person as Alan Burton, foreman of Bridge Gang No. 3. While the
  gang, taking their cue from Munford, would shift from one extreme to the
  other with a precision and significance that cut deeper into a man of Burton&rsquo;s
  high-strung, nervous temperament than any other form of torture they could
  have devised.</p>
  <p>Three times during three days Burton, who was afraid of no man or aggregation
  of men, took the bull by the horns and struck Munford a violent blow in an
  effort to bring matters to a head. On the first occasion the gang watched
  the action with a gasp of mixed pity and admiration&mdash;looking for Burton&rsquo;s
  instant annihilation. But Munford, with a bit of a laugh, only reached out
  and grasping Burton&rsquo;s neck held him wriggling, helplessly, impotently,
  at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;You got to grow, boy; just keep quiet now,
  I ain&rsquo;t going to hurt you,&rdquo; he taunted. And the gang promptly
  lost their faint appreciation of Burton&rsquo;s nerve in their relish of
  the ridiculous figure cut by the white-faced, raging foreman.</p>
  <p>It was dirty work, and deep down in his heart Munford knew it. But his better
  nature no sooner manifested itself by sundry pricks of conscience than it
  was smothered beneath the new sense of authority and command that was now
  his for the first time in his experience; and which, catering as it did to
  his peacock vanity, was paramount to all things else. The work lagged sadly
  and fell behind. The daily reports Burton signed and sent down to headquarters
  became worse and worse.</p>
  <p>Each day, too, the feud between the dives at Big Cloud and Bridge Gang No.
  3, fanned by the crews of the construction trains, who taunted McGuire and
  the men with cowardice, grew stronger. For the trainmen, having no idea of
  disregarding Burton&rsquo;s orders and allowing the bridge men to ride down
  on the empties, rubbed it in until the gang writhed under their gibes.</p>
  <p>Munford did not come in for much of this personally. The trainmen, none
  of them, seemed to display any particular hankering for discussing the question
  in his presence; but he got it second-hand from McGuire and the gang. The
  outcome of it all was a decision one night after supper to board the construction
  train the following evening, Burton, the train crew and the company to the
  contrary, and go down to Big Cloud if they had to run the train themselves.
  Munford concurred in the decision by blowing very gently on his knuckles.
  It looked bad for the peace and quiet of Big Cloud; and it looked bad for
  Burton&rsquo;s standing with the company.</p>
  <p>Munford, as commander-in-chief, and McGuire, as chief of staff, withdrew
  from the circle and strolled off by themselves to perfect their plans for
  the next day&rsquo;s campaign, taking the trail in the direction of Big Cloud&mdash;a
  trail still called, but now a passable road due to the traffic incident to
  the building of the Hill Division, whose right of way it paralleled from
  Big Cloud to the ford at Twin Bear Creek. At the end of a quarter of a mile
  the two men sat down on a felled tree by the side of the trail to talk. Some
  ten minutes had passed when McGuire, in the midst of a graphic description
  of what they would do to Pete McGonigle and the rest, suddenly stopped and
  gripped Munford tightly by the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep mum,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone comin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the bright moonlight they could make out the figure of a man about a
  hundred yards down the road coming toward them from the camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He walks like Burton,&rdquo; whispered McGuire. &ldquo;What the devil
  is he followin&rsquo; us for? Get back into the trees and let him pass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They moved noiselessly a little deeper into the wood that fringed the road,
  and lying flat, watched the man who was approaching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Burton,&rdquo; McGuire announced at last.</p>
  <p>Munford grunted assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been followin&rsquo; us all right, and now he&rsquo;s
  goin&rsquo; to wait for us to come back,&rdquo; continued McGuire, as Burton
  halted within a few yards of them and sat down to smoke. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll
  give him a run for his money. He can wait a while, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. McGuire began to tire of his self-selected
  game of hide and seek, &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
  go out and see what he wants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Munford answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone comin&rsquo; from
  Big Cloud way. It&rsquo;s not us Burton&rsquo;s after. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was the faint beat of horse&rsquo;s hoofs gradually drawing nearer.
  Then presently rider and horse loomed out of the shadows and Burton, getting
  up, stepped out into the middle of the road.</p>
  <p>The horseman drew up beside him. &ldquo;That you, Burton?&rdquo; he called
  softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Burton, shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You got Pete&rsquo;s letter, then,&rdquo; the man went on, dismounting
  from his horse. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right to talk here. No one
  around, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As well here as anywhere. Only cut it short.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, there ain&rsquo;t any hurry,&rdquo; returned the man, with a
  laugh. &ldquo;Wait till I tie my horse, then we can sit down and chew it
  over comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, that task performed, &ldquo;what I came
  to see you about was this fellow Munford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; demanded Burton, &ldquo;what about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks to us down to Big Cloud, from the way the fellows on the
  construction trains are talkin&rsquo;, you ain&rsquo;t got any cause to love
  him, eh? So Pete figured you and him could deal. You want to get rid of him,
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish to God I&rsquo;d never seen his face!&rdquo; exclaimed Burton,
  with great bitterness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s the idea. You don&rsquo;t want him; we do want
  him&mdash;bad! There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; against the rest of the men; we&rsquo;ll
  forget all about that. It&rsquo;s just Munford we&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get him, then?&rdquo; said Burton curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to,&rdquo; the man replied, with a nasty
  laugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to, all right. It&rsquo;s a fair deal.
  You&rsquo;re on, eh? Pete said you&rsquo;d jump at the chance to sit in.
  We want you to fire him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That all I&rsquo;m to do?&rdquo; asked Burton, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s all there is to it&mdash;except this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Munford&rsquo;s hand closed on his companion&rsquo;s arm in a tight, spasmodic
  grip as Pete&rsquo;s emissary produced a wad of bills and began to peel off
  the outer ones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three hundred plunks,&rdquo; said the man, extending the money he
  had abstracted from the roll to Burton. &ldquo;Pretty good for just firin&rsquo; a
  man we&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; for you to fire for the last week, anyway.
  Besides, there&rsquo;s been some talk down at headquarters about you not
  bein&rsquo; able to handle your men, and about them gettin&rsquo; someone
  that can. Pete says not to bother about that, he&rsquo;ll fix it for you.
  Here, take the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I fired him,&rdquo; said Burton, slowly, &ldquo;where&rsquo;d
  he go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you care where he goes, so long as you get rid of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t go West,&rdquo; went on Burton, paying no attention
  to the other&rsquo;s remark; &ldquo;so he&rsquo;d have to go East&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  Big Cloud&mdash;and <i>murder!</i>&rdquo; He turned fiercely, savagely on
  the man. &ldquo;You dirty, low-lived hound!&rdquo; he flashed. &ldquo;You
  offer me three hundred dollars to murder a man, do you? You wonder why I&rsquo;ve
  stood for what I did, do you, you scrimp! Fire him, eh, to get a cowardly
  knife or shot in his back! You think I didn&rsquo;t know what would happen
  if I let him out, eh? Get out of here, you cur! And get out now&mdash;while
  you <i>can!</i>&rdquo; Burton&rsquo;s voice rasped, hoarse with passion.
  He turned abruptly away and strode quickly in the direction of the camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, wait a minute, Burton,&rdquo; cried the other, following
  him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get batty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unconsciously Munford had tightened his grip on McGuire&rsquo;s arm until
  the latter whimpered with the pain, and now Munford lifted him bodily to
  his feet making cautiously for the spot where the horse was standing. The
  two figures were still discernible, and Burton&rsquo;s angry voice continued
  to reach the listeners, though the words were now indistinguishable.</p>
  <p>Munford&rsquo;s face in the moonlight was colorless, the muscles around
  his mouth twitched convulsively. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear what they said?
  D&rsquo;ye hear what they said? <i>My God!</i> d&rsquo;ye hear it all?&rdquo; he
  was mumbling incoherently in McGuire&rsquo;s ear, his eyes strained up the
  road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it. Let go of my arm, you&rsquo;re breakin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; back,&rdquo; said Munford, hoarsely.</p>
  <p>Burton had disappeared around a turn in the road and the man, after hesitating
  a moment, began to retrace his steps to his horse, muttering fiercely to
  himself as he came along. As he reached for the bridle, Munford leaped out
  and grasped him by the throat, choking back the man&rsquo;s cry of terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make a noise,&rdquo; snarled Munford, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll finish
  you! Oh, it&rsquo;s you, eh? Look here, Mac, it&rsquo;s the cuss that ran
  the roulette wheel that night at Pete&rsquo;s. So my price is three hundred,
  eh? Well, hand it out. <i>Quick!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly the fellow put his hand in his pocket and for the second time that
  night pulled out his roll.</p>
  <p>Munford&rsquo;s anger seemed to have vanished. He laughed softly as he took
  the money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; whined the gambler.</p>
  <p>Munford made no answer. In the imperfect light, he was laboriously counting
  the bills. McGuire watched the operation, at the same time keeping an eye
  on their prisoner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two sixty&mdash;eighty&mdash;three hundred,&rdquo; said Munford at
  last, cramming that amount into his pocket and handing back by far the larger
  part of the roll to the man. &ldquo;What am I goin&rsquo; to do with you?
  Nothin&rsquo;! You get on that horse and ride back to Pete. I want him to
  know this. Tell him all about it. Tell him Munford told you to tell him.
  That&rsquo;s worth more than breakin&rsquo; your neck&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
  all that saves you from gettin&rsquo; it broke, savvy? You tell him <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> got
  the three hundred, and I&rsquo;ll give him his chance at me for it one of
  these days. And when I do&mdash;My God, <i>you ride</i> before I begin with
  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fellow glanced fearfully from Munford to McGuire and back again to Munford
  to assure himself that he was free to go. Then he clambered frantically into
  the saddle and lashing his beast in a frenzy of terror disappeared down the
  trail.</p>
  <p>Munford, with swift revulsion of mood, threw himself down on the grass,
  burying his face in his hands. Not a word from McGuire; he walked awkwardly
  up and down, whistling under his breath. After a minute Munford looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got to square this with Burton,&rdquo; he said brokenly.</p>
  <p>McGuire nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a better man than you and me and the whole gang put together&rdquo;&mdash;Munford&rsquo;s
  tones were fiercely assertive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is that,&rdquo; assented McGuire, with conviction.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment between them; then McGuire spoke: &ldquo;Why
  didn&rsquo;t you take it all?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take it all!&rdquo; flared Munford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no thief, am
  I? Well, then, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? That&rsquo;s my price, ain&rsquo;t
  it? Three hundred. That&rsquo;s what Pete offered for a chance to get his
  paws on me. Well, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> give him his chance, you heard me promise,
  didn&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s right, eh? That&rsquo;s Pete&rsquo;s proposition,
  and the money&rsquo;s mine, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said McGuire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, and it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Munford. &ldquo;Burton <i>could</i> have
  had it if he&rsquo;d sold me out, couldn&rsquo;t he? Well, then, I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to see he gets it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t take it, not by any means, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; objected
  McGuire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not outright, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Munford. &ldquo;I
  know that well enough. We got to fix it so he won&rsquo;t know where it come
  from, and so it will square me with him, and you fellows, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How you goin&rsquo; to do that?&rdquo; demanded McGuire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I
  dunno,&rdquo; said Munford. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over with the boys.
  Come on back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next day and the day after, the gang worked like Trojans, and the lack
  of any sneer or incivility on their part, coupled with a subdued, expectant
  excitement that the men tried fruitlessly to hide, made Burton more anxious
  and ill at ease than during the days that had gone before. It looked like
  the lull before the storm; and he wondered bitterly what culminating piece
  of deviltry they were hatching.</p>
  <p>To the taunts of the train crews the gang grinned and said nothing.</p>
  <p>On the second day a package, addressed to Munford, came up from the East,
  and at noon hour the men handed it around from one to another in awestruck
  wonder at the magnificence of the solid gold repeater that chimed the quarters,
  halves and hours, and split the seconds into fractions. It was indeed a beauty.
  Maybe the chain was a little massive, but the men opined that it was therefore
  strong. They pried open the case to read the inscription over whose wording
  they had wrestled most of a night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nifty, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried McGuire, admiringly; and he read
  it aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;This is to certify that Alan Burton is as square
  as they make them, and Munford and the gang are sorry. So help us!&rsquo;&rdquo; They
  delivered it solemnly to Munford, who was to make the presentation, and started
  in a body for Burton&rsquo;s shanty. Burton met them at the door, his face
  hard and set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a showdown at last, eh, boys?&rdquo; he laughed grimly. &ldquo;Well,
  what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men shoved Munford bodily forward and he stood balancing himself sheepishly,
  first on one foot and then on the other, as he faced Burton. He cleared his
  throat painfully once or twice, then he found his voice. From a point of
  oratory or rhetoric it was perhaps the lamest presentation speech on record,
  for Munford suddenly thrust the watch and chain into the astounded Burton&rsquo;s
  hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, take it,&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all written
  out on the inside.&rdquo; And breaking through the men, he turned and fled
  incontinently.</p>
