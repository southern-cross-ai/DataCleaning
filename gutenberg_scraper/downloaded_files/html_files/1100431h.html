    <p>
      Florence was in one of her haphazard moods. She caught a
      toe in a corner of the dining-room carpet when she entered
      the dining-room with a tray of custard-glasses, for, in
      those days, custard was served in glasses which, in a more
      free future, would contain Dubonnet or Sherry or Gin and
      It. The glasses slid in a clattering avalanche to the floor
      and spilled broken glass and dollops of yellow matter upon
      the carpet. Mr. Marsland, glancing irritably over a nervous
      shoulder, remarked that there would be no mating of
      gooseberry tart and custard on this June day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florrie had tonsils, and was a mouth-breather. She was a
      good girl, though given to lapses, and when she lapsed her
      language slipped like her stockings. Mrs. Pomeroy was
      always saying to her: "Florence, pull up your stockings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, oh--lordy, how did I come to do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, sitting at the head of her table, answered
      Florrie's question with dignity and restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just carelessness, Florence, carelessness and too much
      haste. How often have I told you not to come into a room
      with your head in front of your feet. Get a dustpan and
      brush and a wet cloth and clean up that mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm. I'm sorry, m'm. Fact is--the sole is coming off me
      shoe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More carelessness, Florence. Get a dustpan and brush and a
      wet cloth and clean up that mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was serving gooseberry tart. Florence should
      have distributed the plates, but since the Kidderminster
      carpet was Florence's immediate concern, it being a new
      one, Mrs. Pomeroy apologised for the disaster, and asked
      Mr. Truslove and Miss Popham if they would be so kind as to
      pass the plates. Mrs. Pomeroy was always urbane, if
      formidably so. Rarely was she seen out of black satin, with
      a white fichu fastened with an amethyst brooch. Big,
      blonde, high-coloured, high-bosomed, a Wellington of a
      warrior with a crisp and deliberate voice, she was never
      out of countenance, and never in a flurry. It was said that
      Mrs. Pomeroy had suffered misfortune and unhappiness in her
      past. It was not--her--past, but the product of a
      disastrous marriage. Mr. Pomeroy was dead, had been
      decently dead for years, and his widow held her head high
      as though refusing to recapture the unpleasant odour of
      that self-same past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table sugared its gooseberry tart and ate it, minus
      custard, while Florrie, with heavy breathing, swept and
      mopped up the debris. There was silence, and Mrs. Pomeroy's
      silence was the most evident part of the stillness. Almost
      it was the silence in church after the officiating priest's
      last solemn Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was more behind Mrs. Pomeroy's silence than the
      mere pressure of disapproval and self-restraint. Florence
      had supplied her mistress with access to an inspiration.
      Mrs. Pomeroy had been waiting for some such
      occasion--however trivial--to make an innovation that she
      contemplated appear natural. Nos. 3, 4 and 5 Caroline
      Terrace had developed from a boarding-house into a Private
      Hotel, and its new dignity deserved service in trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy broke the silence. She spoke to her clientele
      as to a friendly but docile committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really think I must engage a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove grunted his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea, madam. Someone with a feeling for boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," said Mrs. Pomeroy, "someone who could carry up
      coal and luggage and wait at table. A properly trained man.
      I shall go up to town and call on Messrs. Garter and
      Pranson. I believe that theirs is the most reliable agency
      in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was capturing the last gooseberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I make a suggestion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was always gracious to Mr. Truslove. He was
      first floor and somewhat permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a trained man to wait we might have separate tables."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy did not snub him. She, too, had been
      contemplating some such development. It would be more chic,
      more productive of prestige. And Mr. Truslove was a
      particular and somewhat separative person. He hated having
      constitutional chatters at his elbow, irresponsible maiden
      ladies who were bright and vivacious, and quite unable to
      refrain from neighbourly conversation.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Truslove's custom after dinner to put a
      comfortable chair out on his balcony, read the daily paper,
      and then fall asleep. On reaching the first landing of the
      main staircase he would pass the door of Mrs. Pomeroy's
      private room, which also was her office. It was Mrs.
      Pomeroy's habit to keep this door closed, which was
      understandable, for a woman who had so many domestic
      duties, and both residents and staff to rule or humour,
      might claim the right of some seclusion. On this particular
      day Mr. Truslove paused, and hesitated, for Mrs. P's. door
      was open. Mr. Truslove, being a separative person, had to
      provide himself with human contacts by exercising a lively
      and inquisitive interest in other people's affairs. He
      stepped aside and knocked on the door. There was no answer,
      and Mr. Truslove entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty. Not even Rose, Mrs. Pomeroy's small
      daughter, was here to challenge him with her pretty
      primrose face. Mr. Truslove glanced round the room, but his
      eyes gave particular attention to the mantelpiece. Yes,
      that was the peculiar thing about the Pomeroy mantelpiece
      and the walls of the room. There were no photographs. It
      was a very photographic age, as far as family portraits
      were concerned, and Mr. Truslove would have expected to see
      some portrait of the late Mr. Pomeroy upon the mantelpiece.
      It held a clock, various vases, two bronze figures, but no
      portraits. Nor were there any family groups upon the walls,
      especially those recording the sacrament of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove sneaked out again, ruminating upon the strange
      absence of such records.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peculiar," thought he--"one would have expected to see the
      late Mr. P. about somewhere. Yes, very peculiar indeed!
      Now--I wonder--had--there been a Mr. P.?--And if so had he
      been quite respectable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectable! Mr. Truslove passed on, secretly chuckling, to
      his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectability! Assuredly in no other age and in no other
      country had Respectability become so absolute and so
      necessary as in this Victorian England. Southfleet reeked
      of it, if such a virtue could be comparable with a smell.
      Mrs. Pomeroy's private hotel was so utterly respectable
      that the Immaculate Conception itself could not have been a
      fit subject for discussion. Virtue was everywhere, in the
      round-topped, black-seated dining-room chairs, in the
      chaste legs of the tables, in the antimacassars, the pure
      white lace curtains, the sedate wall-papers, and especially
      so in the rather forbidding beds. No one could very well
      imagine unseemly raptures in or on these beds. Mr.
      Truslove, who was something of a Hedonist, had obtained
      permission to supply himself with a special mattress, and
      when he was absent the thing was stored for him in the
      hotel's lumber room, and when he needed it it was taken out
      to air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove's own room had the privilege of being somehow
      male. He was allowed to smoke in it. A pipe-rack and
      tobacco jar stood upon the mantelpiece. It possessed a
      comfortable sofa, which was not too stuffed with virtue, a
      bookcase full of yellow-back novels, and there were
      sporting prints upon the walls. In the cheffonier lived a
      whisky decanter, a bottle of old port and half-a-dozen
      glasses. Even the table advertised a certain ironic
      untidiness, and the one thing Mr. Truslove would not
      tolerate was the tidying up of that same table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove lifted his chair through the French window,
      filled and lit a pipe, and, taking the daily paper with
      him, sat down to digest his dinner. He was a wiry and
      active old gentleman of three and sixty, grizzled,
      sharp-faced, shaven as to chin, but wearing little side
      whiskers which were known as mutton chops. There were
      playful wrinkles round Mr. Truslove's grey-blue eyes, for
      Mr. Truslove--like many old gentlemen--was reverting to the
      mischievous moods of boyhood. He sat and smoked, and,
      surveying life and the sea and sky, left his paper unread
      upon his knees. He could see much of Southfleet from this
      gazebo, and on this summer day it was like a plaque of blue
      and white majolica. The pier thrust a black nose into the
      sea. Immediately below him the trees and shrubberies of
      Caroline Gardens slung a green garland above the foreshore.
      The white Regency curve of Wellington Crescent turned a
      supercilious cheek away from the Old Town, with its pubs,
      its cheap lodging-houses, its pleasure boats, and its black
      old jetty where tubby brigs unloaded coal. Mr. Truslove had
      a fondness for the Old Town. It was more alive and less
      respectable. People got drunk there. On Bank Holidays, if
      you strolled that way in the evening, you might be lucky
      enough to see a fight, or Cockney girls and Cockney lads
      dancing to a barrel organ. Mr. Truslove sat and saw and
      contemplated. This balcony was a good spy-point provided
      Miss Popham did not pop out on her neighbouring balcony,
      and start twittering at you. When this happened Mr.
      Truslove either took his chair inside, or pretended to be
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady passed along by the gardens, a very rustly, silky
      lady with yellow hair and a sprightly bonnet, Mrs. Else,
      who lived at No. 9. Mrs. Else was provocative and
      refreshing. She dared to be deliciously feminine in a world
      that took life in little, ladylike sips. That quidnunc, the
      Rev. John Chatterway, who occupied No. 11, had christened
      her "What Else?", which was pretty, and suggestive when
      coming from the lips of a cleric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove heard a door bang, and saw Rose Pomeroy
      scudding across the road in pursuit of Mrs. Else. Children
      liked the flavicomous lady. She smelled nice and looked
      nice, and was generous with candy and chocolates. Moreover,
      she did not talk to children as though they were
      half-witted and had been born inevitably to original sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove sat up and smiled. Mrs. Else had turned at the
      sound of Rose's pursuing feet, and was waiting for the
      child, but she did not see Mr. Truslove's smile. Moreover,
      Mr. Truslove's smile was somewhat for himself. Three or
      four years ago he had thought of paying court to Mrs. Else,
      but a sage voice within him had said: "You're not up to it,
      my lad; you are to old," and Mr. Truslove had refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, darling," said Mrs. Else, "coming to listen to the
      band with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you indeed, my sweet! It will cost me just four-pence.
      Does your mother--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother's going to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll play Auntie. Come along," and Mrs. Else bent
      down and kissed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove caught himself being sentimental. Why had not
      Mrs. Else children of her own? Just the sort of woman to be
      a mother. What had Else been thinking about, if there had
      been a Mr. Else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady and the child disappeared beyond the green dip of
      the shrubbery where it flowed down Pier Hill, and to
      replace them Tom Swaine's "Victoria" turned the corner by
      the Regent Hotel, and came to rest outside Mrs. Pomeroy's.
      Tom Swaine remained on his box. It was evident that he had
      been ordered. He was an oddity, with a face like Punch, and
      a nose the colour of good red wine. In summer it was light
      claret, in winter port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy appeared, dressed for some occasion, and Mr.
      Truslove, leaning forward, watched her enter the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The station, Swaine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy put up her parasol, and Mr. Truslove lay back
      in his chair. Why the carriage, when the railway station
      was less than half a mile away? Oh, no doubt--prestige.
      Mrs. Pomeroy was becoming a prosperous woman, and
      prosperity deserved its panache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Popham simpered out on to her portion of the
      balcony, and Mr. Truslove hurriedly put his paper over his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damn the woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been caught. There was no time for disappearance.
      Mr. Truslove and Miss Popham played a game together, like
      two of those toy figures in a weather predictor. When one
      popped out the other popped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove produced a snore.

    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy did much of her shopping in St. Paul's
      Church-yard or at the Civil Service Stores in Queen
      Victoria Street. She was a member of the Civil Service
      Stores. Meanwhile, a male person whom the agency appeared
      to have supplied with extraordinary promptitude sat on a
      seat in the vestibule and waited for his new employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old black Gladstone bag was tucked between his feet, and
      the seated figure was as motionless as the bag. Its
      immobility was remarkable, suggesting an extreme docility,
      a peculiar and tame gentleness. The man's greyish hair was
      closely cut, his face clean-shaven. There were wrinkles
      round his quiet eyes. He looked intelligent, almost a man
      of education. His hands rested on his knees with the same
      air of mute passivity. The fingers were roughened, the
      nails worn down. His mouth was the mouth of an ascetic. The
      only liveness seemed in his eyes, and this liveness
      contained a tinge of fear, rather like that of a shy bird
      that has been taken suddenly from darkness into the light.
      He watched the people who came and went, but without moving
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man wore a bowler hat with a high crown, a blue serge
      suit, a white collar and black tie. His boots were
      carefully polished. They had square and bulbous toes, and
      their clumsiness did not match the rest of him. His
      wandering glances, and his stillness expressed a certain
      nervous bewilderment, as though the hurry and bustle of
      life were strange to him. You might have said that he was a
      clockwork figure which would not come alive until you
      turned a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy appeared upon the stairs, slung around with
      parcels. The man did not see her until she was close upon
      him. His face brightened in a sudden smile, and just as
      suddenly became dead. Mrs. Pomeroy's eyes had a peculiarly
      hard glazed look, and the glass was frosted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take these--Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stood up on his thin legs like a figure pulled by a
      string. He gave Mrs. Pomeroy one queer, questioning look,
      and then put out a hand for some of the parcels. He did not
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have ordered you an alpaca coat, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a pair of boots. Eight was the size."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      An additional syllable had slipped off his tongue. Mrs.
      Pomeroy's eyes gave him a sudden and harsh glare. He looked
      frightened, confused, apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Er--thank you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get a cab. You can leave the parcels and your bag. I will
      wait here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him go down the steps and stand for a moment on
      the pavement with that peculiar air of bewilderment. Then,
      he disappeared. Mrs. Pomeroy sat down, picked up his bag,
      put it on her knees, opened it, and ran her hands through
      its contents. It contained nothing but a couple of shirts,
      a spare pair of boots, some underclothing, washing
      "materials," a razor in a case, and a book. The book was a
      Bible. Mrs. Pomeroy opened it, and it so happened that it
      opened where a card had been inserted. Mrs. Pomeroy looked
      at the card, and with a quick movement opened her own
      handbag and tucked the card away in it. Then she examined a
      fly leaf of the Bible, appeared satisfied with her
      inspection, and returned the book to the bag. She had just
      done so when a growler drew up, and Slade, emerging from
      it, came up the steps and looked at her with the eyes of an
      apologetic dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cab, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, Slade--carry down the parcels."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lady had entered the cab her new employee stood
      hesitant upon the kerb. The cabbie's box would not
      accommodate a second person, and Slade appeared to be shy
      of driving with his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get in, Slade--Tell him Fenchurch Street Station."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade spoke to the cabman, slipped his bag into the cab,
      and, entering it, sat down deprecatingly on the seat facing
      his mistress. He kept his feet tucked in, removed his hat,
      and, placing it on his knees, folded his hands over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better repeat to you, Slade, what your duties will
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will clean the knives, the silver and the boots. You
      will carry luggage up and down. You will be responsible for
      the front steps and the gardens. They are only small
      gardens. You will wait at table. You will make yourself
      useful in any other way that I shall indicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy's eyes were resting on his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take more care of your hands, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, you will have to wait at table--Yes, and you
      will have to carry up the coals. And if any of the
      gentlemen should need valeting you will valet them."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the same meek, gentle reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy travelled to Southfleet in the corner of a
      second-class carriage, and James Slade in the corner of a
      third. Mrs. Pomeroy's compartment contained two other
      passengers, a middle-aged couple who had every appearance
      of being profoundly bored with each other. Slade's
      compartment was full, and its complement included an East
      End "Pearly," his wife and two very active children in a
      state of great excitement. It was a holiday affair, and
      both children had buckets and spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade sat tucked in his corner and watched them. He watched
      almost as though they were the first children he had seen
      for years, and their naturalness delighted him. These
      youngsters were so care-free and jolly. They trampled up
      and down from window to window, and chattered and asked
      questions, until their mother reproved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come 'ere and sit darn, Ethel. You're treadin' on the
      gentleman's boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile crinkled round his eyes. Ethel looked at him, and
      Ethel liked him. She too smiled, and made eyes at Mr.
      Slade, and wriggled and sucked a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to the sea, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be jolly fun. Dig on the sands and paddle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel wriggled and, lurching against Mr. Slade's knees, was
      lifted up on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a new 'at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pretty hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where you goin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to Southfleet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother bent forward and addressed Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she's bein' a noosance, mister--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I like children--What's your brother's name,
      my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother answered for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Syd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nicely, mister, thank yer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Father produced a big black bottle. He withdrew the cork,
      wiped the mouth with a handkerchief, and offered the bottle
      to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ave a drop, mister, wiv me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave a sort of shy little bow, accepted the
      bottle, and had a drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tinge of colour came into his pale face. He looked like a
      man who had been starved and ill, and was feeling all the
      better for company, contact and simple humanity. Children
      might be crude little egoists, but they did keep you
      guessing, and reflecting that life was not all stale fish
      and sawdust. Mr. Slade had returned the bottle to his new
      friend, and the coster, having wiped it, offered it to his
      wife. She shook her head at him, and the feather danced in
      her big black hat. To-day she was feeling rather the mother
      and the lady. Her husband, glancing at the traveller
      opposite him, a precise and bearded person with spectacles
      and fierce eyebrows, thought better of it, and refrained.
      He took a pull at the bottle, gurgled, wiped his mouth on
      the back of his hand, and grinned at Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lemme 'ave a drink, dad," said Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll yer muvver say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sydney's mother's response was an emphatic no. Sydney was
      told to put his hat straight. Her husband re-wiped the
      mouth of the bottle, and offered it again to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ave another drop, mister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had another drop, or pretended to do so, and
      passed the bottle back again. The coster had a second pull,
      re-corked the bottle and, nudged by his wife, slipped it
      back into his pocket. Ethel was still making goo-goo
      glances at her new friend. Mr. Slade felt glad that he was
      in this third-class carriage, and not in the second with
      his mistress. Mrs. Pomeroy was a formidable person. Most
      certainly she would not have approved of these vulgar
      people and the black bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coster stood up and reached for something in the rack,
      a concertina. He looked at his fellow traveller, especially
      so at the forbidding gentleman, and then at Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anybody mind a bit o' music?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one objected, and the concertina let out a squawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play--'Disy--Disy.' dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyfink you'd like--particular--mister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you play 'My Old Dutch'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not 'arf--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please play it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The coster began to swing the concertina to and fro, and
      the concert commenced. Ethel rolled to and fro on Mr.
      Slade's knees. Sydney sang in a nasal treble. The severe
      gentleman seemed to pin his eyes and his beard to his book.
      He got out at the next station.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Southfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade kissed both Ethel and Syd, reached for his bag,
      said good-bye to mother and father, and, opening the door,
      stepped out on to the platform. Southfleet station was not
      a beautiful place, but black asphalt, cast iron pillars,
      glass roof, and liverish-coloured paint. Mr. Slade was
      struck by its ugliness, the utilitarian ugliness of that
      most respectable period. He stood there rather like an
      overgrown schoolboy, clutching his bag, and watching for
      the master to appear, as though a homeless creature,
      feeling rather homesick. Mrs. Pomeroy's compartment was
      some twenty yards away. She was at the window, and Mr.
      Slade saw her beckoning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and walked towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door. These handles get so dirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing new gloves, and her bored fellow travellers
      had left the train at the previous station. Slade put down
      his bag, and opened the door for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can bring the parcels out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall take a cab. You will ride on the box with the
      cabman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade seemed to wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, they passed down Southfleet High Street, Slade on the
      box, Mrs. Pomeroy where she had every right to be.
      Southfleet High Street was a medley of the old and the new.
      New yellow brick shops were sandwiched between more mellow
      and red brick buildings. Here and there a garden remained.
      Slade noticed one pleasant old white house with a green
      veranda standing amid trees. The vista ahead of him ended
      in sky and sea, with the blunt end of the pier standing up
      on its long black legs. Ships were passing up and down the
      estuary. The sunlight shone upon the sails of a schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's pretty," thought Mr. Slade, and sighed; "she looks
      like a bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab turned the corner by Caroline Terrace, and Mr.
      Slade saw the pleasant and sunny facade of that Georgian
      Terrace, with its rows of neat windows, its balconies, and
      its little front gardens spread like praying-mats. The
      railings might be green or brown or blue, but each garden
      was of the same colour and pattern, geraniums, lobelia,
      white marguerite, calceolaria. The broad, yellowish roadway
      flowed broad and tranquil towards the setting sun, and on
      the seaward side the old hollies and laurestinus and
      Austrian pines of Caroline Gardens sheltered the smaller
      gardens from the sea wind. A sudden brightness showed in
      Mr. Slade's eyes. The pleasantness of the place surprised
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade climbed down and opened the carriage door, and Mrs.
      Pomeroy got out and told him to carry in the parcels. Slade
      had an armful of them, and was turning towards the central
      doorway of the hotel when a child came running out of
      Caroline Gardens, a pretty, fairish child with gentle eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy had reached the doorway. She faced about, and
      saw Slade standing there like a man most strangely and
      suddenly stricken with palsy. Two of the parcels fell out
      of his arms. He was staring at the child as though some
      almost terrible and miraculous presence had risen to dismay
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy's voice was harsh and quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carry in the parcels at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, dear--come here. I have a present for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy put out a hand and took the child's hand in
      hers, and Slade, still with that look of amazement and
      suffering in his face, watched them disappear. Quite half a
      minute passed before he remembered to pick up the parcels
      that had fallen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Truslove, leaning over the rail of the balcony,
      observed with some interest the person and behaviour of
      Mrs. Pomeroy's new man-of-all-work. In bending down to
      recover the parcels Mr. Slade's bowler hat fell off and
      rolled against the railings. He put down one parcel to
      recover the hat, replaced it, and was stooping once again
      for the parcel when Mrs. Pomeroy's voice came out of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mistress's voice appeared to confuse and agitate the
      new employee. Once more his hat fell off, and wobbled about
      like some inebriated and ridiculous receptacle. Mr.
      Truslove chuckled. Rather a fumbling and ineffectual
      fellow--this! If he played the French clown with dishes and
      plates as he was playing it with his hat and those parcels,
      there would be disaster in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade left his hat there and carried in the parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone together in the hotel hall, and Mrs.
      Pomeroy spoke to him in a strange, fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pull yourself together, you fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade blinked at her. His lips trembled, but no sound came
      from them. He placed the parcels on a chair, and went out
      to recover his hat, bag, and the remaining parcels.
      Meanwhile Tom Swaine was waiting to be paid, and observing
      with sardonic relish the rather futile activities of Mrs.
      P's. new member of the staff. Funny old bloke--this,
      regular fumble-fist. Seemed scared of something. Mrs. P.
      might be a bit of a terror, but why lose your head and your
      hat because a woman was sharp with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pay the cabman. Here is half a crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade deposited his bag and parcels in the hall, took the
      half crown and carried it out to Tom Swaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your fare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank 'ee," said Tom, giving Mr. Slade an ironic wink.
      "Two bob for the job and sixpence for love. If you want a
      bit of advice I'd say--keep yer hat on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was waiting in the hall. She had sent the
      child upstairs, and her immediate concern was the disposal
      of this rather agitated man. She had been observing him
      with dispassionate curiosity. Only to think--! And how she
      had waited for this day, with a kind of calm ferocity, and
      a self-love that did not forgive. Clara Pomeroy was one of
      those women in whom the more human emotions seem to freeze,
      to be replaced by an inexorable love of power, and an
      acquisitive eagerness in possessing that which was hers and
      more than hers. She was what is known as a good hater. She
      did not despise compassion, perhaps--because it was alien
      to her, and she did not understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you your room, Slade. Bring your bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dominance seemed complete. She intended it to be so,
      and it pleased her. She had much to remember, and she did
      not forget what she had suffered in her pride, both of
      purse and of position. She had always said to herself that
      some day someone should pay in personal penance for the
      humiliation she had endured; and life had given her this
      inevitable and inexorable opportunity. She held the
      scourge, and the meek back was at her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way--Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went ahead of him down the stairs into the basement. In
      a dark and narrow passage she opened one door, and then
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is your room. Put your bag down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade appeared to take one quick look around the tiny room
      like a timid animal exploring a cage. The window looked out
      on a white-washed wall, but the upper panes were patterned
      with a fringe of flowers. There was an iron bedstead, an
      old painted chest of drawers with one leg missing, a strip
      of old carpet, a washhand-stand and basin, a cane-bottomed
      chair. Over the chest of drawers was pinned a text--"I will
      repay" saith the Lord. Slade blinked at it. Had the warning
      been placed there for his especial benefit?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here--is your pantry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelves, cupboards, a lead-lined sink, a brass tap. Mrs.
      Pomeroy opened a drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The silver is here. You will see--there is a list fastened
      on that cupboard door. I have checked it. You--will be
      responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The glass is in this cupboard, cleaning materials in that
      other drawer. Behind the door you will find a green baize
      apron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you slippers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will buy you a pair of slippers. You will wear
      them--when you are working about the house. Not, of course,
      when you are waiting at table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you had better unpack. Supper is at seven. For the
      first day or two Florence had better help you with your
      duties."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      James Slade sat down on his cane-bottomed chair. It wobbled
      and creaked under him. His bowler hat lay on the bed,
      looking like a great black tumour swelling from the cheap
      blue counterpane. He stared at the white-washed wall of the
      area and the fringe of flowers in the garden above, with
      the sunlight shining through them. It occurred to him that
      this underground room would be very dark in winter, and
      that it seemed a strange economy to burrow into the ground
      when there was so much earth at man's service. By what
      light would he go to bed and get up on dark winter
      mornings? A candlestick standing on the chest of drawers
      answered that question. His glance travelling round the
      walls, remained fixed upon the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--will--repay," saith the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that Clara's judgment upon him? Had she planned and
      ordered this penance? Well, according to Clara no doubt he
      deserved it. He may have been a desperate fool, but Clara
      was not the sort of woman to tolerate folly, especially
      when it ended in failure. And he was a complete failure, a
      disgraced failure, and all through the years that had
      passed he had learned to accept failure, or material
      failure. Yet there was that other spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--the--child!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had Clara kept it from him? Had her secretiveness been
      inspired by cruelty or kindness? Kindness--to the child, of
      course. Wasn't that obvious? Would he not have chosen
      silence, the blank page, the closed book? Yes, most
      certainly, for the child's sake, in this most respectable
      world--and yet--!
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be pain in too much thinking. The world that he
      had lived in for the last seven years had taught James
      Slade that it was better that a man should have sore
      fingers than a sore soul, unless--of course--he had
      discovered that faith which is an assuagement and a balm.
      Yes, that and God. If God was with you people might not
      matter so much. The thing was to be busy, and James Slade
      got up, hung his hat on a peg behind the door, and, lifting
      his bag on to the chair, opened it and began to unpack. The
      bag contained all his worldly possessions, such as they
      were, a couple of cheap shirts, a pair of pants, a vest,
      three white collars, a razor, two nightshirts, a
      sponge-bag, and his Bible. James Slade lifted out the
      Bible, and opened it in search of a particular object, his
      legal label. It had gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and stared at the open book. It had opened at the
      Gospel of St. John. Then he ran his fingers quickly through
      the pages to make sure. The card was not there. Had Clara
      taken it? But how and when? When she had sent him for the
      cab? Oh, possibly. Clara was taking no chances. She had
      impounded that passport to partial freedom as she appeared
      to have impounded his person. James Slade closed the Bible
      and placed it on the chest of drawers, and proceeded to
      unpack and put away his possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did own one leaf torn from the book of the past, a
      relic of whose existence Mrs. Pomeroy was ignorant, and,
      having completed his unpacking, James Slade sat down on the
      bed and let his fingers explore the inner breast pocket of
      his coat. He glanced at the door. There was neither key nor
      bolt. So, even his privacy was relative! Well, a chair
      might prevent a sudden invasion, and, having cocked the
      chair with its top rail under the handle, James Slade sat
      down again on the very hard bed, and brought out his relic.
      It was a very old and faded photograph, showing a comely
      young woman seated with her husband standing behind her.
      The man was smiling rather fatuously, the young woman
      looking straight into the camera, a very hard and handsome
      and determined young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade smiled at his own silly smile. How well he
      remembered the photographer's appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smile, sir, if you please. Just moisten the lips, and
      smile. That's better--much better. Now, quite still,
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      But footsteps were to be heard on the basement stairs. Mr.
      Slade smuggled the picture back into his pocket, and jumped
      up to remove the protective chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Florence, a below-stairs Florence, who spoke as she
      pleased and in the vernacular about the above-stairs order.
      She had no reason to be shy of this elderly man, and she
      was not shy of him. Mr. Slade did not look capable of
      killing a flea, and Florence was ready to address him as
      Dad. In fact, in a week's time the below-stairs world was
      to know him as Dad, and to accord him respect and a growing
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She--says I've got to tell you about things. My name's
      Floe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade placed the chair for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Florence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence sat down. Mr. Slade could be considered the
      perfect gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mind if I do. On my feet most of the day, and she
      chasing you round. And I've got a corn that nothin' won't
      touch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," said Mr. Slade. "Have you tried Bland's Corn
      Solvent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I 'aven't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you try it. Is it a hard or soft corn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard. Right on m' little toe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you try it. Now, what about giving me a little
      advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florrie took a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposin' I tell you about some of the blokes. There's ol'
      Truslove, fussy and all that, but 'e ain't a bad sort, and
      'e's better than some of the ol' women. 'E's always served
      first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, before the ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, 'e's a perm., and he pays more than anybody else.
      But p'raps I'd better begin about 'Er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Pomeroy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus. She can be a fair terror. Don't you ever answer 'er
      back. And don't try no tricks with the sugar. I believe she
      counts every blessed lump. And you've always got to appear
      to be doin' somethink--even if you ain't got anythink to
      do. Just flick a duster abart, or make believe your
      polishin' somethink. Don't you ever let 'er catch you
      sittin' down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence paused to draw a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says you're going to do the boots and the coal and the
      luggage, and wait at table, and clean the silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you be very partic'lar about the plates and the
      forks. She's dead nuts on a dirty plate. And don't you go
      offerin' second 'elpings to the third floor, specially the
      third floor backs. She--don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Truslove, I presume, has--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, 'e always can 'ave a third, if 'e wants it. So can Mr.
      Spiceby, and Miss Popham. You treat the first floors to
      anythink, and sometimes the seconds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see--Florence. Various gradations and values."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, you do use long words. And don't you use too much
      blackin' on the old women's boots, and be careful of the
      coal. She's got an eye like an 'awk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Florence. Tell me, she has a daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Rose. She's a fair little pet. Don't know where
      she got 'er nice nature from. Not from 'Er. Must 'ave been
      old Pom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who and what was old Pom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ask me--that's a bit of a mystery. Lawks--"
      and Florrie giggled--"we do say in the kitchen that there
      wasn't a Mr. Pom. Cos she's so respectable, goes to church
      reg'lar. But 'e must 'ave been a good sort must Mr. Pom,
      judgin' by the kid. Can't see as 'ow she got a nice nature
      from 'er mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled vaguely at this fanciful picture of a gay
      and gallant Mr. Pomeroy. Well, well, well, Florence was
      proving valuable as the hotel cicerone, and the advice she
      was giving him was both intimate and technical. Had
      Florence five minutes leisure? If so Mr. Slade would be
      glad to be shown the intricacies of the basement. Florence
      was more than willing. The staff tea was at half-past five
      in the kitchen, and at nine there was a spot of supper,
      bread and dripping, and sometimes cheese. The hotel took
      its supper at seven. So, Mr. Slade was led along a dark
      passage to the kitchen and was introduced to Eliza the
      cook, May the kitchen-maid, and Jane and Bertha the
      housemaids. Eliza was fat and fiftyish, with fierce black
      eyebrows and an incipient moustache. She looked formidable,
      and was not, provided her authority was not flouted and no
      one complained of the soup. May was a cheeky little blonde,
      with bright blue eyes. Jane had a dark, slim dignity.
      Bertha was brown and pink-cheeked and very sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave Eliza a polite little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza looked him over as though she had mistrusted the
      novelty of having a man messing about the place, but there
      was a shyness about this gentle and elderly man that
      somehow moved the maternal soul in Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had your tea, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact I haven't. But please don't trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't any trouble. May, put the kettle on again. It'll
      be ready in five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you very much. A cup of tea is a comfort. Meanwhile
      Florence is going to show me round."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade was introduced to the coal-cellar, and the
      cupboard where brooms, etc., were kept, and to the back
      stairs which led up into the back garden, and the wine
      cellar which, of course, was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beer and stout, mostly," said Florence, "and ain't she
      careful about it. Not 'alf."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Eliza, whose surname was Cotgrove, had
      given it as her opinion that Mr. Slade was a nice,
      gentlemanly old chap, and that he looked a bit starved, and
      needed feeding up. And he wouldn't be any bother about the
      place, and didn't look the sneaky sort--neither. The
      kitchen had been somewhat prejudiced against a strange
      importation in trousers, some fellah--who--as Mrs. Eliza
      put it--might have upset the girls.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had been given leave to go out. Florrie had
      brought him the gracious permission from above-stairs, and
      also a sheet of notepaper in an envelope upon which Mrs.
      Pomeroy had recorded the hotel's decalogue, so far as he
      was concerned. On this first evening he was to be allowed
      his freedom, such as it was, because neither his boots nor
      his coat were quite suitable for waiting at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put on his bowler hat, and left the hotel by the
      area steps. He understood that he was not to appear
      above-stairs, save when on duty. Finding himself in the
      broad roadway between the terrace and Caroline Gardens, Mr.
      Slade was attracted to the gardens, only to find that the
      gate was guarded by a gardener in a green coat and red
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ticket, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade explained that he was not a ticket-holder, but
      that he came from the Caroline Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good enough. Mrs. P's. a subscriber. All residents
      are admitted, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener swung the iron gate open, and Mr. Slade
      entered with a "Thank you," and a gentle and secret
      chuckle. So, authority had taken him for a resident! He
      found himself in a broad alleyway between hollies and
      laurestinus, with seats tucked away in green recesses. It
      was a warm June evening, and Mr. Slade, discovering an
      empty seat, sat down to read Mrs. Pomeroy's table of the
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to be allowed one free afternoon and evening a
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to return punctually at ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      All public houses were forbidden him. Well--that was a
      superfluous precaution, as he had no money in his pocket,
      and wages had not been mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sundays he would attend evening service at St. John's
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to rise at six each morning and go to bed at ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to waste candles by reading in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His laundry would be charged to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would take his meals in the staff kitchen, but he would
      not be allowed to loiter there. When not on duty he would
      remain in his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, having read the rules of his new prison-house,
      folded up the paper, and tucked it away in his pocket.
      Well, well, well, he might be a free man on probation, but
      Clara's supervision promised to be more stringent than that
      of the Law. Yet could he blame her? Life had taught James
      Slade to be chary of attributing blame to poor humanity. So
      often it could not help itself, but blundered and
      floundered towards disaster, just as he had done. Moreover,
      Clara had fought her fight, and, like some indomitable
      Amazon, beaten off the assaults of bitter misfortune. She
      had a home, property, a prosperous business of her own
      creating, and Rose. Mr. Slade sat with a little shimmery
      smile on his face, and meditated upon the amazing reality
      of Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be pain here, and secret pangs, and a surrender
      and sinking of self that might fill him with a feeling of
      starved frustration. However much he might yearn over, the
      child, it was right and inevitable that she should never
      know, or have her future in this most respectable world
      clouded by the consciousness of shame. Even the fictitious
      Mr. Pomeroy was dead, as dead as Dickens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade got up and wandered. He was in a wandering mood,
      like a child let out of school, only much more so, for such
      vagrant moods had for years been denied him. It might have
      been said of him by the clever and the critical that he had
      become simple-minded, which was not quite true. The more
      urgent greeds of the flesh had departed from him. Indeed,
      he was returning to the world like a child, and a rather
      innocent child, as a serene and celibate old man who had
      regained the wonder of childishness. Strange as it might
      seem, the penal life he had led had not coarsened or
      debauched him. On the contrary, he had found God.
    </p>
    <p>
      How pleasant was the greenness of these chestnut trees! Mr.
      Slade had passed the white portico of the Regent Hotel, and
      the buxom bow-front of Prospect House, the doctor's house.
      Here, in the High Street, the old timber-yard remained,
      with the evening sunlight shining on its chestnut trees.
      Mr. Slade looked up into the green canopies that seemed
      layered with gold. How gentle and good and comforting were
      trees! The doors of the sawing-shed were shut, the saw
      silent, the engine asleep. Great boles of timber were
      stacked in the yard, and piles of newly-ripped planks. A
      huge heap of sawdust was lit up by the light through the
      trees. Here were the quick and the dead, sap and mere
      sawdust, and yet there was beneficence in the labour of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade wandered back to the broad space above the pier
      hill. What a pleasant prospect, the sea, ships, the
      greenness of the gardens, the white curve of the Crescent,
      the black holly hedges guarding the broad way leading to
      the church. The windows of Caroline Terrace caught the
      oblique sunlight and flashed it back; the little gardens
      glowed; the sloping green roofs of the balconies were
      homely and warm. Mr. Slade felt like a child, wondering at
      the beauty of things as he saw them, and content to see
      them like that. Life might have its sorrows and its
      frustrations, but, if God stood with you, fear might cease
      from troubling your soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade turned to walk down the hill, and as he did so a
      small boy ran up to him, a brown-faced, freckled child in a
      sailor suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, could you tell me the time, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's right hand went by instinct to the place where
      the watch-chain should be. There was no chain there. The
      habit of long ago had been suddenly resurrected after the
      long lapse of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear, I have left my watch at home. I am sorry, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it is seven o'clock yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it must be."
    </p>

      "I promised mother I would be in at seven. I've been out
      with Mr. Clements in his boat; I'm learning to row. Look,
      I've got a blister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better run home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear. One musn't break promises--or blisters." The
      boy smiled up at him and ran on towards Caroline Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood a moment, and then walked on. Funny about
      that watch and chain! They had been of gold, and he had
      left them behind with Clara, yes and rather secretly so,
      for he had left poor Clara so little. Then, after all these
      years, memory had played him a trick, and he had felt for
      the watch that was--where? Pawned or sold long ago, no
      doubt. How your old self suddenly was resurrected! But not
      as it had been, or could be. Clara had been very frank in
      her judgment upon that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give you a chance to rehabilitate yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rehabilitate! Rather a pompous phrase--that! Clara always
      had had a liking for such words. Rehabilitate--but not
      resurrect. Men such as he had been did not rise again from
      the dead, to be reclad in the garments of respectability.
      Respectability! Horrid word! But what a nice, frank,
      freckled face the boy had shown him. Children, perhaps,
      were not bothered by the problems of respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade strolled down the hill to the more plebian part
      of Southfleet, where respectability was of less account and
      the language far simpler. Passing the pier entrance he
      paused, provoked by the wooden turnstile and the apostolic
      face of the old man who sat at the receipt of customs. It
      cost you the sum of a penny to pass that turnstile, and Mr.
      Slade had not a penny upon him. The Law had set him free
      with two half-crowns in his pocket, but Mrs. Pomeroy--as a
      precaution--had insisted upon his handing over such petty
      cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly, the petty cash promised to be a serious problem.
      Wages had not been mentioned. But, surely, he would be the
      recipient of some tips, and Mrs. Pomeroy could hardly
      expect him to pass on the largess? Or, would he be like a
      schoolboy to whom the mistress of the house would assign
      sixpence per week?
    </p>
    <p>
      The hairy and apostolic head of old Rawlins poked itself
      through the ticket-office window. Old Rawlins was always
      ready for gossip, for his was a sedentary and a monotonous
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinkin' of going on, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is rather late, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We close at dusk. 'Ardly worth a penny unless you want a
      peep at the sunset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see the sunset from here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you can, sir. 'Ave to close at dusk, you know, for
      the sake of respectability."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rawlins chuckled and then sucked his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The seats 'ud be full o' lovers, canoodlin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't see any great objection to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Rawlins winked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor me. But this 'ere town is a temple of respectability.
      Such goin's on can't be allowed in public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But young people must fall in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not 'ere, sir, in a public place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems rather hard on the lovers. Does the public expect
      them just to walk up and down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, sir, but not sit down, much less lie down,
      'cept--where you can't see 'em or tread on 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--where do they go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again old Rawlins winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where lots of those there respec'able ladies would like to
      be, tee-hee, under the bushes on the cliff. Gawd, sir,
      there's a lot o' ruddy 'umbug in this 'ere world. Funny,
      ain't it, that it should be respec'able to be a muvver or a
      farver--but the business of doin' of it--is shockin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade indulged in a gentle chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it does seem strange, doesn't it. Well, I think I'll
      take a little stroll along by the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't cost you nothin', sir. The respec'able ol' cats
      can't keep the tide from comin' in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade strolled on, a little bothered by the propensity
      both these old gate-keepers had shown towards addressing
      him as "sir." Was it a tribute to his age, and did he look
      as old as all that, or had he failed to lose the
      characteristics of his caste? Well, if that was so, Clara
      might have something to say about it, for Clara had always
      had a lot to say about everything. He would have to learn
      to play his part, helped by a green baize apron and shirt
      sleeves; and any mild aroma of gentility that still clung
      to him might be excused on the plea that he had been butler
      to a Bishop. Yes, that was an idea! He might even dare to
      suggest it to Clara! Moreover, life might be more simple
      and easy and comforting were he allowed to become an
      obscure member of the lower orders, and attain to the
      distinction of being classed as common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade wandered along the esplanade as far as the Ship
      Hotel and Vandevord's Jetty. There were many more people
      here, though Southfleet's full season did not flourish
      until August, but the old town had a hearty human
      smelliness that could be refreshing. You could buy
      shrimp-teas, and whelks and cockles, and play on the
      concertina, and dance in the middle of the road. The old
      town was the East End's playground, and when it played it
      did not say--"Excuse me." But the pleasure yachts were
      berthed for the night, and the sixpennorth of sea-sickness
      over. The pubs were fulfilling their functions, and in the
      yard of the Ship Inn a fight was in progress between a
      large and clumsy mariner and a little coster from London.
      Mr. Slade crossed over and joined the crowd, and was glad
      to see that the little man was getting the best of it,
      skipping around and fooling the large and truculent fellow,
      and smashing his fists in his face. Mr. Slade sighed, eased
      his hat, and passed on. Well, that might prove a happy
      omen. He himself was up against a very large and truculent
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing dark when Mr. Slade returned to Caroline
      Terrace, and blinds were down and curtains drawn. His mood
      was for a short sojourn on one of the garden seats, for the
      day had been a long and exciting one, and James Slade
      suddenly felt tired. But the garden gate was locked for the
      night, so he leaned against the railings under the shadow
      of a holly, and looked across at the terrace. Familiarity
      had not yet bred acquiescence, and there were many things
      about this respectable world that struck Mr. Slade as being
      peculiar. Why pull down blinds and draw curtains on a
      summer night? Why shut out the air and the stars? Why
      cultivate a prim stuffiness? Or was this a sign and a
      symbol of the respectable world in which all the natural
      nudities of life were covered up and concealed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Propriety was a universal petticoat sweeping the pavement,
      but hiding such indecent things as legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he rather wanted to go to bed. He toddled across the
      roadway, and, spotting the Caroline Hotel lettered upon the
      glass panel above the door, he groped for the area gate and
      descended into the gloom. A sudden scuffling sound
      surprised him. He became aware of two dim figures abruptly
      disentangling themselves. One figure withdrew to the far
      end of the area; the other vanished through a doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade cleared his throat, dallied for a second or two
      and then entered by the self-same door. In the dim light of
      the passage he found Florrie waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, only me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't tell on me, will you? Just my brother came to
      see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I won't tell, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, you're an old sport, you are. You see, she's got such
      a nasty suspicious mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you worry, my dear. You can have twenty brothers to
      see you, and I shan't see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florrie kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must 'ave been young, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear; once--I was."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      The bed which Mrs. Pomeroy had provided for him was a hard
      one, but James Slade was accustomed to harder beds than
      this, and he accepted it as a couch of his own making, but
      before going to bed he kneeled down by it and read by
      candle-light a portion of his Bible. The passage happened
      to contain that saying--"Blessed are the meek, for they
      shall inherit the earth," and, though James Slade meditated
      upon that text after blowing out his candle, he did not
      foresee himself inheriting anything. Even a dog would be
      denied him in a place such as this; as for the child--Mr.
      Slade could not bring himself to think too much of her. She
      was no more than a pretty thing in a picture hung well out
      of reach, and he knew that Clara would keep it out of
      reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was very tired. The very strangeness of it all
      had tired him, and he slept like a child, but he did not
      wake like a child. Urgent responsibilities were upon him,
      and they sat up with him in bed. The subterranean window of
      his monk's cell was an open eye, and James Slade, having no
      watch to advise him, threw the clothes back and emerged.
      Six o'clock was the official hour. Was it six o'clock yet?
      Assuredly he must persuade his mistress to allow him a
      watch, though it might be only a five shilling Waterbury.
      Mr. Slade, still in his nightshirt, opened the door, and
      stood listening. Was the house awake yet? He could not hear
      any movement in it, but to make safety doubly sure he
      slipped into socks, shirt and trousers and crept out in
      search of a clock. From somewhere came the sound of solemn
      and deliberate ticking, and Mr. Slade, having located the
      sound, pursued it. The clock was in the kitchen. It stood
      on the mantelshelf. It had a large white face, and below it
      the picture of a windmill standing in a patch of greenness
      against a very blue sky. It was a supercilious, bare-faced
      snob of a clock, and it seemed to stare contemptuously at
      Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tick-tock, it's only half-past five, you silly old fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went back to his room to wash and shave himself.
      Cold water had to serve for that operation. Had he been
      more bold he might have tried the tap of the kitchen
      boiler, but on this first morning he was very meek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza and the other maids slept in the basement, with iron
      bars at their windows to discourage burglars, and to
      preserve their morals. Mr. Slade had no bars to his window,
      but there were other and impalpable bars confining his
      soul. He put on his green baize apron, took a broom, and
      moved towards the kitchen stairs. It was more than probable
      that Mrs. Pomeroy might be up and about to satisfy herself
      that Slade was beginning his new life with punctuality and
      precision, and James was still very much in awe of Clara.
      She held him like a little old mannikin in the hollow of
      her hand. Mr. Slade's inspiration was to begin work by
      sweeping the doorsteps and the paved paths between the
      little gardens. Should Mrs. P. poke her head out of her
      window she would see him at work below. Mr. Slade had
      reached the foot of the basement stairs and had begun to
      ascend them when he heard other footsteps coming from
      above. So quick and soft and tumultuous were they that
      James Slade was puzzled. Could Florrie or May or Bertha be
      coming down like this? Besides-- But he was allowed no time
      to meditate upon the significance of these fluttering feet.
      A small, vague figure poured down the stairs upon him in
      the half-light, tried to stop, overbalanced, and was caught
      in James Slade's arms. He had dropped his broom in time for
      the complete embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold up, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second the child seemed frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little warm figure in its nightdress went rigid and
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm the new--man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course. You're Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the child relax. She let him set her on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just come down to see Eliza. You won't tell, will
      you, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza lets me get into her bed. She keeps a box of
      goodies--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade nodded his head at her and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Goodies--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother won't let me have sweets. She says it is bad
      for my teeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have pretty teeth, my dear. I don't think that Eliza's
      sweets will do much harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child smiled back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good, my dear. Go on liking old Slade. Now, hadn't
      you better go to Eliza. Supposing--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Perhaps I had better go back upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pop back into bed. Yes, I think I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little bit of tidying up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child turned and scurried back up the stairs, and Mr.
      Slade, having watched her little pink feet disappearing,
      ascended and unlocked and unbolted the front door. He had a
      sudden strange feeling that other doors had been unbolted
      for him. Well, well, well! He whistled softly as he looked
      at the morning, and began to sweep the steps and paths. The
      flowers in the small garden were wet with dew, and there
      was this other dewy thing so near him in this new world.
      Clara might be her mother, but somehow the child might be
      nearer to him than she was to Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade bent over the railings and put his nose to the
      wet flowers.

    <p>
      Boots!
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade remembered that the business of the day began
      with boots. The working part of the hotel was now awake,
      pulling up blinds and drawing curtains, sweeping and
      dusting, lighting the kitchen fire, preparing to carry up
      shaving water, laying the breakfast-table, thinking of
      fried sausages, bacon and eggs. Mr. Slade hurried upstairs
      in slippers and baize apron to collect the hotel boots. It
      would not do for him to be late with boots on this, his
      first morning. And, obviously, you began with the first
      floor, and particularly with Mr. Truslove, who was an early
      riser and liked five minutes' stroll before breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's new self-education commenced with the
      collecting of boots, and on that first morning he made a
      most horrid mess of it. So eager was he to be punctual in
      the polishing of shoe-leather that he gathered boots
      haphazard into his green apron, and bundled them
      downstairs, quite forgetting to identify each pair by
      marking them with chalk. Brushes and blacking were ready to
      hand on a shelf in the pantry cupboard, and Mr. Slade
      paraded his boots and got busy. Which was the Truslove
      boots? God Almighty, but he had muddled up the hotel
      footgear! Here was a pretty problem!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh--agony and bloody sweat! In his dismay he went in search
      of Florrie, and found her busy in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Florrie, my dear, I've muddled up the boots. What--am--I
      to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawks, you don't say so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do say so. Can your--identify--the--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have a try, Dad. I should know most of 'em," so
      Florrie hurried down below with him, and set herself to
      sort out the footgear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them's Mr. Truslove's. Buttons. He's fussy about boots and
      likes 'em smart. Yes, that's Popham's, them with the new
      laces. Those bobbly ones are Sawkins'; he 'as corns. Them's
      Miss Goodbody's, the prim ones with pointed toes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the selection was carried through, and Mr. Slade,
      finding a stubby pencil and an odd bit of paper, scribbled
      down the various names, and dropped an improvised label
      into each boot. God be thanked, Florrie had saved the
      situation for him, and was repaying him for blindness as to
      brothers. He set to work on Mr. Truslove's boots, and,
      having polished them with extreme care until the toecaps
      shone like polished gilt, and, remembering that Mr.
      Truslove was an early riser, he decided to carry Mr.
      Truslove's boots upstairs and deposit them outside his
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the act of placing them on the mat when Mr.
      Truslove's door opened, and Mr. Truslove, in dressing-gown
      and nightshirt, and with a rather tousled head, surprised
      James Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your boots, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha--boots," said Mr. Truslove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I carry them in, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, give 'em to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was looking curiously at the new manservant.
      Then he glanced at the boots, holding them up to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope they are satisfactory, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite. Let's see, what's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might run down and get my shaving water, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel like getting out early."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went down for the shaving water, and Mr.
      Truslove, having put the boots on the floor, looked at
      himself in the mirror, and caressed a stubbly chin. Now,
      what was there funny about the fellow? His voice, his
      language, the cut of his jib? Decent, respectable sort of
      old chap, but somehow more than that. Might be a fellow who
      had come down in the world; might be younger than he
      looked. Mr. Truslove was in the act of getting into his
      trousers when the knock came at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your water, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring it in, Slade. That's right, stand it in the basin.
      Been in service before, I take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. Anything else I can do for you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at the moment. Thank you, Slade. I'm rather glad
      there's a man about the place. Can you press trousers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll look 'em out later, and lay 'em on a chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hurried away to complete his business of the
      boots, and Mr. Truslove, lathering his chin, supposed that
      Slade had been in good service, and was accustomed to
      waiting upon gentlemen, and so had picked up the graces of
      a gentleman's gentleman. Yes, perhaps that explained it.
      Mrs. Pomeroy was not the sort of woman to buy a pig in a
      poke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last pair of boots had been dealt with when Mr. Slade
      heard Florrie calling him. It was half-past seven, and the
      staff breakfast was ready in the kitchen. Mr. Slade removed
      his apron and put on his jacket, and in doing so he was
      wiser than he knew, for Mrs. Eliza ruled in the kitchen,
      and liked things just so. Mr. Slade bade Mrs. Eliza good
      morning, addressing her as Mrs. Cotgrove, and Eliza
      returned the compliment by addressing him as Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your chair, Mr. Slade. You can take the other end
      of the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, feeling himself in a friendly atmosphere, took
      what was to be his appointed place, though, before many
      weeks had passed, his end was to become the head of the
      table, Mrs. Eliza relinquishing her supreme authority to a
      man who was to become known as Dad. Mrs. Cotgrove poured
      out tea, and the bacon or the sausages were served
      according to seniority. Yet, on this morning, Mr. Slade
      found the dish passed to him first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After you, ma'am," said he to Mrs. Cotgrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You help yourself, Mr. Slade," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade helped himself, but not greedily so, and remarked
      that it was a lovely morning. Mrs. Cotgrove accepted this
      piece of information as news, she not having put her head
      outside her kitchen. Eliza sugared the other cups, but as a
      special favour the sugar-bowl was sent to Mr. Slade. He
      took one lump, and his restraint did not pass unnoticed.
      Sugar was precious, for Mrs. P. handed it out daily from
      the store-cupboard, just as though she was doling out
      pieces of gold. Meanwhile, Mr. Slade was thinking that the
      elderly woman with the fierce black eyebrows must be less
      formidable than she seemed, if a child ran downstairs to
      get into bed with her, sweets or no sweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, feeling it his duty to make conversation, asked
      whether it would be possible for him to be supplied with a
      hot iron some time during the day. Mr. Truslove's trousers
      needed pressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come to me for it," said Mrs. Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, ma'am. I don't want to interfere in any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No trouble, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled and looked shyly up and down the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I say that I feel among friends. If it hadn't been for
      Miss Florence--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Florrie winked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you get 'em all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sincerely hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's them?" asked Mrs. Cotgrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boots, ma'am. I got muddled up with the boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      May giggled and was looked at severely by Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to snigger at, young woman. I'm sure it was most
      natural-like for Mr. Slade to--be--a bit puzzled--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't sniggerin'," said May.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean--not at Mr. Slade. I wouldn't like to clean old
      Sawkins' boots. He don't change 'is socks more than--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be vulgar, my girl," said Mrs. Cotgrove.

    <p>
      In a recess in Mrs. Pomeroy's private room and office stood
      her safe. Perched upon a stout oak stool, and draped with a
      kind of altar-cloth of red velvet, it did not look like a
      safe, but few things in the Caroline Hotel looked like what
      man and nature had intended them to be. The ladies wore
      bustles, Mrs. Pomeroy a very pronounced one, a strange
      fashion at a period when no physical bulge or curve below
      the neck was recognised in polite society. Everything was
      draped, the mirror, the mantelpiece, the tables; it was an
      age of valences, antimacassars, bric-a-brac, ormulu.
      Moreover, if an article of furniture could not be draped,
      it might be painted. Coal-boxes had their lids decorated
      with bouquets of roses; bullrushes and water-flags were
      painted upon mirrors. Pampas grass speared out of tall
      vases. Artifice was more than artifice. It was an
      abomination and a curse to those who had to dust it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy turned back her red velvet altar-cloth, and
      unlocked her safe. It was--in fact--her holy of holies.
      With strong, plump, deliberate hands she withdrew from the
      safe a small black deed-box and a cash-box. She placed them
      upon the centre table almost with the solemnity of a priest
      placing the sacrificial emblems on the altar. Then, she
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells were to prove one of the most prevalent problems in
      James Slade' new world. A whole row of them hung in the
      passage outside his pantry. Each bell had a letter or a
      number painted in white upon it, D. for dining-room, P. for
      parlour or drawing-room, O. for office, No. 1 for Mr.
      Truslove. You might hear a bell ring, but by the time you
      had bolted into the passage its metallic voice might have
      died away. You had to spot the still-vibrating bell, and so
      identify it. Moreover, it was an age when everyone rang
      bells on the slightest provocation, if coal was needed on
      the fire, if a book had been mislaid, even if some old lady
      had dropped her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was cleaning the silver when he heard that
      particular bell. It might not be his business to answer it,
      but he had been warned of the sanctity of bells, and of the
      immediate response that was to be expected. Also, the
      swiftness of the response might depend upon the eminence of
      the particular bell which called for service. No. 1 was to
      be answered instantly. No. 19 might be dallied with, even
      ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, a tablespoon in one hand, a leather in the
      other, hurried out to identify the claimant. O was still in
      a state of motion. Mr. Slade's mouth rounded itself to an
      expressive O!--Oh--Clara! Was that for him? If so, he had
      been expecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting spoon and leather aside, he slipped into his
      jacket, and, feeling a little breathless, climbed the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade knocked at Mrs. Pomeroy's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by Mrs. Pomeroy herself. She did not
      utter a word, but waved him in with an imperious sweep of
      the hand, and then closed the door upon him. Mr. Slade
      stood meekly on the hearthrug, and memory stood with him
      upon just some other day. Mrs. Pomeroy had turned the key.
      She walked to the table, opened the cashbox, took out two
      sovereigns, and laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boots and an alpaca jacket. Chignell's in the High Street
      for the jacket."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost it was like a game of Dumb Crambo, a silent show,
      and had anybody been eavesdropping they would have been
      none the wiser. Mrs. P. opened the deed box, removed a
      package from it, and replaced it on the table. It was tied
      with red tape, and under the tape lay a photograph, a very
      revealing picture. Mrs. Pomeroy waved a hand over the
      exhibit. The gesture said--"It is all there, the complete
      dossier. You will do well to remember it." Mr. Slade smiled
      a little wincing smile, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy turned and took a sheet of paper from her
      desk. She handed it to James Slade and her eyes
      said--"Read, mark, and inwardly digest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade read what she had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not speak to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      I claim restitution in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will consider it generous of me to give you a home, and
      an opportunity to reform yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's hand trembled slightly as he held the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite understand, madam, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no buts, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the paper from him, and returned it to her desk,
      to be converted later into ash. James Slade moistened his
      lips. He had something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About wages, madam? You see--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will depend upon the satisfaction you give. I will
      allow you to retain tips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the two sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go out and buy boots and a jacket. If there is any money
      left over I will allow you to keep it. You will help
      Florence to-day in the dining-room. Watch what she does and
      educate yourself. That is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She unlocked the door, and as he passed out she spoke to
      him in a voice of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those will be your duties, Slade. Are you quite clear
      about them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade went shopping, but even while Mr. Chignell was
      trying coats on him, James Slade was repeating to himself
      those fatal and unforgiving words, "You will not speak to
      the child." Was she indeed his child? Or had Clara been
      guilty of some indiscretion? So far as he could remember
      there had been no-- But, tut-tut, did dates and
      calculations matter? Even if Clara had, in the desperate
      crisis he had imposed upon her, accepted more than sympathy
      from some other man, could he blame her? Yet, what an
      impossible condition was this! Was he to smile at the
      child, and be mute, and to refuse to answer her if she
      spoke to him? Clara had become too much the Queen
      Elizabeth, a woman whom her own servants regarded as an
      enemy. How many lies must have been fobbed off on good
      Queen Bess! Mr. Chignell, meanwhile, was running his hands
      over Mr. Slade's collar and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's much better, sir. Quite a nice fit. Please look in
      the glass, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade glanced in the mirror, and saw his own poor
      sorrowful face and narrow shoulders. He thought that he
      looked a meagre little man, not the man who should have--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that seems to fit me. How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventeen and six, sir. A very cheap coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything else to-day, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chignell wrapped up the coat and made cheerful
      conversation. Was Mr. Slade a visitor or a new resident?
      Ah, a resident. Good. Mr. Chignell handed over the parcel
      and the change, and hoped that he would see Mr. Slade
      again. He opened the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good day, sir, and thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went in search of boots. He was rather sensitive
      about his socks. He suspected a hole over the right big
      toe, and was ready to apologise for it, but no hole was
      there, and Mr. Slade felt easier. He saved seven and
      sixpence on the boots, and found himself in the High Street
      with ten shillings in hand. Could he dare to buy a couple
      of new collars and a tie? And he possessed only two
      handkerchiefs. One would be in the wash, and the other in
      action. But if he had a cold? He did so dare, and felt
      quite a desperate devil, an absolute pirate. Rather nice to
      be able to shop like this. He would like to have bought
      Rose a box of chocolates, but such devilry would be much
      too desperate. Besides a few shillings in hand might be
      regarded as absolutely necessary. He returned to Caroline
      Terrace richer by four shillings, seven pence, three
      farthings. It was with satisfaction and mild pride that he
      hung up his new jacket, and put his collar and ties away,
      also four handkerchiefs. Almost he felt opulent. Thank
      Heaven it was summer and he would not need an overcoat as
      yet. If tips accumulated he might be able to afford an
      overcoat before the winter without having to play the
      suppliant to Clara.

    <p>
      Dinner proved something of a disaster for poor J. S. He
      felt like a young actor none too sure of his part and
      taking the stage for the first time. Everybody seemed to be
      looking at him, which, of course, was not so. The meal
      began with soup, pea soup, and Mrs. Pomeroy had given
      orders that it was to be served from the sideboard. Mr.
      Slade grabbed the ladle and gave Florence a look of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take the plates round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence humoured him. Why did poor old Dad look so scared?
      What was there to be afraid of? So, Mr. Slade ladled out
      the soup, and Florence, with a plate in each hand, did the
      serving. The second course was roast-beef, Yorkshire
      pudding and vegetables, and again Mr. Slade funked the
      crisis. He had not carved a joint for many years, and he
      handed the tools to Florrie. A meat plate was not a soup
      plate, and Mr. Slade thought that he could cope with meat
      plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten the gravy. Gravy was supplied from the
      sideboard, the plates distributed, and then the vegetable
      dishes went round. Maybe, Florence was too lavish with the
      gravy, and Miss Goodbody indulged in one of her nervous
      wriggles just as Mr. Slade was presenting Mr. Sawkins with
      his plate. The jerk of Miss Goodbody's elbow sent the gravy
      over the tablecloth and also over Mr. Sawkins' sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was stricken with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do apologise, sir. I am most grievously sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins was angrily dabbing his sleeve with his
      serviette. Mrs. Pomeroy was looking knives and pistols at
      James Slade. But Miss Goodbody saved the situation, and Mr.
      Slade never forgot her twittering intervention. Miss
      Goodbody might fuss in the future, but he forgave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It really was my fault. I'm afraid I nudged--his--arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove, who had been observing poor James' stricken
      face, confirmed the diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm afraid you did, Miss G. Pure accident, pure
      accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins was still dabbing irritably at his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much gravy on the plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade spoke soothingly to Mr. Sawkins over Mr. Sawkins'
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will let me have your coat, sir, after dinner, I'll
      have it cleaned for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins was not gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you'd better."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became an expert polisher of boots and silver, and
      ceased to fumble with the plates. He kept the little garden
      tidy, and was becoming a familiar figure to the various
      dwellers in the terrace, and in turn was recognised as a
      familiar figure by them. Mr. Golightly, in frock coat and
      top-hat, would go striding lightly to business at eight
      fifty-five each morning; he was the town's chief mercer,
      haberdasher and provider of millinery. Mr. Grigson passed
      at nine-thirty, like a dignified and animated lamp-post
      wearing a hard felt hat. Dr. Richmond's dog-cart called for
      him punctually at nine. The Rev. Mr. Chatterway would
      wander out at any sort of hour, very much at his leisure,
      and ready to gossip with all and sundry, and to take life
      with a pinch of snuff. He might pause and cock an eye at
      Mr. Slade bent double and snipping at the grass verges with
      a pair of shears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slow business, that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen you in church, haven't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, on Sunday evenings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Charlie Richmond would come scudding along the
      railings, to linger by the hotel doorway, his sailor hat
      like a yellow halo, his legs the colour of a good brown
      egg. His loitering here was an affair of sentiment. He
      might use Mr. Slade as a conversation piece while hoping
      that Rose might come down to play in Caroline Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was James Slade's most painful problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was he to deal with the child when she came and hung
      over the railings and smiled at him? Just smile back? Yes,
      with Clara up above there, ready to pounce. Mr. Slade was
      driven to strange prevarications. He could pretend to be
      deaf, and he did so pretend, tapping an ear with a bent
      forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'm very deaf, my dear. I can't hear what you
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      But how hateful to have to lie to a child!
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he could hear very well in the dining-room when
      someone asked for more bread, or Mrs. Pomeroy gave him an
      order, and the deception was so poor and thin a garment,
      and more afflicting than any hair shirt. It was not
      reasonable of Clara to demand an abstinence that was both
      inhuman and impracticable. He would appeal to Clara. He
      would promise that if she allowed him to speak to the child
      he would never attempt to cultivate even an old man's
      friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, had he not given himself away to Charlie Richmond?
      They had discussed ships and flowers and toy soldiers, and
      Dr. Richmond's new dog-cart over the railings. How was he
      to know that the two children were to argue about his
      deafness, and were to stage an ambuscade that would prove
      his undoing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was on his balcony, and down below Mr. Slade
      was snipping off dead geranium blossoms. Mrs. Pomeroy, too,
      happened to be at her window. Mr. Truslove saw two small
      figures come crouching along under the shelter of the
      clipped euonymus hedge which grew inside the railings.
      Suddenly Charlie Richmond's sailor hat bobbed up above the
      hedgetop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was taken unawares. He turned and smiled upon
      the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Master Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cutting off dead flowers, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding to the spikes of the railings, Charles bobbed up
      and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not deaf. I said you weren't. I've won my penny,
      Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. Slade's consternation, Rose's straw hat and solemn
      face appeared beside the boy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No you haven't yet. You shouted. You are deaf, aren't you,
      Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade frowned, and put a hand to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are deaf, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course. I mean, sometimes I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't deaf," said Charles. "He's just pretending."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, Master Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard me when I asked you what you were doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade shook his head as though puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I saw you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liar," said the boy's eyes, but he was too nice a child to
      blurt out the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You owe me a penny, Charlie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove had been feeling in a trousers pocket. He
      found two pennies and tossed them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, now, never contradict a lady, young man. There's a
      penny for each of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade so far forgot himself as to glance up at the
      balcony and give Mr. Truslove a grateful smile, and Mr.
      Truslove nodded at him. Queer old fish--this! Why the devil
      was he pretending to be deaf when he was no more deaf than
      Adam?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove had travelled, and in so doing had shed much
      of the dreadful complacency of the English, especially of
      the English working-man. Ignorant, awkward brutes many of
      them, too stubborn and stupid to learn, but ready to
      grumble and grudge ability its special favour. Now,
      according to Mr. Truslove's experience, old Slade was not
      plain English. He was too sensitive, too suggestive, too
      much the gentleman, and Mr. Truslove remained upon the
      balcony, meditating upon this peculiar incident. He was
      still there when Mrs. Pomeroy rang her bell, and sent
      Florrie, who answered it, for James Slade. Maybe, Mrs.
      Pomeroy forgot, in a state of irritation, her open window,
      and Mr. Truslove did hear certain strange things that were
      infinitely revealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not help it, Clara--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me that, you fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam. But I do suggest that you are demanding
      something--that isn't human."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't go on pretending like this. I must speak to
      the child, if I only speak to her as your servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a second or two, and then Mrs.
      Pomeroy's voice took up the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Slade, you may speak to her--if she speaks to
      you. As my servant. But, remember--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better not forget. You understand my reasons, I
      presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam, I understand them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence, and Mr. Truslove withdrew from the
      balcony. Funny business, this! But he was not going to
      blurt it abroad. Life had taught Mr. Truslove to keep his
      mouth shut. Moreover, a human problem could be more
      interesting if you reserved the studying and the
      deciphering of it for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, while engaged upon some of his outdoor
      activities, such as tending the gardens, cleaning windows
      or polishing knockers, letter-plates and door-handles, had
      observed the passing of a particular person, nor would it
      have been possible for him not to look at Dr. Richmond's
      wife as devotedly and closely as he dared. That in him,
      which in his narrow world had begun to look through the
      bars at beauty and to give thanks for it, could gaze with
      gladness upon Charlie's mother. Mr. Slade might say to
      himself, "There goes a lovely face and a lovely nature,"
      knowing while he said it that there are beauties of the
      spirit and of the flesh. Mrs. Richmond, the beloved wife of
      the beloved physician, walking into the town to do her
      shopping, was to James Slade something for which man could
      be thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polishing his silver until he could see a vague and
      distorted likeness of himself in a spoon, he could confront
      that other finality. Because of the child how utterly and
      completely Clara had him in her power. There was a cunning
      in Clara that emphasised his own helplessness. He was one
      of those honourable fools, and she knew it. Even his
      failure and his disaster had been due to too sensitive an
      urge to stave off a crisis. How strange that a woman should
      be so vindictive, and determined upon her pound of flesh!
      Well, he would never be able to tell the child. And Clara,
      when she had kept silence about it, must have known how
      utterly she had him under her thumb. Poor lonely old fool!
      Well, when you were feeling so much alone, it was good to
      do things and to do them to the limit of your power. Even
      God might be with you while you consoled your soul by
      cleaning the silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning," said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy rain in the night had dashed some of the flowers, and
      James Slade was rescuing them with bits of stick and loops
      of bass. He had bought these things himself. Startled, he
      came erect, and found himself looking into that serene and
      lovely face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good morning, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid that rain was rather cruel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam, it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor petunias have their faces in the dirt. And lobelia
      doesn't like rain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam. If one gives it a brush with one's hand it
      cheers up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be very fond of flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am, madam. You see, they can't hurt one."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at him with a peculiar and sympathetic
      steadfastness that James Slade found disconcerting. He
      ought not to have blurted out a pitiful thing like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they can be so gay."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they don't chatter, say silly things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled back at her, his fingers twisting at a
      piece of bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not fancy them saying silly things to you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood gazing after her as she passed upon her way. If
      only Clara had been--! And then he remembered those eternal
      and watching windows, and how she seemed to love to catch
      him out, especially so before her guests. "Slade, that fork
      is dirty. Egg. Quite disgusting." So, he bent again to his
      work, and was busy with his bass and his little sticks when
      Mrs. Pomeroy and the child appeared together in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find some real work. I won't have you wasting your time
      like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      How mean of her to make him feel so poor and inferior under
      the eyes of the child! Her passion for humiliating him was
      super-human. He gathered together his bits of stick and
      bass and turned towards the gate, avoiding the eyes of the
      child. He heard Rose say, "Why are you cross with him,
      mother?" Mrs, Pomeroy's bustle waggled contemptuously as
      she walked. "I am not cross with him. One should never be
      cross with one's inferiors."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      At lunch that day Mrs. Richmond asked her husband a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you noticed Mrs. Pomeroy's--porter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond came out of meditative immersion in a case
      that was puzzling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He valets Truslove. A mute old creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs Richmond, "He has the face of a saint. I wonder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are always discovering strange virtues--in strange
      places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I, John? I'm not conscious of--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you make people look saints--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles, home for the summer holidays, and rollicking in
      plum tart and custard, had something to say upon the
      saintliness of James Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tells lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that, my son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He pretends to be deaf, and he isn't. I caught him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure he didn't catch you out, Master Clever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He--couldn't catch--me--out."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother gently snubbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little boys don't know everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said his father. "Since you got that move from
      the Upper First you have been growing a little too cocky."

    <p>
      On Sunday evenings Mr. James Slade attended at St. John's
      Church, and there could survey all the people who mattered
      and all those who did not matter. St. John's Church was a
      rambling old building, pleasantly irregular, and built
      before those dreadful products of the Gothic revival. It
      was individual, just as the new incumbent--Mr.
      Chatterway--was individual. James Slade soon grew to love
      it, the walk along the path between the hollies while the
      bell sang "God, God, God," the slipping into a back pew
      near the door, Mr. Bellinger at the organ, old Robinson's
      white head in the choir. He felt at peace here. He was a
      person, a person kneeling before God.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his corner seat in an obscure pew near the door he
      could observe and study all the hierarchies of Southfleet.
      There were square, oaken pews with doors, newer deal
      benches without them. The elect gathered in the more
      protected pews, the private sittings, the humbler folk in
      the public ones. First came the gentry, such as the Gages,
      the Rawdons, the Hallards. Next in order were the
      professional gentlemen, such as the Richmonds and the
      Grigsons, and those citizens and their families who had
      retired to Southfleet and become privileged residents. Mr.
      Blossom the brewer was included in this group. Trade
      followed after, Mr. Golightly, Mr. Chignell, Mr Murrell,
      Mr. Frost, the principal butcher. Mrs. Pomeroy had been
      admitted to a private pew which could claim attachment to
      the professional group. She was almost a gentlewoman, and
      becoming more so, and a step removed from mere commerce.
      She looked distinguished in her black or purple velvets and
      her handsome bonnets. She sang in a deep contralto,
      confidently and with emphasis. Rose sat beside her, and to
      James Slade the child's hat was like a flower, shining in
      some rather dim garden. He loved the hymns, especially
      "Rock of Ages and "Abide with Me," and sang them in a
      gentle and slightly apologetic tenor. He even liked Mr.
      Chatterway's jerky and conversational sermons, and the
      queer way he threw his arms about and would bend and peer
      impressively at his congregation. Sometimes he would wag an
      admonitory first finger. Mr. Chatterway could be quite an
      original in the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last Amen had sounded, and the congregation
      rustled to its feet, Mr. Slade would stand erect while Mr.
      Bellinger played the congregation out. Mr. Slade, as one of
      its most obscure members, waited respectfully for the
      gentry to pass down the central aisle, and out under the
      gallery with its Royal Arms in red and blue, and white and
      gold. Mrs. Pomeroy would walk down the aisle, head up, eyes
      front, holding her daughter by the hand. She never so much
      as glanced at James Slade, but she knew that he was there.
    </p>
    <h1>
      4
    </h1>
    <p>
      The children of St. John's Sunday School sat in the gallery
      with their teachers, and when the organ had ceased to play
      the children would come clattering down the gallery stairs,
      and out into the evening sunlight. Mr. Slade would walk out
      with a nod to Mr. Munday, the verger, and join the crowd of
      children, who, released from the solemnity of the service,
      became like a flight of chirruping sparrows. Inevitably,
      James Slade was drawn towards children, having become
      something of a child himself. To a man who was labelled
      "Failure" these young things seemed to symbolise a
      beginning over again, spring, eggs in a nest, primroses,
      fairy stories. He understood their mischief and their
      naughtinesses, their little woes, their tears, their
      tantrums. He, too, was beginning over again, and in the
      world of children he felt at ease. He would like to have
      given them toys and sweets, but he had nothing to give but
      smiles, yet his smiles seemed to be sufficient. Often he
      would walk between the glistening holly hedges towards the
      setting sun holding two young things by the hand. He could
      talk child's talk without self-consciousness or
      affectation, and his small friends would look up at him and
      ask him simple questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Slade, what--is--a harlot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This from a small girl, and Mr. Slade, somehow without
      embarrassment, would propound some sort of answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty lady, my dear, who is pleasant to the gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like--like Mrs. Else--or--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, not quite like that. I don't think we have
      any such ladies here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, loving children as he did, as his Lord Jesus loved
      them, it was all the more tantalising to James Slade to
      have to watch the particular child growing up like a tree
      in someone else's garden. He might look over the wall, but
      only surreptitiously so. That which was so humanly his
      could never be his, as he might dream of and desire it. To
      Rose he was just Old Slade, an odd man about the place whom
      her mother scolded, and to whom she herself might in the
      future issue orders. For those were days when James Slade
      seemed to avoid the child, smile at her in a queer and
      poignant way, and slip away round corners. Maybe she
      thought him a funny, silent old man, and perhaps, for that
      very reason, the illusive shadowiness of him attracted her.
      She was still young enough to dash down the kitchen stairs
      to escape from the austere atmosphere of alert
      respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a day when James Slade discovered that the child
      had a temper, and a wilfulness that rebelled against her
      world's "Thou shalt not." James Slade happened to be
      polishing the brass stair-rods, kneeling on the stairs and
      removing the rods one by one when he heard footsteps in the
      passage. Rose came up and past him, brushing by with an air
      of guilty haste. She had something in her hand, a bag of
      sweets. She had been out with Mrs. Else, and a certain
      person was jealous of that lady. How puzzling such
      emotional prejudices must be to a child! James Slade,
      holding a stair-rod in both hands like a Galahad's sword,
      watched her legs disappearing. She was creeping up now,
      step by step, to slip past the maternal door. Mr. Slade had
      seen the bag of sweets, the gift of that other woman of
      whom Rose's mother jealously disapproved. A small hand
      clutching a bag! "That which I hold I keep." It was the
      maternal motto. Like mother--like child?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rose was out of luck. That bag was not to be smuggled
      into the little back room that was hers. Maybe her mother
      had been watching from the window, and had waited, her firm
      fingers on the door handle. It opened upon Rose like the
      door of some jealous Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only in the gardens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not true. How dare you lie to me? What is that you
      are hiding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a resentful silence on the part of Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you got there--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only--a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it to me at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't! How dare you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a scuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweets! I thought so. Haven't I told you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, mother, they're mine. Why shouldn't Mrs Else give
      me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me that bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't. They're mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seemingly there was a struggle for the bag, and in the
      struggle the paper burst, and the confectionery was
      scattered on the carpet. Also, Mr. Slade heard a sound that
      suggested a crisp smack upon soft flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now pick them up, pick them all up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden tears and angry, rebellious sobbings. The child came
      running down the stairs, her mother following. James Slade
      was kneeling there, head bowed, and leaning upon the
      stair-rod as upon a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, stop the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade did not move. He let her go past him, weeping
      bitterly and noisily, down the stairs and to the door. Mrs.
      Pomeroy was in pursuit, and suddenly James Slade held the
      rod crosswise against her, his face stricken but
      determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was open and the child gone, to hide herself
      somewhere in the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you? Get out of my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand swept out. Her impulse was to strike him, but
      suddenly she grew rigid, nostrils pinched, lips thin and
      bloodless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Go up and clear up--that mess, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can collect them in a coal-shovel, and put them on the
      kitchen fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade obeyed her. She stood over him relentlessly
      while he picked up the sweets. She seemed to tower like
      Retribution over the figure of the kneeling sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, go and put them on the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And come back and tell me that you have done it."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      So, the child had a spirit and a temper of her own, but,
      unlike her mother, she could lose her temper passionately
      and with tears. Well, thank God for that! James Slade had
      never known Mrs Pomeroy to weep. Sorry for herself she
      might have been, but with a cold and acid indignation that
      seemed to eat into life without consuming it. The affront
      to her pride and her prejudices had been so dastardly that
      she seemed to be incapable of forgetting or forgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To persecute me seems to be her pleasure," thought the
      cleaner of stair-rods.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having collected those scattered sweets and carried
      them downstairs, he was torn by a swift temptation. He
      wanted to go out into Caroline Gardens and find the child,
      take her on his knees and comfort her. But would not such
      intervention be disastrous, and expose both the child and
      himself to other indignation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in the kitchen with that coal-scoop, and looking
      ashamed of it, he found Eliza, and Floe and May in
      conclave. Florence had overheard the fracas above, and
      darting up the area steps had seen Rose racing for the
      shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweets," said Mr. Slade, looking apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have orders to burn them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza made a clucking noise rather like an indignant hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I--never! Why shouldn't she have a few goodies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweets seem to be forbidden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Mr. Else gave 'em to her, I suppose. Petty, I call
      it. She's going the wrong way about it with that child."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood shame-faced holding the coal-scoop. Surely
      these women must despise him? He--a man--!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me that coal-shovel, Dad," said Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked at her piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to tell--her--I've burned them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go and tell her. She's asking for lies persecuting
      the child like that. I'll keep the sweets for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade surrendered the shovel to Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like telling lies, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I know you don't, Dad, but you can put it down to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish," said Mr. Slade, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish someone could go out and find the child, and
      comfort her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. I'll just shove on a hat and coat. I don't care
      tuppence about her temper. I'm marryin' Joe after
      Christmas, so what do I care?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Florence," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence was as good as her word, nor was her short absence
      from duty noticed by Mrs. Pomeroy. Mr. Slade, reclimbing
      the stairs with the empty coal-scoop and moistening dry
      lips in preparation for that verbal inexactitude, met Mr.
      Truslove on the landing. Mr. Truslove had heard all that
      had passed between mother and child, and poor old Pinch-Me.
      Also, he had seen Rose in flight for the gardens, and Mr.
      Truslove had put on his hat, and was bent for the gardens.
      He gave one glance at poor Slade's suffering face, and at
      the humiliation that seemed to express itself even in the
      droop of the coal-scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, James; lovely day. I've got another pair of trousers
      for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best creaser of trousers, James, I know. Conscientious
      fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did my medicine come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put it in your room, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be getting blind. You would do. Don't know what I
      should do without you, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're always very welcome, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove gave a pat to his hat, and went jauntily down
      the stairs. His voice had been clear and emphatic. That
      damned virago might just as well know that No. 1 regarded
      James Slade as a person of value. A most peculiar and
      provoking situation this! When a woman like Clara Pomeroy
      nursed a grievance it seemed to become like a poisonous
      snake. Mr. Truslove went forth in search of the child. He
      would bring her a pound of sweets, and make the present
      public, and Mrs. P. could swallow her temper, and be damned
      to her. Meanwhile, Mr. Slade knocked at his mistress's
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The coal-scoop, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can bring it in, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James carried it in, and slipped it into place at the back
      of the coal-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you carried out my orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was Mr. Truslove, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was, madam. Just going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to suggest, Slade, that you are apt to be
      too familiar with the visitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, madam, but when a gentleman speaks to me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't argue, Slade. Go and finish cleaning the
      stair-rods."
    </p>

    <p>
      Life may be more simple or more subtle than it seems, its
      complexity taking its texture from the emotional fabric of
      the play; but when the actors are simple souls and happily
      or unhappily unconscious of the sinister motives the
      psychologists might ascribe to them, the simplest
      happenings may possess purpose and significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy had presented separate tables to the elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first floor was promoted to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second floor might be allowed them, provided that the
      occupants were pleasing to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third floor still fed at a communal table placed in the
      most busy and draughty part of the room, and parallel to
      the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove had his table in a corner by the third window,
      away from all draughts, and with an oblique view of the
      gardens and the sea. Miss Popham mealed in the opposite
      corner as far from Mr. Truslove as was possible. Mr. Slade
      had staged this setting with politeness and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have reserved this nice table in the corner, Miss, for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Popham, simple soul, was flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, Slade. How very nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove had winked at James, and expressed his
      appreciation of such diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Jimmy. Peace, perfect peace. A woman's tongue can
      give you indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was not the man he had been, and a medicine
      bottle decorated his table, though there were occasions,
      when he had to be reminded of the presence of that bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you taken your medicine, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, James, what a man you are! Must I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor's orders, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Mr. Truslove's appetite had suffered. He had to
      be coaxed and considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there this morning, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would recommend for you, sir, a lightly boiled egg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn your eggs! Aren't there sausages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, egg, James. You're a regular tyrant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir. I want you to have what's best for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that these separate tables should have emphasised
      James Slade as a person, but it was so. Each table was
      individual, and in treating it as such Mr. Slade became
      more and more the individual, not only to the occupant, but
      to himself. This was personal service, especially so to a
      person like Mr. Truslove, who, once a month, would slip a
      sovereign into Mr. Slade's palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you, sir. It isn't really necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge, James. I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I may say so, sir, it is a pleasure to serve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, James. And sometimes it is a pleasure to be
      served."
    </p>
    <p>
      To James Slade himself the change may have been scarcely
      perceptible. His peculiar sense of humility continued. He
      was one of the world's failures, and with gentle sincerity
      he could chant in church, "O Lord, have mercy upon us,
      miserable sinners." Doubtless had anybody spoken of him in
      his hearing as "That good old man," he would not have taken
      the judgment as personal. James Slade was finding his
      little world a kind and helpful place, just because he was
      what he was, and discovered his own reflection in it
      without recognising the portrait. To Mr. Truslove he was
      Jimmy, to the kitchen Dad, or on more formal occasions Mr.
      Slade. To Mrs. Pomeroy the other members of the staff
      referred to him always as Mr. Slade. This formalism may
      have amazed her without her recognising its esoteric
      significance. Clara was James Slade's cross, and he
      accepted her as such. He saw her as a much wronged woman,
      hard and inexorable, but justified in placing this penance
      upon him. There may be all the difference in the world
      between respect and respectability. James Slade was wearing
      for himself a garment of respect, Mrs. Pomeroy investing
      herself in the robes of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained the child, that human problem, that
      surprising heritage from the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes James Slade would sit upon his bed and wonder.
      What would Rose's future be? Had Clara any plans for the
      blossom time of the rose? Would Rose grow up to be a little
      genteel snob, a thing of corsetted unreality, for, in
      meditating upon Rose, James Slade was more than Simple
      Simon. Some of the cunning of the serpent was his. Here was
      this incipient Eve who promised to possess the fatal gift
      of beauty, growing up in the ice-house of her mother's
      jealous and possessive power. Rose was going to school now,
      attending daily at Miss Hotham's establishment for young
      gentlewomen. Her skirts were lengthening, her pose was more
      sedate; she practised upon the piano. She had ceased from
      scampering downstairs into the kitchen. Eliza might have
      said, "Our young lady's growing airs and graces." Mr. Slade
      cleaned Miss Rose's boots, high boots with buttons, and did
      it lovingly. Sometimes he counted the buttons like a nun
      telling her rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you have a happy year for every one, my sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen asked his advice and treated him as a Father
      Confessor, but not in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza had money in the Post Office Savings Bank. Should she
      leave it there, or place it elsewhere? Mr. Slade, with
      painful memories upon him, advised her to let good money
      sleep where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence was bothered about Joe. He had been a little
      remiss in his wooing, and had missed two of her evenings
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you think I ought to do about it, Dad? Eliza--she
      says--I shouldn't cheapen myself, and that I might even
      walk out with another chap. Tom, the baker's man, has been
      at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Joe given any reasons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, 'e's just funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be other reasons for Joe's funniness, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should he go and--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next time Joe calls for you go out and be sweet to
      him--just as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, but shouldn't I look cheap?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if Joe is worth while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe was worth while. Florrie, having gone out with him,
      came back with a radiant face, and kissed Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were, right, Dad. Poor Joe, 'e was afraid of losing
      'is job, and was shy of tellin' me. You see, we were to be
      married soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you say to Joe, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that I'd stick by 'im, and 'e wasn't to keep 'is
      troubles to 'isself. I'd share 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good girl. Joe's a lucky man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you're an old dear, Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      May had a mother sick in the old town, and was wanting to
      go and do bits of things for her, but Mrs. P. was not
      helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel like walkin' out of the 'ouse, I do. I says to 'er
      I want to be away more than an hour, and she says to me,
      she says, 'I don't pay girls to go trapesing about. Are you
      sure your mother's ill?' 'Call me a liar, ma'am,' says I.
      'You can go and see for yourself,' I says, but I didn't get
      no change out of 'er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'd go, May; and say nothing about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo-er, but what if she--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good girl at your work, May, and I don't suppose
      she wants to lose you. I dare say we can give Eliza a
      little help if she wants it. I'd go and see your mother if
      I were you."
    </p>
    <p>
      May went, and nothing disastrous happened, for Mr. Slade
      spoke to Mr. Truslove about it, and Mr. Truslove brought up
      the subject in public conversation. What a lucky thing it
      was that the girl was so near her mother, and how
      considerate it was of Mrs. Pomeroy to let her off for an
      hour or two. He complimented Mrs. P. upon her kindness,
      and, though Mrs. Pomeroy may have been a little puzzled,
      she did not descend upon the daughter. There are various
      ways of putting awkward and contumacious people in the
      wrong.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Miss Hotham's school walked out each afternoon in
      caterpillar formation, sometimes taking the road along the
      cliffs or passing along Caroline Place to descend the pier
      hill and turn westwards along the parade. Miss Hotham did
      not favour walks in the old town, for rude boys had been
      known to mock or mimic the young ladies, and such
      impertinence could not be tolerated. To begin with, Rose
      had headed the procession with Elsie Dosset from No. 12,
      and assuredly Rose's prettiness should have been a
      provocation to any boy. Mr. Slade would try and create some
      excuse to justify him in poking his head above the area
      railings about the time when the procession might be
      expected to pass. He would be just visible above the
      euonymus hedge, but not aggressively so, and even Miss
      Julia Hotham, with her quick, beady black eyes, did not
      appear to notice Mr. Slade, and Miss Julia missed little
      that could seduce the school's sedateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's the pick of the bunch," was Mr. Slade's verdict, and
      it did not apply to Miss Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the months went by Rose and Elsie ceased to lead the
      promenade. Legs were lengthening, and so were skirts, and
      Rose walked in the second file, the third, the fourth. She
      was growing fast. She promised to be one of those lithe,
      willowy young women with lily necks and graceful movements,
      a figure that floated where others seemed to amble. She
      held her head high, her face slightly tilted like the face
      of a flower. Her hair was amber, and she had dark eyes,
      which was strange. There was wilfulness in that chin,
      veiled mischief in her dark glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pretty creature," thought James Slade. "How I
      wonder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And sometimes the passing of youth's parade would leave him
      very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, nursery days were over, and Rose and her mother
      took their meals together at a table in the corner of the
      dining-room. It was James Slade's pleasure or his pain to
      wait upon mother and daughter, and to be addressed as
      "Slade" by the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, I'd like some more custard." Or, "Slade, I'd like a
      mince pie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in the matter of the girl's healthy appetite the
      mother was possessive and interfering. There would be
      little arguments about sugar and jam and pastry. Rose would
      be ordered to refrain from too much sweet stuff, and warned
      that she would develop spots. Spots indeed! Mr. Slade was
      certain that no girl had ever possessed a more perfect and
      unblemished skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No second helpings, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother, I could eat--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are being greedy. I won't have your complexion
      spoilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was a pure complexion a social asset? Apparently it was.
      And it seemed to James Slade that Mrs. Pomeroy was
      collecting and hoarding social assets. Rose was property,
      and perhaps in her own hard way Clara Pomeroy cherished the
      child as the most precious of her social assets. James
      Slade could observe those proud and domineering glances,
      the critical watchfulness over hair and teeth and costume.
      Rose Pomeroy was more lavishly dressed than any other girl
      in Miss Hotham's school. In winter she had her fur tippet
      and her muff, and a little Polish fur cap with a blue plume
      in it. Vanity of vanities! James Slade both approved and
      disapproved. Was Clara going to spoil the child, turn her
      into a piece of pretty conceit and selfish artifice? And
      yet was Rose, so sweet a child--odalisque fated to bask in
      her mother's paradise of prosperity? She had a spirit of
      her own, a quick colour, flashes of light in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there were clashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already Rose was attracting boyish devotion. Charlie
      Richmond was her admirer, and of that James Slade approved.
      Charles was a wholesome, sturdy yet sensitive lad, the son
      of his mother and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were others.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment young Dosset was the chosen hero, a loud and
      boastful young beast with an aggressive tuft of sandy hair.
      Mr. Slade did not like young Dosset, nor did Rose's mother.
      The Dossets were not up to standard. Mr. Dosset was a
      provision merchant in the city, whose tie was threaded
      through a diamond ring, and whose hat was set at a rather
      vulgar angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular clash was caused by young Fred Dosset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only for a walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. That boy is waiting over by the railings. I
      have told you before, you are not going out with young
      Dosset. Go and take your things off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose flew into one of her tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes I am. Why shouldn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I say no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was putting the silver away in one of the
      drawers of the sideboard. He heard the scuffle on the
      stairs. It descended to the hall. Mrs. Pomeroy was locking
      the front door, and before he realised his position James
      Slade was involved in the fracas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this key, and be ready to unlock the door for
      visitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And go down and lock the area door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And keep the key."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Slade! He heard the passionate protests and tears
      reascend the stairs. Was he the daughter's keeper as well
      as the mother's slave? How cleverly Clara had counted upon
      his helpless co-operation! He finished putting away the
      silver, after going below and locking the area door. Was
      Clara acting with wisdom in this locking of doors? And yet,
      in the matter of young Dosset, he agreed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, half concealed by a curtain, looked out of one
      of the dining-room windows. Master Dosset was still there,
      lounging against the iron railings of Caroline Gardens. A
      crude, bumptious young animal! Mr. Slade stroked his chin,
      and in spite of a gentle spirit he did lust after an
      authority that would justify him in crossing the road and
      giving young Dosset his marching orders. "Now, young man,
      no use hanging about there. Go and take some of the
      stuffing out of that tuft." And no doubt young Dosset would
      have cheeked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, his business was to remain at a window and watch for
      any visitor who might wish to enter, or listen for anyone
      who might wish to go out, and presently he did hear someone
      on the stairs, and that someone was coming down with a
      suggestion of secrecy. Mr. Slade, going out into the hall,
      saw Rose on the last step but one. She was dressed for the
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unlock the door, please, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was, for the moment, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear. I think--your mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--am--going--out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very pale with the young anger of her revolt. Her
      chin was tilted, her eyes bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better not, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, give me the key."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head at her, feeling piteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Miss Rose. I think your mother is right about that
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade blinked like a man who had been hit in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, my dear, but sometimes it is better to be a
      beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a flick of the head, stood quivering and hesitant,
      and suddenly her eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't mean that. You're not a beast. It's Mother
      who--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, my dear. She may be doing what she thinks
      best. You are rather precious--to us all--Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was level with his, and suddenly she closed her
      wet eyes, and seemed to droop to him like a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. Kiss me, Mr. Slade, and say you know I didn't
      mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear. I never want to be a beast to you."
    </p>

      Dr. Richmond came into lunch with the air of a man who had
      something on his mind. He had been to see Mr. Truslove, and
      in plain English he did not like the look of Mr. Truslove,
      not as a man, but as a patient. Mr. Truslove had a hard,
      high tension pulse, and was suffering from attacks of
      breathlessness and faintness, and inexplainable headaches.
      Dr. Richmond did not discuss his patients with his wife,
      but he had another matter on his mind, and it was a problem
      which Mrs. Richmond could share with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Woosnam sent for me to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he is not ill again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. A matter of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond had pulled Mr. Woosnam through an attack of
      acute pneumonia, and Mr. Woosnam went about saying that the
      doctor had rescued him from a cold bed in St. John's
      Churchyard. Mr. Woosnam was the senior partner in the firm
      of Messrs. Woosnam &amp; Wilkins, Auctioneers and Estate
      Agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond helped himself to mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, Woosnam wanted to do me a good turn. An
      adventure in real estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Land, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes. Southfleet seems to be growing like a gourd.
      Land values are trebling, even in the outskirts. The old
      timber-yard is coming on the market."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In High Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what a pity! I should be so sorry to lose that old
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So should I. It's real. It smells of real things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the trees, those fine old chestnuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they'll be doomed. Woosnam told me I could buy the
      site for two thousand pounds, and that in a year or two it
      might be worth twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, for shops?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. But somehow it doesn't pique me. I can't be
      money-minded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad, John," said she; "there is so much more in your
      life than that. The people here think of you in a different
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes they do. What you give them isn't merely for
      money. It may sound silly, but the town would be--hurt--if
      you turned--trader."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond smiled at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very sensitive--about my--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, just proud of it, John. I like to think of you as one
      of the few men who labour for the love of the thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I thanked old Woosnam and said no to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond was right, and her rightness in such matters
      made her the beloved person that she was. Doubtless much of
      the new Southfleet that travelled daily to the city and
      engaged in obscure and sometimes sinister commercial
      scrambles would have thought Dr. Richmond's wife a
      sentimental fool, yet there were simpler folk who would
      have understood her delicate and fastidious feeling about
      such a transaction. The old timber-yard and its trees were
      part of a memory, a pattern that was pleasant and gracious,
      one of those wholesome realities which can be smudged over
      or erased by some improving and mercenary hand. But there
      was more to it than that. She who had suffered love and
      been tortured by it and seen it return to her with
      tenderness and contrition, was jealous of the pride that
      had shared its consummation. Would she see her husband
      among the money-changers? No. His world had come to think
      of him as a man who laboured more for the love of the
      things he did than for the material reward that might
      follow after. If such fastidious and ungreedy souls were
      becoming rare in the new world, so much the worse would the
      world be for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      None the less, Southfleet was indeed the happy
      hunting-ground for the speculator, and legitimately so for
      those who had the foresight and the money to spread and who
      valued property--and what reasonable man does not? Those
      who lack it may decry it, but not one man in a million
      would refuse to accept a nice fat legacy plumped upon his
      plate by some generous testator. Dr. Richmond could dare to
      be fastidious because his professional income was a
      substantial one. Moreover, when the beauty of England is
      considered, those who have preserved it are the Dukes and
      the great gentlemen. The middle-class mind may see beauty
      only in a factory or a row of jerry-built cottages, and an
      uneducated democracy may spill a standardised ugliness over
      the land. The old craftsmen were dead or dying. A hundred
      years might pass before a hygienic and municipal world
      would be re-educated back into the artist's world.
      Perhaps--never.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond expressed his thanks to Mr. Woosnam for the
      private information received, and refused it, and Mr.
      Woosnam looked with coy affection at his physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather thought you would refuse, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just putting temptation in my way, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woosnam allowed himself a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, doctor. Kissing goes by favour, but not with us--of
      course. I know someone else who will--be a probable
      purchaser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't ask who it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you did I couldn't tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you buy the yard yourself, Woosnam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer not to be responsible--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what may happen there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, partly so. Besides, it wouldn't be professional."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have to consider clients?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my business, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond, sitting beside Mr. Truslove's bed later in
      the morning, and knowing that a friendly gossip might be
      more cheering to Mr. Truslove than mere medicine, put the
      case before him in confidence, for Mr. Truslove had some of
      the wisdom of Solomon. Mr. Truslove listened, and, having
      reflected upon the case, confessed that some ten years ago
      he might have done business with Mr. Woosnam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not now, Richmond. I might as well buy myself a gold
      coffin. I suppose one must be growing senile when a bargain
      does not pique one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or--wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the wisdom of your wife. May I get up for an hour or
      two to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No walking up and down stairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'll just sit on the balcony and gape at humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any one to help you dress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jimmy Slade. There's a philosopher for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather a quaint creature--something of a mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little more than that, doctor. A man-child, if you know
      what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless ye become as little children--Great Scott, fancy an
      old buccaneer like me--quoting scripture!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it possible that a buccaneer may have more feeling
      for--human goodness--than a bishop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite likely, Richmond. Unless you have seen life ugly how
      can you value--the other thing that's good?"
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      To Southfleet humourists Mr. Woosnam and Mr. Wilkins were
      known as Box and Cox. Mr. Woosnam suggested a benign and
      silvery ape, Mr. Wilkins a gentlemanly ram. Mr. Woosnam,
      when he wished to dodge a decision, would confess that he
      could not make it without Mr. Wilkins's co-operation, and
      if Mr. Woosnam winked his right eye, Mr. Wilkins knew that
      it behoved him to be non-consenting. Both Mr. Woosnam and
      Mr. Wilkins were as honest as business and their clients
      allowed them to be. You could not always tell the truth
      when some dubious piece of property had to be advertised
      and sold, but in painting the commercial lily both
      gentlemen were artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilkins put his head into Mr. Woosnam's room, and made
      a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's--here. Want to see her or shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woosnam blew his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can. We agreed to let her in; didn't we? Shan't need you
      unless she's difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are. Make her stick to the price."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Pomeroy was shown by a clerk into Mr. Woosnam's
      room, and Mr. Woosnam rose politely, indicated a chair, and
      sat down behind his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to say I have some good news for you, madam. The
      first refusal is now yours--at the price mentioned. But
      only for a limited period."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy laid her bag on Mr. Woosnam's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't shilly-shally, Mr. Woosnam. When--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, madam. Of course, if you are prepared to pay the
      price."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can offer fifteen hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woosnam was benign and bland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the question, madam. That is our client's price,
      and we cannot advise him to reduce it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Freehold, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No restrictions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None--within reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--exactly--do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam, mere formality--in a sense. The Local Board
      and its surveyor might not allow you to erect a
      slaughterhouse on the site. And a public-house might be
      refused a licence. Just--examples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quite irrelevant, Mr. Woosnam. I mean to sit on the
      site, not build."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woosnam smiled at her candour. He could picture her as
      a very large and formidable hen sitting there and hatching
      out the golden eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, madam. A purchase--to resell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the figure suits you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy bent a regal head to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless Mrs. Pomeroy had not heard of Surplus Value, and
      would have scorned the phrase and its implications had they
      been explained to her, for necessity and the humiliations
      that a bankrupt estate can impose upon a gentlewoman had
      emphasised all that was feline in her. She was like a
      mature lioness who had claimed her cave and her
      hunting-ground, and had a cub of her own, and was moved to
      prowl in search of plunder. She was a shrewd and observant
      woman, with very definite ambitions, social and otherwise,
      and, having appraised the significance of Southfleet's
      tendency to spread, she had proposed to exploit it. Three
      per cent. did not thrill Mrs. Pomeroy. If you could treble
      your capital in a year or two, and invest the proceeds in
      fat mortgages and house property, that was good business.
      Already Mrs. Pomeroy had picked up bargains in bricks and
      mortar, and she had the wherewithal for more spacious
      adventure. For years, now, the hotel had prospered and
      enabled her to save a considerable sum yearly. Not for ever
      would Mrs. Pomeroy live as an hotelier. She would return to
      that state of life from which a fool man's bungling had
      expelled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the ultimate fate of the timber-yard was sealed, and
      Mrs. Pomeroy, passing down the High Street, stood for a
      moment under the chestnut trees, and listened to the
      screaming saw, and looked at the stacks of timber and the
      tree boles waiting to be dealt with. Assuredly it would be
      possible to keep the timber-yard as a going concern until
      enterprising gentlemen sought urgently for frontages. With
      local building on the increase and timber in demand, the
      yard itself might be a profitable investment. Then, when
      the value of sites began to soar, she could consider
      selling. It did not occur to her that these splendid trees
      which had given a green refreshment to the old street would
      have to fall. Mrs. Pomeroy was not that sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on, past the Regency Hotel, to Caroline Terrace,
      and there she saw two young people crossing the roadway to
      the gate of Caroline Gardens, Rose and young Hector
      Hallard. Mrs. Pomeroy's authority did not fly towards
      intervention. She smiled and suffered youth to pass, for
      Hallard was not Dosset. Hector was at Harrow, and the
      Hallards country folk who deigned to dwell in No. 19, a
      spacious house with a garden of three acres. A Hallard
      would tone well with Mrs. Pomeroy's colour-scheme, nor were
      the Hallards so prosperous that they could afford to look
      askance at capital. The Hallard income derived from land,
      and with the agricultural depression at its blackest, the
      Hallards were not far from Queer Street. So, Mrs. Pomeroy
      smiled upon some romantic prospect, though romance to her
      spelt prestige and social splendours.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, though becoming more and more a person, did long
      at times to escape from boots and silver and clanging
      bells. How long would his penance last, and for how many
      years would it be his duty to endure it? James Slade still
      used that good old English word, Nelson word, though it was
      becoming out of favour. Duty to whom? A person called God?
      Poof, humbug and an excuse for the bloody caste system!
      Moreover, the emotional penance that had been imposed upon
      him would remain, far more poignant than any material
      bondage; and yet, were he to escape from too close a
      contact with that tender and human provocation, it might be
      easier to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedom!
    </p>
    <p>
      But how could a man be free on twopence? Well, that was an
      exaggeration. Mrs. Pomeroy did pay him ten shillings a week
      and his washing-money. Then there were the tips, though the
      Caroline Hotel was not lavish in this respect. Elderly
      gentlewomen had strange ideas upon largess. Did not Miss
      Popham beckon him occasionally to her table, and say, with
      an impressive and benignant air, "I have something for you,
      Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      The something was a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on his bed and figuring it out, Mr. Slade
      calculated that he could count about forty pounds a year in
      cash. On the debit side were clothes, boots, hair-cuts, his
      Sunday paper, an occasional book, sixpence a week in the
      church plate, Christmas and presents to his fellow workers,
      perhaps a twopenny tramride on the pier, a bag of cherries
      when they were in season. The yearly credit balance might
      amount to fifteen or twenty pounds. In ten years--? He
      might be dead in ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if Mrs. Pomeroy dreamed dreams and very practical
      ones, James Slade did likewise, nor did his dreams lack
      practicability, though on a far humbler scale. Mr. Truslove
      had described him as a child-man, and if Mr. Slade was
      becoming more and more a child with children, his dream
      might be Alice In Wonderland. He, too, wandered up
      Southfleet's High Street, and into the Victoria Road where
      new shops were being opened, but the Victoria Road, bold
      and yellow of brick, did not captivate James Slade. His
      love was the old High Street, with its more mellow sagacity
      and its humour. This was Toy Town as James Slade understood
      it. And what did Southfleet lack? Here were chemists,
      ironmongers, haberdashers, clothiers, butchers, bakers, a
      wine shop, grocers, hairdressers. But where was the
      toy-shop, the children's corner? Mr. Slade made the strange
      discovery that Southfleet possessed no adequate toyshop.
      Mr. Kemp, the stationer, did give part of a window to such
      trifles, but rather condescendingly so. Yes, what the town
      needed was a toy-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade allowed himself a plan of fancy. Now, if he had a
      few hundred pounds behind him he would have opened a
      toy-shop in Southfleet High Street. But where? No premises
      appeared to be available, and Mr. Slade's shop would have
      to be a very small one, just two modest windows and a door.
      Obviously, his dream was ridiculous, but he continued to
      dream it, as a young man dreams of love, or a prisoner of
      liberty. And, since his toy-shop could be nothing but a
      Castle in Spain, Mr. Slade gave himself more and more to
      contact with children.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was permitted to absent himself from duty for half an
      hour in the afternoon, and James Slade would disappear into
      Caroline Gardens. He played touch-wood there with the
      Nelson children, and the Barnets and the Berries, dodging
      round trees in the kind of dell which was the children's
      playground. And sometimes Rose joined them, though she was
      growing too old and too conscious of her young dignity for
      such romps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy surprised Mr. Slade there one day, minus hat
      and coat and dodging about with a bevy of laughing and
      shouting children. His bowler hat and coat lay on a seat.
      Mr. Slade happened to be the toucher, and was chasing
      hither and thither, trying to catch one of the youngsters
      as they scurried from tree to tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood still, suddenly old and unchildlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew along one of the shady paths, and Mr. Slade
      followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At your age--making a fool of yourself like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, madam, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is positively indecent. Ridiculous. Go and put your hat
      and coat on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked at her piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't think children feel like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do--you--know about children? Don't be silly, man. Go
      and put on your hat and coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade obeyed her, but rebellion was stirring in him, as
      in the heart of a child.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      James Slade went to put on his hat and coat and to make
      somewhat shame-faced excuses to the children. "Afraid I
      must go now. Work to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't go, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must do, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hadn't caught anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gathered round him, and suddenly little Lucy
      Barnet clutched Mr. Slade about the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he has, he's caught me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade picked up Lucy and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear. So I have! Now, you go on playing. Oh,
      here's sixpence for some sweets--share and share alike, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo--yes. We won't be greedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade left them, somewhat comforted and reassured in
      spirit. So, he knew nothing about children! Well, well,
      well! But surely Clara need not have humiliated him quite
      so openly. Indecent, ridiculous! How a woman like Clara did
      like to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Caroline Gardens, descending steeply to the sea-front,
      was full of bosky retreats, winding paths and secret seats,
      and on one of these seats recessed in a bower of ivy sat
      another child who was ceasing to be a child. Rose had a
      book on her knees, and it was <i>Lorna Doone.</i> The seat
      overlooked a part of the play-ground, and was just above
      that path upon which Mrs. Pomeroy had reproved a silly old
      man, but the seat was invisible unless you walked directly
      past it, and on a path that diverged from the scene of
      James Slade's scolding. Rose had been able to command a
      part of that leafy playground and to see the figures
      flitting to and fro, in the spaces between the oak boughs,
      the boys in their sailor suits, the girls in gay frocks,
      Mr. Slade in dark trousers, waistcoat and white shirt
      sleeves. His head had grown whiter during the last two
      years. The working world might have spoken of him with
      affection as Old Silver Knob. And to Rose, in the puzzling
      and mysterious days of youth's flowering, James Slade had
      come to possess a peculiar provocation in that he was so
      different from her mother. This old man was never out of
      temper. There were little, kindly wrinkles round his eyes,
      and they were kind eyes, and more than kind. You
      felt--somehow--that you could tell things to Mr. Slade, and
      that he would understand you, and not quote the ten
      commandments. Her mother's tyranny was imposing a dreadful
      muteness upon Rose, and driving inwards into secrecy all
      the spontaneity of her warm, quick temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, in a yellow frock, and looking like a primrose on a
      green bank, called softly to the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Slade--"
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade suddenly stood still, his head cocked like a
      bird's. What syren note was this? Oh, yes, he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Rose! Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and find me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade knew that seat under the hood of rustic-work and
      ivy, but before he ventured near it he walked some way up
      the path which Mrs. Pomeroy had taken. But Mrs. Pomeroy had
      disappeared. Her bombastic, matriarchal bustle did not wink
      at him in the scatter of light and shadow. Mr. Slade walked
      softly back to the ivy bower where Rose sat with her book
      upon her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, my dear. Studying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with peculiar, mute solemnity, and Mr.
      Slade, suddenly realising that he was hot after scurrying
      about the playground, removed his hat and wiped his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, French or History?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her response to the question was a sidelong glide along the
      seat. Mr. Slade was to sit down beside her. He sat down,
      knees together, his hat upon them, his hands folded upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed him the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, <i>Lorna Doone,"</i> said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you read it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact I have. It's a lovely book, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed it and placed it upon the seat, between them.
      There was silence. She was gazing into the green tops of
      the trees, and in her eyes there was a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are--things--like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--like they are in the book, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's fingers knotted themselves together on the
      crown of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--yes--and no, I mean--they can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence, and James Slade felt that great
      word duty buzzing in his silly old brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things are or can be--what you make them, Miss Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me Miss Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I won't--if you don't like it--except, of course, on
      formal occasions."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and he smiled, but her seriousness returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever met anyone like John Ridd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a poser, and Mr. Slade was bothered by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no--not quite like John Ridd--in size--but
      inside--well--perhaps--yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was remembering how the hero of his own youth had
      been Charles Kingsley's Amyas Leigh, that large and
      splendid young man who also had loved a Rose, and had ended
      his days in blindness. Not that Jimmy Slade had had any
      justification for claiming any resemblance to his hero.
      Only once had he fought at school, and disastrously so, to
      be presented with a bloody nose and one black eye. No Amyas
      he! But Rose and her book were different. Rose might find
      the Lorna or the Annie in herself, and in her outward
      comeliness had every right to do so, but it seemed to Mr.
      Slade that her young self was questioning the inward
      validity of the book. Was it sentimental make-believe or
      reality?
    </p>
    <p>
      He groped about for human exemplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good people, you mean, my dear, people who make you feel
      that--life's--good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but not goody-goody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid! Well, there is Mrs. Richmond; she's a lovely
      person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And dear old Robinson in the choir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--the carpenter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Did old Robinson lack romance? Perhaps so. Mr. Slade's
      fingers drummed on the crown of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and Dr. Richmond. Everybody loves him. And our Mr.
      Truslove--so full of integrity. But perhaps you want them
      young? Well, Charlie Richmond is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he is rather conceited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you? But he's got good eyes. Look at a man's eyes, my
      dear, and his mouth. If he's a little shy and silent, so
      much the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles isn't at all shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so? Well, well, he's not like young Dosset.
      But--perhaps--I'm interfering."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you have forgotten someone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she said a thing that made Mr. Slade's hands press
      so hard on his hat that he dented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James, regarding the dent in his hat, inserted a hand and
      restored it to shape, the hard felt going back with a
      crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm nothing, my dear, just an old fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very sweet of you, Miss Rose. Dear me, I ought to
      be going now. Mr. Truslove will want his tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade fled, almost like a blushing boy, full of
      inward confusion and strange exultation. Dear God, did she
      see him among the angels, standing and singing beside Lucy
      Richmond, and dear old Robinson, and not as an obscure and
      rather shabby creature who humbly did those things which
      God had given him to do? Mr. Slade was walking so fast that
      his walk became a trot. Mr. Kemp, the gardener, opening the
      gate for him, remarked upon this haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the hurry, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'm late. Mr. Truslove's tea, you know. He does
      so love his cup of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      When James Slade opened the door of No. 1 he came
      immediately within the field of vision of a sick man's
      eyes. They seemed to have been waiting for him. There was a
      kind of apprehension in them. Mr. Truslove was propped up
      against his pillows, and his very white hands lay flaccid
      upon the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I'm late, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to see you, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's some buttered toast, sir. Think you can manage it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade slid the tray gently on to Mr. Truslove's legs.
      Mr. Truslove was scrutinising James's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look--pleased about something, Jimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been playing with the kids?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You big old child. God bless you, James. You do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I, sir. I don't know why--but I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove patted Mr. Slade's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You old innocent. Don't know what I should do without
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very kind of you to say so, sir. I'm sure it is a
      pleasure to do anything I can. I put on a slice of plum
      cake, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, you--take the cake!"
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Master Charles Richmond, home from school, and rather cocky
      about his cricket and his passage from the Lower to the
      Upper school on the Modern Side, found that he had been
      supplanted, or seemingly so, by young Hallard. Master
      Charles objected to Hallard, and he was objecting to many
      things, including the title of Master. Couldn't a chap drop
      that sort of prefix which suggested that he was still
      wearing socks? And confound young Hallard! As a matter of
      fact, Hector was two years older than Charles, and Harrow,
      whereas Charles was Merchant Taylors, and a boarder in old
      Makin's house. Hector was very much Hector, a man of the
      world at seventeen, dark and dudish and chilly, with a
      sleepy and insolent smile. Charles was not pleased with the
      holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sulked. He exhibited a loutishness that was a little
      puzzling to his parents, and Dr. Richmond, surveying his
      son, supposed that it was sex. An awkward and uncomfortable
      period this, when the new urge could become aggressive, and
      produce those unpleasant phenomena which seem to soil the
      soul of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was troubled. Charles had been such a sensitive
      yet open-faced boy, and here was this rather morose and
      rude stranger who talked too much and too bumptiously, or
      not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with Charlie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband prevaricated. Somehow, it seemed unfair to Lucy
      that she should have to suffer that which can wound some
      mothers and leave others unaware of its existence. The
      spotty stage, the child growing up and away from you, and
      becoming man and tarnished! Nor was the phase much less
      pleasing to Dr. Richmond, even though he could not play the
      pompous prig about it. What was one to do in such a case?
      Provoke the candour of a confessional?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dr. Richmond had become wise in his humanity. It
      happened that Charles was rude to his father, contradicting
      him upon a point of history and, when gently reproved, was
      ruder still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, pater, I ought to know. We have just been doing that
      period. It is a long time since you were at school."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dr. Richmond laughed in a quiet and kindly way that was
      exasperating to youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I have forgotten some things, my son, there are other
      things which you do not remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles looked sulky, and stood on the hearthrug with his
      hands in his trousers pockets. He was feeling rather a
      beast, but an incorrigible beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things, pater?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. They may occur to you when you are a little
      older."
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did Dr. Richmond do? Bicycles were just becoming
      the rage, and Dr. Richmond called at Mr. Giggins's cycle
      shop, which hitherto had specialised in tricycles and
      prams, and bought the latest model, a semi-racing machine.
      It was delivered the same morning, and Charles, returning
      from an unsuccessful attempt to waylay Rose, found the
      machine parked in the hall. What was the meaning of this?
      Was the pater taking to a bike? If so he had selected a
      jolly fine machine. Dear Hector had not anything like it,
      but a boneshaker with solid tyres. Pneumatics, what! And a
      high gear. Charles coveted the machine in all its polished
      newness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father happened to come in while Charles was trying the
      brakes and the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, my lad. How do you like the look of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly fine," said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's yours," and Dr. Richmond passed on to his
      consulting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles stood a moment, with a sudden shock of self-shame
      possessing him. Then he followed his father. Dr. Richmond
      was sitting down at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, pater--do you really mean it's mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles looked flushed. He seemed to fumble for the words
      that he wanted to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's--awfully--decent. I mean-- I'm sorry I was such a
      beast--this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, pater. I didn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. A bit bothered about something, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, get on that bike this afternoon, and ride to
      Chelsford, and see if you can be back by tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden smile came into Charles's eyes. Great Scott,
      wasn't the world right when it believed his father to be a
      wise and inspired physician?
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade was cleaning the silver when a bell rang
      tumultuously in the passage. It had an urgent clamorous
      note, and James hurried out to identify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 1!
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade stood for a moment, wiping his hands on his
      apron. Mr. Truslove's bell. Mr. Truslove, unlike many of
      the other residents, was not an inconsiderate ringer of
      bells. The clapper had ceased striking the metal, but the
      bell-spring was still a'quiver, and it roused in James
      Slade a sudden feeling of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scurried up the stairs. He opened the door of No. 1, and
      was about to speak when he was silenced by the figure in
      the bed. Mr. Truslove was sitting up with a look of anguish
      on his face. His hands were clutching the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes protruded. He seemed to be trying to breathe with
      a chest that had become rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my heart, Jimmy. Such pain--can't breathe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was shocked into a kind of palsy. Mr. Truslove
      had the look of a man who was being throttled by invisible
      hands. His voice had come in a husky thread-like sound. His
      face was drawn with anguish, and all scored with creases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll fetch him at once, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade dashed down the stairs and out into the sunlight,
      his knees going up and down under his green apron. The
      other man's fear, his friend's fear, seemed to be his. He
      was panting when he reached Dr. Richmond's door, and his
      forehead glistened with sweat.

    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about it. Mr. Truslove had had an attack
      of angina, that dreadful spasm of the heart when the victim
      feels like some doomed animal in an anguish of
      apprehension, not daring to move. Dr. Richmond could say to
      his partner, "I haven't liked the look of old Truslove for
      quite a long time," and that was all that could be said
      about it. A box of Amyl Nitrite capsules took its place
      beside Mr. Truslove's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And poor Mr. Slade had come in for a scolding. Hurrying
      back from his quest of the doctor he had run into the arms
      of Mrs. Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the meaning of this, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rushing out in your shirt sleeves and apron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been for the doctor, madam. Mr. Truslove--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with Mr. Truslove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His heart, madam, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was not pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the future, Slade, when anyone is unwell you will
      immediately inform me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No buts, Slade, no buts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Mr. Slade been less upset by his friend's anguish he
      might have been provoked into vulgar and ironic retort.
      Buts, water-butts, wine-butts, the butts of trees, the
      wagging posterior of-- James Slade remember your manners!
      But Clara really was an incredible person, a most
      incredible person, and she became even more so when she
      waylaid Dr. Richmond in the hall. Mr. Slade was lurking and
      listening on the kitchen stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it--serious, Dr. Richmond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid so. Angina. He will have to remain in bed for
      a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, a great nuisance. It should be a hospital case. A
      chronic invalid in an hotel is more than I can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasions were rare when Dr. Richmond showed temper, but
      this was such an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say, Mrs. Pomeroy, that you contemplate
      turning a sick man out of your hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, doctor, it is very inconvenient--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may as well tell you that you cannot do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is more, I won't have my patient worried. It is
      absolutely essential that he should not be distressed or
      worried. After all, he has been here a good many years.
      Your hotel is--in a sense--his home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suggest, doctor, that I am responsible for--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, I--am responsible. If my patient is worried,
      and has a fatal attack, you--will be responsible. Please
      understand that. Surely--a little kindness--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he need a nurse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really can't have a nurse in the hotel. So--depressing
      for my other guests. Besides, nurses always make trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond's voice became cold and emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Pomeroy, I warn you that if any interference should
      prove fatal to my patient, I shall make the matter public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Libel--doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind. But I should be quite prepared to go
      into court on such an issue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is to look after Mr. Truslove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Mr. Slade. He had been seething on
      the stairs. The worm had turned. Really--Clara was
      incredible. If it had been his lot to put on paper a
      character study of Clara, how could he have made her
      credible? Clara was cast-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade appeared suddenly in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Dr. Richmond, did I hear someone ask who would
      look after Mr. Truslove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond bent his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I--can do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy turned on this rampant worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, go back to your work. It is no business of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the worm bit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg to differ, madam. Mr. Truslove is my friend. If you
      please--you will leave him to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy stood like Lot's wife. She stared at Mr.
      Slade, a new Mr. Slade somehow became intractable and
      resolute. He looked her in the face. He appeared ready to
      say, "Be careful, Clara, or I shall--speak." Mrs. Pomeroy
      drew one deep breath and held it. She might be a woman of
      implacable selfishness, but there was a something in James
      Slade's eyes that daunted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well, Slade. If you can find the time--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be easy, madam. Have I your permission, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond smiled at Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you will make an excellent male nurse."
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was very busy. The bell-handle was some two yards
      from Mr. Truslove's bed, and James Slade was attaching a
      stout piece of string to it, and Mr. Truslove, with his
      head laid sideways on the pillow, was watching him. Mr.
      Slade's movements were quiet and deliberate, and his lips
      were puckered up and emitting a ghost of a whistle. Mr.
      Truslove was thinking things about James Slade which Mr.
      Slade had never thought about himself. This elderly man
      gave to the other old man a feeling of security and of
      peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimmy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't--call--me--sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go again. Tell me, did that beldam want to turn
      me out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She? Oh, no," lied Mr. Slade, "she's not quite as-- Well,
      never mind. I think this is going to do the trick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade carried the string along the wall, and fastened
      the end of it to the brass bedpost. Then he gave the string
      a tweak, and watched the bell-handle to satisfy himself
      that it responded with the proper movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That looks all right. Can you reach the string?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can ring any time in the day or night--and I'll
      run up. I'll sleep with my door open."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked happily at his improvisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd better try it and make sure. I'll go downstairs.
      Count ten and then pull the string."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pottered off downstairs, and Mr. Truslove felt for the
      string and held it. He counted ten and then gave a tug. Mr.
      Slade was down in the basement passage watching the bell of
      No. 1. He saw it jerk and heard it peal out merrily. Good
      business! That bit of string had been a brain-wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reascending the stairs when Mrs. Pomeroy came out of
      her room. After the defeat she had suffered some
      reassertion of authority was indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Mr. Truslove's bell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he keep ringing for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't, madam. It's an experiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A--what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An experiment. I have arranged it so that he can ring for
      me without getting out of bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade passed on, and Mrs. Pomeroy re-entered her room
      and stood reflecting. Now--why? Oh, well, wasn't it
      obvious? James Slade was playing the Agag to Mr. Truslove's
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The self-same cynical thought had occurred to Mr. Truslove,
      and been laughed out of court with complete confidence. If
      ever there was a Christlike creature, James Slade was that
      person. Mr. Truslove, watching for the opening of the door,
      saw Mr. Slade's happy face, the face of a man child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It works."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove, propped up on his pillows, regarded his
      friend with sly affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil should you do all this for me, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's face was an open book, and no palimpsest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--well--of course--because I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trotting up and down stairs after a fussy old fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked puzzled, challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't at all like that. You've been very kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge, Jimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you have. You have been a friend, and if one can't
      do things for a friend, there isn't much sense in life, is
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear old innocent," said Mr. Truslove, "anyone would
      think you were out of the Bible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grammar wrong, and that superfluous sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read my Bible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do a little more than that, James. Come and sit with
      me for ten minutes. You do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove, like many men who are lonely and near the
      final crossing, liked to revert to the past and live some
      of its memories over again. He had an album of photographs,
      and, having asked Mr. Slade to bring it to him, he opened
      the book on his knees. Some of the photographs were faded,
      portraits of the Trusloves who were dead. One whole page
      was given to a girl, a slim, dark, innocent-looking
      creature, and Mr. Truslove's fingers lingered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that was Kitty. All sorts of things might have been
      different--if she had lived. I should not have been a sort
      of wandering Jew. Hallo, here is Ceylon. I was there ten
      years, planting. Ever been out East, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kipling was so darned right. Hallo, there is someone at
      the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both old heads were turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See who it is, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went to the door, opened it, and discovered Rose
      with a bunch of white and purple asters in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought Mr. Truslove might like these."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it, James?" asked Mr. Truslove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, I mean--Miss Pomeroy, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious, James, ask her to come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in white, with a red belt, and appearing to both
      old men a slim figure of sudden, exquisite maturity. Mr.
      Truslove closed his album and pointed to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, flowers for me? How very charming."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out a hand for the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit down, my dear. You are as good to look at as
      your posy. Yes, an old man can say that sort of thing, you
      know. James, can you find a vase?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's eyes were upon Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, sir. I'll go and find one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose sat down on a chair beside Mr. Truslove's bed. Here
      was April in its young dignity, serious and a little shy,
      but ready with sudden smiles. Mr. Truslove was thinking,
      "You pretty creature. Am I being sentimental? Well, damn
      it, why not? And how the devil did your mother produce you?
      No chip from that old block!" But Rose was shy, and Mr.
      Truslove had to supply the conversation. He reopened the
      album, and, still holding the flowers, began a playful
      monologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First pages--the Truslove grandfather and grandmother.
      Next pages, Pa and Ma, with John Truslove in curls and
      velvet. That's me. Funny things--old portraits. Turn over
      and see me--in trousers. Enough to make one laugh, isn't
      it? And how I fancied myself in that first tail coat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had taken the album on to her knees. She was sitting
      obliquely to the bed, her head bent, her profile showing
      against the window. Mr. Truslove was observing her, and
      suddenly he made a strange discovery. His secret self
      uttered a soundless shout. "Great Scott, of course. Why
      didn't I see it before? She--and--" At that moment Mr.
      Slade reappeared with a glass vase full of water, and Mr.
      Truslove surrendered the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have them on the table there, James, between me and
      the light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade busied himself with arranging the flowers, and
      Mr. Truslove observed him. James Slade's profile and the
      girl's could be compared, and Mr. Truslove, having
      scrutinised and compared them, repeated that inward
      exclamation, "Great Scott, why didn't I tumble to it
      before?"
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove lay and listened to Southfleet's summer
      sounds, a distant burble from the beach, the merry
      mechanism of a barrel organ, the clop-clop of horses' hoofs
      on the roadway below. Mr. Truslove was in a meditative mood
      and reflecting upon past, present and future. Strange how
      they linked up and merged. When did yesterday become
      to-day, and to-day to-morrow? Time was just part of your
      self, a mental clock inside you. Mr. Truslove had had a
      peaceful night. He might wonder when those heart-pangs
      would return, but to be without them was heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove heard wheels come to rest outside the house.
      That would be Dr. Richmond. Mr. Truslove was ready for Dr.
      Richmond, and proposing to ask him a pertinent question.
      Moreover, Dr. Richmond was a reassuring person; he did not
      come smiling into a room, rubbing his hands, vacuously and
      falsely sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how are we to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove hated that sort of humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he asked his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richmond, don't you think I ought to make a will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you made one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it's a little obsolete. Would you prescribe it?
      Don't be afraid to be candid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. I should make a will--if you are not satisfied
      with the old one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Then I'll have Grigson in. I understand that he is a
      man who can keep his mouth shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was James Slade who carried Mr. Truslove's note to Mr.
      Grigson, and it was James who opened the door to Mr.
      Grigson when he called. Mr. Grigson towered in his lean
      height over Mr. Slade; the kind of hard hat he wore made
      him look even taller. Mr. Grigson had an air of austerity
      that could verge upon grimness, but it was more legal than
      actual, for Mr. Grigson had lost an only son, and his wife
      was an invalid. There was no more kind-hearted man in
      Southfleet, and his integrity was as straight as his long
      lean figure. And Mr. Slade, having seen that head and those
      shoulders bowed in church and somehow expressing
      resignation, was not afraid of Mr. Grigson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Truslove is expecting you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson's face ran into deep creases when he smiled. He
      was one of those who had come to regard Mr. Slade as a
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      James led the way up the stairs, opened Mr. Truslove's door
      and announced the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Grigson, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson disappeared within, and Mr. Slade, closing the
      door, descended to his duties, so that he neither saw nor
      heard that other door open, and Mrs. Pomeroy come softly
      out on to the landing. She approached the door of No. 1,
      and stood there listening. Mr. Grigson and Mr. Truslove
      were indulging in friendly small talk before entering upon
      the more serious matters of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will give me your instructions, Mr. Truslove, I
      will note them, and have a rough draft prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy drew closer to the door. Drat the man, why
      couldn't he speak more loudly and more clearly, for Mr.
      Truslove's voice appeared to be no more than a whisper. How
      very exasperating! Was the old man doing it on purpose? As
      a matter of fact, he was. He had winked at Mr. Grigson and
      said, "I'll soft pedal, if you don't mind, Grigson. This
      house can be rather full of interested curiosity." And then
      Mr. Truslove did a most unsporting thing. He suddenly gave
      a tweak to Mr. Slade's string, and lay smiling, listening
      and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was not that sound suggestive of the sudden swish and
      rustle of hurriedly departing skirts? Again Mr. Truslove
      winked at the lawyer. James Slade, hurrying up the stairs,
      and fearing another heart attack, found the landing empty.
      He opened Mr. Truslove's door, and saw not an anguished
      face, but a smiling, mischievous countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimmy, can you find a pen and ink?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, sir. When I heard your bell--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought I was in trouble, eh. Shouldn't run up stairs,
      James, at your age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not so old as all that, sir. I'll get you a pen and
      ink from the drawing-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade closed the door, and Mr. Truslove smiled at Mr.
      Grigson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sneaking Simon--that. Absolutely without guile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A most likeable fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, much more than that. Did you by any chance
      detect a flouncy sound out yonder when I rang the bell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson put on spectacles and looked judicial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did fancy that I heard something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tempestuous petticoat. I think we have scared it
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, still a little breathless, returned with pen and
      ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like a table, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Mr. Grigson. He had produced a memorandum
      book from a side pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cleaning the silver, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always seem to be cleaning the silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like doing it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, James. Some day you will have to polish a
      halo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy did not venture again upon the landing, and
      Mr. Truslove propounded his instructions in peace. Once
      only did Mr. Grigson's face express surprise, but austerely
      so, and more to himself than to Mr. Truslove. Moreover, it
      was a very simple testament, and not likely to be
      contested, for, as Mr. Truslove said, "There are not many
      of 'em to quarrel over my bones, and none of 'em know I'm a
      sick man, so I'm not pestered with sudden affection." A
      comfortable legacy was to be purchased for Miss Jane
      Truslove, who lived with a dog and three cats in Cornwall.
      There were legacies to a nephew who was something of a
      ruffian but not a cadger, to Dr. Richmond, and to Master
      Charles Richmond. Each member of the staff was to receive
      ten pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, by the way, I have forgotten one particular person.
      Put Miss Pomeroy down for two hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I may say so, Mr. Truslove, you are being very
      generous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After my death, what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that cover the whole of your estate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty well. If there is any residue it can go to the
      Southfleet Cottage Hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can assure you it will be appreciated."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Mr. Truslove liked Mr. Slade to sit with him, but since
      James Slade had many duties to perform, such companionship
      was not easy, for Mrs. Pomeroy appeared to be in a
      particularly suspicious mood, and urgent in exercising
      interference. It was "Slade, do this," and "Slade, do
      that," and Mrs. Pomeroy's bell rang at all sorts of times,
      and James Slade was expected to answer it. Had Mr. Slade
      been less gentle of temper he might have cursed that bell,
      and addressed it in most vulgar language.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Truslove who supplied the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not bring your silver and clean it up here, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She--might object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her object. If I don't get my way I shall throw a fit!
      I'll tell her so, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade brought the silver-basket and his cleaning
      materials up to Mr. Truslove's room, and, spreading a
      newspaper on the floor, posed himself cross-legged on a
      footstool. There were days when Mr. Truslove was allowed to
      get up and dress and sit on the balcony. Mr. Slade could
      not clean the silver on the balcony, so the conversation
      was carried on through the open french window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, you look like Buddha. Ever read any of the Eastern
      philosophy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I read my Bible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friend, that's Eastern, too. I am ashamed to say that
      I have not read the Book for many years. Can you lend me
      yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's selfish of me. I'll buy one. You need yours. Do
      you read it daily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, there goes Mrs. Else. Always reminds me of Rahab. I
      think Rahab must have been rather a good sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," said Mr. Slade, polishing a soup spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove watched Mrs. Else disappear like Eve into the
      garden, and then he asked Mr. Slade a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your particular text, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I don't quite know. I've one of my own, but it's
      very simple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to help, try not to hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove reflected upon those simple words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, good enough for any God, and too good for Jehovah.
      You do believe in God, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's hands became motionless. He looked up at his
      friend sitting there in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any proof, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I feel Him. He's there in the sunlight, and in the
      trees, and out there on the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in you, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't care to claim that, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare do it for you. And in a way you are a proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grammar wrong again. Yes, you. Do you know, James, you
      make me feel there must be something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would make me very happy."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When next he was in the High Street Mr. Slade bought a
      Bible and carried it home to Mr. Truslove. It was the best
      Bible Mr. Slade had been able to buy, bound in black
      morocco, and nicely lettered in gold. Nor was it one of
      those stubborn and contumacious books which refuse to lie
      open without pressure from above, but, wheresoever you
      opened it, the book lay peacefully at your service as it
      should.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it won't be too heavy for you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was handling the book with reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. But you must write in it, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I write?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my name, and an inscription. Say 'From James Slade
      to his friend John Truslove.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove passed the bible back to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can do it over there at my desk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did it over there, blotted the page carefully,
      and carried the book back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's splendid." But Mr. Truslove was interested in more
      than the inscription. Mr. Slade's handwriting was patently
      that of an educated man.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      It did not occur to James Slade that there was any
      strangeness in his not being asked to act as one of the
      witnesses to Mr. Truslove's will. Mr. Slade had no interest
      in this testament, or rather, he just did not think about
      it, for there was unhappiness in the house, an unhappiness
      that did concern Mr. Slade very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tempests and tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was no different from any other matriarch,
      Victorian or otherwise, save perhaps that she liked
      exerting authority for authority's sake, and not for the
      moral good of the child, though where the boundary between
      altruism and egoism lies may be a matter of doubt. Mrs.
      Else was the cause of these clashes. Rose had developed a
      girlish passion for the blonde lady, and Mrs. Pomeroy was
      jealous of her. It is easy to translate jealousy into moral
      disapproval. To Mrs. Pomeroy Mrs. Else was "That woman!"
      She did not tone with Mrs. Pomeroy's social ambitions. She
      was neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring, or
      rather she was herring in the process of decay. Mrs. Else
      used aids to beauty. It was said that she dyed her hair,
      and rouged her face, and, though art was considerably
      successful, it was not the kind of art that Southfleet
      could approve of. Only the Rahabs of the world so
      blasphemed against Nature, though Nature might doom you to
      a red nose and a raddled skin, rusty hair, and
      uncompromising wrinkles. Sustenance of the spirit was
      permitted, but to cream and feed the skin was sinful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in reality, Mrs. Else was a jocund, generous creature.
      She liked young things, and, strange to say, was not
      jealous of them. Having a young heart herself, she
      understood the young. No moral shoe pinched her; her soul
      was without corns, her temper without wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not go out with that woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not--that woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go upstairs at once and take your things off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was sitting with Mr. Truslove. It was a dull and
      cloudy day, and the balcony was not inviting. The two
      voices in conflict came from the landing, and both Mr.
      Truslove and Mr. Slade could hear all that was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just--jealousy. You like saying 'no' and spoiling
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you speak to me like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go upstairs at once to your room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this defiance was a resounding smack. Mr.
      Truslove saw Mr. Slade start to his feet and make a
      movement towards the door. Then, he hesitated and stood
      still. His hands opened and shut, his knees trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't, James, if I were you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade turned about and looked at his friend. There was
      a sound of angry tears. Then, someone rushed hurriedly up
      the stairs. Mr. Slade sat down again, but he continued to
      tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It makes me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. Some women like being--hags. I beg your
      pardon, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, she's shut her door, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. She has gone up after the girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she? To lock her in, I expect. What a superstition,
      that you can lock youth up."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence for a minute. Yes, Mrs. Pomeroy had
      been upstairs. They heard her flouncing down again, and the
      closing of her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means she has the key, James. And I have something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your secret, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat very still. His mouth fell open. His eyes
      looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My--secret--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid so. But need you be afraid of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hid his face in his hands. There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That anybody else knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade uncovered a stricken face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one must ever know. She--must never know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a desperate fool, John. You see, she--I mean
      Clara--was--ambitious and extravagant. I got into a mess. I
      tried to gamble myself out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The disgrace--the shame. And she has never forgiven
      me. She is not that sort of woman. They gave me-- Oh, well,
      never mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old James. So, she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it was my penance. A sort of restitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, old man--crucifixion. Some women can be incredibly
      vindictive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind that. But the child. You see, I didn't know
      till I came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean she never told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a bitch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't say that, John. After all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she had you absolutely, tied up and muzzled. Well,
      well, well, life can be a funny business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave way to emotion, and wanting to be alone with
      it and to recover from it, he stepped out on to the
      balcony. So, his friend had guessed the truth, and was
      still his friend. Mr. Slade stood with his back against the
      wall, and looked at the trees and the sea. Why was Clara
      such a termagant? Why could she not grow old graciously,
      and forget and forgive? Yet, Clara went to church, and
      knelt before her God. But what was her God? Social kudos
      and respectability? What a dreadful mess he had made of
      life! He was a traitor to his own child. He could not
      intervene to help Rose to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's eyes were dim. Could people who were passing
      see his poor, silly, anguished face? He groped for a
      handkerchief and blew his nose. And then, as though he had
      trumpeted outside the walls of Jericho, the grey sky
      cracked, and a finger of light slanted down and touched the
      sea just where a ship was sailing. The canvas turned from
      grey to white like the wings of a celestial bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade held his handkerchief to his mouth and gazed. Had
      God given him a sign from heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade stepped back into the room. His face looked all
      smoothed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, sir, for being such a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove put out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here you dear old idiot. I suppose you think you are
      disgraced for life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was tempted and I fell, John. I did wrong--I did wrong
      to people who trusted me. It was right that I should
      suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not for ever and ever, James. No God who is worth His
      salt asks for that. Sit down and read me something from the
      Great Book. If I had lived as good a life as you have lived
      since I have known you, I should feel sure--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure of what, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I had a claim on--happiness."
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      What was Mrs. Pomeroy's ambition of the moment? That the
      Hallards and the Gages should call upon her, particularly
      the Hallards. But could such a social event be expected to
      happen so long as she was merely the proprietress of a
      private hotel, and poised precariously between the arm
      chair of gentility and the stool of commerce? Yet, she
      could claim to be a gentlewoman, a daughter of the
      professional classes, and all that was needed was that her
      stone should be transferred to a different setting, gold
      not silver. She was accumulating property, and the goodwill
      of her hotel and its equipment would be worth a
      considerable sum. All that might be required was a new
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it would be possible for her to abandon
      Southfleet and retire to a new world, but her motto was
      that of Cæsar's, <i>Veni, vidi, vici.</i> Her interests
      were in Southfleet, and maybe her passion was to conquer
      it, to convince her neighbours that she was very much
      Pomeroy. Had not the originalPomeroys possessed a castle
      and an estate in Devon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, even Mrs. Pomeroy could not ignore the human factors.
      She had made herself responsible for them, and sometimes
      when she reflected upon them she began to question the
      wisdom of her enslavement of poor silly James Slade. Had
      she not been a little hasty in her chastening of the man
      who had failed her? James Slade might become a social
      embarrassment. Either she would have to rid herself of him,
      or keep him so chained and muzzled that he would never
      betray the skeleton in the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then--there was Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy had very definite plans for her daughter. She
      was to be everything that a young lady should be,
      disciplined, demure, tastefully but not loudly dressed,
      correct in her behaviour, especially so in the presence of
      men. Rose was to be both Southfleet's heiress and beauty.
      She could be the most coveted bride in the neighbourhood,
      just sufficiently aloof and cold to pique the male, and
      particularly a Hallard. Mrs. Pomeroy spoke of the Hallards
      with very definite emphasis on the H, almost as though she
      was not sure of her aspirates. Hector Hallard. What a test
      of culture was that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Rose was not proving so docile as her mother wished.
      She had a bright colour and a hot temper. Her intuitive
      response to the maternal decalogue was apt to be
      rebellious. There was too much of "I will" in Rose, and
      Mrs. Pomeroy should have remembered that Rose was her
      daughter. Had she not in her own youth flouted parental
      decretals? There was that woman Else, just the wrong sort
      of person for Rose to associate with, silly and frivolous
      and sentimental, oh yes and more than that. Mrs. Else was a
      honey-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting upon these problems Mrs. Pomeroy received an
      inspiration. It was not a very nice inspiration, but it
      might prove effective. Silly Mr. Slade might be put to
      other uses. Should Rose show herself recalcitrant would it
      not be possible to confront her with her father and his
      past? "My dear, if you do not obey me, I think I can spoil
      any romance for you. There would be no Hallard, no Gage,
      not even a Richmond for you were the world to know that old
      Slade is your father and that he spent seven years in
      gaol." Yes, it was an idea! Mrs. Pomeroy did not appear to
      appreciate the sinister effect of casting such a shadow. As
      Mr. Truslove had said, she was cast-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Else was the first person to be dealt with, and a
      woman has ways of impeaching another woman's charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I don't wish you to think me narrow-minded, but
      you do not know as much of the world as I do. I don't want
      you to be subjected to bad influences. Some people are bad
      for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose tried to defend Mrs. Else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not fair to her, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Rose, I am more interested in being fair to you. I
      don't think you understand what Mrs. Else's reputation is.
      The real people won't know her, and I want you to know the
      real people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Else is an immoral woman. Yes, my dear, don't look
      shocked. You are too young and innocent to understand some
      things. It is my duty to defend you from being associated
      with such a person. A young woman has to be so careful. It
      simply does not do to get a spotty reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure she's not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, I know. Have you ever met her at the Hallards'
      or at Dr. Richmond's? Do you think Mrs. Richmond would
      allow her son to go trapesing about with Mrs. Else? Of
      course not. I am advising you for your own good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such reasoning may seem so final to a parent. Dislike a
      particular person and some solemn slander may appear
      abundantly justified. But Rose was puzzled and troubled.
      Mrs. Else was such fun. She was yea not nay to youth. She
      had such a jolly laugh. She was generous and affectionate.
      She admired Rose and told her so. She was interested in
      Rose's clothes. Whatever her mother might say, Mrs. Else
      was the best-dressed woman in Southfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should one not like what one liked? There seemed to be
      a strange God sneaking about the world, pouncing upon you
      when you were happy, and if you liked chocolates forbidding
      you with dreadful solemnity to consume them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If life and its strange anomalies was tantalising Rose, Mr.
      Slade was equally provoked. If he had served his seven
      years for Rachel could he not in all sobriety love this
      other Rachel when she most needed it? Was not a little
      innocent guile justifiable? If Clara claimed his body in
      servitude, was the spirit to be included? Mr. Slade was
      moved to conspire with himself, and with Mr. Truslove. Mr.
      Truslove made it known that Miss Rose would always be
      welcome as a visitor, and so Rose became one. Meanwhile,
      Mr. Truslove's heart appeared to be more sure of itself,
      and he was able to potter out in Caroline Gardens, and sit
      on one of the terrace seats in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conspiracy between these two old men was fraught with
      understanding. It was understood that Mr. Slade should go
      forth and pilot Mr. Truslove back to the hotel and up the
      stairs to his room. Mr. Slade did so, and often to find
      Rose sitting on the seat with his friend. A high holly
      hedge screened it from the hotel windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove would assume a playful naughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, James, you old tyrant! Come to fetch me in, have you?
      Well, I'm not going in just yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you feel, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to toddle up and down for five minutes. Exercise
      is good for the heart. You sit down and talk to Miss Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat down, and Mr. Truslove pottered off, not to
      return immediately, but to squat on another seat at the far
      end of the terrace. After all, you could not forbid an old
      crock to settle on a shelf when it had rolled a hundred
      yards with a cracked heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      Timidly and with trepidation Mr. Slade played for his
      daughter's confidence. How was <i>Lorna Doone</i>
      progressing? Rose, with a faint frown on her forehead,
      appeared to have passed out of the <i>Lorna Doone</i>
      phase. Life seemed to be baffling all those natural
      impulses; she was being too tightly laced up in the
      conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to be going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hurry, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother will be fussing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade wanted to say, "Let her fuss." What he did say
      was, "Growing up isn't easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, with her chin tilted, considered that statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it isn't. When you want to do a thing someone always
      seems to discover that it is wrong to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always or everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gave him an oblique and questioning glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why must one be treated like a child? I'm not a child any
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, but fathers and mothers seem to feel so
      responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't understand one's growing up. Is that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade blinked at the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. You see--I'm an old fellow. One has to learn to
      make allowances and be patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patient! I hate patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, I know. One grows out of patience, and
      then--perhaps--grows into it again. We can't always do just
      what we want to do, or all at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you do just what you want to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear. And it might not be good for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--do--you want to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave a little apologetic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you must know, I should like to keep a toy-shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A toy shop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that's a lovely idea."

      Winter had come, and the little gardens of Caroline Terrace
      were all tucked up under their brown blankets, and
      Southfleet shivered when the east wind blew. Or a
      south-west gale tearing across the estuary would set
      windows bubbling and smirch the horizon with a wet grey
      gloom. There were wild days when rolled towels had to be
      tucked along window-sills to soak up the rain. The solid
      holly hedges shook and shivered. Chimneys snored. Windows
      and doors rattled, and carpets bulged up from floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bitter weather was not kind to Mr. Truslove, and
      tended to bring on those heart pangs. He felt the cold. A
      fire was kept burning in his room, and Mr. Slade laboured
      up and down with scuttles of coal. It seemed to be nothing
      but coal, coal, coal, and grubbing in a coal-cellar which
      was like a clammy vault. Miss Popham had a fire in her
      room, for she was subject to bronchitis; Mrs. Pomeroy also
      had a fire. In fact, Mr. Slade had six fires to attend to,
      and the blessed things kept him busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he managed to wake at night, and grope his way upstairs
      with a candle, and keep Mr. Truslove's fire going. He made
      as little noise as possible, but Mr. Truslove was a light
      sleeper, and he would wake and discover that kneeling
      figure trying to deposit lumps on the fire with a pair of
      tongs that wobbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, James, stoking the furnace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I was awake and laying doggo, watching you trying to
      handle those damned tongs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I dropped a lump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or they did. You don't drop bricks, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove raised himself in bed and reached for the
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, does it ever occur to you that I am being damned
      selfish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was coaxing another lump of coal on to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you get out of a warm bed at two in the morning
      to cosset an old corpse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that. I hope when the good weather comes you
      will be better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, James, how do you manage to wake up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bought an alarm clock, and I set it for two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to pay for that clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's quite a friend of mine--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you manage to get to sleep again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed by a clear conscience."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was near, and Mr. Slade's overcoat was showing
      signs of wear, nor was it a very warm garment. He put it on
      at night when he ascended from the basement to attend to
      Mr. Truslove's fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your best overcoat, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you go and buy a new one for a Christmas present. A
      good one, mind you; nothing shoddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very kind of you, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge. If ever I was in anybody's debt I'm in yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went shopping. He felt as Charles Dickens felt
      about Christmas. He liked to see the turkeys and sausages
      hanging and the great rounds of beef in the butchers'
      shops. He flattened his nose against the grocers' windows
      to gaze at the coloured candles, the crackers, the oranges,
      the pies and bottles of mincemeat. Mr. Golightly's draper
      shop was gay with sprays of holly and red paper roses set
      in white cotton-wool. But where was the toy-shop, the local
      Lowther Arcade, dedicated solely to the children? It did
      not exist. Miss Mercer's stationery and book-shop did
      display a few toys, dolls and dolls' tea-services, two or
      three boxes of soldiers, but to Mr. Slade's mind the
      display was not adequate. He wandered up the street, and
      paused opposite the old white house with its green
      verandah--The Cedars--and gazed across at the barber's shop
      where monthly he had his hair cut. That particular niche
      would just have suited him. It was a funny little red house
      squeezed in between a greengrocer's and a chemist's. Mr.
      Babcock the barber was a delicate old fellow with a chronic
      cough, who was always talking of retiring from business.
      Some day the place might be to let, but what was the use of
      dreaming of toys and children when your savings in the Post
      Office Savings Bank amounted to thirty-three pounds seven
      shillings and twopence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade purchased his overcoat at Mr. Chignell's. It was
      a nice black coat with a velvet collar. Mr. Slade took it
      home with him and, carrying it upstairs to No. 1, displayed
      it with pride to Mr. Truslove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall feel quite a gentleman, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, my friend--you--are--a gentleman."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      The Caroline Hotel Celebrated Christmas--with moderation.
      Mrs. Pomeroy gave the gardener two shillings for holly
      trimmings from the gardens. Mistletoe did not appear
      above-stairs, but it was in evidence below, hanging from a
      gas bracket, after Mrs. Pomeroy had made her daily round
      and reascended the kitchen stairs. Mr. Slade said nothing
      about the two or three supposed brothers who slipped in
      after dark, and with giggles and mock struggles saluted the
      members of the staff. In fact, Mr. Slade himself subscribed
      to the ancient ritual, beginning with Eliza, and ending
      with Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo-er, Dad, fancy you--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, Christ is born. A happy Christmas to all of
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy and her guests dined on roast beef and
      Christmas pudding; with custard and dessert. Mince pies
      were an alternative, save for the first floor, who could
      demand both pudding and pie. The feast ended with a box of
      cheap crackers, and two bottles of prime port presented by
      Mr. Truslove. Mr. Truslove took his dinner upstairs with a
      half-bottle of port for himself and Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring up two glasses, Jimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not finished yet--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come up later and drink wine with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had put on a black coat and a white tie for the
      occasion. It was a very decorous dinner. Mr. Slade saw to
      it that Rose had two helpings of pudding, plus a mince pie.
      She was in white and looking, Mr. Slade thought, very
      lovely. The crackers and the port produced a sober
      animation. Mr. Slade closed the door upon it, and was about
      to descend to his own dinner when a figure in white slipped
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had a cracker in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pull one with me, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled, and the prize half of the cracker remained
      with Mr. Slade, but he surrendered it to his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, my dear, and may the motto be all that it should
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear that Rose remained in the hall to read her
      motto, for Mr. Slade had reached the first floor landing
      when he heard the opening and the closing of the
      dining-room door, and Mrs. Pomeroy's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you make an exhibition of yourself like that?
      Running out to pull a cracker with a--servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose might have retorted that even servants were human and
      useful. What she actually said was that Mr. Slade was more
      than a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is for me to judge," said her mother. "What have you
      got there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a motto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it to me. Reading nonsense like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will read it to you, if you like, mother. 'Her face is
      sweet, her eyes are blue. For her my love is strong and
      true.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy made a sound of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish! Go in and pull crackers with Miss Popham and Mr.
      Sawkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have a glass of wine, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, softly opening Mr. Truslove's door, crept in and
      closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, James, how is the party going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With authority, sir, with authority. Rose dared to pull a
      cracker with me, and was scolded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young lady does not pull crackers with servants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did--she--say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade nodded, and Mr. Truslove eased himself up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, please take my compliments to Miss Pomeroy, and say
      that I would pull a cracker with her. Also, I have a little
      present ready. A glass of wine--too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That has just been forbidden, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, does the woman think she is God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, greatly daring and warmed by a glass of port,
      went below and delivered Mr. Truslove's message. The hotel
      had put on paper caps. Miss Popham wore a Britannic helmet,
      Mr. Sawkins a crown, Rose a red hood. Mrs. Pomeroy scorned
      such foolishness, even after a glass of Mr. Truslove's
      wine, but Mr. Truslove's invitation was accepted for Rose,
      for, if Mr. Truslove liked the girl so well, he might leave
      her a legacy in his will. Mrs. Pomeroy bent her head in
      acquiescence. She reminded Mr. Slade that his own dinner
      was waiting below-stairs, and that the hotel tables must be
      cleared by three o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, madam. I have to remove Mr. Truslove's tray."
    </p>
    <p>
      There happened to be one cracker left, and Rose carried it
      upstairs, followed by Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was the motto--as it should be, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But mother did not approve of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mothers don't. At least--not always."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove was ready for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, my dear, a happy Christmas and many of 'em. James, a
      glass of wine for Miss Pomeroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then for the cracker. Bless me if I haven't got the
      better half. How ungallant. Take it, my dear. That red hood
      suits you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose unfolded another cap, another hood, but blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try it on. Regular Dolly Varden. There's your wine, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother said I wasn't to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle John says you can. Oh, James, open that
      upper-right-hand drawer, and bring me the small parcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade produced the parcel and carried it to Mr.
      Truslove. Rose was sipping her wine and smiling at Mr.
      Truslove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are, my dear. Open it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parcel contained a morocco leather case, and when Rose
      raised the lid she saw an old paste necklace, the stones a
      soft blue, the setting--silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how lovely! Is it really for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who else? Put it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had trouble with the catch, and Mr. Slade fastened it
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely right for you, my dear. Look in the glass, and
      then come and kiss me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rose gave him the kiss before going to the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One--too--for our friend James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose kissed Mr. Slade, and Mr. Slade, stirred by sudden
      emotion, remembered his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to carve for the kitchen, sir. Will you excuse me?"

      "Good God, James, haven't you dined?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to it. Miss Rose and I will have a chat."

    <p>
      The winter was passing, and crocuses were out in the
      garden. Mr. Slade had purchased the corms and planted them
      himself. It had been a long and a dastardly winter even for
      England, and Mr. Truslove was very weary of it, almost as
      weary as he was of this world. It had been too cold for him
      to go out, and any expedition taken downstairs entailed
      duckings and flutterings of sympathy from Miss Popham and
      Miss Goodbody, or the sulky gloom of old Sawkins. Mr.
      Sawkins had inherited Mr. Truslove's table in the corner
      near the fire. But Mr. Truslove was very tired of frosty or
      streaming windows, and the urgencies of the winter wind,
      and now and again he suffered from those agonising seizures
      when his heart seemed gripped by an iron fist. Those
      blessed capsules relieved the pangs, but always there was
      feeling of bitter apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mr. Truslove to his heart, "Why the devil don't you
      stop if you feel like that? I'm quite ready to go," but Mr.
      Truslove's heart persisted in beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring! Something revived in the tired old man, and when
      Mr. Slade brought him a pot of crocuses that he had been
      cherishing, Mr. Truslove's face lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pretty things! Put 'em where I can see them, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll soon be on the balcony, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to feel the sun on me, old man, and hear the
      birds singing in the gardens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You soon will. Why shouldn't you have a bath-chair? I
      could take you out in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More toil for you, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'd like it. We could go up along the cliffs to the
      flag-staff. It's quite easy and flat there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would Mrs. P. say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it matter? I shouldn't be so busy; no coal to carry
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not a carriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not! I could sit on the box, in case you wanted me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the box?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, do you think I would let my best friend sit on
      the box while I wallowed down below, James."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade made inquiries at Mr. Giggins' Cycle Shop, and
      found that Mr. Giggins had a bath-chair for hire. It was
      fitted with pneumatic tyres, and travelled, as Mr. Giggins
      put it, "Like a bird." Mr. Slade could not conceive how any
      such contraption could be compared to a bird, but he
      trundled the wheeled-chair away to be housed in one of the
      empty coachhouses in Caroline Mews. He appeared in Mr.
      Truslove's room, looking a little flushed and triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bath-chair. Pneumatic tyres, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You old scoundrel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask Dr. Richmond for his permission. I can manage an hour
      each afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond gave his permission, provided that Mr.
      Truslove played no tricks, and took his capsules with him,
      so, on the first warm day, Mr. Slade trundled the chair
      round from the Mews, put a rug and a cushion in it, helped
      Mr. Truslove on with his overcoat and armed him down the
      stairs. They met Miss Popham in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, are you going out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't that obvious?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a bath-chair! How very nice. Can't I help to push it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove looked grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a thing I could not allow a lady to do. It would
      spoil my--sense of chivalry."
    </p>
    <p>
      They escaped from Miss Popham, and Mr. Slade tucked Mr.
      Truslove into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get going, James, or that damned woman--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure she meant it kindly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, James, she wanted to exhibit herself as a sweet angel.
      The devil take such angels. They have driven more men to
      sin than--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut-tut, John, you must not get--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peevish? Well, I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade took the steering handle and pulled. The chair
      ran easily, and Mrs. Richmond, standing on her balcony,
      watched the procession pass, and waved to Mr. Truslove. Mr.
      Truslove raised his hat to her, but Mr. Slade was absorbed
      in playing the patient ass. He guided the chair between the
      posts at the end of the terrace, and, coming to the edge of
      the path, turned the handle for Mr. Truslove to hold while
      he went to the back and eased the chair down into the wide
      roadway between the row of houses and the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently does it, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite comfortable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very. You push, James, I can steer. Gives me something to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the path that wound along the edge of the cliff.
      A soft south-west breeze was blowing, and the broad estuary
      went glittering in the sunlight to the sea. The distant
      Kentish coast was silver-hazed. A barge with red sails was
      beating up towards the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is life, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoying it, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade pushed the chair as far as the flag-staff and its
      white fence. He turned the chair here to face the sea. The
      gorse was in bloom, great banks of it, and Mr. Truslove
      spread his hands to the sun. A little below them and to the
      left a seat was visible, and two young people were sitting
      on it, and so absorbed in each other that they had not
      noticed the arrival of the chair. Rose Pomeroy and Hector
      Hallard!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum! Hope we are not <i>de trop,</i> James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not. I wish--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you wish, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That it was Charlie Richmond, and not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but one can't coerce--youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. No use fussing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was able to watch his daughter in the part of the
      coquette. It was very natural coquetting, and Mr. Slade
      hoped that it was no more than that. He did not like young
      Hallard or the way he sat with his arm along the back of
      the seat and leaning towards Rose. That arm might slip so
      easily round a waist. Conceited, over-confident young
      beggar, with those sleepily insolent eyes of his! The
      Hector Hallards of this world could never be satisfied with
      the love of one woman. They were promiscuous. But, after
      all, most men were like that, though some were more loyal
      in defying the temptation. Young Hallard was in love with
      himself in woman; Charlie Richmond might love the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem pleased with each other, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not the man for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if her mother thinks as you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's hands clenched themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snobbery, John, I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Mr. Slade saw young Hallard's arm slip down from the
      back of the seat with a suggestive movement, and suddenly
      Mr. Slade cleared his throat rather loudly. Rose looked
      round and up and saw them. She blushed, and her eye-lips
      flickered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove raised his hat, and Miss Pomeroy, rising, came
      up the path towards them. Young Hallard, twisting round,
      gave the two old gentlemen an insolent stare. Damn the old
      fools! He, too, got on his feet, but he did not follow
      Rose, but walked off down the path with his hands in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather evidential--that," said Mr. Truslove. "Gentlemen
      don't run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But cads do," thought Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade trundled Mr. Truslove home, wondering whether he
      would be the recipient of an appeal from Rose. "Please
      don't tell Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was so absorbed in his own reflections that he
      very nearly ran Mr. Truslove into the cliff railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out, James!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other preoccupation, what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if Rose appealed to him to keep a secret should he try
      to hint to her that young Hallard was other than he seemed?
      Such interference might prove an indiscretion. Perhaps it
      would be wiser to watch and wait, and trust to Charlie
      Richmond to defeat Lothario, but Mr. Slade received no
      appeal from Rose. She was wise as to her mother's
      predilections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just for a short walk on the cliffs with Hector. He
      thinks he will get his blue up at Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed. And what for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rowing, mother. He was in the college Lent boat, and they
      were head of the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      This might be Double-Dutch to Mrs. Pomeroy, but her secret
      prides and prejudices were flattered. When she took
      Highfield House no doubt the Hallards would call upon her,
      and she was approaching the Highfield elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff took its tea at half-past five, and Mr. Slade
      entered the kitchen not suspecting that the matter which
      was worrying him was to be quickened by kitchen gossip. It
      was May who started it, and May had a sister who served as
      housemaid with the Hallards, and May's sister--Kitty--was a
      comely wench with mischief in her laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone mentioned the Hallard household.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poo," said May. "I know a thing or two about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a challenge to the communal curiosity, and May had
      to produce evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man goes to bed squiffy every other night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was not impressed. "There were days when you weren't
      a gentleman unless you went to bed squiffy--every night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, that's not everythin'," and May tilted her head
      cheekily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to know a lot, my girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, that. Young Hector's 'ot stuff. Tried to get Kitty
      t' go out with 'im after dark on her evenin' out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet she didn't. Kitty's up to snuff. She was goin' out
      with 'er chap. Besides, young Hector's always after one of
      the girls, messin' somebody about. 'E's a trouble-maker, if
      you like! Randy as--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't have such words in my kitchen. Before Mr. Slade,
      too. 'Tain't decent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had been sitting in silence, stirring his tea,
      and looking bothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mrs. Eliza. The young man may be wild--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wild! A girl don't mind a little mischief, but 'e's the
      nasty sneaking sort. Get you into trouble and then say it
      was--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May," said Mrs. Eliza, "I won't have this sort of ignorant
      talk in my kitchen. You've shocked Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ave I, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's eyes were on his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, my dear, I don't like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Dad. All the same if I were Mrs. P I wouldn't
      let--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My girl," said Mrs. Eliza very sharply, "you stop it.
      Nasty, scand'lous insinoo-ations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," said Mr. Slade, "we are all human, but I must
      say I agree with Mrs. Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza preened herself; her bosom swelled, her eyebrows
      bristled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any gentleman would. Have another cup of tea, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Slade was troubled. A girl's mischievous gossiping
      could be evidential, for in a little town like Southfleet
      everything and much more than everything was known. The
      kitchenmaid may have embroidered her story and over-spiced
      her scandal, but the taste of it left Mr. Slade with a sour
      mouth. Young Hallard looked the part. He might have been
      one of Jane Austen's handsome, persuasive blackguards, just
      a Georgian, though much of the Georgian morality has been
      maligned. No, the pose of the Regency buck portrayed itself
      in young Hallard, for the pose had survived the Victorian
      frost in certain of the country families. And, after all,
      it was just insurgent youth, vividly sexed, selfish,
      claiming a primitive prerogative. Such a household as the
      Hallards' might equip a young man with the superficial
      attributes of the gentleman, in dress, in speech, in easy
      manners, while leaving him the essential cad, completely
      without compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, tradition! But what sort of tradition? The
      atmosphere of the first five years when a child absorbed
      those sensitive, spiritual essences, faith in someone, a
      sense of integrity, a feeling that certain things mattered.
      So, to Mr. Slade, a child of the Richmond breed would be
      other than a nicely-painted young savage of a Hallard
      household. Sound timber, sound rigging, a wholesome cargo,
      the mother-god behind the young god at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade knew that he had made a mess of his own
      marriage. He had married a comely wench with a fine head of
      hair and a merciless mouth. He did not want his daughter to
      be lured by biology into making a second mess of marriage.
      Or--worse! Hadn't Clara any sense, or was she just the
      hopeless snob?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade took his troubles to Mr. Truslove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do about it, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove grimaced. His heart was giving trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much, Jimmy. One is so much a spectator at such a
      show. I suppose you would like to stage a fight between the
      hero and the villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the hero licked the villain you might find the
      heroine wiping the villain's nose, and calling the hero a
      beast and a bully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hadn't thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reverse the result, James, and the heroine might think the
      hero a poor thing. A woman's prejudices go with liking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does seem a pity that appearances should be
      so--treacherous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it a question of the senses, especially with the
      young?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did, John. I was a sentimental fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lure of the Golden Fleece, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Truslove was looking distressed. His hand went to
      his heart. His eyes were apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll have a capsule, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was all contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How selfish of me! Worrying you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke a capsule into a clean handkerchief, and passed it
      quickly to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgraceful selfishness. I'm sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove lay back in his chair and breathed in that
      blessed vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for yourself, James. Ah, that's better. After all,
      there is something in science."
    </p>

    <p>
      Charles Richmond was home for the holidays. He was a
      monitor at school, and playing for the 1st Rugby Fifteen.
      The next term would be his last, for Dr. Richmond was
      entering his son at Guy's Hospital. And Charles was out of
      the lout stage and taking life and himself very seriously.
      He had a young dignity of his own, and a pleasant, open,
      freckled face. Silence had descended upon him. He was a lad
      who, when asked a question, became grave and deliberate
      before answering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond and his son passed along Caroline Terrace
      together each morning on the way to the surgery, where
      Charles would watch his father deal with some of the club
      patients. Also, Mr. Byng, his large moustache turning
      white, taught Mr. Charles the elements of dispensing, and
      the mysteries of the Day Book. Dr. Richmond was a believer
      in an early familiarity with the life you were to live.
      Moreover, in loving his work, and being a man upon whom
      other men relied in desperate cases, he felt that he could
      pass to his son some of that actual wisdom and craftsman's
      cunning that are not to be culled from books. Charles had
      made his own choice; he would follow his father, and
      Charles was a lad who did not think his father an obsolete
      old fool, or resent being taught the things his father
      knew. There was affection and understanding between them.
      Dr. Richmond had been no potted saint; he did not preach,
      or talk down to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the work done Charles would take a boat and scull
      furiously up to the Crowstone or out and around the end of
      the pier. He had fine shoulders and a well-set head, a
      passion for fitness and a heart that was in training. Or he
      would get on his bicycle and scorch up hill and down hill
      with the gay determination of youth that will not be passed
      on the road. This bicycling business and this sea-craft
      gave Mr. Slade an idea. Young Hallard, like so many
      sensualists, was a dilettante, a lounger. If Rose took to
      wheels, might she not be lured into liking the man of
      action better than the young elegant who cultivated a nice
      crease in his trousers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade spoke to Mr. Truslove of his inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I give you the money, John, will you make her the
      present? I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, Jimmy, you have forgotten the mother. Does
      social ambition include bloomers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She need not wear bloomers, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you may commit one. Also, she may ride off with the
      villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade fingered his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true. But could you sound Mrs. P.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Tell her, James, I wish to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, receiving the invitation to visit Mr.
      Truslove in his bed-sitting room, immediately suspected the
      preparation of a complaint. Such was her financial position
      and the pride of a confident security that she was rising
      above the need for compromise. Should her clients become
      critical they could be told to go elsewhere, so Mrs.
      Pomeroy entered Mr. Truslove's room in a spirit of non
      possumus. She was prepared to refuse anything to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter ride a bicycle! That was quite impossible.
      Mrs. Pomeroy profoundly disapproved of young gentlewomen
      doing any such thing. She did not say that she thought it
      indecent, but she did believe that it was bad social
      strategy. A young gentlewoman's legs were for walking, not
      pedalling ridiculously along country roads. One had to
      think of a young gentlewoman's dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked Mr. Truslove. Of course, his offer was most
      kindly meant, but she could not agree to it. Her daughter
      was too delicate for such strenuous exercise. Complexion
      might suffer and sex allure be lost by wearing such
      ridiculous clothes. Mrs. Pomeroy believed in the petticoat
      and the veil, and the mystery which is supposed to
      associate itself with the concealment of legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No go, Jimmy. I'm afraid the lady was shocked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have known it," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have another idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't I give a tea-party for the young on my
      balcony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't it tire you, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll risk that. I'll send Master Charles an invitation
      through his father. When that is settled, we can invite
      Miss Pomeroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without her knowing that Charles--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was put into action, but Mr. Truslove's party did
      not prove a success. Charles was the first of the two
      guests to appear on the balcony. Mr. Slade had smuggled him
      upstairs without Mrs. Pomeroy's intervention, and had gone
      below to prepare the Truslove tea. For some reason which
      did not appear young Richmond was in a difficult mood,
      inarticulate and self-conscious. When someone knocked at
      Mr. Truslove's door, and Mr. Truslove sent Mr. Charles to
      welcome the visitor, a silent blight descended upon both
      young things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Rose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems so. Mr. Truslove is on the balcony."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence. Rose crossed the room and.appeared
      before Mr. Truslove, who half rose from his long chair to
      welcome her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to see you, my dear. Sit down there. Tea will be up
      in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose sat down upon her dignity. Young Richmond lingered. He
      was standing--irresolute--upon Mr. Truslove's hearthrug.
      Should he go out to the balcony, or should he bolt? Well,
      one could not do that sort of thing to one of the pater's
      best patients. Besides, Mr. Truslove was a decent old sort.
      Charles, hands in pockets, stepped out on to the balcony
      and, leaning against the railings, appeared interested in
      everything but Rose. And that was how Mr. Slade found them,
      Rose making bright conversation with Mr. Truslove, Charles
      very much the tertium quid, and looking as though he were
      waiting to squash some opposing "Half" behind the scrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring a table out, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles bestirred himself to take the table from Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where will you have it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Charles. That's it. Rose can sit with her back to
      the wall, and you just there."
    </p>
    <p>
      But both young things appeared to have their backs towards
      each other against a most unmelting wall. Rose, who had
      recovered her animation, bestowed the whole of it on Mr.
      Truslove. Had not Mr. Truslove lived in China? Yes, he had.
      How exciting! She--Miss Pomeroy--would love to travel all
      over the world like the ships which passed down the
      estuary. No, she did not want to spend her life in
      Southfleet. The people were so dull, and they never went
      anywhere save to the Dukeries and the Lakes and Devon. Miss
      Pomeroy's face had a pretty flush. The flirts of her head
      and her smiling eyes were all for Mr. Truslove. She ignored
      Charles Richmond, and Charles was stubbornly dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove attempted to bring Charles in to the
      conversation. He tried to talk football. Where was
      Charles's place on the field? A forward. The school fifteen
      was pretty hot stuff, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so-so," said Charles, munching cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Charles seen England play the New Zealanders?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had. Rather a rotten game. Some of the New
      Zealanders had lost their tempers and walked off the field,
      and one had-- Charles remembered himself abruptly and
      smothered a picturesque but coarse incident. He did not
      look at Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pomeroy said brightly that she preferred rowing to
      football.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was churlish enough to ask her where she had ever
      watched any first-class rowing. But she had him. She had
      seen last year's Oxford and Cambridge race. Cambridge had
      rowed beautifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And been licked after leading at Barnes," said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were leading when I saw them. Hector Hallard says
      they would have won only one of the men had influenza."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles's young face grew grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallard rows a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is going to get his Blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hasn't the stuff for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove hurriedly changed the conversation, but though
      he managed to lead it into less controversial quarters, he
      could not make it either spontaneous or gay. Youth was very
      much at cross-purposes. Rose gave her face and her
      attention wholly to her host, and Charles sat stolidly in
      the background. Presently he began to fidget, and, glancing
      surreptitiously at his watch, asked Mr. Truslove to excuse
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some reading to do, sir, and then surgery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mustn't interfere with your work, Charles," said Mr.
      Truslove, feeling both platitudinous and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. Good-bye, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried his broad shoulders and his virile head through
      the french windows with a casual glance at Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if you see Hallard, tell him I'll scull him to the end
      of the pier and back any day he likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid he wouldn't think it worth while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove's face creased itself into a whimsical smile.
      So, this was the result of attempting to stimulate romance!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice lad--that," he said to Miss Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he is much too conceited."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truslove decided to disagree with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, I differ. Too sensitive. When you are not
      conceited enough you may put on airs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pomeroy was politely and unconsentingly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, appearing half a hour later to clear away the
      tea, found Mr. Truslove alone, and lying flaccid, with
      closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No luck, James. Ye gods, but these young things can be
      exhausting."
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>
      It was about two o'clock in the morning when Mr. Slade
      became dimly aware of some insistent sound. Sleep had not
      come to him easily, for he had felt worried about Rose but
      his ultimate slumber had been profound. A dream had
      preceded his waking. Someone had been beating a gong in a
      strange place, half prison, half temple, and from a window
      of coloured glass Charles Richmond's face had grimaced at
      him. Mr. Slade sat up sharply, rubbing his eyes like a
      child. Had he been dreaming, or had some actual sound been
      beating urgently upon his ear-drums? A bell? Mr. Truslove's
      bell? Mr. Slade slipped out of bed, groped for the matches
      and lit his candle. He put on his overcoat, opened the
      door, and glanced at the row of bells. All of them were
      silent and motionless. But had his friend been ringing? Mr.
      Slade was moved to sudden action. He must satisfy himself
      that the sound that had roused him had been no more than
      the illusion of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried up the stairs, carrying his candle. He knocked
      softly at Mr. Truslove's door. There was no answer. Oh,
      well, it must have been nothing but a dream. But Mr. Slade
      was not satisfied. Very gently he turned the handle, opened
      the door, and put his head inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A night-light was burning beside the bed, its little flame
      standing still and steady. Mr. Truslove liked to have a
      light at night. Mr. Slade saw a dim face on the pillow, and
      more than that. The clothes had been pushed down into a
      rumpled disorder, and Mr. Truslove's hands seemed to be
      clutching something white. James Slade was conscious of a
      sudden, poignant fear. He opened the door wide, and crossed
      quietly towards the bed. He looked at his friend's face; it
      was still and blanched, yet retaining a staring, twisted
      anguish. And then he saw another thing. The box of capsules
      had been overturned, and its contents scattered on the
      floor. Mr. Truslove's hands were clutching the useless
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candlestick rocked in James Slade's hand. He knew now
      that the ringing of the bell had been no mere dream. His
      friend, in the anguish of those heart-pangs, had clutched
      at the string. Yes, and the string had broken; Mr. Slade
      saw it hanging down the wall. Then, a fumbling hand,
      groping for those precious capsules, had overturned the
      open box and scattered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Truslove was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade's hand grew steadier, though his face was all
      puckered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, John, I've failed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The profundity of the shock had paralysed him for the
      moment. Then, as he stood gazing, he became aware of a
      gradual transformation spreading over his dead friend's
      face. The lines of anguish melted away; it became peaceful,
      calm, save for the widely open eyes. James Slade watched
      and wondered. Then, bending down, he closed Mr. Truslove's
      eyes, and again stood gazing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, God is with you. Peace, perfect peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting the candlestick on the table, James Slade knelt
      down beside the bed. One of his hands clasped the dead
      man's hands, the other covered his own face. So James Slade
      prayed--"Our Father which art in Heaven--"
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes or more he remained upon his knees. The
      realisation of that which he had lost came to him
      gradually, and seemed to lay upon his shoulders an
      increasing weight of loneliness. His best friend had gone,
      the one man who knew his secret and understood his silence.
      John Truslove had helped to fill a void in James Slade's
      life. He had been able to give to him happy, affectionate
      service. There would be no more jokes between them, no
      chats upon the balcony, no more jaunts in the old
      bath-chair. James Slade was conscious of an acute emptiness
      both of the spirit and the belly. Something had gone from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose slowly from his knees. He smoothed out the rumpled
      bed-clothes, removed the handkerchief from one dead hand,
      and crossed Mr. Truslove's hands. They were growing cold,
      but a profound serenity had settled upon his dead friend's
      face. What now? Ought he to rouse Mrs. Pomeroy, and go out
      and ring Dr. Richmond's night-bell. What would be the use?
      Let them sleep. And suddenly Mr. Slade's feeling of
      emptiness became acutely physical. There was a void in him
      that symbolised his sense of loss and of loneliness. He
      took his candle, closed the door and went downstairs, and,
      exploring the larder, helped himself to bread and cheese,
      and, sitting at the kitchen table, filled his sorrowful
      belly. No more trays would he carry upstairs. No more
      affectionate service. Who was the fool who had said that
      those who served were slaves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not return to his bed. He made his way back
      to his dead friend's room, and sat down to mourn and to
      contemplate. He felt that he was keeping watch over his
      friend, and that somehow he was communicating with him. He
      sat there until the dawn showed in streaks of light along
      the curtain edges. Light! The sun! John Truslove had loved
      the light. Mr. Slade rose and drew back the curtains and
      pulled up the blind. He opened one of the french windows.
      Birds were singing. A peerless spring dawn was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade watched the sunrise. Then he turned about and,
      stealing across the room, blew out Mr. Truslove's
      night-light. So--life could be extinguished, but the sun
      was rising over the sea.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      At half-past seven in the morning James Slade knocked at
      Mrs. Pomeroy's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you awake, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I have some bad news. Mr. Truslove passed away
      in the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was sitting at her dressing-table combing her
      hair. She was proud of her hair, and she had a right to be
      proud of it. She was fond of telling people that she could
      sit on her tresses. The cynics might have said that this
      was no exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Truslove died in the night, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs, Pomeroy tweaked the comb from her hair. How annoying!
      People should not die in hotels. It was depressing for the
      other guests. Also Mr. Truslove had occupied No. 1 for a
      number of years, and had paid his bill regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up, crossed the room, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you discover it, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two in the morning, madam. Mr. Truslove must have
      had one of his heart attacks. I heard his bell, but it was
      too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did not inform me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it unnecessary to disturb you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I should have been informed--at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was looking at his mistress with steady,
      childlike eyes. So Clara was doing her hair just as he
      could remember her doing it in the old days. She had always
      been touchy when combing her hair. A rich soft fleece on a
      hard head. How deceptive things could be. And Clara was
      scolding him as of old when he had been slow in dressing
      and she had wanted the room to herself. She had wanted
      everything to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry, madam, but I wished--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my wishes that matter. Does Dr. Richmond know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Slade, how remiss of you. Have some sense, man. Go
      down at once and leave the news at Dr. Richmond's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade passed down and out into the sunlight. He looked
      at the flowers in the garden. They had dewy faces. He
      glanced up at the green balcony, and realised that he had
      left the blinds up. Well--why not? And how was it that some
      people found fault with everybody and everything? Might it
      be that they had sore souls? Mr. Slade passed on towards
      Dr. Richmond's with a soft westerly breeze blowing in his
      face. His friend was dead, and that Jehovah in petticoats
      had scolded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade found a maid cleaning the doctor's doorstep. She
      was on all fours, her pretty and youthful posterior
      moulding a mauve cotton frock. Her supple waist bent to the
      movements of her body. Her white cap had a jaunty set, and
      she was humming to herself as she swabbed the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the doctor up, Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, being a humble person, seemed to know all and
      sundry by their Christian names. Alice rose on her knees
      and turned to face her questioner, her swab in one hand,
      the other resting on the pail. She had soft brown eyes and
      soft brown hair. Lucy Richmond liked her maids to be of
      that quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's you, Mr. Slade. No, I expect he's having his cold
      bath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade glanced at the speaking-tube above the
      brass-handled bell-pull. The telephone had not yet become
      both a universal curse and a universal blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if I might speak up the tube, Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Truslove is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's soft eyes clouded. She was young, and death was
      nothing to her, and yet it was something on this lovely
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor gentleman. Yes, you might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to step on your clean doorstep, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do. Sweet tempers shouldn't be trodden on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade edged to the side of the door and put his lips to
      the mouthpiece. He blew, and a whistle sounded beside the
      Richmond bed. Mrs. Richmond was at her dressing-table. She
      rose and walked to the dressing-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone at the speaking-tube, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond had stepped out of his round bath and was
      towelling himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you take the message, Lucy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, with his ear to the tube, heard Mrs. Richmond's
      gentle voice descending to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, who is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, madam. I thought the doctor ought to know. Mr.
      Truslove died in the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm so sorry," said the voice; "the doctor shall know
      at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade turned away, and Mrs. Richmond walked to the
      dressing-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Truslove is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was slipping into his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead? Damn! Poor old boy! I thought he would be good for
      another year or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had just finished serving breakfast in the
      dining-room when he saw Dr. Richmond pass a window. The
      hotel dining-room was expressing its sympathy with correct
      and silent gloom, and Mr. Slade turned to the door to go
      and meet the doctor, but Mrs. Pomeroy's voice waylaid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show Dr. Richmond up into my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel door stood open in sunny weather, and Dr.
      Richmond was laying his hat and gloves on the hall table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bad business this, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Especially to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, especially to me, sir. I shall miss him. He was my
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must have had one of his attacks, sir. He upset the
      capsule box, and the bell cord broke. I did hear a bell in
      my dreams. But when I got upstairs--it was too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's voice broke. He was feeling for his
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't forgive myself. If I had heard the
      bell--earlier--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond laid a hand on Mr. Slade's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, you have nothing to regret. You were a great
      comfort to him, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade blew his nose. Dr. Richmond had turned towards
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Pomeroy says, sir, will you go into her room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond made no reply, or rather--his response was
      inward. Damned, interfering female! And reaching the
      landing he turned towards Mr. Truslove's door, opened it,
      went in, and with a jerk of the head invited Mr. Slade to
      follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut the door, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor noticed that the blinds were up, and that the
      morning sunlight was falling full upon the bed. It lit up
      the serene and marble face sleeping its last sleep, and the
      folded hands. Dr. Richmond crossed to the bed, and glanced
      at the broken cord and the scattered capsules. If there had
      been anguish here, all that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks very much at peace, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. No more pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those attacks could be very terrible. He will suffer no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moist sound from Mr. Slade, and Dr. Richmond
      was careful not to look at him. They stood in silence.
      There was a flurry of skirts upon the landing. The door
      opened, and Mrs. Pomeroy sailed in. She looked at the
      sunlit windows; she frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade, pull down those blinds--at once. What can you have
      been thinking of? No respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not move, and it was Dr. Richmond who
      answered the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My patient loved the light, madam. Why deprive him of it
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear doctor, people will think!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them--think. What does it matter?"
    </p>

      Mr. John Truslove was buried in St. John's churchyard in a
      quiet corner not very far from the resting place of a
      notable author who had given distinction to Southfleet by
      dying in the town. Sundry nephews and an aged aunt followed
      the coffin, the young men with hopes of pleasant legacies.
      Mrs. Pomeroy was present with her daughter, also the hotel
      residents, and Dr. and Mrs. Richmond, and Mr. Grigson.
      James Slade, the most genuine mourner of them all, followed
      at the tail of the procession. He was the last person to
      pass round the open grave and look down into it, and to
      drop a little bunch of white rose-buds on to the oak
      coffin. The Rev. John Chatterway was walking away with the
      relatives and offering dry condolences, which, had he known
      it, were utterly superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was not present at the reading of the will. He
      had work to do, and he remained uninterested during the
      interview between Mr. Grigson and the relatives. Mrs.
      Pomeroy had surrendered her own private room for the
      affair, but, happening to pass down the stairs, she
      overheard what appeared to be angry argument. So, the
      nephews, etc., were squabbling over the dead man's
      testament. One particular voice was so strident that she
      heard Mr. Grigson protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember the occasion. My client's
      will is in perfect order, and he was completely sane when
      he gave me his instructions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall contest it," said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up, Arthur," said another voice. "It strikes me that
      Uncle John had a sense of humour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, it's all right for you. But I'm not going to sit
      down and see all that money go to a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson's voice grew more emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I say, young man, that you are showing a most unseemly
      and mercenary temper. The will is in perfect order. I shall
      advise the trustees to administer it--forthwith."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and Mrs. Pomeroy passed on down the
      stairs. So that mischievous old gentleman had been playing
      tricks with his money, and sundry young men had discovered
      that blood is not thicker than water.

    <p>
      Mr. Slade was feeling sad. He had received orders to pack
      up all his dead friend's belongings and to prepare the room
      for another occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins was to inherit No. 1, and if James Slade
      disliked a human being it was Mr. Sawkins. His very name
      expressed the gentleman. Hawkins would have been good
      English--but Sawkins! Mr. Sawkins was bald, with a dirty
      grey beard which looked as though an egg had been broken on
      it. He had bulbous, light blue eyes, a mean little mouth,
      and a cold complacency that was incredible. Mr. Sawkins had
      been something at Somerset House, and had retired on a
      pension. He possessed all the sour arrogance of some petty
      official to whom a little power had been accorded, and who,
      in the productive world, was just nothing. He liked to get
      two or three old ladies together and lecture them on very
      elementary science. He picked his teeth in public. He wore
      knobbly boots which retained a particular and unpleasant
      odour. Mr. Slade knew, for he had to clean those boots. His
      tips were mere minutiæ. And here was Sawkins proposing to
      settle down in that room of many memories, and to display
      his false-teeth like precious ornaments in a tooth-glass on
      the mantelpiece. Those teeth seemed to grin at you as
      though they possessed a smug entity of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was folding up coats and trousers and laying them
      reverently in a trunk when Mr. Sawkins walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not finished yet, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurry up, man. I want to move in to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why this unseemly haste? That death had been in the room
      seemed to cast no shadow therein for Mr. Sawkins. He was
      not sensitive to life's imponderables. The room had two
      french windows, and one of them was shut. Mr. Sawkins
      crossed the room and opened it, sniffed the air, and
      stepped out on to the balcony. Mr. Slade could picture him
      sitting there, picking his teeth and making digestive
      noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins was standing in the window. There were food
      stains on his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have the bed moved over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you will tell the maids," said Mr. Slade, "that is
      their business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can tell them, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't give orders to the staff, Mr. Sawkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins frowned and pursed up his little mean mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will take orders, Slade. Yes, I think so.
      Gentlemen have to be obeyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen! Mr. Slade gave a caress to a pair of trousers.
      Could one feel Christlike to a creature like Sawkins? And
      his fate would be to wait upon Mr. Sawkins, clean his nasty
      boots, carry up his coal, and be admonished by the mean
      little mouth concealed in that egg-stained beard. Mr. Slade
      was puckishly reminded of the saying, "It's a dirty bird
      that fouls its own nest." He sighed. Well, perhaps all this
      was part of his penance? Mr. Sawkins would be his hairy
      shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins stepped down from the window. Mr. Truslove's
      books were still arrayed in the bookcase. Mr. Sawkins
      picked out one at random. It was a Zola.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pah, did the old man read that filth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's head jerked back. His eyes said: "Old man
      yourself, and a nasty one." But his retort was adequate.
      "In French, yes. I don't suppose you understand French, Mr.
      Sawkins. Mr. Truslove was a man of education."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins stared, and then shoved the book back on a
      shelf. Really, this fellow Slade was becoming peculiarly
      impertinent. He would have to be chastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, life bore heavily upon James Slade during the days
      following his friend's death. Mrs. Pomeroy was difficult,
      very difficult. Mr. Sawkins had complained to her of
      Slade's impertinence, and Mr. Slade was scolded. Did he
      think that he could give himself airs and graces just
      because Mr. Truslove had been too friendly with him? Mr.
      Truslove had only wanted someone to fuss over him, and Mr.
      Truslove was dead. Mr. Slade would be well advised to
      remember the position he was in, and reflect that if he
      failed to do his duty politely and with humility he might
      find himself dismissed, and that at his age fresh
      employment would be problematical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade could not resist the lure of sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--the Workhouse, Clara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you address me in that familiar way? Yes, that
      will be your end if you are not careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, going out to have his hair cut, happened to see
      Rose and Hector Hallard passing through the main gate of
      Caroline Gardens. The implication depressed him. Everything
      seemed to be wrong with his world. And in the High Street
      he found a gang of men engaged in murdering the great
      chestnuts of the timber-yard. The trees were mere mutilated
      stumps, and the yard was piled with withering foliage. More
      death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock's saloon was empty, and Mr. Babcock was reading
      the daily paper. He put it away, smiled his funny little
      dry smile, and rose to deal with Mr. Slade's hair. Mr.
      Babcock was in a chatty and a cheerful mood. As he draped
      Mr. Slade with the white sheet he told him jocularly that
      this would be the last occasion on which he would cut his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retiring. Glad of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, and your place is to let?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be in a week or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a going concern?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If anybody wants it. But I'm not bothering about that.
      When I finish--I finish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the good-will is worth something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock was a bit of an oddity. He said that when a
      thing had been yours for thirty years you might not wish to
      see some other fellow in possession. Almost it would be
      like passing your wife on to a stranger. As for the
      good-will, it was not what it had been. The new and more
      pretentious establishment in Victoria Road had been cutting
      into his custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've made my money, Mr. Slade, and I'm calling my tune.
      And I don't want to fob off some young chap with a business
      that is past its prime."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade approved of Mr. Babcock's honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are other things than money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have got a little money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Mr. Babcock, "you can't afford to be proud
      unless you've some cash to carry it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade became more silent and depressed. He passed out
      of Mr. Babcock's shop nicely shorn and oiled, but with a
      sense of frustration tantalising him. If only--? He crossed
      the road, and, standing by the high green gates of "The
      Cedars," looked longingly at that funny little old red
      house with its two small windows. He had dreamed of
      translating it into a toy-shop, but such fancifulness could
      be no other than a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was his world destined to be all boots, coal, Sawkins, and
      Clara?

    <p>
      Mr. Grigson had a very dry sense of humour, old Monopole at
      its best. He liked the bouquet of that particular brand of
      irony. How quickly family feuds developed when the beloved
      testator was dead, and all that remained were the pickings.
      Mr. Grigson had discovered that you never knew your clients
      until some will which concerned them was read. Black ties
      and black gloves shrivelled, and human cupidity popped up
      like a rabbit out of a conjuror's hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see," said Mr. Grigson to himself, "just a week has
      elapsed. He has shown no curiosity. No discreet feelers. He
      suspects nothing. Obviously he had no mercenary motives.
      Well, well, well! Mr. John Truslove did possess one
      disinterested friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson sat down and wrote a letter. It was a very
      brief letter. He rang his bell, and instructed the clerk
      who entered to send the office-boy round with the letter to
      the Caroline Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was cleaning silver when the door bell rang. He
      was not on duty, so there was no need for him to shed his
      apron and hurry into his alpaca coat. He heard Bertha run
      upstairs, and thought no more of it. He was not in a mood
      to think about anything, for there were times when thought
      was a pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha came back down the stairs. She stopped outside Mr.
      Slade's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, never since he had been in Southfleet had Mr. Slade
      received such a thing as a letter. This was a prodigious
      occasion. It rather scared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring it in, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It came by hand, Dad; from Mr. Grigson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Grigson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can he want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha left Mr. Slade with his letter. He slit the envelope
      with the handle of a spoon, drew out the sheet of
      notepaper, unfolded it and read:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Dear Mr. Slade,<br>
      <br>
      I shall be glad if you will call on me at my office at the
      earliest opportunity. I have a certain matter to
      communicate to you.<br>
      <br>
      Yours truly,<br>
      <br>
      Richard Grigson.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade read the letter twice. He was frightened. Had his
      secret been discovered, and was Mr. Grigson concerned in
      giving him advice? Mr. Slade got up and took off his apron.
      Well, if some misfortune threatened him he might as well
      know the worst and get it over. It seemed to him that his
      Sabbath clothes were indicated. He dressed himself in them,
      complete with black tie, brushed his hair, gave his best
      boots a rub, and went out by way of the area steps to
      confront a possible crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson's office had been established for thirty-five
      years on the ground floor of a tall old Regency House in
      the High Street. It had two bow windows, originals, and a
      white pillared porch. The Radicals of Southfleet might ask
      why Mr. Grigson's pillars should be allowed to possess a
      part of the pavement, for even a couple of stone pillars
      are capable of arousing envy, but had Mr. Grigson been
      posed with the equalitarian problem of a new world he might
      have said: "Oh, quite so, let us all sit on the same chair,
      but fools will always be fools, and
      politicians--politicians." He retained in his attitude
      towards humanity a dry and benign watchfulness. Mr.
      Grigson's white front door, with its polished lion-headed
      knocker, stood open to Mr. Slade, and Mr. Slade, having
      rung the bell, waited innocently on the doormat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office-boy answered the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Grigson has asked me to call."
    </p>
    <p>
      The office-boy told Mr. Slade to seat himself on the oak
      chair in the hall, and Mr. Slade did so, nursing his hat on
      his knees. His soul was still the soul of a suppliant. The
      office-boy disappeared. Half a minute passed before a clerk
      came out of the office to deal with Mr. Slade. He was more
      polite than the office-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, Mr. Slade. Please come this way. Mr.
      Grigson will be free in five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was conducted into a little waiting-room. Its
      walls were stacked with law journals and legal text-books,
      a most impressive ante-room to the holy of holies. Mr.
      Slade sat down on a hard chair and, still nursing his hat,
      felt the solemnity of all this legal literature pressing
      upon his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there were familiar friends upon these shelves, and,
      though the atmosphere should have reminded Mr. Slade of the
      distant past, he sat absorbing it like a small boy who was
      waiting to be interviewed by the "Head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson himself came into the waiting-room, and held
      out a hand to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, Mr. Slade. Good of you to call so
      promptly. Come into my private room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put his hand in Mr. Grigson's, and the grip was
      friendly, nor did Mr. Grigson's dry smile suggest that he
      had unpleasant news to communicate. Mr. Grigson opened the
      door of his room, and, taking Mr. Slade by the arm, walked
      him in. Mr. Slade saw the formal desk and the formal chair,
      a big green safe on a wooden stand, rows and rows of black
      deed-boxes with the names of important clients lettered in
      white, more legal literature, the portrait in oils of some
      English worthy, an old map framed in light oak. Mr. Grigson
      pointed Mr. Slade to the clients' chair, and, sitting down
      in his own chair, looked almost quizzically across his desk
      at James Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you an idea, Mr. Slade, of why I have sent for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was still nursing his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None at all, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson put his fingers together, and gazed at some
      document on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I should have told you before, but I postponed the
      matter until I had settled certain--details. The point
      is--you are a beneficiary under Mr. Truslove's will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes. And I think very rightly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never expected anything of the sort, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's fingers were caressing the crown of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Truslove was a good friend to me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think, Mr. Slade, that you were so to him. I happen
      to know that he had a great respect for you. Now, to come
      to the point, Mr. Truslove left you a legacy of two
      thousand pounds, free of duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade just sat and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two thousand pounds, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, two thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Mr. Slade did a most ridiculous thing. He burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grigson's eyebrows went up in momentary surprise. He
      picked up a pen, played with it, put it down again, pushed
      his chair back, crossed his long legs, examined his
      finger-nails. Mr. Slade had found a handkerchief, and was
      drying his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must apologise for being such a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need for an apology. It is, I should say, the sincerest
      tribute--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never expected anything of the kind, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you did not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this--too generous gift. I'm afraid it has rather
      overwhelmed me. I-- Well, it does mean a new--world to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you will think me a peculiar fellow, Mr.
      Grigson. I've had an ambition--but I never thought that it
      could become--possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I know, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you will laugh at me. My dream has been to open
      a toy-shop in Southfleet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Grigson's eyebrows went up, but he did not laugh.
      His face seemed to grow more lean and austere. He was
      thinking of a son who was dead, and whose toys were still
      stored in a nursery cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see nothing to laugh at, Mr. Slade. I think it is an
      admirable idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put his handkerchief away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it will be some time--before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hesitant, apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you need ready money, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, there happens to be the very place I
      coveted--about to be left. If I could--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say we can arrange something. Where, exactly, is
      the shop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Babcock's, sir. He is retiring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely he will dispose of the business as a going
      concern?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not, Mr. Grigson. Mr. Babcock has ideas of his
      own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should go and see him at once. Let me see, I
      expect Woosnam and Wilkins have the letting. You might buy,
      but the value of real estate in the High Street is very
      much on the increase. Better to conserve your capital for
      the new business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go and see Mr. Babcock. If Woosnam's have the
      letting I could give you a letter to them. No, you can
      refer them to me--if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, having thanked Mr. Grigson, went forth upon the
      adventure. He found Mr. Babcock shampooing the head of Mr.
      Berry the butcher. Mr. Slade was shy and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I have a word with you presently?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In ten minutes," said the barber, towelling Mr. Berry's
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune was in Mr. Slade's favour. His brief interview with
      Mr. Babcock was uninterrupted, and Mr. Babcock's attitude
      was whole-heartedly helpful. No, he was not bothering about
      the business. When he finished he finished. There were
      three more years of the lease to run, and Messrs. Woosnam
      and Wilkins were to dispose of it and find a new tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've cut your hair, Mr. Slade, for a good many years. I
      wish you luck. Toys for the kids. Well, that's not a bad
      idea. I've often thought I should like to keep a toy-shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, growing more and more heated in the chase,
      toddled down the High Street to the offices of Messrs.
      Woosnam and Wilkins. After twenty minutes' delay he was
      seen by Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins was sandy and bald and
      cautious, but when Mr. Slade had given Mr. Grigson as his
      reference, Mr. Wilkins saw no reason why Mr. Slade should
      not take over the unexpired moiety of the lease. He would,
      of course, have to refer the matter to his client, but
      since Mr. Slade was to be a man of some substance, he did
      not think the lessor would raise any objections. The rent
      was fifty-five pounds a year. The landlord was responsible
      for external repairs, the tenant--for the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put on his hat, and was unable to resist the
      impulse which carried him back up the High Street for a
      loving look at the shop and house which might be his. He
      knew that Mr. Babcock had a pleasant little garden behind
      the house, and that beyond it lay Mr. Lovell's nursery. Mr.
      Slade coveted a garden, a garden of his very own. He would
      have Mr. Lovell's fruit trees and glass-house on one side,
      the cedars and elms of the old white house on the other.
      Mr. Slade was a'shiver with excitement. What a wonderful
      day, what amazing surprises! And then he remembered Mrs.
      Pomeroy and the hotel. He pulled out his watch. Good
      heavens, it was twenty minutes past five! He had been
      absent from duty for more than two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hurried back, but his haste was without
      trepidation. He had his freedom in his pocket, his dream
      buzzing like a swarm of bees in his head. He descended the
      area steps, and was met by Bertha in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there you are, Dad. She--wants you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She's in one of her tantrums."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear," said Mr. Slade. "I'm afraid I'm in for a
      scolding."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>
      He was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was writing out the weekly bills, and though
      this was an occupation that gave her pleasure, there were
      other activities which pleased her more. She liked scolding
      people; she enjoyed crude sarcasm. Scenes which most
      sensitive people would shrink from and avoid were to her a
      stimulating wind. Like Britannia, she thrived on storms and
      tempests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned in her chair so that Mr. Slade saw her in
      profile, her blonde hair like some portentous head-dress,
      her nose elevated, her chin, jutting out below compressed
      lips. A formidable figure! And yet, for the first time
      since his coming to Southfleet Mr. Slade found himself
      regarding her dispassionately and without fear. He had
      something up his sleeve for Clara, and he was feeling
      naughty about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean, Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, indeed! You have been absent from duty for three
      hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be correct, Clara, about two hours and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      This impudence brought her full front and to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you address me with such familiarity? Where have
      you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Mr. Grigson's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Grigson? What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Private business of my own, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Private business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Grigson sent for me. I have had a great surprise.
      Mr. Truslove remembered me in his will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A small legacy, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two thousand pounds, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise was Mrs. Pomeroy's. Her contempt for this
      quiet little man had become so much a habit with her that
      she was capable of being shocked and astonished when some
      other person contradicted her contempt by selecting him for
      so extraordinary a favour. It was a gross offence to her.
      She was no fool, if her intelligence was rather like a
      sharp knife cutting into cheese. Mr. Slade had provided her
      with a life's grievance. He had disappointed her from the
      very inception of the married state, and even his timid and
      rather ineffectual attempts at intimacy had been those of a
      fumbler. She was a bitter woman, implacably so, a creature
      in whom the divine afflatus blew always from the
      north-east. She had enjoyed this vindictiveness, and the
      power she possessed in imposing a penance upon the man who
      had failed her. And now that meddlesome old fool of a
      Truslove had left him two thousand pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Slade, your servility--did not go unrewarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled. Her face of thunder was no longer that of
      a female Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably, Clara, you will not believe me when I say that I
      did not dream of any such thing happening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not lie to me, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is as I suggested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poof!" said she. "You don't humbug me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid that I should attempt such sacrilege!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irony, indeed! Irony from this futile old fool who yet had
      managed to fool an older fool! Her thin lips curled back
      from her prominent teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally Mr. Truslove did not know--your past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, Clara, he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath. Her hands clenched themselves like
      a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And broke your promise to me! Disgraceful! I take you in
      and give you a home, and you repay me with treachery. You
      always were a rogue, Slade, and a coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that I did was to trust my secret to a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old chatterbox. Of course, he passed it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. I suppose Mr. Grigson knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Clara, he does not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I believe you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you going to do with this precious money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open a toy-shop, Clara, in the High Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      This indeed was the final indignity. A toy-shop! And
      supposing the truth leaked out? Mrs. Pomeroy's face went
      flaccid. She sat down suddenly in a chair. Maybe, she had
      begun to realise that the scourge had changed hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Becoming a--tradesman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, Clara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's--it's nothing but--blackmail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blackmail! Why blackmail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you never think of your child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think of her constantly, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you can do a thing like this, perhaps ruin her
      prospects. It's cruel and wicked."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade stood quite still, regarding her steadfastly.
      How high-minded Clara became when she thought her own
      selfish interests were threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Clara, there is no such danger. She will never
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you be--sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have been here a number of years and she does not
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a fool, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Clara, doesn't it occur to you that my becoming a
      shop-keeper means--that I shall keep my secret? I happen to
      love my daughter. If you were less selfish you would
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--selfish, when I have spent my life--for Rose's future!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, Clara. Try to be honest. Rose has been a kind of
      doll--your doll. You don't love Rose--as Rose. You love
      her--as a piece of property."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy drew a deep breath, held it and then started
      to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you say such a thing! Get out of my house, get
      out at once. Go and lose your silly money, you fool. Never
      again will I try to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Clara. I will go and pack my bag."
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's exodus was so strangely sudden that the
      "Kitchen" could do no more than sit back and gape, and then
      break into indignation. Mr. Slade just walked into the
      kitchen dressed in his Sunday best, and smiling, said, "I
      have come to say good-bye to you all. I have been
      discharged." Tea was still on the table, and Mr. Slade's
      place waiting for him, and Eliza had put the teapot on the
      kitchen grate to keep it warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! You don't mean to say--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's sacked you, after all these years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the situation," said Mr. Slade, still smiling. "I
      am going at once, but not before I have said good-bye to my
      friends. You have all been very kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Eliza would have none of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down, Mr. Slade, and have your tea. You're not
      going without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I ought to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down, Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief, May and Bertha took Mr. Slade by the arms and sat
      him down in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, I knew she was in one of her tempers. I feel like
      walkin' out myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgraceful I call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They gathered round Mr. Slade like affectionate daughters.
      May put a great dollop of butter on his plate, Bertha two
      large spoonfuls of jam. He had three lumps of sugar in his
      tea. Eliza asked him if he would like an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, I'm quite happy," said Mr. Slade, and he looked
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza, the high priestess, sat considering the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where are you going, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked coy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as a matter of fact, to the Regency Hotel for a
      night or two, if they will take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen goggled its eyes at this. The Regency Hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well I never! But that's the spirit, Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stirred his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, my dears, I don't know why I
      shouldn't tell you. I have had a legacy. Mr. Truslove left
      me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good old Trussy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, I say, Dad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always knew Mr. Truslove was a real old sport."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had packed his belongings. The whole staff
      accompanied him up the area steps and, standing in a group,
      waved him good-bye. "Come and see us, Dad." Mr. Slade
      raised his hat. "I think you had better come and see me."
      Mr. Sawkins, picking his teeth and surveying the world from
      Mr. Truslove's balcony, saw Mr. Slade and his bag, and
      remembered he had a grievance against Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins missed the "Sir." He expected to be addressed
      as "Esquire" on his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot my boots this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled up at Mr. Sawkins. He was feeling cheeky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I? Well, you see, I am no longer responsible for your
      boots, Mr. Sawkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Staff giggled, and Mr. Sawkins glared at them. What
      were the lower orders coming to? The girls followed Eliza
      down the area steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, I'm not going to clean his smelly old boots. Didn't
      Dad give 'im one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza reproved them. "Not so much chatter, young
      women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza was feeling both sad and sentimental. She
      reentered her kitchen, and while nobody was looking she
      collected Mr. Slade's cup, and smuggled it under her apron.
      The cup was transferred to the top, left-hand drawer of
      Eliza's chest of drawers, and concealed under a clean cap.
      Eliza had nourished a tenderness for Mr. Slade, but the
      golden wings of Mr. Truslove's legacy appeared to be
      floating him away from and above the caresses of the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not stay at the Regency Hotel. He walked into
      it, took one look at the two somewhat supercilious ladies
      in the office, raised his hat to them and walked out again.
      He passed down Pier Hill into the old town, and, turning
      into that more human tavern, The Ship, asked to be supplied
      with a bedroom. Yes, bed and board. The Ship accepted him.
      He was given a room with a window overlooking The Ship's
      tea-garden and stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Slade had unpacked his things he sat down on the
      bed to marvel at this amazing day. At three o'clock he had
      been cleaning the silver, and now at half-past seven or so
      he was for the moment a man of leisure, the master of two
      thousand pounds, free to come and go as he pleased. A most
      strange feeling came over him. Something in him seemed to
      be waiting for a bell to ring, a bell that would set him in
      motion like a mechanical toy. But there was no bell. There
      would be no more bell, no more boots, no more scuttles of
      coal, no luggage to carry upstairs, no more scoldings.
      Amazing! He was free. He was a guest of The Ship, and other
      people would fetch and carry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears came into Mr. Slade's eyes, and his throat went
      thick. How good and kind most people were! In his
      simplicity he did not suspect that a great part of the
      world was good and kind to him because he was what he was.
      Sour souls stew in their own bitter juices. But Mr. Slade
      knelt down beside his bed, and gave thanks to God and to
      Mr. Truslove--that sardonic and silent friend who, in his
      humanity, had worked this miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade rose from his knees and went to the window. The
      tea-gardens of The Ship was alive with London folk, men,
      women and children. They sat at the round tables covered
      with white American cloth and ate largely and with much
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea with shrimps," said Mr. Slade to himself. "Good
      business. Blessed be every little tummy, and may there be
      no after-pangs."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on his hat and went out. He strolled, he loitered,
      savouring the human scene and loving it. Boats were still
      busy, the sea a'glitter. A barrel organ played, and young
      men and women danced in the roadway. Mr. Slade leaned upon
      the parade railings and smiled upon them, and was ready to
      dance with them, for the feet of his spirit were moving to
      new music. He was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade passed back up Pier Hill, happily harnessed to a
      double purpose. A new fruit and flower shop had been opened
      in the High Street by a gentleman of Hebrew persuasion, Mr.
      Isaacs, and Mr. Isaacs, like the majority of his race, was
      a hard worker and efficient. He believed in exploiting
      those extra hours which the more indolent English eschewed,
      and Mr. Slade found the shop open. Mr. Isaacs was very much
      there in person, fat and swarthy and vital, coat off, hat
      on the back of his head and ridding himself of surplus
      cherries and strawberries to the London folk trailing back
      to the railway station. Mr. Isaacs had large and hairy
      hands, but they were dexterous. He blew into paper bags,
      tumbled fruit into them, clapped them on the scales, and
      twirled the bags between his two hands with a speed that
      was astonishing. Mr. Slade was in search of flowers, not of
      fruit. Had Mr. Isaacs any roses left? He had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Er, mister. In the shop, pleathe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Isaacs was in charge within, swarthy like her father,
      but jocund and comely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want some roses. Yes, those red ones. Can I have a
      dozen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he could. Miss Isaacs selected them for him,
      wrapped the stalks in paper, and smiled upon him with
      brown-eyed beneficence. Mr. Slade paid her and went off
      with his flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His objective was the churchyard of St. John's. In the
      north-east corner and sunning itself under a brick wall,
      Mr. Truslove's grave wore its faded wreaths. Mr. Slade
      removed his hat and, bending down, placed his roses on the
      mound of soil. Then, standing bare-headed, he prayed for
      his dead friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, John, and may God be with you. Shall I forget?
      Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was smiling. He was reflecting that he would be
      here in Southfleet to care for the grave of the man who had
      given him freedom. He would have a cross set up, and a
      simple marble kerb placed about a mat of green turf where
      flowers could lie. John should have his flowers, and at
      Christmas a wreath of holly. Mr. Slade's simple soul found
      happiness in thinking of such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he put on his hat and joined the London crowd in the
      High Street. He idled with it to the green gate of "The
      Cedars," and standing there contemplated the little red
      house and shop across the way. He had more than a feeling
      that it was to be his. The holiday crowd flowed past him,
      and yet another inspiration was revealed to James Slade.
      These Londoners brought their children with them, and,
      though many of them now were tired children, they would be
      fresh and eager in the pride of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course," said James Slade to himself. "Buckets and
      spades--buckets and spades for the sands. And boats. Why,
      of course. Custom passing my very door. In summer I could
      have a sort of hat-stand outside hung all over with buckets
      and spades."

    <p>
      Mr. Babcock moved out, and Mr. Slade moved in, but this
      interchange was something of an improvisation, for Mr.
      Slade, in his innocence, forgot half the necessities that
      his new domestic adventure demanded, and his first night in
      No. 17. The High Street found him attempting to sleep on a
      bed that had a mattress but no pillows. Well, really! Was
      it economy or a precious simplicity that had persuaded him
      to buy a teapot but no kettle, and to forget such articles
      as dishcloths and soap, and to discover that his toilet-set
      lacked one vulgar but very necessary receptacle? Mr. Slade
      scratched his head over the shopping list he had drawn up,
      and was persuaded that it would be better for him to
      consult authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Messrs. Pawley and Beckwith, painters,
      decorators and joiners, were very busy in the front of the
      building, adapting it to its new duties. Messrs. Pawley and
      Beckwith were working craftsmen, and typical of that more
      serene and capable craftsmanship which was honest and
      contented and thorough. Both were men of fresh colour and
      blue of eye; Mr. Pawley was fair, with a little beard, Mr.
      Beckwith brown, with a massive moustache. They had been
      friends from boyhood, and they were friends in
      craftsmanship. Mr. Pawley had a merry tongue, Mr. Beckwith
      was of a more silent gravity. On Sundays he took the senior
      bible-class for boys in the vestry of St. John's Church. He
      knew his bible from Genesis to Revelations, and as a man he
      was a working bible, wise and of a shrewd integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had put his case to those two partners. He had
      said that economy was necessary, and that if Messrs. Pawley
      and Beckwith could combine sound work with economy, it
      would be very helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you worry, Mr. Slade. You leave it to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade left it to them and was satisfied. Messrs. Pawley
      and Beckwith were never round the corner. They did not
      gossip with all and sundry. They did not monkey with the
      paint-pot, or use wood that would crack and warp. Mr.
      Slade, observing the work in process, was like a delighted
      child watching the growth of the nursery of his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd suggest a nice green paint for the counter, Mr.
      Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, green."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't soil so quickly as white. And the shelves--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could we have the shelves white?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White it shall be, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James was camping in the kitchen and one bedroom. The rest
      of the house could be furnished later. Meanwhile there were
      the lapses in that inventory to be amended. Mr. Slade
      needed advice, and Mr. Slade thought of Eliza. There were
      times when it was not good policy to approach the autocrat
      of the kitchen, and James Slade chose both the time and the
      occasion, adventuring down the area steps at the hour when
      the staff would be consuming a cocoa and bread and cheese
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jane who answered the area bell, and Jane who had
      hopes of finding a particular young man there, but instead
      she found Mr. Slade. Disappointed she may have been, yet
      glad in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Dad!--I beg your pardon, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad it is, my dear. May I come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll be glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, the staff of the Caroline Hotel had waited and
      wondered upon some such occasion. Mr. Slade was no longer
      just Slade, but a gentleman of property, a householder and
      a rate-payer. It might be beneath him to descend the area
      steps, but when he did descend them his welcome was
      immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Dad, it's you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a cup of cocoa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went to shake hands solemnly with Mrs. Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind if I do. Glad to be with you all again. You
      see, I've been so busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat down beside the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, my dears, I seem to have got into
      rather a muddle. Forgetting things I ought to remember. I
      thought Mrs. Eliza might advise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling in his pocket he brought out his inventory, and
      laid it on the table beside Mrs. Eliza's plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if you would look through it and tell me what I
      have forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was ready to go into committee upon the subject
      of Mr. Slade's domestic inventory, but Mrs. Eliza assumed
      the prerogative to be hers, and tucked the paper away under
      her plate. She said that she would look through the list,
      and since to-morrow was her afternoon off she would call on
      Mr. Slade, advise him, and if necessary do his shopping for
      him. A man could not be expected to know all that was to be
      known about the anatomy of a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, sipping his cocoa, thanked Mrs. Eliza. To him
      she was no figure of romance, but a solid and kindly
      creature with more sense than sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very good of you, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who's going to do for you, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, look after you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, just at present I'm looking after myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one of the bells rang in the passage, and Mr. Slade
      stiffened in his chair. Almost, the familiar summons
      stimulated him into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's old Sawkins wanting hot water for his whisky."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha rose and went to identify the bell. It was not Mr.
      Sawkins's bell. The summons came from Mrs. Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coo, it's--her bell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I had better be going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shouldn't be here, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet she heard someone come down the area steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the bell pealed, and with more insistence. Bertha
      made a face, and went up to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I ring a bell," said the lady, "I expect it to be
      answered at once. Who is in the kitchen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha was in a pert mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Slade, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade! Impudence! Tell him to leave my house at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy stepped out on to her balcony to listen. She
      heard the area door open and shut, and Mr. Slade's
      footsteps ascending. She addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am surprised at your impertinence. In future--you will
      not visit--my maids. You understand me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, madam. I am sorry that my visit should have
      distressed you!"
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade said to Mr. Pawley, "I want it gay, you know, I
      want it to be gay," and Mr. Pawley twinkled at him, and
      winked at Mr. Beckwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God said 'Let it be gay,' and it was gay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pawley, who was a patriot, would have painted the shop
      front red, white and blue, but Mr. Slade's fancy was more
      subtle. He had christened his shop "The Toy Mart," and at
      either end of the fascia-board a fairy was to float, waving
      a wand. Now fairies always wear white filmy frocks and
      rose-coloured sashes, so Mr. Slade's colour scheme became
      rose and white. Mr. Pawley boggled rather over the fairies;
      fairies were not in his line, but he had a brother who was
      a bit of an artist, and Mr. Pawley Junior mounted a ladder
      and contrived to place the fairies where they should be.
      Then, Mr. Slade had another idea, a hanging sign-board in
      the old-fashioned style, with Father Christmas on it, so
      Mr. Beckwith made the hanging board, and Mr. Pawley Junior
      painted two Father Christmases on it, one with an empty
      sack, the other with a sack that was full, a nice flight of
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beckwith, being a very conscientious craftsman, felt it
      his duty to point out to Mr. Slade that those light colours
      would not stand the weather like a good shade of brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bother the brown," said Mr. Slade. "I want it gay. It
      can always be re-painted, can't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will cost you more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind. You've a good brown conscience, Mr.
      Beckwith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pawley saw the joke, and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob will have a brown halo some day, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, Mr. Pawley, I think it will be good gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about the gaiety of "The Toy Mart," even
      before its windows became alive with colour. Children
      stopped to stare. "Oo-er, look at Father Christmas!" Even
      the elders of Southfleet paused to take notice, for "The
      Toy Mart" was not veritable Southfleet. There was an almost
      goblin gaiety about it, and some of the graver
      disciplinarians did not approve, those who believed in the
      old dictum that children should be seen and not heard. And
      what, after all, were toys? Too many toys spoiled a child.
      Satan might lurk in a sweet-stuff shop, but Mr. Slade was
      blind to such strict morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe he was learning what every man who dares some
      adventure, however obscure, or follows some creative urge,
      learns; that the people who blame and those who spend their
      lives in minding other people's businesses for them are
      second-raters. No first-rater could be content with passing
      his life in poking his administrative fingers into the
      affairs of those who do. Mr. Slade, having suffered some
      years of social discipline in its most unenlightened form,
      wanted to escape from school like a child, and be with
      children. He was a blessed rebel against the eternal
      "Don't." Come on, lads and lasses, let's play Hunt The
      Slipper. Yes, let's--. Mischief, my dears, a little happy
      mischief. Then the Second-Raters would arrive with solemn,
      frowning foreheads, and note-books and pencils. "Hum, 'Hunt
      The Slipper'! Was it quite--moral? No, certainly not, when
      indulged in--beyond a certain age." Out would come the
      nice, official forms. "State your name, in block capitals.
      Age, profession. State why you wish to play the game, where
      and when." Then, having duly conferred together, the
      official "Don'ts" would decide that the game was unsuitable
      for adults, and that no child above the age of fourteen
      should be permitted to play it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade might learn to laugh at such people, and plain
      men would have understood him. Mr. Pawley would have
      understood him perfectly, Mr. Beckwith a little less so.
      Were there any children in Somerset House? God forbid! Why
      ask so irrelevant a question? But the trouble is that your
      Second-Raters can be so stupidly and solemnly persistent,
      bearing upon their banners that most characteristic
      device--"Commit No Nuisance."
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      There was one person in Southfleet who was stimulated into
      further activity by this display of playfulness on the part
      of Mr. Slade. Mrs. Pomeroy, having business with her
      bankers, and passing Mr. Slade's new shop, paused to
      consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Toy Mart."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the name upon the fascia board, "James Slade," and
      the stark evidence of the wretched man's lapse into trade
      moved her to anger. What if the secret should emerge? Yes,
      she had been a fool to allow her vindictive charity to
      exercise itself on James Slade's behalf. Had she been wiser
      she would have pensioned him off in some London suburb, but
      in that case she would not have been able to enjoy a
      righteous revenge. Revenge is not always sweet. It may turn
      sour on you, and Mrs. Pomeroy was moved to hurry the
      fruition of her social scheming. With such a skeleton in
      her cupboard it behoved her to capture and consolidate the
      position she coveted before any mischance, wilful or
      otherwise, might drag the bag of bones into the light of
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, having concluded her business at the bank,
      took a walk westwards along the cliff. A furlong or so
      beyond Southfleet's latest villas stood that enviable house
      "Highfield," cloistered among its trees, and with its
      garden sheltered by a high oak fence. It was built of warm
      red brick, and rather in the French style, with two little
      tourelles pricking their sharp slate-covered ears above the
      trees. There were many windows in "Highfield," and Mrs.
      Pomeroy preferred a house with many windows, for they were
      like strings of pearls upon an imposing bosom. She paused
      at the iron gates, and was able to see the sweep of the
      gravel drive, two brilliant beds of pelargonium and
      loebelia, a strip of lawn, a black cat asleep upon a
      window-sill. "Highfield" possessed a flagstaff, and from
      its throat floated a Union Jack, for a certain Admiral
      Horatio Adams lived here, a stately and hot-tempered old
      gentleman with ice-blue eyes and little white whiskers.
      Admiral Adams was very old and a widower, and Mrs. Pomeroy
      knew him to be a sick man, but the flag was still flying
      and the blinds were up,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy walked on. A dog-cart came bowling behind her
      along the cliff road, but she did not hear it, for she was
      absorbed in contemplating her precious plans. That was the
      predestined house. She would move hell and heaven to
      possess it, and when it was hers she would rename it "The
      Admiral's House." Yes, that would sound so distinguished,
      and taste of so Georgian a flavour. All that remained was
      for the old man to die, and in secret Mrs. Pomeroy did hope
      that he would not procrastinate. She had passed beyond the
      trees and down the hill towards the sea, and behind her Dr.
      Richmond's dog-cart had pulled up outside the iron gates.

      As a dreamer of day-dreams Mrs. Pomeroy was not a woman who
      would sit down on some grassy bank and look at the sea. She
      had no feeling for Nature, and a tree was just a tree,
      unless it was part of some social decoration. She passed
      under the great elms which shaded the hollow of the hill
      road, and was not moved to contemplate them, though what
      the great trees thought of Mrs. Pomeroy might be matter for
      a mystic. She just walked and spun patterns in her head,
      patterns that were festooned with swags of £. s. d. Maybe
      her meditative strolling swallowed up an hour, and
      returning by the same road she looked again upon the
      Highfield trees. Something had happened--something was
      lacking. Dr. Richmond's dog-cart had gone; but half an hour
      ago the doctor had come out of the house, glanced at the
      flag, and walking across the grass had unfastened the
      halyards and let the flag fall until it was half-way down
      the staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy quickened her steps. She came to the iron
      gates, saw the flag hanging half-mast high, and was
      thrilled. She glanced at the windows of "Highfield." The
      blinds were down. Mrs. Pomeroy drew a deep breath. Half an
      hour later she was seated in Mr. Woosnam's private room,
      issuing her instructions across his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want that house."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the Admiral was dead! But Mr. Woosnam had certain
      notions of niceness even in the conduct of so material a
      business as that of the buying and selling of houses. Too
      sudden and tumultuous an approach might appear unseemly. He
      suggested a little apologetically to the lady that it would
      be better to employ a modicum of polite patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would suggest putting out tactful feelers--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want to lose that house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, madam. But, as yet, we don't quite know how
      matters lie. I expect that Mr. Grigson will be acting. I
      could interview him and ask him in confidence whether
      'Highfield' is likely to be on the market."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, see him at once. I know what lawyers are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy might be a valued client, but old Woosnam
      disliked being lectured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I suggest, madam, that I have had some experience in
      these matters. If you will allow me to conduct my business
      in my own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean to have that house. Your business is to get it for
      me. Now, that other matter. What was Golightly's latest
      offer for half the timber-yard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask him six. And Scarron's for the other half?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preposterous. I want twelve thousand for the land. Not a
      penny less. They know as well as I know that it is the most
      valuable new frontage in Southfleet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Woosnam's smile was a kind of inward, sardonic twinkle.
      Frontage! Did not that word apply to the lady? She
      possessed a most formidable frontage!

      Mr. Slade, sitting in his back garden on an August evening
      and hearing the muffled murmur of the High Street as it
      flowed stationwards, was not disturbed by that human hum.
      Rather, it pleased him. It was good to be a little apart
      from the crowd, but it was good to know that the crowd was
      near, and that one's earth was not the icy desolation of
      some lonely planet. Moreover, Mr. Slade was engaged upon a
      very delightful and enthralling task. He had drawn out a
      list of the merchandise that would be displayed in "The Toy
      Mart," and he was checking and adding to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's pencil travelled down the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lead Soldiers--Dolls--Dolls'

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's pencil paused. He sucked the end of it, and
      considered the next item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fireworks for Guy Fawkes' day, and Masks.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, why not? Would Southfleet regard him as an old
      nuisance for providing the young with squibs and
      crackers?--Moreover, would not some immense squib be good
      for the solemn smugness of a portion of the population?
      There were certain ladies who might benefit by having a
      Chinese cracker popping about under their petticoats.
      Masks? Most certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweets? Yes, a few bottles of sweets should be included.
      Particular pets might be allowed to dip into them without
      payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade lay back in his chair, and allowed himself to
      picture his toy-shop as it would be, a miniature Lowther
      Arcade, a riot of colour, a fascination to the young. And
      he would be King of the Castle, the Pied Piper, Father
      Christmas, the Goblin Godfather all in one. Why--at
      Christmas--should he not dress himself for the part, and
      serve in scarlet and white cotton wool? It was an
      idea--yes, very much an idea. With eyes half closed and the
      inventory reposing on his tummy, he contemplated the future
      with utter satisfaction, and with no attention to the
      problem of profit and loss. Then, a sudden trembling of the
      branches of one of Mr. Lovell's summerling apples beyond
      the garden wall moved Mr. Slade to sit up and take notice.
      The tree was set with red-cheeked apples, and the figure of
      a small boy became visible, scrambling and writhing towards
      the forbidden fruit. Who was the thief? And did his duty as
      a citizen exhort him to interfere? Mr. Slade saw a hand
      pluck an apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cissie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll drop them. Hold out your pinny."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rose, and, walking to the wall, tiptoed so that
      he could see over it. A small girl in pink was standing
      with her back to him, spreading her pinafore to catch the
      plunder. The boy's face showed among the leaves. It was the
      face of Mr. Lovell's younger son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy's eyes met Mr. Slade's. There was alarm in them
      that tried to conceal itself behind a mischievous grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cissie wanted an apple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Adam, Adam! The woman tempted me! Does your father
      know, Georgie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he doesn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear! Well, I don't think I'll tell him--if you're
      not too greedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy's freckled face smiled upon Mr. Slade. He pulled an
      apple and prepared for the toss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catch, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade caught the apple, looked at it, and shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's compounding a felony, George. I think Cissie ought
      to have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you keep it, Mr. Slade. I'll just pick three more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just three more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honour bright."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy picked his three apples, and then slid swiftly down
      the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood holding the stolen fruit in his hand and
      regarding it with whimsical embarrassment. Should he
      partake of it, and become one with Cissie, or salve his
      conscience by passing it on to some other child? Oh, man,
      man, relieving himself of the problem by presenting it to
      Eve! No, dash it, he would eat the apple now and
      immediately, and hide the plunder inside him. Most
      certainly he could not return it to Mr. Lovell. He would
      have to make it up to Mr. Lovell in some other way. Mr.
      Slade passed in by the back door, reflecting that a
      sporting God might have had more respect for Adam had that
      cowardly fellow been bolder and more honest. "The woman has
      a way with her, you know, and I--fell. After all, sir, you
      made us that way, and we are not gods like you." Mr. Slade
      bit into the apple, and it was sweet. So could be that
      thing called sin, sweet in the mouth, but sometimes turning
      sour in the belly. Good old English--that. Mr. Slade passed
      through into the shop, and once again allowed himself to
      gloat over its gaiety and the gaiety that was to be.
      Munching his apple, he approached one of the windows to
      watch the holiday crowd sweating stationwards to the music
      of concertinas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's face was close to the glass when another and a
      sudden face came looming up almost within a foot of his.
      This other face confronted him like that of a visitor to an
      aquarium, and he was the fish in the glass tank nibbling at
      ants' eggs or green water-growth. Mr. Slade stopped
      munching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most strangely did he feel like a small boy caught in the
      act of consuming forbidden fruit. Why Clara? Had she come
      to spy out the land? They stood and stared at each other
      through the glass. Perhaps Clara had not expected to be
      confronted by this other face, and that her surprise and
      her embarrassment were as acute as his. Embarrassment. Had
      he ever known Clara to suffer from any such emotion? Then
      he became aware of the lips moving in that other face. It
      was speaking to him. It said, "I have something to discuss
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was not sure of the words, but he did realise
      that Clara's presence was not fortuitous. She wanted
      something. What? He had the shop-door key in his pocket,
      and he extracted it and unlocked the door. His left hand
      continued to clutch the half-eaten apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rustled in and he closed the door. The solidity of her
      massive face and her formidable figure were utterly
      familiar to him, and yet the staging of the scene was new.
      They were meeting on other ground, a shop-floor that was
      his, and with a sudden feeling of puckishness Mr. Slade
      resumed the munching of his apple. The very act seemed to
      symbolise his claim to independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop had acquired its two new cane-bottomed chairs, one
      by each counter, for Mr. Slade's Toy Mart was to divide its
      functions into male and female.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy sat down like some large social problem
      settling itself upon appropriate foundations. Mr. Slade did
      otherwise. His puckishness mounted the counter. He sat
      there with his legs dandling, and went on munching his
      apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you, Clara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      What a challenge was that! She gave him a sudden, upward
      stare, the full glance of the affronted and accusing
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you to be--serious, not frivolous. You were
      always--so--frivolous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Clara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you were. Never grown up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now I'm growing down."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a shrug of impatience and of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to be--serious. It is not for myself that I ask it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had finished his apple, and he laid the core down
      on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One should not eat the pips, Clara, should one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seem to hear this childish remark; at least,
      she did not give it her attention. She was drawing off one
      of her gloves, and there on a plump finger gleamed that
      circle of gold, her wedding-ring. She regarded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember that day, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat up with sudden alertness on his counter, like
      a boy posed with a question by some sly pedagogue in cap
      and gown. Was Clara becoming sentimental? Ye gods, then it
      behoved him to be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember it very well, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned the ring on her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all make mistakes. I will allow that. But you did
      promise me certain things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To love and cherish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's mouth became gently humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Clara, promised to obey me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her large face loomed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mock, man. This is a very serious moment. I have
      come here ready to forgive certain wrongs. I am thinking,
      James, of our daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      What condescension! She was permitting him to claim some
      share in the marital act.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Clara, proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again she glanced at her ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am growing an old woman. My future is not of such
      supreme importance--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humbug," thought Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our daughter's future is that which matters. I have plans
      for Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as marrying her to young Hallard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will marry her to the man she chooses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, will you," thought her husband. "And you will take
      jolly good care to do the choosing."
    </p>
    <p>
      His heels drummed gently against the counter, and the sound
      appeared to irritate the lady. She frowned at his feckless
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want Rose to be happy. I want her future to
      be--without--er--complications. All that I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's heels went on drumming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No rattling of old bones, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do stop fidgeting, and try to realise--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat very still for a moment. Then he got slowly
      off the counter, and went to look out of the shop window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm an old ghost, Clara, eh? But I shan't haunt Rose. Do
      you really think it necessary to come to me and play the
      fond mother? I shall always remain in the cupboard,
      unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned sharply in her chair, and found him confronting
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless? What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just this, Clara. That--if you should try to sell Rose
      into social slavery, I should feel justified in--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you suggest such a thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suggest anything, Clara; but if I were you I
      should keep it in mind."
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      To dream of toys, to paint imaginary pictures of still life
      in toys, and to bring those toys into being were quite
      other matters. Lawyers might dally, and relations bristle
      with obstructions, but Mr. Grigson so contrived that Mr.
      Slade had money lying at the bank. Messrs. Pawley and
      Beckwith's bill was paid, and all the new white shelves
      waited to be dressed, but Mr. Slade found his innocence
      confronted with the commercial problem of stocking his
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did one set about it? Of course, he could have gone up
      to London and purchased toys here, there, and everywhere,
      but what would become of his profit, and how could he
      resell to Southfleet goods purchased at retail prices?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wholesalers! Yes, they were the people, but he knew nothing
      of the wholesale trade in toys, where to go and how to set
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appealed to Mr. Grigson to advise him, and Mr. Grigson,
      smiling his dry smile, said, "Why not consult Mr.
      Golightly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Golightly had the reputation, and rightly so, of being
      the most enterprising trader in Southfleet. Like Mr. Slade,
      he attended St. John's church, and, being a successful man
      and well pleased with life, his attitude to his fellows
      was, if a little patronising, sleek and benign. His top hat
      and frock coat were the glossiest in Southfleet, even more
      so than Dr. Richmond's, and his morning stride to his
      establishment cheerful and brisk and debonair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade laid wait for Mr. Golightly, and accosted him as
      he was passing along Caroline Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. I wonder if you could give me some
      advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Golightly had superfine manners. He traded in silk, and
      his politeness was of the same quality. Moreover, he loved
      giving advice, and he would display his knowledge like your
      perfect salesman serving some eminent lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly Mr. Slade. What is the problem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words Mr. Slade explained his difficulties, adding
      that it was Mr. Grigson who had suggested that Mr.
      Golightly might be willing to place his very great
      experience at Mr. Slade's service. Moreover, Mr. Slade
      hurried to explain that his little toy-shop would not
      intrude upon the prerogatives of Mr. Golightly's much more
      important establishment. Mr. Golightly strode along on his
      oiled legs with silky smoothness, and Mr. Slade pattered
      along beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have come to the right man, Mr. Slade. No, no, there
      is no likelihood of our clashing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wholesale houses. What? Of course. I have had no personal
      dealings with the firm who import and distribute such
      products as toys, but I can find out, I can find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will request my own principal firm to give me
      recommendations. And--an introduction. Yes, yes, I shall be
      most glad to be of assistance to you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Golightly's affability was as glossy as his hat. They
      had turned into the High Street, and Mr. Golightly paused,
      and pointed with a gloved finger at the timber-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too, am engaged upon a new enterprise. I need more
      room, sir, more room. My business is so expansive that I am
      erecting new premises on that site."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped Mr. Slade on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just twenty years ago, yes, just twenty years ago. What
      was I? A young man with a few shillings--and--if I may say
      so--not without imagination--audacity. Taking risks, Mr.
      Slade. That is when a man may prove himself a little
      different--a'hem--from the crowd. I began with one window.
      Now I have eight. Next year it will be twenty. Windows
      are--evidence, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you have deserved your success, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, I hope so. Well, call on me in three or four
      days' time, Mr. Slade, and I am sure that I shall have the
      necessary information for you," and Mr. Golightly swept on
      his long, oiled legs into his establishment, beneficent and
      breezy, and quite sure that God was in Heaven and that all
      was well with his world.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade went to London on a visit to the two Wholesale
      Houses discovered for him by Mr. Golightly, to find himself
      in the display room of a warehouse which was to him a
      veritable magic cave. Mr. Golightly's "Open Sesame" had
      uncovered to Mr. Slade all the treasures of the Purple
      East, though--actually--most of the products came from
      Germany. Here were lead soldiers by the million, boxes upon
      boxes of them, British Grenadiers and Lifeguards, Frenchmen
      in blue and red, Russians in green, Prussians in dark blue,
      with spiky helmets, Lancers, Hussars, Artillery, kilted
      Highlanders, Zulus, even Chinamen. Mr. Slade wallowed in
      soldiers, and in a complete galaxy of toys. He had his list
      with him, and he ticked off item by item, though this
      particular House could not provide him with some of the
      more vulgar and elementary merchandise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid we don't stock wooden spades."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no matter. No doubt such products could be obtained
      elsewhere. Mr. Slade completed his stock list, and was a
      little flabbergasted when he was told how much the order
      would cost him. Well, again, no matter. His toy-shop was to
      be--the toy-shop--in his little world, no shabby show, but
      a Temple of Delight for countless children. He wrote out a
      cheque, and walked out and on to visit a second firm who
      were housed somewhere in The Barbican off Aldergate Street,
      and who were a little less prejudiced against such
      crudities as buckets and spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade returned to Fenchurch Street station feeling like
      a boy who had consumed much sausage-roll, jam tart and
      strawberry ice. He took his seat in a third-class carriage,
      and was carried over and through all that ugliness of
      London's East End, Stepney, Plaistow, the Hams, Barking.
      Why Barking? Perhaps because there was an Isle of Dogs
      somewhere! But Mr. Slade's mood became suddenly more
      personal and poignant. It arrived, as moods will, without
      warning or sweet reasonableness. All these toys, and yet
      something was lacking, some intimate and precious quality
      which came only from the blood and the body of secret
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade and the train were nearing the Laindon Hills
      before the inwardness of that secret yearning revealed
      itself. What of his own child, Rose? Was there any human
      link left between them? May be, he had been nothing to her
      but an old codger who had cleaned boots and carried up
      coals, and waited on her at table. Queer thing life, that
      it should contrive to make you hand soup-plates to your own
      daughter! Assuredly, there had been moments when he and
      Rose had come together in a little world of their own, or
      rather it had been Rose's world, and somewhat out of joint.
      He had caressed with sympathy the troubled and nascent
      woman in her. But was not youth very much absorbed in its
      self, ready, no doubt, to accept sympathy like a box of
      chocolates, and to forget it when the box was empty?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was troubled. He had become a little, lonely
      figure in the corner of his third-class carriage. There
      were yearnings in him that could not be appeased. Even his
      toyshop possessed a significance other than what it seemed.
      His urge to provide toys for children, other people's
      children, might be no more than a subterfuge, emotional
      substitution, self-trickery. His own child was not his, and
      to fill that secret void he had persuaded himself to be a
      toy-merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, both he and Clara were combatants struggling for a
      particular prize, yet--neither of them could vanquish the
      other. He could not break faith with Clara, nor could she
      forget that he held a secret weapon that could kill the
      Golden Calf she worshipped. Clara, in a sense, did possess
      the body of her child, but who possessed her spirit? Yet
      that was an illusion. Who could possess the secret self of
      some other self? The wind bloweth as it listeth, especially
      so the wayward breath of youth. One could be nothing but an
      expectant and faithful weathercock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expectancy! That was the word. The significance of it came
      to James Slade suddenly. He would have to wait like a
      hermit in a cell, in that shop of his. Youth might come to
      him, or it might not.

    <p>
      Mr. Slade was learning to cook. At the moment his
      activities as a chef were very elementary, and had not
      progressed beyond boiling an egg, frying bacon, or
      producing a Welsh rabbit. His more ambitious attempts had
      been disastrous, and had gone to feed the neighbouring
      cats, or into the dustbin, and Mr. Slade was boiling an egg
      for his tea when the railway van rolled up and stopped
      outside his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang, and James Slade, going out to investigate,
      found the vanman at his door with a Goods Delivery Sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name of Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five cases, carriage paid. Where'll you have 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In here, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vanman proceeded to slide the cases over the tail-board
      of the van. They were massive cases, and caused Mr. Slade
      some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they be a bit on the large size."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were. In fact, there was some doubt about the largest
      of them passing through the shop doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please mind the paint, if you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right'o, gov'nor; you go in first and I'll watch the
      paint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade staggered in backwards, with the vanman watching
      the door frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy-o. Yes, she'll do it. Mind your fingers, gov'nor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she'll just do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have 'em on the counter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, on the floor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind your fingers. Easy does it."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the five cases safely in the shop, Mr. Slade thanked
      the vanman, gave him sixpence, and remembered his egg. Half
      the water in the little saucepan had boiled away, and,
      glancing at the kitchen clock, Mr. Slade gathered that the
      process had been going on for twenty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, it will be hard-boiled," thought Mr. Slade,
      "but what does it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hot and a little tremulous with labour and
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he begin the great game of unpacking after tea? Why,
      most certainly. He could not keep his fingers off those
      nice new cases, and the sooner the shop was dressed, the
      sooner would the bread he had cast upon the waters float
      back to him. Leaving the tea-things to be dealt with later,
      he returned to the shop to gloat over those most exciting
      cubes of wood. Which should he open first? The big fellow
      there? Well and good. And then Mr. Slade discovered that he
      had not the wherewithal to do the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul! You old idiot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hammer he did possess, a very modest hammer, but no
      weapon that could be used to prize up the nails. Could he
      borrow such a tool from Mr. Gates, the chemist next door?
      Oh, most probably. Mr. Gates must have had much experience
      with packing-cases. Mr. Gates's shop was open, and Mr.
      Gates himself behind the counter, a little, polished,
      precise person who wore nose nippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you lend me a case opener?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gates could oblige him. He produced a tommy-bar and
      nail-extractor, remarking as he handed over the tool, that
      he might need it to-morrow, and that an early return of it
      was essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged, sir. You shall have it back in half an
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade got to work with expedition and enthusiasm. He
      prized up the lids of all five cases, and then hurried back
      to return the case-opener to its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt like a boy at a bazaar with a Lucky Dip provoking
      him. Should he begin upon the big fellow? A covering of old
      newspapers and straw tantalised his fingers. He removed
      this top-padding and discovered four nice red cardboard
      boxes with coloured labels. Clock-work trains. Mr. Slade
      removed one of the boxes and opened it upon the counter.
      Here were engine and carriages complete, and painted a gay
      green. The immortal child awoke in James Slade. He placed
      the box upon the floor, and, squatting down, coupled up the
      carriages, wound the engine and attached it to the train.
      There was a whirr of wheels, and the train headed straight
      for the front door, and Mr. Slade made a dash for it, and
      guided the engine back to safety. Jolly fun--this! When the
      mechanism had run itself down, he rewound the engine, and
      started the train on a second journey, and stood watching
      it as it buzzed across the floor. Again he had to dive and
      rescue it from colliding with a packing-case. The train
      came to rest within a yard of the shop door. A most
      successful trial run--this! Well, it was time for him to
      get on with the job and cease from being a small boy, but
      happening to glance at the glass panels of the shop door,
      he saw a figure there. Someone was watching him. That
      someone was--Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade stood quite still, gazing at his daughter. Had
      she been watching him fooling about with that toy train?
      But surely this might be a sign from God, the sign for
      which he had prayed, but had not dared to hope for. He had
      waited and his child had come to him. He smiled, and at the
      same instant a smile lit up the face outside the glass.
      James Slade made a sudden movement towards the door. He
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You caught me, my dear. Won't you come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped in, and he closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long had you been standing out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I crawling about on the floor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, laughed, and looked about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very undignified. But toys are toys. I ought to be in
      socks, you know. All this has just arrived. So exciting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are all those full of toys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I was just going to unpack them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid a hand on one of the cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, my dear. But aren't you--rather too old--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not. Do let me help. I'd love to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'd love you to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we do? Dress all the shelves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the windows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade became abruptly grave and paternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the windows. I do that to-morrow. Young
      gentlewomen don't dress shop windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prestige, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade began to remove the cardboard boxes from the big
      packing-case, only to find that Rose had gone off into what
      appeared to be a day-dream. She was leaning against one of
      the counters, and to James Slade her eyes were like two
      dark flowers. What a comely creature was this daughter of
      his, and mysterious to him with all the bloom and mystery
      of youth. Where was the Clara in her? And did God give to
      each child a personality that was not flesh of the flesh of
      those who begot and bore her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are there such a lot of things--which seem to be
      forbidden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a poser for James Slade. He stood holding one of
      the cardboard boxes as though he did not know what to do
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, you know, some things aren't good for us, like
      burning your fingers or eating too much strawberry ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, but some people seem to be so fond of
      saying 'Don't.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, horrid word, isn't it? 'Do' is so much better, but
      you can't get rid of all the 'don'ts.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, looked at him, saw him holding that
      cardboard box, and suddenly she laughed. The child came
      alive in her. She held out her hands for the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm forgetting. Do we open each box?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, when we feel like it. Just curiosity. But we will
      put them away on the shelves, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You unpack, and I'll put away. Oh, Mr. Slade, how nice it
      would be if we could put some people away on the shelf! No,
      I don't mean for always, but just now and again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or--into cupboards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and shut the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some impulse made her take off her hat and place it in a
      corner of one of the shelves. She turned and smiled at Mr.
      Slade, and her eyes said, "Now I'm at home and I'm ready.
      What fun it is going to be." And fun it was, for each box
      had to be opened and looked at before it was stowed away.
      Mr. Slade took off his coat, and worked in his
      shirt-sleeves in a growing flood of packing material which
      rose gradually to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, more soldiers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, more soldiers, I'm afraid. Pretty little fellows,
      aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "French ones, aren't they? I like the red coats best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's as it should be, my dear. Let's try this other
      case. It looks to me more like dolls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolls they proved to be, all packed in nice cardboard
      coffins, blondes and brunettes with staring, glassy eyes.
      These costumed and more lordly ladies occupied the upper
      part of the case, and below them reposed mere common
      wenches in a state of grotesque nudity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Class distinction even in dolls," said Mr. Slade. "Hallo,
      here is one who is leaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed the creature to Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sawdust escaping. Where is the--wound?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, examining the doll, gave a charming little giggle,
      and turned the thing over in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there!" said Mr. Slade. "How very unladylike! Better
      put her aside for repairs, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do it for you if you have a needle and thread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't bother just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The work went on until the shelves were stacked with toys,
      and the floor was a litter of waste paper. The little shop
      had become a patchwork of colour, a live place to delight
      the heart of a child. Mr. Slade was happy and perspiring.
      They emptied the last case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood knee-deep in packing material and surveyed the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a good job done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, moving a box aside, perched herself on a counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you think of everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade ran his fingers through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know. Just let my fancy ramble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever kept a shop before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose became dreamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--almost--think I'd like to keep a shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are shops--and--shops," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, not a butcher's or a fishmonger's. When are you
      going to dress the windows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a day or two. Dozens and dozens of price tickets to be
      filled in and attached. Oh, yes, I shall be very busy. Good
      heavens, do you know what the time is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly seven o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter slid off the counter with a face that had
      become serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! They'll be--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," said Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, stood irresolute, and then she turned and
      kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--have--enjoyed myself. We seem to get on together. I
      wonder why."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was looking a little flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, perhaps--because-- You'll miss the soup!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She dashed to the door, opened it, and turned to smile at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come and buy something. Perhaps I'll be your first
      customer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be. But, my dear, your hat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten her hat. She swept in on her slim legs,
      snatched the hat from the shelf, donned it with a certain
      pretty jauntiness, waved to him and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat down on the counter on the very spot where
      she had been sitting. So, the rose had bloomed in his
      garden, and the unknown child had kissed the unknowable
      father! What had she said? "We seem to get on together. I
      wonder why?" Mr. Slade could imagine his God indulging in
      benignant chuckle, and poking St. Peter in the ribs. What a
      divine joke! "The girl wonders why she gets on with her
      father!" But children do not always feel in sympathy with
      their parents. Oh, no, sir! Perhaps just because they are
      parents. Mr. Slade's face had an almost shy radiance. Was
      it possible that after all he had the advantage of Clara,
      and that the pride of possession lost you the treasure you
      possessed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's left hand touched something on the counter, the
      body of the nude puppet with the leaky skin. He glanced at
      the object, gathered it in his hand, and gazed whimsically
      at the rent in its poor posterior. Could a doll sacrifice
      its sawdust to--destiny? Mr. Slade descended from the
      counter, and, going in search of a needle and cotton, he
      cobbled up the gaping wound. It was not a very workmanlike
      job but it would suffice, and the victim had somehow become
      for him a saintly object that was not for sale. He sat Miss
      Sawdust on the kitchen mantelpiece next to the kitchen
      clock, her absurd and rather clumsy legs sticking out, her
      blue eyes staring under a thatch of yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Slade remembered all that litter on the shop
      floor. What was to be done with it? Why, of course, he
      would burn it, light a bonfire, a sacrificial flame. He
      felt like a bonfire and a bottle of beer. Both were
      accorded him. He carried all that rubbish out into the back
      garden, and piling it on a weedy patch of soil set it
      alight. The blaze was hearty and symbolical and flared just
      as the dusk began to descend. The chemist's lady, going to
      pull down a bedroom blind, saw a little, dark, gnomelike
      figure dancing round the bonfire, a rake in one hand, a
      glass of beer in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      How very ridiculous! What a strange neighbour! Was Mr.
      Slade addicted to drink?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade found the dressing of his shop windows to be a
      much more public business. One window was to be male, and
      the other female, and Messrs. Pawley and Beckwith had
      constructed for him two tiers of shelves sloping backwards
      and upwards like those cast-iron contraptions which display
      potted plants in a conservatory. There was just sufficient
      room for Mr. Slade to squeeze past these shelves into each
      window, and he found it simpler and less hard on the knees
      of his trousers to push a dozen exhibits on to the raised
      floor of the window and then climb in and arrange them.
      Being a little gentleman, he began on the window for little
      ladies, and his labour commenced immediately after
      breakfast. The first hour was fairly tranquil, but, as the
      day and Southfleet got busy, Mr. Slade became increasingly
      conscious of himself as a kind of human show-piece. It
      really was extraordinary how many citizens of his
      acquaintance passed along the High Street that morning.
      Some passed, looked in, smiled and nodded. He saw lips
      move, and heard faint voices. Most of them said,
      "You--are--busy, Mr. Slade." And James Slade began to feel
      quite self-conscious about it, and tried to keep his back
      to the sheet of glass as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone's knuckles rapped on the glass. Mr. Slade turned to
      look, and found Mr. Golightly nodding at him, a sleek and
      benign patron of the arts of trade. Mr. Golightly's mouth
      was saying something, and Mr. Slade felt it to be his duty
      to speak with Mr. Golightly. He emerged backwards, opened
      the door, and wished Mr. Golightly good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, window-dressing, Mr. Slade. I've done it in my time.
      It can be quite--embarrassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, almost like one of those dreams, sir, when you find
      yourself at a party in your night-shirt. May I thank you
      for your very great help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I'm glad my introduction carried weight. You seem to
      have quite a nice selection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid," and Mr. Golightly beamed upon him and strode
      smoothly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Sawkins appeared. He stood, staring in, and
      sucking his teeth. He stared so long and so rudely that Mr.
      Slade became irritated. A voice from the eggy beard burbled
      at him. It said something about this window-dressing being
      a funny job for a man of such mature years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade shouted, "I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sawkins shouted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Slade made a face at Mr. Sawkins, and Mr. Sawkins
      drew away in high offence. Nor was Mr. Slade as remorseful
      as he should have been. He planted a doll on one of the
      shelves, and said to her, "Tell him to go and break another
      egg in his mothy beard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came--Clara. Mr. Slade was arranging various exhibits
      about a gay posy of dolls. Mrs. Pomeroy paused. She made
      herself pause and confront this vulgar business, and a pair
      of lorgnettes, had she possessed them, should have been
      focused on Mr. Slade. Mrs. Pomeroy was to be known among
      the ironic as "The Duchess of Highfield," and she surveyed
      Mr. Slade in his glass case with distaste and Roman-nosed
      hauteur. This old fool who appeared to be enjoying second
      childhood! Well, in all probability the idiot would lose
      his money, and be compelled to accept her final terms. She
      would plant him peacefully and harmlessly in some London
      suburb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, struck between the shoulder-blades by that
      concentrated stare, turned suddenly about, and discovered
      Clara on the pavement. Mr. Slade had in his hand one of
      those ridiculous baubles that used to be given to infants,
      a sort of miniature bone umbrella-stick hung with bells.
      Mr. Slade smiled and nodded at Clara, and shook the bells
      at her. They seemed to emit a thin, musical giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, like Mr. Sawkins before her, took offence,
      and with a freezing stare gathered her dignity and passed
      on. Mr. Slade watched her. Clara's bustle waggled itself in
      angry protest. She had a most expressive posterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoity-toity!" said Mr. Slade, and went on with the
      dressing of his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the children. Schooling was over for the morning,
      and Mr. Slade became a fish in a glass tank against whose
      transparent surface small faces flattened themselves. Yet,
      somehow, Mr. Slade was not embarrassed by these children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo-er, I'd like that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her in the pink frock."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys seemed to think it rather a poor show, and they
      scurried off and left their dawdling sisters. Mr. Slade had
      nearly completed the feminine window. He emerged, opened
      the shop door, and addressed the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite ready for you yet, my dears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will it be open, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked across the pavement, and, standing in the
      roadway, contemplated his handiwork. Yes, by jumping
      Jehosophat--the shop was gay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade received his first customer at about three
      o'clock that afternoon. Mr. Slade had begun to dress the
      boys' window, and, though the shop was not yet open to the
      public, when a particular lady came to the door, which was
      locked, Mr. Slade scrambled out of his show-case and
      unlocked the door. If there was one person in Southfleet to
      whom all the town was ready to unlock doors, that person
      was Lucie Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I am trespassing, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, madam, not at all. Please come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reclosed the door, and hurried to put a chair forward
      for this lovely person. Mrs. Richmond sat down, and looked
      about her, and when she looked at a thing it seemed to
      gather an enhanced value.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What fun for you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade bowed to her. "Thank you, madam. It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost you make me wish that I was seven years old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are--seven, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were such happy eyes. They were eyes that would
      never grow old. Yes, Mrs. Richmond was a very lovely
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I serve you in any way, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a doll. Could you let me have one. I had very
      nearly forgotten a godchild's birthday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure, madam. What is your fancy? Blonde or
      brunette."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How happy could I be with either!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade completed the couplet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were the other fair charmer away."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for him to ransack the window. A row of
      dolls sat on one of the shelves, and Mr. Slade bowed to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies, forward, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond turned her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I see that one in the strawberry frock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade reached for the lady, and, holding her by the
      waist, exhibited the doll to Mrs. Richmond. She smiled at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are--other ways, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just how, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond took the doll from him, and, slipping a hand
      under the creature's frock from behind, smiled at Mr.
      Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see, madam. One doesn't clutch a lady by the
      middle--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he coughed and blushed. Nor did you thrust a hand
      up and under a gentlewoman's petticoat. But dolls were
      different, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond turned the doll this way and that, like a
      bird perched on her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she undress, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know, madam. My investigations have not
      proceeded--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade took down another doll, a blonde in blue, and was
      careful to display her in the proper professional manner.
      His eyes were watching Mrs. Richmond's face when the door
      opened, and his second customer appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose! Well, well, for an old fellow he was doing very well
      this afternoon, with the two Beauties of Southfleet
      gathered in his parlour. Moreover, to James Slade this was
      an almost God-given coincidence, a sign--if not in the
      heavens, then in his shop. Yet, the occasion was not
      without its trepidations. How did the mother of Charles and
      his daughter mix?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Richmond; you are here first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade would have said that the unique quality that
      characterised both these creatures was the radiance they
      seemed to bring with them into his shop. Mrs. Richmond was
      smiling up at Rose, and Rose was smiling down at her. They
      looked as though they were ready to kiss and be kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I stolen your doll, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you chosen the blue one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think I prefer Miss Strawberry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rubbed his hands together as though washing them
      in happy unction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want a gentleman doll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, my dear? Bless my soul, I don't think I have such
      a creature. What a lapse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it for, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little Jenny Hooper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My god-daughter. But does Jenny--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jenny seems to love a sailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How forward of her! But I have an idea. If we took Miss
      Bluebell and cut her hair and put her in a sailor suit,
      she--I mean he and Miss Strawberry would make a pretty
      pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got a sailor suit, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ashamed to say I haven't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I could make one," said Lucie Richmond. "It would
      not take long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you? But why should you bother, Mrs. Richmond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't any trouble. Can I have the doll, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, madam. As she is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, in a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. In a state of Nature, madam! Perhaps Miss Pomeroy
      will act as nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are shy, Mr. Slade!"
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      James Slade made of the male window a veritable Place d'
      Armes. He paraded the troops very early in the morning, for
      the arranging of them necessitated his kneeling or lying on
      his tummy while he removed the soldiers from their boxes
      and massed them below the tiers of shelves. Here were
      Guardsmen and French infantry of the Line, Zouaves, Green
      Russians, Cavalry, guns and limbers, white bell-tents, and
      a miniature fort. It was a grand display, and boys came to
      flatten their faces against the window and gaze covetously
      upon these little men of lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that first week Mr. Slade made a number of
      discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, that "The Toy Mart" promised to become a kind of
      Children's Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, that his shop was too much a luxury shop, and
      that a selection of twopenny toys was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, that Free Sweets for the favoured meant sweets for
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, that the shop promised to make a slave of him,
      and that cooking and bed-making, and what not, kept him
      going from dawn to dusk, and that he was quite unable to
      get out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something would have to be done about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, was it not obvious that he needed help, a woman to
      run the house for him, while he gave all his time to "The
      Toy Mart," and took his exercise when the shop was closed?
    </p>
    <p>
      But a woman about the place!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rubbed his chin, and regarded with resignation
      the day's collection of crockery waiting to be washed up
      and put away. Peace, perfect peace; but would such a state
      continue with a woman in the house? Dash it all, why could
      not cups and saucers and plates wash themselves up, and
      beds get themselves made? Then, there was a fortnight's
      washing waiting to go to the laundry, and he was out of
      butter and tea. For two days he had not been out of doors,
      and when he had rushed forth after closing the shop, all
      other shops were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what was he going to do about it? Admit some Eve into
      his Garden of Eden, or continue to exist like a
      half-starved old Tom Cat? Could he close the shop from noon
      till three? No, that would be bad for trade. But supposing
      he managed to persuade some respectable person to come in
      daily and do for him? Where was he to find such a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, undoubtedly he needed advice, but in such a situation
      neither Mr. Grigson nor Mr. Golightly could help him. This
      was a she-problem. It could be dealt with only by a
      petticoat person. And then he thought of Mrs. Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very woman! Mrs. Eliza might know of some reliable lady
      who could cook and wash up and make beds, and set him free
      to concentrate upon the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade seized upon the inspiration, and, when the
      closing hour had come, he put on his hat and overcoat and
      walked out into the autumn dusk to visit Caroline Terrace.
      Dear old Simple Simon that he was, he did not suspect that
      the most elementary of man's problems cannot be solved
      without interference from the emotions, and yet it was this
      very simplicity that was to protect him. James Slade knew
      nothing of secret and middle-aged tendernesses, and of a
      sacred teacup preserved in Mrs. Eliza's top drawer. Mrs.
      Eliza might possess an incipient beard and a formidable
      front, but she was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade slipped silently down the area steps and rang the
      kitchen bell. He rather wanted to see Mrs. Eliza alone, and
      without advertising his affairs to all the other wenches,
      so, when Bertha opened the door to him, he raised his hat
      to her and asked if Mrs. Eliza was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, Dad. Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade felt embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I mustn't, my dear. Work to do. I wonder if Mrs. Eliza
      would give me a minute out here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Dad, I'll tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza could not confess that she "Felt all funny" when
      Mr. Slade's message was delivered to her. Such matronly
      emotion had to be concealed. She arose, and walked solidly
      out of the kitchen, pausing in the passage to remove her
      cap. Meetings at the area door--and at this hour--were
      flavoured with romance, and Mrs. Eliza's heart was like a
      Christmas pudding that was being stirred with a wooden
      spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Slade, it's you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade bobbed his hatless head at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come to you, Mrs. Eliza, for advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza drew a deep breath, and remembered to close the
      area door. If a proposal was in the air she did not want
      those girls listening and giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course, Mr. Slade. Anything--for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been wondering, Eliza, whether you could find me
      a--woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Find him a woman! Well--really! But--then--of course, Mr.
      Slade could not quite mean what the vulgar-minded might
      assume. Besides, wasn't she a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know, Eliza, I'm finding things a bit too much
      for me, looking after both the shop and the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you got anybody to do for you, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear, that's too bad. And you knowing nothing about
      cooking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza's voice was the voice of a dove, but Mr. Slade
      merely felt that she was being sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you might know of someone who could come in for
      a few hours each day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you want anybody to live in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather not, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza felt somewhat baffled and chilled. If this was a
      way of proposing it seemed to be rather subtle and
      circuitous. But--then--of course, Mr. Slade might be
      feeling shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--quite--understand, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see--there are women and women. I'm an old bachelor,
      Eliza, and, please God, I shall never be anything else. And
      any sort of woman might make a nuisance of herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any sort--would, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's why I thought of asking the advice of an old
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza drew a breath and held it, for the truth had
      become abruptly obvious to her that this meeting in the
      area was not flavoured with romance. An old friend, indeed!
      Her disillusionment was so acute that for the moment her
      matronly juices seemed to turn sour in her, and being angry
      with herself and with everything she felt angry with Mr.
      Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I'd like to advise a man about a thing
      like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was surprised. Why had Eliza's voice suddenly
      gone throaty and formal?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I wouldn't. You never know what a woman might do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cooped up with a man who's as innocent as you are, Mr.
      Slade. I may be an old friend--but--there are limits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was beginning to feel perplexed and
      uncomfortable. Had he offended Eliza, and if so--how? He
      essayed to make a joke of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think she might--seduce me, Eliza? Or that the cat
      would eat up the canary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza's bosom heaved. Love was not a thing to joke
      about, especially when you were close on fifty, and a man
      could be so frivolous about it. Mrs. Eliza felt compelled
      to be shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't use such a word to me, Mr. Slade. It isn't a
      nice word, and I've got my feelings about things. If I were
      you I'd go to a proper registry office, yes, I would. Miss
      Pinhook is the woman for you. Excoose me, but I've got the
      supper to see to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade found himself standing alone in the dark area.
      Now, what in the name of Heaven had made Eliza ruffle up
      like that? What had he said that could have offended her?
      Seduction? Well, after all, both he and she--as old friends
      and elderly friends, could have a little joke together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade re-climbed the area steps, vaguely conscious of
      having put his foot into something--but into what?

      The Admiral was dead and buried, and Highfield House for
      sale, but so swift was Mrs. Pomeroy's pounce that the
      property could not be said to have come on the market. She
      purchased it for the sum of three thousand pounds, and for
      six months she was to be the happiest of women. Her immense
      energy was let loose upon the place. It was to be
      redecorated from top to bottom, but at the most economic
      figure, and Messrs. Pawley and Beckwith's estimate was the
      one to be accepted. The Admiral had left a billiard table
      behind him, and Mrs. Pomeroy purchased the table. It was a
      symbol of her ascent into the new world. She could picture
      the Hallards and the Gages and the Ransomes pushing the
      ivory balls about after dining with her and her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that on the very evening of Mrs. Eliza's
      disillusionment Mrs. Pomeroy rang her bell. Bertha, who
      answered it, was told that Mrs. Pomeroy had an announcement
      to make to her staff, and that they were to mount the
      stairs to her private room. Mrs. Eliza led the procession.
      They found Mrs. Pomeroy in purple velvet, and sitting in
      state before the fire, with her daughter in attendance.
      Mrs. Pomeroy was gracious and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza and you girls, I think it right to let you know that
      I am retiring, and that the hotel will be for sale. You may
      decide to stay on, or you may not. I wish to thank you all
      for the service you have given me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was enjoying herself. The moment was dressed
      in purple velvet. Success could be advertised--even to your
      staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, a silence that might have suggested that
      these menials were properly impressed. Mrs. Pomeroy sat and
      waited as though expecting someone to express regret, but
      Eliza was the only one to find her voice, and if Eliza
      sounded a little peevish it was not because she and Mrs.
      Pomeroy were parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know, ma'am. I'm not so young as I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Eliza, you can come with me. I have bought
      Highfield House. It will be a much easier place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it would be, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shall need a parlour-maid and a housemaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, having played for her contrasts, smiled upon
      her maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same wages, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza, looking stubborn, rubbed her large chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think it over, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So will I," said Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the kitchen, and Mrs. Eliza sat down by
      the fire and rubbed her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drat my rheumatics! Going with her? No, not me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her decision was shared by the others. The hotel was not a
      bad sort of place, and it might be a much better place
      without Mrs. P. And there were the tips to be considered.
      The staff decided that it had enjoyed a surfeit of the
      Pomeroy regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza went to bed with her rheumatics and a sudden
      feeling of remorse. She enjoyed a change of heart. She did
      not covet a new place such as Highfield at her time of
      life. Lowfield would be more appropriate. And there was
      poor old Mr. Slade alone in a house, and trying to do his
      own cooking, poor old dear. Eliza felt that she had been
      harsh to Mr. Slade. Becoming sentimental at her age, too!
      Silly old fool! If Mr. Slade was not the marrying sort,
      well, there were advantages in being single. Besides, if
      she made the old man comfortable, he might come to think--
      Yes, you never knew. Eliza might put romance away in her
      bottom drawer, but that would not prevent her from taking
      it out again if she found that a man was willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Eliza took French leave next morning, and appeared in
      Mr. Slade's shop while he was engaged in selling a box of
      soldiers for somebody's birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mrs. Eliza. Won't you sit down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza sat down, and when the lady customer had
      departed she made her apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I was a bit short with you, Dad, last night.
      Fact is--my rheumatics was worrying me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Mrs. Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it isn't all right. I lay awake thinking of you trying
      to do everything. I said to myself--he'll get indigestion.
      Yes, you know you do, Mr. Slade, if you don't get proper
      time for your meals. She told us last night she was giving
      up the hotel, and she wants me to go to the new place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And shall you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not likely. If you want a woman to do for you, Mr. Slade,
      I'd be willing to come to you. You see--I know your ways,
      and I shan't be a noosance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you wouldn't be a nuisance, Eliza. I think I
      should be very glad to have you. It's quite a nice little
      kitchen, and there's a bedroom at the back. I'm settling
      into the first floor front as a sitting-room. The stairs
      aren't too bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza breathed in deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know my place, Mr. Slade, and a gentleman when I see
      him. They do say in Southfleet that you keep shop like a
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade laughed and looked coy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very kind of them, I'm sure, Eliza."
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza gave Mrs. Pomeroy a month's notice, but she did
      not tell that lady that she was to become Mr. Slade's
      housekeepeer, cook, hand-maid and mender of socks. Silence
      was the best policy with a person like Mrs. Pomeroy, and,
      had the lady known who had stolen her cook from her, she
      might have accused Mr. Slade of enticement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Eliza. I thought that after all these years you
      might feel loyal to your old mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza did not say she was sorry. In fact, she said very
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With my rheumatics, ma'am, I don't feel like a big place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, during that month of waiting, Mr. Slade was not to be
      without help in the house. Eliza persuaded a married sister
      to go in for two hours daily, and wash up and cook and make
      Mr. Slade's bed. Eliza regarded Sister Jane as an
      insurance, or a broody hen who would keep the nest warm for
      her without any idea of remaining there in perpetuity. Mr.
      Slade was to be protected from designing females, and Eliza
      did not regard herself as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade was able to take a little exercise after he
      had closed the shop, especially so on Sunday afternoons. He
      spent the morning in church. Jane managed to cook him a
      Sunday dinner, and afterwards Mr. Slade would put his feet
      up, smoke a pipe, and indulge in forty winks. After tea he
      liked to visit Mr. Truslove's grave, and leave flowers
      there before taking a brisk walk. He liked to go down
      through Caroline Gardens to the parade, and along it to the
      Old Town and past the saltings to the Coast Guard station.
      Sometimes he walked on the pier, and filled himself with
      sea air after six days in the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life sprung a surprise on Mr. Slade in Caroline Gardens.
      Mr. Kemp, one of the gardeners, stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be you a subscriber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm afraid I'm not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to do my duty, Mr. Slade, though it don't give me
      no pleasure doin' it with certain people. Y'see, when you
      was at the hotel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I hadn't thought of that. Well, I should like
      to be a subscriber, Mr. Kemp. How much will it cost me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten bob a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I pay you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can pay me, Mr. Slade. I'll pass it on, and the
      trustees will give you a ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade became a subscriber, and was free to walk or
      sit as he pleased in the gardens above the sea. This new
      kind of freedom seemed cheap at ten shillings, and for such
      a sum it appeared that you could be promoted to a new
      social order. You were a person who paid for a particular
      privilege, not one of those who was paid by the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society attempted to thrust yet another privilege upon the
      proprietor of "The Toy Mart." Mr. Slade continued to occupy
      the same obscure back seat at St. John's Church. He would
      be one of the last to leave, and one Sunday the verger
      plucked him by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you prefer a private sitting, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had not considered such promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. I think I am all right where I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      The verger was not of that opinion. A man in Mr. Slade's
      position ought to go up higher, and pay for the privilege.
      The church funds had to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a corner seat, in Mr. Messom's pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not desire to sit in Mr. Messom's pew, and he
      said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think I will stay where I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please, Mr. Slade. If you prefer
      a--free--seat--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was it! When you became a man of property you were
      expected to pay for the performance. And did God check off
      the list of His supporters and accord special favour to
      those who feed Him by taking a private pew?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was feeling naughty about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do put a shilling in the plate, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The verger took the joke sourly. If a man was so mean, and
      had no proper appreciation of his duties as a churchgoer
      and a citizen, there was nothing more to be said about it.
      So Mr. Slade remained in his obscure back-seat among those
      who were not asked to go up higher.
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza's trunk arrived on a hand-cart, and was taken in
      at the side door. She and the lad who had acted as porter
      carried the trunk up to the little back bedroom, and Mrs.
      Eliza, having paid the lad, sat down on her bed. Well, here
      she was in her new home and feeling a little flustered,
      for, in passing the shop, she had seen Mr. Golightly and
      Mr. Slade standing in the doorway in friendly conversation.
      Mr. Slade had been to his tailor and was wearing a very
      presentable new suit, and looking, Eliza had thought, quite
      the equal of Mr. Golightly, and Mr. Golightly was an
      important person in Southfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, old man--supper on Sunday at eight-thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Golightly had called Mr. Slade "Old man," and Mr.
      Slade was supping at No. 17 Caroline Terrace! Mr. Slade
      might not be aware of these subtle indications, or of the
      gradations that were elevating him into a civic person, but
      to Mrs. Eliza they were obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Eliza Cotgrove, just you remember you are his cook,
      and don't get silly bees in your bonnet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza removed that self-same bonnet, heaved a sigh,
      and laid the bonnet on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eliza had brought a surprising piece of information
      with her, and when Mr. Slade poked his head into the
      kitchen to welcome her, he found her, sleeves rolled up,
      and making pastry with an air of self-chastened gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Eliza, very glad to see you here. Is everything all
      right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is anything you want, tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No complications, I hope? Was--Mrs. Pomeroy--?
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all over, Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, in what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's moving out at the end of the month. The hotel's
      sold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza was busy with the rolling-pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd never guess, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's bought it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Sawkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sawkins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And a nice mean mess he'll make of it. Suppose he
      thinks he can put his feet up anywhere, and take the best
      chair by the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, well! There is one thing I am glad about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't to clean Mr. Sawkins's boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said Eliza, "I should say so. He's not fit to clean
      yours."
    </p>

    <p>
      Autumn leaves were falling. They lay upon the lawns of
      Highfield House, and upon the paths and the playground of
      Caroline Gardens. Oak leaves drifting and floating past the
      Highfield windows might have peered in like little sprites
      and beheld the rich autumnal colour of Mrs. Pomeroy's
      fancy. The dining-room was old gold and maroon, the
      drawing-room the colour of cherry leaves in autumn. In the
      bedrooms Mrs. P's. fancy was more summerlike, crushed
      strawberry for her daughter, and for herself a suggestion
      of Rose du Barry flecked with golden Fleur de Lys. The
      billiard-room was solemn bronze, the library a
      contemplative amber. Mr. Golightly was providing the
      curtains, velvet of various splendours. Twice weekly Mrs.
      Pomeroy took a return first-class ticket to London to
      purchase carpets, linen, silver, cutlery, furniture. She
      was a very busy and a very dignified lady. Salesmen were
      silk to her velvet. The old timber-yard had been sold for
      the figure she had demanded. Other little ventures in real
      estate were proving profitable. Mr. Sawkins had paid up the
      purchase price of the Caroline Hotel, Mrs. Pomeroy could
      count upon capital amounting to some thirty-five thousand
      pounds, and an income of fifteen hundred pounds a year. Her
      fancy floated to other altitudes. Messrs. Gregg and
      Gowland, carriage-makers and wheelwrights, had a
      second-hand Victoria for sale. Mrs. Pomeroy purchased it
      and had it re-painted, black with yellow wheels, and new
      fawn coloured upholstery fitted to the interior. Someone
      was commissioned to find and to buy for her a couple of
      good carriage-horses, preferably greys. She proposed to
      employ a groom and a gardener. Her establishment should be
      the smartest and the most up-to-date in Southfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one fly in her honeypot, and the insect was,
      of course, James Slade. It would have been easy for her to
      leave Southfleet, and exercise her social ambitions in some
      strange watering-place, but she had set out to conquer
      Southfleet, and conquer it she would. Already her feet were
      preparing to cross the sacred thresholds of the town's most
      exclusive clique. A Hallard marriage was to crown her
      efforts. Meanwhile James Slade was thinking of Christmas
      and its decorations. He was dreaming of festoons of
      coloured paper, Chinese lanterns, and a ten-foot Christmas
      tree complete with candles, glass balls, white wool and
      artificial frost. As a financial concern "The Toy Mart" was
      prospering, and Mr. Slade was returning money to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy sometimes passed the shop. She would pause to
      look in its windows and through the glass panel of the
      door. She hoped for emptiness and found it not. James Slade
      was always doing business, and never once did Mrs. Pomeroy
      surprise the shop in a state of nudity. How very annoying!
      Had Mr. Slade been able to squander the proceeds of that
      wretched legacy she could have resumed the role of the
      magnanimous autocrat, and imposed upon a potential pauper
      terms that would have retained him in distant obscurity.
      But if James Slade prospered? Oh, well, prosperity might
      satisfy his silly old soul. But she did confess to herself
      in secret that, though revenge might be sweet, it was not
      always profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had fallen to Fireworks. Christmas was not yet,
      and that other festival beloved of children preceded it. In
      fact, fireworks were forced upon Mr. Slade by the young.
      They came in with their pennies and arranged their little
      faces along the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you got any fireworks, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you going to have any fireworks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or masks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade began to realise that he was failing his clients.
      He would have to go up to London and buy fireworks and
      masks, and shut up the shop for the afternoon, for Eliza's
      arithmetic was not her strong point, and she was apt to be
      tart with children. But before Mr. Slade set upon this
      mission, someone called at the shop, and that someone was
      Mr. Charles Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got any fireworks, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm afraid I haven't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, I say, there is not a respectable squib in the
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very disgraceful! And what are respectable squibs
      like, Mr. Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles laughed. Old Slade was a jolly old beggar, and he
      understood things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want some real rousers. I'm going to be home for
      the Fifth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid, sir, mischief is in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just a back garden show to cheer up the cats. I
      suppose I'll have to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm buying fireworks, Mr. Charles. Do you happen to know
      of a good place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, rather. Cocks's in Cheapside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are, sir, I'll go there. And you want some
      super-squibs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a dozen. If I can get the pater on to it--I've got an
      idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you have lots of ideas, Mr. Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, don't give it away. We're going to have a blaze in
      Caroline Gardens. Get all the kids we know in, and some of
      the old--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cats, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles crinkled up his freckled nose just as he had done
      as a small boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chinese crackers, Mr. Slade, bouncing about under--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precise petticoats. How naughty of you, Mr. Charles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you would be quite ready to chuck a few, Mr.
      Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, perhaps not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better come along to my party."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade travelled up to London, and, as it happened,
      by the same train as Mrs. Pomeroy, but not in the same
      class. They had passed each other on the platform, and Mr.
      Slade had raised his hat to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy took a cab to Tottenham Court Road, but Mr.
      Slade went on foot to Cheapside. That casual clash upon the
      platform had set Mrs. Pomeroy's temper on edge, and spoilt
      the serenity of an afternoon's shopping. Had there been
      irony in the way James Slade had addressed her and raised
      his hat? Bothersome little creature! But Mr. Slade was in
      the best of tempers. He squandered quite a considerable sum
      upon fireworks and masks, and invited himself to tea to an
      Aerated Bread shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have a muffin, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was getting into the way of my dearing everybody,
      and his benignity was such that he might slip into the
      sacrilege of my dearing Clara. He had his muffin.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later the army was withdrawn from the masculine
      window, and it became gay with grotesque masks and every
      sort of firework, rockets, bundles of squibs, golden rain,
      crackers, Catherine Wheels, Roman Candles. Mr. Slade was
      kept very busy, especially so by the small sixpenny
      shoppers, who were determined to make six pennies go as far
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charles Richmond came in for his squibs, and was also
      the purchaser of a bearded mask and a fine collection of
      pyrotechnical sundries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pater has fallen to the joke. Six o'clock in Caroline
      Gardens, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd better wear a mask. Incognito, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good idea! I'll try and persuade the pater to do the same.
      It's going to be fun, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so, Mr. Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the great Dr. Richmond could appreciate a rag, and
      remember the uproarious days of his apprenticeship to
      Medicine.

    <p>
      Charles Richmond's masked party was to be other than it
      seemed, and to Mr. Slade almost tragedy in comedy, Eros
      suddenly grown carnal man among the children. That the
      Trustees of Caroline Gardens deigned to permit such a party
      was a sop to Fate, and though Dr. Richmond could not permit
      himself to wear a mask, he presented his son with two
      golden sovereigns as a contribution towards the display.
      Charles was back at Guys, and it was his mother who called
      on Mr. Slade with a list of her son's needs, and it was a
      long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, Mr. Slade, we shall almost empty your shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was very happy when serving this Lovely Person.
      Almost a shop chair seemed no adequate throne for her. He
      dashed up into his sitting-room and returned with a
      cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond accepted the cushion, not because she needed
      it, but as though Mr. Slade had presented her with a
      bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son has written out a list."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I shall be able to supply--everything. May I have
      the list, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid it on the counter, and Mr. Slade bowed his head
      over it. He had no baldness to conceal, but a rather fine
      head of hair which was turning white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dozen squibs, three dozen golden rain, twelve
      rockets, two dozen Roman Candles, two dozen Catherine
      Wheels, three dozen Chinese Crackers, a dozen masks. If I
      may say so, madam, Mr. Charles does not do things by
      halves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond smiled at Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am afraid Charles--is lavish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might I be allowed to call him generous, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you don't believe in carefulness, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do and I don't, madam. If I profit by your son's
      lavishness, I am also--cheered--by his spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      What an unusual old shopman was this! Mrs. Richmond was
      observing his hands. They were less toil-worn than of old,
      and meticulously clean. Yes, sensitive hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage all this, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, madam. I can put in another order to my
      suppliers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't bother to deliver. I will send Howell round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do I owe you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will take a little working out, madam. May I send the
      bill with the parcels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hastened to open the door for her, and stepped
      out on to the pavement to watch her walk away. Blessed be
      Her Loveliness, and might her son--! Mr. Slade made a
      little bow in the direction of that graceful figure. She
      would not observe this instinctive act of homage, but never
      mind. Now if, instead of Clara, he had? Mr. Slade felt
      someone tugging at his sleeve. He looked down to one side
      and saw a small girl, one of his favourites, Polly Harker,
      with a penny in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have some jujubes, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly had her jujubes, and the penny was returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo, thank you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out the small paper bag to him, which contained
      more than a mere pennyworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you have one, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had one, and was surprised sucking a sweet by his
      next customer. He swallowed it hurriedly, for certain
      ladies might not think it polite of him if he had a jujube
      voice when serving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had always held November to be a much maligned
      month, and more benign and consoling than April. Maybe,
      that by November you had shed all illusions, or harvested
      those that had set ripe seed. Yes, the fruits of the earth
      were gathered in, the corn in the granary, the apples in
      some cool cellar. April, with its raw urges and its cry of
      "Sweet--what? I do not know what or why!" was somewhere in
      the past with the dead primroses and sleeping wind-flowers.
      This November was particularly serene, a golden month with
      morning mists furling themselves like grey blinds into the
      pale blue of the sky. The month was Mr. Slade's mood in its
      manifestings. The leaves were yellow above you and yellow
      about your feet. The incipient tang of winter gave you the
      right to light a fire and sit before it. No winds blew as
      yet, or made a moaning in the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was to remember that November evening. He closed
      the shop at half-past five, put on an overcoat, slipped a
      box of crackers and some matches into his pockets, and set
      off down the High Street. How Mr. Truslove would have
      enjoyed this prospective bit of fun! The lights of
      Southfleet winked at him. Dr. Richmond's dogcart rolled
      past him with its two yellow eyes staring straight ahead.
      The old timber-yard was like a dark void in the spangled
      street, a melancholy place, like a great, empty, voiceless
      mouth, but Mr. Slade knew that other adventures were in
      progress there. New, brick frontages and plate-glass
      windows were to replace the green gloom of the fallen
      chestnut trees. "Under the village chestnut tree--!" No,
      poetry did not apply. Mr. Golightly's new windows would
      smile at you like some polite shopwalker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just not be there," thought Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lovejohn, a junior gardener, was on special duty at the
      gate, and Mr. Lovejohn had a grievance. He was surly to Mr.
      Slade. Like most of those whom Burke had described as "The
      Swinish Multitude," he had to be bribed if any additional
      exertion was required of him. His response to any
      altruistic proposal would be, "What do I get out of it?"
      And here was John Lovejohn on a November night stuck at a
      gate because his betters had a party, and no one as yet had
      offered him beer or half-a-crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a ticket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you can't come in. It's a private party. A lot of
      fools lettin' off fireworks. And--we--have to clear up the
      mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade remained benign. It was the ultimate resignation
      that wisdom forced upon you in your dealings with the lazy
      and unimaginative many.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I do come in, Lovejohn. I provided the--mess, and
      Mr. Richmond invited me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lovejohn's heavy hands remained upon the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got anything to show?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shall have, you know. A letter of complaint to the
      Trustees on the discourtesy of a member of the staff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm dooing my dooty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How English of you, Lovejohn, how very English," but the
      argument was settled by the arrival at the gate of Dr.
      Richmond. Dr. Richmond was a Trustee, and Mr. Lovejohn
      fawned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evenin', sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, is that you, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along in. You were the provider of the feast."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate was opened, and Mr. Slade passed through with the
      doctor's hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a golden glow down yonder among the oak trees.
      Charles and his satellites had collected the material for a
      bonfire in that hollow place where children played, and to
      Mr. Slade the scene was pure fantasy. The autumnal oaks had
      become transformed into a goblin cave, or a great witch's
      cauldron spewing up flames and smoke, but the voices that
      came from it were those of children and not of hags. Dr.
      Richmond paused on the steep path, and Mr. Slade paused
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty, isn't it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond nodded. He had left his tophat at home, and
      was wearing a double-peaked shooting-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange business, Mr. Slade. Fanatics plot to blow up our
      sacred parliament, and we turn the devilry into a
      children's festival!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, doctor, what could be better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ultimate wisdom, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As in the Great Book, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      A rocket rushed heavenwards, and burst into green and red
      stars. Dr. Richmond watched it, and then walked on, but Mr.
      Slade remained on the path like the genius loci presiding
      over some mysterious ritual. That rocket had ushered in
      this children's festival. Squibs popped, crackers jumped
      about, Roman Candles shot up their coloured balls. The
      hollow under the oak trees became a fantastic place
      bubbling with childish voices. Little figures danced about,
      waving golden rain, or dodging the crackers that hopped and
      snapped about their legs. The flare of the fire lit up the
      playground and spread among the trees. The oak leaves
      glowed, and Mr. Slade stood and smiled at the scene. He
      could distinguish the figures of Dr. Richmond and his son
      sharing in the orgy, and by the high seat, where two oaks
      grew close together, Mrs. Richmond and her friends were
      gathered. Mr. Slade, remembering the crackers in his
      pocket, was moved to descend into that glowing, goblin
      ground, and play like a child with the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to a turn in the spirals of the path where that
      particular seat stood in a recess. A ray of light from the
      fire pointed an almost accusing finger at it, but the two
      young people on the seat were engulfed in each other. The
      embrace was mutual and complete. The girl was lying back in
      the man's arms, and he was bending over her so that her
      face was hidden. They were kissing, and the kiss seemed to
      go on for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood very still. He knew--somehow--without
      asking himself the question, who this girl was who was
      being kissed. His daughter. James Slade felt shocked by the
      utterness of her surrender, and by the possessive and
      smothering passion of the male. There could be sacrilege in
      sex, as well as in beauty. Was it Charles Richmond? He
      would have been comforted a little if it had been Charles,
      but Mr. Slade looked down into the playground and saw
      Charles there, hurling squibs up into the oak trees where
      they hissed and exploded like fiery snakes. Oh, what a
      pity! What pain! What fear! But what could he do about it?
      Nothing. He felt like some shameful sneak spying upon these
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hurried on down the path, and glancing fearfully
      at the two interlocked figures realised that he was neither
      seen nor heard. He was no more than a shrinking ghost
      drifting past that human scene. Young Hallard, of course!
      If by uttering some magic invocation he could have put back
      the clock ten years, and made of her a child again?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade found himself in that fire-lit space, hiding
      himself behind the trunk of an oak tree. His right hand was
      still in his pocket, and clutching its packet of Chinese
      crackers. They were dead things, with no heart to skip and
      chatter, and Mr. Slade withdrew his hand. The child in him
      was dumb. His little white face was like some growth
      attached to the trunk of the tree. No one saw him. He did
      not want to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fireworks and masked faces! Even the children had become
      small goblins. Charles Richmond, still throwing squibs, had
      put on a grotesque mask with a barbaric moustache. Dr.
      Richmond was pinning Catherine Wheels to a tree and setting
      them spinning. Little wheels of fire. Why had it all become
      sinister? The remnants of the Guy were still
      distinguishable in the heart of the fire. James Slade
      shivered. Human sacrifice! Pagan rites! These huge,
      fantastic trees stretching out menacing hands. Yes, human
      sacrifice! And what was he but a poor, trembling,
      hysterical old fool!
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      The fire was dying down, the fireworks were finished. Dr.
      Richmond and his wife were shepherding the children up the
      steep path to the terrace above. One figure remained, that
      of Charlie Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father had said, "Better stay and see the fire out,
      Charles. Here is the key of the gate if Lovejohn has locked
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Slade, still hiding behind his trees, had observed
      in Charlie Richmond a restlessness that had betrayed some
      thwarted expectation. This young man, even while throwing
      his squibs, had turned his face continually towards the
      place where the path flowed into the playground. Charles
      Richmond had been expecting somebody and she had not come,
      and now that he was alone under the trees his figure
      expressed the frustration he was feeling. He walked round
      and round the fire. He kicked burning fragments of it back
      into the glowing heap. He stood and stared at it, his hands
      stuffed into his pockets. He was youth angry and alone,
      angry with himself, angry with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade understood it all. But what was he to do? Venture
      out into the firelight and play father and friend, or
      remain in the outer darkness? Would youth in its anger and
      its jealousy welcome human interference? Mr. Slade was in a
      quandary. He saw himself locked up in the garden for the
      night if the surly Lovejohn had departed from the post of
      duty, and Charles Richmond were to let himself out alone
      with the paternal key. The gardens were surrounded by high,
      spiked railings, and Mr. Slade did not welcome the prospect
      of trying to climb them. He might suffer, not only in his
      heart, but also in his pants!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was still hesitant behind his tree when he heard
      the voice. It seemed to come from above, and the dark
      smother of holly bushes. It was a young man's voice, and it
      shocked Mr. Slade into remembering the two lovers on the
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Richmond, you might lend--us--your key."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade saw Charles Richmond swing round, head up, as
      though someone had flung a stone at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What key?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The key of the gate. That fool Lovejohn has gone off and
      left it locked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the joke's against you, Hallard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a young ass. I want to take Rose home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The insolent voice drawled out the provocation. Mr. Slade
      saw Charles pull his hands out of his pockets. He appeared
      to have forgotten that he was still wearing that ridiculous
      mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can whistle for it, Hallard. If Rose wants to go home,
      I'll do the letting out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, will you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallard's voice was nearer now, and Mr. Slade could see him
      standing in the opening of the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pass over that key, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a darned little fool. And I'd take that silly
      other face off. It's not impressive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles did not move, but waited--in silence--with his back
      to the dying fire. So these two young stags confronted the
      mutual challenge, and Mr. Slade remained as the perplexed
      spectator behind his tree. Ought he to intervene? He did
      not want to intervene, provided that the lad he favoured
      would not take a licking. Mr. Slade was an excited and
      quivering mass of prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, hand over that key."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and get it," said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Hallard walked slowly and deliberately towards the
      figure by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice sort of cheap cad, aren't you, Richmond."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just beastly jealousy. No consideration for--the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles said never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to hand over that key?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were within two yards of each other now. Charles put
      up a hand, pulled off the mask, tossed it into the fire,
      and then with a silent suddenness stepped in and hit.
      Hallard's hands went up, but not with sufficient quickness.
      The swinging blow caught him on the mouth, and floored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was up like an uncoiling spring, and the fight was on.
      He was taller than Charles but not so stocky or so heavy.
      Moreover, Charles was boxing for his Hospital, and was
      hitting with savage exultation. Here was the fellow he had
      dreamed of smashing asking to be smashed. It was a
      whirlwind affair, neither lad trying to block blows or to
      cover up. They just slogged each other, and Mr. Slade grew
      so excited that he came out from behind his tree, and
      bobbed up and down like a shadow boxer. He wanted to shout,
      "Go it, Charles. Hit him. Good lad, that was a beauty! Go
      on, give him another like that. Yoiks--give him socks." But
      Mr. Slade did not indulge in such actual and vulgar
      shouting, though his own fists were up and delivering
      little shadow-dabs at the empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallard was down again, but not finished with. Half rising
      he dived at Charles's legs and threw him. They were on the
      ground together in a wild tangle, rolling over and over,
      and dangerously near the fire. Mr. Slade had emerged from
      his cover of darkness. Was it not time for him to
      intervene? And who was uppermost? He was near enough to see
      that it was Charles, riding a pinned and squirming Hallard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get off me, damn you. Can't you see I'm down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much so," said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hallard conceit was squirming savagely, the rage of the
      great unlicked. The under-lad writhed and struggled, but
      Charles held him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No good, Hallard, better stay put. I'll let you up when I
      feel like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was exulting, but his exultation was to be
      short-lived. That other figure came gliding out of the
      shadows, and the intervention was not to be James Slade's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You beast, let him get up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You beastly bully, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade slid back again into the shadows. Well, well,
      well! You never knew how a woman would take a thing, salute
      the victor, or rescue the vanquished. Mr. Slade was
      shocked. His daughter's compassion was for the cad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Charles get on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Rose. You can take him home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallard was up, dishevelled, and darkly furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hit me before my fists were up. Now then, Richmond,
      come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rose would have none of it. She pushed in between them,
      her hands on Hallard's chest, her face turned to Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me the key."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles looked at her, hesitated, and then felt in his
      pocket. He handed the key to Rose without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll leave it in the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles nodded at her. Head up, she linked an arm in
      Hallard's, and drew him away towards the dark path.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hallard had a bloody face, and yet she let him kiss her,
      for in kissing her his self-love shed some of its angry
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better let me wait for him here, Rose. I haven't finished
      with him yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't have it. Let me look at your poor face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hit me before I was ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. Let me look."
    </p>
    <p>
      A street-lamp stood near the gate, and by its light she
      looked at his face. There was a trickle of blood from one
      nostril, and the right eye was closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He--has--hurt you. Give me your handkerchief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother, darling. I expect his face isn't exactly
      lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He let her take his handkerchief and wipe some of the blood
      away. His vanity sucked up her compassion, and was assuaged
      by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ministering angel, what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That which hurts you, darling, hurts me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it. I must kiss you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her, and then gently she pushed him through the
      gate. That wretch--Charles--might appear, and another scene
      be staged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do go home, Hector. You must do something for that poor
      eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raw beefsteak is the orthodox remedy, I believe. Rather
      crude. I prefer cold water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, I promised to leave the key for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't it be rather a joke to lock him in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I promised."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mr. Slade nor Charles Richmond were worrying about
      keys. Charles was walking grimly round and round the fire,
      and Mr. Slade was watching him. Poor Charles! How the young
      took things to heart! Anger, and anguish, and frustration!
      Nor was Mr. Slade feeling exactly happy, or a dispassionate
      spectator of this tragi-comedy. What was it, after all, but
      just two lads coming to blows about a girl? No, it was so
      much more than that, especially so to Mr. Slade. Oh, the
      illusions of youth! If Charles had been the one to be
      licked, would Rose's role of compassionate intervener been
      reversed? Possibly, possibly not. Damn it, how could you
      tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what was he going to do about it? If he let Charles
      go, he--James Slade--would have to risk a scramble over
      those confounded railings. Mr. Slade leaned against his
      tree with one arm round it, and his cheek pressed against
      the bark. Almost he seemed to be consulting the tree, and
      appealing to the stout oak to advise him. Maybe its tough
      silence gave him his inspiration. "Mum's the word, old man.
      Explanations can be the devil." So Mr. Slade slunk
      backwards into the darkness and scuttled off like a
      familiar spirit. He knew all the paths in Caroline Gardens,
      and, coming to one that joined the main path higher up, he
      turned down it, and arrived as the belated guest in the
      empty playground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Mr. Charles, everything over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw young Richmond swing round and stand silhouetted
      against the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Afraid I have missed all the fun. Couldn't empty the
      shop in time. Everything go off well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A. 1."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid. No fizzles among the fireworks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Richmond's voice was steady. He stood there, head
      up, with his hands in his pockets, and his back to the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the kids enjoyed it. The pater was here
      specialising in Catherine Wheels. And old Miss Megson got a
      cracker up her petticoats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles laughed. It was not a very hearty laugh, but it was
      laughter, and Mr. Slade was glad. "Good lad," he thought,
      "that's the way to take it. No whimpering. God in Heaven,
      why must my girl be such a dear sweet fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was feeling in his pocket, and he rediscovered
      the packet of Chinese crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, if I haven't a packet of my own! No use taking
      them home, is it, Mr. Charles? I should like to let off a
      cracker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly good idea," said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's halve them. Got any matches left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on--then."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in silence and with peculiar gravity, Charles and Mr.
      Slade set those crackers alight and watched them skip and
      detonate about the playground. One of them, Mr. Slade's
      last effort, took a leap into the dying fire and expired
      there with a final and suggestive snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade seemed to be struck by this haphazard and
      whimsical finale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that, Mr. Charles? It goes to show that you never
      quite know how a Chinese cracker or a woman are going to
      jump."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles gave him a quick, searching look, but Mr. Slade was
      gazing intently at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And neither a cracker nor a woman may jump the same
      way--twice. Which is--hopeful, and keeps one guessing. By
      the way, I hope you've got a key. Gentleman Lovejohn was in
      a rather peevish mood. I don't like climbing railings at my
      age."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, Charles Richmond laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There should be a key in the gate, Mr. Slade. Besides, you
      got in all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I did. Silly old ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, if the gate was locked, I'd shin over and find a
      key for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you indeed," said Mr. Slade, "but dash it all--I've
      just remembered, I've got a key. And there are keys to
      other things besides gates."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a23" id="a23">XXIII</a>

    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Had Mr. Slade cast himself for the part of the amiable
      idiot or the simple old pantaloon, his daily disguise could
      not have been more practical. He was an old fellow with a
      white head and a happy smile, who consorted with children
      and sold them toys, and was Southfleet's Father Christmas.
      Even that lovely person, Mrs. Richmond, might have suffered
      from the illusion that James Slade was one of those saintly
      creatures without guile, yet Mr. Slade was cultivating the
      wisdom of the serpent, who, if he so pleased, could conceal
      poison under his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, a very particular purpose was taking root and growing
      in James Slade. Maybe he was a sentimentalist--maybe he was
      not. If there was one thing left to him that was worth
      while, it was the ultimate happiness of a particular
      person, and her happiness was in peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," thought Mr. Slade, "there are other forms of
      seduction than those recorded in romance. The whole of life
      may be a seduction, if the Serpent and Eve are left alone
      together. Am I being an old ass, and postulating the wicked
      Squire and the village maiden and the mercenary mother? I
      am not. Clara cannot help being Clara, but I can help her
      not to be Clara to our child."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was sly. He seemed to know that by praising a
      certain person he might cull from the critical and candid
      mind the hostile comments and the information that he
      needed. So he said to Eliza, "I understand that Miss Rose
      has a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza snorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I were her mother, I'd have more sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Mr. Hallard isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Eliza, I know there has been gossip, but he looks a
      very nice young gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Eliza snorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice young gentleman, indeed! I wouldn't let a girl of
      mine be seen with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade expressed gentle surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he's a rotter, Mr. Slade, and a nasty rotter. You
      ought to remember what the girls said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do remember something, Eliza. But young men will be
      young men, and Miss Rose may steady him down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza gave Mr. Slade a pitying look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not likely. You're much too innocent, Dad. I don't like to
      think of a girl like Miss Rose getting into trouble--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't really mean that, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't I! You go and ask-- No, you couldn't do that,
      could you? But I happen to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza folded her arms over some profound mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Slade, such things are not for the likes of you.
      Well, if you ask me--old Hallard will be forking out five
      bob a week for that young dude--or there'll be trouble.
      Yes, in six months, may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade played the simpleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know what that means, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you wouldn't. You're such a blessed innocent, Mr.
      Slade. But I'll say this, I've often felt minded to tell
      her mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About his carryings on, and what's likely to come of it.
      But, bless you, I don't believe she'd blink an eyelid. Mrs.
      P. wants to be a lady. Have you heard she's got a carriage?
      Just because those there Hallards have got a name, she
      wouldn't smell stinking fish. Not she!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was perplexed and troubled, but not as to his
      ultimate purpose. Eliza's candour had put him in the
      pillory of not knowing how best to conduct his campaign.
      Blurting things out might only worsen the tangle. Of
      course, he could go to Clara and say, "Unless you try to
      stop this business--I'll tell the truth. Rather a clumsy
      confession that! For could he tell the truth? Moreover, the
      ultimate problem was Rose, herself, and her young
      infatuation for this most unpleasant young man. Was not
      love blind? Oh, damnably so! And was there not that saying
      that women fell for Don Juan and saw nothing but stale
      bread in Honest John? Six weeks of silly rapture, and
      then--disillusionment and heartache, and cynicism. The
      filthy falseness of sex sliming everything. Disloyalty,
      deceit, shabby intrigues. No, by the Lord God, his rose
      should not be marred by that maggot!
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was dressing his shop and his windows for
      Christmas, and it was a lovely business, and he was loving
      it in spite of other preoccupations. He was less shy now of
      exhibiting himself in his windows while dressing them, for
      the faces which gathered there were friendly faces. Mr.
      Slade had his audience, little mobs of children who stared
      with innocent covetousness at the toys, and told each other
      which treasure they desired and, since some of them coveted
      the same toy, they would squabble about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade might shake his head at those who were too
      controversial and covetous, but the reproof was softened by
      a smile. Sometimes he would wink at the youngsters. But you
      had to be careful how you pulled grimaces. Some other
      person might suddenly appear and receive a merry flick of
      the eyelid that was intended for the children. So, one
      afternoon, Mr. Slade found himself winking at Miss Megson,
      who, greatly shocked and offended, tossed her bonnet at him
      and walked off head in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear," thought Mr. Slade, "I really must be more
      careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas Tree was a supreme effort. It stood in a
      green tub in the centre of the shop, and who should enter
      when he was climbing on the steps to decorate it but his
      daughter! Mr. Slade sat down suddenly on the top of the
      step-ladder, and spilled two of the glass balls from the
      box he was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Slade, what a pity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The coloured spheres lay smashed at the foot of the ladder.
      <i>Absit omen!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spilt milk, broken eggs, my dear! That comes of being too
      much in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what a lovely tree!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked down at the face of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what a lovely lady!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Slade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade wagged a finger at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told you to snatch the compliment, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But wasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was. Now what can I do for the lovely Miss Pomeroy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovely she looked to him with her pretty colour and her
      dark and dancing eyes, with the little fur shako on her
      head, and other fur caressing her throat. That bright blue
      piece of cloth in the crown of the shako was just as it
      should be, and the thing itself was cocked at a charming
      angle. Mr. Slade's eyes loved her. Damn it, was he going to
      suffer this comely, glowing creature to be played with by
      some raw sensualist?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, what can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, really, Mr. Slade. I just--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just came in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now--that's a real compliment. To the shop, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be such fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, it is. It keeps me as busy as a Jack in the
      Box. Sit down, my dear. I must not neglect my duties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, with the tree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rubbed his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps, but in a particular capacity. You could
      hand me things while I tie them on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face glowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, let me. You do use such wonderful words, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verbal gew-gaws, what! A pompous old pedant on a
      step-ladder."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a lovely little giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go again. Where do we begin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade held out the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better take charge of these pretty-pretties before I break
      any more. You see, each has a little hook-thing. A loop of
      thread, and there you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the thread?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's some on the counter. And a pair of scissors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose took off her gloves and got to work, threading the
      glittering globes and handing them up to Mr. Slade. Mr.
      Slade had to keep moving the step-ladder round the tree,
      and every now and again customers would come into the shop.
      A Mrs. Cumberbatch was one of them, a rather sententious
      and very genteel lady with a face like a horse. Rose had
      mounted the step-ladder and was deputising for her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cumberbatch, who talked at the back of her throat,
      eyed Miss Pomeroy with surprise and vague disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you have a new assistant, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was only too conscious of the secret sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsome is as handsome does, madam. Let me see, what was
      it you wanted. A fur monkey? I'm afraid we haven't such a
      creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cumberbatch exhibited a superfluity of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say anything of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg your pardon, madam, I'm afraid I get a little
      muddled sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said, a doll's tea-service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doll's tea-service, madam. Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lady had departed, Rose looked down and through
      the tree at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you really think she asked for a fur monkey, Mr.
      Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, but she looked like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gave another of her delightful giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are naughty, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I, my dear? Well, after all, this is a fun-shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we hang up next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chinese Lanterns, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Rose who was to decorate the tree with
      Chinese Lanterns. The shop-door opened and Mrs. Pomeroy was
      with them, a Mrs. Pomeroy who shot one dreadful look at
      James Slade and then became a creature of animated and
      condescending charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Rose, my dear, helping to decorate Mr. Slade's tree.
      How--nice and unaffected of you. But, my dear, I've just
      seen a lovely frock at Golightly's. The very thing for you
      to wear at our New Year's dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was all honey and sweet graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how is the shop, Slade? All Noel, I see. Are toys
      selling well? Yes. How nice for you. Come, Rose, my dear.
      We must not miss that frock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gave her mother one dark-eyed and diagnostic stare,
      and descended from her perch. Did that frock exist or was
      it the sudden product of maternal imagination? Mr. Slade
      stood meekly by. When Clara became the sweet woman you
      might suspect the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing I can show you, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not to-day, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a brittle, blue-eyed smile. Mr. Slade knew
      that smile, and the arctic weather it portended. He opened
      the shop door for Mrs. Pomeroy, and mother and daughter
      passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade closed the door, and stood rubbing his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bribery, my dear Clara, sheer bribery. Now, will the child
      get that frock, or a furious wigging? Coo, as the girls
      say--how you would have liked to spifflicate me. But I
      rather think Rose will get that frock. It is your game to
      be gracious, Clara. The Duchess of Highfield--what? But,
      darn it, I've got the Ace of Hearts up my sleeve."
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Rose had her frock. It was a lovely thing in white and
      cerise, the kind of dream-frock that a girl may covet for
      her first party. Mr. Golightly himself presided over the
      ritual, rubbing his hands, and stalking round and round
      and, in admiring his creation, flattering both mother and
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming! I do applaud your taste, madam. And--if I may
      say so, your daughter makes the frock look
      even--more--delightful. Yes, a Paris model, madam--Imported
      specially for me by my agents." Mr. Golightly might say
      what he pleased, for both mother and daughter were in a
      mood to be pleased. Even the tired little "Fitter," with a
      mouthful of pins, with whom Rose had retreated into the
      holy of holies, agreed that no alterations were necessary.
      Miss Pomeroy carried the frock to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Golightly bowed them out to the carriage. He was no
      cynic about such a chariot. As a business man he could
      admire Mrs. Pomeroy and her social successes, while feeling
      that she had accomplished what was beyond him. Mr.
      Golightly might be Zeus among the tradesmen, but Mrs.
      Pomeroy was erecting her throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage carried them to Highfield, where the tea-tray
      was waiting before the fire. Mrs. Pomeroy stood unfastening
      her fur coat. She was looking jocund and gracious, and
      suddenly Rose kissed her mother. Somehow, since coming to
      Highfield, her mother had seemed different.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear--to give me that frock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost Mrs. Pomeroy looked coy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know of--someone--who will be terribly taken by
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy pinched her daughter's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know--as well as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had James Slade been concealed behind one of the new velvet
      curtains or the red plush portiere, he might have become
      less confident about his being in possession of the Ace of
      Hearts. Rose's feeling about her mother was actual. Mrs.
      Pomeroy looked handsomer, plumper, happier. In shedding the
      hotel and its eternal and trivial worries she seemed to
      have cast a habit of hard and brittle fussiness. She was
      more serene, and sat more solidly and comfortably in her
      chair, for life was blessing her beyond her expectations.
      Southfleet, the Southfleet that mattered, was accepting
      her; those precious pieces of pasteboard were preserved in
      a china dish on the drawing-room table. She liked to pick
      them up and gloat over them. Hereward Hallard, John Gage,
      Laurence Huskinson, Montague Emery, and their ladies. Mrs.
      Pomeroy did not trouble to reflect that a certain cynical
      inspiration might flavour these courtesies. The old woman
      had money, the old woman might give good dinners, she
      possessed a billiard-table, she even had looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were hot buttered buns for tea. Highfield was all
      buttered bun to Rose. She might be romantic, but she had a
      healthy appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think me a snob, but--I shouldn't--if I were
      you--exhibit yourself--in old Slade's shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose bit into her bun, and looked at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it was just fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, my dear. Just impulse. But there are kinds of fun
      that should be avoided just at present. You see, child, I
      am so jealous--for your happiness. I am sure you know what
      I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose nodded, with her eyes on the hot dish. Should she have
      a second bun? She would. Yes, Highfield was a lovely place
      after the Caroline Hotel. It had a lawn tennis court and a
      billiard table and a carriage, a conservatory, and a
      capacious dining-room which could be converted into a
      ballroom. It was a new world to Mrs. Pomeroy's daughter,
      and a very pleasant world, with new excitements and
      possibilities. Moreover, her mother was so much more
      mellow, almost a fellow conspirator in the pursuit of
      prestige.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I understand, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certain things, darling, may be quite harmless--but
      not--er--tactful. So much more is expected of us--now. I am
      very proud of my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, having enjoyed her second bun, cast an eye upon a
      chocolate cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. We have to think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of our new friends, my dear," and Mrs. Pomeroy gave her
      daughter an arch glance, "and of--someone--who may be more
      than a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gave a little flick of the head and blushed, not for
      her appetite, but in the cause of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I don't want to do anything--which--he might not
      like."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade had a heavenly Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza might have called it "A hell of a Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christians Awake" indeed! Eliza, stealing up the stairs on
      Christmas morning, heard Mr. Slade still snoring at nine
      o'clock. Well, let him snore, bless him, and for just as
      long as he pleased. She retreated, but the stairs were
      ungentlemanly; they complained of her weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drat you, why can't y' be sporty. Next, you'll be saying I
      have flat feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade slept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a week of delirium. His success had
      submerged him, enslaved him. He had been mobbed by mothers
      and aunts and children. Never had so much of Southfleet
      wanted so many toys. "How much is this, Mr. Slade?" "I'll
      take these two boxes." "No--I'm afraid that is not my
      parcel. It belongs to that lady." "I'm afraid you have
      given me too much change, Mr. Slade." He had become
      smothered up to the hilt. He had perspired. He had
      stuttered. But all the time he had smiled, and enjoyed it,
      and made a joke of his own bewilderment. Maybe some
      children of the baser sort had got out of the shop with
      toys that had not been paid for. His fingers had become
      quite sore and semi-paralytic with tying up parcels. He had
      fumbled and fussed and apologised. He had waded knee deep
      behind the counter in discarded boxes, or so it had seemed
      to him. Time had ceased; space had become non-existent.
      Faces, faces, faces; mouths making sounds at him. He had
      run out of change, and had had to send Eliza to the bank
      for it. Eliza had been dragged in to help in the tumult,
      but Eliza also had asked questions. For three days Mr.
      Slade's dinner had been gulped and masticated between
      dashes into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day Mrs. Eliza had put her foot down, locked
      the shop door at one o'clock and pocketed the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down and have your dinner, Mr. Slade. Let 'em'
      ring and fumble at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a week! What a gorgeous, perspiring, feet-aching week!
      Mr. Slade slept on. He woke at half-past nine, and looked
      at the clock beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past nine! Ye Gods and little fishes! He blundered out
      of bed, and called down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza, my shaving water. Quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the hurry?" said the voice. "You take it easy, Mr.
      Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Eliza, I have to be in church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a sidesman, and I've got to go round with a plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lor, Mr. Slade a sidesman! Well, why not? Why bloody well
      not? It was a rheumaticky morning for Eliza, and she
      reverted to the forcefulness of her male relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have your breakfast ready by ten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, and Eliza, there's a present for you on the
      sitting-room table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was both mollified and provoked, a strange emotional
      combination. She went in to collect her parcel, and undid
      it on the kitchen table. A pair of warm gloves, and two
      lace aprons! When a gentleman gave a lady a pair of gloves,
      didn't it mean--? But, lawks, there were the aprons! She
      would always be an apron creature, and Mr. Slade was
      growing wings and fluttering higher and higher above
      aprons. Eliza sighed, and cut Mr. Slade two nice rashers of
      bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been another of the week's sensations. Mr.
      Golightly had called after hours and been closeted with Mr.
      Slade in his sitting-room. Mr. Golightly was a
      churchwarden, and a most perfect and urbane specimen. He
      had announced to Mr. Slade that he and the Vicar and the
      Vicar's warden had agreed that Mr. Slade was the very
      person to take Mr. Carbutt's place as a sidesman. Mr.
      Carbutt had passed over. Mr. Slade had accepted the honour.
      Almost he had felt that he was being presented with a halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most kind of you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, old man. You ought to do well with the plate.
      We gave up bags two years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bags?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, too tempting to the thrifty. A penny and a half-crown
      make the same noise in a bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, full of hot coffee and bacon and eggs, walked
      briskly down the broad way between the tall hollies. His
      feet still ached a little, but his heart not at all so.
      Christmas morning, and the sun shining, and a silvering of
      frost lying on the grass. Red berries on the hollies. Other
      people wished him good morning and a happy Christmas. Mr.
      Slade was sporting a new pair of gloves. He was nearing the
      porch when the Highfield carriage followed upon his heels.
      Mr. Slade stepped aside for the gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy and Rose! Mr. Slade raised his hat, but Clara
      did not appear to see him. His daughter gave him a curt
      smile and a formal little nod. Mr. Slade waited for these
      new carriage folk to enter the church before him, but
      Rose's Christmas salutation was not what he would have
      wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was making for his familiar seat, when the verger
      waylaid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not there, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take the south aisle. Where Mr. Carbutt sat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade surrendered. Authority had told him to go up
      higher, and he could not enter into a controversy--even in
      whispers--on Christmas Day. Mr. Carbutt's seat was a corner
      one half-way up the south aisle. Mr. Slade slipped into it,
      and was about to kneel when the verger pushed something at
      him, an oak plate lined with red velvet. Mr. Slade did not
      appear to know what to do with it. He deposited it under
      the seat with his hat. He prayed, he sat, he stood. He
      could glance across to the Pomeroy pew, where the new
      gentry had joined the elect. Clara, too, had gone up
      higher. Mr. Slade contemplated his daughter's pretty head.
      Was it being turned? Oh, possibly! The Hallards were not
      present, but Charles Richmond stood beside his mother on
      the other side of the aisle. He may have glanced at Rose,
      but Rose's eyes were not for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole church sang. Mr. Slade sang, and while he sang he
      prayed. "Oh, God, give my child wisdom. Teach her to love
      as she should love. Save her from that snobbery which
      chills the heart. Let unhappiness and disillusionment be
      far from her." But a sudden sadness fell upon James Slade.
      Some premonition of what was to happen seemed to steal upon
      his spirit. Love could be so clear-sighted and it could be
      so blind. And more perilous than either was when it looked
      at life through golden glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark The Herald Angels Sing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade went round with his plate--to music. He had
      fertilised the offertory with a shilling. Then, he gathered
      with Messrs. Gage, Golightly and Beckwith under the
      gallery, and marched gravely up the central aisle to
      present the offerings to Mr. Chatterway. Mrs. Pomeroy,
      observing him in that procession, gave the back of him a
      rigid stare. She was not pleased. Now, what was the
      significance of James Slade's promotion among the elect?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade walked back down the aisle. He did not look at
      Clara or at his daughter, and neither of them looked at
      him.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Eliza gave Mr. Slade roast beef, etc., and plum pudding
      with custard for his Christmas dinner. Mr. Slade sat down
      to it alone, and in being alone he was conscious of
      depression. How many millions of people were eating roast
      beef or turkey and Christmas pudding at this same hour, and
      not eating it in solitude. He supposed that at Highfield
      Clara and Rose were honouring the same gastronomic ritual,
      or did Highfield dine at half-past seven? Clara appeared to
      be attaining her ambition, and Mr. Slade, trying to eat his
      meal with relish and without insult to Eliza, found himself
      realising that Highfield House was very far removed from
      the Caroline Hotel. Clara had driven to church behind a
      pair of greys; Clara had not managed to see him; his
      daughter's smile had been shallow and perfunctory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, well! Was it not obvious that he would be
      nothing but an obscure little shopkeeper so far as Clara
      and Rose were concerned, and that both he and Clara were
      locked up in the same fateful silence. Clara was clever,
      much too clever. Oh, damn Clara. Why had she imposed this
      almost fantastic penance upon him? Just implacable
      vindictiveness? Did she regret it? Probably. But she was
      counting upon both the shameful past and the sentimental
      future to close his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot destroy your daughter's happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not, but was Rose going to be happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade ate his pudding and felt it lying heavy on his
      stomach. He was tired. Eliza had put oranges and nuts on
      the sideboard. No, nuts would make indigestion inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, and Eliza came to clear away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoyed your dinner, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade rose against his melancholy. Good service
      demanded its salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a lovely dinner, Eliza. What a cook you are! Now
      you go and enjoy yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Eliza sat down to a solitary meal. What a pity that
      two elderly people could not have enjoyed it together!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put his feet up, and fell asleep, but uneasily
      so, for other and mysterious meat lay heavy on the stomach
      of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the kitchen Eliza ate solemnly and in solitude. She
      glanced up at the gas-bracket. She had hung a piece of
      mistletoe there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly old fool," said Eliza to Eliza.

      Clara Pomeroy had considered her attitude to the past, the
      present and the future, and it must be confessed that for
      so solid and formidable a woman her posing was not
      unsubtle. She had to placate people who insisted upon
      prestige, and if she had to bribe them into accepting her,
      the thing had to be done with some grace and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose to assume certain social privileges, while
      shrugging her fine shoulders, and giving her audience a
      confidential smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her crest and its motto painted upon the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Aut vincere aut mori."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Her coachman carried a cockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was a Pomeroy, and could claim her descent from
      that West Country family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could rally herself and her friends on the joke of the
      Caroline Hotel. Life was droll, was it not? A Pomeroy
      recovering her social status--financially--by running an
      hotel! To conquer or die! She had conquered and she was not
      dead, but once more a Pomeroy, a notable woman who had
      nailed her colours to the mast, and now could display them
      more comfortably from the admiral's flagstaff in the
      Highfield grounds. Even the Pomeroy garden had become
      "Grounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereward Hallard, Esq., that lean and disillusioned old
      cynic, was persuaded to chuckle with her over her flouting
      of fate. Old Hereward, having been married for some forty
      years to a pale and vapourish wife, liked his women bold,
      buxom, and well-coloured. He found himself flirting with
      Mr. Pomeroy, for Clara had blossomed into a new jocundity
      since the transplantation to Highfield. Hereward Hallard
      remembered the chorus-girl days of his youth, and Mrs.
      Pomeroy's handsome, high-bosomed vitality was blonde to his
      fancy. Moreover, Mrs. Pomeroy could take a joke, and listen
      to a naughty story and make eyes, while pretending to be
      shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you naughty man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She would pretend to suppress succulent laughter. Yes, Mrs.
      Pomeroy was fun, and not like poor Edith, who whimpered and
      waggled through life, and was so refined that she was
      shocked into migraine if her husband said "Damn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, old Hallard approved of the daughter. Rose was a
      pretty thing, the best looker in Southfleet, and if young
      Hector wanted her, why not? The Hallard finances were lean,
      and the Pomeroy woman had money. Mr. Hereward decided to
      take her at her own estimate, and to emphasise the cockade
      and the crest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A damned plucky woman, sir. Not ashamed to get down to
      hard tacks and bring the business off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara's invitations had gone out for a house-warming, a
      dance early in the new year. The invitation to the Hallards
      set poor Edith rustling and shaking like an aspen. To her
      Mrs. Pomeroy was a vulgar person. All vigour was vulgar to
      poor Edith. As for dear Hector's infatuation it seemed to
      her quite deplorable. Just a pretty face. No, she could not
      countenance a Pomeroy party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was contemptuous and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be silly, woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not being silly, Hereward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what are you being?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm--being--a gentlewoman and a mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The quintescence of refinement, what! I suppose you would
      like the lad to marry that strumous little Lakin wench, or
      the Gridley girl--with a face like a pig."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be so vulgar, Hereward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bosh, my dear, it is just a matter of common sense.
      Whenever Hector has looked at a girl you have always
      started a headache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are unkind, Hereward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dash it, try your smelling salts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, I do feel so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go on feeling so, Edith, but you will accept that
      invitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hallard accepted it, but she did not go to Highfield
      House. Instead, she went to bed with a headache and a
      bottle of bromide.

      The Richmonds were contending with a sudden strange shyness
      in their son. Shy of work he was not, but shy of social
      affairs he was. Mrs. Pomeroy's party was to be a young
      party, with certain notable exceptions, and an invitation
      had gone to Mr. Charles Richmond. Rose had marked Charles's
      name on her mother's list of invitations and had questioned
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must we ask young Richmond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear. We are rather short of young men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's such an oaf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles may be a little gauche, but he does admire you, I
      think! Besides, my dear, competition is provocative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, just as you like, but I won't dance with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Richmond, on his part, was unwilling to accept the
      invitation. He did not dance, and he would not dance, and
      he abominated parties. His mother and his father exchanged
      understanding glances. If their son was being difficult,
      there might be secret frustrations to account for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was about to say that Charles must get over
      such prejudices, and that the social graces were good for
      the practice, but something in his wife's eyes prevented
      him from saying it. There were certain forms of
      sensitiveness that should not be coerced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Charles; do as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother smiled at them both. She knew very well why her
      son was shy of Highfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Southfleet, the Southfleet that was supposed to matter,
      heard all about Mrs. Pomeroy's party. There was to be a
      sit-down supper, with champagne, and the catering was
      assigned to Messrs. Barron and Son. Mr. Stack, who was both
      a furniture-remover and an undertaker, was engaged to
      prepare the hall and the drawing-room for the dance. Mr.
      Stack had buried the Admiral, but this was to be a gayer
      occasion. The band was to come from London. Quite a number
      of young ladies were taken to Mr. Golightly by their
      mothers to be decorated for this happy occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza, who was a great gatherer of Southfleet gossip,
      passed on all the news to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Setting a mouse-trap, I call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why mouse-trap, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why! All the town knows she's after young Hallard. Well,
      if I had a daughter I wouldn't work her off on that nasty
      young toff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade felt sad about it. Eliza might be right, and
      orange blossoms be persuaded to bloom in a bath of
      champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Year brought snow, four inches of it, and
      Southfleet pier looked like a great white caterpillar
      crawling out to sea on black legs. Doorsteps and pavements
      had to be swept, and Mr. Slade was sweeping his when
      Charles Richmond happened by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. Home for the holidays?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a week or two. Do you stock skates, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm afraid I don't, sir. I think you could get them at
      Gossets."
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty broom other than Mr. Slade's had swept the sky.
      Frost at night, and star glitter, and the moon rising upon
      a white world. It was cold in the shop, and Mr. Slade
      bought himself an oil stove and a pair of mittens. Eliza
      gave him a stone hot-water bottle wrapped in flannel in his
      bed at night. A hot bottle might be more significant than
      mistletoe Trade rested after the rush of Christmas, and Mr.
      Slade, checking stock and his accounts, found that he had
      made a profit of thirty-three pounds one shilling and
      ninepence during the Christmas week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up for three nights straightening out his accounts,
      and writing out new orders to replace the goods he had
      sold, but the fourth night was the night of the Highfield
      party, and a sudden restlessness descended upon James
      Slade. He put on his heavy boots, an overcoat and a
      muffler, and, leaving Eliza sitting by the kitchen fire,
      went out to stretch his legs and his curiosity. He walked
      down the High Street and along Caroline Terrace to the
      Cliff Road. The moon seemed to lure him westward. It was
      shining above the trees and the tourelles of Highfield
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriages and cabs passed Mr. Slade, with their yellow eyes
      set towards Highfield. He could suppose that this was a
      very great occasion for Clara, a festival inaugurating the
      new regime, while he was a little, obscure outsider, remote
      even from his own child. He would like to have seen Rose in
      her party frock. Three or four carriages were waiting their
      turn to unload their young merchandise at the porch, and
      the gardener was on duty at the gate to regulate their
      coming and their going. Mrs. Pomeroy's coachman opened
      carriage doors. The snow had been spaded away from the path
      into a white bank two feet deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood beside the gate. The gardener carried a
      lantern and shone its light upon the entrance to help the
      drivers. Mr. Slade had a glimpse of dim young faces behind
      carriage windows. It occurred to him to wonder whether Mr.
      Charles Richmond was to be one of the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade loitered there until the last of the carriages
      had come and gone. A faint sound of music, a Strauss waltz,
      drifted out to him. Yes, he could remember dancing that
      waltz with Clara. How distant were those days! What a
      sensation he could cause now were he to glide into the
      house like a ghost, and, appearing in the crowded room,
      claim his wife and daughter! And how unwelcome he might be
      to both!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, feeling rather like a ghost, was about to fade
      away when he realised that he was not alone. A figure had
      arrived at the gate on foot. It stood there hesitant,
      looking in. Mr. Slade was partly concealed by one of the
      brick gate pillars and the overhang of a snow-laden laurel.
      Moreover, the moon was shining in the young man's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Richmond!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade held his breath. This young man's anguish of
      indecision was that of the eternal lover afraid of the
      thing he loved. Yes, and more than that. Maybe Charles
      feared to see that other lad in possession of the creature
      he desired. Well, why not dare it, and put your jealousy in
      blinkers? Mr. Slade stood pressing close to the pillar,
      willing that hesitant figure to go forward, pangs or no
      pangs. He saw Charles Richmond walk in and disappear, and
      Mr. Slade gave thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good lad, go to it. Faint heart never--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not to be. Charles Richmond reappeared, his back
      to the moonlight and romance. Almost blindly he walked
      straight into the piled up bank of snow, and pitched
      forward over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" was his one exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sadly echoed that damn.

    <p>
      At three o'clock in the morning Mrs. Pomeroy was sitting by
      her bedroom fire, tired yet complacent, for the party had
      been all that she hoped that it would be. She was brushing
      her fine hair, and wondering just what had happened that
      evening, for a radiant Rose had provoked her mother's
      hopes. She had had the young men about her, and
      particularly the one whom Mrs. Pomeroy coveted as a
      son-in-law. Rose had danced five times with Hector Hallard.
      She had sat out with him after supper in the conservatory.
      Mrs. Pomeroy had been careful to keep the romance under
      interested observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the show was over a flushed and excited Rose had
      kissed her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoyed yourself, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, ever so much," and Rose had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what had been the significance of her daughter's
      impetuous confusion and sudden flight? Was Rose hiding her
      ecstatic secret and exulting over it in secret, just
      because it was hers? Mrs. Pomeroy could understand the
      holding of some precious piece of jewellery in the hollow
      of the hand, while you gloated over it, and closed jealous
      fingers over it, as though the thing was too precious for
      the moment to be revealed to other eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Came a knock at Mrs. Pomeroy's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you awake, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear; come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was very much undressed, and so were her emotions.
      What pretty legs the child had, and what luscious hair!
      Mrs. Pomeroy's hairbrush remained poised; she might have
      been Juno in a tableau vivant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose rushed at her mother, knelt, clasped her, and turned
      up that flushed face to be kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't want to tell anybody to-night. It was so
      wonderful. And then--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy patted her daughter's head very gently with
      the back of her brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something happened, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he asked me to marry him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was savouring and enjoying the confession.
      Surely, it behoved a world-wise mother not to be too
      knowledgeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, Hector!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Oh, I'm so happy. I couldn't go to bed--after
      all--without telling you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling, I'm so glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy embraced and kissed her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it wonderful, mother! Of course, we shan't be
      married for a long time. Hector has to take his degree."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was quite playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I shan't lose my darling poppet all at once. I suppose
      dear Hector--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks he may go on the Stock Exchange. He's so clever
      about money. Of course, as he says, it is not quite what a
      gentleman might wish for, but you see poor old Mr. Hallard
      had lost a lot of money owing to the depression in
      farming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Stock Exchange can be quite--gentlemanly, dear, and
      so--lucrative when a young man has influence and brains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Hector says. Sir Bertie Hallard is an uncle of his, and
      quite distinguished in the City."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was Lord Mayor, I think, a few years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector himself would have preferred the Diplomatic
      Service, but, as he says--beggars aren't choosers. He's so
      good about it, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure he is, darling. And does Mr. Hereward know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector was going to tell him at once. And he wants to come
      and see you to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right and proper, darling! I shall be delighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy slept excellently upon such news, Rose less
      so, and both of them breakfasted in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter sun rose upon snow and this virginal romance,
      and upon a very complacent Clara, for Mrs. Pomeroy had
      drunk but one glass of her own champagne, though the wine
      seemed to have done the trick with Hector. If her daughter
      was silly with sex, Mrs. Pomeroy was shrewdly silly in her
      social escapades. Would these two gentlemen honour their
      bond on the morning after? Had Clara seen Mrs. Hallard in
      bed, weeping and whimpering while her husband shaved
      himself and administered to her drafts of dry sarcasm, Mrs.
      Pomeroy would have realised that the Hallard men were out
      to do business with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen called at Highfield House, and together, but
      the interviews were separate and in sequence. Clara
      received Hector in the library, while old Hereward was
      flirtatiously paternal with Rose in the drawing-room.
      Hector's attitude to his future mother-in-law was sleepily
      impudent and whimsical, but politely intimate. He kissed
      Mrs. Pomeroy. He declared himself to be a lucky devil,
      though, of course, the infinite favour was being conferred
      upon Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they changed partners. Rose was taken into Hector's
      lap on the drawing-room sofa, and Mr. Hereward stood
      warming his coat-tails at the library fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam, I think we can congratulate each other on
      this happy event."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad you think so, Mr. Hallard. Rose is a sweet
      child. I don't think I have ever known her out of temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inherited--from her mother, no doubt," said Mr. Hallard
      gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy gave him a loving look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I cannot pretend to be as sweet tempered as Rose.
      Shall we be frank, sir? When will Hector--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallard sucked in his lower lip, a peculiar trick of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lady, I agree. We Hallards have always been a
      little--gay--in--our young days. That is why I am glad of
      this--engagement. It will help Hector to settle down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, lads will be lads," said Mrs. Pomeroy, "but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, with an upward glance at Mr. Hereward. Her blue
      eyes held him to the point at issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes--" and Mr. Hallard waggled his coat-tails. "Hector
      has to finish at the 'Varsity; it is probable that he will
      get his blue. An athletic reputation counts, dear lady, in
      the City. Then, I hope to place him with my cousin, Sir
      Bertie Hallard. An excellent firm. A junior
      partnership--would of course help and expedite matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hereward looked at the toes of his shoes, as though
      some vulgar consideration embarrassed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a question of cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy's smile was steel-bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purchase money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I don't suppose the firm would take him under two
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lot of money, Mr. Hallard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but the prestige--and the immediate career. I am a
      soft-hearted old codger, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy accepted the "Clara," as she might have
      accepted a bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--might--assist--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallard's lean face expressed genial surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? Oh, I was not suggesting-- But very generous of you.
      I might put up--a thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy sat considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see--in two years' time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, about that. I'll get into touch with Sir Bertie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gather that Hector--if he became even a junior
      partner--could count on an income sufficient to enable
      him--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think I might add a thousand to your thousand. I
      shall, of course, allow my daughter a certain sum yearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallard bowed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, you are very generous. My homage to you."
    </p>

      The engagement was announced immediately, and Southfleet
      had a good deal to say on the subject, and much of the
      gossip would not have been pleasing to the ears of Mrs.
      Pomeroy. The most snobbish motives were assigned to her,
      and the most mercenary ones to the Hallards. People like
      the Richmonds were seriously and sincerely shocked, and not
      because their son had failed to find favour with Miss
      Pomeroy. Did not the woman know what sort of reputation
      young Hallard had in Southfleet? The family tradition--so
      far as women were concerned--was absolutely Georgian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles, a rather grim young man, returned to Guys and the
      dissecting-room earlier than was necessary. He was in a
      savage mood, and almost disposed to discover dead illusions
      among corpses. Damn all women! Work was the thing! He sat
      up late in his digs, reading for his next exam, until his
      intimate chipped him about his red eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been crossed in love, Charlie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up," said Charles fiercely, and the particular wag
      discreetly did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough Mr. Slade did not hear the news until he
      read it in the society gossip of the <i>Southfleet
      Argus.</i> "We have much pleasure in announcing the
      engagement of Miss Pomeroy, the only daughter of Mrs.
      Pomeroy of Highfield House, to Mr. Hector Hallard, the son
      of our most respected--etc." Mr. Slade was at breakfast.
      The news upset him. He threw the paper across the table,
      and with such petulance that he upset his tea-cup and made
      a horrid mess on Eliza's clean cloth. Mr. Slade grabbed the
      cup and returned it to its saucer. He sat and stared at the
      stained cloth. Something ought to be done about it.
      Something ought to be done about this other business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and rang the bell for Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Eliza, I've spilt my tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza came heavily upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawks, Mr. Slade, however did you do that? I'll put it
      under the hot tap at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'm rather upset, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about, Dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just something in the paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not about you--surely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not about me. About Miss Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was playing a deft game of chess with the breakfast
      things, moving them to one side of the table, rolling up
      the cloth, and moving them back again. For once Eliza had
      missed a piece of gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not marrying her to that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid she is, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgraceful, I call it! 'uman sacrifice. Why, if I were--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Eliza, I know. I'm afraid part of the trouble is that
      Miss Rose is in love with young Hallard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor innocent! It beats me--girls being such fools about a
      lardy-da gent like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has--looks, you know, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks! My word--if only she knew that he'd been with--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked pleadingly at Eliza. Need the good
      soul--even in her innocence--rub it in so thoroughly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Eliza, I know. But there it is. Perhaps she'll change
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lewd snake is always a snake, Mr. Slade. If he sheds his
      skin it'll only be to show off a nice new one to the next
      girl. He's a bad lot, Dad. He'll make her miserable, that's
      what he'll do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza had completed the rescuing of the stained cloth, and
      Mr. Slade sat contemplating the marmalade pot. He had been
      at the marmalade stage when the thing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish something could be done about it, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eliza's immediate concern was with the stained cloth.
      She marched off with it, and Mr. Slade decided that he did
      not want any marmalade.
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Was interference possible? Was it justifiable? Had any man
      the right to meddle with the emotional problems of his
      neighbour? Yes, but his own daughter? Mr. Slade lit a pipe
      and wandered down into the shop; he could smoke when he
      pleased now, and not like some surreptitious urchin
      enjoying a stolen fag. He walked up and down between the
      counters. Love! Oh, Lord! What a messy business it could
      be! As for trying to give advice at such a time, it was
      like putting your finger into a jampot that was full of
      wasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perched himself on the counter of the petticoat side of
      the shop, and smoked and stared, and swung his feet without
      any consideration for the new paint. He saw without seeing
      boxes of lead soldiers and toy trains, Noah's Arks and tin
      trumpets, toy guns and cricket sets. Mr. Slade got off the
      counter and walked up and down again. He tried the other
      counter. Dolls. His glance fell upon a particular doll, a
      male creature in a sailor suit. Mr. Slade disliked that
      doll. It somehow suggested young Hallard, with its staring,
      sleepy, insolent eyes. Damned little mannikin squatting
      complacently amid the girls! Mr. Slade was conscious of
      sudden poignant exasperation. He got off the counter,
      passed behind the other one, yanked Doll Hector down from
      his shelf, and, holding him by the legs, banged his head
      upon the counter. Doll Hector's head was of china, and it
      broke. One blue-bead eye remained upon the counter. Mr.
      Slade swept it off, and, feeling foolish and guilty,
      returned the corpse to the shelf, a headless thing. There
      would be no more ogling by that damned doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, seriously, what was to be done about it? Could
      anything be done about it? After all, Hector Hallard might
      be a little wild, and the victim of gossip, and no doubt
      the Deity himself might prefer your gallant to your prig.
      The lad could not be rotten physically if he was in the
      running for the Cambridge "Eight," and as for his morals--
      Well, what was morality? Had not he--James Slade--spent
      seven years in--? Kindness was a virtue that counted, a
      compassionate magnanimity which shrank from hurting the
      thing it loved. And Rose loved this young man. Had she no
      right to say "This love is mine. Leave me to care for my
      own garden. I take love in my own hands--for better or for
      worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was perplexed and troubled. There seemed to be no
      one to whom he could appeal for counsel. Had John Truslove
      been alive! But was not the spirit of John Truslove still
      living? You could ask the dead questions, and they might
      answer you, through the living memory that remained with
      you like a familiar and friendly spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did an extraordinary thing. He put on an
      overcoat, boots and hat, and, leaving the shop locked up,
      walked down to the churchyard of St. Johns, and stood
      bare-headed by his dead friend's grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood holding his hat, head bowed, listening for
      some inward voice that might speak to him as the live voice
      of John Truslove might have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing came, and then James Slade asked another question.
      "Am I an old fool, John, listening to tittle-tattle? Is
      there any man or woman in this town who can paint for me a
      fair and dispassionate picture? Someone may know. I need a
      friend, John, to whom I can confess, someone who will keep
      my secret, and give me counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was answered. Mr. Slade's eyes were fixed upon
      John Truslove's head-stone, and suddenly he seemed to see
      upon it a name--"Richmond." It was there and it was not
      there, but it was the name James Slade needed. Dr.
      Richmond! Had not the beloved physician a reputation for
      healing hearts as well as bodies? People took their
      problems to him as well as their ailments, and to many a
      man and many a woman Dr. Richmond had played the
      father-confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put on his hat. Then he took it off again and
      saluted his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, John. That is the man for me, I'll do it."
    </p>
    <h1>
      4
    </h1>
    <p>
      A doctor may have many strange stories told to him, but Dr.
      Richmond had never listened to a story more strange than
      that which Mr. Slade related. The doctor sat on one side of
      his desk, Mr. Slade on the other, nursing his hat with his
      hands folded over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not come as a patient, sir. I have come to make a
      confession to you, and to ask your advice. Are you willing
      to hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was observing this white-headed old child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I will listen. But what advice can I promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be seen, sir. I have come to you because I
      feel that I can trust you. You will keep my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one but John Truslove knew--the truth, and he, sir,
      could keep a secret. May I begin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond bent his head to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have occurred to Dr. Richmond that this
      father-confessor business was the supremest form of
      flattery, if he wished to value his work in the terms of
      crude success. He did not so wish to value it. No man is
      without some vanity, but the husband of Lucy Richmond had
      watched a compassionate sense of humour mellow in himself
      so that he could smile at and over the tricks of his own
      more human ego. Moreover, here was this simple and good old
      soul stripping himself of his social disguise and
      exhibiting to the physician a pathological past. Dr.
      Richmond was not likely to forget that he, too, had
      escaped--by the grace of God and the magnanimity of a
      woman--from the near disaster of a past. Did that matter?
      It did and it did not. Your conscience might be more
      merciful than the tongues of the many, but also it could be
      more ruthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale was told, and Dr. Richmond and Mr. Slade sat
      gravely regarding each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you see, sir, my tongue is tied for ever and ever. And
      now you may be wondering why I am worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is--about your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, sir. I am not happy about this marriage that is to
      be. There is only one person to whom I can make an appeal,
      and then--only in secret. That is my problem. I have a
      weapon that I can never use."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it that you want of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To answer one question, if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try to answer it, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall never go farther. I hope you realise that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will put it this way, sir. If you had a daughter, would
      you be happy in seeing her joined to that young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond's eyes were steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Slade, I should not be happy."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade procrastinated. Some problems have a happy way of
      providing their own solution, but certain incidents
      provoked in Rose's father a new sense of urgency. Eliza had
      a tale to tell, and Mr. Slade was shocked by it, but yet
      another incident stirred in him a feeling of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thaw had come and the world was slush, and, though Mr.
      Slade had swept his piece of pavement, a dirty mess of
      melting snow lay in the gutter. Mr. Slade had his stove
      alight, and his mittens on, when the Highfield carriage
      pulled up outside the shop. Mr. Slade happened to be
      standing at the shop door, and he saw the two ladies
      wearing furs, and nicely wrapped up under a rug of the same
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman turned in his seat to take an order. He
      appeared to have something to say about getting down from
      his box and leaving his horses and seeing Mr. Slade behind
      that panel of glass, he made a beckoning gesture with a
      large, white-gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, you're wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade may not have suffered from too quick a sense of
      personal dignity, but he was provoked by the new and
      exaggerated arrogance of Highfield. So Clara could not get
      out of her carriage to speak to him, but expected the
      shopman to come and stand in the slush while she gave some
      order. Mr. Slade remained recalcitrant behind his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman cracked his whip and pointed to the ladies,
      but Mr. Slade did not respond to whip crackings. Then he
      saw the fur rug turned aside. His daughter emerged and
      crossed the pavement towards him, and, in that moment of
      time, James Slade seemed to see in her a different
      creature, a more sophisticated and stylish young woman
      whose face had ceased to be flowerlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Slade did open the door for her, and waited gravely
      for her message.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Slade, my mother wishes to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slade, indeed! Even her voice was other than it had been,
      or so it seemed to her father. It had gathered affectation,
      an almost nasal quality. Oh, these social insincerities!
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer had gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your mother--unwell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think she might leave her carriage and enter my
      shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Incredible reaction, but his daughter's face betrayed
      pique, her voice hauteur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course, Mr. Slade, if--you wish to stand
      upon--dignity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not upon dignity, but not in that slush."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him no answering smile, and the change in her
      astonished him. He had known her as an impulsive, laughing
      creature, and she had become--just what?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well, Mr. Slade. I will tell my mother that
      you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I dislike slush, my dear. Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      His "my dear" seemed to put her head in air. Familiar old
      fellow! She turned and walked back to the carriage, and her
      very walk was other than it had been. It seemed to
      say--"The beautiful Miss Pomeroy of Highfield House crosses
      the pavement to her carriage." Mr. Slade closed the door of
      his shop. He saw Rose speak to her mother and Clara's sharp
      turn of the head. Rose was told to re-enter the carriage.
      They drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was shocked, yet he could say to himself, "Am I
      being a hypersensitive old fool, and imagining things which
      are not there, or has this child become a supercilious
      little snob? The Rose who had spoken to him as to an
      inferior person was the veritable child of her mother. The
      transfiguration did not seem credible. Why, only a few
      weeks ago this girl had been helping him to dress his
      Christmas Tree, and had called it fun, and had giggled over
      it. Had Highfield and Hallard got into his daughter's
      blood? Yes, it was possible, but how quickly she had been
      infected. The social disease! It might attack you at all
      ages, but especially so in your plastic youth when the self
      is sappy and susceptible. Rose had the measles, an attack
      of genteel affectation, but scarlet-fever and measles could
      have their complications and their after-effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade felt like shrugging his shoulders. Here was the
      one creature in the world whom he had loved in secret and
      plotted to preserve from the illusions of a passionate
      credulity, proving to him that she was not worth his
      interference. Oh, no, he would not admit that. This was but
      a phase, a Hallard interlude. The girl was a little head in
      air, Highfield air. Did he really believe that Clara and a
      young supercilious cad could debauch her? Debauch. What a
      beastly word! And yet it stuck in Mr. Slade's mind.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Once again Mr. Slade was moved to consult the spirit of his
      dead friend, and in doing so he was to be granted a sign
      and a symbol. A February night might not have appeared
      propitious for such a pilgrimage, but St. Valentine's day
      was near, and the dim headstones and crosses guided James
      Slade to John Truslove's grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ought I to do, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to hear the shrewd and humorous voice of his
      friend saying, "Go to it, James. Be not faint-hearted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade replaced his hat, and groped his way back to the
      main gate. The great holly hedges were very black on either
      side of the broad path that led from the Pier Hill to the
      church. Mr. Slade closed the gate very softly, and as he
      did so he heard a particular sound, a girl's protesting
      giggle, and then the sound of a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovers! Well, this quiet path protected by its great hedges
      was a promising place for secret meetings. Mr. Slade stood
      quite still for a moment. He did not wish to be a
      spoil-sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said a girl's voice in an amorous whisper, "You can kiss,
      can't you, Mr. Hector. No, you mustn't do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't--proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proper be-- I can't help being mad about a lovely thing
      like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a little scuffle, and then the
      girl's voice said, "I ought to be getting home--now. Be
      good, sir. I must go--really."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade had recognised the young man's voice, but not
      the girl's. "You can <i>kiss,</i> can't you, Mr. Hector."
      Damned young cad! For Mr. Slade belonged to a generation
      that had refused to recognise man's promiscuity, and could
      hurl the word "Villain" in the best Adelphi manner. He
      stood leaning against the gate, listening to the sudden
      quick footsteps of the girl, as she broke and ran from her
      too impetuous lover. Who was she? Well, did it matter?
      Almost, Mr. Slade had a feeling that God and John Truslove
      had guided him to this place in order that this treachery
      might be revealed to him. The hot blood of youth! Oh, yes,
      one might make excuses, but when a lad had given his pledge
      to a girl like Rose, what human justification could he
      claim for surreptitious sex adventures? Damn it, Rose was
      not a girl to be loved--with reservations. She could and
      should hold all that was in a man in the first flush of
      romantic loving. Charlie Richmond would have given her all
      that was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's fists were clenched. By God, he would like to
      set about this young blackguard. Someone was whistling a
      tune from Gilbert and Sullivan, and Mr. Slade recognised
      it. "In for a penny, in for a pound." So that was the young
      gentleman's philosophy! He heard the sound of footsteps and
      that casual whistling dying away, and his anger and his
      disgust were potent. He knew now what to do. Clara should
      listen to him.

      The staff of Highfield House was not the staff of the
      Caroline Hotel. It was more starched, more elevated, more
      full of manners, and the parlour-maid who opened the door
      to Mr. Slade and allowed the hall light to shine upon him,
      did not add to it the light of her countenance. She beheld
      a rather insignificant-looking old man who--so she
      thought--did not belong to her world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mrs. Pomeroy in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman allowed Mr. Slade into the hall. She did not ask
      him to sit down, but left him standing while she went to
      ask her mistress whether she would see the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A person named Slade, madam, wishing to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy happened to be alone. The young people were in
      the billiard-room where Hector Hallard was giving Rose a
      lesson in the handling of a cue. Mrs. Pomeroy did not wish
      to see Mr. Slade. She would have been well content to hear
      that he had vanished from the earth, but she thought it
      advisable for her to discover why he had called on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send him in, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade entered the Highfield drawing-room carrying his
      hat and wearing his overcoat. The room felt excessively
      warm to him, and he was to feel it to be very excessively
      warm before he left it. Mrs. Pomeroy had a book in her lap.
      She neither closed it nor troubled to lay it aside. Her
      solid serenity seemed adequate for any occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited; she observed him; she left him standing and,
      since his silence seemed to express embarrassment, she
      prompted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Slade, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's silence was not due to embarrassment, but
      rather to the brittle stresses of his crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to speak to you on a very serious matter, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant and angry hardening of her face. Her
      blue eyes menaced him. It was a look that said, "You
      exasperating fool! Why was I such an idiot as to rescue
      you?" She put her book aside. She rose, walked deliberately
      to the door, opened it, saw that the hall was empty, and,
      reclosing the door, stood with her back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was not to be brow-beaten. This--to him--was a
      crusade for the setting free of souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is about Rose--and this engagement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Slade. I don't quite understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was to be her attitude; a high-coloured and
      arrogant questioning of his status!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you do, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please understand, Slade, that I am not to be addressed
      with such familiarity by my late porter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave her a slight inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, madam. May I ask you a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will depend--upon--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Slade got in his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the reputation of the young man who is to
      marry--our--daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was beyond bearing, and Mrs. Pomeroy flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean? Are you suggesting--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This young man is a dissolute blackguard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no intention of being careful when a certain
      person's future is concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You listen to vulgar gossip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I trust to my own eyes and ears. Would it surprise you
      to know that the young man is carrying on a common
      intrigue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam, ask him, ask him where he was last evening,
      and with whom. I happen to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy opened the door again, looked out into the
      hall, and reclosed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You old spy! Do you realise, Slade, that there is a law of
      libel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not libel. It is the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was voiceless, biting her lips, her eyes
      a'flare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Slade, you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am here, Clara, to appeal to you to stop this marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed? Blackmail!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. I gave you a certain promise, and I will keep it,
      unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You refrain from sacrificing--our child--to your
      social--swindle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swindle! How dare you suggest--? Why, you fool, this is
      Rose's happiness. Your high moral ardour, Slade, has taken
      the wrong turning. What you are trying to do will destroy
      the girl's happiness, not--safeguard it. This is a
      love-match."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Clara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I'll prove it to you, you interfering old
      hypocrite."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was out of the room before he could stop her, or before
      he had realised what her purpose was. He heard her voice,
      loud and insistent. "Rose, Hector, my dears, I want you."
      James Slade was aware of a sudden feeling of emptiness in
      his stomach. He stood pressing his hat against it. Good
      God, he had not foreseen this counterstroke of Clara's! Its
      desperate audacity frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door stood open, and Mr. Slade had a vision of a
      confident and affectionate Clara shepherding her young on
      to the stage. What a confrontation! And what a challenge!
      He saw these two as lovers, crossing the hall with their
      arms about each other. He saw his daughter's face. She was
      looking up at her lover, as at some wonderful and unique
      creature, and James Slade's courage failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were looking at him. Mrs. Pomeroy had closed the door,
      and had moved into the centre of the stage. She was
      smiling, gracious, confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, Hector, my dears, Mr. Slade is here--as an old
      friend--to wish you happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade looked at his daughter's face. It had a soft
      radiance; it was without a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How kind of you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade was mute. He turned his eyes for a moment on
      the young man. Hector Hallard, too, was smiling. He gave
      Mr. Slade a condescending nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very decent of you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy had posed herself by the fireplace, one foot
      on the kerb, a hand resting easily on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Slade, aren't you going to give your message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked at the face of his daughter. It was a
      happy face, so happy that its very happiness overwhelmed
      him. He was beaten. He could not blurt out those terrible
      and fatal words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam. I'm sure I wish them both all that is best in
      the world. Love and honour--and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice failed him. He fumbled with his hat. He was aware
      of his daughter's shining eyes. Young Hallard was deigning
      to shake hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, muchly, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thank you ever so much, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade made some human sort of noise, fidgeted, gave
      one glance at the gracious and defiant matron, and moved
      towards the door. His lips moved, seemed to be fumbling for
      some final message, but no words came. He was beaten.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      There came a period in James Slade's life when force seemed
      to fail in him, and he could not determine whether he was a
      fool or a wise man. And did it matter? Yet, when a man asks
      himself that question, and a tired sadness answers,
      "Nothing matters," he may be in need of a tonic or a
      love-affair. Mr. Slade just persevered with his shop. He
      was supplying a need, and necessity and the faces and
      voices of his children propelled him. You could not be sour
      and smileless with the eager young coming to your counter,
      and if life was a sort of counter, Mr. Slade continued to
      serve at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, both young men had departed from Southfleet for a
      season, Charles to his hospital, Hector to Cambridge, and
      to James Slade the problem seemed a little less actual.
      There was one thing that surprised him, he could not find
      himself feeling bitter against Clara. Queer--that! Clara
      had out-manoeuvred him, routed him, and remained in
      possession of the field of battle. Clara had been too
      clever for him. She had dared him to take that happy
      radiance from his daughter's face, and he had flinched from
      the judgment of Solomon. Was it possible that Clara had
      been wiser than she knew, and that this love-affair might
      not end in the old-fashioned way, and as the story books
      had it--"They lived happily ever after."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had surrendered. If this was life, then life must
      have its way. Let these young things take their chance, and
      sail their ship together, and perhaps make harbour. Life
      might bring them storms and trials, and even wreck them,
      but as Mr. Slade pondered the problem he was moved to feel
      that he had no right to play the wrecker.
    </p>
    <p>
      His shop possessed him. Like many a man who has made a
      success of some enterprise, he discovered himself becoming
      the slave of his business. And, after all, it was a happy
      slavery. He had set out to sell toys, and he found himself
      making money, and friends. Every other Sunday, after taking
      the plate round in St. John's Church, he supped with the
      Golightly family. Mrs. Golightly was one of those buxom and
      comfortable women who had brought two comely daughters into
      the world, and whose two passions were her store-cupboard
      and the marriage market. She gave Mr. Slade prime cold beef
      and treacle tart, and a broad-nosed and jocund smile. Mr.
      Golightly gave James advice. The new Golightly premises
      were going up, and Mr. Golightly's top-hat seemed to grow
      glossier and glossier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to move, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Move?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that little place won't hold you in a year's time."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Slade did not want to move. His was a one-man show;
      he liked handling his toys in person; he had no wish to
      become a super-shopwalker, while assistants came between
      him and his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked to breakfast at eight, take his leisure, smoke his
      pipe and read his morning paper, and open the shop at nine.
      He found himself reading the sporting news, and especially
      the rowing news. The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race! One
      morning he discovered that young Hallard was stroking the
      Cambridge Eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not quite know whether to be pleased or
      peeved. But, damn it, the lad must have some guts to be
      doing that! Was there not hope in this athleticism? It
      postulated a degree of austerity. And Rose must be proud
      and pleased. They were so very young, these two. Time might
      change their inclinations. But was not that a rather mean
      reflection?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh," said Mr. Slade to himself. "I have forgotten the
      Boat Race."
    </p>
    <p>
      It behoved him to stock Light Blue and Dark Blue favours,
      rosettes and coloured birds on pins. He set out to remedy
      the omission, and cards bearing these colours appeared in
      the boys' window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen his daughter since the night when her happy
      face had silenced him; but one morning, three days before
      the Boat Race, she walked into his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Slade, you have boat-race favours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think yours is the only shop that has them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade gave his daughter a shy, little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad, Miss Rose, but I nearly forgot them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed more like her old self this morning, and less
      the stylish young madam. Mr. Slade felt mischievous. He
      took down a card of rosettes that was hanging on a hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see, Dark Blue, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Slade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, how silly of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector--Mr. Hallard--is stroking the Cambridge Eight. I am
      going to see the race. I am sure they will win this year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone else had come into the shop, and Miss Pomeroy and
      Mr. Slade were so absorbed in each other that they had not
      glanced at the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said, "It's about time. They have lost six years
      running."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's head went up with a jerk. Mr. Charles Richmond!
      Miss Pomeroy's pretty nose was in the air, but she ignored
      the interrupter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. What can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to keep tennis-balls, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do, sir. I haven't any at the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am joining the new club. You might give me one of those
      coloured monkeys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which--er--colour, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Oxford, of course. They'll win again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose flicked a sudden, snubbing look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, they won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles laughed, and stuck the dark blue favour in his
      button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to bet on it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bet you--anything--Cambridge wins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't be fair," said Charles. "One oughtn't to bet
      on--certainties," and he paid Mr. Slade and walked out of
      the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade picked up a duster, and made a show of dusting
      the counter. Miss Pomeroy had become head in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather a wag, Mr. Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just a Medical Student. They never have any manners,
      Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, too, walked out of the shop. Cambridge lost the
      Boat Race, and Rose, witnessing the defeat of her hero and
      his crew--they were three lengths behind at Barnes and
      knocking up a lot of water--almost wept over it. That
      wretch Charles had brought them bad luck. Impulse made her
      forget the proper self-restraint that the Hallards
      cultivated in public, for, when her chance came, she
      embarrassed her hero by throwing her arms about his neck
      before other members of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, I'm so sorry. Aren't you dreadfully tired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector might be looking rather washed out, for, to do him
      justice, he had rowed himself blind, but her charming
      compassion was not quite up to form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm all right. Losing the toss did us."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had other excuses to give when they were alone together.
      Numbers five and six had gone flabby, and had failed to
      back him properly when he had put in a critical spurt, and
      their cox had steered like an imbecile. Rose accepted these
      excuses with tender credulity, and hoped that Hector had
      not over-strained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come home and rest, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God, what an idea. Didn't the child know that
      tradition compelled the crews to dine together, and go to
      The Empire or some such Temple of Joy, and paint things
      blue? Rose went home alone, having had her ignorance
      chastened, and Hector got furiously drunk, and was thrown
      out of his music-hall, and taken care of by the police. He
      returned to Southfleet with a black eye, and exhibited it
      with complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye had to be explained to Rose. It was the symbol of
      malehood and honour. She accepted it. In fact, she was
      rather impressed by it. Her Hector was no Verdant Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade wrapped up the unsold favours in tissue-paper and
      put them away to do duty for next year's event. Poor Rose,
      her hero had lost the race! Mr. Slade heard about the black
      eye; in fact, Mr. Hector Hallard exhibited it to Southfleet
      with an air of sleepy insolence. He was a devil of a
      fellow, and let the girls take note of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next term was to be his last at Cambridge. He had spent
      a week-end with his uncle, Sir Bertie Hallard, at the great
      man's house in Regent's Park. Sir Bertie was not greatly
      enamoured of his nephew, but blood was thicker than water,
      and a Cambridge Rowing Blue would bring prestige to the
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector did not take a degree at Cambridge. He failed in his
      final, a distinction that was accorded to the most
      exclusive of sportsmen. What did it matter? A Blue was
      worth a whole cartload of B.A.'s. Rose was a little
      chagrined over his failure, until her hero pointed out to
      her that the real people did not bother about such academic
      favours. He was in good company. The Marquis of Malmesbury
      and Lord Tufton shared with him the distinction of having
      scorned the Rabbit Skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hereward Hallard had, in his day, also failed to take a
      degree, but then he had inherited property of considerable
      value. Times had changed, and Mr. Hereward was candid with
      his son. Hector had proposed to spend a part of the summer
      in touring the country and in staying with various friends.
      He had been invited to shoot grouse in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you don't, my lad," said his father. "It is time you
      stopped playing about. I have arranged with Bertie for you
      to join the firm at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, pater, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing doing, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      And since Mr. Hereward held the purse, though it was not a
      very fat one, his son was compelled to conform.

      Mr. Slade began to fix his dates, not by the Kings and
      Queens of England, or even by the festivals of the Church,
      but by the particular article that was in chief demand. In
      the main it was a male calendar, for dolls were perennial,
      and symbolical of the emotional slavery of women. There was
      the Bucket and Spade Season, the Hoop Season, the Soldier
      Season, which arrived towards Christmas when days were
      short and the weather completely English, and small boys
      had to amuse themselves indoors. But this year the Bucket
      and Spade Season was so hectic that all Mr. Slade's
      energies appeared to be concentrated on selling buckets and
      spades and ordering new supplies. Southfleet was becoming
      more and more popular with the East End of London, and
      excursion trains multiplied, and, since "The Toy Mart" was
      on the direct road to the sea, every London child seemed to
      cast covetous eyes upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost Mr. Slade was moved to acclaim, "Buckets and spades
      will be the death of me!" but not quite so. In fact, he was
      finding his little world so much to his liking, and so
      packed with his particular brand of self-expression, that
      he was less posed by vicarious problems. He ate well, he
      slept well, he doted on his shop and his garden. Eliza
      spoilt him, and yet failed to spoil him. His bank balance
      flourished, and he was sufficiently human to feel good
      about it. His Sabbath shilling in the plate became a
      florin. He even developed a nice fancy in ties and socks.
      But Buckets and Spades challenged him. Something would have
      to be done about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Eliza who suggested the obvious remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to have a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's meaning was not quite what it sounded. It was not
      Hallard, and Eliza had marked down and was ready to procure
      the lady. She had a niece, one Ph&oelig;be, who was a
      bright and good-tempered wench with a prejudice against
      domestic service. Ph&oelig;be could live in. Ph&oelig;be
      could occupy the little top back bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ph&oelig;be was engaged, a small, compact, pleasantly
      plain young woman, with a round, pale face, black hair, and
      a tip-tilted nose. Ph&oelig;be combined a sweet temper with
      a tart tongue, and an eye that could be gladsome. She took
      to Mr. Slade and the shop like a duck to water, and within
      a week she was presiding over the female side, and
      assisting in satisfying the clamour for buckets and spades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was a little puzzled about himself. He had seen
      it stated that one of the symptoms of old age was the dying
      down of the emotions. Was he growing old? He did not feel
      age creeping on him. He enjoyed his day's work and his
      dinner, and those forty winks after it, while Ph&oelig;be
      held the fort. In summer he liked to take his short nap in
      a long chair in the garden, a handkerchief over his face,
      and his hands folded upon his tummy. Eliza would respect
      that period of peace, and refrain from activities in the
      kitchen that might disturb his slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He earns it, bless his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would peer out of the window, and refrain from any
      clatter until she saw that the handkerchief had been
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Mr. Slade was finding life comfortable, and so was
      tending to become steeped in philosophical calm. In cold
      weather he had a hot bottle in his bed, and a glass of hot
      milk last thing, if he desired it. He liked treacle tart
      and jam roll, and Eliza gave him treacle tart and jam roll
      without stint of jam or treacle. Mr. Slade's inner man was
      at peace, and God seemed to be present in the toy-shop.
      "Let the little children come unto me--" "Unless ye become
      as little children."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, perhaps without knowing it, was becoming more
      and more a child, not senilely so, but in his naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highfield House had ceased to matter, nor was Clara a
      menace. Even his daughter's future gave him no sleepless
      nights. Things just happened, and it was useless to wear
      the shirt-tails of your soul to shreds trying to sit down
      upon human passions. Rose wanted Hector. She would have her
      Hector, and perhaps make a decent citizen of him. Why put a
      maggot of doubt into her pretty head? Destroy a child's
      faith in things and the ultimate product may prove to be a
      bitter little cynic.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when it came to be known that Hector Hallard, Esq., and
      Miss Rose Pomeroy were to be married, Mr. Slade accepted
      the news with a gentle shrug of the shoulders. Rose was
      marrying her own problem. Putting poison in the pot would
      not help her to sweeten it. Actually, Mr. Slade received an
      invitation to the wedding, and he attended at St. John's
      church with a white carnation in the buttonhole of his
      Sunday best, and a strange feeling of unreality in his
      heart. Here was his daughter being married, and he--her
      father--was not giving her away. Rather a dubious phrase,
      that! Mr. Grigson had accepted that responsibility, and Mr.
      Slade had wondered whom Clara would persuade to arm Rose up
      the church. Mr. Slade had sent his daughter a present, a
      silver cake-dish. He prayed for her happiness, but somehow
      he felt like an anonymous ghost sitting apart in the church
      and watching this pageant of the living. He saw Clara very
      gorgeous in purple velvet, and wholly the Duchess of
      Highfield. What if a little piping ghostly voice had cried,
      "I forbid this marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony was over. The young people and their relations
      disappeared into the vestry. The organ blared triumphantly.
      Oh, that Wedding March! He could remember arming Clara down
      the aisle. How exultantly that music played romance into a
      dusty corner! Mr. Slade stood and watched the happy pair
      pass down the aisle, young Hallard, spruce, smiling, and
      debonair, and looking as though he was conferring an
      infinite favour upon the world. Rose's face had a happy
      radiance, and Mr. Slade found himself saying, "Bless you,
      my dear. May you keep that happy look."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not like that young man. No, young Hallard was
      too strenuously pallid, too smart, too insolently
      complacent. A self-satisfied, supercilious young brute. Oh,
      come now, James Slade, don't be so prejudiced! He rubbed
      his hat with his sleeve, and, waiting till the church was
      empty, walked out alone like the ghost he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the carriages was rolling off to Highfield. Mr.
      Slade was not going to Highfield, and suddenly those
      massive and high holly hedges looked indubitably black to
      him. Prickles and gloom, and not orange blossom, and a
      young sensualist cuddling a girl in the darkness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in Mr. Slade winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rather wished that he did not know what he did know.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      It occurred to him as he walked back up the High Street
      that Hector Hallard could have called him "Father." No,
      "Pater," of course, and behind his back "The Old Man," or
      something even more contemptuous. He did not feel at all
      paternal towards his son-in-law. Eliza was waiting for him,
      an Eliza who had refused to countenance this "'uman
      sacrifice," even as an uninvited spectator, or out of
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's candour took the last of the gloss from the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had anybody wept? No, Mr. Slade confessed that he had not
      seen anyone in tears. In fact, both Miss Pomeroy and Mr.
      Hallard had looked particularly pleased with themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's bad," said Eliza gloomily, "my mother always
      did say that the bride who hadn't a tear in her eye had
      plenty before the year was out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Eliza, it needn't be as bad as that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose--she--was all togged up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean the bride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mrs. P."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, in a sense she was, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I was marrying a girl of mine to a thing like
      that, I'd have put on black. Give me a fooneral, Mr. Slade.
      You do know the trouble's over. Poor young thing, hers is
      only beginning."

    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Hector Hallard returned from their honeymoon
      to the little house on the Cliff Parade which Mrs. Pomeroy
      had purchased and presented to them as a wedding present.
      It was a charming little Love Box, white and low, with a
      green verandah and green shutters, a minute garden back and
      front, and a spacious view of the sea. Mrs. Pomeroy had
      furnished it at her own expense and according to her own
      taste, and old Hallard confessed that Mrs. Pomeroy had been
      very generous. She had spent more than two thousand pounds
      in floating her social enterprise, a thousand as her share
      of Hector's premium, and the rest upon the house and
      furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon Repos" was the little place's name. It would have been
      described by the house agents as a Bijou Residence, and
      every morning at eight-thirty Mr. Hector Hallard set out
      for the City, in top hat and tail coat, exquisitely-creased
      trousers and white spats. His wife, affectionately clasping
      his arm, sped him Citywards from the green iron gate. Mr.
      Hector Hallard travelled first, and was ready to talk
      finance to his elders with the assurance of a young man who
      knew nothing about it. He was not popular with the City
      fathers who travelled with him daily. More than one elderly
      gentleman was seen to leave the compartment and seek
      another when Mr. Hector Hallard entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I can't stomach that damned young prig."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade liked to take a stroll after closing the shop,
      and a natural curiosity, and perhaps some naughtiness,
      moved him to walk once or twice a week past "Mon Repos,"
      and on to "Highfield." It was extraordinary how many
      glimpses you got of other people's lives by strolling past
      their shop-windows, and poking your nose over hedges and
      fences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon Repos" possessed a euonymus hedge behind its low iron
      railings. It was just possible to see over it if you were
      on your feet, but not if you were sitting down. Mr. Slade
      frequently passed by "Mon Repos" shortly after Mr. Hector
      Hallard had returned from his labour in the City, and would
      discover him in a long chair, with a garden table beside
      him, and upon it a whisky decanter and a syphon. Strange,
      that youth should need such a stimulus after a somewhat
      sedentary day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, in some of his passings, saw Mrs. Hector Hallard
      sitting in a garden chair, diligently sewing. The articles
      upon which she was engaged were somewhat suggestive, and so
      was the young wife's figure. She looked stouter and more
      matronly, and suddenly James Slade tumbled to the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord, I am going to be a grandfather!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These peripatetic snoopings on the part of Mr. Slade
      provided him with the gradual impression that Mr. Hector
      Hallard was bored. Neither he nor his young wife appeared
      to have much to say to each other, but Mr. Slade did happen
      upon one illuminating incident. Rose had upon her knees one
      very suggestive garment, and with sudden playfulness that
      was not without pathos, she leaned over and draped it over
      her husband's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess, Tor, what that is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hector was not intrigued. In fact, he appeared to be
      irritated by this intimate challenge. He snatched the thing
      off, glanced at it, and, holding it by one corner between
      finger and thumb, deposited it in his wife's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not funny. Don't be sloppy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade saw his daughter flush. She stood up with the
      garment in her hands, looked rather strangely at her mate,
      and then turned and walked into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening later in the summer Mr. Slade was surprised to
      find that the hedge had disappeared. So had Mrs. Hector
      Hallard, but the young gentleman was there with his whisky
      and soda, semi-prone and flaccid. Was Mr. Hallard becoming
      bored with domestic bliss? Mr. Slade had paused, for his
      son-in-law was not interested in old gentlemen in bowler
      hats, and Mr. Slade might not have been visible. As a
      matter of fact, he was not visible, but just as he was
      about to pass on he saw something happen to Mr. Hallard's
      face. It came alive. Eyes and teeth gleamed. Mr. Hallard
      was sitting up and taking notice. He waved to someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade moved on until he was out of the picture, and
      then turned to look towards the broad cliff path on the
      other side of the roadway. Two colourful young women were
      passing by, and one of them was throwing an oblique and
      backward glance at Mr. Hallard. So that was it! Mr. Slade
      rubbed his chin, and walked on, meditating upon that
      suggestive incident. A sensual young man whose wife was in
      a certain negative condition might be provoked into seeking
      sexual satisfaction elsewhere. Mr. Slade did not like the
      taste of that thought. Some thoughts can go rancid almost
      before you think them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself contemplating the architectural falsity of
      "Highfield," bastard French, and bad at that. What
      tricksiness--what a Château of Snobbery! The gates were
      open, and Mr. Slade could see the sleek lawns, and the beds
      of geranium, and the chaste, weedless drive. Was Clara
      happy now that her ideals were consummated? What did such a
      busy bouncing woman do with herself now that she was a lady
      of leisure? Did she miss her daughter? Mr. Slade became
      aware of a tiny white handbill attached to one of the
      gate-pillars. He approached it and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hospital Fête and Bazaar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be held in the grounds of 'Highfield House' on August
      25th. By the kind permission of Mrs. Pomeroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stared at it. Ye Gods, Clara was taking to good
      works! Well, well, well! There were urges--and urges. But
      was not philanthropy sometimes the last resource of the
      vaguely disillusioned? Clara must have her bone to bite
      upon. She had to spend her superabundant energy. She was
      becoming a Lady of the Lamp, though the oil--like that
      other impression of his--might be a little rancid.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Nor was that the end of the story. One morning a week
      later, Mr. Slade happened to be dressing a window when the
      Highfield carriage stopped outside his shop. It contained
      Mrs. Pomeroy and her daughter, who was in an interesting
      condition, and a pale, thin gentlewoman in black, whose
      eyes had a frightened prominence. This was Miss Mossett,
      Mrs. Pomeroy's lately-engaged companion and secretary, poor
      wretch, a new slave of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Miss Mossett was told to get out of the carriage
      and deliver a message to Mr. Slade. She minced across the
      pavement, and, seeing Mr. Slade as a live exhibit in the
      window, she tapped upon the window and made little noises,
      or that was how they reached Mr. Slade. She looked rather
      like a fish mouthing at another fish in a separate glass
      tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade slid backwards from the window into the shop, and
      spoke to Ph&oelig;be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be, my dear, there is a lady outside who appears
      to want something. Will you please find out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be walked out of the shop and returned in ten
      seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says Mrs. Pomeroy wants you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade smiled sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can tell the lady to tell Mrs. Pomeroy that if she
      wants to speak to me she will find me in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be crinkled up her naughty nose at Mr. Slade, and
      nodded her head in approval. Mrs. Pomeroy, in spite of her
      new philanthropic adventures, was becoming less and less
      popular in the town. Her arrogance, even when it smiled
      condescendingly, remained arrogance. So suave a person as
      Mr. Golightly had been moved to treat Mrs. Pomeroy with
      polite but offended dignity. Poor Miss Mossett had to
      return to the carriage and deliver that ultimatum to her
      new tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says you will find him in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy sat for a moment, as though savouring this
      snub. Then she left the carriage, and crossed the pavement
      to the shop door, where Ph&oelig;be stood observing the
      world as she saw it. Mrs. Pomeroy paused, as though
      expecting the girl to open the door, but Ph&oelig;be did
      not do so, and Mrs. Pomeroy had to open the door for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered. She found Mr. Slade behind a counter, engaged
      in making a selection of toys with which to complete the
      dressing of his window. Mr. Slade looked at her with the
      eyes of a man who could see humour in the incident, but
      Mrs. Pomeroy was not amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent you in a message. May I ask if you received it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's hands were resting tranquilly on the lid of a
      cardboard box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gather, madam, that you wished to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My place, madam, happens to be behind my counter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Ph&oelig;be snigger? Mrs. Pomeroy turned her head
      sharply, and regarded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask, Mr. Slade, if you do not owe some courtesy to
      your customers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, madam, most certainly, in my shop. What can I do for
      you? Please take a chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy refused the chair, and remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had intended offering you, Slade, an opportunity that
      might have been of considerable value to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade waited attentively and in silence, his hands at
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you have heard that we are holding a fête and a
      bazaar--for the cottage hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam, I had heard something of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy bent a stately head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. I had intended offering you the chance of
      opening a toy-stall--at my expense--at our bazaar, but as
      you do not seem--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, with a little bow, gently interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, I could not accept such a favour. It would have
      been at my own expense. Is there anything else I can do for
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not, most obviously not. Mrs. Pomeroy turned
      towards the door, and Mr. Slade spoke to Ph&oelig;be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door, please, for the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be did so. She winked at Mr. Slade behind Mrs.
      Pomeroy's back, but Mr. Slade did not return the wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be, my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more difficult the customer--the more polite one must
      be in suffering and serving."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Slade. But you did put her out, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      There were two human happenings in the January of that
      winter, happenings which were intimately related to the
      life history of James Slade. His daughter bore a son, and
      Mr. Slade fell dangerously ill. He had overworked himself
      during the Christmas rush, and had gone forth on a bitter
      January morning to lay a wreath of holly on Mr. Truslove's
      grave. He came back looking chilled and feeling shivery.
      Next day he was in bed, and the diagnosis was acute
      pneumonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, propped up in bed, flushed, panting, with a kind
      of bright anguish in his eyes, was the centre of a little
      circle of devotion. Eliza was up and down stairs, grim and
      untiring. Ph&oelig;be would put her head into the room, and
      assure Mr. Slade that everything was well with the shop.
      Dr. Richmond came twice a day. A trained nurse was brought
      in. Mr. Golightly called to say that, if Mr. Slade needed
      help, an assistant could be loaned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was worried about something, nor did he surrender
      himself to the struggle until he had given expression to
      the need that was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't made a will, doctor. I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was wise as a physician. The effort expended
      in such a piece of business might be less exhausting than
      the frustrated fretting of a sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Need it take long? I don't want you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. It would go into six lines."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond sent Mr. Grigson to Mr. Slade, and in three
      minutes or so the thing was done. Mr. Slade's estate was to
      be divided into three equal portions, one for Mrs. Hector
      Hallard, one for Eliza, one for the Southfleet Cottage
      Hospital in the shape of a Memorial Bed to Mr. John
      Truslove. Mr. Grigson drew up this simple testament, and
      Ph&oelig;be and the nurse witnessed Mr. Slade's signature.
      His writing was strangely steady for so sick a man, though
      the nurse had to sit behind him and support him while he
      used the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he lay back with a sigh and a funny little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all in order, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, Mr. Slade, but my hope is that we shall not need
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's done, sir; anyway it's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza, hearing of the solemn affair from Ph&oelig;be, was
      at first surprised and hurt. Why had not she been called to
      serve in this grave event? Eliza's eyes filled with tears,
      but Ph&oelig;be was able to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--you couldn't, Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not? I've--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you may be--interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interested! Of course, I'm interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean--he--left you something. I did happen to peek--and
      see your name there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, leaving--me--money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ph&oelig;be nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? You've been a good friend to him, haven't you?"
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond brought a small Hallard into the world, a
      lusty, squalling little bit of flesh that seemed to be more
      Rose than Hector. Mrs. Pomeroy had remained at "Mon Repos"
      while the ordeal was in progress, though her son-in-law
      went to bed on the sofa and slept through most of it.
      Marriage could be a boring business, with a house full of
      women, and especially this particular woman. Mrs. Pomeroy
      was like a large and vigorous animal who had crowded
      herself into a small hutch, and the little house appeared
      to vibrate with her activities. Hector and his
      mother-in-law were becoming more and more unsympathetic
      towards each other. In fact, Mr. Hallard thought of her as
      "That damned, interfering fat old bitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, finding him asleep just when the crisis was
      at hand, woke him with some abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake up, Hector."
    </p>
    <p>
      He blinked at her with those sulky, sleepy, insolent eyes
      of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble indeed! Surely a husband should concern himself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does that help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your callousness astonishes me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm just dead tired, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about poor Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Pomeroy made such a nuisance of herself, and was
      so greased with complacency when her grandson was born,
      that Dr. Richmond, who had been exasperated by her
      interferences, was sufficiently human to plant a barb in
      her maternal bosom. It was a subtle shaft, and as a student
      of human nature, he was interested in watching its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, life and death, Mrs. Pomeroy. Have you heard that
      poor old Mr. Slade is desperately ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy appeared to catch her breath and grow rigid.
      Her voluble face suddenly became still. Dr. Richmond might
      have injected a dose of some potent drug into her large
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Slade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, acute pneumonia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      But her sorrow beamed. There was a sudden, secret relief in
      her eyes. With James Slade dead and buried her unpleasant
      secret might be buried with him. Almost, the news roused in
      her a grateful tenderness. Poor, silly ineffectual James!
      Could she not afford to pity him--dead? Then Dr. Richmond,
      who was observing her, detected another change of face.
      Alarm--dismay: What if the poor wretch babbled, or left
      some revealing document behind him? She became a little
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he conscious, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really must go and see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was reflecting upon her obvious agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that is not possible. No visitors allowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As bad as that. Really, I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had made his will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond left the lady with that barb in her bosom.
      Yes, he had disconcerted her, and considerably so. She was
      terrified lest the old man should blab. Dr. Richmond had no
      illusions about certain sorts of women. But he was careful
      to give orders to the nurse and to Eliza that no one was to
      be admitted on any excuse whatsoever. Mr. Slade's condition
      was critical, and no draught of emotion must be allowed to
      play upon the flickering flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy attempted to disobey the doctor. She went on
      foot to "The Toy Mart," rang the bell at the side door, and
      was confronted by Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Eliza, this is sad news--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza had the face of a stubborn uncomprehending cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really must see the poor man. He was with us so long,
      Eliza; so devoted a servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was thinking, "Now--what the sanguinary hell is your
      game? Devoted servant, indeed! Fiddlesticks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, madam; no visitors allowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Eliza, dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor's orders," and very firmly she closed the door upon
      Mrs. Pomeroy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy passed through the next few days in a state of
      singular agitation. She had no need to worry about her
      daughter or her grandson, for both mother and child were
      doing well, but she was seriously disturbed about Mr.
      Slade. So he had made a will! Might not the contents of
      that will prove catastrophic and revealing? And could a man
      make a will without betraying his identity? What if Slade
      became Pomeroy?
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear that Mrs. Pomeroy had become far more
      sensitive to public opinion since her elevation to social
      eminence, for the higher you climbed the more considerable
      might be your fall. Maybe she began to regret the crude and
      somewhat fantastic punishment she had imposed upon the man
      who had disgraced the name of Pomeroy, and that she
      realised that your bread might be returned to you in a
      state of sour corruption. Not that there was any change of
      heart in Clara, only an adaptation to a very formidable
      crisis. She had been unwise in letting her spite exercise
      itself on this futile little man. She should have pensioned
      him off and packed him away in some obscure corner of
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do about it? Attempt a second storming of
      "The Toy Mart," and a tearful reconciliation with poor
      James? She could appeal to him not to reveal the fact that
      Rose's boy was the grandson of a criminal. But there was
      that sullen old creature, Eliza, standing in the way. How
      much did that wretched woman know? Had poor James been
      delirious and babbled of strange secrets? Mrs. Pomeroy was
      in such a state of agitation that her temper became
      explosive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It clashed with her son-in-law's, for Hector had had more
      than enough of his mother-in-law's presence. Was the house
      his or was it not? This damned old woman was still
      occupying the spare-room bed, though Highfield was less
      than a quarter of a mile away, and she pervaded the house
      like a perpetual draught. Hector, returning from the City,
      found Mrs. Pomeroy still established in "Mon Repos," and
      destroying for him any repose which the damned little box
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still here, mater?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she was still there, occupying his particular
      chair like an old hen on a clutch of eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose is better to-day, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing wrong with Rose," said Hector, "and if
      you will excuse me saying so, I'd like the spare-room for
      myself. I'm rather bored with a shakedown on the sofa."
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge was so obvious that Mrs. Pomeroy countered it
      by pretending not to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you must be, but I like to be near Rose. A
      mother does."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector stood, hands in pockets, looking at her with
      cold-eyed disrelish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so, but I married your daughter, not the two of you.
      I shall be obliged if you will leave your daughter to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      What impudence! How intolerable to a mother who had done
      everything to make two young people happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you speak to me like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector drawled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to be necessary. Let's understand this business.
      Mothers-in-law are supposed to be a joke, but this one is
      growing rather stale with me. I shall be grateful if you
      will go back to Highfield and leave me--my--house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy spluttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your--house! Well, I like that! Where would you have been
      if I hadn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector rattled his money and his keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you buy me--as well as the house? I think not. We
      Hallards have a prejudice against being bossed by our
      women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy flounced up in a fury. To have such insolent
      ingratitude imposed upon her just when she was so worried!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--never--did! Most certainly I will not stay in a house
      where I'm treated with such--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," said Hector, "that will solve the problem so far
      as I am concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Pomeroy had to have her scene, and she had it with
      her daughter. She left poor Rose flushed and weakly hot
      with exhaustion, but more inclined to side with Hector,
      though Hector was ceasing to be the hero he had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you had better go, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I shall go. And I shall not enter this house
      again until Hector has apologised."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hallards did not apologise. It was not in the family
      tradition. Mr. Hereward sympathised with his son, and,
      having obtained all the benefits that might be expected
      from the lady, he could allow his natural aversion its
      self-expression. She had helped to take Hector off his
      hands and settle him in life, and old Hereward, who was as
      selfish as his son, had not been sorry to be relieved of a
      troublesome liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman like that has to be kept in her place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector helped himself to his father's whisky, and Mr.
      Hereward kept a mistrustful eye on the decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do it, pater. Because you have married a woman's
      daughter she seems to think she can run your show like a
      charity-school. I hear that she will not cross our doorstep
      unless I apologise."
    </p>
    <p>
      His father gave a dry chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the thing is not to apologise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obviously," and Hector pressed the trigger of the
      soda-water syphon.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy, driving out in her furs, saw Dr. Richmond's
      dogcart approaching "Mon Repos." Mrs. Pomeroy had no
      intention--for the moment--of stopping at "Mon Repos." She
      was on her dignity, and her self-restraint would be
      transferred to her cheque book, but she wanted a word with
      Dr. Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Gates. I wish to speak to the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond's dogcart had pulled up, and, seeing that Mrs.
      Pomeroy's carriage was stopping, he went to speak to her.
      The absence of the lady from "Mon Repos," and the sudden
      peace that had reigned there, had provoked him to ask his
      patient whether her mother was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had confessed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm afraid my mother and my husband have had a
      little--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Difference of opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond's dogcart had pulled up, and, seeing that
      son-in-law's absence, was visiting her daughter, but it was
      not so. Mrs. Pomeroy showed no disposition to leave her
      carriage. She bent to Dr. Richmond with an air of gracious
      concern, and asked him the question he had expected her to
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, doctor, how is poor Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Richmond hesitated for a moment. Should he give a twist to
      the barb he had planted in her abundant bosom? Her
      buxomness should have postulated the milk of human
      kindness, but there was a vulgar saying in the profession
      that fat could be cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little better, I am glad to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy's bosom appeared to expand under her furs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad. Is the poor man out of danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond was inexorably grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite, but there is--hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad. Please convey to him my sincerest sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      How stately a phrase! Almost, it was episcopal, and Dr.
      Richmond raised his hat to the lady, and turned towards the
      gate of "Mon Repos." Well, well, perhaps the Richmond
      family had had a happy escape, for, though Charles had been
      charmed by the daughter, neither he nor his son nor his
      son's mother would have found Mrs. Pomeroy anything
      but--cold and oppressive fat!
    </p>
    <p>
      None the less, Dr. Richmond had been disingenuous in his
      statement to Mrs. Pomeroy, for Mr. Slade was out of danger,
      and enjoying that strange sense of surrender and of peace
      in which the spirit can steep itself when the body chooses
      to be healed. Mr. Slade sat propped up in bed, with a
      bright fire burning, and the winter sun laughing in at the
      window. His breath came gently, in and out like little
      waves on a windless summer morning. No more struggles, no
      more pectoral anguish. He just lay and floated in a daze of
      sweet serenity. Everybody had been so good to him, so
      surprisingly good. Eliza, Ph&oelig;be, his nurse, the dear
      doctor, and an astonishing number of unexpected people.
      Poor Eliza, when the good news had been given her, had come
      into his room, sat down beside the bed, and blubbed. He had
      had to do the comforting, patting that solid hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, Eliza. I don't know what I should have done
      without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boo-hoo," sobbed Eliza, "we've all been so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've all been very good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had confronted with eyes of childish astonishment
      the human tributes that had been brought into his room.
      Mrs. Richmond had sent him hot-house flowers. Mr.
      Golightly's young man was assisting Ph&oelig;be in the
      shop. Messages and inquiries had poured in, but the things
      that had touched Mr. Slade most tenderly had been offerings
      from some of his children. Sprawling, infantile letters.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Dear Mr. Slade,<br>
      <br>
      Do get well soon. I want you to be my Valentine.<br>
      <br>
      Polly.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Evangeline had sent him two oranges, Ethel a box of
      chocolates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had asked to have these--as yet
      uneatable--offerings placed on the table beside his bed.
      Ph&oelig;be wrote for him grateful letters.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Dear Polly,<br>
      <br>
      It will make me very happy to be your Valentine. I am going

    <p>
      Mr. Slade was very happy. At the end of the third week his
      friends were allowed to visit him, with Eliza in charge of
      the time-piece. The Rev. Mr. Chatterway came and made
      jokes, and so did Mr. Golightly, though their respective
      humour differed in flavour. Mr. Grigson was briefly grave
      and kind. Mrs. Richmond brought more flowers, and an order
      that he was not to tire himself by talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will excuse me, madam, there is no need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my face a conversation piece, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just like to lie and look at it, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Richmond laughed that shy and delightful little laugh
      of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost, Mr. Slade, you persuade me to look in my mirror."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life--is your mirror, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade seemed very apt and quick in his repartee. He
      could say to himself, "I don't know what I have done to
      deserve all this kindness," but in one direction his
      conjectures were befogged. He did wonder a little whether
      those who were nearest to him in the flesh had shown any
      human interest in his survival. Did they know, and, if they
      knew, had even the most conventional advance been made? Mr.
      Slade was shy of asking that question. His mood was so
      serene and gentle that he was ready to forgive everybody
      anything and everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no note or gift lay there either from his wife or his
      daughter, and the absence caused Mr. Slade to suffer a
      secret pang. After all, blood was thicker than orange
      juice, and paternity more than a bottle of physic.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eliza, did Miss Rose, or her mother--? How silly of me, I
      mean Mrs. Hallard--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza stood with her hands folded over her tummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"She</i> called once, but I wouldn't let her in.
      Doctor's orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad she called. And--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing from Mrs. Hector. You see, she's had a baby,
      and I expect she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A baby, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade lay staring at the fire. Dear, dear, how
      surprising! He was a grandfather! But he did rather wish
      that his daughter had remembered him. Yet why should she?
      She must be loving the young and not thinking of the old,
      and what was he but old Slade who had carried up the coal
      and cleaned the silver?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade felt a little less happy when, for the first
      time, he had his clothes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, Eliza, I'm as weak as a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you are," said Eliza; "you've been at death's
      door. Now, no tricks, mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be February, but Mr. Slade had a hunger for fresh
      air, and he could not let these women go on coddling him.
      Moreover, he was to be Polly's Valentine, and he was moved
      to celebrate his recovery by giving a party. Ph&oelig;be
      applauded the idea, but Eliza was less enthusiastic. Cakes,
      etc.? Oh, yes, she would not mind making the cakes, but she
      was not going to permit Mr. Slade to tire himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want my party, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say you do, Dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Ph&oelig;be can give it, and I'll be just one of
      the--kids."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza looked at him maternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just what you are, James Slade, a blessed kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let me have my party, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, he had his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was given in the shop, after closing hour. Eliza and
      Ph&oelig;be arranged a long table between the counters.
      There was Christmas cake with pink icing, and jam
      sandwiches, and fancy cakes, and crackers, and oranges and
      nuts, and a bran-tub for lucky dips. Mrs. Eliza presided,
      and kept an eye on Mr. Slade. It was a very successful and
      happily noisy party. Everyone wore paper caps, and Polly,
      having found a golden crown in her cracker, crowned her
      Valentine with it. When the table was cleared away, and the
      oranges and nuts had been scrambled for, they played Blind
      Man's Buff and Kiss in the Ring. Everybody seemed to want
      to catch Mr. Slade and kiss him. And Mr. Slade kissed
      Eliza, and Eliza blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the children had gone and the excitement was over Mr.
      Slade suddenly felt tired. His eyes were saying: "The
      Dustman's coming," and his legs were protesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll go to bed, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade refused to be helped. He tottered upstairs, still
      wearing his paper crown, and sat down on the bed. His heart
      was going lumpety-lump, and he could feel the beat in his
      ears. Dear, dear, how weak this wretched illness had left
      him! He sat on the bed and undressed in sections, and
      groped for his night-shirt. He was beginning to feel cold,
      and the bed would be cold. But it wasn't. Someone had
      slipped two hot-water bottles into it, and Mr. Slade
      snuggled down with a sigh of relief and pulled the clothes
      up to his chin. Really, these women were spoiling him! But
      he rather liked it, especially on a night such as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Came a knock at the door. It was Eliza with a glass of hot
      milk. She eyed him maternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone and overtired yourself, haven't you. You drink that
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Eliza. But it was a lovely party, wasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't say as it wasn't. But you'll stay in bed
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Eliza--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade missed his grandson's christening, and had he
      been present he might have found certain incidents to
      intrigue him. A very radiant young mother held George
      Hereward in her arms, and became quite concerned when Mr.
      Chatterway's application of cold water produced a storm.
      Mrs. Pomeroy, of course, was present, but somewhat upon her
      dignity. The proud father stood by, looking less bored than
      usual, for somehow this little bit of raw humanity amused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A closed carriage was waiting outside St. John's Church,
      and before he was driven home George Hereward had to be
      introduced to a number of ladies. They made foolish noises
      at him, and the usual sentimental remarks, and argued as to
      which parent he resembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's just like his mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think he is more like his father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector stood looking with a little snicker of a smile at
      his son. There was no compliment in the suggested likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ask me, I think he is just like that funny
      old thing who keeps the toy-shop. Name of Slade, I
      believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was shocked. She held up gloved hands of
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector, how can you say such a thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a dreadful thing, this innocent creature
      resembling his grandfather! Meanwhile, George Hereward
      showed signs of taking after his father. He did not like
      plain old women, and all these large faces looming at him.
      He set up a rebellious squalling, and had to be hurried
      into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Hector to his wife as they drove homewards, "Well, I
      don't wonder. The brat has some taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was attending to her son's wet and bubbling chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor darling, did all the--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old cats claw and howl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Tor, you must admit he behaved--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, damn it, just as I should have behaved. Go it, slaver
      away, my son. Did the nasty old women--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not nasty old women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's just a question of taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, that ridiculous remark of her son-in-law's had
      remained in Mrs. Pomeroy's mind. Was the child really like
      his grandfather? Supposing he grew up to be a second Slade?
      Mrs. Pomeroy was passing through that period when a woman
      is subject to strange flushes and discomforts, both
      physical and emotional, a period that may exaggerate all
      her natural disharmonies. Also, she was not finding the
      solitary life at Highfield sufficient to satisfy her
      passion to possess and to rule. Bullying poor Miss Mossett
      was poor sport, and Good Works lacked the spice of combat.
      Mrs. Pomeroy had attempted to dominate certain committees
      upon which she served, and not very successfully so. She
      roused more resentment than cooperation. She had passed the
      crest of her career, and was slipping towards the trough,
      and was conscious of it, and in her present state liable to
      sudden storms of anger. She could become almost hysterical
      when these flushes were on her, a red-faced, turbulent hag,
      as the Hallards, father and son, might have described her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Pomeroy was suffering her first defeat at the
      hands of her son-in-law. Hector could be cold, polite and
      sarcastic. He kept his temper when she lost hers, and his
      tongue was like a wet towel flicking her inflamed and angry
      face. Moreover, Rose sided with her husband, and, having
      discovered a new possessiveness since the coming of her
      son, she showed a combative spirit in countering the
      matriarch in her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, Mrs. Pomeroy, evading her son-in-law, would appear at
      "Mon Repos," and attempt to dominate the nursery, and
      demonstrate to her daughter how a baby should be handled.
      Rose was nursing George Hereward, and even over this very
      natural function mother and daughter quarrelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy asserted that such a thing was not ladylike,
      and Rose flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense! What are a woman's breasts for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be vulgar, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, I shall be much obliged if you will not
      interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Pomeroy could not keep her hands from meddling,
      and Rose appealed to Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She comes here and makes scenes, and upsets the child.
      What shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector pinched his son's nose. "That's quite simple. Lock
      the front door, and let her ring. After drawing a few
      blanks she'll give it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose took her husband's advice, and Mrs. Hallard's
      neighbour witnessed the unseemly farce of Mrs. Pomeroy
      ringing with persistence the bell of "Mon Repos," and
      without result. She was left upon the doorstep, fuming, and
      rapping indignantly upon a stubborn door. There was no
      response, and Mrs. Pomeroy was compelled to retreat to her
      carriage, under the cynical gaze of Gates, her coachman.
      Mrs. Pomeroy felt herself to be a much wronged woman, yet
      Southfleet's sympathies were with the young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gates, describing the incident in the Highfield kitchen,
      had an appreciative audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, if they didn't lock the old woman out. You should
      have seen her face!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff was to see it in due course, and it did not
      inspire either respect or affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that insanity is often an exaggeration of our
      more normal emotions and our whimsies, and, considered by
      normal standards, Clara Pomeroy was not quite sane. The
      change of life was upon her, and almost symbolically so,
      and she was like a spoilt child who, unused to being
      thwarted, flew into sinister rages. Her high colour was
      more than mere high colour. Her eyes looked more prominent
      and strained, and perpetually angry. And poor Miss Mossett
      was almost in perpetual tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any sort of opposition, however trivial, brought on these
      attacks of mental blood-pressure, and in searching for some
      object upon which to concentrate her anger she fastened
      most strangely upon James Slade. Here was a creature who
      had failed her, fooled her, and in a sense--defied her.
      James Slade had eluded the judgment she had attempted to
      impose upon him. He was daring to live happily and
      successfully in the same town.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade would have to be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked into his shop one morning, and found him with
      two of his young customers. She sat down. She said, "I wish
      to speak to you on business, Slade. I will wait." Mr.
      Slade, suddenly wise as to the crisis, nodded at
      Ph&oelig;be who was behind the other counter, and when
      Ph&oelig;be and the children had gone, he came round from
      behind the counter and locked the shop door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must insist upon your leaving this town, Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      The demand was as abrupt as her voice. She spoke, not only
      with authority, but with the assumption that her order
      would be obeyed, and James Slade, looking down into his
      wife's face, saw in it a ravaged strangeness. How different
      from the face of the girl he had married! Something was the
      matter with Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should I leave this town, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, stop this nonsense. This hypocrisy and make-believe
      cannot continue. I am tired of all this humbug."
    </p>
    <p>
      James Slade looked at her attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I be the one to leave? Why not you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? What impudence! I--hold a position in this town. You
      are a mere--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tradesman, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. I was a fool to bring you here. I realise that
      now. I should have left you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead to the world, Clara! Are you not being a
      little--unguarded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unguarded indeed! I warn you that unless you leave this
      town, I shall expose you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade stood regarding her with gentle astonishment.
      Yes, something was very wrong with Clara. This distortion
      of her previous pose was, like her face, somehow the
      product of a ravaged and insane egoism. He spoke to her
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you quite know what you are saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a fool. I do. I shall receive sympathy for all
      that I have suffered, while you--will be exposed--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter has not behaved to me as a daughter should. As
      for her husband--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was shocked. So, even in this last revelation of
      herself, Clara was betraying an intractable egoism which
      could sacrifice--. Well, she could not be quite sane. She
      must be a sick woman, sick in soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you realise, my dear, what you are suggesting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't my dear me, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hadn't you better see a doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do no such thing. I will give you a week, Slade,
      to think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can give me a year, Clara, and my decision will be the
      same. I shall stay. I have some right to a little
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose. She towered over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. You--have been the cause of all my miseries and
      my misfortunes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Clara!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unlock the door, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think again, Clara, before you make your choice."
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      What a catechism!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade did not quite know what to make of it. He could
      not say that he felt frightened, though he did not welcome
      being reintroduced to his world as a man who had received a
      lengthy sentence for fraud. And yet, he had been so near to
      the next world that the present world seemed a somewhat
      different place, and he--so serene and above human
      disharmonies that no crisis could scare him. But Rose? And
      Clara herself? Had she no understanding of the more subtle
      and complex reactions that might manifest themselves
      against herself? Yes, that always had been the trouble with
      Clara. When she had suffered from one of her rages there
      was nothing else but lightning and thunder in her world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could advise her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person in Southfleet who knew his secret was Dr.
      Richmond, and to Dr. Richmond James Slade went, for
      Richmond was Mrs. Pomeroy's physician. Mr. Slade sat with
      his hat on his knees and made a further confession to Dr.
      Richmond. No, he was not worried about himself; he had
      found peace and happiness, and if God so willed it that he
      was to receive this chastisement, he would bear it. His
      daughter's happiness was what mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond sat back in his chair, and studied Mr. Slade's
      gentle and serene old face. No, this old man was no humbug.
      He belonged, without knowing it, to the community of
      saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can anything be done, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wife is my patient--and yet not my patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless she sends for me I cannot very well push my way
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is her temper, you know, doctor. She always had an
      ungovernable temper, and there were times--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as these. And there are times in a woman's life, Mr.
      Slade, when her emotions may become abnormal, so much so
      that she may not be responsible for what she says or what
      she does. Nature finds out the cracks in the facade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather difficult for me, doctor. Even if I were to
      give way to her, sell up my business and go elsewhere, I
      could not be sure that she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Dr. Richmond could be emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go? Of course not. Out of the question. Why, you are
      one of Southfleet's 'Worthies,' Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very good of you to say so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not handing out compliments, Mr. Slade. Even if the
      truth were known, I do not believe it would make any
      difference in Southfleet. Not with the people who
      mattered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are giving me comforting medicine, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. I am saying what I believe to be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Richmond's counsel carried weight with James Slade. His
      advice was to leave the problem to simmer. Mrs. Pomeroy
      might change her mind and her temper, while to give way to
      that temper would be both unwise and immoral. Dr. Richmond
      had no love for Mrs. Pomeroy, and perhaps he had not quite
      forgiven her daughter for choosing young Hallard in place
      of his son. Not that he would have welcomed the alliance,
      but paternal prejudice must be served. As for Master
      Hector, he was an unlicked prig, and a bad lot, and even
      the charming Rose appeared to have had her pretty head
      turned. No, let life ferment its own wine.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      As it happened, Mrs. Pomeroy did change her mind, or rather
      her temper for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another clash with her son-in-law moved her to realise
      that she possessed powers of coercion, even though they
      were to be exercised upon the person of her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was what she did, without realising that the
      ultimate result would be the slow poisoning of the married
      life of the two young people. She would regain control of
      Rose, re-assert her authority. Hector had been insolent to
      her, and Hector should be taught who was in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy called again on James Slade and was almost
      gracious to him. Under the new dispensation he might prove
      to be an asset instead of a social liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have changed my mind, James. You can stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      How magnanimous of her! But James Slade was relieved for
      Rose's sake. He did not suspect the evil that was in this
      woman's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Clara. You know, my dear, life has taught me
      that to hurt people may be man's worst sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy accepted the platitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you hurt me, James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Compassion! Yet, if she was capable of such a feeling it
      was expended wholly upon herself.

      The spring had come, and Rose, the young mother, wheeled
      George Hereward out into Caroline Gardens. If all the world
      loves a lover, it can also feel warmed towards a young
      mother and her child. Mrs. Richmond thought it quite a
      pretty sight to see Mrs. Hector Hallard sitting on a seat
      with the pram beside her, and George Hereward asleep, or
      kicking exultantly and making strange noises at his mother.
      Lucy Richmond was reminded of the days when she had sat on
      that self-same seat with Charles at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was happy with her son, and all the more so because
      she was less happy with her husband. The hero had passed,
      and in his place sat a laconic and absent young man whose
      secret self seemed elsewhere. Hector was reverting to other
      attractions. He was away from her all the day, and he would
      drift away from her in the evening, if not in the flesh,
      then in the spirit. He did not talk to her about his
      affairs, and if she attempted to move him to confidence she
      would receive some perfunctory response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing? Oh, just messing about with other people's money."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he drifted out, she made the mistake of asking him
      where he was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, Tor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question can be irritating to the normal man, but even
      more irritating to a philanderer who has adventures to
      conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To church, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irony is unpleasant in a young husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was only asking--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The days of my catechism are over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had a streak of her mother's temper. "Well, you never
      tell me anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't that prove my innocence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, stop being sarcastic. I won't stand it. You are away
      all day, and I might expect--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me to stay at home and play with the baby. Sweet tableau,
      returning father plays with small son."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had dined, and Rose pushed back her chair, and walked
      out through the french window into the garden. She passed
      out in silence. She picked up a book from a chair and sat
      down and pretended to read. These petty wrangles were
      beginning to hurt her. Hector poured a last tot of whisky
      into his glass, drank it down, wiped his mouth with his
      napkin, got up and looked at himself in the mirror over the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sulks!" he thought. "And I'm a damned good-looking fellow.
      Suppose it's the fate of damned good-looking fellows to
      have jealous wives."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a cigarette, went for his hat and strolled out
      into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dutiful husband come to report. I've got a game of pills
      on at the Yacht Club."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose did not reply. She was beginning to wonder about this
      husband of hers, and, now that the glamour had gone, it was
      with a vague fear that she watched the man and not the
      lover. Even the sex-love that she had had for him was
      fading. That he was coldly and assertively selfish was
      becoming more evident to her day by day. Also, for a young
      man he was--in the vulgar parlance--too fond of the whisky
      bottle; and yet the prestige of possession still mattered
      to her, and, like many a worried young wife, she wished to
      keep what was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose badly needed a friend, and she had no friend. Her
      husband had extruded her mother from the ménage, and, if
      she thought of appealing to her mother, that dream was to
      be dashed with sardonic thoroughness. Clara Pomeroy was
      moving towards a second intervention, and with a motive
      that was to bewilder and shock her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this wilful estrangement "Mon Repos" and "Highfield"
      might have been miles apart, but one morning Gates appeared
      with the carriage and a letter.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>My dear Daughter,</i> said the letter<i>, I have sent
      the carriage for you. Leave Georgie with his Nannie. I have
      a very serious communication to make to you. It does not
      concern Hector in any direct sense.<br>
      <br>
      I am waiting in for you.<br>
      <br>
      Your Mother.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Why all this mystery, and what did it portend? Was her
      mother ill, and had she kept secret some thorn in the
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose decided to go to "Highfield," and she went like a lamb
      to the slaughter, utterly unprepared for the incredible
      truth that was to be told to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy had staged the scene. She was in bed, with the
      blinds drawn, playing the grim old game of "The Devil was
      sick, the Devil a saint would be." She put out a languid
      hand to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit by me, my dear child. But, wait, make sure
      that there is no one about."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery deepened. Her mother's mood was a challenge to
      Rose's caution. Was it sincere, or a masquerade in the
      dressing of the emotions? Rose went out on to the landing
      and listened, and hearing no movement anywhere re-entered
      the room, closed the door, and sat down beside her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a confession to make to you, child. It has worried
      me for years. I had the strength to carry it alone, but I
      am not the woman I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose's eyes were fixed upon her mother's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More serious than you suspect, I'm afraid. It concerns
      your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose's eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he died before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, he is alive and you know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother! Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "James Slade is your father."
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Rose's first reaction was one of utter incredulity. She did
      not believe her mother, but when Mrs. Pomeroy began to give
      chapter and verse, and to quote the whole sorry story to
      her, her daughter's incredulity changed to anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, why didn't you tell me before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was equal to playing pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I wanted to spare you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why tell me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, darling, I wanted someone to share the secret
      with me. I have borne it alone--so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose's anger was not to be turned aside. It was like the
      intuitive anger of the young animal that has been hurt and
      frightened. The reality and its implications shocked her.
      She felt her world brittle under her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was sent to prison for--fraud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, seven years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother, why did you bring the wretched old man here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This, indeed, was the cry of Mrs. Pomeroy's daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because something had to be done with him. I wanted to
      give him a chance to--make some sort of restitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--into the hotel, as a servant! How terrible of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For him, or for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For everybody. Does anyone know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he has never--told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. He did not dare to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose sat rigid, shocked, staring across her mother's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The disgrace! The boy! Hector! My son's grandfather
      was--a--. If it were known--. It would mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy gave a sound very like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think of what I have suffered. You let your
      husband be rude to me. You drive me out of your house--the
      house I gave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't be--kept away, and have my daughter and my
      grandchild taken from me. I can't bear it any longer. I
      won't bear it. If Hector is still unkind to me--I shall--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a lonely old woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, you wouldn't tell him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what I might not do if he makes me
      so--unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose went white. Her anger wilted, and in its place
      trembled a cold and immoderate fear. If Hector were to
      discover that she was the daughter of old Slade, an
      ex-convict who had been a hotel porter and now kept a shop:
      If other people--! The poor little snob in Rose was scared.
      She sat and stared, and was devastated by the reality of
      her mother's reckless rages and the social earthquakes they
      might produce. Her young face suddenly bleak and ravaged,
      she groped for some inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, you couldn't do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy's hands lay flaccid, palms upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I don't know. I'm a tired old woman. I want
      people to be kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose bent over her mother, and got hold of one large,
      flaccid hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course we'll be kind to you. I'm sorry that Hector--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want Hector to treat me as I should be treated. I've
      done so much--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you have. I'll speak to Hector. He's selfish and
      thoughtless--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy drew her daughter down to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a lonely old woman. I did everything--for your sake. I
      don't want to be shut out--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shan't be, mother. I promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiss me, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened and almost shivering Rose kissed her mother.
      She was like a child who had been soused in icy water, and
      was still half-frozen by the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make Hector understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      But could she make him understand? Her husband was becoming
      to her like a stranger who told her nothing, and did not
      listen to what she said.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Had James Slade listened to these two voices he might have
      understood that there was much of the mother in the
      daughter, and that in each of them these splurges of
      emotion were essentially selfish. Perhaps, not wholly so in
      Rose, whose maternity was younger than the matriarchy of
      her mother. Mr. Slade might have stood like Hamlet, posed
      by his own conflicting responses. Cynicism or compassion,
      which was it to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was driven back to "Mon Repos," but the irony of the
      little house's name was lost upon her, even as Mrs. Hector
      Hallard had lost herself in her poor, girlish snobbery. She
      ran upstairs to the nursery where her small son was asleep.
      She knelt down by the cot and gazed at him, and shed a few
      tears for him and for herself. Those idle words of Hector's
      recurred to her. "He looks like that old fellow--Slade" She
      gazed at the sleeping child and the protest in her was
      inevitable. Of course, there was no likeness between her
      boy and that wretched old man. Poor James Slade received no
      pity in that picture, no daughterly tenderness. He was an
      incubus, a haunting ghost, a wretched old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, no one shall ever know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The respectable fear of that which is not respectable may
      be the worst sort of cowardice, but a careful selfishness
      had made of Mrs. Pomeroy's daughter a coward. She did not
      see James Slade as James Slade. She saw him as a senile
      threat to her poor little snob world. And then, George
      Hereward woke up, and stared with surprised blue eyes at
      his mother, and, seeing her face all funny, he became
      imitative; his small face crumpled; he began to howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gathered him up, in a passion of protective
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, darling, the horrid old man shall never
      spoil your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not revealed to her that her father possessed more
      than secret shame, and that some day she might discover
      through him--humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose set herself to her task with pathetic eagerness and
      girlish guile. Her husband had to be persuaded into
      suffering her mother. Peace between them must be procured
      at any price. She tried to be very charming to her husband,
      bought two new frocks at Mr. Golightly's, discovered a new
      way of dressing her hair, and was ready to provoke Hector
      to a fresh outbreak of amorousness. She refrained from
      asking questions. His chair in the garden and his whisky
      were ready for him when he returned from the city. She sat
      doucely sewing, or waiting upon her lord's will. She took
      more trouble with the catering, and was careful to order
      the dishes that he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he grew restless and made some excuse for leaving her,
      she was bright and consenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, dear, go out and enjoy yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, she was the perfect wife, and yet her girlish
      guile had but one result, the provoking in this young cynic
      and sensualist of a mean suspicion. Why all this thusness?
      What was Rose's game? Had she some ulterior motive, or was
      she so much in love with him that she was becoming silly
      and sentimental? Hector Hallard was piqued no longer by any
      amorous tricks his wife might play on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having prepared her ground, Rose thought it ripe for
      seed-sowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tor, dear, I'd like to ask mother in to dinner. Would you
      mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector was much at his ease, and eyeing with interest any
      woman who passed, provided that she was under thirty. As a
      matter of fact his taste was growing less catholic, and
      more tempted by jocund and experienced matrons than by the
      very young.
    </p>
    <p>
      His response was laconic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose continued to stitch away at a baby-frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear mother, she wants to be friends. I think she
      understands--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector gave his wife a considering look. Was all this
      sweetness intended to make some nasty medicine more
      palatable?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she can come in and see you, can't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it isn't quite like that, Tor. She feels things.
      She wants to be friends with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, does she!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector sipped whisky, and reflected. What was the sly old
      bitch after? Did she want to squirm her way in again, and
      resume interference? On the other hand, he was in rather a
      mess financially; he had lost money at cards and on horses,
      and casual amours could be expensive. If he deigned to
      stroke the old cat he might coax a loan out of her, a loan
      that would become a gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, ask her in to dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose got up, bent over her husband, and kissed the top of
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's sweet of you, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband fidgeted, and frowned. Such sentimental
      displays in public were not Harrow and Hallard. Moreover,
      Mrs. Marwood happened to be passing by, and Hector was
      being tempted to the pursuit of Mrs. Marwood, a large,
      lusty, black and white matron with Come Hither eyes. Mrs.
      Marwood was vigorously vulgar, and a provoking contrast to
      a man with a sentimental wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Pomeroy was asked to dinner by her son-in-law and
      daughter, and to celebrate the return of authority, as she
      saw it, she sent the young people half a dozen bottles of
      champagne. Hector had one opened for her benefit, and his
      own, and the wine produced a kind of gassy geniality. Rose
      wore one of her new frocks, and was happily conscious over
      the evening's atmosphere, and grateful to her husband for
      his condescension and vivacity. He even toasted his
      mother-in-law and her grandchild, and apportioned to
      himself more than half the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was gracious. After dinner she left dear
      Hector to his port, coffee and cigar, and went up to see
      the baby. She had a present for George Hereward, and George
      goo-gooed at it and at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and her mother were alone with the child, and Mrs.
      Pomeroy was able to speak words that baby ears would not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, my dear, that between us--we can manage him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, baby, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      How dense of her daughter! Mrs. Pomeroy made clicking
      noises at George Hereward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the father. After all, a wife must learn how to do
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose looked pensive. Did one have to lie and pretend in
      order to keep the man one loved, and had her mother made
      such a success of her own enterprise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector was sipping his coffee, and considering an
      inspiration that had come to him with the wine. The old
      woman appeared to be in a good temper, and the occasion
      ripe for a little gentlemanly business. When Mrs. Pomeroy
      appeared in the garden, leaving Rose with George Hereward,
      her son-in-law rose politely and offered her the best
      chair. Mrs. Pomeroy sat down with evident satisfaction and
      the consciousness that she and Hector in evening dress
      staged a successful social tableau for Southfleet to gaze
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like another cushion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Hector."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector fetched the cushion and placed it behind her massive
      shoulders. Most certainly he was coming to heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you've had the hedge cut."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector, cigar in hand, challenged her sense of humour with
      a circular gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must see life. Some people don't need hedges."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost, Mrs. Pomeroy looked at him archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, how could you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and Mrs. Pomeroy basked in the sweet glow and
      the warmth of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and how is Sir Bertie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Making pots of money. Nothing like being in the know. As a
      matter of fact, he's leaving quite a lot to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid," said Mrs. Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector blew a smoke ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you wouldn't like a flutter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so. These new oil shares. I happen to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy reflected. She had a nice little sum waiting
      for a profitable adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me put you into it. Say--five hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Double itself in a year. Make the cheque out to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his mother-in-law was not the financial fool he may
      have thought her. Make out the cheque to him? The young
      beggar had some cheek! But, if she did so, and he tried any
      monkey tricks, she might have a nice little whip with which
      to keep the pup in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rose rejoined them she was surprised to find how
      genial and friendly the atmosphere had become. Hector was
      telling her mother a naughty story quite in the Hallard
      manner, and Mrs. Pomeroy, while pretending to be shocked,
      was enjoying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you naughty boy! Rose mustn't hear such--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector winked at the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we'll share the secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, out for his evening stroll, happened to pass
      "Mon Repos" while this family party was enjoying the air
      and the sunset and each other. Hector had just finished
      another story, and the ladies were laughing. Mr. Slade,
      though he was not part of the picture, felt that politeness
      prompted him to raise his hat, but no one of the three took
      any notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade passed on, presuming that he had not been
      observed or recognised, but his daughter had seen him, and
      had responded with a little secret shudder. That wretched
      old man; just like a ghost at the party!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector, too, had not missed the passing of Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, there goes that funny old codger. I suppose Mrs.
      Hector Hallard will soon be taking our dear son to old
      Slade's shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, and it was Mrs. Pomeroy who broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, perhaps on the darling's first birthday."
    </p>

    <p>
      In the days of George IV Hector Hallard might have lived as
      a distinguished and elegant young gentleman who drank
      himself under the table, whored as he pleased, left his
      bills unpaid, and been coolly insolent to all and sundry.
      And yet not quite so, for even the England of the Bucks was
      not uninspired by a severe respectability. In later days
      gentlemanly rotters might be sent to the Colonies, and
      bribed to remain there, somewhat to the detriment of the
      Mother Country's reputation. For such an Exodus Our Hector
      Hallard was not yet socially eligible. He was obsessed by a
      serene and impertinent assurance that, if he landed in a
      bog-hole, his relations would be compelled to save a
      scandal and pull him out. Such sacrifices were his due, for
      youth may be so sure that nothing unseemly can happen to a
      public schoolboy and a 'Varsity Blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequence of events, as they revealed gradually to James
      Slade, painted a minor "Rake's Progress." Clara had left
      him in peace, nor did he suspect that his identity had been
      discovered to his daughter, and this ignorance led him to
      do a thing, that provoked strange embarrassment in Mrs.
      Hector Hallard. Christmas came again, and Mr. Slade was
      moved to believe that he could make an innocent present to
      his grandson. Surely old Slade of the Caroline Hotel could
      present Miss Rose's child with a Christmas toy? He chose a
      very fine white rabbit with boot-button black eyes, packed
      it in a box, and two nights before Christmas Eve, he
      toddled off to "Mon Repos" with his parcel. He opened the
      garden gate, and, walking up the path, he became aware of
      voices, voices so loud and combative that he paused to
      listen. Two people appeared to be shouting at each other,
      and their voices were like angry birds battling in the air.
      No Christmas Carol, this! Mr. Slade stood hesitant, rubbing
      his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One voice was sufficiently familiar to him, his wife's. She
      was in one of her tempestuous rages, when all
      self-restraint was blown to tatters. And the man? Mr. Slade
      could only conclude that it was her son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strident was the woman's voice that Mr. Slade could hear
      much of what she said. She was shouting like a fishwife, as
      though advertising her anger to all Southfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've robbed me. I don't care who you are. I'll expose
      you to Sir Bertie. And I know where the money has gone. On
      women, my lad, on that vulgar amateur tart--Mrs. Marwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade shivered. Well--really! This human cacophony
      suggested a parrot-house in full scream, shattered glass,
      the rending of calico. The young man's voice sounded a
      minor note. The virago was triumphant. She called him a
      scoundrel and an adulterer in the good old-fashioned
      manner. And Mr. Slade wondered. Where was the young wife
      during this tornado? Upstairs with her child? His surmise
      was correct. Rose had locked the nursery door, and was
      sitting by the fire, holding George Hereward in her arms.
      The discordant argument below had sent the boy off into
      terrified howlings, but his mother had comforted him,
      though it was she who needed comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade hesitated. Then, the Spirit of the Lord moved
      him. Something should be done to silence those unhappy
      voices. Mr. Slade walked up to the door, and not only rang
      the bell, but worked vigorously upon the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, sudden and shocked. Mr. Slade could hear
      Clara's voice faint yet admonishing. Maybe, Hector had
      welcomed the intervention, and had turned to answer the
      summons. Then there came another sound, footsteps in the
      hall. The door opened, and Mr. Slade saw his daughter
      before him with a face that looked dead, and dry of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade raised his hat, and held out the parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little present from the shop, Mrs. Hallard, for the boy.
      Pray accept it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter's face seemed to melt into sudden emotion. She
      put out her two hands, and took the parcel into her bosom.
      Her lips moved. Her voice was a blurred whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, my dear, and a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he paused in time. No Happy Christmas here! She looked
      so helpless that he drew the door to for her, holding it by
      the knocker, and the gentle thud it made had a note of dull
      finality.
    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>
      Tempests and tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had become Niobe, weeping for her lost illusions, and
      a wet and wounded wife may more easily persuade a man that
      the state of marriage can be more insufferable than the
      activities of the proverbial mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became known in Southfleet that Mr. Hector Hallard had
      disappeared. So had that jocund and cheerful animal--Mrs.
      Marwood. Mr. Marwood, a little, blonde rabbit of a man, was
      left lamenting, not his wife's absence, but the money that
      she had inherited from her father, who had been a
      prosperous butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Eliza who brought the news to Mr. Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's done a bunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was rearranging some of the toys in a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Hallard. And they say that Marwood woman has gone,
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade pushed a toy cannon into position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it is--a merciful release, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know about that. Leaving a nice little wife
      and a child. A rank bad lot, that's what he is and always
      will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade laid hands on a box of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, perhaps not, Eliza. Southfleet was not exactly
      the right playground for a Hector."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza folded her arms over her bosom. She would condone no
      such piracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I says is, what'll she do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mrs. P. Her Tower of Babel's come down flop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, perhaps not, Eliza."
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, Mr. Slade was in a very negative and humanitarian
      mood! Eliza left him to his window-dressing, and people who
      came to the shop that morning found Mr. Slade very
      absent-minded. He returned too much change to one lady, and
      charged a small person fourpence for an eightpenny rubber
      doll. For, Mr. Slade was thinking, "What will happen now?
      What will become of 'Mon Repos'? Where will she live?" Mr.
      Slade was learning to shrug his shoulders over certain
      frailties, and to realise that Hector Hallard was but a
      symbol of the common, carnal man, envied in secret by most
      of the vulgar, and differing from Tom, Dick and Harry only
      in his opportunities and his success. Hector Hallard was
      but the average, incorrigibly lazy and dishonest
      Anglo-Saxon writ large, and that was all that could be said
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was left with her child. She might be the happier for
      that--in the end. There is hope in a child, if in his first
      five years he can be persuaded to absorb prides and
      prejudices more tempered and more sensitive than those of
      the common lout who will slink and rob and loaf when
      authority is round the corner. Mr. Slade might be a child
      of God, but he had no illusions about the venality of the
      common man. It had become apparent to James Slade that
      women were more the creatures of conscience, and of courage
      than their men-folk. Women stood by Christ, when his dear
      disciples fled. Judas sold him; Peter denied him. It was a
      mistake to expect too much from men.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, taking his evening stroll, found that "Mon
      Repos" was empty and to let. Well, this poor little
      love-nest had not weathered much foul weather. And where
      were Rose and her small boy? Gossip had it that Mrs.
      Pomeroy had taken her daughter and grandson to Dieppe for a
      month, so that Rose could recover her countenance among
      strangers. Countenance! Face--as the Orientals called it.
      What a nuisance to be compelled to remember to keep your
      countenance in order! A happy face should be able to look
      after itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade strolled on. He supposed that proceedings for
      divorce were in action, which was true. Mr. Grigson had the
      matter in hand. Mr. Slade came to "Highfield House." The
      gates were closed, as though to ensure a decent privacy,
      but Mr. Slade dared to open one gate for two inches and
      peer in. He was presented with a pretty picture, Mrs.
      Hector Hallard sitting in a garden chair with George
      Hereward crawling on the grass at her feet. Rose was in
      black, as though mourning a mate who morally was dead. She
      was neither reading nor working, but just watching her
      small son playing on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then another figure appeared, marching with matronly
      sureness across the gravel, Mrs. Pomeroy, her fair hair
      grown grey above her highly-coloured and forceful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time for little boys to be in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was the voice of authority. Mr. Slade saw Rose
      rise with an air of consenting languor. George Hereward was
      gathered up, and transferred to his grandmother's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't want to go bed, Ganny."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs. Pomeroy, "Little boys must learn to obey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade closed the gate. So that was the situation! Clara
      had regained control, not only of her daughter, but of her
      daughter's child. Poor Rose, minus money and a home of her
      own, had been caught by those inexorable tentacles and
      compelled to live upon her mother's charity. Poor,
      sentimental, hero-worshipping Rose! And what would be the
      end of it? Would she rush into some second marriage to
      escape from her mother, or become the docile pensioner, to
      be gradually repossessed and controlled by a woman with a
      formidable temper? An evil temper ruled the household in
      which it lived, a dominant emotion, cowing those who asked
      for peace. Yes, did he not know it! Sensitive souls shrank
      from clashes with storm-fiends like Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade, returning to that little red-and-white box in
      the High Street, was welcomed by its atmosphere of peace.
      He drew a deep breath as he turned the key. Eliza and the
      cat would be sharing the kitchen fire with Ph&oelig;be;
      Eliza might be reading <i>Tit-Bits</i> after feeding Thomas
      on other delicacies; Ph&oelig;be would be busy with a
      novel. Thomas was a neuter, and sleek and large and fat. He
      was not tempted to go on the tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Eliza had said, "It makes such a difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade chuckled. Might it not be a blessing to the
      community if half the world's males were like Thomas? Or,
      you could become like Thomas when the fret of appetite had
      died down in you. Mr. Slade crept into the shop and lit the
      gas. He looked about him with a smile in his eyes. Yes, he
      was happy here, confoundedly happy. He had not asked for
      much, and more had been given him than he had asked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned out the gas. Upstairs, a fire and his slippers
      were waiting for him. He could sit and toast his toes, and
      read or dream, and no grating voice would disturb his
      meditations with the cry "James, poke the fire" or "James,
      where have you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat down before the flames, and contemplated
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, John, you gave me the rarest of all
      blessings--peace."

      A person may be disliked for various characteristics. Mrs.
      Pomeroy was disliked by her servants because she was
      determined that they should neither fool nor rob her.
      "Perks" were forbidden. Having run a hotel, she was a
      terror upon detail; her coachman could not help himself to
      oats, nor her gardener secretly sell the grapes and peaches
      from the glasshouses, nor dared they sneak off ahead of
      time. She imposed a discipline upon them which she did not
      impose upon herself. She kept her store-cupboard locked,
      but she did not turn the key upon her temper. And yet, she
      was not mean about food and wages. She fed her staff well,
      and they hated her. She imposed her discipline by force and
      not by persuasion or example. Gossip had it that she
      bullied her daughter, and smacked her small grandson. She
      took the family to church, turning out her carriage for the
      occasion, for she was becoming a heavy woman, with a bust
      that matched her formidable posterior. She was apt to grow
      breathless when climbing stairs. Her face was red and angry
      and commanding, her eyes more prominent, and suggesting
      some inward strain. She bullied her tradesmen. Dr. Richmond
      was, more or less, in perpetual attendance upon the lady.
      She suffered from blood-pressure, and Dr. Richmond never
      succeeded in curbing her appetite, or in curing her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had changed his seat at St. John's Church. He
      still sat in the side aisle for which he was responsible,
      but nearer the choir, for both spiritually and socially he
      was nearer to the Heavenly Choir. Strange things were
      happening to Mr. Slade. He had been asked to serve upon the
      general committee of the Cottage Hospital; he had become a
      member of the Local Board, and a mild embarrassment to
      gentlemen who wished to grind axes. There were occasions
      when Mr. Slade was lured on to public platforms, and he had
      even been persuaded to make a speech. His business was
      prospering, and so markedly so that he was compelled to
      take over the premises next door, and add them to "The Toy
      Mart." He now sold books and stationery, and employed two
      lady assistants, with Ph&oelig;be in charge of the new
      department. He was known to all and sundry in Southfleet.
      Some of the children were growing up, but they were not
      lost to Mr. Slade. They called him Uncle James, and to many
      of them he was friend and counsellor. Local watermen
      saluted Mr. Slade when he strolled along the parade.
      "Morning, Mr. Slade," and Mr. Slade was able to greet each
      blue-jersied man as Jem, or Bert or Conkie. Maybe he did
      not know it, but the town thought of him as "That good old
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Slade went to church, and was able to glance
      obliquely at the Pomeroy pew and observe those two faces.
      Clara was more than ever Clara, floridly upstanding and
      dominant, and unabashed before the Deity. Her daughter was
      different, thinner, paler, vaguely downcast, suggesting a
      secret and sad aloofness. She seemed to sit or stand under
      the shadow of her mother, like some pale flower overhung by
      a florid, flaunting peony.

      Yes, there was no doubt about it, Rose was unhappy, and at
      the mercy of her mother. Her husband's faithlessness had
      shocked her pride, and shaken the prestige which every
      woman cherishes. She had drooped, and in drooping
      surrendered to her mother's dominant temper. She was afraid
      of those storms which any opposition might provoke. The
      high and rebellious spirits of the girl had wilted, and she
      was in one of those sad and passive phases when misery
      melts into self-martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even her child was not quite her own. His grandmother
      interfered in the nursery, and either spoilt or scolded
      George Hereward. Any protest of Rose's produced some flare
      of temper or of reproof. Rose had failed with her husband;
      she might fail with her child. She was feeling a failure,
      and yet, when the self began to revive in her, it was for
      and because of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was to remember that particular morning, a cold,
      bright winter morning. He was warming his hands over the
      oil-stove in the shop when the door opened, and Mrs. Hector
      Hallard walked in. George Hereward was with her, promoted
      to his first sailor-suit, plus a reefer jacket with brass
      buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade came erect with a sudden smile on his face. He
      did not know what his daughter knew, and the ultimate
      significance of this surprise visit was beyond him, but he
      did remember that it was about the time of George
      Hereward's birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange to address your daughter in that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Master George."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose's eyelashes flickered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr. Slade. I have brought Georgie to see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade and the boy looked at each other, and solemnly
      shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Georgie's birthday," said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many happy returns, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think a present is indicated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is why--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But from me. Georgie can have his choice of anything in
      the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's too kind, Mr. Slade. I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it, my dear. Birthdays only come once a year.
      Now, Georgie, my dear, look around and see what you would
      like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade studied the child as he glanced solemnly round
      the shop. Georgie was more Pomeroy than Hallard, and more
      Rose than Clara. The child had the daughter's eyes, which,
      incidentally, were somewhat Slade. Moreover, the boy was
      shy, with an engaging seriousness, and perhaps, like his
      mother, subdued by the Dragon of Highfield. He had a
      sensitive mouth, and a nose that was not Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, see anything you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie looked up gravely at his grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden smile on the child's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade put his head back and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, Georgie. Pudding or pie or Christmas cake! You
      don't want the whole shop, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the child, "that would be greedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade felt a sudden tenderness towards his grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We haven't looked in the window, dear, have we? Let's go
      and look in the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, and George put his hand in Mr.
      Slade's. They went out together, watched by the mother who
      had seated herself upon one of the shop chairs. Rose's face
      had a strange, inward look, as though some mystery was
      being revealed to her. Mr. Slade and the boy stood in the
      winter sunlight and surveyed the shop window. Georgie
      appeared to be posed by the number of desirable articles in
      it, and suddenly his mother rose from her chair and went to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not stand out there in the cold, Mr. Slade,
      without an overcoat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's face lit up for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, please go in. I'll help Georgie to choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was obedient to his daughter, but he stood inside
      the door and watched Rose and her son. Mr. Slade knew that
      the centre of the picture was occupied by a toy fortress
      complete with cannon and garrison, and Georgie's finger
      appeared to be pointing in that direction. There was some
      argument between them, and Mr. Slade, with a sly smile,
      gathered that Rose was discouraging her son's desire to
      possess a present that might seem too lavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that's not for sale, darling. Choose something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy showed no petulance, and Mr. Slade went to warm his
      hands at the stove. He heard the shop door open, and he
      turned about and stood rubbing his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, what is it to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like a--a drum, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade looked at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very modest request. Am I in error, but I rather thought
      that Georgie had his eyes on the fort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose's eyes met her father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, that's too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A promise is a promise. Let's hear what Georgie has to
      say. Now, my dear, would you like the fort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      George hesitated. He glanced up at his mother, but his
      mother was looking at Mr. Slade in a strange, fixed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the fortress it is, Master George. I shall have to
      deliver it, madam. It is too heavy for you to carry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost there was sudden laughter in Mrs. Hector Hallard's
      eyes. Then they seemed to grow misty. This old man was her
      father, and, in spite of all provocations, he had kept the
      secret. He could call her "Madam." She was conscious of a
      rush of emotion, of inward revelation. This wretched old
      man! Had she thought of him in that way? Her impulse was to
      throw her arms about his neck and kiss him, and say
      "Father, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes had a misty sheen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Mr. Slade, George, for the lovely present."
    </p>
    <p>
      George put up his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Rose kissed her father through the lips of her son.
    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade might have described the romance as "The
      Resurrection of The Rose." As for Rose herself, she may
      have dated the rediscovery of her self from that very day,
      and in rediscovering that virtue found in it a new force of
      resistance to her mother. A pensioner she might be, with a
      little pocket-money from the letting of "Mon Repos," but
      she began to stand between her mother and her son and to
      repulse too much interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were there to be scenes? Of course there were, however
      gently she might put that clutching hand aside, but in Rose
      the mother became stronger than the woman. She could say,
      "The child is mine. I will not surrender him to anyone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood pressure and storms! These scenes might be shattering
      to a sensitive spirit, but Rose found her justification and
      her consolation in the reactions of her boy. He began to be
      afraid of his grandmother, this stout termagant with the
      angry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, George. Haven't I told you not to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The child ran to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send the child to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose gathered up George Hereward and faced her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please leave him to me. You frighten him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I frighten him! What nonsense! Children need discipline.
      Put the boy down and leave the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose went white with protective passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, if you speak so--I shall leave your house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you little fool, where could you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose carried George Hereward out of the room and upstairs
      to the nursery. She locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stood at her knees, tearful and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, why is Ganny always so cross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granny is not well, dear. That makes her so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those visits to "The Toy Mart" were repeated. Rose began by
      finding some excuse to take the child to see Mr. Slade, but
      in a little while she had abandoned such excuses. It seemed
      to happen without a why or a wherefore, and with no
      exchange of questions or of explanations. They looked into
      each other's eyes and saw something there, and with quiet
      and mutual comprehension accepted it. Mr. Slade ceased from
      addressing his daughter as Madam. She was My Dear, and
      Georgie was just Georgie. The growing confidence between
      them was gradual, almost imperceptible, like the growth of
      a plant that may not be noticed until it begins to flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade could say to Eliza, "Mrs. Hallard and Georgie are
      coming to tea with me this afternoon. Can you give it to us
      in the garden?" Eliza was astonished. Fancy Miss Rose--!
      But, of course, they could have tea in the garden.
      Moreover, Mrs. Eliza, when she began to consider the matter
      in a simple and human fashion, saw no reason why snobbery
      should be served. Wasn't Mr. Slade good enough for the Lord
      God Almighty? Wasn't he respected and loved? "The Toy Mart"
      was much nearer Heaven than was "Highfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade had planted a Camperdown elm at the end of his
      garden, and, though the tree was not very old, it spread
      out like an umbrella and gave a circle of shade. Here tea
      was served, Mr. Slade himself helping Eliza to carry out
      the dishes, against which she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sit down, Mr. Slade. Good afternoon, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, Eliza. And how are you these days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, ma'am, but for my rheumatics. Well, Master
      George, you are growing a big boy, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said George, with his eyes on the cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat down beside his daughter. He was feeling the
      occasion to be strangely valid. Rose, in the shadow, had
      gentle eyes and a face of repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long has Eliza been with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever since--those days. She looks fierce and isn't. A
      good, honest soul to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure she should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade raised his white eyebrows. They were growing
      rather bushy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't take it for granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I think you might."
    </p>
    <p>
      George had been exploring the garden. He came and stood at
      Mr. Slade's knees, and looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got any snails here, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few, my dear, I'm afraid. There is no garden quite
      without snails, and no--rose--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he gave a quirk of the head and an apologetic and
      whimsical glance at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No life without--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Slade nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was pressing himself against his grandfather's
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you squash snails, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, I'm afraid I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ganny does. Ganny gets cross with snails. Do you get
      cross, Mr. Slade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I try not to, my dear. It is bad for the digestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Eliza arrived with the teapot, and George Hereward's
      attention became concentrated on cakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      How Mrs. Pomeroy came to know of her daughter's visits to
      Mr. Slade is a matter of conjecture, but hear of them she
      did, and the effect was volcanic. Her very rages were part
      of the inevitableness of the human scheme as it involved
      these three people, and perhaps not one of them was
      conscious of the gradually evolving pattern. Poor Miss
      Mossett was set to spy upon Mrs. Hector Hallard, a duty she
      hated, and though she whimpered over it, fear made her
      obey. So Mrs. Pomeroy came to be informed that her daughter
      was paying regular visits to Mr. Slade, that she took the
      child with her, and that she did not enter through the shop
      but by Mr. Slade's private door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy waited. The accumulation of anger in her was a
      fermentation that produced gassy pressures of varying
      discomforts. Her daughter was deceiving her, a daughter for
      whom she had toiled and contrived, and whom she housed and
      dressed and fed. Rose was becoming the friend of that
      wretched old man whom Clara had sought to enslave, and
      circumstances had conspired to rescue him from her. Mrs.
      Pomeroy felt herself to be a most injured woman,, and her
      self-pity and her anger sang together in a scold's chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all happened on a hot day in July. Miss Mossett came
      hurrying back to "Highfield," trying to pretend to herself
      that Mrs. Hallard was treating her mother with great
      unkindness, though why Rose should not visit Mr. Slade was
      more than Miss Mossett could say. She found Mrs. Pomeroy
      trying to keep cool in the garden, sitting in the shade of
      a tree, and confronting beds of brilliant geranium. The hot
      faces of the flowers might have been in sympathy with Mrs.
      Pomeroy's congested countenance, but they flourished in hot
      weather; she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" Mrs. Pomeroy's eyes were like angry tentacles
      waiting to pluck the truth from her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Hallard and the child have gone on the pier, to a
      concert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With--that man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mossett looked as though she was about to sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, Mrs. Pomeroy's face was very alarming. It looked
      turgid, contorted, demonic. She seemed to be struggling to
      get her breath. One hand clutched a handkerchief. Miss
      Mossett was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do let me get you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy found difficulty in speaking. She lay back in
      her chair, and fanned herself with her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fetch me my smelling salts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mossett twittered at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's cooler in the house. Shall I--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said fetch me my smelling salts. I am perfectly all
      right, woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mossett hurried off. Had the telephone been available
      in "Highfield House," undoubtedly she would have rung up
      Dr. Richmond. Miss Mossett might be a frightened fool, but
      she did not like the look of Mrs. Pomeroy. Her mistress
      appeared calmer and more in control of herself when Miss
      Mossett returned with the smelling-salts and a bottle of
      eau-de-Cologne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you like some scent on your forehead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I should not. Don't fuss, Mossett."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mossett thought it best to leave the lady to cool
      down, but it did occur to her that Dr. Richmond should be
      notified, and Mrs. Hallard warned of her mother's irritable
      condition. Miss Mossett was still wearing her hat, and she
      slipped out by the back gate, and hurried to Caroline
      Terrace. Dr. Richmond was out, and all that the maid could
      tell Miss Mossett was that the doctor had been called away
      to an urgent case in the country, and no exact time could
      be fixed for his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might catch him at surgery hours, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What time is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Miss Mossett, and hurried off to attempt
      the interception of Mrs. Hallard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Mossett missed Rose and George Hereward. Mrs.
      Hallard had parted from Mr. Slade at the pier entrance and
      made her way homewards by way of the Parade and the long
      flight of steps leading up the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pomeroy was waiting like a large and angry black
      spider under her shadow web. She saw her daughter pass in,
      holding her son by the hand. Mrs. Pomeroy moistened her
      lips and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the child in and come here. I have something to say
      to you."
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Domestics have a strange knack of finding themselves in the
      position to observe or overhear some family fracas, and two
      maids were concealed behind the drawn blinds of the library
      windows. There was thunder in the air, and curiosity was
      challenged. Moreover, the windows were open, and Mrs.
      Pomeroy's chair under the tree less than thirty yards away,
      and her voice became so loud and angry that every word she
      uttered could be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So--my daughter has been deceiving me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do more than that. What do you mean by gadding
      about with this old scoundrel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most unseemly fracas so far as Mrs. Pomeroy was
      concerned, for the more she raved the cooler and the colder
      became her daughter's poise. Rose was ice to her mother's
      flaming temper, and her self-restraint quickened her
      mother's utter loss of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you realise what you are saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--not--realise! Well, let me tell you that you are going
      to realise that this is my house, and that I feed and lodge
      and clothe you. And what do I get for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose was standing, half in the shadow, half in the
      sunlight, looking steadfastly at that inflamed and angry
      face. Was this creature her mother? This evil, scolding,
      semi-hysterical hag! There was no anger in Rose Hallard.
      Shocked she might be, and filled with a new and sensitive
      disgust. Her mother had become impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peering eyes beside the blinds saw Mrs. Hallard turn
      and walk back towards the house. Mrs. Pomeroy was still
      shouting at her, but she might have been shouting at a
      statue that had been endowed with the power of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, come here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't obey me--this moment--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Could a woman go on believing that a grown daughter was
      still a child to be scolded and punished at pleasure? Rose
      walked on. She was not conscious of her body, but of a
      sudden purpose that had come to life in her. The two maids
      had a last glimpse of Mrs. Hector Hallard passing into the
      porch, her face pale and dreaming, her head held high. Then
      they fled back into the kitchen quarters to spread the
      news. Mrs. P. and her daughter had had the devil's own row.
      Rose was walking across the hall, suddenly comprehending
      her crisis, and that she was walking out of her mother's
      life. She climbed the stairs to her room, which was next
      the nursery, and for a minute or two she sat on her bed
      with a strange, serene, contemplative face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose, opened a cupboard, and took out a bag from
      under the bottom shelf. Deliberately she packed a few
      things into it. In the nursery George Hereward was having
      his tea, and to him appeared his mother, calm and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going for a walk, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see Mr. Slade."
    </p>
    <p>
      George crammed a last piece of cake into his mouth. They
      had left Mr. Slade only half an hour ago, but the boy was
      always ready to consort with his grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the nurse Rose said, "I shan't want you, Ellen. You can
      go out if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara Pomeroy, still deep and struggling in her morass of
      anger, did not see her daughter and George Hereward leave
      "Highfield," because Rose chose to make her exit by the
      back door and the stable gate.
    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>
      Mr. Slade and Ph&oelig;be had shut up the shop, and Mr.
      Slade had gone up for his tea when Mrs. Hector Hallard rang
      the side-door bell. Eliza opened the.door to her, and
      smiled upon mother and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Slade in, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, upstairs, ma'am, having tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's eyes had fixed themselves for a moment on the
      handbag. Now, what did that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up. Would you take George for a little while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why yes, ma'am. Come along, dearie into the kitchen. I've
      got some cheesecakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      George Hereward put his hand in Eliza's, and to Eliza the
      mystery was deepening. What had Mrs. Hallard to say to Mr.
      Slade that the child could not hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose turned to the now familiar stairs. How strange that
      they should seem friendly and consoling stairs! She went up
      them slowly, still carrying her bag. She came to the
      landing with its window giving a view of the little garden,
      and for a moment she paused there. Then she knocked at Mr.
      Slade's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade was sitting in an armchair by the window, with
      his tea on an occasional table beside him. He was reading
      the daily paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose opened the door, and stood there holding the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I speak to you, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's paper went down on his knees with a queer,
      rustling sound. It was like a little shiver of emotion. He
      looked at his daughter's face, and then at the thing in her
      hand. Good God--so she knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, my dear. Shut the door. Put that bag down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have left the boy with Eliza, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's hands grasped the arms of his chair. He half
      rose, sank back again. He was conscious of her glide
      towards him, the sudden puckering up of her face. Next
      moment she was on his knees, her face on his shoulder,
      weeping. Mr. Slade's arms held her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, Rose. Tell me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed, and he stroked her head, and patted her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--I can't yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your time, dear. Yes, that's right. Just let it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade caressed his daughter. Well, well, well, wasn't
      life strange! He had done just nothing about it, and the
      fruit had fallen into his lap. So she knew, and yet she had
      come to him. But did she know all? Mr. Slade's hand went on
      caressing her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I'll tell you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, my dear, do you know everything--about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think so. It doesn't matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade drew a very deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, life has been very kind to me, much more so
      than I deserve. I did wrong once, recklessly so, I've tried
      to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter pressed her face against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why need you talk about it? Everybody knows what you are.
      I do--now. I was a silly, vain fool--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never foolish, never wise, my dear. Well, what is the
      trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have left my mother. I can never go back to her. She's
      too--too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I understand. And--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've nowhere to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she sat up and, with a poignant face,
      confronted her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't think I came just for that, I came to you,
      because--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade's face shone out at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just--because? I see. Well, God be thanked for it. You can
      stay here, my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you see--what that might mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade nodded at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. But I don't mind--if you don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him, deliberately and lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are a saint."
    </p>

    <p>
      Romance was busy in the little house, and so was Rose in
      the room that was to hold her and George Hereward, when
      Death came knocking at the door, yet not quite Death, but
      Gates the coachman out of livery. Eliza met him, an Eliza
      who had been told things, and who was in a state of
      wonders-will-never-cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the young missus here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza considered the advisability of answering that
      question. A "no" might be a "yes" in this suddenly
      topsy-turvy world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that to do--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gates was hot and in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come off it! The old woman's had a stroke. Gosh, I
      tell you it was a job carrying her upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's eyes goggled under her black eyebrows. Lord God
      Almighty, what more sensation would this day produce!
    </p>
    <p>
      "A stroke! Is she bad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor sent me to try and find the young missus. They
      say the old woman's done for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she isn't no age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over-ate herself for years. And then her temper. Great
      snakes! Well, is the--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said Dr. Richmond sent you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's good enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gates went off to wet his whistle at The George with a pint
      of bitter. Gosh, what a day, and what a thirst! Eliza
      lumbered up the stairs, but she went to Mr. Slade's room.
      Mr. Slade was the master of all their fates. Eliza did not
      knock, but opened the door, to discover Mr. Slade lying
      back in his chair with his eyes closed, and a kind of
      visionary smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's--had a stroke. Dr. Richmond has sent for the young
      missus."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade sat up as though jerked by a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God, Eliza!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought as you had better tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="a35" id="a35">XXXV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade received that hastily scribbled note from his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It said, <i>"Will you please come. Dr. Richmond thinks it
      is the end."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On that warm and starry summer night Mr. Slade took the
      cliff road to "Highfield." There were lovers on the dark
      seats, and vague star-sheen over the sea, but James Slade
      walked like a man in another world, uplifted by the
      happenings of the most strange day. He saw "Highfield" as a
      vague black silhouette, a sombre symbol of the fading of
      human prides and passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to ring the bell when the door, which was
      ajar, swung back like some silent and mysterious door in a
      fairy story. Rose had been waiting for him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both voices were calm and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Richmond thinks she has had another stroke. She can't
      speak, but she is conscious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the doctor here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but he is coming back."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between them for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you ought to see her, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said James Slade. "I will see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose went with him up the stairs, opened the door and
      closed it after him. Mr. Slade stood a moment, looking at
      the figure in the bed. Mrs. Pomeroy had been propped up on
      pillows, but she had sagged down into a limp helplessness.
      Her poor face looked congested and asymmetrical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slade walked slowly to the bed. He sat down beside it,
      and placed a hand on one of his wife's hands. It made no
      answering, intimate movement, but remained flaccid and
      irresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Clara."
    </p>
    <p>
      The light from the lamp beside the bed lit up the
      half-paralysed face sufficiently well for Mr. Slade to see
      it distinctly. Clara Pomeroy made no sound, nor did her
      lips move. James Slade was conscious of a strange dumb
      hatred in those staring eyes.
