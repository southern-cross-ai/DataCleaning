<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p>THE twenty-first of December was an eventful night. In the
fashionable part of the town of Brightstone, in a house opposite
the corner house of Brunswick Terrace, and just two doors from the
Catholic chapel, sat two ladies, one about forty-five, the other a
young girl of some fifteen years.</p>

<p>"It is late, Arabella," said the older lady; "we had better go
to bed. Cuthbert will not arrive to-night."</p>

<p>"Very well, Aunt Alice," replied Arabella.</p>

<p>"But hark!&mdash;what is that noise in the street opposite?"
Just as the clock of the Catholic chapel was striking 12 there rose
on the still night air a fearful cry&mdash;"Murder!
murder!"&mdash;and Lady Alice St. John, tearing aside the curtain,
looked from the window. Lights were flashing in the corner house,
and a crowd was fast gathering; and she could see one man in the
grasp of a policeman, "Oh, heavens!" she said, "what has happened?
What is the matter?" she cried aloud to a man hurrying past.</p>

<p>"Murder!" he answered with a face of horror. "There has been
murder done there to-night."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who?" said Lady Alice. "I know the family&mdash;in
pity speak."</p>

<p>"It is the foreign lady, Lady Egerton; they've taken the
murderer under her window; he's an Italian," said the man, and
mingled with the crowd.</p>

<p>A few days after this event, the following paragraph appeared in
the local paper:</p>

<p>"A terrible murder has been committed at Brightstone, on the
night of the 21st instant. The murdered lady was the Lady Egerton,
and the deed was perpetrated in the most cruel and deliberate
manner, the unfortunate lady having been first stabbed and then
shot with a pistol. The guilty party was arrested under the very
window, one pistol in his hand, and its fellow on his person. He is
a foreigner, and gave his name Giulio Doria, strongly protesting
his innocence, and said he saw a man run round the corner; but
though he had none of the quantity of missing jewels (the supposed
temptation to the deed) on his person, he was at once secured and
taken before the magistrates. The most singular part of the affair
is, that Sir Angelo Egerton, the murdered lady's son, is reluctant
to prosecute, asserting his belief in the prisoner's innocence; and
a little girl, his ward, who was in the bedroom at the moment of
the fearful deed, maintains that the man was not its perpetrator,
but her tender age, only six years, renders her evidence,
especially at a time of such terror and agitation, of comparatively
little weight. The Bench thought there was strong presumptive
evidence against the prisoner, and fully committed him for
trial."</p>

<p>Some weeks after another paragraph appeared in the same journal
on the subject. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A most daring escape was made last night from Brightstone goal,
by Giulio Doria, who was awaiting his trial for the murder of Lady
Jesuita Maria Egerton. The night previous a woman, a foreigner,
calling herself his mother, was allowed to visit him, and it is
supposed that she supplied him with means of escape. He was located
in a cell on the third story of the prison, the base of which was
about twenty-five feet from the ground, the window protected by
stout iron bars. He got hold of a rope fifty feet long, and a kind
of drag similar to a butcher's hook, and this he fastened in the
centre of the rope, which was sufficiently long for him to reach
the ground from his cell by its aid. In order to get out of his
cell he had, however, to remove one of the iron bars, which, by
some means or other, he managed to do by cutting it at the bottom
clean through with a knife, probably also obtained from his mother.
Once outside, he wended his way noiselessly to the west front of
the building; but there an obstruction to his progress presented
itself in the shape of a boundary wall, twenty-five feet high.
Getting on to a coal heap, about four feet from the ground, he
doubled his rope, the hook before mentioned being in the centre,
and threw it over the top of the wall, working it about until the
drag got fast underneath the stone coping, which projects some two
or three inches from the bricks. He then drew himself up to the
top, and slid down outside, pulling the rope after him. After that
he got over a wall about ten feet high, and was once more at
liberty. It is supposed that Doria had some accomplice, as not the
remotest trace of him has been found."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The blue waters of the English Channel dance and ripple in the
joyous sunlight round the bows of a vessel that bears an exile from
his native shore. He leans over the rail, and, as he gazes on the
distant white cliffs, the tears that fall into the murmuring waves
are tears wrung from on almost broken heart. Vain to try and
forget; vain to try and flee from one's own thoughts!</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was a beautiful room, evidently belonging to a man of taste
and cultivation. It was handsomely but simply furnished; no light
modern tables or chairs that would bear no weight, were to be seen.
Indeed the furniture was rather of a past age than the present, and
suggested the idea that the room belonged to a family mansion,
which was in fact the truth.</p>

<p>Here and there, on brackets or a side table, were statues,
evidently the work of master hands, of a Bramante, Canova, or
Chantrey; one or two exquisite silver cups of Benvenuto Cellini's
stood on the marble mantlepiece, while in the centre was a most
beautiful antique vase, which some eighteen hundred years before
may have adorned the antrium of some high-born Pompeian noble.</p>

<p>There was a handsome book-case in a recess, and its contents
showed a high and cultivated mind. There you would have seen a
tribute from almost every country, ancient and modern&mdash;Greek,
Latin, French, Italian, and German; nor were even Spanish works
wanting, in a collection which ranged from the most solid
literature, history, polities, and metaphysics, to the lightest, or
nearly the lightest. There were only four large pictures in the
room, but those were masterpieces of art; and the most prominent
was one of Michael Angelo's grand scripture pieces. There was a St.
Catherine by Rafaelle, and one of Ruben's gorgeously colored
pictures. Opposite the mantlepiece hung an immense picture, a
Landseer, representing, life size, a gigantic Spanish bloodhound, a
beautiful, noble looking animal, and so to the life that, like Paul
Potter's famous bull, you almost expected to see it start out of
the frame. And on the rug, asleep before the fire, lay the original
of the picture. How a Spanish bloodhound came to be in an English
gentleman's house we shall see presently.</p>

<p>Seated at the other end of the rug was a slight, noble-looking
man, of stately height and commanding mien, with one of those faces
which once seen are not easily forgotten&mdash;unusually handsome
in its stern, statue-like beauty, and singular in the rare
intellect on the noble, grave brow, and in the dark eyes, whose
calm, searching gaze few could stand long. He was very dark, with
something almost Spanish in his complexion. But perhaps the fault
of his face&mdash;if it had one&mdash;was its grave severity, and
the utter absence of any color to relieve its darkness, rendered
yet deeper by the wavy masses of coal black hair, and the slight
mustache which shaded the proud, sternly chiselled mouth. In years
he was thirty two, but there were marked lines drawn across the
high, broad brow, which gave evidence of deep thought and heavy
cares that had left their traces on the proud, ambitious man, and
deep in the grave, wondrously beautiful eyes lay an inexpressible
mournfulness, a shadow, that perhaps gave them such a strange
beauty and fascination.</p>

<p>In one hand he hold a volume of Machiavelli's 'Prince,' and the
other rested on a singularly beautiful child of ten years, whom at
a glance you would pronounce a Spaniard, and as she leaned against
his breast you could see his likeness markedly reflected in her
face, strangely grave and thoughtful for so very young a face. It
had the same deep, almost regretfully mournful expression in the
dark eyes that his had, it had much the some cast of beauty; and
now, in perfect repose, had something of his sternness and proud
severity, softened immeasurably, but still there. Was she his
daughter? See the likeness between them, and the tender, almost
clinging way his arm encircles her, and now and then, as he bends
downwards, presses her head closer to his breast. A cloud seems to
hang heavily on them both, and link the man and the child closer
together. But she is not his daughter, for hear what she
says&mdash;"Angelo, it is four years to-day&mdash;four years since
that fearful night."</p>

<p>He drew a long, shivering breath, and bowed his head a little, a
very little lower, till his coal-black hair mingled with hers. He
made no answer, but he dropped the book to wind that arm about her
too, as if he feared she would fade from his clasp like a dream or
vision.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then the child said softly, "Angelo,
the grass is green over her grave, and the ivy has crept round it,
but she is in heaven, and looks down from above on the son she has
left alone in the world."</p>

<p>"Not alone. Oh, Inez, you are all I have to love!" said Angelo,
suddenly, and passionately straining the child to his heart. "Man's
mind and intellect may love and worship at the shrine of ambition,
but his heart must have a gentler love to fill its aching void, and
it is thy pure child-like image that hath grown into my love and
filled my heart."</p>

<p>The Castilian nestled her head against him with an action that
spoke volumes, and a bright tear fell on the hand she twined her
little finger round.</p>

<p>He spoke again presently in low subdued tones, and his was one
of those rare strange voices that seem rather the reverberation of
some soft music on every heart-string than audible by the outward
ear.</p>

<p>"And yet the day may come when I must lose my Spanish flower,
when my little one will leave me."</p>

<p>Was he testing the child? If so, the passionate energy of her
answer absolutely startled him.</p>

<p>"Never! never, while I have life! never while I live on earth,
or hope for life in heaven. Where you go, there will I go. If you
die I will lay my head on your silent heart and die too. You are
all I have to love or hope in; my very ambition centres in you
alone, who are all to me&mdash;a stranger in your land, a homeless
stranger, but for the love and shelter of your hand. Oh, Angelo!
you are all to me! Never send me from you, let me be near you all
my life, for in you is all I care for in life!"</p>

<p>The words were not those of a child; unconsciously to herself
she uttered words far beyond her years, words of deeper meaning
than she knew, though in the inmost recesses of her pure
soul&mdash;a child's, yet a woman's&mdash;she felt them
indefinitely, vaguely, but how deeply, let the loving heart of any
true woman say.</p>

<p>Angelo Egerton clasped the slight form of the child to him,
whispering, "My own Inez! my little one! never, never leave me,
darling; for my heart would be dead indeed, and my life dark,
without my beautiful Inez."</p>

<p>Long, long they remained so; neither moving, neither
speaking&mdash;her eyes gazing into the fire as she rested against
him, his fixed on the grave, dark young face which lay with such
trusting, confiding love upon his breast, reading the very depths
of the young heart which knew not itself, but which that night had
unconsciously laid itself bare to him like an open book, in which
he read all its wealth of a child's innocent affection, and woman's
trusting, pure love&mdash;a book in which, as the Chaldaeans of old
read the stars of Heaven, he read her future, his future; that an
indissoluble chain bound them together; that she must be his only
in life or in death. He released her presently, and took up
Machiavelli again; but for that night, at least, the living love,
and the memory of the sad past had softened the stern, severe man,
and the subtle, ambitious politician was the feeling, dreaming
man&mdash;dreaming dreams that were perhaps too bright ever to be
fulfilled. His dark eyes wandered from the child, who had sunk down
at his feet, and laid her head on Leon, the bloodhound, and he
threw the 'Prince' aside.</p>

<p>As the volume fell on the table the door opened, admitting an
old, white-haired servant, who had carried his master as an infant,
and had known his father before him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Everard, sir, has sent for your pistols, as you
desired."</p>

<p>"Who has he sent, Burns?"</p>

<p>"A boy, sir, but he says he can take any orders."</p>

<p>"Let him come up here, then, Burns, and then go and bring me the
pistols. I think they are in their usual place."</p>

<p>Burns retired, and Inez de Caldara rose. The next moment the
door again opened, giving admittance to a handsome,
intelligent-looking boy of fifteen, with something about him that
immediately struck Egerton&mdash;the man accustomed to read and
study human nature&mdash;as superior to his position; neither had
the boy that awkwardness so common to his class. He closed the door
gently, and his whole manner and speech had the innate grace of a
gentleman.</p>

<p>"I have come from Mr. Everard, sir," he said, and the bright
hazel eye went straight and boldly to Egerton, "about some
pistols."</p>

<p>"My servant has gone for them; and meanwhile," said Egerton,
with that gentle courtesy which is inborn in the gentleman, and
which the proud descendant of the Egertons, if cold and haughty to
his equals, ever showed his inferiors, "meanwhile sit down and
rest."</p>

<p>The boy obeyed; but Egerton, who stood quietly watching him, saw
the bright eyes wander round the room, and dilate suddenly as they
rested on the sublime 'St. Catherine' of Rafaelle, and a
half-smothered exclamation of enraptured admiration escaped
him.</p>

<p>Angelo half smiled and said, "Go and look at it as closely as
you like."</p>

<p>The boy rose directly, then hesitated, and coloring deeply,
said, "I hope, sir, I have not offended you. Indeed, I couldn't
help the exclamation."</p>

<p>Egerton merely shook his head, and a slight smile crossed his
lips as he said, "Enthusiasm is natural to the young. Examine all
the pictures."</p>

<p>Unconscious of the calm, dark eyes that were so keenly watching
him, forgetting where he was, the boy gazed entranced and wrapt on
them; but Angelo noticed that he left Michael Angelo's grand piece
and the gorgeous Rubens to return to the St. Catherine.</p>

<p>"He abandons our favorite for Rafaelle, Inez," said Egerton.</p>

<p>The child looked up, and glancing from the picture to the boy,
said, "Perhaps the Michael Angelo is too sublime for him to
appreciate."</p>

<p>It was a strange remark for a child of ten years to make, but
she had not been trained as most children are, and in many things
there was a precocity about her which sometimes gave Angelo a
deeper pang of pain than he would have ever acknowledged. Even now
a shade crossed his face, and he smothered a sigh, as he said to
the boy, "Are you fond of paintings?"</p>

<p>"I am passionately fond of paintings, sir," answered the boy,
with a flush on his cheek and a flash in his eye.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen pictures like these before?" said
Angelo.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, sir, never!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard the name of Rafaelle?" asked Egerton.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have read about him."</p>

<p>"That picture you evidently admire the most, the St. Catherine,
was painted by him," said Egerton.</p>

<p>"What, sir, that actual picture?" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is an original," said Egerton.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! he must have been a great artist; I wish I could
paint."</p>

<p>"Don't you like being an errand-boy?" said the child,
suddenly.</p>

<p>The boy turned sharply, and a dark flush mounted to his brow, as
he replied proudly, "No, miss; I must do that, or starve; but
though my dead mother was only a poor artist, she was a lady, and
my father a gentleman."</p>

<p>The Spaniard looked at Angelo, and her eyes filled as she said
pityingly, "Have you no father or mother?"</p>

<p>"No, miss," he replied, "both are dead."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Egerton.</p>

<p>"Walter Hargrave, sir."</p>

<p>"That is not your real name&mdash;your father's?" said Egerton,
bending forwards.</p>

<p>"No, but it's good enough for an errand boy," said the boy,
bitterly. Then he added hastily, "I beg your pardon, sir. I have
taken great liberties, but I shall never forgot the pictures."</p>

<p>Here Burns entered with the pistols, and the boy retired. But
Angelo leaned against the mantelpiece, and sank into a deep
reverie. He was passionately fond of the arts, and of art and
talent wherever he found it. He had been struck with the whole
appearance and manners of the errand boy, more especially the
admiration he had evidently felt and showed for the pictures, and
Egerton determined to learn a little more of the boy, and if he
found him what he expected, he was equally determined to take him
by the hand, and with a generous spirit like Angelo's, that meant
to start him in life. Consequently, it was at an early hour the
next morning that Sir Angelo Egerton, M.P. for Cambridge
University, walked into the shop of Mr. John Everard, Old
Bond-street, a good, old-fashioned, unpretending-looking place,
that had been established more than half a century, and had been
owned by the father and grandfather of its present master.</p>

<p>Mr. John Everard himself was none of your flashy modern
tradesmen, who put on long coats, peg-top trousers, and parson-like
"guillotins," and drive out in dog-carts under the delusion that
they will be mistaken for gentlemen or fashionable 'men about
town.' No; John Everard came of an old country yeomanry family. He
was proud of it, he was proud of being the head of so old an
establishment as Everard and Co (the Co. had been defunct twenty or
thirty years since); he respected himself as such, and did not wish
to be taken for anything above his position; he would have rather
felt insulted if he had been. He was just one of those people you
would call the 'old gentleman;' he belonged rather to the last
age&mdash;there was just a dash of seventeen hundred and odd about
him, for he clung to the dress of his youth. He wore a blue coat
with silver buttons, and knee breeches and black silk hose, with
large silver buckles to his shoes. He wore large massive old
fashioned gold spectacles, which his bright blue eyes, almost as
keen as in youth, scarcely needed, and in consequence the old
gentleman almost always looked over or under them, and if excited,
or particularly pleased or angry, he would take them off in order
to see better. You will not be surprised to hear that he was a
Conservative, so high as to have a tinge of the old Tory school, to
which in his youth he had belonged, and that he still revered
Blackwood's Magazine, and retained all his old antipathy to the
Wigs and the New Monthly.</p>

<p>Such he was, as Egerton now saw him, with his gray hair,
silvered by sixty years, shading his forehead and temples, peering
over the gold spectacles at each one who entered.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Angelo!" he exclaimed, as the tall graceful figure of
Egerton appeared, "I am glad indeed to see you, sir. I haven't had
that pleasure for I don't know how long."</p>

<p>"Very long, Mr. Everard," said Egerton, "and now I want to speak
privately with you if you are at leisure."</p>

<p>"At your service, Sir Angelo; walk in here," said Mr. Everard,
throwing open his parlor door. "Come in, sir. How is your little
one, Miss de Caldara?"</p>

<p>"The same as ever, Mr. Everard&mdash;never ill or ailing."</p>

<p>"My boy brought the pistols," Mr. Everard said. "You shall have
them soon."</p>

<p>"It is about that boy I am here to day," said Egerton. "What
sort of a boy is he, Mr. Everard?"</p>

<p>"A very good one, Sir Angelo; as good a boy as any one need
want," said the old gentleman. "I believe he has known better days,
poor child; but he never grumbles nor is too fine to work; and he
is true and honest as gold."</p>

<p>"Is he fond of reading, at all?" asked Egerton.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, he is; read, whenever he can consistently with his
duties&mdash;he never shirks them a bit, I lent him a few books,
and I assure you, sir, considering all, he is very tolerably read
and educated. I have my eye on him."</p>

<p>"So have I, Mr. Everard. Do you know if he has ever tried to
draw?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," said Mr. Everard. "Why, you see, his mother was
an artist. I knew them first two years ago, when she came to me,
poor thing, asking me to buy some water color drawings she had
done. They were really beautiful, sir; why they would have sold for
fifteen shillings and a guinea. She had brought her boy with her,
and had once or twice sent him on messages. Then she died suddenly,
poor lady!&mdash;for she was a lady, sir, every inch, born and
bred&mdash;and this boy came to me in great distress, entreating me
to lend him five pounds to bury his mother, promising to pay me
back in time. I gave it him, sir, for he was a right good lad, and
then I took him as my errand boy. Well, Sir Angelo, early and late
that boy worked. In the hours that I didn't want him he would go
and carry parcels or messages for other people, and would you
believe it, the Christmas after his mother's death he brought me
the five pounds in a beautiful little purse. Well, you know, sir,
it would have been like robbing the orphan to take it. I couldn't,
and I didn't; I told him I'd keep the purse, but the money I had
always meant to give him, and he had shown himself more deserving
of it by the efforts he had made to repay it."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything of his history, then, or who his
parents were?" said Egerton.</p>

<p>"No, I don't, sir," replied Everard; "except that his mother
once said her husband had been a colonel in the army."</p>

<p>"You said he drew," continued Egerton; "have you any drawings
that he has done?"</p>

<p>"I think I have, sir," was the ready reply.</p>

<p>The old man opened a drawer, and after some search gave Egerton
a sketch. It was a pencil sketch&mdash;a woman standing by a
stream, with an old church in the background, and the moonlight
falling on them. Sir Angelo was a connoisseur, and though the
drawing was very defective, and devoid of art, there was a vigor
and beauty about it, a life in it that instantly struck him and
told that the hand of an inborn artist had done it.</p>

<p>"This boy," he said, "is an innate artist. This sketch is really
beautiful, defective and devoid of art though it is."</p>

<p>"The woman's face, sir, is his mother's over again," said
Everard.</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed," said Egerton. "Have you any objection to let me
have this?"</p>

<p>"None, sir," replied Everard; "you're heartily welcome."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Egerton. "And now, Mr. Everard to the point. I
mean to rob you of this boy, and bring him up as an artist instead
of a gunmaker."</p>

<p>"Then, indeed, Sir Angelo, it's very kind of you, and just like
you," exclaimed the old gentleman, "for he seems very fond of the
art."</p>

<p>"I am going to speak to him this evening," said Egerton; "and if
he likes my offer, I shall take him away at once."</p>

<p>"How can any boy in his senses refuse such an offer from a
gentleman of your rank and position, sir?" said Everard. "Why, his
fortune is made."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Everard, he must do that himself. I will give him the
means, but he must make his own name," said Angelo, as he took his
leave. "Good day, Mr. Everard."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>In the fair town of Florence, in an apartment elegantly
furnished, but simple for all that, sat a young man by the open
window, enjoying the soft April air which fanned and stirred his
dark&mdash;almost golden&mdash;brown hair. He was quite a young
man, probably not more than two-and-twenty, and most strikingly
handsome. He had finely, classically cut features, with a broad,
imaginative, yet intellectual forehead, and a bold, prominent, well
defined brow, from beneath which looked a pair of large beautiful
blue eyes, deep, dark, and brilliant, yet with a softness in their
clear depths which gave them a peculiar beauty. But on his brow
there was a shade&mdash;</p>

<p>Not sorrow, but a shadow&mdash;nothing more&mdash;which should
never have been known to two-and-twenty years, and was painful to
see on so young a face, though it was only there when the face was
in perfect repose as now. The instant he spoke, or smiled, the
shadow vanished, and the whole countenance lighted up.</p>

<p>The young man was sitting with his back to the door, which was
ajar, and he was so wrapped in a dreamy reverie&mdash;dreaming, it
might be, of the distant shores of his native England, from which
he was an exile&mdash;that he did not hear steps&mdash;light,
almost noiseless they were certainly&mdash;enter the apartment, but
a low spoken "Julian!" uttered in a voice he well knew, instantly
caught his ear, and, with an exclamation of joyous surprise, he
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Angelo! you here, old friend!" and the hands of the two
Englishmen met in a clasp that none but Englishmen give, for a
moment in silence; and then Angelo drew forward a slight and
childish figure we know, saying:</p>

<p>"I have brought Inez with me, Julian."</p>

<p>"I am very glad. I often think of my little favorite," said
Julian, bending down and tenderly kissing the child; "why, pretty
one, how tall you have grown, just like the flowers in the
garden."</p>

<p>She smiled, and asked if she might get some.</p>

<p>"As many as you can, fairy," replied Julian; "only don't let
Leon trample on them."</p>

<p>His eyes followed the little slender form as she bounded away
with the gigantic Spanish bloodhound, and he turned to Angelo.</p>

<p>"She is very tall for ten years," said he, "and very slight,
very fragile. Is she in health?"</p>

<p>A sudden pang went to Egerton's heart that for a second held him
silent; then he answered, quietly, "She is very strong, physically
and constitutionally. She never is ill, she has an iron
constitution."</p>

<p>"She is remarkably like you, Angelo, both in feature and
expression," said Julian, "but she has too grave a brow and sad an
eye for ten years. She has none of a child's joyousness. She used,
five years ago, to be different."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Angelo, bitterly, "but that is dead. That fatal
night, four years ago&mdash;that fatal tragedy&mdash;quite changed
her. It has given her gray hairs at ten years old. And
you&mdash;oh, Julian! it is very bitter that you must suffer so for
that night's work. I must find that man."</p>

<p>"How? there is not a clue," said Julian Rothesay, sadly. "No,
Angelo, we must watch and wait. But let that pass. How is my
beautiful mother&mdash;Marion? I have not seen her since then."</p>

<p>"I saw her privately before I came," replied Egerton; "and I am
the bearer of a long letter from her. I will go to Inez while you
read it. Call me when you want me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Angelo," said Julian. "But, by the way, tell that
fairy she must call me Julian, as she used to do when quite little,
not Mr. Rothesay, as she did just now."</p>

<p>Egerton stepped out of the window, and called Inez to him. "Come
here, Inez," said he. "I have a command for you."</p>

<p>She came; and it was beautiful to see how her mournful dark eyes
and grave little face lighted up at the mere sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>"What is it, Angelo?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Julian is very angry with you, Inez."</p>

<p>"I see your lips smile," said the child, shaking her head. "You
are not in earnest."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," replied Egerton. "He says you are to call
him by his Christian name, not his surname."</p>

<p>"It would seem wrong, Angelo, and disrespectful," said the
child.</p>

<p>"Why, pretty one, you call me 'Angelo,' and I am two-and-twenty
instead of twelve years older than you."</p>

<p>"Ah, you&mdash;" said the child, and she paused. Angelo Egerton
almost involuntarily bent down and kissed the child's brow as he
said. "But he loves you and wishes it, and so do I, because he
does. Won't you remember and call him Julian always, now and when
you are grown up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will remember, Angelo," she replied, "and if it won't be
wrong, I like calling him best by the old familiar name."</p>

<p>"Angelo! Inez! come in," called Julian. He had read the letter
and put it away.</p>

<p>"Now tell me what you are doing, Julian," said Egerton. "How are
you getting on?"</p>

<p>"As well as I could hope, being so young," he replied. "I have
got some name here and beyond here, I am told. It is important to
get known. I have several splendid private galleries at my service,
and plenty of pupils. Yes, I am getting on, certainly."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, Julian&mdash;in three or four years you will
'wake one day and find yourself famous.' Such talent as yours will
make itself known."</p>

<p>"Ah, Angelo, I wish I could think as well of myself as you
do."</p>

<p>"Well, well, it is best as it is," said Egerton; "but remember
my words. I have another pupil for you; a young friend, a ward of
my own."</p>

<p>"Angelo, you are very kind," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Stay a minute, you don't know what I am going to ask of you,"
said Angelo. "First, give me your opinion of this," and he drew
forth the drawing Mr. Everard had given him.</p>

<p>Julian took it, and examined it carefully. "The artist of this
is untaught," said he, "or, at least nearly so, but he has
talent."</p>

<p>"You have exactly hit it," said Egerton. "This youth is now only
fifteen. He was only a short time ago errand-boy to Everard of
Bond-street. He is a gentleman, and the son of a colonel in the
Indian army, at whose death his widow and child came to England,
and lived in great poverty. The mother died a year and a half ago,
and the son went to Mr. Everard's. A little while ago I came across
the boy, and finding evidence of talent as an artist, I resolved to
bring him up as one, and to place him with you, not as your usual
pupils are, who have homes near. His home must be with you, for I
am going to take my little one to travel for two, three, or perhaps
four years; so that he will be always under your charge, though, of
course, you shall always know where I am. For all his expenses, in
every way, I provide of course."</p>

<p>"Angelo, stop, now hear me out, and don't let your pride speak.
Let me in some way return to you the kindnesses you have heaped
upon me for years. I shall never be able to repay them all. Give me
the pleasure, for once, of serving you. I will teach your ward for
nothing; from you I will take no fee. Angelo, you must grant me
this."</p>

<p>"As you will, my dear Julian. I perfectly understand you," said
Egerton, grasping the artist's hand. "Have your way on that
point."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring him here?" said Julian; "and, by the way,
what is his name?"</p>

<p>"Walter Surrey," was the reply. "I left him at the hotel; but
you must come up and spend the evening with me, and I will present
your future pupil to you."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said Julian. "I hope, Angelo, you are
not going to fly at once?"</p>

<p>"No," said Egerton, "we have plenty of time, and shall stay at
Florence two or three months. Inez shall travel as I did."</p>

<p>"How do you manage to leave England for three or four years, Mr.
Statesman?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>Inez had glided away the moment Egerton mentioned business
matters, and he answered, with an anxious glance at the slight
figure moving amongst the flowers. "She needs a thorough and
lengthened change. Her spirits have never recovered the shock of
that night. I am afraid they never will; but I will try what two or
three years' travelling will do. Longer than that I cannot possibly
be away, and even that, not very well; but still, better now than
any time hence."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of your re-election for Cambridge University?"
asked Julian.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply; "not much fear of losing that."</p>

<p>"The Conservatives, I see, went out in March,
Angelo&mdash;turned out by a regular Whig trick. You were in the
Conservative ministry?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but we shall be in again before three years are out," said
Egerton, quietly, as he rose; "but we must leave you now. Ah, here
is Inez. Come early, Julian."</p>

<p>"I will be with you at 7. So adieu till then," said the
artist.</p>

<p>"Till then adieu," returned Egerton.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p>Four years ago, at the time of Lady Egerton's murder, there was
living at Brightstone, in the little street by St. Catherine's
church, an honest greengrocer named Samuel Warren; but his house
was empty now, for Sam had found that other and larger
greengrocers, who had capital, carried off his little business, and
Sam wisely cast in his mind the utility of removing to some place
where there was less competition. The first thing was to find such
a place, and one morning Sam said to his next door neighbor, a
working clock-maker and jeweller, "Brown, I'm going to leave
Brightstone."</p>

<p>"What for?" said Brown, withdrawing his pipe. "I am sorry, for
you're a jolly neighbor. Says I to my old woman, 'Nancy,' says I,
'Sam Warren's the nicest chap I've knowed this long while.'"</p>

<p>"Thank ye," said Sam. "You see I must go, or the lean wolf, as
they say, will be at my door. There's too many in my line set up
here&mdash;flashy chaps, who've got more tin to go upon; and as 'a
shilling always beats a groat,' you know, Brown, I must go to some
place where there's less people in my line."</p>

<p>"And have you heard tell o' such a place yet?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>"No," replied Sam. "I must look about."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you try Falcontower, up on the north coast,
where that 'ere old castle is as belongs to the Egertons," said
Brown. "I'm a Falcontower man, you know."</p>

<p>"Are you?" said Sam. "But it's quite a town, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, praps rather larger than will suit your ticket," replied
Brown. "Try Forest Moor. I was there a short while, and it's a very
decent little sort o' place, and there ain't any regular
greengrocer in it."</p>

<p>"Well, but look here, Joe," said Sam, sticking his hands in his
pockets, "at t'other place there's a castle&mdash;now if I could
get the custom there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but you can't," said Brown, "'cause as how there's orchards
and kitchen gardens, and all so that everything's grow'd in the
grounds. Why, the head gardener there has a tidy berth, I promise
you. No&mdash;Forest Moor's the best though the people at The
Grange didn't used to keep any company, or live handsome like. But
you see it's one o' those quiet, pretty little country places where
old ladies come who've got nothing to do but buy things and spend
their tin. Now ye see at t'other place&mdash;Falcontower&mdash;it's
a sea-side place, and to be sure lots go there, but then they're
tip-top ones, who like fine shops."</p>

<p>"Forest Moor for me then," said Sam Warren. "I'll go there and
find a shop."</p>

<p>Sam turned into his house, but a fortnight after he turned out,
and when we again see him he is 'located' in a nice shop near the
railway bridge at Forest Moor, of which place we shall hear
more.</p>

<p>As a new arrival, of course Sam knew nothing of the place or its
inhabitants, and therefore it is we find his wife standing one
evening at the door, gossiping with a laundress who lived near
them, and who was rejoicing at having some one to tell all the news
to.</p>

<p>"Well, ye see," she was saying, "this warn't much of a place
till twenty years, when the man as has got The Grange up yonder,
made the railway people build a station here in some way, and then
other people saw as it was a nice place, they built more, and now
it's quite a large village."</p>

<p>"Is that it?" asked Mrs. Warren. "But who owns The Grange,
then?"</p>

<p>"That's it," was the reply, "on the other side of the river, not
far off o' the new bridge. I've lived here, girl and woman, this
forty year come next Christmas, and I remember The Grange when the
old family had it. Ah, it was different then. The Surreys wor a
fine set, but this Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ain't this gentleman one of them, then?" asked Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p>"Lawks, Missis Warren, he ain't a real gentleman, this chap
ain't. He ain't never got a civil word for us poor folks, and the
good old squire, Mr. Herbet Surrey, always had a kind word for all;
but he wor very hard on his son&mdash;his only one, too. It's
more'n thirty years back now when young Mr. Armitage (that wor his
mother's name) came of age, and then he must needs marry a village
girl who warn't noways his equal; and his father tuk it bad, as
well he might, and this Stanfeld was the family lawyer, and I
always says that he made mischief. Says I to my son&mdash;he's a
sodger, my son is&mdash;'Yes, Bill,' says I, 'you may take my word
for it that Stanfeld's made mischief a' purpose.' The young squire
tuk his wife. She was good enough, but she stuck up to be above her
class; and though I allers sticks up for my own class, I says, keep
yerself to yer class. Some wor born to be high and rich, and some
on us poor and humble. The good Book says so; and so I telled Mary
Mason (that was the girl he married), but she wouldn't hear me;
though, for all her fine airs, she couldn't make herself a drop o'
real high blood. Well, they went off to Injee, so I've hearn tell,
but nobody ever hearn nothink of 'em again, and they said he and
her both died there. May be though as how Stanfeld could tell more
o' that if he chosed too. The old squire died soon arter, and then
somehow this lawyer, Stanfeld, got hold o' The Grange, and many
years ago he come to live here."</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;how sad!" said Mrs. Warren; "and has he any
children?"</p>

<p>"Yes; two of his own and a niece. His wife died four years back
in London. His oldest daughter is eighteen, and his second is
sixteen. She and his niece be at school far off here, but Miss
Eveline nearly two years ago was married here to a Mr. Arthur
Vivian, the wickedest looking man as I ever set eyes on. She lives
at The Grange still, but he's hardly ever there. Them's a bad set,
them two is at least&mdash;Stanfeld and Mr. Vivian&mdash;but Lor!
don't the little un, the niece, give it to her uncle. Forde, the
groom, says she's as perky to him as can be; so is the youngest
girl, Miss Theresa, t'other one. Mrs. Vivian was allas like her
mother, pretty, quiet, timid thing, quite cowed between her father
and husband, and since her babby was born, and died (it only lived
ten minutes, for I nursed her), she's never held up her head."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Warren drew her apron across her eyes. "I lost a baby
once," she said, turning away and entering her shop.</p>

<p>The woman looked after her, and a tear rolled down her own rough
cheeks, for she, too, had known losses, and not one, but many, for
out of eight children only three were living.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>"Time and tide wait for no man," says the adage. Eight years
have passed since the death of Lady Egerton, four years from the
time we saw Egerton and his ward starting on their travels.
Angelo's political prediction had been verified, for before the
three years had fairly passed, he received from his fellow member
for the University the following pithy letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"DEAR EGERTON,&mdash;Come home directly. The
Whigs have had a defeat, have dissolved, and the writs are out for
next week.&mdash;Yours truly,<br>
<br>
WILLIAM COURTENAY."</p>

<p>This was received at Bruges, and in less than eight-and-forty
hours Angelo and Inez were in England. He was again, and
unanimously, returned for Cambridge; but the Whigs did not long
save themselves, for another defeat compelled them to resign, and a
Conservative Ministry came into office, and with them, though not
in the cabinet, Angelo came in again. And this ministry was still
in power when we have to introduce the reader to the home of Marion
Rochester in Seymour-street.</p>

<p>It was about 4 o'clock of a January afternoon&mdash;a dull,
miserable afternoon, with the dusk already beginning to fall. But,
by the fire, drooping forwards, sat a fair woman. She was, in
reality, thirty-two or thirty-three, but she looked barely
seven-and-twenty, partly perhaps from the youthful grace and
roundness of her fine form. She was a handsome woman, and no one
could look at her without being attracted by her striking beauty
and the gentle, firm, and noble face; rich dark chestnut hair
shaded a forehead on which truth and purity had set the golden mark
of their beauty; but, with all that, it was the eyes that were the
most beautiful&mdash;dark hazel, bright and clear as truth itself,
and with unutterable depths of love and tenderness, but now and
then a shade, as of sorrow, would sadden them, as if some painful
thought or memory had passed like a cloud through her mind and
heart; much the same mournful expression that was habitual and lay
so deep in the dark gray eyes of Angelo and the black orbs of the
young Inez. Very heavy was their sorrow that had fallen on her;
very heavy was her sorrow that fell on them only through her.</p>

<p>Marion sat alone; for only the day before her daughter, or
rather step-daughter, had gone back to school. She had sat alone
for a long time, but she heard a well known knock below, a well
known step without, and as the door opened she rose to meet with
outstretched hands an old friend, to whom strange and strong ties
bound her&mdash;Angelo Egerton.</p>

<p>"This is very kind, Angelo, to spare me some of your busy time,"
said Marion.</p>

<p>"Are you all alone, dear Marion?" he asked. "Where is
Isbel?"</p>

<p>"She went back to school yesterday," was the reply. "Austin's
daughter is gone."</p>

<p>"Austin's daughter!" he exclaimed; "is she not your's too?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Angelo, yes," she replied; "but I love to call her his
child&mdash;it binds me closer to him."</p>

<p>"Marion, he has almost broken your heart," said Angelo. "You
have not seen his face for many, many years; you know not even if
he is alive."</p>

<p>She bent lower, covering her face.</p>

<p>"My sweet sister Marion," he added, "while there is life there
is hope. I have seen him&mdash;he is alive."</p>

<p>"Seen him!" she exclaimed. "Oh, Angelo, where&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"A short time ago I took Inez to see some of the Rotterdam boats
going. I was talking to a man when she called my attention to a
boat just about to start, by saying, 'Angelo, look at that
gentleman leaning over the taffrail. I'm sure it's Austin
Rochester.' And it was he. He saw me, too, for he bowed."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" murmured the deserted wife, and she was silent for
some minutes; then lifting her face, she said, "How could that
child remember him? She was only five years old when she saw
him."</p>

<p>"Listen, Marion," said Angelo. "She was barely five when I
brought her from Spain; yet two years ago, when we were in Madrid,
she called me to the window one day, by exclaiming, 'Angelo, look
at that priest in the street. It is Padre d'Alvarez. I saw his
face.' He had been her father's confessor. So don't wonder at her
remembering Austin any more."</p>

<p>"Speak to me now, Angelo, of yourself and yours," said Marion.
"I saw my cousin, William Courtenay, the other day, and he was
telling me of some bill you are filing against a Mr. Stanfeld, on
behalf of that boy you took up four years ago. Tell me about it,"
she said, with the restlessness of a mind trying to escape thought,
and Angelo yielded to it.</p>

<p>"It is a long story," he said. "I am filing a bill against a
trustee on behalf of Surrey&mdash;who is still under age&mdash;to
get the Court to remove this trustee, who has been guilty of a
gross breach of trust, which should in fact be felony. Nearly forty
years ago the grandfather of my ward, a Mr. Herbert Surrey, owned
an estate called Forest Moor, which is worth about thirty thousand
pounds, and he had one son, Armitage. He had also a friend, his
solicitor, rejoicing in the name of Stephen Stanfeld, whose
subsequent conduct shows him to be a deep villain. Just after
coming of age, Armitage Surrey committed a most foolish,
mad-brained act, which has entailed all this on his child; he fell
in love&mdash;as the cant phrase goes&mdash;with a village maid,
one of those infatuations that generally end in misery, and it did
in her case. He married this girl, upon which his father, the
squire, sent him just one thousand pounds, and from that time
disowned him&mdash;utterly and entirely, refusing all communication
to or from his son."</p>

<p>"What did he do then?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"Well, he had been intended for the Indian army," said Angelo,
"and when his father disowned him, he took his wife and sailed at
once for India, entering the army. But he seems to have been as
proud and haughty as the squire, and he never made the slightest
attempt at reconciliation&mdash;never wrote a single line, or even
mentioned to anyone in India whose son he was. Nor did the death of
his wife, five years after, make any difference in his conduct. He
trusted to the friend and solicitor, Stanfeld, to inform him if his
father died, utterly neglecting to make any enquiries himself, and
thus neglected his affairs up till the time of his death. Twenty
years ago he married again, a lady, by name Gertrude Norman, by
whom he had one son, Walter Norman, my ward; but Armitage died at
the age of forty-seven, twenty-six years after leaving England.
Meanwhile, in England, the old squire lived only five years and a
half, leaving a will by which he devised the estate to Stanfeld and
another in trust, for his son for life, and after his death to his
heirs male. Stanfeld and his co-trustee proved the will, but,
almost immediately after, the latter died. Stanfeld took possession
of the estate, but he never wrote to India, and though it was easy
to do so, he never made the slightest attempt to find Armitage or
to communicate with him."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Marion, because if he had, Armitage must have
heard from him in some way or other; but that wasn't Stanfeld's
game; he took possession of Forest Moor, and twenty clear years
passed without any claim being made on the estate or him. Seymour,
my solicitor, finds on enquiry, that many years ago he went openly
to live at Forest Moor."</p>

<p>"What became of Armitage's widow and son?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"Well, when Armitage died, his child was only six years old,"
replied Egerton; "but Mrs. Surrey assigned nearly all her pension
to trustees to pay the debts her husband had left, and came to
England with her child, where, as an artist, she managed to support
herself and him in great penury. About six years ago she died, and
four years back I came across her son as errand boy to Everard of
Bond-street."</p>

<p>"And he a gentleman's son!" said Marion.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Egerton; "the rest you know. And now I file the bill
to remove Stanfeld for breach of trust, and to have myself
appointed guardian and trustee; and, moreover, to ask for an
account for all those thirty-three years, during which our very
honest opponent has been enjoying his stolen goods. He ought to
refund some forty thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"You will never get it," said Marion.</p>

<p>"No," said Egerton; "but he will have to give up what he has,
and pass through the Insolvent Court; and probably the very estate
is neglected. So much for Colonel Surrey's culpable behaviour."</p>

<p>"What sort of a boy is his son?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"At present all I could wish," replied Angelo; "but he has as
yet hardly been tried. I must in another year put him to the test,
and throw him into the London world."</p>

<p>"Angelo, you are a severe man," said Marion, "Have a care, for
the ordeal is a trying one; and few can pass it scathless, as you
and Julian did. Tom was put through the ordeal, and fell."</p>

<p>"Walter will never fall as Tom did," said Angelo; "and Walter
will have my watchful eye and ready hand. He must stand his trial,
and learn his lesson as others do; for if he cannot rely on himself
entirely, he can never go through life. I am looking further for
him than he looks for himself." And Marion felt that Angelo was
right.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>Inez de Caldara was a singular being. From the ago of five years
she had been under the care of Angelo Egerton. Her father was a
Castilian count, with a pedigree reaching direct to the Cid, but
without any property to leave to his child, his estates being
entailed on heirs male, and his heir happened to be a fourth or
fifth cousin. He had only another relation, a first cousin Jesuita
Maria de Caldara, who had very young married an English baronet of
birth and rank, Sir Reginald Egerton of Falcontower Castle. Inez
had early lost her own mother, and when she was but five years of
age her father died, enjoining his confessor to send Inez to
England to her cousin Jesuita, who at that time was a widow with
one child, who had been called after her own father, Angelo. The
confessor wrote to Lady Egerton, and in consequence, Angelo, then
seven and twenty, went over to Spain, and brought the little child
away with him to England.</p>

<p>Jesuita was one of those noble-hearted, high-minded beings who
inspire in those intimately and constantly about them a love that
is devotion. By her son she was almost worshipped and reverenced as
some superior being, and the little Inez soon learned to love her
almost as much as she did Angelo&mdash;not quite, for his image was
first in her child's heart, or rather her love for the two was
different. To Jesuita she gave a child's love, for the gentle lady
was a mother to her; but Angelo was to her some superior, higher
being, almost worshipped, idolised with a love whose depth and
strength and force were scarcely even known to herself; it was
vague, dreamy, undefined, but not the less deep and strong.</p>

<p>She had always been a strange child, keenly observing and
thoughtful, coming out at times with remarks so far beyond her
years as to startle those who heard her, and yet, too, she was a
joyous, merry child, full of fun and high spirits. So she was till
the age of six years; but then one dark terrible night changed
all&mdash;a fearful scene of horror and bloodshed which she alone
witnessed&mdash;and when Angelo, almost broken-hearted, lifted the
insensible child from the corpse of his ill-fated mother, and bore
her away, there were gray hairs in the heavy black tresses which
swept over his breast.</p>

<p>From that time she was completely changed&mdash;all the
beautiful brightness and joyousness of childhood was gone, and she
became what we have seen her at ten years old and see her at
fourteen&mdash;silent, still, and grave; proud and reserved she was
by inborn nature: she seemed outwardly cold and almost passionless,
but in reality, from the day of the murder watchfully and
steadfastly bending every power and force of her mind to one
end&mdash;that was never for a moment lost sight of&mdash;never for
one moment swerved from.</p>

<p>Neither had she been brought up like other girls. From the very
first Angelo had undertaken the entire charge of teaching her and
bringing her up; nor would he bear the notion of parting with her.
Even Mrs. Rochester could not move him&mdash;and the tie between
them was no common one either.</p>

<p>"No, Marion," he had answered, gently but firmly, "I had always
intended to keep her and train her myself; and now, more than ever,
I adhere to it. To send her now amongst strangers would kill
her."</p>

<p>And Marion felt that he was right, and ceased to urge it. Deeply
engaged as he was in politics, Egerton always found time to attend
to his little charge. He taught her Latin, Italian, and French, the
two last principally as the Russians do&mdash;by talking to her in
those languages, in which, as we have seen, he perfected her by
taking her to the countries themselves. All the sterner studies and
reading he gave; and in the gifted and high intellect of the child
he had rich ground to work upon. He did more than teach
her&mdash;he trained that fine intellect and nature to an almost
masculine strength and self-control&mdash;a task made easy by the
effects of his mother's fearful death; for the terrible shock and
grief which had sown gray hairs in her 'youth's bright locks,' and
cast down from its temple her childish joyousness and impetuosity,
had put in their place premature years, and gravity, and thought,
and the one steady purpose of her life, that had been so from that
night, made her for that end train and school every impulse and
feeling, mental and physical, under the iron hand of her strong
will. Thus, even at fourteen, her intellect and character had a
sternness, strength, and power, almost masculine, and rarely found
in women&mdash;not always in men. She was a child in some things,
in others far beyond her years.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought, however, that Egerton had neglected the
accomplishments, for the child had talents that were not to be
hidden under a bushel. Himself an amateur musician of a high order,
and a passionate lover of music and its sister arts, he had early
found that the child was, like himself, a lover of all that was
beautiful, and for those arts he gave her the best masters.</p>

<p>When she was fourteen, Marion Rochester again ventured to
interfere, on the strength of a friendship which dated back many
years, for her first husband had been a close friend of
Egerton's.</p>

<p>"Angelo," she said, "you are bringing up your child
strangely."</p>

<p>"My dear Marion, is she not all I could wish?" he answered, with
his grave, almost sad smile.</p>

<p>"To you, who are a man, and a stern one&mdash;yes; to me, a
woman, no. I do not like to see fourteen years so grave and
reserved, caring nothing for the amusement most girls of her age
like. Here she has nothing but the society of men older than
herself, which she likes best, but is it quite good for her? Throw
her more amongst young people, girls."</p>

<p>"Dear Marion," said Egerton, "how am I to do that? You send your
Isbel to school, but you know schools are my horror."</p>

<p>"Send her, if only for six months, to one," pleaded Marion.
"Indeed, Angelo, you are wrong. Nothing can harm her, and if I find
a good school&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think the one exists where I would send her," said
Egerton.</p>

<p>"I have heard of one, where I mean to place Isbel after
Christmas," said Marion; "will you see the lady, and if it pleases
you, send Inez?"</p>

<p>"I will think over what you have said, dear Marion." It was all
she could get from him; but he did think over it. He saw Mrs.
Ashton, and resolved that the child should be placed there for six
mouths if the lady would receive her on his own terms&mdash;that
is, the freedom he should stipulate for. "He was willing to pay
anything she liked," he said, but he told her plainly "that his
ward was not like other girls of her age; that very painful
circumstances in early childhood had had a very sad effect, and
that as he sent her principally for companionship, he wished her to
have more the freedom of a parlor boarder than a regular pupil,
though she was to be thrown amongst the girls; he did not want her
'favored' in the slightest degree. All he meant was that in play
hours, for instance, she might go out riding with her groom, a man
who had been long in his family, and other such liberties not
usually accorded to the girls." Mrs. Ashton agreed, and so Inez
went to the school, and the old groom, John Wylde, who, like Burns,
had grown gray in the Egerton family, went to the village hard
by.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A greater contrast there could not well be than the Spanish Inez
and the English Isbel. See them standing together by the shrubbery
gate, the rays of the winter sun falling full on them; and say if,
personally, they are not a direct contrast. Isbel with her fair
complexion and golden tresses, Inez with her dark face and raven
locks, though amongst them the sunlight has found some stray gray
hairs here and there, which it plays along like rays of silver
light.</p>

<p>Isbel was just seventeen, but not so tall by some inches as the
Castilian, though she was slight and graceful, and her beauty was
enhanced by the quick, sometimes fiery impetuosity of look and
gesture, natural and pleasing in youth, and which, unfortunately
had been replaced in Inez by a gravity and calmness unnatural and
even painful to see in so young a girl. Isbel's skin had in
childhood been dazzlingly fair, but 'The sun with ardent frown, Had
slightly tinged her cheek with brown.'</p>

<p>In plain English she was a little bit tanned, as you could see
by lifting her rich hair, golden in the light, deep brown in the
shade, and exposing her white temples. Her face was one which, for
beauty of feature alone, would have pleased any sculptor or
painter, and for beauty of expression would have made you look
again and again at her with irresistible fascination, for there was
a whole world of thought and feeling in the deep dark blue eyes,
and intellect on the broad noble brow, that charm about the whole
face, which immediately attracted.</p>

<p>She was speaking as she leant over the gate to pull a leaf of
laurel.</p>

<p>"So you don't think you shall like school, Inez?" she said.</p>

<p>"A month is hardly enough to judge in," said the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"I wish you would speak out, you tiresome child," said Isbel.
"How do you like Mrs. Ashton and the girls, then?"</p>

<p>"Well enough at present," was the guarded answer, from a habit
of so speaking.</p>

<p>"There you are again," said Isbel.</p>

<p>"A word is enough to the wise," said Inez, half smiling.</p>

<p>"Proverb for proverb, senora," said Isbel, gaily. "'Beware of
the silent man, and of the dog that does not bark.' Really and
seriously, Inez, how do you like them? What think you of Theresa
Stanfeld?"</p>

<p>"Very well, I like her very much," replied Inez. "She is sharp
and intelligent, and has such warm feelings; but she is hasty and
passionate, and unless she learns to control her impetuous temper,
it will be her bane in life!"</p>

<p>"And Margaret Arundel?" said Isbel.</p>

<p>"Better still," replied Inez; "she is more stable and
self-controlled, but there seems a cloud over her which I cannot
understand in such a young girl."</p>

<p>"Inez, you are a strange creature," said Isbel, dropping the
leaf she had plucked; "did it ever strike yourself how queer and
odd you often talk, as if you numbered thirty instead of fourteen
years? What do you know of the world and life?"</p>

<p>"Does length of years always make up the sum of life?" said
Inez, with a grave smile that was the very same as Egerton's.
"There are many who live twenty years in ten; griefs and troubles
add years and bitter knowledge to a life faster than any reckoned
days and weeks and months can do, Isbel."</p>

<p>She raised her dark, mournful eyes as she spoke, and Isbel said,
almost passionately:</p>

<p>"Inez, how can you have known such bitter teaching troubles?
You, so beloved, with rank, wealth, and beauty, with all that makes
life happy and dear!"</p>

<p>"Is all gold that glitters, Isbel?"</p>

<p>Tears filled Isbel's tender, earnest blue eyes, but she lifted
the heavy braids of the Castilian's hair, and said gently, "Inez,
lift your heart upward and find peace and hope; for as silver hairs
have found their way amongst the darkness of your hair, so will
silver light find its way into the darkness of your sorrow."</p>

<p>Inez made no reply, but her head drooped a little lower, and a
heavy tear fell on her companion's hand.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Inez's eyes were fixed dreamingly on
the far-off distance, but looming as in a vision through a distance
of time, for with a mournful cadence to her heart&mdash;Other days
came back to her with recollected music.</p>

<p>"Inez, where are your thoughts?" whispered Isbel, softly.</p>

<p>"Far, far away in years that can never be recalled&mdash;that
can never, never return," answered the child drearily.</p>

<p>There was another long silence, but broken this time by other
voices; the bushes near were pushed aside, and Theresa Stanfeld and
Margaret Arundel stood before Isbel and the Castilian.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are!" exclaimed the impetuous Theresa, bounding
forwards. "We want your opinion. Don't you like the preaching of
the new curate of Yellowfield, the Rev. Cuthbert St. John?"</p>

<p>"No," said Isbel Rochester.</p>

<p>"I don't like him or anything about him," said Inez de Caldara,
decidedly.</p>

<p>"I am sure his sermon was splendid," remarked Margaret.</p>

<p>"Fine oratory&mdash;yes," returned the Castilian, drily.</p>

<p>"And do you think that a fault?" exclaimed Theresa, warmly; "do
you think all the good oratory should be kept for the House of
Commons?"</p>

<p>"Mere oratory is better there than in the pulpit," returned
Inez, in her quiet way, and by no means moved by the other's
impetuosity.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Sonora Inez, you are excessively impudent,"
said Theresa, laughing; "but it's anything but warm here,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is the dinner-bell ringing," added Margaret Arundel.</p>

<p>"And there is the postman going up the carriage drive," said
Inez de Caldara, and the next moment she had sprung across the
intervening grass, clearing at a flying leap several bushes in the
way, and stood before the postman.</p>

<p>"Any for me, postman?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, miss, I don't know but what there is," said the old man;
"let's see; are you Miss de Caldara?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then here you are, miss," said the postman, "and here's a heap
of others, too."</p>

<p>"I'll deliver them all; good morning," said Inez. And, taking
the letters, she sprang over a holly-bush and disappeared. Her own
letter she saw was from Angelo Egerton.</p>

<p>The Rev. Cuthbert St. John, to whom allusion has been made, was
a brother of Colonel St. John, an old friend of Egerton's, and son
of the Lady Alice already mentioned. The brothers were necessarily
much separated by their professions; and the sudden arrival of the
gallant officer at the parsonage was an equally agreeable and
sudden surprise to the rather straight-laced High Church clergyman.
His errand was partly to attend a grand ball given by a Mrs.
Melville, an old friend of more than one of the families playing
important parts in this history, on her son's coming of age; and he
was, moreover, charged by Sir Angelo with a mission to his fair
ward, and niece Isbel, who were also invited to the ball; and he
had no sooner exchanged brotherly greetings with Cuthbert and taken
some refreshment than he set out for Mrs. Ashton's to perform his
errand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>It was half-past 5 when Colonel St. John jumped out of the fly
he had taken on his way, and rang at the bell of Ashton House. To
his enquiry whether Mrs. Ashton was at home, he was told yes, and
shown into the same apartment that Margaret had been, where he was
left alone while the servant took his card up.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Ashton entered the apartment and advanced,
but Colonel St. John spoke first.</p>

<p>"Have I the honor, madam, of addressing Mrs. Ashton?"</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Ashton, sir," she returned, in her quiet, graceful
manner; "but I believe the name of St. John is unknown to me."</p>

<p>"Allow me, then," he said, smiling, "to introduce myself as the
brother of your new incumbent at Yellowfield, and here now as the
messenger of Mrs. Rochester and Sir Angelo Egerton, commissioned to
carry away two of your charges. This will explain it." And he
handed her a letter.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Will you excuse me?" And she broke it open.</p>

<p>It was from Marion Rochester, simply saying that she and Sir
Angelo Egerton would esteem it a great favor if she would allow her
daughter Isbel and Inez de Caldara to return with Colonel St. John
to the manor house, there to remain the following day and night for
a ball to be given there. She added certain feminine details
relative to ball-dresses, &amp;c., which not being likely to
interest the reader, we will mercifully leave out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton laid down the letter and said, "I shall be most
happy to comply with the request by placing the young ladies
immediately in your care."</p>

<p>"I am an old friend, you know, Mrs. Ashton," said the colonel.
"I have seen Miss Rochester three or four times, and little Inez I
have many a time carried in my arms. But I have not seen her now
for four years. Would you allow me to see her before we leave, as I
have a packet to deliver to her from her guardian, but only say a
gentleman wishes to see her."</p>

<p>"I will send her directly," answered the lady, inwardly smiling
as she retired at the idea of 'little Inez,' it being evident that
the colonel expected to find the little child he had left. He heard
no footfall without, but presently the door opened softly, and a
tall dark slender form stood there.</p>

<p>"It's Louis St. John!" burst in joyful surprise from her lips,
and in a second she had sprung forwards and clasped his hand in
both hers.</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" began the astonished Louis. "Is this really
Inez. Why, I left a child, and I find a tall girl."</p>

<p>"The same Inez in heart," she said smiling.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see my favorite again. I am very glad to see you
again, Inez!" he said, with strange earnestness; "let me look at
your face."</p>

<p>He laid his hands on her shoulders, and turned her towards the
light, gazing into the dark tender eyes, which met his with such
truthful childlike innocence and affection. When he had quitted
England four years before, he had left a child of ten years, and
when he bade her farewell, he had drawn her to his breast and held
her in his arms, and kissed her lips and eyes. Why could not he do
so now&mdash;was it merely that she had grown so tall, or that her
silk dress swept the ground? No, it was something that lay deeper
than that, something that, man of the world as he was, he could not
define, scarcely even feel as a distinctive feeling, but rather as
an instinctive impulse; it was not that she seemed to him a woman
or 'grown up,' for she did not, but she was not the little child he
had left&mdash;it was a strange vague indefinite feeling that had
shot through his breast when his eye met hers. He bent down and
gravely kissed the broad high brow.</p>

<p>"You are changed, Inez," said he, "and yet withal&mdash;Thou art
still the same, and the same heart I can see. But here is a packet
from Egerton."</p>

<p>"From Angelo?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was strange to see how eye and lip lighted up at his very
name and shed a beauty over that young face that was almost more
than earthly; it was&mdash;</p>

<p>The light of love, the purity of grace,</p>

<p>The Mind, the Music breathing o'er her face.</p>

<p>"I stand on no ceremony with you, Senor Don Louis," she said,
smiling, as she opened the packet, which contained a smaller one
and a letter. It was short, and was as follows, for Angelo rarely
wrote long letters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Inez,&mdash;St. John will explain to you
all about this ball at Mrs. Melville's. You remember him dining
with me last autumn. Not being able to leave town myself, I told
St. John (if you don't dislike it) to take you there as my
substitute. So remember to make all excuses for me. I have sent you
a little present, lest amid so gay a crowd my darling should
forget.<br>
<br>
"ANGELO R. EGERTON."</p>

<p>"He wishes me to go with you," she said, "and says you will
explain all."</p>

<p>He did so, and then she opened the little parcel. It was a small
jewel-box, and in it reposed a beautiful bracelet, made of
coal-black hair, with a gold clasp set with diamonds, and engraved
on the inside with Angelo's crest and motto, a cross and sword
bound with cypress and palm, and underneath in small characters the
words, "Faithful to the death." It was his hair she knew, and a
bright smile crossed her face as she showed it to Louis, and then
replaced it.</p>

<p>"I must go and dress," she said, "and fetch Isbel."</p>

<p>She was gone before he could look round, and for some minutes he
was alone. Then Mrs. Ashton and the two girls entered ready
dressed, and with a carpet bag. Isbel Rochester met Colonel St.
John with a graceful ease and ready recognition of him, which,
though full of kindness, was of course very different from Inez's
affectionate and childlike greeting; but Isbel was seventeen, and,
in fact, 'grown up,' besides having only seen him three or four
times before, while Inez was but fourteen, and had known him from
almost the first moment she set foot in England.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dears," said Mrs. Ashton, as the colonel placed
them in a fly, and stepped in himself. "I hope you'll like the
ball; and mind, you naughty Inez," she added, smiling, "don't keep
that grave little face&mdash;dance and be gay."</p>

<p>A shade crossed the child's face, but Colonel St. John said,
gaily, "Trust me, Mrs. Ashton. She is under my charge, you know,
and I'll take care of her." And, as we shall see, he kept his
word.</p>

<p>It was near half past 6 when they reached the manor house, and
Mrs. Rochester's maid, Nelly Warren, Sam's daughter, was lying in
wait for them, and carried off the two girls to be dressed for
dinner, which that day had been put off to 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Nelly conducted them up to an immense bedroom, containing two
large beds, strewed with dresses and millinery.</p>

<p>There were two ladies in the room&mdash;one was their hostess,
Mrs. Melville, a fine looking matron of forty; the other was Marion
Rochester.</p>

<p>"Ah, here they are&mdash;welcome, and thrice welcome, my dears!"
exclaimed Mrs. Melville, warmly, and Marion, springing up, threw
her arms first round her step-daughter, and then round Inez, whom
she loved as well at least.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see your dear faces," she said; "here, Nelly,
be quick, and help them to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>"We are ready," said Isbel, as Nelly divested them of their hats
and mantles. "We dressed before we started. Is my cousin Tom here,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," she replied; "Mrs. Melville, I am at your
service."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Melville; "come along into my room. You
two girls run down to the drawing-room, there's nobody down yet.
Nelly, show the young ladies the way."</p>

<p>Mrs. Melville was wrong in supposing the drawing-room empty, for
when Isbel opened the door she saw a handsome, jovial looking man,
who might have been anywhere between five and eight and twenty,
standing before the fire.</p>

<p>"Why, by Jove, if it isn't Isbel and the senorita," he
exclaimed, reaching them in two strides. Mr. Thomas Courtenay
(yclept "Tom," for short) gave his cousin a warm embrace, and shook
the Castilian's hand as if he meant to shake it off&mdash;in fact,
Isbel mildly suggested that possibility, whereupon Tom threw
himself in an attitude, exclaiming, "Most noble senora, has thy
slave offended in nearly wringing off that fair hand?"</p>

<p>Neither of the girls could help laughing, but Isbel said, "Tom,
behave yourself; you are a walking personification of
nonsense."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, coz," said Tom. "I hope such is not your opinion,
Miss de Caldara."</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly," replied Inez, smiling; "but why do you 'Miss,'
and 'Senora' me? It used to be Inez when we met four years ago, and
before that."</p>

<p>"Why, by Joye, I don't know," said Tom, pushing up his curly
hair as if taken aback, "except that you've sprung up so tall. I
can remember you as high as that," holding his hand about four feet
from the floor, "and in short skirts, and now, i'faith you top
Isbel and Marion by a good bit. Do you remember," he added, more
seriously, "what a favorite you were with poor Julian D'Arcy?"</p>

<p>The child turned suddenly away with a quivering lip; and deeply
pained at having so inadvertently wounded her, Tom Courtenay
glanced at Isbel in mute appeal. But Inez's emotion was only for a
second, her self-control had now grown too habitual, and her strong
will too all powerful, to enable anything to unnerve her for long,
and the next moment she turned her face, with its habitual quiet
expression, and said in a voice resolutely calm, "Do not let my
foolish weakness pain you. It is past now, but I loved Julian, and
his death&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Isbel, hastily; "I hear mamma coming, and she, too,
can hardly bear the mention of her son's name."</p>

<p>As the ladies came in, Tom muttered, "She's a most uncommon
step-mother," and then addressed them in his usual gay, rattling
manner, under which lay deeper feelings and a higher nature than
many gave him credit for.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the late to-morrow night, the family and
guests retired early, but Marion was still seated at her toilette
table, while Nelly brushed out her hair, when the door opened
almost noiselessly, and Inez stood by her side.</p>

<p>"Child, how you startled me!" exclaimed Marion, starting.</p>

<p>"Send your maid away," said the girl, in Italian.</p>

<p>"Nelly, you may go to bed," said her mistress, "I can easily
undress myself."</p>

<p>Nelly gladly retired, for travelling and bustling about had
tired her. Inez walked to the door, listened, bolted it, and
returned.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you alone," she said. "Angelo has so little
chance of doing so that he sent this to me in the packet Colonel
Louis brought me." She held out a letter.</p>

<p>Marion looked at her, and the name of "Julian!" burst from her
lips, as she grasped the letter. It was long, and once or twice she
passed her hand over her eyes. As she reached the end her breast
heaved, and suddenly clasping her hands on her brow, she cried with
a great and exceeding bitter cry, "Oh! Julian&mdash;oh, my son, my
son! are we never more to meet till we meet beyond the grave? Is
thy beautiful head to be for ever crushed beneath the frightful
doom of another's fell deed?"</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said the low thrilling voice of the Spanish girl;
and as if under a spell, Marion looked up. Inez stood before her
with such a light in her strange steadfast eyes as startled Marion.
"When you hear me," said the child steadily, "do not look on me as
a wild-brained visionist, or think I do not know what I say; but by
the love I bore the dead, by the love I bear the living; I will
find the man for whose dark deed Julian is an exile, and Julian
shall be restored to his name and rights. It is the one purpose of
my life, and I will do it!"</p>

<p>There was no haste or passion in her words or manner&mdash;no
quivering of the lip or wavering in the deep low
voice&mdash;nothing but a strong, deliberate purpose in treading
the path to that end. A determination to reach it, unalterable as
the laws of the Medes and Persians. Nothing could make her pause or
swerve in her purpose; and Marion gazed on her as if she looked on
one inspired, whispering low and almost fearfully, "Inez, Inez, how
you look! How is it possible for you to do this thing?"</p>

<p>A sudden light shone in the Spaniard's dark eyes, as if a ray
from heaven had fallen on her face, as she said, simply, and almost
in the words of Scripture, "Angelo loves Julian as he loves his own
soul, and I will do it."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant it," said Marion, bowing her head; "but I fear for
us all. What can you do, my little one? How can you do
anything?"</p>

<p>"Love conquers all," replied Inez, smiling gently. "The motto of
my forefathers is mine, and shall be proved at last."</p>

<p>When Marion looked up the child was gone, as silently as she had
entered, and Marion knelt and prayed earnestly that heaven would
indeed help the child. So that night passed away in the dim vista
of time, and the morning dawned, and with a strange and new-born
feeling of hope at her heart, Marion Rochester awoke from her
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>The first train brought down those guests who were to sleep that
night at the manor house; but we pass over the day to the ball in
the evening, to which young and old had been asked; and as Mr.
Melville and his wife were regular hospitable country people, and
young Melville a jovial, jolly sort of a follow, it promised to go
off well. From far and near the gentry of the surrounding country
came, and about 8 o'clock carriages began to set down the guests,
and as they came more punctually than people do in fashionable
London assemblies, by 9 o'clock almost every one had arrived, and
the rooms were well filled, and about 9, therefore, we will enter
the saloons.</p>

<p>The Reverend Cuthbert St. John entered about that time, looking
particularly grand and good, and entering just as the opening dance
had ended, one of the first people he saw was his brother with a
tall dark girl leaning on his arm. Beautiful indeed Inez de Caldara
looked in her floating white lace robe, unjewelled, save for the
rich bracelet&mdash;Angelo's present&mdash;which circled her arm,
and the slender chain of diamonds which confined her hair, and
gleamed amidst it like stars in a dark night.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cuthbert, you are late!" said Louis St. John.</p>

<p>"More serious duties detained me," said the Reverend Cuthbert
with a sweet smoothness that implied reproof; but at the same time
giving a glance at the Castilian, which plainly said, "Introduce
me." So Louis read it, but yet somehow or other it was with an
indefinable dislike he did so, and did it shortly&mdash;"My brother
Cuthbert&mdash;the Senora Inez de Caldara."</p>

<p>Inez bowed in the cold haughty manner long habitual to her with
strangers; Cuthbert, intending to be as haughty, only bowed
stiffly, and passed on, his admiration of the beautiful Spaniard
somewhat chilled.</p>

<p>"Look, Isbel!" whispered Tom Courtenay. "By Jove, there's Noah
himself risen from his grave."</p>

<p>"Take care!" said Isbel, smothering a laugh in her handkerchief.
"It is our incumbent, Colonel Louis's brother."</p>

<p>"Whew! sits the wind that way?" muttered Tom. "Well, I must have
some fun out of him. Isbel, you know him then?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," she replied; "that is, I've met him four or
five times at the house of his mother, Lady Alice, and seen him at
church."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll take the shine out of him," said Tom. "Come along, and
introduce me, and keep my arm, and we'll have a lark. If you won't
St. John will."</p>

<p>He drew her forwards to where the clergyman was standing; and
Isbel, who had a piece of Tom's mischief in her, said, "How do you
do, Mr. St. John? Allow me to introduce my cousin, Mr. Thomas
Courtenay."</p>

<p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. St. John," said Tom, his
black eyes dancing with mischief. "Having long known your warlike
brother, I was anxious to be introduced to you. Strange we should
never have met at my cousin Courtenay's house, eh! isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I presume, sir, you are not often there?" said the Reverend
Cuthbert, stiffly. "And I have been away from London."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! and while for three years I've been idling it away
abroad, you have been laboring to bring back these heathens to the
pale of the church. When I look back on the precious time I have
wasted, sir," said Tom, with a sanctimonious look, which nearly
unmanned (or unwomaned) his cousin's gravity, "and on the many idle
hours I have flung away, and reflect that time never returns, it
makes me sad; it does, indeed, now."</p>

<p>Cuthbert looked at him, at first a little uncertain whether he
was being laughed at or not, but Tom's gravity deceived him, and he
answered as became a clergyman, that "Time and tide wait for no
man; and hours misspent and past can never be recalled," which was
such a platitude that Tom's mouth gave way slightly at the corners,
but he said, "You are right. By-the-way, I hear that party spirit
runs high here between Low Church and Puseyite."</p>

<p>"Anglo-Catholic; I presume you mean, Mr. Courtenay," said the
Reverend Cuthbert, drawing himself up, deeply offended at being
called Puseyite.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," exclaimed Tom, intensely delighted at
having what he internally denominated 'riled the parson.' "I wasn't
aware your party had a new name. I have been abroad, you see, where
there are only Catholics and heretics; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whatever he was going to say to further 'rile the parson' was
fated never to be uttered, for young Melville came up, exclaiming,
"Tom Courtenay, you are usurping your cousin; Miss Rochester, do
graciously accord me the honor of your hand."</p>

<p>And the next moment Isbel whirled away in a rapid waltz, which
Tom hastened to join with Inez, whom he took from Colonel St. John
as unceremoniously as he had himself been robbed of Isbel.</p>

<p>We will not bore the reader with a description of the remainder
of that gay evening. Dancing was varied by admirably acted
characters, in which Inez took a prominent part, and by music at
intervals; and when at an early hour on the following morning the
party broke up, there were few of the younger guests who did not
feel that, late as it was, the hour of separation had come all too
soon, so bright and so keen had been their enjoyment of its
hours.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>Marion Courtenay, when very young, barely seventeen, had been
married by her father to a certain Colonel Cyril D'Arcy, a gallant
officer who had served with great distinction in India; and Marion,
young and inexperienced, mistook respect and admiration for love,
when, in fact, her affection for him was more that of a child to a
father. He was many years her senior, and at that time was a
widower with one son, Julian, a boy about eleven, who up till then
had been under the care of Sir Reginald Egerton. Marion's first
acquaintance with Angelo was on her wedding day. Only the day
before Mr. Courtenay was attacked with illness, but he would not
postpone the marriage.</p>

<p>Cyril D'Arcy and Reginald Egerton had been schoolboys together,
and when the latter died, Cyril had continued the friendship to his
old friend's son as closely as the quiet reserve of Angelo would
allow him, and now it was Angelo who was asked to give away Miss
Courtenay, which he did.</p>

<p>Marion D'Arcy was happy in her husband's affection, and in the
deep love she soon learned to bear her step-son. If the child had
been her own she could not have loved him with more entire
devotion, and he returned it fully. It has been said that the tie
between Marion and Angelo Egerton was no common one, nor was it,
for that tie was this very boy Julian; it had grown out of him, and
centered absorbedly in him through sad and strange circumstances to
be told hereafter.</p>

<p>What Inez had said was true&mdash;that "Angelo loved Julian as
his own soul."</p>

<p>As a little child, while his father was in India, Julian had
been left under the care of Sir Reginald and his wife Jesuita,
whose gentle heart warmed to the motherless child. But Angelo, like
most young men, and like himself in particular, had a dislike to
young children; they were for the women; he knew nothing about
them, and cared still less, and when at home he rarely if ever
noticed the child; but when he did, there was an irresistible
fascination in his voice and manner&mdash;a winning power of which
he was even himself scarcely conscious, but which won the child, as
by some invisible force, even while he half feared him.</p>

<p>But Egerton knew it not, and might perhaps never have known till
years after what a rich wealth of love and noble nature he was
throwing away, but for one of those fine threads on which a whole
lifetime often turns, and which the world calls 'chance,' but which
the thinking brain and heart with deep reverence ascribes to an
ever watchful Providence.</p>

<p>It was one hot autumn day at Falcontower Castle when Julian was
about eight years old and Angelo eighteen, that, the latter having
ridden hard that day, for he was a wild, reckless rider as far as
he himself was concerned, on his return, had thrown himself on the
grass, on the park-side of a stream which divided the flower
gardens from the park, and the long grass completely hid his
prostrate form until you came close. He had fallen into a deep
reverie&mdash;a dream of ambition and power, in which the face of
his idolised mother was strangely mingled, when his quick ear
caught the sound of little footsteps, and the pattering steps of a
dog crossing the footbridge near him; but he did not move,
recognising little Julian's steps.</p>

<p>He heard the child sit down by the stream, for a long time
silent and motionless; then the gentle, child-like voice murmured
some words to the dog, at first too low to be caught, till,
seemingly answering some caressing movement of his canine
companion, the boy said, sadly, "Ah, poor Tyrol, you are not afraid
of Angelo, for he speaks to you often, not seldom&mdash;oh so
seldom, as he does to me&mdash;and when he does, he makes me love
him. I am a child, and he doesn't like children; but oh, I wish he
would love me just a little bit, Tyrol," and the child drew a deep
heavy sigh.</p>

<p>Those simple words&mdash;that sigh&mdash;cut Angelo to the very
heart's core with a bitter, remorseful pang, whose sharp pain he
had never thought to feel; he saw in a moment how wrong, how cruel
he had been in suffering his dislike to very young children to
blind his usual acuteness, and overlook with careless, almost cold
indifference, the pure affection of a little child&mdash;that holy
thing which, alas! is too often cast aside with ruthless haste or
neglect, and which is surely one of the few gifts that remain of
paradise.</p>

<p>But Angelo's mistake had been that of youth more than character,
and the moment he saw how wrong he had been, that moment he
determined to repair the evil before it was too late.</p>

<p>He raised himself, and said quietly, "Julian, come here."</p>

<p>The child started violently, but came instantly, saying
hurriedly, "I didn't know you were here, Angelo. Did we wake
you?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't asleep," he replied, "sit down by me."</p>

<p>The child obeyed; but his look of timid wonder struck like cold
steel to Egerton's inmost soul, and even his iron will could not
make his voice quite so steady as usual, as he said, "Why are you
afraid of me, Julian?"</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, colored deeply, and his blue eyes
drooped.</p>

<p>"Nay, my boy, do not be afraid to answer me," said Angelo,
kindly.</p>

<p>"Because," half whispered the child, with quivering lips, "you
don't like children."</p>

<p>"And children don't like me," said Egerton; but his voice
trembled.</p>

<p>Julian looked up quickly; there were tears, bitter, remorseful
tears in Angelo's eyes; and the child, with a sudden impulse, hid
his face on Angelo's breast, saying passionately, "I love you! Oh!
Angelo, love me a little!"</p>

<p>Angelo clasped the child to him, murmuring low, as he bent over
him, "God forgive me; for I have been greviously wrong all these
years!"</p>

<p>From that day there sprang up between these two a love, that
grew every hour and day of the nineteen years that had passed since
that moment, which had been in their lives the turning point on
which so much had hung.</p>

<p>Then came Sir Reginald's death and Colonel D'Arcy's return, and
a year after that his marriage with Marion Courtenay; but in two
years he died, leaving his son and property, Friars Lea, to the
sole guardianship of Angelo Egerton. Marion was left even
wealthy.</p>

<p>And now Tom Courtenay's name first appears as a link in this
strange chain, for Tom and Julian were at Eton together, and became
great friends; later Tom had been not only rather, but very wild;
and Julian in attempting to rescue him from the dire consequences
of it, had entailed upon himself misery he little dreamed of, but
of which Tom was totally ignorant, supposing him, in common with
the rest of the world, to be dead.</p>

<p>But we must go back.</p>

<p>It is not here that we have space to tell how Marion D'Arcy met
Austin Rochester, suffice it that she did. She learned what it was
to love with all the faith and strength of her strong faithful
heart. She loved his motherless little child for his sake; she
believed she was loved, and they were married. A few short clouded
months, barely a year, and she was awake from her dream. One dark
day he left her and his child, and from that time she had never
seen him or heard of him. At the same time Marion married, Inez
arrived in England, and a year after that came Lady Egerton's
terrible death, and then vague news that young Julian D'Arcy (who
had left England very suddenly just then) had fallen over a
precipice in travelling to Switzerland and been killed. In reality
Julian, under the name of Rothesay, Angelo's second Christian name,
fled from England, accompanied by Egerton, who took him to
Florence, and placed him with an eminent artist. Only three people
in the world knew the whole from beginning to end&mdash;Egerton,
Marion, and the child, Inez.</p>

<p>When the report of Julian D'Arcy's death reached home, some
distant relations of course sprang up and claimed Friars Lea; but
Angelo refused to give it up, on the ground that Julian's death
could not be proved, and therefore he as trustee would hold it. The
distant relation applied to the Court of Chancery to have Julian
declared dead, but Angelo opposed this, and there being no proof
adduced, the application was refused.</p>

<p>Colonel St. John, as we have said, had been at Eton with Angelo,
and knew only what the world knew, and that was little enough, and
far enough from the real truth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p>Louis St. John had been induced by Cuthbert to remain with him
over the Sunday; but as on the Saturday afternoon Cuthbert would be
engaged, Louis said he should see if Mrs. Ashton would allow him to
take out Inez and Miss Rochester for a ride, and walked up to the
school to make the request.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton heard him, and then said with a half apologetic
smile, "Inez may go with you, Colonel St. John, but you will easily
understand that I cannot permit Miss Rochester to do the same. She
is no longer a child; and you will excuse me, I hope, sir. It would
never do to so infringe the rule, and have one of the pupils seen
riding out with a gentleman alone, and especially a military
officer."</p>

<p>"I quite understand that, Mrs. Ashton," said Louis; "but pardon
me, will not that apply to Inez?"</p>

<p>"Firstly, colonel, Inez is, after all, still a child; and then I
am peculiarly placed with regard to her. Her guardian placed her
here only on the agreement that she was to have great freedom, and
especially as much free air and exercise as she chose. If she were
precisely on the same footing here as the other girls, I should not
allow her to go; but as, personally, I see no harm in it, and as I
know Sir Angelo, if here, would wish it, you are welcome to take
her, only do not be late."</p>

<p>"And what time shall I order the horses, Mrs. Ashton?"</p>

<p>"At half past 2 punctually," she replied, "but I will ask her."
She left the room, but soon returned, saying, "At that hour she
will be ready, and she begged me to offer you the use of her
groom's horse. It is a noble animal, and far superior to any you
could hire here."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to her," said Louis; "and will be here at the
time. Where are the horses kept?"</p>

<p>"At the Manor Arms," said Mrs. Ashton, "just this side of the
village."</p>

<p>Louis thanked her and departed.</p>

<p>Precisely at half-past 2 he reached Ashton House; but old John
Wylde was already there with El Hasseneh and Greysteel, and Inez
was waiting on the steps, looking so beautiful in her riding habit
that St. John started. But he recovered himself, and as he lifted
her to her saddle, said gaily, "Senorita, to be before time is as
unpunctual as to be after it."</p>

<p>"A fault on the right side, though," she answered, as they
passed the lodge-gates, and struck in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful country, hilly and wooded, and though now it
was winter, and the ground hard and frozen, it was still beautiful
in its very bleak desolation. For some distance neither spoke, but
as they were walking their horses down the slope of a hill, Louis
said, "Have you seen that masterly painting of Horatius Cocles
defending the bridge? It is by a young artist who is rising to
fame. Julian Rothesay is his name."</p>

<p>"I have seen it, and it is certainly splendid," replied Inez.
"If one of the old masters had done it, the world would have gone
mad about it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid your sarcasm is true," said Louis; "but I fancied
that in the face of the brave Roman I could trace some resemblance
to Egerton."</p>

<p>"It is very likely," said Inez, quietly; "we knew the painter
when we were in Florence, and he took Angelo's portrait."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Louis; "I must see it. Is it a good
likeness?"</p>

<p>"To the life&mdash;masterly," she replied; "it hangs now in the
gallery at Falcontower, but it is so fine a one that when it came
over, Angelo, at the request of his friends, threw open his gallery
in town for three days."</p>

<p>She did not say that nothing would have made him allow his own
portrait to be shown save for his love for its painter, which made
him do anything to give him fame and renown.</p>

<p>"I must see it," said St. John; "but is this artist any relation
of Egerton's?"</p>

<p>She looked up in surprise, and replied, "No! what a strange
question! What made you think that?"</p>

<p>There was a restless anxiety in her eye as she spoke, and a
curious expression about the mouth, which would have told
Angelo&mdash;and Angelo only&mdash;that she was prepared to "lie
unmitigatedly to preserve the secret entrusted to her care."</p>

<p>Louis saw neither, but replied, "Your guardian's name is Angelo
Rothesay Egerton, and this painter's is Rothesay."</p>

<p>"Angelo was so christened after his father's mother," said Inez.
"It was her surname."</p>

<p>"Well, and perhaps this Signor Giulio is of the same family,"
said Louis.</p>

<p>"No, he is no relation at all," said Inez. "But look, Colonel
Louis, do you see that deep ravine in the vale below?"</p>

<p>In the vale, between two lines of hills, was a gorge about
twelve feet across, by ten deep, but with sloping sides, so that a
horse with a careful rider could cross it easily.</p>

<p>"It looks," said St. John, "as if it had once been the bed of a
river."</p>

<p>"So it has," said Inez; "it runs for miles like that, and in
heavy rains is often full, and a heavy fall of snow with wind makes
it a snowdrift&mdash;a dangerous one, too."</p>

<p>"Is it passable now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Wylde and I have crossed it often," replied Inez.
"Greysteel and El Hasseneh know exactly how to step down."</p>

<p>As they reached the ravine, Colonel St. John glanced upward, and
said, "I hope, then, no rain or snow will fall, for there are some
'ugly' gray clouds hanging over us."</p>

<p>"Never mind them," said Inez. "Now," said she, as they reached
the other side, "let's race to the top of this hill as the crow
flies&mdash;the road winds."</p>

<p>"Inez, stop!" he exclaimed. "There are hedges in the
way&mdash;you will be thrown."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Angelo taught me riding," she returned. "I shall get
there first, for El Hasseneh goes like the wind."</p>

<p>"A wilfu' woman maun hae her wa'," said the colonel, resignedly.
"Now, one, two, three&mdash;away!"</p>

<p>Both started; Inez saying quickly, "Don't fear for me at
leaping, but mind Greysteel."</p>

<p>Up to and over the first hedge the gallant gray kept neck and
neck with the black descendant of the prophet's steed, but soon the
extreme fleetness of the Arabian, and the feather-weight she bore,
begun to tell, and she shot ahead of her rival, took the next hedge
with graceful and ladylike ease, and kept steadily on, reaching the
brow of the hill several lengths before Greysteel; and suddenly, as
Inez pulled her up, the well trained animal stopped immediately as
motionless as a statue, and her silky coat hardly even stirred by
her run.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were such a rider," exclaimed the colonel,
laughingly; "but you had me at a disadvantage."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," said Inez; "I only wanted a good gallop. I'll
be good now."</p>

<p>St. John looked at her, and muttered inwardly, "Anything to make
that dear face look less grave, and more like a child's. Deuce take
it!" he exclaimed, suddenly. "Greysteel has cast a shoe. I hope
there is a farrier over there."</p>

<p>Dismounting, he led the horse, and walked; but in this way it
took a quarter of an hour to reach the hamlet, and by this time it
was really getting dark, and the snow was falling faster every
minute, sweeping before the wind in what promised to be a heavy
drift.</p>

<p>St. John went straight to the village inn, and asked if there
was a farrier, but the host said no; he did jobs of that sort.
There was nothing to do but to have the horse shoed and both horses
fed, and then Louis asked how far they were from Yellowfield, and
what time it was.</p>

<p>"Nigh on 5, sir," was the reply; "and even across country and
through the ravine, it's seventeen mile."</p>

<p>"That is the way we came and must return," said St. John.</p>

<p>"Lor, sir, it will be dark before you can reach the ravine,"
said the landlord, "and by that time it will be a snow drift. See
how heavy it falls, and how the wind drives it before it."</p>

<p>"We must reach it and cross it," said Inez, looking at St.
John.</p>

<p>"Why, miss, the hardest riding would hardly reach it in time,"
said the landlord. "It will be dark in half an hour, sir."</p>

<p>"Do not mind what he says. We lose time," said the Spaniard,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"My friend, we must go," said the colonel, decidedly; "so good
evening."</p>

<p>They turned their horses' heads, and at a hand-gallop rode away,
Inez's dark eyes sparkling with delight at the adventure, Louis'
full of anxiety for his precious charge.</p>

<p>The air was perfectly white with snow, which the now wild blast
swept right in their faces. Presently St. John said, "Are these
horses good for a long, mad race?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are thorough-bred, and used to mad riding," replied
Inez.</p>

<p>"How bleak and desolate the hills look!" said Louis. "And how
dark it is growing! Inez, can you really keep your seat when
Hasseneh is at her full speed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then, my dear child, there is nothing for it but that," said
Louis. "Now start."</p>

<p>The next moment they were off&mdash;at first with some
moderation, but as the high-mettled animals warmed to their work
they broke into a mad gallop, that made them seem literally to fly
through the air like the wild steeds and wilder riders of German
legends. The miles flew by them like phantoms, and though the
driving snow and howling blast swept wildly past them, neither
steeds nor riders heeded it, but bending almost to their
saddle-bows, they kept on as if the race were one for life and
death, the foam flying from the horses' mouths as they dashed on
through the fast deepening snow. And so they approached the dreaded
ravine. But the little hand that grasped Hasseneh's rein was
growing nerveless, every fibre in the child's slight frame was
quivering. She drew her breath in quick, labored gasps; and as the
brave horses slackened, partly to descend the last slope, partly
impeded by the snow, she drooped forward in her saddle till her
black hair mingled with the flowing mane of the Arabian.</p>

<p>"Inez! Great heaven! she is fainting!" exclaimed St. John.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the child, raising herself with a strong effort
of her strong will, "it is only the wind takes my breath away."</p>

<p>"My darling child, I have ridden you too hard," said St.
John.</p>

<p>"No," said Inez, recovering herself with the minute's pause, and
firmly grasping the reins. "I am all right again. Dear Louis,
indeed I am."</p>

<p>"It is so dark I cannot see your face very clearly," said Louis.
"Are you really all right again?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes," she replied. "Ride on, ride on, or we shall be too
late."</p>

<p>A few moments more brought them to where the ravine had been. It
was one sheet of white snow from one side of the valley to the
other, and the ravine between was filled and hidden by the snow
stretching away on all sides. It was one vast drift&mdash;to
attempt to cross which would be certain death.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens&mdash;we are too late!" said Colonel St. John.</p>

<p>There was a moment's dead silence; then Inez said, "What is
there to fear if we don't cross it? I know you are only fearing the
night and the snow-storm for me; but I don't fear either with
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your affectionate trust, dear Inez," he returned;
"but listen. Every moment the snow is deepening, and before long
will be up to our saddle girths, and it may continue all night.
These roads here between hedge rows will soon be snow drifts, and
then heaven help us, for man could not. Do you know of any road
skirting the ravine?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;none," she replied. "But look, look!&mdash;there is a
light gleaming in the darkness."</p>

<p>Louis' eye followed her hand. On the top of what must have been
a hill, about half a mile or so off, a light faintly gleamed.</p>

<p>"What can it be, Inez?" he asked; "we passed no house or
building in sight when we crossed the ravine."</p>

<p>"No, but it certainly comes from one," she replied. "Colonel
Louis, so far from being afraid, I feel intense enjoyment of such
an adventure and real peril in these prosaic days."</p>

<p>"Brave girl! it is no joke though," answered St. John, gravely,
though greatly relieved to find he had so fearless a companion. "We
must try and reach this building and get shelter for to-night. One
thing is certain: in the darkness we have lost our way entirely,
and struck the ravine many a long mile from where we crossed
it."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Ashton?" said Inez; "she will be so frightened."</p>

<p>"She will probably guess that we have taken shelter, and if not,
she must be frightened," returned Louis, coolly. "Come, there is no
time to be lost."</p>

<p>Keeping the light in view, they turned back, and once more set
off at a quick walk. The light drew nearer and nearer, but the snow
had deepened dangerously before a dark mass of building rose ahead,
and they reached some gates with a lodge. To St. John's cool
enquiry of the woman who came out, whether her master or mistress
were at home, she answered yes, and let them in.</p>

<p>Another minute brought them to the house, whose size outside it
was too dark to see, but it was the hall lamp that had guided them.
Louis dismounted, gave his reins to Inez, and rang the bell. The
door was opened by a respectable man servant, who stared rather
hard at the strangers.</p>

<p>"Is your master at home?" asked St. John.</p>

<p>"Mr. Aubrey is, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Tell him a gentleman wishes to see him," said St. John.</p>

<p>Without actually leaving the hall, the servant opened a door
near, and said something, and the next moment a gentleman&mdash;a
young man&mdash;came quickly out. Addressing him at once, Colonel
St. John explained exactly what had happened, and with many
apologies for the liberty he was taking, asked shelter for the
young lady and himself, as to go on was only courting death.</p>

<p>"The young lady and yourself are warmly welcome," said the young
man, cordially; "I am only thankful you found your way out of such
peril. James, take these two horses to the stables, and see that
every care is taken of them. Pray bring the lady in, sir."</p>

<p>Colonel St. John lifted Inez in his arms and fairly carried her
into the hall, and for a moment she clung to his arm, giddy from
the sudden transition from darkness to light, but in a minute she
recovered, and shook the snow from her dress, hair, and hat.</p>

<p>"Now come in here," said the stranger, opening the door of a
comfortable sitting room with a huge fire; "you are both cold and
wet, and probably hungry too."</p>

<p>He rang the bell, which was answered by a respectable looking
old matron of sixty or so.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Martinger," said he, "this lady and gentleman have been
overtaken and nearly lost in the snow, and will do us the pleasure
of remaining the night, so now take the young lady up stairs and
attend to her, and get a couple of rooms ready."</p>

<p>"Lawks ha' mercy!" cried the old lady, "the puir dear's quite
wet. Come along, ye pretty bird."</p>

<p>While the old lady bore off Inez, their host took St. John
upstairs, but as he had a great coat on, he had only to take that
off; and fortunately Inez always wore a thin black silk dress under
her habit, so that she had only to take off her wet habit, and she
came out like a silkworm from its chrysalis.</p>

<p>In the meantime an ample repast had been prepared, and
unromantic as it may appear, both our travellers did it full
justice. As they sat by the cheerful blaze after its removal, the
two gentlemen enjoying their cigars, while Inez sat very quiet on a
low stool at Louis' feet, she had time to scan their host. He was a
young man&mdash;that is, about five or six and twenty&mdash;not
above the middle height, but well formed, and with a handsome,
frank, pleasant face; but now and then there was a curious flicker
in the bright brown eyes, which perhaps only so close and watchful
an observer as Inez de Caldara would have noticed, and it made her
a little undecided whether to like him decidedly, or give him a
qualified favor.</p>

<p>But for a long time she had sat looking into the fire, not
seeing that the keen brown eyes were gazing on her very
fixedly.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me for asking, colonel," said their host,
suddenly, "but this young lady is scarcely your daughter or sister?
Or your wife?" he added, doubtingly.</p>

<p>For half a second Louis St. John paused, then he replied,
smiling, "Oh, no, none of the three; only the ward of an old
friend, and I have known her from childhood."</p>

<p>Inez looked up with a smile, saying, "I'm not enough like him,
sir, for a daughter or sister."</p>

<p>"No," said the young man; "and pardon me again, are you
English?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," she replied. "I am Spanish&mdash;a
Castilian."</p>

<p>"I thought you looked foreign," said he.</p>

<p>"But you speak English quite purely."</p>

<p>"I have been brought up in England since I was five years old,"
replied Inez.</p>

<p>"Do you know any Spanish songs?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, many," she replied.</p>

<p>"Would it be too much to ask you to sing one or two?" he
enquired; "my own mother was for many years in Spain, and used to
sing their songs."</p>

<p>"I am glad I can oblige you, sir," said Inez, who had not the
smallest bit of affectation about her, and rising at once she
opened the piano, struck a few chords, and sang one or two
plaintive airs in a rich, mellow voice, which, already exquisitely
beautiful, gave promise of rare perfection.</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly, and in the morning, when they
both took leave, Louis told Roland Aubrey that when he came to
London, he should hope to see him and return his hospitality.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Inez de Caldara first met Roland Aubrey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton had, as Louis said, guessed that they had taken
shelter, and had not therefore been very anxious.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p>In an elegantly-furnished drawing room in Seymour-street, sit
two ladies. One was a gentle looking lady of middle age; the other
a young and pretty woman of twenty-three, but with more imagination
than intellect in her face. The elder was Lady Alice St. John, the
mother of Louis and Cuthbert; the younger, her husband's niece,
Arabella St. John, whom, early left an orphan, the gentle mother of
Louis had completely brought up as her own daughter.</p>

<p>Lady Alice is like Louis, or rather he is like her, though her
face is softened into an eminently womanly one. She had the same
golden hair, the same somewhat Grecian nose, and clear, trustful
eyes, and the same expression of face, and in youth she had been
pre-eminently beautiful, even now she was undeniably still a lovely
woman, and at fifty-three looked barely forty-five.</p>

<p>Both ladies were evidently waiting for some arrival; for
Arabella kept going to the window, and even Lady Alice did not read
very steadily.</p>

<p>It was shortly after Easter, and the truth was they were
expecting a young lady whom Lady Alice had engaged as a companion
to her niece, and that young lady was Theresa Stanfeld, who had
left school at Easter, and immediately put in force the intention
Margaret had mentioned, of separating herself from her father, and
a home that was a wretched one.</p>

<p>She had heard of Lady Alice's wanting a companion for her niece
simply enough; for the lady had mentioned it to Marion Rochester,
and she in one of her letters to Inez passingly repeated it, and
Inez immediately thought of Theresa.</p>

<p>That was the way it had come about; and now they were hourly
expecting her arrival; Arabella with the greatest curiosity, for
she had been absent when her aunt saw and engaged Theresa.</p>

<p>"What is she like?" she asked for the dozenth time, and still
Alice St. John answered, "Wait and see."</p>

<p>At length wheels stopped, and presently Miss Stanfeld was
announced, and Miss Stanfeld appeared&mdash;no school-girl
awkwardness about her; easy self-possession characterised her now,
a perfect lady. Arabella was decidedly satisfied with the result of
her survey. Theresa was decidedly lovely, though: 'Not like a nymph
or goddess of old.'</p>

<p>You could not have chiselled a statue from her, as you could
from Inez's classic face and head, but you could have made a
glowing painting of her. She had a broad, observant-looking
forehead and an arch mouth, though the restlessness of the clear,
full hazel eye, and quick quiver of the red lips betrayed the hasty
impetuosity of temper which Inez had spoken of. Her figure was
pretty and elegant, so that, looking at her, with her brilliantly
fair skin and sunny brown hair, you only thought how very lovely
she was, and forgot that her beauties were not statue-like.</p>

<p>Yes, Arabella was decidedly pleased. She liked pretty people,
and, with all her faults&mdash;and they were many&mdash;she had no
petty jealousy of a prettier face than her own. She received her
new friend warmly, as a friend, with almost childlike cordiality;
for in all but actual numerical years she was seventeen, and Lady
Alice was pleased.</p>

<p>Arabella herself conducted Theresa to her room, and assisted her
to remove her walking dress.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall like you," she said, with a frank, girlish
laugh. "I always like or dislike a face at first sight."</p>

<p>"Then I hope, Miss St. John, that you like mine at first sight,"
said Theresa.</p>

<p>"I assure you I do," replied Arabella. "Oh, dear," she added,
"there's the dressing bell for dinner. I must run and dress, but
I'll send my maid to you."</p>

<p>"No, pray do not," said Theresa. "I am accustomed to do
everything for myself."</p>

<p>It was not till after dinner, and they were seated round the
drawing-room fire, that Lady Alice would permit any questions to be
addressed to Theresa, and then she herself said, "Did you come up
from Forest Moor all alone, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No, Lady Alice," she replied; "my father's groom, who has been
some years with us, came with me to your door."</p>

<p>"That was well," said Lady Alice. "You are very recently from
school, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," was the reply; "and both Miss Rochester and Inez
de Caldara send you their love."</p>

<p>"Ah, they are old friends of mine," said Lady Alice, "My son
Louis was at Eton with Inez's guardian."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hate school?" said Arabella. "I used to do so."</p>

<p>"No, I was very happy at Mrs. Ashton's," replied Theresa. "It is
a school, I think, that is one in a thousand."</p>

<p>"So Mrs. Rochester told me," said Lady Alice. "I wish I had
known of it in Arabella's school-days."</p>

<p>"I wish you had, aunt," said Arabella. "I should have escaped
many a task and ache of mind and body. Is Yellowfield pretty? Does
my cousin like it?" she added, to Theresa.</p>

<p>"My son," explained Lady Alice, "how does he like his
incumbency?"</p>

<p>"I really cannot say, Lady Alice, for we principally attended
the vicar's church," she replied, "but, frankly, Lady Alice, the
village is in two parties&mdash;the Puseyites and Low Church. The
first party like your son; the second like the vicar; I didn't; and
Inez, Isbel, and some others used to go to St. Mary Grace, for
there they had good singing at least, and better sermons than the
vicar gave. He was a Pharisee."</p>

<p>"You are fond of music, then?" said Alice St John.</p>

<p>"Very," was the reply. "I wish I was such a musician as some I
know."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard Castelnau, the French singer?" asked Lady
Alice.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," replied Theresa; "I have never been in London till
now."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Lady Alice; "you have much, indeed, to see. We
must take you sightseeing, and Castelnau, you must hear him; he
sings the day after to-morrow, the first opera night, and brings
out his daughter for the first time in England, in 'Les Huguenots.'
I will write this minute, and ask Sir Angelo Egerton for the loan
of his box. Arabella, give me my desk."</p>

<p>The note was written and despatched by a servant to St. James'
Square. In an hour the messenger brought back a note, which Lady
Alice glanced through and read aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Alice,&mdash;I am going to-morrow to fetch Inez for a
couple of days, in order to take her to witness the debut of
Castelnau's daughter; and I shall be most happy if you will join
us. We will call for you and your young friends at 1 o'clock on
Thursday&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p>"ANGELO R. EGERTON."</p>

<p>"There," said the lady, with a smile, "that's gentlemanly, to
escort us as well. He knows Castelnau, too; we may get introduced
to him."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>"Art is long, and time is fleeting," and the days and months
flew by swiftly. And the statesman sat in his cabinet, and schemed,
and planned, and dreamed in his aspiring soul of ambition and power
yet to be grasped. And the exile artist, in the fair and far off
land of his exile, saw in the vision of his mind his distinct
native hills, and dreamed of fame and his noble art&mdash;</p>

<p>'But alas! his fair ideal</p>

<p>Vanish'd, and escaped him still.'</p>

<p>And the child, who had never been a child, sat wakeful and
watchful in the still midnight, and dreamed of the man whom,
unconsciously to her own heart, she so deeply loved, and of the end
to which she was so steadfastly treading for his sake.</p>

<p>Thus winter had given place to spring, and spring had vanished
into summer, and the hot June sun streamed into the schoolroom
windows of Ashton House; but it was a Wednesday afternoon, and the
rooms were deserted, save for one solitary form bending over one of
the tables.</p>

<p>It was Inez de Caldara, a sheet of drawing-paper before her, a
pencil in her slender fingers, a box of crayons near her, and there
was a curious expression about her face as the work grew rapidly
beneath her skilled hand, which told that it was one that had
interested something deeper than her artist's eye&mdash;something
on her brow of haughty triumph&mdash;something of almost dark joy
in the black eyes and compressed lips, that was not wont to be
there.</p>

<p>The pencil sketch is done, she takes up a crayon, and still
works on, as if life and death hung on its execution. Hours passed;
the shadows grew longer and longer; her hand grew wearied, and her
chest ached from stooping so long; but she heeded nothing, felt
nothing, till the last touch was put, and then she held it off to
look at it. A man's head and figure to the shoulders. A dark, evil
face, that might have been a fiend's, for any redeeming point it
might have had in it; and the youthful artist laid it down with a
heavily-drawn sigh, such as one heaves when some intolerable weight
is removed.</p>

<p>But at that moment a light form sprang in through the French
window, and ere even Inez's quickness could cover the crayon,
Margaret Arundel was there, her hand on the paper, her gaze on the
picture.</p>

<p>"Merciful heaven!" she exclaimed, recoiling suddenly; "where did
you see him?"</p>

<p>For a moment there was an almost wild light in the Spaniard's
black eyes, but her habitual self-control did not fail her, and she
said quietly, "I don't know why you are so startled. I saw a face
like that years, long years ago, and now I draw it. Is that
strange?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Margaret, "but where did you know him? Do you
know who it is?"</p>

<p>"I would give the best years of my life to know," replied Inez,
with a passionate energy that was startling to see in one Margaret
had only seen till now calm, cold, and passionless.</p>

<p>"Dear Inez, don't look like that," said Margaret, almost
tearfully. "It is only so like&mdash;so exactly like my uncle's
nephew, Arthur Vivian."</p>

<p>Inez moved her hand slowly, and pressed it tightly to her heart,
and a dark smile crossed her lips and gleamed in her eyes as she
murmured, in her own language, "Found at last&mdash;found at
last!"</p>

<p>"Margaret," she said, abruptly, "do you like this cousin?"</p>

<p>"He is no cousin of mine," said Margaret, shuddering, "nor his
uncle either. I hate and fear both him and old Stephen
Stanfeld."</p>

<p>"Is that your uncle's name?" asked the Castilian, laying her
hand on Margaret's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's his name," she replied; "but he's not my uncle, and any
girl but you would have known exactly who I was by this time."</p>

<p>"I don't care to enquire into other people's affairs unless I
find they have something to do with me," said Inez; "now I find
that your affairs have much to do with me. I could tell you more
about Stanfeld and Vivian than you dream of. Margaret, can you keep
a quiet tongue?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Inez, if you wish it," she replied.</p>

<p>"I do wish it," said Inez. "Say nothing of this drawing or of
what we have said, but get up at 5 to-morrow and come with me in
the grounds; or, stay, you sleep alone in that little room at the
end of the passage, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"Keep awake, and I will come to you when they are all in bed,"
said Inez.</p>

<p>She turned away, looked the crayon in her desk, and glided from
the room.</p>

<p>It may well be conceived with what feelings Margaret retired to
her solitary chamber. The bright full moonlight streamed broadly
in, and she lay awake counting the minutes, each of which seemed an
hour; she heard half-past 10 strike, then 11, then half-past
11&mdash;all was silent, so still that the silence grew so intense
that it hummed in her ears&mdash;'Like the humming of many bees;'
and then 12 began striking. Would it never have done? The strokes
died away in the intensity of the silence, and then broke forth
again with a loud startling sound.</p>

<p>As the last stroke died away the door softly opened, and Inez
glided silently in, her feet bare, and a white Cashmere morning
robe over her night dress. She bolted the door, and then sat down
upon the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said she, "and speak very low."</p>

<p>"Inez," said Margaret, "how very white you are; you look
ghastly, or is it only the cold moonlight?"</p>

<p>"Never mind what it is," she replied. "You wondered to-day that
I had never asked anything about you or your antecedents; but now
you will do me a favor by telling everything about yourself and
those people."</p>

<p>"Strange and incomprehensible being?" said Margaret. "Are you in
earnest?"</p>

<p>"Look at me and see," said Inez, sternly. "I do not come here at
this hour for a jest."</p>

<p>"It is a long story," said Margaret. "Shall we have time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "Tell it shortly; don't mind being
abrupt."</p>

<p>Margaret settled herself back and began, "My mother died in
giving me birth. I had a sister, four years older than me; and my
father, shortly after my mother's death, became acquainted (how I
don't know) with a gentleman named Stephen Stanfeld, who owned a
great property called Forest Moor. From that evil day my father
went wrong; he had never been very strong in character, and fell
easily under this man's sway. My grandfather had been a merchant in
South America, and had died intestate, leaving my father absolute
possessor of fifty thousand pounds, which my father had vested in
houses. Well, this Stanfeld got my father into racing habits, and
got him to play. Inez, spare me details&mdash;the old sad story
followed. My father kept a racing stud, became a confirmed gambler,
betted high&mdash;lost. Stanfeld lent him money on the houses; so
it went on till the awful night my father staked everything in a
gambling house&mdash;and lost. He appealed once more to Stanfeld,
but he tauntingly told my father he hadn't a penny or a house to
mortgage. My father rushed from the gambling house, and flung
himself into the river. Oh! Inez, surely his death lies at
Stanfeld's door."</p>

<p>Inez bent down and kissed her forehead, but spoke no word; and
Margaret went on to tell how she had lost her sister&mdash;how she
must have perished, for Stanfeld would do nothing to find her; and
Margaret wept awhile. Then she continued: "I was then but eight
years old, friendless and penniless. Stanfeld had some feeling
left, or rather I believe his wife persuaded him, and he brought me
up and sent me to school. Personally, he is harsh to me, as to all
else. Have I not some right to hate the man who drove my father to
wrong and suicide, and who has robbed me and mine of everything? It
is but a poor recompense to educate me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Spaniard raised her hand warningly, and Margaret continued:
"You wish to know more of Stanfeld. How he became possessed of
Forest Moor I don't know, but probably by some roguery; for it had,
I believe, belonged to a family named Surrey."</p>

<p>"You spoke of his wife?" said Inez.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!&mdash;she paid dearly for her wrongdoing," answered
Margaret. "She was the daughter, the only child of Everard, of
Bond-street. But Stanfeld crossed her path&mdash;his handsome face
took her fancy, and her gold took his; but old Everard wouldn't
hear of it, so she fled, and married Stanfeld; for he made sure the
old man would then forgive his daughter, and give her a dower; and
so he did, but so tied up that Stanfeld couldn't touch a penny in
any way. And then he treated his wife cruelly. She had only two
children, Eveline, and Theresa, but they were still children when
their mother died broken hearted. We were kept like recluses at
Forest Moor till six years ago, when Theresa and I were sent to
school, and Eveline married."</p>

<p>"But Vivian," said Inez; "what of him?"</p>

<p>Margaret shuddered, as she answered; "I never saw him till about
six years ago, when Stanfeld brought him down to Forest Moor, and
introduced him as his nephew. Somehow or other, he fascinated and
infatuated Eveline, and shortly after I came here they married her
to him."</p>

<p>"Father of Mercy!" said the Spaniard, in an accent of such
horror that Margaret said, in alarm, "What is the matter? Oh, Inez,
tell me!"</p>

<p>"Is he living at the Moor, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Eveline is always there, but Arthur is only there on and
off."</p>

<p>"Will he be there during the holidays&mdash;after we leave
school, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I wish to heaven he wasn't!"</p>

<p>"I thank a just God that he is!" said Inez, almost solemnly.</p>

<p>Deeply awed, Margaret gazed on her, and then said, fearfully,
"Inez, in pity tell me what you know of this man&mdash;what awful
crime is on his head?"</p>

<p>Inez de Caldara bent forward, and the one word she uttered
sounded awful in the ghastly stillness of that lonely midnight
hour&mdash;"MURDER!"</p>

<p>"Inez, oh, Inez!" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Inez. "I can tell you no more now; and by all you
hold sacred, you must be as secret and silent as the grave. Promise
me that."</p>

<p>"I solemnly promise it," said Margaret.</p>

<p>"And now listen to me," said Inez. She bent down and whispered
long and earnestly, and then said aloud, "Will you do this,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"I will! Heart and soul, I will!" said Margaret Arundel, firmly.
"God help you, Inez, in your purpose."</p>

<p>Inez, who had moved to the door, turned her weird-like face on
her, and raised her white hand upward. The next moment she was
gone, like some phantom of the night. And the mournful night winds
wailed their ceaseless "Never more&mdash;never more!" and another
night sank and dwindled into the irrevocable past.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>"Walter, my boy, come down and hear this!" called the rich voice
of Julian Rothesay from the hall, intending to summon his pupil
from the painting-room upstairs, and in a minute a handsome, manly
youth of nineteen or twenty appeared, in whom, though much changed,
we may recognise the same boy who, four years and a half before,
had gazed with such wondering admiration on the masterpieces of Art
in the library of the high-born Egerton.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, following Julian into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"A letter from Angelo Egerton," was the reply. "Listen."</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Julian,&mdash;Expect me in about a
fortnight, for Parliament rises in ten days or so, and I can
contrive a flying visit then&mdash;for I must see you. How does
your pupil Walter get on? Remember me to him, and tell him that I
think he will be wanted after Christmas.&mdash;Yours
faithfully,<br>
<br>
A. R. EGERTON."</p>

<p>"I am very glad he is coming," said Walter; "we have not seen
him for so long&mdash;more than a year."</p>

<p>"Not since his party came into office," replied Julian. "I
called you because I thought you would like to know."</p>

<p>"I hope he will bring the Senorita Inez," said Walter.</p>

<p>"He says nothing of it," replied Julian; "but now I must see
that my studio is in order; for I think it is to-day that the
Sonora Genevra della Scala is to come for her first sitting." And
the artist left the room.</p>

<p>The fortnight passed slowly, but returning one morning from a
walk with young Surrey, Julian was met in the entrance hall by
Leon, the Spanish hound, and exclaiming, "By Jove! they are here,"
he flung wide the half open door, to see Egerton leaning against
the bookcase, and Inez leisurely reclining amongst the cushions of
a fauteuil.</p>

<p>"Angelo, old boy, a thousand welcomes!" exclaimed Julian, as he
grasped the hand of his old friend.</p>

<p>In silence Angelo closed his strong right hand on Julian's, and
then the latter turned towards Inez, who had risen. He took both
her little hands in his, and said, smiling&mdash;his beautiful
winning smile&mdash;"I suppose I musn't kiss you now!"</p>

<p>"Not unless you like, Julian," said Inez, with an answering
smile.</p>

<p>"I do like it. Ah, light of mine eyes!" And bending down he
kissed her brow and lips, for he had known her from childhood and
loved her only next to Egerton, and the same ties that bound him to
Angelo bound him to her.</p>

<p>Surrey had remained in the hall, but now he entered, and met
Egerton and Inez with the warmth and pleasure he felt, and could
not if he would conceal it.</p>

<p>"And now how long can you give us, Angelo?" asked the
artist.</p>

<p>"Not four-and-twenty hours," was the reply. "I was able to
obtain leave for a few days, as my business was important; but you
are aware that it is&mdash;and rightly&mdash;against all custom for
any of the ministry to cross seas, and leave is only given in an
urgent case. So we are off again by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"How tiresome!" said Julian. "Well, we must make the most of
you. You don't go to the hotel this time, I promise you."</p>

<p>Egerton smiled, and turning to Surrey, said, "My dear Walter,
are you still of the same mind as to the painting?"</p>

<p>"I am as fond of it as ever," said the young man, raising his
bright hazel eyes to Egerton's; "but I will do exactly as you wish
about it."</p>

<p>"Then you will continue it, even when you are of age and in
possession of your property," said Egerton. "Idleness is the worst
possible school for a young man, especially a young man of property
and position. If you do not think you shall like painting as an
occupation, you can go to the bar; I could push you there; only I
tell you frankly, I don't think your talent lies either in that way
or in politics."</p>

<p>"Oh, I love my beautiful art as much, Sir Angelo, as you love
your ambition and power," said Surrey, with all his bright young
enthusiasm sparkling in his eyes and face. "I almost wish I was
still poor and friendless, that I might make my own name as Julian
is doing. I could&mdash;I would do it."</p>

<p>The man of the world looked at the youth, and said with his
grave half-sad smile, "My dear Walter, never imagine that wealth
and position are to be laughed at, or despised&mdash;neither things
to be prized too much. They are God's gifts; and, with reverence to
Him, a strict account must be rendered. The powerful have a heavy
responsibility."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Julian said, "How does his
lawsuit get on?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Egerton, "it will come on after the vacation, I
think; and then Walter must come over, for we mean to have parol
evidence. Stanfeld actually put in an answer, denying that the
young man I brought forward was the son of Colonel Surrey, old
Herbert Surrey's son, who he declares died in India shortly after
his arrival; but his game is evidently to make every delay, and
gain as much time as possible."</p>

<p>So they passed the time till dinner, and after dinner Walter
left them, saying that he had a picture he must finish; and the
three, whom circumstances had so strangely bound together, were
alone.</p>

<p>Inez, knowing what Angelo had to tell, rose to go away; but
Julian said, "Do not go on my account, Inez," and she remained.</p>

<p>"Julian," said Egerton, bending forward, "the day we have
watched and waited for till heart and brain grew sick, has come at
last. At last that black villain, for whose crime you have suffered
so many weary years, is found."</p>

<p>Julian started&mdash;his lip quivered&mdash;and turning abruptly
aside, he covered his face with his hands, totally unable to master
his emotion completely, though self-control had been taught him in
the bitter, harsh school of adversity. But there are moments when
the most iron self-command and pride must give way. It was only for
a minute or two, and then he raised his face, and said in a low,
unsteady voice, "Thank heaven for its great mercy! Tell me all,
Angelo."</p>

<p>"Inez shall speak, for she found him," he replied. "It is she
who will be the sole means of bringing it home to him."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Inez!" said Julian, clasping her hand, "for your
dear face has been a constant blessing since the hour you came
among us."</p>

<p>Then she told him all the reader knows of the sketch&mdash;of
Margaret's recognition, and her own sad story; and then she told
him her whole plan for completely convicting Arthur Vivian&mdash;a
plan so daring, and so fraught with danger, that Julian exclaimed,
"Angelo, this must not be&mdash;not for me. Evil will come to her.
You must not allow it."</p>

<p>"It is too late," said Egerton; "I have passed her my sacred
word to let her have her way."</p>

<p>Inez glanced at him, and a look of pain crossed her face, as she
said, earnestly, "Indeed, indeed there is no danger to me. I am a
match for him, and Heaven will help me," and she bent her head
reverently. "Do you think I have watched so long for this hour to
fling all away when the weapon is in my hands! No, I have too much
of Egerton's nature in me for that. Was that man's face so buried
into my memory for nothing? Hard, indeed, was it to make Angelo
yield, but he did at last, and he cannot retract."</p>

<p>"Angelo, look at this girl!" said Julian. "She is your breathing
likeness now, more than ever I saw her before. I oppose you no
more, my guardian angel; the result is in higher hands than
ours."</p>

<p>"Look at the sketch," said Egerton, laying the crayon on the
table; but now underneath it was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was drawn by me on the 27th June, 18&mdash;, from memory,
never having seen the original for eight years and a half.</p>

<p>"INEZ JESUITA MARIA DE CALDARA."</p>

<p>"I saw this sketch drawn, June 27th, 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>"MARGARET ARUNDEL."</p>

<p>Julian Rothesay gazed long on the drawing, and shuddered as he
laid it down, saying, "It is a face more evil than I could have
believed existed."</p>

<p>"It is," said Egerton. "And I want you, Julian, to paint it
life-size, in oils; introduce it in any manner you like. Such a
portrait as shall make your name famous."</p>

<p>"But, Angelo, what a strange idea!" said Julian; "a portrait
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Egerton, "if I tell you, do not deem me a mere
mystic, a dreamer, and laugh at me; for as I am a living man,
Julian, I saw my mother on the blue waves as we crossed to Holland.
Open your blue eyes if you will, and think my superstitious
southern blood was running reddest in my veins; but it is
true&mdash;true as Heaven itself, that as I stood leaning on the
rail, looking out over the expanse of sea, I saw her form in the
silver path the moonlight made, and that, as plainly as ever I
heard it in life, I heard her voice, like some far off music. 'My
son, let his portrait be where thousands of mortals may see it,
that the living and the dead may be justified, and Heaven's truth
made manifest.' Julian, you may think that some strange
presentiment in mind made me fancy it all, as a dream or vision;
but I believe from my soul that I saw and heard my spirit-mother,
superstitiously imaginative as you may deem it."</p>

<p>"I do not, Angelo; I do believe it; for 'with Heaven all things
are possible,'" was the artist's answer, "and I will work
ceaselessly till the portrait is done. But if Inez was to go to
Forest Moor, when she left school, how is it she went home?"</p>

<p>"It was no use my going," said the Spaniard, "till Vivian was
there; and when Margaret got home she found him absent, and wrote
to me that he would not be there till the 15th of August, this
mouth; so she will get me invited to go on the 19th to have a long
stay."</p>

<p>"Can you trust her?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"She is true as gold," replied Inez. "I should not have trusted
her, probably, if I had not found out her own hatred to them all.
It is my guarantee."</p>

<p>"Inez, Inez," said Julian, gently, "that speech would have come
better from Angelo's lips than yours."</p>

<p>Inez turned aside with starting tears and trembling lips, and,
gentle as his reproof was, true though it might be, Julian's heart
smote him for uttering any reproach to one who loved him so well,
and bending down he pressed a soft kiss of peace on her brow that
called back the smile to her lips.</p>

<p>"Does my mother know all this?" asked Julian, presently.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Angelo. "I saw her and told her. Here is
one of her long letters," and so saying he laid it on the
table.</p>

<p>It was about an hour before they were to leave the following
morning that, as they were together, Julian's Italian servant
opened the door, and announced "La Signora Genevra della
Scala."</p>

<p>Angelo Egerton was standing by the open window, and as the lady
entered, he stepped through it on to the terrace.</p>

<p>Another of those narrow threads on which the weal or woe of a
lifetime often hangs; if he had remained only a second longer, if
he had only half turned his head, untold misery would have been
spared a young and trusting being. But it was not to be&mdash;stern
fate had written otherwise in the sibyline book of the future.
Inez, who was sitting near Julian, saw the young Italian
lady&mdash;a beautiful girl of some eighteen summers, with a soft
Madonna-like face, large sentimental Southern eyes, an arch mouth,
and that rich red golden hair with which the old Italian painters
loved to shade the gentle face of the Virgin, and, indeed, this
fair girl looked not unlike "some Madonna of pure Italian art."</p>

<p>Julian, who had totally forgotten that it was one of her
mornings, rose quickly, exclaiming, "Oh! signora, a thousand
pardons. If I had not culpably forgotten that this was a painting
morning, I would have sent to beg you not to trouble yourself to
come to-day; for I have some old friends who leave me today whom I
had not seen for a long time."</p>

<p>"Old friends! most ungallant signor," said Genevra, glancing at
Inez with a smile. "Well, then, Lucetta and I must go."</p>

<p>"Signora, may I trust to your kindness to pardon me?" said
Julian.</p>

<p>"Readily, signor," she replied, and the fair Genevra extended
her hand, which Julian raised to his lips, and then gracefully
bowed her out.</p>

<p>It was long, very long before the Spanish girl and the Italian
maiden met again; and then how differently was it&mdash;how very,
very differently.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>Tom Courtenay knew everything and everybody; and everything and
everybody knew Tom Courtenay. He could tell you who were the men
most listened to in the House, and what place everyone was member
for, almost as well as our ministerial friend himself, who had been
fifteen years in Parliament, and knew everything by heart. He could
tell you who were the heavy speakers, who were the brilliant ones,
who the jaunty ones, such as a certain noble lord who makes the
House laugh, and gets what he asks. Yes, Tom, from the 'Strangers'
Gallery,' would listen to a heavy debate with the gravity of a
judge, and would remember everything as if he were a walking Times.
He knew all the on dits and reports afloat; could tell you all the
points of the winner of the Derby, and what dancer was the
'favorite,' whistle the popular opera airs, and was a first-rate
judge of wine, could take a hand at whist, or point a billiard cue.
In fact, Tom Courtenay was invaluable, and no picnic or ball, or
merry-making, young or old, was properly complete without him, he
was a sort of person whom every one called 'Tom Courtenay,' and
even the young ladies only 'mistered' him to his face.</p>

<p>Tom and Marion were first cousins; William Courtenay the second
cousin of both. The grandfather of the two first had two sons and a
brother, George, who was the father of William. The elder of the
two sons was Marion's father, the younger was the progenitor of
Tom. William went to the Bar, and now, at forty-five, was a Queen's
Counsellor in large practice; we have but little to do with him.
The two brothers invested their few thousands in neck-or-nothing
speculations; the elder, Richard, made a competency, the younger,
Thomas, realised a fortune. The former died shortly after his
daughter's first marriage; the latter some years before him,
leaving his son a fortune. Tom had no inclination for an
occupation, and unfortunately, had no need of any; and, further,
the great difference in age between him and his cousin, and various
things which had parted them, had made their paths in life diverge
widely, and William only knew that in his early youth Tom had been
rather wild, and had run through a considerable portion of his
father's thousands, but he did not know or even suspect that, save
for the helping hands of Julian D'Arcy and Angelo Egerton, Tom had
been a lost man. Had Tom himself known what only Angelo, Inez, and
Marion knew, that Julian's kindness to him had been the means of
blasting his own young life, even Tom's buoyant spirits must have
failed him, and made him turn from the world, a remorseful, perhaps
a broken-hearted man. But even as it was, he learned a bitter
lesson, made more bitter by the supposed death of Julian, and young
Courtenay arose from his dream and bed of sickness a wiser and a
better man.</p>

<p>It was one morning, about a mouth after we saw Egerton and Inez
in Florence, that Tom Courtenay walked into St. James's Square,
and, ascending the steps of Egerton's house, knocked at the door,
and, when it was opened, he enquired in his brisk way, "Is Sir
Angelo at home? or has he, too, gone out of town?"</p>

<p>"He is still at home, Mr. Tom," replied the servant, and it may
here be remarked that all Egerton's servants had been years with
him, and knew Tom well enough, and distinguished him as "Mr. Tom,"
from his more important cousin the Mr. Courtenay par
excellence.</p>

<p>"Walk in, sir," and he added to Burns, who was crossing the
hall, "where is Sir Angelo?"</p>

<p>"In the library," he replied. "Good morning, Mr. Tom; if you
will step upstairs, I will see if he is at liberty."</p>

<p>Burns preceded him upstairs, and knocked at a door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Egerton's low deep voice, and dismissing Burns
with a nod, Tom opened the library door and walked in.</p>

<p>Angelo was sitting at a table writing, while Leon lay beside
him; but the former threw down his pen to give his hand to Tom, and
his contracted brow relaxed as he said, "Glad to see you, Tom. I
thought you were out of town a month ago."</p>

<p>"Town's quite empty," he replied, "and I've been meaning to go
every day, but couldn't make up my mind where to go to. I've been
everywhere, that's the truth."</p>

<p>"I'm an older man than you, Tom; but I don't find I've been
everywhere," said Egerton, with a quiet smile, "though I think I
have seen more places than you have."</p>

<p>"You take a fellow up too hard, Egerton," said Tom. "Where are
you going?"</p>

<p>"I do not at present intend to leave town," he replied.</p>

<p>Tom's keen eye noticed the hand close more quickly on the
papers, and he said, "Ministerial business, I suppose. Well, all of
you can't be away; but I'm hanged, Egerton, if I'd make such a
slave of myself; not even for Her Most Gracious Majesty. I never
had any ambition."</p>

<p>"Well for you if you had, Tom," said Egerton.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Tom, "to make me slave and work like you do,
and get deep lines on my forehead, and gray hairs, as you have.
Positively, Egerton, you have a few gray hairs, and more lines than
you had eight or even six years ago. No, thank ye, Mr. Statesman,
I'll have none of it."</p>

<p>Egerton drew a little back, so that the shadow of the drawn
window-curtain fell across him; but Tom did not notice the slight
movement, for his eye had caught something else, and he sprang up,
exclaiming, "By Jove, the mysteries of Udolpho in the town house of
an honorable member. What the deuce have you got there,
Egerton?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the upper end of the room, which a few days before
had been blank wall. It was now filled by an immense picture in an
oak frame, but a heavy black velvet curtain completely veiled the
painting itself, and this fact had elicited Tom's exclamation.</p>

<p>Egerton rose quickly, and there was a strange, stern look in his
dark eyes as he hesitated for a moment; then he raised his hand,
and drew back the curtain suddenly. A low exclamation escaped
Courtenay's lips, and he stood gazing in breathless silence on the
portrait revealed.</p>

<p>It was a life-size figure, that seemed half man, half devil. He
stood on the edge of a cliff, mountains towering around and behind
him in gloomy, sullen grandeur, black storm-clouds rolled above,
while, from a lowering mass of gloom a line of forked lightning
seemed actually shooting forth, and cast a lurid light on the
grandly terrible scene; it threw out the black figure in the
foreground, and cast a wild glare on its face, on which the whole
wonderful art and talent of the painter had been
concentrated&mdash;a face so breathing in its living likeness that
it might have been indeed a human countenance for all its fearful
look&mdash;a face never to be forgotten, so passingly handsome, so
awful in its dark, fiendish beauty, such a ruthless intensity of
evil passions in the lurid black eyes, half upraised towards
something above with a world of fierce defiance in them, and yet
through all with a sort of agonised remorse in their depths that
was at strange variance with the black fiendishness of the face and
horrible sneer of the lips, as that upward glance glared on the
mass of gloomy darkness, amidst which, shadowy and indistinct, was
visible a face and a hand holding forth a scroll&mdash;all else
lost in gloom&mdash;looking as faces look in a dream, misty; but
the strange, phantom-like eyes gazed down on him with a steady,
avengeful watchfulness, and the finger pointed sternly to the one
word that seemed bound on the scroll in letters of
fire&mdash;"Tekel!"</p>

<p><i>("Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting
"&mdash;Daniel v., 27.)</i>
</p>

<p>Such is the first part of the history of a portrait. Long did
Courtenay stand gazing on the wonderful work of art, entranced,
fascinated as by a spell; but when at length, with a deep drawn
sigh, as if he was waking from a nightmare, he turned from it, it
was to see Angelo standing with folded arms, watching him
intently.</p>

<p>"Your face has been a study," he said; and somehow his low
thrilling voice fell strangely on Tom's ear.</p>

<p>"Egerton," said he, "I never in all my life saw so strange, so
wonderful a picture. If I lived a thousand years I could never
forget that awful face. What master hand portrayed it?&mdash;what
human brain conceived it? Surely some German one?"</p>

<p>"None," said Egerton. "No human brain imagined the face."</p>

<p>"Egerton!" exclaimed Tom, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, and everything," was the enigmatical and guarded
reply. "Keep your own counsel as to what I have said, and as to
having seen it at all."</p>

<p>"If you wish it," said Tom. "Who painted that master-piece?"</p>

<p>"The same who took my portrait," answered Egerton, drawing the
curtain again&mdash;"Julian Rothesay."</p>

<p>"That accounts for it," said Tom. "Have you noticed the eyes of
the misty being who holds the scroll? They are Inez's eyes to the
life&mdash;just her queer, watchful look."</p>

<p>"Nothing strange in that," answered Egerton, carelessly, "seeing
that he has seen her in Italy often enough."</p>

<p>"If it is not impertinent to ask, Egerton, what might you have
given for this?"</p>

<p>"No impertinence, Tom," he replied. "I gave six hundred guineas
for it."</p>

<p>"You are not going to hide it under a bushel," said Tom. "Why,
it would make the fame of this Rothesay."</p>

<p>"It shall," said Egerton. "I intend to send it to the National
Gallery. The trustees of it will be only too glad of such a loan
for a few months. Then it goes to Falcontower Castle."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, rising to leave, "I called here to have a chat
with you, but I little expected such a rare treat as I have had,
and thank you and Rothesay for it."</p>

<p>Tom Courtenay took his departure, little imagining why Inez de
Caldara's face had been depicted in that of the dream-like avenging
spirit; and still less imagined the terrible history connected, and
yet more in the future fated to be connected, with that
portrait.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>It must be remembered that we are now somewhat retracing our
steps as to time, inasmuch as we find ourselves at Forest Moor on
the 17th of August. Margaret Arundel had persuaded both Stephen
Stanfeld and Eveline to invite her school friend, Jesuita de Castro
(for that was the name the Castilian had assumed), to spend a long
time with her. Well had Margaret carried out the tale and plan
given her by Inez, and with a natural manner and self-possession
few would have given her credit for. She told them that her friend
was a Spaniard from Rio de Janeiro, where her father, the Count de
Castro, lived, and that, for family reasons, she had been recently
sent to England to complete her education, being placed under the
care of a London solicitor, Mr. Seymour, who really existed, being
Sir Angelo Egerton's solicitor, so that on the 17th of August it
was Mr. Henry Seymour who took the young Spaniard 'from Rio' to
Forest Moor station, and put her in the brougham which Mrs. Vivian
had sent to meet her.</p>

<p>It was evening, and in the drawing-room of Forest Moor Grange
sat three people. By the window, seated in an arm-chair, doing
nothing, was a man; sixty years had passed over his head, but they
had not softened his face, nor given it the venerable beauty with
which Time crowns the work of years; very handsome he had once
been, aye, and still was, but he was a gloomy, down-looking man,
with cold dreary gray eyes that had a snake-like glitter now and
then, which belied the outward apathy of his manner.</p>

<p>At some distance sat Margaret Arundel by a lady, whose age might
have been two or three and twenty; but the face, though very
pretty, looked worn and sad, and her whole manner and look told a
tale of a cowed and intimidated being.</p>

<p>The two latter were employing their fingers in some light work,
but all had sat silent for a a long time, till Stephen Stanfeld,
suddenly addressing his daughter, asked, "Where is Arthur?"</p>

<p>She started, and answered hurriedly, "I don't know, papa, but I
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think," said he&mdash;"you ought to know. Has he gone in
the brougham to meet Margaret's South American friend?"</p>

<p>Margaret had not the least fear of Stanfeld, and answered him
with a quiet, pert impudence. "No, he hasn't," she replied; "and I
don't see how Eveline should know his movements better than you do.
He only said he would be in before 9."</p>

<p>Stanfeld raised his eyes, and glanced at her a moment, but he
made no answer, and turned aside, as if he disliked to look at
her.</p>

<p>There was another long silence, broken again by Stanfeld, and in
the same abrupt manner.</p>

<p>"Margaret, does this girl speak only her own lingo?"</p>

<p>"She speaks French and Italian like a native, and English
tolerably well, though with a foreign accent," said Margaret.</p>

<p>As she spoke, the long-expected brougham drove up to the door,
and, springing up, Margaret ran down into the hall.</p>

<p>Stanfeld rose muttering, "As I've allowed this foreigner to be
invited, I must be civil, and not let her think we English
inhospitable."</p>

<p>When Margaret entered with the stranger, Stanfeld received her
with a courtesy neither the Castilian nor her agent had expected,
and introduced her himself to his daughter, Mrs. Vivian; for though
he would not acknowledge it, the tall figure, stately carriage, and
quiet self-possession of the Spaniard had rather 'taken him aback;'
for he had expected a diffident, awkward school-girl of fourteen,
and was in nowise prepared for the reality.</p>

<p>"What a very handsome girl," he remarked to his daughter, when
Margaret had borne off her guest to take off her hat and
mantle.</p>

<p>"Very," said Eveline, adding timidly, "but she has such a grand
air about her."</p>

<p>"Haughty as a Don," said Stanfeld; "ring for tea, child&mdash;we
cannot wait for Arthur."</p>

<p>As she obeyed him, Margaret and Inez reentered, and Stanfeld
immediately offered the latter a chair near his own, saying with a
smile, "I suppose you find our summer rather different to Rio, Miss
de Castro?"</p>

<p>"It is not so hot as our summers, senor, but it is very
beautiful," replied Inez, and Margaret, who knew how purely she
really spoke English, was astonished at the admirable manner in
which she threw such a strong accent into the softly uttered
words.</p>

<p>"You have not been very long in England, I think," said
Eveline.</p>

<p>"Four or five months," replied Inez.</p>

<p>As she spoke, there was a sharp, imperative knock at the hall
door, which rang through the hall with a clang, then steps ascended
the stairs, paused, and a voice said, "Arrived, has she?&mdash;then
give me a light." And then the steps passed on.</p>

<p>A few moments more, and a young man of about eight or nine and
twenty entered the room.</p>

<p>"My nephew, Arthur Vivian&mdash;Miss de Castro," said Stanfeld
at once.</p>

<p>As she slightly returned his low inclination, she lifted her
dark eyes to his. She stood face to face with him, the assassin of
Angelo's mother, and for one second her very life-blood seemed to
stand still. All the fierce, wild emotions of years' vengeance were
crowded into that brief moment, and her heart turned sick and her
brain dizzy; but Egerton's stern training stood her in good stead
now, and the iron hand of self-control held its own.</p>

<p>Yes, there he stood before her, the living, breathing original
of the portrait we have seen! The same exquisitely handsome
features, and dark fiendish beauty; the same ruthless lurid black
eyes, with all their world of passion and evil; there was the same
wicked sneer about the lips, and the same strange burnished,
glittering hair, that looked as if the gorgeous light of a setting
sun had shed its blaze of burning rays on it, and tinged each dark
brown hair with burnished gold. But he could banish the sneer and
wreathe his lips with a smile which showed fatal powers of
fascination&mdash;at any rate to some&mdash;that was a fearful gift
in such hands as his, and Inez, seeing that, understood how Eveline
had been infatuated.</p>

<p>That evening Arthur Vivian took his uncle's cue, and seemed
determined to pay every attention to the guest. As soon as the
tea-tray was removed he asked her if she played or sang; and as
Inez's whole game was to please in every way, she answered
"Yes."</p>

<p>"At sight, Miss de Castro? Would you favor us?" he asked, with
quick eagerness.</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Mr. Vivian," she replied, rising with an air
half careless, half ready, and opened the piano.</p>

<p>Vivian brought a music folio, and choosing a song, placed it
before her. It was that beautiful song, "The Slave."</p>

<p>"I am very fond of this song," he said; "but neither my wife or
Margaret can sing it properly, and with the German words."</p>

<p>"I know but very little of German, senor, then; only what I
picked up in a tour through Germany," said Inez.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Vivian, "but you can still sing the rich German
words."</p>

<p>She made no reply, save to strike the first chords of the
prelude and commence the song; and as the wild mournful melody, so
touching, so expressive in its appealing, wailing melancholy met
his ears, he drew back a little, and a softer shade stole over his
face. He bent over her as the last soft cadences died away, and
said, "Thank you for that song, it is beautiful."</p>

<p>Something in his voice that seemed like the faint echo of
something better; of a day when perhaps he had stood an innocent
child at his mother's knee, made Inez half turn and look up full in
his face, her searching steady eyes gazing direct into his.
Something there was, for one brief second, as if a better angel had
in passing cast the shadow of its wings on his face. It passed,
however, in half a second, and then every line hardened again; and
if for that moment her heart might have softened, the light touch
of her hand&mdash;that hand red with the blood of Angelo's
mother&mdash;steeled her whole soul to sternness. The voice of
Stanfeld, addressing her, made her look towards him.</p>

<p>"Will you sing this, Miss de Castro?" he asked.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, senor," she replied; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"A quaint, strange song of Kingsley's," he replied&mdash;"'Three
Fishers Went Sailing.' The music is Hullah's. I am not generally
fond of music, but this song took even my fancy. Eveline, bring
it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vivian rose, fetched the music, and placed it before Inez,
who, though she had never seen it before, sang it through correctly
and unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I like that song very much," she said, rising as she concluded;
"it has such a quaint beauty about it."</p>

<p>She moved to the table, sat down by Margaret, and began turning
over a book of very choice prints. Arthur watched her a moment, and
then, leaning over the back of her chair, said, "Do you draw at
all, Miss de Castro?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed Margaret, eagerly; "beautifully."</p>

<p>"I take the answer from the lady herself," said Vivian,
quietly.</p>

<p>"I have learned drawing, and I am fond of it," replied Inez,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Have you any drawings with you?" he asked; "may I see
them?"</p>

<p>"I have none with me," she replied. "Look at this, Mr. Vivian!
you must come round; you cannot see it there."</p>

<p>He sat down by her. It was Lady Macbeth, just when she, the
murderess, stands gazing on her blood-stained hands.</p>

<p>Inez's watchful glance saw Vivian start as he saw it, and a
black look crossed his face as he pushed the book away, saying
hastily, "I don't like that picture."</p>

<p>"I do," said the Spaniard; "it is so life-like. You can
picture&mdash;fancy the horror and terror of the murderess&mdash;as
she sees the blood on her hands. I like the engraving."</p>

<p>"Curse that girl!" muttered Vivian, turning away, but not so low
as to prevent Inez's quick ear from catching the words; and when
she and Margaret retired to their room that night she said, "He
won't like me now; but he shall fear me before long. To-morrow I
begin; and do not be surprised if I encourage the attention and
courtesy he seems inclined at present to show me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>Nothing but the fearful interests at stake could have upheld
Inez de Caldara in the path which now lay before her. None but such
a nature as hers, nothing but such masculine strength of purpose
and will, could have gone through it at all; but in all and through
all, the love she bore to Angelo sustained and upheld her like some
magic talisman. And was it not a talisman indeed, planted by the
hand of God in her heart, to bear a flower that should scatter its
seeds to heaven?</p>

<p>It was after breakfast the next morning that Arthur Vivian came
up to her, and said, "Miss de Castro, I suppose you ride?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "It is the principal mode of moving about at
Rio."</p>

<p>"There are some fine views in our neighborhood," said he; "but
I'm afraid we have not a lady's horse in the stable. Eveline only
rides a quiet pony, and mine and my uncle's horses are perhaps more
wild than you like."</p>

<p>"I am used to half-tamed animals, senor," she replied, "and I
should like very much to see the scenery about here."</p>

<p>"Would you?" said Arthur; "then come round with me to the
stables and see which horse you will like to ride; and while they
saddle the horses, I will show you the grounds."</p>

<p>"If you like," said Inez, in her usual quiet way, that showed
neither pleasure nor dissent. "But call Margaret&mdash;or stay; I
will do so, and put on my riding habit."</p>

<p>He bit his lip; but, without seeming to notice it, the Castilian
left the room.</p>

<p>Stanfeld, who was in the room, turned suddenly round, and said,
"Arthur, what are you up to in that quarter?"</p>

<p>Vivian met his gaze unmoved, and replied coolly, "It is always
wise to be civil and courteous to the wealthy. This beautiful
Spaniard is an heiress, and in England friendless. Now do you
see?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the other, curtly, "I do."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Inez de Caldara made her way to Margaret, and told her
where she was going, adding, "Come with me, Margaret."</p>

<p>"I will, round the gardens, dear Inez," she replied, "but I'm no
rider, and I'm afraid of the horses."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vivian's pony," suggested Inez.</p>

<p>"No, old Stanfeld don't like me taking it," said Margaret;
"besides, it couldn't keep pace with you. Inez, are you not afraid
of going out alone with Vivian?"</p>

<p>"No," said Inez, "why should I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez, be careful," said Margaret. "I tell you, if he has
any suspicion, he will murder you."</p>

<p>"No," said the other, quietly, "he may try, but he will not
succeed. He will try as soon as he begins to fear me, but I am more
than his match. He would not dare sudden poison, and I am too much
on my guard for slow poisons to succeed."</p>

<p>"Inez," said Margaret, "it is horrible to hear you so coolly
calculate your own chances of life and death."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Inez, and a sad smile flitted over her grave face.
"I have seen death in too horrible a form to have much fear of it
for itself."</p>

<p>"But, Inez, are you forgetting how desperate any suspicion of
the truth will make that devil incarnate; that he will as soon use
a knife or pistol as poison."</p>

<p>"I have forgotten nothing, Margaret. I have calculated to a
hair's breadth all the heavy chances against me, and the light ones
for me. I know that my life may be in hourly danger, but whatever
means he may try, I shall not come by my death till I have placed
in Angelo's hands the means of bringing home to Vivian's head his
deadly crime. Now I am ready. Come."</p>

<p>Margaret followed her to the hall, where Vivian was waiting for
them. He first led the way to the stables, which contained four
horses, the carriage one, Eveline's pony, and Arthur and Stanfeld's
own horses. The coachman and groom were in the stable yard as they
entered, and Vivian ordered them to lead out 'Cassy' and 'Piers
Gaveston' for the lady to see.</p>

<p>The men obeyed, and led out from their stalls two horses, a
brown and a bay, both fine looking animals, but, as Inez at once
saw, skittish and "skeerish," if not vicious; for the instant she
approached the bay one, Cassy, it laid back its delicate ears,
rolled its eyes, and tried to run back, an attempt the groom
foiled.</p>

<p>"Come, Cass, no tricks," said Vivian; "hold her steady, Forde.
Which will you ride, Miss de Castro?"</p>

<p>The groom started, and exclaimed, "Mr. Arthur, you ain't going
to put that young lady on either o' these animals, surely. Look how
skeery they are; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue till you're asked to speak," said Vivian,
flushing with passion.</p>

<p>"Let him speak," said Inez, almost imperiously; "finish your
speech, Forde, if you please."</p>

<p>For one moment there was a perfectly fiendish glare in Arthur's
eye, and he muttered inwardly, "I'll give her a fright for this,"
as Forde said, "I was only a going to say, miss, that such a little
hand as yours won't be able to hold in these ere hosses. Don't
mount either of 'em, miss."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your care, my friend," said Inez, "but I am used
to a high-spirited horse, and can, I don't doubt, hold in Cassy. Is
she vicious?"</p>

<p>"No, miss, I don't think she ain't; but she's full o'
tricks."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Vivian, with something like a sneer, "you had
better not ride her at all."</p>

<p>"I should not be laughed into doing so, if I thought her really
vicious," said the Castilian quietly; "but I think I will take her.
Is she yours?"</p>

<p>"No, my uncle's," replied Vivian. "Saddle them, Forde, and bring
them round."</p>

<p>Giving his arm to Inez, he left the stable-yard; but a sign from
the groom made Margaret linger and remain.</p>

<p>"What is it, Forde?" she asked.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Miss Margaret, don't let the young lady go
out alone with Mr. Arthur on Cass. Go and get your uncle to say he
wants the horse, or that she mayn't go out&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>"It's no use, Forde," she replied. "You know of old its no use
any of us trying to outdo Mr. Vivian."</p>

<p>"Then speak to the young lady, miss," said Forde.</p>

<p>But Margaret knew that Inez had a purpose even in this
ride&mdash;she must know the country well, and she replied, "She
has said she will go, and she will; and, indeed, Forde, if Cass
isn't vicious, there's not much fear; my friend is a capital rider.
Why are you so apprehensive?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Mr. Arthur's most sure to take her round by the
river and over the railway bridge; and if a train comes up, Cassy's
quite safe to start tricks,&mdash;rearing or bolting as she did
with Mr. Roland Aubrey three years back, when she throwed him; and,
besides, miss, you'll pardon me, miss, for what I'm going to say,
but Mr. Arthur had an ugly look when the young lady told me to
speak. I'm a' most sure Miss Margaret, that he wants to get young
miss out on that hoss. Mr. Arthur's got as vicious a temper as our
old 'White Jake' used to," said the groom, lowering his voice
confidentially.</p>

<p>"Forde, you frighten me for her," said Margaret. "Can't you
mount the brougham horse, and go with them?"</p>

<p>"No use, miss; Mr. Arthur wouldn't hear on it."</p>

<p>"We can only hope no harm will happen. Thank you, Forde, for
your warning," and she left the yard to follow the other two, and
get a chance of warning Inez, but she could not do so until they
returned to the house; and then, while Vivian went in to fetch his
whip, Margaret hastily repeated what the groom had said.</p>

<p>"I can't help it now," said Inez, quite unmoved, "if I refuse
now, he will see it is him, not the horse, that I am afraid of; and
listen, Margaret: if once I let him see I fear him, I lose the
whole game; he is my master instead of me being his; at present, I
have the mastery, and must keep it at all hazards. I shall go this
ride, and take my chance of everything."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, dear Inez, take care of Cassy," said
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Hush! here they come!" interrupted the Castilian; and as Forde
led up the two horses, Arthur appeared.</p>

<p>"Hold her head tight, Forde," said Vivian.</p>

<p>"Take care, Jesuita," said Margaret; "she'll run back the moment
you mount."</p>

<p>Without speaking a word, Arthur Vivian lifted Inez in his strong
arms, swung her to the saddle, and in a moment had her foot in the
stirrup, and the reins in her hand, before Cassy had time to know
anything about it; but as Arthur mounted, and Forde let go her
head, Madam Cassy backed some paces, and reared a little. In a
moment Vivian's hand was on the bridle; but Inez's whip across the
ears had already brought her down.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, senor," said the Spaniard, "if I ask you to leave me
to manage her; if she gets beyond me, I will ask assistance from
you."</p>

<p>He bowed, and the groom said admiringly to Margaret, "Young miss
knows how to ride, and I'm thinking after all, that Cass won't
throw her; and I'm sure by the look of her, Miss Margaret, that Mr.
Arthur won't succeed in frightening her. She'll be too much for
him."</p>

<p>Margaret made no reply until the riders had passed the lodge at
the gates, then she said, "Why do you think he wants to frighten
Miss de Castro, Forde?"</p>

<p>The groom gave her a shrewd glance, as he replied, "'Cause,
miss, he just gave her in the stable-yard, one of his real devilish
looks, just like a vicious horse gives when he means to throw you.
Mr. Arthur's very spiteful like, and he won't easily forget how she
put him down. Miss Margaret, is that furrin missy going to stop
here long?"</p>

<p>"I think so, Forde," she replied. "Why?"</p>

<p>The man glanced round, bent down, and whispered earnestly,
"Then, miss, don't let her make an enemy of Mr. Arthur. He's got
the very devil in him, if ever man had."</p>

<p>Margaret turned deadly pale, and such a sudden, dire
presentiment of evil came over her, that she laid her hand on the
groom's arm, and said, "Forde, you have been here a long time. If
anything happens, stand our friend. Let us be able to depend upon
you."</p>

<p>"That you may, miss, every bit, bless your pretty face!" said
the groom. "I don't wonder at your disliking master and Mr. Arthur.
I do, I know, and I shouldn't have stayed so long but for yours and
Mrs. Arthur's sake. You've always spoke kind-like to me. Grooms has
feelings, miss; and somehow I can't find it in me to leave you two
young helpless doves alone with such bad 'uns as master and Mr.
Arthur."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you from my heart, Forde," said the girl,
deeply touched at the honest, simple affection of his words; then,
turning away, she hurried into the house, while Forde betook
himself to the stables, and told Miles, the coachman, "that Miss
Margaret was the dearest and best young lady he ever set eyes
on."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Spaniard and her companion turned into the high
road, and after going a little distance he led her to the top of a
high mound which he said commanded an extensive view; and he was
right. To the south, about a mile distant, lay Forest Moor Grange,
with its wild grounds running wild with the rank grass growing all
over the paths and lawns; and the old wandering house, with its
gable ends and turrets, thrown out in fine relief by the dark
rookery behind it. Beyond the grounds, farms dotted the country for
miles; green meadows, tracts of land with waving corn, and rich
wooding. About a quarter of a mile north of the Grange
boundary:</p>

<p>'A river, like a stream of haze,</p>

<p>Drew its slow length, until 'twas lost in woods.'</p>

<p>A wide river, navigable for boats, it was that wound along,
gleaming like silver in the sun. On the south side, Forest Moore
itself stretched along its banks; and far away south, on the
opposite bank, about north-east by east from the Grange, lay the
pretty village of Forest Moor, flanked by the romantic and somewhat
extensive woods, which, once a forest, had not only retained that
name, but given it also to the moor, the village, and the grange.
Crossing the river close to the village, and reaching the south
bank not half a mile from the Grange, was a very pretty iron
bridge, whose only fault was its modernness. The railway skirted
the moor, and went over the bridge, which was built wide enough to
allow a broad foot passenger roadway to cross it too, being
separated from the line by a strong high iron railing. The high
road crossed the old stone bridge about a quarter of a mile up the
river, and consequently the foot-road over the railway bridge was
the nearest way to the village and station for those coming from
the Grange or that direction.</p>

<p>"And generally," said Vivian, "my uncle and I use it, even on
horseback."</p>

<p>"Don't the station people stop you?" asked Inez.</p>

<p>"The station don't command the bridge," said Vivian. "And there
is a short-cut from the Grange to the bridge. Do you see that field
and wood which lie between the palings of the Grange and Forest
Moor Bridge&mdash;that's it name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Inez.</p>

<p>"Can you see a path crossing the field?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Plainly," she replied. "It enters the wood."</p>

<p>"Now turn to the river," said Vivian; "there is the path coming
out on its path, just by the bridge, under the very shadow of the
last arch. You have nothing to do but to get up the bank, and you
are on the bridge. The village isn't ten minutes' walk that
way."</p>

<p>"And is it safe?" she asked. "Could Maggie or I go that way
alone?"</p>

<p>"Any time you like," he replied; "the path is a private one, and
the river banks are very lonely."</p>

<p>A stern smile crossed Inez's dark face. That path would one day
be useful to her.</p>

<p>"Which way shall we turn?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We had better ride across the moor," he replied. "It is very
pretty, and a fine space for a gallop. Then we can cross the river
at a bridge six miles off, come along the north bank, ride through
the village, and cross the iron bridge home."</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied, without the least sign of fear at the
latter idea.</p>

<p>They rode on again, Cassy behaving very well till the fresh
breeze, sweeping over the wide moor, met her nostrils, when she
threw up her head, tugged at her bridle, till her rider could
hardly hold her in; but, finding such firm resistance to her
pranks, she gave a few plunges and attempted to rear, in the vain
attempt to throw her rider. But Inez was too sharp, for she threw
her whip heavily over her ears, and brought Cassy down.</p>

<p>"Senor," she said quickly, "keep pace with me. I see I must take
a bit of the wildness out of Cassy before she'll behave
properly."</p>

<p>With the word she gave the mare the rein, touched her lightly,
and away flew Cassy like a shot, Arthur's horse, however, keeping
well up with her.</p>

<p>Neither rider spoke, it was impossible; but Inez never for a
moment lost the command of the animal she rode, and when Cassy was
pretty well winded she drew rein, and said coolly, "I never let a
horse conquer me. She has some vice in her, but she will be quiet
for a time now."</p>

<p>Arthur could not help admiring his beautiful and determined
companion; but he was disappointed and annoyed that she had shown
no alarm, and in his evil, vengeful heart, he vowed to make her
acknowledge herself frightened before he had done with her. He had
a double motive&mdash;pique was one, the other was that he wanted
to place her in some dangerous predicament, from which he should
rescue her, and thus place her at the outset under a deep
obligation to him. Already, in his base heart, and fiendish mind,
had he conceived an end for which even now he had begun to play a
deep game; but he was playing it against one far his superior in
intellect, subtlety, and power&mdash;one who, girl as she was,
could and did detect each move he made, and defeat it.</p>

<p>It was long past midday when they reached the village, a pretty,
rural-looking one, which elicited from Inez the exclamation, "What
a pretty village!"</p>

<p>As they reached the bridge, an express train appeared in sight
and hearing, and Cassy pricked up her ears, glared wildly round,
and to Vivian's delight, sprang forward to the middle of the bridge
as the train dashed past. That the horse was frightened of trains
Arthur well knew, but even he had not expected or wished for the
result of his own revengeful manoeuvre. The moment the train
passed, the animal, wild with terror, began plunging with a fury
that threatened to fling her rider over the low parapet into the
river. Arthur attempted to grasp the bridle, for he saw a down
train approaching; but Cassy ran back, reared till she stood
upright, pawing the air with her forefeet, and as the down train
passed she uttered a wild shriek of mad terror, and leaped clear
over into the river.</p>

<p>From what had passed in the stable-yard, the sharp-sighted
groom, Forde, had his suspicions, and very strong ones, that Vivian
would try and vent his petty revenge on Inez, by giving her a
fright at the bridge, because he knew that trains never failed to
half madden Cassy. Forde had therefore gone quietly out, and
ensconced himself under the bridge that he might watch; but the
heat made him fall asleep, and the first thing that woke him was
the horse's shriek, and he was on his feet in a moment. He saw
Cassy leap with her rider still on her back, saw both steed and
rider sink, and the next moment saw Inez rise to the surface, and
strike out strongly. Forde saw that she could swim, and though the
blow of the water had so stunned Cassy, Inez was unhurt; but he
also saw that in a minute, indeed already, that her long riding
dress must drag her down, and to fling off his coat, shoes, and
hat, and plunge in was the work of a moment.</p>

<p>Just as the horrified Vivian gained the bank, Forde reached the
already sinking girl, and flung his powerful arm round her, bidding
her lie still, and not cling to him.</p>

<p>Her white, firm face was his answer, and his strong strokes soon
brought them both to land, almost at the same time as the poor mare
gained it a few yards further down.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" exclaimed Vivian, with remorseful anxiety. "Are
you unharmed, Miss de Castro?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to Forde's timely help, I am safe," she said, rising her
eyes to the groom's with an expression that fully repaid him, "I am
only wet, and so is Forde. I will ride Cassy home."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily, and replied, "I was not afraid all
through." Again too much for him, again defeated. He turned away,
caught Cassy, and lifted Inez, drenched as she was, to the
saddle.</p>

<p>To ask Vivian to resign his horse to the groom Inez knew was
hopeless, so she said, "Run home quickly, Forde; if harm come to
you, I should never forgive myself."</p>

<p>It was after dark that evening, that as Forde was locking up the
stables the tall figure of Inez stood before him.</p>

<p>"Forde," she said, and her voice trembled with emotion, "I could
not speak my deep gratitude before the man who purposely got the
horse there when he saw the train coming. I shall never forget you,
and whenever you look at this, remember, it is a token of the
gratitude of Jesuita de Castro."</p>

<p>She took off the gold watch she herself wore, and threw the
chain round his neck; then, suddenly bending down, she clasped his
rough hand in hers and pressed her lips on it, and there were tears
on it when she was gone.</p>

<p>"God bless her?" muttered the groom, brushing his hand over his
eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>We must now turn to some interesting memoirs by Margaret
Arundel, written from notes made at the time; hence she speaks in
the past tense. After giving some girlish reminiscences of her
first arrival at the school of Mrs. Ashton at Yellowfield, and her
subsequent introduction to Inez de Caldara and Isbel Rochester, the
former of whom peculiarly excited her attention and interest, she
thus proceeds with her own early life:&mdash;</p>

<p>When I look back through the distance of years to that wretched
time at Forest Moor, it seems like some horrible dream. I marvel
how I bore it, and, oh! I wonder to this day how Inez went through
it all, though it was not more than a few months. I watched with
wonder the way she held her mastery over Vivian; it is only a few
words relative to that which I write down here. After that day she
conquered him about the mare Cassy he did not behave to her so very
ultra-civilly; he would speak with a sneer, but she answered his
sneer with cutting, bitter sarcasms, cold and hard as steel, but so
veiled that he could not lay hold of them, though I have seen him
writhe under her irony as if an asp had stung him.</p>

<p>She used to sit apparently reading or writing, but whenever I
looked up suddenly I saw those strange dark eyes of hers fixed on
Vivian. She seemed to watch him more closely every day and week
that passed, and at last he began to grow nervous and fidgetty
whenever she was present, and not merely that, but when she was not
in the room&mdash;for she moved so swiftly and silently that one
minute she would be in the garden, and the next, as if by magic,
she was at our side, with those eyes, that seemed to read one
through, on Vivian. She has made even me nervous at night,
sometimes, with the sudden way she came upon me from heaven knows
where, always so still and silent; she rarely spoke, always with
her black eyes on me, looking as if they read every thought, as I'm
sure they did. It made me nervous, in the same way that a black cat
gazing at me in the dark does; because it is horrible to me to see
such a keenly searching look in the eyes of any silent creature
that comes upon one suddenly and silently as a cat does at
night&mdash;as she did. But Arthur grew more nervous every day and
hour, till he came to distrust and dread and fear that child. He
was uneasy and restless if she was present; he was the same if she
was absent, because of the constant dread of her coming, and yet he
couldn't help glancing at her; and though she always drooped her
eyes when he looked towards her, he knew that the moment he turned
his own away, those black orbs would be fixed upon his face,
reading every change and expression. One night he turned sharply
away, as if wrenching himself from some fascination, and I heard
him mutter, "I hate that child's dark face! I hate her to look at
me with her evil eyes!"</p>

<p>Heaven knows, he had reason to fear any one who watched him so
steadily&mdash;her, more than any living being; but I did not
sympathise with him. I had always feared and disliked him, and the
more he grew to distrust and dread Inez, the more I grew to dislike
and fear and hate him, and gradually there grew into my dislike and
hatred of him a distrust and suspicion&mdash;idea, fancy, if you
will&mdash;that he would some day do the child a mischief.</p>

<p>One day when she was out he began looking through some drawers
he kept locked, but she came in meanwhile. Closing the last drawer,
he turned to meet the steady gaze of Inez, as she stood in the
doorway, and as he pushed past her I heard him mutter, fiercely,
"Curses on that dark-faced child."</p>

<p>From that day my suspicion and distrust grew upon me, day by
day, and hour by hour, till I could not bear to have both Vivian
and Inez out of my sight together. I reached that point when she
had been six weeks with us. I marvelled if she felt any of the
dread of him which she had inspired him with. I asked her one day,
"Inez, are you not afraid of Vivian? Have you no fear of him?"</p>

<p>"Do I look as if I was afraid?" she said, turning her dark grave
face full towards me. "Do I ever show any fear? Do I act as if I
was afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied.</p>

<p>"No; he is afraid of me," said Inez; "his very soul trembles
with dread and fear when I watch him; and he shall have cause to
fear me," she said with a fierce flash in her black eyes, and
setting her foot down as if she were crushing some reptile under
her heel, "he shall learn one dark bitter day that his fear of me
had foundation in his own guilty conscience."</p>

<p>"But, Inez, I wish you would not ride with him alone," said I.
"If you feel no fear of him I do; and I am as certain as that I
stand here that he will do you evil. Can you, who have learned to
read men so closely, tell me why it is that he doesn't either get
Stanfeld to send you away, or go away himself? It's a riddle I
cannot read."</p>

<p>"I think I can read it for you," she replied. "For the first he
knows that even Stanfeld could not be so utterly rude as to give me
a hint. For the second, there are mixed motives. In the very nature
of his indefinite nightmare, nervous dread of me, there is a
fascination, which detains him and forces him to stay; if that
dread could assume a defined form or shape, he would murder me or
fly; but the very vagueness of the phantom-like, nameless thing of
horror he fears, has a weird fascination that, like a thing of
magic, makes him stay. Moreover there lurks in his mind, in the
same undefined way, a feeling that he will not be scared from his
home by a child. But neither feeling, as I said, has form or shape;
the instant the chaos assumes a clear form he will fly, or, more
likely, try to murder me."</p>

<p>"Inez!" I exclaimed, "you know that and go on! Merciful heaven,
what mighty motive can influence you to peril so much?"</p>

<p>"The stake at hazard is more than life and death," was her
reply; "and having once put my hand to the plough, I would not, if
I could, look back. From the moment I set foot in this house, it
has been 'Strike lest you be struck.' I must strike him to the
ground, crush him under my foot, or he will crush me."</p>

<p>She moved away, but when she had gone a few paces she paused,
and for a minute turned her strange, grave face to me, so
steadfast, so calm, but one with such a look on it, that as she
glided away I involuntarily stretched my arms towards the
retreating form, and from my very soul burst the bitter cry, "So
young and fair! Oh, merciful Father, save her! save her!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was that very evening that, as we sat in the drawing-room
before the candles came in, Vivian, who had been pacing restlessly
to and fro, stopped suddenly before Inez de Caldara and asked her
to sing something&mdash;he didn't care what. She rose instantly,
and glided to the piano. He stood by with folded arms, looking down
on her with that evil face of his, till I shuddered for her.</p>

<p>Inez had a wonderful memory, and knew by heart a quantity of
choice music, and now the first thing I heard was her rich mellow
voice, singing that beautiful prayer in 'Oberon.' I don't know what
it was, whether it was her music or some deep vein of melancholy in
her voice, but if she sang anything of a plaintive or mournful
character, it rarely failed to move him; if ever so little, it was
only a slight softening of the lines of his face and of his eyes
that indicated anything; but I think if Eveline could have sang or
played as Inez did, he might have been a better man, not so lost a
being. I don't know. I am most likely mistaken; for looking at his
face, it is such an incarnation of inborn devilry that I don't
think there is as much good in him as a fly would hold.</p>

<p>Inez wandered on from one thing to another, till I heard her
singing something, I don't recollect what, from 'La Somnambula.' As
she struck the last chord she dropped her hands suddenly, and
fixing her black eyes on Vivian, said abruptly, "I am a
somnambulist."</p>

<p>I saw him start and shiver. "Ugh!" said he, "I don't like
somnambulism. I've heard of sleep-walkers committing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murder," added Inez, quietly, and with her steady gaze on him.
"Yes, I have heard of such things. I nearly killed one of our
slaves at Rio about eight or nine years ago; but fortunately I only
wounded him."</p>

<p>Vivian shivered again, and the hand, which rested on the back of
a chair, grasped it almost convulsively; but she added, "There are
more crimes committed by wide awake people than by all the
somnambulists put together."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly away, and left the room.</p>

<p>I knew Inez had been telling a falsehood, and I wondered what
her motive could be. That she had one I was convinced, for nothing
she did in that house was without some deep motive.</p>

<p>When we went up to bed I said, "Inez, what on earth made you
tell such tales to Vivian? You are not a somnambulist."</p>

<p>"Of course not," she replied, coolly; "but a mind like his has a
superstitious fear of somnambulists; and besides, if he should meet
me at night wandering about the house, I shall be able to play that
game with him."</p>

<p>"Child," said I, "you are a living riddle! Why should you wander
about at night?"</p>

<p>I was sitting in a low chair as I spoke, and she turned from the
glass, knelt at my feet, and laying her arms on my lap, said,
"Perhaps I should have told you this much before&mdash;I do so now.
When Angelo's mother was murdered, there were jewels
stolen&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused. It was an effort to speak so calmly and steadily as
she did; but in a moment she mastered herself, and went on.</p>

<p>"The jewels were stolen, and he has them even now."</p>

<p>"Stay," said I. "How can you tell me that, Inez? He has probably
sold them long ago."</p>

<p>"No, has not," said Inez, in her decided way. "He would not have
dared to let any human being know he had them, for they are so
marked that they could be traced directly. There is one bracelet at
least that he would sooner have flung into the sea than pass it.
No, he has them, and I must have them. I have watched and searched,
but as yet I have found no trace or hint of their concealment. They
are not in his private places, for I have tried them with the keys
I brought with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez, you haven't looked?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her lips paled a little, but she said steadily, "When I came
here, Margaret, I took into my heart the Jesuit doctrine that 'the
end sanctifies the means,' and I have followed that out. All that
is repugnant to my very soul I have done, and do, and will
unhesitatingly do. If, to gain that end, lying and deceiving is
necessary&mdash;and it is&mdash;I will lie, and bend, and stoop to
all I abhor as dishonorable. Do you think," she said, rising and
confronting me with that passionate face I had seen once, and but
once before&mdash;"do you think that it costs me nothing to act so?
Do you think that my pride, my whole nature does not revolt under
it? Do you think that because I am so outwardly cold, and
passionless, and calm, that I have no feelings?"</p>

<p>"Dear Inez," I interrupted eagerly, "I meant no reproach, indeed
I did not. I never meant to pain you."</p>

<p>I threw my arms round her, but for the first time I felt that
she had passions of strength and depth&mdash;almost fierceness,
which even I had never suspected had existence; and for the first
time, also, I appreciated to its full value, her complete and
wonderful mastery over herself, partly the result of her own
nature, partly of the training she had received.</p>

<p>"You have searched," I said, returning to the former subject,
"everywhere, and can find no trace. Can you got no hint from
him?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "I have assured myself that he has them in
his possession, and I must find them. All is useless without the
jewels. Once in my hands, they are a proof against him. They are a
clue in themselves. Now, listen. I have taken all this time to
search this house through from top to bottom. While you and all
else slept, I have been searching like a French detective, his
room, Stanfeld's, even the servants' rooms; greenhouses, stables,
and lofts have not escaped me. In every place where I suspected a
concealment I have searched, and I have completely satisfied myself
that what I seek is not anywhere in the house or out-buildings; but
now, having last night got to the end of all these, I have to-day
looked about and discovered another and last place where it may be,
and if it is not there, heaven help me, for my last resource will
be exhausted!"</p>

<p>"What place do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "at the west wing of the old ruined
chapel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inez!" I exclaimed, "they cannot be there&mdash;the chapel is a
mere bit of wall."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not there, Margaret," she replied; "but in the lower
cloisters, the vaults beneath it, where all the Surreys lie buried.
To-night I shall take full rest, and to-morrow night I
commence."</p>

<p>"Inez&mdash;oh, Inez! you cannot," I cried. "You will never be
able to go there alone at midnight."</p>

<p>"I see you do not know me yet," said Inez. "I, who do not fear
this living fiend I am contending with, am not likely to fear the
dead who sleep and are at rest."</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," I said.</p>

<p>"Not for anything," she replied. "The danger and risk are mine.
I know and trust myself. Keep up the tale I commenced to-day.
Good-night now, Margaret," she said; and we laid down and
slept.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>It was near midnight, that mystic hour of shades and shadows,
when a tall, slight figure, closely cloaked, glided from the Grange
and struck boldly amongst the lofty trees of the rookery, which
bent and moved as the night wind swept amongst them with a low,
mournful sound like the plaintive wailing of some mourning spirit.
The wanderer paused a moment to listen and glance back, but all was
still, and the straight moonbeams which now and then struggled
through the dark clouds revealed nothing but an old house, and Inez
glided swiftly on towards the west side of the mansion. There had
once been a chapel there in the old time, when the chanting of the
priests in the rich service of the mass had risen from its sacred
walls, or the soft vesper hymn had been wont to steal gently on the
calm evening air; but rude and desecrating hands had dismantled it
in the civil wars, and it had gradually fallen utterly to decay, so
that nothing but a portion of the walls stood; rank grass and woods
grew wild and tangled where the font had been, and the poisonous
hemlock and deadly nightshade trailed their leaves where once had
stood the sacred altar. A portion of the open cloisters still
stood, and in them was the entrance to the lower cloisters, which
ran for a good way under the ground.</p>

<p>Setting down the dark lantern she carried under her mantle, the
Spaniard by a great exertion of strength, and she was
unromantically strong, raised the slab of pavement which formed the
entrance, and laying it right back she took up the lantern, opened
the bull's eye, and descended the steep stone steps it disclosed.
At the bottom of this dark stairway was an iron gate, rusty with
damp and age, but it was locked. Inez, nowise daunted, threw back
her mantle, and the light flashed on a thick belt, profusely
garnished with the various implements stuck in it&mdash;a fine
file, such as runs through iron almost as quickly as a saw walks
through wood, a coarser one, a stout handled hammer, a chisel, a
gimblet, and a large strong clasp knife with a patent catch. This
our daring adventurer now drew, inserted it deliberately between
the lock and the gate, and in a moment the old rusty lock yielded
to the pressure; she pushed back the gate, entered, and setting
down her lantern on the steps of a massive column near the gate,
she looked round her. Behind her was the gateway she had entered
by; before her were a pair of tall iron gates, such as are seen in
burial vaults, and behind these were, dimly discernible in the deep
gloom, the white pillars and the tombs where rested many a Surrey
who had lived and died long ago. Within four or five feet of Inez
was a simple slab of stone, a grave so old that the inscription was
almost effaced, and the tall cross at its heads, loosened by age
and damp from its hold in the ground, leaned a little, as if
bending sadly over the lonely grave of one whom tradition whispered
had died very young&mdash;the old mournful story&mdash;a young
heart broken, and an early grave.</p>

<p>Strange and gloomy and dreary was the place, with its mournful
graves and its muttering echoes dying sadly away among the frowning
arches, which seemed to disappear in gloom and darkness; with the
owl hooting drearily from its perch amongst the lofty columns, and
looking with its ghostly eyes through the tall iron gates, while
the 'midnight raven found a perch' on the cross of some grave, and
the bat flapped its ominous wings against the iron bars, or swept
them past the old gray columns, and the snake crept hissing away
amongst the white rank grass which sprang up out of the green
dampness of the place; there were mouldering bones and grinning
skulls within those iron gates that the coffins could no longer
hold, and had burst asunder, casting their ghastly burden forth;
there was death everywhere&mdash;in every grave and mouldering
bone, in the very stones and close, vault-like, deathly air; and
even Inez's bold, fearless spirit, that would unflinchingly have
faced physical danger, now quailed before the imaginary terrors
which the hour and gloomy horror of the place awoke in her vivid
imagination, and perhaps in the innate shade of natural
superstition which runs like a fine vein through imaginative
minds.</p>

<p>It required more stern control and iron exercise of will than
anything had yet called forth to make her stand firm, and collect
and bend her faculties to that which was the purpose of her life,
but even in the creeping horror that was crawling over her, she did
not wish for Margaret. "No," she murmured, "if this place of death
can unnerve me, I am glad indeed I refused her. Out upon my
cowardly heart, that it has not more of Angelo's spirit!"</p>

<p>The muttering echo answered back, as if a ghostly voice had
spoken, "More of Angelo's spirit," and the child started violently,
but the very name of Angelo had a power that sent the brave blood
of her fathers through her veins; and once more taking up the
lantern, she advanced to the lofty gates, satisfied from her
knowledge of Vivian's mind that he would have concealed the jewels
in some remote corner; for he had not, she knew, the depth of
subtlety which would step out of the ordinary line and place the
jewels in such a public place that no one in a thousand would ever
look for them there. She had taken pains to find out the calibre
and cast of his mind before she searched anywhere, and, finding it
cunning without subtlety, she directed her movements
accordingly.</p>

<p>Now therefore, she examined the gates; tight-locked, chained, so
that to force either lock or chain was hopeless; but examining the
padlock and chain closely, she observed that neither were very
old&mdash;certainly not so old as the rest. Moreover, she detected
one or two small things that did not look as if a workman's hand
had been there; and as she saw this her very heart throbbed, for
she felt sure that what she sought was within those gates.</p>

<p>How to get past them. The bars, which were old and rusty, were
close together; but by removing one of them, there would be an
aperture not quite a foot wide, still wide enough for her slight
form to force itself through.</p>

<p>She drew the fine file from her belt, knelt down, totally
heedless of the loathsome reptiles and relics of the dead around,
and began her work; and the bats and owls and ravens flew in alarm
about the vaults as the sharp, steady whir-whir of the file
re-echoed through the cloisters. So old and rust-eaten was the
metal that it was not long before the bar was filed through at the
bottom; and then, placing the file breast high, she commenced
again, and in ten minutes about five foot of the bar lay at her
feet, and she had squeezed through the opening.</p>

<p>So far all had gone well with Inez. After having gained access
to the dismal vault, the next question was, where would Vivian have
been likely to conceal the casket? Not in any excavation under the
pavement, for the damp would destroy the contents, and not inside
any of the coffins, for with his hands yet red with blood he would
not have dared, she was sure, to open a coffin; for no reverence,
she was equally sure, for the human dust within would have
restrained him. She stood for some minutes revolving in her mind
the probabilities and likelihoods of the question; and she decided
that he would have made some excavation in a column, and she
therefore began, one after another, examining the pillars, knowing
that she should detect anything like a mark; but the first, second,
and third row had clearly not been touched. Again she paused, and
began a course of mental reasoning from her knowledge of
Arthur.</p>

<p>"He will not have singled a column by chance, or taken the first
that offered or took his eye," she reasoned, "he will have had some
reason for his choice. In the state of mind he was in so shortly
after the murder, the most likely thing to actuate him will have
been an indefinite, to himself almost unconscious feeling of
superstition, that would make him catch at any straw of safety,
however absurd. The first thing that such a frame and direction of
superstition would do would be to recall to his mind the traditions
of lucky numbers, and in choosing his pillar, he will unconsciously
have been guided by that. At any rate, I will for the present
assume such to have been his course, and draw my own from it. I
have already examined the third row without any result. He has most
likely, then, chosen the seventh row, and either the third,
seventh, or twenty first column; probably the last, as containing
three times seven, he will in that mood have held it three times as
lucky; therefore I shall first try that column."</p>

<p>She arrived at this conclusion in an infinitely shorter time
than it takes to write or read it, and advancing towards the
twenty-first column in the seventh row of pillars, she closely
examined it, all superstitious fear and terror gone. She first
noticed that at about two feet and a half high a piece of mortar
had been picked away, and the stone scraped away some two inches
deep and three in the circumference of the pillar; and raising the
light she saw that the slab of stone above it was the same, and so
up as high as she could see, and as she saw this a new idea flashed
like lightning across her quick, ready mind. He had climbed up the
column by means of these and a piece of rope, as the Africans climb
the palm trees.</p>

<p>In one of the green-houses close to the chapel she remembered
seeing the gardener throw some rope, and to leave the vault, make
her way to the green-house, get the rope, and now fearlessly
return, was the work of a few minutes. She tied her lantern to her
waist, passed the rope round the column and herself, and made a
running noose, so that as she advanced she could slip the rope up
and support herself with it.</p>

<p>Agile, light, and strong, used by Angelo to sports girls are
rarely allowed to strengthen their limbs in, it was not very
difficult for Inez in this way to climb the column. Up, up, as long
as she found the mortar scraped away, up to the very roof, which
was arched. She could go no further, and firmly fixing herself in
her elevated perch, she raised the lantern, and examined the
capital of the column and the roof near. In the roof close by she
noticed that the mortar round one of the stones, which was a square
foot in size, was not so dirty or old-looking as the rest; and with
a hand that actually trembled, she fastened her lantern to the
rope, releasing her right hand, and drawing her knife, she began
scraping away the mortar that looked the least dirty. This stone,
be it understood, was close above the column, and therefore in that
part of the roof which was almost as upright as the pillar
itself.</p>

<p>This operation took nearly a quarter of an hour, and then she
gave the stone a rap. It gave back a hollow sound. Still calmly,
though she could almost hear her heart beating, she inserted the
chisel in the interstice where the mortar had been, and forced it
in, then pressed it back, and the stone fell to the ground with a
dull sullen noise.</p>

<p>Inez listened a moment, but all was again silent, and she lifted
the lantern&mdash;the stone had covered a cavity, and in the cavity
lay a mahogany box.</p>

<p>The box that held the jewelled casket&mdash;the box she knew so
well&mdash;it was in her hand, belted close to her, and she had
descended the column and fled through the cloisters, and up the
stone steps, before she clearly recollected anything. The fresh air
soon restored her to herself and to calmness. She closed down the
entrance, shut her lantern, and wrapping her mantle round her,
struck into the plantation, circling that way round to the back way
she had come out by. 2 o'clock struck as she glided noiselessly to
the room where she and Margaret slept. But Margaret was awake, and
she sprang to Inez, exclaiming in an eager whisper, "Oh, I am so
thankful you are back! But how haggard and deathly pale you look,
and your eyes burn like coals!"</p>

<p>"I have got them," said the Castilian, flinging back her
cloak.</p>

<p>"How?&mdash;where?&mdash;in what way?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"Hush! and listen," said Inez.</p>

<p>Margaret sat down and listened in silence to Inez's story. "And
now, Margaret," she added, "you must see them, and remember the day
I took them, for you will have to identify both one day."</p>

<p>She opened the box, and took out a beautiful jewel casket, the
lock of which, like the box, had been broken open. In the casket
were three trinkets, a bracelet, a large gold cross and chain, and
a necklace, all so marked and curious that Margaret understood how
the murderer had not dared to let any living being know he had
them.</p>

<p>The bracelet was one which had been in the Egerton family for
generations, and was of antique workmanship. The ring was of
massive gold, set round with diamonds so as to form the words,
"Faithful to the death," their motto. The large clasp, set in gold,
was a shield bearing the arms of the family, each quartering being
a large ruby; the supporters were made of diamonds, and the crest
over the shield (a sword and cross bound with cypress and palm) was
composed of pearls and emeralds.</p>

<p>The second was a gold chain and large jewelled gold
cross&mdash;a present of Angelo's to his mother. It opened at the
back; but instead of relics appeared his own hair, formed into the
motto of her house, "Love conquers all," and on it the "I.H.S." in
the same raven locks.</p>

<p>The third was a costly necklace of curious and antique Moorish
workmanship; and Inez said, "This has been in the Caldara family
for many generations, all, you see, are too marked for any one to
mistake them, and this bracelet has more even&mdash;there, you
see,&mdash;look on the clasp&mdash;the back."</p>

<p>Margaret did so, and read in old English characters the words,
"To ye Ladye Isabel, wife of Syr Walter de Egerton. From Philippa
ye Quene, 1337."</p>

<p>Inez took back the jewels, locked them up, and said, "To-morrow
these go to town, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah, then! little they guessed the dark deed that 'to-morrow'
would witness.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Again turn we to Margaret Arundel's memoirs:</p>

<p>It was early the next morning when I awoke. Inez de Caldara was
not in the room, and missing her hat and mantle, I guessed where
she had gone. She come back before Vivian, Eveline, or Stanfeld
were up. She only said, with a curious look of triumph in her calm
face, "I have sent Forde with the casket to Egerton. By the evening
he will be here."</p>

<p>That day passed in torture; every hour seemed ten. I longed for,
and yet dreaded that horrible evening, when Inez's long-suffering
patience would reap its fruits, and the murderer be seized. I don't
think I fully realised till that day all that child's proud,
chivalrously honorable nature had suffered and borne in the part
she had acted. I could see it in the deathly pallor of her face, in
the lines of suffering which now lightly crossed her brow, in the
worn, at times almost haggard look, that should never have been
known to one who scarcely yet numbered fifteen years.</p>

<p>So the hours dragged heavily on till dusk, and just at the
gloaming I missed both her and Arthur. I had been upstairs with
Eveline, and did not know how long they had been absent. I was
going to search for them, when, pausing at a staircase window, I
saw Vivian come from the chapel.</p>

<p>I turned so sick with apprehension that I was obliged to lean
against the wall for support. Why did he go to the cloisters that
day of all days? I was sure he had been there; but before I could
move he came up and demanded, "Where is Jesuita de Castro?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Arthur," I replied.</p>

<p>There was a look in his face that made me shiver and shrink back
as he passed me&mdash;that made my distrust and suspicion suddenly
rise before me in a fearfully defined shape&mdash;a terrible thing
of horror, and murder, and death; yes, murder was the awful word
that rang in my ears, that grew out of the silence of the old
house, that the very wind in its sighing whispered, that the tall
trees outside had in the ghostly rustic of their leaves&mdash;yes,
it was that horrible conviction that made me creep in shivering
dread to an east window which overlooked the river, and a short cut
to the bridge. I saw him, dusk though it was, walk across the
garden. I saw him hide something that flashed brightly in his
breast, and then stop and look at his hands, just as Lady Macbeth
did. There was murder in his face, there was murder in that action.
And then he pushed open the private gate, and I saw him turning
across the field and disappear in the wood. I stood for some
moments literally paralysed, till the one absorbing idea that I
must get help and follow him fell upon me. I caught up my hat, and
ran in search of the coachman, for Stanfeld had been absent all
day, and Forde, I knew was away. I couldn't find Miles anywhere,
but it was impossible for me to remain quiet after what had passed;
and though I generally feared that field and wood after dark, I now
dashed open the gate and set off running along the footpath.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>Turning again from the memoirs of Margaret Arundel, we retrace
our steps a little. Despite all Inez had gone through in the night,
it was barely 5 o'clock the next morning when she left her room
equipped for walking, and carrying a small heavy parcel, directed
to Egerton. The groom Forde she knew would be about, and stealing
out of the house, she made her way round to the stables, where,
sure enough, was Forde cleaning the brougham.</p>

<p>"Good morning, miss, you're early," was the cheerful
salutation.</p>

<p>"Forde," said the Spaniard, speaking very low, "is Miles up
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, miss," was the reply.</p>

<p>"That's well," said Inez. "I have come to ask you a great favor.
I want you to go to London for me on a message that will keep you
all day, but not a creature must know it. Can you be secret?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, miss, and ready to do your bidding," said Forde.</p>

<p>"You are doing me and others more service than you imagine,"
said Inez, "The message is of the last importance. Go first and put
on a plain dress&mdash;not your livery&mdash;be quick!"</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before Forde returned in his Sunday's
best.</p>

<p>"Come," said Inez, "we shall just catch the train by the short
cut. I will tell you what I want at the station."</p>

<p>They set off at a rapid pace across the field, and as they
entered the wood, she paused, and giving him the packet said, "Can
you read my writing there plainly? Is it plain?"</p>

<p>"Very, miss," he replied. "This is directed to Sir Angelo R.
Egerton, St. James' Square, London."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it," said Inez. "Take this packet straight to Sir
Angelo Egerton, and never let it leave your hands until you place
it in his. Remain till he opens it, for you will probably have to
wait and come down here with him by an evening train. Now let us
hurry on again. Here is my purse, and you will find in it all you
require."</p>

<p>It was five-and twenty minutes past five when they reached the
station. They were in time. The train came up, and only waiting to
see it off, Inez rapidly retraced her steps to the Grange
unseen.</p>

<p>In restless anxiety that was almost unendurable she passed the
day. Egerton could not, she knew, be down before evening; for he
would have to get a warrant from a magistrate for Vivian's arrest,
and then come with a detective officer. As soon as it began to grow
dusk, she took her hat and wandered out with the intention of going
to Forest New Bridge, and watching there till Angelo should come,
feeling sure that Forde would bring him that way. It was still
tolerably light when she reached the bridge, but little caring for
being out alone at that hour, she crossed over and went into the
station.</p>

<p>"When will the next train from London stop?" she said to the
clerk.</p>

<p>"In half-an-hour, ma'am," was the reply. "It's due at 8.35."</p>

<p>She turned back and slowly recrossed the bridge, pausing awhile
at the spot where Cassy had taken her mad leap; then she went down
on to the strand, and sat down under the shadow of the arch. All
around was very still and silent. The river rippled quietly at her
feet, the growing darkness crept stealthily over the sky, and the
shadow of the bridge grew deeper in the calm deep water, whilst the
lights of the village on the other side began to twinkle in the
distance. It was a very lonely spot, not a living being in sight or
hearing, but the thoughts of the watcher were too far away to
notice anything around her; it seemed such a long weary time since
she had seen Angelo or heard the low musical tones of his voice.
All that had passed since then seemed like a dark dream, the shadow
of which still hung over her, and she rose up to shake it off.</p>

<p>At that moment a step struck on the strand, a shadow indeed fell
across her, and Arthur Vivian stood before her.</p>

<p>For the first time Margaret's forebodings rushed across her, and
a deathly chill ran to the child's very heart as she found herself
alone in that lonely place with a desperate man. He had discovered
his loss, she could see that in the look of his livid black eyes,
in every line of his fiendishly beautiful face, as he confronted
her.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here at this hour?" he said, with an
intonation that made her shiver inwardly, though outwardly she
maintained her cool self-possession, knowing that if she lost that
she was a lost being. If she could keep him at bay for ten minutes
the train would arrive.</p>

<p>"I wandered out," she replied, "while it was light; the time has
passed quickly. This scene is really beautiful in this dim
gloaming."</p>

<p>He glanced for half a moment at the scene. If she could have
passed him, she would have sprung up the bank and fled across the
bridge, but she was under the arch, and he stood so that to pass
him was impossible without his detecting her motive. She stood
quiet, though she knew the hour had come which she had foreseen in
the words, "The instant the chaos assumes a clear form he will try
to murder me." She maintained her calmness and coolness, and yet
never had the love of life been so strong in her. She spoke
again.</p>

<p>"It will look better from the bridge; let us go up there and
see."</p>

<p>He turned upon her now. "No," he said; "stand where you are,
girl. Ha! the reckoning has come at last, and I am your master
now."</p>

<p>She knew now that all was over; she gave up all for lost; gave
up her life as doomed. She knew she was utterly in his power. If
she called out, or sprang into the river, a pistol bullet would end
all. She knew no mercy or fear for himself would check him, for it
was a toss up. If he let her escape, he was letting free the
evidence against him. He could not be worse off by her murder. He
was utterly desperate and would act desperately. But, with that
conviction, there came over her a feeling of fierce triumph and a
reckless determination to answer him in the words which rose
uppermost. At the same time a narrow chance of escape offered
itself. If she could, with taunting words, rouse him to mad passion
and throw him off his guard, she might try at least to match her
strength or agility against his; fling him, as he stood by the
brink, into the river, and thus gain a moment in which to fly.</p>

<p>A drowning person clings to a straw, and Inez de Caldara, in her
awful peril, with a desperate man to contend against, clung to this
straw.</p>

<p>"You my master!" she said, with that taunting sneer which no one
can so well assume as a woman. "You&mdash;I am yours. Even now you
fear me, as you have from that day you failed in frightening
me!"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Vivian, speaking hard and fiercely; "you have
stolen a box from the cloisters. Denial is useless. Silence, and
listen. I see all your game now&mdash;mad not to have seen it
before. You came to the Grange in treachery, false, base treachery,
with lies on your lips and in your heart, the very name you call
yourself is not your own, I believe; creeping like a snake to our
hearth, to betray it, ever base and false, a whited
sepulchre-innocence without, but iniquity within."</p>

<p>"No, but with a serpent's cunning," returned Inez, with a
mocking smile. "Now hear me, Arthur Vivian. I know you better than
you think. I did come to the Grange with a false name, with a false
story on my lips, with my very accent feigned, creeping, if you
will, like a snake to your hearth; but for an end which justified
the means. The time you saw me was not the first I saw you&mdash;I
saw you nine years ago. Murderer, I know you!" said the Spaniard,
confronting him with a face far more fearless than his own; and as
the last word passed her lips, she took one step forward, and, with
desperate resolution and force, struck him on the chest with her
closed hand.</p>

<p>So strong was the blow that Vivian staggered; but in that moment
he drew a long stiletto, and grasped her hand as she sprang forward
to fly. There was a flash&mdash;a gleam of descending
steel&mdash;and the Spaniard lay at his feet
motionless&mdash;weltering in her blood!</p>

<p>For one moment Vivian stood gazing on the lifeless form, and in
his lurid eyes there was mingled with it that fiendish triumph,
that strange look of agonised remorse that marked the Portrait.
Then the instinct of self-preservation came over him, and he sprang
into the river, and struck out for the other side.</p>

<p>The wind amidst the tall trees whispered sadly, and the weeping
willows dipped their leaves in the rippling waters of the river as
it flowed calmly onwards, and the watchful eyes of the night saw
the deed that was done, and the evening star seemed to fall with a
more mournful light on the face of the child as if a tear had
dimmed its brilliancy.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At thirty-five minutes past 8 the down train stopped at Forest
Moor station. Only three passengers got out&mdash;a tall, dark man,
with an immense bloodhound, a man servant, and an almost
gentlemanly looking man, dressed in black. In the two first we
recognise Egerton and Leon; in the second, Dick Forde; and in the
third, we introduce Mr. Robert Harding, detective officer, who now
bore in his pocket a warrant for the arrest of Arthur Vivian, on a
charge of murder.</p>

<p>Forde led the way by the bridge; but when Leon came to the spot
where Inez had stood, he suddenly ran wildly round, and then, with
a loud baying, dashed forwards, with his nose to the the ground. At
the little foot-track which led to the river bank he paused; but
the moment the rest came up he crept under the rail, ran down, and
vanished under the arch of the bridge. In a moment Egerton was over
the rail, and on the strand. There, almost at his feet, lay the
lifeless form of Inez, the blood trickling from a wound in her
breast, in which the stiletto still quivered.</p>

<p>A cry of horror burst from Forde and the detective, but no word
passed Angelo's lips; the blow had gone too deep for words, anguish
had gone too straight to the heart, and numbed it with agony. He
raised the motionless form in his arms, but only the keen eye of
the detective saw the livid, compressed lips, and the speaking
anguish in the dark eyes.</p>

<p>At that moment Margaret appeared, breathless, to see her worst
fears realised, and with a wild cry she sprang forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez! oh, Inez! this is Vivian's work."</p>

<p>"Silence! She is dead," said Angelo, sternly; "and if you are
Margaret Arundel, follow me."</p>

<p>It was all he said. He staunched the flowing blood with his
handkerchief, and wrapping her mantle about her, rapidly retraced
his steps over the bridge.</p>

<p>"Sir, take her to Warren, the greengrocer, by the station," said
Forde, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Show the way," said Egerton.</p>

<p>Forde obeyed, and a few moments brought them to Warren's neat
shop.</p>

<p>"Fetch a surgeon, Forde," said Harding, passing before Angelo,
and opening the shop door.</p>

<p>Inside was Mrs. Warren, but at the entrance of the stranger she
started forward, exclaiming, "Who is this? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"A lady who is dying, if not dead," said the detective, shortly.
"Your house was the nearest."</p>

<p>"Bring her in here, sir. Merciful heaven!" exclaimed Mrs.
Warren, as the light flashed on the face lying on Angelo's breast,
"it is the young foreign lady from the Grange, and Miss Arundel,
too! Bring her in here, sir," she said, opening a door from the
parlor which led into a small bedroom, and here Egerton laid down
his precious burden.</p>

<p>"Will the surgeon never come?" he said.</p>

<p>"He is here, sir," said a quiet voice, and a grave gentlemanly
man entered. "Let me see the lady."</p>

<p>Angelo drew back, and the doctor laid his hand on Inez's
chest.</p>

<p>"I can relieve you of immediate fear, sir," he said. "Her heart
beats, though feebly."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" murmured Egerton, covering his face a moment in
almost uncontrollable emotion; and then, without a word, he left
the room, resigning her to the surgeon and the women.</p>

<p>In the parlor without were the groom, Sam Warren, and the
detective, and the latter immediately said, "Sir Angelo, here is
the weapon with which the young lady was stabbed. You see it's a
weapon rarely found in the hands of an Englishman. It is an Italian
stiletto, with the mark of a maker at Pistoia on it, you see."</p>

<p>Egerton started. His mother had been first stabbed with a
stiletto&mdash;so the physician had judged from the wound&mdash;and
then had been shot.</p>

<p>"I lingered to examine the bank, too," continued the detective.
"There was a pool of blood where the young lady had fallen, and
footprints going to the water. The murderer has swum the river, and
escaped for the present; but I shall track him and find him."</p>

<p>"Spare no expense in the pursuit," said Egerton. "Cost what it
may, that man shall be taken."</p>

<p>Harding bowed, and soon after the surgeon and Mrs. Warren
entered.</p>

<p>"I will not confuse you with scientific terms, sir," said the
doctor, addressing Egerton, "but simply tell you that the very
fineness of the weapon has saved your charge; for it has passed
between the vital parts without injuring them, and she was
insensible from loss of blood, which has been great. The wound is
dressed, and in a few weeks will have healed. She is much weakened,
and must not be moved until I permit it, but she has recovered
consciousness and asked for you."</p>

<p>The first word indeed that Inez had faintly uttered had been the
name of Angelo, and then Margaret whispered that he had found her,
and should come, and stole out after the other two.</p>

<p>The next moment Angelo, the worshipped being for whom she had
nearly lost her life, stood by the bedside, and had clasped her
with bitter, passionate remorse to his breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez, my own little one," said Egerton, "how could I have
been so mad as to place you in that man's power?"</p>

<p>She nestled clingingly to him, as she had used to when a little
child, and whispered in faint, low accents, "Hush! oh, hush,
Angelo. I can bear anything but to see you sorrow for me. And now I
am with you again."</p>

<p>"Never more to leave me," said Angelo; "never more to leave me,
my darling, my own Inez."</p>

<p>"I have won," she said; "but oh, Angelo, it has been such a long
dark dream, such a fearful time. I was so weary and worn out. I'm
not so now."</p>

<p>"As he gently laid her back, and tenderly kissed her, there was
an expression of perfect peace and rest on the soft beautiful young
face that it had not known for a long, long time. She spoke again,
but so low that he bent over her to catch her words.</p>

<p>"Angelo," she said, "we must take care of Margaret now. She can
never return to the Grange."</p>

<p>"Trust all to me, dearest," he replied. "At present she will
stay and nurse you. Try and sleep, little one."</p>

<p>He re-entered the outer room, and the detective, after
whispering something to Egerton, went away, and the doctor, leaving
some directions for the patient's treatment, followed, promising to
come in early next day.</p>

<p>Angelo then drew Margaret aside, and after talking some time
with her in a low tone, she sat down, wrote a letter to Stanfeld,
and gave it him to read.</p>

<p>"It will do," he said. "Now, Forde, take this over to Forest
Moor, and await an answer, part of which will be to turn you away
directly, but you know my promise."</p>

<p>Forde touched his hat and went out, and Egerton made his
arrangements with Sam Warren and his wife for the accommodation of
Margaret and Inez, he himself taking up his quarters at the inn
until his 'darter,' as the good dame called Inez, was well enough
to be removed to town.</p>

<p>When Forde returned, it was with a fierce message from Stanfeld,
"that he was glad to get rid of Margaret Arundel for ever. Jesuita
de Castro and her guardian might take her to South America if they
chose."</p>

<p>All that Margaret (by Egerton's wish) had written, was that
Vivian had for some reason tried to murder Jesuita de Castro; that
her guardian had accidentally rescued her; that he had fled, and
that she, Margaret, did not intend to return again to the
Grange.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>While Inez de Caldera lay in the humble home of Sam Warren,
where was her assassin?&mdash;for in intention he was so, and
believed himself so. He was sitting in the very same old country
house, where long before Inez and Colonel St. John had taken
shelter, and on the other side of the fireplace sat Roland Aubrey.
He was speaking, but there was a dark shade on his face, and a
curious flicker in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You have got yourself into a regular scrape now, Vivian," said
Aubrey. "How came you to be such a fool?"</p>

<p>"She had got a secret of mine," said Arthur, without moving. "It
was a gloomy, lonely place, and she taunted me as she only could
taunt. Curses on her dark face! She maddened me&mdash;she struck
me, and I stabbed her."</p>

<p>"And left your knife sticking in her," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"A malediction on it!" exclaimed Vivian. "It was not an ordinary
knife, but an Italian stiletto."</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Aubrey, "such a marked thing. What and who was
she?"</p>

<p>"She was an olive-skinned Spaniard," replied Vivian, "false as
proud. She called herself Jesuita de Castro."</p>

<p>"What was she like?" asked Aubrey.</p>

<p>"She was tall and slight," said Vivian, "with horrid queer black
eyes that looked through you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" interrupted Roland, starting. "Weird looking eyes, and a
quiet grave brow&mdash;isn't that she?"</p>

<p>"Where did you see her?" exclaimed Vivian. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I think I know," said Aubrey. "She is the ward of Egerton, the
member for Cambridge University. Of course you know who he is, and
her real name is Inez de Caldara."</p>

<p>Vivian started violently at the name of Egerton, but he only
said, "How do you know that?"</p>

<p>In reply Roland told him of Inez and St. John having taken
shelter there, concluding with "Your description of her eyes,
coupled with her being Spanish, struck me. She was very beautiful.
Oh, Arthur, Arthur! how could you stab a mere girl, even in the
heat of passion? I knew that you were bad, that you have been and
are dissipated; that you live almost by gambling&mdash;that you
have fierce passions; but I never thought that even you would let
the devil in you make your hand red with blood."</p>

<p>"You speak plainly," said Vivian, with a fierce gesture and an
oath. "Are you going to shelter me or betray me?"</p>

<p>"When you fled here this morning, and threw yourself on the
honor of me, your old companion and ally, I promised to shelter
you," said Aubrey. "I abide by that; but you must fly to-night; for
you cannot tell but that to-morrow morning the gentlemen in blue
may be on your track, and your description out at every seaport and
police station."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Vivian. "No one will know who did
it."</p>

<p>"You forget the stiletto," said Aubrey, "that will cry aloud.
No, you must take a couple of hours' rest, and then we'll set off
for the coast."</p>

<p>Rest, talk of rest to him who could not keep quiet even now. No,
he glanced restlessly and uneasily about; he started if a door
shut, or a rat or mouse ran behind the wainscoating. If he turned
towards the wall, there he saw Inez's watchful eyes looking at him
out of the gloom, as they used to do in life; he saw her dark face
on the shadow of the curtains, and heard her light footstep in
every falling leaf, or creaking of the old furniture; turn where he
would he saw her weird face. If he closed his eyes he saw the
murdered form lying on the strand, crimson with blood, the calm
dead face upturned, as it had looked when he left it lying there!
Moving or still, sleeping or waking, to his guilty eyes and ears
there was murder in everything. The mournful moaning of the wind
whispered murder; the rustling leaves of the tall trees had it in
their sighing; the very falling of the summer rain outside had a
voice that muttered it. He could not bear it, he could not sleep or
rest a moment, and he sprang from the couch on which he had thrown
himself dressed. He had told Aubrey a false tale; he had said that
he accidentally met Inez by the river; that she had told him that
she knew a secret of his, and would use it; that she had taunted
and goaded him to madness; and that, in the wild heat of passion,
hardly knowing what he did, he had struck her with the weapon which
an evil fate had chanced to make him have on him. That was his
story. That night he fled, and in safety reached a foreign shore;
and for a time his pursuers were baffled.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p>IT was late in the autumn when Egerton took Inez from Forest
Moor to town for a few days, during which he could make such
arrangement with his child as would enable him to take her for a
month to the seaside. Margaret Arundel came with them as their
guest; and now behold the three in the drawing-room, Leon lying, as
of old, on the rug before the fire. It yet wanted some time to the
hour of retiring, and Egerton was reading over a short bill which
he was to bring into Parliament next year. Margaret was working at
some embroidery, and Inez sat on a low seat near Angelo, with
Bulwer's 'Last of the Barons' on her lap, but her dark eyes fixed
dreamily on the page, saw no word, or at least the mental vision
took in nothing of what the physical eye read. Margaret had been
right; the young face did look more worn and wan; there were lines
of care, and pain, and suffering drawn across the
brow&mdash;lightly, but still there, where they should not have
been, and the pale soft olive of the thin checks was perfectly
colorless. She looked like a person who had suffered much, mentally
and physically, and in truth all she had gone through had shaken
even her more than she knew, and bitterly did Egerton reproach
himself that he had let her go, when he remembered the danger, and
how nearly he had lost his darling; but how could he refuse her
when she had clung to him, and with passionate eloquence appealed
to his love for Julian? All these thoughts were passing through his
mind now instead of the schedules of the bill, and suddenly
throwing it aside, he said, "We seem as far off as ever from the
end. Vivian has escaped."</p>

<p>"But isn't that detective clever?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Egerton; "but so is Vivian clever, and he may
permanently escape."</p>

<p>"No," said Inez, with a vehemence unusual in her; "it may be
months, it may be years before he is taken; but it will come at
last, as surely as there is justice in heaven."</p>

<p>"I must, I will believe it, child," said Egerton, softly
smoothing her silky black hair. "Justice must be done."</p>

<p>"Inez," said Margaret, "what do you think made Arthur go to the
vault that evening of all others?"</p>

<p>"Because, probably, he was in the habit of going at intervals to
see if the casket was safe," replied Inez; "or more likely some
fine instinct or presentiment of coming danger made him go there,
and the instant he found it gone he would at once connect its loss
with me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret, "but what made him take the short cut? In
fact, what made him think you had gone, and gone that way?"</p>

<p>"The first day I rode with him I asked about that path," replied
Inez.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Arundel," said Egerton, smiling, "you appear to
expect Inez to know every idea and motive of this man."</p>

<p>"So she did, sir, know every turn and thought of his mind. She
watched him and studied him systematically. She has a turn that
way, I think."</p>

<p>A slight shudder passed over Inez's frame, and perhaps to turn
the conversation, she said, "The Rochesters are out of town, of
course, Angelo?"</p>

<p>"All of them," he replied. "I had a letter this morning from
Marion. They are gone to Scarborough with the St. Johns, Lady Alice
and Arabella included."</p>

<p>"But, Angelo, I thought Cuthbert was at Yellowfield," said
Inez.</p>

<p>"He was," replied Angelo; "but he got himself in a row there by
attempting the confessional. He nearly got mobbed in the
marketplace, and so was obliged to leave, and his friend Courtenay
is trying to get him installed somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Courtenay a Puseyite, then?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"No," replied Egerton, "he doesn't care one way or the other
much; but they are friends of long standing, despite their
different years. And there is much in old ties."</p>

<p>"Who knows that so well as me?" murmured the Castilian.</p>

<p>"We will have them all at Falcontower this Christmas,
Inez&mdash;all," said Egerton, and she knew he meant Julian.</p>

<p>After a pause Egerton suddenly rose, and leaning against the
mantel-piece, said, "Miss Arundel, as I shall be engaged to-morrow,
I must speak what I have to speak to-night, and pardon me if I
speak plainly. What are your plans for your future life?"</p>

<p>"The same as they ever were, sir, and as they were even at
school&mdash;to leave Stanfeld and go out us a governess. I still
intend to do so."</p>

<p>Angelo and the Castilian exchanged a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"I am twenty years your senior," said Egerton, "almost old
enough to be your father. You have done an incalculable service to
me through Inez, and in consequence have been thrown afterwards
utterly friendless on my care, at seventeen, too young to struggle
with a hard world; and in right of these three things I claimed
some right to control you and your actions. Before I say any more I
will ask you a simple question. Who do you think would take a girl
of sixteen or seventeen as governess? This child of mine would
stand an almost better chance. Moreover, you are far too pretty for
any lady who has grown up sons and daughters to take; you are too
sensible, I know, to misconstrue or take offence at my words.
Finally, as far as I have any power to influence you and any right
to control you, I put my positive and unqualified vote upon your
plan. Instead I offer you two courses. You can, if you please,
return to Stanfeld's, or to your old governess, Mrs. Ashton, and I
will make you independent in either case; save you from any
mortification or privation, by a yearly allowance, sufficient for
your personal wants."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Margaret, "will you tell me the other course?"</p>

<p>"I will. You have decided as I know you would," said Egerton,
with a pleased smile. "The other course is to remain with us as
Inez's companion. Do not be afraid I am making the situation for
you, and so fret yourself. I had before intended to engage you for
her. She needs a companion of your age, and who so fitting a one as
the friend who has won her love and gratitude? You will earn your
right to be here&mdash;you have earned it already by what you have
done for us; and tell her, Inez," he added, smiling, "that two
hundred a year is not more than she will want, living as we do.
Margaret, I await your answer."</p>

<p>Margaret burst into tears and hid her face on Inez's breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez," she said, "it is too kind! I don't want anything
better than to stay always with you."</p>

<p>"It is done," said Egerton; "she has chosen her course. Good
night, Margaret, you have chosen as I knew you
would&mdash;independence."</p>

<p>He held her hand for a moment in his, then tenderly kissed
Inez's brow, and the two girls left the room together.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>And where all these months had been the fair golden haired Isbel
Rochester?&mdash;sunning herself through the gay summer with bright
enjoyment of a heart that had as yet known but little of the
reality of life. They were now at Scarborough with the St. John's
for the autumn.</p>

<p>It was morning, so early before breakfast that as yet the beach
was almost deserted, when Tom Courtenay and his young cousin
sauntered slowly along the sands.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Isbel, "that Inez de Caldara was with us, I have
not seen her since we left school."</p>

<p>"She hasn't been at home; I rather think she has been staying
with some friends," said Tom. "Do you know where you are going to
spend the Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Who, momma and I?" she asked. "I don't know; perhaps at Cousin
William Courtenay's."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Tom; "for when I saw Egerton in town some
time ago, he said something about having us all at
Falcontower."</p>

<p>"Did he! Oh, how capital!" exclaimed Isbel. "I hope he will ask
us to that beautiful old place; only I hope"&mdash;and she lowered
her voice&mdash;"that the Reverend Cuthbert will not be there."</p>

<p>Tom fairly burst out laughing at this very confidential whisper.
"Why not, child?" said he. "What is your intense dislike to our
Puseyite article? I'm sure we have many a laugh over him."</p>

<p>"Yes. Really, Tom, we are too bad; we tease him dreadfully."</p>

<p>"I've been searching for you, daughter mine," said Marion,
coming up with a letter in her hand. "The post has just come in,
and there is a letter from Angelo Egerton. He and Inez are at the
sea side with Miss Arundel, who was at Ashton School."</p>

<p>"What, Margaret Arundel?" exclaimed Isbel.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Marion. "She has left her uncle, and was going
out as a governess, but Angelo took her as a companion to Inez. But
that is not what I wanted to tell you. He asks us all to
Falcontower for Christmas&mdash;us and the St. Johns, and how many
more I don't know; but he writes that his ward&mdash;that young
Surrey&mdash;is coming over in November."</p>

<p>She did not tell them that he had written that which was new
life to the heart which ached and yearned for her son, and yet to
any stranger his words contained little enough:&mdash;"The result,
dear Marion, of Inez's visit to Forest Moor makes it more safe for
Julian to venture here. He is therefore coming in November, and
will remain quietly at Falcontower till we all go down at
Christmas."</p>

<p>"How nice it will be," said Isbel, "but, mamma dear, is our
Puseyite friend asked too?"</p>

<p>"You naughty girl!" replied Marion, "I know what that means.
Yes, he is going. Angelo couldn't ask his brother and mother very
well without asking him."</p>

<p>Isbel and Tom exchanged such a look that Marion instantly said,
"You two are hatching some mischief between you. Now, just come
into breakfast, and let Mr. St. John alone."</p>

<p>"I hope there will be a good lot of people," said Isbel. "I
wonder how Inez will play hostess; she is only fifteen."</p>

<p>"In actual years," muttered Marion, with a heavy sigh; "older by
far in bitter experience. I wonder what she is doing at this
moment."</p>

<p>At that moment, though Marion know it not, the Castilian was
standing on the beach on the south coast, leaning on the arm of the
stately Angelo Egerton; and now she, who when alone had stood so
firm and steady in a position of danger and trouble, leaned
clingingly on the strong man, instinctively, with woman's devotion,
resting on and trusting implicitly in the strength and protection
of one whom she felt to be her superior physically and mentally,
and whom her deep love idolised and deified into a being utmost to
be worshipped.</p>

<p>"Where are your thoughts, Angelo?" she said, softly&mdash;"far
away, over the wide seas?"</p>

<p>His glance came back to her, and rested tenderly on the young
face.</p>

<p>"No, Inez, nearer home. My thoughts were of you. Ah! little one,
if ever I should lose you, life would be very dark&mdash;very, very
dark!"</p>

<p>She clasped her right hand on the one which rested on his arm,
and that simple action spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"I wish Julian were with us now," she said, after a long
silence.</p>

<p>"He will land at Dover in November," replied Egerton; "and you
and I will go and meet him, and take him in safety to
Falcontower."</p>

<p>"But, Angelo," she said, "will not Tom know him again."</p>

<p>"No," replied Egerton, "he has been dead to him nine years.
Remember also how changed Julian is from the youth Tom knew; and
even if any faint resemblance crosses him, it will never strike him
that Rothesay the painter and Julian D'Arcy are the same. But come,
now, we had better return, for Margaret will be up by this time,
and waiting for us."</p>

<p>They moved slowly away, loathe even then to leave the sea.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p>Eveline Vivian for many days knew nothing but what her father
chose to tell her, and that was wide of the truth. He told her that
Jesuita and Margaret had run away, and that Arthur had gone on
sudden business to London. She did not believe him, but she dared
not say so; and then she heard rumors of the murder of Miss de
Castro, and her discovery by a gentleman who called himself her
guardian, but whose name was unknown in the village, and both she
and Stanfeld not unnaturally imagined him to be the same gentleman
who had brought Jesuita to the station. But somehow or other
Eveline's mind instantly connected the attempted murder with her
husband. She struggled against it, but in vain; and she grew
nervous and fearful. Why didn't Arthur write? If he was in danger
she would go to him, though he had so rudely crushed her love.
"Where was he?" she asked her father, but he knew no more than she
did now.</p>

<p>"Where, then, was Margaret?&mdash;she could write to her."</p>

<p>He answered her angrily, "He didn't know or care where she was,
and she could know nothing of it."</p>

<p>And so, in restless anxiety and miserable uncertainty, a month
passed by. She could gather nothing in the village, or even at Mrs.
Warren's; she could only tell her that the young foreign lady and
Miss Arundel had been ten days at her house, and then the gentleman
had taken them both away. She didn't know his name, but he was a
tall dark gentleman, with very black hair and mustaches, and very
like the young lady. She knew nothing of who had stabbed her, the
young lady would not say, but she (Mrs. Warren) thought that a
detective was searching for him. No one in the village had even a
suspicion as to who the murderer might be.</p>

<p>It was one night about six weeks after the attempted murder that
poor Eveline sat by her chamber window. Her lamp was on the table,
but she did not undress; she had seated herself there, listening
half unconsciously to the autumn night wind, which rustled the
leaves of the vine which climbed up the trellis outside, with her
thoughts and heart far away, poor thing, with the man who so little
deserved her. Twelve o'clock had just struck, when a small stone
was thrown up against the glass. Strangely the idea instantly
crossed her that it was her husband, and, gently opening the
window, she leant out.</p>

<p>"Arthur&mdash;husband!" she said, softly.</p>

<p>"Hush! open the window, Evie, wide; I am coming up."</p>

<p>She saw a figure below climb easily up the trellis, and the next
moment Arthur Vivian stood in the room. He walked to the door and
locked it, then put-to the shutters, while she stood watching him
with parted lips and clasped hands, and something of almost terror
in her aspect.</p>

<p>"What are you looking so frightened at?" demanded Vivian,
roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur!" said his wife, "why do you come here this way,
stealing in as if you feared the day."</p>

<p>"I do fear the day&mdash;I am hunted like a felon!" said Arthur,
fiercely. "I come here to you because your evidence against me
isn't legal, and because you are fool enough to care for me
still."</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, Arthur! how can you?" she cried, with bitter grief.
"Are you not content with breaking my heart, and must you crush it
under your heel?"</p>

<p>There was such anguish in her tone as for a moment touched even
him, and his face softened with something of remorse as he said,
"Can you love me still&mdash;even now?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do!" she cried. "Oh, Arthur, let me lay my head on
your breast, and feel once more that I am the wife you used to
love!"</p>

<p>"Eveline!" he said, keeping her back with his hand, "would you
rest your head on the breast of a murderer&mdash;touch the hand
that is red with blood? My hand is red with the blood of Jesuita de
Castro."</p>

<p>"It is not!" she said, vehemently, "It is stainless. Jesuita de
Castro lives still."</p>

<p>Arthur lifted his hands suddenly upward, and cried, "Oh,
God!&mdash;if there is a God&mdash;am I to be thankful or not?"</p>

<p>His wife stood in horror-struck surprise. "Arthur," said she,
"can you doubt which to be?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do doubt," he replied. "If there is a God, I call down
his heaviest curses on the head of that false Spaniard! Don't touch
me, Eveline; for though I never loved you, you are my wife, and my
hand is not as stainless as yours."</p>

<p>"I will touch you, stainless or not. You are my husband," she
said, throwing her arms round him; "let me be with you&mdash;let me
share your danger and flight."</p>

<p>"And get me taken. No," said Vivian, flinging her off. "I came
here to get some of my property, not to cumber myself with a wife.
I am going away; but whenever I want money I shall come to you. And
now listen, and say if you want to go with me. I was a murderer
when I married you! I stabbed that Spaniard because she knows
it."</p>

<p>Eveline cowered on the floor, but still tried to clasp his hand.
With a fierce oath he flung her back, and she sank senseless on the
ground.</p>

<p>When she recovered, she was alone, lying on the bed; and turning
her face to the wall, the poor thing wept as if she would weep out
her broken heart there; and then she lay still and quiet from the
very exhaustion of grief.</p>

<p>The wife of a murderer! The word rang in in her ears like a
knell&mdash;the very silence of night rang with it&mdash;and then
all her broken love rushed back on her heart, and died there. If he
had uttered one kind word, or given her one kind look, she would
still have clung to him, notwithstanding the wreck he had made her
love; but he had not done so. He had trampled on her in every way,
he had spurned her, crushed her, flung her away, and avowed, with a
sort of fierce, taunting cruelty, that he had wedded her with a red
hand; and it was more than even woman's love could bear, and her
love died though it broke her heart in doing so. She was startled
by a knocking at the door, and a harsh voice crying,
"Open&mdash;open the door, Eveline."</p>

<p>Trembling every limb, the poor girl arose, and, opening the
door, faced her father.</p>

<p>"I heard a man's voice here," he said roughly. "Don't lie, girl.
Who was it? Who was it, I say?"</p>

<p>She dared not refuse to say, yet she feared to betray her
husband by replying; but he grasped her arm, and with an oath bade
her answer.</p>

<p>"It was Arthur!" she faltered; "only Arthur."</p>

<p>"Ha! the villain, was it!" exclaimed Stanfeld. "I have him at
last."</p>

<p>He was springing away, but she flung her arms round him, and
detained him, "Father, father!" she cried; "you shall not leave
here to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was a passionate, vindictive man; and flinging off her arms
with a fiercely passionate oath, he struck her,&mdash;yes, struck
his own daughter, the child of the dead wife whose heart he had
broken.</p>

<p>"Oh, father! oh, father!" So she moaned, and wrung her hands
when he was gone. So she moaned in her despair and misery for many
a long hour; but when the morning came she was gone, and there was
only the following letter, which the servant gave to
Stanfeld:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"The last tie is broken between you and me. You
have always been harsh, always held me an incumbrance; and now that
my husband has left me, the only link that bound me to Forest Moor
is gone, and your own hand has snapped the last link that bound me
to you. If ever we meet again, it must be your seeking, not that
of<br>
<br>
EVELINE VIVIAN."</p>

<p>There were tear stains on this letter, but not a line to give a
trace of her; probably she had followed her recreant husband.
Dashing down the letter, Stanfeld put his foot on it, exclaiming,
"Let her go! I hated her mother, and I hate her and her sister! All
are well rid of&mdash;all are dead to me for ever!"</p>

<p>And the echo of the old deserted room answered back "for ever!"
as if it saw beyond them the grave and uttered the words of
prophecy.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the neat comfortable little parlor at the back of his shop
sat John Everard, looking hardly altered from what he had been five
years ago, save that his hair might have thinned a little, and
perhaps he had some need now of the gold spectacles; but in
appearance he was the same as ever&mdash;kind, hearty, and
warm-hearted. And yet he had had sorrows&mdash;who has not? He had,
early in life, lost his wife; and his daughter, round whom every
fibre of his heart had twined, had, as we have seen, left him and
fled&mdash;with a man he knew to be a villain. That was nearly
four-and-twenty years ago, and since then he had been alone; he had
never seen her again, and though he knew she had had a daughter (of
Theresa's birth he knew nothing), he had never seen the child, and
knew not even if she was alive until about seven years before, when
he had seen the announcement of her marriage with Arthur Vivian
Esq., in the papers, and it was then he made a will, so tying up to
her and hers his property.</p>

<p>Somehow or other his thoughts were even now going back to the
memory of other days when little feet had pattered about the old
London house, and a child's little face had peered above the
counter, and the old man's heart ached for the child he had lost,
and warmly indeed would he have welcomed that child's unknown
daughter. So he sat in that old dark panelled room, thinking, when
his foreman opened the door and came in contrary to his usual
custom; for though he had been there thirty years, he rarely
entered his master's private room without knocking. But now he did,
and said in a whisper, "Mr. Everard, there's a lady asking for you;
and, lawks, sir, just to see her! So like Miss Evie, that it might
be just her come home again."</p>

<p>The old man took off his spectacles, and rose, trembling and
holding by his chair. "Ask her," said he&mdash;"ask her her
name."</p>

<p>The foreman went back, and then the old gunsmith heard a voice
that thrilled through him, say, "Mrs. Arthur Vivian," and the name
of Eveline burst from his lips. She heard it, and the next minute
she was kneeling at the old man's feet. "Grandfather, grandfather!"
she cried.</p>

<p>So like&mdash;oh, so like the child he had loved and lost that
the long years vanished, and he saw only in the kneeling form his
daughter coming to him again for the love and shelter she had found
nowhere else; and clasping his trembling arms about her, he let her
weep her very heart out on his breast, while his own tears fell
thick and fast on the poor weary head that at last found rest.</p>

<p>"My daughter&mdash;my Evie!" said he. "Come at last&mdash;home
at last!"</p>

<p>She lifted her face, then seeing what he thought, she said
touchingly, "Not she&mdash;her child! Oh, grandfather, love me a
little for my dead mother's sake, for I am fatherless, and worse
than widowed."</p>

<p>And the old man, as he held her to his heart, and heard her sad
tale, felt that he had recovered more than his lost daughter; and
that in her stricken child she lived again, refined, purified by
the heavy hand of sorrow and suffering. Perhaps heaven, in its
mercy and goodness, had so chastened her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p>The long vacation&mdash;and a very long one it is&mdash;came to
an end at last; the Lord Chancellor opened the courts again; and
Parliament met to be prorogued till February; and business men
again returned to London.</p>

<p>Julian had written that he and Surrey would land at Dover on the
10th of November by the earliest boat from Calais; and therefore,
the night before, Egerton and Inez went down to Dover, so that they
were ready to meet the boat. There, sure enough, were the two
travellers; and as they stepped ashore, they were met by Sir Angelo
and Inez. No one, to see them meet, and bravely shake hands, would
have guessed the deep emotion in the heart of each; for none could
see the iron strength of that apparently cold clasp. Julian could
not, if he would, have spoken; for the crowd of memories that
welled up in the heart of the exile, as he once more stood on
English soil, was too much for speech; but it was not till they
reached the hotel, and were alone&mdash;for Inez and Walter
purposely left them&mdash;not till Angelo grasped both his hands
and in his native tongue bade him welcome to home and old England,
that the long controlled emotions of the exile's heart gave way;
and the strong man bowed his head and wept like a child.</p>

<p>But both were calm when Walter and Inez de Caldara returned, and
only her tender woman's eye, with the quickness of deep affection,
detected traces of emotion which did manhood no shame.</p>

<p>"Have you brought home everything," she said, as she too bade
him welcome, "so that you will never go away again?"</p>

<p>"Everything, dear Inez, pictures included," he replied.</p>

<p>"And," said Egerton, "I will leave Inez to take care of you
while Walter and I go and see about getting your property through
the Custom-house. It will take two or three days; but I'll leave
Burns to see to it, for we must reach Falcontower to-night."</p>

<p>That evening the ancient gates of Falcontower Castle rolled back
to receive the exile to the home of his childhood.</p>

<p>For one day only Egerton and his ward remained, and on the
following morning they left the north, and returned to London.</p>

<p>In the meantime the case of Egerton v. Stanfeld came on to be
heard. The court was pretty well filled; and as the evidence was
principally to be taken in person, Walter and Egerton were there
with their solicitor, Mr. Seymour, and Stephen Stanfeld came in
with his attorney, a certain Mr. George Verney. The defence made
was that Walter Surrey was not the son of Colonel Surrey; it being
asserted by Stanfeld, and he held to it, that he had information of
the said colonel's death without children. But such a defence had
not a leg to stand upon. It was proved that Colonel Surrey had a
son; and the letter was produced, written to Miss Norman after his
engagement, telling her who and what he was. The certificate of his
marriage with Gertrude Norman was produced, with the certificate of
their child's birth, and a certified copy of the register of the
colonel's death, which had occurred at Calcutta.</p>

<p>Not to weary with details&mdash;the evidence was so clear for
the plaintiff that the Vice-chancellor decided against the
defendant, and made the order removing him from the trust, with
some very strong remarks on his conduct. Stephen Stanfeld left the
court a ruined man, and if it had taken place a few years later, he
would have been sent across the seas under the Fraudulent Trustees
Act. As it was, he was of course utterly unable to refund the
immense sum he was liable for, and he was obliged to pass through
the Insolvent Court; while Egerton took possession of Forest Moor
for his ward, intending in the spring to have the whole estate
thoroughly looked after, from the Grange to the laborer's
cottage.</p>

<p>Willingly would Theresa have gone to her father; but he wrote to
her, commanding her to keep away. He was henceforth dead to her and
Eveline, who he said had "gone abroad with Arthur&mdash;curse
them!" And this was not contradicted, for Eveline said to her
grandfather, "She is happy where she is. Better without such a
sister as I am&mdash;better that the murderer's wife should be dead
to her. She could not be happy with you or me."</p>

<p>And so Theresa was left standing alone. Yes, alone; her home,
such as it was, gone, crumbled away into dust, as a skeleton, long
enclosed, does when exposed to light and air. She learned&mdash;and
learned through the public papers&mdash;that her father was a
swindler, an insolvent, a ruined man alike in name and estate; and
then came his letter ignoring her from that day, her and her
sister; "they were best without him, as he was without them." The
letter concluded:</p>

<p class="letter">"I hated your mother, and I never loved her
children. For you&mdash;you chose your own course, and must abide
by it. For Eveline&mdash;she fled one night that Arthur came, and
where she is I neither know nor care. She may have gone after
him&mdash;it is most likely. Forest Moor is wrested from me; you
and Eveline have seen me for the last time&mdash;you now hear from
me for the last time; henceforth to you I am dead. This is the last
from,<br>
<br>
"STEPHEN STANFELD."</p>

<p>With a perfectly white face, the friendless girl went straight
to Lady Alice St. John, showed her the letter, and told her her
whole story, with hard, dry eyes, and hard, unchanging manner.
Alice St. John saw into the child's heart as plainly as if it had
been an open book, and she held out her arms.</p>

<p>"My poor child," she said; "oh, my poor child."</p>

<p>Theresa knelt at Alice's feet&mdash;laid her head on her lap,
and wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>So for a few moments Alice let her weep, and then the sweet
pitying face bent over the homeless girl, and a soft pitying kiss
fell on her brow.</p>

<p>"My darling," said Lady Alice, "look up. My dear child, you know
that neither I nor mine will value you the less for this."</p>

<p>Theresa rose calm now, and taking the letter, tore it in half
and flung it in the fire.</p>

<p>"So I wipe out all ties that once bound me to him," she cried.
"So I sweep away all memory of a home that never was a home, and a
father who never was a father, whose very name shall be mine no
more. Call me henceforth Theresa Herbert."</p>

<p>"My child," said Lady Alice, "would you destroy the memory of
your sister?"</p>

<p>"No, oh no," she replied; "but I do not think she has gone after
or with her husband. She has more likely fled to our Grandfather,
Mr. Everard, the gunsmith."</p>

<p>"If so, would she not have written to you?" asked Lady
Alice.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I can't tell," said Theresa. "Arthur Vivian
may have forbidden her; there never was any love lost between him
and me. If you will spare me for a couple of hours, Lady Alice, I
will go to Bond-street; for though my grandfather never saw me, I
must hear something of Eveline."</p>

<p>"Go, my dear, and God speed you, for we leave here shortly for
Falcontower. Take the carriage," and Lady Alice rang the bell, and
ordered the carriage.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that a brougham stopped before John Everard's
shop, and a lady, closely veiled, stepped out, and entering the
shop, addressed the ancient foreman, "Is Mr. Everard within?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, he is out," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Is there a young lady living here?" she asked, "a Mrs.
Vivian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, there is my master's grand-daughter," said the
foreman. "Mrs. Vivian is now at home."</p>

<p>"I must see her&mdash;and at once," said Theresa. The foreman
bowed, rang a little bell, and a maid-servant appeared, who
conducted Theresa up stairs to a very pretty drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Tell Mrs. Vivian that Miss Herbert wishes to see her," said
Theresa.</p>

<p>The girl left the room, and Theresa threw up her veil and stood
waiting. A slow faltering step came along outside, and Arthur
Vivian's forsaken wife entered.</p>

<p>"Theresa!" she cried. One spring, and poor Eveline was in her
sister's arms. And then they told their griefs to each other, for
Eveline, ever weak and clinging, must lean on something, and
Theresa must have sympathy, and so in mutual confidence they found
mutual relief and comfort.</p>

<p>John Everard came in shortly afterwards, and the dear good old
man welcomed the second grandchild almost as he had done the first,
and wanted her to live with him also; but Theresa knew well that it
was better for all parties that she should not; besides, she could
not honorably leave her situation; so she said she would remain
there. All she asked was a place in her grandfather's heart, and a
corner of his hearth as a home.</p>

<p>Thus once more the light shone on her path, and thus Theresa
Herbert was not left standing alone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p>It was a fine frosty morning of a bright sunny day in December
that the carriage which was bearing Mrs. Rochester and her daughter
and Cousin Tom to Falcontower neared its destination. Isbel had
never been there before, and everything had an interest for
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" she exclaimed, as they entered the quaint old town
of Falcontower, "do look at that dear old inn, the Egerton Arms,"
pointing to a wandering old inn facing the sea, and which had stood
for ages.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Marion, "the walls of that inn concealed a lord of
Falcontower once, when soldiers were searching his own castle for
him in vain."</p>

<p>"Who was that, mamma?" asked Isbel.</p>

<p>"Angelo's great grandfather," replied her mother. "Sir James
Egerton was out in the 'forty-five' you know, and after the
Pretender fled back to France, he came here, and was actually in
that inn while the royal soldiers were searching the castle. You
will see his picture up yonder."</p>

<p>Here the carriage stopped at the gates of the Park, of which on
this side there was about a mile to traverse. They were obliged to
go slowly, for all the way the road was a steep ascent on the
right, far below rolled the sea, and they could hear the sullen
measured roar of the breakers as they crashed on the rocks and
beach beneath, while to the left, as far as the eye could reach, it
rested enchanted on forest-clad heights with giant oaks, and waving
pines, and and wooded valleys, and deep and rocky gorges. It was
indeed a noble domain, and right noble too was the stately old
castle which now burst upon their view.</p>

<p>"Why," said Isbel, when she could speak, "it has all its
fortifications, just as in:&mdash;</p>

<p>'That golden antique time</p>

<p>When knights and nobles for a lady's love</p>

<p>Would spear the dragon.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother; "though it has stood nearly eight
centuries, and many a siege, its successive owners have cared so
well for it, that there's little or nothing of ruin about it. Look
at its lofty stern old donjon, with the proud banner of a proud
house waving over it."</p>

<p>"What an impregnable fortress!" said Isbel.</p>

<p>Marion smiled, and Tom said, "Strong as it looks, a smart
cannonading of modern artillery would soon make a ruin of that
grand old baronial pile."</p>

<p>Isbel said no more, but as the carriage rolled under the massive
gateway, and she glanced at the grim walls and frowning towers and
battlements that rose up on all sides, she could not help saying,
"I shouldn't like to be a prisoner here, though."</p>

<p>The carriage passed through another gateway into an immense
quadrangle, and drew up before the magnificent entrance, where
instead of mail-clad knights, Inez and Egerton received them, and
gave them "welcome to old Falcontower," and Inez herself took
Marion to her room, and as she left her at the door, whispered, "I
must go to receive the other guests who have arrived, and are in
their rooms; but when you are ready go to Angelo's private study
(you know your way), Julian is there."</p>

<p>Knew the way&mdash;of course she did, and through the ups and
downs of dark galleries and stairways gained the door.</p>

<p>Julian was in that study; at last she was to meet the son she
had parted from nine years before, and now that moment had arrived,
she stopped, trembling, almost fearing to enter the room; it was
only a moment, and then she went in. There he stood; changed as he
was, she knew him, and the emotion of years seemed crowded into the
single moment she paused, ere she sprang forwards to the arms that
held her so close.</p>

<p>"Julian! my boy, my son! my worshipped boy!"</p>

<p>All the anguish of that long, weary separation was forgotten,
and in that moment she knew, felt only that she once more clasped
her son, her idolised boy, to her mother's heart; for the very
mother who bore him could not have loved him with a greater love
than his step-mother did. He let her weep the happy tears that
might at last flow, and his own breast heaved, but then he held her
off.</p>

<p>"My beautiful mother, my own sweet mother," he said, in a low
voice; "it seemed as if we were never again to meet on this side of
the grave, and now it must be by stealth as if it were wrong."</p>

<p>"But, oh, Julian," she said, "for my sake, if not for your own,
remember that in public we are nothing but strangers."</p>

<p>"That is the hardest to bear," said Julian, bitterly; "to be
compelled to treat you, and Angelo, and Inez as comparative
strangers."</p>

<p>"Dear Julian, my dear son," said his mother, again winding her
arms round him, "hope and trust that all will come right; it is
begun, if it had not, you could not now be here; and though the
murderer has escaped, he will surely be taken."</p>

<p>"Look at me, mother, and tell me if I am so changed that no one
will recognise me, not even Tom Courtenay?"</p>

<p>Tom had known a beardless youth of eighteen, with a fair
complexion and golden hair. Now, in his place there stood a tall,
strong man of seven-and-twenty, with a bronzed complexion, a dark
mustache on the lip, and hair which, if it had retained any of its
golden light, had deepened into a rich dark brown, totally
different to the sunny locks of the youth. The eyes were the same;
but the very features had changed. They had grown sterner, more
defined; and care and sorrow had not left scathless the once smooth
brow. The very smile was sadder, and his voice had deepened and
mellowed. And as Marion gazed on the face of her son, she felt that
none would recognise in the somewhat foreign-looking Julian
Rothesay the Julian D'Arcy they had known as a boy and youth.</p>

<p>"You are so changed, my darling boy," she said, "that even Tom
will not know you."</p>

<p>The door opened softly, and Inez glided in. "Angelo sent me,"
she said, with a gentle smile. "Isbel has missed you, aunt Marion;
go back, and you, Julian, come with me another way. We must enter
the drawing-room by the boudoir." She pushed Marion gently from the
room, and came back to Julian, "Now, you'll remember that I must
'Mr. Rothesay' you."</p>

<p>"And must I 'miss' you?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"No," said she; "because Angelo and I were so intimate with you
abroad when I was quite a child."</p>

<p>"So, as you are not yet grown up, I may still 'Inez' you," added
Julian, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll tell you this," said Inez, "no one here
understands Italian but you, I, Angelo, and Marion; even Isbel
doesn't, for she learnt German instead, and, as you have been so
long in Italy, it will not be counted rude now and then to speak to
you in Italian, but rather a courtesy to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the hint," said Julian. "Now come."</p>

<p>They reached the drawing-room soon after Mrs. Rochester, and
then Angelo introduced Julian to his guests, of whom as yet there
were none but whom we know: Lady Alice St. John, and her sons and
niece, with Theresa, the Rochesters, Walter Surrey, and Roland
Aubrey, whom, having met in town at Louis St. John's, Egerton had
asked to Falcontower as a return for his courtesy to his ward.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p>"What a false, lying girl this Inez is!" it may be said. "It's
not right or moral; no good can ever come of lying and deceit."</p>

<p>Now, we are afraid that this is a point where, as the old lady
said, "Paul and I differ," and we must perforce defend our heroine.
This is not a perfect world, and in this world there is no way of
meeting deceit but by deceit; it is one of the necessary evils
which sin entails on the earth. A murder had been committed by one
man, that another&mdash;an innocent man&mdash;was suffering under
the conviction of, an exile, a fugitive for it; and the only way to
meet such an artful villain as Vivian, who had so long defied
justice, was by an art and subtlety superior to his own. Which was
the most monstrous wrong&mdash;that an innocent man should so
suffer, or that Inez should act as she did?</p>

<p>Margaret Arundel had thought of it often, and of the share she
had had in the systematic deception of her Spanish friend. She
spoke of it the morning of Christmas Eve as she and Inez stood on
the ramparts which looked down on the sea.</p>

<p>"Inez," said she, "I could never have done what you have
done."</p>

<p>The Castilian was leaning against a partially ruined battlement,
looking gloomily out into the blue expanse of ocean. At Margaret's
words, she said, "What do you mean&mdash;that I was wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, not that exactly, Inez," was the reply; "for though, in
strict morality, I suppose it was wrong, somehow I can't help
thinking it right."</p>

<p>"Right or wrong, I don't care," said Inez, recklessly. "The
wrong is all my own, and I'll take that chance."</p>

<p>"Would you go through it all again?" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Yes, a thousandfold," replied Inez.</p>

<p>"What!" said Margaret; "again through that night in the
cloisters; more than all, through that horrible ten minutes on the
river's strand, when you knew Vivian meant to murder you."</p>

<p>"Let justice be done, though the heavens should fall," said Inez
de Caldara; "it is a sentiment worthy of a Roman."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, Isbel now joined them, saying, "Might
I ask you to show us the picture-gallery? We have heard so much of
it."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," was the reply. "Ah! here is Walter Surrey."</p>

<p>Surrey approached, smiled, and offered her his arm, and taking
it Inez led the way to the magnificent picture gallery&mdash;a
perfect gallery of art; sculptures and painting, ancient and
modern; master-pieces of all ages were here gathered together.
There seemed scarce a painter or sculptor, from ancient Greece to
the present day, but had contributed some gem of art to it, and
while Walter was bending over a classic vase, Isbel was standing
entranced before an exquisite painting of Sir Thomas Lawrence's,
representing a beautiful woman in early youth.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" almost whispered Isbel.</p>

<p>"It is Helen Rothesay, Lady Egerton, Sir Reginald's mother. She
died young. This was painted from a crayon of her."</p>

<p>"Poor thing! And who are those two&mdash;in this one large
frame? What a beautiful couple!"</p>

<p>She might well say so. It was a picture of a handsome man in a
Highland bonnet and plaid of the Stewart tartan, and leaning on his
arm was a young and most beautiful Italian lady, with one of those
faces that, like Charles the First's, seemed to have a heavy doom
written in them.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" she next enquired.</p>

<p>"That is Sir James Egerton," said Inez. "He was out in the
'forty-five,' and died abroad in the service of Prince Charles,
while his son was secretly brought up at the castle."</p>

<p>"And this fair Italian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was his wife, Leonora D'Este. She was following her husband
into exile, but the vessel was wrecked on the French coast. Her
corpse was found and secretly brought here and buried in the
cloisters. There is a broken column on her tomb."</p>

<p>"How comes Sir James in that dress?" asked Isbel.</p>

<p>"His mother was the daughter of a Sir Archibald Stewart, who had
lands in Blair Athole. That is how it is."</p>

<p>"I should have told Sir James's for an Egerton face," observed
Walter. "I observe in all those portraits a strong family likeness,
from that grim old knight of Norman William's to Sir Angelo; they
have all the same full gray eye and somewhat Roman cast of face;
they have been a dark race and a handsome one."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Castilian, passing slowly on, "and an unquiet
one; few of them have died in their beds."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Isbel; "but is there no portrait of Sir
Angelo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just near," was the reply.</p>

<p>A step more, and they stood before Julian's masterly portrait of
Egerton, which was hanging next that of his beautiful and ill-fated
Spanish mother. On the other side of his there was a blank space.
Walter Surrey stood for a long time looking at both, then glanced
several times from the portraits to Inez, and then said, "Miss
Rochester, look at these three faces; how alike they are. Surely,
Miss de Caldara, this dark lady was some relation to you and your
guardian!"</p>

<p>Inez dropped her eyes from Jesuita's picture, and said,
"Certainly. She was his mother, and my second cousin. Her name was
Caldara."</p>

<p>She passed on as she spoke, but the sunlight from a window
gleamed for a moment on a few gray hairs amidst Inez's raven
tresses, and Walter, as he saw them, remembered with a pain of
self-reproach what before he had forgotten&mdash;that he had heard
that Lady Egerton had come darkly by her death.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p>Stephen Stanfeld left the Insolvent Court a ruined, childless,
homeless man. One child had fled from him&mdash;he neither knew nor
cared where, and the other he had deliberately flung away, less
friendless in the wide world without than with him. He turned his
back on the mighty city, a man whose own hand had made him at sixty
utterly alone and friendless in the world. Not even a memory of a
being who had loved him, and whom he had loved. Where did the man
whose whole life had been a tissue of wrong pass that Christmas
night? Wandering like a ghost about the desolate, deserted mansion
that for nearly forty years had been his&mdash;not even a single
light there now. Every window was shut up and barred; the weeds
grew more rank, the hemlock more tall and straggling; the few
flowers Arthur's wife had been used to train and tend were dead
now, and nothing but desolation reigned in the lonely old Grange,
where some fifty years before old Herbert Surrey had kept open
house, and, later, banished his only son from&mdash;all dead; and
now the old place had passed once more into the hands of the
Surreys, represented by the son of Armitage Surrey; and as Stephen
Stanfeld stood beneath the tall trees and gazed on all he had lost,
he lifted his hand and cursed aloud the name of Angelo Egerton, the
man who had wrested so fair a domain from his hands.</p>

<p>"Ay, curse away!" said a voice. "Curses, they say, recoil on
them as speak them." And a tall, portly man stood before him. "What
are you doing on these grounds, eh?"</p>

<p>"What I choose!" replied Stanfeld. "Who are you, fellow?"</p>

<p>"Maybe an honester man than Stephen Stanfeld," was the reply.
"My name's Sam Warren, and I'm left in charge here by the gentleman
you so liberally provide with a warm place in eternity. You're
trespassing here, sir, and must leave."</p>

<p>"Do you know, fellow, that I was master here?" said Stanfeld,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, you were; but Sir Angelo Egerton is master here
now, and he has placed me in charge, so be kind enough to walk
away, sir. I don't wish to be rude, but duty is duty."</p>

<p>Stanfeld turned on his heel, and walked away&mdash;a homeless
wanderer&mdash;made so by his own hand alone.</p>

<p>Where that snowy winter's night was Arthur Vivian? While the
good old yule log blazed in the immense hall of the keep at
Falcontower Castle&mdash;while a gay and happy crowd merrily danced
the 'Sir Roger de Coverley'&mdash;while the sad face of Jesuita de
Caldara looked mournfully down on the many bright young faces, her
assassin was standing before John Everard's door, closely wrapped
in a heavy mantle, and with his hat slouched low, but still worn
with a certain jaunty air, as if he knew&mdash;as he did&mdash;that
he was handsome. He stood there hesitating whether to knock boldly,
or watch an opportunity of finding out if his wife were there. He
wanted money, and he knew he could get it from her, if she had it.
He knocked at last at the private door, which was opened by a
middle-aged woman.</p>

<p>"Does a lady live here of the name of Vivian?" he
said&mdash;"Mrs. Vivian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Everard's grand-daughter."</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to tell her that a gentleman&mdash;an
old friend&mdash;wishes to see her at once, and privately?"</p>

<p>"Step into this room, sir. What name shall I say?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;merely what I said."</p>

<p>The woman retired, and in a few minutes his wife stood before
him, looking very ill, but firmer than he had ever yet seen
her.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, putting out her hands to keep him back,
"that there is a price on your head&mdash;that you are pursued? Do
you court death, that you venture here? No, keep back&mdash;do not
touch me."</p>

<p>"Evie, Evie!" he said. "Is it my wife who speaks? You used to
love me. Are you not still Arthur Vivian's wife?"</p>

<p>"That dark night," she said, still keeping him back, "when you
told me you never loved me&mdash;when you told me you had wedded me
with a red hand&mdash;when you flung me from your bosom with fierce
oaths, my love died. Your wife&mdash;yes, I am Arthur Vision's
wife; but I am not to be brutally flung away one day and wooed back
at his pleasure. Arthur Vivian, I know you now."</p>

<p>"Eveline, hear me, hear me!" he implored. "I am a wanderer on
the earth, an exile, a proscribed man, hunted from city to city,
from land to land; houseless in the dark dreadful night, without
the means to evade present want, or live from day to day. Eveline,
will you let your husband be taken for want of means to leave the
country for ever?"</p>

<p>"Swear to me that you will never let me see your face again,"
said Eveline; "that the few months I have to live shall be passed
in peace, and I will give you the means to fly."</p>

<p>"I swear it," he replied.</p>

<p>His wife threw a heavy purse on the table; he took it up, moved
towards the door, and then paused. "What do you mean by the few
months you have to live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Arthur Vivian," said his wife. "I am dying! One
kind word from you that night would have saved me."</p>

<p>"Eveline, Eveline! have I not enough blood on my head, but you
must lay yours on me, too!"</p>

<p>"Arthur, farewell," said Eveline. "Oh, God have mercy on
you!"</p>

<p>"God!" he murmured, as he stood once more in the darkness and
falling snow, and raised that face of dark and agonised beauty
upward. "I dare not believe in God&mdash;it were to drag me into
hell. My only hope is that 'after death is nothingness.'"</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p>"AND now, ladies and gentlemen," said Angelo Egerton, the
morning after Christmas Day, "how do you propose to spend to-day?
It is fine and frosty for those who like to go out, and for those
who don't, there is plenty indoors."</p>

<p>"Put it to the House," said Tom Courtenay. "I move that the
speaker do order out the horses for a general gallop over the
heights. Come, ladies and gentlemen, those who second me, up
hands."</p>

<p>All hands were held up save those of Lady Alice St. John, Julian
Rothesay, and Egerton, and the latter said, "Well, I see the vote
is general. I must beg you all to excuse me, for I have business to
attend to; but Inez will go with you as guide. She knows the
district as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Am I to order your horse, Julian?" asked Inez, with her hand on
the door.</p>

<p>"No, I remain with Angelo," he replied.</p>

<p>"Are any of the ladies particular about what horses they ride?"
added the young hostess.</p>

<p>"Mine are, my dear," said Lady Alice; "Arabella and Theresa are
timid riders, if you have any quiet horses."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they shall have the phaeton ponies," said Inez; "They
are swift, but perfectly gentle."</p>

<p>She left the room to order the horses, and the ladies betook
themselves to don their riding habits. Inez was down in less than
ten minutes, and went off to the great quadrangle, where the
gentlemen and horses were waiting.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take us, Inez?" said Louis St. John;
"east, west, north, or south?"</p>

<p>"North, I think," she replied.</p>

<p>"Take them round by the Devil's Rock, Inez," said Egerton. "Ah,
here are the ladies."</p>

<p>The whole party were soon mounted, the castle gates were flung
wide, and with Inez at their head, they swept through, and
descended the steep hill on which the castle stood, taking their
way along the cliffs. Egerton and Julian ascended to the wall and
sauntered round to the north rampart.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Angelo, throwing his arm over Julian's shoulder as
they stood side by side; "Inez has set them in a canter
already."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Julian; "and Walter and Miss Herbert are last."</p>

<p>"How's that?" said Egerton, uneasily, "I mounted him well."</p>

<p>"He probably likes the lady's company," observed the artist,
glancing at Angelo's dark face.</p>

<p>"Too much, I thought, last night," said Egerton, with a half
laugh; "but it may be a mere boyish fancy for almost the first
pretty English face he has seen much of."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of his seriously caring for her? Don't you want
it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Egerton, very decidedly. "You know who she really
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Julian. "Stephen Stanfeld's daughter."</p>

<p>"His child, and sister-in-law to a murderer," said Egerton; "her
sister is Vivian's wife. A nice connection truly for the son of
Armitage Surrey," he added, with a strong emphasis.</p>

<p>"But she seems a very sweet girl, though," said Julian. "If
Walter should really care for her, you will not stand between
them?"</p>

<p>"If he was any relation of mine, I very decidedly should,"
replied Egerton.</p>

<p>"And as it is?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof," said Egerton.
"Will he be much of a painter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a most talented amateur," replied Julian. "If, instead of
having property, he had to live by it, he would have been a very
superior artist."</p>

<p>"How is it, old follow, that you haven't brought home an Italian
wife?" said Angelo, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, no; my exile only makes me cling closer to everything
English," said Julian. "I might ask you, rather, why you don't
present me to Lady Egerton."</p>

<p>Angelo half smiled, but the smile was a sad one. "Julian," said
he, "I am thirty-seven, there are lines on my brow, and there is
gray in my hair; it will be hard to make any fair young girl love
me now."</p>

<p>"Dear Angelo, I am sorry to find so eminent a politician talking
nonsense. You might; and might still choose any girl you
liked."</p>

<p>"Julian, have you yet found your ideal?" asked Angelo.</p>

<p>"The ideal, if found, is often beyond reach," said Julian,
evasively.</p>

<p>Angelo's dark eyes turned on him with a keen, penetrating
glance, that it was well Julian did not meet. He answered quietly,
"It is often nearer to us than we imagine, Julian."</p>

<p>"Have you yet found your ideal of woman, Angelo, or have you
placed it so high that mortal being cannot approach it?"</p>

<p>Egerton recoiled a little, but answered, "I did not create my
own ideal; I can no more help placing it high than I can help
worshipping all that is grand and beautiful."</p>

<p>"A Jesuitical answer," said Julian, smiling. Then he said,
perhaps because he intuitively felt the subject a painful one to
his companion, or it might be that the very depth of the love he
bore him made him see through Angelo's veil of proud reserve, "I
heard Walter Surrey speaking of the portrait. 'Tekel' is the name
it seems known by. Does he know whose portrait it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Egerton. "Yesterday he and I were in the chapel
cloisters, standing by my mother's tomb; he said he had seen the
picture at the National Gallery, and was expressing his wonder how
any imagination could conceive such faces as those of the man and
the phantom who holds the scroll.</p>

<p>"'Rothesay didn't imagine them,' said I. 'Have you never seen a
face like the phantom?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said; 'it was like my ward; but he knew that the
painter knew her.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' I said, 'and the picture is the portrait of a living
man.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! is it possible?' he cried, holding up his hand 'What a
horrible countenance! Do you know him?'</p>

<p>"'My mother's murderer,' said I, quietly. 'I had it painted; and
it will finally be brought to the gallery here.' I believe he
thought me half mad," added Egerton, with his low, soft laugh. "But
now, Julian, I must go to my study, and attend to my business.
Where is Lady Alice?"</p>

<p>"I am going to find her," he replied.</p>

<p>Each went a different way&mdash;Egerton to the library, Julian
to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Where meanwhile was the riding party? Watch that lofty crag,
rising black and sharp from the sea, it is higher than the other
cliffs, and at the commencement of its ascent the road branches
into two, one continuing over the summit, the other, only about ten
feet broad, winding round it, with the rocks towering above it, and
the sea surging far below. As the party came up to the fork road
they halted, their guide was behind talking to Roland Aubrey, but
as she came up they exclaimed, "Miss de Caldara, you are not going
to jeopardise our lives by taking us round this road, are you?"</p>

<p>"Those who don't like to venture," said the Spaniard, smiling,
"can keep the cliff road, and we shall meet them half a mile on.
This is the Devil's Rock, and this the Devil's Pass. Who will take
it with me?" she added, stepping Hasseneh on to the Pass.</p>

<p>Cuthbert St. John, who was next her, would rather have gone over
the cliff, but as the gentlemen all volunteered (saving the rector,
who, having passed it before, concluded to escort the ladies) he
could do no less than go too, the more so that Isbel, Mrs.
Rochester, and Margaret Arundel also took the Pass; so, in single
file, with the Castilian in the van, they set off. Tom, who
immediately followed the Reverend Cuthbert, was not long before he
devised means of a joke at the expense of the priest, which had
almost ended fatally.</p>

<p>"Inez," he called out, "does his Satanic Majesty still haunt
this place? because if so our reverend friend might exorcise
him."</p>

<p>"Tom, be quiet, and don't talk nonsense!" she turned to speak as
he meant she should, and catching her eye, he folded his hands, and
pulled his face into a long lugubrious look&mdash;such a caricature
of Cuthbert that even her grave Spanish nature could not resist it,
and Inez's irresistible and half suppressed laugh made Cuthbert
turn sharply.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Cuthbert was already rendered somewhat
giddy by the dizzy height, and his sudden and passionate start
round completed his giddiness. He lost his saddle, reeled for a
minute on the edge of the precipice, and then, as he lost his
footing, flung his arms wildly out, catching at something. It was
Inez's ready hand that saved him&mdash;for in the moment he
staggered, she backed Hasseneh, and, bending over, stretched out
her right arm; it was her hand which the falling man grasped, and
but for the noble Arabian standing so firm, his weight must have
dragged horse and rider over. The strain on Inez was fearful, and a
cry burst from her lips&mdash;no thought then for titles&mdash;"Oh,
Louis, Louis!"</p>

<p>All had passed in less than a minute. St. John and Tom had flung
themselves from their horses and hauled up Cuthbert quite unhurt.
Louis' arm was thrown round Inez, as her arms fell nerveless at her
side. "He is safe; but you, my child, you are hurt?" Her face was
very white, for the agony had been intense as it was short.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it is only numbed; it is going off, Colonel
Louis. Your brother&mdash;Mr. St. John, are you unhurt?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, thanks to your courage," replied Cuthbert, as he
remounted, and Tom, for the time quite sobered, fell back, and was
very good until they left the Devil's Pass, and rejoined the
others; and then he told the story (minus his own mimicry) in his
own droll manner, for, after all, there had been something very
ridiculous in the accident, despite its being so nearly fatal. But
he was not to come off so easily, for a few miles on, Inez
contrived to get him alone, and spoke, as she could, when really
angry.</p>

<p>"Tom," she said, "it's all very well for you to make a laughable
story out of that, and turn it into ridicule, but it was no
laughing matter; Cuthbert St. John was as near eternity as ever he
will be, and if you had faced death as I have, you would not jest
about it as you have done. And now, Tom, I tell you once for all,
that you must control your mischievous tendency to tease and joke
while you are my guest; for, whatever there is ridiculous about
him, he is my guest too, and I cannot permit him to be made a butt
for your wit. There, now you have had your scolding," she added;
"so let us be friends again, and let the rest come up."</p>

<p>Tom was very good and very civil to Cuthbert all that day. "For,
by Jove!" he whispered to Isbel, "I don't want another of our
senorita's stern rebukes."</p>

<p>It was long past noon when our party returned; but before Inez
could dismount, Cuthbert had sprung to the ground, and was at her
side. He clasped in his own the little hand that had saved him.
"Inez de Caldara, you have saved my life. I shall never forget it,"
he said, simply, and lifted her to the ground; but he also never
forgot Tom Courtenay.</p>

<p>Did the incident, apparently so slight, end its influence there?
No. Look at Louis St. John that evening, when all are in the
drawing-room; he is standing a little apart, unseen but
seeing&mdash;his eyes fixed on Inez, to whom Roland Aubrey is
devoting himself with an assiduity that Angelo has noticed with an
inward smile, and St. John now sees without any fear of rivalry.
Yes, he knows now that he loves her; no use to say to himself, "She
is a child; no use to call it folly, a fancy&mdash;nonsense."</p>

<p>'His heart was darken'd with her shadow.'</p>

<p>Till that day, man of the world as he was, he had not realised
it; but on that Pass his first thought had not been for Cuthbert,
but for her, and his eyes were opened to know his own heart, and
that heart beat faster as it remembered that his name had been the
first she called upon for help. "Louis, Louis!" was her cry; and
fatally misconstruing that&mdash;mistaking her simple, open,
child-like affection for him&mdash;he madly dreamed that her love
was his&mdash;that he read her heart&mdash;that proud, sensitive,
reserved woman's heart of hers, that even Angelo knew not
thoroughly. Yet deeply as St. John loved her, he did not love her
as Angelo did. It will break that strong stern heart to lose the
child-love it has twined every fibre round&mdash;</p>

<p>'As the vine weaves her tendrils;'</p>

<p>but to lose her will only bruise and crush St. John's, for, it
may be for years, but it will not be for ever. To a man like St.
John, the honorable course was to at once speak to her guardian,
and obtain his sanction. Why not that night? He knew that Egerton
always went to his library after the rest had retired; and so, when
all had left the drawing-room, he walked to the library, and, with
a slight knock, entered.</p>

<p>Egerton was in the great old gloomy room, sitting in an easy
chair by the fire, with a table at his side, and several
ministerial-looking papers on it; but the master, whose hand was to
bring them into form, was himself doing nothing.</p>

<p>"Egerton," said Louis, "can you give me ten minutes?"</p>

<p>"As long as you like, Louis. Sit down," said Angelo, rousing
himself from a reverie.</p>

<p>St. John sat down, with the air of a man who has made up his
mind to go through with a disagreeable thing; so much so that
Angelo noticed it with a half smile, and said, "You have something
to say, Louis, that you don't know how to begin&mdash;what our
Western neighbors call 'a fix.' Plunge boldly in."</p>

<p>"Angelo," said Louis, "you are keen. What I have to say relates
to Inez, and on that point most important in all men's lives."</p>

<p>Egerton knew now what was coming, and he stretched out his arm
very quietly, and moved the lamp a little back, throwing himself in
shade.</p>

<p>"Angelo," continued St. John, "think me
mad&mdash;foolish&mdash;what you will, but I love her&mdash;love
her as perhaps a stern, ambitious man like you, who lives only in
public life, cannot understand."</p>

<p>Egerton lifted his eyes and looked at him. Did he know him so
little after all those years&mdash;he who had loved her since she
was a little child in his arms, nestling to his breast in all her
childish troubles and ailments?</p>

<p>"But you are her guardian," said Louis, "and I deemed it the
honorable course first to ask your sanction to win her. I have
hope&mdash;a fair hope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think Inez loves you otherwise than as an old friend?"
asked Egerton.</p>

<p>"Can any man say he knows a girl's heart?" said Louis. "I
think&mdash;I hope she does. Have I your sanction to my
suit&mdash;your permission to ask her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Egerton.</p>

<p>Heaven only knows what it cost him to say that word. But for the
innate nobility of the soul, but for the stern pride of the man, he
could not have resigned her so calmly. The word had passed the firm
lips&mdash;the handsome face was still and marble like&mdash;set,
and cold, and calm as a beautiful statue. It might have been some
classic statue for any warmth that face had, saving the dark eyes,
and they were fixed on St. John, who now rose.</p>

<p>"Then, plainly, I have your free sanction," he said, smiling,
"to rob you of your sweet ward? You will miss her at first,
Egerton."</p>

<p>"I am a stern, ambitious man, who lives only in public life.
No," said the minister, moving a little more into the shade.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, Angelo," said Louis. "Your gift is
inestimable."</p>

<p>"Good night, Louis," he responded.</p>

<p>"It is late already, Egerton," said Louis. "Have all those
papers to be attended to tonight?"</p>

<p>"They must be in town to-morrow," said Egerton, wearily; "I must
take them myself."</p>

<p>"Shall you return to-morrow?" asked Louis.</p>

<p>"No, the day after," he replied. "I may be detained. Write and
tell me of your success."</p>

<p>"I will," said Louis. "Once more, good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Louis," was the reply, in the same tone as before.
The door closed, and Angelo Egerton was alone.</p>

<p>How very dark the library was&mdash;how the gloom had deepened
into black night&mdash;and how very silent it was, as if something
had died there that night. How very, very dreary and still it was,
but not more still than the silent, motionless figure sitting
there, with the arms resting on the table, the head bowed on
them&mdash;hearing nothing, seeing nothing, feeling nothing, but
the heavy weariness of agony that had stricken the strong heart to
the earth. He had thought he knew her inmost heart; he had once
dreamed she might love him, but that was past; it seemed long years
ago now; the 'dead past must bury its dead'&mdash;that proud,
ambitious man, would have given all his long line of ancestors
now&mdash;all his hard won honors to have back his lost
child-love&mdash;but it was too late, and the weary sense that
something had died there that night grew deeper and heavier.</p>

<p>So the hours that seemed years wore on, and each hour sank and
vanished into the dim vista of time, but that bowed form never
moved; the lamp burned down and went out&mdash;he knew it not; the
fire dwindled lower and lower, and grew fiery red, throwing the
black shadow of the bars on the opposite wall&mdash;still that
silent figure remained motionless; the coals grew black and turned
to ashes, and the gloomy old library grew cold and chill&mdash;he
heeded it not, felt it not; the black night gave place to the dull
cold gray dawn of the winter's morning, and gradually the first
rays of the December sun streamed aslant through the fog into the
room&mdash;but still that silent, tearless mourner for what had
died that night, never moved, felt not the cold, heard not the step
outside, nor the door open and close, till a hand, lightly and
tenderly as a woman's, was laid on his shoulder, and Egerton raised
his ghastly face to see Julian bending over him.</p>

<p>"Angelo&mdash;oh, Angelo," said Julian, "what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied, in a hard, dry tone, and putting Julian
aside with his hand; but Julian clasped it in his own.</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago," he said, "when I was a child, this right
hand of yours drew me to your heart, and I will not now be put away
with this cold hand&mdash;with that hard 'nothing.' Proud man, you
may case your haughty soul in adamant chains of stern reserve to
all others, but you shall not, cannot place your pride between us
two, 'Nothing!' What, do you think I cannot see below the stormy
surface&mdash;do you think I cannot read your ghastly face, or see
that you have never left this room all night? Oh, Angelo, do not
all the ties that knit our souls together give me a right to your
confidence?"</p>

<p>The statue-like face softened, and he said gently, trying to
release his hand from the firm grasp that would not release it,
"Why should I burden your young head with my sorrows? I am
weary&mdash;weary&mdash;Julian, that is all; let me attend to these
papers."</p>

<p>"You shall not," said Julian. "You were yourself when we parted
last night."</p>

<p>Last night! How many years ago it seemed! and the words came
unconsciously from his lips, "Only hours&mdash;it seems a
life-time&mdash;weary years. Julian, I lost something last
night."</p>

<p>"Angelo, I know all now," said Julian. "I saw St. John come
here."</p>

<p>Pride gave way now, the proud man broke down, and he bowed his
face on the hands that still clasped his. "Oh, Julian, Julian!"
said he; "she was all I had!"</p>

<p>For a long time Julian did not speak. He could not, for he had
never before seen a strong man weep; never before witnessed such
deep, passionate anguish. Then at last his soft voice said,
"Angelo, old friend, he cannot&mdash;does not love her as you do.
He has mistaken her simple, frank affection for him for love. If I
know anything of woman's heart, she will never be his wife. Hope!
You have not lost your child-love."</p>

<p>"I have," said Egerton, rising. "What man ever yet really knew a
woman's heart? Is not her affection for me, too, as frankly shown,
as unconcealed? I dreamed once that she might have loved me&mdash;I
was mad&mdash;mad to think that I, twenty-two years older than her,
could ever be more to her than a guardian. Leave me now, dear
Julian. Excuse me to them. I am going to take these papers to town,
and I shall return to-morrow night late. Sit up for me, but do not
let her do so. Henceforth I will be what he believes me&mdash;a
stern, ambitious man, who lives only in public life," he said, with
a bitter smile.</p>

<p>"Does he know so little of you&mdash;you?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Hold him excused, Julian. He has seen but little of Angelo. It
is Egerton he knows. May he love her as I do&mdash;as I should have
done."</p>

<p>"He cannot&mdash;it is not in him!" said Julian. "Ah, Angelo,
you are a noble, generous spirit to resign her so calmly. Heaven
knows how well I love you, but never so well as now."</p>

<p>"It is all left me," said Angelo, turning aside. Then he wrung
Julian's hand in silence, for he could not speak; and taking up the
ministerial papers, he went out of the gloomy old library.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>All is told. Louis St. John had found Inez in that old library,
and with earnest, impassioned language, he has poured out his
love&mdash;laid his heart at her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez, do not send me from you!" he said. "Do not tell me
you do not&mdash;cannot love me."</p>

<p>Startled, almost frightened, overborne by the passionate
eloquence with which he had spoken, she had stood till now like a
statue, hearing, understanding, yet hardly realising his words,
hearing him with the dark grave face turned to him, and wondering
half frightened glance. But now, when she most needed it, her
self-possession failed her, and suddenly covering her face, she
wept passionately&mdash;wept for herself, that her affection had
been so misconstrued; wept for him, that his wild dream was broken;
wept, as all sensitive true-hearted women must, that she had
wittingly caused such misery to the man who had laid his very soul
at her feet. It was only for a minute, and then she dropped her
hands, and turned the sweet sad face to his.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! Oh, Colonel Louis, forgive me!" said Inez. "I never
dreamed this. I am so young. My affection was so
different&mdash;its very frankness should have warned you. I do not
love you&mdash;I never should. I can never be your wife. Think of
me, if you can, only as the child you have known. Forgot the woman
you have loved!" She held out her hand, and said, "For your own
sake, as much as for mine, do not leave till the afternoon, and
part with me calmly. May heaven restore you to peace and happiness,
Louis St. John."</p>

<p>He held the little hand for a minute, and bent low over it. "God
bless you, Inez!" he murmured, hoarsely, and left the room.</p>

<p>Julian came into the library some time after, and found the
Castilian on the floor, weeping with a passionate bitterness of
grief that seemed to rack every fibre of her slender frame. He
raised her, saying in his gentle, tender way, "Dry the tears,
little one. It is his first love and first dream. Both are broken.
Have we not all dreamed, and been rudely awakened to the stern
reality? A few years hence, perhaps, and he will forget his dream,
and it may be, find happiness in another's love."</p>

<p>He wiped away the tears, and bending down, kissed her forehead,
and then, with the thought and delicate tact of a woman for both
her and St. John, he took her quietly away for a long walk over the
hills through the fog and mist&mdash;what mattered that? And when
she returned, hours after, Margaret met her, and told her that
Colonel St. John had been suddenly called to London to see an old
companion in arms who was dangerously ill, and she was just in time
to bid him good-bye.</p>

<p>But Inez's habitual self control had resumed its sway, and when
she parted from St. John no one could have guessed that anything
painful had passed between them. Only Julian, and Louis' gentle
mother&mdash;to whom her son had told everything&mdash;could see
that his lips quivered, and that the dark eyes of the Spaniard
drooped. She crept away to the summit of a lofty watchtower facing
the south, and stood watching the carriage that bore him away, till
the trees hid it, and then she turned away, murmuring, "I could
never have been his wife&mdash;I could never have loved him," And
unconsciously her hand stole to the cross on her heart, and clasped
it close and clingingly.</p>

<p>It was long before she met Louis St. John again.</p>

<p>And where was Angelo Egerton? At the time St. John was leaving
Falcontower Castle, he was bending over those papers in the
Foreign-office. He had not, and did not intend to go near St.
James' Square. He could not bear to go there, where everything
would seem to remind him of what he had lost. There he was again
the next morning early, looking over papers, reading and answering
letters with the calmness and coolness which had always marked him,
concentrating his mind and energies on what for the time being
demanded his attention; and no one, to see that dark severe face,
would have found out any change, save, perhaps, if he paused for a
moment, a very close observer might have noticed a weary look about
the mouth and in the eyes, and a heavier weight of care on the
grave, stern brow; but that was all to betray the anguish the proud
man was crushing back so ruthlessly on a breaking heart.</p>

<p>It was long after noon, and Egerton was about to leave his hotel
for King's Cross to return to the north, when a note was put into
his hands. He turned back into the room and opened it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Egerton,&mdash;My dream was too bright to last. She never
loved me, save as a friend. I am going abroad, and when my furlough
is up, back to my regiment in Canada. God bless you, old friend. It
will be long before we meet, if ever. LOUIS ST. JOHN."</p>

<p>The first thought of Angelo's generous heart is sorrow for
Louis' grief; his second, deep joy, for he knows that St. John may
love again, that the blow will only crush his heart, for his love
is like the sapling of a year's growth, that can bow to the gale,
and spring up again stronger than before; but Angelo's love has
grown with years, and his heart is like the strong oak that the
blast cannot bend, but breaks for ever, and he murmurs low to
himself, "Mine only now, my life, my little one&mdash;mine
only."</p>

<p>It was late at night when he reached Falcontower station, and
there, walking up and down in the moonlight, ever faithful, was
Julian watching for him, with Leon, the Spanish bloodhound, at his
side.</p>

<p>"Julian, my dear follow," said the well-known loved voice, and
Julian turned to meet Angelo, while their hands clasped in an iron
grasp that spoke more than any language could have done.</p>

<p>It was not till they reached the castle, till they found
themselves once more in the dear, gloomy old library, that either
spoke; then Julian laid his hand on Egerton's shoulder, and with
his tender blue eyes looking deep into his dark gray orbs, with
their still regretful shadow, said softly, "Angelo, was I not
right, when that night I said to you, 'You have not lost your
child-love?'"</p>

<p>"Dear Julian, right and wrong," said Egerton.</p>

<p>"I only know that she has refused him; but how do I know that
she loves, or ever can love me?"</p>

<p>"Ask her," said the artist, simply, and his beautiful eyes
smiled.</p>

<p>"No, not yet, Julian," said Egerton; "not till she is old enough
to marry at once or leave me, for either way she must do that. It
is but another six months' patience&mdash;anxious patience, Julian.
Do you not think me right?"</p>

<p>"You know best," said Julian.</p>

<p>"He wrote to me this morning," said Egerton; "it is as well I
did not meet her then or to-night. To-morrow morning I can meet her
as usual."</p>

<p>"Rest well to-night, Angelo," said Julian, "or she will detect
that all has not been well; and you look weary, oh, so weary."</p>

<p>"Can even the strongest battle through a fierce tempest and not
be weary?" said Angelo. "Good night, dear Julian. God bless you,
faithful friend!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p>Christmas has passed, and the party at Falcontower Castle has
broken up, but there have been seeds sown that will grow up and
cannot be uprooted. Parliament is sitting, and Angelo Egerton has
opened the campaign with a speech that the papers are full of, and
even those who do not like his politics are bound to admire and to
bow to the intellect that dictates it. He is there now, listening
calmly, sometimes with a quiet smile, to the attacks made on him
and his party and the ministry, by those who were clamoring for
'reform' or what they were pleased to call reform&mdash;those who
had spent the previous autumn in vainly endeavoring to stir up the
people to be discontented with what existed, and failing to rouse
them up, intended to force a certain measure on the ministry in
order to oppose it. And while Sir Angelo sits in that busy arena,
his 'child-love' sits alone by the hearth in that library in the
house in St. James' Square, with the noble pictures of the grand
old masters looking down on her.</p>

<p>Margaret is absent at Lady Alice St John's, and so Inez sits
alone, bending forwards, and now and then a slight look of pain
crosses the grave quiet brow, and she moves her hand for a second
to her chest; to her dying day she will at times feel that stiletto
wound&mdash;to her dying day she will bear that mark of Vivian's
handiwork. It changes the current of her thoughts to him and his
deeds, and her face darkens, and she lifts her eyes to the
mantelpiece, where stands a small photograph of the portrait; her
eyes have not lost that mournful shadow, nor their watchful,
sleepless look, nor will they ever utterly lose it, for the iron
has entered so deeply into her soul that even when the barb is
withdrawn, the rust will remain. But now a softer expression steals
over the young face, for her thoughts have wandered to Angelo
Egerton. She can almost hear him speaking. She knows so
well:&mdash;</p>

<p>'That style, so stately, sweet, and strong</p>

<p>That tamely read had all the charm of song.'</p>

<p>A step came along the gallery outside&mdash;not Sir Angelo's
firm, light, almost noiseless step, but that of the old servant
Burns.</p>

<p>"Miss Inez," said he, "there is a person just called wanting to
see Sir Angelo. I told him he was down at the House, and then he
said he must see the young Spanish lady, Miss de Caldara."</p>

<p>"Did he give any name? But show him up; I will see him whoever
he is," said Inez, leaning back in her arm-chair.</p>

<p>"His name is Harding, Miss Inez."</p>

<p>"Harding&mdash;I thought so. Show him up," said the Castilian,
drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>In a few moments Mr. Robert Harding, the detective, entered, a
gentlemanly, intelligent, keenly sharp-looking man, between thirty
and forty.</p>

<p>"How do you do, ma'am; I hope I see you well," he said, with a
low bow.</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you, Mr. Harding. Take a seat." Her eye went
keen and straight to his as she added, bending forwards, "Have you
come to tell me that Vivian has escaped you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," he replied.</p>

<p>She fell back again, and that sharp, momentary spasm crossed her
face. The detective noticed it.</p>

<p>"Are you in pain, Miss de Caldara?" he enquired. "Are you
ill?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she replied; "only that stiletto wound. At
distant intervals it pains me a little. Go on; tell me what you
have to tell."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, you must know that when I last wrote, two months
ago, I was sharp on his trail."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Inez, "you had tracked him to Baden Baden."</p>

<p>"Ay, right into Baden, ma'am," said Harding. "It was long before
I found any trace, and then at last I found a clue at the
passport-office in Paris. You know I had a colored photograph of
him from that portrait. I showed it, and they told me a man with
just such burnished gold looking hair (they remembered only that)
had passed through a week before for Lyons. I travelled night and
day, and entered that city a few hours after my chase. But you were
right in telling me he was cunning as a fox, and slippery as an
eel. He was gone&mdash;doubled upon me somehow, and reached Baden.
That was shortly before Christmas, and I suspect he must have come
over here; for at Baden I lost every trace of him, and was quite at
sea until a month ago, and then I received information of him
through an Englishman."</p>

<p>"An Englishman!" said Inez.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; a man with cold, sinister, snakey gray eyes, and a
down, evil look&mdash;he might have been sixty, and had been
handsome. I booked him as a villain."</p>

<p>"Do you know his name?" said Inez, quickly.</p>

<p>"Only what he said, ma'am, and that was Reynolds."</p>

<p>"It is Stephen Stanfeld," said Inez; "you know of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, though I never saw him till then. But I
suspected who he was from what he said."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," said Inez.</p>

<p>The detective glanced at the quiet face with its deep, steady
eyes, and brow of calm power, and went on.</p>

<p>"It was at a casino in Strasbourg that I met my informant. It
has always been my plan to get into conversation with any one and
every one. I noticed the Englishman at once, and soon addressed him
while he was playing. I lent him money for play, and in that manner
I won my may. Then I found out how long he had left
England&mdash;he had only recently left it. I asked him carelessly
if he had ever heard of the attempt last autumn, near a place near
Forest Moor, to murder a South American lady named Jesuita de
Castro. I saw directly by his face that he knew, before he answered
fiercely, 'Yes, by a man named Vivian&mdash;curse him!' Oh, thought
I, you hate him, my friend; very good, you may be useful. I won't
trouble you with details, ma'am. Suffice it that I found from him
that Vivian had robbed him about a month after his attempt to
murder you; that he did hate him, and would like nothing better
than to see him punished. I said I had some business to transact
with him if I could find him, which, perhaps, might not be pleasant
to him, and this man then told me that he knew Vivian had gone to
Hamburg; so to Hamburg I went, Miss de Caldara. I saw him enter a
gambling house; he gave a password, and I knew it would be useless
to go to the police there, for they play into the hands of those
who keep these hells&mdash;you'll pardon the word, ma'am; to
attempt to go in would have been worse, and so I waited and
watched. He came out late at night with a number of his companions,
and I followed him and marked the house he entered; but when later
I called there he was gone; whether he had seen me I don't know,
but he had fled and escaped me, and from that time to this I have
utterly lost him. I have also exhausted my funds, and have returned
for instructions&mdash;the chase seems almost hopeless. I came so
late, because, if I am to continue, I could catch the first Calais
or Rotterdam boat in the morning."</p>

<p>"Have you literally no clue?" asked Inez.</p>

<p>"Not the finest thread," he replied; "it is almost hopeless. It
seems to me, ma'am, merely flinging away Sir Angelo's money."</p>

<p>"It must be flung away, then," said the Castilian, rising; "he
would not have it given up if it costs a fortune. You did right to
come tonight."</p>

<p>The detective departed, and the Rotterdam boat next morning bore
him away to Holland.</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p>We must again return to Falcontower; not to the lordly castle of
the Egertons, but to the gaunt wandering old rectory, which three
centuries before had been the residence of the Catholic parish
priest; so you see it did not want age; for at the Reformation it
had been standing some two centuries, while the parish church,
which it nearly adjoined, was even older. Let us enter the rectory,
and pass into the rector's little study, which is a corner room
with two windows, one facing the sea, the other the north; from
this there was a splendid view of the castle, with its lofty falcon
tower rising on the western or sea side, from which it was said a
secret way led to the beach, by which the dungeon's beneath the
castle could be flooded. The dungeons and this tower had been first
built on the sight of a Roman camp by Ingleharde de Egerton, in the
reign of William the Norman, and it was this falcon tower that had
given its name, first to the castle and its lands, and then to the
town which very early began to grow there on the cliff.</p>

<p>Hugh Bertram, the rector of Falcontower, sat looking out towards
the castle, thinking, perhaps, that there was as grim a skeleton
within its stately walls as there was in his quiet rectory. He was
a man not yet past his prime, for he was barely fifty, and a fine
looking, stately man for even that, despite the deep lines on his
forehead, and the grayness of his still luxuriant hair, the work of
a sorrow that had well nigh broken his heart&mdash;a sorrow that
must have done so but for the deep inborn religion and faith with
which he laid his grief at the foot of the cross, and turned in
child-like faith to Him who said, "Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." And he found rest
and resignation.</p>

<p>Mr. Bertram was not long alone in his study; a light figure that
had grown familiar there since it had come to Falcontower, passed
up the garden, through the front door, only locked at night, and
entered the half open door of the study.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Walter, I am glad to see you," said the rector.
"Where have you left your friend Rothesay?"</p>

<p>"Busy in his studio, painting," replied Walter.</p>

<p>"Have you heard lately from your guardian?" asked the
rector.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is in consequence of that I came," said Walter.
"Julian and I want you to come up and spend a farewell evening with
us."</p>

<p>"What," said Mr. Bertram, "are you going abroad again?"</p>

<p>"No, oh no, to town. Julian is to stay with Egerton."</p>

<p>"And you?" interrupted Mr. Bertram.</p>

<p>"He had decided on sending me to college. Look, here is the
letter. Short, you see, as usual," said Surrey, giving him a letter
in the firm, graceful hand of Sir Angelo. And short it was.</p>

<p class="letter">"My DEAR WALTER,&mdash;I have written to Julian.
He is to stay with me. You will go to Cambridge. Come up with
Julian as I wish to see you. Do not be later than a
week.&mdash;Yours truly,<br>
<br>
A. R. EGERTON."</p>

<p>"Very like the man," said Mr. Bertram, returning the letter.
"Not a superfluous word in it. So you are to go to college
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am very glad of it," said Walter. "I want to see
more of the world, more of its phases. In his letter to Julian he
says that he wishes and purposely intends to throw me into the
world."</p>

<p>"It is a trying test and a dangerous ordeal," said the rector;
"few young men come through it quite scatheless. I know one who was
thrown on the world and he fell."</p>

<p>"I do not think I shall, sir," said Walter.</p>

<p>"Ay, Walter, Walter, be not too trustful," said the rector.
"Listen to a few words of advice from an old man who has passed
through it. You are going as a young man of means, without any
profession. You will be surrounded by temptations the most
dangerous; and if you should get into trouble, let no consideration
prevent you from applying to your guardian, Sir Angelo. He is a man
of the highest and most chivalrous honor; I grant you he is a
stern, severe man; but do not let the dread of his stern reproof or
severity prevent you going to him. Better that than sinking deeper.
Above all, remember the duty you owe to God."</p>

<p>Those were the parting words of the gentle pastor. Listen to
those the calm lips the man of the world and the gentleman
uttered&mdash;"Walter, you are launching into many temptations.
Study for a high degree. Have no idle time&mdash;it is mischievous;
never play&mdash;it is dishonorable; never bet&mdash;it is
ungentlemanly. Remember in all you do that you are a gentleman of
England, and the descendant of a line of gentlemen; and do nothing
that will cast a shadow on your unstained name."</p>

<p>Those were Sir Angelo's parting words to his ward&mdash;whether
he remembered them entirely, we shall see.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p>IT was a fine day in March. Under a huge elm, opposite to Rotten
Row, stood a man, in reality about forty, though the lightness of
his fine erect form made him look at least four years younger than
that. He was a handsome man, a very handsome man, there was no
denying that, for every feature was finely and delicately cut, and
the forehead was broad and well developed, but about the mouth
there was a marked expression of recklessness and bitter cynicism,
and in every line of the face you could see written strong, fierce,
imperious passions, that the sorrows and storms of forty years
could not tame or eradicate, hardly even teach them control. He was
standing a little back, so that he could see without being seen
from the drive, and gazed dreamily into the distance, unheeding the
few passers-by.</p>

<p>Both park and drive were empty, yet, nevertheless, the roll of
wheels struck the stranger's ear coming from one side, and the
sound of horse's feet galloping from the other. He started as he
saw a low park phaeton, containing two ladies, almost opposite to
him, and at the same moment a lady on horseback galloped up, and
wheeling suddenly, reined up her spirited Arabian.</p>

<p>"I thought I knew you, even at a distance," said the young
rider, bending down, and shaking hands with the occupant of the
phaeton. "Dear Aunt Marion, it is some time since I have seen you
and Isbel."</p>

<p>The unseen stranger bent forwards. Surely, though so changed, he
knew that dark Spanish face; he had seen a face like it&mdash;yes,
he knew now who she was by her likeness to that dark man's face he
remembered&mdash;Angelo Egerton's. Listen, that very name from Mrs.
Rochester's lips arrests his attention, and his passionate lip
quivers.</p>

<p>"Where is Angelo?" she asked. "Are you alone, Inez?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "Angelo is at the Foreign-office, and then to
the House. Tonight, you know, that bill comes on for the second
reading."</p>

<p>"Did Angelo bring it in, then?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Inez, laughing; "he never brings in home
measures."</p>

<p>"But he'll speak," said Marion. "I wish I could go and hear
him."</p>

<p>"It will be a sight," returned Inez. "I have a Speaker's order
for the out-of-the-way little place aloft where they
admit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only a few of 'our choicest spirits,'" interposed Isbel,
quoting from 'Martin Chuzzlewit.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Rochester smiled, but again addressed Inez. "Will
Government be defeated?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" said Inez. "I am afraid they will, but if they
are, they will not be long out."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems a weary game and weary struggle," said Marion.
"Where are Mr. Rothesay and Miss Arundel?"</p>

<p>"Julian is at home, and Margaret is at Herne Bay," replied
Inez.</p>

<p>"Tell the Signor Giulio to come and spend the evening with us,"
said Marion "I want to speak to him about taking Isbel's
portrait."</p>

<p>"I will tell him&mdash;good-bye," and Inez de Caldara rode away,
followed by her groom.</p>

<p>Marion Rochester leaned back with a heavy, weary sigh. "Drive
home, my daughter," she said.</p>

<p>"Home, mamma?" said Isbel.</p>

<p>"My heart is not as bright as the day is, Isbel," said Mrs.
Rochester in French, and Isbel drove on.</p>

<p>The stranger stepped forwards and stood looking after them.</p>

<p>"And is that fair woman my wife?&mdash;is that beautiful girl my
daughter?" he murmured; "and I have left them both all these years.
Yes, and will leave them!" and now the recklessness and passion
returned to the lip and eye: "for they both hate me&mdash;my
daughter, too, as her mother did before her; and how can I love
Marion, when my heart is in Mina's grave&mdash;and she&mdash;what
heart she had was buried with her first husband when she vowed her
love to me with her false lips. All womankind is alike&mdash;all
fair and false&mdash;all fair and false!" said the cynic, turning
away with a sardonic curl of his lips. He moved some paces amongst
the trees with downcast eyes, not seeing a man approaching till a
shadow fell across him, and he turned sharply to confront Stephen
Stanfeld.</p>

<p>Austin Rochester recoiled some steps, and Stanfeld stood as one
struck dumb. In that momentous but dead silence you might have
heard a pin fall. It was broken by Austin.</p>

<p>"So," he said, with so fierce a gesture and accent that the
other shrunk back, "it is thus we meet after eighteen years,
Stephen Stanfeld. Villain! you escaped me once; but now I will
speak. You shall hear me, or I will shoot you as you fly."</p>

<p>There was something actually terrible in the frightful intensity
of hatred and fierce passions in his face as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Nineteen years ago," he resumed, "you crossed my path. I have
reason to hate you. You, who won a young girl's heart with your
fiendish arts, and then deserted her because she lost her fortune.
You, who waited until she was a wife and about to be a mother, and
then dared to upbraid and curse the woman who had loved you to her
own misery. You, who killed her and one child, and laid her own
hatred to me on the other. Deeply you have injured me and mine.
Murderer, coward, villain! If there is a God in heaven, I call down
his heaviest curse on your head, that it may rest on you till your
dying hour! I tell you that if your last chance of life hung on my
forgiveness, I would sooner cast myself body and soul into hell
than give it."</p>

<p>Staggered by the frightful words, Stanfeld shrunk and shivered
as if they blasted him, and glided away amongst the trees, but
followed even there by the mocking, scornful laughter of his
opponent, who stood long there with heart and brain feeling as a
forest might feel after a hurricane had swept through it. And while
he stands there, let us tell some of his history&mdash;the worst
his own lips must tell another time.</p>

<p>He was the second son of a gentleman of old family and property
not twenty miles from Falcontower. All his father's affections had
centered in his oldest son, Wilmot; his wife, whom he had
passionately loved, had died in giving birth to Austin, and, in
consequence, an unnatural hatred to the child took possession of
him. Of course Wilmot and the very servants took their tone from
him, and the child grew up in an atmosphere of dislike.
Unfortunately, too, every fibre of the boy's nature seemed
antagonistic to those about him; every bad passion was fostered to
an alarming degree, and the good in him was crushed with a ruthless
and cruel hand.</p>

<p>He was passionate even to fierceness, and revengeful, and
high-spirited, and he soon rebelled at the treatment he received,
and finally his father sent him to a boarding school as being
utterly irreclaimable. But there it was the same. Talented in no
ordinary degree, he learned readily, but by the boys he was soon
hated and detested. Nature had given him a yearning for affections,
and those powers of love and hate which are too often man's
curse&mdash;and they were his; it had also given him a really true
nature, but there was not one who could penetrate beneath all the
evil and reach the good.</p>

<p>From that school he went to Eton; he was then seventeen, and he
was there twelve months; and then, in that short time, when it was
too late, he came across one who, if he had met a few years
earlier, might have saved him. A boy of but fifteen, by name Angelo
Egerton,&mdash;and he by some strange, almost mystic knowledge it
seemed, at once read Rochester's character,&mdash;penetrated at
once the cold cynicism, the morose bitterness, and reached the fine
nature beneath it.</p>

<p>But the time was too short, and came too late, as young Egerton
saw; the evil had been sown too early, and gone too deep; twelve
months could not undo the evils of seventeen years.
Unscrupulousness had become part of his nature, recklessness a
second nature; and when, at the end of twelve months, his removal
to college parted him from young Egerton, he flung himself into a
wild set, and plunged recklessly into dissipations to drown
thoughts and bitter achings of heart that were intolerable; denied
all affections where he had a right to look for them, disliked by
the very men of whose wild life he was the companion, he sank
deeper and deeper. He was barely nineteen when his father died,
leaving, of course, to Wilmot the estates, to Austin&mdash;deep in
debt&mdash;one thousand pounds&mdash;cast on the world at
nineteen.</p>

<p>Utterly in extremity, the memory of Egerton's dark face and
musical voice, never quite forgotten, rose vividly to his mind, for
he was the only being who had ever cared at all for him, and he
wrote to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You once showed me kindness, Egerton. Pardon me if I ask one
thing. I am going abroad. I wish none to know where. Suffer me to
make you my only repository and medium of any communication to me.
I ask it as a favor, and to keep it secret.</p>

<p>"AUSTIN ROCHESTER."</p>

<p>Egerton wrote back instantly, for he had felt deeply interested
in Rochester; and though he had lost sight of him, he had never
forgotten him; and now he returned for answer that he should be
glad if he could be of any service to him. He received back a
letter of many thanks, and an address in Paris.</p>

<p>Then Austin Rochester, evading his creditors, went abroad, not
deigning a line even to his brother Wilmot.</p>

<p>This Wilmot, it may be imagined, was no saint; and though, at
his father's death, he came into an estate worth fifty thousand
pounds, yet in one year he had mortgaged it to half that, and then
he managed to get killed in a low quarrel. Egerton immediately
wrote to Austin, merely telling him that Wilmot was dead, and had
left his affairs much embarrassed.</p>

<p>Austin came over immediately, and certainly then for once acted
wisely. He went to Egerton, and saying plainly that he was
literally the only being in the world he could turn to, told him
his whole story, and asked his advice; and Angelo, though his
chivalrous nature recoiled and shrunk from the vice, saw much to
palliate; and pitying the man, held out to him the helping hand,
and not only gave him advice, but assisted him to follow it
out.</p>

<p>Wilmot's debts were twenty-five thousand pounds, his own ten
thousand pounds, and he raised on the estate thirty-five thousand,
and paid everything, thus leaving himself six hundred a year. He
shut up Rochester Court, left only an old steward on the place, and
again vanished abroad, this time not even telling Egerton where he
went; and for nearly ten years neither Angelo nor anybody else knew
whether he was dead or alive.</p>

<p>But during Angelo's absence in Spain, when he went over for
Inez, Austin Rochester suddenly appeared in England with a little
daughter of seven years or so. He called at St. James' Square to
see Egerton, and saw his mother instead; and on learning that he
had been at Eton with her son, she invited him to the house, and it
was there that he and Marion D'Arcy met, for Julian had gone with
Angelo, and she was staying with Lady Egerton. Thus it came about
that the first thing Angelo heard on returning was that Marion was
going to marry Rochester.</p>

<p>It was too late to do anything to prevent it; but Egerton, as
trustee to the fortune Colonel D'Arcy had left his widow, did what
he could for her, knowing what Austin was, suspecting his motives
in marrying to be those of a desperate and unscrupulous man; he
settled every shilling on Marion and her children in the usual
manner&mdash;it was too late for Austin to draw back, the more so
as he had represented the mortgage on his estate as nearly
redeemed, when, in fact, it had only changed from its original
mortgagee to a money-lender named Isaac Fakes&mdash;and Angelo
Egerton, with a heavy heart and gloomy forebodings, for the second
time gave Marion away at the altar.</p>

<p>Too soon the truth appeared&mdash;too soon the end came. There
was a miserable six months of passive neglect and gloomy coldness,
and then, one dreadful day, he told her that he had never loved any
but Isbel's mother, his dead wife; that neither she nor any human
being had or could love him&mdash;and so left her and his child and
went no one know where, and they had never met since.</p>

<p>All that remains we leave for him to tell; but there he stood
alone&mdash;desolate, broken-hearted, remorseful, and yet through
all a desperate and reckless man.</p>

<p>This is one sad story of a lost life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29.</h2>

<p>Angelo Egerton and Julian Rothesay sat alone together, for Inez
and Margaret were out riding.</p>

<p>The artist was sitting at a table with drawing paper before him
and a pencil in his hand, half dreamily sketching something, his
beautiful head bent a little down, so that the dark, golden brown
hair fell partly over the noble brow. The ex-minister sat in his
old oak reading chair, with a volume of some ancient Italian
political lore in his hand, but with his dark, calm, gray eyes
fixed quietly on Julian's face, reading it as only he could, like
an open book of very sweet music. He knew as well as possible what
was passing in his heart and brain at that moment; then who he was
dreaming of, and whose gentle face was gradually looking out of
that blank sheet; and he rose and bent over him, saying, "What are
you drawing there?" But the artist laid his hand quickly over
it.</p>

<p>"Dear Julian," said Egerton, in his soft, low voice, "do you
think I have not learned to read your face in twenty years? Long
ago I knew you loved her."</p>

<p>"Angelo!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Egerton, leaning against the mantelpiece, and looking
down on him with that rare tender smile in eyes and mouth, "I knew
it long ago. That day at Falcontower, when we stood together on the
ramparts, when you evaded my question, I knew then that you had
found your ideal, and would learn to love her; and Isbel is worthy
of even you."</p>

<p>"Even me!" said Julian, with bitter force. "And can I suffer one
word to her to pass my lips while I have the brand of murder on my
head? Can I offer the woman I love a stained name? No; it is
hopeless. There is a curse on me."</p>

<p>"Julian, Julian! I cannot bear to hear you speak so!" said
Egerton passionately. "Nothing is hopeless while there is
life."</p>

<p>"Angelo, I was wrong to speak as I did," said Julian; "but would
you have me try to win her heart with such a stain upon my name?
Put it to your own chivalrous honor, severely, without reference to
your love for me, and then answer."</p>

<p>Egerton paused for a moment before he answered; and then he
said, "I answer you in a conviction that is something deeper than
mere fancy or hope, that you will before very long be cleared to
the world; and to the old and honored name of D'Arcy, add the fame
you have given to that of Rothesay. In that conviction, that is
knowledge, I say to you, go and tell her all, conceal nothing, and
if she loves you she will believe you innocent. Do not, if you
will, marry her till you can do so in your own name."</p>

<p>"Angelo, if she does not believe me innocent&mdash;if she does
not love me?" said Julian, rising.</p>

<p>"It is more the pomp of death, than death itself which is
terrible," answered Egerton; "have you not a real enough skeleton
without raising an imaginary terror as well?"</p>

<p>Julian smiled, and left the room, and Egerton, too restless now
to remain still, ordered his horse and rode out to meet Inez and
Margaret.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A month had passed since Austin Rochester had seen his
deeply-wronged wife and child, but he could not forget either; and
while he utterly shrank from meeting his wife, he longed with
almost sickening longing to see the daughter he had deserted, the
child and living likeness of a wife who, however false in heart to
him, he had worshipped. He must and would see her when he had
ascertained that Marion was out. To find where she lived was easy,
by means of a directory; her house was in Seymour-street, not far
from that occupied by Lady Alice St. John, and for days he lingered
there, watching, till at last one day he saw his wife go out in
that same park phaeton without Isbel. He stood watching the
carriage till it turned the corner, and then he crossed over and
knocked.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Rochester at home?" he asked of the servant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the man, evidently expecting a card, but
none was offered.</p>

<p>"Ask Miss Rochester if she can spare a short time to a gentleman
who wishes to see her."</p>

<p>The servant showed him up to the drawing-room, and then crossed
the corridor to Mrs. Rochester's boudoir, which was opposite, and
where Isbel sat.</p>

<p>"Miss Isbel, there is a gentleman wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"Who is he, George?&mdash;are you sure it isn't mamma he
wants?"</p>

<p>"No, miss; he asked for you, but gave no name."</p>

<p>"I will see him of course," said Isbel.</p>

<p>The servant retired, and Isbel wondering a little, rose, and
leaving the boudoir door open, opened the drawing-room door and
entered.</p>

<p>Full in the light of the windows stood Austin, and something in
his form and face struck Isbel as vaguely as having something not
utterly strange; she had not the almost supernatural memory of
Inez, or she would have recognised him.</p>

<p>Rochester advanced a step, and then paused, chilled to the heart
to see her cold bow, and forgetting that she had not seen him since
early childhood, and that he was changed, and into his cynical
heart rushed afresh the thought long there that Marion had taught
her to hate and scorn him, and then from his cynical lips came the
bitter words, "So, then, your false-hearted stepmother has taught
you well, I see, to follow in your dead mother's steps!"</p>

<p>The indignant blood flushed crimson to the girl's cheek and
brow; the passionate blood of her father ran red in her veins then
as she laid her hand on the bell.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir," she said, "that dare to come here and insult
my mother?"</p>

<p>Rochester's passionate and imperious temper was roused. He
grasped her hand with a force that left her powerless, and said,
"Her husband, girl, and your father!"</p>

<p>Isbel turned very white, and with a loud cry recoiled from him
as if his touch stung her.</p>

<p>"You do well," she said, with quivering lips, "to make your
first words a falsehood on my gentle mother. Do you come back,
after all these years, for that?"</p>

<p>"Isbel, Isbel!" said he, "is it thus a child should meet her
father? Does it not confirm me in what I say, that Marion is false
to me, and has taught my child to hate me as a black villain?"</p>

<p>"It is false," exclaimed Isbel, passionately; "She never speaks
of you. Oh, father, father! how can you speak so of her?" And
hiding her face in the cushions of the couch, the poor child burst
into tears.</p>

<p>Rochester stood, looking gloomily down on her, seeing, feeling
through nothing but the dark glass that like a black pall hung ever
between him and his better nature.</p>

<p>"Ay," said he, "weep on. Women have always tears for everything;
but they are in vain with me."</p>

<p>He turned away. She heard the door close on him, and covering
her face, she sobbed with an agony that shook every nerve of her
slender frame.</p>

<p>"Miss Rochester!&mdash;Isbel!"</p>

<p>That soft, gentle voice!&mdash;it thrilled to her very soul, and
she lifted her head to see Julian Rothesay bending over her.</p>

<p>"I can bear anything but to see you in such distress," he said.
"Surely, Isbel, I love you too well not to grieve when you
grieve."</p>

<p>He sat down by her, and wound his arm about her, and with all
the innocent love of her young, pure heart, she laid her head on
his heart, and the tears she wept were not all sorrowful. There was
no language needed. "Look up, darling, and listen to me," Julian
whispered, presently&mdash;"I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>"What is it, Julian?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My name is not Rothesay," he replied. "I am a man who has fled
from prison to escape the law, who has been an exile nine years,
for the brand of murder on his name. I want you to hear my
story."</p>

<p>"You need not tell me your story, Julian, till I am your
wife."</p>

<p>"God bless you, my own Isbel!" said Julian, pressing a kiss on
the sweet upturned face, "but I cannot take you from a honored to a
dishonored name. I am Julian D'Arcy, the step-son of Marion, so
long and still believed dead, because under the name of Doria I was
accused of the murder of Angelo Egerton's mother."</p>

<p>"Mamma's son, that she loved so! Are you that Julian? Oh, I am
so glad. How could anyone accuse you?" said Isbel, sweeping back
the hair from his forehead, "how could they?"</p>

<p>"Isbel, you must listen to my story now."</p>

<p>"Julian, if an angel told me you were guilty I should not
believe it."</p>

<p>"I know that, dear Isbel; but for my own honor's sake you must
know it now."</p>

<p>"Then tell me all, Julian, your honor is to me as my own."</p>

<p>Meekly folding her little hands on her lap, Isbel sat perfectly
still to listen, never interrupting him by any exclamation or
remark. What his story was we must reserve for the present, to tell
what more immediately happened.</p>

<p>When Austin Rochester left the drawing-room he paused for a
second, and then turned into the boudoir and closed the door, with
the intention of writing a last letter to the wife and and daughter
he firmly believed hated him, and never could do anything else. A
writing desk was open on a side table, and the initials on it, M.
R., told him it was his wife's. With the intention of finding
writing paper, he lifted the inner lid, but the first thing that
met his eye were the words "Dear Julian," in her well known hand.
For a moment he hesitated, and then muttering fiercely, "I have a
right to know who she addresses so familiarly," grasped the letter
and read it. It bore date some days before, and seemed not to have
been sent. Here are the lines, simple enough to us:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Julian,&mdash;I just write these few words
in haste to ask you to come round this evening; and as Isbel is
going to Lady Alice's, we shall be alone to talk of old
times.&mdash;Yours affectionately,<br>
<br>
MARION."</p>

<p>Rochester's first impulse was to tear it into a thousand pieces,
and trample it under his feet, but for once controlling passions
that were little used to it, he merely kept it in his hand, though
he ground his teeth and clenched his hands in his fierce passion.
He would wait now and see her, and know of her what that letter
meant. So a dreadful half hour passed; and then at last the step he
watched and waited for came up from the hall, along the gallery,
and paused outside. The next moment the door opened, and the
husband and wife, who had not met for eight years, were
confronted.</p>

<p>There was a silence so intense that you could hear it hum and
murmur, and then Marion took a step towards him with outstretched
arms, "Austin, my husband!"</p>

<p>Rochester drew back, and said sternly, "Stand back, and do not
touch me!"</p>

<p>Marion stopped. "Austin, Austin! you told me once that you loved
me," she said, plaintively.</p>

<p>"You told me once that you loved me!" he answered, fiercely,
"and yet I find this letter," and he flung it at her feet. "Who is
Julian?"</p>

<p>Marion staggered back with a sudden sharp cry, and then stood as
if a thunderbolt had fallen at her feet. She saw his meaning; that
her silence must inevitably make an irreparable breach between
them. And yet how could she betray her son? place him in the power
of the man whom bitter experience had taught her was so reckless
and unscrupulous? No; she could suffer for her son, but she could
not place him in danger; and she only bowed her head and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Answer me, Mrs. Rochester!" he exclaimed; "for, by heaven, I
will know. I have a right to demand it. Who's this Julian?"</p>

<p>"Her son!" said a deep voice, and Julian's tall figure stood
between his mother and Rochester. "Silence, mother; my safety
cannot weigh for a moment against your fair name, and while I live
no man shall dare to cast the faintest shadow on that. Shame to
you, Austin Rochester&mdash;shame to you, that I, her step-son, and
the future husband of her child, should stand here her protector,
where you should stand!"</p>

<p>Rochester's passion literally held him silent for a minute, and
then he burst forth.</p>

<p>"Husband of my daughter? No, never! Why has Julian D'Arcy passed
for dead, and really lived in secret, unless you have a crime on
your head?"</p>

<p>Julian moved a few steps forward, and said, calmly, "Listen to
me, Mr. Rochester (and neither Marion nor Isbel interrupt me). I
throw myself on your honor not to betray me. You may remember the
murder of Lady Egerton, and the arrest, trial, and conviction of a
man named Giulio Doria for the murder. I was that man. I escaped;
for the evidence on the trial would have blasted my name, even if
legally acquitted."</p>

<p>"Why were you in that disguise?" demanded Austin. "I remember
the evidence, and I believed Doria guilty the more for his flight.
Why were you so disguised?"</p>

<p>"There my lips are sealed," said Julian. "But one day my name
will be cleared."</p>

<p>"When it is, you shall have my daughter," said Rochester, with
his cynical sneer&mdash;"not before."</p>

<p>"I do not wish it till then," said Rothesay, quietly. "I would
not marry her with a stain on my name."</p>

<p>"It shall never be at all," said Rochester, with a fierce,
imperious gesture. "You shall never call her wife, now nor
ever."</p>

<p>Till now, Isbel had stood by the door without speaking; but at
the last words she deliberately and quietly walked across the floor
to where Julian stood, and putting one hand on his arm, locked the
other in it.</p>

<p>"To this man, Julian D'Arcy," she said, "I have given my love,
and pledged my hand, knowing him to be under the black imputation
of murder he is guiltless of. To the world his name is blasted, but
to me he is pure; and I will not wait until he is prosperous, and
held fair in men's eyes, to become his wife. I will marry him while
he is under this dark cloud of wrong and danger. I solemnly swear I
will marry him now or never," she said, raising her eyes upward
with a strange, steady light in their blue depths.</p>

<p>"Isbel," exclaimed Julian, trying hurriedly to unclasp her
hands, "unsay your words! It cannot be&mdash;it cannot be, till my
name is cleared of this foul stain."</p>

<p>"Julian, I have spoken, and nothing can turn me. I have sworn
before heaven, and dare not, if I would, break so solemn an oath.
Take me now to share your darkened name and lost life, or in this
room we part for ever."</p>

<p>Julian looked for one moment in her face, reading her very soul,
then he drew her to him with his strong sheltering arm, and turned
to her father.</p>

<p>"You have heard her noble words," said Julian; "and I accept the
gift as heaven-sent, for her love is holy. I take her to share my
darkened name and lost life, to be in weal or woe my honored wife,
and thus I seal it in your presence." And bending down he touched
his lips to her brow and lips.</p>

<p>"By heaven, this is too much!" exclaimed Rochester, stamping his
foot. "Unhand my daughter, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>With all his wild, ungoverned passions in his black eyes, and
clenched, half-upraised hand, he stepped forward, but his wife
threw herself between them. "Stand back!" she said; "he is my
son."</p>

<p>"Ha! do you, too, band with him and that girl against your
husband? Hear me, Julian D'Arcy. Whenever and wherever you attempt
to marry my daughter, I will be there to forbid the marriage."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to do your worst," answered Julian, with a
haughty smile; "it is too late now to claim any right to the child
you have so long deserted. Isbel, leave the room."</p>

<p>She glided away without a word. Then all Rochester's fury burst
on the head of the beautiful woman who now knelt at his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Austin, my husband, have mercy!" she cried. "Is it not
enough that you have broken the heart that loves you too well?"</p>

<p>"And do you think to win me back by taking part with this red
handed son of yours&mdash;" he was beginning, when Julian
interposed.</p>

<p>"When you remember," he said, raising his mother, and throwing
his arm around her, "that she is a woman and your wife, you may see
her, but not till then." And he drew her from the room.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>One soft April morning there was a quiet group in the ancient
Gothic church at the Holy Cross in Falcontower. Before the altar
knelt Julian D'Arcy and Isbel Rochester; near them stood Egerton
and Inez and Marion. And as they were married by Hugh Bertram,
secretly, and the marriage of Julian D'Arcy, of Friar's Lea, and
Isbel Rochester was registered in the huge old vellum, iron clamped
book that recorded the marriages of all the Egertons of
Falcontower.</p>

<p>Two days after Austin Rochester read the following
announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.&mdash;We have to announce the marriage
at St George's, Hanover Square, of the young and celebrated artist,
Julian Rothesay, to Isbel Nina, only daughter of Austin Rochester,
Esq., of Rochester Court. The fair bride was given away by Sir
Angelo Egerton, M.P., and was attended by two bridesmaids, Miss de
Caldara and Mademoiselle de Castelnau, and the beautiful Mrs.
Rochester, mother of the bride. The breakfast was given at the
splendid mansion of Sir Angelo Egerton. The party was small and
select."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p>"Inez," said Egerton, one morning, "how long is it since Walter
Surrey wrote?"</p>

<p>"A long time," she replied.</p>

<p>"It is more than a month, I think," said Margaret.</p>

<p>Inez turned her grave quiet face to Egerton and said in Spanish,
"What is it you fear, Angelo?"</p>

<p>"That he has got into a racing and betting set," was the reply;
"for a long time his letters have been short and to me
unsatisfactory. I am afraid he is getting into trouble, and is
ashamed to write."</p>

<p>"Surely, Angelo, brought up as he has been, he would not yield
to temptation," said Inez.</p>

<p>"The temptations are very great," replied Angelo. "It is so easy
to say to a young man 'take my bet for once,' and once done it is
so easily repeated. More than all, it is so very hard to withstand
the derisive sneer and mocking word, and Walter is peculiarly
sensitive to ridicule."</p>

<p>Inez's answer was interrupted by the entrance of a servant with
letters that had just come by the post. There were one or two for
Margaret and Inez, and a number for Egerton, but he put all aside
for one large foreign looking one with the postmark of Lyons on
it.</p>

<p>"News at last from Robert Harding," said Angelo. There was a
short silence while he read. "Listen," said he, "I will read aloud
the letter from the detective:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Sir,&mdash;I write, as you see, from Lyons,
where most unfortunately at this moment I am detained, having had
the ill fate to be the witness to a murder, by a young man, who
appointed a meeting with a lady who had declined his hand, and then
shot her deliberately, because she had again refused to marry him.
Nothing could be more unfortunate than my detention now, for I had
just discovered positive information of my chase, and was on the
point of sailing in pursuit. This is the information; he is in
Naples, disguised as an Italian, and the companion of a gang of men
who are disaffected toward the Neapolitan Government. I suspect,
nothing less than conspirators. Every hour is of importance; and if
you, sir, could go yourself to Naples, you might prevent him again
slipping through our fingers.&mdash;I remain, sir, your obedient
servant,<br>
<br>
ROBERT HARDING."</p>

<p>"Margaret, will you ring the bell," said Egerton; and when the
servant appeared, he ordered his horse round directly, and then
rose.</p>

<p>"Inez," said he, "I am going to see at what hour to-morrow any
vessel leaves Dover for the continent, and take my passage. I shall
then settle some indispensible things, and call, as I return, at
Seymour-street, to ask Marion to let you stay with her during my
indefinite absence, for I don't like leaving you two young girls
alone here."</p>

<p>"I am glad Julian and Isbel are still in Germany," said the
Castilian; "it will save them much anxiety, and perhaps
disappointment."</p>

<p>Egerton answered "Yes," and went out.</p>

<p>It was late when he returned, and then he went to his library,
though he joined them in the evening in the drawing-room, but there
seemed a gloom upon them, as if all that was to happen before they
met again had cast its shadow on them; the very dog Leon was
restless and uneasy, and kept walking about or coming to Egerton or
Inez and whining.</p>

<p>As 10 o'clock struck, Margaret Arundel, thinking that Egerton
must have business directions to give his ward, bade them good
night, and retired.</p>

<p>Egerton rose, and leaning lightly against the mantelpiece, said,
"Inez, lay aside 'Montaigne's Essays,' and attend to me."</p>

<p>"Always obedient to your grace's will. I come to know your
pleasure," said the Spaniard, dropping the book with a faint smile,
that died away directly. "What is it, Angelo?"</p>

<p>"I want to give you one or two directions, as I do not know how
long I may be away," replied Angelo. "I need not, I think, say that
I wish no one to know where or why I am gone. Whatever letters come
for me you must open, and answer to the best of your ability."</p>

<p>"You don't mean your private letters from friends?" said
Inez.</p>

<p>"I have no friends to receive such letters from," he replied,
"save Julian&mdash;nothing that you might not see in such a case as
my absence. Better that than that they should remain unanswered
when perhaps they need it."</p>

<p>"I will do as you wish, Angelo," said Inez.</p>

<p>"Then to-morrow write to Harding, enclosing him the banknotes
you will find in that little drawer in my desk, and tell him to
come home, and to let you see him when he arrives. Reward him
handsomely, as I know you will, and dismiss him for the present;
but tell him it is possible we may again require his services. For
you, I have informed my bankers that your cheques are to be honored
as my own."</p>

<p>"Angelo," said the Castilian, rising up with an almost terrified
look in her face, "you speak and act as if you were never coming
back."</p>

<p>"Life is uncertain," said Angelo, "I may die in Italy or be
killed."</p>

<p>She turned hastily aside but he saw her chest heave, and a heavy
tear glitter in the dark eye, and fall. There was silence for a few
minutes, and then Egerton stretched out his arm, and drew her to
him, and like some soft music his low, gentle voice broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>"Long ago I received you from the priest Alvarez. You were quite
a little child when he put you into my arms, and said, 'Take this
child, and love and guard her as a priceless treasure.' I have done
so; to no one else have I entrusted the treasure given me; my own
hand and brain has trained my little one. You were so like my
mother, Inez, that my heart soon loved the little motherless
infant; how much more when her terrible death bound us
two&mdash;the man and the child&mdash;so close together by the tie
of common suffering and sorrow. I have brought you up entirely; of
me you have learnt; you have been my companion in joy and sorrow,
in trouble or prosperity; together we have travelled; in all and
everything you have been my better angel, round whom every fibre of
my nature has twined like my very life itself. Oh, Inez, life
without you were dark indeed. I have more than kept my pledge. As a
treasure, priceless indeed, I have guarded you, and heaven knows
how I love you."</p>

<p>Angelo Egerton turned and opened his arms to clasp the young
Inez close to the heart that had loved her so long and so
faithfully. It was long before either broke the silence, and then,
without lifting her head from his breast, she whispered softly in
the touching language of Scripture, "Whither thou goest I will go;
where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried."</p>

<p>"My little one&mdash;my own darling!" said Egerton. "Ah, Inez,
once I thought that I had lost my child-love, and the years that
lay before me seemed a dreary waste of time."</p>

<p>She nestled closer to him, and the little slender fingers wound
clingingly round his hand; for she knew when and what he meant; but
presently she said, "Strange that while I could read others so
well, I read my own heart so little. Till now I knew not how I
loved you. Since that day in Madrid, that you took me from the
priest and called me your little Spanish olive, it grew in my
heart; but till now I knew not how deeply and closely it had grown
with my growth&mdash;grown part of my life and being, and been the
motive and secret mainspring of nearly all my thoughts and feelings
and actions."</p>

<p>"Truly, indeed, my gentle Inez," said Egerton, "have you proved
the truth of your motto&mdash;'Love conquers all.'" And, bending
down, he pressed a first holy kiss on her lips.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p>Was Angelo Egerton justified in his fears about Walter Surrey?
Look into his sitting-room one evening about a month or five weeks
after Egerton's secret departure from England, and we shall see
whether or no his fears were well founded.</p>

<p>There at the table sat Julian's ex-pupil, bending over a book
which we have no difficulty in recognising as a private note-book,
not a betting book, it had not come to that yet; but there were
some ugly looking array of figures and entries of bets, and certain
ominous bills coming due shortly, and in the hands of Isaac Fakes,
the usurer.</p>

<p>He sat a long time bending over the book with an aching head and
throbbing brow, and worse than all, with an aching heart too, for
the stern dark face of Egerton, or even Julian's gentler
countenance, were not the only ones in his memory; it was a yet
softer, gentler one than either. It was the face and memory of
Theresa Stanfeld that was in the boy's mind and heart, and while
that young heart could worship a fine woman, and feel shame and
remorse because he had done, though under sore temptation, that
which she would weep for, or perhaps turn from in scorn&mdash;while
he could still feel all this, be so acutely alive to his
folly&mdash;it wanted but a slender hand to lift him out, a hand
firm and gentle, as Angelo's was, for all Walter's idea of its
extreme severity.</p>

<p>Still his thoughts as he sat there were sad enough; he had on
coming to college been taken especially in hand by a young man of
large fortune, but somewhat wild habits. He was fond of the turf
and betting on races, and it is easy to see how Walter, young, by
nature trusting, and practically inexperienced in the world, was
induced by his friend and his companions to bet, and then in order
to clear these debts of honor to accept the assistance of Isaac
Fakes, the money-lender, who pursued business at Cambridge as well
as in London.</p>

<p>Thus it happened and so it was that Isaac Fakes held Walter's
bills, due in three days, for one thousand pounds, and how to meet
them he had no idea.</p>

<p>"Fool! weak fool that I have been!" muttered the young man. "And
now, how shall I clear myself? How could I ever let Trelawney draw
me into this vortex? It is my first hard lesson. Will Fakes renew
them again? and if he will, it is only sinking deeper and deeper;
for it must come at last. Egerton is no lax trustee, and when I
come of age must and will know it."</p>

<p>He rose, and began pacing restlessly too and fro. Every feeling
of honor and delicacy prevented him writing to Julian; for Julian
could not assist him, save out of his own pocket, and naturally
Walter shrank from incurring an obligation where he had no claim,
and believing, as he did, that Rothesay had nothing but his
profession. Worse still to ask, or even allow, Julian to act as
mediator between himself and Egerton, for that would irretrievably
sink him in the estimation of both.</p>

<p>Then, again, came the question of how to free himself from the
debt which hung like a load on him, though Trelawney and his
companions would have laughed at the idea of "such a fuss about a
paltry thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Why was it that he so shrank from simply applying to his
guardian? It was partly that he was ashamed to do so, partly that,
despite the words of Mr. Bertram, he unconsciously exaggerated and
dreaded Egerton's sternness and severity on all points where
anything jarred on his own sensitive, chivalrous honor; but there,
as we know, he misunderstood Angelo. Then he shrank, too, from the
mere asking for an advance from Egerton, knowing that being still
under age, he could give no security, and that even if he could,
Angelo would not take it.</p>

<p>In the midst of this miserable doubt and uncertainty there came
a knock at the door, and almost before Surrey could say, "Come in,"
the unknown entered. It was Isaac Fakes.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Surrey," he said, in his smooth, half-languid
manner; and do not imagine him a vulgar, dirty looking follow, who
bore 'usurer' on his face; rather imagine a particularly clean,
respectable looking man, with good though large features, and sharp
eyes, bright and cold, and hard at steel. "Good evening, Mr.
Surrey. I ask pardon for intruding on you, but can you spare me a
few moments?"</p>

<p>"I can; sit down, Mr. Fakes," returned Walter, in a cold,
haughty manner.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;no. I only wished to ask, to express a hope,
that you will not fail to meet the bills due three days hence."</p>

<p>"So far from being ready, I must ask you to renew them," replied
Walter. "I only want five months to my majority."</p>

<p>"I cannot do it, Mr. Surrey," said Fakes, and all the assumed
languor was gone, though he spoke politely, "it isn't because I
mistrust your honor. When I lent you the money on these bills, I
did it knowing you could not legally give them; but I knew you, and
knew your honor was my bond. It is my trade to know my clients. But
I assure you"&mdash;and for once the man spoke the
truth&mdash;"that this money is important to me to complete a
purchase I cannot delay. I am sorry I cannot oblige you, but I must
have the money. Your guardian will surely advance you the
money."</p>

<p>A fierce answer was on Walter's lips, but he crushed it, and
said, haughtily, "Keep to your own affairs, Mr. Fakes, and do not
meddle with mine, so that you have your money. Sorry, indeed, am I
that I ever was mad enough to incur the debt; but what is written
is written. Those bills are due on Friday, you say; on Friday I
will be with you and close our accounts. Good evening." And he
fairly dismissed the money-lender.</p>

<p>But now his mind was made up&mdash;he must write to Egerton, and
throw himself, as it were, on his mercy. There was nothing else to
do; or, if there was, it would but make the reckoning that must
come thrice as bad.</p>

<p>Having once decided upon a line of action, he followed it out
with promptitude, and sitting down, he wrote at once to Egerton,
telling him all from beginning to end, not even concealing the
reasons why he had not from the very first applied to his guardian
instead of a money-lender. Once writing, the truthful candour of
his nature made him write everything.</p>

<p>The letter reached the house in St James' Square by the next
day's post, and, according to orders, the old servant Burns
immediately sent it on to his young mistress in Seymour-street.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rochester had gone out shopping, and taken Margaret with
her, so that Inez de Caldara was alone when Walter's letter was
given her.</p>

<p>Though Angelo had expressly told her to open all his letters,
and though he had repeated it the morning of his departure, it was
always with a sort of feeling of doing something wrong that she
obeyed.</p>

<p>She knew Walter's handwriting at once; she could see that it was
a thicker letter than he had written for a long time, and
remembering the fears Angelo had expressed about him, a less acute
mind than hers would have guessed pretty near the truth, and she
did.</p>

<p>What should she do? Angelo had been gone nearly five weeks, but
she had not heard from him, and did not know where he was. Should
she simply return the letter, and say that Egerton was absent; but
then, if Walter had got into trouble, and was asking for advice or
assistance, would not such a reply drive him into the hands of the
money-lenders? Would it not be better to open it according to
Angelo's wish, nay, orders, and see what it really was, and if she
could, assist him as much as possible, as Egerton would have
done.</p>

<p>Inez was not one to remain long uncertain in anything, as we
have seen, and though her position was anything but pleasant, she
opened the letter and read it, and glad indeed was she that she had
done so when she found what it contained.</p>

<p>Prompt to think as to act, she at once determined to do what she
knew Egerton would have done&mdash;send the money immediately. The
first thing was to get it, and she rang, ordered her horse round,
and her old groom Wilde to attend her, drew a cheque for twelve
hundred pounds, and fearful of being after banking hours, rode at
once to the bankers, and was home again before half-past 4,
somewhat warm for a fast ride on a June afternoon.</p>

<p>Then she wrote to Walter explaining her position. She said that
she was sorry he had so misunderstood Angelo, but she had acted as
she knew her guardian would have done, and would wish her to do.
The whole letter was written with the nicest delicacy and regard
for his feelings; and though, when her kind and most sisterly
letter reached Walter Surrey, he was at first pained and mortified
that she should know of his folly, he could not but be grateful to
her for so promptly and yet delicately assisting him; and he wrote
and told her so; and told her, too, that he had learned a lesson he
should never forget. And he kept his word.</p>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32.</h2>

<p>Let us return for a brief space to a person whom we have,
perhaps, too long forgotten&mdash;our radical friend, Roland
Aubrey, the companion and friend of Arthur Vivian.</p>

<p>Roland Aubrey was one of those unhappily constituted beings who
are always coveting something which, when once possessed, is soon
wearied of, and cast aside. False, passionate, fair spoken, and
fickle, he always envied and coveted a thing or person till he
obtained possession; but once won he was soon sated. Money was the
only thing he never wearied of, and he rarely stopped at anything
to obtain it, for he was as unprincipled as he was false.</p>

<p>When he had first met Inez de Caldara that night, more than a
year before, on which he had given her and Colonel St. John shelter
from the snow-drift, her extreme beauty, young as she was, had made
a deeper impression on him than perhaps anything had in his life
before, and the impression was in no way lessened when he learned
from the colonel that she was the ward of Sir Angelo Egerton, of
Falcontower; and though many long months passed before he again saw
her, the memory of her image did not fade, as others had done.
Subsequently in London, during the period that Inez was at Forest
Moor, he had availed himself of the colonel's invitation and called
on him, and it was the latter who had introduced him to Egerton as
the gentleman who had so courteously received himself and Inez; and
Egerton, grateful for any service done to his ward, too proud also
to remain willingly under an obligation, and naturally taking
Louis' introduction as a passport, gave Aubrey an invitation to
Falcontower for Christmas, at the same time that he asked
Louis.</p>

<p>Roland accepted it, and again met the young Spaniard, more
beautiful than ever, the more so in his eyes for the rich gold in
which the jewel was set; and Egerton noticed with a secret smile
the attentions which Aubrey paid his ward. When they returned to
town, Roland, in attempting to continue their guest, soon found
that Inez at Falcontower and Inez in London were two very different
people. As his hostess, her courtesy had made her treat him with a
patient gentleness and tolerance which his vanity had construed
into receiving his attentions; but in town, where no tie of hostess
to guest bound her, the Castilian treated him with her usual cold
hauteur, and placed a barrier of proud reserve between herself and
him. He was like most fickle, obstinate characters, only rendered
more determined and zealous by opposition, whether tacit or open;
and both from that and vanity, Inez's haughty coldness did not
daunt him; for with the very lowest possible opinion of women, he
set it down to coquettish arts. How very different was his estimate
to the high standard of the chivalrous Egerton.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>One day Marion Rochester was sitting alone in her boudoir,
lonely and sad enough, when the door opened, and Inez came in with
her silent step, but a troubled look on the usually quiet face that
instantly alarmed Marion, who, since her meeting with Austin, had
grown more restless and nervous.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she said, hurriedly. "Julian&mdash;has my
husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! No, no, Marion. Look here. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>There was an open letter in her hand, and she gave it to Mrs.
Rochester, with the indignant blood flushing through the pale,
clear olive of her cheek.</p>

<p>"How dare he send me that?" she said.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Marion, "why it is actually an offer of
marriage from Roland Aubrey. Coolly penned, too, on my word. Well,
write directly, and refuse him."</p>

<p>"But, Marion, I really don't know what to say," said the
Castilian, half laughing, and still half indignant. "I should say
something too bitter and haughty. See how self-satisfied conceit is
in every line. The whole effusion looks as if he had got it from a
French novel. I wish you would answer it for me."</p>

<p>"No," replied Marion; "if I do, he will call here and want to
see you."</p>

<p>"I would not see him for worlds," said the girl,
energetically.</p>

<p>"Sit down at my desk there and write," said Marion. "Come, Inez,
you who receive and answer Angelo's business letters, must surely
know how to write a refusal to an offer. Tell him you are engaged
to Egerton."</p>

<p>"But you know, Marion, that the orthodox way is to be very sorry
to decline the honor, et cetera, and I won't write any such
falsehoods; for I am not sorry, and I consider it rather an insult
than an honor."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Marion, with something of her old merry
laugh, "say, 'Sir,&mdash;I consider your offer as a dire insult,
and desire you to consider yourself kicked."</p>

<p>Inez laughed outright at this, and taking up a pen in a sort of
desperation, wrote off an answer which Marion read over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"That will do," she said. "You certainly have given him reason
to mutter, 'Haughty as an Infanta.'"</p>

<p>"I mean to do so," replied the Spaniard, as she sealed and
directed it. "If he comes here, Aunt Marion, you must see him, for
I will not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rochester promised, and the letter was sent. To say that
Aubrey was not annoyed would be untrue; but it would be equally
untrue to say that he was seriously daunted; he was nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>"These women," he muttered, with a supercilious smile, "are full
of airs and arts to bring us more humbly to their feet, and this
Spanish child of fifteen is an adept already. Well, she is worth
some trouble to win, for her curious beauty is quite irresistible;
moreover, Egerton will of course dower her richly. So to-morrow I
will call on her temporary guardian, Mrs. Rochester, and ask for an
interview with this coquettish little lady."</p>

<p>The next day Aubrey stepped into his cabriolet, and drove to
Seymour-street. He thought he saw Inez at the drawing-room window,
but when he was shown up only Mrs. Rochester was there. She
received him chillingly, for though she had laughed at Inez's
amusing perplexity and indignation, she was in truth somewhat
indignant at his coming after so very decided a refusal as he had
received; but Aubrey, after the first few words of greeting that
politeness required, said, "You seem surprised to see me today,
Mrs. Rochester."</p>

<p>"To say the truth, Mr. Aubrey," returned the lady, in the same
cold, haughty manner, "I am surprised, when I remember the letter
which I presume you must have received from Miss de Caldara."</p>

<p>"I received it, indeed, Mrs. Rochester," he replied, "and I
could not rest till I came to entreat permission to plead my cause
in person. Uncertainty is terrible, suspense is unbearable,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marion interrupted him, for she saw through him, and there was
an almost unconscious shade of contempt in her tone as she said,
"Pardon me, sir, but permit me to say that when Miss de Caldara
gave a refusal she meant a refusal; and if you require further
confirmation, allow me to inform you that the lady is already
engaged, and has been for more than a month."</p>

<p>"Engaged!" exclaimed Aubrey, starting and rising quickly.</p>

<p>"Ay, engaged to Sir Angelo Egerton," returned Marion, rising
also; "and before long will be his wife."</p>

<p>"Then, madam," said Aubrey, crushing for the time his real rage,
"I can only beg you in my name to express to Miss de Caldara my
deep regret for any pain I may, nay, must, have caused her."</p>

<p>Aubrey bowed low, and took his leave, but with revenge in his
heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33.</h2>

<p>In her last interview with her husband, Evelina Vivian had told
him, and told him truly, that she was dying. She had never been
strong, and from the time her baby died, she had never rallied. If
Arthur had been kind to her she might have done so, but almost from
the first he had treated her harshly; for a short while after her
infant's death, he had been a little more gentle, but then he had
gone away for more than a year, and when he returned he was as
harsh as he had been before. So it had gone on; he cowed her timid
spirit, and ended by breaking her heart.</p>

<p>Eveline was dying now; it was impossible for even her poor
grandfather to blind himself to the fact. From that Christmas day
that she had seen Arthur she sank rapidly, but his name never
passed her lips, nor that of her father either; but she clung more
closely to her grandfather and sister, who was with her too, for
Eveline never left her room now, and was only moved from the bed to
a sofa. They asked her once whether she would not like to go into
the country. No, she replied; the only peaceful hours her life had
known had been passed in that dear old house, and she would die
there.</p>

<p>And so she lingered on till summer; she had always said, as a
little girl, that she should die in summer, and she reminded her
sister of it with a smile that had not been on her lips for many a
long day.</p>

<p>Death came suddenly at last. It was one evening in June when the
rays of the setting sun were streaming into the room, and on her
wasted white-robed form as it lay on the sofa, which had been
wheeled near the window. They had been very silent for a long time,
thinking she slept; perhaps she had, but if so, she was not asleep
now, for presently she said, quietly, "Look at that setting sun,
for my life will set with it. I shall never see another
sun-rise."</p>

<p>Theresa came and knelt by her; the old man bent over her, but
neither uttered a word. She spoke again after a time.</p>

<p>"When I am dead, lay me in my baby's grave, in the little
churchyard at Forest Moor. Ah! Essie."</p>

<p>"What, Evie?" said her sister.</p>

<p>"If it had lived Arthur might have loved me," she replied; "but
God's will be done."</p>

<p>"God is a merciful God, my child," whispered the old man.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandfather, but I have not kept His commandments; for I
made me human idols, and fell down and worshipped them."</p>

<p>"And in His love, my darling, He took one to Himself, and broke
the other idol. Whom God loves He chastens."</p>

<p>"He has chastened me heavily," she said, "very heavily; but it
has brought me nearer to Him. 'God be merciful to me, a sinner!'
Dear Essie, don't cry so dreadfully; promise me you'll never leave
grandfather."</p>

<p>"Never, never&mdash;I promise," said Theresa, forcing back her
tears.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Grandfather, give me your hand; yours, too,
Essie."</p>

<p>She sank back, clasping their hands, and lay very silent and
quiet, for a long time so calm and peaceful that it was long before
they knew that she was dead:&mdash;</p>

<p>'They had thought her dying when she slept,</p>

<p>And sleeping when she died.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34.</h2>

<p>The Highlanders never forget a service nor an injury, and in the
latter quality Roland Aubrey resembled them, though he had but
little of the former&mdash;not that he deliberately and on
calculation forgot a service or a friend, but it was that he was
too fickle long to retain any impression, save a very strong one;
and that meanness and falseness of disposition made him dislike the
hand that had done him good service, and hate the person to whom
all good feeling and generosity bound him to show gratitude. In
fine, he was a type of a very large portion of the world. You had
only to do him a kindness or service to make an enemy of him. One
person only had he any feeling for that had survived a first
acquaintance, and that person was Arthur Vivian; nor was it so
strange as it might at first appear; for independent of the mutual
dissipations and wild life that had in part bound them together,
there was a fascination about Arthur, in his manners, in his
strange wild beauty and talents&mdash;ay, and in his very atheism
and devilry of character, the more so, for the rare and strange
flashes of something better&mdash;something of remorseful memory of
his innocent childhood, that was like soft and far-off music heard
through mist and darkness.</p>

<p>The soul which, however dark and evil, can be touched by music,
and the sight of a little child, is never utterly lost. The spirit
that can feel remorse is never beyond hope.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was these powers of fascination, so fatal to their
possessor, which made the usually fickle Roland Aubrey hold to
Arthur Vivian, even as an exile and fugitive; though even then the
selfish calculation of the man showed forth; for he argued that if
he befriended Vivian now his talents might be useful to him one
day. That was in part the idea that had crossed him when he first
assisted Vivian in escaping after the attempted murder of Inez; and
ever since he had continued the same line of conduct, always being
aware of some central point by which to keep up a communication.
And now the time had come when Roland intended to reap the fruit of
the seed he had sown, and put Vivian's talents and extreme beauty
to some purpose. Behold the rejected and vindictive suitor of
Inez&mdash;the rival on whom the haughty Egerton had not even
deigned to shut his doors, seated now in an apartment in an hotel
in Naples; while opposite to him, lying on a couch, is the elegant
form of Arthur Vivian, one beautiful hand supporting his head, and
half-hidden amidst the curly masses of his burnished hair, the
other idly toying with a small dice-box.</p>

<p>"So," Aubrey was saying, "you have managed to escape the clever
detective whom Egerton sent after you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied Vivian; "though he was a sharp fellow,
and gave me much trouble. He was so near me once as to follow me
home from a casino. I gave the knave the slip, though," he added,
with a reckless laugh. "But I have escaped a greater, and more
imminent danger."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;who?" asked Aubrey.</p>

<p>"From Sir Angelo Egerton himself," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Egerton himself!" exclaimed Aubrey. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Vivian lifted his head, fixed his brilliant, almost gleaming
black eyes on Roland's face, and said, "We have known each other
long; and false and fickle as you are in most things, you have
never been so to me, and I don't think you will be so. Can I trust
you?"</p>

<p>"You can, Arthur Vivian," replied Aubrey; "and, by heaven, if it
is anything that will place Egerton in my power, you may count on
me to the death. I would give anything for revenge on him and Inez
de Caldara."</p>

<p>"Ha! would you?" exclaimed Vivian, starting up. "Then, indeed,
there's a strong bond between us&mdash;the bond of mutual hatred.
Why do you hate them so bitterly?"</p>

<p>"Rather, why do you, Arthur?" enquired Aubrey.</p>

<p>"It is an old score," he replied; "is it not enough that they
are hunting me to death? that this man has himself come in pursuit,
and, but for a most lucky chance, must have had me now?"</p>

<p>"Arthur, you are speaking in enigmas," said Aubrey; "what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Tell me first your reason for hating these two," said
Vivian.</p>

<p>"It is simple," was the reply. "You know how I first met the
senorita; you know her extraordinary beauty."</p>

<p>"And," said the other, "that she is the ward, almost daughter
and heiress to Egerton. She had golden charms."</p>

<p>"Daughter!&mdash;ward!" exclaimed Aubrey passionately; "his
wife, you mean, unless we can stop it."</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me any more," said Vivian, with the cold, icy
sneer most habitual to the beautiful mouth. "I see what your
reasons are now."</p>

<p>"Seeing it, then, make common cause with me," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Vivian; "is your motive mere revenge, or do you
think you have still a chance if you can make a split between her
and Egerton?"</p>

<p>"Are you a believer in woman's faith?" sneered Roland.</p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry!" returned Vivian with a laugh, "my wife was
so faithful that she wanted to come abroad with me."</p>

<p>"Ay, your wife; but this is different," said Aubrey. "By the
way, your wife is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" said Vivian; "he had sunk back again, but he
raised his head, and spoke impatiently.</p>

<p>"She is very ill," replied Aubrey; "she is dying."</p>

<p>"She told me that at Christmas," said Vivian.</p>

<p>"It was true," said Aubrey. "I arrived here to-day; and the day
before I left England I saw in the Times the announcement of her
death."</p>

<p>Vivian's face changed, and he turned it aside, murmuring, "Poor
Eveline! poor little Evie! I wish my last word to her had been a
kinder one, though I never cared for her." For some moments he was
silent; and when he turned his face again, there was no trace of
the momentary softness that had thrown real beauty into the
handsome features. "What is written, is written," he said in his
usual hard, half-reckless, half-sneering way; "that is another page
of my life turned over."</p>

<p>"Begin the new leaf, then, by telling me of this Egerton," said
his companion; "how and where you saw him."</p>

<p>"Listen, then," said Vivian. "I trust you because your interest
is mine, and to betray me would be to betray your interest. I won't
weary you with details; it is enough that when I fled here from
Lyons, where I last escaped my pursuer, I joined, the better for
concealment, half-a-dozen men, who were conspirators against their
government&mdash;this of Naples. We met in a deserted and
half-ruined villa out of the city, with plenty of secret escapes,
and one too from the police. We used to go masked and in slouched
hats, and heavy black cloaks. About five or six weeks ago we
appointed a meeting, for one of us, Alfieri, was going to introduce
a new member, a Spaniard, he said, by name Alava, who had for many
years been an exile in Naples on account of his Carlist politics.
Well, we all met, and Alfieri brought this Don Carlos de Alava, a
very tall, steady man, so closely masked and disguised in his
Spanish hat and mantilla, that nothing of him was visible, save his
coal-black hair, and even his eyes were shadowed under his hat.
Still, there was something about his figure, about the bearing of
the whole man, that wasn't utterly strange to me, though too
undefined to connect the impression with any particular person. It
was some time before he spoke, and then it was to address me in the
most courteous manner and in the purest Tuscan, though it was
without the slightest sign of recognition. But the moment I heard
the voice I knew my danger. Angelo Egerton is not a man to be once
seen and heard and forgotten; my memory, too, is very tenacious,
and I had heard him speak in the House eleven years ago, and when
he was in Italy five or six years ago with his ward, though he
didn't see me. You, who have known him personally, must have
noticed how peculiarly beautiful his voice is, so soft, and deep,
and musical, and though so low, heard so distinctly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Like music on the waters,'" quoted Aubrey. "Yes, I noticed it.
His ward's is just the same. I don't wonder at your recognising it
again, but what did you do? You spoke of knowing your danger. I
should have said his, for he was one to six, not to say seven."</p>

<p>"Six what?&mdash;six Neapolitans!" said Arthur, with strong
contempt. "You have only to look at him to see that his strength is
gigantic, slight as he is; besides, he was armed, and I was pretty
sure that Alfieri was in his pay. My position, I tell you, was
anything but pleasant, but just as I had made the discovery the
door was burst open and the room was filled with police, and every
mother's son of them was arrested, save your humble servant, who
managed to escape through the secret way and reach the city."</p>

<p>"You were mad to come here," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"No," replied Vivian; "I had been disguised, hair and all;
besides, Naples itself is the very last place they will look for me
in. I took care that an anonymous letter reached the authorities,
warning them that the Spanish prisoner would try to make himself
out an Englishman, and attempt to appeal to the ambassador. The six
others were executed, I believe, and if Egerton is still alive, he
will have at least a six months' trial of a Neapolitan
dungeon."</p>

<p>"Arthur, this is too bad," said Aubrey. "A man of such
mark&mdash;an ex-minister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And your rival," interposed the other, with his devilish sneer.
"Roland, you are a fool. Chance puts into your hands the very man
you hate, and you would fling it away. Let him lie there. They
won't dare to put him to death, lest what he says should turn out
to be true."</p>

<p>"Ah, and then if I could make her believe him faithless to her,"
said Aubrey, "she would in pique marry the first person who
offered."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Roland, it must be a cursedly well put together
story that will deceive her," said Vivian. "Though barely sixteen,
she knows too much of the world to believe any mere newspaper
report."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;if&mdash;" said Aubrey, slowly, "it were no report,
but announced as a certainty amongst the marriages in the papers as
having taken place in Italy, and if I could return and swear that I
had seen the marriage and register, then I think no woman's faith
could stand that."</p>

<p>"Speak out, man! What are you driving at?" demanded Vivian,
rising to his feet.</p>

<p>"That I will come down handsomely, and fit you out for the game,
if you will do the thing," said Aubrey. "I do not mean any rascally
mock marriage. I would not sacrifice any girl's name for my
scheme."</p>

<p>"What, when I'm just rid of one wife, you want me to saddle
myself with another! Thank you for nothing," said Vivian, with a
sardonic curl of his chiselled lip.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Arthur," said Aubrey. "You can marry a wife
without being bored with her. Leave her when you like. I can name a
lady whom we met a year ago in Bologna, when you first escaped from
Forest Moor&mdash;I mean that pretty creature you were so taken
with, Genevra della Scala."</p>

<p>"She was very lovely, and I have never forgotten her. A sweet
creature, too," said Vivian, with that momentary softening of his
face. "I would marry her if I could get her to take me."</p>

<p>"Come here," said Aubrey, drawing him to a tall Venetian mirror.
"What do you see there?"</p>

<p>"Myself," said Vivian. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Look, then, on that handsome form and face, and say whether she
will refuse you?" said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Roland&mdash;Roland!" said Vivian, with a passionate force that
was startling from him, "when my mother died, she left me the fatal
gift of her beauty. Oh, that fatal beauty!"</p>

<p>"Vivian&mdash;Arthur!" exclaimed Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;you think I was born with a devil in me," said Vivian,
"and perhaps I was. But I tell you there are times when I am almost
maddened by the memory of my childhood, when I stood an innocent
child at my mother's knee, and listened to her gentle teachings. I
believed in a God and an eternity then," he said, with a look of
such dark, wild remorse in his lurid eyes that Roland almost
recoiled.</p>

<p>Vivian turned away, and for some minutes there was silence.</p>

<p>"Will you do it, Vivian?" said Aubrey, breaking a silence that
was oppressive to him.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Vivian. "I don't mind such a pretty wife for a
time. How is it to be done?"</p>

<p>"She is a Veronese," said Aubrey. "She is the ward of a distant
relative, an old lady, who will be glad to be rid of her charge and
her money. They live at a small town some ten miles from Verona. We
will go there and introduce ourselves&mdash;myself in my own name,
you as Sir Angelo Egerton; only, mind, the marriage must take place
this day month. And the day that sees Inez pledged to me shall see
you the owner of five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Done!" said Vivian.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go at once and see about our instant departure," said
Aubrey.</p>

<p>Vivian looked after him, and as the door closed on him, he
muttered, with a bitter sneer, "I wish no better revenge on that
cursed dark faced girl than to see her Aubrey's wife. Curse them
all!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35.</h2>

<p>Austin Rochester had parted from his injured wife in fierce
passion and anger that had not been improved by the almost
immediate marriage of his daughter to her son&mdash;her work, he
knew, in utter defiance of his commands.</p>

<p>But he was weary of his lonely, dreary weight of misery and
sorrow; and ere June was many days old, he determined to return to
her, if he could bear it; for all the bitter memories of his lost
and wasted life rose between him and his second wife.</p>

<p>He had taken up his residence in apartments; and from thence he
wrote to her that he was himself going to live, at any rate for a
time, at Rochester Court, and that he wished her to join him
there.</p>

<p>When this arbitrary letter reached Marion, she was in her room
with Inez, dressing for the opera, having dismissed her maid, Nelly
Warren, in order that she and Inez might talk more freely.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the loving, suffering wife was passionate
joy; her second was very different.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez!" she cried, "my son&mdash;my Julian; he will part me
from him. He will never let us meet; and Julian will not be home
till next week, and I fear their meeting. I know Austin so well;
his passions are so fearful and ungoverned&mdash;and yet&mdash;oh,
child, if he would love me, I could die happy!"</p>

<p>"Dear Marion," said Inez, "do not let your love for even Julian
stand between you and your husband."</p>

<p>"I will go to him now, at once," said Marion. "Take off this
dress! Take these jewels from my hair!"</p>

<p>She was almost tearing them out, when Inez's hand arrested
her.</p>

<p>"Marion," said she, "be calm, Dear Marion, try and be calm."</p>

<p>"Calm!" said Marion. "Have I not been calm all these years? I am
not like you, child. I haven't got your iron nerves; and I haven't
had your iron training. I have been more nervous, too, since I met
him that day when Julian interfered between us."</p>

<p>The Castilian said nothing, but wrapped a shawl about her and
opened the door. "Come," she said, "the carriage is ready, and
Wylde will drive you; and, Marion, remember, do not let Margaret
and me stand in the way of his return."</p>

<p>She saw Mrs. Rochester into the carriage, and saw it drive off,
and then re-entered the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Austin Rochester sat waiting for an answer to his
imperative letter. He did not hear a carriage stop, nor steps enter
the house; but he heard them ascend the staircase and pause
outside, and, as the door opened, he turned sharply to once more
confront the beautiful woman whose happiness he had wrecked.</p>

<p>"You here!" he said, drawing back with a dark frown. "Do you
answer letters in person at this hour?"</p>

<p>"To my husband, yes," she answered, steadily; "if you wrote at
midnight I should come."</p>

<p>"Give me your answer then, madam, and leave me," said
Austin.</p>

<p>"Austin, hear me!" said Marion; "When Angelo Egerton went away,
he left his ward and her friend in my charge. Inez cannot leave
town; and I have no one to whom I can commit them, until
Julian&mdash;my son&mdash;returns, a week or a fortnight hence.
Listen still, Austin. I have things in London that I must arrange
before I can leave; my house for one, I cannot leave in two
days."</p>

<p>"So," said he, with an impetuous gesture, "these girls are to
prevent you from obeying my commands; and for the other, this
Egerton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Austin, hush, and listen to me!" said his wife. "I do not
refuse. Heaven knows I could not refuse you my very life's blood;
but what need to wait or go straight to the north? Return with me
now&mdash;come with me&mdash;to me; is not my home your
home&mdash;all I have yours too?"</p>

<p>"Mine!" he said, shaking off her entreating hand; "mine, aye, as
my soul is. I cannot touch it. Leave me. Go and do this Egerton's
bidding. You need not come to me in the north. Go!"</p>

<p>"I will not go&mdash;I will not leave you!" she said, still
preserving the same gentle, steady manner. "I am your wedded wife,
and I have borne your desertion too long. I will not be cast from
you, as if I were unworthy to bear your name. It is killing me; I
cannot bear it. Oh, Austin, return with me; it is only till Isbel
comes home, and then I will follow you where you will."</p>

<p>He glanced in her face, hesitated, and then said abruptly, "I
will come to-morrow; it is useless to plead more. I give you my
pledge to return to you to-morrow."</p>

<p>She bent down, kissed his hand, and went away without a word.
Somehow he could not forgot that silent kiss.</p>

<p>The same summer moon that shone on him, shone on Inez de
Caldara. There she sat by the window of the boudoir, whither she
had stolen to be alone. Alone she sat, the slight form bending a
little forward; the young face drooping, the dark eyes fixed on the
ground, one little hand dreamily pushing round a diamond ring on
her finger, which flashed and glittered in the moonlight like a
star. It was a ring Angelo had placed on her finger the morning of
his departure; that was six or seven weeks ago, and she had not had
a line from him&mdash;not the faintest rumor even of him. Look at
that young face; it has the same look it had when she returned from
Forest Moor; the anxious lines have returned to the quiet, sad
brow, and the whole face has the old stern gravity and weariness of
expression in every settled line. She suffers in silence and
alone.</p>

<p>She sat without moving the whole time of Mrs. Rochester's
absence, till the opening of the door made her lift her face and
then rise up quickly as she saw Marion; and her voice, soft and
musical as usual, betrayed no emotion when she spoke.</p>

<p>"Dear Marion, is he with you?" she asked. "You look brighter
than you have for many a long day."</p>

<p>"Darling, I wish I could see you so," returned Marion. "I am
happier, for my husband will return to me to-morrow. Listen, and I
will tell you; and then we must go to Margaret. Oh, child! oh,
child! how can I win my husband's love?"</p>

<p>The over-strained tension of the nerves gave way; and suddenly,
hiding her face on Inez's breast, Marion wept bitterly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36.</h2>

<p>The evening before the day on which Julian and his young wife
were expected to arrive was a wild stormy evening, one of those
that are so often in summer followed by a fine day.</p>

<p>Marion Rochester and Inez were deep in a game of chess, and
Margaret Arundel was sitting near, apparently watching the game,
but in truth perhaps dreaming of one far away across the mournful,
misty Atlantic. Rochester was seated at a little distance, reading
the evening paper, and now and then coming round to glance over the
game, though he rarely spoke save to utter something bitter or
cynical; for he treated his wife with cold and distant politeness,
and her guests the same&mdash;with perfect courtesy, but no more.
Of Inez's engagement to Angelo he knew nothing, that was only known
to Julian and Isbel Rothesay, Marion, and Margaret.</p>

<p>"Marion," said Rochester, suddenly, "I think I heard you say
yesterday to Miss de Caldara that you wished you had some news of
Egerton. Here is news. Listen, 'We learn by the mails just arrived
from the continent that a few days ago was celebrated, at the
church of Saneta Maria, in Bologna, the marriage of the celebrated
Sir Angelo Rothesay Egerton, of Falcontower Castle, to the Signora
Genevra della Scala, an Italian lady of birth and great
beauty.'"</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" exclaimed his wife and Margaret, but no word
passed Inez's lips. She rose quite calmly, though with a colorless
face, walked round to Rochester, and taking the paper from him,
read the paragraph herself.</p>

<p>"It is false&mdash;utterly, basely false!" she said. "It is
impossible that it can be true."</p>

<p>There was no passion in her manner&mdash;no quiver of the lip,
but there was a depth and intensity in her low steady voice which
perhaps only Marion and Margaret thoroughly felt and
understood.</p>

<p>Austin looked at her for a moment; then said, "And why is it
impossible that it can be true? What is more likely than for a rich
and handsome Englishman to marry a beautiful Italian?"</p>

<p>"Why?"&mdash;and now Inez's proud face flushed darkly for a
moment&mdash;"because, Mr. Rochester, I am Angelo Egerton's
betrothed wife."</p>

<p>"Still, senora, that hardly affects the possibility or
likelihood of this statement," said Austin, with a covert sneer,
that the cynicism of his nature could not repress.</p>

<p>"Do you judge all men by your own proved standard of faith?" was
the bitter taunt which rose to the Spaniard's lips, but she crushed
it down, for Marion's sake, and said in a voice resolutely calm,
"You, at least, should know Egerton better than that. Well enough
to believe in his honor, if not his faith."</p>

<p>"I! I believe in nothing," he said, with his sardonic smile.
"Poor child! You will find the anchor of faith you lean on a vain
shadow."</p>

<p>"I shall find it a firm rock, on which to rest my life," she
answered, coolly resuming her place at the chessboard. "I do not
expect you to disbelieve the statement, but leave me to my faith in
Egerton. Come, Marion, let us finish our game."</p>

<p>Truly 'Perfect love casteth out fear.' Her love and faith in
Angelo were as perfect as his was in her.</p>

<p>Thus far Roland Aubrey's scheme had utterly failed.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>I was restless that night, says Margaret Arundel, in her
memoirs. I did not then know why; but looking back, I know now.</p>

<p>It was a very stormy night, but the moon broke out now and then
between the clouds, and shone brightly. Inez's room was next to
mine, and a small private door communicated with it. I heard her
say good night to Mr. and Mrs. Rochester on the staircase, and then
enter her room, but I did not hear her moving about at all, as if
she was undressing. I got into bed, but I couldn't rest or sleep,
for my thoughts would wander to her alone there, and then far, far
away. I could not read my own heart then, but that night she made
me know it.</p>

<p>I heard 1 o'clock, then 2 strike, but still sleep would not
come&mdash;the storm had passed and left the sky clear and fair,
and at last rising I wrapped a morning gown round me, and very
softly opened the door leading into Inez's room. It was three hours
nearly since we had come up stairs, but there she sat on the floor
by the window, dressed, her raven hair falling about her; her dark,
beautiful face uplifted, and her hand clasping to her breast that
jewelled cross I knew so well. I stopped a moment spell-bound, then
crossed the chamber, and sat down on a low chair by her.</p>

<p>"Inez," I said, gently touching her.</p>

<p>She drew a deep, shivering breath, and turned her face to
me.</p>

<p>"Margaret," she whispered, "if he is dead I shall not live
long."</p>

<p>"Inez, Inez," said I, "don't talk like that&mdash;don't talk so,
child. It is wrong."</p>

<p>"Wrong," she repeated, almost
mechanically&mdash;"wrong!&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it wrong," said I, "to bind up one's very life in that of
any human being?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied; "I can't help it. Oh, Margaret, I
could bear anything better than this sickening suspense and
uncertainty."</p>

<p>Her haughty pride and self-command gave way; and, laying her
head on my lap, she wept such tears as I have never before seen a
woman weep, and never since. She wept as men, not women, weep; but
I was glad to see her, for well I knew that if she knew or believed
Egerton really dead, she would have been still, and calm, and
tearless, and so have withered away like a blighted flower, and
died.</p>

<p>She recovered herself in a few moments, but she did not lift her
head, and I bent down, and whispered, "He isn't dead, Inez; he
can't be. You look too readily at the dark side of things; isn't it
much more likely that he is in disguise in some way that makes it
impossible for him to write?"</p>

<p>She made no answer, and to rouse her I added, "It is strange
about that notice in the paper. It is more than a mere report."</p>

<p>"Margaret, you don't believe it?" she said.</p>

<p>"No, Inez," I replied, "you don't, and so I don't. Besides, it
is impossible."</p>

<p>"I should think so," she said, dryly.</p>

<p>"But still, Inez," said I, "I should like to know what it really
means."</p>

<p>"I know it can't be Angelo," she replied, "and so I don't care
to know anything about it, or who it is."</p>

<p>Oh, that child's faith! it was sublime&mdash;it was grand!</p>

<p>"Inez," said I, "suppose that some one told you they had seen
the marriage. Suppose Julian
Rothesay&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;Colonel St. John."</p>

<p>I could not help that foolish hesitation.</p>

<p>She lifted her dark eyes, and fixed them on me, with that look
of hers that Vivian had quailed beneath and which now brought the
color to my cheeks, and read my very heart better than I did
myself. "I should think them strangely mistaken."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, with a half smile, "that Angelo might have
a double, but no more that."</p>

<p>"Inez," I said, "I think, in your place, and in that case, my
faith would fail."</p>

<p>"Wait till you are tried," she said.</p>

<p>Again the tell-tale color rushed into my face so warmly that I
raised my hand to hide it.</p>

<p>She rose up suddenly, and wound her arms about me, drawing my
head upon her breast. I burst into tears; I couldn't help it; I was
weak and unnerved.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez," I cried, "you will despise me; you must think me so
weak, so foolish and wrong."</p>

<p>"I knew it long ago, my dear Margaret," whispered the soft
musical voice I had never loved so well as now, "and nothing can
make me think badly of my Margaret. Can we help giving our
affections? They are beyond control. Did I not love Angelo even as
a child in his arms, ay, long before I knew I was anything to him
but his ward?"</p>

<p>Surely that child was sent as a blessing to all she came in
contact with.</p>

<p>For a long time we were silent, and then I said, "Hope and
trust, Inez darling. Now come to bed, and have as much hope as you
have faith."</p>

<p>She smiled sadly, and shook her head, but we went to bed, and I
soon slept. I don't think she did, for the next day she looked very
weary and anxious; though when I reminded her that she was to go
and meet Julian Rothesay and Isbel at London Bridge, her face
brightened. I think, next to Angelo, Julian has the first place in
her heart, and knowing what I do now, I don't wonder at it.</p>

<p>Looking over the notes from which I write these memoirs, I find
that some few things which followed have been by me somewhat
passingly put down.</p>

<p>Julian Rothesay and Isbel took Mrs. Rochester's Seymour-street
house off her hands, and then she went with her husband to
Rochester Court; but he did not meet either Isbel or her husband,
and Mrs. Rochester saw them at the hotel they were at till she left
town. When she went, Inez and I remained with the Rothesays, and I
was glad of it, for Julian had more influence over Inez than
anyone, save Egerton, and he made her sit to him for the portrait,
he said, smiling, of "Inez, Lady Egerton."</p>

<p>I remember one day we were all out riding in the park, when
Isbel exclaimed, "Inez, there is Roland Aubrey riding this
way."</p>

<p>The next moment he came up, affected to hesitate, and then, with
a low bow to us, addressed my Spanish friend very coolly,
considering what had passed.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, senora, for the liberty I am taking," said he, "but
you are aware of the marriage of Sir Angelo Egerton in
Bologna?"</p>

<p>"A mere newspaper report," she answered, with a haughty
carelessness.</p>

<p>"Pardon, again, senora," said he; "I saw the marriage
myself."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Aubrey must have been strangely mistaken to imagine
any stranger Sir Angelo Egerton," said Inez, with bitter sarcasm,
"When that gentleman himself informs me of his marriage I will
believe it, not before. Your scheme, sir, is 'Love's labor
Lost.'"</p>

<p>With an ironical bow and smile she turned from him and we rode
on.</p>

<p>"That man is at the bottom of the report," she said to Rothesay;
"his whole scheme is as plain as day, Julian."</p>

<p>"His opinion of a woman's truth must be very poor," returned
Julian, smiling. "He has over-reached himself. I would as soon
believe Isbel here false, as Angelo."</p>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37.</h2>

<p>Austin Rochester treated his wife with the most cold and distant
politeness that was consistent with the commonest courtesy of a
gentleman, a course that cut her more deeply, and placed a more
effectual barrier between them, than any harshness could have done,
for she began to both fear him, to long for his presence, and yet
to dread it; and when he came he found her timid and nervous to a
degree that grew at last, cut off as she was now from all who loved
her, to actual agony. Sorrow had done its work, and her nervous
system was not what it had been ten years before.</p>

<p>If Marion Rochester had met Austin's pride with pride, coldness
with coldness, and cynicism with bitterness&mdash;if she had set
herself, as some would have done, systematically to oppose his
wishes and commands, to resist him in everything, she would have
made his home a continual scene of discord, and brought upon her
head untold misery.</p>

<p>But it was the nature of Austin's gentle wife to act the very
opposite to all this. Such an idea as disputing anything he
commanded or wished never entered her head. She never met him, when
she did see him, with a frown or cloud on her face; nervous or
timid she often was now in his presence, but though it sometimes
annoyed him&mdash;the more that he knew it was his work&mdash;it
was impossible that he could for ever in heart utterly resist the
influence of her unvarying sweetness and gentleness. It was
touching to watch her if he spoke to her with something less of his
cold distance; how every feature suddenly lighted up, yet how the
tear started to her eye and her lip quivered; how, when he paced
gloomily up and down the room, as he often did, her eyes would
follow him; and, oh, how her heart ached for him, how she longed to
throw herself at his feet and entreat him not to repulse
her&mdash;to love her, to let her love him! Let her love him! Alas
for her! Long since had the heart he crushed as ruthlessly as his
own been given to him.</p>

<p>He long struggled against it; but there was something about
Marion which, despite himself, touched at last the naturally
generous and noble nature which lay beneath the evil&mdash;a sort
of clinging gentleness which, to a man like himself, could not fail
to arouse everything soft and good in him. He felt his dislike to
her melting, though, alas! not his belief in the impossibility of
her love. Often of a night as she slept he would bend over her and
gently draw back the sunny tresses from her fair face; once, and
once only, he bent lower still, and softly kissed her brow; she
moved slightly, and smiling, murmured a name in her sleep; his
heart beat wildly&mdash;it was the name of Austin that his wife
uttered; but then he turned away with a low, bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"No, it is impossible," said he; "she must, she does hate me. It
is impossible for any one to love me."</p>

<p>A darker, deeper shadow fell on him. He was no longer
indifferent to the wife whom years before it had cost him such
agony to wed.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>One day late in the autumn, just as the sun was sinking behind
the hills which lay to the west, Marion drove out quite alone in
her little park phaeton. It was a lovely evening, but Marion,
absorbed in her own thoughts, did not heed it, and the ponies
wandered on, and stopped under some trees to crop the grass. For a
long time she sat there, till the sun had sunk and the gloaming
begun to fall, and then the chilliness roused her from her dreams
of the past, and she gathered up the reins to return; but as she
did so a man stepped from amongst the trees and laid his hand on
the reins&mdash;a man we know, though she did not&mdash;more
haggard and wild-looking now than when we last saw him, but Stephen
Stanfeld still.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Rochester's wife?" he said, roughly.</p>

<p>"I am," replied Marion, boldly, though her heart sank within
her. "Let go those horses."</p>

<p>"Not yet, lady," said he. "You are handsomer than your
predecessor, and I must have a few words with you."</p>

<p>"Not one," said Marion; and bold with the desperation of terror,
she sprang to the ground to fly, flinging away the heavy whip,
which, in her place, Inez would have laid across him with no weak
hand.</p>

<p>With one stride Stanfeld was at her side, and had grasped her
hand; but in that moment a tall figure stood between them.</p>

<p>"Villain! you have killed my first wife, and insult the second!"
And with all his fierce passion and hatred concentrated in that one
blow, Austin Rochester felled Stanfeld to the ground.</p>

<p>Marion remembered no more. The first thing she knew again was a
dreamy consciousness of being in a lighted room, and hearing
voices.</p>

<p>"Nelly, she has lain like this a long time," said the voice of
Austin, in low tones. "I wish she would move."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to fear, indeed, sir," replied Nelly. "Her
hands are warmer. Leave her to me, now, awhile."</p>

<p>He made no answer; and went away with a slow, sad step. It was
sometime longer before Marion could speak.</p>

<p>"Nell," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Here I am, my darling mistress. How do you feel?" said the
girl, bending over her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rochester raised herself, and glanced at the clock. It was
past 10.</p>

<p>"As late as that?" she said, passing her hand over her eyes.
"Nelly, I have been weaker of late, or I should not have fainted so
long, I know. Where is my husband!"</p>

<p>"In the library, ma'am," replied the girl. "There is a fire
there."</p>

<p>"Alone&mdash;all alone!" murmured Marion; then aloud, "You may
go to bed, Nelly. I shall not want you to-night."</p>

<p>Nelly Warren retired, and then Marion opened the door, and
descended the staircase.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rochester had gone to the library, where a bright
little fire burned, with a small sofa placed beside it. He sat down
on it, and, resting his head on his hand, fixed his eyes on the
fire, more lonely, more desolate, more broken-hearted than when he
had stood alone and deserted that heavy day years ago, when his
first wife died. All the sad, bitter memories of the past had been
aroused by that brief meeting with Stanfeld. All his sorrows were
raked up and laid bare again; he felt that the crisis of his fate
had come at last. He could no longer disguise it from himself that
he loved his gentle and deeply injured wife, whom he could not
believe loved him. Yet he felt that after what had passed, little
though that seemed, he could not go on with her as he had done; he
must speak to her, yet his pride, his every feeling rose when he
though of her answer&mdash;that is, what he believed it would be.
He little imagined how near she was while he sat there, his very
heart burning with agony.</p>

<p>Marion paused a moment outside the door, fearing to enter, and
fearing to meet one of those cold stern looks, so forbidding, so
repelling to her. Yet he was alone&mdash;he was unhappy, and who
should go to him if not she, his wife? She opened the door quietly,
and trembling entered. His head was bowed on his hand, and his
whole form drooping. Woman's love triumphed over fear and nervous
timidity, and she sprang forward&mdash;to his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Austin, do not send me away. Indeed I could not rest while
you were alone and sad here."</p>

<p>He started and looked up. "Send you away?" he repeated slowly;
"send you away, Marion? No; it is well you have come, I have much
to say to you. You have heard part, and all must come now."</p>

<p>He rose and paced up and down, striving to recover the
self-command which for a moment he had lost. It was but for a
moment, then he said calmly and steadily, "Marion, listen to me.
You as yet know little of my past life. It is sad, but for once I
will tell all. I do not fear to lay all bare to your gentle
innocence. Once, years ago, I heard you tell my daughter that you
pitied me, it nearly maddened me then; but now, I say, be lenient
to the evil and wrong you will see, and pity them&mdash;if you
can."</p>

<p>She longed to throw herself in his arms, and tell him how she
loved him, but something in his eye held her silent and
nerveless.</p>

<p>Rochester leaned against the mantelpiece, and went on. He went
over that portion of his history with which the reader is already
acquainted, and continued, "I went from Eton to college. I could
not bear myself; and to drown thought, I plunged wildly into
dissipation. My father died when I was barely nineteen, leaving me,
deep in debt, with a thousand pounds. I left England at once,
secretly, and went abroad, not leaving any trace even to my brother
Wilmot; only Egerton, under an oath of secrecy, knew of my
retreat."</p>

<p>Austin paused before he went on, but not quite so steadily or
calmly as before.</p>

<p>"No matter how I lived abroad&mdash;let that pass. I met an
English gentleman there, a Mr. Earnscliffe, who had a daughter
Mina, a beautiful creature. Marion, I loved her&mdash;oh, how I
loved that girl!&mdash;I worshipped, idolised her. But at first I
did not speak, for she had some fortune, and I had none&mdash;at
first, I say, for I had not known them long, when I heard that the
bank in which Earnscliffe's fortune was had failed. Well, there is
no need to linger here. I spoke then, and was accepted. Marion, I
believed that she loved me as I did her&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly&mdash;his lips were white, but after a
minute or two he continued.</p>

<p>"We were married soon, for her father hurried it on, though a
year afterwards I knew that she had only married me in pique. It
seems strange to tell you all this, but I, who had so loved my
wife, soon found that I had been deceived, and by her. Fool, madman
that I was, to imagine that any human creature could care for me!
She did not; she hated and detested me as the rest had done, and
she soon showed it, but I loved her better than I had ever done.
One day I asked her what made her so unhappy, and entreated her to
tell me&mdash;she did then. With passionate tears and sobs she told
me how she hated me; and she had loved&mdash;how she did still
love, one who, before I knew her, had won her heart&mdash;it was
Stephen Stanfeld, then in the prime of his life. She told me how he
had deserted her, as she rightly supposed, because of some rumor
about her property. Then I came, and how, in wounded love and
pique, she had wedded me. I gave her no word of reproach for her
cruel deception, but I grew more stern and bitter after that.</p>

<p>"A year passed away, and Mina was within a very short time of
her confinement. I knew she could not survive it; there was no need
to tell me that, as they did; for had I not ever since that fatal
explanation seen her, month after month, drooping, drooping slowly
into her grave.</p>

<p>"We were then at Geneva, and one day I went out and was absent
some time, and it was therefore late when I returned home. As I
approached the drawing-room, I heard my wife's voice in entreaty,
and then a man's voice answered in fierce tones. I dashed open the
door, and stood face to face with my rival. She, my wife, was
crouching at his feet, and he stood gazing on her with the face of
a demon. It was well I had no weapon in my hand, or I should have
killed him. She must have read in my face what was in me, for she
threw herself, with a wild cry, between us. I remember putting her
aside and demanding of him what he did there. He stood
there&mdash;in my house&mdash;and insolently told me that he had
watched and waited for this time to perfect his revenge; that he
had come to upbraid her for her faithlessness to him; and this when
he had a wife in England, which he had left for his fiendish
revenge. I did not wait to hear his black villainy to the end. I
remember stepping forwards and hurling him with a strength such as
I have never possessed save then, right through the open window on
to the lawn without, and Mina, with a shriek that I never heard
before, and never can again, fell senseless in my arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I recall that fatal day!" said Rochester, covering
his face with a bitter agony that he could not control.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for a moment. Marion sat bending
forwards, her lips apart, her eyes fixed on her husband's, spell
bound; she could not move or speak. Austin dropped his hands, his
face was ashy white, but he went on.</p>

<p>"I carried her up stairs to her room, and sent for a physician;
they recovered her from her swoon, but not to her senses. She awoke
a raving maniac, and from her ravings I learnt all that had been
left untold, all the love she had borne him, and how fiendishly he
had repaid it. That night she gave birth to twins. She never saw
another sun; she died that night.</p>

<p>"Marion, one child was born mad, and it was his work&mdash;his
only. It died in a few months, leaving me Isbel, who, like her
mother, hated me. I left the place with the child, wanderers in a
strange land. But that child&mdash;how I loved it! I idolised it.
The rest you know&mdash;no, not all yet. I have more to tell you;
but the story of my life is ended. I have lived forty years, and in
that time I have gone through more sorrows than most men have in
twice that number of years. Perhaps they should have softened me,
but they did not; you saw how the very sight of that man roused all
the demon in me. Marion, you know now to what and who you are
wedded; you saw why all hate me."</p>

<p>Marion had listened till now without moving, with every nerve
strung too high even for tears; but when he stopped, she rose,
hesitated a second, and then she threw her arms round his neck, and
laying her head on his breast, said, touchingly, "Oh, Austin! not
all. I love you, my husband."</p>

<p>The simple words, the tender action went to Rochester's very
heart, and he clasped his wife passionately to him, and for a
moment held her close, close to him, as if no power should ever
take her from him. It was only for a moment; the thought flashed
across him, "She mistakes pity for love;" and he put her back.</p>

<p>"No, Marion," he said; "you mistake your own feelings; I should
have told you long ago. A woman loves but once, and your love is
buried."</p>

<p>Marion bowed her head, and for the first time wept. She saw now
the shadows that had been upon her married life.</p>

<p>"Oh, Austin! Austin!" she said, "Cyril was never anything but a
second father to me. I have never loved but once."</p>

<p>"Stay, Marion," said Austin. "Do you know that I married you for
the basest of motives&mdash;money&mdash;yet for my Isbel, too, to
make a home for her. Oh! what it cost me! I hated you then. I do so
no longer. Your gentleness and sweetness under all my harshness and
desertion have won me even against my will."</p>

<p>"And yet you will not believe me," she interrupted,
passionately. "Oh! Austin, if you repulse me again, I shall die! I,
who have loved you so long!"</p>

<p>"I do believe you, my darling, my beloved wife!" said Austin.
And, as he clasped her close to his heart, the tears she wept on
his breast were tears of joy. There was no alloy in them.</p>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38.</h2>

<p>And what of the faithful, enduring, long-suffering Inez&mdash;a
child almost in years, a woman in sorrows&mdash;oh, how many dreary
years of silent sorrow she had lived in those short five months,
since Egerton went away! She never said anything; she read and
wrote, and went on with all the occupations she had been used to,
and was so quiet and grave, as she had always been, that even
Margaret and Isbel thought her more hopeful; but Julian, who knew
her so well, read her tearless calmness better, and he saw that the
child's heart was breaking.</p>

<p>"Inez, my dear child," he said, one afternoon, when they were
alone, "you make me very anxious about you; you are killing
yourself."</p>

<p>"'The sooner it is over, the sooner to sleep,'" said Inez,
bowing her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Julian, passing his arm round her, and
speaking in his tender, gentle way, "do I not suffer too? Have I
not enough to bear without the fear of losing you too?"</p>

<p>He knew well how to reach her heart; the slight tinge of
reproach, gentle as it was, touched her to the quick.</p>

<p>"Oh, Julian, forgive me!" said Inez. "I can't help it. I don't
mean to grieve you."</p>

<p>"But you do," said Julian. "How do you think I must feel when I
see you almost dying, drooping day by day before my eyes? It is
dreadful to bear."</p>

<p>She was silent; but he felt her slight form quiver in every
nerve, and presently he said, "Rouse yourself, my little sister.
Surely if I can hope, you can do so too? Should we not trust in
God, and bow to the stroke of Heaven?"</p>

<p>"I can't bend before the blast and rise again," said Inez,
almost passionately. "I must bow to the storm&mdash;and die!"</p>

<p>"And is not that defying Heaven, my darling Inez?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Julian! Death is all I ask!&mdash;all I pray for."</p>

<p>"You speak so, child!" said Julian, energetically. "You who have
faced death in the terrible form of midnight murder? You, who even
now bear on your breast the proof of how frightfully near sudden
death you once were, call the grave all you ask and pray for! Inez,
do you forget that after death is eternity? Will all your high love
and noble faith for Angelo purchase you a passport to Heaven?
Rather have you not loved a human idol instead, and so worshipped
it that He who said, 'I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have none
other gods but me,' has, in his great love, chastened you? Child,
pray for life, not for the death you so impiously ask for, or the
grave into which you are so madly hurrying."</p>

<p>She had raised her face with a startled, frightened look; but
now she hid it against him, weeping bitterly, almost convulsively,
"Oh, Julian! Julian! spare me! have mercy!"</p>

<p>He kissed her brow, and gently soothed her; and, when she grew
calmer, whispered words of hope till he won from her lips a faint
smile, and a whispered "Dear Julian, if it were possible to do so,
I love you better than ever I did before. I will never again be so
impiously wicked as I have been."</p>

<p>"Are you angry with me?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Ah! no, Julian," she replied; "rather am I grateful to you."
And she bowed her head, and kissed his hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39.</h2>

<p>"Letters," said Julian, coming in towards the middle of the next
day with several in his hand; "one for you, Miss Arundel; here
Isbel, are two; and for you, Inez," throwing several into her lap,
"a lot of business letters; one, I dare swear, from some muff of a
constituent, asking for an appointment."</p>

<p>"Constituents seem to think that members are made of
appointments," said Inez. "What is your letter, Julian?"</p>

<p>"From my&mdash;from Marion Rochester," said the artist,
remembering Margaret's presence just in time.</p>

<p>There was a silence while he read, and then he put the letter in
his wife's hand, with three words in Italian, which made Inez rise
quickly, and read it over Isbel's shoulder; no rudeness in any of
them to Margaret, who was occupied with her own letter.</p>

<p>Marion's letter contained briefly the tale of her happiness, and
an earnest entreaty from herself and Austin for Julian and Isbel to
come down as soon as they could. None of the three so deeply
interested in her fate spoke; and, indeed, before they could do so,
the door opened, and a servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Miss de Caldara," he said, "your servant Burns is here, and
desires to see you directly."</p>

<p>The Castilian rose calmly, but with a face so white that Julian
followed her out; and laying his hand on her shoulder to stay her,
said to the servant, "Where is Burns?"</p>

<p>"In the breakfast-room, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Julian. "Inez," he added, in French, "I will
go into the next room. If you want me, knock at the wall." She bent
her head, and glided away.</p>

<p>In the breakfast-room was Burns, but with such a look of
agitation, alarm, and perplexity in his face that for a moment
Inez's very heart stood still, and it required all her strong will
to speak as calmly as she did. "What has happened, Burns? Tell me
the worst at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Inez, I hope you'll excuse me. I can't understand what
has happened, but you must come back with me."</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she repeated, resting her hand heavily on a
table near her.</p>

<p>Startled by her stern tone and manner, the old man spoke more
quietly.</p>

<p>"This morning, Miss Inez," said he, "not long ago, a fly stopped
at the door just as I was crossing the hall. A very pretty
foreign-looking lady got out, and, in rather broken English, asked
if the Signor Angelo Egerton had arrived yet&mdash;whether he was
at home? 'No, ma'am,' says I; 'but you can see his ward, Miss de
Caldara, who manages everything;' and I showed her into the
morning-room, and followed her to question her, for you see how she
might have been a swindler, or something bad. So I told her very
politely that I should be obliged to her for her name, in order to
send for you. Then she up and said, very agitated like, 'Send for
this signora directly, then, for I am ill, and tell her I am Lady
Egerton, Sir Angelo's wife.' 'Ma'am, that's impossible,' says I,
flatly. Oh, Miss Inez," he exclaimed, "how ghastly you look! Is
what she says true?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Spaniard, touching him. "No, my faithful Burns,
it is a mistake; but keep your own counsel. You have, I see,
brought a carriage. I will join you directly."</p>

<p>She left the room, and for some ten minutes Burns was alone;
then she returned dressed, and he followed her.</p>

<p>Julian Rothesay stood at the carriage door; he handed her in,
sprang in himself, and bade Burns drive fast, and the noble grays
did their part so well that in a very short time they reached St.
James' Square.</p>

<p>"Now, Burn's," said Inez, "I will go up to the library, and you
show this lady up to me there."</p>

<p>She and Julian ascended the staircase; he went into her own
boudoir, and she entered the library, which was opposite.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a lady closely veiled entered. It was a
strange and trying position for Inez&mdash;she herself all but
Egerton's wife, and confronting a woman who claimed that
position&mdash;but even then her natural self-control did not fail
her; but before she could speak the stranger threw back her veil,
disclosing, to Inez's utter surprise, the soft, Madonna-like face
of Genevra della Scala.</p>

<p>"Surely we have met before," exclaimed the Italian in her own
language; "there is something in your face that I remember. Oh,
signora! tell me, in mercy, where my husband, Angelo Egerton,
is."</p>

<p>"Signora," said the Castilian, gently, and in the same tongue,
"you are the victim of some strange mistake. Sir Angelo Egerton is
unmarried; and, moreover, he never saw you in his life."</p>

<p>"Never saw me!" repeated the Italian, passionately. "You stand
there so calmly and tell me that! Listen, signora. He came to
Bologna, and on the strength of a former acquaintance in travelling
he came to my aunt's house; he won my heart, and last June we were
married. He was kind at first, but more than a month ago he left me
suddenly. I pass over my despair. I had money and jewels, and when
days became weeks, and he did not return, I became convinced that
he had deserted me, and returned to England."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then went on in a more agitated
manner.</p>

<p>"I determined to claim and vindicate my rights for the sake of
my unborn child, and I came to England, and straight on to your
city of London; for I remembered his saying that his house was
here&mdash;at your great station near the river."</p>

<p>"London Bridge," said Inez.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said the Italian. "Well, there I asked the Inspector,
as they called him, and asked him how I could find the address of a
person in London, for I thought he must know. He was very kind,
seeing that I was a foreigner, and alone, and he asked me who I
wanted. I told him the Signor Angelo Egerton, and he asked me if I
meant Sir Angelo Egerton, the member of Parliament? I said 'Yes, it
must, be the same;' and then he took me into an office and looked
in a huge large book which he called a Directory, and then put me
and all I had in a carriage, and told the coachman to drive the
lady to Sir Angelo Egerton's, St. James's Square."</p>

<p>She had spoken so rapidly and incoherently, half in broken
English, half in Italian, and that not the pure Tuscan which Inez
spoke, and was so agitated, that it required all the Castilian's
attention to follow her; and when the unfortunate lady ended with a
passionate burst of tears, Inez for a moment hardly knew what to
say or do, for she had as much dislike to 'a scene' as any man ever
had. She hesitated only a moment, and then she bent over Genevra,
and soothed her as only a woman can, till she grew more calm, and
then Inez spoke.</p>

<p>"Your story is a sad one; you have been cruelly deceived and
forsaken, but not by Angelo Egerton. Look at this, and say whether
your husband was like it."</p>

<p>There was several photographs on the mantelpiece; she opened it
and held it out.</p>

<p>"This is Angelo Egerton, signora," said Inez. "Does that face
look like the face of a man who could be false to all faith and
honor?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Oh! Holy Mother! have pity on me!" cried the Italian.
"This man has deep sad gray eyes, and hair as black as yours; and
my husband had black eyes and beautiful strange-looking golden
hair, dark, but burnished."</p>

<p>Inez started, and turned ghastly white, and for a moment
everything seemed black darkness&mdash;black with the utter sense
of misery that had fallen on her in that moment. The whole truth
flashed across her&mdash;ay, worse than the truth. Arthur Vivian
had discovered Egerton's pursuit, murdered him, and taken his name
to deceive the poor girl, who was another victim of his reckless
villainy! But she was too proud to let a stranger see her agony;
and stern self-command had so completely grown a second nature,
that in a moment she recovered her calmness. "Listen," she said.
"Should you know a picture of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ah, yes, signora," she replied.</p>

<p>"Here is one," said Inez, taking from the mantelpiece a
photograph of the portrait. "Is this your husband?"</p>

<p>Genevra took it, and gazed at it with dilating eyes and
quivering lips; then she threw it from her, and clasped her hands
on her brow.</p>

<p>"It is! it is! Who and what is he? and what am I?"</p>

<p>Inez took both her hands in her own. "Look at me," she said,
quietly and firmly, "and tell me, Genevra, were you married openly
and fairly in the Romish Church, and by a priest. Be calm, for you
injure yourself by such agitation. Now, tell me."</p>

<p>"It was in the Church of Our Lady that we were married," she
replied; "openly and fairly, according to the Catholic rites, for
he belonged to our Church."</p>

<p>"To your Church&mdash;he is an Atheist; but you are his wedded
wife," said Inez.</p>

<p>"His name?" she asked. "Tell me his name, and all you know of
him."</p>

<p>"Is it for me to blacken a husband to his wife?" said the
Spaniard, recoiling. "Enough that his name is Arthur Vivian, and
that I know no good of him. He has been a bitter enemy to me and
mine."</p>

<p>"I am alone and forlorn&mdash;a stranger to your land; but this
house is no place for his wife," said the Italian, rising.</p>

<p>"Genevra!" said Inez.</p>

<p>She turned&mdash;threw her arms round Inez, clinging to her
almost like a child to its mother; laid her head against her, and
wept as only the broken-hearted weep.</p>

<p>Gently and tenderly Inez soothed the poor Italian, and then
bidding her wait a moment, and she would bring an old acquaintance,
she left the room.</p>

<p>Nearly ten minutes elapsed, and then Inez returned with Julian
Rothesay.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter 40.</h2>

<p>Julian Rothesay and Inez had very readily decided what to do
with Genevra Vivian, as we must now call her. As she expressed her
determination to remain in England, they decided to place her in
apartments suitable to her means, which the disposal of her
valuable jewels would make comfortable. Inez happened to know a
very worthy couple, whom she had once befriended&mdash;old
tradesmen of Sir Angelo's&mdash;who had lodgings to let, and there
she placed the unfortunate Italian, engaging a sister of Mrs.
Slater as her personal attendant.</p>

<p>Inez had a most painful and distressing scene to go through with
Genevra; for before they left Slater's house, Julian drew her
aside, and told her that she must at once tell Mrs. Vivian that her
husband was under an accusation of murder. "She had better hear it
gently," he very truly said, "than suddenly, as she certainly would
whenever Arthur was taken, and that might come any day;" and Inez
could not but think him right, and she did tell the unfortunate
wife as gently as possible, and although she bore it better than
she had feared, Inez told Julian that it had been the most trying
scene she had ever gone through.</p>

<p>The next day Julian and his young wife left for the North, and
in the evening Lady Alice came to fetch Margaret to spend the
evening with her. She wanted Inez to go too, but Inez said she must
go over to St James' Square, as she had an appointment with
Egerton's solicitor, Mr. Seymour, on business relating to
Falcontower.</p>

<p>The truth was that the poor child was worn out and ill; constant
wearing sorrow and sickening anxiety had begun at last to tell upon
her, and she shrunk from anything like society; so she was glad
when she found herself once more seated in the old library, with
Leon at her feet, and the grand paintings of the old masters
looking down from the walls on her.</p>

<p>Mr. Seymour came soon after her arrival, but the business he had
to transact was soon done, and then she was alone again. Alone, for
a long time so buried in painful, anxious thought that she did not
even hear a carriage stop, followed by a knock at the door, and
then voices speaking; then the door opened, and a tall dark figure
entered, so silently that she did not hear any footfall, but it was
rather that indefinite impression that some one was present which
made her rise quickly and turn.</p>

<p>"Angelo!"</p>

<p>"Inez, my little one, my darling!"</p>

<p>She was folded in his arms, close, close to his breast, in a
clasp no human power could have loosed, and in that moment all the
suffering and sorrow they had gone through was forgotten, save as a
dark dream that was past.</p>

<p>He did not speak, he could not, till at last he held her off to
gaze into the face he so deeply loved.</p>

<p>"Inez, Inez, how this dear face has changed&mdash;how ill and
worn it looks!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Angelo, the strongest flower will wither when the hand that
cherished it is gone," said Inez, touchingly.</p>

<p>He half smiled, and sat down in the seat she had left, and Inez
knelt at his feet and laid her head against him, as she had done
when a child, winding her slender fingers round his hand with the
old, tender, clinging action.</p>

<p>"Angelo, you too are changed; this grave brow has more lines,
and this raven hair more gray than it had five months ago."</p>

<p>"Look at neither now, my little one," said Egerton, gently,
drawing her head down on his breast again, and tenderly smoothing
her dark tresses. "My journey has been a fruitless and very nearly
a fatal one. Let it be forgotten. A page in my life
obliterated."</p>

<p>"It cannot be, Angelo. A page once read can never be forgotten,
and it is one I have not yet read. Ah, Angelo, it has been such a
dark dream!"</p>

<p>"Poor child, poor little one! I have learned from Burns all that
has happened here, and I know what you have suffered."</p>

<p>He did not even ask her if she had believed in his marriage,
though the proofs of it had been so great as to have made it almost
pardonable to do so. But she understood him, and pressed her lips
to his hand, while a bright tear glittered in her eye and fell; but
presently she said, "You cannot know everything, for the worst only
Julian and I know. Angelo, read me your page, and I will tell you
mine."</p>

<p>"It is shortly told, Inez; it is a rough chain that has bound
us, if possible, closer together."</p>

<p>Then he told her how he had discovered Vivian, by passing him
one night in the company of one Alfieri; how he had then, disguised
as a Spaniard, Carlos de Alava, got hold of Alfieri, and bribed him
to introduce him amongst the conspirators, pledging himself not to
betray them, and then how, at the very moment when Arthur seemed in
his power, he was made a prisoner by the police, with all but
Vivian.</p>

<p>"He managed to escape," said Egerton. "They say the devil takes
care of his own. He had not recognised me till I spoke, but I saw
him start slightly when I did so. Well, I was of course thrown into
prison, and I tell you, Inez, I can understand now, by bitter
experience, what the Bastille, Chatelet, or Chateau d'Eu were. I
had no trial&mdash;I was brought before no tribunal, and when I
stated that I was no Spaniard or conspirator, but an Englishman,
and a subject of the Queen's, with a right of appeal to the English
ambassador, they disbelieved me. I did not give my name, because I
did not, and do not wish, or intend it to be known, what had
passed. They told me that they had received notice that the
Spaniard would try and pass for an Inglese. That shaft came from
Vivian, I am sure. It is true my darkness and somewhat Spanish
appearance told against me, for these foreigners think that all
English people are fair. Still, I could see that they so far
thought it possible that my statement of being an Englishman of
rank might be true, that they did not venture to execute me as they
did the rest, but contented themselves with keeping me a prisoner.
I offered my jailor bribes to convey a letter to our ambassador,
but he said he dared not for his life do it. My child, those five
months of captivity have been years of misery. But God was
gracious, and I escaped at last. Some new governor or commandant
came, who made me pay a heavy fine or bribe, and quietly released
me. Oh, Inez, no one can thoroughly love freedom who has not
endured captivity."</p>

<p>She nestled closer to him, and whispered gently, "'Let the dead
past bury its dead.' Let that dark page be forgotten, save as
another link between us."</p>

<p>The strong man bowed his head, and tears fell on her upturned
face. He had never loved her so well as then, for the sorrow they
had just gone through had bound them, as he had said, yet
closer&mdash;if that were possible.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>Chapter 41.</h2>

<p>There was plenty for Egerton to do. He had, as he said, smiling,
his constituents to address and appease for his long absence, and
various other business matters to attend to. Of course, the night
before, Inez had told him all that had taken place in his absence,
and the first thing he did the next morning was to write to Julian
a few lines to ask him and his wife, and Rochester, and Marion, to
go over to Falcontower the next day. Inez would be there to receive
them, and he himself would join them from Cambridge the evening of
the day after. Any one who did not know the man, to have read the
letter would have thought him the coldest possible person, who did
not care for Julian at all. The next thing was to drive round to
Seymour-street, and, after remaining a short while with Inez and
Margaret, who warmly and affectionately welcomed him, he went with
Inez to see Genevra Vivian, who had been so cruelly deceived by his
name. It was a courtesy which his high chivalry instinctively gave
to an unfortunate lady, who had, however unwittingly on his part,
been injured through and in his name.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Margaret was to get all ready for hers and Inez's
immediate departure for the North, under the escort of old Wylde
and the Castilian's maid, a respectable and matronly woman, who had
for many years been her attendant. So they went down to Falcontower
Castle, leaving Angelo to join them there.</p>

<p>The next morning Julian, Isbel, and the Rochesters arrived at
the castle, and for the first time Austin Rochester crossed the
threshhold of the first and only man who had ever befriended
him.</p>

<p>The night that Egerton was expected was a fine frosty moonlight
night, and Julian and Austin walked down to the station to meet
him.</p>

<p>"We are only a little too early," remarked the latter, as they
passed through on to the platform. "He comes from Cambridge,
doesn't he, Julian?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Inez, you know, told us that he had to see his
constituents."</p>

<p>"Ah, of course," said Rochester. "By the way, did you see a
canard in this morning's paper about him?"</p>

<p>"No, what was it, Rochester?"</p>

<p>"Only that in announcing the return of 'the young statesman, Sir
Angelo Egerton,' they were pleased to assign a reason for his long
absence during the session, which reason, they said, was 'a secret
political mission abroad.'"</p>

<p>Julian laughed, and said, "They'll contradict it again
to-morrow, when they find in his speech at Cambridge that 'urgent
and most strictly private family affairs which had required his
departure at a moment's notice, had been the cause of his
unavoidable absence;' and he is such a favorite that they will
accept his excuse, which is the true one, after all. So," he added,
laughing, "they call him a young statesman, do they? He is eight
and thirty, and he took his first seat in Parliament when he was
twenty-one. He is a statesman of seventeen years' standing."</p>

<p>Austin sighed, for those seventeen years he had worse than
wasted.</p>

<p>"Look, Austin, the train is coming in."</p>

<p>"Is he in it, I wonder?" said Rochester.</p>

<p>The train stopped as he spoke, and several people got out. The
tall form of Egerton was conspicuous amongst them, and Julian
stepped forwards, and the silent iron clasp of their hands spoke
more of the deep strong love between them than language could have
done. Neither spoke, but Julian linked his arm in Egerton's, and
passed out to where Austin stood apart awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Here is some one you knew long ago," said Julian, stopping.</p>

<p>"Has Angelo Egerton forgotten Austin Rochester?" asked
Austin.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, and Egerton held out the same friendly hand
that years ago had been tendered in vain. "No, Austin Rochester, I
have never forgotten you. Welcome to Falcontower&mdash;thrice
welcome home."</p>

<p>He paused for no reply, and they walked on to the castle.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That night, in the same gloomy old library where, nearly a year
before, the stern proud man had wept bitter tears of agony for the
loss of his child-love, and the friend of his youth had whispered
"Hope! thy child-love lives for thee!" in that ancient room the
same two friends sat alone long after all else were sleeping.</p>

<p>"There is a fate against me and a doom upon me," said Julian.
"All our attempts to take this black villain have failed."</p>

<p>"Not all, Julian," said Angelo, gently; "you forget the
portrait. I am as convinced as that I am sitting here that that
portrait, and it alone, will be the means of Vivian's discovery.
Dear Julian, you have not been upheld for ten years to fall at
last."</p>

<p>"Angelo, you are right. It cannot be that God will uphold
injustice."</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then Egerton said, "There is a thing I
want to speak to you about, and that is dear Marion and her
husband. His estates are mortgaged to that Fakes we know too well,
and Rochester literally has only two hundred a year he can call his
own; it will never do, Julian, for the present state of things to
last, the money coming from his wife; it must inevitably end in
more misery, perhaps a second separation."</p>

<p>"I have thought of it, Angelo, but deferred acting until your
return," said Julian, "Have you any plan? You know in all these
years I have spent so little of my income that it has accumulated
in your care to enough to do more than release his estate, and who
has so good a right as I&mdash;his wife's son?"</p>

<p>"I have," replied Egerton, "and I claim the right to halve it
with you, Julian; for if Marion is your mother, she is my dear
sister; and moreover, there is a tie between Austin and me which
would make him almost sooner take a service from me than you."</p>

<p>Julian smiled, and said, "As you will, Angelo. What is the
amount of the mortgage that rascal Fakes holds?"</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand pounds at the least," he replied. "My plan is
simply to go to Fakes with the money in my hand, and buy the
mortgage deeds of him, and burn them in Rochester's presence."</p>

<p>"Will he let us do it?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"He can't help himself, if we will do it. The deeds once in my
hands, he can't compel me to return them to Fakes; nor can he make
you and me receive money of him if we don't choose. I tell you
plainly it is more for dear Marion's sake than his, though it is a
great deal for himself, too, for I like him in spite of his faults.
I think I had better manage it as I suggest with Fakes."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Julian; "besides, you must draw my ten
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I have always placed it with separate bankers in my own
name. I will write tomorrow to Seymour, sending him the cheques and
necessary instructions to pay Fakes the mortgages, and make you and
me mortgagees instead."</p>

<p>The fourth night from that the mortgage deeds came, and in the
presence of Austin and his wife and daughter, and Julian, Egerton
told Austin what they were and flung them on the fire, and when
Rochester remonstrated and would fain have refused the gift, Julian
bowed his head on Marion's hand and answered, "It is my gift to my
mother. Let it rest."</p>

<p>Egerton turned his noble face to Rochester, and touching his
wife said, "She is my sister Marion, and through her son she has
suffered for my mother's death. Let me make to her and her husband
some reparation; let me have the pleasure of seeing her happy in
knowing that the inheritance of his fathers belongs to her husband
and his children."</p>

<p>How could Rochester refuse a gift which was made to appear an
obligation to the givers, and given throughout with such thoughtful
delicacy?</p>

<p>Ten days after the papers had the following announcement,
prefixed, of course, by the invariable 'Marriage in High
Life':&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have to announce the marriage of the Conservative leader in
the Lower House, Sir Angelo Rothesay Egerton, of Falcontower, M.P.
for Cambridge University, to Inez Jesuita Maria de Caldara, a young
Spanish lady, who has long been the ward of the right honorable
member. We understand that the fair bride is the only child of the
late Count de Caldara, and third cousin to Sir Angelo Egerton
through his mother, the late Lady Egerton. The marriage was
performed in the beautiful chapel of the castle by the Rev. Hugh
Bertram, rector of Falcontower, and in the presence of a solid
number of friends, amongst whom were the famous artist, Mr.
Rothesay (who gave away the bride), Mr. and Mrs. Rochester, of
Rochester Court, Lady Alice St. John, Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay, and
her father, Monsieur de Castelnau, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>So Inez de Caldara became Lady Egerton; so the child and maiden
became that sacred and holy thing, a wife.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Lady Alice, it is close upon 8, and time you came to dress for
Lady Egerton's."</p>

<p>So spoke Alice St. John's maid, who, having been with her some
twenty years, was a privileged person.</p>

<p>"Has Miss Arabella gone up yet, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, and so must you,"</p>

<p>Lady Alice rose, but at that moment a carriage of some sort
dashed up to the door, and was followed by a knock at the door,
which made the mother start, and say tremblingly, "Mary, that is my
son's knock; I am sure it is my son's knock."</p>

<p>"The colonel, ma'am? it can't be."</p>

<p>"Go, go, Mary, and see."</p>

<p>Mary hurried down stair. Lady Alice heard his well known voice;
his step bounded up the staircase, the door was pushed open, and
Alice St. John was clasped in her son's arms.</p>

<p>"My darling mother, how nice it is to see your sweet face
again!"</p>

<p>"My darling son, how nice it is to see your dear face
again!"</p>

<p>And then she turned him to the light, and put her hands on his
shoulders, and gazed into his eyes, as if she were reading his very
soul. They never dropped, but met hers with his old bright, joyous
smile.</p>

<p>"Dear mother," he said, kissing her forehead, "I read your look,
and your mother's heart may rest."</p>

<p>"My noble boy&mdash;my brave son&mdash;are you sure, can you
trust yourself entirely?"</p>

<p>"Mother, entirely&mdash;most perfectly. She is to me once again
the child I have known so long, and at the same time Egerton's
wife. You were going somewhere, mother, I can tell by a a hundred
little things; was it there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was, dear Louis; it is a select musical party, but we
will stay at home."</p>

<p>"No, mother, I will go with you," said Louis, quietly and
steadily; "the sooner I meet her the better, and I had rather meet
her in her husband's home and in her husband's presence, than away
from either."</p>

<p>"You are right, my son; we will go. Tell me first how it is we
have you to-night, instead of three days hence, as your letter
said?"</p>

<p>"We had a quick passage over," he replied; "and I hurried on
here on purpose to surprise you."</p>

<p>The entrance of his cousin Arabella interrupted him, and Lady
Alice went to dress, for though she would rather have had her son
at home that evening, she thought it better that he should meet
Inez at once.</p>

<p>"One thing let me say, Louis," whispered his mother, as they
drove off, "treat her with your former intimacy; call her Inez, not
Lady Egerton."</p>

<p>"Surely, dear mother, that must depend upon how she meets
me."</p>

<p>"Not entirely, Louis. But as you will."</p>

<p>"How comes it they are still in town, mother?"</p>

<p>"Still, Louis! Sir Angelo has been away from May till last
September, nearly two months ago, and then they were in the north,
for the marriage took place directly, and they only came up for the
proroguing of Parliament. I suppose he wished to show there, as he
had been away before."</p>

<p>"I heard one of my travelling companions say today," observed
St. John, "that the present ministry cannot survive next February,
as they would probably be defeated on their budget, or even on the
Queen's speech."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Lady Alice, as the carriage stopped, "I don't
understand these things, but I hope Egerton and his party will come
into office again."</p>

<p>Inez had not long risen from the piano, and was sitting near the
door, talking to Austin Rochester and his daughter, Mrs. Rothesay;
and, indeed, had just remarked how late Lady Alice was, when the
names of "Colonel, Lady Alice and Miss St. John," being announced
caught her ear, and made her look up in surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Colonel Louis!" she exclaimed, holding out her hand; and in her
frank, cordial action, and in her voice and manner, there was no
shade of embarrassment, nothing but the old friendly familiarity of
her childhood; "how glad I am to see you!"</p>

<p>And Egerton, stepping forward, grasped his hand with the simple
and expressive welcome&mdash;"Louis, old friend! welcome back to
England and home."</p>

<p>Quietly and keenly Lady Alice watched her son's face; but if for
a moment he had felt any embarrassment, neither his face nor his
manner showed it; and perfectly reassured, she sat down by lady
Egerton, and saw him introduced to Rochester, and then move on to
speak to Margaret Arundel and several other old acquaintances; nor
did even her mother's heart feel any anxiety when, later in the
evening, she heard him ask Inez to sing a song that he had been
fond of when she was a child&mdash;no, for she was Inez Egerton;
and the magic and holy name of wife had made his honorable nature
crush in a year a love which, but for that, might perhaps have been
long before it could be vanquished.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Four months have passed&mdash;the 'black winds of March' swept
drearily through the early spring air, and changes have taken place
in both the public and private affairs of this history. Whoever
Colonel St. John's travelling companion was his prediction had come
true, for the ministry then in office had alienated their own
friends, and when Parliament met in February they were defeated on
the Royal Speech, and not venturing to dissolve, they were obliged
to resign, and once more the Conservatives came into power, and now
again Angelo was in the cabinet. So much for public changes; now
pass from Downing-street or Westminster Palace to that handsome
West-end shop; there is a carriage before the door with the
armorial bearings of Egerton on it; but enter the house and pass up
stairs into a quiet room out of reach of the noise and bustle of
the vast city below it.</p>

<p>There is a matronly woman at work by the window, but on a couch
near the fire lies the form of Arthur Vivian's Italian wife&mdash;a
soft, bright smile on her sweet face as her eyes rest on an infant
who is lying on her breast, while leaning against the mantelpiece
is the tall slight form of Lady Egerton, but there is a shadow on
the dark beautiful face as her calm, watchful eyes also rest on the
child, and mark that he has his father's golden hair and black
eyes, and will, one day, have his fatal beauty. The mother is
thinking the same, too, for presently she looks up and says in her
own tongue, "Inez, he is so like Arthur, I wish&mdash;" She paused,
something was on her mind that it seemed painful to say.</p>

<p>"What is it, Genevra?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Inez, he didn't do it! You told me he was only
accused&mdash;he didn't do it!"</p>

<p>"Genevra, do not ask me. If I were to tell you all I know and
all I have done, you would never again look on my face, but would
turn from me with hatred and loathing."</p>

<p>"From you!" said Genevra, almost passionately, and with
characteristic impetuosity. "Never! Nothing could make me do
anything but love you with the deepest gratitude&mdash;nothing you
could tell me could alter that."</p>

<p>"Nothing?" said Inez. "Well, as you will, Genevra&mdash;you may
try the test. Look at my hair, here and there it has gray amongst
it, and for ten years it has been there; you have yourself wondered
to see how in my teens I am so grave and passionless, so
prematurely old, in plain terms. I was so from six years old, and
what think you changed my childhood into sorrow and years that time
had not added, what, but the death of the only mother I had ever
known? More, because I witnessed her murder&mdash;I saw him
escaping, and it is my evidence almost entirely that will convict
Vivian. It is I who, after years of patient watching, discovered
him, and found means of obtaining proofs against him; my lips will,
so to say, sign his death warrant. Not for vengeance did I act, but
because another man suffered, ay, suffers still, for his
crime&mdash;a man who can only be cleared by Vivian's conviction.
Now, Genevra, can you truly repeat your words?"</p>

<p>Genevra's answer was to clasp Inez's hand, and press her lips to
it.</p>

<p>"Inez, bitter as it is to me, you have only acted for the ends
of justice, and nothing can undo the debt of gratitude I owe to
you."</p>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter 43.</h2>

<p>Amongst the crowd ascending the steps of the National Gallery
one fine morning towards the end of March was our old friend,
Colonel St. John. As he entered the first room, he at once
perceived a figure which he recognised as that of old Mr. Bertram,
of Falcontower, whom he had met at the Egertons'; and the colonel
walked up to and addressed him.</p>

<p>The rector turned quickly, paused a moment, and then with a
smile of recognition, held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Colonel St. John, how glad I am to see you," he said,
cordially. "I was coming to call on you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I hold you to your intention, Mr. Bertram," said the colonel,
"you must come to dinner. Are you living in town?" he added.</p>

<p>"No, I am only here for a short while on some private business,"
was the reply. "I am staying with my old friend, Sir Angelo
Egerton; and this morning I determined to spend here, as it is some
years since I have been to see the gallery."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the colonel, "then you have not seen that
magnificent picture of Rothesay's, 'Tekel.'"</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "I have heard of it, and I am most anxious to
see it. Which room is it in?"</p>

<p>"Further on," said the colonel. "Shall we move on?"</p>

<p>"If you please," said Mr. Bertram.</p>

<p>They moved forward through several rooms till the colonel
stopped. "Now, turn," he said, "here it hangs."</p>

<p>The portrait was striking enough to startle any one coming so
suddenly upon it, but even that hardly accounted for the start
which the rector gave, and the deathly pallor which for a moment
overspread his face, and he stood bending forwards looking on it
with an intensity in his strained gaze which did not escape the
colonel, though he naturally enough set it down to the effect of
the picture, and presently he said, in a low voice, "Is it not
horribly beautiful? One need hardly to be told that it has some
strange history belonging to it."</p>

<p>Hugh Bertram turned to him, and said in a voice resolutely calm
and suppressed, as though he feared to trust it, "Has it a history?
That phantom's face is as the face of Inez Egerton in a dream; the
other, why has it the scroll Tekel on it, in fiery
letters&mdash;what is the history of that picture?"</p>

<p>"I do not know it all, only partly," said the colonel. "It is
not a mere picture; it is a portrait of a living man, and as it was
not told me as a secret, I may say it. You know that this belongs
to Egerton, and was painted by his order?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Bertram. "Who is it of?"</p>

<p>"His mother's murderer," said the colonel. "He told me so
himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Bertram did not start now; the blow had gone too deep for
language or outward sign, he stood for a few minutes with his eyes
still fixed on the portrait, but seeing nothing and hearing
nothing, and then by a strong effort he recovered himself, and
touching the colonel, said quietly, "I do not feel very well. I
shall return home."</p>

<p>"I hope you are not ill," said Colonel St. John, anxiously. "My
carriage is at your service."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Bertram; "but I have Lady Egerton's
carriage outside," and with a polite bow he disappeared in the
crowd.</p>

<p>It was some time before, in returning, the colonel again entered
the room where the picture hung. There was, for a wonder, only one
person standing before it, and naturally St. John noticed him more
than he otherwise would. He was rather tall, and slight and
elegant, as far as a heavy cloak showed his figure; but that would
not have attracted the colonel's notice so much, and he was passing
in when a slight noise made the stranger turn sharply.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment, only for a minute that he saw his
face, but that fleeting glance was enough for the colonel&mdash;the
face, with its devilish beauty, the lurid black eyes and glistening
golden hair could not be mistaken&mdash;he was the original of the
portrait, he was the murderer of Jesuita Egerton, and St. John's
resolve was instantly taken.</p>

<p>He walked quietly on into the next room, so that the stranger
could not leave the gallery without his seeing him, and then he sat
down and looked anxiously round.</p>

<p>An intelligent-looking lad, apparently a shop or errand boy, was
surveying one of the pictures with a look of profound admiration.
St. John called him. "My lad, come here." The boy obeyed. "Will you
like to earn half-a-crown?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the ready reply.</p>

<p>"Then take this slip of paper to the police office, Scotland
Yard," continued Louis. "Go in a cab, and tell the man to drive for
life or death; promise him double fare, and return to me."</p>

<p>He tore a leaf from his pocket-book, wrote a few lines
requesting the immediate presence of Harding the detective, and
gave it the boy, who ran off in a moment.</p>

<p>Perhaps twenty or five and twenty minutes elapsed, and then his
messenger and a gentlemanly looking man in black entered, and came
up to him, and addressed him in a quiet business-like manner.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, sir, that Mr. Vivian is here?"</p>

<p>"So far sure," said the colonel, "that the man I mean is the
exact counterpart of that portrait here, called 'Tekel.'"</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you, sir, for what you have done. Leave all the
rest to me; he won't escape me again."</p>

<p>Harding went with him to the entrance; there was a cab there
with another policeman in plain clothes. Harding spoke a few words
to him, and took up his position in such a way that Vivian's escape
was impossible.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hugh Bertram had returned to St. James' Square. He was
told that every one was away. Sir Angelo had not yet come home from
the Foreign-office, Lady Egerton had gone into the park with Mr.
Rothesay, and only ten minutes before Miss Arundel had gone out
with Lady Alice St. John. The rector said no more, but went up
stairs, only leaving orders that when either Sir Angelo or Lady
Egerton came in, they were to be told he wished to see them.</p>

<p>He did not have very long to wait before he saw from the window
Julian Rothesay and Inez, and Egerton, whom they had probably met,
ride up together, and all three entered the house, for Julian was
going to stay to dinner, and then go with Angelo down to the
house.</p>

<p>Almost immediately Egerton appeared in the drawing-room, where
the rector was waiting.</p>

<p>"You wish to see me, they told me," he said.</p>

<p>"I do, Egerton&mdash;about that picture&mdash;that portrait in
the National Gallery."</p>

<p>He paused, striving to master his agitation, and Egerton said,
"Who told you that it was a portrait?"</p>

<p>"Colonel St. John. I met him there. He asserted on your
authority, that it is the portrait of your&mdash;of the man who
murdered your mother. Answer me truly, Egerton, in mercy&mdash;is
it true or false?"</p>

<p>Like iron on his heart fell the words, "It is."</p>

<p>A silence then. "What is the name of the person who killed
her?"</p>

<p>"Arthur Vivian."</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said a servant, opening the door, "Colonel
St. John is below, and wishes to see you for five minutes."</p>

<p>Egerton left the room, but in less than five minutes the rector
heard a carriage drive away, and Angelo came back.</p>

<p>Hugh Bertram addressed him at once.</p>

<p>"St. John's coming is connected with the person we spoke of,
Egerton. Tell me the worst&mdash;in pity tell me the worst at
once."</p>

<p>"Arthur Vivian is taken at last," said Egerton.</p>

<p>"Oh, merciful heaven, how can I bear it!&mdash;how can I bear
it!" said the rector, covering his face with his clasped hands, and
burning tears fell through his fingers.</p>

<p>"Hugh Bertram, what is Arthur Vivian to you?"</p>

<p>"My son&mdash;my only son!"</p>

<p>"God help you!" said Egerton, bowing his head, and his stern lip
quivered.</p>

<p>There was a dead stillness, and then the father rose up.</p>

<p>"Egerton you are a stern and severe man; but, by the love you
bore your dead mother,&mdash;by all your hopes of mercy at the Last
Day, show some mercy now, and spare my wretched, guilty son, whose
death cannot restore your mother to you."</p>

<p>There was a depth and intensity of agony in the father's
passionate appeal that touched Egerton to the very soul. He lifted
his head, and the musical tones, usually so firm, were unsteady, as
he answered, "Hear me, and do not lightly judge me a hard and
merciless man. All these years another man has borne the
stain&mdash;the conviction of that murder; one whom I love with
almost more than a brother's love; but for that I had never so
relentlessly pursued Vivian; but for that, I would now, for your
sake, and for the sake of his wife and child, spare him. Can I do
so when the life of an innocent man is in the balance, and
depending on his conviction? Could I have acted&mdash;could I now
act otherwise?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Bertram, with sudden calmness, "You could only
have done what you have done. Oh, Egerton, is there no hope? Was
not your wife mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Egerton. "Eight years after the murder my wife
drew the crayon drawing from which the portrait is done&mdash;drew
it from memory. There is no hope."</p>

<p>"One thing more I ask," said Mr. Bertram. "Where is this wife
and child? Tell me all you know of them, for at least I can take
them to my heart. Wifeless and childless, I must love
something."</p>

<p>Gently Egerton told him all he knew of Genevra, and ended by
promising that early the next morning his wife should take him to
her and tell her who he was.</p>

<p>Sorrow had laid a stern and heavy hand on Hugh Bertram.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>Chapter 44.</h2>

<p>"Nelly, my good girl, you are a laggard this morning. I have
rung twice," were the words Marion Rochester addressed to her maid,
Nelly Warren, the morning after Vivian's examination before a
magistrate. "What detained you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, ma'am, I am sorry I didn't hear your first bell, but I
was reading the Times."</p>

<p>"The Times!" said her mistress, half smiling. "And what were you
reading?"</p>

<p>"The account, ma'am, of the examination of Vivian
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Marion, quickly, "I am going to Lady Egerton's. How
did it end?"</p>

<p>"He is committed for trial, ma'am; but he made a queer
defence&mdash;what they call an alibi. His lawyer said that he
could prove that Vivian was at the other end of the town at the
hour the murder was committed, which was done exactly at 12
o'clock&mdash;so Lady Egerton said."</p>

<p>"How did the others try and prove the alibi?" asked Marion.</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am, they said that he was lodging at a house near St.
Catherine's Church (hard by where we used to live), in Kent Town,
and that it struck 12 as he came in; but I remember, and so do
mother and father, that that clock was slow that night, and what's
more, ma'am, a gentleman was lodging with us, named Everard, a
gunsmith, and he proved by his watch that the clock was wrong. I
remember that night particularly, because a servant left us very
suddenly that morning."</p>

<p>"Your father and Mr. Everard?" repeated Mrs. Rochester, "and can
you swear to all this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; is it evidence?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Give me your father's address, Nelly."</p>

<p>"Lady Egerton knows it, ma'am. You know she was at father's
nearly two years ago, when she was stabbed by this very man."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs. Rochester, "I remember that she was
there. Get me my bonnet and shawl, Nelly, for the sooner they know
of this the better."</p>

<p>And while the busy hum and whirl of life went on without, Arthur
Vivian&mdash;the handsome Arthur Vivian, sat alone&mdash;a prisoner
within the gloomy walls of Newgate; alone with his dark atheism and
remorse, and black load of guilt. He had refused to see his father
or wife, resisting all their entreaties. He had enough of remorse
and shame to shrink from meeting those he had so wronged. And so he
sat there awaiting his trial, which was to come on in the second
week of April.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was now four months since Louis St. John had returned to
England. His love for Inez had died&mdash;passed away 'as a tale
that is told;' as he himself said to his mother, he could not love
another man's wife; but it had left a void, a blank in his heart.
So he felt when he returned to England with his regiment, and again
met Margaret Arundel in the house of Angelo Egerton.</p>

<p>In person, in character, in everything, Margaret was a direct
contrast to the Spaniard, and this very contrast and difference was
the first thing which attracted St. John to her; it was a relief,
but withal he was somewhat surprised to find that gradually her
sweet fair face was constantly in his thoughts and memory.
Unconsciously she had wound herself round his heart, and if his
affection for her was not the same passionate love he had borne
Inez, it was firmer, deeper, stronger, and lasting.</p>

<p>And so one day be told Margaret how he loved her; he concealed
nothing, but honorably told her all, and then he learned how long
and faithfully she had loved him.</p>

<p>Once again Louis St. John stood before Angelo Egerton, and asked
him for a bride, and this time there was no shadow on that handsome
face as he placed her hand in Louis', and said with his beautiful
smile, "Take her, old friend, as a priceless treasure, for a
true-hearted woman is God's own gift."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>Chapter 45.</h2>

<p>Never, perhaps, had the Central Criminal Court been more crowded
than it was on the 12th April, 18&mdash;; and that not merely with
'the vulgar herd,' but peers, and peeresses, and many M.P.'s had
not disdained to show themselves there. The length of time elapsing
between the murder and the arrest of the accused man, the strange
circumstances of the whole thing, including the important history
of the portrait, which had been the means of his capture, and above
all, the high rank and fame of those most nearly
concerned&mdash;one a statesman of fame and a minister, and Julian
Rothesay, the artist of the portrait&mdash;all these things had
made the trial of Arthur Vivian an exciting one.</p>

<p>Long before it was called on you might have seen, in a distant
corner, where they could see without being noticed, a gray haired
man in clerical dress, and a young lady with a child in her arms.
No one noticed them, and no one guessed who they were.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Seton, the attorney-general, with an eminent criminal
law counsel, had been retained for the prosecution, and for the
prisoner were retained men of almost equal eminence Mr. Beresford,
Q.C., and his junior, Mr. Hargrave.</p>

<p>Hugh Bertram saw them come in before the case was called, and he
noticed too that nearly all those he had met at Falcontower Castle
were there already&mdash;the St. Johns, and Walter Surrey, and Mrs.
Rochester, with a gentleman whom he rightly guessed to be her
husband. Then he saw a venerable looking old gentleman enter,
leaning on the arm of a young girl in black, whom he recognised as
the Miss Herbert he had met in the north. They passed on and spoke
to Mrs. Rochester, who placed the old man beside her; and while the
rector was watching them a murmur near the door made him turn to
see Angelo Egerton come in with his young wife and Margaret
Arundel, followed by Julian and Isbel Rothesay. They passed quietly
through the crowd and took their places with the rest, near their
solicitor and counsel, and their witnesses, who were seven in
number&mdash;old Mr. Everard, the gunsmith; a Mr. Morley, a well
known London clockmaker; his foreman; Sam Warren and his wife; and
a Brightstone boatman; and the surgeon who attended Inez. On the
opposite side were only Vivian's solicitor, and four witnesses,
whom it will be better to name in their turn as they appear.</p>

<p>A few more moments and then the long-expected trial was called
on, and the next minute Arthur Vivian appeared, his slight, elegant
figure erect, and his gleaming black eyes and handsome countenance
hard and set in all its dark and evil beauty boldly facing them
all, so like the portrait (which thousands had been to see since
his examination) that a visible effect was produced. A murmur arose
which was instantly repressed; the indictment was read; and the
question how the prisoner pleaded, asked.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Vivian leaned slightly forward,
glanced round, and answered clearly and deliberately, "Not
guilty!"</p>

<p>As the words passed his lips, his eyes met Inez Egerton's fixed
on him with that watchful steady gaze he remembered so well, and
dreaded even now so much, and he turned aside with a fiercely
muttered curse; but the voice of the Attorney-general made him look
up again.</p>

<p>"I appear, my lord, for the prosecution."</p>

<p>Then the case fairly commenced by the Attorney-general opening
it in a very concise speech, stating all the facts.</p>

<p>He said that nearly ten years and a half before, in the August
of the year 18&mdash;, the deceased, Jesuita Maria Lady Egerton,
went to Brightstone with her son and his ward, Inez de Caldara,
then six years of age; and Sir Angelo took a house at the corner of
Brunswick-terrace, almost opposite to the Catholic chapel of Our
Lady in Walter-street, into which street he begged it to be
remembered the window of the deceased lady's bed-chamber looked;
also that an agile person could ascend or descend from it to the
street by means of stuccoed facings, which were up the house and
close to the window. The child was accustomed to sleep in Lady
Egerton's own room, in a crib in the corner near the bed; and on
the night of the 21st of September she (the little girl) was put to
bed as usual. Lady Egerton and her son had been that evening to an
evening concert, but they returned home before eleven. Sir Angelo
remained in his study, reading; but his mother, the deceased, went
to bed; and being tired, she did not put away the jewels she had
on, but merely placed them in their casket, and left them on an
ottoman close to the window. The jewels, the learned council said,
should be produced.</p>

<p>The child, Inez de Caldara, was awakened by a shriek and the
report of a pistol, and she distinctly saw a man escaping out of
the window. Sir Angelo also heard the report, and subsequently the
bullet was extracted from the body of the deceased. Beneath the
window a man, an Italian named Giulio Doria, was seized, and at the
same time the clock of St. Mary's struck twelve. He wished to call
particular attention to that fact. In the hand of the prisoner was
found a pistol, evidently having been just fired, and in his pocket
was found its fellow; the bullet fitted both, but the jewels stolen
were not on him; though, as the policeman had noticed a man running
away, he supposed him to be an accomplice. Doria said that he had
been passing; that as he came up he saw a man run round the corner,
and that he saw the pistol on the ground, and had just picked it
up, when a cry of "Murder!" was raised and he was seized, but he
refused to give an account of himself at all, and was arrested for
the murder. But Sir Angelo, for private reasons, believed him
innocent, and the child, his ward, positively and persistently
swore that Doria was not the murderer. However, he was so
committed, though all attempts to trace the man seen flying failed.
Doria contrived to escape from prison, and was never retaken.</p>

<p>"And now, my lord and gentlemen of the jury," said the
attorney-general, "I am coming to the prisoner. Eight years passed,
Sir Angelo and his ward remaining convinced that the murderer was
still at large. Last January two years, Lady Egerton, then Miss de
Caldara (and with the lady's permission I will so call her for the
present), was sent to school at a place called Yellowfield, and
there she met a Miss Margaret Arundel, with whom she formed a close
friendship. So firmly were the features of the man she had seen
imprinted on her mind that, one day, Miss de Caldara drew his face
from memory in crayons. Miss Arundel saw it, and remarked that it
was exactly like her guardian's nephew, Arthur Vivian, and then
Miss de Caldara arranged with her friend that she was to spend the
holidays with her at her guardian's house, Forest Moor Grange. When
there she discovered, concealed in a column of an old cloister on
the premises, the jewels that had been stolen, and she also
convinced herself that the Arthur Vivian she met there was the
murderer she had seen eight years before. I may further add that
when the prisoner found she had taken the jewels he stabbed her,
left her for dead, and fled. The stiletto he used is now in court,
and it is remarkable that the deceased lady Egerton was, before
being shot, stabbed, and the wound pronounced by the physician to
be that made by a stiletto. I shall presently show the court that
one of the pistols was sold to the prisoner, the other to a
gentleman who, on the 21st of September, was passing for an
Italian, for reasons he will explain. The defence, I believe, is an
alibi, but I shall show the court that the clock of St. Mary's was
right to London time, and that of St. Catherine's ten minutes slow.
I shall now proceed to produce my proofs, and the first witness I
call is Lady Egerton."</p>

<p>Inez rose immediately, colorless as a beautiful marble statue,
but as calm and still. She had gone through too much to be unnerved
by the hundreds of eyes fixed upon her, and even the counsel for
the defence, experienced as he was in brow-beating witnesses,
glanced at her as she was sworn, and whispered to his solicitor, "I
am afraid she will not be shaken. Look at her face."</p>

<p>"Do your best," said the solicitor. "Hush now."</p>

<p>The attorney general was speaking. "Your name is Inez
Egerton?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And you were formerly the ward of Sir Angelo Egerton?"</p>

<p>"I was from the age of five years old, when he brought me over
from Spain."</p>

<p>"What was your maiden name?"</p>

<p>"Caldara&mdash;Inez de Caldara."</p>

<p>"Now, Lady Egerton, how far back can you remember minute events
or things?"</p>

<p>"I can remember things that occurred in Spain when I was four
years old. I can recollect my father's confessor, whom I left at
five years of age, so well that, a few years ago, when in Madrid, I
recognised him as he passed the window."</p>

<p>"Do you remember anything that happened in any particular
year?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember going to Brightstone in the August of
18&mdash;, with my guardian and my cousin Jesuita, the
deceased."</p>

<p>"Were you in Brightstone on the 21st of September?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you recollect anything that occurred that night?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"State what you remember."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Inca, and her voice throughout, though low
and soft, was heard in the farthest corner as clear and distinct as
a bell, "I remember that that evening Sir Angelo Egerton and his
mother were out at a concert. I was put to bed as usual at
half-past 8, and I went to sleep. I was awoke by a shriek and a
loud report, and I rose up in bed, and distinctly saw a man
escaping through the window."</p>

<p>"Did you see his face?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He looked back into the room, and I saw him as plainly as
I now see his lordship or any one else here."</p>

<p>"Now, Lady Egerton, look round and say whether you see that
man."</p>

<p>Inez raised her dark eyes, and her steady unflinching glance
went straight to Vivian, who shivered beneath it as if that look
withered him.</p>

<p>"The prisoner is the man I saw that night," she said, calmly and
firmly,</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive."</p>

<p>"Now look at this drawing"&mdash;he produced the
crayon&mdash;"it bears date June 27th, 18&mdash;, and is signed
Inez Jesuita Maria de Caldara, and a witness, Margaret Arundel. Is
the first your name?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Inez Jesuita Maria are my Christian names."</p>

<p>"It is written here that you drew it. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I drew it at school one half-holiday. I did it before I
ever again saw the man I had seen on the 21st of September
escaping."</p>

<p>"Did the lady whose name is here signed see you draw it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it was Margaret Arundel who told me it was her
guardian's nephew, Arthur Vivian; and then I arranged with her to
spend the holidays with her at Forest Moor, she engaging that his
wife, Eveline (who has since died), should ask me; then I
went."</p>

<p>"When did you go to Forest Moor?" asked the attorney-general,
after a pause, during which the crayon was handed up to the bench
and the jury.</p>

<p>"I went down on the 17th of August," answered Inez; "my
husband's solicitor, Mr. Seymour, can prove that, for he took me
down to the station, and put me into Mrs. Vivian's brougham."</p>

<p>"What did you do there, at Forest Moor?"</p>

<p>"I tried to find the stolen jewels, which I was convinced Arthur
Vivian had in his possession, because they were too marked to be
safely parted with. I searched everywhere in vain, till one night,
after I had been there six weeks, I found them concealed at the top
of a column of the cloisters, and I sent them in the morning to
town to my guardian."</p>

<p>"What happened that day?"</p>

<p>"The evening of that day I went to the bridge near the station
to wait for the train. It was getting dusk when the prisoner came
up to me there; and, after some words, charged me with falseness.
He said, 'You have taken a box from the cloisters;' and when I
acknowledged it, he drew a stiletto, and stabbed me."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"I know no more; the wound was nearly fatal."</p>

<p>"That will do for the present."</p>

<p>The judge leaned forwards, and asked, "Are those jewels, and the
stiletto, and pistols in court?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," answered Sir Henry, handing them up. "Mr.
Beresford, do you cross-examine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Henry!" and Beresford rose.</p>

<p>"Lady Egerton, how old were you at the time of the murder?"</p>

<p>"I was just six years old."</p>

<p>"Very young to remember so very distinctly," said Beresford,
with a sneer. "Perhaps, Lady Egerton, you can also remember how it
was that being in a crib in the corner, you could see the
window?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can explain; and if words are not plain enough, I
can in a minute give you a sketch of the room, to the accuracy of
which my husband can swear."</p>

<p>"Explain it, then, if you please."</p>

<p>"It is very simple. Lady Egerton's bed was so placed that the
foot was to the window, and my little crib was in the corner to the
left of the bed, looking from the window, so that by raising myself
even a little the whole of the window was plainly and broadly
visible."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Beresford," interposed the judge, mildly, "that
the witness has very clearly explained that point."</p>

<p>Beresford bowed, and turned again to Inez.</p>

<p>"You stated, I think, that the man you say you saw looked back,
and that you saw his face&mdash;now, how could you see him at
night?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Inez, with quiet irony, "that Mr. Beresford
has heard of such a thing as a light in a bed-chamber at night,
especially where children come in question. There was a lamp in the
room."</p>

<p>Beresford bit his lip, but went on. "Were you awoke
suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then you awoke, of course, in great agitation and alarm,
perhaps not thoroughly awake at first?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I was broad awake at once, and saw the man
glaring in, though he did not see me. The whole circumstances were
calculated to engrave that face indelibly on my mind, and that
crayon is the best proof that they did so."</p>

<p>"Now we come to that very crayon," said Beresford; "how was it
that, if your memory was so very clear, you did not draw a likeness
before?"</p>

<p>"Simply because, till the period at which I did do it, my
knowledge of drawing was insufficient to the task. It is more
difficult to draw a likeness from memory than with an original
before you."</p>

<p>"Especially when such a very long time has passed since the
original was seen," said the counsel, with another sneer.</p>

<p>The judge here interposed in the same gentle, courteous
manner.</p>

<p>"Lady Egerton, think well before you answer me. Are you sure
that you have nowhere seen the face you have drawn except in the
September of 18&mdash;, or between that date and the August of
18&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere, my lord. I saw his face that September night, and I
never saw it again till I went to Forest Moor. Of this point I am
positive."</p>

<p>Beresford began to lose all hope of confusing the clear-headed
witness he had got hold of, but he made another attempt to throw
doubt on her evidence by baring the deception she had
practised.</p>

<p>"Lady Egerton, did you go to Forest Moor under your own
name?"</p>

<p>"I did not. I assumed that of Jesuita della Castro."</p>

<p>"Then you went under false colors, and having regularly
concocted a scheme of deception?"</p>

<p>"I did," she replied, emphatically.</p>

<p>"In fact," added the counsel, "you, a Spanish lady of birth,
acted the part of a detective."</p>

<p>"Just so, if you like to call it so," said Inez, with
imperturbable coolness.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Beresford, giving it up as hopeless, and
Inez, with a secret smile at his baffled look, returned to her
place, at any rate for the present, and Margaret Arundel was
called. She gave her evidence calmly and consistently, nor could
any cross-examining shake her, though Beresford tried to show that
the jewels might have been in Inez de Caldara's possession when she
went to Forest Moor, but he failed of course. She said positively
that the jewels were not in Inez de Caldara's possession when she
came to Forest Moor, for she had herself unpacked all her
luggage.</p>

<p>As Margaret's evidence was only in the main to confirm Inez's
evidence, we will not give it at length. Egerton was next
called.</p>

<p>"I have only a few questions to ask you, Sir Angelo," said the
attorney-general. "Do you recollect when your wife, then only your
ward, finally left school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in the summer of 18&mdash;, nearly two years ago."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the precise date you fetched her?"</p>

<p>"I did not fetch her myself. I was then in the ministry, and
could not leave town. My friend, Mrs. Rochester, kindly fetched
home my ward when she fetched her own daughter."</p>

<p>"And do you remember the exact date?"</p>

<p>"I do not. I think it was on the 29th of June; but I am certain
that she was at home on the 2nd of July, because that night I took
her down to the House to hear a debate. I got her a Speaker's
order, the date of which is July 2."</p>

<p>"You are sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Now, Sir Angelo, when did you first see this crayon?"</p>

<p>"It must have been on the 1st of July."</p>

<p>"Why on that day?"</p>

<p>"Because I distinctly recollect that my ward showed it to me the
day before the one I took her to the House of Commons."</p>

<p>"And when did your ward leave you to go to Forest Moor?"</p>

<p>"Early on the 17th of August."</p>

<p>"Then you saw the crayon drawing before she went to Forest
Moor?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," was the decided answer.</p>

<p>"I will not trouble you any further. Do you cross-examine, Mr.
Beresford?" added Sir Henry, turning blandly to his opponent.</p>

<p>"No, Sir Henry."</p>

<p>"The next witness I call, my lord, is Mr. Rothesay."</p>

<p>The artist rose, took the oath, and entered the witness-box.</p>

<p>"Your name," began Sir Henry Seton, "is Julian Rothesay."</p>

<p>"No!" was the startling and unexpected reply. "I have for many
years passed by the name of Rothesay, but my real name is Julian
D'Arcy, of Friar's Lea."</p>

<p>The counsel looked surprised, but bowed, and went on.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect where you were on the 21st of September,
18&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I was in Brightstone."</p>

<p>"Why were you there then&mdash;did you live there?"</p>

<p>"No; I was there that day to settle some affairs for an old
friend which required secrecy, and were of a nature that made me
wish not to use or act in my own name, and I assumed for the time
the name of Doria, with a corresponding disguise."</p>

<p>"Had you any weapon upon you any time that day or night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; before I left London I bought a pistol of Pistoia
manufacture, of Mr. Everard, of Bond-street. I had that upon me on
the 21st of September."</p>

<p>"Did you buy only one pistol, or the pair?"</p>

<p>"Only one; its fellow had been sold."</p>

<p>"Can you remember where you were somewhere about midnight of
that 21st of September?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was passing down Water-street. I had entered it through
an alley opening by the Catholic chapel, and as I emerged I saw a
man run round the corner. That was just as St. Mary's clock was
striking 12. I crossed, and as I did so I saw on the pavement,
under the window of the corner house, a pistol lying. I picked it
up, and was surprised to find it hot, and the exact fellow to my
own. At that moment a cry of murder was raised, and I was
seized."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what followed? I don't mean details."</p>

<p>"I was examined before a magistrate, and committed for trial,
but I escaped from prison and fled abroad. I have been an exile for
ten years."</p>

<p>"Did you know the deceased lady or her family?"</p>

<p>"Yes; my father, Colonel D'Arcy, left me when a child in the
care of Sir Reginald Egerton, and at the time of Lady Egerton's
death I was her son's ward."</p>

<p>"Mr. D'Arcy," said the foreman of the jury, "why was it that you
fled and lived as an exile instead of taking your trial?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Julian D'Arcy, "I preferred exile to dishonor. I
could not clear myself save by betraying my friend and my name, and
even then the evidence against me was so very strong that if law
had acquitted me, a stain would have been upon my name."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. D'Arcy, look at these two pistols," continued Seton,
producing them; "you see they are a pair. Can you tell the one you
bought from the one you picked up?"</p>

<p>Julian took the pistols and examined them carefully and
closely.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot," he said.</p>

<p>"That will do."</p>

<p>The other witnesses called were Mr. Everard, who swore to having
sold one pistol to Julian D'Arcy, and its fellow to a person whom
he identified as the prisoner, in the year and month of the murder;
and a clock-maker named Morley, who proved having made the clock of
the Catholic chapel at Brightstone, and having repaired it shortly
before the same eventful period. His examination closed the
prosecution, and Mr. Beresford rose to reply, while Sir Henry
leaned back in his seat and whispered to Sir Angelo, who was close
to him, "They'll make nothing of it, Egerton, I cannot sufficiently
compliment your wife for her steady, unflinching evidence; indeed,
all our witnesses behaved admirably."</p>

<p>Beresford was now opening his defence, in one of his brilliant,
if not always very logical speeches. He admitted the murder, there
was no help for that&mdash;admitted that it was committed at 12
o'clock by St. Mary's clock; but he said that it was ten minutes
fast, and St. Catherine's right. The witness, Lady Egerton, who
drew the crayon drawing, might have seen the prisoner in a hundred
places, and mistaken him for the face she saw, or fancied she saw,
glare into the room. She was a Spaniard, and the Southerns were
confessedly very imaginative. She was at that time a very young
child, awoke suddenly from sleep, and most likely, in the alarm and
horror of the moment, either imagined she saw a face, or if she
really saw one, her imagination invested it with characteristics
the original never possessed.</p>

<p>This address went on to weaken as far as possible the weight of
the other evidence adduced, and Mr. Beresford then proceeded to
call witnesses to prove, if he could, an alibi, by means of the
landlord of the prisoner at Brightstone, and a clock-maker, whose
evidence he used to show that the exactness of the clock of the
Catholic chapel, on which so much depended, could not fairly be
relied on. But, though the counsel did all that man could do for
his client, it was plain that he felt himself even that his case
was a hopeless one.</p>

<p>The defence was concluded, and the attorney-general, in one of
his telling and well-argued speeches, pulled to pieces in detail
the evidence for the prisoner and shortly summed up his his
argument as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, gentlemen of the jury, this is the case you
have to consider. Lady Egerton swears positive to the prisoner. His
face was so engraved upon her memory that years after she makes a
speaking portrait of him, a portrait so exactly like that from the
resemblance alone he was identified. It is said that she might have
imagined it from the idea preying on her mind&mdash;no doubt she
might have imagined a face, but it passes belief that she could
have imagined the very face, and a face so singularly remarkable.
Then the stiletto with which he attempted to murder Lady Inez
Egerton is identified&mdash;stilettos are not usual in England, and
you have the opinion, given long before by the surgeon that Lady
Egerton was stabbed with a fine instrument, like a stiletto, and
the opinion given now that such a weapon as that now produced would
have made such a wound as that inflicted on the late Lady Egerton,
and you have the pistol found by Mr. D'Arcy traced to the prisoner.
The only shadow of an attempt at defence is an alibi, and that
rests on which clock was right. You are asked to believe that a new
clock, by the first maker in London, set twelve hours before the
hour in question, had gained ten minutes in that short space of
time; instead of believing that an old clock, by a second rate
maker, set seven days before, had lost ten minutes. If the other
evidence was not conclusive you could have no doubt which view to
take on this question. But I say that the other evidence is
absolutely overwhelming, and I leave the matter in your hands,
anticipating that you can find but one verdict."</p>

<p>Sir Henry Seton sat down, and then the judge summed up, with
that nice critical balancing of facts and impartiality which does
so much honor to the judges of England. He recounted all the
evidence, and concluded by saying that "if the jury thought St.
Mary's clock right, they must then consider the other evidence; but
if they thought St. Catherine's clock right, and were satisfied
that Gibson and his wife had made no mistake, then, despite the
other evidence, they must acquit the prisoner. If they came to the
former conclusion, they must consider the evidence regarding the
crayon drawing, and whether they believed that Lady Egerton had
made it from a distinct recollection, or whether the likeness could
be attributed to chance or imagination."</p>

<p>The jury retired, and there was silence. Vivian leaned coolly
back with apparent carelessness, but in reality sick and faint with
the agony of suspense&mdash;so an hour that was like years passed,
and then the jury re-appeared. The judge asked the usual question,
and you might have heard a pin drop as the foreman
spoke&mdash;"Guilty!"</p>

<p>A dead, fearful silence for a moment, then&mdash;"Prisoner at
the bar, have you anything to say why sentence of death shall not
be passed upon you?"</p>

<p>"If I have, it is useless," said Vivian, recklessly. "No, I have
nothing to say."</p>

<p>The judge calmly assumed the black cap and passed sentence of
death, concluding in the usual manner, "May God have mercy on your
soul."</p>

<p>Then Vivian turned towards him, with all his devilish beauty in
his dark face, and his fierce, dare-devil passions in his lurid
black eyes.</p>

<p>"God!" said the atheist; "There is no God! I answer my judges as
Couthon answered his, 'After death is nothingness.'"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>Chapter 46.</h2>

<p>Alone now, indeed&mdash;alone with his dark atheism and his
gloomy remorse, that through all his evil life had struggled
vaguely with the devil in him&mdash;alone with his heavy guilt and
the weight of the fearful defiance he had hurled against
Heaven!</p>

<p>There he sat, bending forwards, his head resting on his hands,
his hair&mdash;that rich hair, whose beauty had been so fatal to
himself&mdash;falling over his brow, and his lurid black eyes
raised to the barred window with an expression of fierce, reckless
defiance, and yet of agonised remorse, that was at once horrible
and touching. He did not fear death, because he could not realise
that he must die, and so believing that the grave was death,
dreading the remorse that he could not crush, he took into his
heart the doctrine of the Stoics&mdash;"That Nature has placed the
end of life as the summit of her gifts."</p>

<p>He did not fear death, but he dared not face eternity&mdash;he
dared not acknowledge or believe in a God he had defied in every
word, thought, and deed of his lost life.</p>

<p>But with all that, he feared the night worst of all; it closed
in round him dark and gloomy and heavy. He had a vague dread of
lying down, of sleeping, of the silence. He heard again Jesuita's
dying cry, and saw her beautiful form bathed in her own life's
blood. His dreams were haunted by a regretful pale form that was
his mother, and yet Eveline, and yet through all had the tender
eyes and gentle loving face of the fair Italian wife he had
abandoned&mdash;abandoned, though she was the only woman for whom
he had ever had any real feeling like love, as distinct from the
mere passing passion of the moment.</p>

<p>But with morning the gloomy shades which, to the assassin, had
filled the night, vanished, and once more the man was the desperate
hardened atheist, fiercely refusing even to see the chaplain,
saying, "that he had lived without a priest, and would die without
a priest!"</p>

<p>But presently the gaoler again appeared. It was visiting time,
he said, and there was a lady waiting to see him.</p>

<p>The idea of Inez instantly crossed Arthur's mind, and he
demanded rapidly, "Is she tall, very dark, and
foreign-looking?"</p>

<p>"No," the man answered; "she wasn't tall or dark, but she was
foreign. Would he see her and the gentleman with her?"</p>

<p>He knew now who they were&mdash;his wife and father. "No," he
said, turning his face away, "I will not see them, not one!" But
she was not to be so repulsed; she had followed, and as the gaoler
came out, she glided past him; the door clanged to, and Arthur's
wife was at his feet, her infant in her arms.</p>

<p>"Arthur, my husband, have mercy, have pity; is not Genevra your
wife?" pleaded the soft, gentle voice.</p>

<p>But he turned his face aside, and stretched out his arm to put
her away.</p>

<p>"Keep back," he said, and through all the fierce recklessness of
tone and gesture there struggled yet a strange glimmering of better
feeling. "Keep back; you are a murderer's wife! Do you hear that?
My hand is a blood-stained hand. Do not touch it with yours, so
pure and stainless. Keep back, Genevra."</p>

<p>"I will not keep back," she replied. "I will touch your hand. At
the altar I vowed to love you and cling to you, in joy and sorrow,
till death parted us twain, and I will not be put away in this your
heaviest hour of need&mdash;I, your wedded wife, and the mother of
your child."</p>

<p>He started, and shrunk back shivering and covering his face.</p>

<p>"Take it away, Genevra. Don't let it touch me; my hand would
whither it; my very look would blast it as with a living curse.
Take it away."</p>

<p>"I will not," she said. "Oh, Arthur, it is your own son, your
own child, and the touch, the look of the father cannot harm
it."</p>

<p>She was kneeling at his feet, and Arthur Bertram turned, laid
his slight hand on her shoulder and gazed into the tiny face lying
on her bosom, into the large soft dark eyes that met his own so
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Who shall say what tide of feelings and memories of his own
innocent childhood rushed back upon his soul? If the boy had winced
or shivered beneath his gaze&mdash;if it had even turned its eyes
to its mother or moaned&mdash;he would have turned away hardened,
reckless, utterly lost; but the infant stretched its tiny arms
towards him and smiled in his face, that smile of perfect innocence
and trust which was surely then God's silent whisper in that prison
chamber.</p>

<p>"Genevra! Genevra! It has your face, but my mother's smile," and
suddenly and passionately Arthur clasped the little child to his
breast, and the strong man, his reckless desperation subdued, his
hard, fierce spirit broken down, bowed his head on that little
child, and wept such tears as he had not wept since his childhood;
full of bitter remorse, and anguish, and regret, as they were, they
had yet in them the tear of repentance which opened the gate of
heaven.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevra! wife whom I love, and have wronged, pardon me! and
my father, whose gray hairs I have dishonored, so that I dare not
face him&mdash;entreat his forgiveness for his doomed son."</p>

<p>"My son, I am here!" said a voice, and though neither had heard
him enter, Hugh Bertram stood before them.</p>

<p>Arthur recoiled as if struck, almost throwing the child into its
mother's arms, and for a minute he stood so, and never perhaps had
he looked so beautiful as he did at that moment, facing the father
he had dishonored; so for a moment of dead silence, and then Arthur
suddenly sank at his father's feet, murmuring unconsciously the
words his childhood had heard from his mother's lips&mdash;"Father,
forgive me, for I was no more worthy to be called thy son!"</p>

<p>The father laid his hand on the bowed head of his son.</p>

<p>"My son, my son, not to me, but to Him who has said, 'Thou shalt
do no murder!' to the God you have offended and denied."</p>

<p>Arthur Bertram sprang to his feet as if a scorpion had stung
him. "No," he said, with a look of dark despair; "it is too late. I
have scoffed and disbelieved too long. I have lived an atheist, and
my only hope is in dying an atheist. Shall I believe in your God to
my own damnation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur, my son, child of my dead wife, believe, for your
salvation! repent, and turn to God, for 'he that comes to Him he
will in no wise cast out. A bruised reed shall He not break, and
smoking flax shall he not quench!'"</p>

<p>"My crime is too great, my sin too heavy to be forgiven. I dare
not believe in God," answered Arthur, veiling his face; "if I did
he would cast me out into outer darkness."</p>

<p>"His mercy endureth for ever," said the gentle priest. "'Joy
shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over
ninety-and-nine just persons which need no repentance.'"</p>

<p>Then the wife stole to his side, and gently laid the little babe
on his breast, and the dark night of atheism fled before the holy
light of God's smile of mercy and great love, and Arthur Bertram
bowed his beautiful face and golden hair on his child, and from his
very soul rose the appeal to heaven&mdash;"Oh, God, forgive me, and
have mercy on me a sinner!"</p>

<p>A lost life no more&mdash;lost no more, but saved.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>Chapter 47.</h2>

<p>THE memoir of Arthur Bartram is a short and a sad one, for it is
a story of evil and wrong, which he addressed to his wife, and sent
afterwards to Angelo Egerton.</p>

<p>"You know my noble-hearted father, Genevra, and know that no
fault of his can have been the cause of my fall.</p>

<p>"My mother died when I was a child. If she had lived I might
have been another being, for only she could charm to silence the
demon which I believe was born in my very blood. Even as it is, her
memory has been the one softer feeling which has saved me through
all my evil life from being chained body and soul to perdition.</p>

<p>"But she left me the fatal gift of her beauty and powers of
fascination; and those gifts have been my curse. I will not pain
you, gentle wife, by details which can only wring your heart.</p>

<p>"I was sent to college, and there I became one of the worst set
to which my evil nature attracted me.</p>

<p>"You wonder, Genevra, how unbelief ever wound its serpent coils
round me. 'A third cause of atheism is a custom of profane scoffing
in holy matters, which doth by little and little deface the
reverence of religion.' So wrote our great philosopher. This was
what made me a renegade to my angel mother's faith. I sneered and
scoffed till I could no longer worship what I only treated and saw
treated as a jest; and I clung to my atheism as a drowning man
clings to the slender straw, which will break when he tests its
strength.</p>

<p>"At eighteen I had left&mdash;fled from the college, and
forsworn my father, and lest he should trace and seek to reclaim
me, I even dropped his name and went by another name. Before I was
twenty I was the companion of professed gamblers, and even
worse&mdash;let that pass; they had robbers amongst them, men whose
trade was robbery, and that fatal September they arranged to rob
Lady Egerton; and as I was slight, agile, and utterly reckless, I
was selected to do it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevra, that horrible night! What wonder that that little
Spanish child so remembered my face? I did not mean to kill Lady
Egerton, as heaven is my witness. I did not mean to kill her; but
she woke and saw me, and I stabbed her&mdash;she shrieked, and in
the wild desperation of the moment I shot her, seized the casket,
dropped the pistol, and fled. One of my accomplices had a swift
horse on the beach, and so I reached home at 12 o'clock. Those
fatal jewels! they were too marked; I dared not sell
them&mdash;dared not even let my companions see them, and next day
I fled abroad, and for more than two years I never set foot in
England. When I did, it was under the name of Arthur Vivian, my
Christian names.</p>

<p>"Inez de Caldara, Lady Egerton, will have told you all she knows
of me and my first wife, Eveline; if not, ask her to do so, if you
wish to know. I pass briefly over the rest of my story. I met
Stephen Stanfeld in a gambling house, and I got him in my power;
for I, well versed in it, soon found he used loaded dice. I thought
his eldest daughter was her mother's heiress, and so she would have
been, save that her grandfather had tied up his property when she
married.</p>

<p>"I never cared for Eveline, and I soon left her. Poor Evie, her
death lies heavy on me, now! Heaven forgive me the wrong I did her.
How I met you&mdash;how I deceived you, Genevra, you know too
well&mdash;spare me the recital. I left you because I dared not
remain long anywhere, and I could not trust even you with the
secret of my residence. I came to London, for it is the safest
hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Wonder, Genevra, what you will, what made me, a haunted man, go
that day to the National Gallery to see that portrait whose fame
had reached me, but I tell you it was no power of mine&mdash;it was
a strong power that drew me there under the form of my own wish. I
thought before my trial that it was my evil fate. I see now that it
was God's merciful hand. You know all now, Genevra."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Later there came a short hurried letter to Vivian, written in
Italian.</p>

<p class="letter">"My husband, bow down before God, for his mercy
is beyond comparison; you are saved. Angelo Egerton, the noble,
generous Egerton, yielded to my prayer; his wife interceded for
you, and then he said that Julian D'Arcy's name was clear; it was
all he cared for, and for the sake of your father, of me, of our
child, he will do what he can to save you.<br>
<br>
"GENEVRA."</p>

<h2><a name="ch48" id="ch48"></a>Chapter 48.</h2>

<p>Years have passed, and rolled away on the scroll of time. Once
more there are dissolving views passing before us like a
vision.</p>

<p>See, in the distance, on the verge of a primeval forest in the
Far West, the sun is setting behind the distant mountains and
shedding its gorgeous light on the plains and on every forest leaf;
it falls too on a group there. There are not many. A venerable
gray-headed old man sits by the cottage-door, with a fair boy, yet
in childhood, at his knee, and he looks ever and anon, with a
gentle smile, on a dark-eyed woman with a sweet Madonna face, who
sits at the feet of a man yet young, and far more beautiful now
than ever he was in past days. There is a softened sadness now in
his eyes and smile, and the setting sunbeams shine on his burnished
hair, as he bends over his wife, and then, turning, kneels at the
old man's feet, and bows his golden head, whispering the touching
appeal, "Bless me, even me, O my Father!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The shades vanish in the mist and distance. There a crowd
gathered before that tall, high house; they say it is a gaming
house, and that some one within has killed himself. Hush! they are
carrying out the body; it is an old man, his hair is white, and the
dead face looks horrible in the moonlight.</p>

<p>They whisper in the crowd that his name is Stephen Stanfeld.</p>

<p>A life lost&mdash;lost for ever.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>There is yet another scene that rises.</p>

<p>Once more the ancient castle of Falcontower rises gradually
against the sky; but the yule-log blazes within, and a merry party
are gathered there. See them all&mdash;Louis St. John and gentle
Margaret; and his fair mother sits apart, with three beautiful
children round her. Ask that dark, noble-looking boy, whose arm is
round his little sister, what his name is and his sister's, and he
will answer, "Mine is Julian Egerton, and hers is Jesuita;" and
that blue-eyed boy beside them is Julian D'Arcy's only boy,
Angelo.</p>

<p>They are all there&mdash;Austin and Marion Rochester, Walter
Surrey and his wife Theresa, for her grandfather lies asleep far
away.</p>

<p>There, side by side, stand Angelo Egerton and Julian D'Arcy,
looking down on Inez, who sits by them with her youngest child, an
infant, in her arms, and she looks up now and then with the old
tender smile on her young, quiet face. Later her son comes up, and
draws her away to the picture gallery, and stops before a large
picture whispering, "Mother, what does it mean?" And the fair young
mother bends down, and answers, "Years hence, my son, when you are
older, your mother's lips shall tell you the history of that
portrait." E. S.</p>
