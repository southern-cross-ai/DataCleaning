  <p class="intro"><i>The Story of a Great Schoolmaster</i> is a 1924 biography
  of Frederick William Sanderson (1857-1922) by H. G. Wells. It is the only
  biography Wells wrote. Sanderson was a personal friend, having met Wells in
  1914 when his sons George Philip ('Gip'), born in 1901, and Frank Richard,
  born in 1903, became pupils at Oundle School, of which Sanderson was
  headmaster from 1892 to 1922. After Sanderson died while giving a lecture at
  University College London at which he was introduced by Wells, the famous
  author agreed to help produce a biography to raise money for the school. But
  in December 1922, after disagreements emerged with Sanderson's widow about
  his approach to the subject, Wells withdrew from the official biography
  (published in 1923 as <i>Sanderson of Oundle</i>; Wells wrote much of the
  text but the volume was published without listing an author) and published
  his own work separately. &mdash;<i>Wikipedia</i></p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; SANDERSON THE MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Of all the men I have met&mdash;and I have now had a fairly
  long and active life and have met a very great variety of interesting
  people&mdash;one only has stirred me to a biographical effort. This one
  exception is F.W. Sanderson, for many years the
  headmaster of Oundle School. I think him beyond question the greatest man I
  have ever known with any degree of intimacy, and it is in the hope of
  conveying to others something of my sense not merely of his importance, but
  of his peculiar genius and the rich humanity of his character, that I am
  setting out to write this book. He was in himself a very delightful mixture
  of subtlety and simplicity, generosity, adventurousness, imagination and
  steadfast purpose, and he approached the general life of our time at such an
  angle as to reflect the most curious and profitable lights upon it. To tell
  his story is to reflect upon all the main educational ideas of the last
  half-century, and to revise our conception of the process and purpose of the
  modern community in relation to education. For Sanderson had a mind like an
  octopus, it seemed always to have a tentacle free to reach out beyond what
  was already held, and his tentacles grew and radiated farther and farther.
  Before his end he had come to a vision of the school as a centre for the
  complete reorganisation of civilised life.</p>

  <p>I knew him personally only during the last eight years of his life; I met
  him for the first time in 1914, when I was proposing to send my sons to his
  school. But our thoughts and interests drew us very close to one another, I
  never missed an opportunity of meeting and talking to him, and I was the last
  person he spoke to before his sudden death. He was sixty-six years of age
  when he died. Those last eight years were certainly the richest and most
  productive of his whole career; he grew most in those years; he travelled
  farthest. I think I saw all the best of him. It is, I think, no disadvantage
  to have known him only in his boldest and most characteristic phase. It saves
  me from confusion between his maturer and his earlier phases. He was a much
  stratified man. He had grown steadfastly all his life, he had shaken off many
  habitual inhibitions and freed himself from once necessary restraints and
  limitations. He would go discreetly while his convictions accumulated and
  then break forward very rapidly. He had a way of leaving people behind, and
  if I had fallen under his spell earlier, I, too, might have been left far
  behind. He was, I recall, a rock-climber; he was a mental rock-climber also,
  and though he was very wary of recalcitrance, there were times when his pace
  became so urgent that even his staff and his own family were left tugging,
  breathless and perplexed, at the rope.</p>

  <p>Out of a small country grammar-school he created something more suggestive
  of those great modern teaching centres of which our world stands in need than
  anything else that has yet been attempted. By all ordinary standards the
  Oundle School of his later years was a brilliant success; it prospered
  amazingly, there was an almost hopeless waiting-list of applicants; boys had
  to be entered five years ahead; but successful as it was, it was no more than
  a sketch and demonstration of the great schools that are yet to be. I saw my
  own sons get an education there better than I had ever dared hope for them in
  England, but from the first my interest in the intention and promise of
  Oundle went far beyond its working actualities. And all the educational
  possibilities that I had hitherto felt to be unattainable dreams, matters of
  speculation, things a little too extravagant even to talk about in our dull
  age, I found being pushed far towards realisation by this bold, persistent,
  humorous and most capable man.</p>

  <p>Let me first try to give you a picture of his personality as he lives in
  my memory. Then I will try to give an account of his beginnings, as far as I
  have been able to learn about them, and so we will come to our main theme,
  _Sanderson contra Mundum,_ the schoolmaster who set out to conquer the world.
  For, as I shall show, that and no less was what he was trying to do in the
  last years of his life.</p>

  <p>'Ruddy' and 'jolly' are the adjectives that come first to mind when I
  think of describing him. He had been a slender, energetic young man his early
  photographs witness; but long before I met him he had become plump and
  energetic, with a twinkling appreciation for most of the good things of life.
  His complexion had a reddish fairness; he had well-modelled features, thick
  eyebrows and thick moustache touched with grey, and he wore spectacles
  through and over and beside which his active eyes took stock of you. About
  his eyes were kindly wrinkles, and generally I remember him as
  smiling&mdash;often with a touch of roguery in the smile. Quick movements of
  his head caused animating flashes of his glasses. He was carrying a little
  too much body for his heart, and that made him short of breath. His voice was
  in his chest, there was a touch of his native Northumbria in his accent, and
  he had a habit of speaking in incomplete sentences with a frequent use of the
  interrogative form. His manner was confidential; he would bend towards his
  hearer and drop his voice a little. 'Now what do you think of
  &mdash;&mdash;?' he would say, or 'I've been thinking of &mdash;&mdash;' so
  and so. At times his confidential manner became endearingly suggestive of a
  friendly conspirator. This, as yet, he seemed to say, was not for too
  careless a publication. You and he understood, but those other
  fellows&mdash;they were difficult fellows. It might not be practicable to
  attempt everything at once.</p>

  <p>That reservation, that humorous discretion, is very essential in my memory
  of him. It is essential to the whole educational situation of the world. He
  was an exceptionally bold and creative man, and he was a schoolmaster, and
  that is perhaps as near as one can come to a complete incompatibility of
  quality and conditions. In no part of our social life is dull traditionalism
  so powerfully entrenched as it is in our educational organisation. We have
  still to realise the evil of mental heaviness in scholastic concerns. We
  take, very properly, the utmost precautions to exclude men and women of
  immoral character not only from actual teaching but also from any exercise of
  educational authority. But no one ever makes the least objection to the far
  more deadly influences of stupidity and unteachable ignorance. Our
  conceptions of morality are still grossly physical. The heavier and slower a
  man's mind seems to be, the more addicted he is to intellectual narcotics,
  the more people trust him as a schoolmaster. He will 'stay put.'</p>

  <p>A timid obstructiveness is the atmosphere in which almost all educational
  effort has to work, and schoolmasters are denied a liberty of thought and
  speech conceded to very other class of respectable men. They must still be
  mealy mouthed about Darwin, fatuously conventional in politics, and emptily
  orthodox in religion. If they stimulate their boys they must stimulate as a
  brass trumpet does, without words or ideas. They may be great leaders of
  men&mdash;provided they lead backwards or no whither. Sanderson in his latter
  days broke into unexampled freedom, but for the greater part of his life he
  was&mdash;like most of his profession&mdash;'wading hips-deep in fools,' and
  equally resolved to work out his personal impulse and retain the great
  opportunities that the governing body of Oundle School had, almost
  unwittingly, put into his hands. He was therefore not only a great
  revolutionary but something of a Vicar of Bray. A large part of the amusing
  subtlety of his personality was the result of the balanced course he had to
  pursue. In all he did, in all he said, he was feeling his way. No other
  schoolmaster&mdash;and there must be many a rebellious heart lying still in
  the graves of dead schoolmasters and many a stifled rebel in the schoolrooms
  of to-day&mdash;no other schoolmaster has ever felt his way so discreetly, so
  far and, at last, so triumphantly.</p>

  <p>I remember as a very characteristic thing that he said one day when I
  asked for his opinion of a particularly progressive and hopeful addition to
  his board of governors: 'He does not know much about schools yet, but he will
  learn. Oundle will teach him.' And in his last great lecture, he flung out a
  general 'aside'&mdash;that lecture was full of astonishing 'asides'&mdash;'I
  turned round on the boys and the parents,' he said, _'both are my
  business.'_</p>

  <p>Never was schoolmaster so emancipated as he in his latter years from the
  ancient servility of the pedagogue. Not for him the handing on of mellow
  traditions and genteel gestures of the mind, not for him the obedient
  administration of useful information to employers' sons by the docile
  employee. He saw the modern teacher in university and school plainly for what
  he has to be, the anticipator, the planner, and the foundation-maker of the
  new and greater order of human life that arises now visibly amidst the
  decaying structures of the old.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Sanderson was born and brought up outside the British
  public-school system that he was to affect so profoundly. His early education
  was obtained in a parish school. His father was employed in the estate office
  of Lord Boyne at Brancepeth in Durham. There were several brothers but they
  all died before manhood, and the scanty indications one can glean of those
  early years suggest a slender, studious, and probably rather delicate
  youngster. He was never very proficient in any out-of-door games. In the
  early days at Oundle he careered about on a bicycle; in later years he played
  tennis; his vacation exercise was rock-srambling. He became a
  'student-teacher,' so the official Life phrases it, at a school at Tudhoe,
  but whether there was any difference between being a student-teacher at a
  school at Tudhoe and being an ordinary pupil-teacher in an ordinary
  elementary school under the English Education Department I have been unable
  to ascertain. He was already notable in his village world as exceptionally
  intelligent, industrious, and ambitious, and with a little encouragement from
  the local vicar and one or two friends he effected an escape from the
  strangling limitations of elementary teaching.</p>

  <p>He may have aimed at the church at that time. At any rate he gained a
  scholarship and entered Durham University as a theological student. He did
  well in Durham University both in theology and mathematics; he was made a
  Fellow and he was able to go on as a scholar from Durham to the wider and
  more strenuous academic life of Cambridge. At Cambridge theology drops out of
  the foreground of the picture. He took a fairly good degree in mathematics,
  and he worked for the Natural Science Tripos. He did not fight his way up
  into that select class which secures Cambridge fellowships, but he had made a
  reputation as an able, hard, and honest worker; he was much sought after as a
  coach, and he was given a lectureship in the woman's college of Girton. From
  this he went as senior physics master to the big school for boys at
  Dulwich.</p>

  <p>A photograph of him in the early Dulwich period shows him slender and
  keen-looking, already bespectacled and with a thick moustache; except for the
  glasses not unlike another ruddy north-countryman I once knew, the novelist
  George Gissing. Both were what one might call Scandinavian in type. But
  Gissing was as despondent as Sanderson was buoyant. In those days, an old
  Dulwich associate tells me, Sander.. son was in a state of great mental
  fermentation. He loved long walks in his spare time, and along the pebbly
  paths and roads and up and down the little hills of that corner of Kent, the
  two of them talked out a hundred aspects and issues of the perplexing
  changing world in which they found themselves.</p>

  <p>It was the world of the eighteen-eighties they were looking at, before the
  first Jubilee of Queen Victoria, and it may be worth while to devote a
  paragraph or so to a reconstruction of the moral and intellectual landscape
  this lean and eager young man was confronting.</p>

  <p>Upon the surface and in its general structure that British world of the
  eighties had a delusive air of final establishment. Queen Victoria had been
  reigning for close upon half a century and seemed likely to reign for ever.
  The economic system of unrestricted private enterprise with privately owned
  capital had yielded a great harvest of material prosperity, and few people
  suspected how rapidly it was exhausting the soil of willing service in which
  it grew. Production increased every year; population increased every year;
  there was a steady progress of invention and discovery, comfort, and
  convenience. Wars went on, a marginal stimulation of the empire, but since
  the collapse of Napoleon I no war had happened to frighten England for its
  existence as a country; no threat of warfare that could touch English life or
  English soil troubled men's imagination. Ruskin and Carlyle had criticised
  English ideals and the righteousness of English commerce and industrialism,
  but they were regarded generally as eccentric and unaccountable men; there
  was already a conflict of science and theology, but it affected the national
  life very little outside the world of the intellectuals; a certain amount of
  trade competition from the United States and from other European countries
  was developing, but at most it ruffled the surface of the national
  self-confidence. There was a socialist movement, but it was still only a
  passionless criticism of trade and manufacturers, a criticism poised between
  aesthetic fastidiousness and benevolence. People played with that Victorian
  socialism as they would have played with a very young tiger-cub. The labour
  movement was a gentle insistence upon rather higher wages and rather shorter
  hours; it had still to discover Socialism. In a world of certainties the rate
  of interest fell by minute but perceptible degrees, and as a consequence
  money for investment went abroad until all the world was under tribute to
  Britain. History seemed to be over, entirely superseded by the daily paper;
  tragedy and catastrophe were largely eliminated from human life. One read of
  famines in India and civil chaos in China, but one felt that these were
  diminishing distresses; the missionaries were at work there and railways
  spreading.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a mild and massive Sphynx of British life that confronted
  our young man at Dulwich and his friend, an amoeboid Sphynx which enveloped
  and assimilated rather than tore and devoured. It had not been stricken for a
  generation, and so it felt assured of the ages. But beneath its
  tranquil-looking surfaces many ferments were actively at work, and its serene
  and empty visage masked extensive processes of decay. The fifty-year-old
  faith on which the social and political fabric rested&mdash;for all social
  and political fabrics must in the last resort rest upon faith&mdash;was being
  corroded and dissolved and removed. Britain in the mid-Victorian time stood
  strong and sturdy in the world because a great number of its people, its
  officials, employers, professional men and workers honestly believed in the
  rightness of its claims and professions, believed in its state theology, in
  the justice of its economic relationships, in the romantic dignity of its
  monarchy, and in the real beneficence and righteousness of its relations to
  foreigners and the subject-races of the Empire. They did what they understood
  to be their duty in the light of that belief, simply, directly, and with
  self-respect and mutual confidence. If some of its institutions fell short of
  perfection, few people doubted that they led towards it. But from the middle
  of the century onward this assurance of the prosperous British in their world
  was being subjected to a more and more destructive criticism, spreading
  slowly from intellectual circle into the general consciousness.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note one or two dates in relation to Sanderson's
  life. He was born in the year 1857. This was two years before the publication
  of Darwin's _Origin of Species._ He was growing up through boyhood as the
  application of the Darwinian criticism of life to current theology was made,
  and as the great controversy between Science and orthodox beliefs came to a
  head. Huxley's challenging book, _Man's Place in Nature,_ was published in
  1863; Darwin became completely explicit about human origins only in 1871 with
  _The Descent of Man._ Sanderson, then a bright and forward boy of fourteen,
  was probably already beginning to take notice of these disputes about the
  fundamentals, as they were then considered, of sound Christianity.</p>

  <p>He was already at college when Huxley was pounding Gladstone and the Duke
  of Argyll upon such issues as whether the first chapter of Genesis was
  strictly parallel with the known course of evolution, and whether the miracle
  of the Gadarene swine was a just treatment of the Gadarene swineherds.
  Sanderson's Durham and Cambridge studies and talks went on amidst the thunder
  of these debates, and there can be little doubt that his early theology
  underwent much bending and adaptation to the new realisations of the past of
  man, and of human destiny that these discussions opened out. He did not take
  holy orders but he remained in the Anglican Church; manifestly he could still
  find a meaning in the Fall and in the scheme of Salvation. Many other
  promising teachers of his generation found this impossible; such men as
  Graham Wall as, for example, felt compelled for conscience' sake to abandon
  the public-school teaching to which they had hoped to give their lives.
  Wallas found scope for his very great gifts of suggestion and inspiration in
  the London School of Economics, but many others of these Victorian non-jurors
  were lost to education altogether.</p>

  <p>The criticism of the economic life and social organisation of that age was
  going on almost parallel with the destruction of its cosmogony. Ruskin's
  _Unto this Last_ was issued when Sanderson was four years old; _Fors
  Clavigera_ was appearing in the seventies and the early eighties. William
  Morris was a little later with _News from Nowhere_ and _The Dream of John
  Ball;_ they must have still been vividl y new books in Sanderson's Cambridge
  days. Marx was little heard of then in England. He was already a power in
  German socialism in the seventies, but he did not reach the reader of English
  until the eighties were nearly at an end. When Sanderson discussed socialism
  during those Dulwich walks, it must have been Ruskin and Morris rather than
  Marx who figured in his talk. Al though there remains no account of those
  early conversations, it is easy to guess that this stir of social
  reconstruction and religious readjustment must have played a large part in
  them. Sanderson meant to teach and wanted to teach; he was quite unlike that
  too common sort of schoolmaster who has fallen back into teaching after the
  collapse of other ambitions; like all really sincere teachers he was eager to
  learn, open to every new and stimulating idea, and free altogether from the
  malignant conservatism of the disappointed type.</p>

  <p>He kept that adolescent power of mental growth throughout life. I remember
  my pleased astonishment on my first visit to Oundle to find in his
  library&mdash;I had drifted to his bookshelves while I awaited him&mdash;a
  row of the works of Nietzsche (who came into the English-speaking world in
  the late nineties) and recent books by Bertrand Russell and Shaw. Here was a
  schoolmaster, a British public schoolmaster, aware that the world was still
  going on! It seemed too good to be true. But it was true, and in the end
  Sanderson was to die, ten years, shall we say?&mdash;or twenty, ahead of his
  time.</p>

  <p>And while we are placing Sanderson in relation to the intellectual stir of
  the age let us note, too, the general shape of human affairs as it was
  presented to his mind. It was an age of steadily accelerated political
  change, and of a vast increase in the population of the world. The fifties
  and sixties of the nineteenth century had seen the world-wide spread of the
  railway and telegraph network, and a consequent opening up of vast regions of
  production that had hitherto lain fallow. The screw was replacing the
  ineffective paddle-wheel of the earlier steamships and revolutionising ocean
  transport. There was a great increase in mechanical and agricultural
  efficiency. We still call that time the mid-Victorian period, but the history
  teacher of the future, more sensible than we are of the innocence of good
  Queen Victoria in any concern of importance to mankind, is more likely to
  distinguish it as the Advent of the New Communications. These new inventions
  were 'abolishing distance.' They were demanding a political synthesis of
  mankind. But there was little understanding as yet of this now manifest
  truth. One hardly notes a sign of any such awareness in literature and public
  discussions until the end of the century; and failing a clear understanding
  of their nature the new expansive forces operated through the cheap and
  unsound interpretations first of sentimental nationalism and then of romantic
  imperialism.</p>

  <p>Sanderson's boyhood saw the differences of the cultures of north and south
  in the United States of America at first exacerbated by the new means of
  communication and then, after four years of civil war, resolved into a
  stabler unity. The straggling peninsula of Italy under the sway of the new
  synthetic forces recovered a unity it had lost with the decay of the Roman
  roads; the internal tension of the continental powers culminated in the
  Franco-German war. But these were insufficient adjustments, and a renewed
  growth of armaments upon land and sea alike, betrayed the growing mutual
  pressure of the great powers. All dreamt of expansion and none of
  coalescence. The dominant political fact in Europe while Sanderson was a
  young man, was the rise of Germany to political and economic predominance.
  German energy, restrained from geographical release, drove upward along the
  lines of scientific and technical progress, and the outward thrust of its
  pent-up imperialism took the form of a gathering military threat. Germany
  first and then the United States, released and renewed after their escape
  from the fragmentation that had threatened them, made the economic pace for
  the rest of the world throughout the eighties and the nineties. They stirred
  the British manufacturer and parent to indignant inquiries; they forced the
  drowsy schools of Great Britain into a reluctant admission of scientific and
  technical teaching. But they awakened as yet no profounder
  heart-searchings.</p>

  <p>The young science-master at Dulwich talked, no doubt, as we all did in
  those days, of Evolution and Socialism, of the rights of labour and the
  Christianisation of industry, of the progress of science and the scandal of
  the increasing expenditure upon armaments, with the illusion of an immense
  general stability in the background of his mind. It was an illusion that
  needed not only the Great War of 1914-18 but its illuminating sequelae to
  shatter and destroy.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Accounts of Sanderson's work in Dulwich school differ very
  widely. At one time it would seem that he had troubles about discipline, and
  it is quite conceivable that his methods there were experimental and
  fluctuating. No doubt he was trying over at Dulwich many of the things that
  were to establish his success at Oundle. On the whole the Dulwich work was
  good work, and it gave him sufficient reputation to secure the headmastership
  of Oundle School when presently the governing body of that school sought a
  man of energy and character to modernise it.</p>

  <p>The most valuable result of his Dulwich period was the demonstration of
  the interestingness of practical work in physical science for boys who
  remained apathetic under the infliction of the stereotyped classical
  curriculum. He was not getting the pick of the boys there but the residue,
  but he was getting an alertness and interest out of this second-grade
  material that surprised even himself. The interest of the classical teaching
  was largely the interest of a spirited competition which demanded not only a
  special sort of literary ability but a special sort of competitive
  disposition. But there are quite clever boys of an amiable type to whom
  competition does not appeal, and some of these were among the most
  interesting of the youngsters who were awakened to industrious work by his
  laboratory instruction.</p>

  <p>It is clear that before Sanderson went to Oundle he had already developed
  a firm faith in the possibility of a school with a new and more varied
  curriculum, in which a far greater proportion of the boys could be interested
  in their work than was the case in the contemporary classical and (formal)
  mathematical school, and also that he had conceived the idea of replacing the
  competitive motive, which had ruled the schools of Europe since the
  establishment of the great Jesuit schools three hundred years before, by the
  more vital stimulus of interest in the work itself. He also took to Oundle a
  proved and tested conception of the need for the utmost possible personal
  participation by every boy in every collective function of the school. Quite
  early in his Oundle career he came into conflict with his boys and carried
  his point upon the issue whether every boy was to sing in the school singing
  or whether that was to be left to the specialised choir of boys who had
  voices and a taste for that sort of thing. That was an essential issue for
  him. From the very first he was working for the rank and file and against the
  star system of school work by which a few boys sing or work or play with
  distinction and encouragement, against a background of neglected shirkers and
  defeated and discouraged competitors.</p>

  <p>Sanderson married soon after he went to Dulwich. His wife came from
  Cumberland and she excelled in all those domestic matters that make a
  successful headmaster's wife. Throughout all the rest of his life she was his
  loyal and passionate partisan. His friends were her friends, and his critics
  and opponents were her enemies, and if she had a fault it was that she found
  it difficult to forgive anyone who had seemed ever to differ from him. Two
  sons were born during the seven years that passed in the little home in
  Dulwich. It must have been a very brisk and happy little home. One can
  imagine the tall young man with his gown a little powdered with blackboard
  chalk, flying out behind him, striding along the school corridors to some
  fresh and successful experiment in laboratory work, or in homely tweeds
  walking along the Kentish lanes with his friend, or snatching a delightful
  half-hour in the nursery to see Master Roy's first attempts to walk, or
  reading some new and stirring book with the lamp of those days before
  electric lighting at his elbow. He was thirty-five when he achieved his last
  step in the upward career of a secondary schoolmaster and was appointed
  headmaster of Oundle. That success probably came as a surprise, for
  Sanderson's modest origins and the fact that he was not in holy orders must
  have been a serious handicap upon his application. It must have been a very
  elated young couple who packed their household belongings for the unknown
  town of Oundle.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE MODERNISATION OF OUNDLE SCHOOL</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Oundle School, which was to be the material of Sanderson's
  life work, which was to teach him so much and profit so richly by the
  reaction, was one of comparatively old standing. It was a pre-reformation
  foundation; a certain Joan Wyatt having endowed a schoolmaster in the place
  in 1485. Its main revenues, however, derived from Sir William Laxton, Lord
  Mayor of London and Master of the Grocers' Company, who in 1556 left
  considerable property to that body on condition that it supported a school in
  his native town of Oundle. The Grocers' Company took over the Joan Wyatt
  school and schoolmaster, and has discharged its obligations to Oundle with
  intermittent energy and honesty to this day.</p>

  <p>Oundle has always been a school of fluctuating fortunes. The district
  round and about does not sustain a sufficient population to maintain full
  classes and an efficient staff, and only when the prestige of the school was
  great enough to attract boys from a distance had it any chance of
  flourishing. Time after time an energetic head with more or less support from
  the distant governing body would push it into prominence and prosperity only
  to pass away and leave it to an equally rapid decline. The London Grocers'
  Company is a very unsuitable body for educational work. It is not organised
  for any such work. It was originally a chartered association of city
  wholesalers, spice dealers, and so forth, who maintained a certain standard
  of honest trading and protected their common interests in the middle ages; it
  commended itself to the spiritual care of St. Anthony, and built a great hall
  and acted as almoner for its impoverished members and their widows and
  orphans; its normal function to-day is the entertainment of princes and
  politicians. It is now a fortuitous collection of merchants, business-men,
  and prosperous persons, and it is only by chance that now and then a group of
  its members have had the conscience and intelligence to rise above the normal
  indifference of such people to the full possibilities of the Laxton bequest.
  Generally the Company's conduct of the school has varied between half-hearted
  help and negligence and the diversion of the funds to other ends; it has no
  tradition of competent governorship, and the ups and downs of Oundle have
  been dependent mainly upon the personal qualities of the masters who have
  chanced to be appointed.</p>

  <p>There was a period of prosperity during the second quarter of the
  seventeenth century which was brought to an end by the plague, and by the
  impoverishment of the school through the fire of London in which various
  Laxton properties were destroyed. Throughout a large part of the eighteenth
  century the school was completely effaced, and the entire revenues of the
  Laxton bequest were no doubt expended in hospitality. There was a revival in
  1796. In the seventies of the nineteenth century the school was doing well in
  mathematics under a certain Dr. Stansbury, and in the eighties it had as many
  as two hundred boys under the Rev. H. St. J. Reade. Then it declined again
  until the numbers sank below a hundred. It was a time of quickened
  consciences in educational matters, and some of the more energetic and able
  members of the Grocers' Company determined to make a drastic change of
  conditions at Oundle. They found Sanderson ready to their hands.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The world is changing so rapidly that it may be well to say
  a few words about the type of school Sanderson was destined to renovate. Even
  in the seventies and eighties these smaller 'classical' schools had a quaint
  old-fashioned air amidst the surrounding landscape. They were staffed by the
  less vigorous men of the university-scholar type; men of the poorer educated
  classes in origin, not able enough to secure any of the prizes reserved for
  university successes, and not courageous enough to strike out into the great
  world on their own account. They protected themselves from the sense of
  inferiority by an exaggeration of the value of the schooling and disciplines
  through which they had gone, and they ignored their lack of grasp in a
  worship of the petty accuracies within their capacity. Their ambition soared
  at its highest to holy orders and a headmastership, a comfortable house, a
  competent wife, dignity, security, ease, and a certain celebrity in
  equation-dodging or the imitation of Latin and Greek compositions.
  Contemporary life and thought these worthy dominies regarded with a lofty
  scorn. The formal mathematical work, it is true, was not older than a century
  or a century and a half, but the classical training had come down in an
  unbroken tradition from the seventeenth century. One of the staff of Oundle
  when Sanderson took it over is described as a 'wonderful' classical master.
  'His master passion,' we are told, 'for Latin elegiacs and Greek iambics
  fired many of his pupils, whose best efforts were copied into a book that
  bore the title _Inscribatur.'_ These exercises in stereotyped expression were
  going on at Oundle right into the eighteen-nineties. They had their
  justification. From the school the boys passed on to the Universities of
  Oxford and Cambridge, where sympathetic examining authorities awarded the
  greater prizes at their disposal to the more proficient of these victims. The
  Civil Service Commissioners by a mark-rigging system that would have won the
  respect of an American election boss, kept the Higher Division of the Civil
  Service as a preserve for ignorance 'classically' adorned. So that the school
  could boast of 'an almost uninterrupted stream of scholarship successes at
  Cambridge' even in its decline in the late eighties, when its real
  educational value to the country it served was a negative quantity.</p>

  <p>This seventeenth century 'classical' grind constituted the main work of
  the school, and no other subject seems to have been pursued with any
  industry. Most of the staff could not draw or use their hands properly; like
  most secondary teachers of that time they were innocent of educational
  science, and no attempt was made to teach every boy to draw. Drawing was
  still regarded as a 'gift' in those days. The normally intelligent boy
  without the peculiar aptitudes and plasticity needed to take Latin elegiacs
  seriously, had no educational alternative whatever. There was no mathematical
  teaching beyond low-grade formal stuff of a very boring sort, and the only
  science available was a sort of science teaching put in to silence the
  complaints of progressive-minded parents rather than with any educational
  intention, science teaching that was very properly called 'stinks.' It was a
  stinking imposture. The boy of good ordinary quality was driven therefore to
  games or 'hobbies' or mischief as an outlet for his energies, as chance might
  determine. The school buildings before Sanderson was appointed were as
  cramped as the curriculum; old boys recall the 'redolent' afternoon
  class-rooms; the Grocers' Company in its wisdom had built a new Schoolhouse
  during the brief boom under St. John Reade, between a public house on either
  side and a slum at the back. It must have been pleasant for master and boys
  alike to escape from the stuffiness of general teaching upon these premises,
  and from the priggish exploits in versification of the 'inspired' minority,
  to the cricket field. There one had scope; there was life. The Rev. H. St. J.
  Reade, the headmaster in the eighties, had been Captain of the Oxford Eleven,
  and drove the ball hard and far, to the admiration of all beholders.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Mungo J. Park, who immediately preceded Sanderson, is described
  as a man of considerable personal dignity, aloof and leisurely, and greatly
  respected by the boys. Under him the number of the boys in the school
  declined to fewer than a hundred. That dwindling band led the normal life of
  boys at any small public school in England. Most of them were frightfully
  bored by the teaching of the bored masters; the wonderful classical master
  lashed himself periodically up to the infectious level of enthusiasm for his
  amazing exercises; there was cribbing and ragging and loafing, festering
  curiosities and emotional experimenting, and, thank Heaven! games a fellow
  could understand. If these boys learnt anything of the marvellous new vision
  of the world that modern science was unfolding, they learnt it by their own
  private reading and against the wishes of their antiquated teachers. They
  learnt nothing in school of the outlook of contemporary affairs, nothing of
  contemporary human work, nothing of the social and economic system in which
  many of them were presently to play the part of captains. If they learnt
  anything about their bodies it was secretly, furtively, and dirtily. The
  gentlemen in holy orders upon the staff, and the sermons in the Oundle parish
  church, had made souls incredible. There has been much criticism of the
  devotion to games in these dens of mental dinginess, but games were the only
  honest and conclusive exercises to be found in them. From the sunshine and
  reality of the swimming-pool, the boats, the cricket or football field, the
  boys came back into the ill-ventilated class-rooms to pretend, or not even to
  pretend, an interest in languages not merely dead, but now, through a process
  of derivation and imitation from one generation to another, excessively
  decayed. The memory of school taken into after life from these establishments
  was a memory of going from games and sunshine and living interest into
  class-rooms of twilight, bad air, and sham enthusiasm for exhausted
  things.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Sanderson made his application 'for the headmastership of
  Oundle at an unusually favourable time. There were several men of exceptional
  enlightenment and intelligence upon the governing body of the school, and
  they were resolved to modernise Oundle thoroughly and well. To the innovators
  the very unorthodoxy of Sanderson's upbringing and qualifications was a
  recommendation, to their opponents they made him a shocking candidate, and
  the Grocers' Company was rent in twain over his application. It requires a
  little effort nowadays for us to understand just how undesirable a candidate
  this spectacled young man from Dulwich must have appeared to many of the
  older and riper 'grocers.'</p>

  <p>In the first place he was not in holy orders, and it was a fixed belief of
  many people&mdash;in spite of the fact that few of the clerically-ruled
  English public schools of that time could be described as hotbeds of
  chastity&mdash;that only clergymen in holy orders could maintain a
  satisfactory moral and religious tone. On the other hand, he had been a
  distinguished theological student. That, however, might involve heresy;
  English people have an instinctive perception of the corrosive effect of
  knowledge and intelligence upon sound dogma. Then he was not a public-school
  boy, and this might involve a loss of social atmosphere more important even
  than religion or morals. The almost natural grace of deportment that has
  endeared the English traveller and the English official to the foreigner, and
  particularly to the subject-races throughout the world, might fail under his
  direction. Moreover, he was no cricketer. He had no athletic distinction; a
  terrible come-down after the Rev. H. St. J. Reade. These were all grave
  considerations in those days. Against them weighed the growing dread of
  German efficiency that was already spreading a wholesome modesty throughout
  the commercial world of Britain. This young man from Dulwich might bring to
  Oundle, it was thought, the base but valuable gifts of technical science. And
  there was apparent in him a liveliness and energy uncommon among scholastic
  applicants. His seemed to be a bracing personality, and Oundle was in serious
  need of a bracing regime. The members who liked him liked him warmly, and he
  roused prejudices as warm; feeling seems to have run high at the decision,
  and he was appointed by a majority of one.</p>

  <p>The little world of Oundle heard of the new appointment with mixed and
  various feelings, in which there was no doubt a considerable amount of
  resentment. No man becomes headmaster of an established school without facing
  many difficulties. If he is promoted from among the staff of his predecessor
  old disputes and rivalries are apt to take on an exaggerated importance, and
  if he comes in from outside he finds a staff disposed to a meticulous defence
  of established usage. And the young couple from Dulwich came to the place in
  direct condemnation of its current condition and its best traditions. There
  can be no doubt that at the outset the school and town bristled defensively
  and unpleasantly to the newcomers.</p>

  <p>In one respect the old educational order had a great advantage over the
  new that Sanderson was to inaugurate. It had a completed tradition, and it
  provided the standards by which the new was tried. Whatever it taught was
  held to be necessary to education, and all that it did not know was not
  knowledge. By such tests the equipment of Sanderson was exhibited as both
  defective and superfluous. Moreover, the new system was confessedly
  undeveloped and experimental. It could not be denied that Sanderson might be
  making blunders, and that he might have to retrace his steps. People had been
  teaching the classics for three centuries; the routine had become so
  mechanical that it was done best by men who were intellectually and morally
  half asleep. It led to nothing; except in very exceptional cases it did not
  even lead to a competent use of either the Latin or Greek languages; it
  involved no intelligent realisation of history, it detached the idea of
  philosophy from current life, and it produced the dreariest artistic
  Philistinism, but there was a universal persuasion that in some mystical way
  it _educated._ The methods of teaching science, on the other hand, were still
  in the experimental stage, and had still to convince the world that even at
  the lowest levels of failure they constituted a highly beneficent
  discipline.</p>

  <p>I do not propose to disentangle here the story of Sanderson's first seven
  years of difficulty. He found the school and the town sullen and hostile, and
  he was young, eager, and irascible. The older boys had all been promoted upon
  classical qualifications, they were saturated with the old public-school
  tradition that Sanderson had come to destroy, and behind them were various
  members of a hostile and resentful staff inciting them to obstruction and
  mischief. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Sanderson was old enough or wise enough to
  disregard slights or to ignore mere gestures of hostility.</p>

  <p>Reminiscences of old boys in the official life give us glimpses of the way
  in which the old order fought against the new. Everything was done to
  emphasise the fact that Sanderson was 'no gentleman,' 'no sportsman,' 'no
  cricketer,' 'no scholar.' It is the dearest delusion of snobs everywhere that
  able men who have made their way in the world are incapable of acquiring a
  valet's knowledge of what is correct in dress and deportment, and the dark
  legend was spread that he wore a flannel shirt with a sort of false front
  called a 'dicky' and detachable cuffs, in place of the evening shirt of the
  genteel. Moreover, his dress tie was reported to be a made-up tie. Unless he
  is to undress in public I do not see how a man under suspicion is to rebut
  such sinister scandals. The boys, with the help and encouragement of several
  members of the staff, made up a satirical play full of the puns and classical
  tags and ancient venerable turns of humour usual in such compositions,
  against this Barbarian invader and his new laboratories. It was the mock
  trial of an incendiary found trying to burn down the new laboratories. It was
  'full of envenomed and insulting references' to all the new headmaster was
  supposed to hold dear. Finally it was rehearsed before him. He sat brooding
  over it thoughtfully, as shaft after shaft was launched against him. 'It
  didn't seem so funny then,' said my informant, 'as it had done when we
  prepared it.' It went to a 'ragged and unconvinced applause.' At the end
  'came a pause&mdash;a stillness that could be felt.' The headmaster sat with
  downcast face, thinking.</p>

  <p>I suppose he was chiefly busy reckoning how soon he would be rid of this
  hostile generation of elder boys. They had to go. It was a pity, but nothing
  was to be done with them. The school had to grow out of them, as it had to
  grow out of its disloyal staff.</p>

  <p>He rose slowly in his seat. 'Boys, we will regard this as the final
  performance,' he said, and departed thoughtfully, making no further comment.
  He took no action in the matter, attempted neither reproof nor punishment. He
  dropped the matter with a magnificent contempt. And, says the old boy who
  tells the story, from that time the spirit of the school seemed to change in
  his favour. The old order had discharged its venom. The boys began to real
  ise the true value of the forces of spite and indolent obstructiveness with
  which their youth was in alliance.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Not always did Sanderson carry things off with an equal
  dignity. His temperament was choleric, and ever and again his smouldering
  indignation at the obstinate folly and jealousy that hampered his work blazed
  out violently. Dignified silence is impossible as a permanent pose for a
  teacher whose duty is to express and direct. Sanderson's business was to get
  ideas into resisting heads; he was not a born orator but a confused, abundant
  speaker, and he had to scold, to thrust strange sayings at them, to force
  their inattention, to beat down an answering ridicule. He was often simply
  and sincerely wrathful with them, and in his early years he thrashed a great
  deal. He thrashed hard and clumsily in a white-heat of passion&mdash;'a hail
  of swishing strokes that seemed almost to envelop one.' A newspaper or
  copybook at the normal centre of infliction availed but little. Cuts fell
  everywhere on back or legs or fingers. He had been sorely tried, he had been
  overtried. It was a sort of heartbreak of blows.</p>

  <p>The boys argued mightily about these unorthodox swishings. It was all a
  part of Sanderson being a strange creature and not in the tradition. It was
  lucky no one was ever injured. But they found something in their own
  unregenerate natures that made them understand and sympathise with this
  eager, thwarted stranger and his thunderstorms of anger. Generally he was a
  genial person, and that, too, they recognised. It is manifest quite early in
  the story that Sanderson interested his boys as his predecessor had never
  done. They discussed his motives, his strange sayings, his peculiar locutions
  with accumulating curiosity. Two sorts of schoolmasters boys respect: those
  who are completely dignified and opaque to them, and those who are
  transparent enough to show honesty at the core. Sanderson was transparently
  honest. If he was not pompously dignified he was also extraordinarily free
  from vanity; and if he thrust work and toil upon his boys it was at any rate
  not to spare himself that he did so. And he won them also by his wonderful
  teaching. In the early days he did a lot of the science teaching himself;
  later on the school grew too big for him to do any of this. All the old boys
  I have been able to consult agree that his class instruction was
  magnificent.</p>

  <p>Every year in the history of Sanderson's headmastership shows a growing
  understanding between the boys and himself. 'Beans,' they called him, but
  every year it was less and less necessary to 'Give 'm Beans,' as the vulgar
  say. The tale of storms and thrashings dwindles until it vanishes from the
  story. In the last decade of his rule there was hardly any corporal
  punishment at all. The whole school as time went on grew into a humorous
  affectionate appreciation of his genius. It was a sunny, humorous school when
  I knew it; there was little harshness and no dark corners. No boy had been
  expelled for a long time.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The official life gives a diagram and particulars of the
  growth of the school during Sanderson's time, and there is no need to repeat
  those particulars here. From 1892 to 1900 there was no very remarkable
  increase in the number of boys; it rose from ninety-odd to a hundred and
  twenty or so. Then as Sanderson's grip became sure there followed a rapid
  expansion.</p>

  <p>From 1900 onwards Oundle grew about as fast as it was possible to grow.
  New laboratories were built, new subjects introduced so as to furnish a wider
  and wider variety of courses to meet such intellectual types as the school
  had hitherto failed to interest. There was a great development of biological
  and agricultural work from about 1909 onward. The attention given to art
  increased, and there was a great change and revolution in the history
  teaching. By 1920 the numbers of the school were soaring up towards six
  hundred. He wanted them to go to eight hundred, because he still wanted to
  increase the variety of courses, and the larger numbers gave a better
  prospect of classifying out the boys effectively and making I sure that each
  course of studies was sufficiently attended to keep it active and
  efficient.</p>

  <p>The prestige of the school grew even more rapidly than its size. From 1905
  onward the inquiring parent who wanted something more than school games and
  _esprit de corps_ was sure to hear of Oundle.</p>

  <p>And Sanderson was growing with his school. Every installment of success
  stimulated him to new experiments and fresh innovations. No one learnt so muc
  h at Oundle as he did, and it is with that growth of his conception of school
  method and his widening vision of the schoolmaster's role_ _in the world that
  we must now proceed to deal.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE REPLACEMENT OF COMPETITION BY GROUP
     WORK</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">When Sanderson first came to Oundle his ideas seem to have
  differed from the normal scholastic opinion of his time mainly in his
  conviction of the interestingness and attractiveness of real scientific work
  for many types of boys that the established classical and stylistic
  mathematical teaching failed to grip. He developed these new aspects of
  school work, and his earliest success lay in the fact that he got a higher
  percentage of boys interested and active in school work than was usual
  elsewhere, and that the report of this and the report of his wholesome and
  stimulating personality spread into the world of anxious parents. But it
  early became evident to him that the new subjects necessitated methods of
  handling in vivid contrast to the methods stereotyped for the classical and
  mathematical courses.</p>

  <p>There have been three chief phases in the history of educational method in
  the last five centuries, the phase of compulsion, the phase of competition,
  and the phase of natural interest. They overlap and mingle. Medieval teaching
  being largely in the hands of celibates, who had acquired no natural
  understanding of children and young people, and who found them extremely
  irritating, irksome, or exciting, was stupid and brutal in the extreme. Young
  people were driven along a straight and narrow road to a sort of prison of
  dusty knowledge by teachers almost as distressed as themselves. The medieval
  school went on to the chant of rote-learning with an accompaniment of blows,
  insults, and degradations of the dunce-cap type. The Jesuit schools, to which
  the British public schools owe so much, sought a human motive in vanity and
  competition; they turned to rewards, distinctions, and competitions. Sir
  Francis Bacon recommended them justly as the model schools of his time. The
  class-list with its pitiless relegation of two-thirds of the class to
  self-conscious mediocrity and dufferdom was the symbol of this second,
  slightly more enlightened phase. The school of the rod gave place to the
  school of the class-list. An aristocracy of leading boys made the pace and
  the rest of the school found its compensation in games or misbehaviour. So
  long as the sole subjects of instruction remained two dead languages and
  formal mathematics, subjects essentially unappetising to sanely constituted
  boys, there was little prospect of getting school method beyond this
  point.</p>

  <p>By the end of the eighteenth century schoolmasters were beginning to
  realise what most mothers know by instinct, that there is in all young people
  a curiosity, a drive to know, an impulse to learn, that is available for
  educational ends, and has still to be properly exploited for educational
  ends. It is not within our present scope to discuss Pestalozzi, Froebel, and
  the other great pioneers in this third phase of education. Nearly all
  children can be keenly interested in some subject, and there are some
  subjects that appeal to nearly all children. Directly you cease to insist
  upon a particular type of achievement in a particular line of attainment,
  directly your school gets out of the narrow lane and moves across open
  pasture, it goes forward of its own accord. The class-list and the rod, so
  necessary in the dusty fury of the lane, cease to be necessary. In the
  effective realisation of this Sanderson was a leader.</p>

  <p>For a time he let the classical and literary work of the school run on
  upon the old competition compulsion, class-list lines. For some years he does
  not seem to have realised the possibility of changes in these fields. But
  from the first in his mechanical teaching and very 'soon in ma thematics the
  work ceased to have the form of a line of boys all racing to acquire an
  identical parcel of knowledge, and took on the form more and more of clusters
  of boys surrounding an attractive problem. There grew up out of the school
  Science a periodic display, the Science Conversazione, in which groups of
  youngsters displayed experiments and collections they had co-operated to
  produce. Later on a Junior Conversazione developed. These conversaziones show
  the Oundle spirit in its most typical expression. Sanderson derived much from
  the zeal and interest these groups of boys displayed. He realised how much
  finer and how much more fruitful was the mutual stimulation of a common end
  than the vulgar effort for a class place. The clever boy under a class-list
  system loves the shirker and the dullard who make the running easy, but a
  group of boys working for a common end display little patience with shirking.
  The stimulus is much more intimate, and it grows. Jones minor is told to play
  up, exactly as he is told to play up in the playing field.</p>

  <p>In the summer term the conversazione in its fully developed form took up a
  large part of the energy of the school. Says the official life:</p>

  <p>'All the senior boys in the school were eligible for this work, the only
  qualification necessary being a willingness to work and to sacrifice some, at
  least, of one's free time. There was never any dearth of willing workers, the
  total number often exceeding two hundred. The chief divisions of the
  conversazione were: Physics and Mechanics; Chemistry; Biology; anti
  Workshops. A boy who volunteered to help was left free to choose which branch
  he would adopt. Having chosen, he gave his name to the master in charge; if
  he had any particular experiment in view, he mentioned it, and if suitable,
  it was allotted to him. If he had no suggestion, an experiment was suggested,
  and he was told where information could be obtained. As a general rule two or
  three boys worked together at anyone experiment.</p>

  <p>'Some of the experiments chosen required weeks of preparation; there was
  apparatus to be made and fitted up, information to be sought and absorbed, so
  that on the final day an intelligent account could be given to any visitor
  watching the experiment. This work was all done out of school hours. Four or
  five days before Speech Day, ordinary school lessons ceased for those taking
  part in the conversazione; the laboratories, class-rooms, and workshops were
  portioned out so that each boy knew exactly where he was to work, and how
  much space he had. The setting up of the experiments began. To anyone
  visiting the school on these particular days it must have seemed in a state
  of utter confusion, boys wandering about in all directions apparently under
  no supervision, and often to all appearances with no purpose. A party might
  be met with a jam-jar and fishing-net near the river; others might be found
  miles away on bicycles, going to a place where some particular flower might
  be found. Three or four boys would appear to be smashing up an engine and
  scattering its parts in all directions, while others could be seen wheeling a
  barrow-load of bricks or trying to mix a hod of mortar. Gradually a certain
  amount of order appeared, some experiments were tried and found to work
  satisfactorily, others failed, and investigation into the cause of failure
  had to be carried out. As the final day approached excitement increased,
  frantic telegrams were sent to know, for example, if the liquid air had been
  despatched, frequent visits to the railway-station were made in the hopes of
  finding some parcel had arrived; sometimes it was even necessary to motor to
  Peterborough to pick up material which otherwise would arrive too late. A
  programme giving a short description of the experiment or exhibit had to pass
  through the printer's hands. At last everything would be ready; occasionally,
  but very seldom, an experiment had to be abandoned or another substituted at
  the last moment.'</p>

  <p>The year 1905 marked a phase in the co-operative system of work on the
  mechanical side with the machining and erection of a six-horse-power
  reversing engine, designed for a marine engine of 3500 horse-power. Castings
  and drawings were supplied by the North Eastern Marine Engineering Works. The
  engine was a triumphant success, and thereafter a number of engines has been
  built by groups of boys. Concurrently with this steady replacement of the
  instructional-exercise system by the group-activity system, the mathematical
  work became less and less a series of exercises in style and more and more an
  attack upon problems needing solution in the workshops and laboratories, with
  the solution as the real incentive to the work. These dips into practical
  application gave a great stimulus to the formal mathematical teaching, for
  the boys realised as they could never have done otherwise the value of such
  work as a 'tool-sharpening' exercise of ultimately real value.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Quite early in his Oundle days Sanderson displayed his
  disposition towards collective as against solitary activity in his dealings
  with the school music. When he came to the school the 'musical' boys were
  segregated from the non-musical in a choir; the rest listened in conscious
  exclusion and inferiority. But from the outset he set himself to make the
  whole school sing and attend to music. The few boys with bad ears were
  carried along with the general flood; the discord they made was lost in the
  mass effect. Towards the end a very great proportion of the boys were keen
  listeners to and acute critics of music. They would crowd into the Great Hall
  on Sunday evenings to listen to the organ recital with which that day usually
  concluded.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Presently Sanderson began to apply the lessons he had learnt
  from grouping boys for scientific work to literature and history. Most of us
  can still recall the extraordinary dreariness of school literature teaching;
  the lesson that was a third-rate lecture, the note-taking, the rehearsal of
  silly opinions about books unread and authors unknown, the horrible annotated
  editions, the still more horrible text-books of literature. Sanderson set
  himself to sweep all this away. A play, he held, was primarily to be played,
  and the way to know and understand it was to play it. The boys must be cast
  for parts and learn about the other characters in relation to the one they
  had taken. Questions of language and syntax, questions of interpretation,
  could be dealt with best in relation to the production. But most classes had
  far too many boys to be treated as a single theatrical company, so small
  groups of boys were cast for each part. There would be three or four
  Othellos, three or four Desdemonas or Iagos. They would act their parts
  simultaneously or successively. The thing might or might not ripen into a
  chosen cast giving a costume performance in public. The important thing is
  that the boys were brought into the most active contact possible with the
  reality of the work they studied. The groups discussed stage 'business' and
  gesture and the precise stress to lay on this or that phrase. The master
  stood like a producer in the auditorium of the Great Hall. Let anyone compare
  the vitality of that sort of thing with the ordinary lesson from an annotated
  text-book.</p>

  <p>The group system was extended with increasing effectiveness into more and
  more of the literary and historical work. Here the School Library took the
  place of the laboratory and was indeed as necessary to the effective
  development of the group method. The official life of Sanderson gives a
  typical scheme of operations pursued in the case of a form studying the
  period 1783-1905. The subject was first divided up into parts, such as the
  state of affairs preceding the French Revolution; the French Revolution in
  relation to England; the industrial system and economic problems generally;
  and so on. The form divided up into groups and each group selected a part or
  a section of a part for its study. The objective of each group was the
  preparation of a report, illustrated by maps, schedules, and so forth, upon
  the section it had studied. After a preliminary survey of the whole field
  under the direction of a master, each boy followed up the particular matter
  assigned to him by individual reading for a term, supplemented when necessary
  by consultation with the master. Then came the preparation of maps and other
  material, the assembling of illuminating quotations from the books studied,
  the drafting of the group's report, the discussion of the report. In some
  cases where the group was in disagreement there would be a minority
  report.</p>

  <p>In this way there was scarcely a boy in the form who did not feel himself
  contributing and necessary to the general result, and who was not called upon
  not merely by his master but by his colleagues, for some special exertion. It
  might be thought that the departmentalising of the subject among groups would
  mean that the knowledge would accumulate in pockets, but this was not the
  case. Boys of separate groups talked with one another of their work and found
  a lively interest in their different points of view. It is rare that boys who
  have received the same lesson can find much in it to talk about, unless it is
  a comparison of who has retained most, but a boy who has been preparing maps
  of the Napoleonic military campaigns may find the liveliest interest in
  another who has been following the history of the same period from the point
  of view of sea power. There was indeed a very considerable amount of
  interchange, and when it came to facing external examiners and testing the
  general knowledge attained, the Oundle boys were found to compare favourably
  with boys who had been drummed in troops through complete histories of the
  chosen period.</p>

  <p>This group system of work had arisen naturally out of the conditions of
  the new laboratory teaching, and it had been developed for the sake of its
  educational effectiveness; but as it grew it became more and more evident to
  Sanderson that its effects went far beyond mere intellectual attainment. It
  marked a profound change in the spirit of the school. It was not only that
  the spirit of co-operation had come in. That had already been present on the
  cricket and football fields. But the boys were working to make something or
  to state something and not to gain something. It was the spirit of creation
  that now pervaded the school.</p>

  <p>And he perceived, too, that the boys he would now be sending out into the
  world must needs carry that creative spirit with them and play a very
  different part from the ambitious star boys who went on from a training under
  the older methods. They would play an as yet incalculable part in redeeming
  the world from the wild orgy of competition that was now afflicting it. In
  one of his very characteristic sermons he gave his ripened conception of this
  side of his work. He had been speaking, perhaps with a certain idealisation,
  of the old craftsmen's guilds&mdash;with a glance or so at the Grocers'
  Company. The school, he declared, was to be no longer an arena but a guild.
  For what was a guild?</p>

  <p>'A community of co-workers and no competition, that was its idea. It is
  all based on the system of apprenticeships and co-workers. The apprentices
  helped the masters in every way they could; even the masters were grouped
  together for mutual assistance and were called assistants. The Company was a
  mystery or guild of craftsmen and dealers, and their aim was to produce good
  craftsmen and good dealers.</p>

  <p>'To-day, in these days of renascence, we return to the aim and methods of
  the guilds. Boys are to be apprentices and master-workers and co-workers. In
  a community this needs must be. We are called to a definite work, all who are
  privileged to attend here, staff and boys alike&mdash;the work of infusing
  life into the boys committed to our care. Nor can anyone stand out of this
  and seek work elsewhere. Nemesis sets in for all who try to live for
  themselves alone. They may try to work&mdash;but their work is sterile. The
  community calls for the energies and activities of all. We are beginning to
  learn something of what this means. It does not mean an abandonment of the
  best methods of the past. But it does mean that we have to concern ourselves
  with the pressing needs and problems of to-day, and join in the work. I do
  not dwell on this now. My mind goes off to the possible effect of these ideas
  on the general life of the school.</p>

  <p>'The working of these ideas is well seen already in the outdoor life of
  the school. We see it when houses are getting their teams together to join a
  competition for a shield, say. We see the mutual help, the voluntary
  practice, the consultations of the captain with others. We see it in the work
  in the Cadet Corps. We see it in the preparation for a play&mdash;this time,
  the _Midsummer Night's Dream._ We see it in the new work in the library, and
  we see it as clearly as in anything in the preparation for a conversazione.
  No more valuable training can be given than this last-well worth all the many
  kinds of sacrifice it entails. From it, at any rate, the spirit of
  competition is, I think, altogether removed. Boys, we believe, set forth to
  do their work as well as they possibly can&mdash;but not to beat one
  another...I dwell upon these things because we hope that all boys will become
  workers at last, with interest and zeal, in some part of the field of
  creation and inquiry, which is the true life of the world. It is from such
  workers, investigators, searchers, the soul of the nation is drawn. We will
  first of all transform the life of the school, then the boys, grown into
  men&mdash;and girls from their schools grown into women&mdash;whom their
  schools have enlisted into this service, will transform the life of the
  nation and of the whole world.'</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS<br>
  BETWEEN SCHOOL AND REALITY</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">In the previous chapter I have told how Sanderson was taught
  by his laboratories and library the possibility of a new type of school with
  a new spirit, and how he grew to realise that an organisation of such new
  schools, a multiplication of Oundles, must necessarily produce a new spirit
  in social and industrial life. Concurrently with that, the obvious
  implications of applied science were also directing his mind to the close
  reaction between schools and the organisation of the economic life of the
  community.</p>

  <p>It is amusing to reflect that Sanderson probably owed his appointment at
  Oundle to the simple desire of various members of the Grocers' Company for a
  good school of technical science. They did not want any change in themselves,
  they did not want any change in the world nor in the methods of trading and
  employment, but they did want to see their sons and directors and managers
  equipped with the sharper, more modern edge of a technical scientific
  training. Germany had frightened them. If this new training could be
  technical without science and modern without liberality, so much the better.
  So the business man brought his ideas to bear upon Oundle, to produce quite
  beyond his expectation a counter-offensive of the school upon business
  organisation and methods. Oundle built its engines, organised itself as an
  efficient munitions factory during the war, made useful chemical inquiries,
  extended its work into agriculture, analysed soils and manures for the
  farmers of its district, ran a farm and did much able competent technical
  work, but it also set itself to find out what were the aims and processes of
  business and what were the reactions of these processes upon the life of the
  community. From the laboratory a boy would go to a careful examination of
  labour conditions under the light of Ruskin's _Unto This Last;_ he was
  brought to a balanced and discriminating attitude towards strikes and
  lock-outs; he was constantly reminded that the end of industry is not profits
  but life a more abundant life for men.</p>

  <p>As one reads through the sermons and addresses that are given in
  _Sanderson of Oundle_ one finds a steadily growing consciousness of the fact
  that there was a considerable and increasing proportion of Oundle boys
  destined to become masters, managers, and leaders in industrial and business
  life, and with that growing consciousness there is a growing determination
  that the school work they do shall be something very far beyond the
  acquisition of money-getting dodges and devices and commercialised views of
  science. More and more does he see the school not as a training ground of
  smart men for the world that is, but as a preliminary working model of the
  world that is to be.</p>

  <p>Two quotations from two of Sanderson's sermons will serve to mark how
  vigorously he is tugging back the English schools from the gentlemanly
  aloofness of scholarship and school-games to a real relationship to the
  current disorder of life, and how high he meant to carry them to dominance
  over that disorder.</p>

  <p>The first extract is from a sermon on Faraday. Under Sanderson, it has
  been remarked, Faraday ousted St. Anthony from being the patron saint of
  Oundle School. 'With what abundant prodigality,' Sanderson exclaims, 'has
  Nature given up of her secrets since his day!'</p>

  <p>'A hundred years ago Man and Nature as we think of them to-day were
  unexplored by science; to-day a new world, a new creation. Industrial life
  has developed, machinery, discoveries, inventions&mdash;steam engine, gas
  engine, dynamo&mdash;electrical machinery, telegraphy, radioactive bodies,
  tremendous openings out of chemistry, biology, economics, ethics. All new.
  These are Thy works, O God, and tell of Thee. Not now only may we search for
  Thy Presence in the places where Thou wert wont in days of old to come to
  man. Not there only. Not only now in the stars of heaven; or by the seashore,
  or in the waters of the river, or of the springs; among the trees, the
  flowers, the corn and wine, on the mountain or in the plain; not now only
  dost Thou come to man in Thy works of art, in music, in literature; but Thou,
  O God, dost reveal Thyself in all the multitude of Thy works; in the
  workshop, the factory, the mine, the laboratory, in industrial life. No
  symbolism here, but the Divine God. A new Muse is here:</p>

  <p>'Mightier than Egypt's tombs, Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples.
  Prouder than Milan's statued, spired cathedral, More picturesque than Rhenish
  castle-keeps, We plan even now to raise, beyond them all, Thy great
  cathedral, sacred industry, no tomb&mdash;A keep for Life.'</p>

  <p>'And the builders, a mighty host of men: Homeric heroes, fighting against
  a foe, and yet not a foe, but an invisible, impalpable thing wherein the
  combatant is the shadow of the assailant.</p>

  <p>'Mighty men of science and mighty deeds. A Newton who binds the universe
  together in uniform law; Lagrange, Laplace, Leibnitz with their wondrous
  mathematical harmonies; Coulomb measuring out electricity; Oversted with the
  brilliant flash of insight "that the electric conflict acts in a revolving
  manner"; Faraday, Ohm, Ampere, Joule, Maxwell, Hertz, Rontgen; and in another
  branch of science, Cavendish, Davy, Dalton, Dewar; and in another, Darwin,
  Mendel, Pasteur, Lister, Sir Ronald Ross. All these and many others, and some
  whose names have no memorial, form a great host of heroes, an army of
  soldiers&mdash;fit companions of those of whom the poets have sung; all, we
  may be sure, living daily in the presence of God, bending like the reed
  before His will; fit companions of the knights of old of whom the poets sing,
  fit companions of the men whose names are renowned in history, fit companions
  of the great statesmen and warriors whose names resound through the
  world.</p>

  <p>'There is the great Newton at the head of this list comparing himself to a
  child playing on the seashore gathering pebbles, whilst he could see with
  prophetic vision the immense ocean of truth yet unexplored before him. At the
  end is the discoverer Sir Ronald Ross, who had gone out to India in the
  medical service of the Army, and employed his leisure in investigating the
  ravishing diseases which had laid India low and stemmed its development. In
  twenty years of labour he discovers how malaria is transmitted and brings the
  disease wi thin the hold of man.'</p>

  <p>The second is from a sermon called 'The Garden of Life.'</p>

  <p>'As Canon Driver says, "Man is not made simply to enjoy life; his end is
  not pleasure; nor are the things he has to do necessarily to give pleasure or
  lead to what men call happiness." This is not the biological purpose of man.
  His purpose or instinctive end is to develop the capacities of the garden in
  the wilderness of nature; to adapt it to his own ends, i.e. to the ends of
  the races of men. Or, as we would now say, his aim is to take his part in the
  making of his kind; and he is to "keep it," or guard it&mdash;i.e. he is to
  conquer the jungle in it, to prevent it from roving wild again, from
  reverting to the jungle, from losing law and order, from becoming unruly and
  disorderly, from breaking loose and running amok. He is to bring and maintain
  order out of the tangle of things, he is to diagnose diseases; he is to
  co-ordinate the forces of nature; he is above all things to reveal the spirit
  of God in all the works of God.</p>

  <p>'And in all this we read the duty and service of schools. The business of
  schools is through and by the use of a common service to get at the true
  spiritual nature of the ordinary things we have to deal with. The spirit of
  the true active life does not come to us _only_ in those experiences we have
  been so accustomed to think of as beautiful and revealing. The active spirit
  of life is not revealed simply by the arts-the beautiful arts as they may be
  thought-of music or painting, or literature. These indeed may be only and
  abundantly _material,_ and the eye and ear may be blind and deaf to the
  active, creative, discovering, revealing spirit. "Painting, or art generally,
  as such," says Ruskin in his _Modern Painters,_ "with all its technicalities,
  difficulties, executive skills, pleasant and agreeable sensations, and its
  particular ends, is nothing but an expressive language, invaluable if we know
  it as we might know it as the vehicle of thought, but by itself nothing." He
  who has learnt what is commonly considered as the whole art of painting, that
  is the art of representing any natural object faithfully, has as yet only
  learnt the language by which his thoughts are to be expressed. One language
  or mode of expression may be more difficult than another; but it is not by
  the mode of representing and saying, but by the greatness, the awakening, the
  transmuting and transfiguring conception and knowledge of the thought
  presented, that the gift cometh, that man is created. Awkward, discordant,
  stammering attempts may be the burning message of a new hope. But this
  "voice" of art is too often drowned. It is drowned by executive
  skill&mdash;as is the history of all art-when this skill stretches itself to
  present things that are static, motionless, dead...</p>

  <p>'It is especially our duty to reveal the spirit of God in the things of
  science and of the practical life. Herein lies a new revelation, a new
  language, a direct symbolism. Science, just like art and music, can be
  materialistic&mdash;science can aim only at mechanical advancement and
  worldly wealth, which is not wealth at all&mdash;just as art can aim only at
  pleasure, desire, and drawing-room appreciation. But this need not be so.
  Certainly no one in a responsible position can teach science for long without
  the coming of the revelation of a new voice, a new method of expression, a
  new art&mdash;revealing quite changed standards of value, quite new
  significances of what we speak of as culture, beauty, love, justice. A new
  voice speaks to the souls of men and women calling for a new age with all its
  altered relationships and adventures of life.</p>

  <p>'With eyes opened to this new art you can wander through the science block
  and find in it all a new Bible, a new book of Genesis. So we believe. This is
  our duty and our faith. Into this Paradise have you been placed to dress it
  and to keep it.'</p>

  <p>Let me turn from these two passages of talk to his boys&mdash;they are
  rescued from a mass of pencil notes in his study&mdash;to a passage from an
  address delivered in the Great Hall in Leeds in 1920. It shows very plainly
  the quality of his conception of what I have called the return of schools to
  reality.</p>

  <p>'Schools should be miniature copies of the world. We often find that
  methods adopted in school are just the methods we should like applied in the
  state. We should, in fact, direct school life so that the spirit of it may be
  the spirit which will tend to alleviate social and industrial conditions. I
  will give an example of the kind of influence the ideals and methods of a
  school can exert upon the working life. I will take a condition of labour
  which is now recognised as probably the greatest of tragedies. It is the slow
  decay of the faculties of crowds of men and women, caused by the nature of
  their employment&mdash;the tragedy of the unstretched faculties. So common is
  it, and ordinary, that we pass it by on one side; but no one can go into a
  factory without seeing workers engaged in work which is far below their
  capacities. Decay sets in, and the death of talent and enthusiasm, the
  inspirer of creative work. A little thought will convince us that the process
  of decay of such a delicate and vital organism as the brain is bound to set
  up violent, destructive, anarchic forces which go on for several years. A
  recent writer in the _Times Educational Supplement_ (and this paper cannot be
  called revolutionary) says that the tragedy of undeveloped talent is being
  seen more and more to be a gigantic waste of potentiality and an unpardonable
  cruelty. It is a tragic disease and produces in early life startling
  intellectual and moral disturbances, which are the natural sources of unrest.
  As years go on a mental stupor sets in, and there is peace, but peace on a
  low plane of life. The loss to the community by this waste is colossal, and
  it is not too much to say that the output of man could be multiplied beyond
  conception.</p>

  <p>'Schools should send boys out into the industrial world whose aim should
  be to study these tragedies, and by experiments, by new inventions, by
  organisation, try, we may hope, by some of their own school experience, to
  alleviate the disease. To my mind this is the supreme aim of schools in the
  new era.'</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Before I go on to a discussion of the latest, broadest, and
  most interesting phase of Sanderson's mental life, I would like to give my
  readers as vivid a picture as I can of his personality and his methods of
  delivery. I have tried to convey an impression of his stout and ruddy
  presence, his glancing spectacles, his short, compact but allusive delivery,
  his general personal jolliness. I will give now a sketch of one of his
  Scripture lessons made by two of the boys in the school. Nothing I think
  could convey so well his rich discursiveness nor the affectionate humour he
  inspired throughout the school. Here it is.</p>

  portion of the Sermon on the Mount.')</p>

  <p>'(The headmaster enters, worries his gown, sits down, adjusts his
  waistcoat, and coughs once.)</p>

  <p>'The&mdash;um&mdash;er&mdash;I am taking you through the Gospel of St.
  Matthew. I think, as a matter of fact, we got to the end of the third
  chapter. We won't spend much time over the fourth. The fourth, I think, is
  the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Temptations, which I have already taken with
  you&mdash;a rather&mdash;er&mdash;very interesting&mdash;ah&mdash;very
  interesting&mdash;er&mdash;survival. That the Temptation Narrative should
  have survived shows that there is probably something of value in it or I do
  not think it would have survived. There are two incidents of very similar
  character of&mdash;er&mdash;very&mdash;er&mdash;similar character
  and&mdash;ah&mdash;different to a certain extent from everything
  else&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;There is a boy in that corner not listening to
  me. Who is that boy in the corner there? No, not you&mdash;two rows in front.
  I will come down to you later, my boy. There are two incidents in the Gospel
  Narrative which are similar in&mdash;er&mdash;character and which I have for
  the moment called "Survivals"&mdash;very characteristic, namely, the somewhat
  surprising narrative of the Temptation of our Lord, and the other the account
  of the Transfiguration. These are different in form and character from other
  narratives, just in the same way as the account of our Lord sending messages
  to the Baptist differs from others. Er&mdash;yes&mdash;that last one. I
  should put them together as coming from a similar source (lapse into
  inaudibility&mdash;bow wow wow. Unique in characteristic&mdash;bow wow
  wow-Somewhat subtle&mdash;bow wow). One remarks that the Temptations are
  always looked at from the personal point of view, which I have put down in my
  synopsis. Has anybody here got my synopsis? lend it to me a moment. I don't
  think the personal significance of the Gospel stories has importance
  nowadays. We needn't consider it. That's what I think about things in
  general. Personal importance giving place to universal needs. We are not so
  much concerned with whether boys do evil or not. Of course it annoys me if I
  find a boy doing evil. Leading others astray. Shockingly annoying. Oughtn't
  to be. Like continuous mathematics not enabling a boy to pass in
  arithmetic&mdash;bow wow wow&mdash;screw loose. See what I mean,
  K&mdash;&mdash;? Not referring to you, my boy (laughter). Hunt me up
  something in Plato about all these things. During the last
  generation&mdash;</p>

  <p>'(Half a page omitted.)</p>

  <p>'Just in the same way from another point of view shall we live for own
  advancement, which we are continually tempted to do? It's awfully annoying if
  you do certain things and people won't recognise them. I was pretty heftily
  annoyed myself at a meeting of the Oxford and Cambridge Board. Professor
  Barker&mdash;great man&mdash;I nearly always agree with him. Professor
  Barker. They had made science compulsory for the school certificate. Bow wow
  wow. I don't want boys turned aside from their main purpose to have to get up
  scraps and snippets of science. Literary pursuits and so on. I wouldn't have
  it at any price. Bow wow wow. Modern languages are compulsory too. By looking
  at a boy's French set I can tell whether he can pass or not. Bow wow.
  Professor Barker proposed that science should be voluntary. I seconded him,
  but I said that languages should be voluntary as well. He didn't see that at
  all. Isn't it enough to make a man angry?</p>

  <p>'(Half a dozen lines omitted from our note as incomprehensible.)</p>

  <p>'Now I am inclined to think that Satan in this Gospel is not intended to
  be the Satan of our minds&mdash;the prince of evil. He is in tended to be
  more like the Satan in the book of Job. He is the devil's advocate. He argues
  for the other side. For the opposition. He is put up to create opposition.
  This may in itself be a valuable thing. I don't know that I need go further
  into it. I would just like to tell you this, boys. Some modern writers,
  especially Bernard Shaw, have a very high esteem for the devil. He[*] prefers
  hell to heaven. So he says. Of course he hasn't been there, so he can't tell.
  So he is voted a dangerous personage because, dear souls, they don't know
  what he means. What _he_ means is that heaven as it has been run down to and
  God as He has been run down to&mdash;everything placid and simple and
  inactive and non-creative and sleepy. People don't worship God. They worship
  (burble burble). They don't disturb their minds and think about things.
  That's what he means. Yes. Man and Superman. Activity of intellect. That's
  more or less what he has in mind. He prefers people doing something
  outrageously wrong than doing nothing at all. I don't know if it's true; it's
  all expressed in Greek thought.</p>

  <p>[* Mr. Shaw]</p>

  <p>'(Four pages omitted on running with the tide, Lloyd George, the
  importance of French in examinations, and the correct way of getting a true
  national spirit.)</p>

  <p>'Well, our Lord now proceeded to found His Galilean Ministry. And what was
  the first thing He did, L&mdash;&mdash;? It's quite obvious. What did He do?
  Obvious. Were you thinking of what I said just now? No, sir. My stream of
  words goes over you, not through you. Obvious. Now what was the first thing
  He did? What is obviously the first thing He did? Why, it's painfully
  obvious, even to L&mdash;&mdash;. What was it? What? Where are we,
  L&mdash;&mdash;? L&mdash;&mdash; has lost the place. Which paragraph do I
  mean, L&mdash;&mdash;? Read the paragraph I mean. No. I have finished that.
  Next one. Obvious. What is it about? Yes, what is it about? What is it about?
  Two or four? Yes, four! Now what is obvious? Obvious! Now you've just got it,
  and you're ten minutes behind. Of course. The first obvious thing He had to
  do was to get a band of faithful disciples. Very first thing He did. What did

  <p>'Now the&mdash;er&mdash;the Sermon on the Mount. You have heard this ever
  since you were on your mother's knee. At least I hope so. Beyond the
  historical times of your memory. For you, the Sermon on the Mount is as old
  as the ages. And yet I dare trespass on the Sermon on the Mount. "I've heard
  of it before," you say. "I'm tired of it. Do something fresh." Boys, you must
  go and read old things and breathe into them the new Spirit of Life. Now what
  is that chapter in Ezekiel, boys? Do you know the number of the page, and the
  paragraph, and the chapter? No. What am I talking about? Why, the valley of
  dry bones. Never heard of it! No. Is it in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or where, or
  Habakkuk? Is it in Ezekiel 1? No.36? No.37? Yes. Dry Bones. Bones. Yes.
  That's what. I am going to take you to a valley of dry bones. Dry Bones.
  Bones. It is your business to go into the dry bones of the past and cover
  them with flesh, and breathe into them the new Spirit. I often read the
  Sermon on the Mount. It never bores me. I have more excuse to be bored than
  you. I learned it, gracious goodness, how long ago! Beyond Historic times. I
  loved it as a boy. Dry Bones.</p>

  <p>'(Three pages on the Sermon on the Mount.)</p>

  <p>'Now yesterday was Empire Day. Why did you want me to put the flag up?
  Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves! Is not that it? (Yes, sir.) Dear
  boys! I wouldn't throw cold water on it for worlds. Well, you had your flag.
  It didn't fly. There was no wind behind it. There was no devil to blow it.
  Dear boys, you wanted that flag for a reason I think a shade wrong. It
  wouldn't be within the-what's the word I want?&mdash;suited for our modern
  gauges. The new world won't come until we give up the idea of Conquest and
  Extension of Empire&mdash;no new kingdom until its members are imbued with
  the principles that competition is wrong, that conquest is wrong, that
  co-operativeness is right, and sacrifice a law of nature. Now, how do the
  seven Beatitudes read with _Rule Britannia?_ Now you say you believe in your
  Bibles. You say you are Christians. Pious Christians. You would be most
  annoyed if I called you heathens. Well, if so, you believe that these are
  right:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Rule
  Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Rule
  Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Rule
  Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they
  shall be filled. Britannia rules the waves!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Rule
  Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see all that is worth
  seeing and living for. Wave your flag! Rule Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Rule
  Britannia!</p>

  <p>'Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness sake. Rule
  Britannia! It is incongruous...</p>

  <p>'Dear souls! My dear souls! I wouldn't lead you astray for anything. I
  can't explain it...this national spirit of yours. Beneath it all there is a
  spirit of great righteousness. I wouldn't tamper with it for thousands of
  pounds. But you must just see the other side...</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Now that was the key in which Sanderson dealt with his boys
  and in which he gave his message to the world. And that is also the key in
  which they dealt with him. I want to clear out of the reader's mind any idea
  that this great teacher of men was a solemn and superior person, clear,
  exact, and exalted, and that his boys had any vague sentimental worship for
  him. They laughed at him, loved him, understood him, assimilated his ideas,
  and worked with him. He was much more like a sweating, panting, burly leader
  pushing a way for himself and others through a thorny thicket. And when I sat
  in his study and read over the notes of his sermons and scripture lessons I
  got the same impression of a sturdy fighter thrusting through a tangle.</p>

  <p>Al together there were several hundred of these sermon-memoranda. He would
  take a quire of manuscript paper and write down his notes, not headings
  merely but sentences, writing very fast, missing out halves of words, leaving
  phrases incomplete. The result would be a little book with perhaps a title
  and a date scribbled on the back page. The dozen specimen sermons in the
  official Life were mostly taken from these rough drafts. There was also a
  quantity of printed sermons dating from his earliest days at Oundle. So that
  it was possible to trace his development from the days when every heretical
  utterance was jealously noted, to the days of complete freedom of thought and
  expression.</p>

  <p>He came into the interlaced briars and brakes of modern religious thought,
  a trained theological student, but already a very broad one, far from the
  trite materialistic superstitions of the narrowly orthodox. 'Of what is
  termed "definite religious teaching" his boys received little,' says one of
  his clerical assistants. 'The Head fought shy of anything which he felt might
  cramp a boy's tendency to think for himself and develop his own views.'</p>

  <p>This is far from the old days of salvation by belief.</p>

  <p>He took Christ as the central figure in his teaching. In his early days he
  had prepared a parallel arrangement of the gospels, and this developed into
  his _Synopsis of the Life of Christ._ He seems to have clung stoutly to the
  authenticity of the recorded sayings of Christ, but he held himself free to
  doubt whether we have as yet 'got to the bottom of many sayings of the
  Master.' And, says the same witness, at once rather vaguely and rather
  illuminatingly: 'He brushed aside impatiently doubts as to the feasibility of
  this miracle or that. To any who seemed to be worrying about the actual
  turning of water into wine at Cana he would urge that they were missing the
  whole point; cold, lifeless water was turned into warm, life-giving
  wine&mdash;and this was the work of the Master and His new teaching. Could
  they doubt that? He seemed to feel acutely that the passing of the centuries
  is liable to bring a distortion as well as an enrichment of the Christian
  revelation, and for that reason he was always trying to meditate himself, and
  to get others to meditate, on the true characteristics of the Master in the
  earliest portraits of Him handed down to us in the Gospels.'</p>

  <p>Like all religious teachers he emphasised some aspects of the general
  doctrine in preference to others, but his accent was never on the sacramental
  or ceremonial side. The root ideas of orthodox Christianity, the ideas of sin
  and an atonement, never very prominent in his teaching, faded more and more
  from his discourses as the years went on. He never seems to have had much
  sense of sin, and he laid an increasing stress on action, on courage and
  experiment. One saying he repeated endlessly, 'Give, and it shall be given
  unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall
  men give into your bosom.' Still more frequently he quoted, 'I came that ye
  might have life, and that ye might have it more abundantly.' In his later
  days that had become a new motto for Oundle School; it ousted 'God grant
  Grace' from the boys' thoughts in much the same way that Faraday for all
  spiritual purposes ousted St. Anthony as the patron saint of the school. And
  in the later sermons one would find side by side with Gospel sayings,
  exhortations from quite another quarter. The boys were told to 'live
  dangerously.' The Christ of later Oundle became indeed a very Nietzschean
  Christ.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Orthodox Christianity is built upon the doctrine of the Fall
  of Man and the damnation of mankind, but I could find only the rarest and
  remotest allusions to this ground beneath the Christian corner-stone of
  salvation in the bale of sermons I examined. There is no evidence that
  Sanderson ever denied the fallen state of man, but he never alluded to it,
  and the general effect of his teaching went far beyond a mere avoidance. As
  his teaching developed, another word, a word infrequent in the gospels,
  became dominant, the word 'creative.' For any mention of 'salvation' you will
  find twenty repetitions of 'creative.' So far as I can gather he took the
  word from a hitherto unrecognised Christian father, St. Bertrand Russell. And
  I should submit the following passage from a sermon on The Garden of Life, to
  any competent theological body with very grave doubts whether they would
  accept it as consistent with the teaching of any recognised Christian
  Church.</p>

  <p>'God had created man, and had moulded and fashioned him, and had breathed
  into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul, possessed
  of the divine and eternal indestructible spirit, the God-like spirit which
  would fill him with the glorious and life-giving spirit of unrest, of
  unsatisfied longings and desire, of the instinctive natural urge to have more
  of life. A mighty power, a dynamic creative force, a daemonic increasing
  urge&mdash;against which the forces of hell, of destructiveness, of caprice,
  of lawlessness, of the jungle, cannot prevail. Under this power man and the
  races of man progress: but without this mental fight, this constant struggle,
  no life can come. I dwelt on this fact last time I spoke to you, having in
  mind the mental or intellectual aspect of it, especially for those of you who
  are working for some searching examinations: for without a persistent,
  painful, and often enough disappointing effort the understanding of things
  will not come to you, or to any of us.</p>

  <p>'Be true to yourselves, suffer no artifice, or artificial understanding,
  to throw dust in your eyes. Do not struggle for a static victory. Be true to
  yourselves. Do not struggle for your recognition, as it were, or for the mere
  appearance of knowledge&mdash;rather struggle to enter into the kingdom, the
  kingdom of service.</p>

  <p>'And where can you find the inspiration and urge of life The source is
  wonderfully drawn out for us in the illuminating and suggestive commentary on
  Genesis you have the advantage to study. A great human book is Canon Driver's
  _Commentary,_ digging out for us the deep truths of life embedded in the
  ancient myths of Genesis. A study in the use of words; of what we can learn
  from words; a new form of text-book. Such a text-book as we should have for
  the new era. This picture of the coming and making of man tells us a story of
  the widest applicability. It is found in all the works of God; it is found in
  all our surroundings; it is found in all our work and toil; it is found most
  fully and actively in all our daily working life. God, we are told, made a
  garden for man, and there He placed him and gave him charge of it; and there
  the Lord God came and walked with man, and communed with man, and breathed
  into his nostrils the breath of life. And there He gave him his chief aim of
  life, his one purpose. And the Lord God took man, and put him in the Garden
  of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. And then with the memory and order of
  that garden in his mind He permitted him to receive knowledge, and then sent
  him out into the great wilderness to find his garden there.'</p>

  <p>And here is another passage from a sermon entitled 'Creative.'</p>

  <p>'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was
  waste and void. The world was in chaos, darkness, and gloom. But it was not
  to be left in this state. All this condition of anarchy, this waste and void,
  was the material out of which a new world was to be created. Confused and
  impossible though everything appeared, yet there was something present that
  made steadfastly and incessantly for order. So we believe it is now, in the
  present state of things. All the conflicts and strifes of to-day are the
  breaking up of the fallow ground. They are the effort to create life. The:
  are the messengers of the coming of the Son of Man. In storm and tempest
  cometh the Son of Man. Over all this lawless, shapeless, impossible material
  of chaos there brooded, we are told, the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God was
  brooding over the waters like a bird over its nest, and in due time, in the
  order of creation, a new life was to take shape, and a new world was to rise
  up. In stately, ordered, majestic manner with all the certainty and
  irresistible power of gravitation, step by step, stage by stage, out of the
  welter of anarchy, a life&mdash;a new life&mdash;was to come into the world.
  A new life came.</p>

  <p>'And at each stage we hear the words of the Lord God, "Let there be," and
  "there was." And then: "God saw tha tit was good." There was evening, and
  there was morning&mdash;darkness changed into light&mdash;and the day's work
  was done. And God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p>'So, too, it is and will be in the history of the human race. The
  uplifting of mankind, the coming of fuller life to nations, to man, to
  classes and sections of men, has come in epochs of change. Such stages in
  history are like the stages in the life history of a plant. There seem to be
  resting phases, epochs of apparent quiescence, the cessation of struggle.</p>

  <p>'The fact is that some new freedom, some new principle of life, some
  desire to grow, has for a long time been taking root in the minds and souls
  of men. The urge to become more creative&mdash;to gain more of life and give
  more of life&mdash;becomes at last intense. And there is an immense desire to
  satisfy the great urge of nature. The old order passes. The gathered forces
  seek release. The pangs of birth are upon us.'</p>

  <p>The further one goes with Sanderson, the stronger is one's sense of new
  wine fermenting in the old bottle of orthodox Christian formulae. In one of
  the late sermons he deliberately sets aside the Epistles of the New Testament
  as of less account than the gospels. He was still diverging when he died. In
  the last year or so of his life a new word crept into his talk and played an
  increasingly important part in it. That word was 'syncretism.' He spoke of it
  more and more plainly as an evil thing. And I cannot but believe, knowing his
  sources of knowledge and the angle at which he approached history, that he
  must have been aware that doctrinal Christianity&mdash;as detached from the
  personal teaching of Jesus&mdash;is, with its Mithraic blood sacrifice and
  Sabbath keeping, its Alexandrine trinity, its Egyptian priests, shaven and
  celibate, its Stella Maris and infant Horus, the completest example of a
  syncretic religion in the world. My impression is that if he had lived
  another two years he would have shed his last vestiges of theological
  paraphernalia and gone straight back to the teaching of the Nazarene, openly
  and plainly. And that would have created a very embarrassing situation for
  the members of the Grocers' Company, in the school at Oundle.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">And what creed was taking the place of the old theological
  tangle? What interpretation was Sanderson putting upon this ever-new teaching
  of Christ in the world, that he was stripping so steadily out of its
  irrelevant casings of dogma and superstition? I cannot do better in answer to
  that than quote from one of his latest sermons, a sermon delivered on the
  reassembly of the school at the opening of a new school year.</p>

  <p>'The fundamental instinct of life is to create, to make, to discover, to
  grow, to progress. Every on in some form or other has experience of this joy
  of creating; the joy of seeing the growth, the building, the change, the
  coming. The instinct of those in authority has recognised&mdash;without
  perhaps knowing it&mdash;the love to create, when they devised
  punishment&mdash;the treadmill, prisons, routine, all thwarting that free
  creative impulse to the point of torture. Or on a minor scale the trivial
  school stupidities and idlenesses of 'lines'; detentions without labour or
  sacrifice or both; or even the cheap and easy physical punishment. Such
  punishment, if not all inflicted punishment, springs out of the distinctive
  protective aim of slavery. Creative life comes slowly.</p>

  <p>'Life, this beautiful, creative life, comes slowly through the ages, but
  it comes. Slowly mankind is emerging out of slavery into the beautiful
  freedom of creative life. Slowly mankind is realising the natural desire, the
  instinctive natural urge, the essential need for life-of each individual to
  be free. Free&mdash;i.e. free to strive, to endeavour, to reach on wards, to
  create, to make, to beget. The economic freedom of the individual has been
  slowly escaping throughout history. It burst into a new vigorous life through
  the hammering blows of the French Revolution. During the last century or more
  this principle of freedom has been changing our political relationships and
  values. This economic escape may be said to have reacted on science, and the
  modern developments of evolution have benefited by the spreading change in
  the temper of mind, and by the influx of workers and creative thinkers from
  the enslaved order.</p>

  <p>'And this raises a large question which I have in mind this morning.
  Everyone can see to-day the immensity of the problems before the world. It
  does not need much reflection, or foresight, or knowledge, to see that the
  organisation of the intercourse of races is hurrying on to becoming a
  dangerous problem. As has been said, and as anyone I think with powers of
  sight can see, it is in a large sense a race between education and
  catastrophe. And the question we in schools have to ask is, Can we in schools
  be outside all this Can we confine our work, our play, our necessary work,
  our necessary play, to the recognised, traditional work or play of schools We
  here think not. We believe that schools should move on towards becoming
  always a microcosm of the new world. A microcosm, and experiment, of the
  standards of value, of the commandments, the statutes and judgments, of the
  organisation, of the visions and aims of a coming world. We must not get into
  our heads that these are theoretical things, it may be pure idealistic sort
  of things, or, it may be new and dangerous things. They are none of these
  things&mdash;they can be expressed in very everyday, homely, matter-of-fact
  things and in the doing of our ordinary work. Of course they do mean thought,
  a tendency to believe, a faith in boys&mdash;and they do mean labour, and
  sacrifice-as they are called or thought of at first&mdash;until both pass on
  into the beautiful life.</p>

  <p>'Such aims and urges become terrific powers for prolonging the life of
  man; and as the stream of life goes on it becomes more and more like a vast
  river moving slowly forward with great power, receiving more and more of
  tributaries, slowly, strongly, surely flowing on "unto the estuary that
  enlarges, and spreads itself grandly as it pours its waters into the great
  ocean of sea."</p>

  <p>'But the beginnings are here: and here boys must find themselves in the
  great stream of true life. They must find themselves in the land of the great
  vision, of faith, of service. No beating or marking of time here. No easy
  static state. No satisfaction with conventional static comfort. Here they
  will join in this great world-life. They came from their homes to join the
  great world-lif here. Even these tiny boys here will feel that something is
  before them that matters, something of true life and true intent. They will
  get the germs of life from some of those things we are perpetually trying to
  do, and never succeeding in doing. They will catch the contagion of effort.
  For learning is not our object here, but doing. They may learn things in a
  deadly static way, they may learn much in a static way and gain nothing of
  life. Not here, I hope. No, the germs of life come from the spirit; from the
  incessant travail of the soul; from high intent; they come from the burning
  desire to know of the things that are coming into the world...'</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE WAR AND SANDERSON'S<br>
  AND PROPAGANDA OF RECONSTRUCTION</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">The disaster of the great war came to Sanderson as a
  tremendous distressful stimulant, a monstrous and tragic turn in human
  affairs that he had to square with his aims and teaching. He had had our
  common awareness of its possibility, and yet when the crash came it took him,
  as it took most of us, by surprise. At first he accepted the war as a dire
  heroic necessity. This aggression of a military imperialism had to be faced
  valiantly. That was how he saw it. Both his sons joined up at the earliest
  possible moment, and the school braced itself up to train its senior boys as
  officers, to help in the production of munitions, to produce aviators,
  gunners and engineers for the great service of the war.</p>

  <p>The practical quality of the old boys from Oundle became apparent at once.
  They stepped from laboratory and factory and office into commissions; they
  returned from all over the world to prepare for the battlefields. By 1918
  over a thousand Oundle boys had gone into the fighting services, three had
  V.C.'s, many had been mentioned in despatches, awarded the Military Cross and
  the like.</p>

  <p>He did his best to find God and creative force in the world convulsion.
  Here is a part of an address to the Church Parade of the Cadet Corps which
  shows his very fine and very human struggle to impose a nobility of
  interpretation upon the grim distressful last stages of the war.</p>

  <p>'It is a pleasant thing to wander about these fields and watch the cadets
  who are told off to instruct their squads. It is a splendid illustration of
  the power of co-operation in education-where boys and men, or where a
  community work together, teaching one another, learning one from the other,
  where all are teachers and scholars, a body of co-workers, helping,
  encouraging, stimulating each other. This community method is dominant
  wherever there is a great stirring, e.g. a great call, a great pressing into
  a new kingdom; wherever there is a great discovery and a new need. The war
  will establish it in schools.</p>

  <p>'And just one word when you go forth from here. You will carry this mutual
  co-operative spirit with you. You will love your men, take care of their
  interests, making full use of their individual faculties, and learn to be
  co-workers with them.</p>

  <p>'It is often said that wars will never cease that they are a
  necessity&mdash;and in a sense this is true. One thing we know quite well,
  that in all affairs of life _peace_ may be simply the peace of death. There
  is the peace of lifelessness, of inactivity, notwithstanding all its autumnal
  beauty. There is the quiet peace which changes not, the conventional belief,
  the conventional kind of round of work, with lack of initiative, of
  experiment, of testing and trials. There is the peace which follows on
  contentment with things as they are, the peace of death. The land of peace
  and of convention, and of cruel contentment. The land of dark Satanic
  mills&mdash;as in Blake's imagery. War may come to break up this deathful
  peace. So said John Ruskin. I have a letter written to me just when the war
  broke out. In July 1914 the O.T.C. was inspected by General Birkbeck, and in
  his speech he expressed his belief that war was coming. On 2nd August, 1914,
  he wrote to me:</p>

  <p>'"DEAR MR. SANDERSON,&mdash;We little thought when I spoke to those boys
  of yours how near we were to our trial!" and he adds: "These are the words of
  a peaceful philosopher, Mr. Ruskin, when concluding a series of lectures on
  War at Woolwich Royal Academy Institution, which may give you comfort. Men
  talk of peace and plenty, of peace and learning, of peace and civilisation;
  but I found that those are not the words which the muse of history has
  coupled together! On her lips the words are Peace and Selfishness, Peace and
  Sensuality, Peace and Death!!! I learned, in short, that all great nations
  learned their truth of word and strength of thought in war; that they were
  taught by war and betrayed by peace&mdash;trained by war and deceived by
  peace&mdash;nourished in war and decayed in peace; in a word, that they were
  born in war and expired in peace."</p>

  <p>'This is the prophet's call to arise and awaken out of sleep; to abandon
  the easy life of routine and routine's belief. It is a call to rise up and
  breathe life into the dry bones of the past; it is the trumpet blast for
  active warfare against all things that have become lifeless and dead. It is
  the herald call for a new army, to build up a new world of active, creative,
  dynamic Peace.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">In April 1918 his eldest son, Roy, died of wounds at
  Estaires after the battle of the Lys. Loss after loss of boys and trusted
  colleagues had grieved and distressed him; now came this culminating blow.
  There had been the closest understanding between father and son; Roy had left
  engineering to become a master at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, which
  Sanderson had helped to reconstruct, and more and more had the father looked
  to his boy as his chosen disciple and possible successor.</p>

  <p>On the Whitsunday following Sanderson preached a sermon on the text: 'I
  will not leave you desolate, I will come unto you.' The notes of the sermon
  were untidy, and have had to be carefully pieced together, but I think they
  rise to a very high level of poetry. And when 1 copy them out I think how the
  dear sturdy man in his academic gown must have stood up and clung to his
  desk, after his manner, full of grief and sorrowful memories of the one
  'gentle soul,' in particular, and of many other gentle souls, he had
  lost&mdash;clinging to his desk with both hands as he clung to his faith and
  speaking stoutly.</p>

  <p>'Whitsunday&mdash;White Sunday&mdash;white, pure, untainted&mdash;day of
  consolation&mdash;day of inspiration&mdash;perhaps the most joyous time of
  all the year. Spring in its power, life, Spirit of Peace, joy. Everywhere
  joy&mdash;sanctified, subdued. Joy, and peace, and new life in the music, the
  harmonies and discords, of Nature&mdash;here, in the country. The singing of
  the birds, their twittering, chattering, calling; their excitement; their
  restful chirping, abandon of joy, peace without alloy&mdash;they are friends
  of the soul. The atmosphere too&mdash;the gentleness of it, the life within
  it and soft warmth of it: freedom, imagination, inspiration are in the air;
  the wind bloweth whereit listeth. Joy, innocent, white, pure, and happy.
  Happiness too. Life steeped in the sunshine of happiness. The spring, the
  elasticity, the eutrophy of life: life-creating life; life-giving life.
  Happiness on every hand mystic, elusive as the forces of Nature. "The wind
  bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but cannot tell
  whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth." Happiness! Not freedom from care, or
  from sorrow, or from sleepless anguish; not freedom from abasement, not even
  from dark gloom&mdash;the accidie of depression&mdash;yet nevertheless the
  increasing sense of the life of love and service, the power of service, the
  completeness of it. The happiness which breaks ever and again through the
  clouds of uncertainties, doubts, darknesses of life-revealing it may be, for
  a moment, the signs of long years of effort-for as life goes on it is given
  to catch glimpses of the growth of the soul, something of the part the soul
  has taken in the building of the kingdom. It is in this life of love and
  service the words of the Master come to us: "I will not leave you desolate, I
  will come unto you."'</p>

  <p>Followed praise of the beauty of work with which his congregation must
  have been familiar. And then came this concluding passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'And when these days of wrath are passed away, there will be a great
  battlefield for a new birth. Days of wrath and then a new revelation. When
  God came down on the first Pentecost on Mount Sinai, He came amid thunders
  and lightnings, and in a thick dark cloud-and when the Holy Spirit of God
  came to the waiting disciples there was a sound of a rushing mighty wind. And
  it must be so. New birth comes through much sorrow. So we may hope that new
  theories of life which for a century have been growing towards birth will
  spring forth out of this great contest in all the lands of the earth. Vast
  work there will be, and the labourers sadly fewer. The nation is now sending
  of her very best into the battlefield. There will be great call for new
  recruits to restore the countries which are devastated&mdash;great calls,
  too, for investigators in all branches of knowledge. Pioneers are now leading
  the way in research, in mathematics, in science, in industry, in the laws of
  logic and thought, with new ways of expression in language and art.</p>

  <p>'There is the great pressing need of revolution in the laws and
  relationships in the social life. We may have visions of a regenerated social
  state, in which courtesy, justice, mercy, the spirit of the gentle knight,
  will show themselves in change of thought, of belief; we may have visions of
  communities guided by principles which we hope and believe rule in our great
  school. Care for the weak; clothing, feeding, housing, medical care for all;
  a crime to be poor; to be diseased, to be underfed; these regenerations
  controlled by the true and public spirit at the cost of the community. Laws
  for reform and redemption, and not for punishment. Each member of the state
  cared for, as it is our hope each boy of this school is. Great
  changes-essential to the well-being of a state, and to each member of it. We
  may have visions that the spirit of chivalry, of kindness, of courtesy, of
  gentleness, of all that goes to make the "gentle soul" will bring this
  redemption to the people.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The war turned Sanderson from a successful schoolmaster into
  an amateur statesman. Life had become intolerable for him unless he could
  interpret all its present disorders as the wreckage and confusion of the
  house-breakers preparing the site for a far nobler and better building. He
  shows himself at times by no means certain that this would ever prove to be
  the case, but he had the brave man's assurance that with luck and courage
  there was nothing impossible in the hope that a more splendid human order
  might be built at last upon this troubled and distressful planet. But for
  that to happen every possible soul must be stirred, no latent will for order
  but must be roused and brought into active service. He had no belief in
  hopeless and irremediable vulgarity. People are mean, base, narrow,
  implacable, unforgiving, contentious, selfish, competitive, because they have
  still to see the creative light. Let that but shine upon them and seize them
  and they would come into their places in that creative treatment of life
  which ennobles the servant and enriches the giver, which is the true
  salvation of souls.</p>

  <p>He became a propagandist. He felt he had now made good sufficiently in his
  school. He had established a claim as an able and successful man to go out to
  able men, to business men, to influential men of all sorts, and tell them the
  significance of this school of his, this hand-specimen, this assay sample, of
  what could be done with the world. He went to Chambers of Commerce, to Rotary
  Clubs, to Civic Assemblies, to Luncheon gatherings of business men, to tell
  them of this idea of organisation for service, instead of for profit and
  possession. He tried to find industrial magnates who would take up the
  methods of Oundle in productive organisation. He corresponded extensively
  with such men as, for example, Lord Weir and Sir Alfred Yarrow and Lord
  Bledisloe. He wanted to see them doing for industrial and agricultural
  production what he had done for education, reconstructing it upon a basis of
  corporate service, aiming primarily at creative achievement, setting aside
  altogether competitive success or the amassing of private wealth as the ends
  of human activity. Surely they would see how much finer this new objective
  was, how much fuller and richer it must make their own lives!</p>

  <p>When I tell of this search for a kindred spirit among iron masters and
  great landlords and the like I am reminded of Confucius and his search for a
  duke in China, or of Plato or Machiavelli looking for a prince. There is the
  same belief in the power of a leader and the need of a personal will; the
  same utter scepticism in any automatic or crowd achievement of good order;
  once again the schoolmaster sets out to conquer the world. Perhaps some day
  that perennial attempt will come to fruition, and the schoolmaster will then
  indeed conquer the world. Perhaps the seeds that Sanderson has sown will
  presently be germinating in a crop of masterful business men of a new
  creative type. Perhaps there are Sandersons yet to come, men of energy; each
  with his individual difference, but all alight with the new conception of
  man's creative life. Perhaps Oundle may, after all, prove to be the egg of a
  new world. Oundle may relapse, probably will relapse, but other, more
  enduring Oundles may follow in other parts of the world. At present all that
  I can tell is of the message Sanderson was preaching during the last six
  years of his life.</p>

  <p>Here he is, talking to the textile manufacturers of Bradford. This that
  follows is from his printed address, restrained and pruned, but for the
  manner of his delivery, the reader should think rather of that sample sermon
  and the other descriptions I have given of his personal quality.</p>

  <p>'I am very much honoured by your invitation to address this important
  congress, and I am honoured, too, in being permitted to speak on education in
  this great city of Bradford. For your city stands out very prominently in the
  annals of education, and its work is well known by all who have watched
  educational progress.</p>

  <p>'You, gentlemen, are concerned with education: you are much concerned with
  the education which will promote the welfare of the leaders and workers in
  your industry; and the welfare of the people in your districts. Industrialism
  has tumbled upon us, and it is an untamed, unruly being, the laws of which
  are not yet known, and need study. For some thirty-five years-a long spell-I
  have, in places removed far away from the voices of industry, devoted my time
  towards the introduction into Public Schools of those Scientific and
  Technical studies which, as I understand it, lie at the basis of industrial
  life. I have always had before me the work of organising Technical Subjects
  so that they might give all that is best to give of spiritual and
  intellectual training. And our object is to send forth from school boys that
  will be in sympathy with the work that they have to do, that they will be
  privileged to do, and to send them forth equipped for it. You have the same
  purpose. Your wish is that the boys and girls of your country should have
  every chance of developing into effective workers in the community, and that
  they should take a zealous intellectual interest in their work&mdash;that
  they should love their work, love to do it well, ever anxious to mount to
  higher things.</p>

  <p>'And one of the difficulties of the immediate future will be to reorganise
  industrial conditions so that each worker may have the chance of stretching
  his faculties and of getting the work that will give him reasonably full play
  for his abilities. The fact that able and clever men are, in the present
  system, kept too long at work which does not stretch their brains, is a cause
  of unrest. Fortunately there is a growing consensus of opinion that more
  freedom for opportunity and for advancement is seriously necessary, and this
  sympathetic opinion will lead towards a solution. It is also well within the
  work of a school to promote this sympathy by sending out boys with those
  intellectual and scientific tastes and knowledge which will react upon
  themselves and attract them to the workers.</p>

  <p>'There are two other questions which I will mention before I come to the
  actual work which may be done in schools. One of the main aims of a good
  school is to see that each boy and girl is cared for, that each one has every
  opportunity for development. We must not cast out, or send our weak ones
  away, we must keep them in school&mdash;we must find out what kind of work
  will appeal to them, so that they, too, may move upwards, gain in
  self-respect, and love their life. And we claim that this is what we would
  have done in all factories, or in any occupation. It is the essential duty of
  every nation. We are anxious that no worker should be stunted mentally or
  physically by the kind of work he has to do. This again is a difficult as it
  is an urgent problem. It is one which can be studied in schools, and there is
  no doubt that the attempts of a school to provide avenues of advance for all
  kinds of boys will tend to bring the right spirit into industrial and
  agricultural life...'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">So much for the Bradford discourse. Here is the gist of a
  discourse given to the Reconstruction Council in London a year later..</p>

  <p>'The object of this paper is to describe in practical working terms an
  organisation of schools which shall be based on a close association with the
  manifold needs and labours of the community life. At the outset I may say
  that the proposals will refer&mdash;even if not specifically so
  stated&mdash;to all types of schools, from the elementary to the Public
  Schools. It will be seen that the change needs a change in the ideals which
  have usually prevailed in schools of the past. In the community life the one
  urgent thing to be done to-day is to reorganise industry and the conditions
  of labour. This reorganisation may require quite organic or even anarchic
  changes&mdash;and for these changes the ideals of boys and girls must be
  changed, and to prepare for this change is the urgent work of the
  schools.</p>

  <p>'Before I come to the proposals for reconstruction of schools, I will
  state very briefly some facts in industry which are now meeting with
  acceptance:</p>

  <p>'1. Modern industrial life has come in with a tumultuous rush, in a
  haphazard, ungoverned way, through the activities of forceful, capable, and
  industrious leaders who have made use of the scientific discoveries of
  another type of men.</p>

  <p>'2. The shrinkage of the world, and the growth of population which
  followed, has led to fierce competition; and this spirit of competition has
  ruled everywhere.</p>

  <p>'3. In the ungoverned rush for production all sorts of methods are adopted
  which seem to be justified by their effectiveness. An example is the modern
  system of efficiency, at first sight captivating to the intellect and the
  desires, but yet a method which needs very careful study.</p>

  <p>'4. Now men are beginning to believe that the first product of industry
  must be for the worker; that the worker should grow physically,
  intellectually, spiritually by his work.</p>

  <p>'I shall claim that the work in schools should be permeated by Science and
  by the scientific method and outlook, and it will be found that Science
  itself does not set all this store on efficiency. Efficiency, I believe, is
  entirely contained within the first, or quantitative law of Thermo-dynamics.
  But eutrophy based on the more elusive qualitative law is concerned with the
  quality which leads to the giving up of life to others. We must see to it
  that whatever the efficiency may be, the eutrophy of industry be high.</p>

  <p>'The principle that the first product of industry must be the worker leads
  to great organic changes. It will lead to no less a thing than closing down
  certain productions, certain classes of occupations, certain industries or
  processes. It will lead to a modification in repetition work; and to
  adjustmets in organisation. I hope to show the bearing of this on our
  educational methods, and how the ideals implied may bring some help in
  diagnosing Labour unrest.</p>

  <p>'It will be seen that most of the changes needed to-day depend upon
  international agreements; and a league of nations is essential, not, I think,
  to end wars, but to make the change from competition to co-operation
  possible.</p>

  <p>'We are concerned to-day with the part education must take in this change
  of ideals of life. It is not too much to say that without the influence of a
  reconstructed education the way to change in the ideals of men will be hard
  to find. The change has to be made from competitive methods and ideals to
  co-operative methods; from the spirit of dominance to creativeness; and the
  present system of aristocraticism in schools must give way to
  democratisation.</p>

  <p>'Competition holds sway to-day in industrial life with disastrous results.
  Every employer of labour feels this, and wrestles, and would be glad of a
  change, but he is held in the grip of a system. Every one feels that
  competition destroys the creative, inventive life&mdash;and is the seat of
  unrest. And yet the spirit of competition holds sway, not in commerce only
  nor in diplomacy, but in the schools. Our public schools are professedly
  schools for training a dominant class; the aims, the educational methods, the
  school subjects and their relative values, the books read, the life
  led&mdash;are all based on this spirit. The methods are largely competitive,
  possessive. With, as I believe, tragic results in industrial life this same
  system, with the ideals behind it, has been unwittingly impressed on the
  working class in the elementary schools...</p>

  <p>'The change which I am advocating will demand a new organisation, and will
  call for a new type of school buildings, and new values of subjects. The
  new-comer Science, and with it organised industry, which springs out of it,
  must take a prominent and inspiriting place in school, and in every part of
  school work. It is not sufficient to say that Science should be taught in
  schools. The time has gone by for this. We claim that scientific thought
  should be the inspiring spirit in school life. Science is essentially
  creative and co-operative, its outlook is onwards towards change, it means
  searching for the truth, it demands research and experiment, and does not
  rest on authority. Under this new spirit all history, literature, art, and
  even languages should be rewritten.</p>

  <p>'A new type of school buildings and requirements will arise. No longer
  buildings comprised only of class-rooms, but large and spacious workrooms.
  Class-rooms are places where boys go to be taught. They are tool-sharpening
  rooms&mdash;necessary, but subsidiary. For research and cooperative creative
  work the larger halls are needed. Spacious engineering and wood-working
  shops, well supplied with all kinds of machine tools, a smithy, a foundry, a
  carpenter's shop, a drawing office&mdash;all carried on for manufacturing
  purposes. Plenty of work which will employ boys of all ages will be found to
  do.</p>

  <p>'There will be a corresponding spacious literary and historical workshop
  with a really spacious library full of books: books on modern subjects, as
  well as reference books. The building should have wings in it for foreign
  books&mdash;modern as well as classic, history, economics, literary,
  scientific. As many as possible of the foreign languages should be
  represented here, that boys may grow up with knowledge and sympathy and
  respect for other nations, and thus aid in promoting wider and deeper ideals
  of life. Another gallery for geography, and natural history, travels,
  ethnology.</p>

  <p>'Here is full scope for a large number of boys of all ages to be engaged
  in research. It is all of a co-operative character. They can study the
  various social and economic systems&mdash;from co-partnership to syndicalism;
  or the Liberation of Slaves; or the League of Nations; or the Liberation of
  Italy.</p>

  <p>'Another block will be a science block with an engineering laboratory,
  machinery hall, physical, chemical, and biological laboratories&mdash;well
  supplied with apparatus and plant for applied science; plant, too, to lead to
  the investigations of the day; testing machine, ship tank, air tunnel; a
  miniature standardising laboratory; and with this a botanical garden and an
  experimental farm.</p>

  <p>'Another would be an art-room, music-room, theatre, a home of industry for
  studying industrial development and industrial life.</p>

  <p>'This is not a Utopian scheme, but one within possibility in town and
  country. To each large central high school should be associated groups of
  elementary schools, and there should be free highways between them, neither
  barred by examinations nor barred by expense...</p>

  <p>'Another change must also come. Books on modern problems, strangely
  enough, are not yet read in schools. For example, the time is overdue for a
  change in the English books: Burke's _Reflections_ and Pitt's _War Speeches,_
  or Addison, to Ruskin's _Unto This Last_ and _Time and Tide,_ or to Bernard
  Shaw, Wells, Galsworthy, and the modern poets. Some would go so far as to
  give Shakespeare a rest. It is astonishing how the newer books bearing on the
  large questions of the day, and bearing on the actual life of the boy, strike
  the imagination of boys&mdash;even quite young boys of the upper elementary
  school age. They stir up the faculties and appeal to a less used kind of
  imagination. It is surprising, too, what open and live views young boys will
  reach.</p>

  <p>And one thing the study of these books possesses, which I hope to dwell
  upon later, is that they bring the schools into close touch with the everyday
  life of their homes and of the community.</p>

  <p>'Creative education demands that schools should be brought into harmony
  with the community life, and should take part in the industrial and economic
  life. When boys and girls go home from school (even to the humblest home) the
  parents should find there is something their children have done at school
  which will help them in their work. This means that technical and vocational
  training should hold a prominent, and not a subsidiary, place in the schools.
  It is not difficult to see that this kind of work contains within it the
  spirit and genius of Science. We claim that education should be turned in
  this direction, with confidence and inspiration. The divorce of industrial
  life from the life of the spirit is one of the tragedies of the age. It
  produces calamitous results. A man's work may be of an impossible kind, it
  may be sordid and destructive of life&mdash;and the cure proposed is that he
  should have shorter hours and more pay. This leads to bad diagnosis of the
  cause of the Labour difficulty, and prevents necessary reforms in the
  industries...</p>

  <p>'Creativeness, the co-operative spirit and method, the vision, the
  experimental method of searching for the truth, form the unique gift Science
  and Industry have to give to the "New Education." Under the influence of this
  new outlook all other departments of knowledge must be restudied. Under its
  influence the life of school will become active, the workers self reliant,
  love abounding. It will make good craftsmen and make the school of use in the
  community&mdash;whether in the manufacturing life or in the investigation of
  economic conditions. Incidentally it will give rise to a new body of men
  capable of going wholly or in part to teaching, and the school will be thus
  linked up with the life of the place.</p>

  <p>'It may be well to state that with an education of this kind based
  fundamentally on Science a capable boy will leave a secondary school with a
  good knowledge of Science and of its application, with a research attitude
  towards history and modern problems, and with a good working knowledge of
  two, or three, or even four languages...</p>

  <p>'The study of social questions is seriously needed. Industries would then
  have a close connection with the boys and girls, and yet boys and girls would
  be free to follow the best of their own talents and inclinations&mdash;the
  industrial life would not be separated from the spiritual life and we may
  hope that some part of this ideal would pass over into the workshops and
  factories; so that the labourer would learn to love his work better than his
  wage&mdash;for so indeed he would wish to do. And the faculties of the worker
  would grow. The method of the work would follow the method of the school, as
  it is doing more and more in our own land and in many a workshop. For the
  spirit is with these ideals; the practice difficult for any single firm to
  carry out. Hence is the need for radical change in schools. Firms are being
  driven to start trade schools of their own, when they would prefer the work
  to be done with all the wider scope of a school. And the same enlightened
  firms endeavour to "promote" their men.</p>

  <p>'And here we come to what is probably the natural source of all labour
  "unrest"&mdash;the unstretched faculties of the worker. Men there are in any
  great shops who have intellectual faculties of the highest order, and these
  faculties are not used, so the greatest possession a man has, and the
  greatest his country has&mdash;the "faculties" of its owners&mdash;is allowed
  to dissipate. And in the feeling of the mental want of equilibrium, in the
  slow frittering away of life, there arrives the turbulent spirit. The study
  of these questions is the problem for our coming international university.
  The industrial and economic problems involved can only be approached under
  international agreement. All that has been possible at present in the way of
  making industrial life pure and holy is by legislative restrictions, often
  enough rankling to the worker even when needed for his amelioration. Such
  legislation (Factory Acts, Insurance Acts, wages, hours) does not remove the
  source of the disease; at best it only mitigates the worst results. More
  drastic changes may be needed in the nature of the work-to the ruling out
  certain manufacturing processes until new discoveries can be made.</p>

  <p>'So with the work in the shops. Men do not want wages, or shorter hours;
  these demands are only symptoms of a disease; short cuts to amelioration.
  They are doctoring. What men want is that their work may be such that they
  can love it, and want more of it. They do not want slaves' work in the shops
  and a "dose" of the spiritual life out of it. So we believe.</p>

  <p>'Parents, too, would let their children remain at school. As a class there
  is no one more unselfish and self-sacrificing and co-operative than the
  working-class parent. Boys want to leave school because of the natural urge
  for making something and getting to business-as they see it at home. To
  remain at school without joining in some work is unthinkable when they see
  the life their parents lead.</p>

  <p>'I may be permitted to insert one paragraph on the unfortunate opposition
  to this new position which is claimed for Science in the schools. The
  opposition springs from the belief that vocational work is simply material,
  having no spiritual outlook. But the truth is all the other way.
  Unfortunately the present studies of history, art, economy, literature, are
  biassed by "possessive" instincts and education, and we claim that Science
  and its methods are seriously demanded for a new reading of these things.
  However, the opposition finds expression in high quarters. The Workers'
  Educational Union, acting in sympathy with the Labour view&mdash;that
  vocational studies are to be avoided&mdash;practically taboos technical
  studies. This is reasonable as things are to-day, when a man's work is too
  often for the profit of others, and for this reason the workers are not in
  love with their work, and when the day is over they have seen plenty of it;
  so the best of them go elsewhere for the springs of the spiritual life. But
  this is all disastrous to individuals and disastrous to progress. What the
  workers should do is to watch for the spirit in their daily work, for it is
  the work itself which will hold a man to God&mdash;nothing else
  will.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">I have quoted from this London Reconstruction discourse very
  fully. In the official Life there are a number of such addresses in which the
  student will find the main doctrines of that particular address repeated,
  varied, amplified, but as my object in this book is to strip Sanderson's
  views down to his essential ideas, I will make only one further quotation
  from this propaganda material here. This is from the notes he arranged for an
  address to the Newcastle Rotary Club. His favourite contrast between the
  possessive instincts and the creative instincts comes out very clearly here.
  Like all the great religious teachers, Sanderson aims quite clearly at an
  ultimate communism, to be achieved not by revolution but by the steady
  development of a creative spirit in the world.</p>

  <p>'Schools should be miniature copies of the world we should love to have.
  Hence our outlooks and methods must have these aims in mind. Schoolmasters
  have great responsibilities. We should be able to say to a boy, we have
  endeavoured to do such things for you, and we ask you to go forth, it may be,
  into your father's business or factory and do the same to the workers. Let me
  illustrate from the workshops. Workshops in a school are by far the most
  difficult things to carry on along the lines I have in mind. Here are three
  conditions which must be kept in the shops:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'(a) The work boys are doing should not be for themselves, or exercises to
  learn by; it must always be work required by the community.</p>

  <p>'(b) Each boy must have the opportunity of doing all the main operations,
  and all the operations should be going on in the workshops.</p>

  <p>'(c) Whenever a boy goes into the shop he should find himself set to work
  which is up to the hilt of his capacity. There is no "slithering" down to
  work which is easy, no unnecessary and automatic repetition, no working for
  himself but 'for the community.</p>

  <p>'And we can say, and are entitled to say, to the boy, when you go forth
  into life, perhaps into your father's work or business or profession, you
  must try to do for your apprentices and workers what we have tried to do for
  you. You, too, will try to see that everyone has work which exacts their
  faculties&mdash;by which they will grow and develop; you will see to it that
  they are working directly on behalf of and for the welfare of the community,
  and not for yourself.</p>

  <p>'This is your real duty towards your neighbour. It is a vastly hard thing
  to do. This duty of believing that others are of the same blood with
  yourself, and have the same feelings, and loves, and desires and needs, and
  natural elementary rights; this duty of setting them free to exercise their
  faculties spaciously that they, too, may get more of life-is the real duty
  towards your neighbour. It is a hard thing. If you think of the works, the
  factory, the office, it is a hard thing. It involves vast sacrifice-the
  hardest sacrifice&mdash;the sacrifice of belief and economic tradition. We
  need not be surprised that Christianity has "slithered down" to an easier and
  softer level of culture and duty towards our neighbours. But whether the
  workers know it or not, this hard duty is essential in considering the
  relationships of our community system and our international system
  to-day.</p>

  <p>'It is a hard duty, and boys must be immersed in it in school. The
  outlook, values, and organisation of a school should be based on the
  fundamental fact of the community service. By habit of mind, and by the
  activity of the schools, boys should be imbued with this high duty. It means
  a reorganisation of methods and aims.</p>

  <p>'It is a hard duty, this duty towards your neighbour&mdash;the hardest
  part being to believe that he has like feelings with yourself and equal
  rights. The young man went away sorrowful, for he had great
  riches&mdash;riches intellectual or other. Yet the young man went away
  sorrowful, and there is no doubt that he eventually sold all that he had.
  This is Watts' version of it. The young man was at heart a follower of Jesus;
  he did not say that the commandment was an old one and well known, that it
  had been said before in the Hagadah and by Moses; he did not say that the
  language was the language of Plato or Philo; he did not say that it was too
  difficult and could not be true for everyone&mdash;he went away sorrowful. We
  have no doubt that he sold all that he had.</p>

  <p>'The system of education in the past has been based on training for
  leadership, i.e. for a master class, and its method has been a training of
  the faculties. But the sharply defined line between the leaders and the led
  has been broken down. The whole mass of people has been aroused towards
  intellectual creative efforts. The struggle going on in all communities and
  amongst all races is a struggle to grow and have more of life.. Whether at
  home amongst our workers, or in India, or Egypt, or Ireland; or between China
  and Europe&mdash;the struggle is the same. It is a struggle to make progress,
  and have more of life. This urge to grow is a biological fact. We cannot tell
  why it is or what creates it&mdash;but everything around us has this urge to
  grow, and to grow in its own particular way. One seed grows into a tulip,
  another into wheat. We know not how, but we recognise it. And it is precisely
  the same urge to grow that is causing all this apparent conflict. It is the
  fundamental creative instinct&mdash;the most powerful instinct of the human
  race, by which the race is preserved. Deep down in human nature lies this
  instinct; it is never forgotten, it is always present in the mind. It is
  voluptuous, anarchic, joyful, violent, powerful.</p>

  <p>'The other instinct is called the fighting, aggressive, acquisitive,
  possessive instinct. It is the instinct to acquire, to overcome. It is
  distinct from the creative instinct even in the biological growth, but the
  distinction manifests itself more clearly in the community or herd
  relationships. It has none of the beautiful and life-giving qualities of the
  creative urge. It is essentially, even in its romance (of which we have
  plenty), dull, selfish, destructive. It varies its forms from sheer animal
  force to the dialectical methods which have assumed the names of talent and
  culture. The same characteristics are seen in the force of the slave-driver,
  in the forces of the wage-nexus, and in the dialectical force of the council.
  These are hard sayings, but for the solution of the problems of the present
  times it is wise, and necessary, to look facts in the face. At any rate it is
  well to know of the possibilities, feelings, and loves of the uprising
  mass...</p>

  <p>'But what has this to do with schools? My answer is that if we are to deal
  with the problems thrown up by science in our industrial system, and our
  close national and international contacts, the schools must be the seed
  grounds of the new thought and visions...'</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF VISION AND THE SCHOOL CHAPEL</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I come now to one of the most curious and characteristic
  things in Sanderson's later life, a conflict and interaction that went on
  between two closely related and yet in many ways intensely competitive ideas,
  the idea on the one hand of a new sort of building unprecedented among
  schools, a building which should symbolise and embody the whole aim of the
  school and the renewed community of which it is the germ, and on the other
  hand the idea of a great memorial chapel to commemorate the sacrifice of
  those who had fallen in the war. These ideas assumed protean forms in his
  mind, they grew, they blended and separated again. I will call the first, for
  reasons that will appear later, the House of Vision; the second, the school
  chapel. For though Oundle had thrown up a great cluster of houses, halls,
  laboratories, and other buildings during its quarter of a century of growth,
  it had never yet produced anything more than a corrugated-iron meeting-house
  for its religious services. The want of some more dignified chapel had long
  been evident, and even before the war was very much in Sanderson's mind.</p>

  <p>The idea of a House of Vision was therefore the later of the two. Very
  early in the war a boy of great promise, Eric Yarrow, the son of Sir Alfred
  Yarrow, the great shipbuilder, was killed at Ypres, and parent and
  schoolmaster met at the house of the former to mourn their common loss.
  Sanderson and Eric Yarrow had been close friends; they had discussed and
  developed the idea of a creative reconstruction of industry together; Eric
  Yarrow was to have played a part in the industrial world similar to the part
  that Roy Sanderson was to have played in the educational world.</p>

  <p>The two men sat late at night and talked of these vanished hopes. Could
  not something be done, they asked, to record at least the spirit of these
  fine intentions, and they sketched out a project for a memorial building that
  should be a symbol and incitement to effort for the reorganised industrial
  state. It should be in a sense a museum containing a record of human effort
  and invention in the past; a museum of the development of work and production
  and a statement of the economic problems before mankind. Sir Alfred produced
  a cheque more than sufficient to cover the building of such a memorial as
  they had planned, and Sanderson returned to Oundle to put the realisation of
  the project in hand. Probably the two of them also discussed the need for a
  memorial chapel and probably neither of them realised a possible clash
  between that older project and the new one they were now starting.</p>

  <p>It was in the early stage when the Eric Yarrow memorial was to be nothing
  more than a museum of industrial history and organisation that Sanderson set
  afoot the building at Oundle which is now known by that name. Apparently he
  did not get much inspiration over to the architect, and at any rate the
  edifice that presently rose was a very weak and dull-looking one, more
  suitable for a herbarium or a minor lecture-hall than for a temple of
  creative dreams. It was a premature materialisation, done in the stress and
  under the cramping limitations of war time. Long before it was finished
  Sanderson's imaginations had outgrown it. I think this unconfessed
  architectural disappointment probably played a large part in the subsequent
  development of the idea of the school chapel, still to be planned, still
  capable of being made a spacious and beautiful building. To the latter dream
  he transferred more and more of the ideas that arose properly out of the germ
  of the Eric Yarrow memorial.</p>

  <p>At first the House of Vision was to have been no more than an industrial
  museum. It was not to be used as a class-room or lecture-room. It was to be
  empty of chairs, desks, and the like, and clear for anyone to go in to think
  and dream. About its walls, diagrams and charts were to display the progress
  of man from the sub-human to his present phase of futile power and hope.
  There were to be time-charts of the whole process of history, and a few of
  these have been made. As his idea ripened it broadened. The memorial ceased
  to be a symbol merely of industrial reorganisation and progress, and became a
  temple to the whole human adventure. He began to stress first social and then
  imaginative growth. The charts were to be full and accurate, everything shown
  was to be precisely true, but there was to be no teaching in the building, no
  direction beyond the form and spirit of the place.</p>

  <p>And so while the scaffolds of the workmen rose about the commonplace
  little erection in the school fields, the schoolmaster in his day-dreams
  realised more and more the full measure of the opportunity he was
  missing.</p>

  <p>The realisation of the past is the realisation of the future, and it was
  an easy transition to pass to the idea of this building as an expression of
  tile creative will in man. In it the individual boy was to realise the aim of
  the school and of schooling and living. It was to be the eye of the school,
  its soul, its headlight.</p>

  <p>The idea of this 'House of Vision' was still growing in his mind when he
  died. He had not yet settled upon a name for it, though he had tried over a
  number of names&mdash;a House of Vision, which is the name we have taken for
  it here, the Home of Silence, the Hall of Industry, the Anthropaeum, the
  Making of Man, the Life Creative, the Soul of the School. All these names
  converge upon the end he was seeking. This approach by trial, by leaving the
  idea to shape itself for a time and then taking it up again, by talking it
  over with this man and that, was very characteristic of his mental
  processes.</p>

  <p>A member of the staff recalls a stage in the development of the idea. 'I
  talked with the headmaster about the Yarrow Memorial in October 1920,' he
  says. 'He then seemed to dally with a suggestion to name it the "Temple of
  the World"&mdash;he expressed his hatred of the tendency to call it the
  "Museum." I gathered that his idea was to fill it with charts of all things
  and all ages, including pictures of at least all the world's great
  men&mdash;then to turn a boy loose in it, thereby to realise his position in
  the world as a unit of its time, as opposed to the inculcation of any idea of
  his having a part in his nationality only. His root idea seemed to be that it
  should be a place for meditation&mdash;restful as well as invigorating.'</p>

  <p>Here is a passage written by Sanderson himself a little later. The idea
  ripens and broadens out very manifestly.</p>

  <p>'Every school, every locality and industry,' he writes, 'might build
  within their boundaries a new kind of chapel, a heritage, a temple-a
  beautiful building in which are gathered together and exhibited the records
  of man's great deeds and of man's progress, and the records of his needs. It
  is such a "Hall of Needs" that we regard the Yarrow Memorial, and to this end
  it is being equipped.'</p>

  <p>And here Sanderson speaks again in a sermon preached upon the text of
  Moses' withdrawal to the mount.</p>

  <p>'A school will grow into a book. It will take upon itself the form of a
  Bible. Within it will appear the stages in the life of the soul&mdash;"the
  coming of a kingdom"; the foundations, the building, the furniture, the
  complex apparatus, the organised beauty. A school&mdash;its buildings,
  workshops, class-rooms, and all that goes towards a great school&mdash;can
  take on the form of a parable. As we wander from one place to another all
  that speaks of life will manifest itself before us. How life begins, what is
  needed for its growth; what shall be its standards, its ideals; what the
  nature of its proof-plate; the craftsman and what he is; the craftsman in
  languages, in mathematics, in science, in art; the secrets of nature
  revealing themselves; progress, change, vision.</p>

  <p>'And boys will go out into the factory, or mine, or business, or
  profession, imbued with the spirit of the active love of humanity. Some will
  be called to lead, as Moses was called. They, too, will plant the "Tent of
  Meeting," the "Temple of Vision." A return with a new view-point will be made
  to the temple of ages gone by. The Assyrian frescoed his walls with
  sculptures of the deeds of his hero-kings; the Franciscans frescoed the walls
  of their chapels with the life of Jesus as told in the Gospels&mdash;the life
  of the Divine builder, of Him who came to restore a kingdom, by whose life
  and death a new world was created.</p>

  <p>'But the Temple of Vision of to-day; the new Tent of Meeting. What of it?
  The new home of vision will be frescoed with the thoughts of to-day, changing
  in to the thoughts of to-morrow. Generations of workers will go up into the
  mount, and to them, too, will be shown the pattern. "See that thou make them
  after their pattern which hath been shown thee in the mount."'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Now this is a very great and novel idea, the idea of a
  modern temple set like a miner's lantern in the forefront of school or
  college to light its task in the world. It rounds off and completes
  Sanderson's vision of a modern school; it is logically essential to that
  vision. But meanwhile what was happening to the school-chapel project?</p>

  <p>For, after all, in the older type of school, the chapel with its matins
  and evensong, its _Onward Christian Soldiers_ and suchlike stirring hymns,
  its confirmations and first communions, was in a rather dreamy, formless
  mechanical way undertaking to do precisely what the new House of Vision was
  also to do, that is, to give a direction to the whole subsequent life. But
  was it the same direction? The normal school-chapel points up&mdash;not very
  effectively one feels; the House of Vision was to point onward. Sanderson had
  a crowded, capacious mind, but sooner or later the question behind these two
  discrepant objectives, whether men are to live for heaven or for creation,
  was bound to have come to an issue.</p>

  <p>His mental process was at first syncretic. He began to think of a
  school-chapel, not as a place for formal services but as a place of
  meditation and resolve. He began to speak of the chapel also as though it was
  to be 'the tent on the mount,' the place of vision. He betrayed a growing
  hostility to the intoned prayers, the trite responses, the tuneful empty
  hymns, the Anglican vacuity of the normal chapel procedure. Had he lived to
  guide the building of Oundle chapel I believe it would have diverged more and
  more from any precedent, more and more in the direction of that House of
  Vision, that the premature and insufficient Eric Yarrow building had so
  pitifully failed to realise.</p>

  <p>Here is evidence of that divergence in a passage from a sermon preached
  after a gathering of parents and old boys in the Court Room at the London
  Grocers' Hall to discuss the chapel project. I ask anyone trained in the
  services of the Church of England and accustomed to enter, pray into a silk
  hat, deposit it under the seat, sit down, stand up, bow, genuflect, kneel
  decorously on a hassock, sing, repeat responses, and go through the simple
  and wholesome Swedish exercises of the Anglican prayer book, what is to be
  thought of this project of a chapel with hardly a sitting in it? And what is
  to be thought of this suggestion of wandering round the aisles? And what is
  this talk of young gentlemen who have died 'for king and country,' casting
  down their lives for the rescue of man?</p>

  <p>'For the years to come, when the war is over, it will be well to have some
  visible memorial; some symbol of the redemption of the Great War, and of the
  heroic part old boys have taken in it; some record of the great struggle from
  out of which the new spirit will rise; some record of the part the whole
  school took in this; some record of the boys who have fallen; some
  thanksgiving symbol for all who have given their service. And for this it is
  proposed to build a chapel. But when the time comes we shall be sad to leave
  our present building. It is a poor building, but it is very rich in its
  associations. The services in this temporary chapel have taken a large part
  in the building of the school. Simple as is the Tent in the Wilderness, yet
  we have hoped that the Spirit of God would come and dwell in it. We have
  hoped that the Divine Spirit would come into all the activities and outlook
  of the school in its diverse occupations, whether they be literary or whether
  they be scientific or technical. And we have always looked onward to the day
  when a permanent chapel should be built, symbolic of the Divine Omnipresence
  for worship and for sacrifice.</p>

  <p>'And this is what is in mind to do&mdash;and yet I confess to a certain
  amount of fear. A lofty, spacious chapel I have had no doubt would at the
  right moment be built by the Grocers' Company. Just before the war the
  building of this chapel was emerging as the next great building to
  undertake&mdash;a chapel, such as a college chapel with stalls, as for
  private service. But now we look beyond this. We want something different,
  more open. A lofty, spacious chapel to form the nave&mdash;no fixed seats,
  the clear open space; quiet, still, "urgent with beauty." Joined to this the
  choir and sanctuary, with aisles round the three sides of it, forming an
  ambulatory. Round these aisles, on the walls and in the windows, the recorded
  memory of the boys who have fallen. An east window, a reredos, stalls, altar.
  A chapel, abundant in space, not for the mind to sit down in, but for the
  mind to move about in, for contemplation, for dwelling in the infinite, for
  piercing through the night, for vision, for the clear spirit of thankfulness,
  for communion with the saints, our own young saints among them. So we hope.
  As you wander round the aisles there will pass before you the memorial of
  those boys who have cast down their lives for the rescue of man.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">I cannot guess how Sanderson, had he lived, would have
  resolved this conflict between his House of Vision and his Great Chapel, just
  as I can hazard no opinion of the ultimate form his interpretation of
  Christianity would have taken. But the recognition of these conflicts is
  fundamental to my conception of the man and his significance.</p>

  <p>He stands for a great multitude reluctant to abandon many of the familiar
  phrases of the Christian use and eager to read new and deeper meanings into
  them. But he never took 'holy orders'; he knew the days of the priest, except
  for evil, were past, and it is only by its being born again as a House of
  Vision that he could anticipate his chapel with contentment. The time has
  come for mankind to choose plainly between the priest and the teacher.</p>

  <p>Some six months after Sanderson's death I went to Oundle and visited the
  Yarrow Memorial, that abortive first House of Vision. Except for a bronze
  statue of a boy by Lady Scott that Sanderson had liked and bought, it was as
  I had seen it with Sanderson a year before. It was still, deserted, and I
  suppose I must count it dead. The time-charts had not been carried on. The
  collection of inventions, the display of humanity's growth, were still
  represented by empty cases. The statue was intended for the school chapel,
  but meanwhile it had been dumped in the House of Vision as a convenient
  vacant place for such dumping. The bronze boy is in an eager pose; there is
  duty to be done and danger to be faced and a great creative effort to be
  made. 'Send me!' he said, in that empty, neglected House of Vision. But the
  hand that would have put that dart to the bowstring and aimed it at work and
  service was there no more.</p>

  <p>Building operations upon the chapel were proceeding slow I y. The rising
  walls were very like the rising walls of the sort of church for respectable
  people that gets built in Surbiton or Beckenham. I gather that in all
  probability it will even carry the debt customary in such cases. The new
  headmaster was, I found, a thoroughly pleasant man who came not from an
  elementary school but from Eton, and had never met Sanderson in his life and
  knew nothing of his work. He seemed disposed to regard Sanderson as a bit of
  a crank and to be intelligently puzzled by his originalities. I felt assured
  that when at last that old corrugated-iron building is abandoned for the new
  chapel there would be pews in the new nave in spite of Sanderson, and
  services of an altogether normal type and no nonsense of walking about and
  thinking or anything of that sort.</p>

  <p>But though I have seen the House of Vision at Oundle dead and vacant as a
  museum skull, yet I know surely that neither Sanderson nor his House of
  Vision are in any real sense dead at all. A day will certainly come when his
  name will be honoured above all other contemporary schoolmasters as the
  precursor of a new age in education and human affairs. In that age of
  realisation every village will be dominated by its school, with its library
  and theatre, its laboratories and gymnasium, every town will converge upon
  its cluster of schools and colleges, its research buildings and the like, and
  it will have its Great Chapel, its House of Vision as its crown and symbol
  even as the cathedral was the crown and symbol of the being and devotion of
  the medieval city. And therein Sanderson's stout hopefulness and pioneer
  thrustings will be kept in remembrance by generations that have come up to
  the pitch of understanding him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE LAST LECTURE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Sanderson's propaganda of this idea of the possible
  reorganisation of the world through schools came to an abrupt end in the
  summer of 1922. He died suddenly of heart failure in the Botanical Theatre of
  University College, London, at the end of an address to the National Union of
  Scientific Workers. He had chosen as the title of the address, 'The Duty and
  Service of Science in the New Era,' and it was in effect a recapitulation of
  his most characteristic views. He attached considerable importance to the
  delivery and he made unusual preparations for it.</p>

  <p>Upon his desk after his death seven separate drafts, and they were all
  very full drafts, of this address were found. In the margins of the pages
  little sums have been worked out&mdash;so many pages at three hundred words a
  page, four thousand, five thousand words; a full hour's talking, and still so
  much to say! There are little notes framed in a sort of Oxford frame of lines
  reminding him, for example, to 'say more of bringing scientific method into
  all parts of school.' On the reverse of the pages of manuscript are trial
  restatements. He tried back several times to a fresh beginning. There is a
  page headed 'The New School,' and giving three headings: the first, which he
  afterwards marked as second, is, 'The faculty of each member shall be
  developed'; the second, which became the first, is 'Community service-no
  competition'; the third is, '_Outlook&mdash;aim_, more value than ability.
  Service. All are equal. The Spirit an the Bride say, Come. Let all that will,
  come.'</p>

  <p>Then we find him trying over his ideas about science under a heading,
  'What we claim for science.' Under that are a number of interesting
  subheads:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Its own value in the great discoveries.</p>

  <p>'That its spirit is that of life, giving, changing, searching. (Marginal
  note:&mdash;without being deterred by any of the results which may
  follow.)</p>

  <p>'It is "natural" to the vast number of boys.</p>

  <p>'Very directly applicable to needs.</p>

  <p>'That it has a language and a message.</p>

  <p>(Marginal note:&mdash;it seeks to test, to create new standards, to
  fearlessly rewrite knowledge.)</p>

  <p>'The same spirit. (? as Christianity: Editor.)</p>

  <p>Finally he produced a draft which was at least his eighth. This he had
  printed and this he may have intended to read to the meeting. But h did not
  do so. In the end he spoke from a fresh set of notes, which must have been at
  least the ninth draft. That eighth draft is given in full in the official
  Life.</p>

  <p>His health had not been good for some time, and he kept this lecture and
  his exceptional interest in it more or less secret from his wife. He spent a
  long and interested morning at the experimental farm at Rothamsted, and in
  the afternoon he went to the opticians to get a new pair of spectacles and
  attended to other small businesses. He met a small party of us at the London
  University Club in Gower Street to take tea before lecturing. Sir Richard
  Gregory, the editor of _Nature,_ was present, Major Church, the secretary of
  the National Union of Scientific Workers, and Dr. Charles Singer, the
  historian of classical science. Sanderson was evidently hot and rather tired,
  but he did not seem to be ill; he gossiped pleasantly with us and showed us
  his new spectacles. They were made of a recently discovered glass, opaque to
  ultra-violet rays and he betrayed the pride and interest of a boy in
  possessing them.</p>

  <p>University College was not very far away, but he asked for a cab thither
  because he felt fagged. The audience was already assembled and he went
  straight on to the platform. The present writer made a few introductory
  remarks, and the lecture began. It is a matter of keen regret to all of us
  that we allowed him to stand throughout his discourse. It would have been so
  easy to have arranged for him to talk from a chair; the Botanical Theatre is
  not a large one and it is quite conceivable that he might be alive now, if
  one of us could have had that much thoughtfulness for him. We had thought of
  it&mdash;ten minutes af ter his death.</p>

  <p>But we were all so used to the quality of effort in his voice, so
  accustomed to its sudden fall into almost inaudible asides, that we did not
  mark what hung over us until the very moment of catastrophe. His sentences
  seemed to me a little more broken than usual; he was rather more
  disconnected, he was leaving rather more than usual to the intelligence of
  his audience, and as he talked I watched the faces before me rather anxiously
  to see just how much they missed of what he was trying to get over to them.
  He got over much more than I supposed, for I have since talked with many who
  were present. A fairly full shorthand note was made at the trifle, and on
  this the following rendering of the last address is based. Like everything
  that has been printed of his here, it has been clipped and shorn, little
  distracting side glances have been eliminated and broken sentences filled in
  and rounded off.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">'It is a great honour,' he began, 'to come and address
  scientific workers (I have only recently discovered my claim to be a
  scientific worker), and to describe to you what has turned out to be a
  scientific experiment. I hope to show the results of an experiment carried
  on, not in a scientific laboratory so-called&mdash;physical, chemical,
  biological, or anthropological&mdash;but in a school for boys.</p>

  <p>'Before doing that, I should like to say that we scientific workers do
  very much depend on having a number of us together. One scientific worker
  placed in charge of any great work finds it difficult; scientific workers do
  not get the chance of appointing men in sympathy with themselves often
  enough; so it is frequently said that scientific men placed in command of a
  factory in industry or a department of state at home or in the colonies fail.
  Well, if so, they fail because scientific men have not often got the
  opportunity of getting men of like sympathy to work with them. I take it that
  the object of the National Union of Scientific Workers is to get scientific
  men with scientific views of life and experimental experience to join
  together in some great work. When I speak of the duty and service of science
  in the new era, I mean that I want scientific men to claim justly a larger
  share in the work of the world, and not to confine themselves to what is
  called purely scientific work. We want them to expand themselves over a wider
  area. As a matter of fact, that is what two distinguished writers have
  suggested: that the time has come when the ordinary discoveries and
  inventions of science should be closed down in order to enable scientific
  minds to do this simple thing. Practically everything that exists now is the
  work of scientific men, their discoveries and their inventions. The whole
  world teems with the results of the work of science. The great machines we
  see used in industry-the industrial machine itself-have been created by men
  of science. Now, I put it to you that when motor cars came in, the nobility
  of the land found their coachmen of little use. The scientific machine
  requires scientific men to manage it. Our industrial life is imperfectly
  organised; all our troubles are due to the fact that we have a process
  created by science, but organised in the old way by men of a different
  outlook. The discoveries of science have rushed into the world a considerable
  amount of unexpected ability. Working men engaged in industrial pursuits have
  had their intelligence discovered and brought out, and it is one thing to
  control a mass of human beings who are not thus inspired with the knowledge
  of their own possibilities, and another to control those who are. It is like
  trying to control a set of live molecules. It is one thing to control a hard
  atom and another to control a live electron.</p>

  <p>'So that the duty and service of science would seem to lie in scientific
  men bringing their ideal of life, their standards, their vision, their
  outlook, and their methods to organise the great machine that their
  inventions have created. You cannot have a world half scientific and the
  other half nothing of the sort.</p>

  <p>'That is to say, scientific workers will have to consider the whole
  question, for instance, of economics. I heard yesterday a distinguished
  member of the Government saying that we cannot change economics. Of course,
  that is one thing scientific men have got to do, to change economics so that
  the system of our industry shall be recreated. The system of management by
  dual control of the master and the slave will not work when the slave becomes
  an alive, active, intelligent, anarchic being. He will not be governed by the
  rein but by a system which the magnet can influence. However, the last
  hundred years has resulted in a race between the changed conditions that
  science has brought about and the organisation required to control them, in
  what has been called by Mr. Wells a race between education and catastrophe.
  In scientific language, it has produced a serious stress because of the
  hurrying on of change of conditions and the lagging behind of the methods of
  controlling them. It is this stress, I think, which has broken up the system.
  You may even say that the war itself is no cause of anything, but a result of
  the purely automatic action of shearing forces, as when a testing machine
  breaks a metal bar.</p>

  <p>'The end of the war has left us with a whole host of individuals set free,
  and the business before science men is to organise this new body. It is a big
  problem, and requires scientific thought, temperament, and outlook to rewrite
  practically the whole of our knowledge. It reminds me of the tremendous rush
  there was amongst scientific men to provide workers to overhaul practically
  very thing in biology (and theology) and other parts of human knowledge after
  the doctrines of Darwin were well established. I take it that all the
  departments of human life have to be re-written by men under the influence of
  the spirit of science. Our books have to be rewritten, our very dictionaries.
  I have often amused myself with the _Oxford Dictionary,_ or found it
  necessary to send a boy to that authority for a definition, and it has pretty
  nearly always been false. Take such a simple case as the word "democracy."
  The _Oxford Dictionary_ hasn't a thing to tell you about the meaning of
  "democracy" as we use it to-day. It tells you nothing of the living use of
  words. That is one of the terrible dangers of leaving our books in the hands
  of men who have not got that outlook which experiment in science brings to
  the individual. Consequently I say that the duty of scientific men is to
  scour the whole area of knowledge and rewrite it to bring out new standards,
  new values, by means of which labour and industry itself, in the first
  instance, can be reorganised (the schools first should be reorganised), and
  then you can extend it into the wider area of international affairs.</p>

  <p>'They tell us that economics cannot change our human nature. That is the
  great duty and service of science&mdash;to change human nature. Scientific
  men have to collect a band of disciples and make a new world. As far as I can
  gather, from a long connection with boys, the only scientific quality which
  is constant is inertia in response to change. The actual change itself, when
  it has arrived, no one objects to, and every one says, "Why didn't we do that
  before?" Scientific workers rarely have their opportunity in industry. To
  have their full opportunity they are to set forth in the spirit of the Great
  Master to found a new kingdom: not to manage industry by the standards and
  values of the present, but to transform them. And they must do what our
  Master Himself did&mdash;collect a faithful band of disciples imbued with the
  same belief. I know it is freely said (I have been corresponding with some of
  the leaders in industry) that scientific men cannot do this thing. They can,
  if only they are true to themselves and their vision; they can absolutely
  change the whole system under which industry is worked, and change the world
  to their ideals.</p>

  <p>'"Come, and I will make you fishers of men..." The great work that lies
  before scientific workers to-day is to extend the area of their labours, to
  become not fishers of facts but fishers of men. There will always be a
  distinguished band of purely scientific men devoted to pure science, who will
  abide devoted to pure science; but with the present number trained in
  science, we claim them also to organise the machinery that science has
  created. They must leave their ships and nets and become fishers of men...I
  dare say even scientific workers know that is from the Bible. One of the
  greatest tragedies scientific men have allowed is for others to steal the
  Bible from them. The Old and New Testaments, with their record of progressive
  revelation, form the most scientific book ever seen. Yet scientific men have
  allowed a certain type of men to steal it from them. Bible stealing is an old
  thing, and one favourite method is to bind it in morocco and to put it on a
  top shelf...</p>

  <p>'But I must return to my scientific business. When I was at Cambridge I
  was not regarded as scientific. I was amongst those who took mathematics, and
  those who took mathematics and classics were respectable and had to attend
  chapel. But if you inclined at all towards science, or even ethics, you were
  not supposed to attend chapel...</p>

  <p>'I said that I have recently discovered I am a scientific worker, that I
  have been working a scientific experiment, though not of the kind accepted
  for report to the Royal Society. It has been worked by being headmaster of a
  school for thirty years and by having taught for forty years. When I became a
  headmaster I began by introducing engineering into the school&mdash;applied
  science. The first effect was that a large number of boys who could not do
  other things could do that. They began to like their work in school. They
  began to like school. That led on to introducing a large number of other
  sciences, such as agricultural chemistry, horse-shoeing (if that is a
  science), metallurgical chemistry, bio-chemistry, agriculture; and, of
  course, these new sorts of work interested a large number of other boys of a
  type different from the type interested in the old work, so we got an
  exceptional number of boys, curiously enough, unexpectedly liking w ha t they
  had to do in school. Then I ventured to do something daring; it is most
  daring to introduce the scientific method of finding out the truth&mdash;a
  dangerous thing&mdash;by the process of experiment and research. We began to
  replace explicit teaching by finding out. We did this first with these newly
  introduced sciences. Then we began to impress the aims and outlook of science
  on to other departments of school life. History, for instance: we began to
  replace the old class-room teaching and learning by a laboratory for history,
  full of books and other things required in abundance, so that boys in all
  parts of the school could, for some specific purpose (not to learn; to go
  into school to learn was egotistical), find out the things we required for
  to-day. We set them to find out things for the service of science, the
  service of literature, modern languages, music.</p>

  <p>'This began to change the whole organisation of the school, its aims and
  methods. It was no use organising boys in forms by the ordinary methods of
  promotion for this sort of work. You have to make up your mind what you have
  to do, and then go about and collect .anybody who would be of service to that
  particular work. You would require boys of one characteristic and boys of
  another. You make them up into teams for the particular work they have to do.
  The boys who do not fit into this or that particular work must have some
  other particular work found for them. You begin to design the work of the
  school for them. You must have all the apparatus you want for it, and you
  must organise for it, but you begin by organising the work for the boys and
  what they need to find out, and not by putting the boys into the
  organisation. Now, presently you discover, when you do this, that not a
  single boy exists who is not wanted for some particular work; to carry out
  your object every boy is fundamentally equal. One does this, one does that.
  Each boy has his place in the team, and in his place he is as important as
  any other boy. Placing them in order of meri t does not work any more. The
  scientific method absolutely changed the position towards class lists and
  order of merit. That was an astonishing result.</p>

  <p>'Another astonishing result was that we could not have anybody who was not
  working. If a boy was not working, you could see that he was not working. You
  could see that he was doing nothing. He could not sit at the back of a
  class-room and seem to be working. Everybody was working. You can manage that
  in school, but what about the world? All sorts of people may seem to be
  working and not be working at all. The curate may be doing nothing! (_Chuckle
  and something inaudible_.) This seems to land us into the extraordinary fact
  that no community if it is scientifically organised can carry anyone who does
  not do service. I hope you will agree with me that that is scientific.</p>

  <p>'A little farther on I turned round on the boys and the parents. (Both are
  my business.) I said, "I have and the school has tried all it could to see to
  it that your boy got the right kind of work to do. We spared no trouble or
  expense to see to it that he might be able to perform his service in the
  school and to the community...When you go forth to your father's works, keep
  in mind that it is your business to see to it that every person that comes
  within your influence has a like opportunity." That is totally different from
  your duty to your neighbour as taught in the Church Catechism. We have landed
  ourselves hopelessly in the position of having a practical community
  definition of our duty towards our neighbour. You remember the rich young
  ruler who came to ask what his duty was, and went away sorrowful because he
  had great possessions. Some of these possessions were perhaps intellectual. I
  like to think of Watts' picture of that man and I like Watts' idea that he
  came back. I hope if any of our boys go a way they will come back.</p>

  <p>'Another step. This actual love of work spreads, and ultimately every one
  comes within its influence, and they begin to like the service they are
  rendering. Finally, competition dwindles and passes away, so that we have
  reached what appears to be a change in human nature. It is not really a
  change, but by care and attention calling out what has always been ready
  there in human nature, namely, a first instinctive love to create. I have
  always held that competition is a secondary interest and creation a primary
  instinct. Competition dwindles and passes away. Competition is a very feeble
  incentive to live. It is cheap and easy to arouse the motive, it is a swift
  motive and on the surface of things ready for you, but it is not even a
  powerful motive. Half the boys it dispirits and leaves idle and useless.</p>

  <p>'The passing of competition leads on to another thing passing away, which
  is this: you soon find that a body of workers that as a community has
  attempted to provide for itself, as a community adapts itself to the
  community spirit, and punishment is totally unnecessary. It was a long time
  before that dawned on me. I have not, as a headmaster, taken any part in any
  shape in punishing boys directly, either by the easy methods supposed to
  train them for after life or by the other methods that have sprung from the
  fertile brains of a dominant order. Punishment, I declare from years of
  experience in this experiment, is a crime: not only a crime but a blunder.
  Why? Because it is a cheap and easy thing. If you punish it is easy, but if a
  community has so to arrange itself and adapt itself as to produce the
  reaction on the individual not to do objectionable things, that is hard. It
  is complicated. It requires an abundance of real sacrifice. It demands
  readjustment of everything upon a basis of service. I have been much
  impressed recently by the effect of having punishment organised in removing
  any activity on the part of the community itself towards adjusting itself so
  that punishment should not be necessary. I used to flatter myself, "I don't
  punish that boy, my prefects do; they keep me right." But I have been
  convinced by my thirty years of experiment that that was all wrong. These
  things come slowly. Now, without any action on my part, the prefects have
  stopped punishing, and a good thing for them. If they leave their boots
  about, the small boys will too, and they will have to punish them for doing
  so. To leave your own boots about like a lord is a fine thing, and to punish
  the small boy who does so is also a fine thing! But it is easy. The hard
  thing is never to leave your own boots about...</p>

  <p>'The reactions that we have been taught to make in the world are weakly
  static. What is the good of static methods? There is friction; we are told
  how to overcome frictional resistance. We can put an end to friction by
  stopping the machine. That is the static method of dealing with friction. Or
  we can go on working the machine, with oil and care...which is not so cheap
  and easy, but which gets somewhere...If we try to remove friction by the
  static methods of punishment we are removing the incentive to live a
  dangerous life. "The secret of a joyful life is to live dangerously." You
  only live dangerously if you are perpetually trying to overcome your own
  inertia and trying to get the capacity to do great things. If you are only
  defensive, static, it is a waste of time. Yet those defences and resistances
  are securely placed in the governance of the state. What a curious thing is
  the form of government! Its characteristics include no repentance, no regret,
  otherwise it would acknowledge itself less than the governed. Its ideal is a
  perpetual static calm. _Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re._ It is the method
  of people who perform the confidence trick. It is the method of "If you want
  peace, prepare for war."...'</p>

  <p>For some minutes Mr. Sanderson paused. He looked at his notes. He was
  obviously very fatigued, but very resolute to continue. He read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Acquisitiveness leads to these glorified things: general science, general
  knowledge, national history, scholarships, examinations, advanced courses,
  "interesting" things (whoever wanted to be interested), the theological thing
  called syncretism, tact, Swindling...'</p>

  <p>Mr. Sanderson stopped and smiled in a breathless manner, half panting,
  half laughing, very characteristic of him. His glasses gleamed at the
  audience. His smile meant: 'We are going a little too fast, boys. Where are
  we getting to Where are we getting to' He affected to refer to his notes and
  then broke away upon a new line.</p>

  <p>'Out of all these things I have been telling you, out of all these
  considerations, evolves the modern school. The modern school is not made by
  the very simple and easy method of abandoning Greek. (Laughter.) Nor is it
  made by introducing science or engineering. The modern school's business is
  to impress into the service of man every branch of human knowledge we can get
  hold of. The modern method in the modern school does not depend on any method
  of teaching. We hear a great deal about methods of teaching languages,
  mathematics, science; they are all trivial. The great purpose is to enlist
  the boys or girls in the service of man to-day and man to-morrow. The method
  which makes learning easy is waste of time. What boy will succumb to the
  entreaty: "Come, I will make you clever; it will be so easy for you; you will
  be able to learn it without an effort"? What they succumb to is service for
  the community. I have tested that in the workshops. They don't want to make
  things for themselves; they soon cease to have any longing desire to make
  anything even for their mothers. What they love to do is to take part in some
  great work that must be done for the community; some work that goes on beyond
  them, some great spacious work. You can spread them out into all sorts of
  spacious things, in all departments, such things as taking part in
  investigating the truth. The truth, for instance, of the actual condition of
  the coal-miners or of any miners. An important question which we have been
  concerned with for at least three years is "_What is China?_ What is it
  like?" You may say, "Methods of teaching geography." But who ever learned
  anything from geography&mdash;as geography? Who wants to know
  geography&mdash;as geography? Books exist for it, maps, plasticine exists for
  it. We want to know about China. If we are going to see to it that everyone
  of our working men has the same opportunities that in our school we give to
  our boys we shall have some difficulty with China. We shall never be able to
  give our working people these opportunities unless the Chinese give them too.
  Scientific men must find themselves dominant in the Foreign Office and
  Colonial Service so as to know what is the nature of the people in these
  distant places, how we can bring to them what we are able to give to our
  sons&mdash;the opportunity of making the highest and best use of their
  faculties. We shall not get that sort of thing from geography books. You will
  have to take the boys and let them find out what men have done who have been
  in China: to get products from China; to know its geology, and whether, after
  all, the Chinese do so deeply love rice that they want to live on a very
  little a day. Do the Chinese love rice? Do they love underselling white
  labour? Do they want to? That is real geography, but not class-room
  geography. That extension of interest, until China is brought into the
  class-room and the boys are finding out about it, is, I claim, one of the
  deepest and greatest tasks to be undertaken. China-India-the Durham
  miners&mdash;spacious undertakings...</p>

  <p>'Schools must be equipped spaciously, _spaciously_, and they must have a
  spacious staff. I have the list of our staff here. We have masters for
  mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, biology, zoology, anthropology,
  botany, geology, architecture, classics, history, literature, geography,
  archaeology, economics, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Eastern
  languages, art, applied art, handicrafts, and music.</p>

  <p>'"Impossible," some people say. There is no great school in the land but
  could quite well afford it...</p>

  <p>'We must send out workers imbued with the determination to seek and
  investigate truth&mdash;truth that will make them free&mdash;and to take
  great care that in the search for truth they will never take part in or
  sympathise with those methods by which the edge of truth is blunted.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The voice beside me stopped. Some one pushed up a chair for
  Sanderson and he sat down. There was applause. I stood up and then struck by
  a thought, whispered: 'Would you like to answer a few questions?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes. Certainly,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Not too tired to answer them?'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;no.'</p>

  <p>I had a little strip of notes In my hand and I thought of underlining one
  or two points in this tremendous project of a school he had spread before his
  audience before I let in the questioners. I began by saying that the lecture
  had been a little hard to follow but that it would repay following into the
  remotest corners of its meaning. Then I heard a little commotion behind me
  and turned round to see what was the matter. Sanderson had slipped from his
  chair on to the platform and was lying on his back breathing hoarsely. His
  collar and tie were removed forthwith. There were several doctors on the
  platform with us and they set to work upon him. I hesitated for a moment and
  then declared the meeting at an end, and asked the audience to disperse as
  speedily as possible. I thought it was an epileptic fit and I had no sense of
  Sanderson's impending death. I had never seen anything of the sort before. I
  could not believe it when they told me he was dead.</p>

  <p>The windows of the hot and sultry room were opened and most of the people
  made their way out, but the reporters remained and one or two persons of the
  curious type who hung about vaguely with an affectation of decorous sympathy.
  The lecture had been a very difficult one for the newspaper men, and they
  came now with a certain eagerness to ask questions about Oundle and
  Sanderson's career. I answered them as well as I could. Sanderson lay across
  the back of the platform, bare-chested and still. It became evident that I
  had to seek out Mrs. Sanderson and tell her of this disaster.</p>

  <p>There was a little difficulty in ascertaining at which hotel Mr. and Mrs.
  Sanderson had been staying, and when I got there I found she was out
  shopping, and I waited some time for her return. Meanwhile her daughter and
  her daughter-in-law at Oundle were called up by telephone to come to her at
  once in London. I told her at first that her husband was ill, and then, as we
  went together in a cab to University College, dangerously ill. She was fully
  prepared to hear from the doctors at the hospital that the end had come. The
  poor lady took the news very simply and bravely.</p>

  <p>In the Mortuary Chapel of University College Hospital I saw my friend's
  face for the last time, in all the irresponsive dignity of death. We took
  Mrs. Sanderson to him and left her for a time alone with him. Four years
  before in the same London hotel at which she was now solitary, he and she had
  shared the bitter grief of their eldest son's death together.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">An event of this sort produces the most various reactions in
  people, and I recall with a distressful amusement two unknown persons who
  accosted me as I went out from University College to find a taxi to take me
  to 1rs. Sanderson. One was a young woman who came up to me and said: 'Don't
  be grieved for your friend, Mr. Wells. It was a splendid thing to die like
  that in the midst of life, after giving his message.'</p>

  <p>I did not accept these congratulations and I made no reply to her. I was
  thinking that a little acute observation, a little more consideration on my
  part, a finer sense of the labour I was putting upon my friend, might have
  averted his death al together. And I was by no means convinced that his
  message was delivered, that it had reached the people I had hoped it would
  reach and a waken. I had counted on much more from Sanderson. This death
  seemed to me and still seems far more like frustration than release.</p>

  <p>Then presently as I gesticulated for a cab near Gower Street Station, I
  found a pale-faced, earnest-looking man beside me asking for a moment's
  speech. 'Mr. Wells,' he said, 'does not this sudden event give you new views
  of immortality, new lights upon spiritual realities?'</p>

  <p>I stared at a sort of greedy excitement in his face. 'None whatever!' I
  said at last and got into my taxi.</p>

  <p>I must confess that to this day I can find in Sanderson's death nothing
  but irreparable loss. He left much of his work in a state so incomplete that
  I cannot see how his successors can carry it on. In matters educational he
  was before all things a practical artist, and education is altogether too
  much the prey of theories. He filled me&mdash;a mere writer, with envious
  admiration when I saw how he could control and shape things to his will, how
  he could experiment and learn and how he could use his boys, his governors,
  his staff, to try out and shape his creative dreams.</p>

  <p>He was a strong man and in a very profound and simple way a good man, and
  it was a very helpful thing to feel oneself his ally. But now that he is
  gone, now that all his later projects and intentions shrivel and fade and his
  great school recedes visibly towards the commonplace, I do not know where to
  turn to do an effective stroke for education. It is only schoolmasters and
  school-mistresses and educational authorities and school governors and school
  promoters and university teachers who can really carry on the work that he
  began. In this book I have tried to set out as clearly as possible, and
  largely in his own words, his fundamental ideas of the suppression of
  competition by co-operation, of the return of schools to real service and of
  a House of Vision, a Temple of History and the Future, as the brain and
  centre of community life. This present book is, as it were, a simplified
  diagram of the teachings less luminously and more fully set out in the
  official Life.</p>

  <p>One thing I shared with Sanderson altogether, and that was our conviction
  that the present common life of men, at once dull and disorderly,
  competitive, uncreative, cruelly stupid and stupidly cruel, unless it is to
  be regarded merely as a necessary phase in the development of a nobler
  existence, is a thing not worth having, that it does not matter who drops
  dead or how soon we drop dead out of such a world. Unless there is a more
  abundant life before mankind, this scheme of space and time is a bad joke
  beyond our understanding, a flare of vulgarity, an empty laugh, braying
  across the mysteries. But we two shared the belief that latent in men and
  perceptible in men is a greater mankind, great enough to make every effort to
  realise it fully worth while, and to make the whole business of living worth
  while.</p>

  <p>And the way to that realisation lies, we both believed, through thought
  and through creative effort, through science and art and the school.</p>
