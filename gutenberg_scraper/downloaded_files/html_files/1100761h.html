<p class="first"><i>The strange story of Peter Wacks, a timid
soul who became a cold-blooded murderer, is the theme of "The
Red Paste Murders." ... Readers will find much excitement and
many shocks in the Jekyll and Hyde existence of this remarkable
man, known as "Rabbits" to his intimates, who, in a fortnight,
became the terror of a whole city. Arthur Gask, the Adelaide
author, chose a local setting for this novel, and it is among
familiar scenes that the story races to its unusual
climax.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; A CITY OF FEAR.</h2>

<p class="first">I SHALL never know what dreadful impulse
compels me to write it all down.</p>

<p>My life is so many, many times forfeit to the State that were
my hideous secret to become known, even now, after all these
years, within an hour infuriated crowds would gather at my gate
and I should be torn limb from limb without the slightest hope
of mercy or reprieve.</p>

<p>I shall never be forgiven.</p>

<p>My crimes were too brutal. I spared neither young nor old,
and every deed of violence that could bring pain and horror it
was fiendish joy to do.</p>

<p>I have before me now a blurred, torn page of an old
newspaper&mdash;all dim and ghostly in its faded ink. It has
great, startling headlines, and all about me.</p>

<p>The fiend of the ages it calls me&mdash;the criminal of all
time; a foul and dreadful maniac stalking through the city with
his bloody hands uplifted against all mankind; a very prince of
vileness; a monster that out-Satans Satan in his crimes; and so
on, and so on.</p>

<p>So many times I wonder if it can possibly be all true, and if
it be, after all, nothing but the nightmare of some cruel and
dreadful dream.</p>

<p>How well do I remember the very exact words in which the
'Adelaide Evening Journal' recorded the discovery of the first
crime. I read and re-read them so often that every line is
seared for ever in my mind.</p>

<p>"Early this morning," they run, "a terrible discovery was
made on the park lands between North Adelaide and the bank of
the Torrens River. Michael Dayman, a workman in the employ of
Messrs. John Shearer and Sons, the well-known agricultural
implement makers of Kilkenny, was passing along a lower road
when he noticed under a clump of trees what he at first thought
was the form of a sleeping man.</p>

<p>"Approaching the spot, however, he was horrified to find that
the man was dead, and that his face was covered with blood. He
saw the head had been terribly battered in. Dayman communicated
at once with the Bowden police, and within an hour the body had
been conveyed to the city mortuary. There it was almost
immediately identified as that of Alderman Charles Bentley, who
had been missing from his home since last evening.</p>

<p>"The dreadful news at once occasioned a tremendous sensation
in the city, and the flags on all the public buildings were
immediately placed at half-mast. It is certain that a terrible
and ghastly murder has been committed, but it is too early as
yet to hazard any guess as to the motive for the crime. Robbery,
however, it was not, for nothing at all had been removed from
the person of the dead man. His watch, his ring, and all his
other valuables were quite intact. The police are naturally
reticent about the matter, but it is understood that his wounds
were of a terrible nature, and that death must have been almost
instantaneous after the blows.</p>

<p>"The utmost sympathy is extended to the deceased's relatives.
The alderman was too well known to our readers for us to refer
now to his public life and work. In our grief we can only say
that not only has the city of Adelaide lost one of the most
loyal and honored sons, but that the whole State of South
Australia also, and the great Commonwealth itself, is poorer by
his loss. It will be the sincere prayer of everyone that the
vile and brutal murderer may be speedily brought to book."</p>

<p>It was a terrible thing that I should kill that poor old man,
and yet his death lay only at the very beginning of my path of
crime. It was as nothing to what was to follow later. Week after
week, horror upon horror was to gather on the city; fear was to
hang over it like a dreadful cloud, and panic even was to seize
the strongest as they went upon their ways.</p>

<p>Did I do all this?</p>

<p>Could it possibly be I who was the man? Could it, indeed, be
I who, in those hot midsummer days, made great strong men afraid
of their own shadows, and brought this nameless terror into all
their lives; who made each lonely road at dusk a path of dread
and of possible foul, awful crime; who filled ten thousand
gentle breasts with horror, and who made the very faces of the
children blanch and whiten when the night wind stirred among the
trees?</p>

<p>Every day almost I tell myself it must be all a dream. I
could never have done such wrongs.</p>

<p>I was always such a coward and such a law-abiding man. I have
always had such horror of violence and have always been so meek
and gentle in my ways.</p>

<p>No&mdash;no, it is all a mistake. I have been sick and ill,
and all these thoughts came only to me in the tossing of some
fevered sleep. I am harmless and innocent as other men are.</p>

<p>But alas! often I take out that dreadful copy of the 'Times
of Adelaide.' I have kept it through all these years at the
bottom of my drawer. It is hidden there so that Lucy may never
see it and be reminded of those days.</p>

<p>Oh! how it points the accusing finger at me in its stern and
baleful way.</p>

<p>It tells so clearly how the grip of terror held the city
then, and explains far better than could any words of mine to
what a pitch of horror everything had come. Dated only just a
fortnight after Alderman Bentley died, it is headed, "No Panic,
Please."</p>

<p>"This morning for the eighth time during the past fortnight
and for the fourth day in succession," it begins, "it is our
distressing duty to record for our readers the happening of a
new and dreadful crime. Last evening, about nine o'clock, Dr.
Charles Smallwood, a popular and esteemed medical practitioner
of Lower Unley, was foully done to death in the open public
road, within a few yards of his home. With the manner of his
death we have unhappily of late become only too familiar, but
the reason for the brutal act is again as mysterious and as
obscure as are the reasons for all the other crimes that have
recently been perpetrated in our midst. As usual there was no
attempt at robbery&mdash;no removal of anything from the person
of the murdered man&mdash;no semblance of suspicion that he had
enemies in any quarter, or that anyone had ever wished him ill.
There is no suggestion of any of these things&mdash;nothing
again but, as in all the other deaths, the sheer wanton lust of
blood.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?</p>

<p>"As a people it has been always our pride that in all
circumstances we can keep our heads. Down all the life-story of
our race we have been always stubborn and unflinching in
adversity, and the greater our need the greater have been our
courage and endurance. Surely we now in Adelaide have never
needed these qualities more than we do today.</p>

<p>"With what are we faced? Let us be open and candid with
ourselves. Our city is no longer secure to live in, and the
shadow of a dreadful death hangs nightly on us all.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in our midst&mdash;somewhere unnoticed and
unmarked among us&mdash;lurks a maniac of most horrible
proclivities, a man of terrible and diseased mind.</p>

<p>"We are, of course, in complete ignorance as to how it has
come to happen, but, somehow, in some poor wretch the beautiful
and complicated machinery of the mind has broken down, and in
its fall has loosed amongst us a ravening and ferocious
beast.</p>

<p>"Unhappily it is not with the ordinary type of madman that we
probably have now to deal.</p>

<p>"Outwardly he may show no signs at all of his malady, and our
difficulty lies in the probability that he is not always mad.
His mania may come on in paroxysms&mdash;perhaps only at night.
By day, perhaps, he is a quiet and inoffensive member of the
community. Maybe he works just like an ordinary man in some
factory&mdash;some office, or some shop. Maybe he stops quietly
at home, for we know nothing of his circumstances or conditions
of life.</p>

<p>"At any rate, as long as daylight lasts so far his madness
has left behind no trail. Then, perhaps, he is as sane as anyone
in the State.</p>

<p>"But when night comes apparently an irresistible impulse
seizes him. Every street and path and road becomes his hunting
ground, and the chance of sudden death looms over everyone
outside locked doors.</p>

<p>"With our knowledge of what has already occurred it is too
much to hope that the last chapter of our trouble has been
written, or, indeed, that we shall have no more dreadful
happenings to record.</p>

<p>"How, then, shall we attempt to grapple with the evil, and
what can we possibly learn to help us from a cool and calm
consideration of the methods of these dreadful crimes?</p>

<p>"Let us briefly refer to them seriatim as they have occurred
in the city and its suburbs.</p>

<p>"A fortnight ago yesterday, on Tuesday night, Alderman
Bentley was killed on the park lands between North Adelaide and
the bank of the Torrens River. (Shall we ever learn by what
strange chance this dear old man became the first victim of
these bloody crimes?) Two days later Police Constable Holthusen
was killed almost on the same spot. Both had been bludgeoned
with the same kind of heavy, blunt weapon.</p>

<p>"The day following, on Friday evening, Mrs. Hutton, a young
and recently married woman, met her dreadful fate near South
station, also, be it noted, when crossing over the park lands.
Again, one fierce, vicious blow with some blunt instrument, and
the poor creature was left to die where she fell.</p>

<p>"On Saturday nothing happened, and nothing on Sunday either.
It will be remembered, however, that heavy rain fell on both
these evenings.</p>

<p>"On Monday again a blank day, but at 9.35 that night
information was brought to Woodville Police Station that Rex
Ferguson, a St. Peter's boy, just over seventeen, had been
chased by an unknown man for two hundred yards along the Port
road. Young Ferguson is a cool, intelligent young fellow, and he
describes his pursuer as a thin, medium-sized man without a hat.
Unhappily, the night was dark, and he was unable to see the
man's face. The escape was apparently quite accidental, for it
was only by chance that Ferguson turned round to find, as he
says, a black figure rushing furiously down upon him. He does
not remember hearing any footsteps. He took to his heels
instantly, and, being a strong runner, providentially escaped.
But this is significant&mdash;Ferguson said the man held him for
quite a hundred yards. He heard him plainly close behind.</p>

<p>"To continue&mdash;the next night, on Tuesday, a week ago
today, Walter Bevan, a porter from Kilkenny station, was killed
just after bathing, on the sandhills at Grange. The same black
tale&mdash;bludgeoned on the head with a blunt instrument. There
were other bathers near him not fifty yards away, and he was
discovered almost at once. But no sound, no cry had been
heard&mdash;just the same usual silent, dreadful death.</p>

<p>"Thursday and Friday we had nothing to record, and we are
sure our readers scanned our columns in thankful relief. Some of
us, indeed, were sanguine that the measures taken by the
authorities and the increased vigilance of us all were already
bearing fruit.</p>

<p>"But, no&mdash;the bloody run of crime goes on, and the
week-end has been one of sustained and continued horror.</p>

<p>"Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, and last night, too,
have all, one after another, had their awful deed to record.</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Perterson, of Toorak, was killed while asleep on his
verandah on Friday.</p>

<p>"On Saturday night Mathew Crane, a tram conductor on duty,
was struck on the head when actually not five yards away from
his tram, just as he was altering the tram time-indicator at the
terminus opposite Kensington Gardens. He died an hour later in
the Adelaide Hospital.</p>

<p>"Sunday brought a double crime&mdash;the killing of Mr. and
Mrs. Van Dene, in their own drawing-room in Medindie. It is very
difficult to write calmly here. Those whose duty it was to visit
the scene of the crime described it as being as terrible in its
surroundings as anything the mind of anyone could conceive. For
the first time the assassin had been interrupted in his ghastly
work, and Mr. Van Dene had put up a gallant fight. But we cannot
further harrow the feelings of our readers&mdash;the dreadful
facts were detailed in our columns yesterday.</p>

<p>"Then last night&mdash;this last crime, the murder of Dr.
Smallwood. We had hoped that the assassin was not uninjured by
what happened on Sunday, or would at least have been
disheartened for a time by the resistance he undoubtedly
encountered. But, no&mdash;directly darkness fell last evening
he returned to his bloody work, and once again a harmless and
inoffensive member of the community has met with a dreadful
death.</p>

<p>"Now there can be no hiding from ourselves that we are all
living in very black and deadly peril.</p>

<p>"Tonight&mdash;tomorrow night&mdash;or any night until the
madman is laid low it may be the fate of any one of us to suffer
sudden death. It is a dreadful thing to contemplate, and we may
well all feel in a state of nerves.</p>

<p>"But let us straight away apply the antidote and drill in
forcibly to ourselves that there is not the slightest need for
panic. In the end the community must inevitably prove stronger
than the individual. Sooner or later, and probably much sooner
than any of us think, the madman will be laid by the heels.</p>

<p>"It is well known everywhere that special measures are being
taken for the trapping of the madman. As far as possible
revolvers are being served out to responsible individuals, and
police patrols have everywhere been doubled. It is an open
secret, too, that bloodhounds are now on their way from
Melbourne, and are expected to arrive in the city this morning.
Indeed, we have received information that this afternoon the
Chief Commissioner of Police is issuing placards broadcast
warning everyone generally, in the event of another tragedy, not
to crowd round but to stand clear of the body and give the dogs
a chance.</p>

<p>"We can rest confident that the authorities are in every way
alive to the needs of the situation, and it is up to us loyally
and manfully to support them. How then can we help? In many
ways. Firstly, each district must organise its own local
Vigilance Society. Great credit is due in this respect to Mr.
Peter Wacks, of Bowden, for being first in the field.</p>

<p>"On Saturday this gentleman was instrumental in forming the
first Committee of Public Safety in his own district. Following
upon an outdoor meeting at the station gates, at which we
understand he made an impassioned and eloquent appeal for unity,
he at once got together a small band of local stalwarts, and by
now has each road in his neighborhood under special and
particular control. And this is what all other parts of Adelaide
and its suburbs must do. Special constables must be enrolled
everywhere&mdash;armlets must be given out, and truncheons must
be provided. Public meetings must be called at once, and within
three or four days at most a new and easy running machinery
should be at the service of the regular police.</p>

<p>"A word now for our guidance as to the probable personality
of the madman we are looking for. It was not for nothing that we
referred above to the nauseating details of his crimes. A man
cannot commit nine murders and leave behind nothing that cannot
be deduced from the environment and methods of his savagery.</p>

<p>"What do we gather from these cases then?</p>

<p>"He is certainly a young man&mdash;probably well under
thirty; almost certainly, too, he is of a wiry and slight build,
and undoubtedly he is an athlete.</p>

<p>"The testimony of young Ferguson in that respect is most
important and the authorities have carefully been over the
ground with him where he was chased. It is a good two hundred
yards from where he points out he first saw the man running on
him to where he had out-distanced him and was safe. As we
remarked before, it is most significant that Ferguson was only
just able to hold his own for the first half of the pursuit, and
it proves conclusively that the man we are looking for is a
first-class runner.</p>

<p>"Ferguson is one of the best sprinters in St. Peter's
School&mdash;if not, indeed, the very best. He can do the
hundred yards in less than eleven seconds and in the
intercollegiate sports last year he also swept the board in all
the races up to the half-mile. So there can be no doubt whatever
that the man who chased him is something of a runner, and good
runners, as we all know, are nearly always built on the light
side and are rarely of more than medium height.</p>

<p>"It fits in, too, with everything that his footsteps were
noiseless. Probably he is wearing rubber soles, or at least his
heels are of rubber, and he is very light on his feet.</p>

<p>"In general appearance he must be quite harmless and
ordinary-looking, for it is a sinister fact that he has
apparently been able to approach all his victims without
exciting any suspicion or distrust.</p>

<p>"We have said he is probably of the wiry type, for fairly
strong he certainly must be. The deadly blows with which he does
his ghastly work are conclusive evidence that the man is no
weakling.</p>

<p>"Now as to the weapon he is using. All the medical testimony
goes to prove that it is a short bar of iron with a smooth round
knob at the end. The bar is not more than twelve inches long at
most, and it is probably a part of some piece of disused
machinery. It cannot be more than twelve inches long, for he
must be carrying it about under his coat or in one of his
pockets. Detective-Inspector Miles distinctly warned us all at
the inquest last Thursday to beware of any man who was not
walking with his hands both free from his pockets.</p>

<p>"One word now in conclusion as to what may still be before
us.</p>

<p>"Unhappily these crimes all show an upward and progressive
tendency. The first one was probably unpremeditated or, at any
rate, was not undertaken with the confidence of the later ones.
Poor old Alderman Bentley was struck three times, and the first
two were feeble blows. In all the other cases, except in that of
Mr. Van Dene, one blow and one only was inflicted. Indeed, it
looks each time as if the madman had just waited and struck at
his leisure&mdash;without any haste or indecision.</p>

<p>"Then, as to when he has committed his crimes. Here again we
regretfully notice a progressive confidence and boldness in his
actions. The first three murders were carried out on lonely park
lands, in comparatively unfrequented spots. Then we have the
attempt on the Port road, then the murder on the sands at
Grange. Next he actually enters a private garden at Toorak and
completes his ghastly work on a verandah. Then he kills on an
open public road&mdash;a well frequented road, even at
night&mdash;and kills, moreover, within a few yards and almost
in the presence of another man whose nearness he must have
realised. The next night he actually penetrates into a private
house, and last night he again chances discovery by attacking in
a main thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"We dwell on these things because, unhappily, we must
henceforth be prepared for greater boldness still on the part of
the maniac, and must realise that we are not even safe in our
own homes unless behind closed and barred doors.</p>

<p>"Now for a few simple suggestions.</p>

<p>"People should not be foolhardy enough to sleep outdoors
unless they have a good dog with them. No one should go out
alone at night, and any promenader by himself after dark should
be at once regarded with suspicion. Every house door should be
locked after sunset and all families should provide themselves
with a loud whistle. Any suspicious or unnatural conduct on the
part of any individual should be at once reported to the
police.</p>

<p>"We share with our readers the horror of the dreadful
possibilities that lie over us, and we realise to the full the
mental anguish of living under this reign of terror, but we must
all be brave about it, and, we insist again, it can be only a
matter of time, and perhaps very little time, before our
anxieties will be over for ever and the normal condition of safe
untroubled life will be resumed again in all respects."</p>

<p>Oh, what a dreadful thing it is for me to read this now, and
what a hateful memory it calls up of all those days. Why do I
not tear it up? I cannot, for its very horror fascinates me, and
it has become, like my own thoughts, part of myself.</p>

<p>But I don't always think I was THE MAN. Sometimes I am at
peace for a while, a very little while.</p>

<p>I kneel in chapel with my wife and boys. I hear the gentle
voices mingling with my own, the music of the organ soothes me,
and my thankful heart rejoices that my fears are baseless and
imaginary and I am only a morbid dreamer after all.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;then I pass my hand upon my thigh and feel the
callous where the bullet struck me and&mdash;I know it is all
true&mdash;all true.</p>

<p>I fall violently to my prayers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; MY EARLY DAYS.</h2>

<p>I WAS always such a coward.</p>

<p>I had no parents that I could remember and it was an old
maiden aunt who brought me up.</p>

<p>She was poor and kept a little greengrocer's shop in
Hindmarsh, a suburb of Adelaide, just off the great Port
road.</p>

<p>My childhood days are chiefly memories of the smell of stale
vegetables and the worries of very unhappy days at school.</p>

<p>I was a thin, white-faced little fellow and it seemed the
mission in life of all other boys to tease me and make me cry.
It was good sport to them to bully me, for I was always so
afraid of everyone, with timid, nervous ways that made me an
endless source of amusement to the school.</p>

<p>There was something about me that aways prevented my making
friends and no one ever gave me any pity in my troubles. The
other boys never seemed to leave me in peace. They took away my
marbles and broke up my few occasional toys. They stole my
sweets from me, and if ever I brought my dinner with me to
school I had to eat it stealthily away from everyone, or it
would have been seized at once by my tormentors and passed
round. Looking back, it seems strange that I never retaliated,
and, I think, never even complained. I seemed to have no spirit
at all, and accepting all my persecutions as quite in the
natural order of things, I slunk through my lonely boyhood, a
little, shrinking, joyless coward.</p>

<p>Yes, childhood and boyhood brought me sadly unhappy
schooldays, and when at fifteen years of age I was taken on, as
office boy, by Messrs. Winter and Winter, the big wholesale
chemists of Pirie street, my life story was much the same.</p>

<p>I had the heart of a coward.</p>

<p>Everybody found me out at once and the timidness of my
disposition served only to provoke the cruellest instincts of
those about me. The elder boys kicked and cuffed me as a matter
of daily routine. They played practical jokes upon me. They hid
my caps and inked my collars and generally in all their dealings
with me were as brutal and callous as only boys can be.</p>

<p>As we grew up together and the years went by, they never
seemed to get accustomed to me or to accord me the forbearance
most generally given to old fellow workers. I was always a
new-comer and always outside the pale of their confidences.</p>

<p>It was not that I purposely made myself unpopular; I did
nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Quick and sharp at figures as I always am, I had soon
mastered the work we had to do, and was often able to give a
lift to others in their tasks. Also, I was always ready to do
little outdoor services for anyone, to fetch and carry for the
office, to put the desks straight when they had been skylarking,
to get the water boiling for the tea, and generally to make
myself useful in countless little ways. But it was no good. It
never made any difference, and everyone held me at best in more
or less good-natured contempt.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN I had been eleven years at Winter and Winter's, I became,
by seniority, head clerk in the invoice office, and the firm
expressed their appreciation of my work by an increase in
salary. It was really no more than I deserved, for I was a good
servant to them, and always punctual, painstaking, and
thoroughly to be trusted in my work.</p>

<p>I was never late in the mornings&mdash;never exceeded the
hour allowed for dinner, and never grumbled when, in busy times,
we had to return to the office after tea.</p>

<p>I don't think, indeed, that I could ever have had any vices
at all. I didn't smoke, I was a strict teetotaler, and every
Sunday was a zealous frequenter of our little chapel on the Port
road. Also I had never had the courage for any of the love
adventures the other fellows had.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of what the heads thought of me, I had no
happiness at the office, because of the way the other clerks
treated me. There were ten of us in my room, and even when I was
formally placed in charge of them all they never showed me the
slightest atom of respect, or ceased for an hour to regard me as
in any other light than the butt for their cheap wit and the
natural object for their silly jokes.</p>

<p>I rather believe now they thought I didn't really mind it and
was quite content to provide amusement for the office. But I did
mind it, and it was torture to my little cowardly soul. I was
sensitive, very sensitive, behind all my timidity, and it galled
me to the quick to be cheeked and insulted by quite young
boys.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would get quite livid with anger at some scornful
impertinence of one of the juniors.</p>

<p>I would spring up from my desk and turn in a blast of fury
upon the offender, but no sooner was I on my feet than my
cowardice would take possession of me like a seizure, and I
would subside ingloriously to half-muttered threats that would
only redouble the laughter of my tormentors. They would slap me
on the back and tell me mockingly to go back to my hutch or the
bow-wows would bite me and I should lose my tail. 'Rabbits' was
what they used to call me, and the contempt they put in that one
word would sometimes make me wince to the very marrow.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rabbits," would sneer Waller, my junior by five years,
when introducing me to a newcomer. "Mr. Rabbits, our head
invoice clerk, and the composer of chess problems," and then
would follow a high-colored and spicy account of the latest
jokes that had been played upon me, and the helpless way in
which I had received them.</p>

<p>How I hated Waller! He was an idle, well-dressed fellow who
always came late to the office, and smoked a lot of cigarettes,
and was always in debt to some one or other. He had big fat legs
and went in for athletics; also he was great on football, and
went to horse-races, and all that sort of thing. He was the very
type of man I loathed, chiefly, I think, because he was careless
and reckless and never seemed to be afraid of anyone.</p>

<p>Of course, he was supposed to be under me in the office, but
I should sooner have expected the roof to fall upon me than for
him to have taken notice of anything I told him.</p>

<p>And as I have said, it was the same with them all. They just
ignored me, and the youngest junior, when he had been three
weeks in the office, would have looked upon it as a huge joke if
I had tried to insist upon his doing anything he didn't feel
inclined to do.</p>

<p>I began to perceive gradually that the firm was not satisfied
with the way I kept order in the office, and our Mr. William
began constantly to refer to it.</p>

<p>"Wacks," he said to me irritably one day, when he had
unexpectedly interrupted an exciting game of shove-penny in our
room, "why don't you keep order over them all? It's quite a
disgrace for a man of your age to let young boys waste their
time as they were doing today. You must stop it&mdash;do you
hear?"</p>

<p>Mr. William had always been kindness itself to me, and his
reproof made me want to burst into tears. But what could I do? I
knew that no one would ever obey me, and I hated myself for
being what I was.</p>

<p>I went home very dismally to my lodgings that evening, with
no appetite at all for the tasty tea my landlady had, as usual,
provided for me.</p>

<p>I lived in White Street, Bowden, about two miles from the
city, and had two comfortable little rooms that I could call my
own. My landlady was a hardworking widow, and I shared the house
with an old retired sea-captain, who had the two front rooms,
and a plain-clothes detective, who lived mysteriously in a back
room, off the garden.</p>

<p>Of the latter, whose name was Meadows, I knew very little,
and except for an occasional meeting in the street or a rare
'Good morning' in the hall should hardly, sometimes for weeks
and weeks on end, have been aware of his existence. He was a
quiet secretive-looking man, about thirty, and always went about
with a thick stick and with his coat buttoned high up to his
chin. He must have lodged with us quite six months before I even
got to know his name, but I gathered accidentally from Mrs.
Bratt that he had asked all about me soon after he came, and had
appeared quite interested, so she said, in all the details she
had been able to supply them.</p>

<p>Contrary to his appearance, however, he was not an
uncommunicative man in his spare time, and I had some very
interesting talks with him about his profession. He was very
enthusiastic about crime, and held strong views that everyone
was bursting with criminal propensities that only required
encouragement and opportunity to come out.</p>

<p>"None of us can ever tell," he would say mysteriously, "the
undiscovered criminals that we rub shoulders with every day. The
innocent looking man that we sit down next to in the train, for
aught we know, may have just come fresh from some ferocious
murder. Perhaps he has just hidden a body to rot in some
forgotten cellar, or in the thickets of some dark wood. Perhaps,
for all we can tell, he may now be living on the proceeds of
robbery and violence, and, even as we sit beside him, may be
planning the details of some further crime. The young woman who
brings us our meal at the restaurant where we go to dinner may
have been at home a secret poisoner, and somewhere may have a
six-foot grave to her credit in some quiet suburban cemetery.
The man who collects our tickets at the station barrier may have
broken into some mansion in his spare time, in years gone by,
and perhaps have married and set up house upon the proceeds of
his robbery. The assistant who serves us with groceries at the
store may be a secret and persistent embezzler of his master's
goods; the postman who brings us our letters may sneak postal
orders from time to time, and the very deacon who collects the
offertory from us at the church or chapel may pilfer
undiscovered, when chance comes his way. Crime is everywhere,"
he would wind up emphatically, "and not one-thousandth part of
it falls within the meshes of the Law."</p>

<p>Sometimes he stared so hard at me, and was so pointed and
sweeping in his accusations, that I got quite uncomfortable and
took to wondering exactly what particular crime he was
suspecting me of.</p>

<p>He would never tell me of the cases he was engaged upon, but
he nearly always seemed to have something to do, and at times
was away for weeks and weeks together. Mrs. Bratt told me he was
very highly thought of at headquarters.</p>

<p>The other lodger, Captain Barker, was a friend of mine, and I
may add, the only friend I had. I had got to know him first in
quite a casual sort of way. He was an old chap, well over sixty,
and he had been with Mrs. Bratt some years before I came to
lodge with her. He lived a lonely life, all by himself, and
never had any friends or callers, so Mrs. Bratt said, at any
time. At first, he never took the slightest notice of me when I
met him in the hall, and for a long time never condescended even
to say 'Good evening' or 'Good morning.' But one night he was
suddenly taken ill with some kind of fit and I helped Mrs. Bratt
to lift him into bed before the doctor came. He was so bad at
the time that I didn't think he knew I was helping, but when he
got better, as he did in about three weeks, he asked me to come
into his room, and from that evening dated a friendship that
lasted until he died.</p>

<p>He was a queer old chap, and so crippled after his seizure as
to be almost unable to move about. As far as I remember he never
left his rooms, and his only recreations were a daily
consumption of a surprising amount of cheap brandy, and his
games of chess with me.</p>

<p>I had rather fancied myself as a chess player until I met
him. For some years I had been always top-dog at the little
institute of our chapel, and had also studied the game for
countless hours from various chess handbooks at the library.
Consequently, I was decidedly a hard nut to crack, and our
minister, who was a Melbourne University man, and had played in
club tournaments and no end of matches, used often to say that I
was one of the best players he had ever met.</p>

<p>I remember so well my first game with Captain Barker. His
sitting-room was full of curiosities and odd things that he had
collected from all parts of the world on his voyages, and he had
been limping awkwardly round to explain them to me. I noticed a
set of queer-colored chess-men in a cabinet, and asked him
casually if he ever played. He stopped abruptly and snorted in a
way that quite scared me for a moment. Then he asked me roughly
if I would like to take him on.</p>

<p>I complied at once, as a matter of courtesy, and sat down to
the board with the intention of giving the old chap an easy time
and beating him just as gently as I could.</p>

<p>I thought I would just make a few simple moves and let the
game take care of itself until the time justified me in giving
him 'check,' and going off to bed. But I need not have worried
myself over my politeness. He could beat me hollow. He was a
consummate master of the game. He had me in difficulties in the
first dozen moves, and play as I would, I found myself tight in
the grip of an iron hand. He won easily, and we started a second
game.</p>

<p>This time I determined to give him no chance and, spurred by
the humiliation of my first defeat, embarked on a sound, steady
defence. But it was no good. He beat me just the same. He was
all round a much better player than I, and the subtle sense of
impending disaster that all chess players feel when the game
begins to lean even a hair's breadth against them again came to
me in the first dozen moves.</p>

<p>I was greatly astonished at his play, because any one could
plainly see he was not an educated man, and chess was certainly
one of the last games I should have expected him to be fond
of.</p>

<p>We played often after that first evening, so often, indeed,
that sometimes it became a real nuisance to me, and I wished we
had never become friends. He would play on for hours and hours
at night, and never seemed to want to leave off, keeping me out
of bed until two and three in the morning. Now and then, on one
plea or another, I wouldn't go near him for several days
together, but he was always so very glad to see me when I did
return that I used to reproach myself for my neglect and feel I
had done him an injury.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wacks," he would say&mdash;he was always scrupulously
polite to me, except when the brandy had got hold of him, and
then he commenced everything with a damn&mdash;"Mr. Wacks,
you're a gentleman to keep company with an old sailor man, but
I'll make you the finest chess player in Australia if you'll
only learn."</p>

<p>He certainly did, as after years have proved, make me an
unusually resourceful player, and he was always urging me, when
he got to know me well, to join the big Adelaide Chess Club, and
take part in matches.</p>

<p>I used always, however, to refuse, and excuse myself by
saying I was too nervous to play with strangers, and when he was
not feeling well or had been drinking heavily during the day my
excuses would rouse him to an awful fit of temper.</p>

<p>"You dirty little coward," he shouted to me once when we had
been discussing the moves of some game that had been published
in the local papers, and I had refused, as usual, to send a
challenge to the captain of the local club, "you could beat them
all if you dared, and had a spot of pluck in your lean, mingy
body. I know how strong I am and I know your play, and you're
not half a pawn behind me now. Good judges have told
me&mdash;good judges, mind&mdash;that I am almost a genius at
the game. Twenty years ago and there were few players that did
not meet their match in me, and me&mdash;only a rough sailor
man. Afraid of playing with strangers, eh? Why, many a time in
strange ports round the Mediterranean have I sat down in little
cafes to play with damned foreigners, who didn't know a word of
any language but their own, and who could only roll their eyes
and jabber 'We&mdash;we,' when I gave them mate on the move. But
you&mdash;you've not a grain of pluck in you&mdash;you're a
worm, sir, a worm," and he thumped and banged on the table so
heavily that I thought every moment Mrs. Bratt would rush in to
know what was happening, and what was the matter.</p>

<p>Yes, the old man's friendship was a bit of a trial sometimes,
and I often came to wish he had never spoken to me.</p>

<p>I have said he was my only friend, but there was
Lucy&mdash;Lucy Brickett. She was not exactly a friend, however,
for I was her devoted lover. I had got to know her at our little
chapel, where every Sunday she played the harmonium and led the
singing of the hymns. She didn't know I loved her, or, perhaps,
even admired her, for here again my cowardice damned me and I
hardly dared to say a word when she was present.</p>

<p>She was the younger of two sisters, and about twenty-two
years of age. Of medium height, and with a plump and well-formed
figure, she was undeniably pretty, with a soft and gentle face
and dove-grey eyes.</p>

<p>The harmonium at the chapel sounded old and wheezy when the
others touched it, but when she was playing there was no sweeter
music in all the world to me. It reminded me of the kingdom of
Heaven. Her face, too, I thought, was like one of the angels,
and the memory of her eyes was always with me when I said my
prayers. I never missed a service at the chapel, and, always
sitting where I could easily see her, regarded all Sundays as
the red letter days of my poor and lonely life.</p>

<p>Her uncle&mdash;oh, her uncle&mdash;was a very different type
of being. He was a fat, gross man, with big, heavy features and
a large, coarse face. He breathed very heavily and ate too much.
A confirmed drunkard in his younger days, a file-tongued doctor
had one day put the fear of hell into him, and he had never
touched a drop of liquor since. Of late years, he had become a
shining light of the prohibitionists, and he argued for them,
just as he argued for all his other beliefs, in a coarse,
pig-headed, and persistently narrow way. He never forgot his own
profit in anything, and things were good or bad, and right or
wrong, just as he was the gainer or loser in the
transaction.</p>

<p>He was a widower and kept a little general and cool-drink
shop on the Port Road, or rather, his two nieces kept it, and he
gathered in the proceeds. He never seemed to do any work, but
sat most of the day in a big well-cushioned chair behind the
counter, laying down the law and making himself generally
objectionable to his family.</p>

<p>Save that his two nieces were pretty and obliging, but little
custom would have come to the shop; as it was, however, they did
a fairly good trade, and of an evening especially plenty of
young fellows lounged and dawdled over sweet fizzy drinks to get
an opportunity of speaking to Lucy or her sister Maud.</p>

<p>I myself was often there, and sat either dumbly listening to
the laughs and chatter around or very occasionally joining in
and acquiescing with the bigoted assertions of the old man.</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;just so, Mr. Brickett," I would assent
hypocritically, "you're quite right; there's no getting away
from it there," and I would order another drink from Lucy, as an
excuse for lingering.</p>

<p>I think the two girls rather liked me, or at any rate were
pleased for their uncle to have someone to agree so whole-heartedly
with everything he said. Lucy always gave me a sweet
smile when I came in, and on hot nights always saw that I had a
big lump of ice in my tumbler. She sometimes, too, asked me
about the work in the office, and seemed then inclined to
sympathise with me and mother me in her soft, gentle way.</p>

<p>But her uncle always annoyed me, and I many a time longed to
tell him what an ass he was, when Lucy wasn't there. He had
absolutely no sense of humor, and was an awful bore.</p>

<p>One evening, coming home, I overtook him in the Port Road,
just opposite the Admiral Nelson, the chief hotel of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Look at them beasts there," he growled, pointing with a fat
and dirty finger to the saloon entrance, "look at them there
hogs a-going in and out of that booze door. Think of the money
they's a-spending&mdash;think of the money that might go on good
cool drinks. I've a line of squash as would keep 'em busy all
the evening&mdash;specially," and he winked knowingly at me, "if
a pinch or two of good salt was put in with it to bring out the
flavor."</p>

<p>I agreed with him, of course, and for my hypocrisy was a full
twenty minutes late for my tea.</p>

<p>He was quite a big man at the chapel, however, and clothed in
his black Sunday suit was not without a sort of ponderous
dignity. He was one of the deacons, and bawled and bellowed like
a bull when any of his favorite hymns were sung. He was a fair
contributor to the chapel funds, but serving most of the
congregation with groceries, as he did, the account in the end
was probably, I expect, not on the losing side.</p>

<p>He was a dreadful bully his nieces and tyrannised over them
in a way that sometimes made my blood boil. Often Lucy looked as
if she had been crying, and when I saw the load of trouble in
her gentle eyes I could have killed the old man for his
beastliness, though he never knew it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE POT OF RED PASTE.</h2>

<p class="first">ONE Saturday it unexpectedly rained all day
long, and after dinner Captain Barker, hearing from Mrs. Bratt
that I was at home, sent word to enquire if I would go in for a
game of chess.</p>

<p>I had had a very worrying week at the office, and would have
dearly liked to say "No," but I had no excuse ready, and so
meekly went in.</p>

<p>I thought the old chap was looking very ill, and I could see
at once that he had been at the brandy.</p>

<p>He was irritable and inclined to be rude&mdash;a sure sign
with him that he had started drinking. We began to play, but my
thoughts were wandering, and I played very badly.</p>

<p>I made two bad blunders, and the old man swore angrily at me
for my carelessness. I told him apologetically that I was not in
a mood for playing, and then in a sudden burst of confidence let
him know how things were going at the office, and that I was
almost daily expecting to get the sack.</p>

<p>He listened quite quietly to me, but with a sneer that
hardened and deepened as I went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little rotter," he jeered, when I had finished, "and
to think that I call you my friend. You little crawling
worm&mdash;you've not got the courage of a bug. Man alive, how
long are you going to put up with it? Can't you see just where
it's leading you to, and what a hell you're warming up for your
poor dirty little soul? Where's it going to end? What are you
always going to do? 'Rabbits' they call you, do
they?&mdash;well, don't you make any mistake, it's the rabbits
they insult&mdash;not you! Oh, you little swab!"</p>

<p>I was too miserable to feel the faintest twinge of anger, but
just leaned back in my chair, and dispiritedly regarded the
driving rain upon the window.</p>

<p>"Yes, you swab," he went on presently, seeing I was not going
to make any excuses, "and do you know I could alter it all for
you if I chose, yes, alter it at once. If you were worth it, and
I could trust you, I'd send you out of this room with fifty
times more courage even than I have. Fifty times more courage
than I have&mdash;do you hear that, sir, and me&mdash;me, that
in all my life's never been afraid of any man that's
lived&mdash;do you hear that, I say?"</p>

<p>Perhaps I looked incredulous or perhaps it was I smiled, but
the next moment he was pointing angrily to a large cabinet in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Open that door, you ass," he spluttered in his rage, "give
me out the black box on the bottom shelf. I'll show you
something, too, Mr. Rabbits&mdash;Mr. Bug."</p>

<p>The box I carried to him was about the size of a cigar box.
It was an ordinary looking wooden box without a lock or clasp,
and just tied round with a piece of dirty string.</p>

<p>The string was too knotted to untie, and the old man
hesitated for a few moments before cutting it with his
knife.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind not to show you," he went on musingly, with
all trace of his anger for the moment gone. "There's that in
here that once cost the lives of four good men&mdash;and it
might cost the lives of a good many more, if it got into wrong
hands. But there," he sneered disgustedly, "it's safe with you.
You'd want a bucketful before you'd ever dare to taste it. Oh,
you miserable coward."</p>

<p>He cut the string with a jerk, and, opening the box, took out
a small packet wrapped in a length of dirty green oilskin.</p>

<p>"Now, Wacks," he said solemnly, "it's eleven years and more
since this oilskins been unwrapped, and I don't know why the
devil I am unwrapping it now. I always swore I'd never touch it
and that I'd let it die with me."</p>

<p>He hesitated again, and then, taking a good gulp from the
glass at his elbow, unrolled the oilskin clumsily, and a little
brown jar rolled on to his knees. It was about the size of a
small condensed milk can; the mouth of it was tied over tightly
with a piece of greasy looking parchment.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not going to open it," he growled. "This is as far
as we'll go to-day anyhow."</p>

<p>He held the jar close up for me to inspect, and then, setting
it carefully on the table with his shaky hand, fell into a long
reverie that I thought best not to interrupt or disturb.</p>

<p>"Lord! how old I'm growing," he said, presently. "See the
date on it. I said eleven years, didn't I? Well, it's more like
twenty. Curse you, Wacks, I'm blasted sorry I ever disturbed it.
I'm nine years older than I thought&mdash;no wonder I feel
sometimes as if coffin time was come. Look here, my boy," he
went on again, but in quite a gentle voice, "I said I'd tell
you, and so I will, but it's a tale that won't do you no good,
and maybe you'll be sorry you roused me up to tell it at
all."</p>

<p>"Listen here. Twenty years ago, when I was master of the
'Willing Bird,' from Liverpool to Fremantle, I shipped a Malayan
as fireman at Marseilles. I was short handed, and had lost two
men in a gale off Finisterre. Well, this new man was just such
another as you. A little silly swine that let everyone curse him
and never cursed back. A man without a grain of pluck. Everyone
harried him from the first moment he came aboard, and he had a
rotten time. I couldn't stop it, for I wasn't everywhere in the
ship. They bullied him and knocked him about, just because he
was a blithering coward, like you, and let 'em do it. He never
once hit anybody back, and all he did was to threaten them with
something a cousin of his was going to do.</p>

<p>"'Me cousin at Colombo,' he would jabber, 'he gib me
something and me gib you hell den&mdash;see.' But all they did
was to jeer at him and give him more knocks. No one knew then
what he meant. Well, at Colombo he went ashore, and right enough
his damned cousin did give him something. He gave him this pot
of paste. Two days out from Colombo he ate a teaspoonful of it,
and in a couple of hours there was all hell aboard. Someone
started him, and in a second he was flying at everyone he met.
He knifed the quartermaster through the heart; then he stabbed a
deck hand who tried to catch him. Then he rushed on deck, and
put up an awful fight there. With everybody on him there was two
more stabbed before the mate managed to break his arm with a
marlinspike. Even then he fought 'em all like a tiger, and it
was only when he broke his back by falling down the forecastle
steps that we at last had him under control.</p>

<p>"The poor brute was quite conscious before he died next day,
and he told me all about the jar. It's a stuff the natives take
before they go into the jungle after tigers, and it makes a man
afraid of nothing in the world. Now you've heard all about it,
Mr. Wacks, and will you have a taste?"</p>

<p>His jeering tones had come back, and he held up the jar,
eyeing me with every expression of contempt. I shook my head
feebly, and he went on tauntingly.</p>

<p>"Not a little bit, Mr. Wacks. Just think what it would do.
You would go up to the office like a man&mdash;like a human
being, sir. Think how you would walk into those
chaps&mdash;think of the grudges you could pay back&mdash;think
how astonished they would be. Wouldn't their eyes bulge when the
blooming bunny showed his claw&mdash;wouldn't they gape to see
the blasted worm turning round at last! Oh&mdash;get out, you
little beast&mdash;get away from me, quick&mdash;I'm sick of
your putty face. Get out, I say&mdash;get out."</p>

<p>I got up hastily in real alarm. I had never seen the captain
in quite such a kind of rage before. His face twitched horribly,
and I thought he was going to have another fit.</p>

<p>I got to my own room as quickly as I could, and, throwing
myself upon the bed, gave way passionately to the tears of a
little child.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;how was it all going to end? As the old man had
said, it couldn't go on for ever, and what was I going to do?
The story he had told me hadn't interested me in the least. I
didn't believe it, and I didn't disbelieve it&mdash;I simply
hadn't taken it in. But his contempt had stung me somehow, and
his bitter tongue had cut me somewhere on the raw. I had never
felt so miserable and so hopeless before.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, turned out a fine and glorious day, and
I looked to the service in chapel to make up in some way for the
humiliations and worries of the week. But everything was against
me still, and before the service began I had yet another
horrible humiliation to get over.</p>

<p>As was my general habit, I had got early to the chapel, and
had just settled myself comfortably in my accustomed seat, when
I heard hurried footsteps behind me. Turning round curiously, I
found Lucy's gentle face, all flushed and animated, within a few
inches of my own.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come out, please, Mr. Wacks," she whispered quickly.
"Deacon Brown's horse is trying to bolt, and it's tied to the
railings. His mother's in the chaise."</p>

<p>I guessed what had happened at once. Every Sunday Deacon
Brown used to bring his old mother to chapel in the chaise, and
every Sunday he used to tie the horse up to the chapel railings
whilst he went over to the minister's house to have a yarn with
him before the service began. Then they would both walk over
together, and between them help the old lady out of the chaise,
and gallantly escort her up the aisle to her allotted seat in
the front pew. The horse was young and mettlesome, and was
always rolling its eyes and pricking its ears when anything
noisy went by. Everyone had said it would bolt one day, but the
deacon had always pooh-poohed and laughingly replied that it was
quiet as a lamb, and only showing play.</p>

<p>I ran out quickly and there was the brute as I had expected,
tugging viciously at the cord that held him to the railings,
prancing up and dawn and giving the old lady in the chaise a
very fair imitation of a steamer dipping in a heavy sea. I
looked round in horrible nervousness. There were plenty of women
and children round, but I was the only man to be seen.</p>

<p>"Catch hold of his head, Mr. Wacks," squeaked out an old
lady, vigorously brandishing a fearful looking sunshade right in
front of the beast's eyes, "catch hold of his head, Mr. Wacks,
and hold it low down."</p>

<p>Catch hold of his head, I thought. How could I get anywhere
near the beast, let alone catch hold of his head? His front legs
were pumping viciously up and down, and it looked sudden death
to me to go anywhere within three yards. I turned quite sick
with nervousness and stood stock still, feebly wondering what on
earth I was going to do.</p>

<p>"Catch hold of his head, please," plaintively called out the
white-faced old lady in the chaise. "He'll get away if you don't
get hold of him quickly."</p>

<p>Other people began to join in, and I could see contemptuous
glances being thrown from all sides in my direction. I stood
quite still, however, helplessly doing nothing, with the sweat
now all covering my forehead in small beads. Every moment it
looked as if the horse would break loose, and every moment I
became more and more convinced in my own mind that it was not an
occasion where I could successfully interfere. Let the beast
jump up and down, I thought. He'll soon get tired, and if the
rope holds on no one will be a penny the worse, and, besides, it
will be a good lesson to the deacon not to leave his poor old
frightened mother alone in the chaise again.</p>

<p>What would ultimately have happened goodness only knows, but
suddenly there was a rush and a shout behind me. I was knocked
down roughly into the road, and a man sprang over me to the
horse's head.</p>

<p>Almost in a second it seemed he had seized hold of the
bridle, and long before I had got on my feet he had secured the
brute firmly, and was gently soothing and patting it back to a
quiet state.</p>

<p>Something in the man's voice seemed familiar to me, and,
clearing my smarting eyes of dust, I saw to my disgust that it
was Waller. Waller of all people, to have witnessed my
cowardice. What a tale he would be making of it at the office!
What humiliation for me again tomorrow.</p>

<p>They all crowded round to thank him, and I saw old Mrs.
Brown, whom he apparently knew, introduce him to Lucy. Lucy
impulsively clasped his outstretched hand in both of hers and,
with her sweet and gentle face uplifted, said something that
wreathed his face in a broad, self-satisfied, and delighted
smirk.</p>

<p>My one piece of good fortune was that for the moment everyone
had forgotten me, and taking advantage of their absorbed
interest in the wretched Waller, I slunk away home, unnoticed
and unmissed.</p>

<p><br>
MONDAY was again a black day with me in the office, and I sensed
instinctively that things had come almost to a head.</p>

<p>In the morning complaint was made to me about the noise in
our room. A sarcastic message was sent in from the counting
house that, if we didn't mind, they would like sometimes to be
able to hear themselves speak.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. William had suddenly interrupted a game
of darts. From the interested comments of the room generally I
gathered that the game had just reached a most exciting stage.
Waller was 'two up,' but Muggins had still 'three to play.' The
firm's penholders made excellent darts, and with the end nicely
split to hold a steadying length of paper good hits were being
obtained upon the target, on the back of the country ledger.</p>

<p>Mr. William had not said much, but he had given me a quick,
stern look and I had shivered in my shoes.</p>

<p>That evening I returned home almost bowed down with grief. My
nerves were strung up almost to breaking point.</p>

<p>I had just reached the garden gate when Mrs. Bratt came out
of the hall door. She was red-eyed and had been crying.</p>

<p>"He's dead," she called out directly she caught sight of me.
"He's dead&mdash;poor old Captain Barker."</p>

<p>"Dead," I repeated numbly. "My God! When did he die?"</p>

<p>"Just after his dinner," she half sobbed. "He said he wasn't
well and would lay down a bit. I helped him to the bed and he
just fell back straight off and was gone. The doctor's been and
he's to be buried tomorrow. I'm going to see about it now. Oh!
Mr. Wacks, isn't it terrible&mdash;he's been with me over eight
years and I'll never have another lodger like him. I've put your
things all ready and you've only got to make the tea. I shan't
be gone an hour. I hope I haven't forgotten anything, but I'm so
upset I can't think of things properly," and she went off with
her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment or two I hesitated to enter the silent house. I
was as frightened of the dead as of the living, and the thought
of the dead body, all alone there on the bed, filled me with
horror. I tiptoed quickly through the hall and shut myself up
closely in the kitchen. I wasn't in the mood for any tea; I felt
too miserable for anything. Poor old Captain Barker. How many,
many nights I must have played with him and, on the whole, how
nice he had always been to me. It was only the brandy that made
him swear at me and call me names.</p>

<p>Poor old fellow, but what a lonely life his had been. Well,
he was dead now, and all his troubles were over. I wished I were
dead, too. Anything to get out of all my worry.</p>

<p>I would have gladly killed myself if I had known how, and
then my thoughts went in a flash to the little brown jar in the
box. What a strange tale it was he had told me! Could it by any
means have been true? He must have believed it himself, for he
had been in deadly earnest and all the time I had known him I
had never found him to exaggerate in anything. What if I had
taken a taste when he offered it me? What if I took some now? I
could feel my heart jump at the thought, and I had to stand up
to get my breath. Why shouldn't I at any rate get hold of the
jar? No one knew of its existence yet, except myself, and no one
need ever know. At any rate, I could get it now and think over
later about using it. But I must get it at once, whilst Mrs.
Bratt was out; later on I should have no excuse for entering the
old man's room.</p>

<p>Without giving myself a moment to reflect, and marvelling all
the time at my own boldness. I tiptoed stealthily into the
Captain's sitting-room and opened the cabinet door.
Yes&mdash;there was the box in the same place where I had first
seen it, but now it was not even tied with string. Trembling all
over, I thrust a shaking hand under the lid and, feeling the jar
in its oilskin covering, quickly transferred it to the depths of
my trouser pocket. Then closing up the cabinet again, I ran back
quickly to the kitchen, and there Mrs. Bratt found me when she
returned about a quarter of an hour later.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Wacks," she called out, "how dreadfully pale you
are. I'll have you going next if you don't take care," and she
burst again weakly into tears.</p>

<p>I got away from her in a little while, and by 9 o'clock, at
latest, went into my bedroom to get ready for bed.</p>

<p>I was just tired out and worn out, and only in half a mind
after all about tasting any of the paste. I unwrapped the jar,
however, and taking off the parchment cover curiously examined
its contents. It was dark red in color, and thick, like jam that
has set very hard. Almost automatically, I tasted a little with
my finger. It was rather sickly and had the strong flavor of
aniseed. I dipped in the handle of my tooth brush and brought up
what I thought was about a small teaspoonful. I hesitated,
perhaps for two seconds and then quickly put it in my mouth and
gulped it down, so as not to give myself time to consider or
repent.</p>

<p>I am sure now that I expected something to happen at once. I
know I stood still in a perfect smother of excitement with great
drops of perspiration running down my face.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, however, except that I felt rather sick. I
waited and waited, mopping my forehead with shaking hands,
hardly able to breathe for my emotion. Quite ten minutes must
have passed and my feelings turned partly to relief and partly
to disgust. What an ass I had been to believe all the old
Captain had said! I had made no allowance for the natural
superstitious credulity of all sea-going men and had now gone
and swallowed some beastly stuff that might have turned rotten
years ago and would probably give me fearful stomach-ache later
in the night.</p>

<p>I threw the pot angrily into the cupboard amongst my clothes,
and, very much disgusted with myself, undressed and got into
bed.</p>

<p>My head was aching terribly and I expected to turn and toss,
hour upon hour, before getting off to sleep.</p>

<p>But no, I must have dropped to sleep almost at once, for with
a most vivid recollection of even the remotest happenings of
that eventful night I can remember nothing more until when I
woke up just before the hall clock struck three.</p>

<p>I believe, indeed, I had had some heavy dreams in which
Waller and Captain Barker figured prominently, but, they left no
distinct waking impressions on my brain, and I woke to the howl
of Boulter's dog in the garden of the house next door.</p>

<p>I sat up instantly in a tearful rage.</p>

<p>What right had Boulter to keep such a brute out of doors at
night? Boulter himself might be as deaf as a post, but that was
no reason why everyone else in the road should be nightly
exasperated by the howling of his beastly cur.</p>

<p>I for one had put up with it long enough and would stand it
no longer. I would kill the brute, and I wouldn't care if
everyone knew it.</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed and hurriedly slipping on my trousers ran
into the hall.</p>

<p>I remembered a short iron bar that I had noticed once under
some papers on a shelf in the back kitchen, and I struck a match
and found it. It was part of the handle of a broken linen press
rotting outside in the yard, and it was curved and had a heavy
ball at one end. I thrust it down into my pocket and, opening
the hall door quietly, softly slipped out into the road.</p>

<p>Boulter's house was a corner house and honored with a back
door which opened into a narrow passage that led into the
garden.</p>

<p>I gambled on the back door being unlocked, and instead of
climbing over the fence, approached it from the road.</p>

<p>The noise of my approaching footsteps cut short the howling
of the dog and I could hear her shuffling down the passage to
meet me.</p>

<p>She growled menacingly as I came near, and to reassure her I
called her softly by name.</p>

<p>"Nell, old girl&mdash;good dog, lie down."</p>

<p>She knew my voice at once for I had often patted her in
passing and not infrequently she had come to our house for
scraps.</p>

<p>She stopped growling at once, and very gently I pushed open
the door intending to bash her with the iron directly I saw her
head appear. But she was too quick for me, for when I had opened
the door, ever so slightly, she slipped by me in a flash, and
was out and down the road before I could even aim at her with my
heavy bit of iron.</p>

<p>I swore at her retreating figure with a damn that came
easily, though strangely, to my lips, and seeing there was no
chance at all of overtaking her, turned back into her master's
back garden.</p>

<p>It was still dark, but a faint glowing in the sky warned me
that morning was not far off.</p>

<p>There was a nasty strong smell in the garden and my
disappointed rage found vent in more cursing. It was Boulter's
rabbits, of course.</p>

<p>What right had Boulter, I asked myself angrily, to keep his
stinking rabbits so near to other houses? With his dog and his
other dirty belongings he was a positive menace to the health of
the place. He should be taught a lesson anyhow.</p>

<p>I cautiously approached the row of hutches and, after looking
round to make sure no one was watching me, opened the door of
the one nearest, and feeling about for a moment inside, brought
out the inmate by its ears.</p>

<p>It was a fine big beast, and in the softly glowing light I
could see the glinting of two big, frightened eyes. But I had no
pity at all, and in a sudden paroxysm of rage nipped its body
firmly between my knees and broke its neck.</p>

<p>Making sure I had killed it, I put back the quivering body
into the hutch and, curling it in what I considered a natural
position for sleep, carefully reshut and fastened the door.</p>

<p>The animals in the next hutches I served in exactly the same
way, and in three or four minutes at most, seven of Boulter's
best rabbits were in the process of stiffening in their
houses.</p>

<p>I felt the lust of taking life intoxicating me like wine and
I should undoubtedly have finished off every rabbit in the place
but for the sudden noise of a distant train.</p>

<p>It startled me unpleasantly and thinking that at all events I
had done enough to go on with, I hurried stealthily back by the
same way I had come.</p>

<p>I closed the hall door very carefully and with hardly a sound
tiptoed to my bedroom and threw myself back into bed. Again I
fell asleep at once, but this time I had no disturbing
dreams.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE FIRST CRIME.</h2>

<p class="first">I WOKE up feeling very irritable and with a
bitter taste in my mouth. It was seven o'clock, and about the
usual time I awoke. I could hear Mrs. Bratt brushing vigorously
in the hall and my first thought was one of annoyance at the
noise she was making. Then all the events of the previous
twenty-four hours flashed through my mind and I felt out of
temper with everyone.</p>

<p>I would make them smart at the office for all their insolence
to me. Captain Barker deserved to die for being such an old liar
about his wretched red paste. Mrs. Bratt was a drunken old
charwoman, and I would clear out of her dirty show with a week's
notice. Boulter had only got his deserts and it was a pity all
his beastly old rabbits weren't dead, instead of a beggarly lot
of seven.</p>

<p>I dressed myself quickly and going out into the hall,
proceeded at once to give Mrs. Bratt a piece of my mind. I told
her, and in not over quiet tones either, that she was an
alcoholic old beast, and shouted to her, as she retreated
hysterically towards the kitchen, that I should be leaving that
day week. When she feebly remonstrated with me for speaking so
loudly and pointed reproachfully to Captain Barker's door,
saying, "Hush, hush," I got angrier still, and stamped noisily
about the hall, flourishing the dead man's walking stick that I
had taken from the stand.</p>

<p>I felt that I wanted to kill her, and had quite a difficulty
to restrain myself from doing her some injury.</p>

<p>She was quite thunderstruck at my rage, as well she might be,
for I had been always meek as a young calf before her.</p>

<p>I swallowed some sort of breakfast, and banging the door
behind me set off to catch my usual train up to the city.</p>

<p>The sun was shining gloriously, but it only roused my anger
with its promise of more heat and I felt ready to quarrel with
everything and everybody.</p>

<p>A big ugly looking dog was sunning himself on the footpath,
and I surprised both myself and him by sending him off howling
with a well directed kick in the ribs.</p>

<p>The usual last minute crowd was hurrying into the station as
I arrived, and I pushed and elbowed amongst them in a manner
that quickly reaped for me a rich harvest of black looks, but my
savage face and the complete indifference with which I received
their uncomplimentary remarks preserved me from molestation and,
the train steaming into the station, I threw myself sourly into
a corner seat and gave myself up to my own thoughts.</p>

<p>I was beginning to think that after all there might be some
virtue in the red paste. I felt quite different from the way I
did yesterday. I didn't feel afraid of anyone any more, and I
was just longing to injure someone at the office. But I told
myself I mustn't be too hurried and too eager in paying off my
grudges. I must be cunning and take advantage of my supposed
timidity to be revenged on everyone in their proper turn. I
musn't overdo it at first.</p>

<p>I reached the office in good time and could not refrain from
commencing the new era by straightaway giving the office boy a
slap on the face for being immersed in the pages of a book
instead of dusting the desks and filling the inkpots as was his
proper duty. He gasped at first, in mingled pain and
astonishment, but immediately recovering called me a damned fool
and prepared to show fight. But he was a small boy with all his
damns, and I was soon able to convince him that physically, at
least, I was easily his superior. Indeed, the generosity of my
violence took all the fight out of him at once.</p>

<p>I took the accustomed place in my corner and the other clerks
began to arrive chatting and passing laughing remarks to one
another as they hung up their hats and took their seats at the
desks.</p>

<p>Waller came in as usual, last of all&mdash;twenty-one minutes
after his proper time I noticed. I said nothing, however, to
anyone, and was apparently absorbed as usual in my work.</p>

<p>Waller exhibited no particular hurry to settle at his desk;
instead he perambulated about the room, flourishing a high-colored
sporting paper and informing the office generally that
he had a certain winner for the afternoon at ten to one.</p>

<p>"Fireball's bound to win," he exclaimed emphatically, "the
distance will just suit her and Nat Slogger's got the
mount."</p>

<p>It was the very chance I had been waiting for, and I stood up
at my desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waller," I interrupted icily, "this is not a betting
club. You work here at a salary for so many hours a week and I
notice you have already this morning cheated the firm of
five-and-twenty minutes of their time."</p>

<p>Waller looked at me blankly in a puzzled sort of way and
then, apparently becoming aware who it was had spoken, dropped
his jaw to an ugly sneer. Whatever retort he was about to make
was stayed, however, by the abrupt entrance of Mr. William, who
came in with some papers in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. William," I said at once in the same level tones that I
had used to Waller, "you requested me yesterday to report more
carefully on the conduct of those in this room, and I take the
opportunity now to inform you that Mr. Waller has only just this
minute arrived. He is twenty-five minutes late this morning, and
I may add he is rarely on any day at his desk within a quarter
of an hour of the proper time."</p>

<p>Mr. William seemed, I thought, rather taken aback at my
remarks, and looked as if he had to half smother a smile, but he
remarked grimly enough, anyhow, "Thank you, Wacks, I am much
obliged to you. Business is not very good just now, and we have
been thinking lately of dispensing with the services of two or
three gentlemen in this room. I shall, therefore, be glad to
know the ones we shall miss least," and then, beckoning to
Waller. "I'll have a word with you, my friend, if you'll please
come out with me."</p>

<p>"And something more, Mr. William," I went on calmly, "I am
not at all satisfied with Muggins here. His work has become very
slovenly lately, and nearly all the invoices he makes out I have
to re-do myself, because of the blots and mistakes he makes. I
understand he expects a rise at the end of this month, but I
would suggest, sir, that the firm hold it over until some
improvement be shown."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Wacks, I think it's quite a good idea. Now is
there anything more you would like to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I continued coldly, "I understand from remarks
here that more heats of the dart tournament are to be played off
this afternoon, and, if that be so, I am afraid I shall have to
ask you for more pens. You will understand, sir, that using the
nibs as darts rather spoils them for other kinds of work, and,
in consequence, I often find it difficult to carry on the work
of the office with the supply of pens and nibs that you allow
me."</p>

<p>I spoke quite quietly and without any particular feeling or
passion, but I hardly recognised my own voice, and seemed almost
to be speaking in a dream.</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so," replied Mr. William, again, I thought,
smothering a smile. "I can understand. Well, if any more pens
are required this afternoon for this tournament you refer to, I
shall be glad if you will send those participating in the game
to fetch them,"&mdash;very grimly&mdash;"I shall be glad to meet
them. Now, please come with me, Waller."</p>

<p>They went out together. Waller looking very frightened and
pasty faced, and for half a minute, at least, there was a dead
silence over our room. Then the storm broke, and their tongues
lashed out. Everyone seemed to have something to say.</p>

<p>"You sneak&mdash;you little cur&mdash;you blasted little
fool," were but a few of their remarks to me, but I looked round
indifferently, as if not interested, until one of them, more
practical than the others in their rage, threw a dirty and wet
duster at me from across the room.</p>

<p>The duster missed me easily, but the action instantly brought
my temper to a blaze.</p>

<p>A heavy brass paper-weight lay near me on my desk, and
seizing it up, quick as thought, I hurled it point blank at the
offender. It missed his head only by a hair's breadth, and
crashed through the wire protection of the window behind.
Nothing daunted, I followed it up immediately with a big lead
inkstand, which, missing again, broke in a panel of the door.
Then, having nothing further to my hand to throw, I seized up a
stool and brandishing it over my head made ready to at least
maim someone if anyone came on. But they were unnerved by my
violence, and stood with white faces at their desks.</p>

<p>They could see I was in earnest, and quite reckless of what I
did. The paper-weight I threw would have seriously injured Monks
had it hit him, and if the lead inkstand had found its mark it
would have smashed his face in like a drum.</p>

<p>They looked blankly at one another, and their violence seemed
suddenly to die down as I faced them. No one leading an attack,
they subsided gradually to cursing and black looks, and by the
time Waller returned, which he did in about ten minutes looking
scared and uncomfortable, the office was wrapped in an unusual
quiet.</p>

<p>Waller scowled menacingly at me, and was quietly informed of
what had happened in his absence. He pursed up his lips when he
was shown the strained wire netting, and he stared thoughtfully
at the broken panel of the door. Then&mdash;and somehow I felt
it at once&mdash;the impression got among them that I had gone
mad. They edged away from me, and I saw it also in their nervous
faces and averted eyes.</p>

<p>All the morning they sat uneasily at their desks, and if I
made any hurried movement in turning over the pages of my
ledger, everyone was on the look-out instantly. But it only
amused me and I went on with my work in the usual way.</p>

<p>At dinner time I went out and had half a pint of beer at the
'Southern Cross,' and I can see now the startled and amazed
looks on the faces of two of the clerks who happened to be
lunching at the same bar. I was known so well as a rabid
teetotaler and as one who had never entered a public-house. That
afternoon there was absolute quiet in the office, and at half-past
five they all melted away without any word of insolence or
rudeness to me.</p>

<p>I went home myself, in a queer mood of exaltation. I was
quite pleased with everything in general, and was smiling to
myself at the day's adventures.</p>

<p>But for all this I could feel a murderous temper only just
beneath my smiles, and knew that the very slightest crossing
might rouse me instantly to a pitch of rage. The people that got
in my way as I made for the train&mdash;the man who asked to see
my season ticket at the barrier&mdash;the woman who took up too
much space with her parcels in the carriage&mdash;and the paper
boy who shouted too loudly as he passed the carriage
door&mdash;all almost made me choke in fury. Under my pinched
white face, I was a seething volcano, and if they had only known
it, as dangerous to everyone I came in contact with as a man
with a bomb.</p>

<p>As I came up our street, Boulter was leaning over his front
gate, talking to Meadows, the detective. I should have passed
them by with a nod and 'Good evening,' but Boulter shouted to
me, in the way of those hard of hearing, and I had to stop.</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything last night, Mr. Wacks?" he bawled
thunderously. "Any suspicious noises outside the house at
all&mdash;because there was something happened in my
garden&mdash;did you hear anyone moving in the night?"</p>

<p>I shook my head as if pressed for time and wanting to pass
on, but he continued impressively. "Someone murdered my rabbits
last night&mdash;seven of them&mdash;seven of the best I ever
bred. All laid out stiff and still when I came out this morning
to feed 'em."</p>

<p>I felt the detective was eyeing me narrowly and I feigned
great interest at once.</p>

<p>"All your rabbits dead, Mr. Boulter!" I ejaculated. "They
must have had something wrong to eat."</p>

<p>Boulter snorted furiously. "Something wrong to eat, eh? All
seven of 'em with their necks broke and laid out as straight as
on the counter of a butcher's shop. Something wrong to eat, eh?
You're a fool, sir&mdash;another damn fool, sir."</p>

<p>It struck me at once what a liar the man was, for I
remembered how careful I had been to curl the smelly brutes up
in circles so as to make it look as if they had all died in
their sleep.</p>

<p>The detective interrupted Boulter's flow of abuse. "No noises
in the night, Mr. Wacks?" he remarked pleasantly. "No creaking
of the gate? Nothing out of the ordinary? But I suppose you
weren't awake. You didn't hear the dog bark by any chance?"</p>

<p>Nell came up to us as he spoke and began interestedly to
sniff about my legs. I remembered, with a pang of uneasiness,
that it was in those very trousers that I had gripped the
rabbits between my knees as I had broken their necks.</p>

<p>I shooed her off irritably, but she was most persistent, and
wouldn't go away until Boulter himself hit her angrily on the
back with a stick, and then she sat down a few paces off and
watched me with her bead on one side.</p>

<p>I made a mental note that she was dangerous, and that I must
serve her as I had served the rabbits directly I could find an
opportunity.</p>

<p>I answered the detective that I certainly had heard nothing
suspicious during the night, although my window had, of course,
been wide open the whole time.</p>

<p>Boulter calmed down a little then, and went into further
details. It was murder, he insisted, cold-blooded murder by a
scoundrel, and the strange part of it was his dog Nell had never
given any warning. She had been quiet all night (lie number two,
I thought), and had been found sleeping in her kennel just as
usual when he went out at half-past six.</p>

<p>He was determined to find out who had done it, and we might
mark his words, it would all come out one day.</p>

<p>I got away at last, and the detective, making my departure
the excuse, came along with me. "It's quite interesting about
those rabbits," he remarked musingly. "The whole thing seems so
purposeless to me. What should anyone want to kill Boulter's
rabbits for, unless they owed him a grudge, and, if anyone did,
who in their senses would go to the risk of entering his back
garden in the dead of night, killing seven rabbits and then
methodically returning them one by one to their separate cages,
and refastening the doors? It must have taken a lot of time, and
there was the dog there all the while."</p>

<p>I didn't pretend to hazard a guess, and together we entered
our house. Mrs. Bratt met us in the hall, full of importance and
wearing her best dress.</p>

<p>"His lawyer has come," she whispered excitedly. "I got his
address through the young man at the bank, and he is here now
arranging everything."</p>

<p>She had evidently forgotten the unpleasantness of the
morning, and was eager to enlist our interest in the dead man's
affairs.</p>

<p>But they didn't interest me in the least. Captain Barker
might have been dead for years for all I cared, and I went to my
room thinking least of anybody about him.</p>

<p>All teatime, it was Boulter's dog alone that occupied my
thoughts. She was a mangy beast, and it might be somehow found
out through her that it was I who had visited the back garden in
the night. She must be got rid of, and I determined to lose no
time, but to do it straight away that very night.</p>

<p>I knew the brute's habits well. In addition to that of
howling vilely at nights, there was another one, equally
objectionable to those who happened to be in the vicinity at the
time. In the summer months she was accustomed every evening,
about sunset, to frequent the banks of the Torrens River, just
below North Adelaide, and there, with a score or more of other
dripping beasts, to yelp and yell while certain two-legged
idiots threw sticks and stones into the water for their
edification and excitement.</p>

<p>I would interview her, I thought, as she was returning home,
and bash her quietly on the head in some convenient corner.</p>

<p>I set off just before eight with the iron bar in my trouser
pocket. Its curved shape made it quite easy to hide, and except
that it banged up against my leg when I walked quickly, it was
not inconvenient to carry.</p>

<p>I reached the riverside just about dusk, but to my
disappointment and rapidly rising anger I could see nothing of
Nell. There were plenty of other howling brutes there, but not
the one I wanted. Where was Boulter's beastly dog? I asked
myself irritably. She could always have been found here, night
after night, when no one wanted her, and yet tonight, the very
night she was wanted, something had kept her away. Perhaps
Boulter himself had locked her up after last night's affair.
Anyhow, I would get at her somehow.</p>

<p>I wandered irritably across the park lands with my hand ready
on my bar of iron on the off-chance of still meeting my
prey.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark by then, and I sullenly cursed my bad
luck. The footpath was quite deserted, and I took out my watch
to look at the time. It had stopped at half-past seven, and I
was furious. I had paid thirty shillings for it less than a
month ago, and this was the way it was serving me.</p>

<p>A figure loomed up towards me out of the dusk. It was a
short, stout man, and he was carrying his hat in one hand and
with the other was mopping a rather bald head with a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>He was puffing and blowing with the heat, and waddling along,
apparently in no particular hurry. I asked him, not over
politely, what was the time, but he shook his head vaguely and
grunted something that left me as ignorant as before. I repeated
my question, but he didn't take the slightest notice, and
continued to waddle on.</p>

<p>A paroxysm of fury burst over me, and I shouted after him
that he was a cad, but he still took no notice at all, and,
chattering now with rage, I ran after him and pulled him by the
arm. He turned round with a start, and with a frightened stare
on his white face, elbowed me roughly in the chest. I instantly
lost all control, and, whipping out my piece of iron as he
started to walk on, struck him twice over the head. He put up
his hands to protect himself, but I struck savagely again, and
he fell on the path without a moan.</p>

<p>I stood over him waiting, but he was quite still. I looked up
and down the path. Not a soul was near us, but I grew all at
once afraid. I literally shook with fear.</p>

<p>What if I were seen? It would be a hanging for me if the man
were dead. At any moment someone might come by along the path,
and I should be a lost man. I thrust the iron back into my
pocket, and, seizing the limp body by the collar, dragged it
heavily across the turf, away from the path. It was a heavy load
to pull, and less than fifty yards left me breathless and
exhausted. I took a moment's rest, and then, spurred on by fear,
dragged the body along again towards a little clump of
trees.</p>

<p>I stood up stealthily and looked round. There was nothing to
disturb me&mdash;only the flickering lights of the city and the
rumbling of some distant train.</p>

<p>My momentary feeling of panic left me as suddenly as it had
come, and I trembled now with a delicious feeling of excitement
to think of what I had done. I had killed a man, and the man had
richly deserved to be killed, for insulting and ignoring me when
I had asked him the time.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to be insulted any more, and if anyone
attempted to browbeat me, they must take the consequences. I
wasn't going to be caught either. It would always be a secret
who had killed this man, and I would gloat over the mystery I
had caused. What a tale for the papers tomorrow, and what an
interest I should get in reading all they had to say. But I must
be careful not to be found out, and must leave no trace
behind.</p>

<p>I took out the piece of iron that I had thrust back in my
pocket and rubbed it vigorously upon the turf to remove any
trace of blood that might be on it. Then, keeping my body low, I
quickly put two or three hundred yards between me and the man I
had killed before I again struck the path leading over the park
lands.</p>

<p>I crouched low for a minute to see if anyone was passing, and
then, finding the coast quite clear, broke into a quick walk
towards the city.</p>

<p>I made a good detour before going home, and reached my front
door just as the clocks were striking eleven. The only thing
that marred my complete satisfaction was running into Meadows in
the hall. He was inclined to be quite friendly and chatty, but
the encounter seemed rather to upset my nerves, and when I
finally got to my room I took out the jar of paste in a vague
feeling of recklessness, and helped myself to another
teaspoonful.</p>

<p>Then I got into bed and passed a rather restless night of
troubled slumber. I seemed to be dreaming and dreaming all night
long.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE DEATH OF POLICEMAN HOLTHUSEN.</h2>

<p class="first">WITH my first waking moments next
morning, I realised to myself that I had lost all moral sense,
and that my instincts had become frankly criminal. There was no
haziness at all in my mind about the events of the previous
evening, and I had not the slightest remorse for what I had
done. I had killed an elderly man on the park lands&mdash;a
perfect stranger&mdash;and the action seemed to me quite natural
and justifiable, under the circumstances.</p>

<p>I was not a bit surprised at having done it. He had been rude
to me, and killing was what he had deserved. I should do the
same to any others who offended me and it would serve them right
too.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't want anyone to know I had done it, for I
should then be punished and the form of punishment would
undoubtedly be that of hanging. It made me shudder a little to
think of being taken by the police and being put in a cell and
all that sort of thing; but I was quite certain I should never
be found out, and I thought with pleasurable anticipation how
intensely interesting the newspapers would now be.</p>

<p>There would be columns and columns about the murder, when it
was discovered today, and everyone would be wondering and
puzzling over what had taken place out there in the dark last
night.</p>

<p>And all the time I would be sitting quietly by myself,
reading all the articles and listening to what everyone
said.</p>

<p>How thrilling it would all be, and how little anyone would
dream or guess that it was I who alone could disclose who had
done it.</p>

<p>Despite a slight headache I dressed myself in a happy and
light-hearted mood, and went in to breakfast.</p>

<p>I was rather puzzled to know what to do with the bar of iron,
but ultimately, after assuring myself it was quite clean, I
returned it boldly, in Mrs. Bratt's temporary absence from the
kitchen, to its old place, under the newspapers, on the pantry
shelf.</p>

<p>I went up to the office in a state of subdued excitement, but
I noticed I was not feeling nearly so irritable and had more
control over myself.</p>

<p>The other clerks were fairly quiet all the morning, and
contented themselves with whispering and tapping their foreheads
significantly, when they thought I wasn't looking at them. The
remarks of Mr. William the previous day, about certain
contemplated dismissals, had evidently frightened them a good
deal, and they were all afraid of being reported to him in his
present mood.</p>

<p>I knew I should have to wait until lunch time for any news I
might hear. Waller always went out first, and at twelve to the
second, he put on his coat.</p>

<p>He always chose the early hour, because then he used to meet
a bookmaker at the bar of some public-house and consistently
back horses that never seemed to win. The other clerks went out
later, but my regular time was one o'clock, and I had no excuse
for altering it.</p>

<p>Just before one I heard Waller talking loudly in the passage
just outside our door. It sounded as if he had some exciting
news.</p>

<p>In a flash of a second, I suddenly became sick with fear. My
heart thumped like a piston and I bent low over the desk to get
my breath. It was the crucial moment, I thought. The crime had
been discovered and I felt suddenly that my secret was not as
secure as I had hoped. Everyone in the office knew that I lived
in Bowden, quite near to the park lands by the river. If I
showed undue emotion, they would at once be curious about me and
perhaps suspect me. They might then search the house and find
blood somewhere on my clothes. The microscope, too, might reveal
blood-stains on the bar under the papers on the pantry shelf and
all&mdash;all might be found out.</p>

<p>Terror rushed through me like a wave and I crumpled up.</p>

<p>"Look here, you chaps," called out Waller excitedly, "I've
just met a man I haven't seen for years and he tells me to back
Hoop-la in the three-thirty today. He says it's been kept
expressly for this, and will win by about half a street. I'm
going to have a dollar on it, and if anyone likes to chip in
they can, but it's ready money down, you know."</p>

<p>I cursed myself deeply for an ass and, like a reprieved
criminal, furtively wiped my dripping forehead on my sleeve. Of
course, I should never be found out, and after all what would it
matter if I were. They could only hang me at the worst. My
courage returned to me as quickly as it had departed, and I
walked out of the office with my head in the air, only curious
now to find out if anything were known.</p>

<p>King William street seemed just as usual, and I heard nothing
to interest me while I was having my lunch. I gave myself plenty
of time and it was well over the allotted hour when I started
back to return to the office. I was just turning into Pirie
street when, happening to look up, I noticed there was a flag on
the Town Hall flying half-mast high.</p>

<p>I was mildly curious and stopped to ask a policeman the
reason why.</p>

<p>"Alderman Bentley's dead," he said curtly&mdash;and then with
a grin, "but I don't suppose he's left you any money,
sonny."</p>

<p>I looked at him coldly, annoyed that he should show no
respect and that his manner should be so familiar. Then I
thought it must be because my clothes were badly cut and shabby.
I stopped before a looking-glass in a tailor's shop window, and
took good stock of my general appearance. No&mdash;I wasn't bad
looking, I told myself. I had what people always were wont to
call a 'nice' face; my complexion, however, was white and
sickly, and my mouth too small and sensitive for a man. But my
clothes&mdash;oh, how sloppy and shabby they looked. I got hot
with shame as I noted the ill-fitting collar and the baggy
knees. No wonder people sneered at me and had no respect.</p>

<p>I felt quickly in my pocket&mdash;yes, my pocket-book was
there and I knew there were six one-pound notes inside.</p>

<p>I walked into the shop, and speaking as indifferently as I
could, asked to be measured for a suit. The man eyed me
curiously, but produced a book of patterns for me to choose
from.</p>

<p>I selected one, the same kind of cloth that I had seen our
Mr. William wear, and the man told me it would be five guineas.
I paid three pounds on deposit and was promised it should be
ready in three days. I also bought half-a-dozen collars of a
fashionable shape and a smart looking heather mixture tie.</p>

<p>I reached the office nearly half an hour over time, and was
stared at inquisitively by every pair of eyes. The men whispered
among themselves, but no remark was made. I thought to myself
with a sneer how like rabbits they all were.</p>

<p>"Rabbits," they had always called me readily enough, and with
the same contempt that sporting men have for the courage of that
animal, they had always regarded me, and yet whenever anyone
threatened them ever so little&mdash;only the few quiet words
from Mr. William that he was going to send some of them
away&mdash;they were all cowed to nothing at once, and bolted to
their holes in a body, just like a field of rabbits when the
farmer's boy appears at the gate.</p>

<p>Bah! how I despised them and with what a vengeance was the
boot now on the other foot.</p>

<p>It seemed a wretched long time that afternoon to half-past
five, and many times I thought surely the clock must have
stopped. The room was very quiet, however, and save for the
gloom of learning from the office by about half-past four that
Waller's wonderful horse had lost&mdash;and with it had gone
fourteen shillings and sixpence of the office money&mdash;the
monotony of the afternoon was unbroken.</p>

<p>Five-thirty, however, came at last, and at the corner I
breathlessly bought a copy of 'The Evening Journal.'</p>

<p>Yes, here it was, all there this time, and just as I had
wished, with big headlines on the front page:&mdash;</p> <pre>
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY ON THE PARKLANDS

ALDERMAN BENTLEY BLUDGEONED TO DEATH

MURDER, NOT ROBBERY, THE MOTIVE OF THE CRIME A FOUL DEED IN THE
DARK HOURS OF THE NIGHT. </pre> <p>I was thrilled with pleased
excitement. So it was really known at last, and now would
commence all the queries and conjectures that follow on such
deaths. Detectives would search over every inch of the spot and
the reporters from the newspaper would go down. They would
unravel and discuss. They would take photographs and make
sketches, and all sorts of rumors would get about. I should read
everything and thoroughly enjoy it all. It would be just like
sitting in some dark corner of a theatre all by myself, with the
lights out everywhere except on the stage, and watching the
players play out a play, entirely for me.</p>

<p>Fancy, too, it being Alderman Bentley&mdash;I had always
heard of him as a very rich man&mdash;one of the richest in
Adelaide.</p>

<p>Well, he shouldn't have been rude to me. He was only a man
just as I was, and simply because he had money he had no
business to think he was a different kind of human being to me
and could just ignore me and thrust me away when I asked him the
time.</p>

<p>I didn't feel sorry at all.</p>

<p>Going home in the train everyone was talking about it, and I
lay back in the corner with my eyes half-shut, thinking dreamily
what a poor weak thing civilisation was after all, and how
easily&mdash;how very easily&mdash;everything could be upset by
a white-faced, baggy-trousered clerk and an insignificant little
piece of useless iron.</p>

<p><br>
AFTER tea I went to see Lucy. Somehow I felt quite different
about her. A week ago she had seemed a far-off vision to be
gazed at and dreamed of at a distance, but to-night I wanted to
put my arms round her and press her to me. I wanted to feel if
her lips were soft. I wanted to hold her tight, and to tell her
that I was going to be her master. I wanted to make her blush
when I looked at her, and I thought of how one day she would
close her eyes and sigh when I tipped up her chin to kiss.</p>

<p>I put on my new tie carefully and, snipping a white rose from
one of Mrs. Bratt's best trees, walked confidently round to the
shop.</p>

<p>For a wonder the place was empty when I arrived, and it was
Lucy herself who came out of the back room to serve me. She
looked tired and sad and there were shadows under her pretty
eyes. She smiled nicely, however, when she saw who it was, and I
pulled a stool close up to the counter. "Bless my soul, Miss
Lucy," I said confidentially, "but you do look tired tonight.
Don't you feel well?"</p>

<p>She gave me a little quick look of curiosity&mdash;noticing,
I was pleased to see, my new tie.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you, I'm quite well. It's only the heat has
given me a headache. We've been very busy to-day."</p>

<p>"You're working too hard," I went on. "That's what it is, and
I suppose your energetic hard-worked uncle, as usual, has done
the lion's share of the work."</p>

<p>She smiled prettily, showing a sweet little dimple that I
longed to examine closer and to kiss.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think uncle's overdone himself to-day, at any
rate!"</p>

<p>"Someone ought to tell him off," I said angrily. "He puts far
too much on you two girls."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you do it, Mr. Wacks?" and she looked at me
in a shy, amused way. "You always agree so well together."</p>

<p>"Oh," I smiled shamelessly, "that's only to keep on good
terms with him so that I can come round here and look at you.
Good gracious! You don't think, surely, that I believe a quarter
of his silly ideas, do you? You must think me a soft.
Yes&mdash;I'll tell him off tonight&mdash;see if I don't."</p>

<p>She looked at me strangely, but said nothing, as two more
customers at that moment entered the shop.</p>

<p>I took out a cigarette and commenced to smoke. Some more
people arrived, and Lucy was too occupied to return to her
conversation with me.</p>

<p>I watched her hungrily all the time. What pretty rounded arms
she had, and how bewitchingly the soft curves of her bosom
showed up through her dress. Her skin, too, was like ivory and
her hands, with all her work, were pretty and well shaped.</p>

<p>What an ass I had been, I thought. Here was no cold spirit
creature with the frail and sacred beauty of another
world&mdash;but a loving earthly woman, with all the impulse and
the longing of her sex&mdash;a woman to be kissed and fondled
deliciously by the lucky man who would one day possess her.</p>

<p>Old Brickett came in grunting, and broke through my agreeable
train of thought.</p>

<p>He waddled ponderously to his chair and saluted the company
generally, in what he always considered to be the strict
military manner. Before he had got too fat he had been one of
the local fire brigade and, as he was never tired of telling us,
strict military discipline had been the order of the day.</p>

<p>"Evening, Brickett," I said casually. "How's the cool slop
trade to-day? Been busy in the pickles and tea, eh?"</p>

<p>He looked round sourly to make out who it was had addressed
him so disrespectfully and, seeing it was me, he frowned in a
puzzled sort of way.</p>

<p>He mumbled something, however, in reply, and then, turning to
Beaks the butcher, at once started an acrimonious discussion as
to the respective merits of their different places of worship,
and the varying degrees of influence of the pastors who had care
of their souls. Beaks was Methodist New Connection, and we were
Strict Baptist. Beaks banked on the new man who had recently
come to take over their chapel, and old Brickett was strong on
our chap&mdash;the Reverend Michael Pitchfellow. The arguments
soon became very fierce and I wanted to butt in.</p>

<p>"Look at our man!" almost shouted old Brickett
presently&mdash;"look at the good he's a-doin' here&mdash;look
'ow he's making people think. Look 'ow the takings of the pubs
is going down. Why, only last week I 'eard as 'ow the owner of
the 'Wattle Tree' 'ad told the income tax man as 'ow all his
profits was agoing to the dogs, and that he oughtn't to be
paying 'alf as much as he did last year. Now that's because of
our chapel, sure; the influence is a-gradually beginning to be
felt and in a year or two anything may happen. Now what I say
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tosh," I called out loudly, unable to keep silence any
longer. "Tosh, sir, tosh! Who the blazes has ever heard of our
chapel out of this street, and who the blazes would take any
notice of us if they had?"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence when I had spoken and everyone
looked hard at me. The old man himself simply gasped in
astonishment. That anyone should interrupt him in such a manner
at all, and that I of all people should dare to put in my spoke
when he was laying down the law, appeared to him to border
almost on the incredible. He looked at me very sternly.</p>

<p>"Wacks&mdash;Peter Wacks, was you speaking then, to me?"</p>

<p>"Well," I answered arily, "who the devil else should I be
speaking to? You were the only one talking rot, weren't
you?"</p>

<p>A titter went round the shop at this and everyone stopped
whispering, to enjoy the unexpected passage of arms. I was so
well known to them all as the meekest and most slavish supporter
of the old man, that to hear me now contradicting him as I was
surprised them as much as it did him. It was in the nature of a
treat, of the enjoyment of which nothing must be lost.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," said old Brickett slowly and ponderously after
a while, "do you mean as our chapel is rot and the Reverend
Pitchfellow what you call tosh?"</p>

<p>"I never mentioned Pitchfellow, did I? But if you ask me I
tell you straight there's precious little in his preaching any
time. A shouter, I grant you&mdash;a bonzer shouter any
day&mdash;but a good preacher&mdash;no. Many's the headache I've
had off him, when he's turned the tap well on, but as for any
good ideas or new thoughts&mdash;well, he's no John the Baptist,
as everybody knows."</p>

<p>Brickett looked sourly at me "Then why do you come to the
chapel at all?" he asked bitterly.</p>

<p>"Why do I come to the chapel? For the same reason that I come
here, and I leave you to guess it."</p>

<p>I looked round laughing as I spoke, and old Brickett, thrown
out of his stride as it were, could not for a moment think of
any reply. But his self-confidence was too colossal for him to
keep silent long, and in a minute or two he had turned a baleful
eye again in my direction.</p>

<p>"I go to chapel," he said heavily, "for the same reason as I
don't go to pubs&mdash;for the sake of example."</p>

<p>"Blow your example," I sneered mockingly; "the cheek and
vanity you've got. Do you really believe, Mr. Brickett, that
you're so important that anybody's going to wait before they do
anything until they see what you're going to do?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer and I drove in my argument.</p>

<p>"Do you really think now, that there's one single person in
all South Australia who, if he thinks he wants a glass of beer,
will wait before drinking it until he finds out about
you&mdash;what you're going to do?"</p>

<p>"Yuss I do," frowned old Brickett, now looking uncomfortably
in a corner. "Yuss, I do."</p>

<p>"I suppose," I went on mockingly, "he'll hold up the glass of
beer and smack his lips and then say&mdash;'No, no&mdash;I
mustn't drink it until I find out what Matthew Brickett's going
to do.' Something like that, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so free with your Bricketts, young man; put the
Mr. on before," snarled the old man feeling this time on safer
ground. Then screwing up his eyes curiously:&mdash;"What's the
matter with you, Wacks, tonight; is it beer or just cussedness
what worries you?"</p>

<p>"Neither, but I'm just fed up with people talking about their
examples, that's all. It's just blessed conceit and nothing
more."</p>

<p>This time the old man didn't deign to answer me, but, turning
his back contemptuously, started talking about the murder to
another customer who had just come in.</p>

<p>I asked Lucy for another lemon-squash and in taking it from
her took care that our fingers should meet. She looked up as I
expected she would, and just gave me a little quick glance of
enquiry&mdash;quick and fleeting only, but sufficient to rouse
in me the delicious hope that there might be now the beginnings
of some sweet and subtle bonds of sympathy between us.</p>

<p>I stopped until quite late that night and interfered in and
argued about every subject that came up for discussion. I tied
up old Brickett fine, and crossed and contradicted him upon
every possible occasion. In the end he got quite nervous about
me, and gave expression to no opinions without apprehensively
cocking his eye in my direction to see how I was going to take
them. A big bully, I could see he would soon get really
frightened of me, and in my own mind I was determined to use
that fear to make things easier for Lucy and her sister, for
Lucy particularly, of course. When I at last got up to go, I
tossed him a curt goodnight, but for Lucy I reserved a glance
the very giving of which made my heart thump heavily and caused
my pulses to throb in a way they had never quite throbbed
before.</p>

<p><br>
THE next day I began to feel myself getting rather anxious and
depressed, and directly I got home, before having any tea or
anything, I took a good dose of the paste. The effect was
apparent in me almost at once, and towards dusk I set out with
my bar of iron to have another go at Nell. I had taken a violent
dislike to the dog, and was determined to pay her out for
sniffing at my clothes the other evening.</p>

<p>I went up round North Adelaide, and this time approached the
park lands from quite a different direction. The walk took me
longer than I had thought and it was almost dark when I struck
the path where I had met the old man the other night. I realised
disgustedly that I was too late for Nell, and irritably set
myself to walk back the shortest way home.</p>

<p>I remembered I should have to pass the very spot where I had
struck the old man down, but it didn't trouble me in the least,
and I was only just mildly curious to see if anyone would be
about.</p>

<p>The night fell rapidly almost to pitch dark, and walking
slowly along the path I suddenly almost ran into a policeman,
coming from the opposite direction. I could feel him give me a
hard stare, but slightly quickening my pace I passed on. About a
hundred yards farther on I remembered there was a fair-sized
ditch just off the side of the path, and arriving there I
slipped quietly down and hid myself under the bank.</p>

<p>I was interested that any policeman should be there at that
time of night, and I smiled grimly to think that they should be
now patrolling the park lands, two nights after the murder had
been committed. Did they think, surely, I said to myself, that
the murderer would be coming back there tonight? Then I
remembered with just a suspicion of uneasiness that I was
carrying about with me the incriminating bar of iron. It would
never do for me to be caught, of course, I thought, but at the
same time I was not in the least afraid. The excitement was
distinctly enjoyable, and a thrill of impending adventure ran
pleasurably through me.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard slow cautious footsteps in both
directions&mdash;unmistakably policemen's footsteps. They
stopped almost directly opposite to me, and a muffled
conversation took place.</p>

<p>"Idiotic stunt this, Bill; why the deuce we've been put on
it, nobody knows."</p>

<p>"Rotten, Henery," replied a second voice, "but the Chief
swears the bloke is certain to come back&mdash;he says they
always do."</p>

<p>"Rats! I'll bet he's much too frightened to come anywhere
near&mdash;but what did you make of that chap who just came
along? I was a bit hazy about him myself&mdash;that's why I
turned back."</p>

<p>"What chap&mdash;there's been no one by me at all."</p>

<p>"Not a white-faced looking Johnny&mdash;walking with his
shoulders rather hunched up&mdash;not three minutes ago?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul's come along since it got dark. He must have
turned off over the grass somewhere. Why didn't you pinch him,
you goat? At any rate, it would have been a fine excuse for
getting out of this. But come back with me&mdash;we'd better
tell the sergeant now."</p>

<p>They moved off, talking quietly, and in a couple of minutes
or so I glided softly after them, crouching low down. But not a
sign of them could I see, and not a sound could I hear anywhere,
both policemen seemed to have completely vanished.</p>

<p>I went forward about a hundred yards, edging all the time a
little farther away from the path.</p>

<p>Suddenly the big chimney of the Kilkenny bottle works flared
up in the distance, right in front of me, and in the flash of a
second I saw I was walking bang into as pretty a little ambush
as one could have wished. The flare only lasted as long as a man
might comfortably count five, but it was long enough for me to
see three heads all close together silhouetted against the
sky&mdash;and the heads all wore helmets, too. Even as I watched
with startled eyes, the heads on either side melted gently away,
leaving the middle one motionless, but with the alert expectant
pose of a man who listens and watches.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I, too, found my wits at once and turned quickly
round to see if there was anyone stalking behind me.</p>

<p>Fool, fool, no wonder I had been seen&mdash;there were the
lights of all Adelaide behind me and every movement of mine must
have shown up plainly against the sky.</p>

<p>It was well for me that I knew every inch and undulation of
the ground. Many and many a morning had I tramped over these
same parklands on my way to the office, and it would be standing
me in good stead now.</p>

<p>I threw myself prone to get out of the way of the light and,
wriggling myself into a fold of the ground that was fortunately
only a few yards away, doubled like a hare up the hill.</p>

<p>I heard no sound and I made no sound.</p>

<p>When I had run for about two minutes I pulled up for breath,
and then thinking I would like to know more of what was going on
where I had left the policemen, made a wide circle so as to get
right behind them. This time I determined the light from the
city should be on my side, and not on theirs.</p>

<p>I made cautiously to about where, I thought, I should find
them, but to my disappointment all was still and silent as the
grave.</p>

<p>Crouching breathlessly upon the ground, my hand came suddenly
in contact with a fair sized stone, about the size of a small
orange. Disappointed at the apparently tame termination of my
adventure, and in a spirit of mad devilry, I balanced it
carefully in the palm of my right hand, and without much thought
hurled if suddenly in the direction of where I knew the railway
line must be. My sense of direction was very true, for the stone
pinged loudly upon one of the wires of the fence running along
the permanent way.</p>

<p>The result was startling. Within a bare radius of fifty
yards, four or five electric torches instantly flashed out, and
there was the shout and scuffle of men racing down to where the
stone had struck.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," a voice shouted, "he's crossing over the
railway line. One of you cut him off by the signal box."</p>

<p>But I was not concerned with what they were doing. A much
more startling thing had happened, closer at hand. Right under
my very feet, a policeman had sprung up. So close to me had he
been lying, that the wonder was I had not trodden on him when I
had stood up to throw the stone. He, too, flashed his torch, but
I saw him the fraction of a second before he saw me. He shouted
something hoarsely and made to catch me with his hands, but I
got in first and struck him furiously with the iron. He went
down crash, and overbalancing myself, I fell after him. But I
was up again in a second, and, finding he made no movement,
passed my hand hurriedly over him for an automatic. But I was
disappointed, he hadn't one; there was a whistle, however, which
I at once took.</p>

<p>I made a rapid survey of the situation. His cry had evidently
been heard, for someone was now shouting to the men to come
back. My escape across the line was obviously cut off and also
the way behind me, on the road. There was no help for it but to
sprint up the hill to the terrace at North Adelaide. I didn't
like it, for it was quite probable other people up there might
join in the chase, and at any moment, too, the North Adelaide
police might also appear on the scene. Stupidly omitting to
switch off the fallen policeman's torch, I started to run my
hardest up the hill. I had not gone two hundred yards, however,
before hoarse cries of anger brought home to me what my omission
was likely to cost me. They had found their comrade, and worse
still could clearly guess now in which direction I had
bolted.</p>

<p>A shrill whistle sounded below, and it was at once answered
by one on the Port road, and by one near Bowden station,
too.</p>

<p>I should now be headed off for sure, I thought. I glanced
back hastily. By the flashing of their torches, I could see my
pursuers had spread themselves out with about thirty yards
between each of them and were systematically beating over the
ground, up the hill.</p>

<p>They were determined, I could see, not to let me slip by
them, rightly arguing that my likeliest way to safety would be
back over the railway line.</p>

<p>Almost spent, I breathlessly gained the wire fence against
the terrace on the hill. In scrambling over, however, I slipped
badly and gave my right leg an awful wrench.</p>

<p>For a moment the pain was simply excruciating and it was as
much as I could do to keep myself from falling down. I knew at
once it would be quite hopeless for me to move for a little
while, and I began desperately to rub the injured limb.</p>

<p>I looked down the line. The four policemen were steadily
advancing, flashing their torches from side to side to cover
every inch of the ground, and all the time whistles seemed to be
going in all directions.</p>

<p>I gave myself up as lost.</p>

<p>Suddenly a boy came riding down the terrace on a bicycle. He
slowed up and got off when he saw me. I pulled my cap low down
to hide my face.</p>

<p>"What's up, guv'nor?" he asked, taking in the whistling and
the lights as something quite abnormal to the place.</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied offhand, with the first words that came into
my mind, "it's a paper chase. I've won and we're whistling to
call off the hounds. I was the hare, and we've run all the way
this evening from Glenelg." The boy, from his attitude, was
obviously impressed.</p>

<p>Then an inspiration seized me, and I went on quickly. "Look
here, sonny, just be a sport and help me, will you? I'm dead
beat here, and can't run a stitch. Take this whistle and ride
down to the end of the terrace there and blow like blazes. You
can keep the whistle for your trouble," and I thrust the whistle
I had taken off the policeman into his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir," he said eagerly; "yes, I'll go."</p>

<p>"That's right, my boy," I called out heartily as he at once
swung on his bike, "and when you get to the end there&mdash;just
ride down the hill to the post office and blow hard all the
time. I'll walk down slowly and if you've called them all in
before I get there, there'll be half a dollar for you when I
come, see?"</p>

<p>He disappeared joyfully at full speed.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, a perfect tornado of whistles broke out on
the air. Loud, long, sustained whistles&mdash;screeching
whistles&mdash;short, sharp whistles&mdash;whistles that spoke
of urgency and whistles that would make anyone groan for even a
second's delay.</p>

<p>The policemen's torches stopped advancing instantly and then
upon a hoarse order all wheeled round at right angles and in the
faint light I could see quite half a dozen burly figures tearing
off in the direction of my timely young friend and his
bicycle.</p>

<p>I was saved for the present, anyhow.</p>

<p>My leg felt much better and I hobbled across the road with no
clear plan, however, as to where I should go, But my good star
was still in the ascendant.</p>

<p>As I reached the corner of a rather narrow by-road, I saw a
huge, big lorry lumbering down. A brain-wave seized me. It would
have to slow up at the corner to get round and I would catch
hold and hang on behind.</p>

<p>But better luck still was in store for me. Not only did it
slow up, but the body was open and not high off the ground. I
jumped desperately as it passed and the noise of my impact among
the few empty tins that it carried was drowned happily in the
scrunching of its brakes.</p>

<p>The whistling was still going on, and I chuckled to myself as
happy as a king.</p>

<p>I was not quite as happy, however, about half an hour later,
when stiff and sore I slipped off the back of the truck at the
railway gate near Port Adelaide Station.</p>

<p>It was the first opportunity I had had to get off. I caught
the last train back to Bowden, and arriving home just before
midnight was disgusted to find the detective, Meadows, smoking
by the garden gate.</p>

<p>He shook his head jestingly when I passed him, and made some
remark about the growing bad habits of young men, but I said
goodnight curtly, and shut myself in my room, devoutly hoping he
had not noticed my bedraggled and ruffled appearance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE ROUSING OF THE CITY.</h2>

<p class="first">OF many of the happenings of the ensuing
weeks I remember nothing at all. Memory is merciful to me and
there are blanks and blurs that no thought nor brooding can fill
in.</p>

<p>The time of terror for the city lasted, I know, eleven weeks
and two days, and horrors unspeakable were the almost daily
menace of men's lives.</p>

<p>But, in the knowledge of what happened later, there can be no
doubt that these crimes were not all mine. My own deeds were
many and vile enough, I know, but that is no reason for me being
saddled with the blame for those I did not do.</p>

<p>I am making no excuse for myself, but simply trying to
explain the dim hope to which I always cling that, one day, I
may not be called to answer for all the things that are now put
down to me.</p>

<p>I make no pretence that I remember nothing. I remember hazily
a lot of dreadful happenings in the night. It was always in the
night, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>I remember bodies stretched out on the dark roads. I remember
struggles on paths when there were no stars. I remember blood on
a verandah once and in a room, the very memory of which makes me
shudder even now. I have a dim recollection, too, of something
happening to the Melbourne express as it came down through the
hills. I remember a tram crashing down over a bridge near the
city, and I remember, later, the flare of many fires.</p>

<p>But so many things are mixed up in the night life of those
days that I can never properly sift the dreams from the
realities. Thoughts come and go bewilderingly through my
tortured brain, but there is always the deep sense of horror to
abide and remain.</p>

<p><br>
I HAD three distinct personalities in those days and led three
different lives. None of them seemed to encroach upon the others
overmuch.</p>

<p>First, I was the clerk at Winter and Winter's; the head clerk
in the invoice office, and, as the weeks went on, a real head
clerk, too. I kept them all in order now and the room was quiet,
orderly, and well conducted. I took to keeping myself very much
to myself, and never mixed with any of them or discussed
anything out of business routine. Rarely, I permitted myself to
smile. I had become a cold sort of machine. Suave, polite, even
to Waller, but firm, very firm, and entirely devoted to the
interests of those who employed me.</p>

<p>One day, when I was shaving, I noted my expression in the
glass. I had altered a great deal. My eyes were harder and had
lost that gentle look, my lips shut closer together, too, and
there was a firmness about the corners of my mouth that was not
there in other days. I looked sterner, and, altogether, there
was that about me of a man who had acquired confidence in
himself and had little regard for the opinion of others.</p>

<p>I dressed quite differently too. I was smart and well-attired.
I wore well-cut clothes and collars that were
fashionable, and was most particular, too, that my trousers were
neatly pressed with the crease straight down the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. William, I could see, was quite interested in the change,
and when he had called me into his office alone upon some
invoice matter would sometimes chaff me about it.</p>

<p>"What's become of you, Wacks," he said one day, "you quite
puzzle me. You're so different to what you used to be. Are you
in love?"</p>

<p>"I may be, sir," I replied demurely, "but it's not that that
makes me different. I realised I was too soft with the men and I
did just what you told me, that's all, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I am very glad you did, Wacks," he went on genially.
"Do you know, I was just on the point of telling you that you
must leave us, when you suddenly cleared everything up."</p>

<p>"I knew you weren't pleased with me, Mr. William, and that in
the end spurred me on."</p>

<p>"Well, all's well that ends well, Wacks, and it's quite nice
to see the order and quietness you've got the men into."</p>

<p>Then there was the other man in me&mdash;the man in love.
Life was telling its great secret to me now, and sometimes my
happiness was almost too great to bear. Heaven had opened a
far-off lattice for us and a golden ray was falling on the dingy
little shop on the Port Road.</p>

<p>I forgot everything when I was with Lucy. I loved her
passionately and believed she loved me too. I had felt her
tremble in surrender when I had put my arms about her, and had
heard her sigh when I bent down to kiss. I had seen the love-light
in her eyes when I came near, and had felt the quickening
beatings of her heart when the sweet, soft body came in close to
mine.</p>

<p>I was always tender to her, but somehow I was always stern.
At first in my determined open wooing I had sensed impending
trouble with her uncle, but I had soon convinced him whose was
the stronger will.</p>

<p>One day I thought Lucy had been crying, and catching old
Brickett alone a little later, I taxed him with it. He didn't
deny it; but just glared sullenly at me.</p>

<p>"What's that to do with you, Mr. Nosey Parker," he began
contemptuously, but he stopped very quickly when he saw the
devil he had roused.</p>

<p>I reached over the counter and grabbed him quickly by the
cloth he wore round his neck.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't you move, Brickett," I hissed, "don't move,
don't lift your hands and don't answer back. I'm not a fighting
man, as you know, but, by gosh, if you make me strike
you&mdash;I'll bash you so that no one'll know you, except by
your clothes. You hulking dog," I went on shaking him backwards
and forwards in my rage, "you let me see that Lucy's been crying
again and by all there is in hell, I'll lay you out as stiff as
anyone's been laid out in Adelaide in all these days."</p>

<p>He got very white and shaky, but didn't say a word in reply,
and I let him go. I had put some fear in him, however, and after
that evening I had no difficulty in seeing Lucy whenever I
wanted her; indeed I was allowed to do exactly as I pleased.</p>

<p>The old man always pretended to ignore me when he saw me, but
I often caught him watching me curiously when he thought I was
not looking.</p>

<p>Then there was my third self&mdash;the MAN at night. A beast
lurking by lonely corners and in dark roads. A ghoul feasting on
horrors and the smell of blood. A furtive, baleful shadow,
creeping by silent pathways and where no lights were. A madman
chattering to himself&mdash;a creature reckless of discovery and
danger and yet&mdash;a wretch of infinite resource and cunning.
A man who thought and planned&mdash;a man who played his moves
as in a game of chess.</p>

<p>It was night only that put murder in my heart. By day I had
no lust for blood. The drug I took just made me confident, so
that I was not afraid of things or people. Also, I could control
myself, and if I wanted to keep my temper well in check, I
could.</p>

<p>But in the dark I was a different man. Directly night fell
and I had taken the evening dose of paste that I was now afraid
to leave off, an irresistible longing seized me to take life. To
kill someone swiftly&mdash;to see him fall, and then to slink
away in silence, were all happiness unutterable to me, and made
of no account the attendant risks and dangers I might have to
face.</p>

<p>The strange thing about it all to me was that my three
personalities were not much interested in one another and,
unless a common danger threatened all of them together, they
were not much concerned with what one another did.</p>

<p>When in the evening I was courting Lucy, for instance, I
never gave a thought to my crimes by night, and when I was
slinking along in the dark with my heart full of murderous hopes
I gave no thought to Lucy.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it seems that I lived all my life then in
compartments.</p>

<p><br>
LESS than ten days after the old Captain died I was the best-
wanted man in all Australia. I was on all men's tongues and in
all men's minds.</p>

<p>I had horrified and shocked the community as it had never
been shocked before, and there was no disguising the fact that a
sort of panic had set in.</p>

<p>The night life of the City of Adelaide was practically at a
standstill and, even then, the inhabitants sat shuddering behind
locked doors.</p>

<p>The police were blamed everywhere for their supineness, and
nobody now had any security in their protection.</p>

<p>One evening I was near Bowden station when I noticed a crowd
by the station gates. A short stout man was haranguing the
people viciously from the giddy elevation of an empty soap box
and I gathered, as I had surmised, that my crimes by night were
the theme.</p>

<p>He was not a very eloquent speaker, but he was a very earnest
one, and in his stodgy way he brought home to his hearers what
little had hitherto been done by the authorities to render the
environs of the city safe for pedestrians after darkness had set
in.</p>

<p>He had been hard hit, he told us, and didn't know how he was
going to live. He kept a billiard saloon in Bowden.</p>

<p>"Who's a-going to come out?" he shouted to us indignantly.
"Who's a-going to come out o' nights and probably get their
heads all broke for a game of billiards? Who's a-going to risk
it, I says? How can you expect 'em?"</p>

<p>Somehow his misfortune struck a chord of compassion in me and
I suddenly found myself sorry for him. There seemed nothing
incongruous to me about this, for, after all, I thought, what
fools the police were. Why hadn't they been able to catch me?
Why hadn't they, with all their organisation and their unlimited
resources, been able to get the better of a poor weak and
friendless clerk?</p>

<p>My indignation worked me up to a fine fit of temper and the
billiards proprietor in due time finishing his speech with an
emphatic "damn," I immediately jumped up on to the box.</p>

<p>Like the previous speaker I fell foul of the authorities at
once, and gave it to them hot and strong. The police were fools,
I said&mdash;blind fools and the whole civic administration of
the city was rotten. In any emergency they at once went off
their heads. They were children in their understandings and old
women in their ways.</p>

<p>"What have they done for us?" I cried. "They have taken away
our liberties and have given us not even safety in return. We
mayn't buy a reel of cotton or a packet of envelopes after six
o'clock. We mayn't have a glass of beer when we want to. Yet
with all their coddling over little things&mdash;with all their
annoying and unnecessary interference with our rights, they
can't even guarantee to us that we may go out for a simple walk
at night and not get a crack on the head as we pass down some
main road or turn some quiet corner. It's disgraceful, I say.
What are the police doing with their time then? You may well
ask!</p>

<p>"Look at tonight's paper&mdash;seventeen motorists fined for
exceeding the speed limit in King William street! Just fancy,
seventeen awful criminals brought to the bar of justice for this
dreadful offence, and yet&mdash;no mention in the paper of any
arrest of the one man who is making this beautiful city of ours
unfit to live in. How long is this going on and what are we
going to do? We ought to take the law into our own
hands&mdash;we ought to set about protecting ourselves. We ought
to form our own special police from among ourselves. Every
suburb and every township ought to have its own vigilance
society, so that we can go about in safety as we have a right
to."</p>

<p>I made a good rousing speech with plenty of fight in it, and
the crowd well punctuated my remarks with "Hear, hears," and
cheers.</p>

<p>Directly I had finished there was an excited burst of
clapping and the billiards man bobbed up again earnestly to
implore his hearers that my advice be followed. He there and
then offered to lend his saloon for an indoor meeting, straight
away.</p>

<p>A moment's hesitation and we all followed him to his place.
We crowded in, about forty of us, and on the strength of my
speech I was immediately voted to the chair.</p>

<p>I had, of course, never in my life taken the chair at any
gathering before&mdash;not even at the little potty committee
meetings connected with the chapel, but I had often noted and
admired the dignity with which Mr. Stunts, the hay and straw
dealer, was wont to preside over the annual meeting of the
chapel chess club, and I took my cue from what I remembered of
him.</p>

<p>I rapped the table loudly for silence, and opened with a
short speech, but one very much to the point. The responsibility
of being in the chair sobered me not a little, and the fierce
abandon of the speech outside was lacking.</p>

<p>But I gave them plenty to think about and made them realise
at once that the formation of a vigilance society meant work. I
told them if we once started on the project we must keep it up.
We must not make fools of ourselves and become the laughing
stock of the regular police. We must divide our district into
proper areas, particular men must be alloted to each area, and
every road must be patrolled and have help at call, at any time
between dusk and midnight.</p>

<p>I called for volunteers at once, and twenty-two responded on
the second.</p>

<p>Things moved in avalanche fashion then. A subscription list
was opened to defray expenses, and I grandly headed it myself
with a guinea. We formed a small committee and the meeting was
adjourned until the next day, in order to give us time to get
handbills printed and make our project generally known.</p>

<p>The next evening the saloon was simply packed, and, arriving
only just on time, I had great difficulty in making my way
in.</p>

<p>The sweets of office came to me for the first time.</p>

<p>"Room for the chairman," shouted Wiley, the billiards man,
"room for Mr. Peter Wacks," and the interested crowd at once
gave way to let me pass. Some of them started a friendly cheer
and I smiled easily to them in return.</p>

<p>I was wearing my new suit of the same cloth as Mr. William's,
and knew that I looked well. Lucy's eyes had opened wide to see
me in it, and her gentle face had flamed with pleasure when I
had called in on my way down to tell her what was on.</p>

<p>The meeting was a huge success and there was no denying that
I had the audience well in hand, from first to last.</p>

<p>The blood of some long-dead statesman ancestor must have been
stirring in my veins, I thought, to give me the dignity and the
presence that I knew I showed. I was completely at my ease the
whole evening. I made a happy and convincing speech and was
never for a moment at a loss to know what to say. The words came
tripping to my tongue every time I spoke, and I could work my
hearers up to long continued cheering just whenever I chose.</p>

<p>I was masterful, too, and irrespective of their importance or
otherwise, made every speaker keep strictly to the point.</p>

<p>It was arranged that a deputation should wait on the Premier,
and, of course, it was I who was told off to be spokesman.</p>

<p>I got in touch with the Minister at once, and the following
evening we were sympathetically received by the great man at his
private residence.</p>

<p>He asked us very politely what he could do for us, and I laid
our case emphatically and convincingly before him. I didn't
mince matters either. I told him flatly that the public
generally had quite lost faith in the ability of the police to
protect them.</p>

<p>Either, I said, the police were not capable enough or not
numerous enough. He smiled here, but I went on crushingly that
it was an open secret in the city that they had practically had
the assassin once in their hands, but had let him slip through
their fingers.</p>

<p>The Premier pulled me up at once here with a pretty
assumption of surprise, and asked me, very sternly to tell him
when, exactly, this slipping through had occurred.</p>

<p>"On the night of the second murder," I replied, quite
cocksure. "On the night when Policeman Holthusen was murdered on
the park lands. He was killed within a few yards of his
comrades, and if there be any truth in the rumors that have got
about, the police were there in force on the very spot all the
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't believe all you hear, Mr. Wacks&mdash;that
would never do," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't, sir, for one minute," I rejoined, "but I know for a
fact that at one time there were at least a dozen of the police
quite surrounding him, and yet he got away"&mdash;then,
remembering what I had heard the policeman say when I was hiding
in the ditch, I added coolly, "But you can easily verify it,
sir&mdash;Inspector Watkins was in charge."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't argue it with you, of course, Mr. Wacks, but
now leave the police alone, please, and tell me specifically
exactly what it is you want us to do."</p>

<p>I told him that we thought we could help the authorities.
That we thought the need justified it, and that we wanted to be
enrolled as special constables, and properly sworn in.</p>

<p>We wanted whistles, badges, and truncheons to be provided for
us, and we wanted generally to be regarded as a special
auxiliary arm of the regular police.</p>

<p>He heard me through patiently, thanked us kindly for the
trouble we had taken, and then dismissed us very politely,
promising to think the matter over, and let us know the result
when he had consulted his colleagues.</p>

<p>I wasn't at all satisfied with the result of our interview,
and bluntly told my committee so.</p>

<p>"He doesn't mean to do anything," I said. "We shall get a
polite refusal in a day or two. The only thing is to go forward
with our own plans."</p>

<p>It happened just as I said it would. Less than twenty-four
hours later I received a polite communication from the Premier.
He had conferred with his colleagues, he wrote, through his
secretary, and they considered the regular police had the matter
well in hand, and he regretted, therefore, he was unable to
comply with our request. He again thanked us, however, for our
zeal in offering our services. I snorted in contempt.</p>

<p>In the meantime something of our interview had got into the
newspapers, and prominence was given to my remarks about the
police.</p>

<p>The public generally were on my side, and I found no lack of
supporters in my own particular district. I am at all times a
good organiser, and with the help of three or four energetic
members of the committee, had soon begun to get things in
order.</p>

<p>In a week my arrangements were all complete and, from the
minute night had fallen we had every road and street in our
neighborhood under proper and adequate control.</p>

<p>I made this known in a letter to the newspapers, and I
boasted that our cordon was now so close that not even a mouse
could leave or enter without its becoming known.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner of Police silently accepted my
challenge, and two nights later three of my patrols espied
Detective Spratt hiding in a ditch. Greatly to his disgust they
dragged him forcibly to the guard room we had established in the
billiard saloon, and he was not allowed to leave until they had
sent an inspector from the Police Head-quarters in Victoria
Square to identify him.</p>

<p>It was a delicious moment for my quickly assembled committee
when the irate police inspector arrived. He was quite livid with
rage, but he said very little, and just bustled his discomfited
henchman into the car and rattled way.</p>

<p>I took care that the whole affair got into the newspapers,
and great amusement was caused in the city by the publication of
the details. 'The Evening Express' was very sarcastic, and the
headings to its paragraphs were most funny.</p>

<p>'Wacks on the War Path' was one, and in smaller type
underneath, 'The Vigilantes Arrest Detective Spratt in a
Ditch&mdash;Wacks Scores Again.'</p>

<p>The officials at headquarters did not love us by any
means.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; AT THE RACES</h2>

<p class="first">ONE Saturday I took Lucy to the races. It was the
first time we had been out for the day alone, and my heart beat
with excitement when I called at the shop for her.</p>

<p>Old Brickett had said nothing when I told him where we were
going. He had just shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, as if
to imply we were both well on the way to the dogs, and then
turned his head away.</p>

<p>Lucy looked supremely pretty in her white dress. I dare
say&mdash;in fact, I am sure&mdash;it must have been a very
cheap dress, for she had very little money&mdash;but whatever it
cost, it just suited her to perfection.</p>

<p>She looked so bright and happy, too, with the eager happiness
of a little child. Her face was greatly flushed, and her eyes
shone brightly, and every line of her supple body spoke
unmistakably of youth, pleasure and love.</p>

<p>Of course, she had never been to any races before. Races were
quite contrary to all chapel tradition, and in my own mind I
wondered mildly that she had acquiesced so willingly when I had
asked her.</p>

<p>I meant to enjoy the afternoon for sure. I had taken twenty
pounds out of the Savings Bank, and privately had determined to
have what the detestable Waller always called a flutter.</p>

<p>The races were at Morphettville, and we went down first
class. A man opposite to me started talking about the
afternoon's programme to me, and to Lucy's manifest amazement I
seemed to know as much about the horses engaged as he. I had not
lived for five years with Waller for nothing. All the jargon of
the turf was familiar to me. I knew about horses 'winning by
streets,' or 'being down the course,' and 'running like pigs.' I
knew about them 'getting off' badly from the 'gate,' or
'poaching a flying start.'</p>

<p>I knew that when 'the money was on' the brutes ran like
blazes, but when 'Johnny Strongarm' was in the saddle the
wretched backer always lost his money. I knew a lot about the
horses and their owners, too. I knew that Kitty's Darling was a
terror at the gate, that Blacktoes couldn't stay a yard beyond
six furlongs, and that the owner of The Boss was a first-class
racing crook, who deserved to get six months.</p>

<p>Much of this varied and miscellaneous information I then
passed on to my greatly interested vis-a-vis. He was a genial,
simple sort of soul, and in return implored me not to forget to
back Rosyfingers in the second race.</p>

<p>Arriving on the course, it was strange that almost the first
man I knocked up against was the owner of The Boss himself. He
was a well-known racing man, Bob Hales by name, and I had good
reason to remember him. He was a member of the City Council and
a butcher by trade. The day following a letter of mine to the
newspapers, someone had prompted him to phone up our firm and
ask them if my interference in public matters was done with
their approval. He had hinted that my reflections on the
capacity of the police, and the authorities generally, would not
tend to advance the interests of the firm of Messrs. Winter
&amp; Winter themselves. Fortunately. Mr. William had answered
the phone and all friend Bob had got had been a nasty snub for
his pains.</p>

<p>I had not forgotten him, however, and had made a mental note
of his address.</p>

<p>He was generally regarded as a real racing crook, but a very
clever one too&mdash;so clever that no one had ever been able to
bring him to book for actually crossing over the line.</p>

<p>He had quite a respectable racing stable, but always ran his
horses, win or lose, wholly to please himself. If he himself
wanted them to win they invariably ran well, but if he didn't
want them to they always ran nowhere. He was well served by a
jockey of the same kidney&mdash;a very clever rider, but one
notoriously to be nobbled for a price, and no doubt old Hales
always paid him well.</p>

<p>The public were always interested in his horses, for some of
them were the best in the State, but they were always very
uncertain about backing them, because they could never tell
exactly when they were out to win.</p>

<p>Time after time the public had plunged heavily on them, and
then&mdash;they had run, as Waller said, "like pigs." A week or
two later, when they were almost friendless in the machine, they
would score easily and return heavy dividends&mdash;fifteen and
even twenty to one.</p>

<p>No one seemed ever to know who were the lucky investors on
these occasions, but it was generally agreed that old Hales had
managed it somehow. The bookmakers were afraid of him, too, for
several times, with all their caution, they had been badly
burned by taking on his bets.</p>

<p>Just now everyone was interested in his horse, The Boss, down
to run that afternoon in the Cup. Three times in succession had
the public backed him recently, and three times had they come
down with a thud. Only a fortnight back, old Hales had made a
great show by ostensibly putting fifty pounds on at the tote, as
well as making several private bets at Tattersalls Club in the
city.</p>

<p>The public had tumbled head over heels to get a slice of the
good thing, and The Boss had carried more money almost than all
the other horses put together.</p>

<p>But the beast hadn't won. It had just ambled along and died
off to nothing when the pinch came.</p>

<p>Old Hales had sworn a lot at the jockey and trumpeted
everywhere what great sums he had lost. He had also talked of
giving the horse a long rest before racing him again.</p>

<p>But apparently he had thought better of it, for he was now
running him again this afternoon, notwithstanding that rumors
were being industriously spread about that he was suffering from
rheumatism in his hind legs.</p>

<p>All this I had learned from hearing Waller talk about it at
the office. Waller just hated Hales, for many were the half-crowns
he had lost in backing his horses when they were not, as
Waller found out afterwards, intended to win.</p>

<p>This, then, was the man I noticed as Lucy and I were coming
on to the course. He was a big, stout man, with shaggy eyebrows
and a big red face.</p>

<p>He was standing idly watching the crowd pass through the
turnstiles. Suddenly I saw him wink knowingly at someone close
behind me, and I turned round just in time to catch the faint
answering smile on the face of a tall, thin man, in a sort of
faded orange-colored crash suit. I shouldn't probably have taken
the slightest interest in the matter if the thin man, seeing me
turn round, hadn't instantly cut short his smile and passed Bob
Hales with a calm, impassive face, as if he didn't know him at
all.</p>

<p>What's going on here, I thought, and then I remembered
something else Waller had said once&mdash;stung probably to
bitterness by the loss of some good half-crown.</p>

<p>"The only way," he had told the office then, "the only way to
find out the old blighter's real intentions with his damned
horses is to become a blooming angel and shadow him all day.
Then we should find out, but perhaps only at the last moment,
what the old scoundrel really meant to do."</p>

<p>"Good," I said to myself, "I'll keep my eye on you, my
beauty, and it'll be easy, too, with your friend here, because
of his highly-colored crash suit."</p>

<p>I took Lucy round to the totalisator and explained to her the
wonderful way in which the amount of any money invested on any
horse is immediately recorded on the face of the machine, in
full view for everyone to see.</p>

<p>It was not my first visit to a racecourse&mdash;I had paid
one furtive visit on a Saturday a fortnight back, and thanks to
the depravity of the life of the wretched Waller and to my own
good memory in remembering most of what he had said, had soon
got into the hang of things generally.</p>

<p>I invested five shillings in the first race. I backed The
Barge because Lucy said his number was seven on the card and it
was the seventh day of the month. But the coincidence didn't
click, and I remonstrated with Lucy tenderly that, generally
speaking, it was a rotten way of acquiring wealth.</p>

<p>In the next race, I remembered what my genial friend in the
railway carriage had said about Rosyfingers. She looked a pretty
little horse to me, and, as Lucy was greatly taken with her
jockey's colors&mdash;French grey, rose sleeves and cap&mdash;I
thought her worth an investment.</p>

<p>Looking up at the totalisator, I saw she was a good second
favorite and being well backed.</p>

<p>I walked over towards the long row of pound ticket windows
intending to take a ticket there, but passing on my way the one
single window where the five-pound tickets only were obtained, I
happened to glance inside.</p>

<p>To my astonishment, I recognised the tickets operator there
as one of the clerks of the Adelaide bank where Winter &amp;
Winter had their account. I had often chatted with him when I
had gone in on business for the firm.</p>

<p>I thought it would be great fun to astonish him for once, and
quite indifferent to my probable loss, approached the window and
boldly demanded a ticket for number nine.</p>

<p>"Great Scot," he ejaculated, as he handed over the ticket,
"it's you, Wacks, backing in fivers, is it? Well, I'm
damned."</p>

<p>"Oh," I laughed airily, "I like a flutter occasionally on a
good thing."</p>

<p>We climbed up to the back row of the grandstand to watch the
race. It was a hot day even for Adelaide. Well over a hundred
and five degrees in the shade, it was a beautiful dry heat. A
heat that stimulated and did not depress. A dry, clear air that
shook the stiffness from one's bones and gave a sense of
lightness and exhilaration to all one's movements.</p>

<p>The gay scene below us was one of bustle and
excitement&mdash;of brightly flashing colors on all sides, of
happy, smiling people walking to and fro, of proud, slender-loined
thoroughbreds prancing and curvetting in the beauty of
their life and strength, and, back of all, of the long, low,
purple hills, shimmering away into the distance where the blue
sea touched the sky.</p>

<p>The band was playing "O Sole Mio," and the soft, entrancing
melody stole up to us and mingled sweetly with our thoughts.</p>

<p>We hardly spoke at all, but just sat silently drinking in the
beauty and ecstasy of everything.</p>

<p>To my great joy and to Lucy's no small amazement, Rosyfingers
came bustling home all on her own. She paid &pound;4 2s. for
each pound invested, and I drew &pound;20 10s. for my &pound;5
ticket.</p>

<p>The next race was the cup, and I at once bethought myself of
Mr. Bob Hales, the crafty owner of The Boss.</p>

<p>I found him right enough, just where I expected&mdash;in
front of the tote. He was watching the figures going up with a
stony and impassive face. A few yards from him, but apparently
quite a stranger to him now, was the man in the orange-colored
crash suit, the man I had seen him wink at earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>Now what were they up to, I wondered, but I guessed pretty
well. Bob Hales was watching the totalisator to see if it were
worth his while to let The Boss win. If the public put their
money on the animal sufficiently to make the dividend likely to
be a small one after the race, then, of course, he wouldn't back
it, and it wouldn't win. But if the public had got tired of the
wretched beast and didn't put their money on, and consequently
the dividend was going to be a large one, then&mdash;I
reckoned&mdash;he would throw a hundred pounds or so into the
tote at the very latest moment, and The Boss would then run for
all he was worth.</p>

<p>He would, of course, have to give the signal somehow to his
jockey, so that the latter would know what he was expected to
do.</p>

<p>But I wasn't the only one watching the wily Bob. Not a few
sharp-looking gentlemen were hovering furtively round to see
what he was going to do, and throw in their money, too, if he
made any movement to the tote.</p>

<p>The minutes went quickly by, and very little money was going
on The Boss. He was number one on the card, and it was plain to
see that the public generally were fairly sick of him at
last.</p>

<p>Five minutes before the race was due to start not a hundred
pounds out of a total of over five thousand was credited under
his name.</p>

<p>The start was taking place almost to front of the Derby
stand, and suddenly Bob Hales, after mopping his forehead
vigorously with a conspicuous-looking red handkerchief, turned
sharply round and pushed his way towards the railings near to
where the horses were lined up.</p>

<p>Good! I thought, he has made up his mind at last, and gone
off now to let the jockey know in some clever pre-arranged
manner exactly what he has to do.</p>

<p>But what about the gentleman in crash? I watched
interestedly. He was evidently the master key, but be had not
moved, and he had made no sign. He was just carelessly watching
the tote figures in a mild, uninterested sort of way.</p>

<p>Again I tried to fathom their minds. Of course, he was
waiting for the starting bell to ring. There was always, I knew,
two or three minutes' interval between its ringing and the
actual starting of the race, for it was not until the bell had
rung that the starter commenced to line up the waiting horses in
their proper order, according to the positions they had drawn at
the barrier.</p>

<p>The bell clanged at last, and, as I had expected, my
gentleman moved off leisurely towards the five pound window of
the tote. Good, again, I thought&mdash;I, too, would participate
in the good thing.</p>

<p>I elbowed in before him&mdash;through the now quickly
thinning crowd&mdash;and reached the window with him only just
behind. There were three or four still in front of me, and, of
course, only one was being served at a time. The tote window was
narrow, and we had to file up each in our turn.</p>

<p>The tickets seemed to be being dealt out very slowly, and my
temper rose at the delay. Then an inspiration seized me. The
start might take place any second now, and then bang down would
go the window automatically, as the starting tapes went up.</p>

<p>What if I could baulk the man behind me and prevent him
getting his money on! I looked quickly down behind me. He was
holding an unfolded hundred pound note in his right hand.</p>

<p>I whistled to myself. Whew! What a have. A hundred pounds at
about fifteen to one.</p>

<p>The man began to get anxious.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, you goats there," he shouted angrily over my
shoulder; "brisk along, or we shall be here all night&mdash;do
you hear?"</p>

<p>The two men remaining in front of me turned round frowningly
to see who had called them goats, and my friend behind the
window leaned round to see who was making the fuss.</p>

<p>"All right sir, all in good time," he called out; "we shan't
be long now."</p>

<p>At last my turn came, and I had thought what I would do.</p>

<p>"One on number one," I drawled slowly, winking solemnly and
jerking my head towards the man behind.</p>

<p>"One it is," replied the clerk grinning, and he slowly
clicked the machine and passed over the ticket.</p>

<p>"Another on number one," I went on as slowly as
before&mdash;"another and another."</p>

<p>"Curse you, you fools&mdash;be quick&mdash;damn you, don't
you hear?" and the gentleman in crash, losing all patience at
last, thrust a large and dirty hand on to my shoulder and made
to push me away.</p>

<p>"Twenty tickets on number one," he shouted, "quick, or you'll
be too late late&mdash;quick, quick."</p>

<p>I was in a fearful temper at once and sent him sprawling with
a sudden vicious blow on the chest.</p>

<p>"Damned fool yourself," I cried threateningly as he picked
himself up. "No, don't you come near me, or you'll get worse
than that, my friend. Who wants your filthy paws on them, you
beast&mdash;keep clear of me, I say."</p>

<p>The scuffle had attracted instant attention from the crowd,
and a number surged round to enjoy the row.</p>

<p>A policeman happened to be handy, too, and pushed his way
authoritatively to where we stood.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked sharply. "What's it all about?"</p>

<p>The ticket clerk strained his head out of the window and
explained. "The tall man was insolent and wanted tickets out of
his turn. He started the trouble, and it's all his fault."</p>

<p>"Any charge?" asked the policeman, beginning to take out his
book.</p>

<p>"Not from me," I answered contemptuously, and started to
adjust my coat collar that had got turned up in the scuffle.</p>

<p>"Well, you be careful," jerked the policeman sternly to the
man in crash, "or I'll lock up you," and he moved off
majestically through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Twenty tickets on number one," almost shrieked my late
opponent, rushing frantically up to the tote window.</p>

<p>"Twenty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A fearful shout from the crowd. "They're off," and the window
banged down sharply in the fellow's face.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood stock still in baffled rage, and then,
with a very white face cut off towards the owners' stand.</p>

<p>"He's going to tell old Hales," I chuckled gleefully, and
then I remembered, not without regret, that my little adventure
was likely to cost me dear.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" I said to myself grimly. "Twenty pounds on The
Boss, and perhaps, after all, he'll not be able to win."</p>

<p>I ran up quickly to where I had told Lucy to wait for me, at
the top of the grassy slope in front of the grand stand.</p>

<p>I found her at once, and breathlessly informed her she should
have fifty pounds if The Boss won.</p>

<p>"Look out for his colors now&mdash;orange and grey." We had
had a good look at the horse&mdash;in the paddock&mdash;earlier
in the afternoon, and had both thought what a magnificent
looking beast he was.</p>

<p>He was a great big fellow&mdash;jet black&mdash;and with
great big, liquid eyes. He towered high above all the other
horses, and was easily the biggest there.</p>

<p>When I had reached Lucy the horses were already well away,
and in less than a minute, so it seemed, they were right
opposite to us on the other side of the course.</p>

<p>We could easily pick out The Boss. Lucy said he was fifth or
sixth&mdash;at any rate, he was well up and not far behind the
leaders.</p>

<p>"Ben Thomson's going well," remarked a man in front of us.
"Dear old thing, if only he were a few years younger. I've been
backing him for years and&mdash;Lord! the money he must have
cost me&mdash;I must have paid for him by now."</p>

<p>"Look at Eyes of Gray," called out a woman. "Matson's got her
on the rails&mdash;they'll never catch her now. You see."</p>

<p>"The Boss won't win," remarked another man. "He's too far
back among the crowd."</p>

<p>"Just wait," replied his friend. "If he gets through he'll
eat 'em up, that is, if Shooter wants him to."</p>

<p>Round into the straight they came&mdash;seven or eight of
them&mdash;all in a straight line, it seemed to me, but no sign
of The Boss in front&mdash;he was still just behind.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a man yelled, "I told you so&mdash;there's
Shooter coming up," and like a great black wave, The Boss broke
through.</p>

<p>An angry storm of shouting, for The Boss was leading by a
length.</p>

<p>"Damn him," someone shouted, "sold again. Oh, hold him, Eyes
of Gray&mdash;hold him, you little dear."</p>

<p>A beautiful little chestnut mare had spurted grandly to the
black beast's flanks, and was making a gallant effort to
overtake him, but she couldn't keep it up, and The Boss was
again out clear.</p>

<p>A fine handsome roan then got up close and the crowd shrieked
again for The Boss to be overtaken. "Come on, Storm, come
on&mdash;use your whip, man&mdash;use your whip."</p>

<p>But what was the good&mdash;the great black beast shook them
all off contemptuously, and came rattling past the judge's box,
winning, as I knew Waller would have said, by half a street.</p>

<p>The crowd booed angrily as Bob Hales went out to lead him in,
but the old man only smiled unconcernedly, and took no notice of
their menacing attitude towards him.</p>

<p>But he didn't look so unconcerned a few minutes later, when
the man in the crash suit at last managed to get to his side.
There was a blank look of astonishment&mdash;an angry
interchange of words and finally almost an actual fight, with
the dark suit man again as the aggressor.</p>

<p>Some of Hales' friends interfered, but the quarrel had
attracted a good deal of attention and, something of the affair
at the tote window having got about over the course, the public
naturally put two and two together and were immensely tickled
with the way the old man had been served.</p>

<p>Over six thousand pounds had been invested in the tote, and
considerably less than two hundred had gone on The Boss. The
dividend returned was &pound;24 5s. and with my four five-pound
tickets I picked up &pound;485. I was almost speechless with my
good fortune, and Lucy quite thought all the riches in the world
were gathered in the thick wad of notes that she saw me receive
at the paying-out window.</p>

<p>After a good deal of demur I persuaded her to take, then and
there, the fifty pounds that I had promised her if The Boss won.
We had quite a little fight about it, but it was only when I
insisted significantly that she would be wanting every penny of
it very shortly for her bottom drawer that she gave in. A
faraway gentle look came into her eyes, and she gave me a fond
pressure of her hand in reward.</p>

<p>Dear little Lucy! She had half a crown, later on, on The
Dentist, and was very annoyed that it came in only 'fourth.'</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed prettily in painful and reproachful
surprise, "and don't I get anything this time? It looked to be
running so well."</p>

<p>There were two other lumps of sugar in my cup of joy that
afternoon.</p>

<p>The Premier was at the races and, with my face evidently
fresh in his mind, he recognised me at once. Lucy and I were
standing just in front of the grand stand when the great man
came by, accompanied by the Governor of the State. He pulled up
and smilingly held out his hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Wacks, this is better than patrolling
dangerous roads at night&mdash;now isn't it?"</p>

<p>I introduced him to Lucy and we were both in turn made known
to the Governor. We chatted interestedly for a few minutes, and,
of course, everyone was looking at us and taking us all in. A
press photographer snapped us all together, and to my great joy
I caught sight of Waller&mdash;the hated Waller&mdash;staring at
us through the railings of the cheap enclosure. His eyes were
wide with amazement.</p>

<p><br>
IT was nearly 11 o'clock before I brought Lucy home. We had come
to a clear understanding. I had taken her for a walk among the
hills, and I had asked her to be my wife.</p>

<p>It was a starless night, and in a world of dark and stillness
we had sat clasped in ecstasy in each others arms. Her sweet
full lips had clung lingering to mine. I had felt her heart
beat, first, fast in fear&mdash;then slower on her confidence
returning&mdash;and finally to the soft and gentle rhythm of
assured faith and trust.</p>

<p>The night had made a heaven for us, and yet so strange is
life&mdash;there was a subtle sense of sorrow in me as Lucy lay
quiet and all but sleeping in my arms. It was the sorrow of
something gone&mdash;of some high summit scaled&mdash;of depths
of happiness we would never plumb again.</p>

<p>For ever I had set my seal upon her and for ever now would
she remember this first avowal of her love.</p>

<p>Things would never be quite the same to her.</p>

<p>Love, I knew, she might perhaps again&mdash;but never more
would love wake in her from its first maiden dream.</p>

<p>Never more would passion be a stranger to her; for never
could it wait to watch again the lights and splendors of its
maiden dawn rising and crimsoning through the hills and valleys
of her soul.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; SPECIAL CONSTABLE PETER WACKS.</h2>

<p class="first">THE Bowden Vigilance Society was
a great success from the very first, and within a few days the
adjoining suburbs of Croydon and Kilkenny asked to come in under
our wing. It was quite convenient for us to take them, for many
of our streets and roads overlapped, and we soon had a fine wide
organisation, working easily and without friction
throughout.</p>

<p>We were, of course, as I took care we should be, quite free
from any trouble at night, and it soon became a proud boast with
us that while the inhabitants of other townships and suburbs
cowered shiveringly behind closed doors directly dusk had
fallen&mdash;we went about our nightly avocations and amusements
in a perfectly normal manner.</p>

<p>The Adelaide 'Advertiser' sent down a Special Commission to
investigate and make known our methods, and the next morning, in
a long three-column article, spoke most highly of the efficiency
and thoroughness of our organisation. It described the perfect
system of patrols we had initiated, the remarkable way in which
all our arrangements dovetailed into one another, and it pointed
significantly to the security and safety our districts had
enjoyed, from the very first moment we had taken things in
hand.</p>

<p>The article made an immense impression on the city, and were
were inundated with enquiries from other districts.</p>

<p>I was asked repeatedly to speak at hastily summoned public
meetings and nearly always complied with the requests.</p>

<p>Rather to my astonishment still, I found I was a first-class
public speaker; indeed, I was more than that&mdash;I was an
orator.</p>

<p>No matter how important and how influential were the other
speakers on a platform, no one could quite so please the public
as did I.</p>

<p>Big men of the city got up on their legs and with laborious
notes made ponderous heavy speeches of the council chamber
style. They bored their audiences to stiffness, and it would
have been quite possible to photograph the relieved look on the
faces of the crowd as they sat down.</p>

<p>But when I got up I always made things hum. I was light and
easy to listen to, and spoke quite clearly so that everyone
could hear. There was no hesitation at all in my manner, and I
had no difficulty in choosing my words. I could reel off
sentence after sentence as smoothly and as evenly as if I had
previously written it all down. My audiences soon got warmed up.
I could make them laugh, and I could make them cry. They would
clap and stamp until the dust rose from the floor in clouds and
then, with one quick turning of my tongue, I would bring so deep
a hush into the hall that it could be almost felt. Their faces
would grow still and stiff, their eyes would hang on every
movement of my lips, and they would sit like statues, carved in
stone.</p>

<p>I could play on all their feelings and hand out the sob-stuff
or the burning words, just as I chose. When it at last came to
the peroration, I would sometimes wind them up to such a pitch
of enthusiasm that they would break into my last sentences with
a hoarse storm of cheers, so as to make it quite impossible for
me to conclude what I had intended to say.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor remarked feelingly one night, "If ever the
hour has produced the man&mdash;today has given us Peter
Wacks."</p>

<p>In less than three weeks all the suburbs of Adelaide had got
their Vigilance Societies. Prospect and Unley came in last of
all. For a few days they turned up their noses and would have
nothing to do with us. On two consecutive nights, however, they
each had their share of trouble, with the result that they very
quickly and very humbly came to heel.</p>

<p>In due course all the local Vigilance Societies were
affiliated together and I was elected President and Patrol
Inspector-in-Chief.</p>

<p>A rich resident placed a fine car at my disposal so that, as
I thought fit, I could visit all the Vigilance Society centres
in turn and see nothing was being neglected for the public
safety.</p>

<p>The days sped by and looking back down the newspaper files of
the time, one can see plainly that the horror of the city was
widening and deepening in intensity.</p>

<p>The crimes undoubtedly were fewer in number and their
occurrence was more irregular and spasmodic now, but still the
fear of sudden death was over all, and gradually, too, the
dreadful feeling was eating into men's minds that the murderer
would never be found out.</p>

<p>Murder, too, was not the only thing to be dreaded now. Fires
had taken to breaking out in altogether totally unexpected
quarters and the railways and bridges had now to be guarded.</p>

<p>My mentality at this time is very difficult for me to
analyse. As Chairman of the Vigilance Society I had most
thoroughly and most efficiently organised the city patrols; as
maniac under the influence of the drug, I was doing my utmost to
bring all this elaborate machinery to nothing.</p>

<p>It was like some devilish kind of sport to me. I could work
only on the darkest nights now, and even then I had to take
terrible risks in getting about.</p>

<p>Any pedestrian by himself at night was always an object of
suspicion and liable to be stopped and searched at any
moment.</p>

<p>This, I knew, would have been quite fatal for me, for I still
always carried with me my incriminating bar of iron.</p>

<p>One night, late, I was prowling somewhere round St. Peters
and espied three men coming down the road in my direction.</p>

<p>I dodged into a garden to avoid them, but unfortunately a
wretched little pom started yapping and the men stopped when
they came up.</p>

<p>"I would swear I saw someone in front of us," remarked one of
them meditatively, "and if I did, he disappeared about here.
Just flash your lamp will you, Josh? Yes, just over by that
tree."</p>

<p>I stood motionless where I was in the shadows, and should
probably have escaped detection altogether, if the dog hadn't
seen me and rushed down.</p>

<p>I am always quick in my decisions and it was my quickness
alone that saved me then.</p>

<p>I had vaulted over into the road quite five seconds before
any of the men had realised what had happened, and was well away
before they even thought to sound their whistles.</p>

<p>I ran down the road like a hare, but, unfortunately for me,
it was a bad place to be chased in. There were villas almost on
every side and no vacant lands with any chance of hiding if
systematic search were to be made.</p>

<p>I intended to slip over into the Botanic Garden and chance it
among the trees, but just where I was intending to get over, I
heard voices and saw lights flashing, and so had to run on. My
pursuers were still clamoring and whistling behind me.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that I was now running hard towards the
city and any moment the police or patrols might appear and block
my way.</p>

<p>Just when I reached the corner wall of Government House, I
heard answering whistles in front of me, and saw the lights of
two bicycles coming down towards me. As they came under a lamp I
saw they were two of the cycle police.</p>

<p>Things were getting desperate, for I was almost exhausted
with the long run.</p>

<p>I must get over into the Governor's garden, I told myself.
There was no help for it, although it was almost the last place
I should have wished to take refuge in. It was the best guarded
house in Adelaide, I knew, and there were always heaps of police
within call.</p>

<p>I pulled myself up quickly by the thick strands of ivy and
lay panting on the top of the wall. The ivy was thick and high
there, and for the moment I was completely hidden in the shadow
of a big tree.</p>

<p>My pursuers met the two policemen a few yards from where I
lay, and the latter at once got off their machines.</p>

<p>"Seen him?" gasped one of my pursuers. "He can't have got by
here."</p>

<p>"Seen who?" asked one of the policemen quickly. "What are you
running after?"</p>

<p>"A man we caught hiding in a front garden. He ran like hell,
directly we turned the light on him."</p>

<p>"What was he doing in the garden?" went on the policeman
judicially.</p>

<p>"We don't know, but he cut directly we saw him, so he
couldn't have been up to any good."</p>

<p>"Where did you lose him then&mdash;come on, be quick."</p>

<p>"Well," panted the man, still out of breath, "if he didn't
pass you, he must have got over the Governor's wall here."</p>

<p>"Why the devil didn't you say that before?" cut in the
policeman roughly. "Now look here&mdash;you help us, and we'll
catch him sure. Two of you run down along the wall there, and
see that he doesn't escape from that end, and you sir," to the
third man, "go back to the main entrance and tell the sergeant
you'll see there exactly what you've told us&mdash;that an
unknown man's gone into the Vice-regal garden. Be
quick&mdash;don't make a noise now; we'll wait here in case he
tries to bolt back the same way he came, which he probably will
do."</p>

<p>Off went the three men as they were bid, and the policemen
were left alone. They propped their bicycles against a tree and
crept stealthily to the corner angle of the wall.</p>

<p>"Not a sound, Billy," I heard one say. "He'll be somewhere
close here. If he hears nothing maybe he'll pop over again. He
knows he can't get away inside."</p>

<p>They knelt down under the ivy and craning their necks out
cautiously, expectantly regarded the long length of wall that
lay round the corner.</p>

<p>Their backs were now turned to me, and I didn't hesitate a
second. I dropped softly down from the wall, landing without a
sound in the flower bed just underneath.</p>

<p>For a moment I lay prone, and then finding my descent had
passed quite unnoted, wriggled slowly and softly towards the
tree, against which the two bicycles were still leaning.</p>

<p>I tried to make out which was the smaller one, but in the
dark they seemed both about the same size, and I had to chance
not being able to ride the one I was going to select. Lying flat
on my stomach, I reached out and felt for the valve caps of the
one I was going to leave. They were dreadfully hard to turn and
it seemed ages before I at last heard the gentle hissing of the
air escaping from the tyres.</p>

<p>To make doubly sure, I reached up to the wallet just below
the saddle, and abstracting an adjustable wrench, thoroughly
loosened the nuts holding the front wheel into the fork.</p>

<p>Then I rose up suddenly and, still without a sound, started
to trundle the other bicycle along the stretch of grass running
down alongside the path.</p>

<p>I counted on getting at least fifty yards start before I
should be noticed, and I was not far wrong. Indeed, I might have
sneaked off altogether, if it had not been for kicking against a
stone.</p>

<p>I knew instantly they had heard me, for there was a shout and
a damn, followed by a scuttling over the gravel path; the sound
of a bicycle falling down and then&mdash;more damns.</p>

<p>But I had leaped on to the machine I had taken and was flying
for my life back along the road where I had been chased. No one
came after me. There was apparently no pursuit at all; I had
evidently put the other bicycle clean out of action. I could not
have wished for a luckier or more easy escape.</p>

<p>Having gone about half a mile, I turned off into a by-road
and put out my light. Then I made off towards home, as quick as
I could. I was twice challenged that night, but, happily, both
times I had got well by my challengers, before they had caught
sight of me, and as they were both times on foot, I, of course,
got easily away again.</p>

<p>About a mile from home I knew of a long disused gravel pit,
at the back of a small wood. Hardly anyone ever went there
because it was supposed to be infested with snakes. At the
bottom it was covered with a rank undergrowth that had been
undisturbed for years. I chanced the snakes and cautiously
carrying the bicycle down over the rather steep side, hid it
carefully where I should easily be able to find it again. I had
thought, when riding home, that it might come in useful on
future occasions.</p>

<p>The next day all sorts of rumors were going about the city.
The Governor had been attacked&mdash;an attempt had been made to
get at his two children&mdash;a policeman had been killed in
Government House&mdash;the murderer had been chased in the
garden, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There were many contradictions and explanations in the course
of the afternoon, and most of the incidents that had been
reported were later strenuously denied. But stripped of all
gossip and exaggeration, at bottom, it was clear something had
happened at Government House and the public were profoundly
moved.</p>

<p>That the assassin should have had the audacity to penetrate
into the Vice-regal garden, and, moreover, that having done so
and his presence having become known, he should have been able
to baffle and defy the police, struck the public significantly
as a very terrible and incomprehensible thing.</p>

<p>The whole police organisation must be rotten, they said, and
once and for all, special constables must be sworn in.</p>

<p>Pressure was brought on the Government from all sides, the
Governor himself was reported as having vigorously spoken his
own mind, and, in the end the authorities gave way.</p>

<p>At first they spitefully intended altogether to ignore our
organisation, and just published a bare announcement that
special constables would be sworn in in the usual way with no
reference at all to the Vigilance Societies that already
existed.</p>

<p>But I wasn't having anything like that.</p>

<p>At once I got our head-quarters committee together and a
great public meeting was arranged for the next night. We invited
representatives of the Government, of the City Council, and of
the police authorities to be present, and I publicly stated
pertinently that reasons must be forthcoming from them why our
organisation should not be adopted en bloc.</p>

<p>In view of the state of public opinion, they all thought it
wise to accept the invitation, and, when evening came, the
platform was crowded with the big-wigs of the city and the
State. The Premier came in person, and the Lord Mayor and a fair
sprinkling of the alderman and councillors were also there, and
last, but not least, Major Young, the Chief Commissioner of the
Adelaide Police.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the last just before the meeting opened.
He was a fine, tall, good-looking man and gave me a careless,
but very politely frigid bow. I knew that he credited much of
the ill-favor in which the police undoubtedly then were to the
remarks I had been continually making about them.</p>

<p>I didn't know whether our guests by turning up in force
expected to take a rise out of me, but if they did they were
very much mistaken.</p>

<p>I was in the chair and I never for one moment let any of them
forget it.</p>

<p>I rose to a storm of cheers and opened my remarks at once by
saying I was quite sure the great audience then before me had
not been gathered together in any spirit of antagonism to one
another. Rather had they come in a friendly spirit of patriotism
and loyalty to determine exactly what was the best for the care
and safely of the dear city that they all loved so well.</p>

<p>They cheered appreciatively at this, and I went on to
describe the peculiar situation that had arisen amongst us. One
Man&mdash;most probably, only one man&mdash;was defying the
community. He was setting at naught all those laws that they had
framed for mutual safety. He was destroying the peace of the
city and was making a nightly shambles of our roads and streets.
He had been doing it now for over six weeks, and who he was, and
where he was, and where he came from, were just as much secrets
today as they were when he first started on his ghastly
game.</p>

<p>As they were all aware, his cunning had been too great for
the police. It was easy, I knew, to blame the police, but we
must remember they were being called upon to face very unusual
circumstances.</p>

<p>We must not, for a moment, be too hasty in discrediting the
great efforts they had undoubtedly made to effect the arrest of
the malefactor. But&mdash;and here I dropped my voice
impressively, and spoke slowly and deliberately&mdash;while we
must be kind and charitable in our thoughts towards those who
were doing their utmost to carry out their appointed duties, at
an admittedly very difficult time, we must have no pity
whatsoever for any official blindness or red tapeism that
refused to take advantage of one single thing that would make
for the safety of the city. Otherwise, there would be placed
round the neck of those willing and anxious to help a halter too
heavy and too grievous to be borne.</p>

<p>They cheered enthusiastically here, and I gave them two
instances as showing the inability of the police to cope with
the present danger, owing to the paucity of their numbers. The
first, when Policeman Holthusen was killed on the park lands,
and the second, only two nights gone, when the unknown man
escaped, so easily, from the Vice-regal gardens.</p>

<p>"Policeman Holthusen, gentlemen," I cried, "died almost in
his comrades' arms, and the assassin, surprised and seen, seen,
mark you, escaped without the very slightest difficulty through
what should have been one of the most carefully guarded suburbs
of the city; and that with lights flashing and with whistles
blowing for assistance in all directions. Then the night before
last&mdash;what do we have here? An unknown prowler, hiding and
disturbed in a main road garden in St. Peters, is chased for
upwards of a mile by three unofficial pursuers.</p>

<p>"The fugitive runs for safety, not towards lonely parklands,
not towards the outskirts of the city&mdash;but right to the
very heart of the city itself, just as if he were sure of there
shaking off his pursuers. Well&mdash;after running as I say for
over a mile&mdash;he sees two policemen coming up on bicycles,
and is, no doubt, considerably surprised by their totally
unexpected appearance"&mdash;the hall rocked with laughter
here&mdash;"he climbs over, and takes refuge in the Governor's
garden. The police confer with the man's pursuers and learn from
them where he has gone, and take all the immediate measures
possible to them to apprehend him. Well, what was the result?
Not only did they fail to catch him, but he actually borrowed
one of the policemen's bicycles and went off without, I believe,
even condescending to say good-night.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, North terrace is one of the few places that
is not under the protection of our Vigilance patrols. We have
always understood Government House and its immediate
neighborhood to be so strongly guarded as to render it quite
unnecessary for us to take them under our special control. Had
we done so, however, last night's happening would have been
quite impossible. The instant the first whistle sounded it would
have been picked up in every direction by our patrols and a
cordon would have been at once formed.</p>

<p>"Of course, we do not know who was this unknown man who
climbed so quickly in and out of the Vice-regal garden. He may
have been only an ordinary harmless pedestrian, frightened for
the moment out of his wits and common sense. I say he may have
been, but from the cunning of his movements, from his
resource&mdash;do you know he actually stopped to let the wind
out of the tyres of the other bicycle, before mounting the one
he got away with&mdash;and from his general reckless disregard
of danger, I am strongly of opinion that the man who got away
last night is the very man we have been looking for all these
weeks."</p>

<p>I went on, that with dangers such as now threatened us it was
indisputable that we had not enough police. Some of us had
recognised it weeks ago&mdash;officialdom was recognising it
today.</p>

<p>They asked us now for special constables and the whole
question was in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Were the authorities to obtain these special constables from
the single and spasmodic swearing in of individuals, a
proceeding that might entail days and weeks of delay, or were
they to take advantage of an already highly organised body and
obtain all that they required in a single minute and by a single
sweep of the pen?</p>

<p>Surely we deserve some consideration and some thanks from the
authorities&mdash;nay, more&mdash;surely we deserve some honor
and some respect, too. For had we not anticipated, by at least a
month, the tardy movement they were now making today?</p>

<p>Instead of asking generally for special constables, the more
statesmanlike and dignified proceeding on the part of the
authorities would have been to have taken over the Vigilance
Society en bloc and so give us at once the official status we
had been asking for all these weeks. And it would be no favor
they would be granting us either. We should be turning over to
them a going concern&mdash;an organisation that had been tested
and in whose structure every man was dovetailed. We had no
misfits amongst us.</p>

<p>I spoke for about twenty minutes, and there was no question,
but that I carried the entire meeting with me. Indeed, they
cheered for so long that at last I had to stand up and appeal
for silence.</p>

<p>The Premier was the next to speak. He was an old
parliamentary hand and a suave, cynical master of craft. Never,
perhaps, were his powers shown to greater advantage than in his
reply to me.</p>

<p>An election was shortly coming on; it was necessary to keep
every vote for his side, and he saw unmistakably the direction
in which public opinion was set. So he just drifted along with
the current, as if all the time that had been the one precise
direction in which he had intended to go. He agreed entirely
with me that they had better take over the existing organisation
we had formed. Obviously, it was the only thing to do, and if
that were the sole reason for calling the meeting tonight
then&mdash;shrugging his shoulders&mdash;we might just as well
not have called it at all. A word, either in his ear, or in the
ear of the Chief Commissioner of the Police, would have been
quite sufficient. At the same time&mdash;and here he smiled and
bowed most politely to me&mdash;if the meeting had not been
called, speaking for himself, he would have missed one of the
greatest treats of oratory he had enjoyed for a long time. He
only wondered where I had been hiding the great gifts that I
undoubtedly possessed in so remarkable a degree.</p>

<p>As I say, the Premier's speech was a very crafty one, but it
gave as all we wanted and put the meeting on excellent terms
with itself.</p>

<p>Two other speakers followed, and then someone called for the
Chief Commissioner of the Police. The Chief had been sitting the
whole time, as if very bored, crossing and uncrossing his legs,
and continually taking out his watch to look at the time.
Apparently he was not over-anxious to speak, for at first he
smiled coldly and shook his head, when the audience asked for
him.</p>

<p>But the calls becoming more insistent and the Premier leaning
round and whispering something, he came forward to comply with
the request.</p>

<p>Now he was no fool; anyone could see that by looking at him,
and his speech was quite a little model, in its way.</p>

<p>He said he was a soldier, and a policeman, and always averse
to talking about his work. Just now, his work was very
unpleasant and he was quite aware he was most unpopular. But
then, policemen were always unpopular, it was just part of their
calling to be unpopular. One-half of the world was always
wanting the other half to be locked up, and they offended some
people when they took them up and offended others when they
didn't. They were in for a bad time, anyway. If things were
going all right, people looked upon them as unnecessary and a
needless expense. If things went wrong, everybody blamed them
and asked, "What the devil are the police doing?"</p>

<p>Speaking for himself, if anyone wanted to take on his job
they were welcome to. He got more kicks than halfpence every
day. As to the Vigilance Societies, he should be most happy to
have them to work under him, but&mdash;here he squared his jaw
and looked very sternly at me&mdash;anybody who was sworn in as
a special constable would have to sink his individuality and be
amenable to discipline in the usual way. Let them, please,
remember that.</p>

<p>He resumed his seat without having made many friends, but he
left behind him the impression of being a strong and capable
man.</p>

<p>I met him next day at luncheon at Government House. I learned
afterwards that the Governor had purposely arranged the meeting
in order to soften down any antagonism there might be between
us. There was also present Sir Bartle Elkin&mdash;the great
mental expert&mdash;perhaps the greatest authority on diseases
of the mind that the Commonwealth has ever produced. He was a
long-faced, lean, clean-shaven man with the abstract dreamy look
that is so often seen on the faces of those placed over the care
of the insane. Our main topic of conversation was, of course,
the terror that was hanging over the city, and I enjoyed the
discussion in a strange, impersonal sort of way.</p>

<p>The Governor asked me presently, if I had formed any decided
opinions as to the kind of man the malefactor was.</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment, and he went on smilingly.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Wacks, you must surely have some idea in your own
mind as to the personality of the man against whom you have
built up that fine organization of yours."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," I replied cautiously, "I regard him, as I
suppose we all do, as a madman of a kind."</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'of a kind'?"</p>

<p>"Well, he can't be mad always, he can't carry about him any
sign of his madness, for instance, or he would have been spotted
long ago."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Mr. Wacks," broke in Sir Bartle, "and that's where
our difficulty lies. Probably if the man were here with us at
this table today, he would be just like you and me, or our
friend here, the Chief Commissioner of the Police. No one would
possibly be able to certify him as insane."</p>

<p>"I have often mildly speculated too, Sir Bartle," I continued
coolly, "as to whether, indeed, he might not be a member of my
own troop."</p>

<p>"Most possibly so, Mr. Wacks," smiled back the great
specialist thoughtfully, "indeed, you yourself might be he. In
fact, and I know you won't mind my saying so&mdash;to me, as a
mental student, you yourself exhibit many of the characteristics
that this gentleman who is so troubling us to-day must
possess."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, doctor," interrupted the Governor laughingly, "I
can't have you putting down all the trouble to Mr.
Wacks&mdash;at my own table, too."</p>

<p>"No, no, not for a moment, my lord&mdash;I didn't say that.
What I meant was&mdash;our friend here has shown himself to be
suddenly the possessor of characteristics as totally unexpected
as all the characteristics of the man we are looking for. An
unknown quantity a few weeks ago, today Mr. Wacks is easily the
second most interesting personality in the State. I was at the
meeting last night, and it struck me then that exactly as some
unknown force acting on the mentality of one man has given us a
secret, a hidden criminal, so another unknown force acting on
the mentality of another man&mdash;in this case Mr. Peter
Wacks&mdash;has given us a fine organiser and a great orator. I
know Mr. Wacks will forgive me the comparison, but as I say, as
a very humble student of the workings of the mind, both men
exhibit to me the same wonderful new-born qualities of
power&mdash;ability and resource. One, of course, using these
qualities for the well-being of the community&mdash;the other
for its harm. You follow me, don't you, Mr. Wacks?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," I assented laughing, "you mean I am under
suspicion."</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all, but you are a surprise to us,
just as the other man is, but happily in a very different
way."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems to me," said the Commissioner of the Police,
looking highly amused, "that at any rate I shall have to keep my
eye on our friend here."</p>

<p>We all laughed good naturedly. I felt quite at ease,
notwithstanding the dangerous turn the conversation had taken.
It didn't seem to trouble me in the least. As far as I was
concerned, they might have been talking about another man.</p>

<p>"What puzzles me," went on Sir Bartle meditatively, "what I
don't understand is how the madman has managed to maintain his
anonymity for so long. How it is these dreadful bouts of mania,
extending for over six weeks now, have not wholly broken down
his mind and so betrayed him. In his lucid intervals, he must go
back very completely to a state of mental quietness, or his
brain must have generally given way long before now.</p>

<p>"Then, if he does go back to comparative sanity in the
intervals between his paroxysms&mdash;what is it that stirs him
up again?"</p>

<p>"What are the stimuli that bring him, almost nightly, to a
state of mania? Is it a drug? I know of nothing that could keep
up its effect for so long. It is quite beyond me."</p>

<p>We were all silent from different motives, and after a few
moments the great specialist went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One thing I do notice now&mdash;the violence of his mania
seems rather to be fading away."</p>

<p>"Fading away, is it?" growled the Chief Commissioner. "I
haven't seen any fading away. That affair up at Gilberton last
Sunday was as bad as anything we have had&mdash;quite."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I was referring, rather, to the frequency of the
attacks, not to their violence when they actually occur. Look
here; it's just over six weeks since these crimes started and
the man has had, say, twenty-seven nights when the moon allowed
him to carry on his dreadful work. Twenty-seven nights when he
could work in darkness, between half-past eight and eleven. I
believe all his attacks have taken place between those
hours&mdash;haven't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," replied the Chief resignedly. "He's been
always most particular to finish in time so that he could catch
his tram or his train&mdash;confound him."</p>

<p>"Well, in the first fourteen of these favorable nights we
hear of him on eleven occasions&mdash;in the last thirteen
favorable nights, he troubles us upon only seven, and in the
last six nights, only twice. You see my point, Chief, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I follow you there, Sir Bartle, but what do you
argue from that?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I am wondering if by any chance his mania is
beginning to exhaust itself, and that after a few days
everything may die down, and we may hear nothing more of him.
It's quite possible."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," frowned the Chief Commissioner, "that
he may suddenly subside to normal life again, and that we may
hear nothing further of him?"</p>

<p>"Quite possible, at any rate for a time, until his mania may
perhaps break out again."</p>

<p>"The saints preserve us!" ejaculated the Chief. "I want to
live a few years longer. The early grave business is not in my
line."</p>

<p>"Well, we ought to know soon now&mdash;it will be seven weeks
on Tuesday since the first manifestation began.</p>

<p>"No it was earlier than that, doctor," said the Chief,
shaking his head; "we know now they began on the Monday."</p>

<p>"But surely poor old Bentley was killed on the Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Yes, but on the Monday something else happened."</p>

<p>We all looked interestedly at the Chief. He evidently enjoyed
our puzzled looks, for it was quite a minute before he went
on.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Wacks, here, didn't know everything, although I may
say frankly that I have been surprised several times by what he
does know. What happened on the Monday was this. A man in Bowden
had seven rabbits killed. No&mdash;you needn't laugh. I firmly
believe their killing was the work of this same hand.</p>

<p>"Someone, in the middle of the night, went into this man's
garden, opened seven rabbit hutches, killed seven rabbits and
put them all back, one by one, just as he had found them. We
have gone most carefully into the matter and can conceive of no
earthly reason for it at all. It was just as insane and
purposeless as all these later crimes&mdash;and in the manner of
its execution, it is quite on all fours with them."</p>

<p>"This is most interesting, Major. I ought to have been told
of it before. Give me the details most minutely now."</p>

<p>I sat silent in great astonishment, and for the first time
for many weeks there flashed through my mind the possibility
that I might be found out. I dropped my eyes to think. I had
quite forgotten about Boulter and his rabbits, and it positively
amazed me that anyone had so wonderfully grasped the
significance of their deaths. It must be Meadows, of course. I
must look after him&mdash;lately, I had never given him a
thought.</p>

<p>I intently regarded the Doctor and the Chief as they
discussed the matter. How very, very different were their faces,
I thought, and yet&mdash;and yet I fancied I could see the cold,
clear, icy reasoning in them both. The power to push away the
lines of thought not wanted, and sink like a plummet to the very
bottom rock of facts.</p>

<p>I was a fool, I told myself. They had evidently been throwing
a wide net around, and all the time I had never given a thought
to the possibilities of what they might drag in. I must be
careful.</p>

<p>I went back to the office that afternoon rather depressed. I
longed for the time when I could get home and fly again to the
paste.</p>

<p><br>
THE next day it was, of course, in all the morning papers that
Sir Bartle Elkin, the Chief Commissioner of the Police, and I
had lunched with the Governor at Government House. It was very
amusing to feel the almost awed respect they now had for me in
the office. Even the hated Waller was subdued in his manner when
he spoke to me, and there was always quite a hush when I gave
orders or spoke to them. They had really become very proud of
me, and, I knew, referred to me outside the office, as "Our
Peter Wacks."</p>

<p>The firm, too, were very pleased with the position I now
occupied in the public eye. Old Mr. Winter had had me up to
dinner in his big mansion, in the most select part of North
Adelaide, and his daughter from the first had made quite a fuss
of me.</p>

<p>She was a woman of about thirty, and, unused though I was to
the ways of her sex, I could not but help noticing the interest
she at once took in me. Of a strong, independent nature
herself&mdash;a woman who, in the ordinary way, was not much
attracted by men&mdash;I must have struck some chord in her that
brought out the inherent longing of every woman to be the care
and fond desire of some one man.</p>

<p>Anyhow, she was most nice to me, and in a tactful friendly
way made me feel at once at my ease. There were nine of us at
table, and I joined naturally and unrestrainedly in all the talk
that went on.</p>

<p>During dinner the conversation happened to turn on chess, and
I told them all about Captain Barker and the many games I had
had with him.</p>

<p>A keen looking, hawk-faced man, who, I learned afterwards,
was Professor of Mathematics at the Adelaide University, was
most interested, and asked me what sort of game the old man
played.</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied, "he was in a way a really marvellous player.
He had quite a natural genius for the game."</p>

<p>"And yourself," queried the Professor smiling, "I should say
you would be a devout disciple?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can play," I admitted, "but I have met so few really
good players that I hardly exactly know my strength."</p>

<p>"Or your weakness," smiled back the Professor. "Well, I must
give you a game&mdash;I rather fancy myself, you know."</p>

<p>"Don't take him on, Mr. Wacks," advised Miss Winter, shaking
her head emphatically. "He's a very hard nut to crack, and by
far the best player here."</p>

<p>But I felt quite confident, and when, later on in the
evening, the Professor set out the chessmen, I sat down to the
board without any qualms at all.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind I'll take first move," he said, "and, of
course, we must play quickly. I just want to get some idea of
what your old sea captain's teaching was worth."</p>

<p>Everyone stood round to watch the game.</p>

<p>He opened at once with a most slashing attack, and in the
first few moves boldly made the sacrifice of a pawn. I wasn't in
the slightest degree nonplussed, however, but met his onslaught
patiently, and with the perfect confidence of later reprisals.
After 10 moves he was thinking harder than I, and after 15 I
could feel his attack had weakened right away. He began to
hesitate in making his moves, but I was ready always on the
instant with my replies.</p>

<p>He looked up soon, and smilingly asked what I thought of the
prospects of the game.</p>

<p>"No, don't hesitate, Mr. Wacks, give me your honest opinion.
Remember, I am trying to test your knowledge of the game."</p>

<p>"Well," I replied bluntly, rather nettled with his
patronising air, "you haven't a chance at all. You are a pawn
down, your attack has failed, and in half a dozen moves at most
your position will be so cramped that you'll have to sacrifice a
piece to get elbow room."</p>

<p>He thought for a minute. "Quite true&mdash;quite true," he
slowly remarked at length. "It's as you say, I'll give you this
game. Now you open, please. Perhaps I'll have better luck this
time."</p>

<p>I opened in exactly the same way as he had done and at once
offered the sacrifice of a pawn. He screwed up his face to an
amused grimace. "You're cruel, sir, very cruel," he remarked;
"it's just like smacking a naughty child."</p>

<p>He took the pawn, however, and started to follow the line of
defence that I had adopted in the previous game. But I varied
the attack considerably, and, playing strongly and fearlessly,
in a few moves offered the sacrifice of a piece. For a long time
he hesitated&mdash;so long that old Mr. Winter banteringly
implored him to buck up. Then he suddenly whipped off his knight
with a jerk, and, leaning back in his chair, looked round
complacently as if quite assured that he had at last done a good
thing. Three moves later however, he had got both his hands on
to his forehead, and it was my turn to assume the pose of all
things going well.</p>

<p>He didn't wait very long this time, but looked across to me,
with quite a sad smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Master," he said with a fine exaggeration of
disappointment, "what do you think of the game now?"</p>

<p>"Mate in three," I replied laconically, "or you lose your
queen." He downed his king with a little bow and got up from the
table.</p>

<p>"You're quite a player, Mr. Wacks," he said, "a fine player.
I don't deny I'm chagrined a bit, and I confess I feel very
humble. I dare say in a match I should give you a better game
than I've given you now, but still you're stronger than I in
every way. Speaking off-hand, I should say you're quite good
enough to play in a Masters' tourney; I know something about the
game, too; for five years I took on all comers in Sydney."</p>

<p>Miss Winter was quite delighted that I had beaten the
Professor, and in saying good-bye, hoped I should often come up
now. She said I must give her some lessons in chess.</p>

<p>A few days later I was called into the private office of the
firm, and given the post of general secretary to the
Company.</p>

<p>It meant a tremendous boost for me, for the salary was nearly
three times what I had been receiving in the invoice room.</p>

<p>"We pride ourselves as a firm in being enterprising, Wacks,"
laughed Mr. William, "and it would be hardly up to our
principles to keep any gentleman of such organising ability as
yours in the lowly position of a clerk in the invoice room."</p>

<p>When I told Lucy that night of what had happened she threw
her arms round my neck in delighted surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter dear, I'm so happy," she said. "Everything seems
so different to me now since you love me. When I wake up in the
morning I hear the birds calling to me through the window, and
all day long I want to sing. I'm always thinking about you and
just longing for the time when I shall be all yours."</p>

<p>I strained her to me passionately, but somewhere deep down in
my subconscious mind there was something stirring that made me
feel uneasy, and part afraid. Was I beginning to think?</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE GRAVEL PIT.</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER being sworn in as special constable, I was
very often up at the police head-quarters, in Victoria square.
As Patrol Inspector-in-Chief I had no particular duties assigned
to me, but had a roving commission given me, which, in effect,
left me pretty well free to do as I pleased, although every
evening I was expected to put in an appearance and sign the roll
of attendance.</p>

<p>Contrary to what I had expected, the Chief Commissioner was
always very pleasant to me; indeed, he was sometimes quite
affable, and given to joking about the cloud we were both
under.</p>

<p>He often said he was sure the crowd would hang us both some
day, and when in a good mood it was his favorite joke to ask if
I had chosen my particular lamp-post yet.</p>

<p>One evening I boldly appropriated a policeman's cape and cap.
There were always a number hanging up in the men's waiting room
and, noticing the place to be empty once when I passed, I darted
in quickly and helped myself to what I hurriedly considered were
suitable sizes.</p>

<p>I walked out calmly with them tucked away under my arm and no
one took any notice of what I was carrying.</p>

<p>I had been wanting them badly&mdash;to go with the
policeman's bicycle I had already annexed.</p>

<p>There was now such a cloud of suspicion hovering over
everyone that even a man bicycling slowly along, with full
lights glaring, was liable any moment to be stopped and
questioned.</p>

<p>But the policeman's cape and cap would make it quite
different, I thought, and upon meeting any patrol-men suspicion
would be disarmed at once. I chanced it that the loss of the
things would not be discovered; at any rate, I guessed no one
would ever dream they had been stolen from inside.</p>

<p>I was still taking the nightly dose of paste, but somehow I
didn't feel nearly so keen now about going out upon my dreadful
quest of blood.</p>

<p>Whether or not the drug was gradually losing its effect upon
me, as the great specialist had suggested, I could not tell, but
certainly as the days went on I began only very occasionally to
go out.</p>

<p>For one reason, perhaps, I was never certain to be free now
until fairly late in the evening, and when the dreadful fits did
seize me, I had to work in very late and unprofitable hours.
There were then fewer people about and, besides, everyone had by
now been so thoroughly stirred up and frightened that they took
far fewer risks, and either stayed indoors altogether, or went
about outside in twos and threes.</p>

<p>I have, strangely enough, a much clearer memory of what
happened in those later times and it seems to me now that my
various personalities were beginning then gradually to coalesce
and overlap.</p>

<p>I could no longer keep my mind exactly in compartments, and
one part of my life began to worry about what the other part was
doing.</p>

<p>Sometimes for a few minutes thoughts about the future, too,
would oppress me and I was no longer content, as I had been, to
live wholly in the passing hour. I began to worry about Lucy.
One day I caught myself wondering if she would be happy as my
wife.</p>

<p>These thoughts did not last for long at a time, but I
gradually began to feel they were there. I was like a man with a
sore place that was always likely to give trouble.</p>


<p><br>
ONE night, very late, I found myself near the Zoological
Gardens. It had been a fearfully gusty day, and the wind was
still blowing furiously.</p>

<p>One of my real savage moods had returned and I was quite
reckless of anything I did. I had ridden boldly up to the city,
along the Port Road, and it had been no gratification to me that
I had openly passed three patrols without being spoken to and
questioned.</p>

<p>I had hidden my bicycle under the bank of the Torrens River
and was sullenly prowling round, rejoicing in the risks and
dangers I was running.</p>

<p>Suddenly, between the gusts of wind, I heard the roaring of a
lion. It sounded mournful and sorrowful to me, as if the beast
were pining for its home. I was in angry pity all at once. What
brutes men were to cage these poor beasts! They had no right to
inflict a lifetime of loneliness upon any animal, just to
gratify a lot of silly people who paid sixpences and shillings
to stare and gape at creatures often far nobler than themselves.
It ought to be stopped.</p>

<p>Then an idea flashed to me. At any rate, they should have one
night of freedom to remember.</p>

<p>I climbed without difficulty over the wall, and in a couple
of minutes I was standing in front of the cages of the
imprisoned beasts.</p>

<p>It was the night of a new moon, and I could just make out the
dim form of the lion whose despairing roar had called up my
train of thought.</p>

<p>He was a magnificent animal and was softly padding to and fro
behind the bars of his cage.</p>

<p>I mounted fearlessly to the door at the side and with my
short bar of iron, set vigorously to work on the lock. It was a
flimsy sort of arrangement at any time, but, clinging to the
cage with one arm as I had to, it was quite four or five minutes
before I broke it open, and was able to fling wide the door for
the lion to come out.</p>

<p>To my annoyance, however, the beast was nowhere to be seen.
My hammering evidently had been too much for its nerves and it
had crept into its sleeping apartment, apparently afraid.</p>

<p>I rattled on the bars disgustedly to make it come out, but it
was no good, and then in a fit of rage I walked right in and
threw a handful of gravel in the direction of where I thought
the beast must be.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, however, and for a moment I had serious
thoughts of going in to drag it out forcibly, but an angry growl
in the darkness made me think better of it, and I passed on to
the next cage.</p>

<p>There were two young tigers there, and at once both were much
interested in my proximity to their cage; indeed, I had to hit
one vigorously over the paws several times with my iron before I
could sufficiently divert his attention from my legs to allow me
to get to work on the lock.</p>

<p>When I at length did get the door open both animals dashed
through so quickly that I was knocked over and left sprawling on
the gravel, in front of the cage.</p>

<p>I next had a go at the bears. Three brown ones I saw depart
inquisitively upon a tour of inspection in the direction of the
manager's house, but the fourth, a big black one, pig-headedly
refused to get up or even budge an inch, notwithstanding that I
prodded vigorously into his back with a long piece of paling
that I found on the path, outside his cage. He just grunted and
rolled over out of reach.</p>

<p>Two wolves also persistently refused to leave their cage
until, in a terrible rage now, I finally went in and booted them
out. I fancied they must have gone in the same direction as the
bears, for I later heard an awful row as it they were
disagreeing together.</p>

<p>I went to let out the big polar bear, too, but on my
approaching his cage he was most anxious at once to commence
operations on me. The silly brute wouldn't let me come anywhere
near the bars without thrusting his nasty looking claws out and
trying to grab at me and pull me in. I hit him and threw gravel
at him, but he just snarled and kept his place, so I gave him up
at last and came away.</p>

<p>I let out a few parrots and broke down the ostrich door, but
it was poor sport and quite in a disgusted frame of mine I
returned to my bicycle and rode off.</p>

<p>Next morning there were all sorts of rumors going about. I
heard them even going up in the train. All the animals had got
loose from the Zoo. The elephants had broken into the Botanic
Gardens and eaten all the oranges off the trees. One of the
tigers had got right through the city and had walked into the
office of the Tramway Trust&mdash;he had fortunately, however,
discovered at once where he was and had slunk away, abashed.
(The Tramway Trust had just recently raised the tram fares on
all their routes.) A big bear had got into the Cathedral, but
the Bishop had been privately rehearsing his Sunday sermon there
and the bear had gone off to sleep. A short-sighted old lady had
woke him up by prodding with her umbrella, thinking it was the
Dean&mdash;and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Everyone was much amused and it was only when they found that
a tiger was actually somewhere at large in the city that the
situation lost something of its humor.</p>

<p>The animal was later located, however, in the garage of a
dentist, whose back entrance opened into Gawler Place. With the
energetic help of this gentleman it was soon coaxed into a large
packing case and secured. The jovial dentist stood all its
captors drinks and, hastily summoning a photographer, had his
photo taken sitting on the packing case and surrounded by the
four uniformed attendants from the Zoo. He said it was one of
the most reasonable patients he had ever attended.</p>

<p>None of the other animals, it appeared later, had got outside
the Zoo ground; some even had never left their cages, and, the
facts becoming known, the public generally voted them a poor set
of wild beasts, and sarcastically suggested they should be
henceforth allowed to roam loose.</p>

<p>But if the public were amused, the authorities were not, and
long and serious confabulations took place at the police
head-quarters as to the immunity the perpetrator of these continued
outrages enjoyed.</p>

<p>I did not go out for several nights after that. I had hurt my
left hand considerably in banging about the cage locks and it
was quite stiff and useless for a while. I told everyone I had
twisted it in chopping wood.</p>

<p>Two days after the affair at the Zoo, I fancied there was an
unusual air of expectation on the faces of the heads at Victoria
Square. The Chief himself was in a most happy mood, and chaffed
me incessantly whenever he saw me.</p>

<p>"Chosen your lamp-post yet, Mr. Wacks?" he laughed genially.
"I've chosen mine, just outside Tattersalls Club, to be a
warning to all the evildoers there. I hear they're betting ten
to one against us finding our friend within the next six
months."</p>

<p>I frowned coldly at him. I was sure something was going on
and was annoyed that we specials were never, even in the very
slightest degree, taken into the confidence of the regular
officials. Even small unimportant things that were taking place
came to my knowledge sometimes in quite a roundabout way from
casual conversation with some of my brother specials&mdash;and
as their chief officer I felt I was being badly treated.</p>

<p>I had expected that quite naturally there would be always
some sort of jealousy between the regular police and ourselves,
but I had expected also that we should receive at least some
part of their confidence.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;we were never told anything about anything and
the youngest policeman would always derive pleasure in handing
out a snub whenever he could.</p>

<p>I tried tacitly to pump Meadows, but I might just as well
have spoken to a piece of cheese. Early one morning, I met him
at home, just when he was coming in for breakfast. He looked
white and tired, as if he had been up all night; also I noticed
his clothes were very dusty and there were reddish patches on
his coat.</p>

<p>"Morning, Mr. Meadows," I said cheerfully. "How's business?
Anything fresh?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen the papers yet," he replied coldly. "We shall
be sure to see if there is anything then"&mdash;and he passed
brusquely back to his own room. Unmannered beast, I thought; I
was beginning to hate him.</p>

<p>I was very puzzled, for I knew from Mrs. Bratt that Meadows
had lately been sleeping at home a lot during the day, and that,
of course, meant he had been out on all-night work.</p>

<p>I was more convinced than ever that something was going on
and, in a faint uneasy way, I fell to wondering if it could
possibly be anything to do with me.</p>

<p>The solution came to me that afternoon, in a very unexpected
manner.</p>

<p>I was walking up North Terrace at lunch time, and suddenly
came face to face with Sir Bartle Elkin.</p>

<p>He stopped at once and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Wacks," he said cordially, "and how's that great
abnormal brain of yours today? Any grit in the wheels yet, as
time goes on, or do you find it working better and better with
the exercise you are now giving it?"</p>

<p>I assured him I was well strung up to concert pitch and ready
and waiting for anything.</p>

<p>"Now didn't I tell you," he went on, "that things must get
quieter and quieter in the mania line? No outrage now for over a
week, except that potty little affair at the Zoo, which, after
all, may have been only a little ebullition of spirit on the
gentleman's part. But still," and he wagged his head solemnly,
"no relaxation of vigilance, mind&mdash;no taking things easy
now. If he commits, perhaps, only one more crime, that crime may
yet turn out to be the most bloody and most wicked of the lot.
Well&mdash;good-bye&mdash;hope I shall meet you again some day,
and we'll continue that interesting little discussion we were
having at the Governor's. You know, you're quite a study to me,
and you're indexed up on my file. Oh, by-the-by, there's a most
interesting case at the hospital just now. I've just come from
there. A case of delirium after snake-bite. A policeman was
bitten the day before yesterday, and he's been raving ever since
that he was watching a bicycle and the tyres turned into a snake
and bit him. Funny, the line of thought, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What?" I exclaimed startled, I didn't know why. "A policeman
bitten by a snake&mdash;not an Adelaide policeman, surely."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;a city one. A red-headed Irishman, and bitten
close to the city, too, I think. He's been very bad, but he's
pulling round nicely now. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He went off smiling, but left me thinking heavily.</p>

<p>A policeman bitten by a snake and thinking he was watching a
bicycle! Snakes&mdash;policeman&mdash;and a bicycle. Good
heavens! How it all smelt of the gravel pit. A red-haired
Irishman too! It must be Sullivan, and Sullivan was Meadows's
pal! Meadows's pal, and the one that always worked with him on
double jobs! Could they&mdash;could they possibly have traced
the bicycle by now? Out there in that lonely gravel-pit behind
the brick-kilns on the Torrens Road! Brick-kilns&mdash;
brick-kilns&mdash;bricks&mdash;good Lord!&mdash;where had I just
seen the red dust of bricks? Why Meadows had had brick dust on his
coat that very morning! Meadows himself!</p>

<p>In a flash the light came to me and everything was clear as
day. Of course, that was the excitement at the police
head-quarters. They had found the bicycle and were expecting to trap
me at last, thinking any night I might be returning again to get
the machine. They were watching the pit. That was why Meadows
had been out all night lately, and that was why he had got the
brick dust on his coat.</p>

<p>What an escape! And what a fool I had been! I had looked upon
the police as asses and yet, in less than ten days, they had
gone straight to the one spot, out of the many millions I might
have chosen, and found the machine. I wondered vaguely how they
had ever gone on the track, and then I called myself a fool
again. Of course, the two lots of people who had challenged me
that night when I had taken the bicycle must have reported to
the police separately and that had given them some sense of the
direction I had gone.</p>

<p>Then, too, Meadows had lived all his life about Bowden, and,
of course, he knew every possible or probable hiding place for
miles round. No doubt, he had many times thrown stones into the
slimy pool at the bottom of the pit, just as I had often done
when a boy.</p>

<p>Yes, it was rather simple after all. I wondered then if they
had found the policeman's cape and cap I had hidden under some
stones in another part of the pit. Anyhow, it didn't matter if
they had&mdash;I wouldn't go for them again.</p>

<p>I was very absent-minded that afternoon at the office. I felt
really worried all the time, and it was quite a new thing for
me. I was fidgety and anxious, I didn't quite know why.</p>

<p>I left early that afternoon and walked up to the police
head-quarters. It was easy for me to make an excuse, and I was
curious to confirm my suspicions.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I met the very man I wanted, Inspector
Wedlake&mdash;he was the Chief's right-hand man. I asked him
carelessly if he were satisfied with the attendance the specials
were putting in.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied emphatically, "you've got together a
smart, keen lot of men, and not one has failed for duty
yet."</p>

<p>"How are your own lambs, Inspector?" I
laughed&mdash;referring, of course, to the regular police.</p>

<p>"As happy and as frolicsome as anyone could wish, Mr.
Wacks."</p>

<p>"None of them ill either, Inspector&mdash;every one on duty,
too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;every one on duty&mdash;we don't allow
sickness in the force. Why, if any of the poor beggars here fell
ill, we should soon have someone writing to the papers to point
out what a weak lot we had recruited," and he laughed in high
good humor at his own wit.</p>

<p>What a liar the Inspector was, I thought&mdash;but there was
no doubt they had all got the office to keep the news of
Policeman Sullivan's snakebite from getting about. Of course, if
it got out he had been bitten by a snake, everyone would have
been interested at once to know how it had happened, and perhaps
the purloiner of the bicycle might get his suspicions and stay
away. The gravel pit was notorious for its evil reputation for
snakes.</p>

<p>I was quite satisfied that I had hit on the truth, but still
I hadn't done with the matter yet.</p>

<p>There was a hill about a mile from the gravel pit that would
command, I knew, an almost clear view of the brickfields through
which anyone would have to pass to get to where I had hidden the
bicycle.</p>

<p>I determined to watch that evening at dusk, for if they were
watching the pit, as I was almost certain they were, it would be
at dusk that they would place their sentries to be ready for the
night.</p>

<p>I made my way home quickly to get the binoculars I had bought
when Lucy and I went to the races, and about half an hour before
dusk I was lying snugly among the bushes on the side of the hill
I had selected for my observations.</p>

<p>I could see the brickfields quite easily and with the glasses
could even pick out small objects lying about on the grass. It
was well I had come early, for I was hardly comfortably settled
in my position when I saw a solitary figure walk quickly over
the brickfields and disappear into the little wood.</p>

<p>Another and another followed until in less than five minutes
I had counted ten. They had all walked quickly and purposely
into the wood, with no loitering or hesitation. At that distance
they had all seemed to have overcoats or mackintoshes on, and
one, from the forward way in which he held his head, I could
have sworn was Meadows himself.</p>

<p>I waited until dark had actually closed down, but nothing
more happened. All was lonely as the grave&mdash;I should have
added, silent as the grave, too, if once or twice I had not
fancied I could hear the deep, but far-off, baying of a hound.
Evidently, I thought, they were well prepared, and, hoping an
opportunity would present itself, had actually got the
bloodhounds handy to lay them quickly on the trail.</p>

<p>That night I determined somehow to get into Meadows' room.
Things could not be more fortunate for me in that respect;
Meadows himself, I was certain, would be out all night, and Mrs.
Bratt would probably be away, too. Her married sister was very
ill at Alberton, about three miles away, and every evening
lately Mrs. Bratt had taken herself off with tears and profuse
apologies, leaving us to look after ourselves.</p>

<p>I was very uneasy about Meadows and a sure instinct told me
that, sooner or later, his suspicions were going to fall on me.
There were so many little things that might turn his thoughts
towards me, and once his suspicions were really awakened a
dangerous significance would attach to lots of happenings that
at present he could think nothing of.</p>

<p>He knew, for instance, that I often came home very late, and
upon three occasions when I must have had blood on me, if he had
only known it, he had passed and said good-night to me in the
hall.</p>

<p>Then there was the business about Boulter's rabbits. Of
course, it was he who had guessed there was some connection
between the rabbit killing and the other crimes. Only he could
have told the Chief of Police about it. Then, this present
affair at the gravel pit. He must have guessed that the man who
hid the bicycle there would live somewhere handy to the spot.
Yes&mdash;altogether, I thought, Meadows was a man I must know
all I could about. He was going to be very dangerous to me.</p>

<p>I knew he always kept his room locked. I had never been in
it, all the five years and more he and I had boarded with Mrs.
Bratt. It was always locked except when he was having his meals
in the kitchen, and then Mrs. Bratt was allowed to go in and
tidy it up a bit. Captain Barker had often laughed about the
funny arrangement; he used to suggest Meadows must be keeping
dead bodies there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bratt went out early, as I had thought she would, and
waiting a few minutes in case she should be coming back for
something she had forgotten, I stealthily set about my
investigations.</p>

<p>I switched off all the lights and put the house in darkness.
Then I crept quietly out by the back door and carefully examined
Meadows' window from outside.</p>

<p>As I expected, it was unlatched and wide open. There was only
the flyproof wire frame to protect the room from intruders. I
soon made short work of that.</p>

<p>I carefully prised out the nails that held the wire frame to
the window sill, and in half a minute was inside the room.</p>

<p>I pulled down the blind and boldly switched on the light. It
would be far better, I argued, to have the light full on than to
be seen sneaking about by the flash of my electric torch.</p>

<p>The room was quite nicely furnished though, and there were a
lot of books on the shelf. Books on travel, books on law,
novels, detective stories, Tudor's 'Psychology of Crime,'
Fendleson's 'The Art of Disguise,' a book on Poisons, and two
thick volumes on Medical Jurisprudence. Dear me, I thought, a
student here. Meadows must be quite a rising young man, and far
more than the stolid, clod-hopping policeman I had always taken
him to be.</p>

<p>I opened his cupboard, and his clothes at once profoundly
interested me. Heaps and heaps of them, and of all sorts of cuts
and shapes. I knew his work often took him out in
disguise&mdash;for Mrs. Bratt had continually told me so, but I
never imagined anything like this. He had countrymen's and
laborers' suits&mdash;a suit of a navvy&mdash;one of a railway
porter&mdash;a rig-out that looked like a tramp's, and last but
not least, a nice, natty-looking, well-cut dress suit.</p>

<p>All, too, were hanging methodically on their separate pegs.
In a box on the bottom shelf I found two wigs, a lot of tufts of
false hair, and a complete grease paint outfit for making
up.</p>

<p>I was the more and more astonished.</p>

<p>I opened a large tin trunk next, and in it found pile upon
pile of newspaper cuttings all neatly docketed and arranged.</p>

<p>There was a large map there, which something made me open. I
was at once amply repaid.</p>

<p>It was a full-size scale map of Adelaide and its
surroundings, and there were little red crosses all over it,
with marginal notes at the side. It didn't take me long before I
realised that the little red crosses marked the places where I
had attempted or had committed my crimes. Every spot in the city
or thereabouts where I had been at any time heard of had been
carefully marked down; and the marginal notes explained things,
and gave the approximate time.</p>

<p>I felt my back beginning to creep.</p>

<p>Underneath the newspapers, I came upon the gem of all. A
fair-sized, thickish, black book that he had used as a rough
diary and that extended back for years. The entries were in neat
regular handwriting, but the names of most of the people he
referred to were represented by abbreviations or simply by a
single letter.</p>

<p>I started upon the book towards the end, and soon found
things that interested me. Some of the entries were most
trivial, however. 'Mrs. B. broke water jug,' was one. 'Mrs. B's
sister came,' was another. Then came what were evidently
referring to me. 'Heard W-k speak at Woodville'&mdash;'Met W-k
with L.B.'&mdash;'W-k came home at 11.45 to-night.'</p>

<p>Exactly&mdash;he spied upon everyone, as I thought. I turned
over several more pages and found a lot about Boulter on one.
Boulter's name was written in full&mdash;no doubt to distinguish
him from other people whose names commenced with B.</p>

<p>I read on. "People Boulter knows," went on the diary, and
then followed a lot of names with mine, of course, among the
first. "People Boulter's dog knows," and my name again was near
the top of the list. I could easily follow the drift of the
fellow's thoughts. He was thinking about the rabbits being
killed and was trying to tabulate a list of people who might
possibly have owed Boulter a grudge, and he was trying also to
call up all the people who were friendly with his dog and who
could have entered the back garden that night without being
received with growls or barks. Then came a terse significant
entry. "Told C.C." Yes, that, of course, meant when he went up
to the Chief Commissioner and suggested to him that the slayer
of the rabbits and the terrorizer of the city were one and the
same man. Yes, quite a long shot that, Master Meadows, I
sneered, but a bulls-eye, all the same.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from that diary before my eyes so ached that
I had, at last, to shut it up. As I had surmised, it was Meadows
himself who had found the bicycle, and found it after nine days'
strenuous, one-man search. Then for the last three nights he had
lain expectant with his comrades upon the gravel pit
side&mdash;waiting and waiting for the man who never came.</p>

<p>In a strange sort of way, I felt rather sorry for them all. I
knew so well the horrible surroundings of the pit.</p>

<p>I could picture their vigil even as I sat reading there. They
would be lying prone upon the dark pitside and it would be
blackest night where they all were. It would be hot and sultry
and foul smells would drench the air. There would be a grave-like
silence. Every sense and feeling would be strained, almost
to the breaking point. Every moment they would hope to see a
shadow creeping down, and every moment they would hope to hear
the footfalls of a man picking his way stealthily and with care.
But every moment would bring its disappointment to them. The
shadow they would never see, and the footfall they would never
hear. They would wait and watch in vain.</p>

<p>Fear, too, would be with them all the night&mdash;fear of the
cold, vile reptile creatures, crawling and writhing all around
them, in the pit that was their home. The whole night long death
in its most ghastly form would never be far from them and the
dawn only could bring relief, both from their hopes and from
their fears.</p>

<p>I replaced the book just where I had found it, and, leaving
no traces of my visit, climbed softly out of the room.</p>

<p>I slept badly and brokenly that night and my sleep was full
of disquieting dreams.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, my old confidence had returned, and I
went up to the office thinking of Lucy most of the time.</p>

<p>As I was walking up the railway station stairs in Adelaide, I
met one of the reporters of 'The Register' whom I knew.</p>

<p>"Any news, Mr. Wacks," he asked briskly, "anything good for
copy that you happen to know?"</p>

<p>I shook my head smilingly, and then a thought struck me and I
grinned to myself.</p>

<p>"Well, I've nothing particular to tell you," I said slowly,
"but I can give you an interesting item of general news.
Policeman Sullivan is at present in the Adelaide Hospital,
suffering from snake-bite contracted in the course of some
special duties. You needn't necessarily say that it was I who
told you, but its a fact, and it may interest the public."</p>

<p>He thanked me, and that evening, as I expected, there
appeared a paragraph in the 'Evening Journal,' detailing the
news about the snake-bitten policeman. The police being then
very much in the public eye the 'Journal' people had thought it
quite worth their while to send up a reporter to the hospital
and gather in all the particulars. An innocent young house
surgeon had very amiably obliged, and the reporter had worked up
quite a nice little story for the edification of the 'Journal's'
readers.</p>

<p>I smiled grimly to myself when I read it, and wondered rather
spitefully exactly what particular word the Chief Commissioner
of the Police would make use of when it came to meet his
eye.</p>

<p>That night I got rid of one of my suits of clothes. I had
practically always worn the same suit when I had gone out on my
expeditions at night. It was a suit of very dark grey.</p>

<p>I had been always most careful to sponge off any stains that
had come on it, but as the sponging had generally been done on
the mornings following upon the nights that I had been out, I
was never sure that it had been effective. I was afraid of what
the microscope might reveal.</p>

<p>I had puzzled all day how to get rid of it, but my good
fortune was befriending me.</p>

<p>As I came up our garden that evening, I smelled that Mrs.
Bratt had been burning rubbish in the yard. She had had quite a
good-sized bonfire I saw, and the embers were still glowing,
under the big heap of debris that she had made. As usual, she
had gone off in a great hurry to her sister directly after
preparing my tea, and there was no one about the house.</p>

<p>I made a small bundle of my suit and pushed it well into the
middle of the smouldering heap. It made a nasty smell, but in an
hour or so it was all consumed, and I congratulated myself that
that danger was now over once and for all.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Detective Meadows, I thought, you can just focus
your suspicions when you like. I'm quite ready for you.</p>

<p>I saw him coming in that evening about seven o'clock, and he
looked very sullen and cross.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE LAST CRIME OF WACKS.</h2>

<p class="first">ON the following Saturday I made what
ultimately turned out to be my last attempt at crime, and never
before had I been in such great and deadly peril. At one time it
was any odds on my being captured, and it was only by the most
fortunate combination of circumstances that I escaped at
all.</p>

<p>I had partly got over my fear of Meadows, and in an evil
humor that evening had even boldly carried my bar of iron with
me up to the police head-quarters.</p>

<p>I had long since bound it well round with string at the
handle end, to give a better grip, and I found it fairly easy to
carry, suspended to my side just under my left arm.</p>

<p>They were all down in the dumps again at Victoria Square,
where the police head-quarters were situated. The paragraph in
the 'Journal' about Policeman Sullivan's snake bite had made the
Chief Commissioner wild with rage, and for the last few days he
had hardly spoken to me, although he had seen me several
times.</p>

<p>I neither knew nor cared whether he was aware that the
information had come through me. He should have treated me with
more confidence, I argued, and it served him right.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock I got on the tram for Prospect, with no
particular definite object in my mind. I felt the lust of blood
upon me, however, and was quite reckless of any danger I might
run.</p>

<p>I went the full tram journey, and for quite half an hour
wandered aimlessly about the roads. I kept a good eye out for my
patrols, and dodged three of them when I saw them coming.</p>

<p>Presently I turned off into a small side road, and almost
immediately came upon what thrilled me with a terrible joy.</p>

<p>A man was sleeping on an outside verandah, and he had left
the small glow-worm electric light burning directly over his
head. I could see his face quite plainly.</p>

<p>He had evidently been reading, and had apparently read
himself to sleep. He was a fat-faced, jovial-looking man, and
somehow reminded me of Waller.</p>

<p>I looked round. Everything was quiet, and there was not a
soul in sight. I gently opened the gate.</p>

<p>I pulled my cap hard down over my eyes, and, holding my
deadly weapon handy, crept stealthily up the path.</p>

<p>Then three totally unexpected things happened.</p>

<p>A bulldog rushed at me from under the bed, the man sprang up
instantly and covered me with a revolver, and I heard a motor
coming up the road.</p>

<p>The dog I downed with one furious and fortunate blow that
crashed his head in, even before he had touched me, but the man
on the verandah was a very different type of customer.</p>

<p>He blazed twice at me with his revolver before I had bounded
into the shadows, and then it seemed all hell was loose.</p>

<p>A woman screamed inside the house&mdash;the door snapped open
and three men burst out&mdash;the motor ground its brakes and
pulled up dead against where I had just come in&mdash;and the
man with the revolver called out "Hell!" and shouted to everyone
the way I had gone.</p>

<p>I was round the house and down the back garden in a trice,
only to butt against a high wooden fence that was too high and
would have taken me too long to scale.</p>

<p>I doubled back, escaping one of my stumbling pursuers only by
about a foot. He made a grab at me, but I struck him on the
chest. He lurched over backwards and brought down someone else
in his fall.</p>

<p>Then, before they could recover themselves I was back in the
front garden again, but this time on the other side and right
away from the gate.</p>

<p>A man was standing at the gate, holding it closed, and the
staring headlights from the car showed up everything and made
the road as light as day.</p>

<p>I crouched behind a clump of bushes, not knowing what to do.
My escape was apparently cut off in all directions. The fence
was too high to get over anywhere&mdash;behind me were the three
or four men I had just evaded. In front stood the other man
blocking the only sure way of getting back into the road.
Luckily for me, and it was the only piece of good fortune so
far, the clump of bushes behind which I crouched was in the
deepest shadow, and I was quite invisible to the man standing by
the gate.</p>

<p>I waited, however, without any sense of fear&mdash;only in a
cold, fierce rage at being trapped. Round came my pursuers from
the back of the house.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" shouted the man with the revolver excitedly.
"He can't have got away. I heard him yell; I must have winged
him anyhow."</p>

<p>The man at the gate was rather confused. He was dressed as a
chauffeur. He replied that he didn't think anyone had come
out&mdash;they certainly hadn't come out since he had been
there, but he didn't exactly know what it was all about.</p>

<p>"It's the MAN we've got here, you silly ass&mdash;the
murderer," the shooter yelled. "He was going to bash me, just as
he's bashed poor Boxer here. But he can't have got
away&mdash;he's in the bushes somewhere&mdash;spread out, boys,
quick&mdash;look out for his iron, though."</p>

<p>It was all up with me, I thought, and only the matter of a
short and bloody fight before the end.</p>

<p>Then an idea struck me. If only I could divert their
attention for even half a minute I might stand a chance of
getting out into the road.</p>

<p>I grasped my bit of iron firmly by the end, and, swinging it
furiously twice round my head, hurled it fiercely in the
direction of the house right on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>There was a second's silence, and then a resounding crash of
splintered glass. I had hit a window somewhere.</p>

<p>"There he is," shouted someone hoarsely. "He's got over the
road into Mr. Webber's&mdash;after him, all of you, quick."</p>

<p>They rushed pell-mell through the gate, and I was about to
follow them when two other men came running out of the house
next door, and planted themselves deliberately right in front of
where I should have to pass.</p>

<p>"Don't all of you go in," called out one of them sharply.
"Someone stop in the road. He may double back, and we shall see
in which direction he's gone."</p>

<p>"Damn them!" I swore. "Someone's got some sense at last." I
ran softly round, intending to try the back garden again, but
whistles began sounding in all directions, and I heard voices on
the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>I stood hesitating for quite half a minute and then, hearing
footsteps coming up the gravel in both directions, in sheer
desperation shinned up one of the verandah posts and got softly
on to the roof of the house.</p>

<p>For a moment I thought it was absolutely the very worst place
for hiding I could have chosen, and then&mdash;I realised it
might perhaps be the very best.</p>

<p>At first sight there was apparently no cover for even a cat
to hide. The corrugated iron roof just sloped up one side and
down the other. All the way round, at the foot of the sloping
roof there was a flat lead-sheeted gutter about a foot wide.
This gutter was quite unprotected and open, and a sparrow even
could not have found a hiding place there. Just over the front
door, however, there was a piece of ornamental wood lintel, at
the most ten inches high.</p>

<p>I wondered instantly if, by squeezing myself flat upon the
lead guttering, this piece of wood lintel would hide me from the
observation of anyone on the ground. At any rate, it was my only
hope, and, stretched out at full length, I breathlessly regarded
the operations below through a crack in the wood.</p>

<p>There was tremendous excitement going on and, in the short
time that had elapsed since the first alarm had been given, all
the neighborhood seemed to have gathered in the road.</p>

<p>A second motor-car had arrived, and they were detaching the
supplementary oil lamps to search thoroughly through all the
gardens round.</p>

<p>Several of my armletted patrols were in the crowd, and even
in my dreadful plight, I felt proud that we had beaten the
regular police.</p>

<p>I heard the telephone going inside the house. It was the man
with the revolver speaking to the police station. I was startled
to hear how close his voice sounded. He was just underneath me
in the hall. He told a very bumptious tale.</p>

<p>He had got the murderer for sure, if they came quick. Mr. Sam
Podsley, he was, and number eight, Angas Terrace, was his
address. No, they hadn't actually got hold of the man, but they
had taken his weapon and he was surrounded somewhere in the
block of houses. He couldn't possibly get away, and he couldn't
run far in any case for he had winged him with his revolver. He
was a dead shot.</p>

<p>I heard the telephone ring off sharply, and then there was a
perfect babel of voices in the garden. They were handing round
my iron bar for inspection, and everyone wanted to see it
close.</p>

<p>"Now, you fellows," shouted the revolver man truculently,
"don't waste time looking at that thing now. We'll have plenty
of time to examine that when we've got the handcuffs on our man.
The police will be here in two shakes, but let's truss him up
before they come. He must be somewhere in the block, and he's
not got a dog's chance of getting away. Flash all the lights
round now, quick."</p>

<p>Round and round came the detached lamps, flashing in every
direction. The bushes were trampled through most thoroughly, and
I thanked my stars gratefully that my footprints must have been
very effectually blotted out.</p>

<p>Everyone who passed flashed his lamp for a second on the
roof, but my strip of lintel seemed so hopelessly small and low
that no one for a second gave a thought as to whether it could
hide a man. Lying flat up there, I thought what asses they all
were, but when, a couple of days later, I came to examine the
house in clear and broad daylight, I quite understood the
mistake they had made.</p>

<p>From the ground the woodwork didn't look six inches high, and
I marvelled to myself how it could have hid me there.</p>

<p>Presently a great white light came in the sky, and two big
long police cars discharged quite a score of uniformed and
un-uniformed members of the force.</p>

<p>Inspector Wedlake was in charge and, quickly put in
possession of all the facts, he began to swear in true policeman
fashion.</p>

<p>"Come out of the garden, all of you blank ninnies standing
there. Haven't any of you got any more sense than that? How the
devil do you think we're going to find that man's tracks out of
all the footmarks there? Come out, I say."</p>

<p>The crowd filed out quickly and the policemen were soon the
only ones in possession of the scene.</p>

<p>The man with the revolver was cross-examined sharply by the
Inspector. He was most voluble and most minute in all his
details.</p>

<p>"This is where I was lying," he explained delightedly, "and
this is where Boxer was killed. He saw the man first and
growled. He ran at him at once. I caught sight of him just as he
hit Boxer on the head. I let fly at him on the second, and
winged him somewhere, for I heard the beggar yell. He jumped
quite a foot into the air. Then he tore round the house. We ran
after him but he dodged back and somehow got over the road. He
broke in the window there, with his iron. Then we couldn't find
him, but he can't have got away for there is no escape on either
side at the back. The walls are too high there&mdash;and not a
mouse has crossed the road. For certain, he's now in the gardens
somewhere."</p>

<p>The chauffeur was next quickly handled. He looked a fool and
the Inspector was soon glaring angrily at him. The tale, he told
was very muddled. Yes&mdash;he had been standing by the gate all
the time, almost from the very first second when the revolver
had been fired. The murderer must have run very quickly across
the road. No&mdash;he didn't actually see him run. In fact, he
hadn't seen anyone run. What he meant was&mdash;that if he had
really run he didn't know how he could have done it at all, for
he had been watching the road all the time. No&mdash;he wasn't
drunk and he wasn't making anything up. He didn't care who asked
him anything if they asked him politely, and he didn't mind now
who heard him say&mdash;"Blast the police!" He was
disgusted.</p>

<p>All this took place exactly below me, and right before the
front door. I heard all the instructions given to the policemen,
and for three hours they hunted incessantly in and out and all
about the gardens of the adjoining houses.</p>

<p>The police were puzzled and frankly said so. The cordon had
been drawn so quickly and so closely round the entire terrace
that they couldn't possibly make out how I had got away.</p>

<p>"Wait till morning," at last snarled Inspector Wedlake, "and
we'll go through every bally inch of the whole place with a
tooth-comb. Meanwhile, everyone's to keep his place and not a
living soul's to cross out over the cordon."</p>

<p>Soon after midnight Meadows himself arrived, and it made me
shudder to see his cold set face under the half light. His eyes
glared with vicious determination.</p>

<p>"If we lose him this time, Inspector," he whispered hoarsely,
"the Chief will never forgive us. It's the right man now, if it
never was before; that string-bound iron's an eye opener at
last."</p>

<p>There were few people about Angas Terrace that night who
could have slept a wink.</p>

<p>To begin with there were the people in the house. Save for
two little boys, who I gathered from the conversation going on
inside&mdash;and I could plainly hear every word that was
said&mdash;had gone off to sleep again almost at once&mdash;no
one could have taken their clothes off, even if they had lain
down at all.</p>

<p>In the dining-room below, there was a continual noise of
rattling glasses and drawing corks all night long. All the
police in turn must have come in for a 'wad,' and the
talk&mdash;oh, the talk! The fat brute with the revolver was
boasting and yapping from midnight until dawn. He told his
beastly rotten tale over and over again until every word of it
was as familiar to me as my own name. He had been sleeping on
his right side. Boxer's growl had awakened him in a
sweat&mdash;he had seized his revolver and fired twice&mdash;he
had winged me once for sure&mdash;I had yelled like hell, and I
had jumped a good foot in the air, &amp;c. Thank goodness,
someone else got sick of it besides me, and at last he was told
to shut up.</p>

<p>"Oh, curse you&mdash;Podsley," I heard a sleepy voice say,
"we're damn sick of your rotten yarn. I don't believe you hit
him at all. How the devil did the blighter get away if you put
all the lead in him that you say you did? I believe it was Boxer
you hit after all. You killed your own bally dog, old
man&mdash;that's what you did&mdash;so shut up."</p>

<p>Then followed a long and bitter argument that, in the end,
was almost as boring as the shooting episode itself.</p>

<p>The police, too, could have had no sort of rest at all. All
night long numbers were pacing the road&mdash;never more than a
dozen yards from one another. They talked in gruff voices and
repeatedly wished for the morning, when everything wonderful was
going to happen, and I should be taken, without doubt. They
cursed the people in the house for a lot of muddlers to have let
me get away at all, and gave it as their opinion that it would
be a hanging matter for half the police if I weren't caught this
time.</p>

<p>Then there was myself. I know I never slept. I was listening
and listening the whole night long. I was in a bitter agony of
mortification, and fear, too, was now creeping like a cold palsy
over my mind. What chance of escape had I now, and when I was
taken what would it all mean? I should be hanged for certain,
and what would become of Lucy then? She would be branded for
ever because of my love, and every kiss I had given her would
leave its dark memory of dreadful shame. Why&mdash;oh, why had I
ever touched the paste. I had never dreamed of things like this.
It was Fate that had turned my steps this awful way. I was only
a pawn in her dreadful game.</p>

<p>The night was long and terrible for me, and yet in contrast
such a perfect night it was, too. Starry and beautiful, in such
a wondrous sky. The air was warm and mild and everything spoke
of peace and quiet, with the tired world resting in its
dreams.</p>

<p>Just as the dawn came I believe I must have been almost on
the point of dropping asleep. At any rate, I know I had got my
eyes shut, and had partly forgotten my surroundings.
Suddenly&mdash;so suddenly that I remember jerking myself upon
my elbow to listen&mdash;I heard a sound that froze the very
marrow in my spine. It was the baying of a dog. A deep-throated
hollow sound like a dog moaning in a cave. All my faculties were
alive in an instant. Then it came again&mdash;mournful and
hollow, but with dreadful menace in its tone.</p>

<p>A policeman in the road called out briskly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here they are, mates&mdash;the bloodhounds at last."</p>

<p>The bloodhounds&mdash;of course! The terror of it struck me
like a blow&mdash;I had not thought of them. The police were
bringing them up to put them on my trail. They had got my iron
bar now, and that would give them for the first time the scent
they were needing to follow.</p>

<p>I lay back in a muck sweat, with my teeth chattering
horribly. Dawn comes very quickly in Australia, and within five
minutes of first hearing the hounds I saw the two of them
brought up in leash to the other side of the road, just in front
of the house.</p>

<p>They were terrible looking beasts, with huge flopping ears
and large bloodshot eyes. Two men were in charge of them and
holding them back with thick leathern straps.</p>

<p>Early as it was, a little half-dressed crowd had already
collected from the adjoining houses.</p>

<p>"Everybody keep away from the hounds," shouted one of the
keepers angrily. "This isn't a picture stunt, and we don't want
any help either. We want perfect quiet, too, please." The crowd
obediently edged a little away and stopped talking among
themselves.</p>

<p>A milk cart came clattering up and stopped noisily, right in
front of the gate. There was a little fox terrier on the seat,
and catching sight of the bloodhounds, it started to bark
furiously.</p>

<p>"Stop that dog," roared one of the men; "take it away. It'll
spoil everything. Take it off&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>The flustered milkman leaned over savagely to seize the
animal, but losing his balance he banged up against one of his
large milk cans and, in a second, a generous torrent of milk was
pouring into the road.</p>

<p>"Oh, you damned fool," shrieked the keeper, now wild with
rage. "If that milk gets on them, all the scent will be lost.
Get out of it&mdash;you idiot&mdash;take your horse away."</p>

<p>A dozen willing pairs of hands quickly bundled the milkman
and his cart away, but the bloodhounds had smelt the milk and
were anxious for a closer acquaintance with it.</p>

<p>"Come on, Pluto, you brute," swore the keeper. "Now then," to
the other man, "keep Jezebel away. Pull her back, right
over."</p>

<p>There was a lot of shouting and expostulating and, finally,
the two big animals were given my iron bar to smell, and
encouraged to pick up the trail.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Pluto&mdash;find it now," coaxed the keeper. "Nose
it, Jezebel&mdash;nose it now."</p>

<p>Pluto lifted his great muzzle interestedly and was making
strenuous efforts to come across the road. He pulled and tugged,
but his keeper wouldn't let him go, and kept drawing him back to
the footpath, in front of the broken window.</p>

<p>"It's that damned milk he's after," he explained savagely;
"once he's lapped it, we may as well take him home. Oh, good
girl, Jezebel&mdash;good girl."</p>

<p>Jezebel had smelt something, for with her head low down, she
was running backwards and forwards on the path by the side of
the road. I remembered, with a pang of fear, that it was there I
had stood for a few seconds before I had crossed the road to
slink up the garden after the man asleep on the verandah.</p>

<p>It was an agonising moment for me&mdash;which way would the
great beast go? Would she try, like her mate had done, to cross
the road, or would she follow my trail back along the way I had
come from the Prospect tram?</p>

<p>I could see everything so plainly through the crack in the
wood. She ran backwards and forwards for about a minute and
then, to my great joy, with a deep throated bay, started pulling
hard in the direction away from the house.</p>

<p>The crowd gave a little encouraging cheer, and Pluto now
shambling contentedly after her, they both disappeared out of my
sight up the road.</p>

<p>Most of the crowd followed excitedly after them, and, for a
moment, I hoped that I might get down and escape in the
confusion.</p>

<p>But no, to my dismay not a policeman had moved, and all down
the road I could see them keeping their allotted stations just
as they had done through out the entire night.</p>

<p>The Inspector was taking no chances, I thought.</p>

<p>For two hours I lay wondering what had happened, and then
news began to filter through. From the remarks I picked up from
the policemen and the people standing about, the bloodhounds
were not proving quite a success.</p>

<p>They had got to the shelter from where the trams
started&mdash;they had lost the scent altogether&mdash;they had
followed a milk cart&mdash;they wouldn't leave a butcher's shop,
and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a big crowd had gathered in the road in
front of the house. Somehow the news had quickly got about, and
on foot and in all sorts of conveyances they had hurried to the
spot. Bicycles, motor cars and carts had all been pressed into
service, and soon spectators were standing ten and twelve deep
on the footpath gaping curiously at the house.</p>

<p>The police were furious, but the crowd was too great to
handle easily, and they had to be content with keeping them out
of the garden in front.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the baying of the dogs again. They were
being brought back to pick up another trail. In a scene of
intense excitement, a way was opened through the crowd and they
were brought straight into the garden, just under where I
lay.</p>

<p>My heart was thumping terribly in my chest, and I could
hardly breathe. The great beasts smelt something at once. They
tore excitedly round and round the house, and sniffed about in
every place where I had been. Time after time they nosed to the
verandah post, up which I had climbed to get on the roof, but
every time, directly they came there, they were immediately
pulled roughly back.</p>

<p>I had killed the bulldog just under there and his blood was
still dark and red upon the gravel.</p>

<p>"For the Lord's sake they mustn't lick that blood," implored
the head keeper; "if they touch it once, they'll never scent
anything again. Some of you men stand round it, please. Pull
them back hard now."</p>

<p>A little sheltering group stood round the post, and, my
confidence now returning, I smiled amusedly to myself at the
protection I was receiving.</p>

<p>The dogs had a long stay near the bushes where I had hid, and
then nosed off to the gate. The road had been entirely cleared
of sight-seers now, just in front of the house, and the beasts
ambled out to and fro over the path. But they were always at
fault at once, and returned inside. Again and again they went
from the verandah post to the gate, but the milk&mdash;trodden
all over the place by then&mdash;evidently fogged them, and they
only bayed hoarsely and turned round.</p>

<p>For quite half an hour they were kept smelling round the
house but nothing happened, except that they invariably made
straight for the verandah post.</p>

<p>"Curse that blood," said the head bloodhound man at last,
"and curse the milk, too. Everything's against us. If it hadn't
been for that milk, we should have been straight on him by now.
It's no good going on. The scent in this garden's as strong as
hell, I'm dead sure of that. But what's the good if it leads
nowhere? Directly they get into the road the scent's gone."</p>

<p>In great disappointment, the bloodhounds were at length led
away, and a few minutes later a sort of conference was held just
by the front door. Six or seven of the heads of the police were
there.</p>

<p>Inspector Wedlake looked tired, white, and angry. "What are
we to tell the Chief when he comes back tonight?" he asked
savagely. "Same old tale he'll say&mdash;had him actually in
your hands and you let him go. He'll be jolly pleasant, I can
see."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't our fault, Inspector," said another voice.
"We can't catch him if he isn't here, can we?"</p>

<p>"But he must be here," replied the Inspector irritably. "If
there's any truth in what these men say, he never got out of the
garden of these two houses. I don't understand it. We've gone
through every inch of the place."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got his weapon now," said the other shortly.
"He's lost his mascot, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What's that to us?" was the sneering reply; "we can't hang
his bit or iron, can we?"</p>

<p>I saw Meadows standing there. He said nothing, but he was
looking very glum.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the order was passed round for the police
to go. Meadows was the last to leave. When he got to the garden
gate, he turned round and for quite a couple of minutes stood
looking thoughtfully at the house. His eyes roved over every
part of it, and for a moment I was terrified that, in that last
second, he might unravel all. But no&mdash;just when I had fully
made up my mind that he was coming back, he shrugged his
shoulders disappointedly and turned off down the road.</p>

<p>But if with the departure of the police I had thought my
troubles were to be all over, I soon found I was greatly
mistaken. I had only exchanged one set of troubles for
another.</p>

<p>It began to get hot, terribly hot. The sun shone down with
awful violence upon the roof and I had no shelter for my head
from its burning rays.</p>

<p>I stood it as long as I could and then, in desperation, I
took out my pocket knife and started cutting softly at the lead
gutter to bend a piece up.</p>

<p>To my delight it cut very easily, and in a few minutes I had
turned up quite a long piece and made an arch of it over my head
and part of my back.</p>

<p>I had to be very careful and make no noise, for I was exactly
over the hall, and in one corner where the plaster had broken
away I found I could see right in through the dining-room
ventilator, on to the dining-room table itself.</p>

<p>I was very thirsty by now and it exasperated me most
intensely to see some tumblers and a nice cool jug of what
looked like lemonade.</p>

<p>They started laying the table in preparation for dinner, and
from time to time all the members of the family came within my
range of view. There were two little boys, one about six, and
the other some years older. They were both of them evidently
immensely impressed with the importance their home had suddenly
assumed in the public eye.</p>

<p>"Will Daddy's picture be in the newspapers, Mummy?" asked the
younger one between vigorous bites at a large succulent looking
pear.</p>

<p>"I expect so, dear&mdash;it may be."</p>

<p>"Will mine be in, too. Mummy? I might have been killed as
well as Daddy." The child's mother assured him that possibly all
their photos would be in next week, and a few minutes later rang
the bell vigorously for dinner.</p>

<p>The fat man carved and I had a good view through the
ventilator. There was a big joint of beef and delicious
brown-looking gravy. There was also a big, fine bottle of cool lager
beer that I heard had just come straight off the ice. They
evidently had visitors, for the fat man, between huge mouthfuls
of potatoes and beef, reeled off his same rotten tale.</p>

<p>"I fired twice&mdash;winged him for sure&mdash;he yelled like
hell&mdash;jumped a foot in the air," &amp;c.</p>

<p>I shut my eyes and groaned. My hunger and thirst were a
torment to me, and this fat beast, with his perfect contentment
of drink and food, quite put the cap on my misery&mdash;I could
have killed him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there were more visitors, more "I fired
twice"&mdash;more lager beer, and, oh heavens!&mdash;cups of
tea.</p>

<p>The sun was pitiless and my eyes began to swim in faint and
heat. Suddenly, as in a flash, there came to me the distinct
memory of green leaves upon the trellis round the hall door. My
mind went back to that second when I had first suggested to
myself that the lintel over the door might give me the hiding
place that I required. Yes&mdash;I was sure there had been
leaves there, and big leaves, too. Oh, if only they grew upon a
vine.</p>

<p>I turned over on my side and, quite mad with suffering,
stretched my arm down recklessly over the wall. Almost
instantly, to my amazement, I touched a bunch of grapes. I tore
it off anyhow and in a second was crunching the sweetest grapes
that ever passed through mortal lips. It was quite a large bunch
I had pulled up and although I could, of course, have eaten
more, I was refreshed beyond measure when I had consumed
them.</p>

<p>I felt quite a different being almost at once, and hope and
confidence began to revive. I would diddle them yet, I thought,
and I had only now to wait till dusk to slip down and get
away.</p>

<p>Before dusk&mdash;I knew it would be quite hopeless. All day
long, on and off, curious little groups had gathered in the
front of the house, staring with eyes as big as saucers.</p>

<p>I didn't know what the silly fools expected to see, but they
evidently derived some sort of morbid pleasure, gaping at a
place where an attempted murder had occurred.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, thank goodness, the sun went in and
clouds began to gather for a shower of rain. All good fortune
seemed now to be coming my way, but&mdash;I found there was yet
another peril to get over.</p>

<p>A good many times during the day I had noticed a pretty pair
of pigeons flying round about the roof. They had made several
attempts to alight on the gutter near by, but each time, seeing
me, they had shied off in swift and startled curves.</p>

<p>Just about five, the little boy Jack came out into the garden
with the fat man and, with the strange observance of little
children, noticed at once that something was wrong.</p>

<p>"Why don't my pigeons sit down today, Daddy?" he asked.
"Kafferleen won't tum near the roof."</p>

<p>"Oh, blow your pigeons," his father replied brusquely; "a
jolly good thing if they don't. They only fill up the gutters
with their rubbish and bits of straw. They want their necks
broken, I say."</p>

<p>The little boy ignored his father's lack of interest, and his
mother coming out presently, he tried plaintively to enlist her
sympathy in his distress.</p>

<p>"Mummy, I fink Kafferleen's got a sore toe, like wot I had
the other day. She won't sit on the roof with Joe."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I don't think it's that," his mother comforted,
"the poor birdies have been so frightened by all the noise we've
had today. Tomorrow they'll be quite all right again, you'll
see."</p>

<p>The little boy looked puzzled still, but, thank goodness, at
the suggestion of his mother, went in to get his tea.</p>

<p>Just as dusk was drawing down it began to rain.</p>

<p>The last remaining spectators in the road cleared off and
someone inside the house started a noisy jazz tune on the
gramophone.</p>

<p>Now was my opportunity, I thought. I crawled painfully along
the gutter to the verandah post, and, with great difficulty,
slid down it to the ground.</p>

<p>I was so stiff and cramped that for quite two minutes I could
only stand and cling helplessly to the post. Then I started
vigorously to rub down my legs and the blood soon began to flow
easily again.</p>

<p>I hobbled slowly and very softly to the gate, devoutly hoping
no one would come out of the house as I was on my way. I was
almost safe now, I knew, but even at that last moment misfortune
still tried to throw another hand against me. Just when a few
yards from the garden gate, it clicked open and a man came in. I
pulled myself painfully erect and gave an off-hand good-night.
He replied shortly and passed by, but I saw him turn round to
stare inquisitively before he reached the house. He couldn't
have seen much of me in the dark, I knew. I thought it must have
been the whiteness of my face that interested him.</p>

<p>Directly I got into the road I bustled along quickly and it
was with an intense sigh of relief that I finally settled myself
in a corner of the Prospect tram.</p>

<p>I was too tired and worn out to rejoice much. I was
wondering, now, what on earth I could say to Mrs. Bratt. I had
never been away all day before without giving her notice, and
how to explain my general bedraggled appearance I couldn't
think.</p>

<p>When I reached home, however, I found all the place locked up
and I had to use my key to get in. I switched on the lights and,
with great astonishment, found everything exactly as I had left
it the previous evening after tea. Mrs. Bratt, I realised,
couldn't have been in at all since the previous afternoon.
Depressed and tired as I was, I chuckled happily to myself. Even
the stars in their courses were now fighting for me, I thought,
and if Meadows at any time suspected me, he would never get the
slightest inkling from Mrs. Bratt of what I had been doing
during the past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>I got myself together some sort of scratch meal and turning
into bed, without any desire at all for my usual dose of paste,
slept heavily and thankfully the whole night long.</p>

<p>Next morning early, Mrs. Bratt brought me the usual cup of
tea. She was red-eyed, weeping and apologetic. Her sister had
died the previous afternoon, and all day she had never left the
sick room. She was sure I would understand.</p>

<p>I tried to be as nice as possible to the old girl, and told
her quite truthfully, too, that she had done perfectly right in
stopping away.</p>

<p>She hadn't seen anything of Meadows, I heard.</p>

<p>I went up to the office soberly and quietly that morning.
Something, I felt, had happened to me, but I hadn't had time to
realise what it was, yet.</p>

<p>I met Waller just as I was going in, and to my astonishment
found myself speaking nicely and friendly to him. I asked him
how the gee-gees were going and told him I wished I could find
another winner like The Boss.</p>

<p>He seemed quite embarrassed with my attention, and I almost
fancy addressed me in parting as "Sir."</p>

<p>Soon after I had settled down to work, Mr. William came into
my room for a chat. He was very interested in the affair at
Prospect, and suggested our both going up to the house to have a
look. He said he would drive me up just before lunch in his
car.</p>

<p>My heart began to beat furiously directly he mentioned it,
but I couldn't well refuse and, in a way, I was anxious to go
myself. I wanted to understand more fully than I did how I had
been able to evade all the perils that I had been faced
with.</p>

<p>Arriving at the house just before one we could not possibly
have come at a more awkward time.</p>

<p>The very moment I opened the garden gate several people at
once came out of the front door, and in a second I recognised
the Chief Commissioner of the Police, Inspector Wedlake and
Meadows. There was also a reporter from 'The Register,' a press
photographer, and the master of the house&mdash;the fat man with
the revolver.</p>

<p>Evidently they had been taking the Chief over the scene
immediately upon his return to the city from Eudunda.</p>

<p>He smiled rather spitefully when he saw me.</p>

<p>"Ah, now," he called out loudly, "now we shall know
everything. Here's our sapient friend, Mr. Peter Wacks. He'll
explain everything to us for sure. You haven't met Mr. Wacks,
Mr. Podsley. Mr. Sam Podsley, Mr. Peter Wacks," and he
introduced us with a mocking assumption of great regard.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Wacks," said the fat man cordially
and extending a large, flabby hand. "I wish we'd had you here on
Saturday, I do. You'd have helped us then, I'm sure. I've heard
you speak several times and I know a man when I see one."</p>

<p>I introduced Mr. William and we all stood round.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Wacks, aren't you going to do anything for us?"
went on the Chief still mocking. "We confess we're quite at a
standstill now." The Chief's sneering words had a very strange
effect on me. I had come up to the house almost timid and
trembling. Somehow I had got all the kick taken out of me and I
just loathed the whole crime business as much as the most
nervous creature in the city. But the Chief struck an old chord
in me and my anger rose at his contempt. I looked at him
coldly.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered nothing at all then?" I asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, sir," interrupted the fat man volubly,
delighted evidently at the prospect of a new audience. "We're
just as much out-generalled now as we have been all along from
the very first moment when we saw him."</p>

<p>"You saw him plainly?" I asked interestedly.</p>

<p>"Quite plainly, He's a spare sort of man like you. It was
like this. That's where I was lying, and that's where Boxer was
killed. He saw the man first and growled. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I shut my eyes and mentally groaned. It was the same awful
tale I had heard so many times through my agony on the roof. He
recited it again, word for word, like a horrible litany and now
it was stringing up my nerves almost to breaking point.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," I interrupted irritably, at last unable to
bear it any more, "but who saw him get into the house over the
way?"</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;that's it," he exclaimed excitedly. "No one
saw him. He got over with a man staring up and down the road all
the time. No one saw him leave the garden even."</p>

<p>"Well, then, he never left it&mdash;that's clear."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;man&mdash;the window there&mdash;he broke the
window."</p>

<p>"His bit of iron broke it, you mean. He needn't have been
there. Why couldn't he have thrown the thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but he couldn't aim as straight as that; besides, look
at the distance."</p>

<p>I sniffed contemptuously and looked across to the house
opposite.</p>

<p>"Bah!&mdash;the distance is nothing with the curved iron he
used. Nothing would have been easier than for him to have thrown
it across. I don't suppose for a moment he aimed at the window.
It was just chance that he hit it. Good gracious, if he were
trying to escape and had got into the garden there, surely the
very last thing he would have wanted to do would have been to
advertise the fact. He wouldn't want to start breaking windows
and bring everyone down on him in a rush."</p>

<p>They all stared very hard at me and the fat man hummed and
hawed in a rather crestfallen sort of way.</p>

<p>"Well, what the devil did happen?" he said at length.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that," I replied still irritably, "but tell
me&mdash;what exactly were you doing when you heard the crash of
the breaking glass."</p>

<p>"We were looking for him here."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I know that&mdash;but where exactly were you?
I mean where were you in the garden here?"</p>

<p>He thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no difficulty at all in remembering that. We
were stretched out in a line, over there on the lawn. There were
four of us and we thought the beggar was hiding in those bushes
in the dark. I had just shouted to them to walk up carefully
when&mdash;bang went the window opposite and off we rushed."</p>

<p>"And if you hadn't rushed off," I went on, "in another
quarter of a minute or so you would have been round those bushes
and laid hands on anyone if he were hiding there?"</p>

<p>"Jolly sure we should, and given him hell, too."</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;and no doubt our friend realised that, if he
were in those bushes, as he probably was. So he just threw his
iron over to take your unpleasant attentions away and off you
all went, like a pack of goats. It's as plain as the roof of
this house. You bungled badly there."</p>

<p>The fat man again looked very crestfallen and didn't seem to
know exactly how to make any reply, but the Chief, who had put
up a great affectation of being very bored, came to his rescue
promptly.</p>

<p>"There, what did I tell you?" he said sarcastically. "I was
quite sure Mr. Wacks would unravel all. In a few minutes we
shall be knowing everything&mdash;even the rascal's name and
address."</p>

<p>But the fat man was thinking deeply. "By Jove, sir," he said,
quite respectfully to me at last. "I do believe you're right.
But still," and his voice took on a triumphant tone again, "if
he was in the garden as you say&mdash;how the devil did he get
out again?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say he did get out," I replied bluntly. "I believe
that when your backs were turned he just hid here."</p>

<p>"But where, man, where? Not an inch was left unturned. We all
searched everywhere."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders as if the matter had nothing to do
with me and the Chief again broke in sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Stumped, Mr. Wacks, stumped like we poor policemen
here!"</p>

<p>"Well, Chief," I replied smiling, "it strikes me this way. If
he was in here and didn't get out of here and yet couldn't be
found&mdash;well, then, it follows naturally that he must have
hidden somewhere. He couldn't vanish like air&mdash;now could
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Mr. Wacks," asked the fat man still politely,
evidently chastened by the passage of arms we had already had,
"where on earth could he have hid&mdash;where was there we
didn't look and the police here as well?"</p>

<p>I made to cast my eyes round carelessly over me place.</p>

<p>"What about the roof?" I asked sharply. "Did you search
there?"</p>

<p>"No good," he grinned bluntly. "We could see if a cat was
there, from the ground."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know so much about that," I went on stubbornly.
"What about the lintel over the door here, for instance? I'm
sure there'd be good hiding there for a spare man, such as I,
for instance. There's a good ten inches anyhow, and that's quite
enough if he lay down close."</p>

<p>There was a sudden dead, hard silence after I had said this,
and I could hear more than one person take in a deep breath. I
didn't dare myself to look straight at them, and inwardly I
cursed my folly for beginning such a dangerous game. It was only
the sneers of the Chief Commissioner that had egged me on.</p>

<p>It was the fat man who first recovered himself&mdash;perhaps
because he had less at stake than any of the others.</p>

<p>"But how the devil could he have got up there," he asked,
"even if he did?"</p>

<p>"Easy as pot," I sneered contemptuously. "Why&mdash;as I
stand here now I can see scratches plainly on the verandah post
there."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, and that's where the bloodhounds went every
time," he almost cried. "The men kept pulling them back because
they thought it was poor old Boxer's blood they were
after&mdash;Oh my hat! My hat!"</p>

<p>Again, there was a tense and awkward silence. The wire door
pushed suddenly open and the little boy Jack ran out.</p>

<p>"Daddy," he called out in his pretty childish voice, "Daddy,
my pigeons is all right today. Kafferleen's been sitting on the
roof again with Joe, all this morning."</p>

<p>"Darn that kid," shouted his father in great excitement. "He
knew that something was wrong yesterday. All day long, he kept
whining that his damned birds wouldn't go near the roof anyhow,
and I guess now we know why. Yes," he shouted in still more
excitement, "and I'm a dead man if someone hasn't been and
sneaked a big bunch of grapes off the top&mdash;off the top,
mind you. Bring out the steps quickly, Maria&mdash;we'll soon
find out."</p>

<p>I had perfect command of myself now, and I set my face
rigidly for the explosion that I knew was coming.</p>

<p>I looked round coolly and took in the varying expressions of
them all.</p>

<p>The Chief was frowning sternly. The sneering banter had all
left him now, and he looked worried and annoyed.</p>

<p>Inspector Wedlake looked far more than annoyed. He was
positively frightened, and breathed heavily like a man about to
undergo some fearful punishment.</p>

<p>Meadows&mdash;well, Meadows was cold and impenetrable as
ever, but I fancied his eyes had an evil gleam. He too, sensed
something of what was about to come.</p>

<p>There was a minute's waiting and a high pair of steps was
banged and bumped out of the front door and finally placed in
position. The fat man went up in a rush and, clinging to the
lintel, looked over the top.</p>

<p>"Lord! Lord!" he almost shrieked. "The man was here right
enough. He's torn up all the lead and there's grape skins all
over the place."</p>

<p>On a sign from the Chief, Meadows squeezed up the steps, too.
He got right on to the roof at once and, after a moment's
intense looking round, beckoned grimly to the Chief to come
up.</p>

<p>The fat man made way and, for three or four minutes Meadows
and the Chief stood whispering on the roof. Then they came down
and we all of us in turn mounted the steps and looked
over&mdash;I with a heart that I know was almost bursting with
the bitter memories that surged up.</p>

<p>The reporter went up last. When he came down he shook me
solemnly by the hand and said feelingly, "A most remarkable
piece of deduction, Mr. Wacks. Very fine&mdash;very fine
indeed&mdash;great credit to you."</p>

<p>The Chief heard him speak and turned on me savagely. He was
white and choking and glad to find anyone on whom to vent his
rage. He made no pretence of hiding his dislike, and looked as
if he could have killed me where I stood.</p>

<p>"Yes, very fine, Mr. Whacks," he snarled spitefully, "and
perhaps now&mdash;as you're so fond of poking your nose in
everywhere when it's too late to do any good&mdash;you'll very
kindly oblige with the name of the murderer and his address. In
fact&mdash;as you're so clever you might let us know everything
right from the very beginning, and tell us just who was the
gentleman who killed Boulter's rabbits."</p>

<p>I heard someone draw a deep sharp breath behind me, and,
half-turning, saw that it was Meadows. His mouth was wide open,
and there was a look of sheer and startled amazement on his
face. Incredulity and surprise were struggling for the mastery,
and his eyes seemed bulging from their head. For one second he
had lost control of his thoughts.</p>

<p>I looked at him, startled in my turn, but he saw me looking
and, as in a flash, his face closed down and took on its old
expression of impassive calm. He dropped his eyes to the
ground.</p>

<p>I felt myself trembling. I knew quite well what had happened.
The meaning of everything was clear to him and he was sure now
that the MAN&mdash;was I.</p>

<p>But the Chief was still claiming my attention and his
sneering went on.</p>

<p>"What, run dry, Mr. Wacks?" he asked insistently. "Surely the
source of inspiration hasn't dried up already&mdash;so soon too.
When, pray, did your friend up there get away?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Chief," I said, stirred up at last. "Be a sport
and don't grudge me this little success. You're always down on
us specials, and you never give us any credit for anything we
do. Everything here was as plain as day to a mind that came in
fresh. How the devil you all missed it I don't know! The wretch
up there," I went on, pointing to the roof, "must have lain out
all yesterday under that burning sun and slipped away at dusk
when the rain came on. That seems the first chance he had of
getting away."</p>

<p>"A bull's-eye again, Mr. Wacks," enthusiastically burst in
the fat man, who at that moment had come round the house with a
tray of drinks. "That's just when he did get away and I know for
sure now. A friend of mine&mdash;a chap named
Biggar&mdash;called here yesterday just after dusk and he asked
me later on in the evening who was the white-faced looking
beggar he had met at the gate when he was coming in. I didn't
know what he meant then, but I do now. Lord! Lord! what fools
we've all been. The worst of it was, Biggar couldn't describe
him at all&mdash;it was so dark. All he saw was that the man had
got a white face and limped a bit."</p>

<p>Mr. William and I drove back a few minutes later in the car.
I was greatly relieved it was all over. Of one thing I was fully
determined; that morning should mark the turning point about the
paste. I would never touch the little that was left again.</p>

<p>The newspapers next day were most exciting and a regular
paean of triumph for me.</p>

<p>'The Register' got its knife deeply into the police and made
any amount of cuts, too. It was bitter and sarcastic in its
attack and plainly hinted that a change of personnel at
head-quarters would be a good thing.</p>

<p>It made a fine story of the whole affair at Angas Terrace,
and pictured the perplexities of the official police as being
all cleared up and made plain by a five minutes' touch of my
magic wand.</p>

<p>Strange to say, when I next met the Chief, however, he had
quite recovered his good humor, and remarked with his same old
smile that, after all, perhaps only one lamp-post would be
required, but, enigmatically, he didn't say for which of us it
would be.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE DAY AFTER.</h2>

<p class="first">I SHALL always date the actual hour of my
complete freedom from the slavery of the red paste from that
awful day I spent on the roof.</p>

<p>Whether it was the actual physical torture that I had endured
those long hours under the burning sun, or whether it was the
long and uninterrupted time that I had been given up to the
horror of my own thoughts, I do not know, but at any rate from
that Sunday evening I never had the very slightest desire to
partake of the drug again.</p>

<p>Not only was I quite freed from its desire, but in forty-eight
hours after the last dose was as sane and rational as I
had ever been in my life.</p>

<p>The strange part of it was, too, that it had apparently left
no evil after-effects on my mind. All the dreadful impulses and
desires that had come to me with its use had all utterly passed
away, leaving only the good qualities that I had derived from it
behind.</p>

<p>Like a tornado, it had passed into me, with its mania, its
confidence and its lust of crime, and like a tornado, too, it
had passed away, leaving only its great confidence and strength
behind.</p>

<p>Something of the power and sweetness of life had come to me
in the intervals of that dreadful time, and the grasp I had had
of them I did not relax now that I was sane again.</p>

<p>At first I had no great remorse at all. I was only very sorry
for all the dreadful things that I had done, and very
frightened, too, that I might possibly be found out, but I did
not somehow blame myself. I blamed the drug, and just regarded
myself as an unhappy instrument in the hands of Fate. I believed
it had been ordained that all these crimes should happen, and I
had simply been the unfortunate one chosen to carry them
out.</p>

<p>I was terribly afraid of punishment, because now I had so
much to live for, and I was determined to use to the very utmost
all those new-born faculties that I had acquired to escape the
penalties that I knew would at once follow, were I once found
out.</p>

<p>I was quite aware that Meadows suspected me, and knew it
could be only a matter of days, perhaps almost of hours, before
his suspicion took some practical and unpleasant form. But I was
not in the very slightest degree unnerved, and I was quite
prepared to deal with any situation that might arise, with
coolness, courage, and resource.</p>

<p>After all, I thought, they could never have anything definite
against me. They might suspect, suspect, and suspect, but that
would be as far as they would ever get. I couldn't see how any
actual proof existed anywhere.</p>

<p>So I started to live out my daily life, just as if no crimes,
so far as I was concerned, had ever happened at all&mdash;and
looking back now, I really don't think I was very much worried
in the early days that followed.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile, I soon got news in many ways that the
authorities were very busy.</p>

<p>On the morning after I had been up to Prospect with Mr.
William in the car, I had a call at the office, from Mr. Sam
Podsley. He, of course, knew that I worked for Winter and
Winter, and he had no scruples at all about calling upon me
there.</p>

<p>He was quite friendly and as voluble as ever.</p>

<p>"That was a real treat, Mr. Wacks," he said heartily, "you
taking us all down yesterday. I enjoyed it immensely, although
it showed us all up as a lot of mugs. Oh! how waxy the police
were! You should have heard the slating the Chief Commissioner
gave them, after you had gone. He called them swabs, and told
them it was a disgrace that they should be shown their business
by a paltry little office clerk. You don't mind my telling you,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all," I replied laughing, "I'm very
interested. Go on&mdash;tell me everything that happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing much more, except that the dark, thin chap, Meadows,
I think they called him, was most anxious for my friend Biggar's
address. Biggar was the chap, you remember, who met the
white-faced man coming out of the gate."</p>

<p>"Well," I said feeling a little bit uncomfortable, "but
Biggar said he wouldn't recognise him again, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Sure, he said he wouldn't know him from me except that he
was white-faced, and thin. But, Lord! these police are messers
any way. Just hear what's been and happened today.</p>

<p>"At ten minutes to seven this morning the darned telephone
bell started to ring like blazes. I was in bed, but, of course,
hopped out at once. It was a message from the police station in
Victoria Square, and a pretty curt one, too. They were sending
up two men to look over the house, and would I please afford
them all facilities, &amp;c. Of course, I said 'yes,' and told
Mrs. Sam they were coming. She was in an awful state at
once&mdash;you know what women are&mdash;and said the place
wasn't fit for anyone to see. Such a lot of people have been
messing about, these last two days. So up she gets in an awful
hurry, and commences to clean up. She washes all round the
verandah, and pays special attention to the verandah post, up
which that beggar must have climbed; several of us had shinned
up yesterday, to show how easily it could be done.</p>

<p>"Well, hardly had she finished, and before even any of it was
really dry, up come two strange chaps with the detective fellow
Meadows, again! What do you think they came for?&mdash;
Finger-prints, my boy, finger-prints. Oh! wasn't there just a rumpus.
My wife had been and washed them all out! You should have seen
their faces and the scowl that detective had. I tell you their
jaw just put my back up and I told them so, straight."</p>

<p>"'Why the tarnation didn't you say what you were coming up
for, and everything would have been all right,' I told them.
It's just that damn secretive want of confidence in anybody,
that always spoils the police. One thing, they didn't stop long
when I answered back."</p>

<p>"Did they take any photographs," I asked, a great deal more
interested than he imagined.</p>

<p>"Not a damn one," he replied, picking up his hat, "they never
even undid their bag of tricks. But I must be going now, Mr.
Wacks, I'm in the building line, you know, and fairly pushed
just now. If you ever want a cozy home, by-the-by, just ring up
Sam Podsley&mdash;will you? I'll do you well, I promise, and
throw in a couple of coats of paint or so for the pleasure you
have given me over this affair. Good-bye&mdash;my
boy&mdash;good-bye," and off he trotted in high good humor with
himself.</p>

<p>His visit set me wondering what another near escape I must
have had. I had never thought of finger-prints and there were
sure to have been some on the verandah post before the energetic
Mrs. Podsley had washed them off. Thank goodness, I thought,
there would have been none on the roof&mdash;the Sunday evening
rain would have seen to that. What a sell for Meadows again.</p>

<p>Meadows&mdash;on and off&mdash;was a lot in my thoughts that
day, and directly I got home that evening he loomed up large
again.</p>

<p>He had been searching my bedroom. I was quite certain about
it the very moment I first opened the door. I have always a very
keen sense of smell and the room smelt as if it had been lately
occupied; stuffy and close.</p>

<p>It had been a piping hot day and Mrs. Bratt was always most
particular, as I knew, to keep all the doors and windows tightly
closed until well after sundown, to keep out the heat.</p>

<p>There was a strange smell about that did not belong to me. I
opened the door of my cupboard, where I kept my clothes.
Exactly, they had all been moved and taken off their pegs.</p>

<p>I had expected something of this was going to happen, and, in
preparation for it, had that morning most carefully noted the
position of all belongings in the room. My coat and trousers I
had hung up in a certain way and my boots and shoes, although
apparently all carelessly disposed, had each their own
particular and peculiar position that I had impressed upon my
mind.</p>

<p>Everything had been moved and examined. Even the linoleum on
the floor had been lifted up all round the edges and the grating
in the chimney had been taken down.</p>

<p>I made a most interested and careful scrutiny of everything
to see how far he might have gone, but nothing seemed to have
been altered or abstracted until almost at the last, I found
something had been done to the heels of my two pairs of
shoes.</p>

<p>It was only a very little thing, and if I had not been
looking purposely for something of the kind I should not have
stood the ghost of a chance of noticing it.</p>

<p>A little piece of each heel, where it faced the instep, had
been sharply cut away on one side. It was only a very little
piece that had been taken out, but it made the heel
unsymmetrical, and to anyone who was expressly looking for it
the impression of the heel would make in the ground would very
easily be recognised anywhere, out of many thousands of
others.</p>

<p>Evidently, I thought, friend Meadows hoped to find this
peculiar imprint of my heel upon the scene of some future
crime.</p>

<p>My discoveries amused me not a little, but at the same time,
they brought home to me the determined nature of the man I had
up against me.</p>

<p>I didn't go to head-quarters at all that evening. I knew
Meadows would be expecting me to go up there as usual, and would
probably be arranging to have me followed for the night.</p>

<p>I went to see Lucy and took her out for a walk in the
dark.</p>

<p>Dear little Lucy; she flushed so prettily when she saw me,
and when I bent to kiss her she strained me close and whispered
she had been wanting me all day.</p>

<p>"You know, dear," she said later with her face very near to
mine. "I didn't want anyone at all, until the day you put your
arms round me for the first time. Then the way you kissed me
gave me such delicious thrills, and I seem to have been quite
different ever since. When I don't see you now, I'm so lonely
and unsatisfied, and I just long for you to come every
evening."</p>

<p>I kissed her fondly as we sat under the trees in the park,
and full of delightful thoughts we brooded over all the
happiness that would be ours when we were married. I wanted our
marriage to come very soon and with sighs and trembling and long
silences, Lucy, at length, agreed it should be just after
Easter, in about six weeks.</p>

<p>I was radiantly happy with Lucy all that evening and, turning
into bed just before eleven o'clock, my last waking thoughts
were of the sweet, gentle face that for so long had been
upturned to mine.</p>

<p>I couldn't have slept much more than an hour, however, when I
was suddenly awakened by someone quickly turning the handle of
my door, and before I had time even to call out, in my surprise,
up went the light, and I saw Meadows standing just inside the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Wacks," he said, staring hard at
me and looking very startled and surprised, "but you called,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I never called," I gasped out, half-choking with the
fright of seeing him in my room. "I was fast asleep. Oh, how you
frightened me! What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Someone shouted, and I thought it was you. Don't you lock
your door at night, though?''</p>

<p>"Of course I don't," I replied crossly, my anger at once
beginning to get the better of my fear. "The hall door's always
locked, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's right enough but still," and he shrugged
his shoulders and let his eyes rove round the room.</p>

<p>What the devil does he want? I thought. He never believed he
had heard me shout. He just thought I shouldn't be home yet, and
for some reason, wanted to see into my room. What was his
game?</p>

<p>I watched him narrowly. He seemed in no hurry to go away, and
went on talking with an assumption of friendliness that sat
awkwardly on him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm very sorry I disturbed you. I was just off to bed
myself, but made sure you called out; perhaps it was in your
sleep anyhow."</p>

<p>I didn't trouble to answer, but just sat up in bed and yawned
fearfully, as a hint for him to go.</p>

<p>He picked up a pair of shoes that were lying on a chair at
the end of the bed. They were the ones I had worn that evening
and I had left them just as I had taken them off.</p>

<p>"Nice shoes these, Mr. Wacks," he said, and he put his hand
right inside one and turned it round and upside down, to the
light. "I must get a pair like these when my courting times
come. Can't afford them now; we poor policemen have to be
content with this heavy stuff the Government gives us."</p>

<p>Oh, the great ninny, I thought. If I weren't suspicions
already, the way he was carrying on would soon make me so. Of
course, he was putting his hand in the shoe to see, if by any
chance, I had just taken it off and it were still warm.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night," he said, after a long minute's pause. "I
hope you'll get to sleep again soon," and he pulled the door
clumsily to and went off in the direction of his own room.</p>

<p>But I didn't go off again to sleep soon. His visit was
worrying me, and, puzzle as I would, I could think of no reason
for his coming to my room. He must have been quite certain, I
thought, that he wouldn't find me there, for he had burst in so
cocksure, and switched on the light as if he were absolutely
sure of his ground.</p>

<p>I gave up thinking at last, and dropped off uneasily into
sleep, but this time it was Meadows's ugly face, and not Lucy's
pretty one, that came to me in my dreams.</p>

<p>Directly I woke next morning, I started puzzling again, but I
had not to puzzle for long. The answer to the riddle came to me
before even I had started dressing.</p>

<p>There was an imperative knock on the hall door and Mrs. Bratt
came hurriedly to tell me there was a gentleman who wanted to
speak to me at once, very urgently.</p>

<p>I went out into the hall, just as I was, in socks and
pyjamas, and found it was Spicer, one of the Woodville patrol
men. He looked very white and scared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Matthew Russell's killed," he burst out abruptly, "last
night at Woodville&mdash;by the Baptist Chapel on the Port Road.
He was bludgeoned on the head. When we found him he was still
alive, but he died without speaking. The beast who killed him
rifled his pockets this time; they had all been turned out and
most of his things taken."</p>

<p>Matthew Russell killed! A black film came over my eyes. He
was one of the most influential members of the city patrol, and
one of the most loyal friends I had. He was one of the best
known men in the Stock Exchange and a very rich one too. He had
taken up his share of patrolling the city in a fine spirit of
loyalty to the community and had worked as hard and as
unobtrusively as the humblest clerk in his employ.</p>

<p>The news stunned me and I could not say a word.</p>

<p>"I knew it would shock you, Mr. Wacks," went on Spicer
feelingly. "I won't stop now, but I thought you ought to know
immediately."</p>

<p>I went back slowly into my bedroom, and then a sudden and
horrible fear struck through me.</p>

<p>Had I killed him, I thought? Had I done it unconsciously? Had
I got up again after I had gone to bed, and with the baleful
drug still stirring in me, gone out anew on that fearful quest
of blood?</p>

<p>I covered my face with my hands and tried hard to think. I
knew I had come home directly after leaving Lucy, and remembered
distinctly going straight to bed. I remembered, too, carefully
brushing my clothes, putting my trousers on the stretcher, and
hanging up my jacket methodically upon its particular peg.</p>

<p>Hurriedly and anxiously I opened the cupboard door.</p>

<p>Yes, there they all were&mdash;just as I had left them, and
not a speck of dust upon them anywhere. No, I could not possibly
have left the house again, and this time, at any rate, my
conscience was clear.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes in the thankfulness and relief of it
all.</p>

<p>But who could have done it if not I? Was there a new murderer
abroad and were yet more horrors now to descend upon this poor,
bowed, stricken city?</p>

<p>I could not understand it.</p>

<p>Then, I suddenly remembered Meadows, and the reason for his
midnight visit stood out clear.</p>

<p>He had heard of this new crime, and rushing quickly here had
expected to find my room empty, with me away somewhere, to come
home, however, later, and, no doubt, to exhibit on me traces of
this new deed of blood that he was quite sure I had done.</p>

<p>He would have been waiting for me with adequate help, and, of
course, would have thought to catch me red-handed, for sure,
this time.</p>

<p>I wondered grimly what he would make of it now.</p>

<p>Matthew Russell was buried next day and, as was his right,
the city of Adelaide accorded him a public funeral.</p>

<p>All business places were closed during the burial hour, and
the ceremony was one of impressive pomp and solemnity.</p>

<p>All the special patrol men were on duty, and, with over five
hundred of them in the procession, the city, perhaps for the
first time, realised the extent of the organisation we had built
up.</p>

<p>They marched six deep, white-armletted, and with their patrol
officers at the side.</p>

<p>I was alone in front of them all, just behind the Government
officers and the official dignitaries of the State.</p>

<p>The streets were lined with solemn and silent crowds.</p>

<p>I had no pride, however, in the prominent position in which I
had been placed.</p>

<p>I was uneasy and choked with grief, only thinking of the
horror of it all.</p>

<p>As we passed up King William Street, the mournful strains of
the Dead March came up softly on the air.
Brooding&mdash;beautiful and rich in dreadful sadness&mdash;they
struck like a surgeon's knife into my composure, and I burst
impulsively into tears.</p>

<p>I pulled my face up rigidly, but the tears blinded me, and I
could hardly see which way to walk.</p>

<p>The crowd could not but notice how deeply I was affected, and
I could hear mutters of sympathy as I passed along.</p>

<p>I suddenly hated myself for it all. This was not my deed of
blood, I knew&mdash;but it was surely my weakness in first
tasting the paste that had led to it, and morally I felt I was
responsible for it all.</p>

<p>When the funeral was over, and just before the patrol men
were dismissed, an impulse that I could not resist came over me
to address them.</p>

<p>They stood round me in a hollow square and, speaking solemnly
to them, I tried to put some of the beauty of the dead man's
life into words. I told them that we had just laid to rest a
great and good man. Great, because he had put his public duty
before his private ease, and good, because he was unselfish and
thought of others before himself. He had been rich, as riches
went in this world, and it would have been easy for him to have
shown his appreciation of our work by just handing over a sum of
money which he wouldn't in any way have felt, and have left the
hard part for someone else to do. But no; he had felt it was an
hour when the individual duty of everyone was called for, and
unstintingly and ungrudgingly he had given of his best for the
common weal. He had come down amongst us, night after night, to
work as we all had worked and to take on the risks that we all
had taken on. Perhaps, to none of us had life been sweeter than
it must have been to him, and perhaps to none of us had it given
greater or more generous gifts. Yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;he had
given us everything, even as those of us who had least in life
to cling to.</p>

<p>He had offered all and in return had met a dreadful death. We
must remember that. The memory of his death must be an
inspiration and an added incentive to all of us to lift for ever
the dark and dreadful cloud that for so long now had hung over
our fair city. We must avenge our dead.</p>

<p>I spoke for about ten minutes, and every word came from the
sorrow and sincerity of my own heart. Not even the baleful and
malevolent face of Meadows, whom I noted standing within earshot
all the time, could detract, even ever so little from the
earnestness that I really felt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; I AM SUSPECTED.</h2>

<p class="first">THE murder of Matthew Russell continued to
upset me terribly, and night and day I could not keep my
thoughts away from it. He had been a man of such lovable
character and such a general favorite with everyone. Mixing in
all the best society of the city and on intimate terms with the
highest persons in the State, he had nevertheless worked
whole-heartedly under me. Apparently in complete forgetfulness that
while he had been an important man in the community, I, after
all, was still only a poor office clerk, he had taken orders
from me just as the humblest and most insignificant of my
patrols, and although many years my senior, had always treated
me with the respect and deference due to a superior officer.</p>

<p>I felt his loss terribly and I learned afterwards that it
added not a little to my popularity with the special service men
that everyone could see how genuinely grieved I was. It made
them realise the spirit of camaraderie that there was amongst
us.</p>

<p>It was a good thing for me, too, that I was popular with my
men, for otherwise I should never have got to know, in the
manner that I did, how suddenly the clouds of suspicion had
gathered up against me at head-quarters.</p>

<p>Two days after Matthew Russell's funeral I had just arrived
at the office when one of the city patrols, a man called Fraser,
rang me up. He said he wanted to speak to me urgently about a
very serious matter and asked if he could come round at
once.</p>

<p>I was rather annoyed, because I had a lot to do that morning,
but still I thought it best to tell him he might come, and so
within ten minutes at most he was ushered into my private
room.</p>

<p>He was very particular to make sure that the door was shut
securely behind him, and then he advanced almost on tiptoe to my
desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wacks," he said very quietly when we had shaken hands,
"I'm sorry to bother you in business hours, but I'm sure when
I've told you everything you'll say I was quite right to
come."</p>

<p>"What is it then?" I asked, feeling almost inclined to smile
at the air of mystery in which he was enveloping himself. "For
anything urgent you can always come any time."</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, as if not knowing how to commence,
and then he blurted his words out as rapidly as he could, at the
same time keeping his voice down almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>"It's those damned police with their jealousy
again&mdash;they're trying to make out now that it's you who are
the murderer."</p>

<p>I almost collapsed.</p>

<p>His words struck at me like a blow; a dreadful shudder ran
through my body and my knees shook horribly under the desk. A
clammy sweat came over me and my heart hammered so fiercely that
I felt as if my very head would burst. But I don't think my face
altered at all. I just stared at him stonily, without the
flicker of an eyelash and without saying a word.</p>

<p>"It's that brute Meadows," he went on hoarsely. "I heard him
tell the Chief Commissioner that you were the man on the roof
last Sunday, and that it was you who had committed every murder
that had been done."</p>

<p>I looked at him very calmly, and it was then the beating of
my heart seemed suddenly to ease a little. Almost a flutter of
relief ran through me and I could almost feel, too, the ghost of
a weak smile beginning to gather round my lips. Why should I be
so startled, I asked myself? After all, his news was only what I
had been expecting, and the mercy of it was that it had come to
me from friendly lips. It was no hostile audience that faced me
now&mdash;no shrewd and critical gathering of my enemies,
waiting gleefully to see how I would take the first blow. Just a
blundering, honest, and indignant friend, whose very indignation
would blind him from the recognition of any guilty feelings I
might possibly show.</p>

<p>My luck again! The smile on my face strengthened just a
little and I moistened my dry lips with my tongue.</p>

<p>"Dear me," I said quietly, "and when did you hear all
this?"</p>

<p>"Last night," he replied promptly. "I was hidden in the
cupboard of the Specials' room. Listen and I'll explain
everything."</p>

<p>"But first sit down comfortably," I told him, now much more
at my ease. "Don't be in a hurry, I'm most interested, of
course." He sat down at once and leaned towards me over the
desk.</p>

<p>"Last night," he began slowly, "I was late in getting to
head-quarters&mdash;more than quarter of an hour. I was lucky in
meeting no one in the passage and slipped into our room hoping
to get my cap and armlet and make off without being seen. I was
particularly anxious not to be seen, because I had been late for
duty one night also last week, and the Chief had seen me coming
in then and jacketed me soundly in front of the grinning
policemen in the hall. Last night I saw at once I was the last
special to arrive, for our room was in darkness. I didn't switch
on the lights, because I had, of course, my electric torch with
me, and, with that I knew I could easily find my things. Well, I
was just groping in the cupboard for my cape when suddenly I
heard footsteps in the passage and then the voice of the Chief
himself. 'No I can't see you now,' I heard him say sharply.
'I've got some people in my room and I shall be very busy for at
least an hour.' 'But I must see you, sir, at once,' replied
another voice, and I recognised that it was the detective
Meadows speaking. 'It's extremely urgent or I wouldn't press
it.' The Chief grumbled something, their voices came nearer, and
then I heard him say crossly, 'Well, come in here.' I had just
time to jump into the cupboard and pull the door to when up went
the lights and through the chinks of the door I saw the Chief
and Meadows standing in our room. 'Now, Meadows, be quick,' said
the Chief irritably. 'I give you two minutes, that's all,' and
then Meadows came out with what I've just told you. The Chief
seemed to just gasp in astonishment.</p>

<p>"'What the hell do you mean?' he asked, 'Wacks, the murderer!
You silly ass'; but Meadows was as excited as he was, and poured
out a long rigmarole of a tale about you. I can't remember a
quarter of what he said, but he told the Chief he had been
keeping a diary for ever so long and there were a lot of things
in it about you. He said he had just been reading it over and he
saw there were seven nights last January when you had come home
very late. He said he had been comparing dates, and these late
nights of yours all fitted in exactly with some of the nights on
which the first murders had been committed. He said there could
be no possible mistake about it. Then he went on about your
killing someone's rabbits next door to where you lived and why
some dog hadn't barked because, of course, it knew you. Then he
told the Chief that after killing these rabbits&mdash;I never
heard such a tale&mdash;you went mad up at the office here and
tried to kill several of the clerks by throwing inkstands at
them. He said a man called Waller had told him all about it, and
that you had also been seen drinking beer that day. But why
don't you laugh, Mr. Wacks? You look quite pale."</p>

<p>At last the good fellow was noticing my condition, but it was
happy for me that I had now got myself completely under control.
I smiled, though I could feel it was only a very sickly
smile.</p>

<p>"I should like to laugh," I replied, "except that it's really
too tragic to be comic. But tell me, what did the Chief
say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at first he didn't seem to believe a word, but
afterwards Meadows had quite talked him over. Meadows kept on
insisting that several times you had got hold of inside
information that only the police or the murderer himself could
possibly have known. He said you must have been there, for
instance, on the park lands that night when Police-Constable
Holthusen was killed, or you couldn't possibly have told the
Premier what you did when you went up on the deputation. Then
the Chief broke in:&mdash;'And, damn it all, that's how he knew
a police bicycle had been stolen that night outside Government
House. I can see it all now. He stole it himself. It was a dead
secret all along from everyone except the parties actually
concerned, and then up gets that Peter Wacks at the public
meeting and gives everything away as if he knew all about it,
which no doubt the beggar did. Oh damn!"</p>

<p>Fraser's imitation of the Chief Commissioner was very
realistic and for the moment I felt almost amused at what he was
telling me.</p>

<p>"So the Chief worked himself up into quite a rage, did he?" I
asked my informant, when for a second he paused to take
breath.</p>

<p>"A rage? By cripes you should have seen him when Meadows said
you were the man hiding on the roof at Prospect last Sunday. He
just danced up and down like a cat on hot bricks. 'No wonder he
made us the laughing-stock of the city,' he swore. 'Oh, the
damned swine!' Then he went on to give Meadows a good jaw. They
must never let you out of sight now, he said, for one single
second after nightfall. You must be shadowed everywhere. But
they must take damned good care not to make any mistake, for
just now you were a sort of idol in the city, and if they made a
bloomer it would be good-bye for all heads at Victoria Square.
The Chief also said that, meanwhile, he should try to pump you
tonight.</p>

<p>"But isn't it absurd, Mr. Wacks? Doesn't it just show to what
lengths jealousy will take anyone? How they must hate all us
specials!"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders contemptuously. "It's childish," I
said rather bitterly, "but then it's no good making a fuss about
it anyhow." I held out my hand impulsively: "You're a good
fellow, Fraser, and this must be a secret between us two. No one
else must hear a word of it, you understand."</p>

<p>The man flushed to the roots of his hair with pleasure. It
was praise indeed from his chief to be spoken to like that, for
he knew quite well that I was a powerful man in the city
then.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Wacks," he replied warmly, "you can depend on
me. I've said nothing to a soul and I shan't either."</p>

<p>We chatted confidentially for a few minutes longer, and then
with another handshake he left.</p>

<p>Long after he had gone I sat thinking. So I was under
suspicion at last. All eyes would be watching me henceforth; one
false step and I should be undone. But weren't they too late
with their suspicions, and what had I to fear? Surely I had left
no clues behind me. I could see nothing now to connect me
definitely with the crimes. Of course, they would try to trap me
somehow, but thank goodness, I was prepared. No, I had only to
keep a stiff upper lip and they could scowl at me and do their
worst. I was not afraid.</p>

<p>Turning resolutely to my work, I put Meadows scornfully out
of my mind.</p>

<p>I was rather late in arriving at head-quarters that evening,
and I sensed danger immediately I drew near. Even as I was
crossing the Square I saw Inspector Wedlake looking at me out of
the tail of his eye with his whole manner suggestive of the
over-careless effect of a man who wanted to appear unconcerned
and off-hand.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Wacks," he said lightly as I got up to
him, "piping hot again&mdash;hasn't it been? I wish to goodness
some rain would come, but there, I don't suppose we can expect
it yet. Oh, by-the-way, the Chief was asking just now if you'd
been in. I'm not sure, but I fancy he wanted to speak to you.
Perhaps you had better go in; I'll find out where he is for
you."</p>

<p>I followed him unconcernedly, but I could feel the thumping
of my heart. I had steeled myself resolutely for the ordeal that
I knew lay before me, and I was wondering only as to the exact
manner of its coming.</p>

<p>The Chief was seated at his desk and hovering somewhere in
the back of the room were Meadows and another man.</p>

<p>They all looked up casually when we entered, but the Chief's
face took on at once a look of animated interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wanted to speak to you, Mr. Peter Wacks," he said half
grimly, and with just a trace of banter in his tone. "I've got
two or three small bones to pick with you, young man. Now what
do you think the duties of a special are&mdash;what is your
idea?"</p>

<p>I looked at him coldly as if without the very slightest idea
of what he meant. The nature of my reception was so unexpected
that inwardly I was puzzled and rather taken aback.</p>

<p>"Come, sir," he went on genially, "surely you know what your
duties are. For one&mdash;you're supposed to help us a
bit&mdash;now aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," I replied, determined not to be drawn into too
much talking; "well, we do, don't we?"</p>

<p>"As a whole&mdash;yes, but some of you are a hindrance at
times, and some of you are very indiscreet too. You are one of
the latter."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I said, fencing for time and quite unable
to follow the drift of his questions.</p>

<p>"You give away information sometimes, Mr. Wacks," went on the
Chief, speaking very sternly; "information that might be very
important, and quite defeat the end we are all supposed to have
in view."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," I replied bluntly. "You never
tell me anything, so I've nothing to give away."</p>

<p>He bent forward impressively and said slowly with the cold
anger he showed only when he was rating his men.</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you tell the reporter of the 'Register' about
Sullivan being in the hospital with snakebite?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I have told him?" I replied, looking him
straight in the face.</p>

<p>His voice became very stern. "You knew it was a matter that
concerned the police."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, what if it did? Everybody knew it, didn't they?"</p>

<p>He just glared at me. "You know they didn't," he snapped
angrily. "It was a breach of faith on your part to mention
it."</p>

<p>"I don't see it," I replied calmly. "I didn't learn it in the
course of my duties and, besides, directly afterwards I was told
it wasn't true. I just passed it on for what it was worth. That
was all."</p>

<p>"How did you learn it in the first instance, pray?"</p>

<p>"Sir Bartle told me; I met him in the street."</p>

<p>"And who told you that it wasn't true?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Wedlake here. I asked him purposely that evening
if any of his men were sick, and he at once said, 'No.'"</p>

<p>Inspector Wedlake looked rather uncomfortable, and the Chief
puckered up his forehead in a frown.</p>

<p>"One day, Mr. Wacks," he went on sarcastically, "you'll
perhaps learn that it isn't the business of any member of the
force to furnish information generally as to what's going on.
But now, then, well come to another thing. Please explain why
you didn't tell me you lived next door to Boulter? Your memory
will be quite good enough, I am sure, to remind you that the
matter cropped up when we were having lunch that day with the
Governor. You remember, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly well," I replied; "you told us all about his
rabbits then."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you sat mute and said nothing&mdash;why,
please?"</p>

<p>I put as much scorn as I could muster into my voice.</p>

<p>"Because I thought it was piffle. I thought the idea utter
rot. I think so now, too."</p>

<p>I looked squarely at Meadows, hoping to drag him in, but he
was looking out through the window as if everything were of no
interest whatever to him.</p>

<p>The Chief was furious. He was too straightforward and to
blunt a man to hide his feelings much at any time, and my words
evidently galled him to the quick.</p>

<p>"Be careful, sir, be careful," he blurted
angrily&mdash;"don't add impertinence to your usual want of
tact."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders again and was just thinking what to
reply when the telephone rang sharply on the table just behind
him. He made a curt sign to Inspector Wedlake and the latter
picked up the receiver at once. There was a moment's silence and
then the Inspector rapped out sharply.</p>

<p>"Message from Carlton, sir&mdash;a man's been killed on the
Torrens Road&mdash;bludgeoned again. The murderer was seen
running away."</p>

<p>It will always be difficult for me to remember what exactly
happened then.</p>

<p>The Chief looked thunder-struck. He just glared at Meadows as
if the detective had done him some great and mortal wrong.
Meadows was ghastly, like a gambler losing everything on a
single throw&mdash;his jaw dropped dismally, and his face had
the pleading of a beaten dog.</p>

<p>The Chief snatched savagely at the receiver.</p>

<p>"Chief speaking&mdash;well?"</p>

<p>There was a tense silence. Meadows partially recovered
himself&mdash;he dropped his eyes. Inspector Wedlake of us all
seemed the most undisturbed; he stared interestedly at me and
I&mdash;well, I was more horrified than any of them there. I was
in a perfect sweat of horror, and felt sick almost to nausea
with the sudden shock. I was dazed, too, and trying hard to
think. Was it in nightmare only then that I had committed all my
crimes? Was it in dreams alone that I had roamed the city on my
quest of blood? What if I were innocent after all? For the
moment I was so perplexed that I was ready to believe anything.
I dropped into a chair so that I might not faint.</p>

<p>I heard the Chief giving some directions on the
phone&mdash;then he hung up the receiver sharply and turned
round.</p>

<p>He seemed to half open his mouth to speak to Meadows, but
catching sight of me huddling in the chair he checked himself
abruptly and crossed over to me.</p>

<p>"Feeling faint, man?" he asked not unkindly. "Put your head
low down&mdash;would you like a nip of brandy?"</p>

<p>I shook my head at once. The extreme faintness had passed and
ashamed now of my weakness I pulled myself together and sat
up.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," I asked brokenly, "another death now? When's it
all going to end?"</p>

<p>"Ask me another," replied the Chief briskly putting on his
cap, "but, goodnight now&mdash;we're going out. Wedlake here
will look after you. Don't leave until you feel all right," and
off he went with Meadows at his heels.</p>

<p><br>
FOR a long time that night I rolled and tossed in bed before I
at last finally got off to sleep. What was going to happen now,
I asked myself a hundred times? Undoubtedly there was another
madman taking on the dreadful role of crime.</p>

<p>Was it because I had set him the example? If so, upon what a
ghastly trail of blood had I not set the feet of the poor
stricken city. Was there any punishment in the whole world that
could be bad enough for me? Could I ever in any way atone?</p>

<p>My sleep was light and broken and I was glad when morning
came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; THE NEW MURDERER.</h2>

<p class="first">THE days of the ensuing fortnight were
terrible ones indeed to me. Crime upon crime was perpetrated,
and almost every night the news of some dreadful deed of
violence was telephoned up to head-quarters. Robbery was now
added to murder, and upon every occasion when the murderer had
time he thoroughly and systematically rifled the pockets of his
victims, taking everything of value away.</p>

<p>The murderer seemed to bear almost a charmed life. Time after
time, he escaped only by the skin of his teeth. Three times he
was seen close at hand, and twice he was actually interrupted
when bending over the dead. But he got away always, and the
description that we received of him was meager and
unsatisfactory to a degree. He was described as dressed in dark
clothes, as of slim build and of about medium height; but he was
wearing some kind of gray cloth over his face and nothing of his
features was seen.</p>

<p>He was well armed and when chased, as upon two occasions he
was, he used an automatic freely. One of the Norwood patrols was
shot, both in the arm and in the thigh.</p>

<p>His victims were of any class and one of my own patrol-men
was killed in Norwood his pockets picked and his armlet
taken.</p>

<p>Apparently the murderer was abroad every night, and
apparently, too, there was no part of the city that was not
within the scope of his operations.</p>

<p>The public was roused to a dreadful pitch of anger, and the
specials now came in for almost as much adverse criticism as the
regular police. The Chief used to smile grimly when he met me
and, if he did not say anything, he would pretend to handle his
neck very gingerly, as if he were already feeling the noose he
had so often prophesied for us both.</p>

<p>Apparently, suspicion had now been entirely diverted from me,
and I was no longer being shadowed. I was so often now actually
under the very eyes of the police when trouble was occurring in
another part of the city, that it would have been absurd, on the
face of it, to connect me in any way with the crimes.</p>

<p>But if the police no longer worried me, I was a terrible
grief and torture to myself. As time went on, I blamed myself
more and more for all the horrors that were taking place, and I
was fully convinced that it was my own evil example that had
inflamed and set in action the awful proclivities of the wretch
who was now terrorising the city.</p>

<p>I made myself quite ill over the matter, brooding over it
night and day; to the exclusion even of Lucy it filled my
thoughts.</p>

<p>But my unrest was not for one moment the barren grieving of a
man who had done wrong and is just weakly sorry for it. I was
determined to atone for it as far as lay within my power, and,
indeed, towards the end it became quite an obsession with me
that Fate had somehow destined me to track out and rid the city
of this new monster, as part atonement for my crimes.</p>

<p>Over and over again, I wondered who the man could be and from
what part of the city he emerged at night to carry on his
crime.</p>

<p>Hour upon hour I used to sit with a large ordnance map before
me and weigh up the probabilities as to where he would live.</p>

<p>For many days it seemed hopeless. Then gradually the idea
began to crystallise in me that he would be living by the sea. I
never knew quite what made me first think of it, but I was
perhaps helped on by the appearance in one of the morning papers
of a very ordinary letter complaining about someone who had been
shooting sea-gulls on the sands. The writer of the
letter&mdash;I think he wrote from Semaphore&mdash;was very
angry.</p>

<p>Two mornings later, he wrote, he had noticed when bicycling
along the sands that some blackguard had been wantonly shooting
a number of these beautiful birds, about a mile and a half north
of the jetty at Grange. Upon each occasion he had counted more
than a dozen of them lying dead just by the margin of the waves,
and upon examination he had found they had all been shot with
bullets of a very small calibre. Probably a little .22 rifle, he
thought, had been used. It was disgraceful, he argued, that it
should be allowed, and in some hopefully expectant way he called
upon the police and public to interfere.</p>

<p>There was nothing particular in the letter itself, but it
brought up vividly to me what I had done in the beginning of my
crimes. I remembered the first lust of taking life when I had
killed Boulters rabbits, and I wondered hazily if the death of
these poor birds were part, too, of the awful drama now taking
place under our very eyes.</p>

<p>What if the murderer lived somewhere near Grange? It was very
lonely about there on the north side of the sandhills, and it
would fit in so well with everything else.</p>

<p>He would almost surely be living by himself, for otherwise
his continual outings at night must certainly have been noticed.
He would also have to be living in some lonely spot where he
could slink in at any time without being noticed; the
countryside was so thoroughly roused by now that any suspicious
action on anyone's part would be commented upon at once.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was the question of his getting home at
night. The train service on the Grange line would dovetail in
admirably with all the times the crimes had been committed in
the other suburbs of the city. They had never occurred later
than eleven at night&mdash;the time the last train left Adelaide
for Grange&mdash;except once, when a man had been attacked at
Alberton just before midnight. Alberton, however, was well
within walking distance of Grange, and to anyone who knew his
way across the sandhills the journey could be done easily under
the hour.</p>

<p>Then again&mdash;the two first murders had both taken place
at points served by the railway going to Grange, and, thinking
again of my own horrors, I remembered how I had first given way
to my impulses within easy distance of my own home.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday morning when the idea first struck me
definitely about the possibility of the murderer being at
Grange, and that afternoon Lucy and I had a long walk along the
sandhills by the sea.</p>

<p>As I remembered, it was very lonely beyond Grange. The
district was not without habitations, but in some places the
bungalows were very few and far between. Some, indeed, were
quite a quarter of a mile from each other and one in particular
I noticed as surrounded on every side by a wide lonely belt of
undulating sand. In was a fine big place, however, and, perched
high upon a rather large sandhill, enjoyed quite an extensive
view of the surrounding country. Built evidently by some rich
man, I thought, who wanted to live quite by himself, and yet be
quite near to the comforts and refinement of civilisation.</p>

<p>We could see no sign of any inhabitants, but the hoarse
barking of dogs when we passed showed clearly that the place was
inhabited.</p>

<p>Next morning I did not go up to business. I rang up the firm
and said I was not feeling very well. I asked if I could be
spared for two or three days until I felt better.</p>

<p>Mr. William was exceedingly nice and told me at once to take
a week if necessary, and be sure to go out and get plenty of
fresh air.</p>

<p>I felt more hopeful that morning than I had been for many
days. At last I had some settled plan in my mind, and I wanted
to put my theories to the test.</p>

<p>There were four stations adjoining the sea on the Grange
line, and at each I in turn made the same enquiries. I went
straight to the point at once. I told them who I was, and what I
wanted to know. Did they remember anyone who had got out by
himself upon the arrival of the last train from Adelaide on the
Friday night previously, and had they noticed anyone in
particular who had lately been habitually using the last train
to come home by?</p>

<p>Full of my idea, I tried Grange itself first, and my
enquiries immediately evoked a broad grin of amusement from the
ticket collector there.</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, Mr. Wacks," he said pityingly, "why
there's been lots here on that stunt already. Back six or seven
weeks there were 'tecs here, on duty, every night&mdash;meeting
everybody who came by the last train, questioning them and
following them up and finding all about them and where they
lived. But it was no good&mdash;nothing happened and in a few
days they gave it all up. No&mdash;I haven't seen anyone unusual
lately, and I am quite sure there wasn't anyone on Friday that I
didn't know."</p>

<p>The reply was certainly very disheartening, but I had my own
reasons for knowing the difference of things six weeks ago and
now, and so continued my enquiries along the line. But nothing
resulted, and I was returning very dispiritedly to the city when
as a last resort I thought I would try a fifth station&mdash;the
one before Grange and quite two miles from the sea. It was
surrounded almost entirely by long sandy stretches of flat
waste-land that stretched monotonously away until, on the
seaward side, they ultimately reached the belt of sandhills
between them and the sea. It was a very lonely place and, except
for the golf club-house in one direction, there were no houses
at all until within a few hundred yards of Grange itself. So
unimportant was the station that there was no booking
office&mdash;tickets being issued and collected by the guard
upon the train.</p>

<p>It was not until I had watched the passing of two trains that
I was enabled to light upon the guard who had been on duty the
previous Friday night. Then I had to travel back with him to
Grange in his van in order to elicit the information that I
required.</p>

<p>But it was well worth it, as I soon found. Fortunately, he
was an intelligent young fellow, and quite appreciated the
possible importance of my enquiries.</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;he knew me well by reputation, he said; he had
heard me speak at Hindmarsh and his brother was in the patrol
there. He remembered Friday night perfectly well. Two persons
had got out at the little station and he didn't think they were
together. One was Wendover the grocer, who had a little shop at
the cross-roads, about a hundred yards away, and the other,
Porteous, the caretaker for Mr. Silas Magrath at the Grange. He
was afraid, however, they wouldn't either of them be much good
to me, for they were both of them most respectable men.
"Yes,"&mdash;he had certainly seen the caretaker several times
lately by that train. He used to get out there, because, he
said, it was almost as near as going on to Grange.</p>

<p>Mr. Magrath's house was the last one on the sea front at
Grange and nearly two miles north of the jetty. The walk over
the sandy field land wasn't at all bad if you only knew the way.
You could follow the railway for nearly a mile and then turn
straight off across the sand tracks direct to the house. Of
course it was lonely, but when the moon was up it would be quite
a nice walk. Mr. Magrath was away&mdash;he had been abroad for
some months. Yes, his house was the big one on the rise, and he
kept two large and fierce dogs. He was an eccentric old
chap.</p>

<p>All this I took in quickly as the train rattled on to Grange.
I thanked my informant for all he had told me and he promised
most religiously to hold his tongue and say nothing, to the
caretaker, least of all.</p>

<p>I was rather excited and very interested in what the guard
had told me. Of course, it might all mean nothing in the end,
but still I thought it was quite well worth going on with.
Although very tired already with so much walking, I cheerfully
set out to have a closer look at the house.</p>

<p>It was then about three in the afternoon. As I approached the
house I saw a man, whom I at once guessed to be the caretaker,
sitting on the broad low wall that completely surrounded the
house and garden at the back. The house was built right on the
top of the sandhill, and the garden behind sloped downhill away
from the sea. In addition to the wall&mdash;there was a wide,
deep ditch all round, with a fence of stout barbed wire in
front.</p>

<p>Directly I got near, two huge, fierce-looking dogs appeared
out of an outhouse in the yard, and commenced to growl and stalk
menacingly along the wall in my direction.</p>

<p>Their master swore angrily at them and they stopped their
advance reluctantly, but they still continued to growl fiercely
and eye me with obvious disfavor.</p>

<p>My heart beat just a little quicker when I saw the caretaker
was a man near to my own build, except that possibly he was just
a little bit shorter. He was about thirty, very dark, and had
the unmistakable yellow skin of a man who has lived in the
tropics.</p>

<p>He scowled at me&mdash;very much as the dogs had done, I
thought, and asked me roughly what I wanted.</p>

<p>I asked him politely how far it was to Semaphore, and when he
replied abruptly that he didn't know I asked him for a glass of
water. He refused point-blank, and bade me rudely go back along
the path I had come.</p>

<p>"You're trespassing," he shouted; "you've no right to be
where you are. This is all my land here. Go off at once or I
shan't be able to keep the dogs in any longer."</p>

<p>I turned away reluctantly, but looking back when I had gone
about a hundred yards, I saw he was still watching me. He was
seated in the same position, but now he had got a rifle in his
hand. I supposed he wanted to frighten me.</p>

<p>Sitting at home that evening I was very puzzled about what to
make out of my interview. One thing I was certain stood out
clear&mdash;the man couldn't be in a normal state of mind, for
such a little had so soon roused his temper, and bringing out
the rifle, as he had done undoubtedly to intimidate me, was a
certain indication of the unbalanced state he was in.</p>

<p>He seemed the very type of man I was looking for, and I
determined to find out more about him.</p>

<p>The next morning I was up very early and long before six was
securely hidden among the grass of an adjoining sandhill not
three hundred yards from the residence of Mr. Silas Magrath. I
had got a good pair of binoculars with me and could plainly rake
every part of the garden and yard and a good part of the house
itself.</p>

<p>The caretaker was a long while in appearing, but the two dogs
were in evidence all the time. They prowled restlessly to and
fro about the yard, but they were held safe on very long chains
and I was thankful they could not get away. They made no noise,
but many times, when for a few moments they stood still, I
though I could see through the glasses that they were intently
peering in my direction. It could be only imagination I knew,
but I was so close that I could plainly see the bloodshot whites
of their fierce and dreadful eyes.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the caretaker himself appeared, and,
greatly to my consternation, propped himself against the wall,
and for quite a quarter of an hour intently studied every yard
of the landscape around with a pair of binoculars that strangely
seemed very similar to my own.</p>

<p>He turned the glasses in every direction, and I was fearful
every moment that they would rest on me, but I huddled low down
in my bed of sand and trusted hopefully that my screen of grass
would hide me.</p>

<p>Apparently he found nothing to disturb him, and after some
time he went back into the house. He came out again presently
and fed the dogs. Then I saw nothing of him until well past
noon.</p>

<p>It was blistering hot where I lay, so hot that I did not dare
touch the sand around with my bare hand. A hundred and ten in
the shade at least, it must have been, but I stuck it out
grimly, and at last I got my reward. The caretaker came out in a
skimpy old bathing suit to have a bathe.</p>

<p>I held my breath at the bare idea of the possibilities of it
all. If only he would take the dogs with him, I thought, I would
get down and have a nearer inspection of the house.</p>

<p>Everything favored me. He brought out the inevitable
binoculars again and had a good stare round in every direction,
except in the one in which I lay. Then he threw his towel over
his shoulder and, bending down, unloosed the dogs. I noticed he
took their collars off, and I rejoiced that they, too, were
going to participate in the bathe. Finally, he locked the back
door, and, oh joy, put the key under a pail in the corner of the
yard.</p>

<p>The dogs rushed off before him, jumping and barking in
delight, and a few seconds later the house stood quiet and
solitary by itself.</p>

<p>I did not lose any time, and did not even stop to think
either. It seemed to me the most natural thing possible to go
and search the house. I never counted the risks. I had a
revolver on me, and wasn't in the least afraid.</p>

<p>He couldn't have left the place three minutes before I was
down and inside the house.</p>

<p>I closed the door behind me very gently, determined not to be
taken unawares if he came back unexpectedly.</p>

<p>There were a lot of rooms in the house, but I soon saw that
only one of them&mdash;the kitchen&mdash;was being used.</p>

<p>The back door opened directly into the kitchen, and I at once
noticed an untidy, unmade bed, with positively filthy sheets,
under the window. There was part of a loaf and a piece of
Bologna sausage on the table, a single cup and spoon, and the
usual paraphernalia for making tea. There were crumbs and the
remains of other kinds of food lying about, and altogether it
was quite plain to see that the caretaker was not of a
particular or fastidious turn of mind.</p>

<p>I passed quickly into the hall, and there I certainly had a
surprise. It was a sort of large lounge hall and had been turned
into a perfect armory for guns and rifles. Some were hanging on
the wall, but far more were stacked in proper gun racks round
the side. They all seemed modern and in good condition. All
round the walls were trophies of the chase. Over the mantelpiece
there glared down the largest bison head I could ever have
imagined, and picturesquely curved above the hall door were the
sinuous folds of a monster stuffed snake.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to determine what was the life hobby of
the owner of the place. <span class="smcap">'Big game hunter'
</span> stuck out everywhere in capital letters.</p>

<p>I looked into several of the rooms, but in all of them the
furniture was stacked in the middle and covered over with dust
cloths&mdash;so I didn't linger for a moment longer than just to
look in. I went back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>There was a brand new portmanteau under the table, but there
was nothing in it. Standing at the bottom of the bed was a big
trunk. I pulled eagerly at the lid, and it at once came open.
There were some boots inside, a suit of clothes, and several odd
undergarments, but nothing in particular to interest me. There
was a large cupboard in the corner. The door was shut, and I
looked round hurriedly for the key. I needn't have troubled
myself, for it was in the lock.</p>

<p>A great wave of disappointment went through me. I had counted
so much on some secret and hidden mystery in the house, and now
to find all things so carelessly open and left about just took
the edge off my expectations.</p>

<p>I pulled open the door with a jerk, and immediately got all
the shock I had ever hoped for.</p>

<p>A big gold chronometer was hanging right in front of me, and
I recognised it instantly as Matthew Russell's. With shaking
fingers I took it off the nail and looked at the back. Yes, the
monogram M. R. was there.</p>

<p>For quite half a minute I stood still in numb surprise. It
was difficult for me to breathe, and I could hear the beatings
of my heart. Thoughts surged like lightning through me. This
man, then, was the murderer. It was I who had found him, and my
dream of atonement was coming true.</p>

<p>But uncertainty then at once took hold of me. The watch
didn't prove anything; perhaps he had found it; perhaps he had
picked it up and it might be only coincidence after all.</p>

<p>I looked hurriedly round upon the other things on the shelf.
There were two automatics, a diamond ring, two more watches,
three pocket books, a silver cigarette case&mdash;a lot of
miscellaneous odds and ends and the armlet of a special
constable with Unley marked on it.</p>

<p>No, there could be no mistake; it was the man right enough.
There were two jackets, hanging up on a peg below the shelf.
There were dark stains all down the front of one and the right
sleeve of the other was caked over with what looked like dried
blood. Lying down in a corner on the floor was a thick, short
bar of iron.</p>

<p>I waited for no more, but quickly shut the cupboard door,
and, now in an agony of suspense that I should be caught before
I could summon help, tiptoed stealthily back across the kitchen
floor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in turning round, I stepped on a plate that
lay just behind me, and it broke with a loud crack. There were
some scraps of food on it, and it had evidently been placed
there for the dogs.</p>

<p>I swore at myself for my carelessness, and for a moment had
half a mind to take the broken pieces away; but, I thought, then
the caretaker would be sure to suspect something, and so I left
them, chancing that he would imagine he had broken the plate
himself.</p>

<p>I got safely out of the house; there was no sign yet of the
caretaker, and from the distant barking of the dogs I judged he
was still enjoying what I hoped would be his last bathe in the
sea.</p>

<p>In half an hour I was on Grange station, but it was another
half-hour fully before a train came in for Adelaide, and in my
feverish and impatient state it seemed a terribly long wait for
me.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind what I would do. I would go straight to
the Chief Commissioner at once, and tell him all I had
discovered&mdash;leaving him then to do what he thought
best.</p>

<p>To my great dismay, when I got to Victoria Square the Chief
was out. Inspector Wedlake and Meadows were, however, both
there, and the former, at any rate, was intensely curious as to
what I wanted the Chief so urgently for.</p>

<p>"Found out anything, Mr. Wacks?" he asked grinning. "Are you
going to wipe our eye again, like you did over that Prospect
affair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up, Inspector," I replied rudely. "Didn't the Chief
tell us only the other day that we weren't to blab anything to
outsiders, and you're an outsider to me&mdash;so cut it out,
please."</p>

<p>The Inspector got nasty at once. "One thing I will say, Mr.
Wacks," he remarked unpleasantly, "there's no one I'd rather put
a pair of handcuffs on than you. No one in the State, sir."</p>

<p>"I dare say," I sneered, and, disdaining any further
conversation with the man, sat down impatiently to wait for the
return of the Chief.</p>

<p>It was close on four before he returned, and I could see at
once that something had disturbed him, and that he was in a
great hurry. We met in the passage, outside his room.</p>

<p>"I've hardly a moment," he said quickly, but quite politely
to me. "I'm fearfully busy, but I hear you've something urgent.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"I've found out something, Chief," I replied, bursting with
excitement, but trying hard to speak calmly. "I know who the
murderer is at last."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do, do you?" And to my astonishment he grinned
broadly. "Now I suppose his name doesn't happen to be Meadows,
by any chance, does it?"</p>

<p>I didn't see the joke, and told him so flatly. His grin
watered down at once ominously at my rudeness, but my next words
instantly drove all the amusement from his face.</p>

<p>"I've seen Matthew Russell's gold watch," I went on sharply.
"I've seen the automatic stolen from the man killed at Medindie
on Friday, and I've seen the armlet taken from the murdered
special in Unley."</p>

<p>"What," he exclaimed excitedly, "where have you been, man? Is
that really so? Come in here quick," and he almost dragged me
into his room. "Now, tell me quietly, and we'll see if your
tale's really different to the usual mare's nest I've been
treated to lately, almost every day."</p>

<p>I sat down opposite to him as I had done once before, and a
little resentfully, but as impressively as I could, told him
everything that had happened to me in the last few days.</p>

<p>He listened to me intently without interruption. Then when I
had finished he was quite silent for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"Look here, Wacks," he said presently with just a tinge of
sadness in his voice, "there's some damned fate about this.
You're always butting into our affairs, as I told you once
before. Now you've found out about this caretaker, and as I sit
before you here I swear to you solemnly, man, that I was just
about to visit the very gentleman myself. That's why I was in
such a deuce of a hurry. It's hard lines, Wacks, for it ought to
have been a clear win for you, but it's only a dead heat for
you, after all. No, we didn't unhappily find out as you did.
What you've done reflects great credit on you and honestly I'm
proud, after all, that you're an Adelaide man. We've got our
knowledge in quite a different way. I'll have no secrets from
you now." He took a letter out of his breast pocket. "I've had
this letter not two hours ago. It's from Silas Magrath himself.
It comes from somewhere in America and was written almost a
month ago. Magrath says he has just got the Australian papers
and he bids us look up his caretaker on the Grange estate. He's
sorry to write it, but he thinks possibly the trouble might be
all his work.</p>

<p>"He has found out, since he left Australia, that the
caretaker was once in an asylum, ten years ago. Since then he
learns, also, that the man was strongly suspected once of
continual horse maiming in Kentucky. It was never proved against
him, and he disappeared. He advises us to ascertain how the man
is and in passing, also he asks us&mdash;damn his
cheek&mdash;kindly to have a look round and see if any of his
guns are rusting. Now you know everything and it just fits in
with what you say. How do you suggest we should approach the
man, as you know the ground? It looks an awkward job to tackle
anyway."</p>

<p>The chief's disclosure had had quite a chilling effect on me.
That, after all, they should have had their attention directed
to the same man seemed to me nothing short of miraculous, and
that they would ultimately have been able to lay hands upon him
without any intervention at all on my part, in my mind detracted
from the value of the atonement I was thinking I had at last
accomplished.</p>

<p>I felt quite sick with disappointment.</p>

<p>The chief noticed my chagrin but, mistaking the motive for
it, at once very nicely set himself to soften things down for
me.</p>

<p>"Of course, what you have discovered will be very valuable to
us now. But for what you have learned, we should have rushed
blindly in and most probably have all got bullets or broken
heads for our pains. Now we're prepared, and you can help us a
lot. Do you think we can rush the place?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so for a moment," I replied. "He's been
suspicious already, and that broken plate will now make him more
so. If the dogs go into the kitchen, too, they'll smell a
stranger's been in there at once."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you suggest?"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. "I suppose it wouldn't do to wait
until tomorrow and chance it that he goes out for a bath
again&mdash;we shall have him defenceless then?"</p>

<p>The Chief looked very stern. "No, Wacks&mdash;after this
letter and what you've told me, I should be wanting in my duty
if we delayed a single hour in trying to get the man. Remember,
too, that new portmanteau that you saw&mdash;he may be going to
slope off at once, as he did over there in Kentucky."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we'd better approach the place on both
sides&mdash;from Semaphore as well as from Grange. A car can get
much nearer to the house on the Semaphore side."</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of an hour later I got with the Chief
into his official car. It amused me immensely to see the amazed
faces of Meadows and Inspector Wedlake, when I sat down at his
side. Evidently the Chief had told them nothing of my
investigations, and neither of them had the faintest idea of how
things stood. The Inspector's eyes widened in surprise, and even
the inscrutable Meadows looked puzzled and uncomfortable. They
were to follow with some others in a car behind.</p>

<p>It was just five o'clock when we passed the Post Office. We
had nearly two hours of daylight before us.</p>

<p>I shall always remember that drive. The Chief was quite
chatty and affable and took me into his confidence in a most
friendly way.</p>

<p>What a relief it would be to him, he told me, when this
affair was over! He had never had such a worrying three months
in all his life before, and he wouldn't go through it again for
all the wealth of the rich city of Adelaide. He expected I
should be glad, too, but then&mdash;and he shrugged his
shoulders whimsically and smiled boyishly at me&mdash;it was an
ill-wind that had blown nobody good, and I had certainly come
out of this trouble a made man. I ought to have a great future
before me, he said, for I could yap, and yapping was what the
people liked.</p>

<p>"Make the best of your talents, my boy," he concluded, "and
get a rich wife quickly. Australia's a democratic country right
enough, but nowhere in the wide, wide world have they a greater
respect for money than they have here."</p>

<p>We reached Grange at last and turned round at right angles
into the Military road. This road runs round the coast and
always parallel to it&mdash;with a high belt of sandhills about
two hundred yards wide between it and the sea.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes or so we came in sight of the Magrath
house, and I at once pointed it out to the Chief.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled thoughtfully as he took in the situation.
"A very awkward place to take if we've got to rush it&mdash;no
cover at all except the sand. I wonder now if the beggar's at
home."</p>

<p>But he didn't have to wonder long. We must have been still
nearly half a mile away from the house when the distant crack of
a rifle came up on the air. Another and another followed.</p>

<p>"By Jove," cried out the Chief excitedly, "there's firing
going on somewhere, and from the reports we shall be in it jolly
soon. I wonder who's firing and what the devil they're aiming
at."</p>

<p>There was a sudden hiss&mdash;another report&mdash;then a
loud ping just near us, and a cloud of steam burst up in front
of the car.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! it's us he's aiming at," roared out the Chief,
"and he's hit the radiator. Accelerate quickly, man&mdash;we'll
go right by. It's safer, anyway, than turning&mdash;quick,
quick, or he'll hit some of us here."</p>

<p>The car leaped forward like an unleashed dog. Faster and
faster it went until with every lurch over the rough, uneven
road I trembled for the holding of the springs. The engine
roared like a quick-firing gun and we had to hold on to the
sides of the car to retain our seats.</p>

<p>In a few seconds almost, it seemed to me, we drew level with
the house, and then five times in quick succession I heard that
horrible ominous crack. Twice we were struck, I was sure, and
once the hiss of a bullet appeared to pass just over my head.
But we got by in safety at last and two minutes after were
standing ruefully regarding each other in the road. We were
hidden from view from the house by a friendly hummock of
sand.</p>

<p>"A nice pickle we're in now," snorted the Chief. "I wonder
where the devil's the next car. They must have seen what's
happened to us. Hullo, here they are."</p>

<p>There was another roar, much such as our car had
made&mdash;the fearful hoot of a horn warning us to stand clear
and, in another minute, round swung the second police car. It
was a much roomier car than ours and in it were packed eight
rather white and frightened looking men.</p>

<p>The driver pulled up directly he saw us. Their experience had
been much the same as ours, but, unhappily, one of their number
had been hit.</p>

<p>He lay back ghastly in the back of the car, with the front of
his tunic soaking fast in blood. He had been shot through the
chest somewhere and was unconscious when we lifted him out. He
coughed with dreadful consequences as he was being laid upon the
ground and, even as we watched him, his jaw dropped horribly,
and he was dead.</p>

<p>The Chief looked very white and stern, and there was sweat on
his face that was not the sweat of heat.</p>

<p>"There'll be a settling, sure, for this," he snarled between
his teeth. "There's no mistake about it now."</p>

<p>A minute later and the third car that had come by way of
Semaphore drew up. The new arrivals were quickly apprised of
what had happened, and the driver, receiving directions,
immediately bundled back towards the city.</p>

<p>"We'll have no more bungling," said the Chief curtly as he
looked at his watch. "We'll have to approach the house
systematically, but there's no chance now of getting up enough
men before dark. All we can do is to picket the place until help
comes."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the police were so disposed all round that
the caretaker couldn't possibly leave without being at once
perceived. They all had strict orders not to show
themselves.</p>

<p>The Chief and I crawled cautiously to the post of observation
I had occupied on the sandhill earlier in the day.</p>

<p>I explained to him the surroundings of the house. There was
no sign of life anywhere, but we could plainly hear the dogs
growling somewhere in one of the sheds.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the beggar'll do next," whispered the Chief,
as we lay close down in the sand. "He might do anything
now&mdash;come out and meet us in the open perhaps. He must be
clean off his nut, or sure he wouldn't have fired on us in the
cars without any provocation."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he would have seen us with his glasses, a good two
miles before we turned into the road here, and he'd have seen
there were policemen in the cars, too."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped now at any rate, but
still&mdash;&mdash;" There was a sudden splash of sand just by
the Chief's head and his "damn" came simultaneously with the
rifle crack from the house.</p>

<p>"Roll over sideways, man," he hissed sharply in my ear:
"he'll keep his sight on the same place&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>Splash after splash came from the sand close near where we
were lying, and every second I thought we should be hit.</p>

<p>"Lie still," whispered the Chief, "wait till he's fired ten
and then we'll wriggle back. It's a Lee-Enfield he's using and
it'll go ten."</p>

<p>Two minutes later we were back in safety and the Chief was
shaking the sand off his tunic.</p>

<p>"Quite a vigilant man, our friend," he remarked. "He must be
pretty sharp to have spotted us where we lay&mdash;I thought
we'd taken on something tough."</p>

<p>Just before seven, reinforcements began to arrive from the
city, and as dusk fell the whole place was completely
surrounded.</p>

<p>It was decided not to attack before daylight. The Chief
considered the risks too great. I had pointed out to him the
difficulty of successfully negotiating the barbed wire in the
ditch and the wall in the dark and how completely we should be
at the man's mercy, even when once over the wall, if he were
firing in safety from the house. It was arranged, therefore,
that the place should be rushed on all sides with the first
streak of dawn. Men with rifles would, as far as possible, cover
the attackers from the back by preventing the caretaker from
showing himself and hampering him in firing on them as they ran
up.</p>

<p>The main attack would have to be over the yard and garden at
the back, but the firing was to commence first at the sea side
in the hope that the caretaker might be lured to the other side
of the house.</p>

<p>Volunteers were called for to lead the attack, and the only
difficulty was to keep the number down to ten. I took it for
granted at once that I should be one of the chosen, and bluntly
told the Chief so.</p>

<p>He refused point-blank at first, but I insisted strongly that
I alone of any of them had been inside the house and knew where,
if we once got in, the caretaker would probably be hiding to
hold us up with his fire.</p>

<p>He gave in at last but implored me, half seriously and half
in fun, not to run any unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>"Damn it all," he finished up frowningly. "If you get killed
everyone will blame me, sure. 'Saint Wacks,' you'll be for
certain, but I'll be 'that old devil, the Commissioner,' right
enough. You'll get the glory and I'll be staying behind to get
the sack. I'll let you go, still, because, after all, I think it
partly your right. But please play fair, and think of me all the
time."</p>

<p>I promised to take care and he went off pretending to be
greatly relieved.</p>

<p>The night was very dark and quiet, and although not myself on
picket duty, I didn't get a wink of sleep. I lay back in the
sand and thought of what the future might perhaps hold for
me.</p>

<p>Once this were all over everything would be clear and I could
put the whole business out of my mind and forget everything.</p>

<p>But I hoped to goodness the man would be killed and not taken
alive. He knew too much, or rather, he didn't know enough, and
it would never do for him to confess everything. The police
would learn at once that he could be responsible for only the
latter part of the crimes, then would come all the suspicion
over again, and the hunting for the other man.</p>

<p>I should be under suspicion again, of course, and the
horrible nightmare of detection would undoubtedly rise up over
and over again, even after I were safely married to Lucy.</p>

<p>But if the man were killed&mdash;if his lips were closed for
ever without his having spoken to anybody&mdash;no one would
ever dream that he was not the author of everything and
responsible for every one of the crimes that had occurred.</p>

<p>Everyone would feel confident and safe again and in every way
it would be, for all, the happy ending.</p>

<p>Of course, if it were not for Lucy I might have given myself
up and confessed all. But what would have been the good of it to
anyone, I argued? A feast of horror for the public and that
would have been all. No confession could have brought back the
dead, and my disclosures would only have involved more pain to
all concerned.</p>

<p>Why, too, should I have thought of so punishing myself? I was
no longer any danger to the community. I had been mad when I
committed all my crimes&mdash;mad with that dreadful drug. But I
was mad no longer; I had thrown away the paste and was as sane
as anyone in the State. I was all on the side of law and order,
and the criminal that had been in me was as surely dead and
harmless as if he had been hanged weeks ago in the Stockade.</p>

<p>Just before dawn the Chief came up to me and told me to get
ready.</p>

<p>"Not afraid, Wacks?'" he asked curiously&mdash;he stretched
his hand out and put his fingers on my pulse. "You're a rum chap
for a damned office clerk&mdash;aren't you? Good steady
pulse&mdash;aren't you afraid of death?"</p>

<p>"I don't seem to bother about it," I said wearily. "I must be
a fatalist, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be a good fellow to have in a scrap, anyway.
You won't lose your head. Now look here. All you chaps are to
start off together and keep together, mind. I don't want you all
arriving up there, one by one, to be picked off like a lot of
fowls. Keep together as much as possible, all in a line, and if
I blow my whistle once, lie down instantly until I blow it again
twice. You quite understand&mdash;well, now go and take your
places&mdash;the light will be up in five minutes. Start the
instant you hear firing on the other side, and if you use your
automatics, for the Lord's sake, aim low."</p>

<p>I crouched rather sullenly in the sand. I wasn't in the least
frightened, I just felt numb and fed up with the whole business.
I really think I was bored.</p>

<p>The light was a long time coming, and the Chief's five
minutes ran into at least twenty before a sudden burst of firing
over by the sea brought us all instantly to our feet with a
rush.</p>

<p>We had about a hundred and fifty yards to run up over the
sand towards the wall, and it was hard going&mdash;rising all
the time. Quite a third of the distance, however, was covered
before anything happened, and then one of the policemen on my
left lurched forward heavily and dropped with a faint cry. A
second later, and the man next to him fell on his knees and
rolled over sideways in the sand.</p>

<p>Instantly a fierce volley of shots broke out behind, and the
crash of breaking glass told us they were well peppering the
back of the house.</p>

<p>My apathy left me in a flash, and a red mist of fury rolled
before my eyes. I tore desperately up the sand, stumbled, fell
over and picked myself up again.</p>

<p>A loud piercing whistle shrieked between the rifle shots, but
I doubt if I should have taken any notice of it if a sudden
burning stab in my left leg hadn't told me I was hit.</p>

<p>I tottered shakily for a moment and tried hard to keep myself
up, but it was no good and I fell weakly to the sand, feeling
very faint and sick.</p>

<p>It could have been only for a few seconds that I lay, for the
whistle just ceased blowing as I sat up. I looked down at my
leg. I had been hit about mid-way up the thigh and the blood was
already soaking through my trousers on to the sand. I wasn't in
any pain, but I felt dizzy and my head swam. My mind was
perfectly clear, however, and my chief feeling, I remember, was
one of anger that I had been hit.</p>

<p>The blood seemed to be flowing very freely and common sense
told me I should very soon go off entirely if it weren't
stopped.</p>

<p>Half mechanically I undid my tie and, twisting it as tightly
as I could round my leg, was relieved at once to see that the
blood had stopped spreading on the sand.</p>

<p>Then I looked round to see what had happened. Four of the
others at least were down too, for they were lying openly about
and making no attempt at any sort of cover. The other five I
could not see.</p>

<p>Then it struck me suddenly that I was not myself in a very
pleasant position. Sitting up, I was in full view of the house,
and inviting another and more effective shot. I dropped down
instantly on my side and then, I thought, better still, I would
move on. I was only then about ten yards from the wall and, once
right up, knew I should be completely under cover and safe from
any firing from the house.</p>

<p>I started to drag myself along, but with my first movement, I
became faint again. My wound began to hurt terribly. I waited a
few seconds and then tried again. This time it was a little
better and then gradually and very slowly I approached the wall.
I could move only inch by inch, and left a bloody trail behind
me as I crawled, but I reached the ditch at last, and, slipping
down under the barbed wire, propped myself thankfully up against
the wall.</p>

<p>I rested for a minute or two and then began again to take an
interest in what was going on.</p>

<p>What the deuce was up, I thought. There was a dead silence
everywhere and no sign of life at all either in the house or on
the road below.</p>

<p>I began at last to think I must have been unconscious for
some hours when I was hit, instead of only for some seconds, as
I had before imagined. Perhaps the fight was all over; they had
gone away and I had been forgotten or left for dead.</p>

<p>The idea began to worry me, and I was just about to crawl out
of the ditch again and make sure, when suddenly I heard the
chief's whistle, followed immediately by the answering clash of
rifles, as before.</p>

<p>Someone, too, was now firing just over my
head&mdash;evidently the caretaker was only just over the other
side of the wall.</p>

<p>For about a minute the firing went on violently. Then it
stopped abruptly; there was almost the same uncanny silence,
except that I could now plainly hear someone walking about in
the yard.</p>

<p>Then came the sound of splashing water and my curiosity began
to get the better of my pain. What on earth was the caretaker
doing now, and could I possibly take him unawares?</p>

<p>He couldn't for a moment have an idea that anyone was so near
him, and I might perhaps get him off his guard.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully I hauled myself up the side of the
ditch. My thigh hurt me terribly, but I bit hard on my lip to
keep back the faintness, and, holding my automatic ready, at
last I got my head above the wall.</p>

<p>The caretaker was having a drink of water. He was not five
yards from me, and the wonder was he had not heard my groans as
I climbed up. The falling of the splashing water had evidently
deadened them.</p>

<p>He was bending down with his mouth close to the tap, but with
his right hand was still grasping his rifle.</p>

<p>There seemed to be blood all over the yard, and close to the
back door, in two huge pools, lay the stretched out bodies of
the great hounds that had threatened me the previous day. One
was facing towards me, and appeared to have had its throat cut.
Its great tongue was lolling out. The windows had been smashed
to atoms, and there were bullet-marks all down the walls of the
house.</p>

<p>All these details I took in automatically. Suddenly then I
felt my thoughts beginning to wander, and it was with difficulty
I turned my eyes again to the man and covered him over the heart
with my automatic.</p>

<p>The movement must have caught his eye for he looked up, and
saw me. He dropped the rifle instantly and put up his hands.</p>

<p>"All right, mate," he said quickly, "don't shoot. I'll give
in. I'm fed up and want some sleep."</p>

<p>I just eyed him dreamily, and he went on.</p>

<p>"I'll hang&mdash;but I've had a bonzer time. Look at the
blood there's been."</p>

<p>My eyes had almost closed in weakness, but his words brought
all my wits together with a snap.</p>

<p>I thought rapidly. In any case the man was doomed. He was a
murderer, and as a murderer he would have to die. I, too, had
been a murderer once, but I was one no more. No one knew yet
what I had been, and only this man here held the secret of my
guilt. If he spoke&mdash;then I might hang as he would
hang&mdash;but in his silence I was safe. The sweetness of the
hope thrilled through me. Yes&mdash;safe! Safe to live a new
life&mdash;to live in honour and respect&mdash;to hold the warm
and clinging form of Lucy in my arms&mdash;perhaps to have
children by her and perhaps one day to hear the little feet come
pattering to my side.</p>

<p>Oh! it was more than I could chance to lose. I grew cold and
steady all at once. I ceased to tremble and I was no longer
faint. My wound hurt me no more and the blood that spurted from
my thigh crimsoned unnoticed down the wall.</p>

<p>I held the automatic straight before me, and aiming just
below the heart&mdash;resolutely pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The man fell instantly in a great sea of blood, but, coldly
and confidently, I put two more bullets in him as he lay. I was
taking no risks.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;all the blackness of the world descended on me and
with a hoarse cry for help I fell tottering from the wall.</p>

<p>My consciousness came back partly as they were lifting me
into the ambulance. The chief was bending over me. "Man, man," I
heard him say, "you may be only a damned office clerk, but in
this poor little play of ours you've a perfect genius for taking
on all the principal parts, and acting jolly well in them,
too."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; IN THE HOSPITAL.</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS four weeks in the Adelaide Hospital, but
of the first days I remember very little. The earliest memory
that I have is of waking up and thinking I was in a church. It
was night and my eyes opened to the dimness of great high walls.
It was almost still, but there was the far-away whispering, as
of people at their prayers. I was in great pain and I could hear
that I groaned.</p>

<p>Immediately a white-clad figure glided up, and something icy
cold went on my head. Then I felt the prick of a needle and the
shadows deepened and everything faded quickly away.</p>

<p>Then I was in a great deep pit fighting with a lot of devils;
I thought I was being killed, but a grave-eyed man jumped down
into the pit and threw me up over the side. I seemed to have a
lot to do with that man in those days. He was cold and stern to
look at, but when he touched me&mdash;his touch was the touch of
a lover. He seemed always to be my master, deciding whether he
should give me life or death.</p>

<p>Then one day&mdash;oh day, glorious to remember!&mdash;I
awakened to spring and sunshine and the smell of beautiful
flowers. I was getting better.</p>

<p>The great surgeon who had operated on me&mdash;I learnt
afterwards I had fractured my skull in falling from the
wall&mdash;came and sat by my bed and talked very kindly to me.
He told me I was going to get quite well and strong again. I had
had a very near shave, he said, but there was no reason now why
I should not be as well again as I had ever been in my life. He
told me I had been a very good patient and he smiled on me like
a judge who had forgiven me my sins.</p>

<p>Directly I was well enough a lot of people came to see me.
First there was the Chief Commissioner of the Police. He gave me
all the news. He smiled whimsically and, in mock relief,
informed me the special constables had all been disbanded, and
he hoped he might never see them again. He was very nice and
friendly and told me he would sure be coming to my wedding.</p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;all the world knew I was going to be married,
and there would be no church or chapel large enough in Adelaide
to hold all who wanted to come. Then he grinned broadly and
asked me if I would like to have Meadows for my best man. When I
declined laughingly, he got up to go with the final promise that
if I couldn't get anyone else&mdash;he'd be best man
himself.</p>

<p>Then there was Sir Bartle Elkin. He was kind and chatty.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Wacks," he said. "I don't suppose I shall ever
strike a more interesting study than yourself. All along you
have interested me, and right up to the very last, you have
given me things to think about and problems to solve. The
hallucinations of your delirium, for instance, were most
peculiar.</p>

<p>"If you remember, the last image to strike upon your retina
before you became unconscious was that of the man you shot.
Probably at the moment of his falling you would have noted the
immediate effect of your bullet on his chest. Well, all the time
you were delirious that last impression of yours was uppermost
in your mind to the exclusion of everything else. The color
seemed absolutely to obsess you.</p>

<p>"Somehow you confused it with a paste, but it was always red
paste you kept referring to. Red paste, everything with you was
red. The redness of blood was the last thing you saw, and
through all your wanderings, through all your delirium, that
color was always in your thoughts. Everything else was wiped
out. It is most interesting to me that this last impression was
the only one to survive. I must have another talk about it with
you later."</p>

<p>I was very glad when the great man left&mdash;and privately
determined in future to give him a wide berth. He would be
bringing up to me the very things I wanted to forget.</p>

<p>Then there was Matthew Brickett.</p>

<p>He came in breathing very hard, ponderous, paternal and in
his Sunday black. He took a solemn interested stare at one of
the nurses who was very pretty, and then settled down to a
careful scrutiny of my appearance.</p>

<p>"You're looking better than I should have thought, Peter," he
said at length, "but I do hope they're not giving you anything
that isn't strictly teetotal. It I could see the doctor now for
a few minutes I could put him in possession of some facts that
would prove absolutely that alcohol is a curse. Is he anywhere
about, do you know?"</p>

<p>Fortunately I was able to say with truth that the doctor
never visited us at that time of the day and, much to Brickett's
disgust, he had to be content with the delivery of a long homily
to the patient in the next bed. The man was almost stone deaf,
but he seemed to me very gratified with the attention he was
receiving, for he shook old Brickett warmly by the hand when at
last he got up to go.</p>

<p>Then there was Lucy. Dear little Lucy&mdash;she came to me
without a word and, not minding who saw, flung her arms round my
neck. I thought I had never seen her look so pretty. She
whispered tenderly to me of the anxious times she had been
having, but how all now would so soon be forgotten in the
glorious days that were to come. With much blushing, she told me
she wanted to be married at once so that she could take me away
for a long holiday to get well and strong again.</p>

<p>She said that all that happened that last morning at Grange
had caused a tremendous sensation in the city, and, directly it
was known I was going to get better, over ten thousand pounds
had been raised by public subscription to be given me for a
wedding present. Also Mrs. Matthew Russell, now that her husband
was dead, was going back to her people in England and she had
made over to me, completely and just as it stood, their
beautiful little home at Victor Harbor. We were to go there,
Lucy said, for our honeymoon.</p>

<p>I hardly like to remember exactly what my thoughts were after
Lucy left me, but in the end I know I silenced my conscience by
insisting to myself that after all it was only Fate again, and
that everything was happening just as it had been ordained it
should happen right from the very beginning of the world. I was
only a pawn, again I told myself, but this time a very happy and
a very fortunate one. I made up my mind not to bother any more
but just to take what the gods were giving me. I should only
live once.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; OUR WEDDING.</h2>

<p class="first">SHE woke up thinking of her marriage, and Life
called to her as the birds call to one another at waking morn.
The virgin angels smiled down tearfully upon her, but the
mothers of Heaven blessed her and God made her queen in the
kingdom of one man.</p>

<p><br>
IN the last week of May we were married&mdash;in the little
chapel on the Port Road, where for so many years Lucy had knelt
to pray in her sweet, untroubled maiden days.</p>

<p>She said that after all the time she had been going there, it
would be very mean for her to be married anywhere else, and with
the love that I saw in her eyes I could refuse her nothing. So I
agreed at once, and accordingly it was the noisy Pitchfellow who
read&mdash;or rather shouted&mdash;the marriage service over
us.</p>

<p>I quite think the reverend gentleman must have had a real
bonzer time, and he just swelled over with the importance of it
all.</p>

<p>The little chapel was packed full with the notabilities of
the city, and in the address that he gave us Pitchfellow shouted
to his heart's content. The voice that breathed o'er Eden was
indeed a strident one on this occasion, and I can recall now the
amazement on the faces of some of the congregation when
Pitchfellow let himself fairly go.</p>

<p>Old Brickett was intensely proud of all the noise he made,
and kept on looking round to see how the people were taking it.
I am sure it must have been quite a novelty to them.</p>

<p>Lucy was pretty as any bride could be, and I could conceive
of nothing sweeter or more entrancing than the gentle face which
peeped out shyly from under the bridal veil.</p>

<p>The service was soon over, but the city authorities gave a
reception in our honor at the Town Hall, and it was fully two
hours later, before the car set out for Victor Harbor.</p>

<p>It was in the falling dusk that we reached home.</p>

<p>What can any man write of his honeymoon?</p>

<p>O Youth!&mdash;O Love!&mdash;O Paradise! In all life's
happenings can there be anything more hallowed than those first
memories of wedded days.</p>

<p>The Plumbing absolute of the deeps of joy. The full fierce
realization of all those hopes and longings that at all times
have been at once the goad and ecstacy of humankind. The
fulfilment of love's dream. The heady draught of love's desire.
The trust, the sweetness and the surrender of the bride. The
giving up of everything to the man she loves. The fevered
placing in his keeping of all that innocence and honour she can
never give to anyone again. The whole sacredness and mystery of
it all.</p>

<p>Surely, never, never, in a man's life can he climb again so
nearly to the great white summit of all earthly joy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; A GREAT EVANGELIST.</h2>

<p class="first">FOR three years I was supremely happy.
Before the first had quite spent its course, the call of a new
life touched on Lucy and the great rapture of parentage came to
us. It was a little son.</p>

<p>Oh! how I loved that little boy, and how proud I was of him,
too! He was a bold and fearless little chap, and people said he
was like me. Sometimes when he smiled I caught a look that
reminded me of myself, but I always saw his mother in his
eyes.</p>

<p>A year later another boy came, and in all the wide world
through there could not have been anywhere a family happier than
was ours.</p>

<p>Being now quite independent I had resigned my post at Winter
and Winter and had taken to the thorny paths of literature. I
was not without some gifts in that direction, and began to make
headway in the Commonwealth Press.</p>

<p>Life seemed all happiness to us then. The past troubled me no
more. I never allowed myself to dwell upon it, and by tacit but
unspoken agreement Lucy and I never referred to it at all. She,
because the doctors had told her, after my illness, that I had
best forget it, and I&mdash;because I never wanted to recall the
faintest memory of those dreadful days.</p>

<p>Well, time rolled on and we had been married just over three
years and a half, when a well-known revivalist preacher came to
Victor Harbor and in an evil hour I went to hear him.</p>

<p>I went more out of curiosity than anything else, and at first
I was only rather amused. He was not a patch on me as far as
oratory was concerned, and the abrupt way in which he generally
ended his sentences jarred horribly on my nerves. Some of his
ideas too were very crude and narrow and there was too much of
that smug certainty about the next world, which so many
preachers always affect.</p>

<p>But he was a man of great earnestness and sincerity, and in
spite of myself I came under his thrall. His great theme
was&mdash;repentance. Who had sinned must one day repent, he
insisted, or God would surely punish him&mdash;punish him either
in himself or in them he loved best. No one could escape.
However deep and long-forgotten were the sin, God had remembered
it, and in His own good time would exact
punishment&mdash;punishment sure and certain.</p>

<p>I had gone alone to hear him, and I left the chapel that
night, very disturbed and most uneasy in my mind. What if my
Paradise were after all but the vain Paradise of fools! What if
all the happiness that then was mine were but to prepare me more
fully for the punishment that was about to fall. How would the
punishment come? Might it, indeed, be Lucy or my little sons who
would suffer? The very thought affrightened me and I hurried
home in fear.</p>

<p>Directly I got home I thought Lucy looked ill. She was much
whiter than usual and very quiet. She hardly talked at supper
and ate nothing at all. Next morning she was too ill to get up,
and I was in a perfect fear of dread.</p>

<p>In a great hurry I fetched the doctor. Lucy had a high
temperature and he could say nothing for certain. In two days,
however, pneumonia had definitely set in and in a week she was
going to die.</p>

<p>Grief unutterable came upon me, and my mind almost gave way.
All the reserve that I had built up against the memories of the
past broke down, and I frankly recognized all that was now
happening as the punishment for my dreadful crimes. Lucy was to
be the scapegoat&mdash;Lucy and the little sons. Lucy was going
to die, and motherless for ever would my children be.</p>

<p>I threw myself upon my knees in an agony of grief and,
choking back my tears, burst into prayer.</p>

<p>Never had I prayed so before; never had prayer touched me as
it touched me then. I promised my life if Lucy were spared, all
that I had. All that was in me, all my life long, should be
consecrated and given up to the saving of men's souls. The
pleasures and the happiness of this world should no longer tempt
me and I would live only for the conversion and salvation of
others.</p>

<p>I almost fainted with the intensity of my emotion and I rose
dazed and giddy from my knees, but I rose in faith and hope
too.</p>

<p>Lucy would live now and mine alone would be the cross and
crown of thorns. I had sown and I should reap and the innocent
would go free.</p>

<p>Lucy got better. Slowly but surely she threw off her
sickness. Gradually health returned, and in a month she was
almost her old self again. A little thinner, perhaps, a little
paler, but the same old Lucy, with the gentle face and smiling
ways.</p>

<p>It was I that had altered more. I had grown stern again. I
was pre-occupied and seldom smiled. When I played with the
children I did it as a matter of duty and never allowed myself
any happiness in their games. I had not forgotten my vow. One
day I told Lucy I was going to train for the ministry, but she
laughed merrily and told me she disliked ministers, and if I
became one she would never make love to me any more. She said
nearly all good ministers of religion were 'softs' and, while
the people tolerated them publicly, in private they always held
them, at best, in more or less good-natured contempt. She tried
to laugh me out of it, but I was not to be denied, and a month
later entered a training college to prepare.</p>

<p>The restraint there, however, chafed upon me, and I found,
too, that many of my views of life were too unorthodox to be
acceptable to the governing bodies.</p>

<p>Their creeds seemed cold and narrow to me, and they made such
harm of little things. They frightened people away.</p>

<p>After six months' residence in the college I resigned and
came away; but full of my resolve I became a free-lance and
offered my services to whomsoever would care to make use of
them. I called myself a travelling evangelist.</p>

<p>It was not long before I had more preaching than I could do.
Sorrow and fear had purged my soul; and I was in deadly earnest
in all I said. The gift of oratory was mine naturally, and all
the added tricks I picked up quickly as I went along. I soon got
a reputation. In less than a year, whenever I was announced to
preach anywhere the place would be packed long before the
meeting had begun. When I stood up to speak there was always
that tense expectant hush, as when men look for great things. I
could hold a congregation for an hour without them tiring. I
could bring tears upon their faces and make them sob and cry. I
could put fear into their hearts, and terrify them with visions
of the wrath to come. Then I could comfort them in their sorrow,
and bring golden rays of hope and faith into their drab lives. I
could lift them up in frenzied exultation and then bring them,
silent and quaking, to their knees.</p>

<p>Repentance was always what I preached about.
Repentance&mdash;and the atonement that must follow after.</p>

<p>As time went on I was called to all parts of the Commonwealth
and sometimes for weeks on end was away from home. I never
spared myself, for it had become more and more an obsession with
me that if I relaxed my efforts, even in the slightest degree,
evil would fall at once again upon those I loved.</p>

<p>Yes, I still loved Lucy and my little sons, but remorse and
fear had quite got possession of me, and I dared not give in.
Often I wanted to die, so that my sin at last might be expiated
to the full.</p>

<p><br>
IT is two years now since I wrote the above, and I take up my
pen again to add a few words. I am much saner now. I think I
almost went mad. I am still a deeply religious man, but I
believe now my sins are forgiven me. I gave up preaching because
at last it came to an absolute breakdown. I had so worked myself
up that in the end I could do no public speaking at all. When I
stood up I could only stutter and stammer and find no speech for
my thoughts. So I went back to Lucy and my sons and I am happy
and at peace again.</p>

<p>But I have never been unmindful that I owe some reparation to
my country, and tomorrow I sail for Europe in a unit of the Army
Medical Corps.</p>

<p>England has called to us in her peril, and I shall always
like my children to remember that their father was one of the
first to respond to her call.</p>

<p>I am sorry at times that I ever penned anything of these
happenings, and often have been inclined to burn the manuscript.
I shall let it be, however, for the present, but I shall take
good care it may be so placed as to never see the light until
all concerned in it have passed away.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; SIX YEARS AFTER.</h2>

<h3>NOTE BY COLONEL JOHN MEADOWS, D.S.O.,<br>
CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF THE ADELAIDE POLICE.</h3>

<p class="first">THE foregoing MS. came into my hands under
circumstances that were quite accidental and that are
unnecessary in the public interest to disclose.</p>

<p>Peter Wacks is dead. He died heroically on the occasion of
the landing at Suvla Bay and the manner of his death is known to
all the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wacks left the Commonwealth with her two sons over four
years ago, and we are given to understand she has married again.
A prominent resident of this city, when in the United States the
year before last, recognised her when on holiday in the Rocky
Mountains. He does not remember her new name, but he brought
back the news that she was very happily married to a wealthy
South American rancher, and that there was another child now of
this second marriage. She was always a very charming woman.</p>

<p>I have very carefully gone into this so-called confession of
the dead man, and I admit at once that I find it very difficult
to know exactly what to say.</p>

<p>To begin with&mdash;anything at all written by Wacks must be
received with a certain amount of suspicion and reserve.</p>

<p>In his confession Wacks does not tell us&mdash;indeed,
perhaps he himself was not aware of the fact&mdash;that for six
months he was an inmate of a Mental Asylum. His was an extreme
case of religious mania, and his detention followed immediately
upon his two years' crusade, as, so he called himself, a
travelling evangelist.</p>

<p>His mind completely broke down, and at first it was believed
his condition of mania would be permanent.</p>

<p>It is true, as he says, that he was a great preacher. His
oratory was at all times of a very high order, and the command
that he had of his audiences was marvellous. Wherever he went he
was received by great crowds of admirers&mdash;and, towards the
end, there were no buildings large enough to accommodate all who
desired to hear him. His preaching, however, was of a most
frenzied and emotional nature, and in the course of his two
years' ministry, he was undoubtedly responsible for dispatching
a good many down the path he ultimately went himself. He played
on the fears and terrors of his listeners in a most unhealthy
way.</p>

<p>In regard to the crimes that he lays so unsparingly at his
own door&mdash;the authorities have for a long time been aware
of all that he credited himself with.</p>

<p>During his detention at the Mental Asylum he repeatedly
declared himself the author of the crimes enumerated in his MS.
and of many other crimes as well.</p>

<p>It is most difficult to separate the false from the true. To
some extent one is inclined at first to dismiss at once any idea
of Wacks' complicity in the perpetration of those dreadful
murders that shook this city just over eleven years ago.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, his confession discloses at times so
intimate and accurate a knowledge of all the details of the
bloody happenings of those days, that I am reluctantly compelled
to believe there must be at least some truth in what he
writes.</p>

<p>For myself, I had always a suspicion at the time that the
second half of the murders were of quite a different order to
those of the first, and that they were, moreover, carried out by
quite a different kind of assassin.</p>

<p>Also, I was always quite certain that the caretaker of Mr.
Silas Magrath could not have been the man who made off with the
policeman's bicycle at Government House, and subsequently
disposed of it in the gravel pit off the Torrens Road. His legs
were quite three inches too short.</p>

<p>Then, too, much which Wacks tells us of other happenings that
can be checked and verified are perfectly true.</p>

<p>For example, there is no doubt he broke into my room and went
through my diary. I have looked up some of the entries and they
are exactly as he says. Then again&mdash;he admits burning his
suit because of the blood-stains down the front. I knew at the
time he had done it, and informed my superiors. Again, he solves
clearly the puzzle of Boulter's rabbits and explains the
quietness of his dog, Nell.</p>

<p>Everything dovetails in the most accurately, and time after
time Wacks shows himself the possessor of inside knowledge. How,
for instance, could he have known of the theft of the
policeman's cap and cape, unless, indeed, he had taken them
himself? Their loss was never reported, and was known only to
Policeman Hogan, the Chief Commissioner, and myself.</p>

<p>Then there is that reference to the iron bar that we seized
and that he affirms he had used with such deadly effect on his
poor victims. He says it was part of the handle of an old-fashioned
linen press. Here he is quite right. I have had
inquiries made recently and the handle of an old Lissom press
was brought to me. It is the very facsimile of the weapon the
would-be murderer threw away that Saturday night at
Prospect.</p>

<p>Altogether there are many things that point almost with
certainty to the truth of at least some portion of what he
writes.</p>

<p>I have shown the MS. to Mr. Frederick Waller, the new
Chairman of the Stipendiary Stewards. He knew Wacks personally
for several years and distinctly remembers the affair of 'The
Boss.' He says everything happened exactly as Wacks describes,
and that there is no exaggeration.</p>

<p>Sir Bartle Elkin also, has read the MS. He altogether
discredits the idea that Wacks could in any way have been the
perpetrator of the murders he describes. He believes his
confession to be, as he says, only the pathological fantasy of a
very imaginative mind. He informs me that he is well acquainted
with the Malayan preparation so constantly referred to by Wacks,
and he admits, curiously, that it is generally exhibited in the
form of a red paste, but he denies positively that it could have
preserved its properties for twenty years. He says in three
months, at longest, it would have been harmless. He refuses to
admit also the possibility that Wacks could by any chance have
been under the influence of the drug upon the many occasions
when he had conversations with him. He says he was always most
interested in Wacks, and took particular note of everything
about him. He is sure there were no signs then of any mental
aberration, and his pupils were always quite normal.</p>

<p>In conclusion, he believes the entire motive of Wacks'
confession to be the desire, so often exhibited in cases of like
mania, vicariously to take upon himself the burden of other
people's crimes. It was Wacks' obsession, he says, that he was
ordained to offer himself as sacrifice for the sins and
shortcomings of the world.</p>

<p>The report Sir Bartle furnished me with was most interesting,
but I shall always disagree with him on a great many points. I
think he regards the whole matter from the too-narrow standpoint
of purely medical knowledge. He brushes aside all the many
damning facts that to my mind indisputably link Peter Wacks in
some ways with the murderer.</p>

<p>But there I must leave it now.</p>

<p>Whether Wacks was really the murderer or not, it will be
always impossible to decide absolutely.</p>

<p>The pros and cons will no doubt always be emphatically
discussed, for in an age when all the world is striving
feverishly after ideals, it is a sad commentary on the frailty
of our nature that the contemplation of things evil should be of
far more interest to us than the contemplation of things
good.</p>

<p>Crime may indeed repel, but&mdash;it fascinates, always.</p>
