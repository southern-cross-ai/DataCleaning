<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I - AT WHOSE HAND?</a></h2>
<p>A HANSOM pulled up in front of 799, Park Lane, and a slim figure of a woman,
dressed in deep mourning, ran up the broad flight of marble steps leading to
the house. Her features were closely concealed by a thick veil, so that the
footman who answered the ring could make nothing of the visitor. Her voice was
absolutely steady as she asked to see Lord Ravenspur at once.</p>
<p>"That is impossible, madam," the footman protested; "his lordship is not yet
down, and besides&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no 'besides' about it," the visitor said, imperiously. "It is a
matter of life and death."</p>
<p>Once more the servant hesitated. There was something about this woman that
commanded his respect. The hour was still early for Park Lane, seeing that it
was barely nine o'clock, and the notable thoroughfare was practically deserted.
From the distance came the hoarse cries of a number of newsboys who were racing
across the Park. One of them came stumbling down Park Lane, filling the fresh
spring atmosphere with his shouts. Evidently something out of the common had
happened to bring these birds of ill omen westward at so early an hour. With
the curiosity of his class the footman turned to listen.</p>
<p>"Terrible murder in Fitzjohn Square! Death Mr. Louis Delahay, the famous
artist! Artist found dead in his studio! Full details!"</p>
<p>The well-trained servant forgot his manners for a moment.</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed," it can't be true. Why Mr. Delahay was a great
friend of my master up to the last day or two&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am Mrs. Delahay," the veiled woman said with quiet intentness. "Please
don't stand staring at me like that, but take me to your master at once. It is
imperative that I should see Lord Ravenspur without a moment's delay."</p>
<p>The footman collected his scattered wits, and stammered out some kind of
apology. There were other newsboys racing down the Lane now. It seemed all of
London was ringing with the name of Louis Delahay Then the great double doors
of the big house closed sullenly and shut out the horrid sound. At any other
time the veiled woman might have been free to admire the luxury and extravagant
good taste of her surroundings There were many people who regarded Lord
Ravenspur as the most fortunate and talented man in London. Not only had he
been born to the possession of a fine title, but he had almost unlimited wealth
as well. if this were not suffIcient, Nature had endowed him with a handsome
presence and an intellect far beyond common. Apparently there was nothing that
Ravenspur could not do. He was a fine sportsman, and a large number of his
forty-odd years had been spent big game shooting abroad. What time he passed in
England was devoted almost exclusively to artistic pursuits. As a portrait
painter Ravenspur stood on a level with the great masters of his time. More
than one striking example of sculpture had come from his chisel. He had as much
honour in the Salons of Vienna and Paris as he had within the walls of
Burlington House. In fine, Ravenspur was a great personage, a popular figure in
society, and well known everywhere. His lavish hospitality was always in the
best of good taste, and the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to 799, Park Lane was
accounted a rare privilege by all his friends.</p>
<p>But the woman in black was thinking nothing of this, as she followed the
footman along marble corridors to a sunny morning-room at the back of the
house. The footman indicated a chair, but the visitor waved him aside with a
gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>"Go and fetch your master at once," she said.</p>
<p>For a few moments she paced up and down, weaving her way in and out amongst
the rare objects of art like a wild animal that is freshly caged. She threw
back her long, black veil presently as if the atmosphere of the place stifled
her. Her face might have been that of a marble statue, so intensely white and
rigid it was. It was only the rapid dilation of the dark eyes which showed that
the stranger had life and feeling at all. She turned abruptly as Lord Ravenspur
came into the room. His handsome, smiling face and prematurely iron-grey hair
afforded a strong contrast to the features of his visitor. He came forward with
extended hands.</p>
<p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Maria," he said. "But what is wrong? Louis
is all right, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Louis is dead!" the woman said in the same cold, strained voice. "He has
been foully murdered. I could not say more if I spoke for an hour. Louis is
dead!"</p>
<p>The speaker repeated the last three words over and over again as if she were
trying to realise the dread significance of her own message. Ravenspur stood
there with his hand to his head, shocked and grieved almost beyond the power of
speech.</p>
<p>"This is terrible," he murmured at length. "My dear Maria, I cannot find
words to express my sympathy. Could you tell me how it happened? But perhaps I
am asking too much."</p>
<p>"No," Mrs. Delahay replied, still speaking with the utmost calmness; "I am
ready to answer any question you like to put to me. I am absolutely dazed and
stunned. As yet I can realise nothing. But, perhaps, before the reaction comes
I had better tell you everything. To think that I should lose him in this way
whilst I am still a bride! But I dare not pity myself as yet, there is far too
much stern work to be done. There will be plenty of time later on for the
luxury of grief."</p>
<p>"Won't you sit down?" Ravenspur murmured.</p>
<p>"My dear friend, I couldn't. I must be walking about. I feel as if I could
walk about for years. But I will try and tell you how it happened. He came back
to London yesterday afternoon, as you know, and put up at the Grand Hotel. You
see, I had never been in London before, and so I know nothing at all about it.
If we had only gone straight to our own house in Fitzjohn Square this dreadful
thing&mdash;but why do I think of that? You know the house was not quite ready
for us, and that was the reason why we went to the Grand. After visiting a
theatre last night Louis announced his intention of going as far as our house.
I understood him to say that he required something from his studio. There were
no caretakers on the premises, but Louis had a latchkey, so that was all right.
I went to bed about twelve o'clock, thinking no evil, and not in the least
alarmed because Louis had not come back. As you know, he had always been a
terribly late man, and I thought perhaps he had met one of his old companions,
or perhaps he had turned into the Garrick Club. Still, when I woke up this
morning about six, and found that he had not returned, I became genuinely
alarmed. I took a cab as far as Fitzjohn Square, and went into the house."</p>
<p>"One moment," Ravenspur interrupted. "I don't quite understand how you
managed to get into the premises."</p>
<p>"That was an easy matter, though the front door was closed. The latchkey was
still in the lock. I only had to turn it to obtain admission. I went straight
to the studio, and there on the floor&mdash;but I really cannot say any more.
Strung up as I am I could not describe it to you... I suppose I cried out, and
when I came back to a proper comprehension of things the place was full of
police. For the last two hours I have been with them answering all sorts of
questions. Then something told me to come to you, and here I am. And whatever
you do, please don't leave me alone. I could not bear to be alone."</p>
<p>"I wish I could tell you how sorry I am," Lord Ravenspur murmured. "This is
a most extraordinary business altogether. You say that Louis left you not later
than twelve o'clock to go as far as Fitzjohn Square, and that, when he left the
Grand Hotel, he had no other object in his mind. You are quite sure of
this?"</p>
<p>"I am absolutely certain," Mrs. Delahay replied. Well, that is a strange
thing," Ravenspur went on, "It so happens that I had an accident to my own
studio a day or two ago, and until yesterday the workmen were in repairing the
glass roof. I was engaged upon a small work which I was anxious to finish, and
it occurred to me that I might just as well make use of your husband's studio,
seeing that he was away from home and did not require it. I obtained a
duplicate key from the house agent, and all yesterday I was working on my
picture there. In fact it is in Louis' studio at the present moment. After some
friends who were dining with me last night left, I walked as far as Fitzjohn
Square, and till nearly a quarter past one this morning I was at work there. I
might have gone on all night, only the electric light failed suddenly, and I
was left in darkness. Then I came home and went to bed. And I am prepared to
swear that it had turned half -past one before I left your house, and there was
no sign of Louis up to that time."</p>
<p>"It is inexplicable," the woman said wearily. "When I try to think my brain
seems to turn to water, and everything goes misty before my eyes. I feel like a
woman who has had no sleep for years. I feel as if I must get something to
relieve this terrible pressure on my brain. Is there nothing that you can
suggest?"</p>
<p>"I think so," Ravenspur said quietly. "I am going to take you back to your
hotel, and call for a doctor on the way. You cannot go on like this. No human
mind could stand it."</p>
<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">II - NO. 1 FITZJOHN SQUARE</a></h2>
<p>A FEW moments later and Ravenspur's brougham was being rapidly driven in the
direction of the Grand Hotel. No words were spoken on the journey, but
Ravenspur did not fail to notice how his companion shook and quivered as the
shouts of the newsboys reached her ears. It seemed as if all London had given
itself over to this last sensational tragedy. It was as if thousands of strange
rough hands were pressing upon the still bleeding wound. To an intensely
sympathetic nature like Ravenpsur's, the relief of the destination was great.
At his suggestion of food his companion shuddered. The mere idea of it turned
her physically sick. Utterly worn out and exhausted she dropped into a chair.
There was a light now of something like madness in her eyes. The doctor bustled
in presently with something in his hand. Mrs. Delahay drank the medicine in a
mechanical way, scarcely knowing what she was doing. Then, gradually, her rigid
limbs relaxed, and the staring dark eyes were closed.</p>
<p>"She'll do now for some time," the doctor whispered. I have telephoned for a
nurse who may be here now at any moment. Don't let me detain you. I have got my
motor outside, and in any case I must remain till the nurse arrives."</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Ravenspur murmured. "As far as I am concerned I
should like to make some inquiries. I have known Delahay now for the last five
years; indeed, it was I who persuaded him to take up his quarters in London. It
seems a terrible thing that so promising a career should be cut short like
this. That man would have come to the top of his profession, and, so far as I
know, he hadn't a single enemy in the world. Perhaps, by this time, the
Scotland Yard people may have found a clue."</p>
<p>Ravenspur drove straight away to Fitzjohn Square, and made his way through
the crowd of morbid folks who had gathered outside. As he expected, he found
the house' in the hands of the police. Inspector Dallas came forward and
greeted him respectfully.</p>
<p>"This is a terrible affair, my lord," he said.</p>
<p>"Ghastly," Ravenspur exclaimed. "It was a great shock when Mrs. Delahay came
round to me this morning. And the strange part of the whole business is that I
was in this very house myself, quite alone, till half-past one. Perhaps I had
better explain the circumstances to you, as the knowledge might prove useful...
And now you know all about it. Mind you, I saw nothing; I did not hear a sound.
Indeed, I am quite convinced that there was no one on the premises when I
left&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But you had no means of making sure," the inspector protested. "The
miscreants might have been here all the time. They might have been hiding in a
room upstairs waiting for you to go."</p>
<p>"They might have attacked me as far as that goes," Ravenspur replied. "My
word, the mere suggestion of it turns one cold."</p>
<p>"At any rate, they were not after your lordship," the inspector said,
thoughtfully. "Of course, I am assuming for the sake of argument that the
murderer, or murderers, were actually here when you arrived last night. If so,
the whole thing was carefully premeditated. These people had no quarrel with
you, and, therefore, they did not molest you. All the same, they wanted to get
rid of you, or they would not have cut off the light."</p>
<p>"But did they cut off the light?" Ravenspur asked. "That we can prove in a
moment. I am going on the theory that these people wanted to get you out of the
way, so they short-circuited the current and left you in darkness. That was a
very useful expedient, and had the desired effect. I am very glad you told me
this because it may be the means of putting us on the track of important
evidence. But let us go down to the basement, and examine the electric
meter."</p>
<p>Ravenspur followed his companion down the dark steps leading to the
basement, and Inspector Dallas struck a light. Then, with a grim smile, he
pointed to a cable which led from the meter to the different rooms on the upper
floors. The cable had been clean cut with some sharp instrument, a fracture
which must have been recently made, for the main wire to the cable gleamed like
gold.</p>
<p>"So far, so good," Dallas said. "We have proved by yonder demonstration that
these people were here last night whilst you were actually at work in the
studio."</p>
<p>"That puzzles me more than ever," Ravenspur replied. "Why did they not get
rid of me an hour before, which they could have done equally as well, by the
same simple expedient?"</p>
<p>"Simply because they could afford to wait till half-past one. You may depend
upon it that Mr. Delahay's movements were absolutely known to them. They were
perfectly well aware of the fact that he was not expected here till some time
past half-past one. It is not a nice insinuation to make, but when Mr. Delahay
left his hotel at midnight, he had not the slightest intention of coming
straight here. Doubtless he had important business which was likely to last him
an hour and a half, and for some reason or other he did not want his wife to
know what it was. Speaking as one man of the world to another, Mr. Delahay's
excuse for getting out strikes me as being rather a shallow one. Surely a
married man, more or less on his honeymoon, does not want to visit an empty
house after midnight. Surely he could have waited till daylight."</p>
<p>"Then you think he went out to keep an appointment?"</p>
<p>"I feel quite convinced of it, your lordship. And, moreover, the appointment
was a secret one of which Mrs. Delahay was to know nothing. I will go still
further, and say that Mr. Delahay came here after you had gone this morning to
keep an appointment. It is just possible that he might have been in the house
during your presence here. It is just possible that he cut the cable
himself."</p>
<p>"Ah, but that won't quite do," Ravenspur protested. "When I came out of the
house this morning I saw that to swear that the latchkey which Mrs. Delahay
found this morning was not in the lock then. No, no; I am quite sure that poor
Delahay must have come here after I left. I am not prepared to contest your
theory that my unfortunate friend came here to keep an appointment. Indeed, the
presence of the latchkey in the door proves that he was in a hurry, and perhaps
a little upset, or he would not have committed the mistake of leaving the key
behind him. But after all, said and done, this is merely conjecture on our
part. Have you found anything yourself that is likely to give you a clue?"</p>
<p>Inspector Dallas hesitated just for a moment.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I ought not to mention it," he said, "but I am sure I can rely upon
your lordship's discretion. When I was called this morning I found Mr. Delahay
lying on the floor of the studio quite dead. So far as we could see there were
no marks of violence on the body except a small puncture over the heart, which
appears to have been made with some very fine instrument. But. of course, we
can't speak definitely on that point till we have had the inquest. As far as we
can judge, something like a struggle must have taken place, because the loose
carpets on the floor were in great disorder, and one or two articles of
furniture had been overturned. You may say that this proves nothing, except
that violence was used. But in the hand of the dead man we found something that
might be useful to us. Perhaps you would like to see it."</p>
<p>Lord Ravenspur intimated that he should. From a pocket-book Dallas produced
a photograph, <i>carte de visite</i> size, which had been torn into half a
dozen pieces.</p>
<p>The photograph was considerably faded, and in the tearing the actual face
itself had been ripped out of all recognition. Still, judging from the small
fragments, it was possible to make out that the picture had been that of a
woman. One scrap of card bore the words "and Co., Melbourne." The rest of the
lettering had apparently vanished.</p>
<p>"This must have been taken a long time ago," Ravenspur said. "It is so
terribly faded."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, my lord," Dallas said. "We know very little about that
photograph as yet except that it was taken in Australia. Of course, it is fair
to assume that the picture is an old one judging from the colouring, but your
lordship must not forget that foreign photographs are always much fainter than
those taken in this country, because the light is so much stronger and more
brilliant. At any rate, the fact remains that we found those fragments tightly
clenched in Mr. Delahay's left hand, all of which points to some intrigue, with
a woman at the bottom of it. Of course, I know nothing whatever about Mr.
Delahay's moral character&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you," Ravenspur said sharply. "My late friend was the soul
of honour. He was a very quick, passionate man, and he inherited his temper
from his Italian mother. But the man was incapable of anything mean or
dishonourable. He was genuinely in love with his wife, and cared nothing for
any other woman. How that photograph came into his possession I don't know.
Probably we never shall know. But you can at once dismiss from your mind the
suspicion that Delahay was mixed up in that vulgar kind of business. Now, is
there anything more you can tell me?"</p>
<p>"Well, no," Dallas said, after a short pause. "There is nothing that strikes
me, no suggestions that seem to need a doctor's opinion. We shall find that the
cause of death is the small puncture over the heart that I spoke of. To hazard
an opinion, it might be caused by one of those glass stilettos&mdash;the
Corsican type of weapon where the blade is snapped off in the wound. It leaves
the smallest mark, and no blood follows&mdash;a difficult thing to trace
without great care. Of course, the <i>post mortem</i>&mdash;"</p>
<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III - THE MARK OF THE BEAST.</a></h2>
<p>A SUDDEN quick cry broke from Ravenspur's lips. He fairly staggered back,
his white face was given over to a look of peculiar horror. Then, as he became
aware of the curious glances of his companion he made a great effort to regain
his self-control.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," he stammered. "A stiletto made of glass! A
long, slender blade like an exaggerated needle, I presume. Yet, now I come to
think of it, I recollect that, when I was painting a 'Borgia' subject once, my
costume dealer spoke of one of those Corsican daggers. I did not take much
interest in the conversation at the time. And so you have an idea that this is
the way in which my poor friend met his death?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur was speaking quietly and easily now. He had altogether regained
control of himself save for an occasional twitching of his lips. He paced up
and down the room thoughtfully for some time, utterly unconscious of Dallas'
sharp scrutiny.</p>
<p>"I suppose there is nothing more you have to tell me?" he said at length.
"This is evidently going to be one of those crimes which thrill a whole
community for a week, and then are never heard of again. Still, if there is
anything I can do for you, pray do not hesitate to ask for my assistance. I
suppose we can wait until after the inquest is over?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for any reply from his companion Ravenspur quitted the room,
and went back to his brougham. He threw himself into a corner, and pulled his
hat over his eyes. For a long time he sat there immersed in deep and painful
thought, and utterly unconscious of his surroundings. Even when the brougham
pulled up in Park Lane he made no attempt to dismount till the footman opened
the door and addressed him by name.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Walters," he said, "this terrible business
prevents my thinking about anything else. I am going into my own room now, and
I am not to be disturbed by anybody. K I am dining out to-night, tell Mr. Ford
to write and cancel the engagement. Oh, here is Ford himself."</p>
<p>The neat, clean-shaven secretary came forward.</p>
<p>"Your lordship seems to have forgotten," he said. "You are giving a dinner
here to-night yourself. You gave orders especially to arrange it, because you
were anxious for some of the Royal Academicians to meet the young Polish
artist&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I had clean forgotten it," Ravenspur said, with something like a groan.
"Entertaining people to-night will be like dancing in fetters. Still, I must
make the best of it, for I should not like that talented young foreigner to be
disappointed. In the meantime, I am not at home to anybody."</p>
<p>With this admonition Ravenspur passed up to his own private rooms, and
carefully locked the door behind him. He took a cigar from his case, and
lighted it, only to fling it away a moment later in disgust. He stood just for
a moment with his hand on a decanter of brandy, and then with a smile for his
own weakness poured out a glassful, which he drank without delay.</p>
<p>"I am a fool and a coward," he muttered. "What can there be to be afraid of
after all these years? Why do I hesitate in this way when boldness and decision
would avert the danger?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur sat there, looking moodily into space. He heard the house
resounding to the sound of the luncheon gong, but he made no movement. The mere
suggestion of food was repulsive to him, clean as his habits were and robust as
his appetite usually was. The Lane and the Park were gay with traffic now; the
roar of locomotion reached the ears of Ravenspur as he sat there. Presently the
noise of the newsboys came again, and the name of Delahay seemed to fill the
air to the exclusion of everything else. Ravenspur rang his bell, and asked for
a paper.</p>
<p>The flimsy, ill-printed sheet fairly reeked with the latest and most ghastly
of London tragedies. Nothing else seemed to matter for the moment. Seven or
eight columns were given over to an account of the affair. Before he set
himself down to read it steadily through, Ravenspur glanced at the last
paragraph, to find that the preliminary inquiry had been adjourned for a week.
Most of the florid sensational paragraphs contained nothing new. The only point
that interested the reader was the medical evidence.</p>
<p>This was compact and to the point. Death had been undoubtedly due to a stab
over the heart which had been inflicted by some long, pointed instrument, not
much thicker, apparently, than a needle. So far as the police doctor could say,
the weapon used had been an Italian stiletto. There was practically no blood.
Indeed, the whole thing had been accomplished in a cool and deliberate manner
by a man who was not only master of his art, but who must have possessed a
considerable knowledge of anatomy. Evidently he had chosen a spot to inflict
the wound with careful deliberation, for the deviation of half an inch either
way might have produced comparatively harmless results. It was the opinion of
the doctor that, had the fatal thrust been made through the bare skin, all
traces of it might have been overlooked. It was only the adherence of the dead
man's singlet to the tiny puncture that had caused sufficient inflammation to
attach suspicion to the point of impact. All this pointed to the fact that the
crime had been clearly premeditated and carried out coldly and
deliberately.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, the great puzzle was to discover how the murderer
had been aware that he would be in a position to find his victim at Fitzjohn
Square. It was proved conclusively enough that Louis Delahay had come back to
England on the spur of the moment, and that equally on the spur of the moment
he had made up his mind to visit his house, and, therefore, nobody could
possibly have known besides his wife when he had left the Grand Hotel. On this
point public curiosity would have to wait, seeing that Mrs. Delahay was in no
condition to explain. In fact, she was in the hands of a medical man who had
prescribed absolute quiet for the present.</p>
<p>Ravenspur tossed the paper impatiently aside, and rang for his tea. The slow
day dragged along until it was time for him to dress and prepare for the
reception of his guests. He came down presently to the drawing-room, where one
or two of the men had already assembled. His old pleasant smile was on his face
now. He was once more the polished, courtly man of the world. He steeled
himself for what he knew was coming. Practically the whole of his guests were
artists of distinction. And the death of Louis Delahay would be the one topic
of conversation. The blinds were down now, for the young spring night had drawn
in rapidly and it was perfectly dark outside. The clock struck the hour of
eight, and the butler glanced in inquiringly. Ravenspur shook his head.</p>
<p>"Not quite yet, Simmonds," he said; "we are waiting for Sir James Seton. As
he is usually the soul of punctuality he is not likely to detain us."</p>
<p>"You can take his place if necessary," one of the guests laughed. "When I
see Seton and our host together I always feel quite bewildered. Two such public
men had no business to be so absurdly alike."</p>
<p>"There is no real resemblance," Ravenspur laughed,"though people are
constantly making absurd mistakes. It is excusable to mistake one for the other
in the dark, but not in the daylight. Besides, Seton is a much taller man than
I am, and much slimmer. We should hear nothing about this likeness, but for
certain gentlemen of the Press who make their living out of little
paragraphs."</p>
<p>"Well, they have got plenty to occupy their attention now," another guest
remarked. "This business of poor Delahay's Is likely to give them occupation
for some time. Tell us all about it, Ravenspur. I hear that you were down at
Fitzjohn Square this morning. Is there anything fresh?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur groaned in his spirit. All the same, his manner was polished and
easy as he turned to the speaker. But before he had time to give any details
there was a sound of excited voices in the hall outside, the banging of a door
or two, and then a tall, elderly man staggered into the room, and fell into a
seat. There was an ugly scar on the side of his face, a few drops of blood
stained his immaculate shirt-front.</p>
<p>"Good Heavens!" Ravenspur cried. "My dear Seton, what is the matter?
Simmonds, bring the brandy here at once."</p>
<p>"No, no," the newcomer gasped; "I shall be all right in a minute or two. A
most extraordinary thing happened to me just now. I was coming towards the Lane
by the back of Lord Fairhaven's house on my way here when a man came out from
under the shadow of the trees, and commenced a violent attack upon me.
Fortunately, I was able to ward him off with my stick, but not before he had
marked me in the way you see. Somebody happened to be coming along, and my
assailant vanished. Still, it was a nasty adventure, and all the more
extraordinary because the fellow evidently, mistook me for our friend
Ravenspur. He actually called me by that name."</p>
<p>All eyes were turned in the host's direction, for a strange, choking cry
burst from his lips.</p>
<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV - A WOMAN'S FACE</a></h2>
<p>IT WAS such an unusual thing for Lord Ravenspur to show his feelings so
plainly. For the most part he passed as one of the most self-contained men in
London. He had always boasted, too, of perfect health. His nerves were in the
best condition. And now he had started to his feet, his hand pressed to his
heart, his face white, and wet with terror. More than one of the guests came
forward, but Ravenspur waved them aside.</p>
<p>"I am behaving like a child," he said. "I suppose the time comes when all of
us begin to feel the effect of approaching age. I don't know why Seton's
misfortunes should have upset me so much. But, perhaps, coming on the horrors
of this morning, it has been a little too much for me. It is a most scandalous
thing that a gentleman can't go out to dinner without being molested in this
fashion. What are the police thinking about?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur spoke in hot indignation; in fact, he was slightly overdoing it.
He fussed about Seton, and insisted that the latter should go up to his room,
which suggestion the guest waived aside. He was the far more collected of the
two.</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense," he said; "a canful of hot water will repair all the damage.
Don't you worry about me. You go in to dinner, and leave me to young Walter
here."</p>
<p>A door opened at that moment, and a young man entered, and came eagerly
across the room in the direction of the speaker. Walter Lance might have been
Lord Ravenspur as he had been twenty years ago. As a matter of fact, they were
uncle and nephew. Lance being the son of Ravenspur's favorite sister, who had
died some years before. For the rest, he was a barrister eagerly waiting his
chance of success, and, in the meantime, occupied himself in the capacity of
Ravenspur's private secretary. He seemed to have heard all that had taken
place. He was warm in his sympathy as he piloted Sir James Seton to his own
room. They were going down again almost before the dinner gong had ceased to
sound, and by this time a knot of dinner guests were discussing ordinary topics
again.</p>
<p>To the casual observer there was no sign of trouble or tragedy here.
Everything was perfect in its way. The oval table glittered with silver and old
Bohemian glass. The banks of flowers might have been arranged by the master
hand of an artist. Ravenspur sat there gaily enough now, his conversation
gleaming with wit and humour, the most perfect host in London. There was no
sign whatever of his earlier agitation. And yet, strive as he would, from time
to time the name of Louis Delahay crept into the conversation. It was in vain
that Lord Ravenspur attempted to turn the stream of thought into other
channels. He was glad enough at length when the dinner came to an end, and the
party of guests broke up into little groups. The host approached Seton
presently with a request to know whether he would care to play bridge or
not.</p>
<p>"No bridge," Sir James said emphatically. "I am tired of the tyranny of it.
I wonder that you should make such a suggestion, Ravenspur, seeing how you
detest the commonplace. But, at any rate, I will have another of those
excellent cigarettes. of yours."</p>
<p>"It shall be just as you please, my friends," Ravenspur said wearily. "Now
let us go and have a coffee in the studio. It is much cooler there, and there
is more space to breathe."</p>
<p>The suggestion was received with general approval, and a move -was
immediately made in the direction of the studio. The apartment lay at the end
of a long corridor, which cut it off from the rest of the house, the studio
being in reality a huge garden room, which Ravenspur had built for reasons of
privacy. He took a latchkey from his pocket and opened the door.</p>
<p>"I always keep this place locked," he explained. "Some years ago my three
Academy <i>piet&agrave;s</i> were stolen just as they were finished, and since
then I have taken no risk. The annoying part of the whole thing was that one of
the missing pictures was the best thing I ever did. What became of it is a
mystery."</p>
<p>"I remember the picture perfectly well," one of the guests remarked. "It was
the study of a woman. Do you recollect my coming in one night and you asked me
my opinion of it?"</p>
<p>"I think I can remember it," Ravenspur said. "Well, it was a superb piece of
work," the first speaker went on; "'anything more fascinating than the woman's
face I don't recollect seeing. I don't know who your model was, Ravenspur, but
you had a rare find in her."</p>
<p>"I had no model," Ravenspur explained. "The face was more or less an ideal
one&mdash;composite, if you like, but resembling nobody in particular. However,
the thing was a great loss to me, and I have never ceased to regret it. That is
why I always keep this place locked up; even when the room is cleaned out, I am
always present to see that nothing is disturbed. It is a whim of mine."</p>
<p>As he spoke Ravenspur switched on the electric lights, until the whole of
the beautiful apartment glowed to the illumination of the shaded lamps. The
studio itself was circular in shape, and finished in a great dome of stained
glass. The floor was littered with rare old Persian carpets, and lounges from
all parts of the world were dotted about here and there. Round the walls was an
almost unique collection of armour. From the centre of the floor rose a fine
acacia tree, the vivid green foliage of which seemed to suffer nothing from
being cut off from the outer light and air. Altogether the place was quite
unique in its way, and striking evidence of Ravenspur's originality and good
taste. On little tables here and there were hundreds of photographs, most of
them signed, testifying to the great popularity which Ravenspur enjoyed amongst
all classes of society.</p>
<p>"You will have to leave these to the Nation," a guest laughed. "What a
cosmopolitan gallery it is&mdash;a prince on the one side, and a prominent
socialist on the other! Yet, after all, photographs are very commonplace
things. You might look over a thousand before your fancy is taken by a face
like this."</p>
<p>As he spoke the guest took up a portrait from one of the tables, and held it
out at arm's length, so that the light fell upon the features. Unlike the rest,
the photograph was not framed, and, judging from the edges, it had had a
certain amount of rough usage in its time. As to the picture itself, it
presented the features of a young and beautiful girl, with a great cloud of
hair hanging over her shoulders. There was something almost tragic in the dark
eyes; they seemed to tell a story all their own.</p>
<p>"A beautiful face," the guest went on. "The sort of face that a poet would
weave an epic around. I don't want to be impertinent, Ravenspur, but I should
like to know who she is."</p>
<p>"Where did you get that from?" Ravenspur asked. His voice sounded hard and
cold, so that the man with the photograph in his hand turned in some
surprise.</p>
<p>"Where did you find it?"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, I took it up off this table, as you might have done. Of
course, it is no business of mine, and I am sorry if any careless words I have
spoken&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The apology is mine," Ravenspur put in quickly. "I was annoyed, just for
the moment, to think that that portrait should have been left about. I could
have sworn that I had locked it carefully away in a safe. You are perfectly
right, my dear Seymour, there is a tragedy behind that charming face. But you
will quite understand that I cannot discuss the matter with anybody."</p>
<p>"Oh, quite," the offending guest said hastily. "Still, it is a most lovely
face. Now who does it remind me of?"</p>
<p>"The likeness is plain enough," Seton put in. "Why, it is the very image of
our host's young ward. Miss Vera Rayne. Is there any relationship between them,
Ravenspur?"</p>
<p>"Why, so it is!" Walter Lance cried. "Who can she be, uncle?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur had crossed the studio in the direction of a safe let into the
wall. He placed his hand in one of the little pigeon holes there, as if seeking
for something. Apparently he was unsuccessful in his search, for he shook his
head doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Not there," Ravenspur said to himself. "Most extraordinary lapse of memory
on my part. Of course, I must have taken that photograph from the safe when I
was looking for something else, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker broke off abruptly. He slammed the door of the safe, behind him,
and returned to his guests. But the light had gone out of his eyes; he seemed
to have suddenly aged.</p>
<p>"Let us have some coffee," he said. "Is it true, Marrion, that there is
likely to be a serious split in the cabinet?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V - VERA RAYNE</a></h2>
<p>THE conversation became more general now, so that it was possible a moment
later for Ravenspur to slip out of the studio without his absence being
observed. He went swiftly away to the library, where he hastily dashed off a
note, which he handed over to a servant to be delivered immediately. He seemed
to be somewhat easier in his mind now, for the smile had come back to his lips.
The smile became deeper, and a shade more tender, as a young girl came into the
room. She had evidently just returned from some social function, for she was in
evening dress, with a light silken cloud thrown over her fair hair. Save for
the brilliancy of her eyes, and the happy smile upon her lips, she bore a
strong resemblance to the mysterious photograph, which had so disturbed
Ravenspur a little time before. She crossed the room gaily, and kissed
Ravenspur lightly on the cheek.</p>
<p>"So your friends have all gone?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No; they are still in the studio. But, tell me, have you had a very
enjoyable evening? And how is it that you are back so soon?"</p>
<p>A faint splash of colour crept into the girl's cheeks. She seemed to be just
a little embarrassed by the apparently simple question.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said. "One gets tired of going out every night. And
it was rather dull. I daresay all this sounds very ungrateful when you give me
everything I could desire. But I am longing to get into the country again. It
seems almost a crime for people to shut themselves up in dusty London, when the
country is looking at its very best. Do you know, I was far happier when I was
down in Hampshire."</p>
<p>"Well, we can't have everything our own way," Ravenspur smiled. "Still, we
shall see what will happen later on. And now, I really must go back again to my
guests."</p>
<p>Vera Rayne threw herself carelessly down into a chair. A little sigh escaped
her lips. She ought to have been happy enough. She had all the blessings that
good health and great wealth could procure. And yet there were crumpled rose
leaves on her couch of down. The thoughtful look on her face deepened. She sat
there so deeply immersed in her own reflections, that she was quite oblivious
to the fact that she was no longer alone. Walter Lance had come into the room.
He addressed the girl twice before he obtained any response. Then she looked
up, and a wistful, tender smile lighted up her beautiful face.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," she said. "Do you know, Walter, I have been thinking a
good deal lately. I suppose I am naturally more discontented than most girls,
but I am getting very tired of this sort of life. Pleasure is so
monotonous."</p>
<p>"Ungrateful," Walter laughed. He came and stood close to the speaker's side
so that he could see down into the depths of her eyes, which were now turned
fully upon his. "There are thousands of girls who envy your fortunate lot."</p>
<p>"I don't know why they should. You see, it is all very well for me to go on
like this. It is all very well to be a fascinating mystery. The time has come
when I ought to know things. For instance, I should like to know who I really
am."</p>
<p>"What does it matter?" Lance asked. "What does it matter so long as
I&mdash;so long as we all care for you. My dear girl, you pain me. And when you
speak in that cold, not to say arbitrary way, as if&mdash;as if&mdash;really.
Vera! It isn't that I want you to be more worldly than you are&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But then you see, I am not worldly, Walter. And I really should like to
know who I am, and where I came from. It is all very well to tell people that I
am the daughter of an old friend of Lord Ravenspur, and that he adopted me when
my father died. That is sufficient for our friends and acquaintances, and seems
to satisfy them, but it does not satisfy me. When I ask Lord Ravenspur about my
parents he puts me off with one excuse or another, and if I insist he becomes
quite stern and angry. He is so good to me that I don't like to bother him. And
yet I can't go on like this."</p>
<p>Walter Lance looked somewhat uneasily at the speaker.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My dear Walter, I mean exactly what I say," Vera said sadly. "I am tired of
this constant round of pleasure. Really, it seems to me that the lives of the
rich are quite as monotonous as those of the poor. We go our weary round of
dinner and dance and reception, varied by an occasional theatre or concert. We
see the same faces, and take part in the same vapid conversation Oh, Walter,
how much nicer it would be to get one's own living!"</p>
<p>"How would you get yours?" Lance laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate, I could try. And that is what I am going to do, Walter.
I have fully made up my mind not to stay here any longer. Don't think that I am
ungrateful, or that I do not recognise Lord Ravenspur's great kindness to me.
But you see I have no claim upon him, and if anything happened to him to-morrow
what would my position be? I know he has a large income from his property, but
that will go to his successor some day. Oh, I know you will think that this is
very hard and cold of me, but there are reasons, many and urgent reasons, why
it is impossible&mdash;"</p>
<p>Vera broke off abruptly, and Walter could see that the tears had gathered in
her eyes. There was something in those eyes, too, that caused his heart to beat
a trifle faster, and brought him still closer to her side.</p>
<p>"Won't you tell me what it is?" he whispered. "We have always been such good
friends, Vera. Forgive me asking you, but isn't this decision on your part
rather a sudden one?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am quite prepared to admit that," the girl said candidly, "and I wish
I could explain. But you would not understand&mdash;was there ever a man yet
who really understood a woman? The thing that you call impulse... I know that
Lord Ravenspur had his own ideas as to my future, the same as he has in regard
to yours."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed," Walter said drily; "that is news to me. And in' what way is my
uncle interested in my welfare?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say he hasn't told you? He has mentioned it to me at least a
score of times. You are going to marry Lady Clara Vavasour. That much is
settled."</p>
<p>"Really, now, that is very kind of my uncle. But, unfortunately, I have
views of my own on the subject. Lady Clara is a very nice girl, and I
understand that she is rich, but she does not appeal to me in the least. My
dear Vera, surely you are mistaken. Surely my uncle must have guessed, he could
not be so blind as not to see &mdash;Vera, dearest, cannot you understand what
I mean? Do you suppose that I could possibly have known you all this time
without&mdash;without You know, I am certain that you know."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no," Vera cried; "you must not speak like that. I cannot listen to
you. I know that Lord Ravenspur has set his heart upon this marriage, and it
would be the basest ingratitude on my part if I&mdash;but what am I talking
about?"</p>
<p>The girl broke off in some confusion. The faint pink on her cheeks turned to
a deeper crimson. Her eyes were cast down; she did not seem to realise that
Walter had her hands in his, that he had drawn her close to his aide.</p>
<p>"I must speak," he said huskily. "Even at the risk of your thinking me the
most conceited man on earth, I must tell you what is uppermost in my mind now.
My dear girl, I have known you ever since you were a little child. From the
very first we have been the best of friends. I have watched you change from a
girl to a woman. -I have watched your mind expanding, and gradually I have come
to know that you are the one girl in the world for me. I have not spoken like
this before, because there seemed to be no need to do so. Everything was so
natural, there did not appear to be any other end to a love like mine. But if I
have been wrong, and if you tell me that you care nothing for me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I couldn't," Vera whispered. "Oh, Walter, if you only knew&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then you do care for me, my dearest. Yes, I can see it in your face, there
is always the truth in your eyes. And now I can speak more freely. You were
going away from here out of loyalty to my uncle, and because you deem it your
duty to sacrifice your feelings rather than interfere with his plans. But, my
dear girl, don't you see what a needless sacrifice it would be? Don't you see
that any such action on your part would be worse than useless? But I will speak
to you about this to-morrow. I am quite sure he is not the man to stand between
us and our happiness. Would that I had thought of this before. I am sure that
it would have saved you many an anxious moment."</p>
<p>Vera shook her head sadly. Walter's arms were about her now, her head rested
on his shoulder. Just for the moment they were absolutely oblivious to the
world. They heard nothing of the sound of voices as Lord Ravenspur's guests
drifted away; they were unconscious that he was standing in the doorway, now
regarding them with stern disapproval. He hesitated just a moment, then he
strode into the room. Walter had never seen his face so hard and cold
before.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to intrude," he said, "but there is something I have to say to
you, Walter. It is getting late now. Vera, and quite time that you were in
bed."</p>
<p>The girl looked up with something like rebellion in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I am going into the drawing-room for half an hour," she said. "Perhaps
Walter will come and say good-night to me when you have finished your
conversation. I think you understand what I mean. And don't be too hard on me.
If you only knew how I have tried to do what&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>
<p>The tears rose to Vera's eyes, as she turned slowly and sadly away.</p>
<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI - A VOICE IN THE DARK</a></h2>
<p>VERA turned away and walked quietly from the room, leaving the two men face
to face. Lord Ravenspur was the first to speak.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for this," he said; "more sorry than I can tell you. Strange how
one should be so wilfully blind. Strange how frequently even the cleverest man
will overlook the inevitable. But I suppose I thought that you two had come to
regard one another as brother and sister. Oh, I am not disputing your taste.
There is not a more beautiful and fascinating girl in London than Vera. It is
only natural that you should fall in love with her. But she knows the views I
have for you. She knows to what an extent she is indebted to me. That being so
it is her plain duty&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear uncle," Walter "broke in eagerly, "if there is anybody to blame, it
is I. Vera knows her duty plainly enough, and she would have acted upon it but
for me. When I came in here to-night I was struck by the unhappiness of her
face, and, naturally, I began to ask questions. It seems an egotistical thing
to say, but Vera is as deeply attached to me as I am to her, and that was the
source of her trouble. She had made up her mind to go away. She had made up her
mind to get her own living. And why? Simply because she knew that you had other
views for me, and that she stood in the way of your plans. It was only by a
mere accident that the whole thing came out. But I have spoken the words now
that are beyond recall, even if I wished to recall them, which I do not. There
will never be another woman in the world for me."</p>
<p>"But the thing is impossible," Lord Ravenspur broke out harshly. "It is
absolutely out of the question. I had other views for you, but I certainly
should not have pressed them against your wishes. But all that is as nothing
compared to this&mdash;this tragedy. I blame myself bitterly for my want of
foresight. My conduct has been almost criminal. But, be that as it may, there
must be no engagement between Vera and yourself. Don't press me to tell you
why, because my lips are sealed, and I dare not speak. But, as you value your
future, I implore you to carry this thing no further. I know this sounds an
outrageous request, but I am speaking from the bottom of my heart. It is the
fashion of the world to regard me as one of the most fortunate and enviable of
men. I tell you, with all the force at my command, that I would cheerfully
change places with the humblest labourer on my estate. I have never dropped the
mask before, and I probably never shall again. I am only doing it now so that
you may be warned in time. Go back to Vera, and tell her what I say. Tell her
that there are urgent reasons why a marriage between you is utterly out of the
question. And if you will persist in having your own way, then let me ask you
one final favour. Let the engagement be kept a secret. And now I have no more
to say. Perhaps I have said too much as it is, only if you were aware what the
last twenty-four hours has brought forth&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ravenspur broke off abruptly as if fearful of saying too much. His whole
attitude had changed; his features quivered with an almost uncontrollable
emotion. Then he turned on his heel, and strode down the corridor in the
direction of the studio. Walter could hear the latch of the door click as it
closed behind him...</p>
<p>Ravenspur was alone with his own troubled thoughts. For a long time he paced
up and down the room, then he took up the photograph which had excited so much
attention amongst his guests earlier in the evening. He laid it down on a
little table, and gazed at the face there long and sadly.</p>
<p>"Amazing!" Ravenspur muttered to himself . "Absolutely inexplicable! I could
have sworn that I had the photograph still under lock and key. When did I take
it from the safe, and why." Beyond all question, it was not on the table
yesterday. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it a menace and warning of the old
trouble which has never ceased to be with me night and day the last twenty
years? And how the whole thing works together! First of all, poor Delahay is
found murdered in his studio, and now something like the same thing happens to
one of my guests who was unquestionably mistaken for me in the darkness. And as
if that was not enough, those two young fools must take it into their heads to
fancy that they are in love with one another. Heaven only knows how I shall
make my way out of this terrible coil, even if I have the good luck to escape
the consequences of my folly! The most fortunate man in London! The most
popular and most sought for! What a bitter travesty upon the truth it is! If
they only knew! If there were only some power to lift the roof off of every
house in London, what tragedies would be revealed! And how many friends would
be left to me?"</p>
<p>Time was going on. A dozen clocks in different parts of the house struck
twelve. As Ravenspur stood by the table, his moody eyes still bent upon the
photographs, there was a sudden click and snap, and the whole place was plunged
in darkness. The thing was so quick, and unexpected that something like a cry
of alarm broke from Ravenspur's lips. It all came to him in a flash that the
tragedy of Fitzjohn Square was going to be repeated with himself in the role of
the victim. This is just what had happened the previous evening, only there had
been nothing to try his nerves then as they were being strained to breaking
point now. Shaking and agitated in every limb he made his way across to where
the switches were, but there was nothing wrong with them. He could heat no
commotion in the house, such as would naturally follow the extinguishing of the
light. Indeed, underneath the doorway he could see by the slit of light that
the electrics in the corridor were still working.</p>
<p>The full horror of it was almost more than he could bear. A wild desire for
light and companionship came upon him. His unsteady hand fumbled at the latch,
which seemed in some way to have gone wrong, for the door refused to open.
Ravenspur was breathing thickly and heavily. But he was sufficiently in
possession of his faculties to realise that he was no longer alone in the room.
He could distinctly hear someone breathing close to him. Then he caught the
sound of a low chuckle.</p>
<p>"Not so fast," a voice hissed in his ear; "I haven't come all this way for
the benefit of your society to lose you like this. You needn't worry about the
door, because you can't escape in that way."</p>
<p>In a sudden frenzy of rage and anger and fear, Ravenspur stretched out his
arm and encountered that of the mysterious stranger, whose dramatic entrance
had so startled him. But, strong man as he was, and in the pink of good
condition, Ravenspur could make nothing of his assailant. The man appeared to
be not more than half his size, but his arms and body were tough and elastic as
the finest whipcord. Gradually Ravenspur was borne backward. He dropped on his
knees with a grip about his throat that caused him to gasp for breath, and
brought a million stars dancing before his eyes. He wanted help more earnestly
than he had ever required it in his life before, but his pride was stubborn
still, and he tried to choke down the cry which rose to his lips. He must fight
for himself to the end.</p>
<p>"So that is to be the end of it?" Vera asked. "It breaks my heart to speak
like this, but after what Lord Ravenspur has said, there must be an end to the
matter."</p>
<p>"But, my dearest girl, the thing is absurd," Walter cried. "What have we
done that we should be treated in this way? Surely our position is dear enough.
We are to be parted for the sake of some ridiculous whim which is not even
capable of an explanation. I am not going to leave matters here. I decline to
obey until I know the reason why. At any rate, nothing can prevent our loving
each other. And, as far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to keep the
matter secret between us. But I intend to have the matter out with my uncle
before I sleep to-night. I am not a boy to be treated in this sentimental
fashion. So long as I know that your feelings remain unchanged&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What is that?" Vera cried. "Didn't you hear anything&mdash;a kind of
horrible, muffled scream? There it is again!"</p>
<p>The sound came again and again, ringing through the silent house, horrible
and insistent in its note of tragedy. Vera turned a pale, scared face to her
companion.</p>
<p>"Where is it?" she gasped. "Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>"The studio," Walter exclaimed. "It is my uncle's voice. Something terrible
has happened to him."</p>
<p>Without another word Walter dashed from the room, and flew along the
corridor leading to the studio. Just for a moment there was a strained, tense
silence; then, as the door of the studio was reached, a strange, muffled scream
burst out again. With his hand on the lock Walter shook the door, which refused
to give way to him. He called aloud on Ravenspur, but no reply came. He shook
the door in a fit of angry exasperation, and once more from inside the room
came that queer, choking noise, followed by a low chuckle. It was maddening,
exasperating to a degree, to stand so close to the threshold of tragedy and yet
to be so far away.</p>
<p>There was only one thing for it, and that was to break down the door.
Flinging himself full against the woodwork, Walter literally forced his way in.
Then he stood just for a moment looking into the gloom and darkness, trying to
see where the figure of the unhappy man lay.</p>
<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII - THE YELLOW HAND-BILL</a></h2>
<p>THE suggestion of tragedy brooding in the darkness held Lance back just for
the moment. He was almost afraid to proceed lest he should find something even
worse than he had expected. Then his hand fumbled along the wall with the
switches, and the great room burst into a glow of light again.</p>
<p>The place was absolutely empty, save for the figure of Lord Ravenspur
huddled up upon the Persian rug. He was absolutely still and silent. As far as
Lance could see he had ceased to breathe.</p>
<p>Naturally enough the young man looked about him for a sign of the miscreant,
but the studio contained no trace of his presence. The thing was puzzling to
the last degree. There was no exit from the room beyond the door which Walter
had broken down, and nobody could possibly have passed him that way. Besides,
the switches were just inside the door, and the light had been turned on almost
immediately. At any rate, there was nobody there now except the victim of the
attack himself, and Walter feared that he was already past any explanation of
the strange affair.</p>
<p>That would have to keep for the present. Walter bent over and raised Lord
Ravenspur's head and shoulders. He was still alive, for his eyes were wide
open, though no words came from his lips. At the same time he seemed to be
struggling for speech which would not come. Then he raised a shaking arm and
contrived to pull Walter's head down close to his lips. The words came at
length in a faint whisper, a whisper so low, that Walter had the greatest
difficulty in following it.</p>
<p>"Don't let anybody know. It is absolutely necessary that no one should
know," Lord Ravenspur faltered. "If there is any alarm, I pray you go and allay
it at once. Say that I had fallen asleep and was suffering from nightmare. Say
I had a horrible dream. Say anything, so long as you respect my secret. Now
go."</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to obey this mysterious request. At the end of
the corridor Vera was waiting with an anxious face. It was no nice thing to
prevaricate, it would have to be done. Walter spoke as lightly as possible.</p>
<p>"There is no occasion for alarm," he said. "Lord Ravenspur says that he fell
asleep and had a horrible nightmare. At any rate, he seems to be all right now.
You had better go to bed. I am sorty that you should have been so much
alarmed."</p>
<p>To Walter's great relief. Vera asked no further questions. She turned away
obediently enough, and he hurried back to the studio. Lord Ravenspur still lay
on the Persian rug, but with Walter's help he contrived to get into a chair. A
little brandy brought some trace of colour to his face. He seemed more like
himself again.</p>
<p>"They heard nothing in the house?" he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Only Vera," Walter explained. "She was terribly frightened, but she
believed what I told her, and she has gone up to her room. And now, perhaps,
you will tell me the truth."</p>
<p>"Do you think I have not already done so?"</p>
<p>"My dear uncle, I am sure of it. I know it is possible for people to make
the most hideous noises when they are suffering from nightmare, but this is
quite another matter. You called aloud for help. You were in imminent danger of
losing your life. Before I broke the door down I distinctly heard somebody give
a low chuckle. Of course, you can make light of this in the morning. You can
induce people to laugh at your absurd situation, but you cannot deceive me. I
know there was someone in the room when I forced the door."</p>
<p>"Then where is he now, Walter?" Lord Ravenspur asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, that I cannot tell; but he was here right enough."</p>
<p>"He passed you in the corridor?"</p>
<p>"That he most certainly did not. Nobody came out that way."</p>
<p>A faint smile came to Lord Ravenspur's lips. He indicated the room with a
wave of his hand.</p>
<p>"I see exactly what you mean," Walter said. "Of course, if you do not feel
inclined to tell me the truth I cannot compel you to do so. But I have only to
look at you, to see that you have lately been through a desperate struggle with
someone who came here to take your life. You are absolutely exhausted with the
severity of it. If I had my own way I would put the matter in the hands of the
police."</p>
<p>"No, no," Ravenspur said vehemently. "If you have the slightest regard for
me you will not venture to say a word to a soul. I want the whole thing to be
forgotten. If I remain in my room all to-morrow under the plea of
indisposition, I shall be all right the next day. You are to give me your word
of honour that you will say nothing of what you have seen to-night."</p>
<p>"If you wish it so, certainly," Walter said reluctantly.</p>
<p>"My dear uncle, won't you trust me? I would do anything to help you. And
besides, how are you going to guard against this happening again?</p>
<p>"A bloodthirsty ruffian who can enter a house and vanish in this mysterious
fashion, is not likely to be put off, if he knows you are going to take no
steps to guard yourself against a further attack. But what has become of
him?"</p>
<p>I haven't the slightest idea," Ravenspur said wearily. "I was sitting in my
chair when the light suddenly went out and I heard the door locked. Then I had
to fight for my life, and was nearly done for when I called out for
assistance."</p>
<p>"And you saw nothing of him?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing whatever," Ravenspur went on. "I could only feel him. And after
that I recollect no more till you came."</p>
<p>"A most extraordinary thing," Walter said, somewhat impatiently. "Surely you
have some idea as to who the man is. Surely he must be the same man who mistook
Sir James Seton for yourself to-night."</p>
<p>No reply came from Lord Ravenspur. Evidently he desired to say no more. He
seemed anxious to be alone. But Walter, angry and hurt, walked rapidly about
the room seeking for a way whereby the late visitor had vanished. But he looked
in vain. There was no possible means of exit other than the door, and the
fireplace was too narrow to admit of anybody coming or going. As to the roof,
it was of heavy stained glass, and as impregnable as the walls themselves. The
mystery was maddening. And yet the one man who could have explained it all sat
there silent, and moody, and tongue tied.</p>
<p>"Is there anything more that I can do for you before I go to bed?" Walter
asked. "Are you sure I can't help you?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid not, my boy," Ravenspur said in a dull, mechanical way. "I know
that you won't chatter about this thing. And, perhaps, a little later on, I
shall be able to speak more plainly. I shall be glad if you will help me up the
stairs and get me into bed. I have had a great shock to-night."</p>
<p>It seemed almost cruel to pursue the subject further, and Walter refrained
from questions as he noticed the ghastly whiteness of his uncle's face. The
latter was disposed of at length, and then Walter came downstairs again. He now
had the house practically to himself. All desire for sleep had forsaken him.
Besides that, it was no nice thought to reflect on the possibility of that
ruffian being still on the premises. Walter had not the slightest doubt in his
mind that the man had left the studio in some secret manner, and that he had
come there through no ordinary channel. What was to prevent him returning again
when the house was asleep and finishing his work? In itself, the fact of Lord
Ravenspur possessing a bitter enemy was remarkable. And Lord Ravenspur's
obstinate silence was more remarkable still. Walter had given his word to say
nothing of these strange events, but that did not bind him from making
inquiries on his own account.</p>
<p>He returned to the studio once more and made a thoroughly searching
examination of the place. Was there some secret door which Lord Ravenspur used,
and of which nobody knew anything? It had never occurred to Walter till that
moment that his uncle might have turned-down pages in his life, but that
conclusion was inevitable now. Still, though Walter spent the best part of an
hour in his search, he had nothing to show for his pains. He was about to give
up the thing in despair when a piece of yellow paper, lying by the side of the
Persian rug where Lord Ravenspur had fallen, attracted his attention. It was a
small, shabby sheet of paper, folded in four and printed from worn-out type, in
fact, just the class of bill which is circulated amongst travelling circuses
and shows of that kind. It was the last thing in the world that anyone would
have looked for in the studio of so fastidious a man as Lord Ravenspur. Slowly
and thoughtfully Walter unfolded and read the hand-bill. It was an
advertisement of the nightly programme of the Imperial Palace Theatre. The name
of the place sounded imposing enough, but the locality of Vauxhall Bridge Road
somewhat detracted from the importance of it. So far as Walter could judge, the
Imperial Palace Theatre was no more than a shady music hall giving two shows a
night, and most of the names on the bill were absolutely unknown to fame. The
star turn appeared to be one Valdo, who was announced as the flying man who had
made such a sensation throughout the leading halls in Europe.</p>
<p>"I wonder if this is a clue," Walter murmured to himself. "At any rate, I
should like to see this Valdo. I'll go down to the Imperial Palace to-morrow
night and enquire for myself."</p>
<p>Walter folded up the shabby bill and placed it in his pocket, after which he
went thoughtfully to bed.</p>
<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII - THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</a></h2>
<p>NOBODY in the Park Lane house appeared to have the slightest suspicion that
anything had been wrong. The stolid, well-trained servants accepted the
explanation of the broken door quite as a matter of course. And when Vera had
come down in the morning she appeared to have forgotten the incident entirely.
Lord Ravenspur was not feeling particularly well, and he had decided to keep to
his room for the day. The explanation was perfectly simple and quite natural.
All the same, Walter was thankful that Vera should ask him no questions. It was
no easy matter to preserve a cheerful and unconcerned face at the breakfast
table, but he seemed to manage it all right. He was just a little quiet and
subdued, but then there was nothing remarkable about that, especially in view
of Lord Ravenspur's feelings on the subject of his engagement to Vera.</p>
<p>The day dragged on, and Walter waited with what patience he had till the
evening. He was not displeased to find that Vera was dining out with some
friends in Sloane Square, for this would give him the opportunity he needed. He
changed his dinner jacket presently for an old tweed coat and cap. Then he set
out on his errand in Vauxhall Bridge Road. Walter was not alone on this
occasion, for he was accompanied by a journalist friend whose particular study
was the life and habits of the lower classes. It was this friend who had
suggested the advisability of the humble garb, so that they could thus mix
freely with the people around them. Walter congratulated himself upon his
friend's prudence when he saw the class of audience that filled the Imperial
Palace Theatre.</p>
<p>The place was large enough, and by no means lacked artistic finish. At one
time it had been an actual theatre, run by some enthusiast with a view to the
elevation of the masses and the production of high-class plays at popular
prices. - The experiment had ended in a ghastly failure, and now a shrewd,
hard-headed publican in the neighbourhood was making a fortune by the simple
expedient of giving his patrons exactly what they required.</p>
<p>"What part of the house shall we try?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"We can't do better than the pit," Venables replied. "That will cost you
sixpence, or perhaps, if you like to be extravagant, we can have a box for
half-a-crown. Still, we don't want to make ourselves conspicuous. The pit is
quite good enough for me. You can smoke here, you know, and drink too, for the
matter of that. But I should not advise to try the latter experiment."</p>
<p>The house was fairly well filled as the two friends entered and took their
seats. The audience for the most part were respectable enough, but the whole
place reeked with perspiring humanity, and the air was pungent with the smell
of acrid tobacco. A constant fusilade of chaff went on between the stage and
the audience. Indeed, the <i>artistes</i>, for the most part, appeared to be on
the most friendly terms with the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the theatre. A
dreary-looking comedian was singing one of the inevitable patter songs, full of
the feeble allusions to drink without which songs of that kind never appear to
be complete. The audience listened stolidly enough.</p>
<p>"Are they never going to tire of this kind of thing?" Walter asked his
companion. "Is there nothing humorous in the world outside the region of too
much beer? These people sadden me."</p>
<p>"Oh, they are all right," Venables said, cheerfully. "They are quite happy
in their own particular way. I have long ceased to look for anything fresh on
the music hall stage. An original artist and an original manner wouldn't be
tolerated."</p>
<p>The dreary song came to an end at length; then it was followed by two
so-called sisters, who, in short skirts and large picture hats, discoursed on
the joys of country life in a peculiarly aggressive Cockney accent. The whole
thing was dull and depressing to the last degree, and Walter began to regret
his loss of time. He noticed from his programme that Valdo was down rather
late, so there was nothing for it but to possess his soul in patience till the
time came. It was a little past ten o'clock before the stage was cleared, and
the attendants, in their grimy uniforms, began to erect a series of fine wires
running from the roof to the floor. Then there was an extra flourish from the
aggressive orchestra, and a slim man, dressed entirely in black, came on to the
stage. He was received with great enthusiasm and the smiting of glasses upon
the tables. Evidently Valdo had established himself as a firm favourite with
the patrons of the Imperial Palace Theatre.</p>
<p>All Walter's apathy had vanished, as he turned to the stage and scrutinised
the acrobat long and carefully. So far as he could judge, Valdo was no
Englishman with a foreign name, but a genuine foreigner, presumably of Italian
birth. The man was not tall or particularly broad, but he was well
proportioned, and gave the idea of one possessed of considerable physical
strength. In particular, Walter noticed how long his arms were, and how the
muscles stood out between his shoulders. As to the rest, the man looked mild
enough, and his dark Southern face was wreathed in an amiable smile.</p>
<p>He proceeded, with the aid of an attendant, to fasten two small curved
canvas frames to his shoulders. These he thrashed up and down with his arms
much as a cock flaps its wings before crowing. Then, with an agile leap from
the stage, the man proceeded to sail up slowly from the floor to the flies.</p>
<p>"That's clever," Venables exclaimed. "It looks to me as if our friend has
solved the art of the flying machine. But one never knows. I daresay it is no
more than some ingenious trick."</p>
<p>This speech appeared to be resented by a respectable-looking mechanic who
was occupying the next seat to Venables.</p>
<p>Nothing of the kind," the man said indignantly. I've been here three nights
now, and I know something about mechanics, too. If you think that wires are
used you are just mistaken. A friend of mine is stage carpenter here, and he
told me all about it. Depend upon it, that chap has got the knack right
enough."</p>
<p>The performer fluttered down again from the wings as lightly and easily as
he had risen, and a tremendous outbreak of applause followed. When the din had
died away, the stage manager came forward and invited any of the audience who
chose to come up and see for themselves that everything was fair and
legitimate, and that no mechanism had been employed. The intelligent mechanic
turned to Venables with a defiant smile.</p>
<p>"Now is your chance, guv'nor," he exclaimed. "You go and smell it out for
yourself."</p>
<p>Venables would have declined the offer, but already Walter had risen eagerly
from his seat. The opportunity was too good to be missed. Though he did not
associate this man Valdo with the mysterious attack on Lord Ravenspur's life,
he felt quite convinced that the artist was indirectly concerned in it. To
waste a chance would be the height of folly. A moment or two later the two
friends were on the stage. They stood there whilst the performer went through
another series of graceful performances, but they could see absolutely nothing
which suggested mechanical contrivance of any kind. The whole act came to an
end at length, and Valdo stood there bowing and smiling when his wings were
removed.</p>
<p>"Let's have a chat with him," Venables whispered. "Apart from the thing
being decidedly interesting, there ought to be some good 'copy' here. Properly
worked, Signor Valdo ought to be worth a couple of columns to me."</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the "Press," the stage manager pricked up his ears. He
was not insensible to the value of a good advertisement. He suggested a move to
his private office, where it would be possible for the visitors to interview
quietly.</p>
<p>"Nothing I should like better," Walter said eagerly. "Perhaps you will come
with us, and join us in a bottle of champagne?"</p>
<p>They made their way behind the stage to a dingy little room, insufficiently
lighted with one gas jet. The back of the stage was in a turmoil. It was almost
impossible to hear for the din. Then very briefly and modestly Valdo told his
bistory. He had found out his peculiar powers by a series of experiments with
the parachute. The whole secret lay, he explained, in the enormously powerful
muscles between his shoulders and the backs of his arms. The rest was worked by
the amazing rapidity with which he had learnt to move his arms. So far the
thing was effective enough, but the strain was so great that, hitherto, he had
found it impossible to rise to a height of more than forty feet. This naturally
prevented him from obtaining engagements in the larger theatres and halls where
so limited a flight would have been far less imposing than it appeared to be
when performed in a place like the Imperial Palace. There was nothing more to
be said, and the two friends were turning away when a woman put her head into
the door, and looked inquiringly at Valdo. He muttered something to the effect
that he would be ready in a moment or two, and the woman vanished.</p>
<p>Walter caught his lip in his teeth. It was hard work to conceal his
surprise. There was no doubt whatever about It, no question as to the identity
of the Intruder. Strange as It appeared to be, Walter recognised the features
of Mrs. Delahay. There was no mistaking that white, stern face. It was only for
a moment, but that moment had been enough for Lance.</p>
<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX - THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT</a></h2>
<p>ALL that evening and most of the next day Walter brooded over his startling
discovery. He said nothing to anybody about it, though he had attempted the
night previously to follow up the clue. The attempt had failed, however, for
though Walter had waited outside the theatre, he saw no more of Mrs. Delahay.
And as to the man Valdo he eventually went off by himself. There was nothing
for it now but to wait and see what was going to happen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public interest in the Fitzjohn Square tragedy had not abated in
the least Everybody was waiting eagerly enough for the inquest, which was to
open at four o'clock on the day following the mysterious attack upon Lord
Ravenspur. The latter had come down somewhat late in the morning, looking but
little the worse for his adventure. It was not expected that the inquest would
be more than formally opened, and it was generally known that Lord Ravenspur
would be an important witness.</p>
<p>In view of the extraordinary interest taken in the affair the proceedings
had been moved to a public hall. Long before the time arranged for opening the
inquiry the hall was packed to its utmost capacity. After the police and
medical evidence had been taken, the first witness called was Lord Ravenspur.
HIs fine, picturesque figure stood out in the strong light. He gave his
evidence clearly and well, though his voice shook from time to time with
emotion, which was only natural enough, seeing that the dead man had been so
close a friend of his.</p>
<p>After all, he had little to tell. He described his late visit to Fitzjohn
Square, and how he had been at work on a picture there until such time as the
lights were extinguished and he was forced to abandon his task.</p>
<p>"You thought nothing of the lights going out?" the coroner asked. "You saw
nothing suspicious in that?"</p>
<p>"Well, no," the witness replied. "You see, it is no unusual occurrence for
the supply of electric light to fail. The thing so easily happens. As the house
has been empty for some time it occurred to me that perhaps there was a fault
somewhere, or, perhaps, the workmen had not quite finished their job."</p>
<p>"Quite so," the coroner observed. "Tell us, did you hear any noise in the
house, or any suspicious sounds?"</p>
<p>"Nothing whatever. Until the light went out there was nothing whatever to
disturb me. In fact, I was so intent upon my work that I was quite lost to
everything else."</p>
<p>"But you know now," the coroner went on, "that the main cable leading to the
meter was cut. That being so, somebody must have been in the house at the same
time as yourself. What I want to get at is this&mdash;the murderer was
deliberately waiting for his victim. He had no quarrel with you, and his great
idea was to get you out of the way. That appears to be obvious."</p>
<p>"It is obvious enough to me," Ravenspur replied. "I came to that conclusion
directly Inspector Dallas pointed out to me that the main cable had been
deliberately cut. But you see I suspected nothing wrong at the time, and there
was nothing else for me to do but to abandon my task directly the light went
out. I am afraid that I can tell you nothing more."</p>
<p>"The deceased was a great friend of yours?" the coroner asked. "I presume
you know a great deal about his life and habits. Was he at all the sort of man
to make enemies?"</p>
<p>"The last man in the world," the witness said emphatically. "My friend was
both upright and straightforward. Indeed, I regarded him as a man incapable of
a mean action."</p>
<p>One or two desultory questions followed, and then Lord Ravenspur sat down.
To a certain extent his evidence had been dramatic enough, but, at the same
time, he had not said a single word likely to throw any light on the mystery.
The audience thrilled and bent forward eagerly as Mrs. Delahay stood up to give
her evidence. She was just as deadly pale, just as calm and set, as she had
been when she called upon Ravenspur in Park Lane with the dreadful news. She
gave her evidence slowly and distinctly, speaking more like an automaton than a
creature of flesh and blood. She told how she had become alarmed at her
husband's prolonged absence, how she had gone down to Fitzjohn Square' to see
if anything had happened, how she found the dead body there, and how the police
had come to her assistance. But more than that she could not say, more than
that she did not know. So far as she knew her husband had always been a
cheerful man. She had never heard him say an evil word of any one. She had not
been married long, in fact she was still a bride. Altogether she had known her
husband for a little over three years. She was older than her husband, she
proceeded to say. The coroner asked her age.</p>
<p>"I am forty-three," she said calmly.</p>
<p>"Really," the coroner murmured politely, "I should not have taken you to be
so much. I don't wish to ask you anything likely to cause you pain, but does it
not occur to you that your husband might have been concealing something? Is it
not rather strange that he should leave you at midnight and take an hour and a
half in reaching a house to which he might have walked in ten minutes?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Mrs. Delahay said. "My husband was one of the most open
of men. In fact, he was too fond of leaving his letters and private papers
about. And as to the rest, he might have met a friend. He might have gone to
one of his dubs."</p>
<p>"If I may be allowed to interrupt a moment," Inspector Dallas said, "I may
say that we have utterly failed to trace Mr. Delahay's movements from the time
he left the Grand Hotel till he reached Fitzjohn Square. Not one of his friends
appears to have seen him on the night in question."</p>
<p>"That is rather unfortunate," the coroner murmured."I am sorry to have
troubled you so far. You may sit down now."</p>
<p>With something which might have been a sigh of relief Mrs. Delahay resumed
her seat close to the table. Then Inspector Dallas put forward a witness who
gave the name of John Stevens. He looked like a broken-down professional man in
his greasy, shabby frockcoat and dingy linen. His watery eye glanced nervously
over the court. The red tinge on his cheeks spoke quite plainly of the cause of
his downfall. He proceeded to give his evidence so incoherently that the
coroner had to reprimand him sharply once or twice.</p>
<p>I can't hear half you say," that official said irritably. I think you said
your name was John Stevens. What can you tell us about this case? Did you know
Mr. Delahay?"</p>
<p>"I knew him quite well, sir," the witness said. "I have seen him scores of
times when I have been watching in Fitzjohn Square."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by watching there?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, you see, I am a private inquiry agent. I work for one of the
large firms of detectives, getting up evidence and that kind of thing. For
months past it has been my duty to keep my eye on a certain house in the
Square, especially at night. In that way I have got to know most of the
inhabitants by sight, and also I have got.to know a good deal about their
habits."</p>
<p>"You are a professional spy, then?" the coroner asked.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, if you like to put it like that," the witness said humbly. "On
the night of the murder about a quarter past one, I was in the Square gardens
watching through the railings at the corner of John Street. I could see
perfectly well what was going on because there is a large electric arc light
where John Street and the Square adjoin. As I said, it was just about a quarter
past one, because I looked at my watch to see what the time was. It was nearly
time for me to leave, as my instructions&mdash;"</p>
<p>The witness broke off abruptly, and glanced about the room with the air of a
man who has recognised an acquaintance whom he had not expected to see. His
rambling attentions were recalled by the coroner in a few sharp words.</p>
<p>"I am sure I beg your pardon. As I said, I was waiting there till my time
was up, and I saw Mr. Delahay come round the corner. He stood there just a
moment. As far as I could gather he seemed to be troubled about something. I
was too far off to hear what he was saying, but it seemed to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" the coroner interrupted. "Do you mean to say
that Mr. Delahay was talking to himself?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear no, sir; he was talking to his companion."</p>
<p>"Companion! That is the first we have heard of that. Was the companion a man
or a woman, might I ask?"</p>
<p>"It was a lady, sir. She was a tall woman dressed in black. They stood
opposite me for five or six minutes talking very earnestly together. Then Mr.
Delahay turned away from the woman and went into the house. The woman seemed to
hesitate a few moments, then she followed, and I saw her go into the house
after Mr. Delahay. But she will be able to tell you all about it herself."</p>
<p>"I don't understand you," the coroner said, with a puzzled frown. "How can
the woman tell us all about it herself? You don't mean to say that she is in
court?"</p>
<p>The witness slowly turned and pointed a dingy forefinger in the direction of
Maria Delahay.</p>
<p>"That's the lady, sir," he said. "That's the lady that I saw with Mr.
Delahay the night before last."</p>
<p>"But that is absolutely impossible," the coroner cried. "Don't you know that
that lady is Mr. Delahay's wife?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X - ROPES OF SAND</a></h2>
<p>SOMETHING like a thrill of real excitement ran through the spectators. The
remark was made so quietly and in such a natural tone, that nobody dreamt of
questioning the word of the witness. Then it went home to all that Stevens was
making against Mrs. Delahay what amounted to a serious accusation. All eyes
were turned upon her. She glanced in the direction of the witness in the same,
dull, steady way which had characterised her from the first.</p>
<p>"This is very remarkable," the coroner murmured. "Do you quite understand
what you are saying?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course, sir," Stevens went on, as if absolutely unconscious that
his words were creating a sensation. "That is the lady whom I saw with Mr.
Delahay that night. I daresay she will tell you herself when she comes to give
evidence."</p>
<p>"One moment, please," the coroner went on. "How long is it since you
identified the lady opposite?"</p>
<p>The witness looked about him as if he hardly understood the question. He was
clearly puzzled by what had happened.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact," he said, "I did not see her till the last few
moments. You see, sir, I took her for a witness like myself. I cannot say any
more than that."</p>
<p>The coroner murmured something to the effect that there must be a mistake
here. Then he turned to the witness again.</p>
<p>This is a most important investigation," he said, and I want you to be very
careful. Will you look at the lady again and see if you have not made a
mistake? Surely you were in court when she gave her evidence. You must have
seen her then."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I didn't, sir," the witness protested. "I did not come into court
until my name was called outside."</p>
<p>The coroner turned sharply to Mrs. Delahay and asked her to be good enough
to stand up. She rose slowly and deliberately, and turned her head in the
direction of Stevens. A ray of light fell upon her features; they were
absolutely dull and expressionless, as if all the life had gone out of her; as
if she failed utterly to comprehend what was going on around her. It was only
natural that she should have dissented vigorously from Stevens' statement. She
regarded him without even the suggestion of a challenge in her eyes. As a
matter of fact, the man was making a serious charge against her&mdash; a charge
of wilful perjury at the very least, and yet, so far as she was concerned,
Stevens did not even appear to exist.</p>
<p>Well, what do you make of it?" the coroner asked. Just as I told you
before," the witness went on. "I saw that lady with Mr. Delahay at a quarter
past one on the morning of the murder. I saw her enter the house in Fitzjohn
Square."</p>
<p>"Extraordinary!" the coroner exclaimed. "Mrs. Delahay has already sworn to
the fact that she retired to bed at twelve o'clock, and that she did not miss
her husband till late the next morning; and now you say that you saw her with
the murdered man. In the face of Mrs. Delahay's evidence, are you prepared to
repeat your first statement?"</p>
<p>A stubborn look came over Stevens' face. His watery eyes became more clear
and steadfast.</p>
<p>"I have no object in telling a lie, sir," he said. "I came forward in what I
considered to be the interests of justice, and at some loss to myself. I am
prepared to stand up in any Court of Justice, and take my oath that Mrs.
Delahay was with her husband at the time and place I have mentioned."</p>
<p>The audience swayed again, for there was something exceedingly impressive in
the speaker's words. All eyes were turned upon Mrs. Delahay, who seemed at
length to gain some understanding of what was going on. There was no sign of
guilt or confusion on her face. It was as calm and stony as ever.</p>
<p>"The speaker is absolutely mistaken," she said. "He must have confused me
with somebody else. From twelve o'clock at night till seven the next morning I
was not out of my room."</p>
<p>"On the face of what has happened, we cannot possibly go any further," the
coroner said. "After all it will be an easy matter to test the correctness of
both witnesses. It is just possible that Stevens has made a mistake."</p>
<p>Stevens shook his head doggedly. He felt quite certain that there was no
mistake so far as he was concerned. Then there was a little awkward pause,
followed by a whispered consultation between the coroner and Inspector
Dallas.</p>
<p>"The enquiry is adjourned for a week," the coroner announced. "There is
nothing to be gained by any further investigation till the extraordinary point
which has arisen has been settled."</p>
<p>The disappointed audience filed out until only a few of the authorities from
Scotland Yard remained. As Mrs. Delahay walked slowly towards the door.
Inspector Dallas followed her.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me, I am sure," he said, "but I should like to come back to
your hotel with you and make a few inquiries. You see, it is absolutely
necessary to disprove John Stevens' statements. Until we have done that, we
can't carry our investigations any further. I hope you will be able to help us
in this matter."</p>
<p>"How can I help you?" the woman asked in the same dull, level voice. "I tell
you that man was mistaken. I am still so dazed and stunned by my loss that I am
quite incapable of following things clearly. Something seems to have gone wrong
with my brain. But I will try and help you. It is very strange that that man
should have made such an extraordinary mistake."</p>
<p>"Very strange indeed," Dallas murmured. "Will you permit me to call you a
cab? Now tell me, have you any relations? For instance, have you a sister who
is very like you? In one of the most important investigations I ever undertook,
I was utterly baffled for months owing to the fact of there being two twin
brothers mixed up in the case. If you have a sister&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So far as I know I have not a single female relative in the world," Mrs.
Delahay responded. "And as to the rest, you will find that my statement is
absolutely true. I suppose you will believe the servants at the hotel?"</p>
<p>The hotel was reached at length, and Mrs. Delahay excused herself on the
ground that she was tired and utterly worn out. So far as Dallas was concerned
he had no desire to detain her. As a matter of fact, he wanted to pursue his
inquiries alone, and on the production of his card the resources of the
establishment were placed at his disposal. Nothing seemed to escape his eye. No
detail appeared to be too trivial. He received his reward at length through the
lips of one of the chamber-maids who had something to say. As was only natural,
there was not a servant on the premises who had not heard all about the
Fitzjohn Square tragedy, or who was not deeply interested in Mrs. Delahay.</p>
<p>"It is your duty to look after the rooms on the same floor as Mrs. Delahay's
bedroom?" he asked. "What time did you retire on the night of the murder?"</p>
<p>"Not before two o'clock," the chambermaid replied. "We were unusually late
that night as the house was full."</p>
<p>"Quite so. I suppose when Mr. and Mrs. Delahay came in from the theatre they
got the key of their bedroom from the office in the ordinary way? I suppose
they had a dressing room and a bedroom?"</p>
<p>The chambermaid admitted that such was the fact. When asked if she knew what
time Mrs. Delahay had retired for the night, she shook her head. She "could not
be quite sure."</p>
<p>"You see, it was like this," she said. "I was rather interested in Mr. and
Mrs. Delahay&mdash;they were such a distinguished looking couple. I was in the
corridor when Mr. Delahay went out about twelve o'clock, and half an hour later
I went up to Mrs. Delahay's bedroom to see if I could do anything for her. The
key was in the door, which struck me as rather strange, because, as you know,
in large hotels like this, it is the customary thing for people to lock their
rooms. I knocked at the door and no reply came, so I went in. The bed and
dressing room were both empty, and thinking, perhaps, that Mrs. Delahay had
gone out as well as her husband, I turned the key in the door and took it down
to the office."</p>
<p>A thoughtful expression came over Inspector Dallas' face.</p>
<p>"That was quite the proper thing to do," he said. "I suppose you don't know
what time the key was fetched again from the office?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that I cannot tell you. You see, I went to bed about two o'clock and I
was up again at seven. When I took Mrs. Delahay up her cup of early tea she was
in bed then."</p>
<p>"Really! Did you notice anything strange about her?"</p>
<p>"There was nothing to notice. She appeared to be very bright and cheerful,
and chatted to me in the friendliest possible way. She did say something to the
effect that she was a little uneasy about her husband, who had not yet
returned, and that she must go and look for him. But beyond that I saw nothing
that was in the least out of the common."</p>
<p>"I think that will do," Dallas observed. "I won't detain you any longer. I
know how busy you are."</p>
<p>Dallas went straight away downstairs and interviewed the clerk in the
office. The latter's memory was a little vague on the subject of the coming and
going of the various hotel guests. There were hundreds of them in the course of
a week, and it was the habit of most of them to leave the key of their rooms in
the office every time they went out. The speaker had no recollection of Mrs.
Delahay calling for her key very late on the night of the tragedy. He debated
the point thoughtfully for a moment, then his face lighted up.</p>
<p>"I think I can help you," he exclaimed.</p>
<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI - THE EXPRESS LETTER</a></h2>
<p>"TAKE your time," Dallas said, encouragingly. "I don't want to hurry you.
All I want are facts."</p>
<p>"It is beginning to come to me now," the clerk said thoughtfully. "Yes, I
remember it quite distinctly. You see. Madam Leona Farre, the great French
actress, is staying in the house, and she did not come in till just two
o'clock. After I had given her her key Mrs. Delahay came up and asked who the
lady was. She wanted her key, too, which she told me was missing from the door
of her room."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed," Dallas said softly. "She had just come in, I suppose? Had she
taken off her things?"</p>
<p>"No," the clerk said. "She had just come in from the street. I had to
explain to her how it was that the key had found its way back into the office
again."</p>
<p>"She did not appear to be annoyed at that?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least. Indeed, she seemed to be rather amused at her own
carelessness. No, I saw nothing suspicious in her manner. I think that is all I
can tell you."</p>
<p>"Possibly," Dallas said. "But there is one other little matter in which you
may be of assistance. I suppose you can recollect the night that Mr. Delahay
left the hotel. Did he happen to ask for letters or anything of that kind? It
would be quite the usual thing to do. Of course, it is a small
point&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There were no post letters," the clerk interrupted. "But just as Mr.
Delahay was going out a messenger boy brought an express letter for him, which
he read hastily, and then asked the hall porter to call him a cab. No, I can't
say that the message disturbed him at all, but it seemed to hurry him up a bit
just as a telegram might have done. That was the last I saw of him."</p>
<p>On the whole Inspector Dallas was not disposed to be dissatisfied with his
morning's work. He had discovered some important facts, and, at any rate, it
had impressed the detective with the truth of John Stevens' evidence. As to the
rest, it would not be a difficult matter to find out the name and number of the
messenger boy who had brought the unfortunate Delahay that letter. There was
nothing for it now but to take a cab and go off in the direction of the
district office whence the messenger boy had come. As Dallas walked briskly
down the steps of the hotel he met Lord Ravenspur coming up.</p>
<p>"I am just going to see Mrs. Delahay," the latter said. "By the way,
Inspector, that was remarkable evidence which the witness Stevens volunteered
this morning. But, of course, he was mistaken. It is absolutely impossible that
Mrs. Delahay could have been with her husband at the time he stated."</p>
<p>"Well, I am not so sure of that, my lord," Dallas replied. "Really, I don't
know what to make of it. At any rate, I have discovered an absolute fact: that
for two hours, between twelve and two, Mrs. Delahay was not in the hotel. I
have it on the independent testimony of two witnesses who corroborate one
another down to the minutest detail. I don't know what to make of it."</p>
<p>All the healthy colour left Ravenspur's face.</p>
<p>"This is amazing," he said. "Yet I cannot believe that Mrs. Delahay has been
deliberately deceiving us. I will go up and see what she has to say for
herself. I suppose I am at liberty to tell her what you have just said to
me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know why not," Dallas said after a thoughtful pause. "You see, she
is bound to know sooner or later. And I hope you will make her see the
advisability of accounting for her movements. Nothing can be gained by trying
to deceive us, to say nothing of the wrong impression which Mrs. Delahay is
creating in the minds of other people. Really, if you come to think of it, she
is standing in an exceedingly perilous position, my lord."</p>
<p>Ravenspur was not destined to make any impression upon the widow of his
unfortunate friend, for she refused to see him. One of the servants came down
with a message to the effect that Mrs. Delahay could not see anybody. Even a
letter hastily scribbled by Ravenspur failed to induce her to change her mind.
With something like despair in his heart Ravenspur went off in the direction of
his own house. For the rest of the afternoon he sat in the library, a prey to
his own gloomy thoughts. Visitors came and went, but the same message was given
to all of them&mdash;Lord Ravenspur was far from well. He could not see anybody
this afternoon. It was nearly seven o'clock before Walter Lance came into the
library.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to disturb you," he said, "but I have something serious to say
to you. I have been reading to-day's evidence in the Delahay case, and I was so
interested in the matter that I went to Scotland Yard and had a chat with
Inspector Dallas. It seems to me that Mrs. Delahay has placed herself in a very
compromising position."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" Ravenspur demanded.</p>
<p>"Surely, my dear uncle, the thing is plain enough. Whatever your opinion of
Mrs. Delahay may be you cannot get away from the fact that she was deliberately
lying when she gave her evidence this morning. She swore that on the night of
the murder she wasn't out of her bedroom after twelve o'clock, and we know now
that she was away from the hotel for over two hours. You know it, too, because
Dallas told you. You will forgive my plain speaking, sir, but I think you could
throw some light on this painful tragedy. Believe me, I should not dare to say
so much if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are presumptuous," Ravenspur said angrily. "Do you dare to insinuate
that a man in my position&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not insinuating anything," Walter urged. "But I have a feeling we are
in some way connected with this tragedy. I have a strange instinct that there
is some close connection between the death of Mr. Delahay and that mysterious
murderous attack upon you in your studio. Oh, I know that commonsense is all
against my theory, but I am going to tell you something which will astonish
you. After I saw you to bed the other night I searched the studio for some way
whereby an assailant could have entered the room&mdash;I mean some secret door
known only to yourself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can disabuse your mind of that idea," Ravenspur said, with the ghost of
a smile. "I give you my word that there is nothing of the sort. But go on with
your story."</p>
<p>"Well, I couldn't find any means of entrance and exit except by the door,
and then it occurred to me that I might possibly light upon a clue. Finally I
found this lying on the floor, and I should like you to read it. You may find
it interesting."</p>
<p>With these words Walter took from his pocket the dingy yellow handbill, and
laid it open on the table so that Ravenspur might read. The latter glanced at
the printed words, and then turned to Walter with a questioning eye.</p>
<p>"What does it all mean?" he asked. "It conveys nothing whatever to me, and,
even if it did, I am the last man in the world to patronise entertainments of
that kind."</p>
<p>"You never heard of Valdo before, then?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"Not I, my dear boy. Who is the fellow?"</p>
<p>"He is a kind of flying man. He is an individual with extraordinarily
developed arm and muscles. He can move those arms almost as quickly as a fly
does in its flight; with the aid of specially prepared wings he can flutter
about a stage like a bird. I daresay there is some secret behind it all, but
still the performance is very graceful and attractive, though, as yet, the man
tells me his flight is limited to some thirty feet."</p>
<p>"He tells you!" Ravenspur exclaimed. "Do you mean to say that you have
actually paid a visit to this theatre?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I have, sir. You see, I regarded this bill as a kind of clue. I
knew that you could not possibly have brought it into the house, nor were any
of your friends likely to do so. Therefore I came to the not illogical
conclusion the other night that your assailant must have dropped it. The man
who got into the studio must have been an extraordinary climber or something
exceedingly clever in the way of an acrobat. In fact, just the sort of fellow
who would be connected with music halls and circuses and places of that kind.
That is why I went down to the Imperial Palace Theatre together with a
journalist friend of mine who takes an interest in such matters. The only item
of the entertainment worth watching was this man Valdo, and, of course, up to a
certain point I did not identify him with the outrage upon yourself."</p>
<p>"Why should you do so now?" Ravenspur asked. "I told you that I have never
seen or heard of the man, nor does he answer to any acquaintance of mine. Why,
then, should you go out of your way to suggest that he had even been here?"</p>
<p>"I am coming to that," Walter said quietly. "I was so interested in the
performance that I went round to Valdo's dressing-room afterwards, and had a
long chat with him. Just before I came away a woman looked into the room, and
asked the performer if he was ready, or something of that kind. She did not
notice me; indeed, she did not even look in my direction. It was only just for
a moment that I caught a glimpse of her face. It was only by a great effort
that I concealed my feelings. And when I tell you that the woman I am speaking
about was Mrs. Delahay&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Impossible!" Ravenspur cried in great agitation. "The thing is absolutely
incredible. I cannot believe it."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, I am stating nothing but the truth," Walter said. "As sure as
I am standing here I saw Mrs. Delahay. And now you know why I am sure that
there is something more behind this than has yet come to light."</p>
<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII - A SPEAKING LIKENESS</a></h2>
<p>IT was some little time before Lord Ravenspur replied. For a moment or two
he seemed to be bereft of the gift of speech.</p>
<p>"It sounds almost incredible," he managed to stammer at length. "You are
absolutely certain you are not mistaken?"</p>
<p>"No, I am not mistaken. Mrs. Delahay's face is far too striking a one to be
taken for that of anybody else. Of course, I am not asking you to give me any
information. I am not seeking to pry into your secrets; but this mystery
maddens me. The most extraordinary part of the whole aflFair is this&mdash;for
three years on and oflF I have known Mrs. Delahay intimately. I saw a great
deal of her in Florence, also in Paris last year. And she has always given me
the impression of being absolutely straightforward and single minded. And now,
for some reason or another, she has taken it into her head to tell deliberate
lies which appear to have no point or meaning. If she had only said that she
went to call upon a friend after her husband had gone out, no further question
would have been asked. Of course, I had not forgotten the evidence of the man
Stevens. I must confess I should like to see him and ask him a few pointed
questions.</p>
<p>But apart from all that, you must see the necessity of getting Mrs. Delahay
to tell the truth. It is just possible that she is shielding somebody. It is
just possible that the whole thing is capable of explanation. But of that you
are the best judge."</p>
<p>"It is a miserable business altogether," Ravenspur groaned. "I am obliged to
you for the straightforward way in which you have told me everything, and I
will do my best with Maria Delahay. She refused to see me this morning, but I
will go round after dinner and make another attempt to get an interview."</p>
<p>It was somewhat later in the evening that Walter looked up his friend
Venables again. As he expected, he found the joumalist to be greatly interested
in the Delahay case. Walter had debated the matter over in his mind. He could
see no harm in telling Venables what he had discovered.</p>
<p>"It is certainly a curious case," the latter remarked. "And professional
interests apart, I should like to get to the bottom of this mystery. But I see
you have some suggestion to make in connection with it. What is your idea?"</p>
<p>"Well, I have been thinking it out as I came along," Walter explained; "and
it seems to me that we might get a good deal out of the witness John Stevens.
He is the sort of man who would do anything for money, and a sovereign or two
ought to loosen his tongue. I don't want to say anything unkind about Louis
Delahay, because he was a great friend of ours; and, so far as I know, his past
is a dean and honourable one. But then you never can tell. What b a man like
that doing to make an enemy, who is prepared to run the risk of being hanged
for killing him? And why does he want to go round to his studio at such an hour
in the morning?"</p>
<p>"I thought of all that," Venables said grimly. "Depend upon it, your
unfortunate friend had some secret chapters in his life of which the world will
probably never know anything. But what has all this got to do with that fellow
Stevens?"</p>
<p>"I was just coming to that point. If I had been the coroner I should have
asked Stevens a great many more questions this morning. As it was, the
authorities seemed content to let him go after he had given evidence to the
effect that he had seen Mrs. Delahay with her husband. He told the court that
he had been prowling and spying about Fitzjohn Square for some months, and he
gave a pretty plain hint to the effect that he could tell a story or two about
some of the inhabitants there. Now, for six months or naore before Delahay went
to Florence to be married, he lived a bachelor life at this house; and all this
time Stevens was prowling about the neighbourhood after dark. It is not a very
pleasant thing to have to do, but I should like to talk the matter over with
Stevens and see if he can give us! any information as regards Delahay. If you
will telephone to Scotland Yard and get them to give you Stevens' address, we
will go round to his rooms and interview him at once."</p>
<p>It was no difficult matter to get the address in question, and presently the
two friends reached the shabby house in the dingy street where Stevens lived.
An exceedingly dirty child informed the visitors that Mr. Stevens was out at
present, but that he always left his whereabouts behind him in case he might be
required professionally. At the present moment, the precocious child informed
the strangers, Mr. Stevens could be found at the Imperial Palace Theatre in
Vauxhall Bridge Road. That is a bit of a coincidence," Venables remarked.
However, we can't do better than go down to the theatre."</p>
<p>There was some little trouble in finding Stevens, and the performance was
nearly at an end before he was pointed out to Walter by one of the attendants.
He appeared to be none too sober, judging by his flushed face and somewhat
unsteady gait; though, since the morning, his wardrobe had undergone a decided
change for the better. The greasy, seedy frock-coat had vanished. Also the
dilapitated silk hat. In fact the man looked quite prosperous.</p>
<p>"I would suggest that we don't speak to him in here," Venables said. "Let us
follow him out into the road."</p>
<p>Walter fell in at once with the idea. In the road Stevens paused as if
waiting for somebody, and presently from the stage door there appeared the
slim, graceful figure of Valdo. For some moments the two men stood in earnest
conversation together, and from their attitude it was plainly evident that they
were in hot dispute upon some point. The discussion lasted some little time.
Then with a shrug of his shoulders, Valdo put his hand in his pocket and passed
a coin or two over to his companion. Stevens was understood to say something to
the effect that that would suffice for the present. Then he lounged off down
the road and paused presently before a public-house which glittered invitingly
opposite.</p>
<p>"Catch him before he goes in there," Venables whispered hurriedly. "If the
fellow has any more to drink he will be perfectly useless to us for the rest of
the evening.</p>
<p>Stevens turned suspiciously as Walter spoke to him.</p>
<p>"I think your name is Stevens," the latter said. "My friend here is a
journalist and is greatly interested in the Fitzjohn Square mystery. We have
been reading your evidence of this morning, and have come to the conclusion
that you may be able to afford us some useful information. If you will answer a
few questions we will make it worth your while."</p>
<p>"To the extent of a couple of sovereigns," Venables put in.</p>
<p>"Then I am your man," Stevens exclaimed with alacrity. "Perhaps you wouldn't
mind coming round as far as my rooms. I have got a pretty poor memory for
things, so I always jot everything down in my diary. I put everything down
pretty well, because you never know what information is likely to be useful. I
once made fifty pounds out of the simple fact that I saw a footman reading some
postcards he was posting. Since then I have neglected no trifles."</p>
<p>"What we want," Walter explained, "is all you can tell us about Mr. Louis
Delahay. You know him very well by sight, and you must be acquainted with some
of his habits."</p>
<p>Stevens laughed knowingly, and nodded his head.</p>
<p>"I could open your eyes about a few of them in that neighbourhood," he said.
"I haven't been loafing about Fitzjohn Square all these months for nothing. If
I were a blackmailer, which I am not, I could live on the fat of tbe land. That
is too dangerous a game to play, and I piefer to get along as I am." .</p>
<p>The man was evidently in a condition when he was past concealing anything.
He chattered away glibly until his rooms were reached. Then with a flourish he
opened the door and invited his visitors to enter. He apcdogised for the fact
that he had nothing whereon to entertain the strangers, which apology was duly
accepted. It was, perhaps, on the whole, a fortunate thing that Stevens' cellar
was empty. He ushered his companions into a grimy room, stuffy from want of
air, and reeking with the odour of stale tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me for a moment," he said politely. "I will go into my
bedroom and get my diary. I suppose pretty well all you want to know has
happened quite lately."</p>
<p>"It is the last six months with which we are chiefly concerned," Walter
explained. "Before that does not matter."</p>
<p>Stevens turned away and closed the door behind him. He was gone some little
time, so that his visitors had ample opportunity to take stock of their
surroundings. There was nothing in the place of any value except a small
circular picture in a handsome frame, depicting a beautiful face, which was
evidently the work of some artist of repute. The painting was so glaringly out
of place that it immediately attracted Venables' attention.</p>
<p>"How did that get here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My word, you may well ask that," Walter cried in surprise. "Here is another
amazing discovery! You remember my uncle being robbed of some pictures a few
years ago, one of which he dedared was the best thing he had ever done?"</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say," Venables exclaimed, "that, that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I do," Walter said mider his breath. "I declare to you that the
painting hanging up there is the one which my uncle always considered his
masterpiece."</p>
<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">XIII - A STRIKING LIKENESS</a></h2>
<p>VENABLES regarded the painting with deep interest. AH his journalistic
instincts were now aroused. It appeared to him that he was on the eve of
tapping a perfect gold mine of sensational "copy."</p>
<p>"Now are you quite sure you are not making a mistake?" he asked. "You have
not been misled by some chance likeness, because this is rather an important
matter for me. My people expect smartness, but they have a rooted objection to
mistakes."</p>
<p>"I tell you there is no mistake here," Walter Lance, said definitely. "I am
prepared to swear that that portrait was painted by my uncle. Of course, you
remember the sensation there was at the time when the pictures were stolen.
They vanished from the studio in the most mysterious fashion. Two of them were
of comparative unimportance, but yonder work my uncle reckons to be the best
thing he has ever done. And I quite agree with him."</p>
<p>"A portrait, I suppose?" Venables asked.</p>
<p>"Well, my uncle always denies it. He says the face is more or less a fancy
one. And while he is prepared to admit that it is coloured by recollection, he
says it is not intended for anybody in particular. But I can see a likeness
there."</p>
<p>"Of course you can, and a very strong one, too," Venables exclaimed. "Do you
mean to tell me that your uncle cannot see that that picture is Miss Vera
Rayne?"</p>
<p>"That is the point I have put to him more than once. He says he can't see it
at all. And there are others who share the same opinion. On the other hand,
there are certain friends of ours who take the same view of it as I do
myself."</p>
<p>"And they are right," Venables said vigorously. "My word, we appear to be
only on the fringe of this mystery! It occurs to me that the thief who stole
that picture did not steal it for the mere sake of gain, but merely because it
is what it is. No doubt the other two works were merely stolen as a blind. I
don't wish to appear curious, my dear fellow, but what relation is Miss Rayne
to Lord Ravenspur or yourself?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that I can't tell you," Walter replied. "Strange as it may seem, my
uncle has always refused to say anything about Miss Rayne's antecedents. All I
know is that she is well bred, exceedingly beautiful, and perfect in every
way."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," Venables said hastily. "But here is Stevens back again. It
wouldn't be a bad plan to ask him point blank where that picture comes
from."</p>
<p>Walter nodded his approval as Stevens came back into the room with a
notebook in his hand. He started uneasily as Venables literally fired the
question at him. But there was no time for the man to prevaricate.</p>
<p>"It doesn't belong to me," he said. "As a matter of fact, it is the property
of a man who used to lodge with me some time ago."</p>
<p>"Well, it is a very fine piece of work," Venables said, in a matter-of-fact
voice. "I suppose your friend is a poor man; otherwise he would not live in a
place like this. Do you think he would like to sell the picture?"</p>
<p>Stevens replied, with obvious confusion, that he could not say. His friend
was not an Englishman, and where he was to be found at that moment Stevens
could not say. Hiere appeared to be nothing more for it but to change the
subject. Then, as he stood looking at the painted face, a sudden inspiration
come to Walter. He wondered why he had not thought of it before. His mind went
swiftly back to the moment in the studio when Lord Ravenspur had appeared so
disturbed over the unexpected finding of the photograph by one of his guests.
Here was the photo idealised. Could there be any connection between the thief
of the picture and Lord Ravenspur's midnight guest?</p>
<p>Perhaps I can stimulate your memory," he said. Isn't your friend an Italian?
Hasn't he got something to do with the variety stage? Come, you can answer my
question; surely it is an easy one. Isn't your friend in London at the present
moment?"</p>
<p>Stevens stammered and hesitated. There was something like fear in his eyes
as be glanced furtively at the questioner. Lance felt quite sure that he was on
the right track now.</p>
<p>"Now, look here," he said. "We have come on important busiiiess, and if you
refuse to help us, we may find some other way of inducing you to tell the
truth. On the other hand, there need be no unpleasantness, and there is no
reason why you shouldn't put a five-pound note in your pocket. Now isn't that
picture the property of a man named Valdo who is at piesent under engagement at
the Imperial Palace Theatre? Now, yes or no.</p>
<p>"I don't know how you found it out," Stevens said, wriggling about
uncomfortably. "But it is true enough. Valdo was living with me about three
years ago. He came back one night with the picture in his possession."</p>
<p>"Not in a frame, I suppose?" Lance asked.</p>
<p>"He brought it rolled up. The frame was put upon it a day or two later by
Silva himself."</p>
<p>"Silva!" Venables exclaimed. "I thought his name was Valdo."</p>
<p>"That is his stage name," Stevens explained. "You see, Silva had not come to
England very long. He was very poor then, and I understood that he was looking
for some Englishman, who had promised him employment whenever he crossed the
Channel."</p>
<p>"Was the Englishman ever found?" Lance asked.</p>
<p>"That I can't tell you," Stevens went on. "Silva is very close about his own
affairs, and I believe that he belonged to some secret society. He told me the
picture had been painted for him by a clever compatriot of his, who was trying
to make a name for himself. Of course, it was nothing to me, and I asked no
questions about it. When Silva went away to fulfil an engagement up in the
North, he asked me to take care of the portrait, and it has been hanging on the
wall opposite ever since. I hope there is nothing wrong about it."</p>
<p>"Indeed there is," Lance said significantly. "Now, if you would like to help
us, we will make it worth your while. If you don't, why, it is more than
possible that you may find yourself in an awkward position. I don't mind
telling you that that portrait was painted by Lord Ravenspur, and that it was
stolen one night from his studio some three years ago."</p>
<p>Stevens gave a sudden start.</p>
<p>"I recollect it," he cried; "I recollect it perfectly. I remember that there
was a great outcry at the time, and that a large reward was offered for the
recovery of the pictures. Lord, if I had only known. And to think that all this
time&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That reward would have been yours," Venables smiled grimly. "You would not
have allowed your friendship for this man Silva&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Friendship!" Stevens said contemptuously. "What is friendship where money
is concerned? And, after all, Silva was no real pal of mine. Precious little
use he was to me."</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll find us useful enough if you play your cards correctly,"
Venables said. "We happen to know that you are on good terms with this man
Valdo, or Silva, whatever you call him. In fact, we know that he gave you money
tb-night. You are quite astute enough to see how much better it will pay you to
be on our side. Therefore, you will see the advantage of saying nothing to this
Italian about our visit here to-night. Here is a five-pound note to go on with,
and if I want you again, as is exceedingly probable, I will write to you and
tell you where to meet me. I don't think we need detain you any more at
present."</p>
<p>"Then you don't want to know anything about Fitzjohn Square?" Stevens asked.
"I can tell you a thing or two."</p>
<p>"I think that will keep for the piesent," said Lance."Good-night, and
remember that silence is your policy."</p>
<p>Stevens grinned and nodded as he tucked the five-pound note into his
waistcoat pocket. His recent visitors went off together in the direction of
Venables' rooms.</p>
<p>"That was a brillant inspiration of yours," the latter said, presently.
"Now, what on earth put it into your head to ask if that man Valdo had any
connection with the stolen pictures? To my mind, your question was ahnost an
mspiration."</p>
<p>"Well, hardly that," Lance proceeded to explain. "But, first of all, let me
tell you the events which led up to our discovery to-night. I think you ought
to know. I am quite sure that the secret is safe in your hands. Now listen,
carefully."</p>
<p>Venables listened carefully enough to Walter's extraordinary story of the
strange photograph, and of the mysterious attack on Lord Ravenspur in his
studio, and the subsequent discovery of the yellow hand-bill. In the light of
these disclosures everything was perfectly plain to a mind so astute as that of
Venables. He shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>"This looks like a vendetta," he said. "You may depend upon it that Miss
Vera Rayne is the unconscious cause of all the mischief. Of course, I am
treading on delicate ground now, but I suppose it is just possible that Miss
Rajme may be Lord Ravenspur's daughter. We know that Ravenspur used to spend a
great part of his time in Corsica, and everybody is itware of the fact that
love-making out theie is a dangerous business. It looks very much to me as if
this man Valdo was working out a plan of revenge, either on his own behalf, or
on behalf of some noble family, hailing from that picturesque corner of Europe.
My theory is further strengthened by the mysterious way in which these things
have come about. See how anxious your uncle is to keep everything out of the
hands of the police. I feel quite sure now that the death of Louis Delahay is
all part of the same drama. It wouldn't be a bad plan to mention Luigi Silva's
name to your uncle, and ask him if he has ever heard of the man before."</p>
<p>"That is a good idea," Walter exclaimed. "I'll ask my uncle the question
before I go to bed to-night."</p>
<h2><a id="chap14" name="chap14">XIV - RETROSPECTION</a></h2>
<p>MOST of the lights in the houses in Park Lane were out when Walter reached
his uncle's residence. But as he entered the hall he could see that the studio
was still ablaze. Hie door was closed, but a thin shaft of light penetrated
from beneath. As Walter tried the door he found to his surprise that it was
locked. With some feeling of apprehension he called to his uncle, and a moment
later Ravenspur turned the key. His face was pale. There was in his eyes a look
which spoke of some vague fear.</p>
<p>"I hope I am not disturbing you," Walter said.</p>
<p>"My dear boy, I am only too pleased to have a companion," Ravenspur said
eagerly. "Upon my word, my nerves are so much shaken by these terrible
happenings that I am almost afraid to be alone. Sit down and have a
cigarette."</p>
<p>Walter took a cigarette from the silver box on a little table, nor did he
fail to note the presence of a stand of spirits, which was a thing in which his
imcle rarely, or never, indulged.</p>
<p>"I really needed a stimulant to-night," Ravenspur said, half apologetically.
"Where have you been all the evening?"</p>
<p>"I have been out making discoveries," Walter said as he threw himself down
into a comfortable armchair, "and one of my discoveries has been really
remarkable. To be perfectly candid, Venables and myself have been doing a
little private detective business together. Venables was by no means satisfied
that that fellow Stevens had told all he knew at the inquest on poor Delahay,
so we hunted Mr. Stevens up, and finally ran him to earth in his dingy
lodgings."</p>
<p>"And did he give you any valuable information?" Ravenspur asked eagerly.
"Was it worth your while?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, it was, as you will see for yourself, sir. As soon as ever we got
into the room I was struck by a picture there. One does not usually find great
works of art in bed-sitting rooms at five shillings a week. And when you see a
picture like that, worth a couple of thousand pounds at least, it naturally
arouses your curiosity. And when, on the top of that, the picture is perfectly
familiar to you, why, my dear uncle&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean you had seen the picture before? Where?"</p>
<p>"In this very studio; you painted it here, sir. It is one of the three
pictures which were stolen from you some time ago. Oh, you need not shake your
head, uncle. I assure you that I have not made the slightest mistake. I leave
you to guess which of the three pictures it was that I saw in that dreary
bed-sitting room."</p>
<p>"I think I can tell you," Ravenspur groaned. "It was the fancy portrait.
Some instinct tells me so."</p>
<p>"You are quite right, sir," Walter went on. "It was the portrait, surely
enough. But it did not belong to Stevens, as you will probably have guessed by
this time. It had been left in his care by an Italian friend, who gave a very
plausible reason for being in possession of so valuable a work. I understand
that this Italian's name was Luigi Silva. Have you heard of him?"</p>
<p>Lord Ravenspur rose from his chair, and walked agitatedly up and down the
studio. It was some little time before he spoke, and then his words came slowly
and painfully.</p>
<p>"I see you know more than I had expected," he said. "For instance, you have
formed the conclusion that this Luigi Silva stole that picture. In fact, that
he came here on purpose to get possession of it, and that he took two other
canvases at the same time to prevent us finding out his real motive. Till
to-night I had not the remotest idea why this Luigi Silva wanted that portrait,
because the loss of the other pictures utterly deceived me, as it was intended
to do. Now I know better."</p>
<p>"But you did not answer my question, sir," Lance suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; you wanted to know if I was personally acquainted with this man.
As a matter of fact, I am not, though I have heard far too much about him for
my peace of mind. But tell me, how did you manage to ascertain the fellow's
proper name?"</p>
<p>"That, of course, we got from Stevens," Walter explained. "Silva is in
England ostensibly as a music hall artist; in other words, he is Valdo, the
flying man that I told you about a little time ago. But don't you think we are
getting rather from the point, uncle? I want to know the history of this
man."</p>
<p>Once more Ravenspur commenced his walk up and down the room. He seemed to be
hovering between two minds.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would be wiser if I were to tell you everything," he said. "I
did not intend to do so, but to a certain extent you have forced my hand, and
it would be much more prudent for you to know where you stand. You asked me
just now what I knew of this man Silva. Eighteen years ago he was in the employ
of a great friend of mine, Count Boris Flavio. My unfortunate friend is
foigotten now, but at the time of which I am speaking he enjoyed almost a
European reputation. To begin with, he was an exceedingly rich man. He had one
of the most beautiful places on the Continent, situated not far from Florence.
Had he been poor, Flavio would have shone in any line he chose to take up. He
was a fine artist, a notable sculptor, and one or two of his books attracted
great attention. In addition to this, he had few rivals as an all-round
sportsman. His conversation was brilliant, his appearance and manners left
nothing to be desired. Out of the scores of notable men I have met in my time,
there is not one of them to whom I was so deeply attached as I was to Boris
Flavio. His views, his sympathies, his extraordinary grasp of character all
appealed strongly to me. So far as I know, he had no secrets from me, and it
came almost as a shock one day when I had a letter from him saying that he was
about to be married. Naturally one expected such a man to make a brilliant
match, but, on the contrary, Flavio chose a wife from people of whom one had
hardly heard. On the score of family, Carlotta Descarti had nothing with which
to reproach herself. And here comes in the strange part of the affair. The
Descartis and the Flavios had estates which touched one another, and between
the two families there had been a feud for centuries. It was a veritable
Montague and Capulet business, and I daresay it was this factor in the case
that so strongly appealed to my friend Flavio. Mind you, I did not learn these
facts till long after, and it so happened that circumstances prevented my
attending Flavio's wedding, and I never saw his wife. Two years later I
received an urgent and mysterious message from Flavio to go and see him
secretly, and meet him in the grounds of his estate without letting a soul know
that I was there... I never saw a man so changed as my unhappy friend. It
appeared that he had married a woman who was a perfect fiend. She had made more
than one attempt upon his life, and he felt certain that the end was not far
off. When I asked him why he tolerated such a state of things, he told me it
was for the sake of his little girl, to whom he was passionately attached. And
then he bound me to an extraordinary pronxise. Mind you, I would not have made
that rash promise to any other friend, but such was the charm and magnetism of
the man that I never even hesitated. And this is what I had to do. If anything
happened to my friend, if he died mysteriously, I was to go to Italy at once,
and, by fair means or foul, get the child away from the baneful influence of
her mother. Oh, you may look at me with astonishment, Walter, but stranger
things happen every day.</p>
<p>"I went away fully intending to keep my promise if occasion arose, and I was
not surprised to hear a few months later that poor Flavio had been found dead
in his room. It was proved that he had been poisoned, and suspicion immediately
fell upon his wife. On and off, the case lasted three or four years, and caused
a tremendous sensation throughout Europe. Beyond all question the wife was
guilty enough, but she managed to prove an extraordinary alibi, which so
puzzled the jury that they disagreed no fewer than five times. After that the
authorities recognised the futility of further proceedings, and the countess
was released. What became of her I don't know, for she disappeared, and, as far
as I can tell, has never been seen from that day to this. But most assuredly
she would have been convicted had it not been for the devotion of a servant of
hers whom she had brought from her old home with her. This servant's name was
Luigi Silva. It was he who saved his mistress. I am firmly convinced it was he
who engineered that marvellous alibi, and coached his witnesses so cleverly
that there was no flaw in their evidence. I was not present at any of the
trials, because I could not manage to get away, but I read enough to convince
me that this Luigi Silva had talents and courage far above the common."</p>
<p>"And the child?" Walter asked, with pardonable curiosity.</p>
<p>"Oh, I had almost forgotten the main part of my story," Ravenspur proceeded.
"The more I read of that case, the more convinced I was that I should be doing
right in carrying out my promise to my dead friend. It was not a difficult
matter. It only meant a joiuney to Italy and back, and the little one was in my
safe custody. I leave you to guess what that child is called now."</p>
<p>"Vera Rayne, of course," Walter said.</p>
<p>"Quite so. From that day to this she has been with me always. But, mind you,
I was not blind to the risk I was taking. If ever the truth came out, my life
was not worth much. I knew that I should be tracked and followed, and finally
lose my life, even if the search took twenty years. But, gradually, as the time
wore on, I became easy in my mind. I had taken the utmost precautions to blind
my trail, and the only accomplice I had was my old nurse, who has been dead for
some years. Besides, Vera was growing up, and it seemed to me impossible to
identify her with the baby not quite two years old. She is not in the least
like her father, either, and that is why I made a mistake. I had quite
forgotten that she might be very like her mother, and she I have never
seen."</p>
<h2><a id="chap15" name="chap15">XV - DALLAS MAKES A DISCOVERT</a></h2>
<p>"THE danger would certainly lie there," Walter said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"My dear boy, that is just where the danger comes in," Ravenspur replied. "I
haven't the remotest idea whether Vera is like or unlike her mother, but I fear
that she must be, otherwise that man Silva would never have got on my track, as
I have felt quite sure lately that he has done. Doubtless in some of his
wanderings he has seen the girl, he has recognised the likeness, and made up
his mind that he has found the object of his search at last. You see, he has
only to make a few inquiries amongst the servants, who would tell him that Vera
is my ward, and that, as to the rest, she is more or less of a beautiful
mystery. One can understand now why he should come to my studio and steal that
portrait."</p>
<p>"I think I can see a better theory than that," Walter said. "Wasn't the
portrait exhibited before it came back to the studio again? I seem to remember
somethmg of the kmd."</p>
<p>"Of course it was," Ravenspur exclaimed. "I had quite forgotten that. Silva
must have got his inspiration from the picture. I suppose that is why he made
that murderous attack upon Sir James Seton the other night, taking him, of
course, for me. But that is not the first warning I have had of the impending
danger, and I am afraid it won't be the last."</p>
<p>Walter listened to this desponding view with impatience.</p>
<p>"But, surely, you are not going to take it like this, sir?" he expostulated.
"By greatest good fortune we have discovered who your mysterious foe is. I
think it has been a wonderful slice of luck, and we ought to take advantage of
it. Surely you couldn't do any less than pkce the matter in the hands of the
police, telling them all that has happened. At any rate, you can do nothing
else. They can drive this man Silva out of the country. If I may be allowed a
suggestion, you will let Inspector Dallas know without delay. If you don't care
to tell him yourself, let me broach the matter. Indeed, it seems my imperative
duty to do so. If you fell by the hand of this man now I should feel morally
responsible for your death. And, besides, if anything happens to you, what are
we going to do about Vera? She is not yet of age. She might at any moment be
claimed by her mother, who you say is a perfect fiend. And, besides, though
this is a minor matter, I am deeply attached to Vera myself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know, I know," Ravenspur groaned. "The thing is hedged round with
troubles and difficulties. You know why I was against your marriage with Vera,
and how greatly distressed I was when I found everything out. If there had been
nothing in the way, nobody would have been more delighted at a match like that
than myself. But you see the danger, though you little know how deep and
far-reaching those Corsican vengeances are. How do I know that if you marry
Vera you would not be marked down for the same fate as myself?"</p>
<p>"I am prepared to risk that," Walter said grimly. "Still, at the present
moment, we have far more important things to talk about. And Vera must know
nothing of this."</p>
<p>"My dear boy, of course not. I should never dream of telling her. But sooner
or later she must discover everything for herself, I am afraid. I have been
thinking over what you said just now, and perhaps it would be as well to let
the police know."</p>
<p>"You will do it at once?" asked Walter eagerly.</p>
<p>"Well, no, I don't propose to do it at all. You have been so clever and
cool-headed in this matter that I have decided to leave everything to you. The
whole problem is so complicated that I am utterly imable to grasp it. I can see
no connection between the two, but I am perfectly certain that the death of
poor Delahay is all part of the coil."</p>
<p>"I feel that, too," Walter said. "But we need not concern ourselves about
that at present. By the way, have you seen anything of Mrs. Delahay
to-day?"</p>
<p>"She won't see me," Ravenspur replied. "She obstinately refuses to see
anybody. She remains wilfully blind to the fact that she is in a serious
position. You see, she declared in her evidence in chief that she had not been
outside the hotel on the night of the murder, and yet on the testimony of three
independent witnesses we have it that she was away upwards of three hours. Of
course, that man Stevens is a very suspicious character, but he could have
nothing to gain by swearing that he saw Mrs. Delahay with her husband very
early in the morning in Fitzjohn Square. Moreover, the man's evidence was not
in the least shaken. What to make of it I don't know. I wish you would try and
see her. You know her far better than I do, because you were a deal in Italy
before Delahay's marriage, and I think she likes you. Of course, she might have
some strong reasons for leaving the hotel and for keeping the thing a secret,
and she may be utterly and entirely innocent. But, really she ought to tell her
best friends what is the meaning of this mystery."</p>
<p>Walter glanced at his watch. It still wanted some minutes to eleven o'clock,
and it was no far cry to the Grand Hotel. A hansom took him there in ten
minutes. Mrs. Delahay had not yet retired for the night, and Walter sent up his
card, with a few urgent words pencilled on it. A maid came down presently with
the mformation that Mrs. Delahay would see him for a moment.</p>
<p>She came into her sitting-room perfectly calm and self-possessed, though the
deadly whiteness of her face and the scintillating of her eyes told of the
torture that was going on within.</p>
<p>"I wish you would let me help you," Walter said as they shook hands. "I wish
you would be advised by me. My uncle tells me that you refused to see him
altogether."</p>
<p>"I was bound to," Mrs. Delahay said in a low voice. "Oh, I know exactly what
you want. I am the victim of a set of extraordinary circumstances. My innocent
lie may get me into serious trouble. I am not blind to that knowledge, but at
the same time I cannot speak. I must allow people to think the worst. But I
swear to you if it is the last word I ever utter, that I was not with my
husband. I was not the woman the witness identified as the person he had seen
with Louis Delahay in Fitzjohn Square that terrible morning."</p>
<p>The words were quietly, almost coldly, uttered, but Walter believed them as
he would perhaps have refused to believe a passionate outburst on the speaker's
part.</p>
<p>"But surely," he argued, "you can give some account of your movements. You
can say why you went out and what for?"</p>
<p>"I cannot," Maria Delahay went on in the same even tones. "There are the
most pressing reasons why I should keep silent. My dear Mr. Lance, I am
grateful from the bottom of my heart for all your sympathy and kindness, but
nothing can move me from my determination. After all said and done, the police
can prove nothing against me. For the rest of my life I shall be a person to be
shunned and avoided, but I shall know how to bear my punishment
uncomplainingly. And in conclusion, I am quite convinced of this&mdash;if I
told you everything, you would say that I was perfectly justified in the course
I am taking. Further argument is useless."</p>
<p>Walter saw the futility of it, too. He saw in the woman's averted head and
outstretched hand, the sign that he was no longer needed, and that the
interview was at an end. By no means satisfied he made his way down to the
vestibule intent upon seeing Inspector Dallas without further delay. He was not
surprised to find the object of his search engaged in discussion with the
clerk.</p>
<p>"You are the very man I want to see," he said. "If you have ten minutes to
spare, I think I can give you some useful information. I have just been having
a long conversation with Lord Ravenspur, and he has asked me to lay certain
facts before you."</p>
<p>"I can come with you now," Dallas said. "We can talk as we go along the
road. Now, sir."</p>
<p>"It is rather a long story," Walter said. "I suppose you Scotland Yard
people keep yourselves <i>au fait</i> with most of the sensational crimes which
take place on the Continent? I suppose, for instance, you remember the death by
poisoning of Count Boris Flavio, and how his wife was chained no fewer than
five times with the crime?"</p>
<p>Dallas fairly started.</p>
<p>"That is a most extraordinary thing," he said. "I don't mind telling you
that within the last day or two, or rather within the last few hours, we have
blundered upon a startling light on that crime. It so happens that an Italian
detective, who has come here to take a prisoner back to Rome, has interested
himself in the Fitzjohn business, more or less because Mrs. Delahay is Italian
herself. This detective Berti was not in court during the inquest, but he came
round here an hour or two ago and expressed a casual wish to see Mrs. Delahay.
He managed to do so for a moment, and then he made a statement that fairly took
my breath away. But come with me as far as Scotland Yard and you shall hear him
tell the story himself. I won't spoil it for him."</p>
<p>A little while later Walter found himself in the presence of a slim,
diminutive man, with a fierce moustache and an exceedingly mild, insinuating
manner.</p>
<p>"This is my friend Berti," Dallas explained. "And this, Berti, is Mr. Walter
Lance, nephew of Lord Ravenspur. He mentioned the Flavio case to me just now
with a view to getting a little information. I told him that you had had the
whole business in hand, and you had better let him know that you are in a
position to place your finger upon the Countess Flavio at any moment."</p>
<p>"Oh, that is an easy matter," Berti said. "I had the privilege of seeing the
Countess this evening; but she does not call herself countess now. She is Mrs.
Louis Delahay."</p>
<h2><a id="chap16" name="chap16">XVI - STRONG MEASURES</a></h2>
<p>"YOU have made a most extraordinary mistake," Walter said. "On and off I
have known Mrs. Delahay for some considerable time. I am quite certain that she
is no relation whatever to Countess Flavio."</p>
<p>"And I, sir, am equally positive," the Italian detective replied. "I think
my friend Inspector Dallas told you just now that I had the Flavio case in hand
from the first. Indeed, I have had many conversations with the Countess. So
positive am I that I am right that I will be prepared to make an affidavit of
the facts."</p>
<p>"This is very strange," Lance murmured. "I cannot but believe that you have
been deceived by a strong likeness between two different women. I know all
about Mrs. Delahay. She comes from a very good Italian family, though I believe
they were poor; they were exceedingly proud and exclusive, and until the death
of her parents, Mrs. Delahay lived a life of almost monastic seclusion."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me her name?" Berti asked. "It might
facilitate matters."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Walter Lance replied. "Before she was married Mrs. Delahay was
Signora Descarti.</p>
<p>A peculiar smile flitted over his face.</p>
<p>"That is assuredly a point in my favour," he said, "seeing that Countess
Flavio also was Signora Descarti."</p>
<p>Lance began to feel less sure of his ground. It appeared to him that the
mystery was deeper than he had anticipated, and the more he came to
investigate, the more bewildering the puzzle was. Certainly be had known Maria
Delahay for the last three years on and off, but when he came to think over
matters it struck him for the first time with peculiar force that, really, he
knew little or nothing of Maria Delahay's antecedents. He well recollected the
time when Louis Delahay announced his approaching marriage. He recalled that
evening perfectly. Delahay had been a self-contained sort of man, and one of
the last persons in the world to associate with matrimony, but he seemed to
have found his fate at length, and had quite come out of his shell, discussing
his future wife with Lance.</p>
<p>And what was it that he had told him after all? In the first instance,
Signora Descarti was no longer in the bloom of her youth. In the second place,
she was shy and retiring, possibly because, up to a certain time, she had lived
such a secluded life. Despite the fact that she was of excellent family, she
was earning a precarious living with her brush, and Delahay had hinted that
there had been a romance in her early days which had coloured her life. Really,
beyond this, Walter Lance had no knowledge of this unhappy woman's past, and he
did not forget that the Flavio affair was nearly twenty years old. Except by
the police, the thing was absolutely forgotten. It was almost impossible that
anybody besides these authorities would recognise Carlotta, Countess Flavio, at
this moment.</p>
<p>It came upon Lance with quite a shock that his unfortunate friend, after
all, might have married a woman who had been tried five times on the capital
charge. Eighteen years is a long span in a human life, and many changes can
happen in that time.</p>
<p>Lance put aside the uneasy thoughts that rose to his mind, and turned to
Berti again.</p>
<p>"That is distinctly a point in your favour," he said. "I confess that the
fact that both ladies possessed the same maiden name comes as a shock to me.
And yet, even now, I can't altogether abandon the idea that this is nothing
more than a coincidence. But, tell me, what opinion did you form of Countess
Flavio's character?"</p>
<p>The Italian smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Enigma," he said, "the woman seemed to be without feeling altogether, from
the time that I arrested her until her final acquittal I never knew her display
any feeling at all. Even when I had to announce to her that she was at liberty,
she gave no sign of pleasure or relief. She was like a creature who had been
deprived of all the emotions, like some people you see who are deeply addicted
to the drug habit. I have seen her execrated by a mob of excited people, and
taking no more notice of them than if she were deaf. Yes; she was a most
extraordinary woman."</p>
<p>"Did you believe her guilty?" Lance asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, there you puzzle me," Berti replied. "Upon my word, I don't know.
Opinion was so equally divided; in each case the jury was balanced for and
against. Sometimes I thought the woman was guilty, and sometimes I thought she
was innocent. Of course, it was that extraordinary alibi which saved her life.
There was no getting away from it, for the testimony in the woman's favour was
given by people who were total strangers to her. On the other hand, all the
household servants came forward one after the other, and gave their mistress a
very bad name, indeed. On their testimony she would have been executed, without
a doubt. If only half they said was true, the Countess Flavio was a fiend."</p>
<p>Did no servant testify in her favour?" Lance asked. Well, one. And he was a
manservant who had accompanied the Countess from her own home. According to his
account, his mistress was a perfect angel, and the Count was no more nor less
than a disgrace to humanity. This testimony passed for very little, seeing that
Count Flavio's neighbours and tenants came forward and spoke of him as a man of
singular charm and virtue."</p>
<p>"I have heard that," Lance said, thoughtfully. "You see. Lord Ravenspur, my
uncle, was a great friend of the Count. I understand that he never met the
Countess, though he had an interview with the Count not long before his death.
According to what Lord Ravenspur says, at that time the Count walked in fear of
his life. He was very fearful lest his wife should try to destroy him. And now
you tell me that the Countess Flavio was no less than the wife of my friend
Delahay. I don't know what to think about it. I presume that Inspector Dallas
will take steps to assure himself that Mrs. Delahay is the woman you take her
to be."</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Dallas said grimly; "I don't see how the matter can rest here.
We know perfectly well that Mrs. Delahay was away from her hotel for upwards of
two hours on the night of her husband's death. It has been proved that she was
seen in his company. And yet, at the first outset, she declares that she has
not been outside her bedroom. One doesn't like to come to conclusions; they are
fatal things to form in our profession. But it seems to me pretty obvious that
there is one person who could clear up this mystery, and she happens to be the
dead man's wife."</p>
<p>Lance had nothing to say in objection to this. Still, at the same time,
there was a haunting doubt in the back of his mind that circumstances were
shaping themselves against Maria Delahay apart from any faults of her own.</p>
<p>"You haven't enough to justify an immediate arrest, I suppose?" he asked.
"You see what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I see perfectly well what you mean, sir," Inspector Dallas replied.
"There is nothing to gain by such a course. It is impossible for the woman to
get away. Indeed, we should take immediate steps to prevent her leaving the
country. If she is the guilty party, she will be much more use to us as a free
woman than she would be as a suspected criminal under lock and key. But, unless
I am mistaken, Mr. Lance, you came here to tell me something."</p>
<p>"I had dean forgotten all about it," Lance exclaimed. "But as it is getting
late now, if you don't mind I will leave it till the morning. It is a long
story."</p>
<p>A few moments later and Lance was retracing his steps in the direction of
the Grand Hotel. He was going to do wrong; he was going to do something which,
sooner or later, might land him in serious trouble, but that did not deter him
for a moment. In the hall of the hotel he scribbled a hasty note, and sent it
up to Mrs. Delahay. A message came down in a moment or two to say that Mrs.
Delahay would be pleased to see Mr. Lance.</p>
<p>He found her waiting in the sitting-room, just as cold and pale and
impassive as before.</p>
<p>You have something very important?" she asked. Indeed, I have," Lance
exclaimed. "I want you to believe that I am actuated entirely by the
friendliest motives, and if I speak plainly you will understand that I am not
wanting in feeling. I have been with Inspector Dallas to-night and he
introduced me to an Italian detective whose name is Berti. The latter assures
me that his name is quite familiar to you."</p>
<p>"He is quite mistaken," Mrs. Delahay said in her cold, even voice. "I don't
know anybody of that name. As to a policeman, I never had the honour of
speaking to one in my life."</p>
<p>"You are quite certain of that?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. If it were true, what should I have to gain by denying it? If
you have anything to say to me, it will be far better to speak quite
plainly."</p>
<p>The woman spoke quietly enough. It was impossible to believe that she was
wilfully deceiving her questioner.</p>
<p>"Very well, then," Lance said, "I may as well tell you that this man Berti
was the detective who had the Flavio case in hand. You will remember, of
course, what an extraordinary sensation that drama caused in Italy many years
ago."</p>
<p>"Did it?" Mrs. Delahay said indifferently. "I never had the slightest
interest in that kind of thing. So far as this particular case is concerned, I
never heard of it before."</p>
<p>Lance could only stare in astonishment. She was speaking and acting now just
as, according to Berti, the Countess Flavio had behaved before and during the
trial. Was she the sport of circumstance, or was she the woman she denied
herself to be?</p>
<h2><a id="chap17" name="chap17">XVII - LOOKING BACKWARDS</a></h2>
<p>"THAT is very strange," Lance murmured. "I am told that the trial in
question was the talk of Europe for two or three years. I believe the papers
were full of it at the time. And yet you don't seem to have heard of it. Isn't
the name of Flavio familiar to you at all? It is not a common name."</p>
<p>As Lance spoke he saw a swift and subtle change pass over the face of his
companion. A flame of colour stained either cheek; then it was gone, leaving
her still more ghastly white than before.</p>
<p>"I have not. told you quite the truth," the woman said; "but in twenty years
one forgets even the keenest of sorrows. Now I come to think of it, the name of
Flavio reminds me of one of the most unhappy experiences in my existence. There
was a certain Count Flavio whose estates joined those of my father. For some
generations there had been a deep and bitter feud existing between the Flavios
and the Descartis. The head of the Flavios was a very old man, who had two
sons. Not to make a long story of it, the young people met, and fell in love
with each other: the young people on one side being my sister and myself. The
intrigue was found out, of course, and for the next ten years I was practically
a prisoner in my father's house. He had a gloomy old fortress somewhere up
country, and there I was detained. I might have been there still had my parents
lived."</p>
<p>"And your sister?" Lance asked. "What of her?"</p>
<p>Again the woman hesitated. Again the look of pain and suffering swept like a
wave across her face.</p>
<p>"They told me my sister was dead," she murmured. "I had to take their word
for it."</p>
<p>"And you believed it? You believe it still? I hope you will pardon me for my
persistent questions, but it is quite necessary that I should put them. Do you
feel quite convinced?"</p>
<p>Once more Mrs. Delahay hesitated. Once more she seemed to shrink as if in
physical pain.</p>
<p>"How can I know? How can I tell?" she asked. "Did I not say that I had been
a prisoner all those years? This would account for the fact that I know nothing
about that Flavio tragedy. Are you going to tell me that it is one and the same
family to whom my sister and myself were attached?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I do," Lance went on. "Your Count Flavio had two sons. When he died
his elder son came into the title and estates. That was the man who was
afterwards poisoned by his wife; at least, a great many people think so. And
his wife's name was Carlotta. Her surname was Descarti. My dear Mrs. Delahay,
it is impossible to believe that this is a coincidence."</p>
<p>"I quite agree with you," Mrs. Delahay said, in a low voice. "They seem to
have deceived me about my sister, and my parents told me that she was dead. I
suppose they meant that she was dead to the family. She must have made her
escape, and married her lover after all. I was less fortunate. But what you say
absolutely overwhelms me. The man that my sister loved was a splendid specimen
of humanity; he was kind hearted and generous; in every sense of the word he
was a gentleman. And I can vouch for my sister's many good qualities. To say
that she poisoned him is absurd. Why, she simply worshipped him. But, tell me,
what opinion did the world form as to the merits of this extraordinary
case?"</p>
<p>"I want to spare you as much pain as possible," Lance murmured. "But your
sister was held up to execration as a fiend in human form. One servant after
another gave evidence to this effect. They seemed to think that your sister was
not altogether sane&mdash;but why should I torture you with these details? What
I really came here to tell you is this. The Italian detective, Berti, who had
the case in hand, is in England at the present moment, and he has seen you. He
declares that you are Countess Flavio. You can flee how seriously this
accusation may tell against you&mdash;later on."</p>
<p>Lance uttered the last two words reluctantly enough, but Mrs. Delahay saw
their full significance.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what you mean," she said. "You mean that I have placed myself in
a perilous position. But there is one thing I can assure you&mdash;I am not the
Countess Flavio. If necessary, when the time comes, I can prove this in a
manner which would set even that Italian policeman's suspicions at rest. It is
very kind of you to take all this trouble on my behalf. I suppose you want me
to tell the whole truth, and say why I denied being away from the hotel the
other night, when three people can come forward and show that my statement is
false. Well, it was false. I don't mind going as far as that. But more I cannot
and will not say, except that I am an innocent woman who has been a prey to
cruel misfortune all her life."</p>
<p>There was determination as well as sadness in the words. Lance could see
that he was merely wasting his time.</p>
<p>"Think it well over," he said; "give it every consideration. I will call and
see you again in the morning."</p>
<p>No reply came from Maria Delahay. She merely held out her hand, and Lance
took his leave without another word. Then the woman dropped into a chair, and
covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>Why did Fate persecute her in this way, she asked herself. Why had her life
been such a misery for the past twenty years. Surely all this was a terrible
price to pay for a childish indiscretion. And yet, though the years had been
long and burdensome, it seemed but a brief step back to the happy, sunny days
when she and her sister had been children playing in the Woods at home and
getting every drop of enjoyment out of life. Then they had hardly comprehended
the feud that existed between the Descartis and the Flavios. Indeed, they had
looked upon it as rather a silly business altogether and a distinct nuisance to
mutual friends and neighbours. They had begun to notice, too, that the sons of
old Flavio were good to look upon, and finally one day a slight adventure in
the woods had thrown the young people together.</p>
<p>The thing had begun in a harmless fashion enough. They met again, and yet
once more. They fell in the way of discussing the family quarrel and making
light of it. From then on the path was pleasant and easy enough, and one day
the two girls awoke to the fact that they were both deeply in love with the
sons of their hereditary enemy. It was at this point that stern old Descarti
discovered the great secret.</p>
<p>What happened after that Maria Descarti hardly knew. There was a terrible
storm of rage and passion, sleepless nights, and tear-bedewed pillows, and then
such a life of greyness and despair that the girls had never dreamt of. When at
length she ventured courage to ask after her sister, she was told that the
latter was dead. She took this statement literally, and she resigned herself to
the inevitable.</p>
<p>The prison doors were open at length, but only on the death of her parent,
and there she was at forty years of age, helpless and friendless, with no
knowledge of the world, and nothing to aid her besides her brush and pencil.
The struggle was indeed a hard one, and it looked like ending at length when
she came in contact with Louis Delahay. She had no strong passion to give him,
nothing but the tranquil affection of approaching middle age.</p>
<p>She had been perfectly candid in the matter, and Delahay knew exactly what
he had to expect. Perhaps the prospect of tranquil happiness was far better
than the rosy dreams of youth. And all this was now shattered by the unexpected
tragedy.</p>
<p>Maria Delahay had reached this point in her thoughts; then her mind wandered
on to what Lance had recently told her. And so, after all, her sister was
alive. This knowledge had not reached Maria Delahay to-night. She had suspected
it for some days, and it had come about in quite a prosaic way.</p>
<p>She could see it now quite clearly in her mind. The pleasant-mannered
chambermaid had come into the sitting-room soon after Delahay had gone out on
that fatal evening. She had evidently taken a liking to her visitor. Maria
could see her now as she fussed about the room.</p>
<p>"Is there anything you want?" she asked.</p>
<p>"You seem to have forgotten me," the girl said. "I waited upon you when you
were here last spring."</p>
<p>"Last spring!" Mrs. Delahay exclaimed. "Why, surely, you have made a
mistake. I have never been here before."</p>
<p>"Oh, madam," the girl said reproachfully, "you are making fun of me. You
came here by yourself, and stayed for the best part of a week. You had very few
visitors, and you used to talk to me a good deal... Only the name is different.
You used to have Carlotta, not Maria, on the envelopes I brought up to
you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Delahay started. With difficulty she restrained her feelings, for the
chambermaid's innocent words had let a flood of light in a dark place. In the
happy old days people were constantly mistaking her for her sister. Was it
possible that her sister was still alive? Was it possible that she had been
deceived all this time? A little dissimulation might be the means of getting
the truth from the voluble chambermaid.</p>
<p>"You have sharp eyes," she said, "and, no doubt, a good memory. How long did
I stay here, and where did I go afterwards?"</p>
<p>"It was a little over a week," the girl said. "And then you went away to
Number Seventeen, Isleworth Road, Kensington. I remember the address because I
have a sister in service who used to live next door. Perhaps madam does not
want to be remembered? There are many reasons why it is prudent not to know too
much."</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you are so discreet," Mrs. Delahay smiled. "There is no
reason to mention this to anybody else, you understand?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap18" name="chap18">XVIII - AFTER MANY YEARS</a></h2>
<p>LEFT alone to herself, Maria Delahay had summed up the situation clearly and
logically. Beyond all doubt her sister was still alive. Beyond all doubt
Carlotta had been staying at the Grand Hotel within the past twelve months.
She, too, seemed to have had her misfortunes, misfortunes more keen and cruel
than even those of her younger sister. It was very strange that Maria should
learn the truth in this fashion. It was stranger still that she should discover
the house to which Carlotta had gone on leaving the hotel. Up to this moment
Maria had no idea of going out herself. She intended to go straight to bed and
await her husband's return.</p>
<p>Now a strange restlessness came over her. She felt it impossible to remain
imprisoned within those four walls. There was no likelihood of Louis Delahay's
return for the next two hours. Why, then, should she not go out and take a cab
as far as Isleworth Road? It was very late, of course, but then London was a
late place, and a midnight call no novelty.</p>
<p>Allowing herself to act on the impulse of the moment, Maria walked
downstairs, and out into the Strand. Hailing a cab, she was driven to Isleworth
Road, where she gave orders for the driver to stop. The locality was a
respectable one, and there were lights in a good many of the houses; but at
number seventeen Mrs. Delahay met with disappointment. The house was not empty,
though the blinds were down, and there was not a light to be seen. The dingy
nature of the steps and the tarnished look of the brasswork testified to the
fact that neither had received any attention of late. As Maria stood there
ringing the bell for the third time, in the faint hope of making somebody hear,
a policeman came along.</p>
<p>"You are wasting your time there, lady," he said civilly enough. "The people
are not at home. I think they are coming back at the end of the week, because
my instructions to keep a special eye on the house don't go beyond
Saturday."</p>
<p>Maria thanked the officer and went back in a cab. She would have liked to
have asked more questions, but she restrained her natural curiosity. After all,
it was not a far cry to Saturday, and even then she might meet with a
disappointment. In all probability her sister had left London long ago.</p>
<p>Maria was thinking all these things over now that Walter Lance had gone. She
wondered that her sister bad so completely passed out of her mind. But, then,
she had had so many terrible anxieties to weigh her down. She could not sleep
for thinking of the tragedy. She paced up and down the room in a vain attempt
to get away from herself. The clocks outside were striking the hour of
midnight, but the roar of the Strand was going on still as if it were high
noon. A sudden resolve came to the woman. She would go out at once and try her
luck at Isleworth Road again.</p>
<p>She took no cab this time. She knew the way. As she walked along she was
conscious of the fact that she was being followed. She smiled bitterly to
herself. What had those people to be afraid of? Did they think she was going to
run away?</p>
<p>Her heart gave a great leap as she saw the lights gleaming behind the drawn
blinds at No. 17. She had only to ring once, then the door was promptly opened
by a typical English servant, who waited for the visitor to speak.</p>
<p>"I think there is a lady here I want to see," Maria stammered. "At least she
was here for some time in the spring. You see, she is my sister, and we have
not met for twenty years. It may appear strange, but I don't even know her
name."</p>
<p>It seemed to Maria that this was a proper precaution on her part. Though her
explanation sounded weak enough, to her great relief she saw the servant smile
and open the door a little wider.</p>
<p>"That's all right, madam," the servant said. "I can see that you are my
mistress's sister by the likeness. Will you please come this way."</p>
<p>The next five minutes seemed like an hour to Maria. Then the door opened,
and a tall, dark woman came in. The two looked at one another for quite a
minute in absolute silence. It was so strange to meet after all these years, so
sad for both to see how the other had altered. Then Maria Delahay moved
forward, and the two women kissed each other almost coldly.</p>
<p>"Why did you come here?" the Countess said. "How did you manage to find me
out? I thought you were dead."</p>
<p>"I thought you were dead, too, till the other night," Maria said. "I was
told that twenty years ago. I should not be here at all but for an amazing
chance. You will remember that you were staying at the Grand Hotel some time in
the spring, and it so happens that my rooms are on the same floor as yours, and
that the same chamber-maid is still there. When she welcomed me as an old
customer I guessed by instinct that you were still alive. And if you only knew
it, there is a providence behind this thing."</p>
<p>Countess Flavio appeared to be listening in a dull, mechanical kind of way.
There was no disguising the fact that she was both distressed and disconcerted
to find herself face to face with her long-lost sister again.</p>
<p>"You know nothing of my history?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Not till to-night," Maria said. "I have recently been listening to it. I
knew nothing. How could I know anything? When our, dream of happiness came so
suddenly to an end I became practically a prisoner in that dreadful old house
of ours near Naples. I was told that you were dead, and I believed the story. I
knew nothing of your existence till a day or two ago. I was utterly ignorant of
the fact that you had had such a dreadful time. Not that I would believe
anything they say, Carlotta, because I know what you were in the old days. But
however dreadful your experiences have been, you, at any rate, snatched a brief
happiness. You married the man of your choice. How did you manage to
escape?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't ask me," Carlotta Flavio said bitterly. "If you only knew
everything you would see that you were far better off in your prison than I was
with my liberty. Do you know that I was five times tried for my life? Do you
know that for four years I was the most execrated woman in South Italy? But I
am not going into that now. I want to know what brings you here this evening.
Why you should come at such an inconvenient time?"</p>
<p>"But why inconvenient?" Mrs. Delahay protested. "We were fond of one another
in the old times. And what more natural than I should seek out my sister at the
first opportunity? But you are changed. Doubtless your misfortunes have soured
you. I have had my misfortunes, too. Of course you have heard lately a good
deal about Mr. Louis Delahay&mdash;I mean the unfortunate artist who was found
murdered in his studio the other night?"</p>
<p>Countess Flavio started. Her lips grew white.</p>
<p>"Who has not heard of it?" she said. "The papers are full of the tragedy.
People are talking about nothing else. But you are not going to tell me that
there is any connection&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I am," Maria went on. "As I said just now, for years I was no
better than a prisoner. I should be a prisoner still if our parents had lived.
Then, finally, when I found my freedom, I made a discovery that there was
absolutely no money left. I was forced to get my own living. I had nothing
beyond my brush, and things were going from bad to worse with me when I made
the acquaintance of Louis Delahay. We always liked one another from the first,
and when he asked me to many him I gladly consented. It seemed to me that the
way was opening up for a happy middle-age. It seemed to me that Fate had got
tired of persecuting me at last. I married Louis Delahay and we came back to
England."</p>
<p>"You married Delahay?" the Countess said mechanically, "and you came back to
England? I am trying to realise it. I read the account of the inquest. I know
that people are saying that Delahay's wife is responsible for his death; but I
did not dream then that it was my own sister whom folks were condemning. I
cannot believe it now. But why did you go out that evening. If you had remained
in your room nobody would have been&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I left the hotel to come here," Maria replied. "But I found that you were
not in London. And now I am going to tell you why it is that I have refused to
speak, why it is that I have allowed people to regard me as a perjurer. You say
you read the account of the inquest. Do you recollect what a poor creature
called Stevens said? He swore, and, what is more, he believed every word he
said, that he saw Louis and myself together in Fitzjohn Square early on that
fatal morning. Come, if you read the paper carefully, you must have seen that.
It was the most sensational piece of evidence given at the inquest. The man
picked me out in court, and said positively that he had seen me with Louis. But
he didn't, as you know perfectly well."</p>
<p>"As I know perfectly well?" the Countess stammered. "What have I got to do
with it? Where do I come in?"</p>
<p>Maria Delahay threw up her hands with an impatient gesture. There was a
steady gleam in her eyes now. She had lost all her listless manner.</p>
<p>"I was not there," she said," because I was somewhere else. That James
Stevens saw someone with my husband on that morning is absolutely certain. It
is absolutely certain, too, that he did not see me. Then who did he see whose
likeness to me is so great as to deceive a pair of keen eyes under a brilliant
electric light? It was you, you, Carlotta, who were walking with my husband at
that hour in the morning. Now tell me what it all means."</p>
<h2><a id="chap19" name="chap19">XIX - CARLOTTA'S STORY</a></h2>
<p>"OH, this is terrible," the Countess stammered.</p>
<p>"Of course it is," Maria Delahay cried. "Why don't you be candid with me? I
have told you what my name is, and, besides, you already knew. When you saw my
husband on that fatal night your likeness to me would have struck him at once,
and explanations would have followed. Then why are you trying to deceive me
now?"</p>
<p>"I hardly know what I am saying," the Countess replied. "The whole thing is
such a terrible complication. I don't want to deceive you, Maria, and I will
tell you all I can. You might believe me or not, but when I read of the death
of Louis Delahay, for the moment I had quite forgotten you. You see it was a
great shock to me when you came in just now, especially as I had not seen you
for so many years. But I am getting muddled up again. I am beginning to wonder
which of us is which. It seems to me that all this miserable business is merely
the result of the strong likeness which exists between us."</p>
<p>"Never mind that," Mrs. Delahay cried. "If you will remember, in my evidence
I said my husband had gone out, that he did not return all night, and that I
found him dead in Fitzjohn Square in the morning. I was out of the hotel for
nearly two hours trying to find you, after I had been so strangely put on your
track by the chambermaid. Perhaps it was a foolish thing on my part to conceal
my absence, but, of course, I never guessed the result of my folly. It never
occurred to me till afterwards that my absence from the hotel could be so
easily proved. Even that did not matter so much. And when the witness Stevens
swore that he saw me with my husband at a time when I had said I was in my
hotel, things began to look serious for me. I know perfectly well that I may be
arrested at any moment on a charge of murdering my husband. How true that
charge will be I leave you to judge for yourself. But the mystery was no longer
a mystery to me when Stevens told the court most positively that he had seen me
with my husband. I did not know that Louis was acquainted with you. He never
mentioned your name, but directly Stevens had finished I knew that it must have
been you who was with my husband; and now I must ask you to give me an
explanation."</p>
<p>"That is an easier matter than it seems," Countess Flavio said. "I knew'
Louis Delahay, though he had no acquaintance with me."</p>
<p>"That sounds impossible," Maria murmured.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it does, but it is true all the same; and to make my story plain
I shall have to go back nearly eighteen years. The events which led to my
making Louis Delahay's acquaintance took place near Florence at the time I
mentioned."</p>
<p>"That is strange," Mrs. Delahay murmured. "I was in Florence about then,
too. Yes, I know I told you that I was practically a prisoner all those years,
but there were times when I had a certain latitude. I was very ill about that
time, and the doctor ordered me to Florence, saying that it was good for me to
see people and mix with crowds. I was supposed to be there by myself, but there
was no movement of mine which was not noted. I never took even the shortest
walk without being dogged and spied upon. The people who called themselves my
servants were, in reality, my gaolers. But why do I worry you with these
trivial details when there is so much of importance to say? Go on with your
story."</p>
<p>"Well, as I was saying," the Countess explained, "I was in Florence with my
husband. We had been married then something like three years. We had rather a
lonely villa on the outskirts of the town. Ours was not a happy life; indeed,
it was most miserable. I daresay there were faults on my side, too; but one
night we had a violent quarrel, and, on the spur, of the moment, I made up my
mind to run away. I managed to get all my jewels together. I managed to leave
the house in darkness and steal through the grounds to the road. I was dressed
all in black, and I remember the night was very thick. Just as I was
congratulating myself on my escape my husband overtook me. He was beside
himself with passion. He laid violent hands upon me. I believe he would have
killed me if I had not managed to wrench myself free and make for the road.
What we said I do not know, but I suppose our voices must have carried far, for
I had only got a little down the road, with my husband in hot pursuit behind
me, when a man emerged from the cottage and caught me by the arm. At first I
thought he was one of my husband's tools, but the first words that he said
reassured me."</p>
<p>"'Do not be afraid,' he whispered. 'I was trespassing on the Count's
property just now, and I heard all that was said. That man is dangerous, and it
is necessary that I should protect you for the present. Come in here with
me.'"</p>
<p>"He did not wait for me to consent. He fairly lifted me from the ground into
the blackness and seclusion of the cottage. It was all done in less time than
it takes to tell. A moment later I heard my husband go raging down the road,
and then I knew that my life was saved. Mind you, it was altogether too dark to
see my rescuer. It would have been imprudent to strike a light. I stayed for
some little time until I regained my composure, after which I made up my mind
to return home again. It would never do for people to think that a Descarti was
a coward, and, besides, there were other considerations. I would go back home
again and give my husband one more chance, especially as I had a friend in the
house in the person of Luigi Silva, who had followed me on my marriage. At the
same time, I did not forget the dictates of prudence. It might be still
necessary for me to seek an asylum, and my instinct told me that I could trust
the man by my side. On the spur of the moment I implored him to take care of my
jewels for me. He demurred for a time on the score that he was a perfect
stranger to me, then, finally, he consented, at the same time taking from his
pocket a card, which he said contained his name and address. And thus the
strange interview ended, thus we parted, never to meet again till that fatal
night we came together in Fitzjohn Square. I know the story sounds
incredible."</p>
<p>"Not to me," said Mrs. Delahay, sadly. "Nothing could be incredible to a
woman who has gone through what I have. But go on. You went back home again,
after entrusting your jewelry to a perfect stranger whose face you had never
seen."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I did. And we should never have known one another even if we had
met. I went back to the villa, and afterwards we returned to our estate. But it
was not for long. A month or two later my husband was found dead in bed, and it
was proved beyond question that he had been poisoned. Then began a time for
me&mdash;a time of terror and anxiety so great that I sometimes marvelled that
I retained my reason. For four years the torture lasted, and then, at length, I
was free. I was in so strange and morbid a condition that the sight of a human
face was hateful to me. I wanted to go off and live on some distant island
until I recovered my nerve and strength again. I succeeded at length in finding
the place I needed, and for twelve or thirteen years I led a life of absolute
seclusion in a little cottage high up the Italian Alps. I had taken a certain
amount of money with me, but I woke up to the fact one day that my means were
exhausted. You must know that I fled straight away, as soon as the last trial
was finished, and that all those years I never saw a single face that was
familiar to me. But by the end of that period I was quite myself again. I felt
a strange longing to go into the world and see what life was like once more.
Besides, there was my child to consider."</p>
<p>"Your child?" Mrs. Delahay cried. "This is the first time you have mentioned
a child. Do you mean to say that you could part with your own flesh and blood
in that callous way?"</p>
<p>The Countess' expression hardened for a moment.</p>
<p>"She was his child as well as mine," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Well, what of that? I fail to see that it makes any difference. Your
husband might have been a passionate man, but, apart from that, everybody spoke
exceedingly well of him. He was immensely popular. He was clever and generous.
He had hosts of friends&mdash;I know that through an English nobleman, who was
greatly attached to the Count. Everybody spoke well of him."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know, I know," the Countess said, with a bitter smile. "The catalogue
of his virtues was trumpeted high enough at the trial, and I was no more than
an inhuman wretch, not fit to live, certainly not fit to have a husband like
Count Boris Flavio. But you shall hear my story presently. You shall hear what
my witness has to say. At any rate, I hated my husband with a deep and abiding
hate, so that I could not bear to look upon the face of his child. You may say
that all this is unnatural and inhuman, but you little know what I had to put
up with. Still, twelve or fourteen years will heal most wounds, and when I came
back into the world I was possessed with a longing to see my daughter. I did
not like to go back to the old place again, so I sent to make inquiries.
Imagine my feelings when I heard that my daughter. Vera, had been kidnapped
during the time of the first trial, and that she had never been seen again.
That is two years ago now. I managed to communicate with Luigi Silva, and he
was just as astonished and surprised as I was. Naturally, he thought that I had
made arrangements with Vera, and that she was with me all the time. One of my
reasons for coming to England was to try and find my child. My other reason was
to see Mr. Louis Delahay and get my jewels back from him. This was quite
imperative, as I am at my wits' end for money."</p>
<h2><a id="chap20" name="chap20">XX - VALDO IN A NEW LIGHT</a></h2>
<p>"HOW did you know my husband was in England?" Maria asked.</p>
<p>"I didn't," the Countess confessed. "I looked for him all over the
Continent. I should have written to him, only I had mislaid his card, which I
found at length after a long search. Seeing that the address was Fitzjohn
Square, I thought I would come and interview Mr. Delahay. It was quite late at
night that I found that he was staying at the Grand Hotel, and as things were
very pressing indeed, I sent him an express letter asking for an interview
early in the morning. In response I received a telegram saying that he would
see me at once, and if I could manage to be at the corner of Fitzjohn Square at
one o'clock in the morning. I told you just now that things were very urgent,
because I had taken this house furnished, and I had already had one or two
unpleasant interviews with the landlord, who naturally wanted his money. The
telegram seemed to be reasonable enough. Artists are very late people, and,
besides, it occurred to me that Mr. Delahay had probably had those jewels in
his house. At any rate, I met him. You can imagine how astonished he was when
he saw my face. Of course, he naturally concluded that I was your sister, but
he seemed to think that you had told him that I was dead. I suppose that was
so."</p>
<p>"Certainly it was," Mrs. Delahay said. "I was definitely told that you were
dead. And when I related our unhappy story to my husband, I always spoke of you
as one who was no more."</p>
<p>"Yes; I quite see. Well, we went along very pleasantly together to the
house, and it seemed to me that all I had to do was to get those jewels and
come and call upon you. Naturally, I had not heard of you for years. Indeed, I
regarded you as dead, much the same as you were under the impression that I no
longer lived. But when we reached the studio, a light was burning there, and,
looking in, I saw a man painting, a handsome man whom your husband told me was
Lord Ravenspur. You can imagine that neither of us wanted to be seen. There was
no occasion to raise any doubts in the intruder's mind, and so we waited till
he was gone. Then my case of jewels was handed over to me, and I came straight
back here. Not till late the next afternoon did I know what had happened."</p>
<p>"Then there is nothing more you can tell me?" Mrs. Delahay asked.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to say there is not. But since you have been here certain
suspicions have begun to grow in my mind which fill me with dread. It would not
be fair to utter them yet, until I am more certain of my facts. Still, I am
glad you have come now, because I think you will be of assistance to me. You
heard me speak just now of Luigi Silva, but, of course, you will remember him
perfectly well?"</p>
<p>"I recollect him," Mrs. Delahay said. "A queer-tempered man, with strange
and wayward moods, but he was sincerely attached to us. I should like to see
him again."</p>
<p>"You shall see him," the Countess said. "And if you have half an hour to
spare it shall be this very night. When I discovered that my daughter had been
stolen I got in touch with Silva, who, as I told you just now, was under the
impression that I had taken Vera away and placed her in safe custody, lest the
authorities should interfere and remove her from my influence. When he found
that I had barely given Vera a thought all these years, he was furiously angry
with me. Indeed, his rage knew no bounds. He had always been so faithful; he
had always worked so hard for me, that I was astounded. He refused to have any
more to do with me. He went off without leaving his address, and for some
little time I have been searching for him in vain. Quite by accident I found
him the other night. He seems to have turned his athletic powers to advantage,
for he is performing in London now as a kind of flying man. I have seen the
performance, and it is exceedingly clever. But that isn't what I want to talk
to you about. I know where Silva, or Valdo, as he now calls himself, is to be
met with. Within a few moments I want you to come along and add your persuasion
to mine."</p>
<p>"I will do anything you like," Mrs. Delahay said; "anything to get to the
bottom of this singular mystery."</p>
<p>The Countess started up at once, and proceeded to don her hat and cloak.
Then she led the way to the back of the house.</p>
<p>"There is a way out here," she said, "which leads into a lane. Now, come
along. We have not very far to go."</p>
<p>They turned out of the lane presently into a quiet, secluded thoroughfare,
where the Countess stopped. They had not long to wait, for presently two
figures came down the road, talking earnestly together. The light was not good,
but it was quite sufficient to show Mrs. Delahay that one of the men was James
Stevens.</p>
<p>"The witness, Stevens," she whispered. "He must not see us together. There
are many reasons why it is inadvisable that he should learn the truth. The
other man looks like Silva; only it is difficult to be sure after all these
years. Let me stand in this doorway till you have managed to get rid of
Stevens."</p>
<p>The Countess nodded her approval, and Maria Delahay slipped into the shadow
of the door. From where she stood it was quite possible to see what was going
on. She saw her sister approach the two men. She did not fail to note Stevens
start as he recognised, or thought he recognised, the woman who was known to
him as Maria Delahay. On the still air she could catch a word or two.</p>
<p>"Very well," she heard Silva say sullenly. "I have one or two things to say
to my friend here, and then I'll come back to you."</p>
<p>The two men came past where the woman was standing in the doorway. They were
conversing in deep whispers, so that the listener could catch only a word or
two, yet those words filled her with vague apprehension. She caught the name of
Ravenspur as it came hissing from Silva's lips. Then there was something she
could not follow, and, finally, clearly enunciated the one word "to-night." A
moment later and Stevens was shuffling off down the street, while Silva
returned to Countess Flavio. As Mrs. Delahay joined them, the little Italian
glanced from one to the other.</p>
<p>"So you are both here," he said.</p>
<p>There was something in the insolence of his manner that moved Mrs. Delahay
to anger.</p>
<p>"I should hardly have known you," she said; "certainly I should not have
known you from the tone in which you are addressing us. Have you quite
forgotten what you owe to your late master's children?"</p>
<p>"I have forgotten nothing," Silva said. "Why do you come here persecuting me
like this? Why cannot you let me alone? But for me your sister would have been
in a dishonoured grave by now. I saved her life. I saved the good name of the
family. And how am I repaid? What does she care so long as she saves herself.
And yet I remember her a sweet and innocent child, just as I remember her own
little one. Ah, I was fond of her, and she was fond of me. I could never have
gone off and hidden myself, and left little Vera to the tender mercies of the
world. I, a man, no relation, couldn't have done that. But that her mother
could have done such a thing&mdash;ah, it seems unnatural, unwomanly."</p>
<p>"You will find her for me?" the Countess said timidly.</p>
<p>"I have found her," Silva whispered fiercely. "But whether I have found her
for you or not is quite another matter. I was your good friend once. I was your
devoted slave and servant. I would have laid down my life for you both, and you
know it. But all that I felt for you was as nothing compared to my love for
your little one. And when you told me that you had left her without another
thought, my blood fairly boiled with passion. I thought you had taken her with
you. I fondly imagined that you were devoting the rest of your life to her
welfare and happiness. And then, one day, you come coolly to me and ask me
where you can find your child. You go your own way, and leave me to go mine. I
suppose you have found out that I come this way home, and so have waylaid me.
But you will never get me to raise a finger on your behalf again. Still, it
does not much matter. I know where the child is. I shall know how to act when
the time comes. My vengeance is ready, when I care to stretch out my hand to
take it."</p>
<p>The words poured from the speaker's lips in a torrent of passionate
vehemence. He fairly quivered with rage. He seemed to be beside himself with
anger. There was something almost akin to madness in his eyes, "Oh, calm
yourself," the Countess said. "My good Silva, I make every allowance for your
feelings, but you are going altogether too far. You, above all men, ought to
know how I longed to get away from anything that reminded me of my husband.
Don't forget that she was his child as well as mine, and that she had her
father's eyes and charm of expression. Besides, I was barely responsible for my
actions then. Consider what I had had to go through. Consider my mental torture
and degradation. And yet you say it was my duty day by day to watch my child
and see the hateful pleasantness of her father's smile looking at me from
behind her innocent features. Oh, I couldn't do it. I tried to persuade myself
that it was my duty, but all to no avail. I was in such a state of nervous
exhaustion then, so near the borderland of insanity, that I believe I should
have taken the life of the child if she had gone with me. And, naturally, I
thought that she was with friends. I knew that you would see that she was all
right. And, in addition to all this, she was her father's heiress."</p>
<p>"But who was interested in taking her away?", Mrs, Delahay asked. "I don't
see how anybody could gain anything by saddling themselves with a child like
that."</p>
<h2><a id="chap21" name="chap21">XXI - TO BE IN TIME</a></h2>
<p>"IT is plain enough to me," Silva growled; "but then I am acquainted with
the facts of which you two know nothing. With all his faults, Count Flavio was
passionately attached to his little girl. Through her he could see a means of
stabbing his wife to the heart, and he was never the man to hesitate where a
piece of refined cruelty was concerned. He arranged that kidnapping
himself."</p>
<p>"Incredible," Mrs. Delahay cried. "And why?"</p>
<p>"Have I not just told you so?" Silva went on. "You remember Count Flavio and
his brother twenty years ago? You recollect what a handsome man he was? No one
was more popular or sought after. No one was more pleasing and fascinating. But
behind that fair exterior was the nature and disposition of a devil. Oh, I knew
it before that unhappy marriage took place. And that was why I insisted upon
accompanying Signora Carlotta when she fled with the count. It was not long
before she found him out. It was not long before he began to employ the petty
tyrannies which poisoned her life and made existence almost unendurable. I have
stood behind his chair when guests have been present. I have seen his clever
simulation of affection, whilst all the time he was saying things that wound
sensitive women and drive them to despair. Many a time I have been tempted to
thrust a knife between his shoulders. More than once I have had my hand upon a
blade. But if I stayed here all night I could not sum up the catalogue of that
man's diabolical cruelties. And when at length he paid the penalty of his
crime, I stood by my mistress, and saved her from a felon's grave. It was hard
work, for everything was so cunningly laid that my mistress stood convicted
from the very first. Perhaps Count Boris reckoned upon an untimely end. At any
rate, all his servants, and the greater part of his tenantry, followed one
another in the witness-box and gave him the character of a saint, whilst his
wife was painted in the blackest colours. But for a little scheme of mine, she
would have been convicted beyond the shadow of a doubt. Still, we are getting
away from the point. I was going to prove to you how I knew that the Count had
arranged for his daughter to be kidnapped before his death. Some time previous
to his marriage one of his greatest friends was an English nobleman, called
Lord Ravenspur. Quite by accident, a few months before the tragedy, I saw a
letter which the Count had written to Lord Ravenspur imploring the latter to
give him a secret interview at once. In that letter the most horrible charges
were levelled against the Countess. But we need not go into those now. I
managed to get hold of the reply to the letter, and I had no scruples in
reading it. Mind you, I did not think then that there was a plot on foot to
kidnap the child, and I was prevented from attending the interview owing to the
cunning of the Count, and within a few weeks afterwards I had plenty of things
to occupy my attention, so that those letters were forgotten. And so things
went on for years, until I heard from the Countess again, and I found that she
knew nothing of her child. Oh, I have made no secret of my feelings in that
matter. I have spoken quite freely to-night."</p>
<p>Silva paused for a moment, and wiped his heated face.</p>
<p>"From that time forward," he went on, "I have devoted myself almost
exclusively to my search for the child. It did not occur to me till
comparatively recently that Lord Ravenspur had had anything to do with it. In
fact, that nobleman's name had quite gone out of my mind. I heard him spoken of
from time to time as a great artist. I am fond of pictures myself, and about
three years ago I went into a private view in Bond Street, and there I saw a
face which attracted my attention. It was the head of a young girl precisely
what little Vera would have been by that time. The more I studied those
features, the more convinced was I that here was the object of my search. And
when I asked the name of the artist, I was told that it was none other than
Lord Ravenspur.</p>
<p>"Then it came upon me like a flash that my search was at an end. The
recollection of those letters came to me; then I knew as plainly as possible
that, at the instigation of the Count, Lord Ravenspur had taken the child away.
Those two were in league together. But the one who still lives shall not escape
his punishment. I will see to that."</p>
<p>But are you quite sure?" the countess asked eagerly. Have you seen Vera?
Does she live with Lord Ravenspur?</p>
<p>"That I don't quite know," Silva said. "I have hung about the house; I was
determined to find out things for myself without raising suspicions in the
minds of the servants. I gradually discovered what the household consisted of.
On and off for the last two years I have watched and waited, but I saw no sign
of anybody resembling the girl of whom I was in search. And gradually I began
to think that I had made a mistake. Business took me away to the North for some
months, and when I came back again I put in a day or two more in Park Lane in
the faint hope that I might be rewarded at last. And I was. At length I saw
her. And now you know where your daughter is to be found if you want to see her
again. I am perhaps wrong to tell you this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But where had she been?" the Countess exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Ah, it is easy to be wise after the event," Silva said. "She had been at
school on the Continent for the past three years, and that is why all my
efforts ended in failure. I did not mean to tell you this. I meant to have kept
it to myself as a punishment for your heartless conduct all these years. But I
must own that your arguments impressed me. I can see now how the child would
have reminded you of her father. And that is why I have said so much. But, at
the same time, this thing has been an indignity to the famIly which I cannot
overlook. Lord Ravenspur will have to pay the price of his audacity. Blood is
thicker than water&mdash;"</p>
<p>Silva appeared as if he would have said more. But he checked himself, and
his words died away in low mutterings. In some respects it seemed to Mrs.
Delahay that the man was sane enough. In other matters she was convinced that
he was little better than a dangerous lunatic. Were they on the eve of another
dreadful tragedy, she asked herself, or was this man merely uttering vapouring
threats when he spoke in this fashion of Lord Ravenspur?</p>
<p>"You will do nothing rash?" she said.</p>
<p>A queer smile flickered about the corners of Silva's lips. His eyes were
glittering like stars.</p>
<p>"Oh, I will do nothing rash," he said significantly. I have been brought up
in the wrong school for that. When we South Italians take our vengeance, we
strike and strike hard. But it is done in the dark, so that the right hand does
not know what the left is doing. But we never forget, and we never
forgive."</p>
<p>Silva turned on his heel, and walked slowly and thoughtfully away. The
Countess called for him to come back, but he took no heed. He might have been
deaf to the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," she said; "at any rate, I shall know where to find him
again. But are you not coming back with me?"</p>
<p>"I think not," Mrs. Delahay said. "It is getting very late, and I must be
returning to my hotel. But, if you like, I will come and see you again, only it
must be stealthily and in the dark. You will quite see the advisability of our
not being much together till this cruel mystery has been cleared up."</p>
<p>They parted at the corner of the street, and Mrs. Delahay continued her way
slowly, always keeping the figure of Silva in sight. An impulse to follow him
had suddenly seized her, though she had said nothing of this to her sister. She
recollected vividly enough now the words that had passed between Silva and
Stevens as to Lord Ravenspur, and the things that were going to happen
to-night. For all she knew to the contrary, she might be the means of
preventing another tragedy. She felt almost sure of this presently as Silva
turned into Park Lane, and pulled up before Lord Ravenspur's house.</p>
<p>The street was quite deserted, so that the man had no great need for
caution. He stood there just a moment longer; then coolly entered the garden by
way of a side gate. Apparently he had come prepared for this. He let himself
into the garden with a key. Very cautiously Maria Delahay followed. She noticed
how dark the garden was, the shadows being all the more dense by reason of the
blaze of light which came filtering through the glass dome of the studio.
Though the glass was stained, and it was impossible to see through, the light
inside was strong and steady.</p>
<p>Half hidden behind a bush the watcher waited developments. Presently she
heard Silva creep cautiously to the side of the studio. Then, a moment later,
to her amazement, she saw that he was slowly climbing to the top of the dome,
by means of one of the ribs in the roof. The man appeared to be as lithe and
active as a cat. The smallest foothold seemed to suffice him. He made his way
to the top of the dome, and Mrs. Delahay could see him peering in curiously. He
stood just for a moment debating.</p>
<p>There was no time for further hesitation. It was very late now. Probably all
the household had gone to bed, and doubtless Lord Ravenspur was alone in the
studio. She knew something of his habits from her husband. Without a moment's
hesitation she flew back into the road, and ran to the front door of the
house.</p>
<p>She pressed the button of the bell. She could hear the ripple right through
the house. It seemed to her as if no one was ever coming. Then presently there
was the sound of a footstep inside, and the door was flung open by Walter
Lance.</p>
<p>"Not a moment," she gasped. "Get to the studio at once."</p>
<h2><a id="chap22" name="chap22">XXII - THE WORTH OF A NAME</a></h2>
<p>THE great house in Park Lane was brilliantly lighted up, and passers-by
asked themselves what distinguished company Lord Ravenspur was entertaining
to-night. Inside the house the master of it all was counting the moments till
he should be alone. He was only giving an informal dinner, but the guests
numbered upwards of thirty all the same. And now they were disported all over
the house. Ravenspur sat in the great hall, with its mosaic floor and wonderful
marble pillars. It was one of the show places of London, the envy of many whose
means were greater than Ravenspur's. The veiled lights shone through palm and
fern. The sultry evening seemed to be rendered cooler by the murmur of the
fountains. It was possible to sit there and see the fish darting hither and
thither, so that the effect of being somewhat far away in the seclusion of the
woods was complete. A tall, fair woman, marvellously attired, was languidly
singing the praises of the place to her host.</p>
<p>"There is nothing like it," she said. "It is absolutely unique. We have
tried the same effect in America, but, somehow or another, it seems so
artificial, so wanting in repose. You are the most fortunate of individuals.
Lord Ravenspur."</p>
<p>"So my friends tell me," Ravenspur smiled. "But you must not always judge by
appearances."</p>
<p>If his guest only knew, Ravenspur thought. If she could only guess what his
feelings were at that moment. The beauty of the place had been a delight to him
at one time. He had enjoyed the planning and building, but now he would have
changed it for the meanest cottage, if only he could approach to peace and
comfort thereby. The house seemed full of omens. Danger seemed to lurk
everywhere. No doubt those banks of palms behind the water gave a charming
effect to the hall, but then, an assassin might have hidden behind them, for
they afforded plenty of cover. The genial smile was still on Ravenspur's face.
No one would have guessed the grey tenor of his thoughts. Even the pretty woman
by his side had no idea how anxiously he was watching the clock in the
gallery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the guests flitted from place to place, and Ravenspur could hear
the click of the balls in the billiard-room. Somebody was playing brilliant
music in the drawing-room. Usually, Ravenspur's guests were loth to leave, and
to-night was no exception to the rule; but presently they began to drift away,
until, at length, Ravenspur was alone.</p>
<p>He heaved a deep sigh of relief. He rose and turned in the direction of the
studio. As he did so a slim, white figure came down the broad stairs, and Vera
Rayne stood before him. She was looking her very best to-night. There was an
extra dash of colour in her cheeks, a sparkle in her eyes. The look that
Ravenspur turned upon her was half affectionate and half sad.</p>
<p>"You did very well to-night," he said, "considering this is the first time
you have done me the honour to act as hostess to my guests. You played your
part quite to the manner born, Vera. We shall have no occasion to call in the
services of Lady Ringmar any more. You will find yourself paragraphed in the
papers now."</p>
<p>Vera did not appear to be listening. Her beautiful face had a grave look
upon it now. She hesitated for a moment before she spoke. There was no hurry
about her words, but Ravenspur could not fail to see that she was palpably
nervous.</p>
<p>"It will not be for long, then," she said. "My dear guardian, can I have a
few moments' conversation with you? It is not so very late, and one so seldom
gets an opportunity."</p>
<p>"How grave you are," Ravenspur smiled. "We will go as far as the library, if
you like, and then I can smoke a cigar and listen to your weighty utterances.
Come along."</p>
<p>It was cosy enough in the library, and much more inviting of confidences
than the stately splendour of the pillared hall. Ravenspur threw himself back
in an arm-chair and lighted a cigar. Then he signified to Vera to proceed. Her
lips were trembling now. Something bright and diamond-like twinkled under her
lashes.</p>
<p>"You have been very kind to me," she said unsteadily.</p>
<p>"Have I really, my dear? Nothing out of the common, I am sure. And what have
I done? Given you a good education and found you a comfortable home; and from
first to last you have never caused me a moment's anxiety. I have become as
fond of you as if you were my own child. It will be a genuine grief to me when
the right man comes along and takes you away from here."</p>
<p>"There is not much fear of that," Vera smiled wistfully. "Of course, you may
think me ungrateful. You may say that I am showing a great deal of
dissatisfaction&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear girl, you are not dissatisfied, surely?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid I am. You see, things cannot go on like this. I hate to have to
talk in such a fashion, but the time has come when I must speak. All these
years you have been showering benefits upon me. You have been treating me as if
I were your own flesh and blood. The money alone that I must have cost you is
enormous; and, so far as I know, I have not a penny."</p>
<p>"You will have when I die," Ravenspur said lightly.</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't talk like that; it makes my task all the more diffIcult. I
have realised for a long time now that I cannot stay here, a dependent on your
bounty. I can never feel sufficiently grateful for what you have done for me in
the past. I could not possibly put my feelings into words; but I have made up
my mind that I must get my own living in the future. It is a very hard thing to
say, but I am going to leave you."</p>
<p>"Did anybody ever hear anything so foolish?" Ravenspur cried. "Why, this is
your home. Is it your fault that you are utterly incapable of getting your own
living? When I brought you here&mdash;a child in arms&mdash;I gave your father
a solemn assurance that you should be my own daughter in future. I have made
provision for you in my will. Some day you will be rich, as things go. And now
you talk of leaving me in this cold-blooded fashion.</p>
<p>"Don't you see that I cannot do without you? But let me try and touch that
gratitude of which you spoke. Surely, after watching over you so carefully all
these years, you are not going to leave me at the very moment when you can make
something like an adequate return? You are practically mistress of the house
now, and my welfare is entirely in your hands. Need I say any more after
that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you try me sorely," Vera cried; "and yet my path is quite plain. Even
at the risk of incurring your displeasure, I cannot remain here. And now I come
to the point. Before I go I want you to tell me who I am, and who my parents
are."</p>
<p>"Yes; I think you have a right to know that," Ravenspur said thoughtfully;
"but, if you don't mind, we will not go into that to-night. It is too late, and
the story is too long. Believe me, you will be the happier for asking no
questions. There is a dark tragedy behind your young life which is now
forgotten, and I am perfectly sure you would bitterly regret it if you stirred
the scandal up again. 'Let sleeping dogs lie,' Vera. Be content to know that
you are of good family, and leave the rest alone."</p>
<p>The girl's face grew a shade paler. Her eyes had a suggestion of pain in
them as she turned to the speaker.</p>
<p>"I think I understand," she murmured. "If my suspicions are correct, this is
a great blow to me; but, having said so much, I think I must know the rest. And
now, now you see how impossible it is that I can remain here much longer."</p>
<p>Ravenspur was silent for a moment. He had forgotten the little scene which
he had witnessed some time ago between Vera and Walter Lance. So that was why
she was going. She had given her heart to Walter, and only too late she had
discovered that a marriage between them was out of the question.</p>
<p>The same subject was uppermost in Vera's mind. They were both looking at the
same thing from a different point of view; and it seemed to Vera that if
Ravenspur's words meant anything, it meant that she was not even entitled to
the name she bore. Every drop of blood appeared to have left her heart. She
stood there, white and breathless. Yet, amidst all her storm of thoughts, one
dominant idea possessed her. The time had come to strike now. There must be no
further delay. She must leave the house. She must go out into the world to get
her own living. She would stay here no longer under these shameful
conditions.</p>
<p>"You have spared my feelings," she began. "I almost wish now that I had not
asked you any of these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Vera broke off abruptly as the door opened, and Walter Lance came into the
room. He looked uneasy and anxious. He started to say something to Ravenspur,
then he paused, as he saw that Vera was standing there. In spite of the girl's
utter misery and dejection, she did not fail to see that she was in the way
now.</p>
<p>"I am just going," she said. "I am going as far as the drawing-room. When
you have finished with your uncle I should like to have a few words with you,
Walter."</p>
<p>"You had much better go to bed," Ravenspur said, with a sudden stern
inflection in his voice. "It is getting late, and I am sure that you must be
tired. Vera."</p>
<p>The girl made no reply. She walked through the door on the far side of the
library and made her way into the drawing-room. Uncle and nephew stood there
facing one another; they could hear the sound of Vera's piano softly
played.</p>
<h2><a id="chap23" name="chap23">XXIII - THE NEXT MOVE</a></h2>
<p>"WELL, and what is it now?" Ravenspur asked. "You look as if you had seen a
ghost. Is there anything new in this ghastly business? Have the police solved
the problem?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, the problem gets more bewildering every hour," Walter
said. "As you know, I was going to talk over our side of the puzzle with
Inspector Dallas, and he gave me some startling information. As soon as ever I
mentioned the Flavio business he told me that he had made a discovery which
connected it closely with the death of poor Louis Delahay. It appears that
there is in England at the present moment an Italian detective, called Berti,
who had the Flavio affair in hand."</p>
<p>"I recollect the name perfectly well," Ravenspur murmured.</p>
<p>"It appears that Berti has seen Mrs. Delahay since the inquest. He was
rather interested in the affair, and he contrived to get a sight of Mrs.
Delahay. And now comes the most extraordinary feature of the story. Berti is
absolutely certain that Mrs. Delahay is no other than Carlotta, Countess
Flavio."</p>
<p>"Impossible," Ravenspur cried. "The man is mistaken."</p>
<p>"He is prepared to swear to his statement, any way," Walter said. "And,
after all, I don't see why it should be unpossible. In fact it is not in the
least impossible, and I'll tell you why. After this amazing thing came out I
thought it my duty to go back to the hotel and see Mrs. Delahay. I told her
what Berti said, and taxed her with being a principal in the Flavio
tragedy."</p>
<p>"And she denied it promptly, of course?"</p>
<p>"She did. She told me quite calmly that she had never heard of the Flavio
affair. I confess her words staggered me, because they were so calm and
self-possessed. I watched her narrowly when I was speaking, and she never so
much as changed colour. Even when I told her the story she appeared to be as
mystified and puzzled as ever. She said, as she has always said, that for the
best part of her life she has been more or less a recluse, and altogether out
of touch with the world's happenings. You see, Berti was so confident, and Mrs.
Delahay so self-possessed, that I was utterly puzzled."</p>
<p>"There is nothing to be puzzled about," Ravenspur said. "The Italian
detective has made a mistake. His recollections of Carlotta Flavio's features
after eighteen years have become blurred. For goodness sake, don't let us harp
upon this absurdity. Surely, there are enough complications without this!"</p>
<p>"So I thought at first," Walter said. "But you will recollect telling me the
story of your friend Count Flavio and his unhappy marriage. There were two
Descartis &mdash;Carlotta, who married your friend, and Maria, who disappeared
and was not heard of for years. Now isn't it rather significant, bearing in
mind what Berti says, that Mrs. Delahay's name should be Maria?"</p>
<p>Ravenspur looked up with a startled expression.</p>
<p>"Well, yes," he exclaimed. "But I see you have more to tell me. Will you
please go on?"</p>
<p>"I am coming to the interesting part now," Walter said. "Though I was
prepared to believe that Mrs. Delahay knew nothing of the Flavio affair, I was
by no means satisfied. I felt that there must be something in the Italian's
story. I was certain of it when Mrs. Delahay admitted that her maiden name was
Descarti. Oh, please let me finish. It was Mrs. Delahay's sister Carlotta who
was the wife of your friend the Count. Hence the very natural mistake made by
Berti. He had not seen the Countess, but her sister. The strong likeness
between them would account for the misunderstanding."</p>
<p>"And this is really a fact?" Ravenspur cried. "Strange that it should not
have come out before."</p>
<p>"But why should it, my dear uncle? You say that you never saw Count Flavio's
wife. You have not the slightest idea what she was like. All you know is that
she was an exceedingly bad woman; and that you rescued her child from a
questionable future. On the other hand, Maria Delahay is secluded from the
world for eighteen years. She is told by her parents that her sister is dead.
She knows nothing of the terrible Flavio scandal. This is a fact, because she
told me so herself. Indeed, we had it all out. She has to come back to the
world again when her parents die. She is compelled to get her own living. It is
only natural that she should change her name, and there you are."</p>
<p>Lord Ravenspur pondered over the matter for some time in silence.</p>
<p>"You saw a great deal more of the Delahays than I did," he said.
Practically, I have not seen them together at all. Now how do they strike you.
I mean, before their marriage, did you think that the woman really cared
anything for our poor friend?"</p>
<p>"I am sure she did," Walter said emphatically. "Of course, there was no
passionate attachment between them; they were too old for that. But I am quite
certain that Maria Delahay's affection was sincere enough. After what I have
seen the last day or two, I decline to believe that she had anything to do with
her husband's death. I believed her when she said she never saw him from the
time she left the hotel till she found him dead in the studio."</p>
<p>"And that opens up another theory," Ravenspur exclaimed. "If it wasn't Maria
Delahay the witness Stevens saw that night in Fitzjohn Square, then it must
have been her sister Carlotta."</p>
<p>"My word, that never occurred to me!" Walter cried. "And yet the solution is
as simple as it is probable. I wonder if it is possible to obtain a photograph
of the Countess?"</p>
<p>"There were plenty of them published at the time of the trial," Ravenspur
said. "Of course, I mean in the illustrated papers. I have got the whole of
them somewhere upstairs. Not that I pay much attention to newspaper
photographs, as they are rarely any use. I'll go and see if I can find
one."</p>
<p>Ravenspur turned hurriedly and left the room. He was gone some considerable
time, leaving Walter to stand there and ponder over the result of his night's
adventure. The more he thought the matter over, the more complicated it became.
He put the thing away from him almost petulantly. He was suddenly conscious of
the fact that the music in the drawing-room was very soft and soothing. Then it
flashed across him that Vera had something to say. Ravenspur might be a little
time longer, and there was no opportunity like the present.</p>
<p>Only a portion of the drawing-room lights were on, together with the piano
candles, and Vera sat there half in the shadow, a pathetic looking figure
enough, in her white dress. As Walter approached he could see that her face was
very pale, and that her eyes showed signs of recent tears.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" he asked. "What fresh trouble is this?"</p>
<p>Vera's hands fell away from the keys. She rose from her seat.</p>
<p>"It is not altogether a fresh trouble," she murmured, "it is only the old
one become more acute. Do you remember my telling you the other day that I felt
how impossible it is for me to remain here any longer? But I must go away."</p>
<p>"My dearest girl, why?" Walter asked. "You know perfectly well how much I
care for you. You know perfectly well that you could not look me in the face
and declare that you do not love me as well as I love you. Now, could you?"</p>
<p>"That is what makes it all the harder," Vera whispered. "Oh, I am not going
to prevaricate about it. We have always been good friends, Walter, and in the
last few months I have realised that friendship has given way to a more tender
attachment. Perhaps it was that which opened my eyes. Perhaps it was that that
made me ask myself some questions. I felt quite sure that Lord Ravenspur had
guessed nothing of our secret In fact, it was a secret to me till one afternoon
in this very room..."</p>
<p>"I am not likely to forget," Walter said tenderly.</p>
<p>"Well, then, you see I began to think. No father could have been kinder to
me than Lord Ravenspur. I owe him a debt that I can never repay. But, though he
has taken me into his house, and brought me up as if I belonged to his own
flesh and blood, it does not follow that he considers me good enough for his
nephew, the future holder of the title. And when he did find out not long ago,
I saw at once what a dreadful disappointment it was to him."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it was," Walter said grudgingly. "But he did not set his face
against it when I placed the thing before him in a proper light. He merely
stipulated that our engagement must be a secret between us for the present. I
am sure he is much too just a man, much too kind hearted to spoil our
happiness. You are too sensitive, Vera; your sense of honour is too high."</p>
<p>The girl's lips quivered piteously.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am," she whispered. "But there is another thing which I have
learned to-night, a thing which prevents me from remaining here an hour longer
than is necessary. It is the question of my birth. I learned that to-night for
the first time. Oh, do not humiliate me any further. Do not force me to speak
any more plainly. If you knew the shameful story of my parents you would
realise at once how unfitted I am to become&mdash;"</p>
<p>The girl said no more. She covered her face with her hands, and burst into
tears. As to Walter, he was too astonished to speak. In the tense silence that
followed the hall bell rang violently again and again. Vera looked up
swiftly.</p>
<p>"You had better go yourself," she said. "It may be important." (She was
deeply grateful for the interruption.) "Go yourself; everybody else is in
bed."</p>
<h2><a id="chap24" name="chap24">XXIV - A BLOOD RELATION</a></h2>
<p>WALTER choked down an ugly word that rose to his lips. He resented the
intrusion just at a moment when he particularly desired to be alone with Vera.
Who was it, he wondered, who came so late? And who rang so imperiously and
persistently for admission? He flung back bolt and chain, and opened the door.
With her nerves all unstrung, and with a certain intuition of impending
calamity upon her. Vera had followed him into the hall. She had dried her eyes
now; she showed little sign of her recent agitation. She heard Walter's
exclamation as he recognised the intruder.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, it is Mrs. Delahay!" he cried. "What can you want here at
this hour?"</p>
<p>"The studio," Mrs. Delahay gasped. "Get to the studio at once. If your uncle
should happen to be there&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can reassure yourself on that point," Walter said. "Lord Ravenspur is
at present in his bedroom."</p>
<p>Maria Delahay pressed her hand to her heart She gave a little gasp of
relief. She was too breathless to explain. All she needed now was a chair to
support her failing limbs. As Walter stood there it flashed upon him that
something wrong must be taking place in connection with the studio. He had not
forgotten the vivid incident of the other night. Perhaps at this very moment
the clue to the puzzle was in his hands. He turned round, and his gaze fell
upon Vera, who was watching Mrs. Delahay curiously.</p>
<p>Take this lady into the drawing-room," he said, and wait till I come back. I
shan't be very long."</p>
<p>Vera came forward with a sympathetic smile upon her face. A light was
shining on her features. Maria Delahay could see how fair and sWeet she was.
And so this, she thought, was her sister's child. This was the girl from whom
her mother had voluntarily separated herself for upwards of eighteen years. It
seemed impossible, incredible to believe, but there it was. And the girl's hand
was under Mrs. Delahay's arm now. She was being gently assisted as far as the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>"I am sure you are Mrs. Delahay," Vera said, in her most sympathetic voice.
"If all had gone well we should have met before now. I cannot tell you how
sorry I am for you. I do hope this dreadful mystery will be cleared up before
long. And now can I get you anything? I suppose you came to see Lord
Ravenspur?"</p>
<p>Maria Delahay hesitated for a moment. There was no occasion to tell this
beautiful child the dread import of her presence there. It seemed a wicked
thing to bring her within the range of the trouble.</p>
<p>I should like to see Lord Ravenspur, yes," she said So you are his ward.
Vera Rayne? Really, I cannot see any likeness between you and your father."</p>
<p>The words had slipped unconsciously from Maria</p>
<p>Delahay's lips before she had time to think what she was saying. It was only
when she noted the startled look in Vera's eyes that she realised the full
extent of her imprudent speech.</p>
<p>"Did yon know my father?" Vera cried.</p>
<p>"What am I saying!" Mrs. Delahay exclaimed. "My head is so dazed and
confused that I don't know what I am talking about. Just for a moment I was
filled with a foolish idea that you were Lord Ravenspur's daughter. It would be
strange if you bore a likeness to him, seeing that he is only your
guardian."</p>
<p>Vera was silent for a moment. Mrs. Delahay's impetuous speech had filled her
with misgivings. She did not know, she could not feel sure that, after all.
Lord Ravenspur might stand in closer relationship to her than that of a
guardian. But she put the trouble out of her mind now. She had other things to
occupy her attention. And after all said and done, the poor creature by her
side was in deeper grief and anxiety than herself.</p>
<p>"I think I will go up and tell my guardian you are here," she said. "I know
he will be glad to see you."</p>
<p>Vera was spared the trouble, for at that moment Ravenspur came into the room
with a bundle of papers in his hand. He started as he caught sight of Mrs.
Delahay.</p>
<p>"You here at this hour!" he exclaimed. "I hope&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No; there is nothing particularly wrong," the woman said. "I should like a
few words with you if I am not intruding."</p>
<p>Vera discreetly left the room, and walked off towards the library. There was
a stern expression on Ravenspur's face as he looked at his visitor. He waited
for her to speak.</p>
<p>"I daresay you will think this is rather singular of me," she faltered, "but
I came here to-night because your life is in danger. I believe that the man
called Luigi Silva is under your roof at the present moment. You know who I
mean?"</p>
<p>"I know perfectly well," Ravenspur replied. "It would be absurd to pretend
to misunderstand you. And so it turns out after all that you are the sister of
my poor friend Flavio's wife. Did Delahay know your identity before he married
you?"</p>
<p>"He knew all there was that was worth knowing," the woman said, a little
defiantly. "He knew the story of my miserable youth, for instance. I don't want
you to misunderstand me. I don't wish to pretend that I had any ardent passion
for my husband. But my affection was deep and sincere, and my loss is almost
more than I can bear. Oh, I know what you are going to say. You are going to
ask what I know about that wretched Flavio affair. I repeat in all sincerity
that I knew nothing till the other day. I did not even know that my sister was
alive, not until I visited her to-night at her house in Isleworth Road. I was
not aware that she had married Boris Flavio. I did not know that she had a
child&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you know who the child is?" Ravenspur asked swiftly.</p>
<p>"Yes; I know now," was the significant reply. "I have just been talking to
her. What a beautiful girl she is! How sweet and natural! How open and candid
is her face! It seems almost incredible to me that my sister could have
forgotten her child all these years. I could not have done so."</p>
<p>"No; nor any other woman worthy of the name," Ravenspur said grimly. "But
though you lived with your sister till early womanhood, you had no real
conception of her character. I never met her myself, for which I am devoutly
thankful. But I learnt enough, and more than enough, of her character from
Flavio's letters to me. If ever a man was cursed with a fiend incarnate in the
shape of a wife, Flavio was that man. Oh, I don't wish to give you pain, for
you have suffered enough of late. But I know what I am talking about. The mere
fact that you alluded to just now is proof positive that your sister is
incapable of affection for her child. More or less by accident you have made
this discovery to-night. By sheer chance you know that your sister's daughter
is under my roof. For a long time past I have known that some agency has been
at work to deprive me of the girl, an agency so utterly unscrupulous that my
very life is in danger. I suppose that man is acting for your sister, who has a
sudden whim to gain possession of her child once more. And now I am going to
ask you a favour. You are to say nothing of what you have found out tonight. I
have told you what your sister is, and no doubt my words will prove true before
long. I am going to ask you to give me a solemn promise that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is too late," Mrs. Delahay exclaimed. "Whatever my sister may be is all
beside the point. She knows where her daughter is, and Luigi Silva knows also.
He told us everything not long ago. I found out by accident that he was coming
here. I saw him enter the house a few moments ago. I believe he is in your
studio at the present moment. That is why I rang the bell so furiously; that is
why I prayed I should not be too late."</p>
<p>Ravenspur started violently.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is intolerable," he cried. "One could hardly believe it possible
that this is London in the twentieth century. I had thought that those insane
vendettas had died out before this, even in Corsica. I must go at once and
see&mdash;"</p>
<p>As the speaker turned away Maria Delahay held out a detaining hand. Her face
was pale and pleading.</p>
<p>"Your life is too valuable to be risked in that headstrong fashion," she
said. "Besides, I have already warned your nephew, who appears to know
everything. He went off to the studio at once. I have no doubt that he has
scared Silva away by this time. But why don't you put this matter in the hands
of the police? Why run this risk when a few words would prevent any danger? And
there need be no scandal. Silva could be warned. He would have to leave the
country, and then there would be an end&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And this from you who are a half Corsican yourself," Ravenspur said
reproachfully. "I could free myself from Silva, no doubt, but before many
months had passed another man would take his place and my danger would be
greater than ever. You see I have the advantage of knowing my present
assailant. To quote the old saying, 'Better a devil you know than a devil you
don't know.'"</p>
<p>Maria Delahay had nothing to say in reply. She was turning the matter
rapidly over in her mind. It seemed to her that she could see a way out of the
difficulty.</p>
<p>I think," she began, "that perhaps&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words were never finished, for suddenly the tense silence of the house
was broken by a quick cry and the tinkling sound of broken glass. Then, in the
distance somewhere, a door banged sullenly, and silence fell over the house
once more.</p>
<h2><a id="chap25" name="chap25">XXV - BRED IN THE BONE</a></h2>
<p>MEANWHILE, Walter Lance had lost no time in Teaching the studio. It did not
need any elaborate explanation on the part of Maria Delahay for him to know
that, in some way, the danger came from the man whom he knew as Valdo. Walter
did not doubt that this was not the first time that the Corsican had visited
the studio, though, as yet, he was utterly unable to grasp how it was that the
attempt had been so successful.</p>
<p>There was danger here, and Walter knew it perfectly well, but he was too
filled with indignation to think of anything else. So far as he could see,
nothing had as yet taken place. The studio was absolutely empty, and the full
blaze of the electric lights disclosed no danger.</p>
<p>Watching eyes were probably not far off, and it behooved Walter to be
circumspect. He whistled an air. He strolled from place to place, ever and
again glancing upwards to the roof. He felt quite convinced that it was the
roof from which danger threatened, but there was nothing to be seen, no sign of
movement in the branches of the acacia.</p>
<p>Still, the miscreant must be near at hand. He might even be watching the
solitary occupant of the studio at that moment. Walter made up his mind what to
do.</p>
<p>He switched off all the lights and shut the door of the studio, at the same
time affecting to turn the key in the lock. If Valdo were hiding close at hand,
he would take this for an indication that the studio was locked and closed for
the night.</p>
<p>This being done, Walter crept back again and took up a position at the foot
of an acacia. If Valdo entered the studio at all he was bound to come that way.
Doubtless he had made his way over the roof, and presently it would be an easy
matter to flutter from the dome on to the top of the acacia. Such a plan as
this would present no difficulties to the flying man. Therefore, Walter braced
himself for the effort which would be required of him presently.</p>
<p>He had not much doubt as to the issue. From the point of physical strength
he was a match and more than a match for the Italian. There was just the chance
that the latter might make use of his knife, but that had to be risked. A
quarter of an hour passed slowly, and Walter was beginning to get impatient.
What he most feared now was that Lord Ravenspur might return and demand to know
why the studio was in darkness. This would probably have the effect of scaring
Valdo away, and Walter would have all his trouble for his pains.</p>
<p>The minutes passed along, and no one came; but at length Walter's patience
was rewarded. He heard a slight swish and sway in the branches of the acacia
overhead. He could hear deep and regular breathing coming nearer and nearer to
him. Then, presently, in the darkness, he discerned the lithe figure of the
Italian. A moment later, and the intruder was caught below the elbows in a grip
that made him fairly grunt again. He struggled just for a moment, but the
steady grip seemed to crush the life out of him, and he desisted. Walter bore
him back until his left hand shot out, and the whole studio was bathed in flame
once more. Before Valdo could realise what had really happened, Walter's hands
were all over him in a search for weapons. Nothing more dangerous come to light
than a small sheath-knife, which Walter swept into his pocket. He was quite
calm and self-possessed now. He coolly indicated a chair, into which Valdo
flung himself sullenly.</p>
<p>"Now I should like to have a little conversation with you," he said. "You
will recollect that we have met before."</p>
<p>"I have not forgotten the fact," Luigi Silva said sullenly. "It was at the
Imperial Palace Theatre."</p>
<p>"Quite correct," Walter said. "I came to see that remarkable performance of
yours. I was very much interested, and I must congratulate you warmly. At the
same time, it seems to me that yours is a dangerous kind of entertainment."</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile flickered over Silva's face. "There is no danger
whatever," he murmured; "anybody could do it if they had arms like mine."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you don't quite take my meaning," Walter murmured. "There are
some cigarettes by your elbow. You had better help yourself, especially as I am
likely to detain you some time."</p>
<p>With a defiant air the Italian took and lighted a cigarette. He did not
appear in the least unnerved, though the furtive glances which he occasionally
turned in the direction of his captor showed that his mind was not altogether
at ease. He would have given much to know what Lance was driving at. He did not
like to see the other quite so sure of his ground.</p>
<p>"My time is my own," he said. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, your time is mine. But I dare say you will wonder
why I am detaining you like this. To tell you the truth, since your last visit
here&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is not true," Silva cried. "I have never been here before!"</p>
<p>"Why play with me?" Walter asked contemptuously. "It is some days since you
were here last. To refresh your memory, I am alluding to the night when you
came here by way of the ventilator in the dome, and made a murderous attack
upon my uncle, who owes his life to the fact that I was not very far away. It
is no use your denying this, because I am in a position to prove it. I dare say
you congratulated yourself upon the fact that you got dear away. You would
chuckle to think how mystified we all were. Here is a murderous onslaught made
upon a public man in his own studio, from which there is no exit but the door;
and on the night of the strange affair the door was locked. No one but a bird
could have escaped through the ventilator. You can picture to yourself what a
sensation the business would have caused if the police had been called in and
the affair made known to the Press. Now I dare say you wonder why the police
were not called in at once?"</p>
<p>Silva pulled at his cigarette savagely, but made no reply.</p>
<p>"Well, I am going to be more polite than you are," Walter said; "and I am
going to tell you. I had a fancy to play the detective myself. I looked around
for some sort of a clue, and at length I found one. Ah, I see you are
interested."</p>
<p>"Only in my own safety," Silva muttered.</p>
<p>"Well, that is the same thing. On the floor close by where you are seated I
found a shabby yellow playbill, advertising the performance of Valdo, the
flying man, at the Imperial Palace Theatre. The bill was neatly folded, and was
of recent date. Now I know perfectly well that neither Lord Ravenspur nor any
of his friends would be interested in that kind of thing. Therefore, how did
the bill get here? Probably left by the flying man himself, and a flying man
would be the only kind of human being capable of getting in and out of this
studio in that mysterious fashion. Upon this, I made up my mind to come and see
you, and I did. I have only to place this information, together with my
testimony, in the hands of the police. Indeed, I have only to send for a
constable now and give you into custody. After that you would not be likely to
give us any cause for anxiety the next seven years."</p>
<p>The Italian's eyes gleamed as he glanced restlessly about him. There was no
reason for Walter to ask himself if his prisoner understood. Silva shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>"That is what you are going to do?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll come to that presently. In the meantime, I want a little
information. You will remember when we were talking to you in the manager's
room at the Imperial, a lady came in and addressed a few words to you.</p>
<p>She was only there for a moment, but she stayed quite long enough for me to
recognise her features. I want to know what Mrs. Delahay needed to see you
for."</p>
<p>A sharp laugh broke from Silva's lips.</p>
<p>"You are very clever," he sneered. "Oh, so clever. So you are interested in
Mrs. Delahay? You think, perhaps, that I know a deal about the murder of her
husband. I know less about it than you do, and I have no concern with her at
all. You had better ask her. She will probably be astonished&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, I see what you mean," Walter exclaimed. "It was stupid of me not to
grasp the problem sooner. Of course, it was not Mrs. Delahay at all I saw with
you, but her sister, Countess Flavio."</p>
<p>Something like an oath broke from Silva's lips.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," Walter said. "You could not tell me any more if you
were ever so candid. And now I know exactly what brings you here. It is not
robbery&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Robbery!" Silva broke out vehemently. "Sir, your words are a deadly insult.
I am an honest man, though I may only be a servant; I would scorn to touch what
does not belong to me."</p>
<p>"In that case you came here for violence, then," Walter said. "Yours must be
a strangely illogical mind. You would not soil your hands with another man's
money, but you would not hesitate to stab him in the back under cover of the
darkness. Come, don't let us argue any longer. You came here the other night to
murder my uncle. But for a fortunate chance. Lord Ravenspur would be in his
grave now. It is useless to deny it."</p>
<p>"Have I made any attempt to deny it?" Silva said, in a voice that was
utterly devoid of passion. "Have I lied to you in any way? Oh! I see there is
no mercy in your face, and doubtless if our positions were reversed, I should
act as you are acting to-night. You are going to hand me over to the
authorities. I shall be no worse treated if I tell the truth. I did come here
to take Lord Ravenspur's life. I am only sorry that I failed&mdash;"</p>
<h2><a id="chap26" name="chap26">XXVI - A FAITHFUL SERVANT</a></h2>
<p>THE words were uttered with a grim coldness that caused Walter to shiver.
This was worse than any outbreak of fury, worse than homicidal mania in its
most acute form. The man was sane enough beyond all doubt, but, at the same
time, he was a fanatic, prepared to gratify his vengeance, even if his own life
paid the penalty.</p>
<p>"Well, that is candid, at any rate," Walter said. "You came here prepared to
take my uncle's life. It was the second attempt that you made upon it. Oh, you
know what I mean. You mistook a guest who was coming here for Lord
Ravenspur&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That was a mistake," Silva said coolly. "It was a mistake that I realised
just in time. I should have greatly regretted any harm happening to an innocent
party."</p>
<p>"I suppose it would have quite upset you," Walter said sarcastically. "But
we are wandering from the point. What is the grudge you have against my uncle?
You have never even seen him till quite lately. He has been an utter stranger
to you."</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile flickered over Silva's face.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose I shall be able to make you understand," he said. "Your
race is different to mine. The blood in your veins flows much slower and
colder. You have no traditions in this country which are part of your religion.
You cannot comprehend that it is one's duty to avenge insult and outrage, even
at the cost of a life. In my part of the world a man would be held a coward who
hesitated to retrieve his honour in such a fashion. But in this case it was not
my honour, but the honour of the noble house to which I belonged. It would have
been bad enough if the thing had been done by one of my own countrymen, but a
stranger, like Lord Ravenspur&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I fail to see the distinction," Walter murmured.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is because you cannot understand. Look you here, signor. I have a
mistress to whom I am devotedly attached. I would lay down my life for her. I
would do anything to shield her from pain. Let us say that my mistress is
married to a man who outwardly possesses all the graces that Nature can bestow.
He has the intellectual gifts, too. He is widely beloved and popular wherever
he goes. But at heart he is a fiend. The refined cruelties which he uses
towards his wife arouse revengeful feelings in my breast, though I dare not
gratify them, in case I perish, and leave my beloved mistress in a worse case
than ever. But there are others of my clan also serving the noble house from
which my mistress came, and they write the Count the letter. You don't know
what that means, and I am not going to tell you. But it is the death-warrant,
and the Count knows it. He cannot appeal against that. All the forces of the
Crown cannot save his life. And then, mysteriously, he dies. But he does not
die before he has done one last piece of irreparable mischief. He sees a way to
strike his wife to the heart from the other side of the grave. There is a
child, perhaps the only thing on earth that the Count loves purely and
sincerely. He gets his friend. Lord Ravenspur, to kidnap that child. I tell you
if his lordship had come amongst us and dishonoured the threshold of the
greatest chief in South Italy he could not have unlocked the floodgates of
vengeance in a more thorough manner. Think of the degradation, the bitter
insult of it all! If the true facts of the case had been known to me at the
time, Lord Ravenspur would have been a dead man years ago. But when my mistress
vanished from the world, I naturally thought that she had taken the child with
her. I did not know until quite recently what had happened. Then when I cast my
mind back to the past I had no difficulty in fixing upon Lord Ravenspur as the
culprit. The rest you know."</p>
<p>The words were quietly and evenly spoken, but the deep ring of sincerity in
them was not lost upon Walter Lance. Here was a man who saw his way clearly
before him, a man blinded by prejudice and bigotry, who would not hesitate for
a single moment, who would laugh contemptuously at the mere suggestion of
personal danger.</p>
<p>"What could you do afterwards?" Walter urged.</p>
<p>Silva shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Why go into that?" he said. "The honour of the house would be avenged. I
should have done my duty, and have earned the approbation of my friends. There
would be a great outcry, no doubt. The thing would be inquired into, and
probably the child I speak of would have been restored to her mother, though,
to be sure, I am not quite certain whether the Countess is a proper
person&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So you have your doubts on that score?" Walter cried eagerly. "Now k it not
a fact that the Countess Flavio was notoriously a woman of evil
disposition?"</p>
<p>"Everybody said so," Silva replied. "Had I chosen, I might have thrown a
different light upon it. Mind you, I am not pleased with my late mistress; but
there were excuses plausible enough. I cannot forget that it was a horrible
thing for a mother to go off and leave her only child all those years. Still,
that is no matter. If the time ever came, I could show the world something
which would open their eyes as to the doings in his lifetime of Count Flavio.
He kept a diary. After his death I found that diary."</p>
<p>"And you did not produce it at the trial?"</p>
<p>"To what good, signor? Popular prejudice was so strong against us that,
beyond doubt, the prosecution would have proved that diary to be a forgery.
Then I should have been cast into prison, and my mistress would have been
deprived of the one protector whom she so sorely needed. Why, feeling ran so
high at the time of the trial that it was dangerous for me to walk the streets
alone at night. But why discuss this now? Why continue this unnecessary
conversation? You have made up your mind what to do. You have only to ring the
bell, and there is an end of me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Silva paused and shrugged his shoulders significantly. He rose as if to take
another cigarette. The box slipped from his hand, and some of the little white
tubes rolled across the polished floor. With an apology for his clumsiness, he
stooped to pick them up. Then he rose again, his right hand shot out in the
direction of a figure in armour, grasping a huge battle-axe in its hand. With
the swiftness of an animal, the battle-axe was snatched away, and before Walter
could realise what had happened, the Italian had smashed a couple of the heavy
plate-glass sheets, thus clearing a way into the garden. Walter yelled at the
top of his voice and darted forward, but he was too late. He realised the folly
of a search in the darkness. No doubt, by this time the man was far away. He
opened the studio door, which closed suddenly behind him, owing to a draught
which came streaming through the broken panes. He saw Lord Ravenspur standing
before him in the corridor, with a white face and agitated manner.</p>
<p>"What is it, Walter?" the latter asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you presently," Walter said. "Only you must get the women-kind
away first. It is quite imperative that Vera should know nothing, though it
doesn't in the least matter in Mrs. Delahay's case. She knows all about
it."</p>
<p>Mrs. Delahay, followed by Vera, was in the corridor by this time. The girl's
face was pale. There was an inquiring look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"It is really nothing," Walter said. "Just a little accident on the polished
floor of the studio. One of the servants will have to sleep in there to-night
in case of intruders. It is a great pity we haven't got one of the dogs from
uncle's place in Hampshire."</p>
<p>"It is terribly late," Mrs. Delahay exclaimed, with a significant glance in
Walter's direction. "Really, I ought to be back at my hotel long ago. I suppose
I can find a cab?"</p>
<p>"I will go and find one for you," Walter said. "Hadn't you better go to bed,
Vera? Don't forget that you are likely to be up very late to-morrow night."</p>
<p>Very few words sufficed to tell Mrs. Delahay what had happened.</p>
<p>Walter saw her into a cab, after which he returned to the house. He was
relieved to find that Vera had already retired. Lord Ravenspur was walking
moodily up and dawn the library.</p>
<p>"One of the grooms is going to sleep in the studio," he said. "We can get
the damage repaired to-morrow. And now tell me everything. I am certain that
you have something unpleasant to disclose."</p>
<p>Walter told his story at some length. Lord Ravenspur followed with every
sign of interest.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can quite understand that man's point of view," he said. "You see, I
know something about those people. When I was quite a young man I spent a year
or two in Corsica, and, to a certain extent, I sympathise with them. I have
committed an outrage on the national honour, and I am to pay the penalty with
my life. The thing is recognised out there. It is regarded as quite
commonplace."</p>
<p>"And there is no way of clearing yourself?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps there is one," Ravenspur said thoughtfully. "You see, the
head of the family can interfere.</p>
<p>Vera's mother is in a position to say But what am I</p>
<p>talking about? My dear boy, my life is in danger, and I am afraid that even
if we lay Silva by the heels there will be others. But, come what may, I am
going to ask for no clemency. Come what may, Vera shall never pass into the
custody of that vile woman whom she has the misfortune to call her mother.
Nothing shall induce me to change my mind. Indeed, such a thing would be a
violation of my promise to the dead."</p>
<p>"Your sentiments do you honour," Walter said; "but, unhappily, I don't see
bow you can carry them out"</p>
<h2><a id="chap27" name="chap27">XXVII - FLIGHT!</a></h2>
<p>IT was a long time before Lord Ravenspur replied. He paced up and down the
studio immersed in his own gloomy thoughts. Then gradually his face cleared,
his eyes flashed with resolution.</p>
<p>"I begin to see my way," he said. "It is not for my sake, but that of the
child. I hope you will believe me when I say I am no coward. If it were six
months hence I could laugh at the danger, because, whatever happened to me, I
should have succeeded in my purpose. In six months' time Vera will be of age.
At the expiration of that period she can become a naturalized British subject.
Then the Crown will look after her interests, and see that the estates which
she will some day inherit are properly administered. Six months hence Vera will
be her own mistress. She has already been informed what her mother is like, and
she will know how to behave towards that woman. It will be a satisfaction for
me to know that we have satisfied those bloodthirsty wretches after all."</p>
<p>"And in the meantime?" Walter asked. "Don't you think we should have Silva
arrested, so that at any rate we should be safe as far as he is concerned? We
could easily find him."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Ravenspur said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I know my enemy by sight, which you will admit is a very great advantage.
If another assassin comes along, he will have a tremendous pull over me.
Besides, you made a suggestion just now which gave me a brilliant idea. You
said that it was a pity we hadn't got the dogs here. We will have a couple of
bloodhounds up the first thing in the morning, and one of them shall sleep in
my bed-room, the other in the studio. The hounds are not in the least dangerous
to those who know them. But I pity the midnight intruder who comes along and
gets introduced to one of them. That will be one way of protecting myself for a
time, and it will give the scoundrels something to do to devise fresh means of
putting an end to me. I have thought it all out, and the best thing we can do
is to disappear."</p>
<p>"Disappear!" Walter cried. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean exactly what I say. The thing can be done to-morrow night. There is
nothing easier."</p>
<p>"But to-morrow night we are going to Lady Ringmar's great reception," Walter
urged. "I understand that it is to be one of the biggest things of the season,
and I know that Vera is looking forward to it with the greatest possible
pleasure."</p>
<p>"Well, we can go," Ravenspur said, a trifle impatiently. "Now my scheme is
this: we go to Lady Ringmar's, and stay there till about two o'clock in the
morning. We take certain wraps with us, and we leave the house, not in one of
the carriages, but in a hired fly which will subsequently take us to Waterloo
Station. By special train we will go down to Weymouth, and at that point hire a
yacht to convey us to Jersey. There we shall be able to stay a few days, and
settle our plans. The servants can easily get all we want together early
to-morrow morning, and send the bags down to Weymouth as luggage in advance.
The next day the papers will contain the information that Lord Ravenspur has
suddenly been attacked with a mysterious illness, and that he has been ordered
to leave London at once. As perfect rest and quietness are prescribed, he is
keeping his address a secret, and has given strict orders that no communication
of any kind is to be forwarded. Even the servants in Park Lane will profess not
to know where we have gone, which will be nothing less than the truth. How does
the idea strike you?"</p>
<p>Walter murmured something in reply. As a matter of fact, he was not in the
least in love with the scheme, though Lord Ravenspur appeared to be so eager
and happy about it, that he had not the heart to throw cold water on the
programme. From his more youthful point of view, the idea of flight seemed
cowardly. He would have placed the matter in the hands of the police. He would
not have shrunk from the utmost publicity. But still, there was Vera to be
considered. The girl's future was of the first importance.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said, "I will give up my time tomorrow to getting ready. I
suppose now that you won't want me to telegraph to the Hampshire place for the
dogs?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I think you had better," Ravenspur said. "One never knows what may turn
up. And there is always the chance of the secret being discovered. And now let
us go to bed, and try to get some sleep. I haven't had a night's rest for a
week. I am longing to find myself on board a yacht again. I shall be safe there
at all events. Good-night, my boy."</p>
<p>It was after lunch the following day that Vera came into the billiard-room
in search of Walter. The latter had practically finished his preparations. He
had done everything that his uncle had entrusted to him, and there was nothing
now but to wait the turn of events. In a well-regulated establishment like that
of Lord Ravenspur's, everything had proceeded smoothly enough. By luncheon time
the whole of the boxes and portmanteaux had been packed, and the luggage
despatched. Still, there was a perplexed look in Vera's eyes as she came into
the billiard-room.</p>
<p>"I have been looking for you everywhere, Walter," she said. "I want to know
what is the meaning of all this mystery. I have seen enough baggage leave the
house to supply us with all we want for a season in Scotland. When I asked my
maid what she was doing, she simply said that she had been instructed by the
housekeeper to get my things ready. Of course, I raised no objection, but I
should certainly like to know what it all means."</p>
<p>Walter looked a trifle embarrassed. He had quite forgotten that Vera might
show a natural curiosity.</p>
<p>We are going away for a little time," he explained. The fact of the matter
is, your guardian has not been at all well lately. But you must have noticed
that for yourself. He has had a great deal to try him, too, and he is afraid of
a breakdown. We are going to Weymouth direct from Lord Ringmar's House, and not
a soul is to know anything about it. You see, if we stay and make elaborate
preparations, it will take quite a week to make a start. It is far better to
let people know afterwards that Lord Ravenspur has been ordered away
peremptorily, and that he is to have perfect rest for the next month or so.
Only I can't sufficiently impress upon you the necessity of keeping this thing
absolutely secret."</p>
<p>"Even from Lady Ringmar?" Vera cried.</p>
<p>"From everybody," Walter said, somewhat sternly. "Vera, your guardian is in
great danger. You are in great danger yourself. I dare not tell you more now,
but perhaps I shall be permitted to say it later on. Go about your business or
pleasure to-day just as if nothing had happened."</p>
<p>Vera asked no further questions. She was perhaps just a little hurt that
Walter had refused to take her into his confidence. At the same time, she was
young and vigorous, and the thought of a change was not displeasing. She passed
out of the house presently with a view to a walk in the park. She stopped
before a feeble, blind old man who was dolefully grinding out hymns on a
dilapidated organ. A boy of some ten or twelve years was guiding the
unfortunate man along the pavement. Vera took out her purse, and placed a
shilling in the little tin cup which the boy was carrying.</p>
<p>"I have not seen you here before," she said kindly.</p>
<p>The man murmured something to the effect that this was his first day with
the organ. He seemed uneasy and undecided in his manner, and, naturally enough.
Vera put this down to the strangeness of his surroundings. Then she hastened on
to the park, and the little incident passed from her mind. She had tea
subsequently with a friend in Grosvenor Square, and when she came back, barely
in time to dress for dinner, she saw that the blind man was still in the Lane,
grinding industriously at his melancholy airs.</p>
<p>"I suppose Walter has told you," Ravenspur said as they sat down to dinner.
"You know where we are going?"</p>
<p>"He told me part," Vera said. "Really, I don't quite understand what all
this mystery means."</p>
<p>"Indeed, it is absolutely necessary," Ravenspur said gravely. "It is as
necessary for your happiness as it is for mine. I have done my best to
safeguard your welfare&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes," Vera cried contritely. "I am a most ungrateful girl to speak
in that way. After all, I am looking forward to the trip. It is probably the
last happy time we shall have together. Yes; I have quite made up my mind to
get my own living. But we won't discuss that to-night."</p>
<p>Dinner was over at length and the carriage was ordered round. Vera came
downstairs presently; her cheeks were flushed, her eyes were sparkling. She was
very alluring and attractive in her white dress. She had made up her mind to be
absolutely happy to-night. The dress was a special present from Lord Ravenspur,
and Vera had been afraid to ask what the Paris house had charged for it. Still,
it was the last extravagance she was going to put Lord Ravenspur to.</p>
<p>"I declare there is my old blind man still," she said, as she got into the
carriage. "He must have been here all day. I must make inquiries, and see what
I can do for him."</p>
<p>The door of the carriage was banged to, and the horses trotted away. As they
passed the spot where the blind man was standing he suddenly ceased his doleful
airs and whistled softly. A moment later and a shabby figure came shuffling
down the Lane.</p>
<p>"That's right, Stevens," the blind man said in a quick, clear voice. "Now
here's the note, and, mind, you are not to deliver it before half-past twelve.
This is most important. If you are successful, come back to me at the appointed
spot, and I will see that you get your money&mdash;fifty pounds."</p>
<h2><a id="chap28" name="chap28">XXVIII - VERA'S WARNING</a></h2>
<p>AMONGST her many friends, and in the keen enjoyment of the evening. Vera
forgot her fears. She was young enough to appreciate to the full the joys of
life. She was strong and vigorous, and most things pleased her. Besides, there
was always the reflection that the gates would be closed to her before long.
Once she had taken her fate in her own hands, and had gone into the world to
get her living, there would be no more of this. A little longer and she would
say good-bye to Lord Ravenspur and Walter. Of course, the wrench would be a
bitter one, for she was by no means blind to the hardships and privations of
the poor.</p>
<p>Still, she put that out of her mind now. She was going to have a very
pleasant evening, and by this time to-morrow she would be far away from the
heat and dust and bustle of London. In her mind's eye she could see the yacht
sliding over the water. She could see the moon shining on the waves, and
turning their crests to molten silver.</p>
<p>The big house was crowded to its utmost capacity, for Lady Ringmar was one
of the most prominent of society women, and invitations to her entertainments
were eagerly sought after. The rooms were filled. At the end of the long
corridor Vera caught a peep of the garden, all aglow with points of flame from
the electric lights entwined about the trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>An hour or so passed pleasantly enough; then, as the heat grew more intense
Vera's mind turned to the garden. There were huge blocks of ice, looking
deliciously cool, behind banks of ferns. The air hummed with the noise of
electric fans, and yet the atmosphere was heavy and enervating. Supper was a
thing of the past, and Vera stood at the head of a flight of marble steps,
which led to the garden. She was quite alone. She was looking for Walter, whom
she had not seen for some little time. She turned with a smile as someone
murmured her name. She saw that it was Ravenspur's friend. Sir James Seton, who
was standing by her side.</p>
<p>"So you are all alone," he said. "What are those young men thinking about?
It was very different in my day."</p>
<p>Vera smiled somewhat faintly. She had every respect for Sir James. He was
kindly disposed enough, but in the eyes of youth he was regarded as something
of a bore. There was no help for it when he suggested a turn in the garden.</p>
<p>"Certainly," Vera murmured; "only I don't want to walk far. I have enjoyed
my first season in town immensely, but I am beginning to long for the fresh air
in the country Again."</p>
<p>"Quite right," Sir James agreed; "just the same with me. Why people box
themselves up in London during the most beautiful months in the year I can't
imagine. They talk about England being a decadent country! A man wants a real
stamina to struggle through the three months which we call the season. Some of
these men are a perfect marvel to me. Take Ravenspur, for example. That man
works as hard as any man in England. He is here, there, and everywhere, and yet
he finds plenty of time for this sort of thing, too. If there is anybody I
envy, it is Ravenspur."</p>
<p>"I am sure you have no need to envy anybody," Vera laughed. "Besides, in
many ways you are very like him. Most people see a strong resemblance between
you two."</p>
<p>Sir James chuckled as if well pleased with the compliment.</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?" he asked eagerly. "Well, I suppose what everybody
says is bound to be true. At the same time, these resemblances are not always
desirable. For instance, look what happened to me only the other day."</p>
<p>"And what was that?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"Don't you know? It was the last time I dined with your guardian. Didn't
they tell you about it? It reminded me of the days when I was a
soldier&mdash;quite an adventure, too, I assure you. I was coming up Cheyne
Row, more or less in the darkness, when a man darted out of the shadows, and
attacked me. I had some difficulty in beating him off. I don't know whether the
man was mad or not, but his intentions were quite serious."</p>
<p>"Really!" Vera exclaimed, with widely opened eyes. "And what became of the
man? Was he locked up?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he got away before I could do anything. Still, it was very unpleasant
while it lasted, I assure you."</p>
<p>"It must have been," Vera said thoughtfully. "But, my dear Sir James, I
don't quite understand what this adventure has to do with your likeness to Lord
Ravenspur."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, I had almost forgotten that. You see, when the fellow rushed at
me, he addressed me as Ravenspur, just as the hero of the melodrama addresses
the villain when he is caught in the last act. There is not the slightest doubt
that I was mistaken for your guardian. Indeed, as soon as the man realised his
mistake, he drew off at once. I am rather surprised they did not tell you."</p>
<p>Vera was listening uneasily enough now. In the ordinary course of events she
would have heard all about that mysterious occurrence. Why had they kept the
knowledge from her? As she sat there thinking the matter over, she began in her
mind to piece events together. So this sudden flight from London was dictated
by personal fear on the part of Lord Ravenspur. He wanted to get away from this
relentless foe. There was no other way to safeguard himself than by this
yachting cruise. And hitherto Vera had never detected in her guardian the
slightest sign of nervousness or fear. This foe, then, must be a man of
extraordinary determination and tenacity of purpose.</p>
<p>Vera could see it all more clearly now. She recollected the disturbance in
the conservatory on the night of Sir James Seton's visit to Park Lane. She
recollected with even more significant force the cries and the shattering of
glass in the conservatory the previous evening. And why, for the first time in
his life, had Lord Ravenspur caused the bloodhounds to be brought up from
Hampshire? All these questions Vera asked herself but she could think of no
reply. In some vague way her woman's instinct told her that she was mixed up in
the business. If so, it would never do for her to desert Lord Ravenspur at this
critical moment She would have to stay by him until the danger was past.</p>
<p>She sat there, replying to the chattering remarks of her companion at
random, until even he saw how preoccupied she was.</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are not quite yourself to-night," he said.</p>
<p>"I am sure I beg your pardon," Vera murmured. "I am not quite myself. I wish
you would do me a favour, Sir James. Would you mind finding Walter and sending
him in me?"</p>
<p>Sir James trotted off obediently enough, and presently Walter came along. He
looked somewhat warm and heated.</p>
<p>"I am sorry I couldn't find you before," he said. "We have been having a bit
of fun in the drawing-room. It was rather a nuisance, too. What do you think
happened? But you will never guess. One of the dogs got away and actually
followed us here. I found three or four ladies held up by one of the brutes in
a drawing-room. They were frightened to death, not knowing what a peaceful
creature poor Bruno is in the ordinary way. I had to lead him away and tie him
up to one of the trees in the shrubbery."</p>
<p>Vera smiled as she thought of the terror which the great hound would
naturally inspire. No doubt he had managed to get away from Park Lane and had
tracked them to Lady Ringmar's house.</p>
<p>"He will be quite quiet where he is," she said, "and we can take him with us
when we go. I shall be glad to get away. I am longing to leave London behind me
now."</p>
<p>Walter looked anxiously at his companion. He saw how pale and disturbed she
was, how distressed her features were.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" he asked tenderly.</p>
<p>"I was going to tell you," Vera replied. "I have had a considerable shock
to-night. I have learnt something which you tried to conceal from me. Oh, I am
not blaming you, because I am sure you only acted for the best, but I have just
been having a conversation with Sir James Seton, and he was telling me all
about the attack that was made on him the other night when he came to dine with
us. I was dreadfully grieved to hear what he had to say."</p>
<p>"But, my dear girl," Walter protested, "really&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know. You are thinking about me now," Vera said. "But it is
rather too late. That murderous attack was made upon Sir James Seton because
the miscreant mistook him for Lord Ravenspur. There can be no doubt about it,
because Sir James told me so. And when I heard that, other strange circumstance
flashed into my mind. For instance, those two mysterious occurrences in the
studio. Now, tell me honestly, Walter, is the danger really great?"</p>
<p>Walter hesitated a moment before he replied.</p>
<p>"I am very much afraid it is," he said presently. "It is all a question of
time. And you must not regard Lord Ravenspur as a coward, because he is nothing
of the kind. I am certain that he is acting in your very best
interests&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah! I thought I was at the bottom of it somewhere," Vera cried, as Walter
bit his lip. "I was absolutely convinced of it. Oh, I know I couldn't tell you
why, except that my instinct warns me. But am I not to know, Walter? Am I to go
on being treated as a child? You have both been very good to me, and the mere
suggestion that I am a danger and a burden to you fills me with pain. Won't you
take me into your confidence? I am no longer a child."</p>
<h2><a id="chap29" name="chap29">XXIX - THE MESSAGE</a></h2>
<p>"IF the secret were only my own I would not hesitate a moment," Walter said.
"Be patient a little longer, my dearest girl. I am quite sure that Ravenspur
will tell you when the proper time comes. Once we are on board the yacht there
will be no occasion for further secrecy. Another hour, and we shall be on our
way. I am not a nervous man, but this thing is beginning to worry me."</p>
<p>Vera persisted no further. The band had just ceased playing, and there was a
sudden rush of guests into the garden, so that there was no opportunity for
further privacy. A somewhat imperious dowager pounced down upon Waiter, with a
request that he would find her daughter, and there was nothing for it but to
obey. Just for a moment Vera stood in the midst of a laughing, chattering group
of friends, then she managed to slip away unseen. She wanted to be alone and
think this matter out.</p>
<p>She was just a little hurt that the others had not taken her into their
confidence. Still, perhaps Lord Ravenspur had acted in this way to save her
pain and annoyance. He had always been kind and considerate to her. She owed
him a deep debt of gratitude. And yet, up to a few moments ago, she had been
prepared to turn her back upon her best friends and face the world alone. But
she could not do that now. She would have to abandon her plans for the future.
She would have to stay by Lord Ravenspur's side until this terrible danger was
past. She was only a girl, and could not do much. Still, that little she would
do cheerfully.</p>
<p>Vera was still busy with these painful thoughts when a footman came up and
spoke to her. He had a note on a tray, which he handed to Vera, with the
intimation that there was no reply. So far as Vera could tell, the handwriting
was quite strange to her.</p>
<p>"Who brought this?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"It was left by some strange man, miss," the servant said. "I was to give it
to you at once, when you were alone, if possible."</p>
<p>The footman's manner was perfectly respectful. He discreetly said nothing of
the sovereign which had accompanied the letter. Vera turned away and broke the
seal. She was in a somewhat secluded part of the garden now, but she had no
difficulty in reading the letter with the aid of the sparkling points of flame
which glimmered from the branches of the overhanging trees.</p>
<p>"<i>My dear child</i> (the letter ran),</p>
<p class="letter">I want you to read this alone. I want you to promise me that
it shall be shown to nobody. I daresay you will wonder why I write like this,
after all these years, but I can only plead that circumstances, not myself, are
alone to blame. I want you to believe that up till quite recently I was hardly
aware of your existence. But all these things I can explain when we meet.
Naturally you will ask yourself who I am, and why I should venture to address
you in this fashion. You will see presently.</p>
<p class="letter">For the last eighteen years you have dwelt under the roof of
Lord Ravenspur. You have passed as his ward, and I understand that he has taken
the greatest care of you. This much goes to his credit. But that he behaved
like a scoundrel at the outset I am prepared to prove. Had it not been for him
we should not have been parted all these years, and you would have had a better
chance of making the acquaintance of your most unhappy mother.</p>
<p class="letter">There, I have told the truth at length, and now you are aware
who it is that thus addresses you. When we meet I shall be able to explain why
I did nothing all these years&mdash;but I am wasting time. I know that you are
going away to-night. I know that you may be out of London for some months. At
present, circumstances do not permit me to claim my rights, or to interfere
with your plans. You will go away this evening just as if nothing had happened,
but before you go it is most imperative that I should see you, if only for half
an hour. I have had this letter sent you by a trusty friend, who will not fail
me. If you will go through the shrubbery at the back, to Lady Ringmar's house,
you will find a pathway bordered with nut trees, which ends in a green gate,
leading to the lane at the back of the house. There you will find another
friend, who will bring you to me without delay. I give you my word I will not
detain you more than half an hour. Then you can return to your friends as if
nothing had happened. They will be none the wiser. Indeed, I will ask not to
mention this letter to them at all.</p>
<p class="letter">I am not going to anticipate your refusal, for I know that
you will come, especially when I sign myself</p>
<p class="letter">Your unhappy mother,</p>
<p class="letter">CARLOTTA FLAVIO.</p>
<p>In a state of mind bordering on absolute bewilderment. Vera read the letter
again and again. It filled her with a pain which was closely akin to shame. So
far as she could see, there was no mistaking the relationship which at one time
had existed between the writer of the letter and Lord Ravenspur. A natural
craving and desire to see her mother came over Vera. She knew there was yet
time to get away from Lady Ringmar's house and back again before the hour fixed
for their departure. Vera slipped the letter inside her dress, and with a firm,
determined step strode off in the direction of the shrubbery. She came
presently to the spot indicated in the letter. She looked eagerly around to see
if anybody awaited her. There was the faint suggestion of cigarette smoke
lingering in the air, and then, from a turn in the path, the figure of a man
emerged. Vera could see that he was exceedingly well turned out in evening
dress. The dust coat he was wearing only partially concealed a slim built,
athletic figure. For the rest, the man was good looking enough, and Vera judged
from his dark eyes and black moustache that he was a foreigner, doubtless some
relation of her mother. He lifted his hat with great courtesy, and waited for
the girl to speak.</p>
<p>"I am Vera Rayne," she said quite simply.</p>
<p>I am already aware of that," the stranger replied. I suppose you received
the Countess's letter? But you must have done so, otherwise you would not be
here. You are prepared&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment," Vera said. Caution had suddenly returned to her, and there was
something in the eager light in the man's eyes now that warned her to be
careful.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad if you will let me know who you are. What is your name, for
instance?"</p>
<p>The gleam in the stranger's eyes deepened in intensity, a quick frown
knitted his brows.</p>
<p>"Can it in the least matter?" he demanded. "You have received the letter,
and it is only for you to obey."</p>
<p>There was a peremptory ring in the speech which Vera did not like at all.
She realised that she was in a lonely part of the grounds, and that, in case of
need, assistance was a long way off. She began to wish that she had been more
prudent. After all, the whole thing might be a plot against her happiness, a
scheme into which she had fallen without asking herself a single question.
These doubts became something like certainties when the stranger strode past
her and cut off all means of retreat.</p>
<p>"You are wasting my time," he said, "and time is precious to-night. It is
only a matter of half an hour altogether, and then you will be back with your
friends once more. If I were not anxious for your welfare do you suppose I
would be here at all?"</p>
<p>The speaker's English was good enough, but Vera did not fail to detect the
foreign accent behind it. She was becoming afraid now. Her heart was beating
faster. She turned to see if assistance might not be at hand. But the thick
belts of shrubs cut off all sounds. She could hear absolutely nothing in the
direction of the house. And then there was another cause for fear. Surely she
could hear something creeping stealthily through the bushes. She listened
again, and the footsteps seemed to grow closer. Then the bushes parted, and a
great black head and a pair of gleaming eyes emerged, followed by a long, heavy
body that crept up to Vera's side and rubbed against her dress. A cry of
thankfulness escaped her.</p>
<p>"Bruno!" she panted. "How did you get here?"</p>
<p>Then she remembered the dog had followed them from Park Lane. He had been
tied up by Walter in the shrubbery, and the broken cord attached to his collar
told the rest of the story. The great hound lifted his head. The glittering
amber-coloured eyes were turned on the stranger, and a deep growl came from the
depths of the dog's throat. The small man in evening dress stepped back.</p>
<p>"That dog is very dangerous," he stammered.</p>
<p>"Not while I am here," Vera said coldly, "though, perhaps if he met you here
alone you might have cause for uneasiness. And now, sir, will you be so good as
to tell me your name?"</p>
<p>"Amati," the stranger said sullenly. "But what does it matter? You have made
up your mind by this time whether you are coming with me or not. You know
perfectly well, from the letter in "your possession, that I am a messenger from
your mother. I have a cab outside the lane, and I can take you to her at once.
I pledge you my word that you shall be back in half an hour."</p>
<p>Still Vera hesitated. Still her suspicions refused to be lulled.</p>
<p>"It would be an easy matter for my mother to have come here," she said.
"There is not the slightest chance of being interrupted. And seeing that time
is so short&mdash;"</p>
<p>The last words were inaudible, for there was a shrill whistle somewhere in
the garden, and the dog by Vera's side whined uneasily. As Vera stooped to
soothe him she twisted her handkerchief in the hound's collar. She recognised
the whistle as Walter's. Then she gave a sign and the great beast bounded
away.</p>
<h2><a id="chap30" name="chap30">XXX - LOST</a></h2>
<p>A PECULIAR grim smile came over the face of the man who called himself
Amati. He hesitated no longer, but with a single bound had reached Vera's side,
his arm was around her neck and his right hand pressed to her lips before she
could utter a sound.</p>
<p>"Be silent," he hissed, "and all will be well with you. Believe me, I wish
to do you no harm. You are quite safe with me."</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to stand there obedient to the speaker's will.
Then, from his lips, came the sound like that of a bird startled from its nest
in the night. The green door opened, and another man appeared. Almost before
Vera knew what was happening she was half led, half carried through the door
and deposited in a cab. It seemed to her that her senses were fading away, that
there was something peculiarly sweet and faint smelling on the handkerchief
which her assailant had pressed to her lips. The cab drove away swiftly, and
the lane was left in silence once more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the evening was passing on, and Ravenspur was anxiously waiting
for the moment when it would be time to get away. Walter came into the garden
presently, wondering what had become of Vera.</p>
<p>"I have been looking for her, too," Ravenspur said. "That is the worst of a
great crush in a great house like this. It is so difficult to find anybody. We
must be off in a quarter of an hour from now. What is all this I hear about one
of the dogs?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is true enough," Walter laughed. "It was old Bruno. I suppose he
managed to get away from Park Lane. At any rate, he followed us here and I
found him holding up some people in one of the drawing-rooms. I thought he
might just as well come to the station with us, so I tied him up in the
shrubbery. When I went to see if he was all right just now I found the rascal
had got away again. He came back when I whistled, but I couldn't get him to
come to my side. I suppose he was afraid of getting a thrashing. However, he is
lying down quite good in the shrubbery now, so there is no cause for worry. I
daresay that it would be rather alarming for some of these women to be suddenly
confronted with the dog when they were carrying on a tender flirtation in one
of the arbours."</p>
<p>But Lord Ravenspur was not listening. He looked anxious and worried and full
of trouble.</p>
<p>"Oh, Bruno will follow the cab right enough," he said impatiently, "and I
daresay the other dog is at the station by this time. I wish you would go and
find Vera for me. It sounds foolish, I know, but I have an absurd idea that
something may happen just at the last moment. It is always the way when one is
overstrung."</p>
<p>Walter went off on his errand cheerfully enough. The moments passed, but he
did not return, and the feeling of anxiety on Ravenspur's part deepened.
Finally, Walter returned, with a face as anxious as Lord Ravenspur's own. He
caught the latter's arm almost fiercely.</p>
<p>"I begin to think you are right," he whispered. "I cannot find Vera
anywhere. One of her girl friends tells me that she last saw her quite alone
going off in the direction of the pathway behind the shrubbery. That was half
an hour ago. What she could be doing there I haven't the remotest idea."</p>
<p>A smothered groan escaped Ravenspur's lips.</p>
<p>"I had half expected this," he muttered. "Something of the kind was bound to
happen. She has been lured away, or she has been kidnapped. When you come to
think of it, it is quite an easy matter in grounds as large as these. It seems
quite hopeless to try and fight against these scoundrels. Depend upon it, they
have found out our plans in some mysterious way, and have taken this step to
thwart them at the last moment. But how did they manage, how could they have
communicated with Vera? And what extraordinary allurement did they hold out to
her to induce her to go off with strangers in this way? Oh, the thing is
maddening!"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Walter exclaimed. "I only know that we are wasting time, and
very precious time at that. Now, let me see, what would be the most likely
thing to appeal to the sentiments of a young girl like Vera." I should say
something to do with her mother. That, you may depend upon it&mdash;a letter
from her mother. We can very soon see whether my suspicions are right or not.
I'll go out into the hall at once and interview the footmen."</p>
<p>A group of idle, lounging footmen were loafing in the hall. Walter went
straight to the point.</p>
<p>"Which of you gave Miss Rayne a letter just now?" he demanded. "And who
brought it? Come, speak out!"</p>
<p>The strong, determined voice was not without its effect. One of the footmen
came forward and murmured that he had taken the letter and delivered it to
Vera.</p>
<p>It was about half an hour ago, sir," he explained. No, I don't know the man
who brought it. He looked like a small tradesman, or respectable clerk. All he
told me was to give the letter to Miss Rayne and see that she had it at
once."</p>
<p>"And you were to give it to her when she was alone?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, sir," the man admitted. "The messenger did say that. You see,
there was nothing strange&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, of course not," Walter said impatiently. "You were to give it to Miss
Rayne when she was alone, and you had a handsome tip for your pains. Was not
that so?"</p>
<p>The man's face testified to the fact that Walter's shot had hit the mark,
but the latter did not remain there a single moment longer. He had not lost
sight of the fact that a cross-examination of a servant would probably have led
to a deal of idle gossip, in which Vera's name would have been mixed up; and
besides, the footman was obviously an innocent party, and had told everything
that he knew in connection with the letter and its delivery.</p>
<p>"It is just as you feared," Walter said, when he reached Ravenspur's side.
"A respectably-dressed man came here half an hour ago and left a letter for
Vera, which was to be delivered to her when she was alone. The thing was done,
and that is how the mischief began. I feel quite sure that I am right, and that
that letter came, or purported to come, from Vera's mother. The poor child
would naturally go off, thinking no evil. You may depend upon it that that
scoundrel Silva is at the bottom of it all. He cannot strike you in one way, so
he has made up his mind to deal the blow in another direction. There is no time
to be lost."</p>
<p>"But how on earth did they find out our plans?" Ravenspur groaned. "All the
servants are to be trusted."</p>
<p>"I've got it," Walter said suddenly. "Don't you recollect that blind
organ-grinder that Vera was so interested in? He was hanging about Park Lane
all day. Those sort of people have regular beats, and he has never been seen
there before. He saw all that baggage going away, and drew his own conclusions.
It would be an easy matter to have the stuff followed to Waterloo Station, and
find all about the special train from the porters. But what are we going to do?
Are we going to raise an alarm?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," Ravenspur said hoarsely. "Don't let us have any scandal as long
as we can possibly avoid it. I'll go out with you and we'll make another search
of the grounds first. We may find some sort of a clue, and if we do we can
follow it up without anybody being any the wiser. Lady Ringmar will simply
think that we went off without saying good-bye, and there will be an end of the
matter as far as she is concerned. Now come along."</p>
<p>The two slipped out into the grounds again and made a rapid search of the
garden. In the shrubbery they found the great hound, Bruno, patiently waiting
there. Apparently he seemed to think that his time for punishment was past, for
he crept up to Walter's side and rubbed his great, black muzzle against his
knee.</p>
<p>"Here's an inspiration," Walter exclaimed. "If Vera went away at all, she
must have gone by the back gate. We will put Bruno on the scent, and
if&mdash;Hallo, what's this?"</p>
<p>The dainty white cambric, with its fringe of lace, caught Walter's eye. He
withdrew the fragment from under the dog's collar and held it up to one of the
points of electric flame.</p>
<p>"Here is a clue with a vengeance," he exclaimed. "This is Vera's
handkerchief. Depend upon it, this is a signal to us that the dog must have
been with her at the time she went, and she must certainly have gone
voluntarily, or the dog would have made short work of the person with whom Vera
departed. She took this way of letting us know she had gone, and most assuredly
she must have gone by the back gate. What a lucky thing it was that the dog
came here to-night. Let us put him on the scent at once."</p>
<p>"Your suggestion is an inspiration," Ravenspur muttered. "But we can't go
quite like this, you know. Run back to the house and get our coats and hats.
Don't be long."</p>
<p>Walter was back in a minute or two with the wraps. Then he laid his hand on
the dog's collar and led him down the path at the back of the shrubbery. The
great beast appeared to know exactly what was wanted of him, for, after
throwing up his head and giving vent to a long-drawn howl, he placed his muzzle
on the ground and scratched furiously at the door. When the road was reached,
at length, the dog tore along at a furious rate, so that the silk scarf twisted
round his collar tired Walter's arms terribly.</p>
<p>Still, that did not matter, as they were making good progress now. They went
on and on, passing street after street, until the dawn came, and they were in a
distant suburb. Before an attractive-looking house, the blinds and shutters of
which were closely drawn, Bruno paused and threw up his head.</p>
<p>"This is the place right enough," Walter whispered. "Be carefuL If we are
seen everything is spoilt."</p>
<h2><a id="chap31" name="chap31">XXXI - A MISSING LINK</a></h2>
<p>IT was practically daylight now, so that the greatest caution was absolutely
necessary. It was possible to obtain cover behind a group of thorn bushes and
take observations of the house. But even that did not lack risk, all the more
so because of the presence of the dog. The great hound had served his purpose,
and it was essential that he should be got rid of, for the present at any
rate.</p>
<p>The house itself was quite a good one. The grounds were neat and trim. The
flower boxes in the windows ablaze with bloom. The place spoke for itself as
the residence of some prosperous individual who, in all probability, was
somebody of importance in the City. It was the last place in the world to
associate with crime and violence. In front of the house was a fairly large
lawn, shaded by shrubs and trees. A kitchen garden at the back was bounded by a
lane, and on the far side of this stretched a wide open common covered with
gorse and bracken.</p>
<p>"Have you any idea where we are?" Lord Ravenspur asked.</p>
<p>"Not the faintest," Walter confessed. "I have never been here before. The
only thing I am sure of is that Vera is in yonder house. But let us get away
from here and talk it over. The further this thing goes, the more sure I am
that we have foes to deal with who are clever as they are unscrupulous."</p>
<p>"But where shall we go?" Ravenspur asked.</p>
<p>Walter suggested skirting round the back of the house, and so on to the
common. Once there, they found shelter enough, for the gorse was high and the
bracken was deep. Indeed, a raiment of soldiers might have hidden there with
perfect safety.</p>
<p>"I think I begin to see my way," Walter said. "One of us must stay here and
the other get back to London without delay. If you don't mind, I should like to
consult my friend Venables about this business. He is very clever and
courageous, and, besides, he has a decided fondness for detective business. I
think you will agree with me that we want another hand?"</p>
<p>"We want half a dozen," Ravenspur murmured. "What we really ought to do is
to place the matter in the hands of the police and have yonder house searched
at once. Yet, I am very loth to do that. I am exceedingly anxious to prevent
anything like a scandal, and this is the very sort of thing to appeal to the
cheap Press. But what are we going to do about our journey to Weymouth? What
would the officials at Waterloo think when we didn't turn up last night? And,
again, there are all the servants in Park Lane. If you can only show me some
way to stop the mouths of these people I shall be grateful. You know what
servants are."</p>
<p>"I think that can be managed," Walter said after a thoughtful pause. "You
stay here while I go back to London. I will return as soon as possible. Oh, of
course, I will bring a change of clothing with me. It would be madness to hang
about a suburb like this in evening dress. We should be spotted in a
moment."</p>
<p>It seemed to Ravenspur that there was no help for it. Anxious and troubled
and worn out as he was, he could not be altogether blind to the absurdity of
the situation. The idea of a man in his position hiding himself on a London
common, dressed as he was, seemed ridiculous. He had no more than a dust coat
over his evening dress; he was wearing the collar of an Order. Still, as he
looked about him he took fresh heart of grace. The common appeared to be little
frequented. There were deep hollows here and there, full of bracken and
brambles, under which it was possible to hide. There was no prospect of Walter
getting back within the next three hours. There was nothing for it but to make
the best of the situation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walter was hurrying back to London. He made a wide detour of the
common, so that it was not possible for him to be seen from the house. Then
presently he struck a main road on the far side of which ran a railway line. He
could see in the distance the buildings and signals that marked a station. At
any rate, he would be able to find out where he was without displaying his
ignorance by asking questions. It was still quite early, only a little past
five o'clock, as Walter found on consulting his watch. After all said and done,
the station was not much use to him, for probably no train would run within the
next couple of hours. Presently there was a clatter of hoofs behind, and an
empty hansom came along. The sight of the cab was proof to Walter that he was
not very far outside the radius. A happy idea came to him.</p>
<p>"Are you going back to town?" he asked the cabman.</p>
<p>"Well yes, sir," the cabman explained. "I have been taking a fare out to
Cannon Green."</p>
<p>"Then you are just the man for me," Walter exclaimed. "My man has failed to
turn up, and I was going to try the station. I suppose that is Cannon Green
station just at the end of the road?"</p>
<p>"That's right, sir," the cabman said civilly. "But you'll get no train yet.
Drive you anywhere you like, sir, for half-a-sovereign."</p>
<p>Walter jumped into the cab without further hesitation. A ride of a little
over an hour brought him to Park Lane. A sleepy footman opened the door, and
regarded Walter in amazement. He had his story all ready. There had been
misunderstanding on the previous evening, and Lord Ravenspur and Miss Rayne had
gone on to Weymouth by an early train. There was something very paltry about
this deception, but at the same time it seemed to Walter to be absolutely
necessary. He roused his own man; together they packed a couple of
portmanteaux, which Walter gave directions should be taken to Waterloo Station
without delay, and left in the cloakroom. Once he had satisfied the curiosity
of the household in Park Lane, he went on promptly to Venables' rooms. Over a
hasty breakfast he explained everything that had happened to his companion. As
he expected, Venables at once threw himself heart and soul into the
adventure.</p>
<p>I quite understand your point of view," he exclaimed. What you want to do is
to hang about all day and take observations. At the same time, it is absolutely
necessary that we should arouse no suspicions. I think I can see my way. This
is a matter of disguise. We can pick up all we want in this direction in Covent
Garden on our way to the station."</p>
<p>"There is only one thing that worries me," Walter said, "and that is Bruno.
What shall we do with him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Venables cried. "Very well-trained dog, isn't he? So
much the better. You see, in the course of my adventures I have come across
some pretty shady specimens of humanity, though I am bound to say that I have
found many of this class pretty faithful when they are well paid. Now I know a
fellow at Cannon Green who will look after the dog for us for a consideration.
He is a fancier himself, and always has a few animals for sale. What more
natural than that he should have a bloodhound on the premises." Mr. Bill Perks
is more than suspected of being a receiver of stolen goods, and on two
occasions has been in trouble. Still, he knows me, and will do anything I like,
provided I pay him handsomely. Don't let us waste any more time."</p>
<p>An hour later and the two adventurers left the train at Cannon Green,
bearing a set of instruments such as those used by surveyors when they are
planning and laying out new land. Their disguise was slight enough, but quite
suffIcient for the purpose. Both wore smart looking caps, edged with gold, so
that their appearance was sufficiently formal and official. In addition to this
Walter carried a bulky bag, which contained a complete change of clothing for
Lord Ravenspur. The latter was glad enough to see Walter and Venables. He
breathed a little more freely when he found himself clad at length of Norfolk
suit. He rather rebelled against a showy white helmet and a set of long grey
whiskers which Venables proceeded to attach dexterously to his face. A few
touches of greasepaint and pencil, together with a pair of big spectacles,
rendered the disguise complete. Walter expressed his admiration.</p>
<p>"I can hardly believe that it is you, uncle," he said.</p>
<p>"And you are changed almost out of recognition," Ravenspur said. "Really, I
must compliment Mr. Venables. And now, I suppose I had better hide the bag in
these bushes. We have a very anxious day before us, I am afraid, but that does
not prevent one feeling the call of Nature. I don't think I was ever so
ravenously hungry in my life. Where can we get some breakfast?"</p>
<p>Venables, who seemed to have thought of everything, had already solved the
problem. There was a very fair hotel not far from the station, and it would be
an easy matter to hide the surveying outfit till it was needed. In the first
place, they could skirt round the edge of the common, and pay a call on the man
Perks, who would look after the dog till his services were needed again.</p>
<p>They came at length to Perks' house, a rather dilapidated looking place,
with a large, untidy garden around it. There were sheds and huts and kennels at
the back, so that the intruders were greeted with a terrible din of barking as
they went up the path.</p>
<p>"Cunning hand, Perks," Venables explained. "It is very little he makes out
of dog-fancying. But see how useful these animals are. Day or night the police
can never approach the place with the object of raid without Perks having ample
notice. But come along, and you shall see the man for yourselves. Oh, you
needn't trouble yourself about your disguise. Perks is not in the least
suspicious nor will he ask any questions. He will only think that you are a
couple of amateur detectives like myself."</p>
<h2><a id="chap32" name="chap32">XXXII - WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</a></h2>
<p>ROUSED by the angry uproar of the dogs, a tall, round- shouldered individual
appeared in the doorway. He had a melancholy cast of face which was intensified
by the lank black hair which hung upon his shoulders. Indeed, the man looked
more like some street preacher than a suspect with a record of crime behind
him. But the eyes were shrewd enough, and so was the smile with which Perks
greeted Venables when the latter disclosed his identity.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, you was always one for your little games, sir," he said. "Take
care of that dog for you? Of course I will. And a rare beauty he is. Is there
anything else, gentlemen?"</p>
<p>"No," Venables explained. "Mind the dog is for sale if anybody asks
questions. You have had him for some time, and you want a big price for him.
Maybe we shall he able to find a job for you after dark to-night, but as to
that I can say nothing for the present. At any rate, there is a five-pound note
for you so long as you are discreet and silent. I suppose I can come into your
house and write a letter? I'll get you to post it presently."</p>
<p>Perks intimated that his house was at the disposal of the visitors, and they
all trooped inside. The place looked cosy and comfortable enough, though it was
somewhat untidy. At one end of the table was a china bowl, which was filled
with odds and ends of small gold and silver ornaments. Venables winked at
Perks, and the latter grinned sheepishly. He snatched up the bowl, and hastily
removed it to a side table. Ravenspur held out a detaining hand.</p>
<p>"One moment," he said, "I am rather fond of those kind of things. I don't
wish to be inquisitive, or to ask idle questions, but unless I am greatly
mistaken you have a Commonwealth porringer amongst those things. I should like
to look at it."</p>
<p>Perks bowed to the inevitable. He cursed himself slightly under his breath
for his folly in not removing everything, but he felt safe in the hands of his
visitors. They would not be likely to ask any questions as to whence the
plunder came. By the time that Venables had written and stamped his letter.
Lord Ravenspur came forward with a small metal disc in his hand.</p>
<p>"This is a bit of a curio in its way," he said. "Intrinsically it is worth
very little, only a few shillings at the outside. If you like to take a
sovereign for it&mdash;"</p>
<p>Perks fell in with the suggestion eagerly enough. There was no reason to
stay any longer, and the trio set out for the hotel, feeling now that it was
possible to move without the slightest fear of alarming the inhabitants of the
cottage on the common.</p>
<p>"I suppose that was stolen property we caught Perks looking over?" Ravenspur
asked.</p>
<p>"Not the slightest doubt of it," Venables said coolly. "I daresay if we had
been voted suspicious the signal would have been flashed back to the house to
hide it at once. But if you thought it was stolen property. Lord Ravenspur, why
did you invest in that little disc which you took such a fancy to?"</p>
<p>"I am going to tell you something startling," Ravenspur replied. "Walter,
you recollect that little ornament which I bought in Rome, and subsequently
gave to poor Delahay who took a great fancy to it? I had his initials engraved
on the back. He wore it on his watch-chain."</p>
<p>"I recollect it perfectly well," Walter said. "Delahay was wearing it the
last time I ever saw him. But what has all this got to do with your purchase of
this morning?"</p>
<p>"Only that it happens to be the same thing," Ravenspur said quietly. "I
recognised it in a moment. Oh, there is no mistake. Here is the disc for you to
examine for yourself. You will see the initials and the date on the back of it.
As soon as we get time, we must ascertain from Inspector Dallas if Delahay's
watch was missing when his body was found. If so, then this opens quite a new
phase of the mystery. On the whole, I am not at all sorry that we came here
to-day. Of course, I kept my knowledge to myself, because I didn't want to
arouse Perks' suspicions. But if we can contrive to find out from whom he
bought this thing we shall be going a long way to clear up the mystery of poor
Delahay's death."</p>
<p>The matter was discussed at some length over the breakfast, to which all of
them did ample justice. Once this was finished, they made their way back to the
common again, and sat down on the grass to mature their plan of campaign.</p>
<p>"Now what we want to do," Venables began, "is this. We want to be in a
position to make a close study of yonder house without arousing the suspicions
of the people there. I racked my brain for a long time before I could think of
a feasible scheme. And then it came to to me like an inspiration. What could we
do better than pass ourselves off as an Ordnance Survey party down here on
business? That is why I procured the official looking caps, to say nothing of
the theodolite and the notebooks. Now you. Lord Ravenspur, have only got to
look wise and give us directions. You look exactly like the head of an
exploring party. We will pretend to work the theodolite, and make measurements,
and all that kind of thing."</p>
<p>"Inside the grounds?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"Of course," Venables went on; "that is the beauty of the scheme. No spot of
ground is sacred to an Ordnance party. I have actually seen them work inside a
church. All we have got to do is to go about our business boldly and be quite
firm if anybody attempts to molest us. It may be news to you that nobody can be
prosecuted for trespass unless specific damage is done."</p>
<p>The instruments were recovered presently from the hiding-place, and with the
theodolite on his shoulder Venables stepped boldly on to the lawn in front of
the house, and gravely went to work. The blinds were all up by this time. The
windows were opened, and a glimpse of well-furnished rooms could be seen in the
background. A couple of maids stood in one of the windows, and watched the
strangers curiously.</p>
<p>"It looks respectable enough," Venables muttered, pretending to be
exceedingly busy. "You may depend upon it, this is a tougher job than we
anticipated. These servants are all right. You may be sure that they know
nothing of what is going on. However, to make certain, I'D ask them for
myself."</p>
<p>Venables approached the window and asked civilly for the loan of a small
piece of string. He came back presently, after a chat of a minute or two, and
once more appeared to be wholly engrossed in his instrument. At the same time,
he was telling his companions the information which he had gleaned.</p>
<p>"I knew I was right," he said. "The house has been let furnished to an
Italian gentleman called something or another, I didn't quite catch what, and
the people only came down yesterday. Those servants go with the freehold, so to
speak, and they have all been in their present situation for some considerable
time. Their master is a City stockbroker, who, with his family, is on the
Continent for the next month or two. If we are lucky we shall probably get a
sight of the Italian presently, though I expect we have all got a pretty shrewd
notion who the gentleman is."</p>
<p>The work proceeded gravely for a quarter of an hour. Levels appeared to be
taken, and there was much entering of figures in the notebooks. Presently, as
Walter glanced around him, he drew a deep breath, for there was no mistaking
the identity of the slim figure that emerged from one of the open French
windows and came striding eagerly down the lawn.</p>
<p>"Silva," Walter said under his breath. "Don't pretend to see him till he
gets quite close. I think it would be a good thing if we left all the
interviewing to Venables."</p>
<p>The Italian approached the group and superciliously demanded to know what
they were doing there. He looked quite the master of the place in his cool,
flannel suit. He had a cigarette between his strong, white teeth.</p>
<p>"Why are you trespassing here?" he demanded. "Don't you know that this is
private property? Go, or I will call in the police and give you into
custody."</p>
<p>"The police won't help you in this case," Venables said with the air of a
military man who is quite sure of his ground. "We are here on Government
business. I don't know if you understand what I mean, but we are surveying, and
nobody has a right to interfere with us, providing we do no damage. We can come
into the house if we like. Indeed, I am not quite sure that we shan't have to.
I see you have got a flat roof, sir, with railings round. If we have occasion
to take the theodolite up there I will ring the bell and let you know."</p>
<p>The whole thing was so coolly and naturally done that Silva was taken aback
for the moment. Evidently he had come out of the house full of suspicion, and
with the fixed intention of getting rid of these intruders as soon as possible.
There was an uneasy look in his eyes as Venables suggested the roof of the
house as the field of action. He deemed it wise to shift his ground
altogether.</p>
<p>"That will be very inconvenient," he said, in quite another voice. "I hope
you will be able to manage without that if you can. However, if you will give
me an hour's notice, I daresay&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Walter was no longer listening. He was standing up regarding the house
with a professional eye. His gaze vaguely took in a dormer window immediately
under the roof. There were bars to the window, pointing to the fact that at
some time or another the room had been used as a nursery. The window was blank
for a moment, then a face appeared and looked out.</p>
<p>That instant was enough for Walter. There was no mistaking those features.
They were those of Vera Rayne.</p>
<h2><a id="chap33" name="chap33">XXXIII - THE MIDNIGHT MESSAGE</a></h2>
<p>IT was with the greatest difficulty that Walter restrained himself. He dared
not look round again until Silva's back was turned and the Italian returned to
the house. Even then it would have been impolitic to make a sign, for there
might be prying, suspicious eyes looking from other windows who would
understand, and then the whole of Venables' ingenious scheme would be wasted.
Turning sideways, Walter glanced up again. It seemed to him that he could still
catch the outline of Vera's figure. Then a desperate idea occurred to him. He
stooped down and went through all the motions of patting and caressing some
favourite animal. There was just the outside chance that Vera might take this
as an allusion to Bruno, and the knowledge that the dog had put her friends on
her track. The girl was sharp and quick enough, and she might easily, in the
light of events, guess the identity of the trio on the lawn. Before Walter
could speak, Venables glanced in his direction and smiled.</p>
<p>"Well, did you see it?" the former asked.</p>
<p>"Did you see it, too?" Walter exclaimed. "I am glad of that because now I
know I was not mistaken."</p>
<p>"See what?" Ravenspur asked, apparently busy with his notebook. "I didn't
notice anything."</p>
<p>"It was Vera," Walter whispered. "Whatever you do, don't look up now. I
daresay you happened to notice a dormer window in the roof, with bars in front
of it. Well, a moment ago, I saw Vera's face there. What a fortunate thing it
was that we thought of the dog last night! I knew he would not lead us
astray."</p>
<p>"So far, so good," Venables murmured. "And now, don't let us forget what we
are here for. The next thing is to go to the back of the house and go through
the same pantomime there. What I want to do is to find the easiest way of
getting into the place, and to ascertain how many people there are in the
house, and where they sleep. For that purpose it is necessary to be as near the
back door as possible. I shall want you two to keep up the masquerade while I
pump the servants. With any luck we shall have got all we want to know by lunch
time."</p>
<p>Venables was as good as his word. By two o'clock the survey was complete,
and the trio were trudging off to their hotel to talk the matter over. It was
in a little arbour in the garden, over cigars and coffee, that Venables
unbosomed himself.</p>
<p>"It is like this," he explained. "I told you before that those servants were
quite innocent of anything going wrong in the house, and so it turns out. The
tenant is Silva, and his sister, the countess of something or another, whose
name doesn't matter, though it will be necessary to see the lady later on.
There is no basement, and, as far as I could see, there would be very little
diffIculty in obtaining entrance to the house by means of a small window that
gives light and air to the larder. On the ground floor are four living rooms,
which we need not trouble about. There are four bedrooms on the fIrst floor,
and four on the second, to say nothing of the room in the roof. I didn't dare
to be too curious about this roof room, but I am told that Silva uses it
himself for certain experiments, and that, as his experiments are dangerous, he
keeps the key in his pocket. The explanation sounds simple, and quite suffices
for the servants; but I think we have got a pretty fair idea of what is going
on in that roof room. I have managed to make a rough sort of plan of the
bedrooms, so that we shall be fairly safe when we come to break into the house,
as we shall have to do soon after midnight, if you are agreeable."</p>
<p>"Isn't that rather a dangerous proceeding?" Walter asked. "I didn't know
that you added housebreaking to your other accomplishments. Being amateurs, we
are certain to make a noise, and you may be pretty sure that Silva only sleeps
on one ear."</p>
<p>"Oh, that part will be managed for us all right," Venables said coolly. "The
housebreaking item of the programme will be carried out by Perks. The rascal
knows he is quite safe in our hands, and he will do all that is necessary for
about a ten-pound note. Once his work is accomplished we will send him about
his business. The rest we can manage ourselves. It will go hard, indeed, with
us if Miss Rayne is not back in our hands again before daylight."</p>
<p>Walter could think of no better scheme to offer, so that Venables was
allowed to have his own way. There was nothing for it now but to pass the time
as best they could till midnight The hours stole slowly on. The darkness
deepened and night came at length. Dinner had been a thing of the past for some
time, and it was getting near eleven o'clock before the trio, accompanied by
Perks, made their way in the direction of the common. They lay quietly on the
turf there till a distant church dock struck twelve, then Venables jumped to
his feet and declared that the time for action had arrived.</p>
<p>It was nervous enough work, and Walter was wishing it well over. There was
no trouble in getting into the garden, and round to the back of the house, to
the point fixed upon by Venables as being the most likely for their purpose.
They had all been provided with silent shoes by Perks, though no questions were
asked as to whence they came. Now that the pinch had come Perks was by far the
most confident of the party. Probably his previous experiences in this line
were standing him in good stead.</p>
<p>Coolly enough he produced a dark lantern and turned the disc of flame down,
so that it shone alone upon the bag of tools which lay upon the grass. He
picked out one presently, and proceeded, in perfectly noiseless fashion, to cut
out a disc of glass to which he had previously affixed a sheet of brown paper
by the aid of the tallow from a candle. Once the instrument had severed the
glass, the portion cut away fell noiselessly into Perks' hand, so that he had
no difficulty in placing his arm inside and pulling back the catch. The window
was now open, but it was sufficiently small to make entry into the house a
matter of some difficulty.</p>
<p>"I think you had better try first," Venables whispered to Walter. "You are
the most agile. Just work your way through and go round to the front door and
let us in. I don't think- you need stay any longer, Perks."</p>
<p>"I am not quite so sure about that, sir," Perks grinned."It is a very common
practice with people to fasten their scullery and kitchen doors. I think I had
better stay here till the gentleman has made sure."</p>
<p>A grim, silent moment or two followed. Then, surely enough, Walter came back
with the whispered information that the kitchen door was locked. Perks chuckled
to himself as he snatched up another instrument and squeezed through the
window. He set to work in business-like fashion, so that the kitchen door was
forced at length without the slightest noise, and the way to the hall was
clear.</p>
<p>In the strange, unfamiliar darkness, Walter stood for a moment until his
eyes should become accustomed to the objects all about him. One by one they
began to loom out of the blackness. He could make out chairs and tables, the
outline of a square hall, and the front door at the end of it. He set his teeth
together, now filled with a stern resolution to succeed or lose his life in the
attempt. He was not ignorant of the class of man he had to deal with. He knew
that Silva would not hesitate to shoot him down like a dog if his presence were
detected. But, surely, between the three of them, they would be able to manage?
It only needed to find Silva's room, to go in there and overpower him. Once he
was helpless, to get up to the roof room and rescue Vera was the work of a
moment.</p>
<p>With these sanguine thoughts uppermost in his mind, Walter cautiously made
his way in the direction of the front door. It was not difficult to draw the
bolts or take down the chain. But the trouble lay in the fact that the door was
also locked, and the key had vanished. Therefore, any idea of admitting his
companions that way had to be definitely abandoned.</p>
<p>Still, there were the windows, and French windows at that. But even this
scheme was frustrated by the knowledge, gained a moment later, that all the
living rooms on the ground floor were locked and the keys taken away. It was a
disconcerting moment, and Walter hardly knew how to proceed. There was no help
for it but to return by the way he had come and tell the others of his
discovery. As to Lord Ravenspur, he was far too big a man to squeeze through
the larder window, so that the perilous task would devolve entirely upon Walter
and Venables.</p>
<p>As Walter stood there he became conscious of the fact that a feeble ray of
light was penetrating down the well of the stairs. Acting on the impulse of the
moment he crept up a few of the thickly carpeted stairs until he was in a
position to command the landing. The light penetrated from one of the rooms,
the door of which was slightly open, so that Walter was fain to look in. It was
only a night-light, after all, standing on a small table in the middle of the
room. Even from that distance Walter could see that a letter lay by the side of
the light, or, rather, a sheet of paper with a message upon it. Powerful
curiosity drew him on, and he snatched up the sheet of paper. There were only
two or three lines, but Walter recognised, with a thrill, that they were in
Vera's handwriting. He had no time to read, before a sudden rush of cold air
from somewhere extinguished the feeble light. Worse than this, the current
slammed the door to with a bang that shook the whole house. It was so utterly
unexpected, and the darkness was so intense, that Walter could only stand there
utterly lost as to his surroundings.</p>
<h2><a id="chap34" name="chap34">XXXIV - A STRANGE HOME-COMING</a></h2>
<p>VERA opened her eyes at length. Gradually the things that had happened came
back to her. She recognised the futility of resistance. All she could do was to
wait and hope for the best. But despite the startling rapidity with which
events had moved, she was not in the least frightened. Her prevailing feeling
was one of indignation that any man should have dared to treat her in this way.
Withal, there was a certain vein of curiosity that Vera did not care to
suppress. The cab was still moving briskly, and Vera judged by the trees on
each aide of the road that they were already out in the country. The man sat
opposite her, grim and silent. He made no inquiry as to how Vera was getting
on. He suggested no apology for his violence.</p>
<p>The feeling of languor and the suggestion of headache passed away, leaving
Vera strong and vigorous again. It was impossible to sit there without
speaking.</p>
<p>"Do you quite understand what you are doing?" she said to the man opposite.
"Do you realise that you are guilty of a criminal offence? You could be
prosecuted for this."</p>
<p>"I will not contradict you," Silva said politely. "Believe me, I deeply
regret the necessity for taking this step. Yet it was impossible to satisfy our
requirements in any other way."</p>
<p>"Oh, you are not alone, then?" Vera asked. "Would it be inquiring too much
if I asked who else is in this business?"</p>
<p>Silva smiled under cover of the darkness. A man of courage himself, he
admired that quality in others. So the child that he had known, and been so
passionately attached to, eighteen years ago had grown up to be a worthy
representative of her race? Vera would have been astonished at that moment if
she could have seen into the back of Silva's brain. She did not realise for a
moment that here was a man who would have gone through fire and water for her,
and yet, at the same time, he was prepared to wreak his insane vengeance upon
those whom she loved and admired more than anybody in the world. If Vera's
happiness had depended upon it, Silva would not have spared Ravenspur, even had
Vera gone on her knees and asked for it. Yet he would have given his life if it
could have done any good to this proud descendant of the house of Descarti.</p>
<p>"Surely you can guess who is with me in this business?" he said. "Did I not
bring you a letter from your mother?"</p>
<p>Vera started. She had forgotten her mother for the moment, and this question
of Silva's had opened up a new and painful train of thought. He was taking her
to see her mother. But why had her mother so suddenly displayed this tender
solicitude, after leaving her absolutely alone all these years? That Vera's
mother was in possession of her whereabouts, and had been all this time the
girl did not doubt. When part of the story had to be told she had accepted
Ravenspur's statement implicitly. Her mother was a vile woman, and the past was
too painful for a young girl to hear. Ravenspur had not said so in as many
words, but that was distinctly the impression he had conveyed to Vera. She
began dimly to comprehend now why this new-born affection of her mother's had
not found vent in the conventional way. Doubtless Ravenspur would have
forbidden her the house. Doubtless he had a hold that gave him the control of
the situation&mdash;probably a compact made years ago. And now one of the
parties desired to break it. Perhaps it was a question of money, or family
property, or something of that kind? Vera had heard of similar cases.</p>
<p>At any rate, there must be some reason for this mystery and violence. And no
doubt every word that Ravenspur had said about her mother's character was true.
Otherwise she could not have consented to an abduction like this. Still, there
was comfort in the reflection that Lord Ravenspur and Walter would leave no
stone unturned to punish this outrage. The miscreants would be found out sooner
or later. Vera congratulated herself now upon the fact that she had left her
handkerchief tied to the collar of the dog Bruno. That would be a sufficient
clue to put her friends on the trail, and Bruno himself, with his unerring
instinct, would lead the pursuers to the right place. After all, the
imprisonment could not last long, though Vera boiled with indignation as she
thought of the treacherous way in which she had been deceived.</p>
<p>"And you are going to take me to my mother, then?" she asked.</p>
<p>"That is the programme," Silva said coolly. "Unfortunately, you will not be
able to see the Countess to-night. You may believe me or not, but I am sorry to
have been compelled to take a step like this. But you see, Lord Ravenspur's
plans made it quite impossible for me to wait till to-morrow."</p>
<p>Vera was silent for a moment. She could see plainly that Ravenspur's clever
scheme for getting away to Weymouth had been betrayed by someone to this man.
Her chief anxiety for the moment was for her guardian. It was terrible to think
that he had been dogged and watched by people so cunning and unscrupulous as
these. Vera was still thinking the matter over when the cab stopped and Silva
bade her get out. . A wild idea of appealing to the cabman for assistance was
dismissed as she caught sight of his face. There was a grin upon it, and the
driver unmistakably winked at Silva. There was just enough light for Vera to
see that the cabman was not wearing a badge. Doubtless he was a conspirator,
too. There was nothing for it but to see the thing through to the finish. So
Vera followed Silva through the garden till he paused at length on the steps of
a house, which appeared to be in total darkness.</p>
<p>"The servants have gone to bed," Silva explained, as he opened the door with
a latchkey. "If you will wait a moment, I will turn up the gas. If you desire
anything&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Vera said curtly. "All I want you to do is to show me to my room.
I wish to be alone."</p>
<p>Silva bowed politely enough. He turned and locked the door, and Vera saw
that he dropped the key in his pocket. Then he took a silver candlestick from
the hall table and handed it to Vera, intimating that he would like her to
precede him up the stairs. They came at length to a room in the roof of the
house which appeared to be comfortably, almost luxuriously furnished, and with
every feminine requirement at hand. With absolute amazement Vera saw her own
silver toilet set laid out on the dressing table, her handbag was on the floor,
and in one corner of the room stood the two dress-baskets which her maid had
packed for immediate use on board the yacht. A slight smile of amusement
flickered over Silva's face as he noticed Vera's amazement.</p>
<p>"Everything has been done to make you comfortable," he said. "It was my own
idea to remove your immediate belongings from Waterloo Station and bring them
on here. I assure you that it was no difficult job. And now I wish you
good-night, with a thousand pardons for the way in which I have been compelled
to treat you. To-morrow morning&mdash;"</p>
<p>Silva paused significantly and bowed himself out of the room. He closed the
door gently behind him, and Vera waited till the sound of his footsteps had
died away. She tried the door, but, as she had anticipated, it was fastened on
the outside. Beyond all question, she was a prisoner. There was nothing but to
make the best of it, and wait on the course of events. There were two bolts on
the inside of the door, and, having secured these. Vera felt easier in her
mind. She undressed slowly, and more for something to occupy her mind than
anything else. She would never be able to sleep again. The idea of sleep seemed
to be out of the question. Yet, within ten minutes, Vera had fallen into a deep
slumber from which she did not wake until the sun was shining high, and the
birds were singing in the trees. The girl rose eagerly and looked out. She
could see a wide expanse of green lawn, with big shaded trees here and there.
On two sides of the house a common stretched away apparently to the confines of
space. How far she was from London Vera could not say. Certainly she had never
been here before. She was still admiring the beauty of the landscape when there
came a quiet knock at the door, and after the bolts were drawn Silva came in.
He was, if possible, even more abjectly apologetic than on the previous
evening.</p>
<p>"I am bound to intrude," he said. "You see, this house has only been taken
for a time, and the servants are absolutely in ignorance of your presence here.
I merely came to show you where you could find all the requisites for your
breakfast, and as to the rest, they are in this basket. Here is a spirit lamp,
so that you can boil your own water. I am in great hopes that before evening I
shall be able to give you what is practically the freedom of the house. Do not
think too harshly of me."</p>
<p>Vera made no reply; she was only pleased to have the room to herself again,
so that she could think the matter out. She ate her breakfast slowly, for time
was beginning to hang on her hands. Any action was better than sitting there
doing nothing. It was some time later when she crossed to the window, and
looked out. She saw three men busily engaged in some occupation on the lawn.
She saw Silva come out and address them, apparently in tones of expostulation,
so far as she could judge from his actions. Then one of the men looked up, and
Vera could see that he had noticed her. A moment later the man stooped down,
and went through some sort of a pantomime, which, in the circumstances, puzzled
Vera extremely. Why should that grave-looking official stoop down and imitate
the motions of one who is stroking a dog?</p>
<h2><a id="chap35" name="chap35">XXXV - MOTHER AND CHILD</a></h2>
<p>AT any other time the trifling incident would have escaped Vera's attention.
But she had nothing else to occupy her mind now. She wondered what it meant.
There was no doubt that the official-looking person below was pretending to
stroke a dog. There was no jest about it, either, because the other two men
took no heed. They appeared to be too absorbed in their occupation. Then, all
at once, the truth of it flashed into Vera's mind with a suddenness that left
her pale and trembling. It was plain enough. She could not say for certain who
it was patting and caressing an imaginary dog, but she was quite certain that
there was a message to her behind it. In the first place the man had seen her
at the window, of that she felt certain. And he was telling her as plainly as
words could speak that her handkerchief had been found, and that Bruno led her
friends to the right spot. No doubt, these willing assistants had assumed the
guise of land surveyors with a view to getting a better knowledge of the house.
Once the excitement of this discovery passed away, Vera's courage came back to
her. She now knew that she was safe. She knew that it would not be long before
she was restored to her friends again. She deemed it prudent to keep away from
the window, and when at length she looked down again, the men were gone.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to kill the dreary afternoon as best she could.
It seemed to her that she knew every inch of her room, every design and pattern
on the wallpaper. She would have given much for a book to while away the time,
but, apparently, Silva had overlooked that requirement. As she lay back in an
arm-chair, for the first time, a small, wooden trap in the ceiling attracted
her attention. It seemed strange to Vera that she had not noticed it before. A
sudden resolution possessed her. She balanced a couple of chairs, one on the
other, upon the bed, and made an attempt to lift the trap. There was not the
slightest trouble. The square of board gave to her touch at once. Vera thrust
her head and shoulders through, and saw that she was immediately under the
roof. A sliding glass window overhead lighted up the place, so that Vera could
see what sort of a place she had discovered. Instantly she made up her mind
what to do. She turned a yachting jersey out of one of the baskets and removed
the bodice of her dress. A short serge skirt completed the outfit, and a few
moments later Vera had squeezed through the trap, and was walking along the
boards which covered the whole area of the house under the roof. What she was
now anxious to find was a way down. Here was a large tank which supplied the
house with water, and by the side of it a short iron ladder, the end of which
was lost in the semi-darkness. But Vera had discovered enough. Doubtless the
iron ladder was a permanent structure for the use of workmen in case anything
went wrong with the big tank. In all probability the bottom of the iron ladder
reached down until it joined the servants' staircase. Vera had seen
arrangements of this kind in small country houses before.</p>
<p>At any rate, the knowledge was worth having. Here was a clear avenue of
escape. As soon as the house was quiet Vera would be able to steal away, and
once outside, she would know exactly what to do. She had no money, but that was
a mere detail.</p>
<p>The slow hours crept on till dusk began to fall, and there had been no
further sign from Silva. The clocks outside were striking eight when someone
tapped at the door, and in response to Vera's query the voice of Silva
spoke:</p>
<p>"We are dining in half an hour," he said. "Will you be so good as to come
down? I have unfastened the door."</p>
<p>Vera was trembling with excitement and appprehension. She hastened to change
her dress, and a few moments later was hurrying down the stairs. When she
reached the hall she found Silva awaiting her. He looked somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>Your mother is in the drawing-room," he said I hope you won't mind sitting
down to a cold dinner. For motives of prudence we have sent the servants to
London for an evening at the theatre. To anyone as intelligent as yourself you
will see why we adopted such a course. Will you precede me?"</p>
<p>Vera had nothing to reply. Just for the moment she was incapable of speech.
She was wondering whether or not she would awake presently and find it all no
more than a dream. The drawing-room was brilliantly lighted. A tall, dark woman
stood by the fireplace. Her regular features appeared to be absolutely
composed; but agitated though Vera was, she did not fail to notice the restless
movements of the hands. Just for a few moments the two looked at one another.
Then something like a smile came over the Countess Flavio's face.</p>
<p>"So you are my daughter," she said. "I am afraid I should not have
recognised you. Come closer, so that I can look at your face. Thank Heaven, you
are not in the least like your father. I cannot be sufficiently thankful for
that."</p>
<p>"I have thought about you often," Vera said coldly; "but, surely, if you are
my mother, you have a strange way of making yourself known to me. What is the
meaning of this outrage? Surely you could have come to Park Lane and asked for
me in the ordinary way, without sending this creature of yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>Vera looked round for Silva, but he had discreetly disappeared.</p>
<p>"I am glad that man has had the decency to leave us alone," she went on.
"Oh, I have been thinking about this meeting all day. I do not know what to
imagine, or what to believe. You say that you are my mother, but how I am to be
certain that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I swear it," the Countess said, with a touch of passion in her voice. "You
are my daughter beyond the shadow of a doubt. Oh, there is a deal in what you
say, but I could not come to Lord Ravenspur's house. There are most urgent
reasons. You are wondering, perhaps, why I have not been near you all these
years; but I can explain. You remember nothing of your father, for which you
can thank your Maker. With the solitary exception of yourself, there was not a
creature on earth that he cared for. He was the embodiment of refined cruelty.
His greatest delight was in the tortured degradation of others. Ah, you little
guess what a veritable hell the two years which followed your birth were. I
will tell you all about that some day, and you will be sorry for me. If you had
only had my experience you would not wonder why I fled and hid myself when my
release came. You would not wonder why I refused to see you, for fear you
should be like your father, and remind me of him every hour I was so near the
borderland of insanity then that I should have killed you, if by one look or
gesture you had reminded me of the man who had ruined my life. And then, when
the lapse of years had restored my strength and vigor again, a longing to see
you took possession of me. And when at length I had found you, or, rather, my
faithful servant, Silva, had found you for me, there were certain circumstances
which prevented my seeking you out at once. I was going to wait my time, but
the man whom you call your guardian took such steps that I was bound to act at
once. That is why I wrote you that letter last night. That is why you were
brought here. And as to Lord Ravenspur, if he is lucky&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Countess paused and bit her lips. A horrible suspicion flashed into
Vera's mind.</p>
<p>"You must say nothing against him," she cried. "Lord Ravenspur is one of the
best and noblest of men."</p>
<p>"Lord Ravenspur is a scoundrel," the Countess cried. "Yes, and before I have
finished I am going to prove it to you. Oh, you may look incredulous, but I am
a deeply injured woman, and that man is responsible for all my torture."</p>
<p>A crimson wave stained Vera's cheeks. Here was the old suspicion back again
with reboubled force. She would have asked the direct question which was
trembling on her lips, but the door opened, and Silva came in hurriedly.</p>
<p>"I am loth to intrude," he said, "but it is already half-past eight, and it
is imperative that you, madam, should be back in London this evening. There is
a train at twenty minutes past nine, which you must not fail to catch."</p>
<p>Without argument, the Countess led the way across to the dining-room, where
dinner was laid out. Vera noted with some surprise that there were only covers
for two. She had half expected that Silva would sit down to table, instead of
which he moved from place to place, waiting upon them, as if he had been
accustomed to that kind of thing all his life. A few moments ago he had
appeared to be the dictator and leader in everything. Now he suddenly lapsed
into a perfectly respectful and exceedingly well-trained servant. It was not
that Silva was acting a part. The thing was so perfectly done that Vera saw at
once that this was the man's proper position in life. She was too excited to
eat or drink, so that, altogether, the meal was little more than a mere
formality.</p>
<p>"I am sorry that I can't stay any longer," the Countess said; "I am bound to
be in London this evening."</p>
<p>"Then I will come with you," Vera said promptly.</p>
<p>"No," Silva burst out sternly. "The thing is impossible. For the present you
stay where you are. In a day or two we will make other arrangements with the
servants, and then you can have the freedom of the house. The Countess will
tell you that I am right."</p>
<p>"I am afraid so," the Countess said, "unless you will give me your word that
you will not communicate with Lord Ravenspur. You must be dead as far as he and
his household are concerned."</p>
<h2><a id="chap36" name="chap36">XXXVI - IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT</a></h2>
<p>I CANNOT do it," Vera said quietly. "Forgive me if my words hurt you, but so
far I have no evidence to prove that you are anything more than a mere
impostor. You claim to be my mother, and perhaps you are. But till to-night I
had no mother. For eighteen years Lord Ravenspur has been more than a father to
me. If you can give me any satisfactory explanation of this plot against my
safety&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can," the Countess cried. "Two years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Be silent!" Silva cried furiously. "I beg your pardon, madam, but I am
forgetting myself. I will venture to remind you that your train will not
wait."</p>
<p>"That is quite suffIcient," Vera said, with dignity. "I will return to my
room again. Perhaps the next time I see you, you will have more time for an
explanation."</p>
<p>The girl turned and left the room. She walked slowly and sadly up the
stairs, and locked herself in. It was not long before she heard the click of
the fastening outside. She knew that she was a prisoner once more. It was out
of the question to try and realise the meaning of all this extraordinary
mystery. There was a certain sense of comfort in the knowledge that she was
safe from personal violence. But, beyond this, there was little to light up the
dreary prospect. Vera sat there thinking the matter over till the clock struck
eleven. Then she glanced up at the ceiling, and stared at the trap-door long
and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>She could not hear a sound in the house. Doubtless Silva had retired long
ago. Perhaps he was asleep by this time. As to the servants, they were probably
not returning till an early hour in the morning. Vera calculated that the house
was sufficiently far from London to make a return after the theatre impossible.
She was going to risk it. If Silva caught her attempting to escape she could
only return to her room again. She changed her dress rapidly. In the pocket of
her skirt she placed a a box of matches and a night-light, which she found on
the dressing-table. To get through the trap was a matter of a moment. With the
aid of a match she found the top of the iron ladder, and when she had let
herself down she came at length, as she had expected, to the top of the
servants' staircase. The house was absolutely quiet, and plunged in darkness.
Vera scarcely dared to breathe, till, at length, she found herself in the hall.
It was tense and nervous work, and the girl was trembling from head to foot.
She hardly dared to touch the bolts. She drew them back a fraction at a time.
Then she slid off the chain; the links clicked together with a noise that
sounded in the girl's ears almost like a pistol shot. She turned the handle
hurriedly. One moment more, and she would be in the garden.</p>
<p>The disappointment was swift and cruel. The door was locked, and the key was
not there. Evidently this was no way of escape. After the first feeling of
despair Vera shot the bolts back, and put up the chain once more. It was no use
trying the back door, for that would probably be locked and the key gone. The
only possible exit was by way of one of the windows on the ground floor. But
here again Vera was doomed to disappointment, for every door was fastened and
every key had vanished.</p>
<p>Vera blew out her night-light, and crept softly up the stairs again. She
wondered if it were possible to open one of the bedroom windows and leap to the
ground. Trembling in every limb she groped her way into one of the rooms, the
door of which was open. Once more she ventured to strike a light. The room she
was in was furnished like a study. Here was a large table with paper and pens
and ink. The walls were lined with books. A strong current of air came in from
somewhere; then Vera realised that one of the windows was open. There was a
balcony beyond, and on to this she stepped, trying to measure with her eye the
distance to the ground. But it was too dark for that. The risk was too great to
take. It was like standing on the edge of a precipice. Vera drew back with a
shudder. She really had not the courage for such a desperate venture. It would
be far better for her to remain where she was until her friends came to her
assistance.</p>
<p>With this thought uppermost in her mind Vera turned back to the room again.
A sudden gust of air from the open window extinguished the night-light. It was
just as well, for almost at the same instant another door opened on the
landing, and a shaft of brilliant light shot out. In its rays Vera could see
Silva and another man who was a stranger to her. Silva appeared to be in high
good spirits. He was chatting gaily to his companion.</p>
<p>"Now you know exactly what I want," he said. "You are to wait by the gate
till two o'clock if necessary, and when those people come along, you are to
give me the signal. If they don't come by two o'clock, then we can conclude
that something has interfered with their plans, and the thing has been
postponed."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll do what you want," the other man said hoarsely.</p>
<p>"I'll see that you do," Silva went on. "I suppose those fools thought they
deceived me this morning. It was just as well that I followed them. Well, if
they like to come here, they will be pretty sure of a welcome. And now I will
just come and let you out, and fasten the door behind you. It will be fun to
sit here watching till they are overhead, and then I shall have them in a fine
trap. I am looking forward to it with the greatest possible pleasure. Then you
had better meet me in London to-morrow, and I will give you the money I
promised. Ah, my good Stevens, this is the best week's work you ever did in
your life. A few more such jobs and you will be able to retire from your
honorable profession."</p>
<p>The man addressed as Stevens smiled sourly. Vera made a note of the name;
she also made a note of the man's features. Then, as the two of them went down
into the hall, she slipped back to her own room again by means of the iron
ladder. Her breath was coming thick and fast, but her courage had returned, and
she felt braced up and ready to meet any emergency.</p>
<p>It was quite clear to her what was happening. As far as she herself was
concerned, she was practically a prisoner. She could not get away even if she
wished to. And now she had no desire to leave. Her instincts had been quite
correct Beyond all question the men on the lawn in the earlier part of the day
had been her own friends. The dog had guided them here, and even at that moment
they were probably on their way to effect a rescue.</p>
<p>But they had not been quite clever enough for Silva. He had been too
suspicious to let an incident like that pass. He had appeared to bow to the
inevitable, but, all the same, he had followed his unwelcome visitors, and
probably discovered their secret. And the worst of it was, Silva was now quite
prepared for the intruders. It was impossible, too, for Vera to warn her
friends. She racked her brains for some way of giving them a signal. There was
only one desperate step to take, and she decided to risk it. Back once more she
went until she came at length to the landing on the first floor. Her idea was
to find out where Silva was hiding. There was a strong smell of cigarette smoke
in the house, which appeared to come from the ground floor. There was only one
thing for it, and that was to descend to the hall. Under the morning-room door
there was just a thin slit of light. It was here that the smell of cigarette
smoke was the strongest. It was here, no doubt, that Silva was waiting for the
fray. So far as Vera could judge the morning-room was on one side of the house,
so that in all probability the light would not be seen, or perhaps there were
some heavy curtains or drapery over the window. From his own lips Vera knew
something of what Silva's plans were. He was going to wait there till he had
his enemies trapped overhead. He probably would not move till the critical
moment came.</p>
<p>It was a desperate idea, but there was nothing else for it. Vera crept up to
the little sitting-room, and hastily dashed off a few words of warning which
she hoped might fall into Walter's hands. She did not doubt for a moment that
he would be one of the rescuers. It seemed to her that if she placed the note
on the little table with the night-light behind it, and left the door open, it
would be bound to attract Walter's attention. Then he would be prepared for the
attack from below. There was practically no chance of Silva coming upstairs in
the meantime, so that there was no reason why the little plot should fail. It
was done at length, and then Vera again crept up the iron ladder to the side of
the tank. But she did not return to her room. She knew that she was perfectly
safe where she was. And, besides, at any moment her assistance might be of the
greatest value. She stood there in the pitchy darkness, the leaden moments
creeping on like so many hours.</p>
<p>Her ears were strained to catch the slightest sound; even the trickle of a
water-tap sounded like pistol shots. A mouse behind the wainscot appeared to be
making noise enough to wake the dead. Then, above the creeping silence, came a
quick snap, which was like the breaking of wood. Vera's heart gave a great
leap. It seemed to her that the attack was commencing in earnest.</p>
<p>A minute or two later and she fancied she could bear footsteps in the hall.
But this she dismissed as mere fancy. She could hear the trees rustling outside
as they swayed to a sudden breeze. She hoped the wind would not be strong
enough to blow out her night-light. She wished now that she had closed the
window. Then she jumped with a nervous start as a door banged like the thud of
artillery. She heard a quick, sharp cry, and then the laboured breathing as if
two men were locked in a struggle to the death.</p>
<h2><a id="chap37" name="chap37">XXXVII - AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND</a></h2>
<p>OUTSIDE in the garden, under cover of the darkness, Ravenspur and his
companion waited anxiously for a sign from Walter. The minutes crept slowly on.
Still there was nothing to break the silence. A quarter of an hour passed, and
at length Ravenspur began to feel decidedly anxious.</p>
<p>"I don't like it," he murmured; "I don't like it a bit. We have an
exceedingly cunning scoundrel to deal with, and a bloodthirsty one into the
bargain. That man would not stick at anything. I can't understand how it is
that Walter doesn't open the door."</p>
<p>Venables made no reply. As a matter of fact, he was not a whit less anxious
than Ravenspur. Still the minutes crept on, and still there was no sign from
the interior of the house. Then at last came a faint, dull report, which might
either have been the closing of a door, or the muffled echo of a pistol shot.
Before Venables could reply he felt something damp and cold against his hand.
His nerves were now at high tension. He jumped quickly back, and looked down. A
great hound stood there waving his long tail from side to side and looking up
into Ravenspur's face as if not altogether sure as to his presence being
welcome.</p>
<p>"Call him off," Venables said excitedly. "The brute is dangerous. By Jove,
what a fool I am! I thought at first that this was one of our friend Valdo's
bodyguard, but I see now that it is your dog. Lord Ravenspur. I suppose he has
managed to get away again."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's Bruno right enough," Ravenspur said. "Probably Perks fastened him
up insecurely. But he must not be allowed to roam about here. Do you happen to
have a dog collar and chain in your pocket. Perks? If so, I'll go and chain him
up to one of those trees by the side of the lane."</p>
<p>Perks grinned, and produced the necessary collar and lead. In the course of
his business he rarely travelled without one of these, though he looked
dubiously at the leather strap, and opined that is was not much good for so
great a beast as Bruno.</p>
<p>"I think that will be all right," Lord Ravenspur said. "The dog is well
trained, and if I tell him to stop there I am sure he will. At any rate, I
don't suppose he will move until we have this business finished. Now, come
along, sir."</p>
<p>The great beast trotted along, more or less dejectedly, by his master's
side, and a moment or two later he was lying at the foot of a small tree just
by the gate leading to the lane. Ravenspur hurried back to his companions. He
had hoped by this time that something had happened. He was seriously alarmed to
find the house still in darkness, and no sign of Walter anywhere.</p>
<p>"This is very disturbing," he said. "Don't you think one of you had better
go inside and see what has become of my nephew? If that man there has done him
any violence&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Venables interrupted. "After all, the man we are looking
for is no fool, and he would most assuredly avoid violence if possible. My dear
Lord Ravenspur, you surely did not expect to find Miss Rayne by simply opening
the door and going through the house? For my part, I regard this business as
only just beginning, and I shall be very much surprised if Miss Rayne is in the
house at all. Besides, this man Valdo is certain to be prepared for emergencies
of this kind. Suppose he found Walter, and asked him what he was doing there?
Suppose he insisted upon showing him all over the house? We will assume that he
has proved to Lance that Miss Rayne is not there. He would enjoy that
immensely. It would give him far more pleasure than any personal violence. And
besides, Walter is quite capable of taking care of himself. Really, we must
risk it a little longer. Any undue haste now would ruin our plans."</p>
<p>Sorely against his convictions Ravenspur allowed the point to pass. A
quarter of an hour had elapsed now, and there was no sign of Walter. Ravenspur
was about to speak again when suddenly from the lane came something in the way
of a diversion. A man's voice was raised in terror, a frightened scream for
help rent the air. As the cry died away, a deep growl of the dog was heard.
Without a moment's hesitation Ravenspur rushed away down the garden and in the
direction of the lane.</p>
<p>"There's no time to be lost," he cried. "Come along. Unless I am greatly
mistaken, Bruno has got hold of some unfortunate wayfarer on his way home."</p>
<p>It turned out to be exactly as Lord Ravenspur had prophesied. When Perks
came up, and turned his lantern on the scene, the outline of a man's body came
into view. The unfortunate individual was lying on his back, the great hound
was standing over him, his crest erect, his formidable row of teeth glistening
in the light. At one word from lord Ravenspur the dog crouched down, and the
stranger, trembling with fright in every limb, was dragged to his feet.
Something like a chuckle burst from Perks' lips.</p>
<p>"You seem to be enjoying yourself, John," he said.</p>
<p>"I thought the brute was going to tear the throat out of me," the stranger
said. "I came down here on business&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What business?" Venables said curtly. "Here, Perks, hold that light a bit
higher up so that I can see the fellow's face. Does he happen to be a friend of
yours?"</p>
<p>"We've done a bit of business together," Perks said significantly.
"Otherwise, he is not what I would call a friend of mine. He was over at my
place early this morning, but I thought he had gone back to town again. What
are you looking about here for, John?"</p>
<p>"That's my business," the other said sullenly. "The man who fastened that
dog up there so close to the lane ought to have six months. I don't know who he
belongs to."</p>
<p>"He belongs to me," Lord Ravenspur explained. "There is one thing I will
vouch for&mdash;if you hadn't been coming into the garden, that dog would never
have touched you. It is no business of mine to ask what you are doing here, for
I don't suppose you would tell me If I did. However, it seems to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No; but I can tell you," Venables put in. "This, Lord Ravenspur, is the man
John Stevens who gave evidence at the inquest on Louis Delahay. He was the man
who saw Mrs. Delahay with her husband in Fitzjohn Square that morning. He knows
Valdo exceedingly well, and no doubt he is down here on the latter's business.
If you ask him, he will hardly venture to deny it."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," Stevens stammered.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you do," Venables went on. "You will say presently that you have
never seen me before. You are a treacherous rascal, and evidently you are not
in the least to be relied upon. I told you that it would pay you to join me,
and I suppose your idea is to get money from both parties. This is no time to
waste on incriminations. This man is a spy of Valdo's, Lord Ravenspur.
Evidently he is here to watch our movements. We can't trust him. We can't let
him out of our sight. The question is, what are we going to do with him?"</p>
<p>"You just leave me alone or it will be the worse for you," Stevens
blustered. "I am not the man&mdash;"</p>
<p>Before Stevens could finish his speech he was jerked violently backwards by
Perks, and turned over on his face. In less time than it takes to tell, his
hands were bound behind his back with a couple of straps, and his feet were
fastened together with the aid of some handkerchiefs which Perks borrowed from
his companion. The thing was dexterously done, so that Stevens lay there on his
back, swearing hotly at Perks, and threatening him with what was likely to
happen when his time came.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Perks said cheerfully; "don't you be a fool, John.
It will pay you much better to play the square game with these gentlemen, and
as to your threats, why, they don't worry me. You talk about splitting. Why,
you dare not go within a mile of a police station. And a nice witness before
magistrates you would make. No, my lad; there is no chance of your doing me any
harm unless you are prepared to stand in the dock by my side. Now, come along,
and we'll get it over."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with him?" Ravenspur asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is an easy one," Perks grinned cheerfully. "We'll just carry him
as far as the common, and dump him down on a nice bed of bracken where he can
pass the time studying astronomy. I haven't any fear that he can get rid of
these bandages. When everything is settled, I'll come back and fetch him. Then
I can take him home, and give him some breakfast. He won't bear any malice.
That is a very good point about John Stevens: he never bears malice for long.
As a matter of fact, he ain't got pluck enough."</p>
<p>Stevens was dumped unceremoniously down upon the bracken, and the little
party went back to the house. Lord Ravenspur had forgotten all about Walter for
the moment. His mind had reverted to the murder in Fitzjohn Square. He was
thinking of Delahay and certain fresh facts which had recently come to light.
He allowed Venables to precede him. Then he drew Perks aside for a moment.</p>
<p>"I am going to ask you a question," he said, "and I hope you will answer it
straightforwardly. I will see that no harm comes to you. And, indeed, in any
case it will be to your advantage to be candid. Have you had any dealings
lately with this man Stevens? You know what I mean. Have you bought anything
from him for which you paid without asking any questions?"</p>
<p>"Only this very morning, sir," Perks admitted cheerfully. "To tell you the
truth, that little thing what you gave me a sovereign for was amongst the lot.
And now I have said it. I am a fool to tell you this, but you gave me your
word, sir&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is all right," Ravenspur said. "I shall keep it"</p>
<h2><a id="chap38" name="chap38">XXXVIII - IN THE HOUSE</a></h2>
<p>MEANWHILE, Walter was standing there in pitch darkness, utterly at a loss
what to do next. He had no light to guide him. He had not the remotest idea in
which direction the door lay. He took a step or two forward, with outstretched
hands, until his fingers touched the wall. There were so many unfamiliar
objects here that it was some little time before he felt his way with his
finger-tips to the door. He found it at length, and the knob yielded to his
touch. No sooner was he in the corridor than a dazzling flash confused and
mystified him. Before he could realise what had happened the light was gone,
and a pair of strong, sinewy arms were about his neck. He was taken utterly at
a disadvantage. Walter swayed backwards. He fell with a resounding crash on the
floor. A million stars danced before his eyes, and then he remembered no
more.</p>
<p>When he came to himself again he was lying in an armchair, to which he was
fastened by a maze of cords, wound cunningly about him. As his head became
clear and less confused, he realised that he was in a kind of library, the
walls of which were lined with books. Opposite him Silva was seated, with a
placid smile upon his face.</p>
<p>"I think we have met before," he said.</p>
<p>"I have had that advantage," Walter said grimly. "And now you will, perhaps,
be good enough to explain what you mean&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," Silva hissed. A sudden anger flared out of his eyes. "On the other
hand, the explanation comes from you. For the time being, at any rate, this
house is mine. I have paid for it, and I propose to spend my time quietly here
for the next month or two. I am hardly settled down here before you come along
in this unceremonious fashion and burgle the place. Why?" That you know quite
as well as I do," Walter retorted. Really, you are a man of amazing audacity.
Now don't you know that the law punishes people severely for this kind of
thing?"</p>
<p>"And what kind of thing do you allude to?"</p>
<p>"Why should you assume ignorance in that way? You know perfectly well what I
mean. To my certain knowledge you have made three attempts on the life of Lord
Ravenspur, and even that does not seem to be sufficient. Last night you managed
to lure Miss Vera Rayne away from London, and she is in this house at the
present moment. That she is detained here against her will I feel certain."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed," Silva sneered. "Would you like to search the house? If I give
you permission to go over the premises, will you be prepared to apologise and
go away without further delay?"</p>
<p>A cold chill crept up Walter's spine. The man spoke with such an air of
confidence and triumph that Walter began to feel that the mission had failed.
Beyond all question, Silva had discovered the plot, and already he had managed
to get Vera out of the way. The Italian could not be acting. His air was too
assured for that.</p>
<p>"We need not say anything about apologies," Walter said; "but if you can
prove to me that Miss Rayne is not in the house, why, then, for the present, at
any rate, I will not trouble you."</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Silva sneered. He rose from his chair and paced
up and down the room. "You have seen quite enough of me, sir, to give me credit
for not being altogether a fool. That was a very pretty scheme which you put up
this morning. And, really, your disguises were quite artistic. I will go so far
as to say that, in ordinary circumstances, they would have utterly puzzled me;
but, then, I am suspicious by nature. I regard it as more than a coincidence
that three strangers should come into my garden the very morning after I
had&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Abducted Miss Rayne," Walter said, as Silva hesitated. "Why make any bones
about it? We know that Miss Rayne came here. We, on our side, are not
altogether without intelligence."</p>
<p>"You are worthy antagonists," Silva said, with a sarcastic bow. "We will
assume, for the sake of argument, that Miss Rayne was here this morning,
though, mark you, I do not admit it. Then, three strangers come and make free
with my garden. It is possible, of course, that they are telling the truth, and
that they are honest men, devoted to the interests of their country. But, at
the same time, I asked myself a question. Then I followed these gentlemen, and
by the time I returned home I had a pretty shrewd idea who they were and what
they were after. How my suspicions are justified is proved by your presence
here this evening. Did you come alone?"</p>
<p>"That you must discover for yourself," Walter said.</p>
<p>The Italian's features suddenly darkened. He paused so close to Walter that
the latter could see the dilation of the pupils of his eyes. He shook with a
spasm of fury.</p>
<p>"I have no quarrel with you," he whispered hoarsely. "You are a fine fellow,
and I give you all the credit for your courage. But if you persist in bringing
yourself within the sphere of danger, then you must take the, consequences. Do
you suppose for a moment that I am afraid of my own life? Do you suppose that I
care what happens when my mission is accomplished? That mission is sacred to me
as your good name and religion are sacred to you. A man is to be removed, and
when he is out of the way my task is done. There is a proverb amongst you
English that it is as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb, and no man can
hang more than once, though he has a dozen murders to his account. Therefore,
if you stand in the way, I shall have no hesitation in sweeping you aside. Now
go away and trouble me no more. You will never see Miss Rayne again. In a few
hours from now she will be in the custody of the proper person to safeguard her
interests&mdash;her mother."</p>
<p>A retort trembled on Walter's lips, but he restrained himself.</p>
<p>"I am going to give you every opportunity," Silva went on. "I trust to your
honour. See here."</p>
<p>He whipped a knife from his pocket, and just for a second Walter's courage
was tried high; but the Italian meant no harm. He advanced and cut the cords,
so that a moment later Walter was free. It was impossible for the latter to
know what was going on in the mind of his companion. He did not know that a
sudden inspiration had come to Silva, and that the Italian had changed his
mind. For the first few minutes Valdo had recognised that he stood in a
position of considerable peril. Though he had suspected his visitors of the
early morning, he was lying to Walter when he declared that he had discovered
their identity. It was easy to be wise after the fact, and Silva was taking
every advantage of it. In his heart of hearts he really had not expected
anything quite so prompt as this. He could now see his danger. If Walter was
alone, then so far so good; but if there were others outside the house, then
Silva was more or less in a trap. The others might rush in at any moment and
hand him over to the police. Once in their hands, his fate was certain. He
would be charged with those attempts on the life of Lord Ravenspur. In all
probability he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which would result
in his death within the walls of a gaol.</p>
<p>But now, as time was going on, and there was no sign of disturbance outside,
Silva began to feel that he had only one man to deal with. It would not be a
difficult matter to persuade Walter and to prove to him that Vera was no longer
in the house, and the cunning Italian knew perfectly well that his skin was
safe until Lord Ravenspur and the others were satisfied that the girl had come
to no harm.</p>
<p>"We are on even terms again now," Silva went on. "In fact, the odds are in
your favour. I am not armed, and you are a stronger man than myself. If you
will wait a few moments I will go and get a candle, and then you shall see for
yourself that Miss Rayne is not in the house."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," Walter said coldly; "but I should prefer to accompany you.
Your word is hardly suffIcient."</p>
<p>Silva's eyes flashed, but he said nothing. The silence was getting awkward
when, at length, the Italian spoke once more.</p>
<p>"There is a candle outside on the landing," he said. "I will go and fetch
it. You will be able to see me all the way there and back. You English are
suspicious."</p>
<p>Silva threw the door wide open and strode out into the corridor. As he
struck a match and lighted the candle, Walter could dimly see up the next
flight of stairs. It was only for a moment, but he distinctly saw the outline
of a figure there, and a signal made by the waving of a white arm. It was with
difficulty that he repressed a cry. He now knew that the Italian had been lying
to him, and that Vera was in the house. When he glanced up again the figure had
vanished, and Walter dropped into the easy chair again. It seemed to him that
there was something in the signal which bade him to be cautious. Otherwise,
what was to prevent Vera coming down the stairs and appealing to Walter for his
protection?</p>
<p>Silva was, apparently, a long time getting the candle to bum to his
satisfaction. He seemed to be occupied in his task to the exclusion of
everything else. But there was a queer smile upon his face, for he had turned
in an unfortunate moment, and his quick eye had detected the figure at the top
of the stairs. In those few seconds he had made up his mind what to do. When he
came back into the library again there was something like a smile on his face.
He placed the candle on the table.</p>
<p>"And now, sir," he said almost gaily, "before I proceed to satisfy you that
your suspicions are unfounded, permit me to offer you my hospitality. I don't
know how you feel, but you look rather shaken, and I must apologise for the way
in which I threw you a little time ago; but you see, the average burglar is by
no means a welcome guest, and he has no right to expect to be received with
open arms. I must insist upon your accompanying me as far as the dining- room,
so that I may give you a glass of wine."</p>
<p>Walter hesitated, but only for a moment. He was feeling more shaken and
battered than he cared to own. Every now and again things grew misty before his
eyes, a feeling of deadly faintness came upon him. It seemed hours since he
entered the house, though little more than ten minutes had elapsed. He knew,
too, that he had a great fight before him yet with this wily unscrupulous
rascal. Silva must have some great card up his sleeve, or he would not have so
gaily denied that Vera was in the house, when all the time she was close at
hand. On the whole, Walter decided that he would be all the better for
accepting Silva's offer.</p>
<p>"That is very thoughtful of you," he said. "I shall be very glad of a
stimulant of some kind."</p>
<p>Once in the dining-room, Silva took a decanter from the sideboard and poured
out a glass of port. Walter took it almost greedily and gulped it down at a
draught. The wine seemed to soothe him. He sank down in a chair with his hands
over his eyers, and, before he knew where he was, he had sunk into a deep
sleep. As Silva bent over the unconscious body a hoarse laugh broke from his
lips. Then something seemed to sting and bum his cheek. He started back, to see
Vera standing before him.</p>
<p>"You scoundrel!" she cried. "You have murdered him!"</p>
<p>In her anger she cast all fear aside. She caught up a heavy decanter from
the sideboard and sent it crashing through the window. The whole house rang
with her cries for assistance.</p>
<h2><a id="chap39" name="chap39">XXXIX - THE HOUND AGAIN</a></h2>
<p>THE clamour ceased. Just for a moment an intense silence followed. Then
there came the murmur of voices from without and the crash of splintering wood.
Silva cursed himself for his folly. He had been so convinced that Walter had
come alone that he had not looked for this. There was no time to be lost. Silva
caught Vera as if she had been a feather-weight, and ran with her swiftly up
the stairs. It was the work of a moment to unlock a door, thrust her inside,
and then fasten the door once more. No sooner was this done than Silva was
downstairs again, with his hand on the lock of the back entrance of the house.
All this time he could hear the steady splintering of wood as an effort was
being made to force one of the drawing-room windows. Silva smiled to himself,
for here was the delay which was so essential to him. Once the attackers were
in the drawing-room, there would yet be another door to force before they were
upon him. He wished with all his heart that he had his revolver with him. But,
then, he had not expected so swift a vengeance as this, and he had come down
from town without any weapon at all. Still, it was idle to waste time in these
regrets, seeing that there was other and stern work before him.</p>
<p>The back entrance of the house was opened at last, and Silva sped back to
the dining-room. He half dragged, half carried Walter's unconscious body down
the garden path, until he reached a bed of asparagus, where he deposited his
burden. Panting with his exertions, he came back again to the house. He wiped
the beads of perspiration from his face. He reached eagerly for a glass of
wine, but not from the same decanter from which he had helped Walter. Then he
sat down coolly enough to smoke a cigarette till the enemy should put in an
appearance. A succession of sounds like pistol shots testified to the attack on
the drawing-room door, and a moment later the attacking force burst into the
dining-room.</p>
<p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," Silva said, with a smile. "But why have
you not come in the ordinary way? And now, perhaps, you will be good enough to
tell me what you are after?"</p>
<p>"You are wasting our time," Lord Ravenspur said sternly. "We are in search
of Miss Vera Rayne, as you know perfectly well. There is not the slightest
occasion to lie about it, because I heard her voice just now. Take us to her at
once."</p>
<p>"Your lordship's hearing is remarkably good," Silva sneered; "but the scream
of one angry woman is so like that of another that I am not prepared to agree
with your statement. However, as I appear to be only one to three of you, I
suppose you will have your own way and search the house."</p>
<p>"That most assuredly," Venables put in.</p>
<p>"Then I will make no attempt to stop you. I will stay here while you make
your search, and perhaps when you have found out that you are mistaken you will
apologise to me."</p>
<p>The speaker was perfectly cool and self possessed. With a wave of his hand
he intimated that the house was quite at the disposal of the intruders. He sat
there with his legs crossed, apparently in the enjoyment of a cigarette; but
when once the party had scattered his attitude changed entirely. He darted
across the hall and out into the garden. His task was not yet finished. There
was a deal to do before he could face his enemies again. He was not a bit
downcast, though his plot had partially failed, and though he knew now that
before long Vera Rayne would be in the hands of her friends again. All he
thirsted for now was a weapon by which he could take the vengeance for which he
had panted all these years. Slowly he dragged the unconscious body of his
victim in the direction of the little gate leading to the lane.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ravenspur and his companions were scattered over the house.
Ravenspur called Vera by name, and, to his great joy and relief, he heard her
answering cry from behind one of the bedroom doors. He was not surprised to
find the door locked. But that did not much matter now. Ravenspur flung himself
against the woodwork, and the door gave way with a crash. Then Vera rushed out
and threw herself, sobbing hysterically, into his arms.</p>
<p>"Never mind me," she cried. "Save him!"</p>
<p>"Of whom are you speaking?" Ravenspur asked.</p>
<p>"Why, Walter, of course," Vera went on. "I believe that dreadful man
poisoned him. He lured Walter into the dining-room and gave him a glass of
wine, and when I got there, he . . . Oh, it was too dreadful! Then I broke the
window and screamed for assistance, and you came in."</p>
<p>Ravenspur listened uneasily. In the excitement of the moment he had
forgotten all about Walter.</p>
<p>"Try and calm yourself," he said. "So much depends upon you now. Tell me all
that happened."</p>
<p>"I came down with that man last night," Vera said. "He brought me a letter
from my mother. I wanted to come, and I didn't want to come. I think you will
be able to understand my feelings. Then two of them drugged me and carried me
down here. It has been a dreadful time. I began to hope this morning, when I
saw you in the garden, and Walter gave me a kind of sign. I felt quite sure
then that you were not far off, and the knowledge gave me courage. I was locked
up in a room at the top of the house, but I managed to escape through a
trapdoor, and I was actually on the landing in the darkness when Walter came.
He was taken utterly by surprise by this man Silva, and I am sure that he was
terribly knocked about and shaken by a fall that he had had. Then I managed to
let Walter know that I was in the house. It was a daring thing to do, and Silva
must have seen it, though I did not think so at the moment. After that he got
Walter downstairs, under pretence of giving him a glass of wine, and then he
poisoned him. Oh, I am so distracted that I hardly know what I am speaking
about. It is dreadful to think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am quite sure you are mistaken," Ravenspur said. "This man Silva has no
quarrel with Walter, and when we come to get at the truth you will find that
there is no greater mischief than a comparatively harmless drug. But where is
Walter? Drugged or not, he certainly was not in the dining-room when we got
there just now."</p>
<p>"But he must be," Vera protested. "I saw him lying in an arm-chair, to all
appearances dead."</p>
<p>Ravenspur wasted no time in further argument. He went straight back to the
dining-room, but no signs of Walter were to be seen. Silva had disappeared
also. A strong draught was blowing from the open back door. Ravenspur began to
understand pretty well what had taken place. He turned eagerly to Vera.</p>
<p>"Come along with me," he exclaimed. "We are going into the garden. I shall
not be in the least surprised to find that Silva has dragged Walter out there.
He would have had plenty of time when we were breaking into the house. I
understand he is a man of considerable personal strength. Depend upon it, we
shall find him somewhere here. Don't be discouraged."</p>
<p>Vera was doing her best to keep from breaking down altogether. There was
something peculiarly horrible in the suggestion that her lover's body was lying
out there stark and stiff in the darkness. The fresh breeze blew gratefully on
her face. She began to feel a little more like herself again.</p>
<p>"We will get Perks here with his lantern presently," Lord Ravenspur said.
"Keep as near to the path as possible. If that fellow happens to have a knife
and sees me here, why&mdash;"</p>
<p>It was Lord Ravenspur's turn to shudder now, but he kept bravely on. He
opened his mouth to speak again.</p>
<p>when, suddenly a snarling roar like that of an angry lion broke out,
followed by the shrill scream of a human voice, calling in the last extremity
of agony. At the dreadful sound, Vera stood still.</p>
<p>"It is Bruno," Lord Ravenspur said hoarsely. "The dog is utterly out of
control. He has got hold of that Italian to a certainty. There may be time to
save his life yet."</p>
<h2><a id="chap40" name="chap40">XL - BBOKEN WINGS</a></h2>
<p>THE hoarse yell for assistance rose yet again, thb time more feeble than
before. It was honibk to stand there in the darkness, looking helplessly around
and trying to locate the direction from which the call came. It was honibk,
too, to listen to the mumbling and snarling of the dog, just as if he were
worrying a bone. Vera dung terrified to Lord Ravenspur. It was in vain that the
latter whistkd and called to the dog.</p>
<p>"We must have a light here," he said hoarsely. "There is no other way of
discovering where the trouble lies. Fool that I was not to think of it before.
That man. Perks, has a lantern."</p>
<p>Ravenspur strode badk to the house again, and yelled aloud for Perks and his
lantern.</p>
<p>"What is wrong?" Venabks demanded.</p>
<p>"Oh, youll see soon enough," Ravenspur said grimly. "For heaven's sake,
bring Perks here with the lantern. Unless I am greatly mistaken, our troubles
are over as far as the Italian is concerned. Bruno has got hold of him."</p>
<p>They all raced together down the garden path in iVe direction of the gate.
There was no mistaking where the trouble lay, for that mumbling snarl was close
at hand now. It seemed to proceed from the foot of a tree. Even Perks, hardened
as he was, shuddered and turned pale as the shining disc of the lantern showed
a picture so horrible and revolting that Perks staggered back.</p>
<p>"Take the young lady away sir," he said. "This is no place for her. You go
back to the house, and leave Lord Ravenspur to carry this poor chap back again.
We can't tackle the dog urdess there is someone here who knows him."</p>
<p>One glance at the prostrate body, and Venables turned away without further
question. Obviously Perks was right, and assuredly it was no place for Vera.
Silva lay there on the broad of his back, his arms thrown out, and crouched
upon his body was the enormous weight of the dog. The pressure in itself was
enough to cause suffocation. But the mischief lay in the terrible gash in the
throat where the hound's teeth had met. Bruno crouched there now with evil,
bloodshot eyes; a long, deep terrifying growl came steadily and persistently.
Perks drew cautiously near.</p>
<p>"Well, if this doesn't beat everything," he said."</p>
<p>"Why, there are two bodies. One of them is Mr. Lance."</p>
<p>"That is the cause of all the mischief, as you will see presently,"
Ravenspur explained. "Never mind about my nephew for a moment. Unless I am
greatly mistaken, there is very little the matter with him. But this poor
fellow is in a different condition altogether."</p>
<p>As he spoke, Ravenspur stepped forward, and gave Bruno a tremendous blow
with a stick which be had pulled from the hedgeside. At the same time he
uttered a few words in a harsh tone, and immediately the dog slunk away and
crossed the road. His tail was between his legs now, his attitude one of deep
dejection.</p>
<p>"I will deal with him presently," Ravenspur went on. "You take the head, and
I'll take the feet, and we'll get this poor fellow back to the house again. It
is a terrible business altogether, but, mind you, that dog is not very much to
blame. As far as I can make out, what has happened is this: Silva managed to
drug my nephew, and was getting his body out of the way when he accidentally
came in contact with the dog. And if there is one human being more than another
to whom Bruno is devoted, that person is my nephew. The dog would scent him at
once, and&mdash;well, the rest you can imagine."</p>
<p>They conveyed the unconscious body of Silva upstairs, and laid him on a bed.
Once Walter had been brought under cover also, there was only one thing to be
done, and that was to send for a doctor without delay. It was obvious enough to
Ravenspur and his companions that Silva's wounds were exceedingly critical. The
throat seemed to be almost bitten away. The man had lost a deal of blood. He
lay there absolutely unconscious. His swarthy features were deadly pale. It was
impossible to say whether he breathed or not.</p>
<p>"You leave the doctor to me," Perks said. "I know the neighbourhood. I can
be back here well within the hour."</p>
<p>The doctor came at length. He shook his head seriously after he had made his
examination.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, recovery is possible," he said; "whilst there is life there
is always hope. But if this man pulls round it will be little less than a
miracle. How did it happen?"</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to explain. After all, it would be more or less
impossible to avoid the scandal now. But nothing was said as to the real cause
of the accident, nor did Ravenspur deem it prudent to ask the doctor's advice
as to the best thing to do with Walter.</p>
<p>"Will the poor fellow recover consciousness?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That is quite possible," the doctor replied. "He has a splendid
constitution, and possibly may linger on for some days. He can take no direct
nourishment, of course. But medical science can do so much now-a-days in the
way of injections. I shouldn't be at all surprised if my patient were able to
give an account of what has happened. But in all human probability, he will be
in his grave before the week is out. And now, will you leave it to me to obtain
a nurse, or would you like to send one of your own?"</p>
<p>On the whole, it would be better to leave it to the doctor, Ravenspur
thought. An hour or so passed, and the nurse was established in the sick-room.
It was now getting towards daylight, but no one thought of rest or sleep. There
was nothing for it but to make the best of the extraordinary situation; nothing
for it but to remain where they were and explain as well as they could to the
servants when they came back in the morning. Vera flimg herself down upon a
couch in the drawing-room, and closed her eyes. She was tired and worn out,
though it seemed to her that sleep was impossible. Nevertheless, when she came
to herself again the sunshine was streaming into the room, the birds were
singing noisily in the trees outside. On the lawn Ravenspur was walking up and
down in grave consultation with Venables. Presently, Vera saw Walter join the
group. He looked dreadfully white and haggard; his head was bent, and his step
was shaky. A thrill of thankfulness passed over her. She had never hoped to see
him walk again. As Vera left the drawing-room and crossed the hall, a
maid-servant looked at her curiously. Vera advanced with a smile.</p>
<p>"I am afraid we have greatly distressed you," she said. "But perhaps you
already know exactly what has happened?"</p>
<p>"'His lordship explained to me, miss," the girl said timidly. "' I
understand that my new master is a friend of yours. You were coming down to see
him, and a great dog attacked him."</p>
<p>"Yes; that is so," Vera said, relieved to find that she had to make no
prevarication. "And now, if you will be so good, you might show me to a bedroom
where I can wash."</p>
<p>The maid seemed to antidpate such a request, for she led the way up the
stairs to one of the bedrooms. Vera wondered what the maid would have said
could she only have looked into the room at the top of the house under the
roof. Feeling much fresher and brighter from the touch of cold water. Vera went
down and joined the other two in the garden.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you looking none the worse for your adventure," Ravenspur
said. "I have managed to convince the servants that our appearance here b quite
natural. One had to tell a few falsehoods, but in the drcumstanoes it was
necessary. Still, servants are susjHcious creatures, and I don't want their
curiosity to go too far. Already they are wondering where the mistress of the
house is, so that there is no help for it, and we must have your mother here
without delay. Do you happen to know her London address?"</p>
<p>"No; I don't," Vera replied. "I saw her for an hour last night."</p>
<p>"What, down here?" Walter exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes; she came here on purpose to see me. She only stayed a little time,
because I understood that it was necessary for her to be back in London again.
But I would rather not talk about that if you don't mind. You will quite
understand why."</p>
<p>Walter murmured something in reply. Then his face brightened.</p>
<p>"You are quite right, imcle," he said. "It is absolutely necessary that the
Countess Flavio should be here at once. We can get her address from Mrs.
Delahay. If you like I will go up myself."</p>
<p>Do you feel equal to it?" Vera asked anxiously. Oh, I'm all right now,"
Walter said, "with the exception of a certain shakiness and a splitting
headache. It must have been a pretty severe dose that our interesting friend
gave me last night. But I don't think there is any occasion to worry about
me."</p>
<p>"Then we will have some breakfast, and get up to London at once," Venables
said, in his quick, decisive fashion. "We can leave Lord Ravenspur and Miss
Bayne here till we come back. I don't think that Lord Ravenspur has anything to
fear from his enemy now."</p>
<p>Breakfast was despatched without delay, and immediately Venabks and Walter
left for London. The house was now quiet and still, for as yet practically
nothing was known as to the cause of Silva's action, and public curiosity still
slept.</p>
<p>It was some time after luncheon before Vera had a chance of speaking to the
nurse, with an inquiry as to how the patient was getting on. The nurse smiled
in reply.</p>
<p>"He is slightly better," she explained; "in fact, he is as well as he is
likely to be. He has been conscious for the last half hour. He seems to want
something, only I can't understand what it is. We may be able to find out when
the doctor comes."</p>
<h2><a id="chap41" name="chap41">XLI - A RAY OF LIGHT</a></h2>
<p>IT was no difficult matter to find Mrs. Delahay, who, when the late
startling developments were laid before her, made no demur in giving her
sister's address. Maria Delahay was looking just as pale and haggard as usual.
It seemed impossible to rouse her from the state of apathy into which she had
fallen. TWien the two friends were standing on the steps of the hotel they ran
against Inspector Dallas.</p>
<p>Any fresh news?" Walter asked.</p>
<p>"Well, no," Dallas admitted. "I am simply waiting on events at present. If
you could only get Mrs. Delahay to be more candid with me it might save her a
deal of unpleasantness in the long run."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that she is in danger?" Venables asked.</p>
<p>"I think you can see that for yourself, sir," Dallas replied. "Naturally, I
am hesitating as long as possible&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then hesitate a little longer," Walter said. "Quite by accident Lord
Ravenspur has stumbled upon a clue which I think will astonish you when you
come to know his story. We are going off now to a place called Cannon Green. We
shall probably be back by the last train to-night, and I want you to meet us at
Waterloo Station. I think you will be well rewarded for your trouble."</p>
<p>Dallas promised, and, like the wise man he was, asked no questions. The two
companions proceeded in a cab to Isleworth Road, where they asked to see the
mistress of the house. The maid who answered the door was somewhat reticent,
but she admitted that her mistress was at home, whereupon Walter and his
companion entered without further ceremony. Perhaps their manner impressed the
maid, for she came back a moment later saying that her mistress would see the
visitors. The Countess entered the drawing-room and glared with cold
displeasure at the intruders.</p>
<p>"What can you possibly want with me?" she demanded.</p>
<p>Perhaps I had better explain," Walter began. My name is Lance, and I am a
nephew of Lord Ravenspur. Lord Ravenspur has a ward who is called Miss Vera
Rayne. In other words, I understand that Miss Rayne is really your
daughter."</p>
<p>The Countess's cold face flushed slightly. I am not prepared to contradict
you," she said. My dear madam," Walter said, "this is no time for diplomacy.
Rightly or wrongly, my uncle came to Italy eighteen years ago and kidnapped
your daughter. You see, I am quite candid, and I hope you will be good enough
to be as candid in your replies. My uncle will himself explain why he took this
bold step, but <i>I</i> understand that your late husband did not consider you
a desirable parent for a child, and he made my uncle promise to remove the
child from your influence. Into the morality of that question I am not disposed
to go. For nearly eighteen years nothing happened, and my uncle began to regard
Vera quite as his own child. Then the truth came out, and some emissary of
yours came to England, prepared to go to any length to regain possession of
your daughter. I need not say I am alluding to the man called Silva, also known
to many people as Valdo, the flying man. This servant of yours made no fewer
than three attacks on my uncle's life, none of which, fortunately, was
successful. And then, I understand, you came on the scene. I believe you were
instrumental before last, and getting her imprisoned at a place called Cannon
Green. One moment, please. I would not deny it, if I were you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not going to deny it," the Countess said in a hard, dry voice. "There
is no occasion to."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, that being so, we shall get on all the better. Directly we
discovered what had happened we set off in pursuit, fortunately aided by a
bloodhound of my uncle's, who had followed us to Lady Ringmar's from Park Lane.
To make a long story short, we broke into the house, and Miss Rayne is once
more under the protection of Lord Ravenspur. But your man, Silva, does not lack
resource, and he managed to drug me and drag me out into the garden.
Unfortunately for him, the dog was prowling about, and, knowing me and
recognising my peril, he made a furious attack upon Silva, with the result that
your friend lies in a critical condition and is not expected to live. After
what I have told you, I think you will see the necessity of coming down to
Cannon Green with us without delay."</p>
<p>During this recital the Countess made no sign. She listened with a calmness
and unconcern which moved Walter to anger. After all, whatever Silva's faults
might have been, his devotion to his mistress left nothing to be desired. The
Countess sat thoughtfully for a few moments before she replied.</p>
<p>"I think I see what you mean," she said presently. "You want as far as
possible to avoid a scandal?"</p>
<p>"Well, naturally," Walter said warmly. "In your daughter's interests it is
your duty to assist us. If you fall in line with this idea, the general public
will be none the wiser. And when you come to know what manner of man it is that
your servant has been attempting to murder in absolutely cold blood&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what manner of man he is," the Countess cried. "He is the same
manner of man as my husband. And a more cold-blooded scoundrel never drew the
breath of life. But make no mistake about one thing&mdash;I was a party to no
violence. All I wanted was to have my child back again, and I hoped that when
once this was done, I should be able to induce Silva to forego the vengeance
which to him was a part of his religion. You will understand presently why I
have appeared to act so strangely. Not but what Lord Ravenspur deserved
whatever fate he got at the hands of Silva. Still, we are wasting time in
talking like this. I am ready to come with you to Cannon Green at once, more
especially because you are right in saying that it is my duty to try %nd avoid
anything in the shape of a scandal. If you will give me five minutes and call a
cab, I am absolutely at your service."</p>
<p>It was a little before five when this strangely assorted group reached
Cannon Green. The doctor was just coming away, and Walter asked eagerly after
the patient.</p>
<p>"Oh, practically he is no better," the medical man explained. "I mean, he
isn't going to get well. Just for the present he is buoyed up with a strong
stimulant, and is in full possession of his faculties. He seems to want
something, but I can't make out what it is. We gave him a sheet of paper and a
pencil just now, and he scribbled a word or two, which, being Italian, we could
not make out."</p>
<p>"I think I know what he wants," Walter said. "May I suggest, Countess, that
you go up to the poor man's bedroom at once?"</p>
<p>Silva's face lighted up as his eyes fell upon his mistress. He pointed to
the bandages about his throat. His lips moved, but no sound came from them.</p>
<p>"I know exactly what has happened," the Countess said. "No, pray don't
distress yourself. You must not try your strength. You will never get better if
you exert yourself."</p>
<p>A melancholy smile came over Silva's face. The expression of his eyes told
as plainly as possible that he had no delusions on the score of his recovery.
Then he went through the motion of writing with an imaginary pencil upon an
invisible paper. Countess Flavio turned impulsively to the nurse.</p>
<p>"Is it quite safe?" she asked. "I don't think the poor fellow will rest till
he makes me understand; and you see, being Italian myself, anything he may
write&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think it will be a very good thing," the nurse replied.</p>
<p>She came to the bedside with a sheet of paper and a pencil, which she placed
in Silva's hand. His unsteady fingers began to trace certain signs on the
paper. The marks were feeble and straggling enough, but a little care on the
part of the Countess enabled her to make out what the characters
represented.</p>
<p>"It is quite plain to me now," she said, looking down into Silva's eager
face. "You want me to find the diary, do you not? You mean the Count's diary,
which was not produced at the trial?"</p>
<p>Silva nodded feebly. Evidently he was fast lapsing into unconsciousness
again. But with an effort he managed to concentrate his mind upon what the
Countess was saying.</p>
<p>"The diary is locked up in a little desk in your bedroom," the Countess went
on. "I am to find it and give it to Mr. Walter Lance to read. My good Silva,
this is most extraordinary! What possible interest could Mr. Lance take in that
diary? Are you quite sure that you have not made a mistake?"</p>
<p>Again Silva opened his eyes and nodded almost vigorously.</p>
<p>"Very well," the Countess said reluctantly. "I see you are in earnest. I
will get the diary at once, and Mr. Lance shall have it without delay. If there
is anything more&mdash;"</p>
<p>It was idle to speak to Silva any longer. Just for an instant a smile
flickered over his face, and then he was completely lost to the world and his
surroundings. Puzzled and mystified, the Countess crept from the room. Silva
had made this request on what was practically his dying bed, and he must be
obeyed. What good it would do at this moment the Countess was quite at a loss
to see. She found the little desk presently and broke it open. Inside lay a
small parchment-covered volume with gilt lettering on the outside. With this in
her hand the Countess Flavio walked out on to the lawn where Walter was
strolling up and down and accosted him.</p>
<p>"This is for you," she said. "I don't know why, but Silva told me to deliver
it into your hands, and perhaps when you have read it you will have a different
opInion of Vera's mother."</p>
<h2><a id="chap42" name="chap42">XLII - RUN TO EARTH</a></h2>
<p>WITHOUT waiting for a reply the Countess turned away, and went back into the
house again. In the drawing-room Vera was seated, talking earnestly to Lord
Ravenspur. There was an awkward pause as the Countess Flavio entered the room.
Then Vera rose with a crimson face, and came in the direction of her
mother.</p>
<p>"I suppose there is no occasion," she said, "to introduce you to one
another, though it is so many years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have never seen Lord Ravenspur before in my life," the Countess said
coldly, "and I am quite sure that he has never seen me, either. We are absolute
strangers."</p>
<p>"But I thought," Vera stammered, "that Lord Ravenspur and yourself&mdash;Oh,
I don't know what I thought."</p>
<p>The girl paused abruptly, conscious that she was saying too much. For some
time past she had been hugging what appeared to be a shameful secret to her
breast. Her face paled with remorse now when she thought how she had misjudged
these two people. But the embarrassment was not all Vera's, for Ravenspur was
looking unhappy and uncomfortable. Only the Countess appeared to retain her
cold self-possession. For some time no one spoke.</p>
<p>"Sooner or later, I suppose, I shall be entitled to an explanation," the
Countess said at length. "It is now eighteen years since I was cruelly deprived
of my child. It is just possible that Lord Ravenspur can explain his
extraordinary conduct."</p>
<p>"I think I might manage to do that if we were alone," Ravenspur replied.
"But, after all, you are Vera's mother, and what I have to say I could not
utter in the child's hearing. Oh, I know that sounds like a cowardly remark,
but my conscience tells me that I am only doing what is right."</p>
<p>Vera rose as if to go, but Ravenspur stretched out a hand and detained her.
There was a determined look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Not yet," he said; "there will be time for that later on. After dinner, if
the Countess will give me the honour of an interview, I may be able to satisfy
her that I am not the scoundrel she takes me to be. There are always two sides
to a question."</p>
<p>"Yes, where the man is concerned," the Countess said coldly. "Let us hope in
this case the same remark will apply to the woman&mdash;that is, if you are
prepared to admit that I am a woman."</p>
<p>Ravenspur murmured something in reply. It seemed to him only right that
mother and daughter should be alone. And, besides, he wanted to think the
situation over. He had formed his own opinion of the Countess. He had
implicitly believed all that his late friend Flavio had told him about his
wife. He had anticipated something quite different to this. The woman was cold
and self-contained and haughty, and yet Ravenspur could see nothing in her face
to which he could take exception. Flavio had spoken of her as a fiend, a
creature who had no title to the name of woman. His pictures had been glowing
and full of colour. And now, before a word had been spoken, Ravenspur began to
have his doubts. And how like the Countess was to Mrs. Delahay. As Ravenspur
paced up and down the lawn, he began to see a little light in dark places. He
was still turning the matter over in his mind when Walter and Venables came out
of the house.</p>
<p>"Where are you going now?" Ravenspur asked. "What is that thing that you
have in your hand?"</p>
<p>"It is a new collar and dog-chain," Walter explained. "It suddenly occurred
to Venables just now that we had seen nothing of Bruno all day. I have been
whistling for him for half an hour, and though I am almost certain he is hiding
somewhere in the bracken on the common, I can't get him to answer the
call."</p>
<p>"Probably afraid of a good thrashing for his work last night," Ravenspur
murmured. "But you must manage to get hold of him, Walter. It will never do for
a big hound like that to be roaming about the common. Those dogs are all right
when they are well fed. But if the beast gets really hungry I wouldn't answer
for the consequences. Whatever else happens, or whatever is neglected, you must
find Bruno, and that at once."</p>
<p>Walter and Venables went off in the direction of the common, and for the
next couple of hours sought everywhere for the dog. It seemed to them they
could hear him every now and then. Presently Venables caught sight of his lean,
dark-brown side as he crouched behind a great thicket of gorse. Walter called
softly, and held a biscuit out in the direction of the bush. Then slowly, with
his body bent to the ground and his head hung down, the great beast came, and
Walter slipped the collar round his neck. He had hardly congratulated himself
upon his success when a hollow groan close by attracted his attention. He
turned eagerly to Venables.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I heard it," the latter said with a smile. "Can't you guess who it
is? I declare I had absolute forgotten all about him. Unless I am greatly
mistaken, that is our friend Stevens whom Perks tied up so neatly and
artistically last night."</p>
<p>It was precisely as Venables had said. Stevens lay there groaning and
shivering, quite helpless and almost unable to move. Even after his bonds were
cut away it was some time before he had strength to rise. His teeth were
chattering with the cold, although the day was quite a warm one. He was a mass
of cramps and aches from head to feet. When once his blood began to stir again,
he turned an angry face in the direction of his rescuers.</p>
<p>"Oh, you need not laugh," he said. "It is no laughing matter. I'll have the
law against you for this, see if I don't."</p>
<p>"We will talk about that presently," said Venables coolly. "In the meantime,
you had better come as far as the house and have something to eat. And you will
be wise if you say nothing, or know nothing, of what happened last night. Your
accomplice, Silva, lies in bed at the point of death, so you have nothing to
fear from him. If you had gone straight with us, you would not have fallen into
this sorry plight. Have you got any money?"</p>
<p>"I spent it all in coming down last night," Stevens said.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, we'll see you back to town again," Walter replied. "Meanwhile, we
have other work to do. We will take you to the house and see that you are
properly fed, and then you can kill time as best you can for the evening. You
can return by the last train."</p>
<p>It was dark before Stevens reached the station with the few shillings in his
pocket necessary to get him back to London again. As he stepped into a
third-class carriage he did not realise that Walter and Venables were taking
their places at the end of the train. It was just the same at Waterloo Station,
where Stevens got out, and a moment later he was being followed by the pair,
who had been joined now by Dallas.</p>
<p>"What is the game, gentlemen?" the Inspector asked. "Surely that man is the
witness Stevens who gave such startling evidence at the Delahay inquest?"</p>
<p>"That is right enough," Walter said. "We are going to follow him and see
where he goes to. Unless I am greatly mistaken, he can give you a great deal
more information than he did at the inquest. And now, perhaps, I had better
tell you of the discovery which Lord Ravenspur made last night. But, before
doing that, I want to know if you missed anything from Mr. Delahay's studio.
For instance, did you find a watch on the body?"</p>
<p>"There was no watch," Dallas said, after a moment's thought. "We found a
purse in his trousers pocket with some gold in it, but nothing besides. Was he
wearing a watch?"</p>
<p>"I am sure if you ask Mrs. Delahay she will tell you so," Walter replied.
"He was wearing a watch and chain, and on the chain was an ornament which my
uncle had given him. My uncle bought that ornament yesterday from a man who is
obviously a receiver of stolen goods, and that ornament was sold to the shady
individual in question by John Stevens. In proof of what I say, here it
is."</p>
<p>Dallas' eyes gleamed as he took the trinket in his hand. He said no more as
he walked thoughtfully by the side of his companions, till at length Stevens
turned into a shady street, where he entered a dingy public-house. Without the
slightest hesitation Dallas followed. He had quite made up his mind what he was
going to do. For the time being, at any rate, the public-house was empty.
Stevens was sitting in an armchair behind a partition with a glass in his hand.
He started and his face changed colour as his eyes fell upon Dallas. The
Inspector's manner was genial enough, but there was a grimness on his face that
Stevens did not relish.</p>
<p>What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he stammered. Well, unless I am greatly
mistaken, you can do a great deal," Dallas replied. "That matter of the Delahay
murder, you know. You remember what you told us at the inquest?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and every word of it was true," Stevens said tremulously. "If it is
the last word I ever say, it was true."</p>
<p>"And I believe it," Dallas went on. "The only fault I find in your evidence
is that you did not tell us enough. Why didn't you finish your story while you
were about it?"</p>
<p>Stevens looked stealthily at his tormentor. He gulped his glass of liquor
down hastily, for there was a queer dryness at the back of his throat that
almost choked him.</p>
<p>"Come," Dallas said, with a quick and sudden sternness. "Speak out, or it
will be all the worse for you. Tell us who it was who murdered Mr. Louis
Delahay?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap43" name="chap43">XLIII - THE WHOLE TRUTH</a></h2>
<p>STEVENS stared helplessly at the speaker. He tried to speak, but his jaw
dropped. He mumbled something that was quite impossible to understand. But, at
the same time, he recognised the peril of his position. There was a ghastly
green tinge on his face, his hand trembled. Dallas regarded him pleasantly
enough. There was nothing harsh or stern in the detective's manner. His quiet
air of assured triumph struck a greater terror into Stevens than any sternness
would have done. The shabby little man wriggled about in his seat looking very
much like a rat behind the bars of a cage.</p>
<p>"Take your time," Dallas said quietly. "You will find in the long run that
it will pay you a great deal better to tell the truth."</p>
<p>I have always told the truth," Stevens stammered.</p>
<p>Up to a certain point, yes. But you didn't go far enough. For instance, you
might have told the coroner that you saw Mr. Delahay's lady visitor a second
time. You might have gone further, and told the court that Mr. Delahay had
other visitors long after his first one had gone. You see, that would have
helped the police a good deal, and it would have effectually cleared an
innocent lady whom we suspected, of having a hand in the murder. Now who was it
that called at the studio in the early hours of the morning?"</p>
<p>How should I know?" Stevens said sullenly. That, my good man, is for you to
say. But you need not answer unless you like. It so happens that you are
waiting here for the individual in question this very moment."</p>
<p>The greenish hue crept over Stevens' face again. He could only stare at the
speaker with open-mouthed astonishment. Dallas' manner grew a little more stern
and curt as he rose from his seat.</p>
<p>"You will stay where you are," he said, "and with these two gentlemen I will
go into the next box. I think I can trust you not to betray our presence there.
In fact, your safety, to a large extent, depends upon your actions in the next
hour or so."</p>
<p>"I have done nothing," Stevens burst out. "I swear I have done nothing. I
had no hand in it at all."</p>
<p>"That I quite believe," Dallas replied. "It was afterwards that you began to
see your way to make some money out of it. And now let me tell you something.
You don't deserve any consideration at my hands, but I am prepared to spare you
as far as possible. Oh, I know you will play me false at the first chance. But
let me tell you, I know all about your visit to your friend. Perks, of Cannon
Green. I know how you disposed of certain stolen goods which, until the night
of the murder, were in the possession of Mr. Louis Delahay. After that, I don't
think you will deem it prudent to try any of your nonsense with me."</p>
<p>Dallas turned away, and, with his two companions, entered the next box. It
was gloomy enough there, so that their presence was not likely to be detected
by anyone who came in. Walter turned eagerly to Dallas. His curiosity was
aroused now. He wanted to know how it was that the inspector knew so much.</p>
<p>It was mere conjecture on my part," Dallas said.</p>
<p>Of course, what you told me gave me a great deal of assistance; but I did
not begin to see my way quite clearly until we followed Stevens here. The
landlord of this public-house has never got into trouble as yet. But we know
perfectly well that a good deal of stolen property is disposed of, and when I
saw Stevens turn in here, things became plain enough. He was coming to meet his
accomplice, and hand over his share of the money which he had obtained from
Perks. Before half an hour is over, the real culprit will be here. Please stop
talking directly anybody comes in. It will spoil everything if our presence
here becomes known."</p>
<p>It was precisely as Dallas had said. Some twenty minutes later a man lounged
into the bar and called for something to drink. He seemed to suspect nothing,
he appeared to be perfectly at his ease. He whistled some music-hall air
merrily. The man was fairly well-dressed. A gaudy cap on the back of his head
disclosed a plaster of greasy curls on a peculiarly low and retreating
forehead. The stranger might have been a street hawker in his best clothes.
Certainly he did not suggest a professional criminal.</p>
<p>He swallowed his drink and strolled towards the fireplace without noticing
the three occupants in the recesses of the box. Then he caught sight of
Stevens, and took a seat by his side. The conversation was conducted in
whispers, but it was possible for the listeners to hear most of what was taking
place.</p>
<p>"Well, did you manage it all right?" the newcomer asked.</p>
<p>"Don't trouble about that," Stevens muttered. "But I didn't get half as much
as you thought I should. Forty pounds was the price my man offered, and he
wouldn't give another penny."</p>
<p>The newcomer growled something incoherent. Then there was a chink of money
stealthily passed, followed by a volley of oaths from Stevens' companion.</p>
<p>The game isn't worth playing," he muttered. Fancy, twenty quid for a job
like that, and the chance of hanging into the bargain. I wish I had never gone
there, John. I wish I had never met you that night, when you told me all about
the house in Fitzjohn Square. I wake up in the night in a bath of cold sweat
when I think of it. Fancy going into what you take to be an empty house, and
finding a dead body staring up in your face from the floor! Yes, I took his
watch and chain all right, but I don't know where I got the pluck from. Took
the risk of being strung up for it, bli'me! And me ready to get married, and
the date fixed and all! Lord, if I could only see my way to get clear of it
all! Twenty quid against a man's life! You go and try it yourself, and see what
it's like, my ancient pal. When I recollect as it was you as told me of the
broken catch on the studio window, I could bash your face in, I could. I can't
forget it. I have tried drink, but that is no use. back worse than ever. And
all for the sake of twenty quid!"</p>
<p>Stevens made no reply. He sat there quivering from head to foot, sick with
suspense and anxiety, wondering in his mind when Dallas was going to strike. At
any other time the ghastly colour of his face would have attracted the
attention of his companion, but the other man was occupied with his own
thoughts. He was staring moodily into the fireplace.</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it," Stevens managed to say at length. "If you had told me
about it at the time, I never should have touched that stuff. But I had got it
in my pocket, and I had given my word before ever I had heard of the murder.
And how was I to know that there was a chance of Mr. Delahay coming back? K
anything happens you will say as much for me, won't you?"</p>
<p>Stevens asked the question with trembling eagerness. He made his request
more with a view to impressing Dallas than anything else. But the culprit by
his side, apparently, had no idea of the drift of , the question, or why it was
asked.</p>
<p>Oh, you have nothing to fear," he said moodily. At least, it is all right as
long as that stuff isn't traced. But what is the use of sitting here jawing
like this? Let us go to a music-hall or theatre or something of that
kind&mdash;anything to get away from one's thoughts. Every now and
again&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker rose to his feet, and Stevens dragged his trembling limbs from
the settee. At the same moment, Dallas appeared upon the scene and touched the
stranger lightly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"I hope you know who I am," he said.</p>
<p>The other man heaved a sigh, which sounded almost like relief. Just for a
moment all the blood left his face. Then he recovered himself and looked at
Dallas steadily.</p>
<p>"Dallas, of Scotland Yard," he said "Oh, I know you well enough, sir, and I
expect you know me."</p>
<p>"Name of Cooney," Dallas said briskly. "Jim Cooney. I arrest you for
burglary at the residence of Mr. Louis Delahay, in Fitzjohn Square."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right enough," Cooney said. "I am not going to complain. Upon
my word, I am glad it is over. If you just let me have a cigarette and another
drink I'll tell you all about it; and a nice sort of pal you are, Stevens. Oh,
I'd give something to have you for five minutes to myself. You sneaking
rat!"</p>
<p>"I couldn't help myself," Stevens whined. "Upon my word, I couldn't.
Besides, what does it matter? Inspector Dallas knows all about it. He even knew
you were coming here to-night, though I swear he never had a single hint from
me. Isn't that so. Inspector? Am I telling the truth, or am I a liar?"</p>
<p>"It is perfectly true, Cooney," Dallas explained. "I followed Stevens here,
knowing quite well that he was waiting for you."</p>
<p>The assurance seemed to be sufficient, for Cooney asked no further
questions. Nor was it for Dallas to explain that, till a few moments ago, he
had no idea of the real identity of the man whom Stevens had come to meet
Cooney took a long whiff of his cigarette and pitched the end of it into the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"I am quite ready for you now," he said, "and I'll tell you all about it if
you like. Oh, I know everything I say will be taken down in evidence against
me; but it is little I mind that. I plundered the dead body of Mr. Delahay, all
right. He was dead when I got there, and if I didn't tell you so, you overheard
enough to jug me half a dozen times. Don't look at me like that Mr. Dallas,
sir. Don't think as I had. any hand in the murder, sir. May I die if I ain't as
innocent of that as a kid."</p>
<p>"Better not say too much," Dallas suggested. "Really, I am not curious to
hear. And now, come along. You can have a cab if you like. Perhaps you may come
out of this better than you expect&mdash;if you are only candid."</p>
<p>"Don't be in a hurry," Cooney pleaded. "I'll tell you everything, sir, I
will&mdash;straight&mdash;everything from start to finish. Sit down and listen
to me; and you need not be afraid that I shall try and escape. I don't want
to."</p>
<h2><a id="chap44" name="chap44">XLIV - THE STORY OF A CRIME</a></h2>
<p>DALLAS shrugged his shoulders indifferently. Truth to tell he was both
annoyed and disappointed. He had looked forward with every assurance to laying
his hand on the actual culprit in the person of Cooney. As it was now, the
whole thing looked like beginning all over again. A suspicion of the real truth
was dawning on his mind.</p>
<p>"It was like this," Cooney said, in a harsh, strained voice. "I have been
pretty short of a job for some time, and I promised to pay for a lot of
furniture I bought for my house by a given time. I had the stuff on the
hire-purchase system, and I knew precious well what would happen if I did not
keep the instalments up. I had only a day or two to spare, and I was getting
pretty anxious. That same evening I met Stevens in a public house. I hadn't
seen him for some time, and, naturally enough, I asked him what he had been
doing. Then he told me that on behalf of a party, whose name he didn't mention,
he had been shadowing a certain house in Fitzjohn Square. I wasn't particularly
interested until he let out that he could tell me a good deal about the houses
there, and how some of them would be easy work for the likes of a chap such as
me, for instance. Then I asks a few questions, and hears all about Mr.
Delahay's studio. Thinks I to myself, here's a bit of luck for you, Jim Cooney.
I had all the information I wanted. The next night I goes round and has a look
at the studio. The thing was as easy as eating your dinner. I waited till it
got pretty late, and then I got into the house from the back. When I did get
there, I was rather alarmed to see a light in the studio. I crept along to the
door, and looked in. You can imagine my surprise when I saw a gentleman
painting there. When I looked at him again I had no difficulty in recognising
Lord Ravenspur.</p>
<p>"What he was doing there, I don't know. But seeing it wasn't his own house,
I reckoned he wasn't likely to stay long, so I just sat down to wait patiently
for such a time as I could have the place to myself. It wasn't more than an
hour before I heard the door open, and two other people came in. They were a
lady and a gentleman, but who the lady was I don't know from Adam. The
gentleman, as you will guess, was Mr. Delahay himself. I suppose the lady was
really Mrs. Delahay, too; I mean, the woman who is suspected of the murder. But
I am getting a bit away from the point. I had hardly time to hide myself behind
a recess with a curtain in front of it before the newcomers came into the hall
and began to talk. They were conversing more or less in whispers, so that I
could not follow very well, but I could see that they were annoyed to find Lord
Ravenspur there, and they were casting about for some means of getting rid of
him. Presently the lady said something about the light and the cable, and the
gentleman seemed to fall in with her suggestion. Anyway, I saw him take a knife
from his pocket and go down into the basement. A moment later the whole place
was plunged in darkness&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean that the cable was cut?" Dallas asked. "Well, I am glad that
mystery is cleared up. I am bound to tell you, gentlemen, that that cut cable
has caused me no end of trouble. It started me on a dozen, more or less
impossible, theories. I see exactly what happened now. Mr. Delahay and his
companion doubtless thought that if they cut off the light, they would get rid
of Lord Ravenspur."</p>
<p>"That is exactly what they did," Cooney resumed. "I beard his lordship
fussing about, and trying the electric switches, but he gave it up as a bad
job, and after a bit left the house. Mr. Delahay appeared presently from
somewhere, with a lamp, which he carried into the studio, and the lady followed
him. I was close enough at hand to see what took place. The lady had come,
evidently for some valuable jewelry, for Mr. Delahay produced a case from a
safe, and handed it over to her. My word, but those stones did sparkle! It
seemed to me that I was in luck that night. My game obviously was to take no
further heed of the studio, but to follow the lady as soon as she left the
house. It was nearly two o'clock in the morning, and there wasn't a soul about.
In my mind's eye I saw those stones already in my pocket. But, unfortunately
for me, Mr. Delahay walked with his visitor as far as the front gate, and stood
looking up the road until the lady was safe in a hansom. It was as much as I
could do to get back to the house again without being discovered, but I managed
it all right. There were several valuable articles I had marked down, and
directly Mr. Delahay was back in the studio I began to gather them together. I
dropped one trinket, which tinkled on the floor, and my heart was in my mouth.
I thought that the sound didn't reach the ears of Mr. Delahay. But I was
mistaken. A minute or two later I heard him coming, and I bolted through the
window into the garden. I waited there perhaps for an hour before it seemed
safe for me to go back, and then I went. I turned on the light... My heart was
fair in my mouth. Then I looked down at the floor. There lay Mr. Delahay as
dead as a rabbit. I believe I howled for a moment, I was taken to! But there he
lay, and there was his watch-chain a-shining in the light, and then it comes
into my head that, if I'd got pluck enough, here was a way to pay for them
sticks of furniture of mine. It was hard work, but I managed to screw myself up
to it at last. After all said and done, I'd only come here to take what I could
get, and it wasn't me that knifed the poor gentleman. Besides, he might have
died a natural death for all I knew. There was no sign of blood about, and
nothing that suggested violence. All the same, I couldn't go through it again
if you offered me ten thousand of the best."</p>
<p>Cooney paused and shuddered. Great beads of perspiration poured down his
face. Then he resumed once more.</p>
<p>"Well, he was dead, and there was an end of it. Just for the moment I wasn't
thinking about much besides my little happy home. I pocketed all the valuables
I could lay my hands upon, and carried them away. You may say that that was a
mad thing to do, but after I saw Mr. Delahay lying dead at my feet, it seemed
to me as if he wasn't likely to miss them. Oh, I know as I stand in what the
papers call a serious position. But that's the gospel truth, and I can't tell
you any more. It seems to me I have said enough. And now, if you will call a
cab, sir, I am ready for you."</p>
<p>A cab was called, and Dallas drove off in the direction of Bow Street with
his prisoner. He stopped just a moment to exchange a few words with Lance and
Venables.</p>
<p>"There is no reason why Mrs. Delahay should not know this just yet?" Walter
asked. "You may be sure that she feels her position keenly. Would there be any
objection to getting her to accompany us as far as Cannon Green to-night? You
will understand why."</p>
<p>"None at all," Dallas said. "I'll send a message to the man who is watching
outside the Grand Hotel, and let him know that his presence there is needed no
longer. All the same, we have still got to find the culprit. It isn't Cooney.
He told us the truth, I'm certain. The culprit is at Cannon Green! What a fool
I've been!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Delahay received her visitors in a dull, apathetic way, which had never
left her since the night of the tragedy. But her face cleared, and her manner
became more soft and gentle as she listened to the story which Walter had to
tell. She dropped into a chair, and for some moments the tears ran
unrestrainedly down her cheeks. She wiped her eyes presently. There was
something like a smile on her lips as she turned to Walter.</p>
<p>"I believe those tears saved my reason," she said. "I have not been able to
cry. I have not been able to feel the last few days. The death of my husband
was bad enough. The knowledge that I was suspected of his murder was worse, but
the feeling that my own sister possibly had a hand in the tragedy was worse
than all the rest. There are one or two matters to be explained yet, but the
great truth is growing plain, and I feel like a living being once more. Oh,
yes; I will come down to Cannon Green with you; I am looking forward to it with
something like pleasure. I know that when I have seen my sister everything will
be cleared up."</p>
<p>It was a different woman who came down from her room half an hour later,
ready for the journey. She looked sad and pathetic enough in her deep mourning.
The trouble still brooded in her eyes, but the look of stony despair was no
longer there. They came at length to the house on the common. The windows were
lighted up, the hall looked comfortable and cheery.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room were the Countess Flavio and Vera. They rose as Mrs.
Delahay entered.</p>
<p>"I have brought your sister," Walter explained briefly. "She has much to say
to you. Perhaps I had better leave you alone!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap45" name="chap45">XLV - COUNT FLAVIO'S DIARY</a></h2>
<p>IT was getting exceedingly late now, but the two sisters Descarti, together
with Vera, were still in the drawing-room. Nobody cared to disturb them. It was
felt that they would have much to say to one another. And no doubt, all they
had to tell would be disclosed when the proper time came. Valdo had not
recovered consciousness again. He lay there overhead, with a vigilant-eyed
nurse watching him. Venables had not come down with Mrs. Delahay and Walter. He
had excused himself on the plea of business, and on the understanding that he
would visit Cannon Green the following day. In the dining-room for the last
hour or two Walter had been seated, deeply engrossed in the slim,
parchment-covered volume which had been sent him by Countess Flavio at the
urgent request of her dying servant.</p>
<p>Time was going on, and still Walter did not look up from the book. It was
long past two before he, finished. Then with a firm step and a determined air
he went up to the little library where Lord Ravenspur was busy writing letters.
The latter looked up, and demanded to know what his nephew wanted.</p>
<p>"I want you to look at this," Walter said quietly. "It is a diary written by
your late friend Count Flavio, whose handwriting you will, of course,
recognise. The diary came into the hands of Silva after his master's, death.
Now Silva told me some time ago&mdash;in fact, during that memorable interview
in your studio&mdash;that he had in his possession documentary evidence which
would prove that his mistress was an injured woman, and his master a scoundrel
of the deepest dye. When I asked him why he did not produce this book at the
trial, he shrugged his shoulders, and said that it would have been useless.
Public opinion against the Countess ran so high that nobody would have believed
that it was anything but a forgery. But that will be for you to judge. Before
we go any further, I want your assurance that this is your dead friend's own
handwriting."</p>
<p>Lord Ravenspur turned over the leaves of the manuscript, more or less
languidly. One leaf after another he fluttered over; then he handed the book
back to Walter again.</p>
<p>"I am not going to contest the point," he said. "Beyond question, this is my
unfortunate friend's handwriting; though the letters are quite plain, the
writing could not be easily forged. Indeed, to forge such an amount as that
would be the work of half a lifetime. But what do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>Walter signified that he would like his uncle to read the whole of the
volume, but Lord Ravenspur shook his head.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I cannot," he said. "I can speak Italian fairly enough, as you
know, but that is merely colloquial, and I had never time really to master the
language. But, seeing that you spent three years of your life there, don't you
think that you had better read it out to me. I suppose it is interesting?"</p>
<p>"I never read anything that fascinated me more," Walter said. "Mind you,
this is the secret diary of Count Flavio. He had no idea that anybody would
ever read it. I have gone through the volume from start to finish, and I am
forced to the conclusion that your friend was the poisonous scoundrel that
Silva declares him to. be. I tell you, if this book was published, it would
cause a great sensation from one end of Europe to the other. It is the work of
a brilliant man with a fine style and an imaginative mind&mdash;the history of
an attempt to deprive a woman of her will, and of her reason. For the three
years during which the Count and Countess Flavio lived together the woman's
life was one long, incessant torture. Mind you, there was no actual violence,
but the tortures were exquisite and cruel all the same. And here we have them
in the Count's own words. It is absolutely necessary that you should listen to
some extracts from this amazing work."</p>
<p>"Go on," Ravenspur said quietly; "I am all attention."</p>
<p>Walter bent back the book, and began to read:</p>
<p class="journal">"February 17th, 1887. What man is there who has ever
succeeded in penetrating the unfathomable depths of a woman's mind? What fools
we men are to assume a knowledge of the sex until we are married, and have the
object lesson before us day by day! There is Carlotta, for example. Carlotta's
prevailing trouble is that she is jealous of me. She seems to think that
because she cut herself off from her family for my sake, I am to be at her beck
and call henceforth and for ever. This peculiar form of jealousy interests and
amuses me. It is a pleasure to study it from a scientific basis. This morning I
told her I was going to Florence for a day or two, and she wept because I would
not allow her to accompany me. I could see that she does not trust me,
wherefore I caused a friend of mine who can imitate a woman's writing
excellently, to write me a passionate love-letter, which fell quite naturally
into Carlotta's hands.</p>
<p class="journal">"The scene which followed was exquisitely amusing. I have
never seen a woman weep to such an extent before. Positively my charming
Carlotta was enchanting. I was quite sorry at length when she assumed a mantle
of dignity, and left me. Still, this is only the first of many such scenes if I
engineered them properly. I see that Carlotta is in possession of all the
emotions, so that, by studying her alone, I shall be in a position to add some
really extraordinary chapters to my great book on women and their ways.</p>
<p class="journal">"March 19th, 1887. Carlotta has afforded me a month of
absolute enjoyment. Why do people pay money to sit in stuffy theatres and watch
comedies and tragedies when they can see and hear the real, palpitating thing
for nothing? Outwardly, Carlotta and myself are at daggers drawn. She thinks I
am unrepentant and angry, but, as to myself, I have never been more cheerful
and happy in my life. And when Carlotta threatens to leave me, I ask her why
she is going, knowing perfectly well that she has not the slightest intention
of leaving me. Women are very much like cats in these matters&mdash;they will
make many sacrifices for the sake of the domestic hearth. I was talking to Dr.
Sacci, the great surgeon, the other day, and he was telling me of the fierce
joy that comes through some new discovery which has been the outcome of
vivisection. But, then, Sacci is only working in the interests o: humanity,
whereas my vivisection allows me to see the exquisite suffering of the patient.
I can study the nerves, and the palpitating wound, at the very moment when the
knife enters.</p>
<p class="journal">"December 21st, 1887. The last chapter in my book is by far
the most brilliant and searching which I have yet added to that fascinating
volume. Whatever Carlotta suffers in the present, she shall go down to
posterity as the martyr of her sex. I will place her on a pinnacle as high as
my own. Indeed, I was almost sorry when I had to tell her the story of the
love-letter, and how I had been playing on her feelings all these months. At
the same time, I looked forward to the explanation, because I knew that it
would open up to me a fresh phase of womanly nature. And I confess that it did
with a vengeance. Carlotta turned pale. She stood there looking as if she were
filled with the greatest physical agony, her eyes filled with tears which did
not fall. I don't know how many days it is since she spoke to me last, but
certainly it must be upwards of a fortnight. This is not exactly what I
expected. It is only when a woman talks that one can judge of how the
experiment is progressing. To-morrow, all being well, I am going to adopt a new
scheme which I hope will have the desired effect.</p>
<p class="journal">"December 22nd, 1887. Our little Vera has disappeared.
Evidently she has been kidnapped with a view to a reward. The whole
neighbourhood is up in arms, and my wife is distracted. It has often been a
favourite theory of mine that every man takes a second place in a woman's
affections as soon as her first child is born. I look back now with a vivid
recollection of the early days when I first met Carlotta. I look back to her
passionate love scenes, and her declarations that I should be first with her,
then and always. Even though I was very much enamoured, I had my doubts when I
was alone, and in a position to debate the matter clearly. The time has come to
put the question to a test, and thus it became necessary for Vera to disappear.
I might say at once that my theory has been vindicated to the letter. I now
know that Carlotta cares far more for Vera than she does for me. The reflection
is not soothing to one's vanity, but there it is. There is a wildness and
intensity in her grief, which she never would have experienced had I been
brought home to her. in the last stage of dissolution. I must keep this up. I
must work this phase as long as it lasts, which will not be an indefinite time,
because I must not drive my patient too far. She begins to show signs of
collapse already. I think at the end of a week I must have Vera brought back
again. By the expiration of that time, I fancy I can add another chapter to my
remarkable book..."</p>
<p>Walter stopped for a moment, his voice was full of loathing and disgust. An
honest indignation almost choked him. He saw now that his anger and contempt
were reflected on the face of Ravenspur.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to read any further," he said, "or is that sufficient? Shall
I tell you, for instance, what happened after this inhuman wretch brought his
child home again? Shall I tell you of other tortures and tyrannies, and how
this scoundrel rejoices in the fact that his neighbours like him and pity him
because he is married to a bad-tempered woman, who makes his life a burden?
That is the note that runs all through this extraordinary diary. The man uses
it as a weapon to play upon the feelings of his wife. If you are not yet
satisfied I will pick out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," Ravenspur cried, as he rose to his feet. "I have heard enough and
more than enough. Flavio must have been a madman; and yet I regarded him as one
of the best and noblest of men. I never dreamt he had an enemy. I never knew
anybody say a word against him. And to think that a man of the world like
myself should be deceived in this way! Everything is now growing wonderfully
clear before my eyes, Walter. I can even understand why the Countess left her
daughter behind her. Fancy suffering all that trouble and humiliation to find,
later on, that the child you had done so much for was likely to turn out as her
father had done! In the last ten minutes you have proved that I was wrong, and
the Countess was right; and yet it seemed to me that I was justified in my
actions. I don't know what I am going to do. I don't know what steps I can take
to convince that unhappy woman that I acted for the best. At any rate, I must
make a beginning before I go to bed to-night."</p>
<p>Ravenspur took up the volume and went down the stairs. In the drawing-room,
the Countess, Mrs. Delahay, and Vera were still seated, talking earnestly
together. Ravenspur crossed the room to the Countess's side and held out the
book.</p>
<p>"Do you know what this contains?" he asked. "I suppose you have read it from
cover to cover?"</p>
<p>"Once," said the Countess, with a shudder, "but never again."</p>
<p>"I can quite understand your feelings," Ravenspur said. "I have only heard
extracts, but they have been quite sufficient for me. And now let me do my best
to try and convince you that I acted in what I conceived to be the true
interests of your child. I know now how wrong I was. I know that you have been
made the victim of a scoundrel and a madman; and if you can forgive me for what
I have done, I will be your grateful servant in the future."</p>
<p>"One moment," the Countess said. "There is another, and yet more painful
thing to confess. I understand from your nephew that the police think that they
have a most important clue to the murder of Louis Delahay. The police are all
wrong. It is incredible to me that they have not discovered the truth before;
that they have not blundered on it. Surely you can guess who it IS who is
responsible for the death of my poor sister's husband?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid," Ravenspur murmured, "that I cannot&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not even after it was known that you were at work in the studio that
night?"</p>
<p>"No, unless, perhaps&mdash;good heavens, you don't mean to say Silva?"</p>
<p>"Nobody else. The man tracked you to Fitzjohn Square. There was not one of
your movements that he did not know. But come this way. I dare say the nurse
will not mind us talking to the patient for a few moments alone. You shall hear
Silva confirm what I have said to you."</p>
<p>Ravenspur stumbled to his feet. He was dazed and numbed with surprise; and
yet the more he came to think of it, the more plausible it seemed. No, the
nurse had no objection, it would not harm the patient. He was very near to his
end now. Weak as he was, his eyes gleamed as he caught sight of Lord Ravenspur,
the old wolfish look was on his face.</p>
<p>"We have been mistaken, my dear Silva," the Countess said. "Lord Ravenspur
has been one of my best friends if I had only known it. He was deceived by my
husband, as hundreds of others were. His lordship was led to believe that the
Count was a martyr to a dreadful wife, a woman incapable of looking after a
child. The kidnapping of my daughter was part of his vengeance upon me, so that
he could reach me from the other side of the grave. Everything has been
explained, the diary has been read by Lord Ravenspur; and he has forgiven you,
he has come to your bedside to say so before you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Die," Silva said, with an effort. "Curse his forgiveness. If I could stand
up now&mdash;"</p>
<p>He could say no more, the malignant hate, the fire of madness, still gleamed
in his dark eyes. He would hold the same tradition to the end. There was no
chance of anything like a reconciliation here.</p>
<p>"I expected nothing else," the Countess said sadly. "Only a Corsican could
understand his feelings. It is his blood, his religion. But if you can't
forgive, my poor Silva, you can confess. It may be the means of saving an
innocent life. It was you who were responsible for the death of Mr.
Delahay?"</p>
<p>Silva nodded quite coolly. There was an upward heave of his shoulders that
was very expressive. It was like one who confesses to a mistake.</p>
<p>"I understand," the Countess resumed. "It was a misunderstanding. You had
traced Lord Ravenspur to the studio. You were going to kill him there. Only Mr.
Delahay and myself interrupted you. You were probably hiding somewhere outside,
waiting for your opportunity, when we arrived. You did not see us, you were not
aware of anything till the lights were out. I may make errors in details, but
in the main I am quite correct. No, don't try and talk&mdash;a nod is
sufficient. When Mr. Delahay returned to the studio, after Lord Ravenspur was
driven away, and after I had gone, you were in the studio. You mistook Mr.
Delahay for Lord Ravenspur, and killed him with a glass Corsican dagger. You
did not know till you saw the papers the next day that you had made a
mistake?"</p>
<p>Silva nodded again. He did not appear to feel the least remorse, but his
hungry eyes testified how he regretted that he had so signally failed. The old
wild spirit was still there, even the approach of death could not quench it.
Ravenspur turned away, filled with disgust and sadness.</p>
<p>"Really, there is nothing more to be said," he murmured. "I should like to
put the heads of the confession down and get the unhappy man to sign it."</p>
<p>Silva affixed a straggling signature to the confession. Then he turned over
on his side and refused to listen any more. Evidently he was going to die as he
had lived &mdash;hard, unfeeling, carrying his bitter hatred to the grave.</p>
<p>"According to his lights," Ravenspur murmured, "let us hope that he will not
be judged too harshly where he is going so soon."</p>
<h2><a id="chap46" name="chap46">XLVI - A WOMAN'S HEART</a></h2>
<p>The hard, cold face had softened slightly. It seemed to Ravenspur that there
was something akin to a smile in Countess Flavio's eyes when once more they
were alone in the drawing-room together.</p>
<p>"Let us try and forget that dreadful scene," she said, "as I will try and
forget what a hard, misunderstood life mine has been."</p>
<p>It must have been terrible," Ravenspur exclaimed; and yet there was not a
man in Europe for whom I had a higher regard than I had for your husband. To me
he was the soul of honour. I always found him generous and liberal-minded. I
have seen him do the most spontaneous acts of kindness to strangers. It seemed
hard to think that he was wholly bad."</p>
<p>"He was an enigma," the Countess replied. "In his brain lay a curious vein
of madness, which vented itself upon me. No one else suffered, and, indeed, no
one knew that I suffered, with the solitary exception of that poor lost soul
who is lying at death's door upstairs. When I fled from my father's house,
knowing that I had cut myself off entirely from my own flesh and blood, Silva
followed me. From the first he began to see how I was suffEring. From the first
he began to entertain a malignant hatred of my husband."</p>
<p>"And finally poisoned him," Ravenspur suggested. Ah, there you are wrong,"
the Countess exclaimed. "With all the earnestness in my power I want to impress
upon you that my husband poisoned himself. As you have been informed, for
generations there had been a feud between the Descartis and my husband's
family. After my marriage it would have been an easy matter for my father to
summon some of his retainers, and command them to avenge the honour and dignity
of the family. My father chose not to do it. He was satisfied with the solemn
assurance that only one child of his remained. The summons was sent out by
Silva. He did not tell me. I did not know in the least what he was doing till
afterwards. But the sign went forth, and my husband received his warning. There
was no escape for him, and he knew it. That is why he took his own life. No
doubt in doing so he was actuated by some extraordinary motive, for, with all
his faults, he was no coward; but even from beyond the grave he persecuted me.
His body was found in circumstances that pointed to me as the murderess. Oh,
you may start and shrink, but what I tell you is absolutely true. The whole
thing was planned, with diabolical ingenuity, by the Count on the night of his
death. Had it not been for Silva I should have gone down to my grave execrated
by all who knew me."</p>
<p>"But you were not there," Ravenspur expostulated. "It was proved that you
were in Florence at the time."</p>
<p>"That was where Silva's cunning and ingenuity came in. During the few hours
that preceded and followed that tragic event I saw nobody. I was utterly worn
out and prostrated. I could not drag myself from my bed. But nobody saw me, for
I had given strict orders that I was not to be disturbed. I did not know then
that my sister was alive. In fact, I had got into such a state that I had no
interest in anything. At that time my sister Maria was taking a holiday in
Florence, and Silva was aware of the fact. When I ask you to notice the
extraordinary likeness between us, you will have no trouble in guessing what
happened. Silva was in a position to bring over scores of people from Florence,
who swore that I was in that town at the time of the tragedy. It was a bold
thing to do, and nobody guessed, nobody doubted the sincerity of the witnesses,
and thus my life was saved."</p>
<p>"It is a most extraordinary story," Ravenspur murmured. "But, really, there
is no reason for you to justify yourself any further. We know that you are
absolutely innocent of any sort of crime. I know now what kind of a life Flavio
led you. Had I been aware at the time I should never have interfered. And yet
Flavio managed to convey to me the impression that you were the last woman in
the world who ought to have the custody of a child. I committed an illegal act
at the earnest request of my old friend. I ran a great, risk, but it seemed to
me that I was justified in what I did."</p>
<p>"I see you are now," the Countess said thoughtfully. "For many, many years
no doubt you have rejoiced in the fact that you saved Vera from a life of
misery and unhappiness. You never expected to see or hear from me again. You
looked upon the child as your own. And now, to a certain extent, I must justify
myself. I stand in your eyes as a deeply wronged and injured woman, and yet you
might say to yourself that as a mother I have been lacking in my duties. I tell
you for a long time after the death of my husband my mind trembled on the
borderline between reason and insanity. I was afraid to see my child. I was
fearful lest I should find in her some trace of her father; and, if I had done
so, I believe that I should have taken her life. But, gradually, as the years
went on and I grew older, a longing to see my child came over me that amounted
almost to a passion. I left my retreat in the mountains, and came into the
world again. It was at this time that I met Silva once more, and for three
years he was looking for my child. I need not tell you. Lord Ravenspur, how he
got on the track."</p>
<p>Lord Ravenspur shivered and nodded in reply.</p>
<p>"I would have prevented that if I could," the Countess went on quickly. "I
wanted no violence. But I knew that Silva would go his own way. I knew that
nobody could check his fanaticism. In his eyes you were marked down for
slaughter. You had violated the dignity and honour of the family, and therefore
you must be removed. Let me be quite candid&mdash;I think I hated you almost as
much as Silva did. You had robbed me of my child at the instigation of my cruel
husband. Not unnaturally, I regarded you as being little or no better than
Count Flavio. All the same, as I said before, I wanted no violence. That was
one of the reasons why I did not come to your house and claim my child. I felt
sure that you would defy me, and place Vera somewhere beyond my reach."</p>
<p>"Most undoubtedly I should," Ravenspur said candidly. "You see, I did not
know then that you were capable&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of looking after my daughter," the Countess interrupted. "And, from your
point of view, your actions would have been justified. As soon as the danger
threatened seriously you made arrangements to get away from England until Vera
was of age, and capable of acting for herself. But Silva found out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment," Vera cried eagerly. "Was your servant, Silva, in Park Lane
disguised as a blind organ-grinder?"</p>
<p>"I understand so," the Countess went on. "At any rate, Silva managed things,
in his usual able manner. He contrived to get Vera away from Lady Ringmar's
party, and bring here down her. I daresay you will think that this was all very
melodramatic and unnecessary, but, as I pointed out to you before, I wanted no
violence. I thought when Silva's plan was successful that I should be able to
persuade him to forego the rest of his vengeance. I thought that once I had my
daughter back in my own hands, I could take her out of the country and get
Silva to accompany me. Then you. Lord Ravenspur, would have been safe. But in
certain matters Silva is quite as insane as my husband was. It was in vain that
I appealed to him. He had made his vow, and he was going to carry it out. It is
only fitting that he should have brought so just a punishment upon his own
shoulders."</p>
<p>"And yet there is something magnificent in a vengeance like his," Ravenspur
said, thoughtfully. "Now that everything is cleared up, how simple it seems.
There is only one thing that puzzles me, and that is your connection with my
unfortunate friend Louis Delahay. It seems a remarkable thing that both you
sisters should have known Delahay. How did it come about?"</p>
<p>"That I have just been explaining at some length," the Countess said. "But
for your benefit I will go over the ground again."</p>
<p>Ravenspur listened with the greatest interest to the story which the
Countess had to tell. She told him vividly enough of the eventful night when
she had made up her mind to leave her husband's roof, and how her life had been
saved at a critical moment by a total stranger, who turned out to be Louis
Delahay&mdash;the same Delahay who, years afterwards, met Maria Descarti and
made her his wife. She told the story of the jewels, and how the time had come
when she needed them, to turn into money to aid her in her search for Vera.
Then she went on to speak of her meeting with Delahay.</p>
<p>"One moment," Ravenspur said. "When Louis married you, Mrs. Delahay, did he
not notice your extraordinary likeness to the Countess, whom he had befriended
so many years ago?"</p>
<p>"He couldn't," the Countess exclaimed. "Not only was our interview in the
dark, but I was wearing a veil. Oh, you may say it was an extraordinary thing
to trust my valuables to a perfect stranger, but more amazing things happen
every day, and I was beside myself with grief and terror and despair at the
time. At any rate, I did it, and I got my jewels back again. I can tell you, if
you like, the story of that strange interview. I can describe how I went down
to the studio with Mr. Delahay, and how we saw you there. But we are wasting
time and it is getting late. There is only one thing to regret now, and that is
the death of my sister's husband; but it has always been useless for a Descarti
to expect anything like happiness in this world. Never was one of our famIly
yet, who was not born to misery and despair. Still, one can now look forward to
a more pleasant time. I am quite sure, after what has happened, that you will
not try to stand between Vera and myself any longer. Lord Ravenspur. I can only
thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you have done."</p>
<p>"Vera has been very dear to me," Lord Ravenspur said, with some emotion. "I
daresay we shall be able to explain matters satisfactorily, so that people will
not be in a position to talk. And now, as it is getting so very
late&mdash;"</p>
<h2><a id="chap47" name="chap47">XLVII - THE PASSING OF THE VENGEANCE</a></h2>
<p>IT was well into the following afternoon when the trained nurse came quietly
down the stairs, and announced to Lord Ravenspur that her task was finished.
Silva had died in his sleep. The troubled spirit was at rest, the tardy
confession had been made, and Lord Ravenspur had no longer any occasion to fear
the vengeance that had followed him so long. There would have to be an inquest,
of course&mdash;as there was. But there was nothing much here to arouse public
curiosity. A servant at the house on the common had been severely mauled by a
savage dog prowling about, and he had succumbed to the shock. The newspapers
had a few paragraphs, but in a day or two the incident was forgotten, nor was
there any occasion to worry the owner of the house, seeing that the place had
been taken by Silva in the proper name of his mistress. The servants had seen
nothing either, so that scandal was entirely checked. It would, perhaps, be a
difficult matter later on to explain the unexpected reappearance of Vera's
mother, but it seemed to Ravenspur that he could see a way to solve that
problem. And after the lapse of eighteen years, nobody would identify the
Countess Flavio with the Italian scandal that had been a sensation in Europe
back in the 'eighties. Ravenspur and the Countess were good enough friends now,
and Mrs. Delahay was beginning to recover her health and strength again.
Already the Fitzjohn Square murder had ceased to occupy public attention now
that the tragedy had been solved, and there was no chance of the culprit being
brought before an earthly tribunal. As to Cooney, he got off quite as lightly
as he deserved. And there are always new sensations to follow the old.</p>
<p>"I think, on the whole, you had better remain here for the present,"
Ravenspur suggested. "You have the house on your hands for two months, and,
really, it is a very pleasant place. Everybody is out of town for the present,
and very few of my friends will be back in London again before the autumn. This
will give us time to invent some plausible story to account for your
reappearance. I don't like that kind of thing as a rule, but is is quite
essential in this case."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do yourself?" the Countess asked.</p>
<p>"I am going to have a couple of quiet months on the continent. As you can
imagine, my nerves are considerably shaken, and I am not so young as I used to
be. I shall miss Vera, of course, but I think it is far better for her to stay
here with you, so that you can get to know one another properly. But has it
ever occurred to you, Countess, that before long Vera will have another and a
closer guardian than either of our two selves?"</p>
<p>"I suppose that is inevitable," the Countess said as she looked thoughtfully
across the flower-beds. "Still, the fault is my own. I deliberately wasted
eighteen years, and it is hardly to be expected that Vera&mdash;but don't let
us anticipate."</p>
<p>"I am afraid the mischief is done," Ravenspur smiled. "From a remark that
Vera let slip the other night, I learnt a great deal that has been going on in
her mind. Goodness knows how she got the impression, but she honestly believed
that I was something more than her guardian, and that, between you and
myself&mdash; but I mustn't pain you by being more definite. Anyway, I now know
why Vera appeared to be so unhappy and miserable a few weeks ago, and why she
conceived the idea of leaving my house, and going out into the world to get her
own living. To make matters quite plain, she and my nephew have fallen in love
with one another and she thought that I should oppose the match. As a matter of
fact, I did. But not for the reasons that Vera supposed. What I was afraid of
was that the vengeance intended for me might have been transferred to Walter,
had he married Vera then. Of course, matters are on a totally different footing
now, and nobody is more delighted than myself. Walter is a fine fellow. He will
be rich some of these days. He will succeed to the title at my death. If I were
you. Countess, I would not interfere with that arrangement."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it would be too late in any case," the Countess said, sadly. "I
have no right to say a word. And, from what I have seen of your nephew, I
should say that he will make a good husband for any girl. Still, it is rather a
disappointment to find that I have been supplanted in this way, though I am
bound to admit that the fault is entirely my own."</p>
<p>Ravenspur was quite content to leave it discreetly at that, and all the more
so because Vera herself was at that moment coming down the garden path. The
girl's face was bright and happy now. The look of trouble had vanished from her
eyes. The sun was shining full in her face, and as the Countess regarded her
daughter critically she could see no suggestion of her father in her face. As
Lord Ravenspur moved away. Vera took her place by her mother's side.</p>
<p>"What have you two been plotting?" she asked gaily.</p>
<p>"We have been discussing your future," the Countess replied. "Lord Ravenspur
has been telling me something which, apparently, I ought to have guessed
before. I was looking forward to a year or two in your company, but I am told
that that is more than I can expect. There is a certain young man&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are speaking of Walter," Vera murmured. A little colour crept into her
cheeks. Her eyes were bright and smiling. "Positively there has been no time to
tell you about Walter. Do you know, mother, that Walter and myself have been
lovers ever since I was fourteen? There has never been anybody like Walter in
my eyes. And then, a few months ago, it seemed to come to me in a different way
altogether. I suppose when I came to years of discretion I could see things
more plainly. But how could I marry Walter when I had no name of my own? I felt
sure that Lord Ravenspur would be sternly opposed to anything of the kind. And
that is why I wanted to leave his house and earn my own living. But now that I
am a Flavio, that is a different matter. We are quite as well born as the
Ravenspurs, and so far as my guardian is concerned&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The path is smooth enough now," the Countess smiled. "Lord Ravenspur told
me just now that he was delighted with the turn of events. There is no girl he
knows he would rather have for a niece than, yourself. But I wasn't going to
say that. Vera. What I want to impress upon you is this&mdash;I am not going to
stand between you and your happiness for a moment. If your lover wants you now,
go to him and don't consider me. Take your happiness when you get the
opportunity. Let me before I die see one Descarti, at least, who has her
heart's desire. And now we won't say any more about it, my child. After all, I
am better treated than I deserve."</p>
<p>The dusk was beginning to fall at length. The garden was fragrant with the
scent of flowers, holding their heads high to reach the dropping dew. It was a
warm evening, and the French windows in the dining-room were widely open.
Dinner was almost over. The table was littered with fruit. There was just the
suggestion of scented tobacco smoke hanging on the air. Ravenspur sat chatting
almost gaily with the Countess and her sister. The gloom had lifted from his
face now. He appeared to be years younger during the last few days. Vera rose
from her chair and stood by the window, drinking in the subtle delights of the
evening. Walter crossed over to her side, and placed his arm under hers.</p>
<p>"Come outside," he said. "It is a shame to stay indoors on a night like
this. Besides, I have something important to say to you."</p>
<p>Vera turned and smiled into her lover's face. She had never felt the least
shy or awkward with him&mdash; they were too good friends for that. They walked
in silence together down the path, with the roses rioting on either side. They
came at length to a little secluded terrace looking over the common. Behind the
bracken and the heather the sun was sinking in a track of golden glory. The
after-light shone in Vera's eyes, and rendered them glorious. Walter turned to
her eagerly. He had his arm about her waist now, her head bent towards his
shoulder. It all seemed the most natural thing in the world, the fitting crown
to their romance.</p>
<p>"How long is it," Walter asked, "since you wanted to run away and leave us?
I won't ask you why you wanted to go, because my uncle has told me that. My
dearest girl, there is no occasion for you to blush and look uncomfortable. I
am sure that your motives did you every credit. But we will pass over that. We
need never allude to it again. I have spoken to your mother, and what my
uncle's feelings are you know for yourself. All the dangers and troubles have
gone now. Everything lies fair and smooth between us. And now, little Vera,
when are we to be married?"</p>
<p>Vera turned slowly and thoughtfully. She laid her hands upon Walter's
shoulders, and looked steadily and lovingly into his smiling eyes. Her words
were low and sweet.</p>
<p>"Dear old boy," she said, "we have always been friends, and more than
friends, and in my heart of hearts I have ever felt that it must come to this,
whatever obstacles stood in the way. I am not so brave as I thought I was,
Walter, and I don't believe I could have left you when it came to the pinch.
Oh, I'll marry you, dear; I'll marry you gladly and willingly, and be the
happiest girl in all the world. But not yet; not till our time is up here; not
till I have spent the next two months with my mother. And you won't love me any
the less because I have thought of her as well as you?"</p>
<p>Walter kissed the sweet, serious lips.</p>
<p>"It shall be as you say, sweetheart. And now let us go back, and tell the
others all about it."</p>
<br>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<br>
<p>"There is only one thing that remains," Walter said, as he and Lord
Ravenspur walked up and down after dinner, with their cigars. "That photo,
uncle. The one that you were so worried about, in the studio on the night when
Sir James was attacked by Silva in mistake for you. Where did it come from, and
why did it agitate you so?"</p>
<p>"I had almost forgotten that," Ravenspur smiled. "Well, that photo was tied,
with a small packet of jewels, round Vera's neck when I carried her away from
Italy. I did not know till lately that it was a photo of her mother. She must
have been a lovely woman then. Being an artist, I rather idealised that
photograph&mdash;indeed, I painted the picture that Silva stole from it. It was
only when the picture was finished that I discovered I had made a very strong
likeness to Vera; and then I had my doubts. Here was Vera's mother in the flesh
again. Had I done wrong? Had Flavio deceived me? The thing has troubled my
conscience ever since. A woman with a face like that to be a fiend! Never. And
yet&mdash;</p>
<p>"Still, it is all over now. There have been faults on all sides, so that we
can all afford to forget and forgive. And that, my dear boy, is all I have to
say!"</p>
