<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;"THE CASTE OF VERE DE
VERE"</h2>
<p>There were tears in the girl's eyes&mdash;tears of futile anger and despair.
The danger was so great, and yet safety was so near. If only the black horse
would stumble or swerve, if only she could work the bit into that iron mouth
and bring him to a standstill altogether. Her gloves were cut to ribands now;
the blue veins stood out on the slender white wrists.</p>
<p>And still the horse flew on down the rocky path leading to the lych-gate. He
would charge through the gate into the green old churchyard beyond, but no
longer with his rider fighting for life on his back. The arch of the lych-gate
would sweep her from the saddle with a blow that would crush the life out of
her. Mary Dashwood could see that plainly enough; she knew that she had only a
few more minutes to live.</p>
<p>She set her teeth and blinked the welling tears from her proud blue eyes.
She was not afraid&mdash;no Dashwood was ever afraid&mdash;but the pity of it!
She saw the great beeches rising on either side of the path, she saw the blue
sky beyond, the song of the birds came to her ears. And she was only
twenty-two, and life was very dear to her.</p>
<p>The moment was coming ever nearer. The black horse was thundering along the
straight downward path; the lych-gate was in sight. Mary discarded the idea of
throwing herself from the saddle; she would have only been dashed to pieces on
the rocks on either side of the road. She had been warned, too, not to take the
black horse. She bent low to escape an overhanging bough; her hat was swept
away; the shining chestnut hair began to stream from her shapely head.</p>
<p>There was a crackling of sticks in the wood on the right; surely, a hundred
yards or so ahead, a face looked over the high fence, the figure of a man was
holding on to the overhanging bough of an oak tree. Mary Dashwood wondered if
the man realised her danger. Perhaps he did, for he crooked a leg over the
bough and hung arms downward over the roadway. He was saying something in a
smooth, firm voice.</p>
<p>"Pull to the side of the road," said the voice. It almost sounded like a
command. "Drop the reins and clear your stirrup as you near me. And have no
fear."</p>
<p>The big horse thundered on. Despite her peril, Mary did not fail to notice
how strong and brown and capable the stranger's hands looked...It was all
done so quickly and easily as to rob the episode of romantic danger&mdash;two
hands, warm and tender, and yet firm as a steel trap, grasped the girl's
slender wrists, she was floated lightly from the saddle, and in the next
instant she was swaying dizzily on her feet in the road. The pride and courage
of the Dashwoods availed nothing now&mdash;it was but a mere woman who fell
almost fainting by the roadside.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes presently to the knowledge that a strong arm was
supporting her. A bright blush mounted to her proud, beautiful face. The colour
deepened as she saw the look, half admiration, half amusement, on the face of
her rescuer.</p>
<p>"Mr. Darnley," she stammered. "I&mdash;I hardly expected to see you here. A
little over two years ago, in Paris, you saved my life before."</p>
<p>"It is good to know that you have not forgotten it," Ralph Darnley murmured.
"And yet the coincidence is not so strange as it seems. I did not come to these
parts moved by any unaccountable impulse&mdash;I simply had business here. And
I was told that a walk through the park would repay me for my trouble. As I was
making a start out, through a copse I saw your predicament and hastened to your
assistance. A handy tree did the rest. The only strange part of the affair is
that you should be here, too."</p>
<p>"Nothing strange about that," the girl smiled, "seeing that the Hall is my
home."</p>
<p>It was a commonplace statement of facts, and yet the words seemed to hurt
Ralph Darnley as if they had been lashes to sting him. The honest open brown
face paled perceptibly under its tan hue. A dozen emotions changed in those
clear brown eyes.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't quite understand," he remarked. "When we met in Paris two
years ago, Miss Mary Mallory&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quite so. Mary Dashwood Mallory. But, you see, the head of the family was
alive then. He died nearly two years ago without any children, in fact, his
only son died years ago somewhere abroad&mdash;it was a rather sad
story&mdash;and my father came into the title and estates. He is Sir George
Dashwood now. You can quite see why he changed his name."</p>
<p>"Of course. Only you can see that I could not possibly know this. What a
grand old place it is, and what a grand old house! You must have grown very
fond of it."</p>
<p>"I love it," Mary Dashwood cried. The look of haughty pride had faded from
her face, leaving it refined and beautiful. "I love every stick and stone of
it, it is part of my very life. You see, I have practically lived here always.
As my father was in the Diplomatic Service, and my mother died young, it was
necessary for somebody to look after me. I spent my childhood here with old
Lady Dashwood, who has now gone to the dower house&mdash;such a wonderful old
body!"</p>
<p>But Darnley did not appear to be listening. He made an effort to recover
himself presently. He was like a man who dreams.</p>
<p>"I can quite appreciate your feelings," he said quietly. "I understand that
the Dashwoods have ruled here for three hundred years. It is a fine estate;
they tell me the heirlooms are almost priceless. And yet I am sorry."</p>
<p>The girl looked sharply up at the speaker.</p>
<p>"Why should you be sorry?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"Because it is the end of a dream," Darnley said. "I rather gathered in
Paris that your father was poor. The fact levelled things up a little. It is
just possible that you may remember our last evening together in Paris."</p>
<p>"I recollect," Mary said, the delicate colour flushing her cheeks again.
"But I thought that we had closed that chapter finally, Mr. Darnley."</p>
<p>"No. That chapter can never be closed for me. I loved you from the first
moment that we met, and I shall go on loving you till I die. I asked you to be
my wife, and you refused me. The future mistress of Dashwood could not stoop to
the son of a Californian rancher, though I happened to be an English gentleman
by birth. I hope I took your refusal quietly, though it was a great blow to me.
There can be no other woman for me, Mary."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the girl said, "but see how impossible it is. Perhaps I am a
little old-fashioned, perhaps it is the fault of my bringing up. That like must
mate with like has always been the motto of the Dashwoods. These new people,
with their wealth and noise and ostentation can never cross the threshold of
Dashwood Hall. My father is fond of finance, but he never dreams of bringing
his City friends here."</p>
<p>Darnley smiled to himself. He recollected the days in Paris, when Mary's
father had been hand-in-glove with many a dubious French financier.</p>
<p>"We are wandering from the point," he said. "In any case your strictures do
not touch me, for I have no money. My poor father left me comfortably off, as
he thought, but my mine of silver is ruined now, ruined by a firm of City
swindlers whom I was fool enough to regard as honest men. It was a very bad
thing for me when I came in contact with Horace Mayfield."</p>
<p>It was the girl's turn to start guiltily. The beautiful face flushed once
more.</p>
<p>"I know Mr. Mayfield," she said. "He is the only one of my father's business
friends who comes here. We make an exception in his favour, because he is so
well connected. Frankly, I do not like him, but I thought that he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That he is a cold-blooded and calculating rascal to the core," Darnley
said. "I trusted him, and he left me almost penniless. Many people will tell
you I am saying no more than what is actually true. And, because I am poor, I
came down here thinking to find a little something that belonged to my people
years ago. And so I met you, Mary, and discovered that I love you with the same
old pure affection, that will go on burning in my heart till I die. It may
strike you as strange that a poor man should speak to Miss Dashwood, of
Dashwood, like this. Mind you, I am young, and strong, and able, and I shall
come into my kingdom again. And love is worth all the rest; it is better far
than money, or position, or pride of birth. If I could hear you say that you
cared for me now! You are so beautiful; behind all your pride the woman's heart
beats true enough. May God grant that you meet the right man when the time
comes! I would give you up to him willingly and shake his hand on it. But to
think of your being the wife of some brainless nonentity, of some brutal
ruffian who has nothing but an old title to cover his moral wickedness, why the
thought is unbearable. Mary, I think I could find it in my heart to kill that
man."</p>
<p>The words came slowly and clear as cut steel. Calm as he was, Darnley's
tones vibrated with passion. He drew the girl towards him, and laid his hands
on her shoulders so that he could look down into the fathomless lake of her
blue eyes. Strange as it was, Mary Dashwood did not resent that which would
have been insolent familiarity in anybody else. There was something so strong
and dominating about this man; she thrilled with a strange tenderness and pride
in the knowledge that he loved her. True, on his own confession, he was
penniless, but then he treated the loss of his money in a way that only a
strong man could assume.</p>
<p>"I love you, dear," he said, very gently and tenderly. "I love you, Mary,
and no words could say more. I shall live to see the ice and pride melt from
your heart, I shall live to see the beautiful womanhood within you blossom like
a rose. The day will come when you will be prouder far to own a good man's
heart than you will be to call yourself a Dashwood. You may frown, but I feel
certain that my words will come true. And, meanwhile, I am afraid that there is
no hope at all for me, my dear."</p>
<p>"It is impossible," Mary said coldly. Yet her voice trembled and tears came
to her eyes. "Oh, I know that you are a good man and true, but you must make
allowances for me. And besides, love is only a name to me. I owe my life to
you, and believe me, I am too grateful for words. And if the time should ever
come&mdash;oh, how selfish I am. Look at your arm. It is bruised and bleeding.
It must have happened when you lifted me from the saddle. You must come up to
the house and have it attended to at once."</p>
<p>"I don't think&mdash;" Darnley hesitated; "yes I will. It's really nothing.
Let me catch your horse for you and we will walk across the path together."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II.&mdash;DASHWOOD HALL</h2>
<p>There were the lodge-gates at last, with the name of the Dashwoods carved in
mossy stone, and the great iron gates from the cunning hand of Quentin Matsys
himself. Beyond, the noble elms planted in the days of Elizabeth led to the
house, a great Tudor mansion with gabled and latticed windows covered with ivy
to the quaintly carved roof-tree. The gardens spread wide on either side; there
was a thick hedge of crimson roses bounding the park, and in its purple glory
the dappled deer reposed. Ralph Darnley drew a deep breath as he took in the
splendid beauty and serenity of it all. For three hundred years the reign of
the Dashwoods had lasted, and not a stain had shown itself on the family
escutcheon all that time. Darnley could excuse all Mary's pride.</p>
<p>"It is exquisitely beautiful," he said, with a slight catch in his voice.
"How vividly it recalls Tennyson's line&mdash;'a haunt of ancient peace.' I am
trying to make due allowances for your feelings, Miss Dashwood. If I had been
brought up here, my views would be the same as yours. I love old houses."</p>
<p>Mary smiled one of her rare tender smiles. Darnley's eulogy touched her. She
led the way through a great flagged hall, the walls of which were a perfect
dream of carving; from their frames dead and gone Dashwoods looked down. There
was oak carving everywhere, the ceilings were panelled, in the stained glass
windows masses of flowers stood. Ralph would have stopped to admire it all, but
Mary hurried him on.</p>
<p>"We will go into the breakfast-parlour," she said. "Then I will endeavour to
show you that I can be useful as well as ornamental. Excuse me one
moment&mdash;I must get rid of these torn gloves. Ring the bell, please, for
Slight, the butler, and ask him for warm water and towels."</p>
<p>Ralph laid his hand on the bell as Mary flitted away. The old butler came
presently, a thin little man, pink and white, the embodiment of what an old
servant should be. Ralph gave his directions clearly enough, but the man stood
there shaking from head to foot. There was joy and terror and amazement on his
face; the tears gathered in his rheumy eyes.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ralph!" he whispered, "Mr. Ralph come back from the grave! Come back
after all these years! What will the master say if he knows? I'm dreaming,
that's what is the matter; I've gone off my head or I'm dreaming. And after
forty years!"</p>
<p>The speaker came forward tremblingly and touched Ralph's hand. Apparently
the contact with warm flesh and blood reassured him, for the pink apple bloom
came back to his cheek.</p>
<p>"The same and yet not the same," he went on. "Stands to reason as forty
years must make a deal of difference. But you are Mr. Ralph over again all the
same. I loved him, sir. I mourned for him like a child of my own. I taught him
to ride; I taught him to use a gun. I had to stand between him and Sir Ralph
when the crash came. And you are his son as sure as there is a Heaven above
us."</p>
<p>"Not quite so loud," Ralph said. "Pull yourself together, Slight. I take it
you are old Slight about whom my father talked so often. He did not forget you,
Slight. On his deathbed he gave me a message for you."</p>
<p>"And so my dear Mr. Ralph is dead. Dear, dear. What shall I call you,
sir?"</p>
<p>"You are to call me nothing for the present," Ralph said. "I am Mr. Darnley,
Slight, and you are to be discreet and silent. I had quite left you out of my
calculation when I came here to-day; in fact, I had forgotten all about you. It
never occurred to me that you would discover the likeness to what my father was
forty years ago. I will ask you to meet me this evening, say, at half-past ten
at the lodge-gates, for I have much to say to you."</p>
<p>"And, meanwhile, is nobody to know anything about you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Not a soul. The present head of the house never saw my father. The only one
likely to recognize me would be the dowager Lady Dashwood, who is at the dower
house. I am placing myself and my happiness entirely in your hands, my faithful
old Slight, and I ask you not to betray me. Rest assured that it will all come
right in time. Meanwhile, I have hurt my arm, and I require towels and soap and
hot water."</p>
<p>Slight went his way with the air of a man who dreams. He came back
presently, followed by Mary Dashwood. She dressed Darnley's arm skilfully
enough. The touch of her fingers was soft and soothing. She was a tender and
feeling woman now, without the slightest suggestion of cold pride on her
face.</p>
<p>"I think that is all," she said quietly. "How brave and strong you are: how
little you make of your courage. And yet few could have done what you did for
me to-day. But I am forgetting that my father will be glad to see you. Let us
go to the library."</p>
<p>A tall figure rose from a mass of papers heaped on a table. Here in the
library was the same restful air of calm repose, the same patrician silence
that brooded over everything like the spirit of the place. A flood of sunlight,
tempered by the amber and blue of the stained glass windows filled the room;
the rays centered upon the tall figure with the thin white face and grey hair,
standing by the table.</p>
<p>"My daughter has been telling me everything, Mr. Darnley," Sir George said.
"It was well and bravely done of you...I am glad to see you in my
house."</p>
<p>Darnley murmured something appropriate; he hoped that the expression of his
face was not betraying his emotions. For the change in Sir George since they
had last met was startling. The old, jaunty, easy manner was gone, the straight
figure was lost, the iron-grey hair was white as snow. There were deep lines of
care and suffering graven on the pleasant face, a suggestion of fear, or
fright, or remorse. This was a man who carried some secret in his heart.
Darnley felt that he would have passed Sir George in the street unrecognized.
And yet the man appeared to possess everything that made life worth living.
Ralph ventured to offer some suitable comment on the house and the beauty of
the surroundings. A look of infinite sadness overcame the features of Dashwood
for the moment. The slender fingers clutched as if at something unseen, as the
fingers of a drowning man might clutch at a straw.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is perfect enough," he said dreamily. "A perfect house in a perfect
setting. And Mary loves it even more than I do. It seems almost impossible to
connect this place with sin and suffering and the sordid cares of
life&mdash;what is it, Slight?"</p>
<p>"A telegram for you, Sir George," the old butler murmured. "Is there any
reply, sir?"</p>
<p>Sir George murmured that there was no reply. He dropped the telegram in an
unconcerned way upon the table, but his hand was shaking again, and his
features looked terribly white and worn.</p>
<p>"From Horace Mayfield," he said huskily. "He is coming down to-day, on a
rather important piece of business, and will probably stay the night. By the
way, Darnley, it would give me great pleasure if you would dine with us this
evening."</p>
<p>Ralph would have refused. It would have been an exquisite pleasure to spend
a long summer evening with Mary in that delightful old house, but then it
seemed impossible to be under the same roof as Horace Mayfield. It appeared
strange that that handsome, plausible, well-bred scoundrel should be a friend
of Dashwood. Ralph was framing a courteous refusal when he became conscious
that Mary was regarding him with a pleading glance. Her face was weary and
anxious looking, her eyes were alight with an appeal for help. She was asking
Ralph to come, and yet she did not want her father to see how eager she
was.</p>
<p>"I shall be delighted," Ralph answered. "Half-past seven, I think. And now I
must be going."</p>
<p>Ralph turned away into the great dim hall followed by Mary. A ray of
sunlight fell upon her beautiful face and grateful blue eyes.</p>
<p>"That was very good of you," she murmured. "Mr. Darnley, Ralph, if I should
want a friend in the near future, I feel assured that I can rely upon you."</p>
<p>"I love you with my whole heart and soul," Ralph replied. "And some day you
will give that love to me. I would give my life for you, if necessary, and you
know it."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;HORACE MAYFIELD</h2>
<p>The cloth had been drawn in the old-fashioned way, so that the candles in
the ancient silver branches made pools of brown light on the polished mahogany
of the dining table. Here were palms and flowers, feathery fronds, rays of
light streaking the sides of blushing grapes and peaches with the downy bloom
on them. The candle rays glistened somberly on deep ruby red wines in crystal
decanters; the table was as a bath of silver flame in a background of sombre
brown shadows. A noiseless servant or two, gliding about, ministered to the
wants of the guests. How peaceful, how restful and refined it all was, Ralph
thought, the only jarring note being the person opposite him, a clean-shaven,
hard-featured man with a glass screwed in his left eye. And what a hard, firm
mouth he had. He was quite at his ease, too, in Dashwood's presence; he chatted
with glib assurance to the man whom he had robbed as deliberately as if he had
picked his pocket. Actually he had met Ralph in the drawing-room an hour
before, with a smile and a proffered hand, as if they had been two men taking
up the threads of a desirable acquaintance.</p>

<p><b>"She playfully asked him not to be too long."</b></p>
</center>
<p>Ralph's fingers had itched to be at the throat of the man, but he had to
smile and murmur the ordinary polite commonplaces. He shut his teeth together
now as he noted Mayfield's insolently familiar, not to say caressing, manner
towards Mary Dashwood. Sir George looked on and smiled in a pained kind of way.
He reminded Ralph unpleasantly of a well-broken dog in the presence of a harsh
master. It was almost pathetic to see how Dashwood hung on any word of
Mayfield. Surely there was some guilty knowledge between the two, some powerful
hold that Mayfield had on his host. It was with a feeling of relief that Ralph
saw Mary rise at length. He opened the door for her, and she playfully asked
him not to be too long, it was so lovely a night.</p>
<p>"I'll come with you now," Ralph answered. "I don't care to smoke, and I
never touch wine after dinner. I fear Sir George wants to talk business, which
seems to me to be a desecration on an evening like this. Shall we go
outside?"</p>
<p>"I think it would be nice," Mary said. "No, I shall not need a wrap."</p>
<p>She stepped through the double French window that led to the lawn. The full
light of the moon flashed on her ivory shoulders and played in gilded shadows
on her hair. As she looked upwards, Ralph could catch the exquisite symmetry of
her face. A desire to speak possessed him, a desire to tell the girl strange
and wonderful things. Here was his heart's object standing pale and beautiful
by his side; he had only to stretch out his hands and the flowers were his for
the plucking. It only needed a few words and the whole situation would be
changed. But Ralph was silent, he was too strong and masterful a man for that.
What he won he would win by sheer merit, by intrinsic worth alone. He could
have purchased the kisses and caresses for which his heart hungered, but he
knew that they would be no more than Dead Sea fruit on his lips.</p>
<p>"You are very silent," Mary said at length. "What are you thinking
about?"</p>
<p>"About you," Ralph said boldly. "I was thinking how beautiful you looked
with the fuller moonlight on your face. It is only when you recollect that you
are Miss Dashwood, of Dashwood Hall, that I like your expression least. And you
are not always happy."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" Mary asked. There was a startled look in her
eyes. "Why should I not be happy?"</p>
<p>"Why, indeed! But the fact remains that you are not. I do not want to appear
inquisitive, but there is a worm in the heart of the rose somewhere. Mary, why
do you allow your father to ask Mayfield here when you dislike him so much?
Though you are exclusive and can show your pride, yet you allow that man to be
insolently familiar with you. He laid his hand on your arm to-night, and I
could have struck him for it. It is not as if you cared for him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no," Mary said with a shudder. "I detest him. He is so cold and
calculating, you cannot chock him off. I thought that when I refused to marry
him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ha! I expected something of the kind. Mayfield is not the man to take 'No'
for an answer once he has set his heart upon a thing. I told you before that he
was a scoundrel, and I am in a position to prove it. Not that the fellow has
done anything to bring himself within the grip of the law&mdash;your City
rascal is too clever for that. And your father is afraid of him; he watches him
as a dog watches his master. If he is in the power of that man he must get out
without delay. He must raise money on the property&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He can't," Mary said sadly. "My father has not taken me into his
confidence. But you can see how much he has aged and altered lately, and you
looked quite shocked when you met this morning. I don't know what it is, but I
feel that some evil is impending over him. That is why I asked you to be my
friend. You see my father is not really a rich man. He has the income of this
fine estate, it is true. I believe he could get rid of Horace Mayfield if he
could raise money on the property, but that is impossible. Old Sir Ralph, my
great uncle, had a serious quarrel with his wife&mdash;that is the present
dowager Lady Dashwood, you understand. It must have been all Sir Ralph's fault,
for she is the dearest old lady. The heir to the property took the side of his
mother when the separation came, and left Dashwood Hall, declaring that he
would never see the place again. There is only one man living who knows the
whole facts of the case, and that is Slight. But his lips are sealed. The old
man loved young Ralph Dashwood as if he had been his own child. Ralph the
younger went off to America, and has never been heard of again. That was forty
years ago. When old Sir Ralph died two years ago, and my father came into the
property, no will could be found. So my father, being next of kin, succeeded to
the property and the rents of the estate. It is a settled estate, and each
possessor has only what is called a life-interest in it. Now it is just
possible that some day an heir will turn up. It is more than likely that young
Ralph Dashwood married in America, and left a family. Or he may be still alive,
and is waiting to claim, for his son, that which he declined to touch himself.
Most people know this, and that is why my father could never raise a penny on
the family property. If he could, he would not long remain under the heel of
Horace Mayfield. Oh, if we could only find a way!"</p>
<p>"I begin to understand," Ralph said thoughtfully. "If old Sir Ralph had died
leaving a will, things might have been very different. Is that what you
mean?"</p>
<p>"Partly. Sir Ralph died leaving a good deal of ready money. That will no
doubt come to us in time, but for the present we cannot touch it in the absence
of proof of the death of the youngest Ralph Dashwood. I mean the one who went
to America. Old Lady Dashwood says she is sure that her husband did leave a
will, and that he had divided all his money, with certain provisions. If that
will could be found, we should be in a position to get rid of Mayfield. What a
hateful thing this money is, and what misery it seems to bring everybody. But I
am afraid that I am very selfish and exacting. Why should I worry you with our
troubles?"</p>
<p>"My shoulders are broad, and I have very few of my own," Ralph smiled.
"Indeed, I am more interested than you imagine. As I told you to-day, I am a
poor man, thanks to one who is a guest here at the present moment. But, still,
don't forget the fable of the mouse and the lion. I may find a means of freeing
you from the net yet. But here come the others."</p>
<p>Mayfield emerged from the window on to the lawn. His cigar seemed to pollute
the sweet-scented night; he was talking loudly to Sir George.</p>
<p>"We shall know presently," he said. "The worst of living buried in the
country is that one is out of touch with telegrams and telephones. I told my
secretary to wire directly he heard from Worham and his partner."</p>
<p>"Don't let us talk about it," said Sir George in a voice that shook a
little. "Let us enjoy the beauty of the night...I began to wonder what had
become of you, Darnley. So you and Mary have been communing with Nature
together. You will have a cigar before you go?"</p>
<p>Darnley declined the offer. He did not care to stay any longer in Mayfield's
presence. And it was getting on to half-past ten, when he had promised to meet
Slight. He made his excuses and passed across the lawn in the direction of the
avenue. At the end of the rose garden he paused to look back.</p>
<p>He saw the picture of the grand old house standing out in the moonlight; he
could see Mary, pale and silent, a dainty figure in white and amber. He saw
Mayfield bend familiarly to her, and the girl draw coldly away. There was a
fierce tumult in his heart, a desire to go back and proclaim his story. He
could stretch out a hand, and put an end to all that without delay. But he
preferred to wait. He was going to win Mary, and wear her like a white rose on
the shield of a knight. He was going to bend down the barrier of her pride, and
win her for himself alone, as himself, and not as a man who had the advantages
of fortune on his side.</p>
<p>These thoughts filled his mind as he walked down the avenue. He knew that he
had far to go before the goal was in sight. He almost walked over a figure
standing just inside the lodge gates, and his thoughts came tumbling to earth
again.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Slight," he said. "I was miles away just now. Let us sit
on this tree stump in sight of the old house and talk things over."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A LEAF FROM THE PAST</h2>
<p>THE old man stood there in the moonlight, his face agitated and his lips
quivering.</p>
<p>"I can hear the master's voice again," he murmured. "Time seems to have gone
back with me. It is as if you had come like a ghost from the grave, Mr. Ralph.
And it was close here that your father stood, after the great quarrel, and
swore that Dashwood Hall should see him no more...And so you have come back
to claim your own, sir?"</p>
<p>"I must be very like my father, or what my father was like forty years ago,"
Ralph said thoughtfully. "Sit down, Slight, please don't stand looking at me
like that. I did not expect to be recognized in this way, and I am not here to
claim my own, at least, not in the fashion that you mean. My father chose
deliberately to forfeit his inheritance. My grandfather gave him the chance of
coming into his own again. But he always refused, as you know, Slight. And now
Sir George Dashwood reigns in his stead."</p>
<p>"The estate, the title&mdash;everything is yours, Sir Ralph," Slight said
doggedly.</p>
<p>"No, no. Forty years ago there was a great upheaval here. It was a quarrel
that could never be patched up or healed. At the bottom of it was family pride,
the accursed kind of pride that stifles every feeling of humanity and turns
hearts into flints as hard as the nether millstone. The upshot of that quarrel
was a permanent separation between my grandfather and the present dowager Lady
Dashwood; it drove my father into exile. It broke the heart of one of the best
and truest women that ever lived. And all this to keep from so-called
contamination the blood of the Dashwoods. Before my father went away he took
steps to make his sacrifice complete. He executed a deed cutting off the entail
of the estate, so that the late Sir Ralph could do what he pleased with
it."</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand that, Sir Ralph," Slight said.</p>
<p>"Don't address me by that title," Darnley replied. "Let me explain. Most
people believe that a family estate like ours cannot be left elsewhere. But if
the heir likes to execute a deed for the purpose of cutting off the entail as
it is called, why, the holder for the time being can do what he likes with the
property. My father did this with his eyes wide open, and you witnessed the
deed, Slight."</p>
<p>"I recollect it," Slight said slowly. He made the admission grudgingly. "It
was my task to deliver it into the hands of old Sir Ralph. If I had only
known!"</p>
<p>"You would have destroyed it. You would have carried your loyalty to my
father so far. But the deed was delivered to my grandfather and subsequently he
made his will. For twenty years there was silence between father and son, a
silence which was broken at length by the father, who wrote to the son and
asked him to return. Then Sir Ralph wrote once more to my father and said that
he would give the latter twenty years to decide. He had made a will at the same
date as that of the second letter, leaving everything to my father, provided
that within twenty years of that date he claimed his patrimony. If the date
passed, then everything was to go to the man nominated in that will. I need not
say that the man so indicated was Sir George Dashwood. In other words, if I
make no sign for six months, the property becomes his irrevocably. I can claim
the property as my father's heir, and I can produce that will as proof of my
claim."</p>
<p>"But the will was never found," Slight said eagerly. "We looked for a will
everywhere."</p>
<p>"It was hidden away. In old Sir Ralph's last letter to my father he
explained the hiding-place. I have only to let Sir George know where the will
is, and he is safe. For the will directs the finder to the repository of the
deed cutting off the entail, so that Sir George can prove his claim then to
everything. At present he has no more than the income of the estate, and I have
ascertained that he has many old debts to pay off. In addition to this he is
under the thumb of a scoundrel."</p>
<p>"Ay, that he is," Slight muttered. "We servants learn a great deal more than
you gentlemen give us credit for. That Mayfield means mischief. They say that
he's rich. But riches don't content him. He wants to marry Miss Mary. And she
can't bear the look of him. If only he can ruin Sir George, his path will be
clear. Miss Mary would break her heart if she had to leave this place. From a
child she was brought up here, she loves every stick and stone. And she was
always led to believe that some day it would belong to her, because her father
was the last of the old race, seeing that we all regarded Master Ralph as dead
and buried. And Miss Mary had dreams of being mistress here some day, and,
maybe, dreams, too, of a good husband and children of her own. Ay, it's a
terrible weapon this Mayfield has in his hands."</p>
<p>"So it seems," Ralph replied. "I know the rascal well, for he ruined my
father two years ago. Mind you, at that time, I had never heard of Dashwood
Park. I was merely the son of a Mr. Darnley who had done well silver mining in
California. Mayfield came to us in London and we trusted him, trusted him to
such an extent that nearly all we had passed into his hands. It was only on his
death-bed that my father told me everything, told me what my birthright was,
and how I could secure it, if I did not wait too long. So I came down here to
look about me, and to my surprise I found that I had met Miss Mary before in
Paris. Is she a favourite here, Slight?"</p>
<p>"Ay, indeed she is, sir," Slight replied. There was a ring of passionate
sincerity in his speech. "We all love her dearly. Strangers think that she is
cold and distant. It may be so. But we all know the heart of gold that beats
under that placid breast. It is in times of sickness and trouble that we know
of the angel in our midst. I'm not denying that Miss Mary is tainted with the
curse of family pride. But still...Ah, sir, if you ever looked out for a
wife, why there is the very one for you. You the head, and she the mistress. It
would be a happy day for me."</p>
<p>"That is just what I mean," Ralph said quietly. "Slight, I have been in love
with your mistress for two long years. And I am going to marry her some day.
But I have my own idea and my own way of leading up to that happiness. She must
care for me for my own sake, and not because I am Sir Ralph Dashwood, of
Dashwood Hall, and she a&mdash;pauper. No, no. My lady shall stoop to me, she
shall tell me with her own sweet lips that a good man's love is worth all the
pride of place, worth a dozen old families and a score of houses like this.
Then she shall know everything, but not before."</p>
<p>"And that will be too late," sighed Slight. "Before that Mr. Mayfield will
have ruined Sir George, and Miss Mary will marry him to save the old house. She
would make any sacrifice and face any degradation for the sake of her pride.
Though every fibre of her body may call out against the pollution of that man's
touch, she would smile at him before the world and pretend to be happy. It's a
dangerous experiment, Mr. Ralph, and don't you try it. I haven't lived in the
world for nigh on four-score years for nothing. If you love Miss Mary, and if
she comes to care for you, she'll care none the less because you are master of
this good old place. And if her father is ruined&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My good Slight, her father is not going to be ruined. Unless I am greatly
mistaken, he is exceedingly anxious to be rid of Horace Mayfield. I presume it
is a mere matter of money, and for the sake of argument call it &pound;50,000.
Sir George owes Mayfield that sum. In the present circumstances he could not
hope to repay it. A disgraceful bankruptcy may follow, a criminal collapse
even, for Mayfield would not hesitate where his desires and interests are
concerned. But suppose I could show Sir George a way to get this money? In that
case he could rid himself of that scoundrel at any sacrifice. I have only to
let Sir George know where the will is hidden and he is free."</p>
<p>"It would be wrong, sir, cruelly wrong to yourself," Slight cried. "You
could never appear after that and claim your own. Sir George would be no more
than an innocent impostor. And you, the real master of Dashwood, would be
compelled to earn your bread."</p>
<p>"I don't see it exactly," Ralph smiled. "My father never intended to claim
his inheritance. He cut himself off from England deliberately. And after all
these years, would it not be a cruel thing to deprive Miss Mary of a home which
she has come to regard as her own? But I have made up my mind, Slight, and
nothing shall deter me from it. You may call me a visionary and a dreamer if
you like, but my hands are strong and capable, and I have been taught to use my
head. I want you to be discreet and silent; I want you to be my witness when
the time comes. I should not have taken you into my confidence, but that you
recognized me at once. All day I have been wandering about the dear old place.
I have studied all its ancient beauties. We can't wonder that Miss Mary has
come to regard it as part of her life. It has cost me more than a passing
effort to restrain my covetousness."</p>
<p>Ralph stifled a sigh as he looked about him. He could see the fine old house
clear cut against the sky; in the park the oaks and beeches hung like great
sentinels guarding the home of the ages. And it was so still and peaceful, so
suggestive of all that is worth having in life. A cry from somewhere broke the
perfect silence, the bleat of a sheep from distant pastures.</p>
<p>"It shall be as you wish, sir," Slight said at length. "I could never refuse
your father anything, and I can refuse you nothing when you look at me out of
the past with his eyes. But sorrow and trouble will come of this; you mark my
words."</p>
<p>"No, no," Ralph cried as he rose to his feet. "True and sterling happiness,
the death and destruction of the family pride which has been our curse for many
generations. I am going my own way to work and you are going to help me. Now
come and show me the big window in the staircase that my father used when he
wanted to leave the house late at night to visit poor Maria Edgerton, the
child-wife, the child of the people, who was killed by our family pride as
surely as if she had been murdered. My mother was a good woman, Slight, she had
her husband's respect and affection, but his heart was always with the girl who
suffered so much to become his wife. I hope that her grave has never been
neglected, Slight."</p>
<p>"No, sir," Slight said huskily. "We have seen to that&mdash;her ladyship and
myself between us. That is the window, sir, the big stained glass one with the
light behind it. You can get up on to the leads with the aid of the ivy. At the
bottom of the window is a brass knob. If you press it, the window opens
inwards, and there you are. But I hope you don't need to burgle your own house,
seeing that you are a welcome guest there. And, as I was saying just
now&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker paused, for the soft, rich silence of the night was broken by a
cry. The long drawing-room window leading to the lawn was still open; the
lamplight flooded on pictures and china and flowers. A figure came to the
window, a tall figure with upraised hands and hair wild and dishevelled.</p>
<p>"You scoundrel," the figure cried. "You have done this to ruin me!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE SACRIFICE</h2>
<p>The speaker's tones rang out with passionate vehemence. He stumbled down the
steps, into the garden, and repeated his accusation loudly. It all seemed
strangely out of place there, Ralph thought; it was no spot for sordid
emotions, and angry passions. The words rang clear and loud to the startled
vault of heaven; a blackbird started from her nest and flew across the lawn
with nervous twitter. Then another figure came from the drawing-room, the trim,
immaculate figure of Horace Mayfield.</p>
<p>"For goodness' sake, control yourself Dashwood," he said curtly. "There is
nothing in the world to make all this ridiculous fuss about. It is all the
fortune of war. We tried to get the best of these fellows, and they looted us
instead. It was no fault of mine that these cablegrams miscarried. My manager
has sold me&mdash;a thing that sometimes happens in the City. All we have to do
is to pay and look pleasant."</p>
<p>"But I can't pay, and you know it. Nobody understands the tenure on which I
hold the property better than you do. If I wait for the money, what
happens?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid it will be very awkward," Mayfield said. "People will refuse to
believe that you have been a victim of a fraud. They will actually regard the
fraud as your own. Whereas, if you pay up cheerfully, nothing can be said.
Personally, I am all right. I kept my name out of the business so that you
could have all the credit. Unfortunately, you will get all the blame as well.
There may not be a prosecution; of course, it is not an easy matter to get the
Public Prosecutor to interfere in these cases. The only thing for it is to take
the bull by the horns and get out of all by paying."</p>
<p>Sir George laughed in a bitter kind of way. He stood with his back to the
house, facing the man who had brought all this about. He seemed to be almost
beside himself with fury. The whole man was transformed.</p>
<p>"I have no money," he said, "and you know it. You have deliberately brought
me to this pass for purposes of your own. You have traded upon my love of
gambling to get me into your hands. And I might have been happy and comfortable
here. I was getting rid of my millstone of debt so nicely when you came along
once more. But for you, I should not stand here now outside my own home, an
honoured house for three centuries, a ruined and desperate man with a vision of
a prisoner's dock before me. You are a rich man&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Possibly, Dashwood. At any rate, I am in a position to find money. But
there is no kind of friendship or sentiment when one comes to business. You are
not a child that you can accuse me of luring you to your ruin. Still, I am not
disposed to take offence. I will undertake to settle the matter for you in
time. But you must have a joint guarantee and I want another person to become
security for you. You understand what I mean. If Miss Mary will be so good as
to give me her word&mdash;"</p>
<p>A sudden cry of passion broke from the older man. He seemed to lose all
control of himself. He dashed forward and smote Mayfield with fury on the
mouth. The latter staggered back a thin streak of blood trickling from his
under lip.</p>
<p>There was no outbreak, no display of passion, on the part of Mayfield. He
was surprised and shaken by the impetuosity of the attack, but he stood there
calmly, as he wiped the blood from his face. His features might have been
carved out of solid marble, and the full light of the moon heightened the
effect. In spite of his knowledge of the man, Ralph could not but admire him at
that moment. One who could keep his feelings under such control would prove a
dangerous foe.</p>
<p>It was a strange, weird scene altogether, terrible and repulsive by very
force of contrast. The environment was so quiet and peaceful, so exalted and
refined. Ralph stood as if rooted to the spot. He saw Sir George advance again,
he saw the hand upraised once more. All the pride of rank and place had fallen
from the man; he was transformed for the moment to a savage. Then Mayfield
caught the uplifted arm and held it in a grip like a vice.</p>
<p>"You will gain nothing by this," he said quietly. "You seem to forget that I
am a guest under your roof. Would you alarm your servants, would you have them
know what their master is, when all his passions are aroused? Come, sir, this
is not what one has a right to expect from the owner of Dashwood Park. You owe
me an apology&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words were lost on Sir George. He wrenched himself free, he turned and
faced the house with uplifted arms. The demon of anger still possessed him.</p>
<p>"I owe you nothing," he cried. "But for you I should be one of the happiest
men alive. If I had been content to pay off old debts by degrees nothing would
have happened. But I listened to you, with what result you know. You are a
trickster and a cheat, a liar and a knave. You have laid a trap for me, and I
have tumbled into it with my eyes open. What you mean to say in as many words
is this&mdash;unless I can procure the sum of &pound;50,000 in a few days I
stand every chance of a criminal prosecution. You know exactly how I am
situated, you know that I am helpless."</p>
<p>"You are not in the least helpless," Mayfield said sternly. "To a certain
extent the fault is mine, and I am prepared to do all that is in my power. You
have only to say the word and the money is yours. Promise me that your daughter
shall become my wife, get her to say the word, and the situation is absolutely
changed. I neither admit nor deny your accusations. You could not prove
them&mdash;a jury would give a verdict against you, if you tried to do so. And
if Miss Mary does me the honour to become my wife&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never," Dashwood cried. "Never in this world. Our women only wed honourable
men."</p>
<p>"Is that really so? And what manner of man will the world call you if I fail
to come to your assistance? Control yourself&mdash;listen to me for a moment.
Do you realise what will happen to you if I go away without coming to some
understanding? The police will come here and arrest you, it may be when you are
entertaining friends. They will take you away, with handcuffs on your wrists.
You will stand in the dock charged with a vulgar conspiracy to defraud innocent
shareholders, and the charge will be proved. And if you ever come out of gaol
again, it will be as a broken and dispirited man. It will be useless, when it
is too late, to look for any consideration from me, I am not likely to forget
the blow you dealt me just now. And, whilst you are raving like a lunatic, we
might be settling the matter comfortably over a cigar. You are a man of the
world; at least you will be once more when this fit of midsummer madness has
passed. Explain everything to your daughter if you like, put any face upon it
that you please. Agree to my conditions and you can sleep in peace to-night,
and every other night, for the matter of that. Listen to the voice of reason,
and I will forget the treatment I have had at your hands."</p>
<p>But Sir George was not listening. Apparently a terrible struggle was going
on in his breast. He could see now, how neatly and cleverly he had been
trapped, he could see that he had no remedy against the man who had schemed for
this position. And he was innocent himself of anything dishonourable. And now
to give his daughter to this man! The mere idea was horrible. The meanest hound
on the estate was far better off than Sir George at this moment.</p>
<p>"Do your worst," he shouted. His voice rang out on the startled silence. "Do
your worst. If I could kill you now, I would do so. You are not fit to live,
your presence is an insult to any honest man. I can see nothing, I am going
blind..."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A CRUEL
MISUNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p>Sir George clasped his hands to his eyes; everything for the moment had
faded from his sight. The blood was rushing wildly through his head; there was
a din like the clang of hammers in his brain. He was beside himself with grief
and passion. His voice uprose again and broke the stillness of the night
horribly. What were his title and his old family worth now? It was all as
nothing, in the presence of this threatened calamity.</p>
<p>"Mary, Mary," he cried, "come to me. Come, whilst I have the strength left
to tell you the truth. To-morrow I shall be too weak, to-morrow I shall not
dare to give all this up. Come, and tell him that you will have none of
him."</p>
<p>The speech ended in a yearning scream. It was a strange setting for so
peaceful a scene. Ralph Darnley made a step forward, with the impulse to
interfere, strong upon him. Then a figure came between the light and the
window, and Mary appeared. She stood there, tall and stately in her white
dress; her eyes were filled with stern disapproval. She came slowly down the
steps and stood between the two men. She did not fail to notice Mayfield's cut
lip and the spot or two of blood on his gleaming shirt front.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this?" she asked. "Father, you don't mean to
say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ay, but I do," Dashwood said doggedly. "I struck him. Would that I had
killed him! There would be far less disgrace for the family in the end. I
struck him, and he took it quietly like the cur and craven that he is!"</p>
<p>"I hardly think that I deserve that," Mayfield said. "Whatever my failings
may be, you will not find a lack of physical courage amongst them. Sir George
has been very unfortunate in his speculations, and he chooses to blame me for
it. We only got the news late to-night. A man in whom we trusted has played the
knave, and Sir George is likely to suffer for it. To put the matter quite
plainly, unless your father can find a very large sum of money in a few days he
will probably be prosecuted. One can make any allowance for his feelings in the
circumstances, but that is no reason why he should accuse one of deliberately
laying a plot to ruin him. As to the assault upon me, why let it pass. In the
excitement of the moment&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pardon me," Mary said quietly, "I heard my name mentioned. My father's
voice was raised so loudly that I could not help hearing something of what
passed. You did me the honour to say that I might avert the catastrophe."</p>
<p>"That is so," Mayfield retorted in the same self-contained manner. "In
certain circumstances I am prepared to stand by your father. I can say that it
is a misunderstanding so far as he is concerned, and that I am prepared to take
over the venture as it stands, and pay everybody who has lost confidence in it.
I could write to the Press and vindicate the honour of the man who stood in the
light of prospective father-in-law to me."</p>
<p>The girl's face whitened in the moonlight. Ralph could see the heaving of
her breast. She had taken in the situation like a flash of inspiration. There
was none of the grinning triumph of the successful rogue on Mayfield's face; it
was all being quietly and decorously done, but the grip of iron was there all
the same, the iron hand in the velvet glove. Mary essayed to speak, but words
failed her for the moment. Sir George stood between the man and his prey with
trembling hands outstretched as if to keep them apart. His lips opened, he
gabbled something too incoherent for understanding, then he collapsed like a
heap of black cloth on the grass. Something seemed to snap in his brain, then a
blank came over him.</p>
<p>Mary forgot everything else in the dictates of humanity. With a cry she
knelt on the grass by the side of the stricken man. Ralph came forward, slowly
followed by Slight. It seemed natural that he should be there at that moment.
Mary turned towards him instantly. Here was the friend in need that she so
sorely prayed for.</p>
<p>"It is some kind of seizure," she said. "My father had one two years ago in
Paris. He was warned then to avoid any undue excitement. Will you please help
me to carry him to his room? Slight, call a groom up and send him to Longtown
for a doctor."</p>
<p>"No occasion," Mayfield remarked. "Give me the key of the stables, and I
will take my car into Longtown and bring the doctor back with me. It will take
less time."</p>
<p>It was a weary two hours that passed before the doctor arrived. Still, his
account was a fairly cheerful one when it came. It was merely a case of rest
and quietness and careful nursing. Sir George had fallen into a kind of
troubled sleep.</p>
<p>Ralph turned to go. Mayfield had volunteered to take the doctor home again.
Slight was sitting with his master till Mary was ready to return. She stood by
the window leading to the lawn; that means of exit was as good as any other,
Ralph said.</p>
<p>"What were you doing outside to-night?" the girl asked keenly.</p>
<p>"We will go into that another time," Ralph suggested. "I did not mean to
listen, but I heard everything. Did I not tell you that Mayfield was a
villain?"</p>
<p>"I have felt it before now. Without any apparent cause for it, I have
detested that man. And he has always acted as if he had only to say the word
and I would consent to be his wife. On two occasions I have refused him. To
think that men should be such villains where innocent girls are concerned! Of
course, he has led my father into a terrible position, and my hand is to be the
price of his freedom. Ralph, I am so dreadfully, horribly afraid of that man!
How wonderfully he must have controlled himself when my father struck him! And
how cleverly he insinuated that he might be allowed to appear as my future
husband. I tell you I would give up everything to be free of this tangle. What
is my pride, what is my home here, so long as the happiness of a lifetime is at
stake!"</p>
<p>"That is a lesson that I have tried to teach you before," Ralph said
quietly. "Mary, I love you. The time will come when you will love me. If ever
you needed a friend in your life, you need one at this moment. I could show you
a way out, but after that I should never dare to claim my reward, because the
obligation in your eyes would be too great. I want you to care for me for my
own sake. Still, you need have no anxiety. Within the next few hours Mayfield
will be powerless to harm you."</p>
<p>"Ralph, you speak in enigmas. I pray you to be plain. Can't you trust
me?"</p>
<p>"My dear, in this matter I cannot trust anybody; by Heaven, I can hardly
trust myself. Ah, if you only knew how I love you and how great the temptation
is! But the reward that I am working for will be all the sweeter when the time
comes. Go sleep now with a calm mind, for I pledge my honour that things shall
be as I say."</p>
<p>Mary's two hands had fluttered out to Ralph. She was moved by the deep
sincerity of his words, for a broken smile, half respect and half affection,
quivered on her face. With an impulse that he could not resist, Ralph drew the
girl to him and laid his lips on hers. Then, with a sigh, he put her from him
and turned towards the window.</p>
<p>"There," he said, "I ask no pardon for my audacity. I could not help it. And
that kiss was as pure as if it came from your mother's lips."</p>
<p>"The first from any man," Mary murmured, a pink flush on her face. "You are
a good man, Ralph, and it is a pity I did not meet you before the curse of the
family pride fell upon me. Good night, and God bless you for all your kindness
to me."</p>
<p>The window closed and the blind fell, the lights in the house began to
vanish one by one, and still Ralph lingered there on the grass. He saw Mayfield
return, he saw the last ray extinguished, save for the solitary glow in Sir
George's bedroom. A clock over the stables struck the hour of two, and still
Ralph stood there oblivious of the flight of time.</p>
<p>He was thinking of the dramatic scene of the evening. More than once he
mourned his lost opportunities. He had all the strings in his own hand, the
game was entirely his, and he felt, too, that in spite of her fateful pride,
Mary was beginning to care for him. If not, why had she taken his kiss so
sweetly? Ralph had only to proclaim his identity, he had merely to prove his
title to the estate, and at once he would be in the position to free the
present occupier of Dashwood Hall of his peril. And Mary would not refuse to
marry the man whose blood was as pure as hers. But Ralph had made up his mind
what to do. He would win her love as Ralph Darnley, afterwards the truth could
be told. Why not to-night? he asked himself. There was no time like the
present. He would go and find the will, he would let Sir George know where it
was.</p>
<p>The house was still now, and Ralph knew the way...He was in the long
corridor presently, here was the old oak dower-chest and the panel below it.
Here was the spring by which the panel was released. The thing was ridiculously
easy.</p>
<p>Ralph pressed in the spring and the panel came away. Within it was a long
manuscript written on thick white paper. Ralph thrilled as he read the
endorsement. Beyond doubt, here was the will of his grandfather, Sir Ralph
Dashwood. All this was quite plain in the moonlight. It only needed now to put
the will at the bottom of the dower-chest and write a letter to Sir George
anonymously, and tell him where to seek for it. And Ralph had only to be silent
henceforth, and the deception would pass for all time. Verily Mayfield's
triumph was likely to be a very short one, and...</p>
<p>Somebody was speaking to Ralph: Mary, with her hair over her shoulders, and
a candle in her hand. Her face was cold and set, her eyes filled with stern
displeasure.</p>
<p>"Thief in the night," she said. "What is the meaning of this, Mr.
Darnley?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE ONLY WAY</h2>
<p>A sense of blinding, unreasonable anger held Ralph for the moment. He was
doing nothing wrong. He was acting entirely for the best, and here he was taken
under the most shameful conditions&mdash;a miserable, degraded thief in the
night. From the coldness of Mary's voice, from the scorn in her eyes, he could
read the reflection of her thoughts. And yet he was acting from the highest and
most honourable motives. Surely no man was ever impelled by a loftier idea of
self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>"I ask what you are doing," Mary repeated. "Do not tax my patience too
far."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the menace in those clearcut tones. Thus would the
daughter of the house of Dashwood address a burglar or other midnight intruder.
Ralph felt that she would have been not in the least afraid to face a felon of
that type; his face tingled as he felt himself set down in the same category.
He cudgelled his brains for some plausible explanation which should be anything
but the right one. The edge of the failing moon still left a shaft of pallid
light shining through the great stained glass window; it flung into high relief
the arms and motto of the family of Dashwood. And those arms and that motto
belonged to the man who stood there with the shamefaced air of a boy caught in
a fault.</p>
<p>"I am still waiting for you to speak," Mary went on. "It is possible that
there may be some explanation of this amazing conduct of yours."</p>
<p>The cold, proud voice seemed to doubt it all the same. And yet one word
would have swept all the clouds of suspicion away. Ralph knew that it lay in
his power to bring that white, haughty figure to her knees; one inkling of the
truth and the whole situation was changed. For all this belonged to Ralph; Mary
was no more than an honoured guest in the house. Yes, it all belonged to him,
the grand old house, the matchless pictures, the furniture from the time of
Elizabeth, the great sweeps of upland country, and the farms lying snug under
their red roofs.</p>
<p>A few words spoken, and what a difference there would be! Those words meant
that Ralph would have held out his hands and asked Mary to come and help him to
reign here. Ay, and she would have come, too. Her point of view would be
entirely changed. And she must love him. Indeed, he had more than a feeling
that she loved him now, without being aware of the state of her affections. Her
heart would go out to him, and there would be peace and happiness for
evermore.</p>
<p>The temptation was great, so great that the beads of perspiration stood out
on Ralph's forehead. But he crushed the temptation down; his pride came to his
assistance. No, when Mary came to love, she should love the man for his own
sake, she should tell him so, and Dashwood should be as nothing in
comparison.</p>
<p>"I came here to look for something," Ralph said at length.</p>
<p>"Indeed! Judging by what you hold in your hand I should say that you have
found it. How did you manage to obtain entrance to the house?"</p>
<p>"Quite a simple matter," Ralph replied. "I climbed on to the leads outside
the big window. By pressing a knob outside, the window can be made to
open."</p>
<p>"Really! I have lived here practically all my life, and I was not aware of
that fact. For an absolute stranger, your knowledge of the house is exceedingly
comprehensive. May I ask if you have found what you were looking for?"</p>
<p>"I have," Ralph said huskily. "Permit me to replace it in the old chest.
To-morrow, if your father is well enough, I will see him and explain. I beg to
assure you that I have what criminal lawyers call a perfect answer to the
charge."</p>
<p>"And you ask me to believe this?" Mary burst out passionately. "How do I
know that you are not one of those who are in league against us? How do I know
that your indignation against Horace Mayfield is not all assumed?"</p>
<p>"How do you know that I am a gentleman?" Ralph retorted. "You cannot explain
why."</p>
<p>"Indeed I cannot," Mary said bitterly. "I trusted you, I regarded you as a
friend. I asked for your assistance and you promised it to me. In my heart I
thanked God that I had a friend that I could rely upon. Actually, you caused me
to forget the difference between our stations in life. And now!"</p>
<p>The girl paused, with something like tears in her voice. She looked very
sweet and womanly at that moment, Ralph thought. He could afford to ignore the
suggestion of the social gulf between them. The temptation to tell the truth
came over him again, but once more he fought the impulse and conquered it.</p>
<p>"In spite of your distressful pride, you are a very woman," he said. "I am
your friend and more than your friend. For your sake, there is nothing that I
would not do. It is for your sake that I am here to-night, strange as it may
seem. A little time ago, fate placed me in possession of certain information
closely touching on the fortunes of your house. Please do not ask me to
explain, for I cannot do so without spoiling everything. Call me a
sentimentalist, if you like&mdash;perhaps the air of the grand old place has
affected me. Anyway, there it is. I came here to-night to place you in
possession of certain information that would for ever have rid you of the
hateful presence of the man who calls himself Horace Mayfield. I did not want
to place you under any kind of obligation, so I chose this method&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But why?" Mary exclaimed. "Why? Have you not saved my life twice? Could a
million obligations like this increase the burden of my debt of gratitude to
you?"</p>
<p>"That is right," Ralph admitted. "Call me a Quixote if you like. I am. The
day will come when your eyes will be no longer blind, when love will come
before everything. I have my own way of getting my ends, and am too proud to
rely upon anything but myself. I am going to make you happy, and you are going
to be the mainspring of that happiness."</p>
<p>Ralph spoke almost with the spirit of prophecy upon him. It would all come
right some day, but he little dreamed of the trouble and tribulation that were
near at hand. All he could see now was that Mary's eyes were growing dim and
softer.</p>
<p>"My knowledge is going to save you," Ralph went on. "But I did not wish you
to know that I had any hand in the business. As I said before, you must not ask
me to explain. I want you to give me your hand, and to say that you regard me
as being still beyond suspicion. Oh, I know that it is a deal to ask. But a
long pedigree and the possession of a grand old house are not necessary to the
honour of a man. I admit that I crept here like a thief in the night. If you
charged me, I should have nothing to say, my character would be forever ruined.
If you&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ralph paused, and his face flushed with annoyance. A petulant voice calling
for Mary broke the silence&mdash;shuffling feet came along the corridor.
Dishevelled and dazed. Sir George Dashwood stood there, candle in hand, looking
from the glorious white figure with the rippling golden hair to the faint
outline of Darnley. The old man was haggard and trembling, yet a certain
dignity sustained him.</p>
<p>"I have called you three times," he said. "I needed you, my child. I woke up
with my head better and a raging thirst upon me. Then I thought that I heard
voices here and I came out. The situation, Mr. Darnley, is singular. Permit me
to remind you that it is not the usual thing&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker paused. He seemed to be struggling for words to express his
feelings.</p>
<p>"Quite so, Sir George," Ralph said eagerly. "I&mdash;came back for
something. I helped you into the house after your illness overcame you. Forgive
me if I seem to have stayed a little too long in my anxiety to be of
assistance. If you will take my advice you will go back to your room without
delay."</p>
<p>Sir George muttered something to the effect that he was very tired. He
babbled about cool springs in the woods, he accepted Mary's arm as a weary
child might do. It seemed almost impossible to believe that this was the
sprightly, gallant figure that Ralph had known in Paris so short a time ago.
But when Ralph had gone by the way in which he had come, and once more Sir
George was in his bedroom, a change came over him. He eagerly drank the
soda-water that Mary had procured for him.</p>
<p>"No, no," he cried, "tired as I am, I cannot sleep yet. I was half asleep, I
was between waking and dreaming, and I was dying of thirst. I came out into the
corridor and saw you standing there with Ralph Darnley. There were certain
words that seemed to be burned into my brain with letters of fire. You were
angry with him, and yet he was going to be a friend to us. That was no common
thief in the night, Mary. What was it he found? What was it that was going to
rid us of the hateful presence of Horace Mayfield? Don't tell me that I was
dreaming, don't say that it was all a cruel delusion on my part. The secret,
the secret, girl."</p>
<p>The words came like a torrent. Out of his white and hazard face, Dashwood's
eyes gleamed like restless stars on a windy night. The clutch on the girl's arm
was almost painful in its intensity. Mary wondered why she was trembling
so.</p>
<p>"Hush," she said. "You must sleep now, or you will be really ill again.
Leave it till the morning, when you will be better able to understand. I cannot
tell you now; indeed, I know no more than you do yourself. But now you must go
to sleep!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;FOUND!</h2>
<p>Sir George lay back on the bed with weary eyelids closed. His last effort
had cost him more than he knew. Mary's will had conquered for the moment, and
he felt disposed to obey. All the same the strange thread of logical reason was
going on in his mind. The only thing that could save him and preserve the proud
traditions of the Dashwoods must be something in the way of papers or documents
of some kind. He lay there, allowing Mary to make him comfortable for the
night. He lay there long after the girl had departed to her own room and the
house was wrapped in close slumber. But the quietness was soothing to Sir
George's brain. His mind was growing stronger and more logical; the dazed dream
of the scene in the corridor began to shape itself into concrete facts.</p>
<p>What had Ralph Darnley been saying? Yes, it was all coming back now. Darnley
had learned certain facts somewhere, bearing on the fortunes of the house of
Dashwood. Surely there was nothing so wildly improbable in this, seeing that
Ralph Darnley had passed the best part of his life in America. The late Ralph
Dashwood, the original heir to the property, had lived in America, too. Of
course, America was a large continent, but that was no reason why Ralph
Dashwood and Darnley's father should not have been friends. Had not Ralph
Darnley admitted that he had business in the neighbourhood of Dashwood Hall?
Perhaps he had come to make money out of his information. But then the young
fellow was a gentleman, and would not stoop to that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Still, he knew there was no getting away from the fact, for had not Dashwood
heard it from the younger man's lips? A means whereby it was possible to get
rid of Horace Mayfield for ever! The mere idea sent the blood throbbing through
the sick man's veins, and brought him in a sitting position in bed. That meant
documents or papers of some kind; it could really mean nothing else. Dashwood
remembered vividly now that Ralph had been standing by the old dower-chest in
the corridor and that he had had a paper in his hand. So far as Dashwood knew,
the old chest had not been opened for years. It was by no means a bad
hiding-place. Perhaps&mdash;</p>
<p>Slowly the sick man dragged himself to his feet. He had promised Mary that
he would lie quietly there till the morning, but he could not find it in his
heart to keep that promise. Sleep was out of the question. Dashwood looked at
his watch to find that it was only just half-past three, five hours before it
would be time to rise. It seemed like an eternity. And all the while that
fiend, Horace Mayfield, was sleeping under the same roof. Suppose he had been
listening to what was going on. Suppose that he had had his suspicions
attracted to the dower-chest! The mere thought was intolerable; it was
impossible to lie there with such a torture praying on his mind. And the house
was as still as death.</p>
<p>Sir George lighted his candle, though the bright summer dawn was creeping up
from the east and the birds were beginning to twitter outside in the garden.
The long corridor was getting pink and saffron with the strengthening colour
from the great window. And under it lay the object of the sick man's search.
Here it was with the lid unfastened and a mass of papers on the top. The first
document was long in shape, neatly folded, and bearing an endorsement in a
legal hand. The paper was yellow and faded, but the ink was quite plain for the
eye to read. Yes, here it was, right enough, the yellow paper that meant
happiness to all and the full splendour of the house of Dashwood.</p>
<p>"How did he know, how did he discover it?" Sir George muttered. "My hands
are so shaky that I can hardly hold the paper. The will of Sir Ralph Dashwood,
dated 1877, and duly witnessed by the family lawyer and his clerk...Provided
that for the space of twenty years after this date my son Ralph does not appear
either by himself or by the heir or heirs male of his body...Ah, six months
more and the property comes to me absolutely! Strange that the will should come
to light so near to the time appointed by Sir Ralph for&mdash;but that hardly
helps me, seeing that my danger is so close at hand...What is this? A deed
executed by Ralph Dashwood the younger cutting off the entail...I wonder
where that is? Perhaps the yellow sheet of parchment lying by the side of the
will...By Heavens it is! Oh, this is a direct interposition of Providence to
save the good old name from disgrace. And this is what Ralph Darnley was
looking for as a pleasant surprise for me. Armed with these documents, I can
raise all the money necessary. I can kick Horace Mayfield out of the house, I
can&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker staggered to his feet and pressed his hands to his throbbing,
reeling head.</p>
<p>He was nearer to collapse again than he knew. He would have denied the fact
that he was terribly afraid of Mayfield, but it was true all the same. The aim
of the financier had never been quite hidden from his eyes; for some time past
he had an instinctive knowledge of what Mayfield was after. His family pride
had bidden him to have no more of Mayfield, but he had not listened. Proud as
he was, he had not hesitated to stoop to gambling transactions, with the risk
that he would not be able to pay his debts if he lost. Surely he deserved a
sharp lesson and a cruel awakening.</p>
<p>But he was free now, fortune was on his side. His great good luck sent him
trembling from head to foot like some amazed criminal who has been discharged
by a stupid jury. He would have to give up nothing. He was still Sir George
Dashwood with a grand estate, and a house with a history of three hundred years
behind it. He would go to London to-morrow with those papers in his possession
and his bankers would be ready to accommodate him to any amount in reason. He
would pay the sum that Mayfield had mentioned, and wash his hands of the whole
transaction. He would show the world how a country gentleman deals with these
things. It never struck Dashwood that he was a feeble creature who had juggled
with the good name that he proposed to hold so highly; he little realized the
deep self-abnegation that had led to this dazzling piece of good fortune.</p>
<p>"Kick Mayfield out," he repeated, "after breakfast. Let him see that I am
not in the least afraid of him; make him understand that we are little better
than strangers for the future. Ah, that will be a triumph."</p>
<p>He hugged the papers to his breast, like a mother with a child. There were
weak and senile tears in his eyes. He had lost nothing after all; the fine old
house, the wide and well-kept estate, the great timber in the park and the deer
there, were all his. He started as the sound of a footstep fell upon his ears.
It seemed to him that somebody was creeping along the corridor. Perhaps it was
Mayfield, who had found out what had happened. Mayfield was strong and
unscrupulous, and he might try to gain possession of those papers by force. Sir
George would have hidden himself, but it was too late, and besides it was broad
daylight now.</p>
<p>The first rays of the morning sun shone on the old man as he stood there
huddling those precious papers to his breast. He might have been some clumsy
thief detected in the act. With a sigh of relief he recognized the figure of
Slight coming in his direction. The old butler only looked a shade less
distracted than his master, and his eyes were drawn and haggard; obviously he
had not been to bed.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;what are you doing here?" Sir George stammered. "Why are you
spying upon me like this? Why are you down so early?"</p>
<p>Slight made no reply. His gaze was fixed in a dazed kind of way on the
papers which Sir George was still hugging to his breast. There was something
like horror in the old man's eyes. There might have been the proofs of murder
there.</p>
<p>"So you've got them," he said in the voice of one who talks to himself. "So
he has carried out his threat and they have passed into your possession. Take
and burn them, take and pitch them on the fire, and watch them till the last
ash has vanished. You will be a happier man for it, Sir George, and a great
wrong will be averted."</p>
<p>"What does the man mean?" Sir George cried in astonishment. "Slight, what
are you talking about? Say it all over again. If you are mad or
drunk&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not mad," Slight said mournfully. He seemed to have come to his senses
suddenly. He spoke now as one does when acting under a great restraint. "Not
mad, Sir George, and as to the other thing, why...But the secret is not
mine. I promised solemnly not to open my lips. I have given you the best advice
one man can give another, but more I dare not say. Burn them, burn them, burn
them, for the love of Heaven!"</p>
<p>Slight turned away and seemed to totter down the corridor. The full light of
the strong morning sun was shining through the gold and crimson glories of the
great stained glass window now, the birds were singing sweetly outside. The
park grew fair and green as the dew rolled back across the fields; the garden
blazed in the sunshine. Sir George saw all this as he looked through his
bedroom window. The fierce joy and pride of undisputed possession were upon
him; everything was safe now.</p>
<p>"Slight is mad," he murmured. "What does that old man know? What can he
know? Let me put these papers away where they will be safe. How shaky I feel;
how my head swims! If I could only get an hour or two of sleep..."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE PARTING GUEST</h2>
<p>The big clock on the breakfast-room mantelpiece was chiming the hour of ten
as Sir George came downstairs. He was a little later than usual, and he
apologized to his guest for his want of punctuality with a courtly air. He was
not accustomed to country hours, he said; he doubted if he ever should be. He
made no allusion whatever to his last night's quarrel, his manner was perfectly
natural and easy. If anything, there was a suggestion of bland patronage in his
tone.</p>
<p>Mayfield glanced keenly at his host from time to time. There was something
here that he quite failed to understand. He had expected to find Sir George
apologetic and rather frightened. On the contrary, he was more like a bishop
who entertains a curate than anything else. And Mayfield could get nothing from
Mary, who sat at the head of the table, cold and stately, yet serenely
beautiful, in her white cotton dress. Mayfield ground his teeth together and
swore that Dashwood should pay for this before long. He held the fortunes of
the baronet in the hollow of his hand; his passion for Mary was the more
inflamed by her icy coldness. It would be good to humble her pride in the dust,
to compel her to come to his feet and do his bidding. All the same, Mayfield
had made up his mind to have an explanation after breakfast. He smiled and
talked, though his anger was hot within him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mayfield will want a time-table presently, my dear," Sir George was
saying in his most courtly manner. "I am afraid that we have intruded too long
already on his valuable time."</p>
<p>"I have always time to spare for you," Mayfield said with a snarling smile.
"And Miss Mary need not trouble about the time-table. You forget that I have my
car here which will get me to London by mid-day. Before I go I should like to
have a few words with you, Sir George. You will pardon me for mentioning it,
but we left matters in rather an unsatisfactory condition last night."</p>
<p>The little shaft passed harmlessly over Sir George's head. He smiled
blandly.</p>
<p>"To be sure we did," he said. "You are quite right, we will settle things up
before you go. What do you say to a cigar on the terrace after breakfast? No,
you need not go, Mary. I have a reason for asking you to listen to our business
conversation. We had a quarrel last night, when I regret to say I lost my
temper. For that exhibition of unseemly and vulgar violence I sincerely beg
your pardon, Mayfield. I apologize all the more humbly because we are not
likely to meet very often in the future. Henceforth our business transactions
promise to be slender, for after this week I am determined that the City shall
not see me again. You will quite see, Mayfield, that in future our intercourse
must cease. It is rather painful to talk to a guest like this, but you will
understand me."</p>
<p>Mayfield's face expressed his astonishment. He wondered if Sir George had
taken leave of his senses, and deluded himself into the belief that he was the
possessor of a vast fortune. And yet the speaker was absolutely calm and
collected. What could possibly have happened since last night to change him
like this?</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am rather dense this morning," Mayfield said slowly, "but I
cannot follow you at all. Yesterday I explained to you the position of affairs
fully. We had been deceived by a trusted servant of mine, and you were called
upon to pay &pound;50,000. Failing this, you would perhaps have to face a
criminal charge. Unfortunately, your hold upon the estate is so slender that it
would not be possible for you to borrow any large sum of money. Not to speak
too plainly, your position was, and is, a desperate one. Partly because I was
in a measure instrumental in bringing about this lamentable state of affairs, I
offered to advance you the money. In other words, I offered to give you
&pound;50,000. It is true there was a condition, but I merely allude to that in
the presence of Miss Dashwood."</p>
<p>Mary's face flamed. Her heart was heavy within her. So far as she could see,
this was the master of the situation. He held the demons of Disgrace and
Bankruptcy at bay. What was the cherished possession of Dashwood worth so long
as the shadow of dishonour lay across the threshold? For the sake of the grand
old home and the grand old name, Mary would have to listen to Mayfield's
proposal. She glanced from him to the smiling face of her father, who had risen
from the table and produced his cigar case.</p>
<p>"Quite so," he said genially, "you are perfectly correct. You made that
proposal, and, like a cur, I forgot myself and insulted you. I went so far as
to say that you had planned deliberately to bring this thing about. It was ruin
on the one hand and the sacrifice of my dear child on the other. Pray take one
of my cigars. There are chairs on the terrace, let us continue our discussion
there."</p>
<p>"Why go over the old ground again?" Mayfield asked impatiently. He flung
himself into one of the big basket chairs on the terrace. "Has there been any
material change in the position since last night? Not a bit of it. If you could
find this money&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no if about it, my good Mayfield," Sir George replied. "I can find
the money. It will be paid over to my creditors by the end of the week, and I
will take care to let the world know what a victim I have been. The money will
be paid."</p>
<p>A quick angry cry came from Mayfield's lips. The mask had fallen from his
face for the moment. His disappointment was clear and hideous.</p>
<p>"What?" he exclaimed hoarsely. "Do you mean to say that you have found the
wi&mdash;"</p>
<p>He paused and shut his lips together with a vicious click. He was going to
say too much. He glanced at Sir George to see if the imprudent words had had
any effect on him, but the head of the Dashwoods seemed to be immersed in his
own pleasant thoughts. Only Mary noticed, but it was not till many days
afterwards that she was to attach any significance to the speech.</p>
<p>"The money is going to be paid," Sir George went on. "By the end of the week
I shall have finished with the City forever. I am not going to make any
accusation, but in the clearing of my own name I shall not give any heed to
others. Amongst the 'others' I need not say I am alluding to you."</p>
<p>"And there I am kicked downstairs," Mayfield said bitterly.</p>
<p>"If you like to put it so. I could speak a little more freely if you were
not my guest at the present moment. But you quite understand me."</p>
<p>"Your patience will not be unduly taxed," Mayfield said grimly. "If I am not
mistaken there is my car under the portico at this moment. But, before I go, I
have something to say. You will not forget your personal obligation to me."</p>
<p>"A matter of &pound;5,000. I assure you it had not escaped my memory. By the
end of the week&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quite so. By the end of the week. You wanted that money badly at the time.
I lent it you on the condition that you allowed me to take a judgment for the
debt. I brought a friendly action against you to recover the money, and you
allowed judgment to go by default. It is a little formula that is sometimes
gone through in the City, Miss Mary, to enable one or more fortunate creditors
to have the preference over the rest. When I signed judgment I was in a
position to levy execution as it is called. That is another technical
expression that means that I am in a position now to place men in possession
here and to hold everything till the debt and costs are paid in full. In vulgar
circles this is called 'having the bailiffs in.' It happens with such people as
struggling tradesmen and the like who cannot pay their rent. It is held to be a
terrible disgrace amongst the poor. Common men come in and take possession of
the drawing-room, where they smoke clay pipes and drink beer. Try to imagine a
dirty creature of this kind with his feet on your Louis Quinze furniture, Miss
Mary. The very idea causes you to look pale and ghastly. And yet such things
have happened, and history is always repeating itself."</p>
<p>The speaker paused and smiled, his words were horribly slow and grating.
Mary laid her hand on her heart as if some sharp fear thrilled her.</p>
<p>"Is&mdash;is it possible for you to do this thing?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Indeed it is," said Mayfield with the same hard smile. "I could do it
to-day&mdash;as soon as I reach town, in fact. Quite like a scene from a modern
melodrama, is it not? Well, good-bye, Sir George; goodbye, Miss Mary. I see my
luggage is on the car and my chauffeur is waiting. I will not intrude myself on
you any longer. When my slaves of the law, with their clay pipes and dirty
boots arrive, there will be no necessity to ask them to have dinner at the same
table as yourself. Good-bye."</p>
<p>With a sign of his hand, Mayfield motioned to his chauffeur. The great car
came along with a fuss and a clatter, and Mayfield sprang to the side of the
driver. He pulled off his hat with a gesture of mocking humility and the car
dashed away. Sir George sprang up, but too late. The car was disappearing now
in a cloud of dust down the drive. With a face white as death Mary turned to
her father.</p>
<p>"Is this thing true?" she asked hoarsely. "Are you still in that man's
power? Is it quite impossible for you to get the money to-day?"</p>
<p>"Quite," Sir George groaned. "I&mdash;I had forgotten that judgment. I
should have waited; I should not have shown my hand so soon. But he will never
do it; he was dismayed to find my position so strong; he merely meant to
frighten me."</p>
<p>"He will do it," Mary cried. "I saw it in his face, in his wicked eyes. A
disgrace like that would break my heart, father. What is to be done to avert
this awful calamity? No sacrifice could be too great. And I can think of
absolutely nothing!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;SKIN DEEP</h2>
<p>Mary spoke as one who is moved to the very core of her being. It was not
merely a painful and unpleasant incident that faced her, but something in the
nature of a great and overwhelming tragedy. The girl's pride was part of her
being. She accepted it naturally, as in the order of establishing things.
Usually she was brave enough. She would have encountered any physical danger
with coolness and courage, but the mere suggestion of this outrage frightened
her.</p>
<p>Well, she could look to her father for assistance. He had behaved with great
fortitude during the recent interview with Mayfield; indeed, it might be said
that he emerged from the combat victoriously. Doubtless, he could find some way
out. The old blood had asserted itself before, and it could do it again.</p>
<p>"Why are you so silent?" Mary asked. "Tell me what is to be done. A disgrace
like that would be horrible&mdash;after such contamination, Dashwood would
never be the same to me again. Father, you have found a way?"</p>
<p>But Sir George made no reply. The bland and easy dignity had vanished, the
suave smile with which he had greeted Mayfield was not to be seen. He had
suddenly become a poor feeble wreck of a man again, and he burst into senile
tears. They were real tears, for Mary could see them trickling down his face.
She trembled with an alarm and anger that she had never felt before.</p>
<p>For tears formed no part of her woman's armour; she left them to children
and the fretful mothers of the poor. In all the traditions of the house, there
was no mention of tears. Both men and women had met their misfortunes with hard
faces and dry eyed. It had been left to Mary to be ashamed of a male Dashwood.
Perhaps there was something in the bitter scorn of her face that caused Sir
George furtively to remove the tell-tale drops.</p>
<p>"I'm not myself," he whined. "I have had a deal of trouble and Mayfield is a
great scoundrel. I had to have that money hurriedly&mdash;a disastrous
speculation. If I had not been high up in the service of my country, it would
not have mattered so much. But my creditors were pressing, and Mayfield offered
to help me. Of course, he wanted what he called security. It seemed so natural
when he explained to me. And all the time he wanted to get me into his
power."</p>
<p>"Oh, why go over the same ground again?" Mary cried. "Something must be done
without delay. Those horrible men must not come here."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it was only a threat on Mayfield's part," Sir George said
feebly.</p>
<p>"It was nothing of the kind and you know it, father. There was deadly malice
in every word that he uttered. And before then you had got the better of him.
You acted like a true Dashwood&mdash;I was proud of you. And now you sit there,
and, oh, I cannot bring myself to say the hateful word. Why did you behave so
nobly a little while ago, and so cowardly now? You seemed to have found a way
out."</p>
<p>"I had," Sir George whispered. "Last night you left me in the depths of
despair. I could not sleep, I could think of nothing but what you told me about
Ralph Darnley. I wondered if perhaps he was secretly my enemy. Then it occurred
to me that he was looking for some papers in that old chest. I could not rest
till I was satisfied; I also searched the old chest. And what did I find? I
found the late Sir Ralph Dashwood's will and I found his unhappy son's deed
cutting off the entail. If no son of the second Ralph turns up within the next
six months, everything is mine. You can understand how the full force of that
discovery overwhelmed me. Here was a way out of all my difficulties. That is
why I was in a position to face Mayfield fearlessly this morning. Within a week
at the outside I could raise the money to be clear of him. I had quite
forgotten the smaller item. I should have remembered it, I ought to have been
smooth and smiling before Mayfield's face until I was ready to be clear of him
for ever. And now he can strike me a deadly blow before I am ready to meet it.
Of course the inconvenience&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Inconvenience! Can you speak of so disgraceful a thing by such a name?
Dearly as I love the old house, I would rather see it and all its treasures
burnt to the ground. I could put the match to it myself."</p>
<p>Mary's voice rang out with passionate anger. Her blue eyes blazed. There was
no trace of exaggeration in what she said, she would have been ready to carry
out her threat.</p>
<p>"It won't last long," Sir George muttered. "I'll go to London to-morrow and
take those papers with me. As soon as they have been verified, the bank will
advance me all I need. But business of this sort takes time. People are very
chary of parting with their money unless it is well secured. Probably by the
end of the week&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The end of the week! And the blow may fall to-night! We must have that
money now."</p>
<p>"Impossible, my dear child. I'm afraid you do not appreciate the situation.
When I came into the property I was heavily in debt. I had to pay off those
debts; also I had to keep up the house in a way that befitted the traditions of
the family. The consequence is that I am constantly overdrawn at my bank as far
as the people there allow it. They don't like it, because they feel that if
anything happened to me, or some son of young Ralph Dashwood came along, I
should find myself not in&mdash;er&mdash;a position to meet all my liabilities.
Therefore, to go to them to raise this money would be worse than useless. I am
afraid that we shall have to put up with the inconvenience till the end of the
week, when those papers I found will have been properly verified."</p>
<p>Mary restrained the passionate anger that flamed within her. It was a cruel
blow to find her father so wanting in courage when the critical moment came. He
was prepared to sit down and weep, when hourly the danger was drawing nearer.
Instinctively Mary's thoughts went out to Ralph Darnley. He would not have
taken the blow like this, though he had not the good fortune to call himself a
Dashwood. He would be up and doing. Perhaps it would be as well to consult him
and ask his advice. She felt ashamed of herself as the thought occurred to her.
And yet she had no other friend in the world. Despite her exalted position,
Mary was a very lonely girl.</p>
<p>What was the use of all her pride? This splendid isolation faded to ashes
now that she was face to face with the task before her. Evidently her father
meant to do nothing, he would submit tamely to the degradation and wait for it
to pass.</p>
<p>There were dead and gone Dashwoods smiling, or simpering, or frowning from
the walls&mdash;soldiers and statesmen, scholars, famous beauties, and not one
of them had ever seen the tainting of the family name. It was left to Sir
George to submit tamely to that. Mary could see that his eyes were still
wet.</p>
<p>"Something must be done," she said. "Are there no jewels that one could turn
into cash? Strange that I have never given a thought before to the family
jewels! But surely in a family like ours there must be historic diamonds and
the like. Did I not hear once from somebody that the Dashwood emeralds are
unique? I am told that it is no uncommon thing for great ladies to take these
jewels to men in London who advance money on them. I have listened to such
stories with incredulity&mdash;I begin to see now why things like this have to
be done. Let me have them and I will go to London this afternoon. My cheeks
flame with shame when I think of it; but I suppose there are harder tests of
one's endurance. Where are they, father?"</p>
<p>"They are not here," he said. "I believe there are some magnificent
heirlooms in the way of family gems, but they are not in my possession. You see
we are merely a collateral branch of the old tree, so we have nothing to do
with the jewels. At present I understand they are in the possession of the
dowager Lady Dashwood. They came to her as a matter of right on her marriage,
and I am told that she has retained them ever since. If her son had lived and
come to the title and married, then his wife would have taken the stones as a
matter of right, being the wife of the reigning head of the family. Whether or
not they would come to you on your marriage is another question. Anyway, you
would have the right of wearing them after the dowager dies. But this is a
matter about which I know really nothing. As you are aware, my dear, Lady
Dashwood does not like me. For some reason or another she has a violent
prejudice against me, and she never asks me to the dower house if she can help
it. Of course with you the thing is different&mdash;she brought you up and
regards you more or less as her own child. It is just possible that she may
tide us over the difficulty."</p>
<p>"Which means that you will go and ask her," Mary said eagerly.</p>
<p>"By no means, my dear," Sir George responded. "I could not stoop to ask a
favour of that kind from any woman, however pressing the necessity. It seems to
me to be more a question between one woman and another. Now from you, the
request would seem quite natural. If you care to undertake it&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Mary heard no more. She could not trust herself to reply. Slowly and
coldly she walked from the room, her hands locked convulsively together. Truly
the family pride was a shattered reed to lean on, a skin deep thing after all.
And the strong capable face of Ralph Darnley rose like a warm vision before
her.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE DOWAGER LADY
DASHWOOD</h2>
<p>The silent moody dinner was over at length; Slight was placing the dessert
on the shining mahogany. Mary rose presently and walked over to the open
window. Over the park the moon was gleaming like a silver shield against the
pallid sky; the deer moved like ghosts in the pearly dew. It was more sweet and
peaceful than ever, and yet Mary dwelt bitterly on the mockery of it all. What
an enviable mortal she appeared to be, and yet how little did she deserve that
envy. The hours had crept on and the thunderbolt had not yet fallen. Perhaps
the blow would be delayed till to-morrow, which was a soothing reflection, for
nothing had as yet been done, though Mary had made up her mind to invoke the
aid of Lady Dashwood. She had not been across to the dower house yet, for Lady
Dashwood had gone out on one of her rare visits to a neighbour, and at seven
o'clock had not returned. There would be plenty of time afterwards, and Mary
stood by the window, drinking in the full beauty of the night. She had made up
her mind to tell Lady Dashwood everything and throw herself upon the elder
woman's mercy. She turned to her father, who was gently complaining to Slight
of the quality of the claret he was pouring out.</p>
<p>"I am going to the dower house now," the girl said coldly. How could a man
be so trivial at such, a moment, she wondered. "I may be late, father."</p>
<p>Sir George murmured something in reply. He was still absorbed in the
contemplation of his glass. He had evidently forgotten the importance of Mary's
errand. The girl was very chill and her heart very cold and empty and lonely as
she passed down the old elm avenue and through a path leading by a great belt
of evergreens to the grounds of the dower house beyond. It was a Tudor mansion
a little older than the Hall itself, and it boasted some wonderful gates and a
rose garden famous throughout the county. The whole facade of the house was
covered with roses, too, and the night air was heavy with their fragrance. The
back of the house looked on a green forecourt, and a long conservatory led to a
set of cloisters, which made a deliciously cool spot in the hot weather. There
Mary usually found her aged relative, but she was in the drawing-room to-night.
She rose as the girl entered, a tall figure with a mass of white hair done up
in some old fashion that was not without its charm. Lady Dashwood's face was
white as her hair, and it bore the impress of some great and lasting trouble
that never would fade away on this side of the grave. Her eyes had the same
haunting care in them, the same suggestion of remorse. A keen observer might
have been justified in regarding Lady Dashwood as a woman who was being weighed
down with the burden of a terrible secret.</p>
<p>But her smile was sincere enough as Mary came forward; her slim hands shook
as she laid them on the girl's shoulders and kissed her. Then she seemed to
discern that something was wrong, for she sighed as she looked into Mary's
face.</p>
<p>"Sit down, dearest," she said tenderly. "It is very good of you to come and
see me so late. But there is something the matter, Mary. I have not known and
loved you all these years without being able to read that transparent mind of
yours. What is it dear? You know that I will do anything in the wide world to
save you from unhappiness."</p>
<p>"Dearest of foster mothers, I know it," Mary whispered. She blinked away the
rare tears that would rise to her eyes. "It is selfish of me to come and worry
you at this time of night, but there is no help for it. We are in great
distress."</p>
<p>"Does that mean your father as well as yourself, or rather that you are
worrying about him? What has he been doing now to cause you all this anxiety?
Something to do with those speculations over which I have helped him more than
once in the past."</p>
<p>"Have you?" Mary asked with a startled blush. "He never told me. He wrote to
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"More than once, my dear. As heir presumptive to the estate, I suppose he
thought he had a right to do so. But I am afraid that I can't help him
again&mdash;at least, not just at present. But then I don't suppose it is so
very serious."</p>
<p>"It is disgrace," Mary said in a low voice. "It means the intrusion of
strangers, men sent down to take what is called possession till the debt is
paid. It is a matter of &pound;5,000, and it must be obtained at
once&mdash;before mid-day to-morrow. Perhaps I had better tell you all about
it, but it would break my heart to see this disgrace fall on Dashwood. Dearest
tell me that you will find me the money or the means to get it!"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood made no reply for a moment. A still more ashen pallor crept
over her white face. She placed her hand to her heart as if to still some
poignant pain there, her rings shimmered and trembled in the lamplight.</p>
<p>"Tell me everything," she said huskily. "My punishment is coming, my sin is
finding me out at last."</p>
<p>"Your sin?" Mary cried, "If ever there was a good woman in the world, you
are one. I hate to hear you speak like that, my more than mother. Surely you
must know how good and pure your life has always been. And you talk like this!
If there is any mystery here, any secret that lies like a shadow over our
house&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Was ever a great family without its trouble?" Lady Dashwood asked. "You
must not take my foolish words quite so seriously, child. Perhaps by brooding
over them, one is apt to magnify troubles. So your father has discovered this
will and the deed by which my unhappy boy cut himself off from his inheritance.
Strange that the papers should be found just now."</p>
<p>"Why?" Mary asked. "Why just now? Did you know of their existence?"</p>
<p>But Lady Dashwood made no reply. She seemed to be lost in a sea of troubled
thoughts. Mary did not repeat the question. After all, it mattered very little
either way. Lady Dashwood came to herself with a start.</p>
<p>"But we have the present to think of," she said. "Your father will be able
to do as he likes now, therefore the trouble caused by this hostile creditor is
all the more to be deplored. He is some business man, I presume?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Mary explained. "By birth a gentleman. His name is Horace
Mayfield."</p>
<p>A startled cry came from Lady Dashwood's lips, the grey pallor was on her
face again.</p>
<p>"Do you happen to know the man?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I know him and his family. A bad man, a hateful man. Never mention
his name to me again. Mary, he must be got rid of at all costs. I have no great
head for these things, but I see the necessity of getting out of the hands of
Horace Mayfield. As you say, in a week's time it would not matter. As it is the
thing is urgent. Is it so utterly impossible to find this money?"</p>
<p>"It is out of the question for us," Mary said haltingly. Her face was
burning now that she was coming to the pith of her errand. "My father could not
place his hand on a fifth part of the sum. I racked my brains to find the way
out. Then it occurred to me that there were certain people who lent money on
the security of jewels and valuable plate, and things like that. I had never
heard our family jewels mentioned, but I felt quite sure that they existed. My
father told me that they were in your possession, that they belong to you so
long as I remain single. Dear mother, do you see what I mean? Do not put me to
the pain of having to speak more plainly. And it is only for so short a time!
By the end of the week the stones will be in your hands again. I could go up to
London in the morning and take the jewels to one of the big dealers who do
business of this kind...The disgrace would be averted. I hate to come here
with a proposal like this, but I can think of no other way. You are not going
to refuse me this great favour?"</p>
<p>"You want me...to lend you...my jewels?" Lady Dashwood gasped. There
was no trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She looked strangely white
and drawn, as if suddenly, years had been added to her life. "How do you know I
have any?"</p>
<p>"I asked my father. No, he did not suggest it. He told me that our family
collection of stones was a famous one; he said that everything was in your
possession. Then in shame and agony of spirit I dragged myself here to ask you
to do this thing. My own proper pride held me back, my family pride urged me
on."</p>
<p>"The curse of the race," Lady Dashwood cried. "The besetting sin of the
family will ruin us all yet. Heavens! the mischief that it has brought about
already. It made my wedded life a long intolerable bondage, rendering me old
before my time. It was responsible for the great sin which caused my son to
leave home for ever. And yet I fed you on the family pride, I held it before
you day by day until you have grown so cold and hard that I alone know of the
kind and generous heart that beats within you...But enough of this. You want
me to lend you some of my jewels. If I tell you I have none, what then?"</p>
<p>"My father told me that they were in your possession, Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"My child, you must not speak to me in that tone. It hurts me dreadfully.
Suppose the stones are gone, suppose that I have parted with them one by one to
preserve a fearful family secret! Suppose that I parted with the last diamond
yesterday! What would you say if I told you that?"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood had suddenly lost her reason. Mary could see no other
explanation for this extraordinary speech. And yet the speaker looked guilty
enough, there was a shamed flush on her withered cheeks. She rose from her seat
and moved to the door.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," she said. "I may find a way yet. But my sin is going to
find me out and my sacrifice shall be all in vain."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;LADY DASHWOOD SEES A
GHOST</h2>
<p>With faltering hesitation Lady Dashwood made her way into the dark hall
beyond the drawing-room. She bore little resemblance to the grand dame that her
friends knew. In spite of her silks, her laces and her flashing rings, she
looked like the ordinary woman who is suffering from the burden of a great
affliction. There were tears in her eyes as she walked along. The house was
strangely silent; no servants were to be seen anywhere as Lady Dashwood reached
a door leading to the green forecourt with the cloisters beyond. She stepped
out into the moonlight slowly, she passed across the garden under the brown
stone archway that led to the cloisters.</p>
<p>There she paused and looked about her furtively. There was nothing to be
seen but the shadows made by the moonlight. Like a thief in the night Lady
Dashwood crept along till she came at length to the end of the cloisters, where
there was a stairway leading to some dilapidated apartment overhead. Once again
there was a pause, and after that the aged lady began to climb the stairs. At
the same time there came the unmistakable sound of voices overhead.</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood started and almost lost her balance. The sound was so
unexpected, so utterly unlooked for. The voices were quite clear and distinct,
too, on the still air. Lady Dashwood had no desire to play the eavesdropper,
but it was impossible not to hear everything. The one voice was low and
pleasant, and yet clear and commanding.</p>
<p>"I tell you it is impossible," the pleasant voice said. "You must allow me
to conduct this business in my own way. I have already given you my word that
everything will come out right in the long run. There is still six months of
the time to expire, remember, so that you need do no violence to your
conscience."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you have not taken Lady Dashwood into your calculations, sir," the
other voice said.</p>
<p>"Indeed I have, my good fellow. I have forgotten nothing. Everything has
been most carefully mapped out. As Lady Dashwood is more or less of a recluse,
there is nothing to be feared from her. It will be a very easy matter to keep
out of her way."</p>
<p>The listener fell back, clutching at her heart wildly. She was compelled to
lean against the brown walls of the cloisters for support.</p>
<p>"I am dreaming," she murmured. "I shall awake presently and find myself in
bed. I am getting old and fanciful, and my mind is playing me strange tricks.
The owner of that voice has been dead for many years; it is a mere chance
resemblance. And yet it is as real as if I had gone back over the wasted years.
Is it possible&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker paused. It seemed to her that the two men overhead were coming
down and she had no mind to be caught listening. She turned away swiftly, her
slim ankle in its satin slipper gave a turn and a cry of pain escaped her. A
moment later and Slight was by her side, looking at her with mingled sympathy
and suspicion.</p>
<p>"Your ladyship has hurt yourself," he said. "Permit me to take you back to
the house. What are you doing here at this time in the evening?"</p>
<p>There was something almost masterful in the tone of the question. In spite
of the pain that she was suffering, Lady Dashwood turned a cold displeased eye
on the speaker.</p>
<p>"You sometimes forget yourself, Slight," she said. "It is a failing of old
and privileged servants. Your place is over at the Hall. What are you doing
here? You were ever a man to do strange things in a strange way. Have you some
secret here?"</p>
<p>"We have had many secrets together, my lady, and we may take most of them to
the grave with us," said Slight coolly. "I have been too long a friend of the
family to be treated like this. And your ladyship must just come back to the
house at once. You are in pain."</p>
<p>"Pain or not, I am not going back yet, Slight. I came here for something
that I had left in one of the cloister chambers, and I heard your voice. I
should have thought little of that, for you are permitted to come and go as you
like. But you were not alone, you had a companion with you. And I heard his
voice, too, Slight."</p>
<p>The withered old servant looked slightly confused. Then his dry face grew
hard and dogged.</p>
<p>"I am not going to deny it, my lady," he said. "A&mdash;friend of mine,
who&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is a gentleman. No mistake about that, Slight. And the voice was so like
that of my poor dead boy that I almost died of the sound of it. What does it
mean, Slight; who are you hiding up there? I am going to see."</p>
<p>"Indeed, your ladyship is not going to do anything of the kind," said Slight
hastily. "Besides, my friend has gone. There is another way from the cloister
chamber, remember. And your ladyship has just got to come back to the
house."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood sighed impatiently. Slight had been her own servant for nearly
forty years, and she knew the dogged obstinacy of the man. She knew his
sterling honesty, too, and how faithful he could be to a trust.</p>
<p>"Very well," she said. "If there is anything to tell me, you will tell it in
your own way. But that voice startled me&mdash;it was like a voice from the
grave. It was as if my boy had come back to me once more. Slight, if you are
deceiving me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm not deceiving anybody," Slight said in an aggrieved voice. "I leave
that to my betters. If your ladyship will lean on my arm, I will try to ease
your foot as much as possible. The shortest way is to cut across the
grass."</p>
<p>It was rather a slow process, for Lady Dashwood's foot was getting painful.
She came at length to the great stone doorway leading from the forecourt into
the house; she looked back over her shoulder, and as she did so she grew almost
rigid.</p>
<p>"Look!" she whispered. "What did I tell you? Don't you see it,
Slight&mdash;the figure standing over there by the laurels in the moonlight?
See, the rays on his face. Don't tell me that my eyes deceive me, Slight. It is
my boy come back again."</p>
<p>Slight muttered something under his breath. In reality he was objurgating
Ralph Darnley for his careless imprudence in standing there with his face
turned to the dower house. Yet the old man's frame never moved a muscle.</p>
<p>"What does your ladyship mean?" he asked. "I can see nothing."</p>
<p>"That is because you are not looking in the right direction, Slight. Over
there by the laurels. Do you dare to tell me that a man is not standing there?
It is my son Ralph come back from the grave! The fine figure, the gracious open
face, the determined eyes. Has time stood still with him that he looks so
young? And yet it is forty years since...Ralph, Ralph, it is your mother who
calls to you."</p>
<p>The words rang out with startling stillness in the great cloister. The young
man standing there started and turned round. He had been absolutely lost in a
deep study, contemplating the old house. He came tumbling down to earth again,
and became conscious of a white-haired, richly-dressed old lady who was holding
out a pair of arms in his direction. He could see the pleading, loving look on
her face, he noticed the menace and anger in Slight's eyes. Without further ado
Ralph stepped back into the bushes, his feet making no sound on the mossy turf.
It was like the slow diminishing of a dream.</p>
<p>"He has gone," Lady Dashwood cried. "I have frightened him by my notice. Did
you not see him, Slight? Did you not observe the extraordinary likeness?"</p>
<p>"I saw nothing but a young man who was trespassing," Slight said evasively.
"Your ladyship is full of fancies to-night. You will laugh at yourself in the
morning."</p>
<p>Once more Lady Dashwood sighed impatiently. She managed to drag herself back
to the drawing-room without the aid of Slight. She dropped into a chair white
and quivering, whilst Mary regarded her with eyes filled with deep concern.</p>
<p>"Something has happened to you," she said. "What is it? Can I do
anything?"</p>
<p>"Nobody can do anything," Lady Dashwood whispered. "Mary, I have seen a
ghost. I not only saw the ghost, but I heard the vision speak. And they wanted
to persuade me that it was an old woman's foolish fancy...I meant to have
done something for you to-night, but I forget what it is and where I put it. I
can think of nothing but my ghost. And I want to be alone, my dear, you cannot
think how much I want to be alone! Ring for my maid now and go. Don't think me
unkind, my child. Come back in the morning, and I will try to help you in the
way you need. Kiss me and say good-night."</p>
<p>Mary bent down obediently and kissed the faded, unsteady lips. Her errand
had been more or less of a failure, but she could not pursue the subject now.
She could only ring the bell and depart as she had come. To press the matter
nearest her heart would have been wanting in tact and delicacy. Very
sorrowfully Mary took her way across the park in the direction of the Hall. She
would come back and see Lady Dashwood after breakfast, and then if she could
get what she required, she would go to London at once and get matters settled
by the family solicitor. She might be an hour or two too late, but she had to
risk that.</p>
<p>The drawing-room windows were open; on the terrace in front Sir George was
passing up and down with a distracted air. Mary could see that his tie was
ruffled and that his hair had been stirred as if by a high wind. He paused as
the girl spoke to him.</p>
<p>"What is wrong?" she asked. "Has anything happened?"</p>
<p>"The very worst," Sir George groaned. "They came soon after you had gone...three
of them. One in the servants' hall, one upstairs, and one in there, the
drawing-room. A foul man with a foul pipe. Look and see the creature for
yourself!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;DESECRATION</h2>
<p>A feeling of almost physical sickness held Mary for the moment. She had
dreaded this thing, and at the same time she had hoped against it&mdash;it had
seemed almost impossible that such a calamity could happen to Dashwood Hall.
Mary would have scoffed the idea that she regarded ordinary humanity as
different clay to herself, but it was so all the same. It did not seem right
that one in her station of life should be called upon to suffer an indignity
like this.</p>
<p>And yet here it was, blatant and hideous, and so transparently vulgar! Mary
knew the full significance of the disaster; she had seen something of it, two
years before, in the house of one of the estate farmers who had fallen into the
hands of a money-lender. She had seen the mother of the family bowed and
distracted, whilst a gin-soddened wretch sat in a priceless oak chair and
puffed some dreadful tobacco. And the man had been quite insolent when Mary had
spoken to him.</p>
<p>That was bad enough, but to have the same thing at Dashwood was a thousand
times worse. It seemed to Mary that she could catch the reek of that vile
tobacco now. But something had to be done; it was useless to stand there
idle.</p>
<p>"Have you spoken to the people?" Mary asked. "The servants&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Are all in bed except old Slight," Sir George whined. "Slight managed that.
The other servants don't know anything for the present."</p>
<p>"Well, that is something gained. I have been to see Lady Dashwood. It was
the most shameful moment of my life, but I managed to ask for the jewels. No, I
did not get them&mdash;I don't believe that Lady Dashwood has them. I believe
that she has some secret trouble of her own; I begin to believe that there is
something terribly wrong with our family. There is no hope from Lady
Dashwood."</p>
<p>Sir George whined in a feeble kind of way. Mary's heart overflowed with
bitter contempt. This was the head of the family, the man to be relied upon to
uphold the traditions of a long line of glorious ancestors! The girl steeled
herself to face the inevitable; she knew now that she would have to rely solely
on her own exertions. She passed through the open window into the drawing-room,
which would never be quite the same to her again. Nothing appeared to be
altered; the soft shaded lamps were here, the mellow subdued light playing on
old furniture and pictures, and the flowers artistically arranged in their
priceless vases. Surely sorrow and shame and humiliation would not touch the
picture with chill fingers!</p>
<p>There he was, lounging back on a Chippendale couch, with his muddy boots on
a hassock of Gobelin tapestry, his sullen face half-ashamed and half-defiant.
His profession would have been apparent to anyone who had ever met one of the
tribe before. Those men were of a race apart, idlers and loafers, who can face
sorrow and suffering and the breaking up of homes without a spark of human
feeling. The man looked up at Mary's pale haughty face, with a certain dumb
admiration in his bleared eye.</p>
<p>"Who are you, and what are you doing here?" Mary demanded. "Tell me
that."</p>
<p>"It's all right," the object said, without removing his pipe. "There's the
document on that little marble table. Suit of Mayfield and Co., &pound;5,193
17s. 4d., debt and costs. If you pay within seven days, all right; if you don't
then the auctioneer comes in. No use making a fuss about it. Pay us and we go,
don't pay us and we stay. Treat us well, and we'll treat you well. It isn't the
first time I've been in swell houses like this."</p>
<p>The man was so coolly, unconsciously insolent that Mary could make no reply
for a moment. It seemed incredible that she, who had always had the reverence
of every man and boy in the village, could be treated like this. Nothing seemed
to pierce the creature's dull hide.</p>
<p>"But you can't stay here," she said. "That is impossible. I suppose the idea
is to see that nothing is taken away. Nearly all the furniture belongs to the
family; most of the things are what are called heirlooms. We could not dispose
of them if we wanted to. We could make you all comfortable in one of the empty
lodges."</p>
<p>"Won't do," the man on the sofa said huskily. "Had that game tried on me
lots of times. I sit up here all night, whilst my mates get a rest. We take it
turn and turn about. Better keep your breath to cool your porridge. You can go
to bed now without any fear of burglars. I'll see that nothing goes away from
here."</p>
<p>Mary turned away, sore and helpless and sick at heart. She, who despised
tears so heartily in others, felt like bursting into hysterical weeping now.
The humiliation was almost more than she could bear. She would have welcomed
any calamity that was likely to overwhelm the old house and lay it in grey
ashes at her feet. Fiercely, angrily, she grasped her father by the arm and led
him from the room. Sir George trotted along feebly, muttering in a small voice.
He was as useless as a woman in a storm at sea. He sat down in the library with
his hands folded in his lap, and looked anxiously for any suggestion from
Mary.</p>
<p>"Is there nothing you can do?" she demanded impatiently. Could this feeble,
white-faced creature be the same jaunty, debonnaire figure that had been so
popular in the Paris salons? Mary asked herself. "Is there no way out of the
difficulty?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I am afraid not," Sir George stammered. "I am so dazed and confused
that I can think of nothing. Most unfortunate that business about Lady Dashwood
and the diamonds. Wonder what she has done with them. Very selfish of her."</p>
<p>Mary suppressed a desire to scream. Ralph Darnley flashed into her mind
suddenly, and she wondered why. Anyway she could not ask him to help her, even
if he had the means to do so. She had repelled his advances more or less
scornfully, and one does not borrow money from a man in conditions like
that.</p>
<p>"Lady Dashwood is powerless to help us," she said with an effort. "Unless I
am greatly mistaken, she has a sorrow far deeper than ours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Impossible," Sir George said testily. "You are talking nonsense, my dear.
What blow could be heavier or harder to bear than ours? But I trust that we
shall meet it with proper dignity. Nothing can deprive us of our dignity."</p>
<p>Mary laughed aloud. The echo of her mirth came back mockingly in the silence
and almost frightened her. Heavens! was it possible that Sir George had no idea
of the pitiable figure he presented at that moment? He went on to suggest
fortitude and calmness. He had heard of the same thing happening in the castle
of a duke. Worse things had taken place in the chateaux of the aristocracy in
the French Revolution.</p>
<p>"Ay, but they knew how to live and die like gentlefolk," Mary said bitterly.
"I understand that you are going to sit down and tamely submit to this
thing?"</p>
<p>"My dearest child, how impetuous you are! There is nothing else to do. By
the end of the week I shall have more than enough for all my needs. Still I
think, I think that there is a way to get out of the difficulty, without
anybody being any the wiser. The remedy, however, lies in your hands. Of
course, it requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice on your part. I am bound
to confess that I could desire other channels for the amelioration of the
situation. Still, as I said before&mdash;"</p>
<p>The voice was cringing and fawning; there was something mean and furtive on
Sir George's face as he spoke his polished periods. A certain sickness of heart
gripped Mary; she was conscious of a sensation of absolute fear.</p>
<p>"Pray do not be diplomatic with me," she said. "I have seen so much of that
kind of thing in Paris. What are you concealing from me?"</p>
<p>"Your tone is not filial," Sir George complained. "I did not mean to tell
you; I was going to spare you the pain. I thought perhaps you would agree with
me that patience was the best line to take. But I see that you desire to strike
a decisive blow; at any cost you long to get those impossible creatures out of
the house. Our boats are not entirely burnt as you seem to imagine&mdash;one
slender plank of safety remains. Not to elaborate the thing too much, I may say
I have had a note from Mayfield. I should like you to read that note and
consider its inner meaning carefully. Mayfield has come down from London in his
car to-night, and is staying at his old fishing quarters at Swainson's farm. He
more or less apologizes for the course that he has taken, and reminds me that
friendship must not be mixed up with business. He does not allude to the way in
which I so flagrantly assaulted him, which strikes me as being generous on his
part&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But he has come here to gloat over our misfortune," Mary cried. "I see that
my instinct did not play me false when I estimated the man."</p>
<p>"There you go, there you go," Sir George said testily. "I gather from the
letter that Mayfield regrets his precipitate action. But, on the other hand, he
fears to lose his money. He wants a substantial security for it. He says in his
letter, which is an exceedingly gentlemanly one, that an amicable understanding
is quite easy. He suggests that if you like to send for him and discuss the
matter, he has no doubt that affairs may be arranged."</p>
<p>Mary started forward and laid a hand upon her heart. She was conscious of a
fierce pain there, as if the organ of her being had suddenly stopped its
beating. So this was the way out! She had only to smile, to raise one pink
finger, and the horrid miasma in the drawing-room would fade like some
unspeakable nightmare. Mary dropped into a chair shaking in every limb.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;A FIERCE TEMPTATION</h2>
<p>"And so that is what you mean!" Mary said slowly when at length she had
found sufficient breath to speak. "Stripped of empty phrases and diplomatic
trappings, I am to make a bargain with Horace Mayfield to save the honour and
reputation of our house."</p>
<p>"Let me point out to you that the thing can be done to-night," Sir George
whispered.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that. That is why Horace Mayfield is here. He has returned on
purpose. He has carefully calculated the place where the wound is likely to
hurt most. He knows the full extent of my pride, my idolatry for the old house
and the old name. And I am to make a bargain with him. I am to exchange myself
for freedom from the disgrace and humiliation. And that is a course that you
seriously suggest."</p>
<p>"I have not said so," Sir George muttered. He held his head down. He could
not meet the flashing blue scorn in his child's eyes. "These things happen
every day. Look at Lady Cynthia Greig. She married Newman the financier, who
started life goodness knows where. And she was supposed to be the proudest girl
in London."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know. There was some whisper of a terrible family scandal involving a
deal of money. And the last time I saw Cynthia, she looked like a beautiful
white statue. There was a fierce, hard gladness in her voice when she told me
that she was dying of consumption. Yet, so far as I know, Mr. Newman is an
honest man."</p>
<p>"Does not the same remark apply to Horace Mayfield?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not. I judge him from your own lips. You declared that he had
robbed you of a large sum of money, that he had deliberately worked it so that
it appeared as if he had been defrauded by a dishonest servant. And all this to
get me in his power. And you did not reply to that letter of Mr. Mayfield's
with the scorn that it deserved; you waited to hear what I had to say about
it."</p>
<p>Sir George protested mildly that he could do nothing else. But Mary was not
listening. She glanced at the familiar objects about her; she passed over to
the window and pulled up the blind. The moon was shining peacefully upon the
rose garden and tinting with silver glory the old gates beyond, as it had done
many times the last two hundred years. It all looked so sweet and graceful, so
refined and restful. No shadow of disgrace had ever rested on the house before,
no slander had ever made a target of the house of Dashwood. And now the tongues
of the whole county would be wagging. The price to pay was a terrible one, but
Mary did not hesitate. It never occurred to her that she was deliberately
estranging the very pride that she hugged so closely to her heart, that trouble
and misfortune could be borne with dignity and fortitude, that the gossip of
the idle mattered nothing. She reached out a hand to her father, and he
understood.</p>
<p>He took a note from his pocket and passed it over to the girl. It was only a
few lines that Mayfield had written, but there was no mistaking their meaning.
Mary felt that the words had been written for her alone; very clearly the issue
had been thrown into her hands. She crossed over to a table and began to write.
She was burning and trembling from head to foot; therefore she was surprised to
see that her handwriting had never been bolder and firmer. Without heading or
ending of any kind she wrote this message to Mayfield:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is getting late now, but it is not too late to talk business to a
business man. I am sending you this at once, so that you may get it a little
after eleven. If you will be so good as to come over to-night we may settle
matters at once."</p>
<p>She read the letter aloud and folded it calmly. Sir George nodded a sort of
shamefaced approval. Under his brows he had been watching Mary with the keenest
anxiety all the time. He knew that the girl's scruples were justified; that he
ought to have torn up Mayfield's letter and treat it with the contemptuous
silence that it deserved. But he merely smiled and nodded his head.</p>
<p>"I have done it," Mary said. "God knows the price that I am likely to pay
for my sacrifice, if the sacrifice is worthy of the occasion. Where is
Slight?"</p>
<p>Slight replied to the bell in person. His small red face had an angry flush;
his grey hair stood up all over his head like a clothes brush.</p>
<p>"Take this over to Swainson's farm," Mary said, "and wait for an answer. The
letter is for Mr. Mayfield, as you will see, Slight."</p>
<p>The old butler drew back a few paces. He regarded the letter as if it had
been something noisome to sting him; his face grew obstinate and dark and
almost murderous. Slight was a fanatic in his way, as Mary had noticed many
times.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, miss," he said doggedly, "but I respectfully decline to do
anything of the sort."</p>
<p>It was no time to argue with the old servant. And Slight was something more
than an ordinary butler; he was a friend of the family. Despite his blunt
refusal, his manner was as respectful as the most exacting could have wished.
Then he seemed to forget everything; his passion broke out and burst all
bonds.</p>
<p>"I've been here for more than forty years," he said. "I was bred and born on
the estate, and on the property I hope to die. I know the Dashwoods better than
they know themselves. It's all pride, pride, and nothing else matters. And it's
part of your pride, Miss Mary, to make terms with Mayfield, who is one of the
greatest rascals that ever drew breath. You may be surprised to hear me say
this, but it's true. That man has brought all this about. He's done it for his
own ends. He's waiting for you to own that he is master of the situation, and
he dictates his terms. And that he shall some day come here and lord it over us
is one of them. And it's your pride in the old house that is going to play into
his hands. Don't you do it, Miss Mary, don't you let that scoundrel come here.
If it happens&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence," Mary cried. "Slight, you are forgetting yourself."</p>
<p>"Maybe," Slight responded; "but I'm not forgetting you. And I won't take
that letter; not if I lost my place for it. Besides, I've got something else to
do. I've got to save you from yourself if possible."</p>
<p>Slight turned quickly and left the room. With an exclamation of annoyance,
Sir George crossed the lawn in the direction of the stables, with a view of
calling upon one of the helpers there. By the time he had succeeded, Mary was
ready with her letter. She looked very white and stern and proud as she stood
there in the moonlight. The fading light fell upon her neck and shoulders and
turned them to ivory. A fitting mistress for that grand old house, truly! She
was like one of Tennyson's cold and immaculate heroines, she had a sort of
fierce satisfaction in the knowledge that she came without a pang to the altar
of the family sacrifice. She was quite blind to her own insensate folly; she
would have been astonished to know that she was doing a wrong thing.</p>
<p>"Please take this note to Swainson's Farm for me, Walters," she said in her
sweetest manner. "It has been forgotten, and I am exceedingly sorry to give you
all this trouble. There is no occasion for you to wait for an answer."</p>
<p>Walters stammered something to the effect that it was a pleasure, and went
his way. In the distance, old Slight was stumping off across the park with
evident determination. A shade of annoyance crossed Sir George's face.</p>
<p>"We must get rid of that fellow," he said. "Really, the insolence of these
family retainers is past all bearing. You will see to this to-morrow,
Mary!"</p>
<p>Mary made no reply. She was not in the least angry with old Slight. She
understood the old man's feelings exactly; she knew his love and affection for
her.</p>
<p>Sir George's vapid attempts at conversation almost drove her mad. She wanted
to be alone to think. She passed into the drawing-room, muttering that she had
forgotten something. The lamps were still burning, the great bronze clock
chimed the hour of twelve.</p>
<p>The dreadful object on the satin couch had fallen asleep; his shock head was
thrown back, and from his lips came a long and regular snore. A poisonous scent
of foul tobacco filled the air. Surely no sacrifice would be too great to get
rid of this, Mary told herself. Mayfield would come along presently like some
malignant fairy; he would wave his wand, and this terrible invasion would
disappear as if it had never been at all.</p>
<p>But Mayfield would demand his price. Of that Mary had no doubt. For a long
time now the girl had known that he cared for her. He had made no effort to
disguise his feelings from the time that they had met in Paris two years ago,
when Mary was paying one of her visits to her father in the French capital. And
Mayfield was of the class of men who always get their own way. Sooner or later
Mary would be absolute mistress of Dashwood Hall, and it was no mean thing for
a man to have the chance of sharing such a home with his wife.</p>
<p>But the cost of it all; the sacrifice entailed! From the bottom of her heart
Mary loathed and despised the man who was plotting to make her his wife. She
knew him to be an utterly unscrupulous rascal, a fitting instrument to sway the
dishonour of the Dashwoods. A few days more of this unspeakable degradation and
Mayfield would be powerless. It was only a matter of making the neighbours
talk, of tittle-tattle at tea tables. And in a few days it would all be
forgotten. Other people had gone through the same humiliation and had come out
of it as if nothing had happened, but they were not Dashwoods...A long snore
came from the figure on the couch, and the man stirred uneasily.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;NOT QUITE TOO LATE</h2>
<p>Mary seemed to flame from head to foot. The momentary hesitation passed. No,
it was quite impossible to support this kind of thing for the best part of a
week; the thought of slanderous, wagging tongues was unendurable. At any cost
these creatures must be removed; even the servants must know nothing. So far as
Slight was concerned, he was absolutely to be trusted. Mary's mind was made up
for good and all.</p>
<p>Time was passing more quickly than she knew. As she stood there the clock
chimed the half-hour after midnight. A few minutes later and Mary heard her
father calling her. She understood him to say that Mayfield had arrived.</p>
<p>"Let him come here," the girl said independently. "I am quite ready."</p>
<p>Sir George shuffled off again in the direction of the library, where
Mayfield stood on the mat before the fireplace smoking a cigarette. There was
not the slightest suggestion of triumph about him, his face was calm and set.
He looked like some under-secretary who is about to read statistics to a House
of bored listeners. He had left his eye-glass behind him, so that the cynical
expression was absent.</p>
<p>"She's in the drawing-room," Sir George said. His manner was almost
cringing. "She&mdash;she prefers to discuss the matter with you alone. Perhaps
she thinks that you are more likely to listen to her than to
me&mdash;Mayfield."</p>
<p>"She's right there," Mayfield said almost brutally. "It is a matter between
ourselves. Sorry to put you to all this inconvenience, Dashwood, but there was
no other way of teaching the lesson. But you need not worry, half an hour will
see the whole matter settled, and even your servants will not be any the wiser.
I arranged the thing so that you should have the maximum of experience at the
minimum of inconvenience."</p>
<p>Sir George muttered something to the effect that his companion was very
thoughtful. There was not an atom of fight left in him, and he took no heed of
anything but his own personal comfort. The sooner Mayfield and Mary came to an
understanding and those cattle were cleared out of the house, the better. After
that Sir George could go to bed.</p>
<p>Without undue haste or eagerness, Mayfield passed into the drawing-room.
There was just a sardonic touch in his smile as he noticed the snoring hog on
the yellow satin lounge. He quite understood why a sight like that could touch
Mary's pride to the quick. Strange what queer pawns in the game of life a
clever man had to use at times! Mary was standing in the window-frame looking
out into the night. Everything seemed so still and peaceful; there was no
jarring note save the snore of the man in possession. Mayfield just touched
Mary on the arm and she turned. Her face flushed for an instant, and then it
became deadly pale again.</p>
<p>"Not in there," she said, "I cannot breathe in the house to-night. Do you
know what I should have done had this happened a century or two ago?"</p>
<p>Mayfield did not know, but he could give a pretty shrewd guess as he glanced
at the steely blue glitter in Mary's eyes. A certain pride of possession
thrilled him.</p>
<p>"I think you know," Mary went on. "I should have asked you here to discuss
the matter, to appeal to your better nature. And when I failed I should have
killed you first and myself afterwards. I could do it now if I had the weapon
to my hand."</p>
<p>Mayfield nodded. Far better to let Mary talk herself out, he told himself
cynically. She was not the sort of girl to yield without a struggle, she was no
frightened child to sue for terms. But in the letter she had written to
Mayfield she had sounded the note of surrender. He was here now as conqueror;
to see her walk out with all the honours of war. And surely she was worth all
the strategy if any woman was, the tall, fair beauty with those flashing eyes
and the skin of alabaster glistening in the rays of the moonlight. A prize
worth the winning, a daughter of the gods, if ever there was one.</p>
<p>"But these methods are out of date," Mary went on in the same bitter strain.
"I am told that they do things in different fashion to-day. You have done me
the honour to ask me to share your future life and I refused the offer."</p>
<p>"Why?" Mayfield asked. "My family is equally as good as your own."</p>
<p>"I know it. But noblesse oblige. You are what you are. And so you planned
and plotted for this; with diabolical cunning you saw where you could strike me
in a fatal spot. You came here to-night in a position to make your own
terms."</p>
<p>"Not quite," Mayfield said quietly. "There is another way for you. So far as
I understand your father is in a position to make his holding sure in a few
days. The house is large and the presence of a few guests, however undesirable,
makes little difference. It is, I admit, not a nice thing to have one of the
great unwashed smoking shag tobacco in the drawing-room, but it is only a
matter of days. The matter is in your hands for you to decide as you please. I
am not going to coerce you."</p>
<p>Mary laughed scornfully. The mirth sounded harshly against the silence of
the night; the man on the satin cushions stirred and made a gurgling noise in
his throat. Mary's mood suddenly changed and she shuddered. She was bitterly
conscious of her complete inability to do anything. She had expected Mayfield
to take his triumph openly; she was just beginning to understand what a strong
and dangerous foe he could be.</p>
<p>"You know how to gloss it," the girl said. "But there is going to be no
tacit ignoring of the real truth between you and me. You have brought this all
about to force my hand. You have calculated upon my pride of race, and my pride
of place. You know&mdash;nobody better&mdash;what suffering this is likely to
afford me. And you are in a position to remove the pain and the humiliation
with the stroke of a pen."</p>
<p>"Yes, I could do that," Mayfield said, speaking as if the suggestion threw
an entirely new light on the situation. "As a matter of fact the thing is
absurdly simple. I have only to send a telegram to my lawyer&mdash;one of your
servants could take it to Longtown and despatch it even at this late hour. My
lawyer could come down by the morning mail, getting here before six o'clock,
and send those fellows packing. Then the incident would be forgotten as one
forgets an unpleasant dream. You see, my resource is practically without a
limit. I can meet you in any way that you please."</p>
<p>"I have felt that for some time," said Mary coldly. "And in return for
this&mdash;kindness!"</p>
<p>"Surely there is no occasion for me to repeat my conditions! Besides,
'conditions' is not a pretty word to use in dealing with a lady. You will not
find your bonds irksome, you will not find in me a very exacting lover. It can
go out to the world that there is an engagement between us and in due course a
marriage will follow."</p>
<p>Mayfield spoke quietly enough, but his looks belied his tone. There was a
fierce volcano under that placid exterior, a strong, consuming passion, and a
will to lead Mary when once Mayfield had the power over her. Some instinct told
the girl this.</p>
<p>"It sounds prosaic enough," she said. "I suppose I must take you at your
word. And yet all the time I know perfectly well that I am doing myself a great
wrong in the eyes of God and man. I am not so strong as I think&mdash;I am not
strong enough to place my happiness before humiliation. I must have time to
think this over."</p>
<p>"Take as much time as you like. I will come again to-morrow, if you please.
You shall not throw it in my teeth afterwards that I have hurried you in any
way."</p>
<p>Mary sighed helplessly. The man was so strong and she was very, very weak.
She might have gained the full advantage of her pledged word and broken it
deliberately afterwards. It was the code of honour that Mayfield would have
possessed himself if he had seen any advantage by so doing. "And suppose I play
you false?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"You will never do that. I am not in the least afraid; I trust you
implicitly."</p>
<p>Mary turned back, baffled and defeated at every turn. The night seemed to
have grown suddenly chill, for she shivered as she made her way into the
drawing-room. It wanted but a feather in the scale now, to make up her mind for
good and all. Her eyes were drawn by magnetic attraction to the sprawling
figure on the cushions. The harsh note smote her like a thong.</p>
<p>"Look at him," Mayfield whispered, "does it not fill you with pain? And
there he is likely to remain till the sight of him drives you beyond endurance.
One word from you and the loathsome episode is past. Why do you not say the
word and finish it?"</p>
<p>The words seemed to sink into Mary's soul. Ralph Darnley flashed into her
mind, but she put his image resolutely aside. She pointed towards the door.</p>
<p>"You had better go," she said huskily, "go before I change my mind again.
You will find some telegram forms in the silver case on the library table. Need
I say any more than that? You can come back and show me what you have
written."</p>
<p>Mayfield bowed and departed without showing the faintest indication of his
victory. Mary staggered across to the window, with her hands to her dry, hot
head. A shadow seemed to rise from the gravel of the terrace, a shadow with a
white face framed in grey hair, the form of Lady Dashwood, limping a little,
but otherwise strong and resolute.</p>
<p>"You have been there long?" Mary asked. "You have been listening."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," Lady Dashwood said in a strange thrilling whisper, "listening,
and waiting for my chance. It is not too late yet, my child. Thank God, I am in
time. You must not do it, you must not heed, for the sacrifice would be all in
vain. Come, let me tell you what I mean. You are not used to dealing with
scoundrels&mdash;I am!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE UNFINISHED WORD</h2>
<p>Mary placed her hand to her head in utter bewilderment. The world seemed to
have changed in the last few hours. Hitherto, life at Dashwood had progressed
on oiled springs, calm and peaceful. There was the regular decently appointed
day, with its routine of refined duties, the dinner and the pleasant
contemplation of placid evenings. Mary had swung like a proud planet in the
still atmosphere. And now everything had passed into the wildest
topsy-turveydom.</p>
<p>Even Lady Dashwood had altered. The quiet, self-contained woman, whose very
restfulness had been one of her greatest charms! The sweet expression of her
face had vanished; she looked aged and anxious, almost fierce.</p>
<p>"What does it all mean?" Mary asked. "What has come to everything and
everybody? It seems almost impossible to believe that here at
Dashwood&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Trouble comes; but trouble comes everywhere. It enters the palace as easily
as the cottage, my child. And my fault, all of it. But come outside and talk to
me. Mary, you must have nothing to do with that man!"</p>
<p>"But how do you know?" Mary asked. "I&mdash;I am not yet certain myself. Who
could have told you anything?"</p>
<p>"But you are certain, child. You had made up your mind. The misery of your
face tells me so. And you sent a note to that man. Would you have done so
unless you had made up your mind to surrender?"</p>
<p>Mary looked down, and the red of shame flamed into her face. Come what
would, she could not turn to either side and escape humiliation.</p>
<p>"Slight told me," Lady Dashwood went on. "He came to me at once. My dear,
you must not be angry with old Slight. He worships the very ground you walk on;
he would lay down his life for you. And he knows everything; I shrewdly suspect
that he knows even more than I do. Slight is something more than a servant, he
is a valued friend of the family. And he came to me as I have said. He tells me
that Horace Mayfield has got his wicked fingers in here; that he has plotted to
make you his wife. That must not be, Mary, that must never take place. Surely
you can defy that man, can order him out of the house."</p>
<p>"I could," Mary said slowly, "I am not afraid of him. As yet I have not
pledged my word. Still, I am quite helpless. Look into the drawing-room and see
for yourself...That is what we have to put up with, three of them for the
best part of a week. By eight o'clock to-morrow morning the servants will know
everything; before the day is out we will be the talk of the county. I could
not show my face after that. The degradation would make me old before my time.
It is not as if I cared nothing for Dashwood, I love every stick and stone of
it, the place is part of my being. It was your house for nearly forty years.
Can't you understand my feelings?"</p>
<p>"I ought to," Lady Dashwood said bitterly. "It was I who first fostered
those feelings. I tended them; day and night I watered them and fed them till
they grew like a plant. With the lesson of the past before my eyes, I
encouraged your pride. And now it is the master passion of your life.
Everything has to be sacrificed to the old name and the old place. As for me, I
should not hesitate for a single moment."</p>
<p>"And never know the feeling of happiness again!" Mary cried.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear! happiness and I parted years ago. The old never expect
happiness; there are too many ghosts, too many gaps, and too many memories.
Peace is the greatest possession that one can expect at my time of life. And if
you do this vile thing, then I shall have to go down to the grave without it. I
am a wicked old woman; I am suffering now because I dare not tell the truth;
but rather than this wrong shall be done, I will speak, though I made a
death-bedside promise not to do so. Suppose I told you that you have less right
at Dashwood than I have!"</p>
<p>The last words came with a fierce whisper that struck a cold chill to Mary's
heart. Had Lady Dashwood suddenly lost her reason? But that white quivering
face had no dull insanity upon it; the dark eyes were full of horror but not of
madness.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I cannot tell you. I was sorry to say as much. Do you suppose that
Horace Mayfield loves you in the ordinary sense of the word?"</p>
<p>"I believe he does, if that has anything to do with the question."</p>
<p>"Dear child, that man is incapable of any such feeling. Love is a sacred
thing. Horace Mayfield is a cold-blooded and designing scoundrel. Your beauty
may inflame him, but there is no love behind. He calculates that it will be no
bad thing to call this his home. He plays upon your sinful pride as a master
plays the violin. He knows that you would do anything, even to marrying him, to
keep the scandal away."</p>
<p>"It is the only way," Mary said; "Horace Mayfield is too strong for us. What
is that?"</p>
<p>Something stirred in the bushes close by, a crooning song was but half
audible.</p>
<p>"It is your old nurse, Patience," Lady Dashwood explained. "She was sitting
with me to-night when Slight came over hot-foot with the news. Patience has one
of her lucid moods to-night. And Patience knows everything. The secret is hers,
too."</p>
<p>"I am tired of this mystery," Mary said; "why is Patience Ray hiding
there?"</p>
<p>A thin, bent figure emerged from the bushes; a dark withered face in a frame
of thin grey hair looked out. It was an old woman, toothless and haggard, yet
the eyes were sharp and shrewd now. For some years past the aged creature had
been suffering from decay, but there were moments when her wit was as sharp and
shrewd as ever.</p>
<p>"I couldn't stay away, dearie," the thin piping voice said. "It was like a
mercy that God gave me back my mind to-night. The wicked old woman may do a lot
of good before she dies yet. Don't you do it, dearie. Tell him that the proper
owner is coming back to Dashwood, and that your face is your only dowry.
Because I've seen the heir, as I knew that I should do before I die."</p>
<p>"What is she talking about?" Mary asked in utter astonishment. "Patience,
explain yourself."</p>
<p>But the old woman shook her head and refused to say any more. She muttered
to herself something about disgrace and the house of Dashwood.</p>
<p>"Smoke the rats out!" she cried shrilly and suddenly, "smoke them out! It is
the only way to clear Dashwood of such vermin. Put the match to the faggot and
burn them out. That's what I would do if I had my way. And to think that it
should come to this after all these years. Mistress, mistress, what a couple of
wicked old women we are."</p>
<p>"We are that," Lady Dashwood said mournfully. She did not chide the wild
speaker's words as Mary had expected. "Our sin is going to find us out,
Patience. Mary, I implore you to do what I ask you. I implore you to spare me
the pain of a full confession. Send the man about his business and have none of
him."</p>
<p>There was passionate entreaty in Lady Dashwood's tone, so that Mary was
troubled in more ways than one. The heart pulled her one way, pride and reason
another. And behind it all was a haunting sense that something was terribly
wrong here. There was some dreadful meaning underlying the wild words of old
Patience. As Mary stood there, cold and dispassionate in the moonlight, Horace
Mayfield emerged with a telegram form in his hand.</p>
<p>"I have been some little time," he explained, "the forms were mislaid. But
what is the meaning of this, Miss Mary? Surely it is late for Lady Dashwood to
be abroad."</p>
<p>Mayfield spoke calmly enough, but his eyes looked troubled. He glanced from
one to the other of the group anxiously.</p>
<p>"I came to see Mary," Lady Dashwood said coldly. In some magical way she had
recovered her self-possession. She was cold and collected, a veritable grande
dame in the presence of an inferior. "I had received certain information as to
what has recently taken place here. It seems that Sir George Dashwood is under
obligations to you, and that as these obligations have not been satisfied, you
have put the law in motion. In the language of unfortunate people in a lower
walk of life, you have 'put the bailiffs in.' It probably occurred to you that
this would cause Miss Dashwood a deal of suffering!"</p>
<p>Mayfield bowed with exaggerated politeness.</p>
<p>"We have known each other a long time, Lady Dashwood," he said. "We have had
some business transactions together, and you have never been at any great pains
to conceal your opinion of me. Therefore, I should gain nothing by an endeavour
now to appear in a more favourable light in your eyes. To be candid, when I set
the law in motion, I was not blind to the fact that my action would cause Miss
Dashwood a certain anxiety."</p>
<p>"Shameless!" Lady Dashwood cried, "more shameless than I expected."</p>
<p>"Smoke them out!" came shrilly from the lips of the old woman, "Burn the
rats out! Put the firewood and the candle together and burn out the vermin!
Burn Horace Mayfield! Burn him and the other rascals in a pile together!"</p>
<p>Mayfield started, he seemed as if about to say something, then apparently he
changed his mind, and ignored the speaker altogether.</p>
<p>"As you please," he said, "I shall be glad to have your views on the
matter."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;BREATHING TIME</h2>
<p>"I had no intention of seeing you," Lady Dashwood said. "To think that you
are the son of my dearest friend! It is well that she died before she knew. I
came here to see Mary, because I knew exactly how you had played on her
feelings. For purposes of your own, you have been diving into the family
history. Many things you have discovered, but many things remain a secret to
this day. Clever as you are, you have no inkling of the shameful truth. If I
chose to speak now, I could disperse several of your pleasant dreams. I took an
oath by the bedside of a dying man to say nothing, and I have regretted my
promise ever since. A promise like that is a sacred thing; to break it is a
deadly sin. Yet there are some promises that God never intends one to keep.
Mine is one of them. So long as I alone suffer, it matters little. But when
others are to suffer for my silence, others whom I love more than I love
myself, then it is time to break the vow and let the world know everything. By
my silence I doom yonder beloved child to lifelong misery. If you cared for
her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pardon me," Mayfield interrupted, "that is what I am trying to prove. My
methods may not commend themselves to you, but I hold that everything is fair
in love and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hold," Lady Dashwood cried; "you pollute the word with your tongue. What
can you know of love in its better and higher sense? Would you be standing here
to-night if Mary were a pauper instead of heiress to Dashwood Hall?"</p>
<p>Mayfield had no reply for the moment. Clever man of the world as he was, the
question found him dumb. He could only fall back on the commonplace.</p>
<p>"Why put an impossible case?" he asked. "If it comes to that, why are you
here at all? Miss Mary and myself have come to an understanding&mdash;the
understanding will be complete as soon as I have dispatched this telegram. We
are going to stifle the voice of scandal between us. Where is the young footman
who was going to take the message to Longtown?"</p>
<p>"The message is not going to Longtown," Lady Dashwood whispered hoarsely. "I
can guess what that message means to my beloved child. Mary, fetch your father
here. The hour has come when God tells me that I may break my word and
speak."</p>
<p>The flimsy telegram form crumpled in Mayfield's grip. His face had turned
deadly white with baffled fury. He fought down the anger in his heart and
forced a smile to his lips.</p>
<p>"I am afraid we are all going too far," he said. "Let us wait till the
morning. Lady Dashwood gives me no credit for magnanimity, I know. I am going
to prove that she wrongs me. After all, I have other resources. There are other
ways than this."</p>
<p>He tore up the telegram deliberately, and dropped the fragments on the
terrace. He must conciliate the old woman at any cost. It would not be
difficult, once she had gone, to get Mary to pledge her word. Deep down in his
heart, Mayfield was angrily wondering what secret Lady Dashwood had to
disclose. He could tell by the expression of her face that it was something
dramatic. He turned to Mary who was regarding the fragments of the telegram
with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I do not understand," she said, "I am so worn out and tired
that my brain seems incapable of grasping anything. I thought that that
telegram was going to be the means of removing those men and averting scandal.
If there is any other way of saving our house from such a calamity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That can be managed," Mayfield smiled, "nothing easier. Come with me a
moment and I will show you how it is done. Perhaps Lady Dashwood would also
like to see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I am quite satisfied for the present," Lady Dashwood said coldly.
"Thank God, I have been able to save the situation. I understand that you are
staying at Swainson's Farm for to-night. As the farm is on my way home, I shall
be glad of your company so far, as there is something that I wish to say to
you. I will wait for you at the bottom of the rose garden. Come along,
Patience."</p>
<p>The old bent woman muttered something and shook her head. She stood there
with her cunning, beady eyes fixed on the noble facade of the old house. There
broke from her a dry chuckle, as if her inmost thoughts were not
displeasing.</p>
<p>"You let me alone, my lady," she said. "It isn't often as my mind is as
clear and bright as it is tonight. And don't you worry about Miss Mary. I'm an
old woman, and I'm not good for much, but I can prevent that."</p>
<p>A haggard, shaking hand was pointed to the entrance of the drawing-room
where Mary's figure stood out under the soft light of the shaded lamps. Then
Patience turned away and plunged into the bushes. Again and again Lady Dashwood
called softly, but no answer came. It was peaceful and silent once more under
the light of the waning moon.</p>
<p>Mary had passed back into the drawing-room with Mayfield. The girl's head
was in a whirl. At the same time she could not forget Lady Dashwood's warning
and the strange hints she had dropped. Mayfield had been impressed also, or he
would not have been in such haste to tear up the telegram. Why was he afraid of
Lady Dashwood? How could he tell that there was something under the
surface?</p>
<p>"Perhaps you had better explain to me," the girl said. "The events of the
past hour have puzzled me. You went to the library to procure a telegram form.
You were going to send a message to your solicitor asking him to be here in the
morning with authority to remove those men. As they are your creatures, is it
not possible for you to get rid of them?"</p>
<p>"No," Mayfield explained, "these people represent the sheriff. My solicitor
is acting for me in the matter, and there would be certain formalities to go
through before I could take matters out of his hands. But there are ways of
keeping such matters quiet that you little dream of...Wake up."</p>
<p>The snoring creature on the yellow cushions turned over uneasily at a
vigorous application of Mayfield's foot and opened his eyes. He sat up
presently and demanded to know why he had been interfered with. There was no
civility in the man's manner; he evidently had no sympathy with misfortune.</p>
<p>"Speak in a proper manner," Mayfield said sternly. "I happen to know that
you will be out of this house in a few hours. There is nothing to grin about,
fellow. I suppose that you would not have the slightest objection to earning
&pound;5?"</p>
<p>"So long as it's all right, mister," the other growled, "but if you've got
some little game on and think that you are going to get me out of the
house&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind. Do I look like that kind of person?"</p>
<p>"Never can tell, mister. I've had the dodge tried on with me by them what
has handles to their names. Still, there is no objection to hearing what you've
got to say."</p>
<p>"That is very nice and obliging of you," Mayfield said grimly. "I am going
to make no effort to undermine your virtue. We do not want the servants to know
who you are or what you are doing. There's &pound;5 cash for you if you can
manage this. I'm told it is often done. What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, Mayfield played thoughtfully with some sovereigns. The big man
grinned.</p>
<p>"Now you are speaking fair," he said. "If people meet us all right and don't
regard us as convicts or bushrangers, why, we can meet other people. The three
of us have been in many a good house together. The last time we came down to go
over the place to give a proper estimate for electric light. You've only got to
look wise and potter about with a foot rule and a notebook, and there you are!
We can pretend to be measuring outside when the servants come down in the
morning, and I daresay Sir George can arrange for our food to be given us
somewhere handy. Bless your life, there's many a way of doing it, if you'll
give me the brass for the other two chaps and settle it at once."</p>
<p>Mayfield handed over a little pile of sovereigns and the man shuffled off in
the direction of the kitchen. Mayfield smiled at the success of his errand.</p>
<p>"There," he said; "I fancy that is all right. Only you must tell Sir George
exactly what has happened so that there is no confusion in the morning. Sir
George is thinking of having the electric light installed. The men are here to
take measurements. They will keep the joke to themselves. You ought to be very
much obliged to me."</p>
<p>But no protestation of gratitude came from Mary's lips. The light of a great
scorn was still in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Lies and prevarication and deceit," she said. "I seem to have found myself
in a very network of falsehood. The poorest girl on the estate is happier than
I am. It may be as you say, it may be that we shall escape the tongue of
scandal. But what are you going to do&mdash;how long is the deception to go
on?"</p>
<p>"That depends on yourself," Mayfield said coolly. "You can defy me if you
like, and take the consequences. But it shall not be said that I have treated
you unfairly. That is why I am giving you another night to think the matter
over. Now go and tell Sir George what has happened."</p>
<p>Mary turned on her heel and left the room without another word. There was a
sinister smile on Mayfield's lips as he watched the girl's drooping figure.</p>
<p>"The thing will pass as far as she is concerned," he muttered. "And now to
tackle Lady Dashwood and have matters out with her."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;A FLAMING SWORD</h2>
<p>Mary dragged herself as far as the library. Sir George was pacing up and
down the room, trying to soothe his nerves with a cigar.</p>
<p>"What a time you have been!" he said impatiently. "Why did you not return
before, knowing how anxious I should be? Mayfield came for a telegram form, so
I presume he has made matters right with you? Did Walters take it?"</p>
<p>"So far as I know, Walters has gone back to bed," Mary explained. "The
telegram was not sent, for reasons best known to Mr. Mayfield. There is no
occasion to be angry. It was no fault of mine&mdash;and has nothing to do with
me. Mr. Mayfield suggested that I should have another night to think it over.
It is not his code of honour&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Code of honour! The fellow hasn't got one! There is no trusting him! And
now everybody will know of this disgrace of ours."</p>
<p>"They won't. Mr. Mayfield has arranged all that. He seems to be clever at
this kind of thing. But perhaps I had better explain."</p>
<p>The anger and irritation died out of Sir George's face as he listened. He
expressed no feeling of disgust or abhorrence at the trick to be played upon
his household; on the contrary, a suppressed chuckle broke from him, a chuckle
instantly smothered as he noticed the white scorn on Mary's face.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, my dear. Of course, it is all very wrong, but in the
circumstances, what else could we do? I have not the slightest doubt that
Mayfield will make it all right to-morrow. And now we must go to bed."</p>
<p>Mary turned aside and went wearily in the direction of the hall. Usually,
she gave her father a warm and dutiful kiss before retiring, but she really
felt that she could not do so to-night. She had always freely expressed her
contempt for tears as a woman's weapon and as a solace in the hour of trouble.
But the tears rose to her eyes now as she thought of her father and the sorry
part he had played. It seemed almost incredible that the head of the house of
Dashwood could act so meanly.</p>
<p>And she herself! How much better was she behaving in the hour of trial? The
girl's face flamed as she thought of it. In her heart of hearts she knew that
the proper thing would have been to face the matter and see it out to the end.
Yet her pride had impelled her to make an appalling sacrifice to silence
tongues that did not matter in the least. What would Ralph Darnley have thought
of it all had he known? How strange that Ralph should come into Mary's mind
now, she told herself, strange that she should revert to him when danger
threatened.</p>
<p>"You need not wait on me to-night, Kelly," Mary told her maid. "It is so
very late and I want to be alone. Have you been asleep in my chair all this
time?"</p>
<p>The pretty little maid admitted that she had. She went her way presently and
Mary began slowly to undress. But tired as she was she felt that somehow sleep
to-night could not be for her. Usually, she dropped off directly her head
touched the pillow; the silence of the old house was very soothing. But not
to-night, for the place seemed full of weird noises, the noises that the
invalid hears when pain prevents slumber. Mary lay there, but she could not
sleep. It seemed to her that somebody was moving about the corridor. Surely she
heard a footstep, and something like the scratch of a match.</p>
<p>Mary rose and slipped on a dressing-gown. Candle in hand, she opened the
door. And, surely enough, she was not mistaken. A dark figure was there, a
figure that muttered and crooned, as if seeking something. Mary approached the
intruder.</p>
<p>"Patience!" she exclaimed, "what are you doing here? And how did you get
into the house? I thought that you had returned to the dower house with her
ladyship."</p>
<p>Patience looked up and smiled in a weak, watery kind of way. She was not in
the least afraid, and there was just a suggestion of slyness in her aged, faded
eyes.</p>
<p>"I forgot something, my dearie," she said. "There was something that I made
up my mind to do and then I forgot clean about it. It was one of my good
nights, and my head was as clear as yours. Her ladyship told me everything. But
she didn't tell you everything because she dared not. Ay, we are two sinful old
women for certain."</p>
<p>"Never mind about that," Mary said soothingly, "I daresay it will all come
right in the morning. But you should not have come here like this. You had
better lie down on the couch in my dressing-room and go to sleep."</p>
<p>"But there was something that I wanted to do," the old woman whined. "I
thought of a way of saving you, of saving everybody. And then it clean went out
of my head."</p>
<p>Patience wrung her hands and the tears stood in her faded eyes. She appeared
to be deeply distressed about something. She stopped suddenly, and stood alert
and listening.</p>
<p>"Did you hear that?" she demanded. "They are in the kitchen. All three of
them together! I saw them just now, but they did not see me. They were laughing
together, and one of them had gold, which he was dividing with the rest. And
they have come here to bring disgrace on this noble house. And there was I
standing close by with a way to get rid of them in my head...There was
something that I wanted, and I couldn't find it. So I came to look, and I
forget what it was. Such a beautiful plan, too, so very simple and yet perfect.
My dearie, can't you help me to think what it was? If you can only help me we
shall get rid of these men, and the trouble and disgrace will vanish, never to
return. It isn't often that I get a good idea in this poor head of mine, and to
forget it like that is cruel, cruel!"</p>
<p>Patience wept a little, and began to wring her hands again. Mary's old nurse
had been in this state now for some years, though there were times, for longer
or shorter periods, when she was in possession of all her faculties. She was
not in the least dangerous; as a privileged old servant she had been allowed to
wander from one house to the other at her pleasure. But Mary had never seen her
so wild and excited before, and the thing troubled her.</p>
<p>"What do you know of our trouble?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Her ladyship told me. It was something to do with some money that Sir
George owed to Mr. Mayfield, and which those men had come to get. And her
ladyship could not help you, for Mr. Vincent has made her sell all her jewels
already."</p>
<p>Mary fairly started. Was it possible that she was on the track of another
family trouble, some new and black disgrace of which she had hitherto known
nothing? It seemed hardly fair to take advantage of a weak-minded old woman in
this, and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who is this Mr. Vincent that you speak of?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"Mr. Vincent&mdash;that is all I can tell you. He is young and handsome, and
yet so wicked and unscrupulous. And it is to prevent him from speaking out that
my lady has sold all her jewels. They are not hers to sell, but they have been
disposed of all the same. I really do know who Mr. Vincent is, and why he has
such a hold over her ladyship, but something gets in the way of my brain and I
can't think what I ought to say. And I'm so tired."</p>
<p>The old woman suddenly dropped into a chair and began to whine like a child
that has walked too far. Mary was accustomed to these sudden changes and knew
how to humour them. She fairly lifted the old woman from her seat and led her
to the dressing-room. Obedient as a child now, Patience lay down and closed her
eyes. A moment later and she had fallen into a placid sleep. Mary regarded her
with eyes of envy.</p>
<p>"After all she is better off than I am," she murmured, "and her troubles are
nearly over. What a blessing it is to be able to sleep when you want to! And
here am I on the brink of a fresh and darker mystery than my own! I begin to
understand now why Lady Dashwood looks so haggard and worried. And what does
this Vincent know, who can blackmail my poor old second mother in this way! All
the family jewels, over &pound;30,000. Oh, how sad it is to be almost without a
friend in the world! And yet Ralph Darnley promised me&mdash;"</p>
<p>The colour rose to Mary's face as she pronounced Ralph's name. It was the
one reflection that sweetened her thoughts as she lay on her bed waiting for
the sleep that would not come. She turned from side to side; she could see by
the saffron gleam on the blind that the summer dawn was close at hand.</p>
<p>Then at last she fell off into a kind of fitful slumber that was a mass of
confused and hideous dreams. She was in some vague, indefinite kind of trouble,
tangled up with a scheme of Mayfield's, and across a yawning gulf Ralph Darnley
was holding out his hands to save her. And then it seemed to her that Ralph
kissed her, and that she did not in the least mind it. After that they drifted
apart again, and once more the baleful influence of Mayfield was uppermost.
They were falling together down a deep pit with flames at the bottom; the fumes
were so great that Mary could not breathe.</p>
<p>She woke up with a gasp and a cry, struggling for breath. The whole thing
had been so vivid that Mary could not realise for a moment that she was sitting
up in bed. Yet there she was, with the early morning sun shining through the
blinds, and still she held her hand to her throat and fought for the breath
that would not come.</p>
<p>Surely there must be something wrong here! Why was the room so insufferable,
where did that stifling air come from? Then a draught of air came from
somewhere, and the bedroom was almost instantly filled with a maze of thin
smoke and vapour. There was no longer room for doubt. With a quick cry Mary
sprang from her bed, for the Hall was on fire!</p>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;A GUARDIAN ANGEL</h2>
<p>There was no longer any question as to the house being on fire. Very rapidly
Mary proceeded to don her clothing; her idea afterwards was to alarm the house.
The girl was not conscious of any feeling of fear, though she was trembling
from head to foot. She had had but a poor night's rest, and the strain of the
previous day had tried her. And now as she huddled into her clothing, she was
conscious of a kind of relief, the feeling that if the house was burnt down a
way had been found out of her troubles.</p>
<p>There was an emotion almost of gladness in the thought. But the pride of
race and place came back, and Mary hastened to her task. Dashwood Hall must be
saved at any cost&mdash;the historic house must not be allowed to perish. There
were pictures and works of art there that had almost a national interest.</p>
<p>Mary flung the door open and strode boldly into the corridor, but she did
not gain a yard before she was driven back by a dense mass of suffocating
smoke. The corridor was filled with it, thick, black, and overpowering. It was
absolutely impossible to force a way through that blinding cloud. Mary screamed
at the top of her voice, but no reply came. Already her brain began to reel,
already her lungs almost ceased to work.</p>
<p>There was only one thing for it&mdash;to shut the door and seek for some
other exit.</p>
<p>Back in the bedroom the air was comparatively pure. The window looked on to
a green court with a high hedge of clipped yew trees beyond. It was one of the
quietest and most shady rooms in the house, and Mary had chosen it for that
very reason. In the winter she occupied another apartment. But its very
quietness frightened the girl now. As she looked out of the small diamond
casement in the great stone mullion, she realised that it would be impossible
for any grown figure to squeeze through. She might have taken the risk of
jumping down on to the grass, but the bars of the mullion window were too close
together to permit of the attempt. And already the draught from the open window
was drawing the smoke into the room.</p>
<p>Listening intently, Mary could hear the sound of shouts and the tramping of
feet; now, she caught the echo of horses' hoofs as mounted messengers galloped
down the drive. She shouted aloud, but nobody appeared to hear her. The thick
high hedge of yews seemed to smother her voice. It was dreadful to be caught in
a trap like that, but Mary resolved to meet her fate bravely.</p>
<p>Probably the volume of smoke would cause unconsciousness long before the
dreaded fire reached its victim. There would be no pain or suffering. It seemed
to Mary that she had heard people speak of such things before. Well, she would
die alone, and nobody would know how the end had come.</p>
<p>Not quite alone! Suddenly Mary remembered that old Patience was in the
dressing-room and looked towards the couch there.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes in astonishment. Patience was no longer there. Perhaps
she had not been able to sleep, probably she had aroused herself very early and
gone about her business. At any rate, she was not in the dressing-room, and
Mary felt glad of it. The horror of the situation was lessened by the absence
of the demented woman.</p>
<p>Greatly daring, Mary opened the window and screamed for help once more. She
could hear yells and calls, and presently the steady throb of what she knew to
be an engine. But all the time the smoke was growing thicker and denser in the
room. So far Mary could not hear the crackling of flames, she was not sensible
of the fact that the room was getting any warmer. There was always the hope
that the fire might be subdued before it got a good hold of the building. A
great deal of timber had gone to the building of Dashwood Hall, but the walls
were of the most solid masonry, and it was quite possible for the fire to burn
out a room or two without going any farther.</p>
<p>Something like an hour passed, an hour that seemed like eternity. The
shouting and the tramping and the thudding were still going on. Then came a
lull for the moment, and it seemed to Mary that somebody was calling her by
name, somebody inside the house. She waited a moment, thinking perhaps that it
was her excited fancy, but once more the call came, and this time from the
corridor.</p>
<p>Mary thrilled as she heard the voice. At last they had discovered her
absence. She opened the door and called in reply. The smoke was thick as ever,
but there was no sign of flame. Out of the dense whirling mass a figure emerged
and staggered breathlessly into the bedroom. It was the figure of a man with
his handkerchief pressed to his mouth. He gasped for breath and closed the door
behind him. His face was blackened and grimed with smoke, but Mary had no
difficulty in recognising Ralph Darnley.</p>
<p>"Again," she said unsteadily, "you are like a guardian angel to me. This is
the third time that you have come to save my life. Had they forgotten me?"</p>
<p>"It was all a misunderstanding," Ralph gasped. "In the confusion it was
assumed that everybody was out of the house. Somebody professed to have seen
you going off in the direction of the dower house. My landlord woke me up,
saying that the Hall was on fire. And Lady Dashwood sent a message to ask if
you were all right, and then we understood. It occurred to me that it would be
impossible for you to escape by way of the window, and whilst the rest were
discussing the best thing to be done, I made a dash for it. The house is full
of the most blinding, suffocating smoke, but I can see no flames anywhere."</p>
<p>"And so you took your life in your hands like this for me?" Mary faltered.
There was something almost of affection in the eyes which she turned on the
stalwart figure by her side. "I was actually thinking of you at the very moment
that you appeared. But how did you manage to find the way to this wing so
easily?"</p>
<p>"I suppose by instinct," Ralph said. The question seemed to confuse him.
"How brave and calm you are! But we are wasting time here. Mary, there is only
one way for it. We shall have to fight our way through that smoke. There is no
other chance. It will be quite a blindfold labour. But perhaps you could pick
your way&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In the dark, with my eyes shut," Mary cried. "If I am to die, then at least
I shall die in good company, with a brave, true man by my side. I shall not
perish alone."</p>
<p>"You will not perish at all," Ralph said between his teeth. "You are
reserved for a better and a sweeter fate than that, my darling. Heaven is going
to rescue us for one another, despite your pride and despite anything that
Mayfield may do. But these heroics are out of place in the face of the common
danger. You have water here and towels?"</p>
<p>"Plenty of both in the dressing-room," Mary said. "What do you want them
for?"</p>
<p>But Ralph made no reply. He had a stern task before him, and no time to
waste in words. He took a couple of the largest towels and dipped them in the
water jugs. Then he wrung out the moisture and wrapped the cold wet fabric
round Mary's head. After he had led her to the door, he did the same for
himself. Then he took Mary by the hand, and whispered that she was to lead the
way.</p>
<p>The task was no easy one, well as Mary knew every inch of the house. She
felt her way to the top of the stairs at length, but her head seemed like
bursting now. Still, the pressure of Ralph's hand gave her courage. With him by
her side, she felt like daring anything. As presently the air began to grow
cooler and sweeter, it seemed to Mary that she was conscious of the scent of
the roses.</p>
<p>Then the cloth was pulled from her face, and she felt the full delight of
her lungs again. A great crowd had gathered on the lawn, the people burst into
a torrent of cheers. It was all like a dream to Mary.</p>
<p>She saw that Ralph was standing by her side breathless and triumphant.</p>
<p>"Do not crowd us like that," he said. "Please let Miss Dashwood have as much
air as possible. Neither of us is the least hurt by the fire; indeed, so far as
I can see, this is no fire at all. Has anybody a conveyance that will take Miss
Dashwood as far as the dower house? It is only a little way, but
still&mdash;"</p>
<p>There were scores of people ready to comply with the request. Then the crowd
parted as if by a kind of instinct, and Lady Dashwood appeared. She was pale
and breathless, but not for one moment did she forget herself or her
position.</p>
<p>"My dear child," she said, "you must come with me at once. Fancy you being
in that house all the time and nobody any the wiser! And they tell me that a
gentleman who is a stranger here volunteered for your rescue in the bravest
possible manner. If he is here I should like to thank him warmly
for&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Ralph Darnley," Mary explained. "He is not a stranger, for we
met in Paris two years ago. Let me introduce Mr. Darnley to you."</p>
<p>Ralph bowed and moved towards the hand that Lady Dashwood held out to him.
There were gracious words on his lips.</p>
<p>"It is impossible to thank you," she said, "but if you will come as far as
the dower house with me, I dare say that I shall be able
to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words seemed to freeze as Lady Dashwood's glance travelled over Ralph's
face. Lady Dashwood took a step forward and would have fallen if Ralph had not
put out an arm and supported her. Then there was an awkward silence.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX&mdash;HALF TOLD</h2>
<p>The meeting was quite an unexpected one for Ralph. He had his own powerful
reason for not wishing to come in contact with Lady Dashwood, but the thing was
done now, and there was no help for it. Ralph was the first to recover his
self-possession. He saw that the colour was coming back to Lady Dashwood's
face, and that it was very far from her intentions to make a scene. That would
probably come later.</p>
<p>"There seems to be no conveyance here," Mary said. "And really it is not
worth while to make all this fuss about me. I am quite myself again and capable
of walking as far as the dower house with Lady Dashwood. Meanwhile, there is
other work to do."</p>
<p>The excitement of the moment had passed, and willing hands were back once
more at the task of putting out the flames. Of the little group of principal
actors in the scene, nobody was more calm or more collected now than Lady
Dashwood.</p>
<p>"Perhaps we had better walk," she said. "We can take the short cut through
the shrubbery. And I shall be very glad if Mr. Darnley will accompany us. I
presume, sir, that you have not had any breakfast?"</p>
<p>"I haven't," Ralph said. "Sir George has gone over to one of the farms for
his. If you will be so good as to give me a mouthful of something, I will come
back here and do my very utmost to save the old house. It would be a great pity
to lose it."</p>
<p>"Indeed I am glad to hear that you are so anxious about the place," Lady
Dashwood said with a significance that puzzled Mary, though it was by no means
lost on Ralph. "The Hall is one of the finest places of its kind in
England."</p>
<p>Ralph ate his breakfast in silence; Mary was silent too and pleaded a
headache. She had had no sleep, she said, and was in need of rest. She ate
little and drooped like a lily over her plate. When at length she rose, Ralph
rose also.</p>
<p>"Please don't go yet," said Lady Dashwood in a voice with a touch of command
in it. "I will just see that Mary is made comfortable, and then I should like
to have a word with you, sir. There are so many willing workers at the Hall
that one more or less will make no difference."</p>
<p>Ralph bowed. Lady Dashwood would be glad if he would go as far as the
drawing-room. He waited there till his hostess returned, proud and white, with
a stern expression in her eyes. She shut the door behind her and pointed to a
seat.</p>
<p>"Pray do not stand," she said. "We may be some little time. Did I not
understand my&mdash;Mary, to say that you are Mr. Ralph Darnley?"</p>
<p>"That is quite correct," Ralph said quietly. "Miss Mary made no
mistake."</p>
<p>"Possibly not. The mistake is on your side. I do not wish to seem in the
least curious or impertinent, but have you no other name?"</p>
<p>"For the present, none," said Ralph. "Will not your ladyship oblige me by
leaving matters just as they are for the moment? My happiness, the happiness of
everybody, depends upon a complete and absolute discretion. I did not desire to
see you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No! I gathered that when I saw your face a night or two ago in the
shrubbery. The moon was shining on your features, and it seemed to me that I
was face to face with a ghost. But let me show you something, Mr. Darnley. It
is a miniature of a man whom I have not seen for nearly forty years, the
picture of my son. He left home for reasons which I need not go into, I never
looked on his face again. I have never before shown the picture to anybody, but
I have my very good reasons for showing it to you. What do you think of
it?"</p>
<p>With trembling hands the old lady passed a miniature in a small gold frame
over to Ralph. He gazed at the picture long and intently, with a flush on his
face and something that was very like moisture in his eyes. He was silent for
so long that Lady Dashwood felt constrained to speak.</p>
<p>"Well?" she asked. "I will try to restrain the natural curiosity of my sex
and not ask too many questions. Did you ever see that face before?"</p>
<p>"You force me to reply," Ralph said slowly. "You have the advantage over me,
Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"Please do not call me Lady Dashwood. Oh, I am not going to try to force
your confidence; that will come to me in time. Only you have not yet replied to
my question. I asked you if ever you have seen that face before?"</p>
<p>"Many a time and oft," Ralph said. "Is it very like me?"</p>
<p>"Like you! It is a speaking likeness. When I came face to face with you
to-day, it required all the seventy years of my social training to keep me from
bursting into tears and throwing my arms about your neck. And nobody recognised
you! But I forget that forty years have elapsed since my boy was in the midst
of us. And now tell me, why do you persist in calling yourself Ralph
Darnley?"</p>
<p>"I have never been known by any other name," Ralph replied. "Perhaps the
time may come some day when I&mdash;but we need not discuss that. Please do not
think me churlish or wanting in courtesy to you, Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood shook her head mournfully. Something like tears stood in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"I have no right to ask anything," she said. "I forfeited my right years
ago. But, unless I am greatly mistaken, you could call me by a sweeter name
than Lady Dashwood. My dear boy, I do not wish to pry into your
secrets&mdash;you could not act in anything but a straightforward manner, I am
certain. Your face tells me that. Nearly forty years ago I lost a son like you.
How like he was to you I have proved by showing you that miniature. My son left
Dashwood Hall vowing that nobody should ever see his face again there, and he
kept his word. The blame was mine, and only mine, but I have been terribly
punished for my treachery and deceit."</p>
<p>"I can hardly believe you guilty of those things, Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I was. It was the cruellest wrong, and he found me out. From that
day to this I have known no happiness. Why do I talk like this to a stranger? I
think you can guess. When I saw your face in the cloister the other night it
seemed as if God had forgiven my sin and given my son back to me. Is that
so?"</p>
<p>"This is very painful," Ralph stammered. "Will you trust me and be
patient?"</p>
<p>"I can be patient. I have been patient for forty years. And your face speaks
for you. Go on."</p>
<p>"There is little more for me to say," Ralph resumed. "For the present I can
tell you nothing. If the son you speak of came back to-morrow not a soul would
recognise him but you."</p>
<p>"And old Slight," Lady Dashwood said meaningly. "Pray do not forget
him."</p>
<p>"And old Slight. Quite true. And I am the image of the Ralph Dashwood who
left his home nearly forty years ago. There were reasons, therefore, why I did
not desire to meet you, Lady Dashwood, till the time was ripe. But
circumstances were too strong for me; sooner or later it had been my hope
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I begin to understand," Lady Dashwood said as Ralph hesitated. "For the
present you desire to be just Ralph Darnley. But the deception cannot continue
for long."</p>
<p>"For long enough," Ralph smiled. "Let me confide in you to a certain extent.
Lady Dashwood. I am a sentimental man as my father was before me."</p>
<p>"I know he was," Lady Dashwood said absently. "If he had not been, my
punishment might have been less&mdash;but I am assuming too much. Please go
on."</p>
<p>"I am a lonely man. My mother died early, and my father and myself were
thrown a great deal together. We spent most of our time in California, where
the population is not great. You can understand how it was that I became so
retrospective. And when I came to hear of the mystery that my father had kept
till the end, I began to have dreams of my own. I began to see myself the
master of a lovely place, like Dashwood Hall, for instance...You see that
I am speaking from my heart to you now, and I know that you are going to
respect my confidence and sympathise with me."</p>
<p>"As long as you look at me with those eyes of&mdash;yours," Lady Dashwood
murmured. "We are going to be great friends, thank God. But please go on."</p>
<p>"Well, I had my dreams of the kind of wife who would make my home a Paradise
for me, and two years ago I met her in Paris. She was proud and reserved and
haughty, but all the same I knew that my instincts had not played me false. The
girl likes me&mdash;of that I am certain. It sounds egotistical, but I believe
that she loves me without knowing it. Had I told her of the fine old house and
the good old name, there would have been no obstacles in the way. But I gave
the curb to my inclinations, and my secret remained untold...For nearly
two years I did not see that girl, not till I came down here less than a week
ago. Can you guess who it is!"</p>
<p>"Mary," Lady Dashwood cried. "My dear, dear Mary! And she does not know, one
does not dream&mdash;indeed, how should she? You want her to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"To care for me, Ralph Darnley. Mary has a terrible curse, her family pride
comes before her duty, and even before her religion. It is the idol that she
has come to worship. Mind, I am by no means blind to the girl's virtues; I
should not love her as I do otherwise. But I want to break down that family
pride, I want to show Mary and prove to her that it is a mere nothing by the
side of love and duty and common humanity. That is why it is merely Ralph
Darnley who speaks to you to-day. When Mary owns her love for Ralph Darnley,
and holds that love better than her pride of race, then I can speak. It may be
that there is a hard lesson to be learned first, but I shall not shrink from
that."</p>
<p>"That is how your&mdash;my son used to speak," Lady Dashwood murmured. "So
gentle and firm, and yet so kind and considerate! You are going to make Mary
happy despite herself."</p>
<p>"That is my intention," Ralph went on. "Look how she is acting now. Sir
George has come within the grip of a scoundrel. I am alluding to Horace
Mayfield. He has schemed out all this trouble and disaster so as to get Mary in
his power. The girl's senseless pride has been Mayfield's strongest weapon. You
know all about those sheriff's men, of course. Rather than have a whisper of
the trouble spoken, Mary is ready to marry Horace Mayfield and condemn herself
to lifelong misery and humiliation. It seems almost incredible that a girl
should be so frozen into the ice of her family pride. But Mary is not going to
marry Horace Mayfield, she is destined for me. The lever to remove the stone
from the path is mine, and I shall know how to use it when the time comes.
Already I have so brought it about that Sir George can be free of Mayfield in
the course of a few days, but there is still Mary to deal with. I do not quite
see my way clearly with her, but fate may play into my hands and find me an
instrument which&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ralph paused hurriedly, for another man came noisily into the room. He was
rather like Ralph as regards figure and feature and trick of expression, but
his face was effeminate, and his very black eyes a little shifty and sinister.
In dress and manner he had the air of a gentleman, but at the same time there
was a suggestion of loudness and hardness about him that belied the
description. He did not see Ralph, for he advanced noisily into the room.</p>
<p>"I've been looking for you everywhere," he said. "Why are you hiding here,
old lady?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;VINCENT DASHWOOD</h2>
<p>Ralph's face grew stern as he stared at the intruder. The new-comer returned
the stare with insolent audacity. The pleased and softened expression had left
Lady Dashwood's features, she looked white and anxious, and Ralph could see
that her hands were trembling. It was quite evident that she was greatly afraid
of the man with the cold black eyes.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon," the newcomer muttered. "Didn't know you were engaged. Friend
of yours?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Ralph Darnley," Lady Dashwood said. "A very old friend of the family,
or, at any rate his father was. Let me introduce you to Mr. Vincent
Dashwood."</p>
<p>"I have heard of you," said Ralph, with a queer vibration in his voice. "I
understand that one time your father had some idea of claiming the succession
to the property. I have heard my father speak of your branch of the
family."</p>
<p>Dashwood muttered something that Ralph could not quite follow.</p>
<p>"We could tell a different story, the old lady and self," he went on
suggestively. "I shall have a pleasant surprise for Sir George some of these
days. I'm only waiting for some papers from the other side and I shall move. My
father married a Californian lady, you see, and they are pretty careless there
in their keeping of records. Still, it is only a matter of time."</p>
<p>"That is very strange," Ralph said grimly. "My father also married a
Californian lady. Oh, you need not look so uncomfortable; I am not likely to
interfere with your claim. Indeed, I may be in a position to assist you a
little later."</p>
<p>Just for the moment there was a queer grey tint on Vincent Dashwood's face.
He seemed to be horribly frightened about something. But the expression passed,
and his old saturnine look returned. Ralph was smiling, too, as if something
amused him. Lady Dashwood glanced from one to the other furtively, as if she
feared some outbreak of violence. There was no means of reading Ralph's
thoughts from the expression of his face, or Dashwood would not have been
standing there so utterly at his ease. For he was a scoundrel of the vilest
type, the class who do not hesitate to blackmail women.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll just go and look round till you have finished with the
gentleman," Dashwood said airily. "Then mind that you are ready for our little
business, old lady. I've got to be in London this evening, and no mistake about
it. By the way, the Hall is in the hands of the firemen and police, but I'm
told that no great damage has been done."</p>
<p>The speaker swaggered from the room with his hands in his pockets, whistling
as he went. Ralph's expression grew stern and hard.</p>
<p>"So this is one of the crosses that you have to bear," he said. "At the risk
of being curious, I must ask you a question. Is this the man for whose sake you
have been raising money on the family jewels? How long has it been going
on?"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood clasped her hands and the tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Nearly two years," she whispered. "Thank God, you have come to me, for my
strength would not have borne the burden much longer. Nobody knows anything;
nobody suspects but Slight. And he pretended to be my grandson. We were both
utterly deceived. He knows everything, he told me all about the original
quarrel, he had letters which I had written from time to time to your&mdash;to
my son. And he is an infamous scoundrel. He desired me to keep his presence and
his claim a secret, and for the credit of the family I did so. The few who know
him think he comes from the Yorkshire side of the house. He traded on my fears;
he knew what I thought of him. And when he had drained me of thousands, and in
sheer despair I pressed him to push on his claim, he always pleaded that he
could not get certain papers&mdash;his mother's marriage certificate, I think
it was. Mind you, I believed in him implicitly; with all the sacred private
information he had, I could do nothing else. And Slight also was equally
deceived. He has had nearly everything of mine that he could lay his hands on.
You see that I am powerless to protest; if I had forced him to speak, there
would only have been a scandal. He has been getting bolder lately or he would
not have spoken so freely to you just now. And directly I saw your face to-day
I knew at once that it had all been a hideous mistake. You will free me from
that man, Ralph?"</p>
<p>"Not quite yet," Ralph replied. "You must play your part a little longer.
If, as you say, you have nothing more to bestow, you need not be afraid of him.
That man has given me a new idea for bringing about the object that I have most
closely at heart. I am going to make use of him, if necessary. If it is not
necessary, then I shall make very short work of Mr. Vincent Dashwood. But
before that you must tell me everything. Mind, I say everything as regards
my&mdash;your son's marriage with Maria Edgerton. I believe that marriage was
the cause of all the mischief."</p>
<p>"Indeed it was," Lady Dashwood said. Her voice was filled with the deepest
sadness. "What will you think of me when you hear of the part I played in that
unhappy affair? But I cannot tell you now, I am unfit to go into the matter at
present. The shock of meeting you has been almost more than I can bear. Come
and dine with me here on Saturday night, and I will tell you everything. My
dear Ralph&mdash;if I may call you so in private&mdash;is it possible that your
coming is the augury of a happier time for me? Happiness I won't ask for, but I
should like to go down to the grave in peace."</p>
<p>"It shall be no fault of mine if you do not," Ralph replied. "I have planned
out my scheme and I am going through with it to the end. There may be troubles
and trials to come, but everything is going to end happily for us all.
Good-bye."</p>
<p>Ralph held out his hand, but Lady Dashwood drew him down to her chair.</p>
<p>"Give me a kiss, my bonny boy," she whispered. "It may be as well for us to
keep up the formality and play the drama till the time comes, but it is no harm
to kiss an old woman and let her look into the eyes that she has seen in her
dreams for forty weary years. God bless you, Ralph, and prosper your schemes,
for nothing you do will be wrong."</p>
<p>Ralph went on his way presently through the shrubbery in the direction of
the Hall. A great crowd of people still lingered there, but the police had kept
almost intact the trim lawn and the beds of brilliant flowers. Inside the house
were a posse of police and a few firemen from Longtown. In the stable yard the
scarlet fire engine glittered in the sun. So far as it was possible to see, no
great harm had been done.</p>
<p>Nobody was allowed in the house except the firemen and police, an inspector
informed Ralph, who had asked for Sir George. None of the structure had been
much damaged, none of the furniture had suffered anything except from smoke and
water. There was just a suspicion that one of the great beams under the hall
floor was still smouldering, and the firemen were going to stay until they were
absolutely sure on the point.</p>
<p>"Most extraordinary thing, Darnley," Sir George said. "There seemed to be
nothing but smoke. Slight will tell you that there was nothing but smoke. At
the present moment an expert in this kind of things is making an examination
with a view to discovering the cause of the outbreak. Nuisance to have these
people here, but it can't be helped."</p>
<p>"Better these, Sir George, than Mr. Mayfield's friends," Slight croaked. "At
any rate, we have got rid of them for the present. If somebody set the house
afire on purpose, they could not have done us a better turn, seems to me."</p>
<p>Slight spoke loudly as a man in a kind of uniform came up. He touched his
cap to Sir George, and looked fixedly at the old butler. Evidently he had
overheard what was said.</p>
<p>"Many things more unlikely than that," he said. "Sir George, I think that I
have discovered the origin of the mischief, if you will kindly come this
way."</p>
<p>"Of course I was joking," Slight said indignantly. "You don't suppose that I
mean to imply that the fire was anything but an accident, Mr. Sayers?"</p>
<p>"All the same it was no accident," the official said grimly. "If you will
come this way, I will prove to you that the fire was a wicked and deliberate
act on the part of somebody."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;WHO DID IT?</h2>
<p>There was a smile on Slight's face, as if he rather enjoyed the situation.
After all was said and done, the culprit had been successful in bringing about
the thing the old butler most desired. Fortunately no harm had been done to the
house; there was nothing the matter beyond the damage caused by smoke and
water, nothing that the work of a day or two could not put right. At the same
time this attempt to destroy the house had been the means of removing from it
the trio whose presence had been so great a humiliation. The police had cleared
everybody out of the house, indeed the Hall was likely to remain empty now till
they had investigated the causes of the fire.</p>
<p>"It might have been worse, sir," Slight whispered to Ralph. "It's a good way
of getting rid of those fellows till Sir George is ready to pack them off
altogether. Whoever did this was a sort of friend of ours."</p>
<p>Ralph started. Slight's suggestion had given him a sudden idea.</p>
<p>"That may be," he said, "but you will admit that the experiment is a risky
one. The place might have been utterly destroyed. Still, it is yet to be proved
that this is the work of an incendiary. I can hardly believe that it is."</p>
<p>The inspector led the way to the Hall. So far as the eye of a novice could
judge, it was here that the fire had burst out. The floor was black and scarred
and a few beams were still hot from the effects of the flames. The floor was
littered with some crisp ashes.</p>
<p>"Now I want to call your attention to this, Sir George," the inspector said.
"Nothing has been destroyed here, nothing but the floor and a portion of the
ceiling. There must have been a very fierce blaze here, and yet there is
nothing for the flames to feed on. Then where did all those crisp short ashes
come from? See what a pile there is of them! What was it that burnt here so
fiercely?"</p>
<p>"It certainly is a strange thing," Sir George murmured.</p>
<p>"Very strange, sir. There was nothing left on the hall floor last night, I
suppose? No packing cases or anything of that kind, Sir George?"</p>
<p>"There was not," Slight exclaimed. "I can answer for that, nothing
whatever."</p>
<p>"Which renders my suspicions all the more certain," the official went on.
"The short crisp ashes represented straw, a large bundle of straw dumped down
on the floor and set fire to by some person or other. Please look at this."</p>
<p>The speaker stooped down and gathered up a handful of the crisp ashes,
smoothing them out on the palm of his hand. At intervals there were yellow
shining specks in the grains.</p>
<p>"Will you kindly look closely?" he said. "Amongst the charred mass you can
plainly see specks of straw that have escaped the fire. It seems to me an
amazing thing that anybody could carry straw into the house like this without
being found out. But there it is, and there is an end of it. You are quite sure
as to the straw, Sir George?"</p>
<p>"Quite," Dashwood muttered. "Most amazing. We did not go to bed till very
late, which makes it all the more remarkable. It must have been practically
daylight before the miscreant could have begun to work."</p>
<p>"It certainly is a novelty," the Inspector replied, "but I want to convince
you fully that I am right in my conclusion. You will see that parts of the
ashes, very minute parts, are plastered together as if they were wet. Also you
will see that the floor has been burnt in a kind of channel nearly as far as
the door. It is only a narrow channel, but at the same time it is perfectly
well defined. Now, what caused the floor to burn in that erratic manner? I am
going to tell you. Let us follow that track up as far as the door. There is a
large stone with little cracks at the side into which a liquid of some kind has
fallen or run rather."</p>
<p>The speaker bent down and rolled a scrap of paper into the moisture which
lay shining in the crack of the stone. Then he handed the paper to Sir
George.</p>
<p>"Will you kindly smell that, sir," he asked, "and tell me what you make of
it?"</p>
<p>"No trouble at all about that," Dashwood exclaimed; "the stuff is paraffin
beyond a doubt."</p>
<p>"Precisely. The straw was dumped on the floor and then saturated with
paraffin. If the straw was slightly damp, that would account for the dense
quantity of smoke. The paraffin ran into little ripples over the floor, which
accounts for the strange track of the flames. But we can ascertain that to a
certainty."</p>
<p>A question or two being asked, it was discovered that a large can of
petroleum was missing from one of the tool-sheds. A little later the empty tin
was discovered in one of the flower-beds. The discussion was at its height when
Mary appeared. She looked very pale and shaky, otherwise she maintained her
self-possession. But as she listened to the strange story it seemed to Ralph
Darnley that she was disturbed about something. The pallor of her face became
more marked, her eyes filled with something like fear. Did the girl know
anything about it, Ralph asked himself? If not, why did she appear to be so
strangely moved by the plain recital? The thought was ignoble and unworthy, but
Ralph could not free himself from it altogether. He drew Mary a little apart
from the rest; he could see that she was trembling with some strong
emotion.</p>
<p>"The old house has had a very narrow escape," he began. "All Horace
Mayfield's carefully prepared plans were very nearly in vain. If the house had
been destroyed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I did not look at it in that light," Mary stammered. "As you say,
nothing could have mattered had the house perished. Where are those men
now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. It does not in the least matter. As things stand at present,
the police will not permit anybody to be in the house except one or two like
ourselves. Until their investigations are complete and they have gathered all
their evidence, nobody will be permitted to sleep in the house. The men you
speak of will be treated just like anybody else. It seems as if Fate were
fighting on your side, Mary. You have no occasion to fear Horace Mayfield
now."</p>
<p>Mary smiled faintly. It was evident that she was deeply troubled about
something.</p>
<p>"I think I understand you," she said presently. "The loss of the house would
have been a dreadful grief to me. But, still, these natural misfortunes happen
to all of us, and I daresay I could have suffered the loss as well as most
people. And the blow would have possessed many compensations. To be free from
Horace Mayfield, ah!"</p>
<p>Mary finished her speech with a deep, long-drawn sigh. But the whiteness did
not leave her face, the look of fear still lurked in her blue eyes. Ralph took
a step forward and bent down so that he could whisper his words into Mary's
ear.</p>
<p>"Your pride would have carried you through that," he said. "At the same
time, your position had driven you almost to despair. You know more than you
care to say, Mary, you know more than the rest of us how the fire came about.
Can you look me in the face and deny it? Are you going to tell me the
truth?"</p>
<p>Mary's face flamed with anger. She stepped back, and her passionate eyes
flashed in Ralph's direction. He could see the crimson mounting to her
temples.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would like to accuse me of the crime?" she asked breathlessly.
"Perhaps you would like to suggest that I did it to save a scandal? That I
risked my own life, and the lives of other people, because I was afraid of a
paltry disgrace? Is there anything else that you would like to imply, Mr.
Darnley?"</p>
<p>"You are talking nonsense," Ralph said coldly, "and you know it. I am not
insinuating anything of the kind. But you know quite well who the culprit
is."</p>
<p>Suddenly Mary's manner changed. She grew quiet and docile. Ralph could see
that her lips were trembling, and that she found it hard to keep back the
tears.</p>
<p>"Forgive me," she whispered. "Think how hard I am tried, how hard it all is
for me. If I were a man I should probably take a more rational view of the
case. Remember how my whole heart and soul are wrapped up in this house, I
could fight to save it from contamination as a mother would try to shield an
erring son. If I lost it I should die!"</p>
<p>"You would not," Ralph said. "If, by any trick of fortune, Dashwood Hall
passed out of your possession, it would be the very best thing that ever
happened to you. If you had to go out into the world to get your own living it
would be the making of your character. It would bring out all the natural
nobility of your nature&mdash;you would look back to the past with remorse. Of
that I am certain."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Mary said coldly. "Perhaps you would like to bring that misfortune
about?"</p>
<p>"I should," Ralph retorted. "If I could be cruel to be kind like that, I
should not hesitate for a moment. But we are getting a long way from the point.
I said that if you had no hand in this business, you know who did it."</p>
<p>"I have my suspicions. But, until I can verify them, it would be wrong to
speak. Even if I knew for certain, I should hesitate to tell anybody what I had
discovered. One thing I can promise you&mdash;the attempt will not be made
again...What are those people so excited about? Have they made some fresh
discovery? Let us go and see."</p>
<p>Sir George and the Inspector were closely examining some shining object that
the latter held in the palm of his hand. There was a grim look on Slight's
face.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Ralph asked. "What is the latest sensational development of
the mystery?"</p>
<p>"This, sir," the Inspector exclaimed. "We have found this match-box under
the burnt straw."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE SILVER CLUB</h2>
<p>The silver match-box was a peculiar one and quite out of the common run of
such things. It had a spring lid deeply engraved with a hunting scene, in the
centre of the medallion a pair of initials were ingeniously woven together in
small stones. The Inspector asked Sir George if he could identify it as part of
the family property.</p>
<p>"Never saw it before," Dashwood said promptly. "I am certain that the thing
does not belong to anybody in my house. What do you make the initials to
be?"</p>
<p>"'V.D.' or 'D.V.', sir," the Inspector said. "That is perfectly plain. Now
does anybody know a person who bears those initials? I should say that the
matches are of foreign make, for they are flat, wooden ones, such as one rarely
sees in this country. The first thing we have to do is to find out who is this
'V.D.' or 'D.V.' is. He seems to have dropped his matchbox into the fire.
Probably, the blaze startled him by its suddenness. But I don't suppose we
shall find much difficulty in proving who the owner is."</p>
<p>Sir George shook his head: evidently the puzzle was utterly beyond him.
Slight crossed over to one of the windows as if the whole subject had ceased to
interest him. He made a sign to Ralph and the latter joined the old servant. He
could see that Slight was suppressing a certain excitement.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" he asked. "Have you solved the problem?"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Ralph, I've only made it worse," Slight whispered. "I know quite
well who that box belongs to, for I've seen it in his possession a score of
times, to say nothing of the initials. Did you not meet a Mr. Vincent Dashwood
at the dower house to-day?"</p>
<p>Ralph started in his turn. Vincent Dashwood's initials were on that box
surely enough. And, that being the case, what did Mary know of the man? Was she
shielding the man who gave out more or less directly that he was the proper
owner of Dashwood Hall? Mary was not the girl to show any clemency to an
impostor, and if, on the other hand, she did not regard him as an impostor she
would be the last person to pretend to a position that she had no right to
occupy. But Slight would know.</p>
<p>"I did meet that man you name, but I can't understand how you came to know
it so soon," Ralph said. "A tiger, if I ever saw one, Slight. And he let me
know pretty clearly that he had more than a passing claim to a deal that other
people are enjoying. Is Mr. Vincent Dashwood pretty well known to people here,
Slight?"</p>
<p>"Not to anybody but her ladyship and myself," Slight replied. "Mind you, I
can't make out whether he's an impostor or not; at least, I was very uncertain
in my mind until you came along, sir. He claims to be the son of the late Ralph
Dashwood and he has proofs that would satisfy any court in England; and anyone
except me. As yet he can't produce the certificate of marriage of his mother
and father. But he has any number of private papers,&mdash;letters from her
ladyship to her son and all the rest of it, to say nothing of being familiar
with the place. He didn't want to make a fuss about his claim; he wanted to
have it quite plain first. He's been here for a long time."</p>
<p>"Blackmailing Lady Dashwood, I suppose? The fellow is too cowardly to claim
the property out and out. In that case he would either have to substantiate his
claim or run the risk of a long term of imprisonment if he failed. And,
meanwhile, Lady Dashwood displays a weakness that is almost criminal. She half
doubts this rascal, and yet at the same time she allows him to take the
proceeds of the disposal of the family jewels. Half of the weakness is dictated
by the dread of Miss Mary finding out the truth. If there are other
reasons&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ay, there are other reasons, Mr. Ralph," Slight said in a broken voice. "If
you only knew everything, you would pity her ladyship. She has kept this secret
as well as she has kept the rest. Miss Mary knows nothing; she was meant to
know nothing."</p>
<p>"And now she will know everything, everybody will know everything. The story
of the match-box will have to be told, and the owner will have to explain how
it came here and who he is. You should have known better, Slight, than try to
keep a secret like this. Sooner or later the explosion was bound to come. What
are you going to do about it now?"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to do anything, sir," Slight said bluntly. "It is not for me
in my position to push myself forward. Let the police hunt the matter up for
themselves. If Mr. Vincent Dashwood likes to lie low it makes no difference to
us."</p>
<p>Ralph smiled at the suggestion. It was so like the policy of the house to
leave things to chance like this. In a vague way, Ralph began to see that Fate
was playing into his hands. He would let the rod fall. He would be cruel to be
kind. As to the rest, it was in Mary's hands; all would depend upon how she
behaved for the next day or two. It all stood out clearly in Ralph's mind now
like the thread of a connected story.</p>
<p>"I'll go as far as the dower house," he said thoughtfully. "I should like to
say a few words to Mr. Vincent Dashwood. Am I likely to find him there?"</p>
<p>"You are that, Mr. Ralph," Slight snapped. "When he isn't spending the money
that does not belong to him, he is generally to be found not far from her
ladyship. And this game has been going on for the last two years. I'm an old
man, and hope I know my position in the place to which God has called me, but
I've come very near to shooting that man more than once. Calls himself a
Dashwood, and he has all the papers to prove himself a Dashwood, and yet he is
no more a chip off the old block than I am. And yet you can't trip him up in
anything, only in one way."</p>
<p>"And what is that?" Ralph smiled.</p>
<p>"Well, he wasn't astonished to see you, sir. He pretends to be the son of
the late Ralph Dashwood, and, as such must have a pretty good idea of his
father's physical appearance. Now you are the very image of what Mr. Ralph used
to be. And this Vincent does not comment upon your likeness to my late young
master. Why don't you step in, sir, why don't you step in and drive the
blackguard away?"</p>
<p>"All in good time," Ralph replied. "You may rest assured that I shall speak
out to some purpose when I am ready. Now I'll go as far as the dower house. I
take it that the family will sleep there tonight."</p>
<p>Ralph crossed the lawn thoughtfully in the direction of the dower house. He
understood the footman to say that her ladyship was somewhere in the
garden.</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood was found at last, seated under a spacious cedar tree, which
was one of the ornaments of the garden. She was not alone, for Vincent Dashwood
was by her side. The man seemed to be hot and angry about something, and it was
evident that Lady Dashwood had been weeping. A quick anger possessed Ralph, and
it was all he could do to refrain from laying hands on this impostor, who was
causing such trouble and misery here. A few words and the bubble would be
pricked. Still, there was always the great plan before Ralph's eyes, the plan
of his life with which nothing must interfere. He would have withdrawn now,
only Lady Dashwood caught sight of him and beckoned him to her side. Vincent
Dashwood scowled openly at the intruder.</p>
<p>"I was just coming over to see you," Ralph said. "You will be pleased to
hear that the fire has done no particular damage, nothing that a little soap
and water and some paint can't put right. But for the present the police and
the fire people prefer that the house should not be used. As to the
servants&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They can all come here," Lady Dashwood said. "I will go over and see Sir
George without delay. But, seeing that the house is all right, why do the
authorities interfere in this unreasonable way?"</p>
<p>"They think that they have made an important discovery," Ralph explained.
"They are under the impression that the fire is not an accident, and, really, I
have been converted to the same opinion. It seems almost incredible, but
somebody brought a lot of straw into the house and set it on fire, after
saturating the mass with paraffin. There is no doubt about the straw, for
fragments of it can be seen in the ashes, and distinct traces of paraffin can
be found. Had not the floor and the walls been as hard as iron, a great tragedy
might have taken place. But, to make matters certain, the police found a silver
match-box with a monogram in the ashes."</p>
<p>"The blackguards!" Vincent Dashwood cried. "I'm glad of that. Let us hope
that the box will lead to the discovery of the culprit."</p>
<p>"That is not quite likely," Ralph said drily. "I came over here on purpose
to get at the bottom of that match-box business. It is rather a novelty in the
way of a box, for I have seen it&mdash;even the matches are original. The
monogram on it is 'V. D.,' which happens to be your initials, Mr. Dashwood. To
go further, old Slight says the box is yours. Can you account for this strange
happening?"</p>
<p>Dashwood started and changed colour. He plunged his hands into his pockets
apparently in search of something he was unable to find.</p>
<p>"I've lost it," he cried. "There is no denying the fact, Mr. Darnley, that I
had just the kind of box you describe. It is possible that I dropped it, and
the culprit picked it up. I should hardly be likely&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker paused, and Ralph filled in the rest of the speech for him.</p>
<p>"I perfectly understand," he said drily. "It is hardly likely that Mr.
Vincent Dashwood would go out of his way to destroy a property which sooner or
later he looks forward to enjoying as his own. I think that is what you mean to
convey?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;A FRESH CALAMITY</h2>
<p>Dashwood nodded sulkily. He had a vague idea that Ralph was making fun of
him in some way. Still, he was understood to say that such was his precise
meaning. Lady Dashwood rose and walked off in the direction of the house; she
had to see to the comfort of her expected visitors.</p>
<p>"I hope you will dine with us to-night, Mr. Darnley," she said. "Just Sir
George and Mary, with Vincent here&mdash;nothing more than a quiet family
party."</p>
<p>"Too quiet and too family for me," Dashwood muttered. "You can count me out.
Besides, I have the most important business in London to-night."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood looked relieved. There was no mistaking the expression of her
face as she turned away. Dashwood noticed it, and his face flushed dully. He
made a motion to follow, but Ralph laid a strong hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>"One moment, if you please," he said, "I should like to have a few words
with you on the subject of that match-box. The police are pretty certain to ask
you a great many questions concerning it, as you can see for yourself?"</p>
<p>"Let 'em ask," growled Dashwood, "it's nothing to do with me. I dropped that
box, and the chap who set fire to the house picked it up."</p>
<p>"But suppose that chap, as you call him, happened to see you hanging about
the house at a very early hour in the morning, a groom or somebody of that
kind, who was prepared to swear to your identity? What then, my dear sir?"</p>
<p>Ralph was only drawing a bow at a venture; he was really working out a
little theory of his own, but the arrow went home to the feather. Dashwood's
face turned to a dull grey; he seemed to be utterly unnerved for the
moment.</p>
<p>"Look here," he blustered presently, "what do you think you are likely to
gain by asking me all these prying questions? Suppose I was hanging about the
place last night. What then? Isn't it natural? Can't you understand the
interest I take in my own property? You don't suppose that I should be likely
to burn down a house of my own that contained some fifty thousand pounds worth
of artistic treasures?"</p>
<p>"Your logic is too strong for me," Ralph smilingly admitted. "As the
claimant to the property and the title you are hardly likely to destroy the
house. But there is one thing that puzzles me&mdash;if things are as you say,
why do you not press your claim?"</p>
<p>"Because I am short of a certain document. It is rather an important
document for it happens to be my mother's marriage certificate. But I am
informed that the proper paper will comes into my possession soon, and then I
can move. Till that time I have decided to let sleeping dogs lie."</p>
<p>"Meaning that Sir George is to remain in blissful ignorance, I presume?"</p>
<p>"That's about it. Let him make the best of his reign. And that stuck-up
daughter of his! She'll get her face to the grindstone before she is much
older. Besides, there is another matter. Lady Dashwood has to be
considered."</p>
<p>With difficulty Ralph disguised his contempt. A fine consideration the
speaker had for Lady Dashwood! He was trading cunningly on her weakness and her
desire to avoid scandal. It was his cue to pretend that he did not care to take
any steps during the lifetime of the unhappy old lady. He had stripped her
pretty well of all she had, without any risk to himself. So long as the golden
stream flowed he need never fear.</p>
<p>Directly he came to make his claim he would be asked searching questions and
would have to satisfy keen legal minds of the honesty of his proofs. Meanwhile,
he preferred to blackmail an innocent old lady who was too ill and broken down
to protest. Ralph read the fellow like an open book, but he was going to make
use of him later, if needs be. Therefore it was that he disguised his feelings
now.</p>
<p>"That sounds very creditable," he said. "It is very good of you to consider
Lady Dashwood's feelings in this way. I hope she is correspondingly
grateful."</p>
<p>"She isn't anything of the kind," Dashwood protested. "She fairly hates me.
Every bit of affection that she has is centered on Sir George Dashwood's girl.
Everything must be made smooth for Mary. Maybe her pride will have a bit of a
dash before long. I don't know why I am telling you all these things, except
that you seem a good sort. For all I know to the contrary, you may be a police
spy inquiring into my past. All the same, I don't think the old lady would
stoop to that kind of thing."</p>
<p>"You are quite right," Ralph said drily. "I'm sure she couldn't. I must be
going now. I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you at dinner to-night?"</p>
<p>Dashwood winked significantly. There were better attractions elsewhere. The
air seemed to be all the sweeter and purer after he had gone. Very slowly and
thoughtfully Ralph made his way across the fields in the direction of his
temporary abode. Fate seemed determined to place all the threads in his hands;
everything was arranging itself just as he could have wished. His plan of
action became quite clear and plain. There were certain circumstances to be
taken into consideration, more particularly the way that Mary would act in the
future. And Vincent Dashwood would be an important pawn in the game. By the
time that it became necessary to dress for dinner Ralph had worked it all
out.</p>
<p>He walked across the fields in the direction of the dower house. It was a
lovely night, clear and bright, with no breath of air stirring. Ralph could see
the red gables of the Hall beyond the noble elms and beeches, and a pleasant
picture rose before his eyes. He could see himself as master of the place with
Mary by his side&mdash;not the Mary of the proud, cold face and haughty eye,
but another Mary, soft and beautiful, as she emerged chastened and purified
from the furnace of the family pride. There would be trouble and humiliation
first, but it should all come about, or Ralph would know the reason why.</p>
<p>He was still debating the matter as he reached the dower house and a
well-trained footman took him as far as the drawing-room. The blinds were not
down yet, so that the room was filled with the saffron glory of the sunset. It
was all so refined and homelike, so different to anything that Ralph had ever
seen before. It was the thing that Ralph had dreamt of, the homelife that had
occupied much of his waking dreams. It lay before him now, but there was much
to be done first.</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood came stately and smiling into the room. The look in her eyes
was warm and affectionate as Ralph took her hand. Mary was not down yet, she
explained, but the girl was dressing for dinner, and she was much better for a
long sleep. Then Mary came into the room, serene and calm, with a flush on her
beautiful face as she caught sight of Ralph.</p>
<p>"You have heard all the good news?" she asked. "The Hall has not been in the
least damaged by the fire. My father ran in to tell me a little time ago, and
he has gone back, preferring to dress at home. I understand that we shall be
back home on Saturday."</p>
<p>"So I am told," Ralph replied. "It has been a great inconvenience, of
course, but it most opportunely rid you of very undesirable visitors. By the
time that Saturday comes you will be in a position to defy them."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I hope so," Mary said, with the deep flush still on her face. "My
father intends to bring those documents so marvellously recovered here with him
to-night, and to-morrow he will take them to London. Mr. Mayfield is a clever
man, but circumstances have been too strong for him this time. Mr. Darnley, you
are our good fairy; without you I have not the least idea what we should have
done."</p>
<p>"Don't be so sure of that," Ralph smiled. "The fairy of my time always
seemed to want something in return for past favours, and you may find that I am
keeping very closely to precedent. But is not Sir George very late?"</p>
<p>A big clock over the carved oak mantel chimed the hour of eight. Lady
Dashwood shook her head, and explained that one must make allowances just now.
There would be no great harm done if the dinner waited for five minutes. It was
all the same to Ralph, who asked nothing better than to sit in that perfect
atmosphere and contemplate the beauty of the girl before him. He had to wait
some time for the prize, but he knew that it would fall into his fingers at
last. There was one short cut to victory, but he wasn't going to take that way.
He watched the sunshine playing on Mary's face, he seemed to see clean through
the mask of pride to the pure white soul below.</p>
<p>"I am going to ask you a question," the girl said. "You have never told me
what was your business here, except that you had lost your money and that you
had come into these parts to pick up something from the wreck. Is everything
gone, Mr. Darnley?"</p>
<p>"Everything," Ralph smiled, "save honour. My father trusted Horace Mayfield,
and the result is that when I leave here I shall have to get my living. I don't
quite know what I am going to do, but I am strong and capable and steady. I may
say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Here is Sir George at last," Lady Dashwood exclaimed. "What a hurry he
seems to be in. Mary, my dear, will you please to ring the bell and tell Seddon
we are ready for dinner...Why&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sir George had come hurriedly into the room. The white tie had come
unfastened and hung in two streamers down his shirt front, but he did not seem
to notice it. His face was as white as his tie; his forehead was damp with
moisture.</p>
<p>"Ive lost them," he cried; "stolen out of my desk! All those precious
papers! And now I am more in the power of that scoundrel Mayfield than ever!
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>
<p>He dropped into a chair and burst into a flood of maudlin, senile tears.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;PRIDE OR PREJUDICE</h2>
<p>Ralph's first feeling was one of contempt. It was almost incredible that a
man of Sir George's position could behave in so childish and weak a fashion.
Here was the diplomatist who had been so popular in Paris, so bland and
dignified, assuming the role of a silly girl who had lost some foolish
ornament. For the time being he had cast his manhood entirely behind him. He
sat on the couch with the tears streaming down his cheeks, great sobs burst
from his chest.</p>
<p>"Gone!" he wailed. "Absolutely vanished. I locked them up in a desk last
night, or the night before, and now they have disappeared. Don't tell me they
have not been stolen, because I know better. Besides, nothing else is
disturbed. And those papers were there to prove my absolute claim to Dashwood
Hall. With those documents in my possession I could have raised as much money
as I needed. I could have returned here in a day or two and rid myself of that
scoundrel, Mayfield, for ever. He meant to cover me with ignominy and disgrace,
but the fire prevented that. And now he has managed to get those papers
stolen."</p>
<p>"That is impossible," Ralph cried. "He did not know of their existence."</p>
<p>"Why not! How can you prove that he didn't know? He is one of the cleverest
scoundrels in the world. He gets to know everything, and he was actually under
my roof on the very night that the papers were so marvellously recovered. It is
just possible that he was spying about all the time."</p>
<p>"It does not seem at all probable," Lady Dashwood said in a faint
whisper.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, it does," Sir George replied. "I'm quite ready to argue it out
either way. We will admit that Mayfield didn't know till later, till the next
morning, in fact, when I told him what had happened, and practically ordered
him out of the house. He saw at once then that he no longer held me in his
grip; he wanted nobody to tell him that those precious papers were close at
hand. He made up his mind to obtain possession of them without delay.
Therefore, he invented the idea of the fire&mdash;a fire that would cause a
deal of smoke and confusion and yet not do much harm. Under cover of the fire
he stole the papers."</p>
<p>Ralph was listening with a kind of painful toleration of the snuffling
speaker. A startling idea came into his mind now. He glanced at Lady Dashwood,
who seemed to read his thoughts. In the light of their especial knowledge,
facts pointed to quite another individual as the culprit. If the fire had been
the work of an incendiary, then that criminal was undoubtedly Vincent Dashwood,
whose match-box had been found in the ashes. Vincent Dashwood had palpably been
uneasy when the missing match-box had been mentioned, he was still more uneasy
at Ralph's suggestion that he had been hanging about Dashwood Hall within an
hour or so of the outbreak. Was there some deep and powerful reason why Vincent
Dashwood desired to see the old house burnt to the ground? Was it to bury some
secret in the ashes?</p>
<p>The more Ralph pondered over this, the deeper the mystery became. He could
see quite clearly how Mayfield's scheme would benefit by possession of those
papers. What he could not fathom was what Vincent Dashwood had to gain by a
disastrous fire. He would go into this without taking anybody into his
confidence, Ralph thought. There was yet another danger that struck much closer
at the root of his happiness&mdash;the position in which Mary stood in the face
of this catastrophe.</p>
<p>He glanced across at the girl, who stood on the far side of the drawing-room
with the light of the shaded lamps on her face. He could see that her features
were pale and drawn, that there was a hunted, haunted look in her eyes. It was
quite evident that she fully appreciated the danger of the situation. And yet
the feeling uppermost in her mind was the feeling of bitterness and sorrow for
the sorry part her father was playing.</p>
<p>"I should like to understand the position fully," she said. "What difference
does the loss of those papers imply? Cannot you do without them, father?"</p>
<p>"I am helpless, my dear," Sir George groaned. "I am the head of the family,
and the man who enjoys the revenue of the estates, and I shall probably
continue to do so until I die. But for the next six months or so I could not
raise a penny on the property, not till the time mentioned in the late owner's
will expires, when I become legally possessed of everything, even though a
direct heir of Ralph Dashwood appears. Then I can borrow as much money as I
please. Now, I am absolutely at the mercy of Horace Mayfield."</p>
<p>The pallor on Mary's face deepened; hope faded from her heart. She was in
the toils again and made no attempt to disguise the fact. It was quite
immaterial to her who had those papers, so long as they were gone.</p>
<p>"Let me make the position quite clear," she went on, in a hard, level voice.
"Let us revert to the condition of affairs existing before those papers were
found; let us assume that they never existed at all. You owe a very large sum
of money, father, a sum that it is impossible for you to pay. If you fail to
raise the amount, which we may take for granted, something like disgrace and
dishonour falls on you. That is not your fault, I know, but other people will
not think so, and the head of the house of Dashwood will stand before his
fellow men stamped as little better than a felon. Is that so?"</p>
<p>"That is the way in which the world will regard it," Sir George groaned.</p>
<p>"Quite so, father. You can't find the money, and nobody will find it for
you. As I know already, it is useless to appeal to Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"Quite, my dear," Lady Dashwood murmured. "I would give anything to avert
the disgrace, but I have nothing. I am a wicked old woman, and my sins are
finding me out. I have parted with everything, even to my jewels, to keep a
certain secret, and I see now that the sacrifice is going to be all in
vain."</p>
<p>Mary turned and laid a soothing hand on the speaker's arm. There was
something sweet, almost affectionate in the action.</p>
<p>"A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind," she said bitterly. "After all
there is a way out of the trouble, there has been a way out all along. Our
blessing in disguise in the matter seems to be Mr. Mayfield. We will ignore for
the moment that he has himself brought the situation about for his own ends.
The fact remains that he can keep the disgrace away. He has offered to avert
the catastrophe at a price. I am the price. By saying one simple word
everything is changed. And in six months, you, my father, are master of
Dashwood absolutely. I have only to say, 'Yes,' and the thing is done. It is a
simple little word, which has been the cause of untold misery to thousands of
poor girls. But, after all, there have been greater sacrifices for less
satisfactory results. And now let us go into dinner."</p>
<p>The girl spoke quietly enough, but nothing could disguise the bitterness and
scorn that rang in every word. It was all very wrong, it was dictated by
motives clearly open to question, but in spite of everything, it seemed to
Ralph that he had never admired Mary more than he did at that moment. He knew
of the anguish of disappointment and despair that filled her cup to
overflowing; he could realise the difference that the last half-hour had made
to her outlook on life; he knew how much she hated and despised the man to whom
she was once more tied by the hands of Fate.</p>
<p>He knew also that filial love and affection had nothing whatever to do with
the fatal resolve. It was family pride that was the mainspring of the action.
Mary stood there, proud and defiant now, with the lamplight streaming on her
face, and Ralph knew now that the time was coming for him to act. The lesson
would have to be learned, the bread of affliction must be eaten to the last
sour crust.</p>
<p>"Will Mr. Darnley please to ring the bell?" Mary went on evenly. "We shall
have the servants wondering what is the matter. It is already half-past eight,
and punctuality is one of the cardinal virtues at the dower house. If you will
look into the mirror opposite, father, you will see that your tie is all
disarranged...Give me your arm, Mr. Darnley?"</p>
<p>There was not a trace of any emotion now about Mary. She watched her father
rearranging his tie with a critical air; she began to discuss the flowers on
the dinner table as if nothing had happened out of the common. She bore the
brunt of the conversation all dinner time, for the others were strangely
silent. From time to time Mary flashed a challenge from her eyes to Ralph, as
if defiantly ignoring his views. And yet she dreaded her next meeting with
Darnley. She knew him to be poor and friendless, she believed him to be of no
particular family, but still she valued his good opinion deeply. She would have
denied that if it had been put to her directly, but in her heart of hearts she
could not disguise the true state of her feelings.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me so?" she said.</p>
<p>"Was I?" Ralph asked. "I had no idea that my looks betrayed me so badly. But
I will discuss the matter with you when we are alone."</p>
<p>It was an audacious speech, but it sounded quite naturally from Ralph's
lips. Mary could feel the colour rising to her cheeks; she felt annoyed that
she could not better control her feelings. For the rest of the meal she was
silent like the rest, and said no more till Lady Dashwood gave the signal for
departure.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;IN RECKLESS MOOD</h2>
<p>Once the ladies had departed, Sir George brightened visibly. He reached out
eagerly for the claret and drank two glasses rapidly. Ralph declined the
decanters, and also the cigar that his host handed him. He contented himself
with a cigarette; he replied more or less vaguely to Sir George's idle chatter.
It seemed almost incomprehensible to him that a father could sacrifice a
daughter to a scoundrel like Mayfield, and accept the situation as if it had
been the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>"I feel bound to have a few words with you, Sir George," he said presently.
"More by accident than anything else I seem to have been dragged into your
family secrets. We will not go into the reason why I was in a position to
render you a service a night or two ago. It is unfortunate that that service
should have proved useless, but it is more than probable than those papers will
turn up again."</p>
<p>"Never," Sir George said emphatically. "Mayfield will take care of that. He
knows that so long as he holds the papers I am quite in his power. He will lend
me the money to put me right in the comfortable assurance that at the
expiration of six months it will come back to him again. Take him all in all,
Mayfield is perhaps the most clever scoundrel that I have ever come across,
which is saying a great deal."</p>
<p>"You are convinced that Mayfield is a finished scoundrel, then?"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, what other conclusion could I come to? His every action
proves it. He has worked this thing out in the most cold-blooded way. The
fellow ought to be hounded out of society and kicked out of every respectable
house. No club should tolerate him. He's a rascal clean through."</p>
<p>There was honest indignation ringing in every word that Sir George said.
Ralph listened with cynical amusement.</p>
<p>"And yet you are going to give your only child as a hostage to the man who
has planned your social ruin," he said. "You are going to sell your daughter,
and the price is to be the silence of a scoundrel! Good heavens, man, can't you
realise the enormity of your crime! To save yourself from unpleasantness, you
permit your daughter to give herself up to a lifetime of horror and
degradation. Is this a specimen of your family pride? You are so fond of the
race, so passionately attached to it, that you are paving the way for that
rascal Mayfield eventually to succeed you as the head of the house! If you do
this thing you will be judged for it, as sure as we are face to face at this
moment. If you permit it, then you are a greater rascal by far than even
Mayfield is."</p>
<p>Ralph's words rang out clear and true, his voice vibrated with anger. A dull
flush mounted to the face of the elder man, a feeble anger filled his eyes.</p>
<p>"I can't permit you to speak to me like this," he protested. "I&mdash;I must
be the best judge of what is right and proper for my child. And Mary is pretty
certain to have her own way in the end. My good fellow, you speak as if Mary's
future was in your special keeping. Anybody would think that you had fallen in
love with the girl."</p>
<p>"I have," Ralph said calmly. "I love Mary with my whole heart and soul. I
can see the beauties of her mind as clearly as I can see the beauty of her face
under that crust of pride and arrogance. It will be my task to remove the husk
so that the flower can be seen in all its loveliness. It may not trouble you
much, it may be no particular satisfaction to you, but Mary is not going to
marry Horace Mayfield. When the time comes, Mary will marry me. But I fear that
there is a time of humiliation and suffering and poverty before her first,
poverty in which you will have your share, Sir George. It rests practically in
the girl's own hands; she can take up the sunshine of the future when she
chooses."</p>
<p>"The fellow's mad," Sir George muttered. "Clean mad. My dear Darnley, you
are talking the most abject nonsense. On your own confession you are a poor
man; you have lost everything as I did by trusting to that scoundrel. I mean to
Mayfield, who&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Precisely. We both know that man to be what he is. And in spite of what you
know, you are going to let your daughter marry him and give her your blessing.
Truly the family pride of which you boast is a poor thing! You are prepared to
commit a crime to support it. Now tell me your honest opinion&mdash;do you
suppose for a moment that Mayfield would marry Mary if she came to him
empty-handed?"</p>
<p>Sir George shook his head; he was man of the world enough to see Ralph's
point.</p>
<p>"I don't think he would," he said. "Mayfield is sufficient of a business man
to know the value of money. Of course he's fond of the girl, which is quite
natural. But I fail to see what your question has to do with the matter."</p>
<p>Ralph was not blind to the hopelessness of his task. Truly it is difficult
to know the real standard of even one's closest friend. Up to a certain point,
Ralph had regarded Sir George as an honourable man, who would have shrunk from
any act calculated to pain or harm any fellow creature. Dashwood would probably
have protested himself that such was the case. And yet here he was, prepared to
sacrifice his only child on the altar of his sinful selfishness.</p>
<p>A bitter contempt filled Ralph; he would have liked to turn on this man and
tear him to tatters with sharp-edged words. Were all people alike when it came
to the test? Ralph wondered. He half rose from his seat, and then sat down
again. It was impossible to quarrel with Mary's father; there was nothing to
gain by such a course. And Sir George seemed to divine little of what was
passing in the mind of his young companion.</p>
<p>The elder man had regained his equanimity now. He was sure that Mary would
do what he called the right thing. It was rather a nuisance, and so forth, but
then it was absurd to imagine that any girl could imperil the good name of such
a family as the Dashwoods. As Sir George sipped his wine, he caught sight of
his own head and shoulders in a Florentine mirror on the far side of the room,
and, unconsciously almost, set his tie straight. It seemed incredible to Ralph
that the man could think of such things at such a moment. But there it was. Sir
George poured out for himself another glass of wine.</p>
<p>"I can see that you are vexed," he said in his polished easy way. "As a
friend of ours you naturally would be. In addition, you are naturally
prejudiced against our friend, Horace Mayfield. So am I, but we must make the
best of it. After all, there are many standards of honour. Mayfield is a
business man; he has been trained to methods which are not in accordance with
our views. All is fair in love and war, he would argue. We must not be too hard
on our fellow creatures, Darnley."</p>
<p>"The fellow is a scoundrel," Ralph said hoarsely. "He is bad to the very
core of his being. He would never see the inside of Dashwood Hall again if you
could be free of him. And when I think of your daughter as that man's
wife&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ralph paused. He was unable to proceed. His quick imagination travelled on
ahead of him; he could picture Mary's future in the darkest colours. He knew
only too well the fire and force and passion that lay under the cold exterior.
He could guess at the unspeakable humiliation to come from Mayfield's very
touch. And this would go on not for days, but for years. And Mary would never
murmur, she would confide in nobody, she would hug the galling chains to her
breast until the canker entered the heart of the flower and killed it...</p>
<p>But Dashwood was talking again. Ralph was so lost in his own gloomy thoughts
that he had some difficulty in picking up the thread.</p>
<p>"And there is another thing, my dear fellow," Sir George murmured. "You will
excuse my saying so, but you are taking on yourself a little too much. Mary
owes her life to you on two different occasions. I am sure that we are both of
us exceedingly grateful to you. And you have proved yourself to be a real
friend in other ways. Still, that does not give you the right to harp upon this
topic quite so freely. When Mary marries Mayfield&mdash;"</p>
<p>"She never will do so," Ralph cried, forgetting himself for the moment.
"Rest assured that this hateful marriage will never take place. You may look
surprised, but wait and see. I have not finished with Mayfield yet. After this
evening is over, and I have heard Miss Dashwood's decision for the last
time&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I decline to discuss the matter any further, really I do," Sir George
protested. "My dear fellow, your remarks are in bad taste. As a gentleman, you
must see that such is the case. I must ask you to change the subject."</p>
<p>Ralph placed a firm bridle upon his tongue. He had almost forgotten himself;
he had come very near to betraying the great secret.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "As you say, I am going too far. I shall not
err in that way again, but will leave you in peace to your cigar and your
claret. Perhaps I shall be able to get some music in the drawing-room. The
quietude of this house fascinates me, all the more because I have not been
accustomed to this kind of thing."</p>
<p>Sir George smiled in a benign manner.</p>
<p>"I can understand your feelings," he said. "By all means leave me to my
cigar. It has been a very disturbing evening."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;A WARNING</h2>
<p>Ralph crossed the great hall in the direction of the drawing-room. He had
made up his mind what to do. So far as he could judge, the blow would have to
fall before long. When once Mayfield had an inkling of the truth, Ralph felt
pretty sure that Mary would be no longer under the necessity of submitting to
his persecutions. Mayfield posed as a rich man, and indeed he seemed to have
the command of money when he needed it, but Ralph had reason to know that there
was a deal of tinsel mixed up with the gold. If it could be proved to Mayfield
that Mary was no longer an heiress he would refuse to carry out his part of the
contract. He would recognise at once that the whole scheme was a failure, and
his cautious philosophy would do the rest.</p>
<p>There were two ways of getting rid of Mayfield, the first being for Ralph to
declare his own identity. But by doing so he would go far to defeat his darling
ambition of winning Mary's love on his own merits. Still, he had been prepared
to run this risk if Mayfield's persecutions continued. But now Fate had placed
in his hands another weapon by which it was possible to be rid of Mayfield and
carry on the love campaign at the same time. Whether this alternative would
have to be used without delay depended on Mary. Ralph meant to see her now and
force her to say what she was going to do. There was no time like the present.
In the silence and the moonlight this thing should be done.</p>
<p>Just for a moment it seemed to Ralph that the drawing-room was empty. There
were the shaded lamps throwing a subdued light on the old furniture and the
panelled walls. Ill at ease as he was, Ralph was conscious of the refined,
soothing air of the place. Then a gentle voice called him, and he crossed to a
distant corner of the room where Lady Dashwood was seated. Her face was white
and troubled.</p>
<p>"My dear lad," she whispered, "I felt certain that you would come to me. Sir
George cares nothing so long as he has his comforts. Mary is out of the room;
she has gone up to see old Patience, so that you can speak freely. This is a
terrible catastrophe; it places that poor child absolutely in the grip of the
scoundrel. She recognises that; she is prepared to bow to the inevitable. You
have only to look into her face to see what she is going to do. And I am to
blame for the whole miserable crime."</p>
<p>"My dear Lady Dashwood, how could you possibly avoid it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you will know some day when the truth is told. Ah, if you had a bare
idea of what a miserable, wicked old woman I am...But there is no
occasion to go into that here. The question is, can you help me, can you do
anything to prevent this thing? I used to pride myself on the fact that I had a
great deal of influence over Mary. But when it comes to a question of family
pride, I am helpless. Still, this marriage must be prevented at any cost. If
you will not speak out, I shall be compelled to do so."</p>
<p>"There is no occasion," Ralph said. "I pray you to leave me to do this in my
own way. Mary will never become the wife of Horace Mayfield."</p>
<p>A murmur of relief came from the aged listener. Her face cleared somewhat,
but the tears were still dim in her eyes. At the same time, Ralph's words were
a great comfort to her. She laid her fingers on his hand lovingly.</p>
<p>"I like to hear you speak like that," she whispered. "It reminds me of
your&mdash;of my dear son. Ralph, are you sure that you can carry out your
boast?"</p>
<p>"Quite, Lady Dashwood. As surely as I am standing here before you, I can
prevent this hateful marriage. I can prevent it even if Mary tries to thwart
me. But I must have her decision from her own lips first. I am going to be very
cruel to be very kind in the long run. And whatever happens, I am going to ask
you to trust me implicitly. Even if things look very dark for us all, you are
not to lose your faith. Remember, if events seem to point to the triumph of one
who is hateful to you, it is all being done with one end in view. Now
promise."</p>
<p>"My dear boy, I promise freely. When you look at me with those brown eyes
and speak to me with that voice from the other side of the grave, I could
promise you anything. I feel that you have come to save me; that my life is
destined to end in peace. But I am afraid that Mary is going to suffer
yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, she is," Ralph said almost sternly. "It is good for her that she should
suffer. But I shall have no fear for the result after she is tried in the
furnace. Maybe I am no better than a Quixotic fool, but I have my aim clear
before me. And now I must see Mary for some moments alone."</p>
<p>"I will send her to you," Lady Dashwood murmured as she rose from the chair.
"Ralph, you fill me with new hope and courage. I feel that I am going to do
some good with the remainder of my life yet. But do not be too hard on the
child, remember that she is more or less what I have made her. And may she
listen to the voice of reason!"</p>
<p>It was a little time later that Mary came in. She looked white and weary;
her eyes had a metallic gleam in them. All the same, she flushed under Ralph's
steady gaze. She murmured something to the effect that she had no idea Lady
Dashwood was not there.</p>
<p>"Never mind about Lady Dashwood for the present," Ralph said. "In fact, I
asked her to leave us together for a time. I have something important to say to
you, Mary. Come out on the terrace with me."</p>
<p>It was not so much a request as a command and Mary felt the hot blood rising
to her face. And yet she could not decline coldly with Ralph's eyes on hers. He
seemed to possess some magnetic influence over her. Without a word they passed
side by side out on to the terrace.</p>
<p>It was a perfect night, with a full moon swinging high overhead. In the
distance the silver light played on the roofs and chimneys of the Hall. Ralph
stood in rapt contemplation of the scene for a moment.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely perfect," he said. "A good old house in a grand old
English landscape. And for three hundred years a Dashwood has reigned here.
Truly a thing to swell the heart with honest pride. No wonder you are fond of
it, Mary; no wonder you would make any sacrifice to retain possession of it.
But the price is too heavy. To-morrow you must send Horace Mayfield about his
business."</p>
<p>"It is too late," Mary said coldly. "I have made up my mind. Other women
have made far heavier sacrifices than this. And I shall get used to it."</p>
<p>"Never! You are not going to do it. I will not permit you to commit this
sin."</p>
<p>The girl's face blazed with anger, then her cheeks grew white again. She
would have liked to turn upon Ralph with passionate scorn, but her sense of
truth and justice held her back. For what he said she knew to be dreadfully,
hopelessly true.</p>
<p>"Yes, a sin," Ralph said quietly. "The deliberate violation of a sacrament.
You will go to the altar with a lie on your lips, your whole life will be a
lie. To my mind, one of the most horrible things is the sight of a young girl
who has married an old man for the sake of his money. To me it is hideous. And
your sin will be worse than that, far worse. Picture it, think of it, Mary,
before it is too late."</p>
<p>The girl's head drooped, in spite of her pride and her courage, the tears
streamed down her face, her frame was shaken by passionate sobs.</p>
<p>"Too late," she said. "Oh, I cannot draw back."</p>
<p>"Because you sacrifice everything to your foolish pride," Ralph replied. "I
see that it is quite useless for me to plead any longer. Therefore, I must take
my own way to prevent your wasting your life in this fashion. Would Horace
Mayfield care for you if he heard that you had lost your fortune?"</p>
<p>"The question is needless," Mary whispered. "Of course he wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Let us argue the matter out from that point of view, then. Say that a
merciful Providence interferes to prevent this sin of yours. You lose your
fortune. Mind, there are many less likely things than this. Your fortune takes
wings and flies away. You are free from Mayfield, and also you lose the Hall.
What would you do then?"</p>
<p>"But you are picturing an almost impossible case. Such a thing is not the
least likely."</p>
<p>"Indeed, it is. The late heir to the estate vanished and never returned.
There was a violent quarrel, the facts of which are only known to Lady
Dashwood. Her son died far away without even communicating with his relatives
again. So far as we know, he may have left a son behind him. He may have told
that son everything or nothing. But suppose that son finds out the truth. What
is to prevent his coming back and claiming everything? He would get the title
as a matter of course; he would get the estates also if he puts in an
appearance before another six months have gone by. If this happens, you are no
better than a pauper, Mary. What do you say to that?"</p>
<p>"I do not believe in the existence of the man."</p>
<p>"No, but I do. Mary, that young man lives. He will declare himself and bring
in his proofs before many days are over. He is the instrument chosen by
Providence to prevent this deliberate sin of yours. Your reign at Dashwood is
over; within a few days you will be as poor as&mdash;as myself. Thank God, we
shall save you yet."</p>
<p>A little cry came from the girl's lips and she stood like a white statue in
the moonlight.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;MORAL FORCE</h2>
<p>It was some time before Mary spoke again. Ralph wondered if she had any
inkling of the real truth. He had perhaps said a little too much, and perhaps,
on the other hand, he had not said quite enough. Suppose that Mary jumped to
the immediate conclusion that he was the heir. What then? She would ask him the
question point blank, and he would be compelled to speak the truth.</p>
<p>But Mary's perception was at fault for once. As her eyes sought Ralph's face
it was evident that she had not the remotest idea who he was. And this was just
as it should be, from Ralph's point of view.</p>
<p>For he was doing what the world would call a foolish and Quixotic thing. He
loved this girl with his whole heart and soul; he knew that she was the one
woman for him. But not yet; until that sinful pride was humbled in the dust
there would be no happiness for Mary. Her character would have to be cleansed
and purified in the fire of adversity first. Ralph knew quite well what noble
qualities lay under that mask of pride and ice.</p>
<p>He could have called the girl his; he knew it. He had only to proclaim his
identity, and Mary Dashwood would have asked no better fate than to become the
wife of the head of the family; she might have given her heart into the
bargain.</p>
<p>But Ralph would have none of it that way. Mary should come to him and sue
for pardon; she should proclaim in all sincerity that love was best of all. She
should feel that there was something far better than being mistress of Dashwood
Hall. Then the truth might be told and the old order of things
re-established.</p>
<p>All this Ralph had worked out in his mind as a novelist works out a plot.
And Fate had played into his hands. A stern, hard time was coming for Mary, but
it would be the making of her in the end. Ralph could see it all in his mind's
eye as he stood by Mary's side and looked into her troubled eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," she said slowly. "I am afraid that I am not so hard
and resolute as I believed myself to be. And things have moved so rapidly
lately, that I am dazed. First comes the knowledge that my father
is&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>
<p>The girl hesitated and broke down. Ralph completed her sentence for her. It
sounded harsh and unkind, but the lesson had to be learned.</p>
<p>"Is not the man you took him for," Ralph said. "His family pride is not a
durable article. To play his part properly he should have coldly and politely
told Mayfield to do his worst, and ordered him out of the house. That is the
course one has a right to expect from the head of the house of Dashwood. But,
alas, for the weakness of poor human nature! Your father knows Mayfield to be
an abandoned scoundrel, and yet he makes a compact with him. A bargain is
arranged between them, and you are the price to be paid, Mary. And, upon my
word, your pride seems to me to be as hollow a thing as that of your
father."</p>
<p>"That is false," Mary cried passionately. "I am sacrificing everything for
the honour of the house."</p>
<p>"Not from my point of view. As I said before, you are committing a great and
deadly sin with your eyes open. At the altar you are prepared to soil your lips
with a horrible perjury. You are going to promise to love, honour, and obey the
man whose very presence makes you shudder. But, fortunately, there is no need
for that. To all practical purposes you have ceased to be mistress of Dashwood,
and when Mayfield knows this, he will dismiss you as a mere incident in his
career. The new heir will take possession of the title and the property."</p>
<p>"I am glad we have got back to him again," Mary said coldly. "Your personal
remarks are exceedingly distasteful to me. Who is the man you speak of?"</p>
<p>"Vincent Dashwood. Did you not guess it before? Has it never occurred to you
that he had some powerful motive that kept him here all this time? You must be
aware how Lady Dashwood dislikes him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes. Several times lately I have asked who the man was, but I
could not succeed in getting a satisfactory reply. I knew that Lady Dashwood
was afraid of the man. He is not a bit like a gentleman, but seeing that he was
a Dashwood, I have always been more or less civil to him."</p>
<p>"He does not think so," Ralph said with a smile. "In fact, he thinks that
you have treated him very distantly and haughtily. He hinted to me that he was
going to make you pay for it later. Still, a most objectionable creature."</p>
<p>"I seem to be surrounded with them lately," Mary said bitterly. "But why all
this mystery and secrecy? If the man is the person he claims to be, why did he
not make his identity known long ago? Oh, he is an impostor, defrauding Lady
Dashwood. So long as he can get money out of her he will do nothing."</p>
<p>"Perhaps Lady Dashwood will enlighten us on that point," Ralph said. "I may
say that in California I knew the late Ralph Dashwood very well. Had I not done
so, I should not have been here on private business to-day&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then you know if the late heir to the property had a son?" Mary
interrupted.</p>
<p>"Certainly he did. And Vincent Dashwood claims to be Ralph's son. If he can
prove this, then he takes the estates and the title. I have talked the matter
over with him, and I gather that he is waiting for one particular document
before claiming the property. The document is his mother's marriage
certificate. You may say that that is easy to obtain. Not so in California,
where records of that class are not kept so rigidly as they are here. Lady
Dashwood will tell you that the young man came with the strongest proofs of his
identity, letters that she had written to her son, and other papers of that
kind. He knows all the secrets of the House. Lady Dashwood never catches him
tripping."</p>
<p>"Very strange!" Mary said. "And yet he makes no claim!"</p>
<p>"For the reason that I told you. He led me to understand that he is loth to
disturb existing arrangements during the lifetime of her ladyship. On the
whole, I regard this as an exceedingly fortunate business for you!"</p>
<p>"Fortunate?" Mary exclaimed. "An incident that renders my father and myself
penniless!"</p>
<p>"Yes. It prevents you becoming the wife of Horace Mayfield. Directly he
hears of this thing he will turn his back on you for ever. He is too much a man
of the world to waste time in idle regrets; he will look out for another to
take your place. On the whole, it seems to me that Fate has been very kind to
you."</p>
<p>"Indeed." Mary's voice was very cold, her face colder still. "You seem to be
glad."</p>
<p>"I am glad. I am rejoiced to find that Providence is not going to allow you
to wreck your happiness and imperil your future in this way. Nothing could
please me better than to see you dependent upon your own exertions for a
living. You will be all the better for it; it will cleanse and purify you. And
then you will discover that the best thing in the world for a good woman is a
good man's love. It is my love for you, Mary, that makes me take this view of
things, that impels me to rejoice in the fact that you are nearer to me
to-night than you have ever been before. And some day you will own it."</p>
<p>"Never!" Mary cried passionately. "Oh, you make me hate you, you make me
forget how much I owe you. I could never become your wife."</p>
<p>Ralph smiled. There was something very soothing in the sweetness of the
night. Many a time afterward that scene rose up before his mind.</p>
<p>"You shall be my wife," he said in tones of quiet power. "The scales will
fall from your eyes and you will ask me to forgive you. Oh, my dear, I know the
beauty of your true nature better than you know it yourself. I can see it all
before me as clearly as if I were endowed with the gift of prophecy. We all
have our lesson to learn, and it is no fault of yours that the lesson has come
so late. And when my confession has followed yours, we shall know the meaning
of true happiness, but not before."</p>
<p>As if he had said the final word, Ralph turned in the direction of the
house. A world of passionate scorn, defiance, anger trembled on Mary's parted
lips. How dare this man, how dare any man, talk to her like this? And yet at
the same time the girl was fully aware of the power and masterful purpose
behind Ralph's words. She was glad in her inmost heart to know that he cared
for her so much. After all, Mary had her dreams of love and romance like other
girls. She was dimly conscious of the sweet and tender womanhood that underlay
her pride and ice. And she knew that no scorn or invective could turn Ralph
from his purpose.</p>
<p>"Very well," she said resignedly. "You are a strong man, and I am a weak
woman. I daresay you imagine yourself to be paying me a compliment. But I
should put that dream aside if I were you, for it is never likely to come
true."</p>
<p>"It is no dream," Ralph smiled. "Nor is the happiness so very far off. Now
let me take you back to the house again, for it is getting late."</p>
<p>As Mary slipped her hand under the proffered arm, a gentle sigh escaped her.
She wondered why she could not be angry with this man, why every word of his
thrilled her and filled her with such happiness as could not be expressed in
words.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;STRATEGY</h2>
<p>Meanwhile the police were pushing on their investigations into the causes
leading up to the fire at Dashwood Hall with great energy. The clue of the
match-box was held to be an important one, and now that the owner of the toy
had been discovered, important developments were expected. In the interim,
Vincent Dashwood returned from London, having forgotten all about his loss. It
was brought back to his mind with unpleasant force after luncheon the following
day by a visit from the inspector of police.</p>
<p>Dashwood was lounging at the table, smoking a cigarette. Lady Dashwood sat
opposite to him, her slim hands folded in her lap. She was looking white and
worn; her eyes seemed to seek her companion in weary misery.</p>
<p>"I don't see what you have to complain of," Dashwood was saying. "I've done
everything to please you. Here I am, a kind of mystery in the house, living
more or less on your bounty, whilst all the time I might have been Sir Vincent
Dashwood, with a fine property behind me. And any time I want a few pounds you
grumble."</p>
<p>"That is not a true statement of the case," Lady Dashwood said in her
resigned way. "You told me you could do nothing till you received the
certificate of your father's marriage. As to the rest, I accepted you
implicitely as my grandson. After the proofs that you placed in my hands, I had
no alternative."</p>
<p>"Much as you would have liked one," Dashwood sneered.</p>
<p>"Yes, if you will force me to speak plainly. Many a time I have prayed that
a child of my son's should be sent to me. But you are not in the least like
your father. He was wild and headstrong, and he never forgave the shameful way
we treated him, but he was a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Meaning that I'm not one, eh? Well, hard words break no bones. For the sake
of peace and quietness, I've kept my claim from everybody but you; to please
you I have suppressed the truth till I can get that certificate. And in return
you promised me that I should not suffer. And now you refuse me a paltry
&pound;500."</p>
<p>"I have not refused it you. I have not the money. And you have had all my
jewels, jewels valued at nearly &pound;30,000. In my weakness and folly I
parted with the property which does not belong to me. &pound;30,000 in the
space of a year! Where has the money gone?"</p>
<p>"Now if that isn't just like a woman," Dashwood growled. "I daresay those
stones were valued at the sum you mention, but to get that for them is a
different matter. To be candid, I pawned your gems for less than a third of
that money. And when I tried to raise a further loan on the same security, I
was met with a pointblank refusal. So you see, I have not been so very
extravagant after all."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood sighed bitterly. She was getting used to vulgar scenes like
this. And yet there was hope that before long she would be freed from the
bloodsucker. She watched him now as he sat sprawling in his chair, flicking the
ashes of his cigarette into a priceless Sevres dessert dish. How could she ever
have taken him for her grandson, she wondered? Why had she been so weak and
feeble?</p>
<p>A servant entered at the same moment with an intimation to the effect that
somebody desired to see Mr. Dashwood. The gentleman was waiting in the
dining-room. A dull flush of annoyance came over Dashwood's face.</p>
<p>"Some meddling creditor," he muttered. "A London tradesman, who has managed
to get my address from somewhere. Good-bye to all peace if once my retreat has
got known. Tell the man to call again, Charles. I can't see him."</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, sir," the footman said respectfully, "it is not a
tradesman, and he said he must see you on the most important business. The
gentleman is Inspector Drake, the head constable from Longtown."</p>
<p>Dashwood's teeth clicked together; his face turned to a dull ashen hue. He
had been suddenly stricken by some mortal fear; he could not disguise the fact
from Lady Dashwood. Her heart sank within her as she glanced fearfully at the
white set face on the other side of the table. She wondered what new disgrace
was here.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I'll come in a minute," Dashwood muttered thickly. "This room is so
hot that it makes one feel quite faint. Charles, give me a glass of brandy from
the sideboard. A large glass without water. Ah!"</p>
<p>The white face resumed a little of its colour and the teeth ceased to
chatter as the potent spirit got in its work. With an uneasy swagger, Dashwood
crossed over to the door, but his heart was beating thick and fast and there
was a great lump in his throat that he could not quite succeed in swallowing.
But the inspector of police knew nothing of this as he responded curtly enough
to Dashwood's insolent salutation.</p>
<p>"And what can I do for you?" the latter asked. "This is a very inconvenient
hour for me."</p>
<p>"Very sorry for that, sir," the official said coolly. "But my duty is plain.
I should like to have a few words with you as to the fire at Dashwood
Hall."</p>
<p>A strange sense of relief, almost of exultation, came over the listener. He
could breathe more freely now; all his swagger came back to him. The visit of
the officer had nothing to do with any episode out of a dark and dubious
past.</p>
<p>"What can I tell you about that?" he asked. "I know nothing of it."</p>
<p>"Well, it's like this, sir," Drake proceeded to explain. "We have
established beyond all shadow of a doubt that the fire was not caused by
accident. Straw was laid deliberately on the floor of the hall, and as
deliberately soaked in petroleum. We found the rest of the straw, and also we
found the empty drum of oil, which had been taken from one of the outhouses.
All this must have happened in the early hours of the morning. It was a very
good thing that the timbers of the house are so sound, or nothing could have
saved the place. As it is, the fire burnt itself out."</p>
<p>"But what has all this got to do with me?" Dashwood asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Half a minute, sir. I was merely telling you that this was the work of an
incendiary. Once having established the fact, we will get to business. We
searched in the ashes, and we were so fortunate as to find this."</p>
<p>Drake held up the familiar match-box and handed it to Dashwood. He looked
just a little uneasy, but there was no suggestion of guilt about him.</p>
<p>"We found this peculiar match-box in the straw, sir," Drake went on. "The
theory is that it was dropped by somebody who was connected with the fire.
Suppose that the culprit was disturbed, or perhaps the sudden blaze was so
fierce that the box fell and could not be recovered. I want to know if you have
seen this box before?"</p>
<p>Dashwood turned the silver toy over in his hands for a moment. There was
nothing to be gained by concealing the truth.</p>
<p>"I understand your insinuation," he said. "As a matter of fact, that box
belongs to me, and, as I dare say you are aware, my initials are engraved upon
it. The box is a novelty in its way; I bought it some years ago in America. Do
you mean to say that this was found in the ashes of the fire?"</p>
<p>"It was, sir. I picked it up myself. The butler, Slight, recognised it as
belonging to you. Now you will see why I came to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course. So your beautiful intelligence suggests that I had some hand
in that fire. If you only knew the true position of affairs, you would know
that I am the very last person in the world to want anything to happen to the
Hall. But that is a detail which we may come to presently. Meanwhile, I am
prepared to accept the responsibility of calling myself the owner of the box. I
must have been careless enough to drop it and somebody picked it up&mdash;the
somebody who tried to set fire to the Hall. I'm afraid that I can't tell you
any more than that."</p>
<p>"All the same, I'm afraid I must go a little farther, sir," Drake said.
"That box is yours and it was found in the ashes of the fire. It appears that
some time before the fire broke out one of the servants at the Hall was called
up to take a message to Mr. Mayfield, who is staying in a farmhouse not far
from here. The servant's name is Walters. He went back to his quarters over the
stables, and as it was a fine night and he did not feel in the least sleepy, he
sat by the open window and smoked a cigarette. He says that a little before
two&mdash;close to the time when the fire broke out&mdash;he saw somebody come
from the direction of the house and cross the lawn. The figure was moving
rapidly, and apparently desired to escape observation. When Walters was asked
if he could recognise the figure in question, he said positively that he could.
I asked him to give it a name, and, to make a long story short, he said it was
you, sir."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the dry suggestiveness in Drake's manner. He was not
in the least apologetic now, he made his statement with the air of a man who is
sure of his ground. Dashwood changed colour slightly.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous," he cried. "The idea that I should have any motive for
destroying the old house is out of the question. If you knew who I really
am&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is not the point, sir. The question is were you there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I was," Dashwood said in a kind of sullen desperation. "I was out at
that hour. The best thing I can do is to come as far as the Hall and have it
out with Walters. I see that the time has come when I must tell the truth."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-30" id="ch-30"></a>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE</h2>
<p>Sir George Dashwood sat in the Gothic library at Dashwood Hall bewailing his
hard fate in a manner which would have been called peevish in a less
distinguished man. He wanted to know when he was going to get back the full
possession of his house again; he desired to be informed why Horace Mayfield
had not been to see him. He did not appear to be listening to what Mary had to
say. Also he was full of the fact that the more or less mysterious Vincent
Dashwood had made a dastardly attempt to reduce the old house to ashes.</p>
<p>"You don't seem to understand," Mary said with some impatience. She was
standing in the window of the library with the sunshine full on her face.
Through the great mullion, with its crested devices, she could see the deer in
the park beyond. "You do not seem to comprehend that this is a blessing in
disguise. So far as I can see, the house is not a bit the worse for what might
have been a terrible disaster. I am bound to confess that I don't like Mr.
Dashwood, but at the same time I am quite sure that he had nothing to do with
the fire&mdash;the fire which prevented anybody from knowing of the disgrace
that had fallen upon us."</p>
<p>"No thanks to that young man," Sir George grumbled. "I tell you he was
responsible for the fire. His match-box was found there. Walters saw him by the
house. Why Lady Dashwood doesn't get rid of the fellow passes my
comprehension."</p>
<p>"But I have just been trying to explain to you, only you won't listen," Mary
responded with some show of impatience. "There are the most powerful reasons
why Mr. Vincent Dashwood does not desire the destruction of the house. Mr.
Darnley told me all about it last night. Vincent Dashwood claims to be the son
of Ralph Dashwood."</p>
<p>Sir George started as if something had stung him. He had been so wrapped up
in his own selfishness up to now that he had no ears for anything else. Mary's
statement almost overpowered him. Many things suddenly became plain to the
baronet's understanding.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet and paced up and down the room in terrible
agitation.</p>
<p>"Is this really a fact?" he demanded. "I cannot believe it, and yet, and
yet, I have met that fellow a good many times, and the oftener I see him, the
more does he impress me unfavourably. I see now that there must have been some
powerful reason why Lady Dashwood should tolerate the man. But why did she not
tell us at once, why did she go on feeding him with money? for I can now quite
see why she was not in a position to do me a favour the other night. If what
you say is correct, Mary, then we are little better than beggars. Still, the
reason for all this mystery&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is not so strange when one comes to understand, father. It appears that
Ralph Dashwood married an American lady somewhere in the wildest part of
California. There has been a great difficulty in finding the marriage
certificate. Lady Dashwood is quite convinced that the man we are speaking of
is her grandson."</p>
<p>Sir George broke out into feeble whinings, he grew almost tearful. And as he
became weak and sentimental, so did Mary grow harder. If this crowning blow had
to fall, then nobody should hear a word of weakness from her. For her part she
could have fought this man, even if it had left her penniless before the world.
She clenched her teeth upon her lip to keep down the rising tide of bitter
reproaches. Then she turned to see that Vincent Dashwood, together with
Inspector Drake, had entered the room. The former looked heated and indignant,
for he had been giving a piece of his mind to the policeman.</p>
<p>"I am glad to find you here, Sir George," he shouted. "The police are making
all kinds of accusations against me. They say, forsooth, that I have tried to
burn the house down, and all because a match-box of mine was found in the
ashes. I suppose I am not the first man in the world who has lost a match-box.
And I've been telling Drake here that I have every reason that the house should
not be injured."</p>
<p>"So my daughter informs me," Sir George replied in the same whining voice.
"Seeing that you claim to be the son of Ralph Dashwood&mdash;"</p>
<p>The other man laughed defiantly. All the same he could not meet the glance
that Mary turned upon him. His bold eyes were turned to her face, then they
dropped as if looking for something on the floor.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry," Drake put in, "but this is a serious matter. The finding
of that box, the mere fact that Mr. Dashwood was seen here at the hour of the
fire, all make it necessary for me to take certain steps&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I must speak," Vincent Dashwood broke out. "I did not mean to proclaim the
truth, because I was not ready to do so. And there was Lady Dashwood to be
considered. Still, as I see that Mr. Drake is prepared to go to the extreme
length of arresting me for the alleged act of arson, I am compelled to declare
the truth for my own protection. Drake tells me that he has lived in the
adjacent town of Longtown all his life, so he must be more or less acquainted
with the family of Dashwood. He knows, for instance, that Mr. Ralph Dashwood
left here forty years ago, and that his friends have seen nothing of him since.
I suppose that statement is not too much for your intelligence, Drake?"</p>
<p>"I am quite aware that you are quoting facts, sir," Drake said grimly.</p>
<p>"Very well. I'm glad to hear that you believe something I say. It is not
generally known, but it will be clearly established before long that Mr. Ralph
Dashwood married an American lady, by whom he had one child, a son. To go
farther, I may say that that son now stands before you. I am the only son of
Ralph Dashwood, born in lawful wedlock, as Lady Dashwood perfectly well knows,
and therefore the property belongs to me. There is no such person really as Sir
George Dashwood; as a matter of fact, Sir Vincent Dashwood&mdash;in other
words, myself&mdash;is head of the family and owner of the place. There is only
one proof necessary, and that I hope to have in my hands in a few days. I
allude to the certificate of my parents' wedding. And now, Mr. Drake, after
hearing all this, can you suggest that I should gain anything by burning this
house down? If I had had an impulse in that direction, I could easily have
waited for an opportunity of committing that folly in a safer fashion."</p>
<p>Drake was bound to admit that the astounding revelations made all the
difference in the complexion of the case. Sir George Dashwood listened with a
dark look on his face. Mary turned to the door to see that Ralph Darnley was
standing there. The mere knowledge of his presence seemed to support and
comfort her in this trying hour. Yet she did not feel the poignant sorrow and
sense of loss as keenly as she should.</p>
<p>"Mr. Darnley will tell us if this is true," she cried.</p>
<p>"Lady Dashwood will tell you so, at any rate," Ralph responded. "I have
taken the liberty of listening to what this gentleman had to say. It so happens
that I can throw considerable light on the story. As I told you last night, I
knew the late Ralph Dashwood very well, though I had not the honour of meeting
the man who claims to be his son. Perhaps Mr. Dashwood will reply to a few of
my questions. Will he tell me, for instance, in what part of California his
mother lived?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I will," Vincent Dashwood replied without the slightest
hesitation. "It was in Jackson County; I understand the town was
Courville."</p>
<p>"I should say that is perfectly correct," Ralph said. "In fact, I have every
reason to know that it is correct. And the name of your mother?"</p>
<p>"Alice Montrose. But where the wedding took place, I can't say just
now."</p>
<p>"That is also correct," Ralph went on in the same solemn way. "I am in a
position to prove that Alice Montrose was the wife of Ralph Dashwood. It is the
legal verification of the marriage that you seek?"</p>
<p>"That's it," Dashwood cried eagerly. "Once that is in my possession, the
rest is easy. As I said before, I did not desire to proclaim my identity just
yet for several reasons. But I have been compelled to speak for the sake of my
honour. And if you, Mr. Darnley, who seem to know so much, can help me to
discover that particular document, I shall be eternally grateful to you.
Anything that I can do for you by way of reward&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I shall make use of you, no doubt," Ralph replied. "Your claim appears to
be a very strong one, and everything is going in your favour. So far all you
say as to the marriage of Ralph Dashwood and Alice Montrose has been correct.
You are in urgent need of the certificate. Let me make the dramatic situation
complete by presenting you with the paper that you most desire. If you will
look at this long slip of paper, you will see that it is a copy, certified, of
the marriage in question. As you seem to be the person most entitled to the
paper, it is with pleasure that I place it in your hands."</p>
<p>Vincent Dashwood's face turned from grey to red, and then to deadly white.
Then he suddenly burst out into a hoarse whoop of triumph and he danced round
the room with every manifestation of extravagant joy. He would have shaken
hands with Ralph, only the latter did not seem to see the trembling moist palm
extended to him.</p>
<p>"Is this real?" Sir George groaned, "or is it all some hideous dream?"</p>
<p>"It is real enough," Ralph said. "It is a case of 'the King is dead, long
live the King.' Pray allow me to offer you my congratulations, Sir
Vincent."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-31" id="ch-31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;UNDER WHICH LORD?</h2>
<p>Vincent Dashwood seemed to expand, he stood there smiling benignly, he had
lost his strange uneasiness of manner altogether. And yet Mary did not fail to
notice the furtive look in his eyes. There must be something wrong here, she
thought; it was impossible to regard this man as the head of the family. For
three hundred years Dashwood had been ruled by a gentleman, a man of
honour.</p>
<p>And this smirking creature, with the red, grinning face and cunning eyes,
was neither. Mary knew him to be little better than a blackmailer. And if he
was the person he claimed to be, why had he not come forward and proclaimed his
identity before? She could not believe that Vincent Dashwood had hidden his
light under a bushel merely because he was short of one particular
document.</p>
<p>The girl did not believe that he would have spoken now had not the awkward
incident of the match-box compelled him to do so. And here was Ralph Darnley
actually pushing forward the cause of the new claimant and giving him the one
proof that he needed.</p>
<p>And yet the thing was impossible; surely the walls of the house would
collapse about the head of so poor a ruler as Vincent Dashwood. The old
familiar objects around Mary filled her with a kind of dumb pain. She was going
to lose them all&mdash;the pictures and the gardens, the horses in the stables,
and the very deer that loved her. What the future held for her, Mary had not
considered. She brought herself back to the present with an effort; she became
aware that Vincent Dashwood was speaking.</p>
<p>"This&mdash;this is really extraordinary," he cackled. "Like a scene from a
play. I had my own good reasons for not proclaiming my identity for the
present, but you all see that circumstances have been too strong for me. And
then at the critical moment Mr. Darnley comes along with that paper. How it
came into his possession&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is easily explained," Ralph said in his grave way. "It was given to me
by Mr. Ralph Dashwood in circumstances that I need not go into here. Primarily,
the certificate was to have been forwarded to the solicitors of this
estate."</p>
<p>"Quite so, quite so," Dashwood said loftily. "Really, it doesn't matter. The
point is that my proofs are now complete. My idea was to do nothing and say
nothing till Lady Dashwood&mdash;my grandmother&mdash;had become resigned to
the change in the condition of affairs. It is perhaps natural that the good
lady should look coldly on me and that all her affection should be for Mary
here. And I am bound to say that Mary has not treated me with the friendliness
that I could have wished."</p>
<p>Hot words rose to the girl's lips, but she checked herself with an effort.
Doubtless the new heir was doing his best to be agreeable, perhaps he did not
know how offensive he was.</p>
<p>"But I am not going to be vindictive," he resumed. "It is only natural that
you should feel a little sore and hurt. One doesn't turn out of a snug crib
like this without turning a hair. As a matter of fact, there is no reason why
you should go at all, at least, not for some time to come. I don't suppose I
shall ever marry&mdash;I'm not that kind of chap. There is no reason why Mary
and the old gentleman and myself shouldn't be very snug here together. Mr.
Dashwood wants little more than the run of his teeth at his time of life."</p>
<p>Mary's cheeks flamed at the unconscious humiliation. She was being offered a
home as a pauper and a dependent; it was infinitely worse than going into a
workhouse. Mary had never dreamed of being humbled and crushed in the dust like
this. Before she could reply, Slight looked into the doorway, his dry, red face
screwed up into the semblance of respect. He announced Horace Mayfield in a
loud voice.</p>
<p>Mayfield came in, glass in eye, serene and self-confident, his hard mouth
looking more like a steel trap than ever. The quiet triumph in his eyes was not
lost on Mary; she did not fail to note the gleam of possession as he glanced at
her. There was cold consolation in the knowledge that after all Mayfield was
powerless to hold her soul and body in thraldom any longer.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," Mayfield said, "I seem to be intruding on a family
conference or something of that kind. Slight did not tell me, though I have
every reason to believe that he was listening outside the door. What are you
doing here?"</p>
<p>The question was flung headlong at Vincent Dashwood, who had started and
changed colour as Mayfield came in. Evidently these two knew one another, for
Mayfield was rudely contemptuous, Dashwood cringing yet defiant. Was there yet
another vulgar mystery here? Mary wondered wearily.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better explain," Ralph said. "This, Mr. Mayfield, is an
unexpected, but nevertheless dramatic situation. Let me present you to Sir
Vincent Dashwood, only son and heir of the late Ralph Dashwood, who died some
time ago. Sir Vincent had some natural hesitation in declaring his identity; he
was loth to upset existing arrangements. We must all respect proper feeling of
that kind. One reason Sir Vincent had for keeping his personality a secret was
the fact that he lacked the legal proof of his parent's marriage. By a
fortunate chance I was able to supply the omission. Still, we need not go into
that. The fact remains that Sir Vincent has now established his claim, as the
family solicitors will admit without unnecessary delay. Unhappily, this new
condition of affairs makes it very awkward for Sir George&mdash;I mean, Mr.
George Dashwood. By this cruel stroke he finds himself practically a pauper.
And on Miss Dashwood the blow falls with the same heavy weight. The heiress
becomes dependent upon the charity of the head of the family."</p>
<p>As Ralph spoke his eyes were fixed on Mayfield's. He was searching keenly
for any sign of anger or emotion. But Mayfield did not betray himself. There
was a red spark in his eyes and the big veins stood on his forehead, but
nothing further. And as Ralph proceeded a faint smile grew at the corners of
the cruel mouth.</p>
<p>"This is exceedingly interesting," he said, "and to think that Sir Vincent
should have kept this from so old a friend as myself."</p>
<p>There was mocking bitterness in the speech and Dashwood fairly writhed under
it. He seemed to hang in a kind of agony on the next word. His sigh of relief
as Mayfield turned from him was not lost on Mary. Mayfield turned abruptly to
the girl.</p>
<p>"This will make a great difference to you," he said. "For my own part, I am
disappointed at the strange turn of affairs. Still, I am philosophic enough to
take my chances. In reality I came here to say good-bye to you. I will not see
you for some time to come."</p>
<p>The whole thing was so cool, so icily audacious, that Mary had no words for
reply. This man had accepted the change in the situation with instant
readiness, there was not so much as a shade of regret in his voice. Mary had
gone out of the sphere of his affection, and he was prepared to drop her like
an old glove. The blood flamed into her face at this fresh humiliation; the
pride of the family was serving her badly now. Her trembling hands went out to
Ralph. He saw what was passing in her mind.</p>
<p>"Take me away from here," she whispered. "Take me out into the fresh air or
I shall die. What have I done to deserve this degradation? And get my father to
come, too. Has he lost all his manhood that he stays here?"</p>
<p>They went out into the sunshine and the air at length, and Dashwood was
alone with Mayfield. The latter closed the door and lighted a cigarette. There
was a grim ferocity in his eyes that caused Dashwood to turn sick.</p>
<p>"So you've done it, you rascal," Mayfield muttered. "I daresay you will tell
me that your hand was more or less forced. Perhaps it was. And yet if I raise
my little finger you will pass the next ten years of your life in gaol."</p>
<p>"Don't," Dashwood said with difficulty, "don't talk like that. The cards
were all of them literally forced on me. Why should you mind?"</p>
<p>"Why should I mind? Why, man alive, you have 'queered my pitch' as some of
your dissolute companions would say. I was going to marry Mary Dashwood, the
great heiress, everything was ready to my hand. A little later and the thing
would have been accomplished. Only one thing bothered me&mdash;I am at my wit's
ends for some ready money, which I must have before long. And, as things stand
at present, Mary Dashwood could not raise anything on her expectations. But I
was going to play the bold game and risk everything, even my liberty, on this
stake. I was never more surprised in my life than when that fellow Darnley
explained the situation. I nearly gave you away."</p>
<p>"I saw that," Dashwood said hoarsely, "my heart was in my mouth. It was very
good of you to remember an old pal who&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Old pal be hanged," Mayfield cried. "I'd have betrayed you fast enough had
it been to my interest to do so. I saw my game like a flash. They are going to
let you into the thing without a fight. But not for very long, my boy, so you
had better make the most of your time. As Sir Vincent Dashwood you are all
right, you can play ducks and drakes with the estate if you please; in fact,
you are going to start with a mortgage of &pound;50,000. That sum of money you
will pay over to me."</p>
<p>"What for?" Dashwood asked uneasily. "Why should I do it?"</p>
<p>"Call it what you like. Call it blackmail. But I'm going to have it all the
same."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-32" id="ch-32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;MUST THIS THING BE?</h2>
<p>Mr. George Dashwood staggered into the hall at the dower house with an
exaggeration of grief that filled Mary with contempt. The dethroned head of the
house seemed to have no thought for anything but himself. His eyes were filled
with tears, his voice was weak and tremulous with selfish emotion.</p>
<p>"This is dreadful," he moaned. "Really, I had expected something better at
your hands, Darnley. Still, I suppose you are merely here to fulfill a promise
to Ralph Dashwood. Most selfish of a man to keep in the background all these
years and then spring a mine on one like this. And here am I, at my time of
life, with nothing to fall back on, not even a pension, for I commuted mine
when I left the Service. Still, that young fellow did not behave at all badly.
Don't forget, my dear that he offered us the free use of the Hall for the
present, at any rate. And he said that he was not a marrying man. Well, if you
play your cards properly, Mary&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mary turned her face away and hid her hot cheeks in a great bowl of dewy
roses standing on the hall table. It was no use, she could not keep the tears
back any longer. This was the crowning humiliation of an unspeakable day. For
her father to deal her this blow in the presence of the one man whose respect
she valued so highly was the refinement of cruelty. She rushed from the hall
with choking words to the effect that she must go and tell Lady Dashwood
everything.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with the girl now?" Dashwood asked peevishly. "Not one
word of sympathy has she uttered. Children have no feelings nowadays, Darnley.
I suppose she was angry about the new head of the house. What better
arrangement could be made? It would settle all the difficulties at once,
especially now Mayfield is out of the way. I thought that our young friend put
it very nicely."</p>
<p>"Did you?" Ralph responded coldly. "I may not be a judge of these matters,
but I fail to see how you could accept that invitation. Of course, a few days'
residence at Dashwood to get your personal belongings together would be another
matter."</p>
<p>"But what am I to do?" Dashwood asked feebly. "I am an old man, I have been
accustomed to the best of everything all my lifetime, and here I am cut off
from all my pleasures and not a penny to call my own. I can't starve, my good
fellow, and I couldn't stay here with Lady Dashwood; she gets on my nerves
terribly. What am I to do? Really, I feel in absolute need of a cigar and glass
of champagne. It is not my habit to drink at this time of the day, but my
condition calls for it."</p>
<p>Dashwood crept away with many a sigh and groan, and Ralph was left to his
own by no means pleasant thoughts. He had deliberately struck the blow, and now
that it had fallen, he was inclined to be dismayed at the result. It was very
hard upon this feeble old man, it was very hard upon Mary, but Ralph steeled
himself for the fray. Things were going to be worse yet, the lily was going to
pine upon the stem. Still, it would never do now to become infirm of purpose,
let the consequences be ever so bad. Yet, if the worst came to the worst, it
would be easy to sweep away the whole network of intrigue and fraud by the
raising of a finger. It was necessary that Mary should learn her lesson to the
last letter. That the girl would fight hard against her misfortunes Ralph did
not need to be told. That she would refuse to eat the bread of charity at
another person's expense he was perfectly sure. He was still debating the
problem when Mary entered the hall again. Her face was very white; there were
dark rings under her blue eyes, which were now swollen with tears. The girl
flushed as she saw the sympathy in Ralph's face.</p>
<p>"Do not think me weak," she pleaded. "I am finding out that I am only human
after all. I have always despised tears, but the pain at my heart was so great
that tears brought the only cure for it. But I did not come here to talk about
myself. I have been telling Lady Dashwood everything, and she has expressed a
desire to see you. What have you done with my father?"</p>
<p>"He has gone to the dining-room. He declared that exhausted nature required
a stimulant in the form of champagne. I am afraid that you will not find your
father much use to you in the dark hours to come, Mary."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Mary sighed, "but won't you go and see Lady Dashwood? She
is upstairs in her sitting-room. Of course, she is upset; in fact, she has been
saying all sorts of strange things which are beyond my comprehension. Why has
she taken such a strange fancy to you, I wonder?"</p>
<p>But Ralph did not appear to be listening. There was every prospect of a
painful interview before him. He passed up the stairs to the pleasant room
looking over the gardens which Lady Dashwood had made her own. She signed for
the door to be shut; as Ralph, came towards her, she advanced with both hands
outstretched.</p>
<p>"You will guess why I sent for you," she said. "Mary has been telling me
everything. So the man who calls himself Vincent Dashwood has made a bold move
at last!"</p>
<p>"He really didn't," Ralph smiled. "But had we not better sit down? My dear
grandmother, you are going to become a party to the conspiracy. Let us no
longer keep up the pretence of not knowing the relationship in which we stand
to each other."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood extended a shaking hand, and Ralph touched it with his
lips.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better make a full confession," he said. "I am your grandson.
I knew that you would recognise me by the likeness to my father. Old Slight did
so at once and very nearly betrayed me. I had forgotten Slight. I pledged him
to secrecy, I had nobody to fear but you, and it seemed to me that it was quite
easy to keep out of your way. But circumstances were too strong for me. Then I
saw that you were going to respect my wishes and I was safe. Forty years have
gone by since my father left the Hall, so that nobody was likely to guess my
identity."</p>
<p>"Yes, but who is this Vincent Dashwood?" Lady Dashwood asked. "Oh, I am not
quite so foolish over that man as you may think. He came here and declared
himself to me. He had the most absolute documentary evidence. He had many of
the letters which I had written to your father&mdash;letters to which I never
received any reply. Old Slight was more mistrustful, and submitted the claimant
to a rigid cross-examination. The man was not to be shaken in a single detail.
We were bound to accept his statements. But one proof was lacking, the
certificate of his parents' marriage. He desired to have his claim kept quiet
till that proof was forthcoming. This was after Mary and her father came into
possession. You can imagine my distress and grief, seeing that I loved Mary so,
and I hated the intruder in proportion. He preyed upon my weakness, he seemed
to read me like an open book. If you had not appeared, he would have gone on
blackmailing me till the end. But when that man came face to face with you, I
knew that he was an impostor, that he had never seen my son Ralph. And now he
has decided to play the bold game, seeing that nothing more is to be expected
from me."</p>
<p>"Not quite that," Ralph explained. "Fate played into my hands. The man was
more or less forced to disclose his identity. Let me tell you all about the
match-box...Now you see exactly how it is."</p>
<p>"But this is monstrous," Lady Dashwood cried, "you have only to speak and
the wicked scheme collapses. You will not let this go on, Ralph?"</p>
<p>"For the present, grandmother. For the present we are going to say nothing.
A little time before my father died he told me who I was. We had lost our
money, but that did not matter as my father was provided for here. When I came
to find out how the land lay, to my surprise I discovered that the only woman I
could ever care for was installed at the Hall as mistress. I had no idea that
this was going to happen when I met Mary two years ago in Paris. Her father had
not assumed the family name then. And when I came face to face with Mary and
held her in my arms, I knew that the old love was stronger than ever. And here
was a solution. Those people were occupying my place, the place that belonged
by birth to me, Sir Ralph Dashwood. If I had proclaimed and asked Mary to marry
me, she would have consented. She would have regarded it as her duty to do so.
But that is not the marriage of my dreams. Perhaps I am romantic: I want Mary
to marry me, me, plain Ralph Darnley, for love of me, and deem the family pride
well lost for a good man's affection. It is the living, breathing woman I want,
not the lovely mistress of that family who puts the pride of the Dashwoods in
front of everything else. Suffering and trouble and poverty shall be her
portion. She shall go out into the world and see what noble souls are there who
rise superior to fierce temptation though they have no family pride to boast
of. Then, when the scales have fallen from Mary's eyes, and she sees as I do,
then will I ask her to share my life with me. My dream is to come back here
with a bride who deems love and pity and sympathy to be far above the steady
sentiment that says, 'I am a Dashwood, and the rest are as dirt under my feet.'
You see what I mean, don't you? And that is why I am asking you to help me in
the matter. Let this little impostor strut his passing hours on the stage; let
him be our puppet. I shall know how to punish him when the time comes."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-33" id="ch-33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;A REBEL AGAINST
FATE</h2>
<p>Lady Dashwood smiled through her tears. She had eyes of affection for this
tall, handsome, earnest man who paced up and down the room now with the burning
words on his lips. He was moved to the very heart; it seemed to him that his
scheme was the only way. Lady Dashwood felt that she could hesitate no
longer.</p>
<p>"You are very eloquent, Ralph," she said, "and whatever the faults of your
scheme may be, you are terribly in earnest. It is not for me to stand in the
way. God knows the family pride that I did so much to foster has done harm
enough. It drove your father away from home, it came between me and my son and
my husband, and rendered all the best years of my life a blank and a
desolation. Some day, when I have the courage, I will tell you why your father
left home, and the shameful deceit that I put upon him. And all to save the
family dignity! And now Mary is as hard as I ever was. Still, the good that
lies in that girl of mine&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know it," Ralph cried. "Mary's is, in reality, a beautiful nature. But
the fires will go out one by one if the cinders are not cleared away, so that
by the time Mary comes to middle age she will be a cold and distant woman with
none to love her. This is why I have practically turned her out of house and
home. Her proper pride will not permit her to be dependent upon anyone; you may
offer her a home here, but she will never accept it. She will elect to go out
into the world and get her own living."</p>
<p>"Which she is not the least fitted to do, Ralph."</p>
<p>"Of course she isn't," Ralph exclaimed. "With all her courage and pride and
beauty, she has no equipment to battle with the world. And yet it is the best
thing that could happen to her. She will realise her own helplessness, she will
come to acknowledge that the typewriting girls and the shop assistants have
qualities and virtues that she does not possess. Oh, those lovely blue eyes
will come to see at last, the mind come to learn that there is dignity in
labour and cheerfulness in the struggle that put family pride to shame. And
then Mary will be the bride for me, the noblest and sweetest mistress that ever
yet ruled at Dashwood. You may laugh at me, grandmother, but that is my dream.
Wherever Mary is, I shall not be far off, she will have a friend in me."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood's tears were falling fast now. For the first time she fully
understood the breadth and beauty of Ralph's scheme. It seemed hard that the
misfortune should fall upon Mary, and yet it was all for the best. Still,
tradition and training are not to be put lightly aside, and the idea of Mary
taking her place with the working women of the county was a vision that caused
Lady Dashwood a pang.</p>
<p>"Let us hope that everything will turn out right," she murmured. "I will not
betray your secret, Ralph; I am an old woman, and you are a strong, masterful
man. Still, I shall be bound to offer Mary a home here, and I am afraid that I
shall be glad if she accepts it."</p>
<p>"She won't," Ralph said confidently, "she is too proud. Besides, after what
has happened, she could not stay so near to Dashwood Hall. Remember, she has
reigned there, she has looked for homage as naturally as a queen. She will go
away; probably she will try to obtain some occupation in London. Anyway, I will
see that she does not starve. And when the lesson is learned and the clouds
have cleared away&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ralph paused, there was a strange, tender thrill in his voice. Lady Dashwood
seemed to catch some of his enthusiasm, for a smile lighted her face.</p>
<p>"You are a clever lad, my dear," she said, "you are one of those who compel
Fate to work for them. Well, it shall be as you desire, so far as I am
concerned. And now let us go down and see what the others are doing."</p>
<p>Mary was nowhere to be seen, but Mr. Dashwood was in the library. He seemed
more calm and resigned now; he was reading a letter which appeared to give him
some satisfaction.</p>
<p>"From&mdash;from Sir Vincent," he said, getting the name out with some
difficulty. "I suppose we must call the young fellow by his proper title now.
Still, he will of course, have to satisfy the family solicitors first."</p>
<p>"I have one or two further proofs that will induce the family solicitors to
maintain a policy of silence," Ralph said. "The best thing to do is quietly to
accept the new situation. People will talk for a day or two, and then the
incident will be forgotten."</p>
<p>"I suppose so," Dashwood muttered. "Anyway, this is from&mdash;er&mdash;Sir
Vincent. I am bound to confess that it is not at all a bad letter. Between
ourselves, the fellow is by no means a gentleman. Still, that's not quite his
own fault, probably his mother was quite a common sort of person. I beg your
pardon, Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"We need not go into that," Ralph said hastily. "Sir Vincent has written to
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Really quite a nice letter. He has a suggestion to make. It appears that he
is by no means disposed to stay quietly here and live the life of a country
landlord. He does not care for sport to begin with, in fact, he dislikes a
rural life. And he seems to think that marriage is&mdash;is not good enough. He
therefore proposes that Mary and myself should look upon Dashwood as our
present home, that Mary should take her place as mistress there. Really, this
gets us out of a great difficulty. I have no money beyond a pittance of a
hundred or so a year, and Mary has nothing whatever. As a sensible girl, she
will accept this offer."</p>
<p>Ralph said nothing. It was not for him to persuade George Dashwood one way
or another. He rather despised the weak creature who had posed as the head of
the family. But Ralph could give a shrewd guess at Mary's answer.</p>
<p>Mary came back presently a little before tea-time. She had been over at the
Hall, she said, looking after certain belongings of her own. The trace of tears
was still on her face, but her small mouth had a steely purpose. She lay back
in her chair in the great hall, sipping her tea, and looking out into the
garden beyond. Ever and again there came a yearning look in her eyes. She said
nothing, and vouchsafed no information, when a footman brought her a telegram
presently. With a guilty air her father placed Vincent Dashwood's letter in her
hand.</p>
<p>"I want you to read that, my dear," he said blandly. "To my mind, it is an
admirable letter and the sentiments in it are beyond question; in fact, I may
admit that I was quite touched by it. The fellow is evidently a gentleman at
heart. I want you to read the letter carefully and send a reply on behalf of
both of us."</p>
<p>Dashwood spoke glibly enough, but he was obviously ill at ease. He seemed to
have lost all his dignity, his haggard face looked almost mean as he glanced
furtively at Mary as she read the letter through, very slowly. Her face grew
hard and bitter, though something like a contemptuous smile flickered over her
lips.</p>
<p>"This is generosity indeed," she said. "So the beggars are to be offered a
home, with board and lodging and perhaps wages. I am to be mistress of the
house where for two years I have had my own way, in a house where you have been
master. We are to humble our pride and take the place of the housekeeper and
steward, to be polite to a man whom, from the bottom of my heart, I loathe and
despise. Oh, the situation would be farcical but for the note of bitter tragedy
in it. So you want me to answer this letter. So far as I am concerned I answer
thus."</p>
<p>With fierce energy Mary tore the letter across and then across again, and
flung the fragments amongst the flowers on the great hearthstone.</p>
<p>"My dear," Dashwood protested, "really, Mary. Have you considered what you
are going to do, that you are practically penniless?"</p>
<p>"There is always a home for Mary and her father here," Lady Dashwood
murmured.</p>
<p>"That&mdash;that is very good of you," Dashwood stammered, "but I could not
think of putting you to so much inconvenience. Mary may do what she pleases,
but for my part I am going to accept the offer so kindly made by the
new&mdash;er&mdash;head of the family. I presume that Mary means to stay here
for the present, at any rate, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," Mary cried. She had risen to her feet, and was glaring from one to the
other of the little group with eyes filled with resolution. She was very pale,
her lips were trembling, but she contrived to keep her voice steady. "No, I
will not remain here, I will not stay anywhere to eat the bread of charity.
Dear Lady Dashwood, you will forgive me if I seem to be harsh or ungrateful
after all your loving kindness to me. But I have been troubled and humiliated
enough, and I could not stand any more of it. My father can do as he chooses:
if he likes to humble himself in this way it is no business of mine. But I am
going away to London; everything has been arranged. The telegram I had just now
confirms it. And I have got my belongings together. My plans are made, and it
only remains for me to say good-bye."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood rose hastily to her feet. She felt vaguely alarmed and
agitated, now that matters had come to this pass. She gripped Mary by the
hand.</p>
<p>"Going," she faltered, "going, and when and where? Oh, do nothing
hastily."</p>
<p>"There has been nothing hasty about it," Mary said as she kissed the
speaker. "Believe me, I am not doing anything that is rash. And as to the rest,
I am going very soon indeed. In fact I expect to sleep in London to-night."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-34" id="ch-34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;MISTRESS OF HERSELF</h2>
<p>It was all working out now exactly as Ralph had hoped and wished for. Never
had he admired Mary quite so much as he did at that moment. And yet his heart
smote him as he realised that after all there was something akin to harshness
in his action. Still, the case would have been very much the same had he
declared his identity and proclaimed the fact that he was the proper owner of
Dashwood Hall.</p>
<p>Mary would in that case have remained in much the same position, though the
situation would have perhaps lacked its present dramatic features. Mary stood
there with a proud look on her face; she was ready to meet the world and
conquer it single-handed. How many bright strong young lives had set forth with
the same cheerfulness and failed! Still, it was a step in the right direction,
Ralph thought.</p>
<p>"Had you not better give the thing further consideration?" he said. "In the
ways of the world you are little better than a child. Of your courage and
resolution there is no doubt. But there are other qualities needed to make a
living to-day. You must have a good knowledge of some business or
profession."</p>
<p>"I can paint," Mary said. "Many people have told me that I should have made
an artist if I had had to earn my own living."</p>
<p>Ralph nodded grimly. He had seen several of the girl's drawings. There was
no necessity to point out the vast difference between the best efforts of the
amateur and the finished work of the professional, tricks of the trade learned
frequently after years of bitter struggling.</p>
<p>It seemed a pity to discourage Mary at the outset of her career. And Ralph
was not anxious for the girl's success. He turned the situation over rapidly in
his mind.</p>
<p>"You can try," he said. "There is a friend of mine, the daughter of a once
famous general officer who gets her living by working for the cheap illustrated
papers. She has no great talent, but she manages to get a living. If you like,
I will write to her and ask her to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It will be too late," Mary cried, "I am going tonight. I could not stay
here a day longer after what has happened. The mere sight of the old house
brings the tears to my eyes and makes me feel weak and irresolute. I have
something like thirty pounds in money and a little jewellery. And my maid has
given me the address of a respectable woman who lets lodgings.</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall be happy enough when I am away from here and have plenty of
hard work to do. Only the other day I was reading a story about a girl, like
myself, who went to London and began to work for the magazines. It made a
different creature of her; for the first time in her life she was really
happy."</p>
<p>"She made a large income from the start," Ralph smiled, "and presently she
had a great hit with an Academy picture. Subsequently she married the
editor&mdash;proprietor of a popular paper&mdash;and he bought the old home for
her?"</p>
<p>"You have read the story?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"Indeed I haven't," Ralph replied. "There are so many stories like that that
I had no difficulty in imagining the plot. Oh, if you only knew how different
the real is from the ideal! Still, I would not dissuade you from your ambition
for a moment. It will do you all the good in the world. But you shall not go
alone."</p>
<p>Mary glanced haughtily at the speaker. There was an air of command, a
suggestion of possession, about the speech that the girl resented. Who was
Ralph Darnley that he should adopt this tone towards her? And at the same time
Mary knew that he was the one friend she had, if she did not count Lady
Dashwood.</p>
<p>It was a melancholy confession, but Mary had made no friends. For the most
part members of her own sex did not like her, she was too cold and
self-contained for them. She did not enter into their sentiments and pleasures.
It had not been the girl's own fault so much as the fault of her
environment.</p>
<p>And now she was going out into the world alone with a few pounds in her
possession, and with not a soul to give her a helping hand. There was something
very pathetic about it, Ralph thought. She knew so very little as to what lay
before her.</p>
<p>"I wish you would wait till to-morrow," he murmured.</p>
<p>"No," Mary said with a proud toss of her head. "It is not the slightest use
trying to break my resolution. I tell you I could not remain here, I could not
stay even with Lady Dashwood, knowing that my father was sponging on the good
nature of the man at the Hall. It seems a dreadful thing to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is a most improper observation to make," Dashwood said peevishly. "A
most impertinent remark to address to a father."</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," Mary said penitently, "it seemed the only word to use.
And it does hurt me so dreadfully to see how coolly you have cast your pride
aside. If you will come with me, father, I will work for both. We should at any
rate have the consolation of knowing that we have done nothing to sully the
name of Dashwood."</p>
<p>The girl spoke pleadingly, with a yearning tenderness in her voice that
Ralph had never heard before. He was rejoiced to see the lesson of adversity
working so soon. For his own part, he could not have resisted that seductive
invitation.</p>
<p>"Certainly not," Dashwood replied. "Nothing of the kind. I have no desire to
make the acquaintance of what people call apartments. I went to see a poor
friend of mine in apartments once. I saw his dinner. Good heavens! what a
repulsive mess it was. Served up by a red-headed maid-of-all-work, with a black
smudge on her face. No, no, I prefer the graceful hospitality of my
friend&mdash;er&mdash;Sir Vincent Dashwood."</p>
<p>Mary turned in the direction of the door as if the discussion were
closed.</p>
<p>"I am disappointed," she said. "But there is nothing to be gained by
standing here talking over my determination. I am going as far as the Hall to
say good-bye to some of the old servants, and hope to catch the 7.05 train to
London. As I said before, I know where to go when I reach my journey's
end."</p>
<p>Mary passed out into the peaceful sunshine of the garden. Lady Dashwood
looked imploringly at Ralph, who smiled in reply. From the bottom of his heart,
he was feeling for the girl, but he did not falter in his purpose. It was very
brave of Mary, but at the same time very pathetic. Ralph stole after the lonely
figure; he found her standing by the old sundial in the garden. Her fingers
were tracing idly over the quaint inscription on the stone. Ralph could see
that her eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do to help you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Mary whispered. "And you are the only friend I have,
besides Lady Dashwood. I have not the art of making friends: I never had
sympathy with the pastimes and pleasures of the ordinary girl of my class; I
did not feel lonely here, because it was so lovely a place. Dashwood Hall was
always sufficient for me. And now when I come to leave it, it breaks my heart
to go. You will laugh at me perhaps, but I have a strange feeling as if I had
the whole world to myself and that there was nobody else in it. It is as if
everybody had turned away from me. There was even something that hurt me to-day
in the way that Mr. Mayfield let me know that I was free as far as he was
concerned. I dread the thought of living by myself in London, the idea makes me
tremble. I, who have been so cold and proud, will have to approach people and
ask favours at their hands. I hope you understand me; it is dreadful when
nobody understands me."</p>
<p>Ralph made no reply for a moment, he was afraid to trust his own voice.</p>
<p>"You are a very woman," he said at length. "With your pride and your
coldness there are the same impulses and passions common to yourself and the
meanest of us. As to this pride of yours, I regard it as a hateful thing. What
is a Dashwood living on a fortune that none of you have ever earned, compared
with the man or woman who has risen superior to circumstances and made an
honoured name in the world? The girl who goes out and gets her own living, or
to support a widowed mother, is far superior to you. But I say these things
loving you with my whole heart and soul and being, and hope that some day I
shall call you my wife. I want to see all that harshness and coldness of yours
cast to the wind, I want to see your face sweet in sympathy with poor humanity.
But you are not going the lonely way as you seem to imagine. I am going to look
after you; I will not be far away. For the present my work is finished here,
and there are powerful calls that take me to London also in a day or two. You
will let me see you, Mary; you will let me bring you and my young artist friend
together?"</p>
<p>"I shall be glad indeed to see you," Mary cried, holding out her hand with
an impulse that she would have found it hard to account for. "Oh, I am not so
strong and self-reliant that I need nobody to confide in. The more my mind
dwells on the future, the more I seem to dread it. And you have been so good
and kind to me, I owe so much to you. I begin to see that there are gentlemen
in the world, though they boast of no pedigree, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, that is a good lesson learned," Ralph smiled. "Let me walk with you
as far as the Hall, for I have a telegram to send from the village. And then,
if you will allow me, I will return to the dower house with you. There are one
or two things that I have to say before you go."</p>
<p>Mary smiled through her tears; for a second her soul seemed to show in her
eyes.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-35" id="ch-35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;A FRIEND IN NEED</h2>
<p>It was a long telegram that Ralph despatched from the village, for he only
received a few pence out of the half-sovereign that he placed on the counter.
The operator sighed at the prodigious task before him. Then Ralph went off in
the direction of the Hall to wait for Mary in the park. It was some time before
she came; the children of the villagers passed on their way from school, and
presently Slight came along, with something like a frown on his rosy, wrinkled
little face. He eyed Ralph with marked disfavour.</p>
<p>"What's this about Miss Mary, Sir Ralph?" he asked. "Perhaps I shouldn't
have called you by that name. But Miss Mary has been up to the Hall to say
good-bye. She says she is going to London for good, and that she is not coming
back again. Going to try to get her own living, or some such foolishness."</p>
<p>"Your manner is not respectful, Slight," Ralph said coldly.</p>
<p>"I can't help it, sir," Slight replied. "Really, I can't. I love Miss Mary
as if she had been a child of my own. I taught her to ride, I taught
her&mdash;but there! If you only knew what a heart of gold she has! And now to
go and soil those pretty hands with work. And you could prevent it by holding
up your little finger. Thank God, there is no occasion for me to stay at the
Hall, for I've saved enough for my old age, though I don't deny that it will be
a wrench. And to-morrow the whole lot of us are going to hand in our
resignation in a body."</p>
<p>"Indeed, you are not going to do anything of the sort," Ralph said sternly.
"Don't let me hear any more of this folly. If you do go, you will not come back
again when this present head of the family has gone his way, which will be only
a matter of a few months at the outside. I look to you to stop the silly
action, Slight. I have given you my word before that this thing is not likely
to be permanent. And when you come to know everything, you will see how wisely
I have acted in the matter."</p>
<p>Slight's indignation cooled as quickly as it had heated. He scratched his
white head in some perplexity. And the look he turned upon Ralph was one of
fatherly affection.</p>
<p>"How like your father you do speak, sir," he said. "I suppose you must have
your own way as he used to. And if I hadn't been a wicked old rascal these
things would never have happened at all. My sin has found me out sorely."</p>
<p>"I am getting tired of this," Ralph said impatiently. "What sin are you
alluding to? And Lady Dashwood is always harping on the same string. What
wickedness were you two up to in the old days? What does it mean?"</p>
<p>"So her ladyship has not told you, sir?" Slight asked in a whisper. "She
never told you about the old Squire and your father's first wife Maria
Edgerton? She was the daughter of a farmer across the valley. The most
beautiful creature that I ever set eyes on. Well, well, to think that you
didn't know."</p>
<p>"I don't know," Ralph said. "My father never spoke of his first wife. And
yet I always felt that his love for her was the passion of his life. He was a
good husband to my mother, but still&mdash;and now you are going to tell me
that story, Slight."</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, sir, I'm not going to do anything of the kind," Slight
said shortly. "I couldn't dream of doing anything of the kind without her
ladyship's permission. You ask her, and she will tell you everything; indeed
you have the right to know. And don't you worry about the servants at the Hall,
because they will do exactly as I tell them. Make it as soon as you can, sir,
for the old place doesn't seem the same without the lovely face and the blue
eyes of Miss Mary looking after us. I'm an old man, and for over fifty years
I've served the Dashwoods faithfully, and it does seem rather hard to think
that I shall have to go on fawning and cringing to an impostor like the man who
calls himself Sir Vincent Dashwood. There won't be much of the fine old cellar
left if he stays here any time, I can tell you."</p>
<p>"Patience, Slight," Ralph replied. "It is only a matter of months. Here is
Miss Mary coming down the avenue. I shall look after her, I would not have one
hair of her head injured. And some day perhaps, Slight, if the fates are good
to me, you will be serving me as you served my grandfather, with Miss Mary as
mistress of Dashwood by my side. That is my desire, Slight, that is the one
great ambition of my life. And you can keep that secret with the rest."</p>
<p>Ralph turned away and joined Mary as she came down the avenue. She tried to
smile, but her lips were white and unsteady.</p>
<p>"That is finished," she said, with a brave attempt at cheerfulness. "It is
awful to think that I shall never see the dear old place again. But I am not
going to give way, I am going to show the world how a Dashwood can behave when
trouble comes."</p>
<p>The girl drew up her head with an air of pride, she never seemed quite to
forget what the family required of her. It was in moments like these that Ralph
loved her least. It was this very foolish self-consciousness that he desired to
conquer.</p>
<p>"It does not require a Dashwood to do that," he said. "Thousands of people
make these noble sacrifices every day, and take no credit to themselves for it.
When you get out into the world you will see another kind of pride and courage
and devotion that will put your fetish to shame. If I were to say that this is
the best thing that could happen to you, you would laugh the idea to scorn.
Nevertheless, it is absolutely true. What money have you?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps thirty pounds," Mary explained; "and certain articles of jewelery.
But I am not going to part with them like the girl in the story did."</p>
<p>Ralph felt by no means so sure of that, but he said nothing. He was very
silent till the dower house was reached, silent and a little guilty too, for he
it was who had brought this about. He was sending Mary into the world to battle
for her life alone. On the whole, he was not sorry that the girl had refused
Lady Dashwood's offer of a home; that was a specimen of the right kind of pride
at any rate. And yet, now that the hour of Mary's departure drew near, he
dreaded the parting. After all, the experiment was a cruel one, it was not yet
too late to save the situation.</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood was crying now; the dogcart stood by the great stone porch;
Dashwood fidgeted about in a half-shamed kind of way, yet frowning disapproval
of the whole business.</p>
<p>"Really, we are making a deal of fuss about nothing," he said. "Anybody
would think that Mary was being led away to instant execution, instead of
behaving in a way that makes me thoroughly ashamed of her. It is my clear duty
to exercise my parental authority. As it is I am not going to do anything of
the kind. Mary shall have her lesson. She will very soon get tired of playing
the part of the unattached female. She will be back in a week."</p>
<p>And this was Mary's farewell greeting as she drove away from the dower
house. She kept her face steady, and looked neither right nor left, not that
she could see anything, for her eyes were blinded with tears. Behind the tears,
one vision stood out bright and clear&mdash;the strong, reliant face of Ralph
Darnley, the warm pressure of whose grip still tingled on Mary's fingers. It
was good to know that she had one true friend.</p>
<p>The station was reached at last, and Mary was alone. She dismissed the
dogcart; she did not want the groom to see that she was going to travel third
class. It was rather a snobbish idea, and Mary despised herself for it
accordingly. The porter and the ticket officer looked astonished as Mary asked
the third-class fare to Victoria. How little things seemed to remind her of
what had been!</p>
<p>"I am going third," she said firmly. "Will you please to see that my two
baskets are placed in the luggage van, Gibbons?"</p>
<p>Gibbons touched his cap respectfully. It was the last outward recognition of
her social station that Mary was destined to receive for some time to come. She
had a vague idea of a carriage to herself, where she could have an hour or so
to regain her composure. She had never had any difficulty in this way when
travelling before. But first-class passengers, liberal towards the guard, and
third-class trippers, are different things, as Mary speedily discovered. The
train was very full, so full that Mary was content at last to find herself
packed with nine other people in a stuffy compartment, including a crying child
a surly workman, who smoked a foul pipe and spat liberally on the floor. One
window was closed for the benefit of the fretting infant and the poisonous
atmosphere of the place caused Mary to turn faint and giddy. Long before she
reached Victoria her head was aching, her temples throbbing horribly.</p>
<p>Noblesse oblige! It was by no means a promising start, but Mary was not
going to take her hand from the plough yet. And that dreadful journey could not
last for ever. Victoria was reached at length, and it was possible to breathe a
little comparatively fresh air again. Mary saw her two dress baskets placed on
the platform and looked at them in a helpless kind of manner. Hitherto a maid
or a footman had done all this kind of thing for her. An impatient porter
wanted to know whether the boxes were to go on a cab or whether they were to be
left in the cloak room.</p>
<p>"Make up your mind, miss," he said rudely. "I can't stand here all day."</p>
<p>"A four-wheeler," Mary gasped. "I&mdash;I'm sorry, but my head aches so
dreadfully that I can't even think properly. Will you call a cab for me?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-36" id="ch-36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;CONNIE COLAM</h2>
<p>The porter summoned a cab gruffly and the baskets were placed on top. Mary's
proffered coppers purchased a certain amount of civility so that the porter
asked the address. Mary gasped and stared in a blank kind of way. She had
absolutely forgotten the address. She recollected now that she had left the
card on the hall table at the dower house. How she longed from the bottom of
her heart to be back there again in that cool shadow. But the grimy face of the
cabman recalled her to her senses.</p>
<p>"I have stupidly left the address behind me," she said. "I remember the
street, and I daresay you can inquire when you get there. I am very
sorry&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Miss Dashwood, I think," a cool, firm voice, with a subtle suggestion of
laughter in it, smote on Mary's ears. "So you have forgotten the address. Not
that it matters in the least, for you are coming with me. You haven't taken
your room?"</p>
<p>"No," Mary stammered. She was utterly taken off her dignity by the easy
manner of the stranger. "I had the address given me, the address of a
respectable woman near the British Museum who had apartments to let.
Unfortunately, I left the paper behind me. But you will excuse me if I say that
I have not the pleasure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is all right," the stranger said. "I'm a friend of Ralph
Darnley's. He sent me a very long telegram to-day to a certain extent
explaining the position of affairs, and asking me to meet you and place my
services at your disposal. Perhaps you have heard Ralph speak of me, Connie
Colam."</p>
<p>"Only to-day," Mary said; "and then he did not allude to you by name. Still,
it is very kind of you to take all this trouble, especially for a stranger like
myself. How did you recognise me?"</p>
<p>"There were what the Americans call 'pointers' in the telegram," Miss Colam
laughed. "But please get in or we shall have the cabman abusive, and that is a
consummation decidedly not to be wished. Please drive to 16, Keppel
Terrace."</p>
<p>The ricketty vehicle got under way at length to Mary's great relief. She
laid her aching head back against the dirty cushions, wondering if in the whole
weary world there was another girl as miserable and heartsick as she was. She
raised her hot lids presently to the face of her companion. The critical edge
was already dulled, but in no circumstances could Mary have disapproved of her
companion. A very dainty and refined face was Connie Colam's, with a pleasant
frank expression and a sensitive mouth. At the same time she did not lack in
certain suggestions of courage and resolution.</p>
<p>"I hope you approve of me," she said demurely.</p>
<p>"I like your face, if that is what you mean," Mary replied. "I shall be able
to thank you presently for all your spontaneous kindness. Meanwhile, I have the
most dreadful headache. After we have found my rooms&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, your rooms are found already. For the present you are going to stay
with me. We are going to join forces. My late chum has gone to Paris for a
year, and you are going to occupy her bedroom. That is all arranged."</p>
<p>Mary murmured something that was intended for gratitude. She had always
professed a profound contempt for the helpless type of girl who lets things
drift, but she was letting herself drift now with her eyes wide open. And
though she was not prepared to admit it, she was almost hysterically glad of
the companionship and sympathy of the stranger. As she stood on the platform a
little time before, the horrible sense of desolation had gripped her, the awful
feeling of loneliness that comes to the friendless in London.</p>
<p>Yes, she was passionately glad of this companion. She did not even desire to
know whether Connie came of a good family or not, her one idea now was to lie
down and get rid of a wretched wearing headache. Where was her pride of race
and station now? Where were the force and courage that rose above circumstances
and fought physical weakness under? Mary was content to leave everything to her
companion&mdash;the paying of the cabman, the arranging of her boxes, the
setting out of her various treasures.</p>
<p>"Now you are going to lie down at once," Connie said. "I'll bathe your head
with Eau de Cologne, and as soon as I have settled you comfortably, I'll make
you a cup of tea. It is one of my great accomplishments. I make my own tea from
my own private supply. You lie there and think of nothing."</p>
<p>Mary closed her aching eyes; the touch of those deft kindly hands was very
soothing. The air was full of the faint scent, and gradually Mary dropped into
a sleep. It was an hour later before she opened her eyes again; the stinging
pain had gone. Connie stood by the side of the bed with a cup of tea in her
hand.</p>
<p>"You are better," she cried. "I can see that in your eyes. And what
beautiful blue eyes they are. A little cold, perhaps, but they won't be so cold
when they have looked at the world through our spectacles. Now drink your tea,
and when you feel up to it you can come and look at the sitting-room."</p>
<p>Mary was almost herself again when she entered the sitting-room. It was a
fairly large room, with a dining-table in the centre and a large table,
littered with brushes and paints and panels, which stood in the window looking
on to the street. A score of sketches in black and white faced Mary. So far as
she could see, it was clever work, but not the kind that appealed to her. The
sketches partook of the light and frivolous kind, some of them had more or less
feeble jokes attached.</p>
<p>"Are these yours?" Mary asked. "Are they studies of some kind?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," Connie said cheerfully. "They are translations from the
Yankees. The originals are very clear, but a little too trans-Atlantic for our
stolid English taste. So I more or less copy them and my editor adapts the
jokes. I do six of them every week for The Wheezer, which is a very useful
commission for me."</p>
<p>"But that sounds like piracy almost," Mary exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is," Connie said in the same cheerful way. "It is pretty easy
work, and I get six shillings a drawing. That is an average of thirty-six
shillings a week. I know artists who have exhibited in the Academy who are glad
to accept such a commission. It is better than working for the Razzle Dazzle
anyway."</p>
<p>Mary shuddered. In a way the Razzle Dazzle was familiar to her. She had once
caught one of the stable boys deep in that appalling mass of bad printing and
worse literature.</p>
<p>"So you have actually worked for that paper?" she managed to say.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Two shillings a drawing, and pay once a month. Do you know that
the Razzle Dazzle is a property worth &pound;10,000 a year? Their serials are
imported from America, and dressed up by hacks, who get two shillings a column
for their work. The Wheezer is far better than that. Besides, it is practice.
Some day I hope to drop this kind of thing and get regular commissions for the
better-class weekly papers. The illustrating of stories in the sixpenny
magazines is the goal of my ambition."</p>
<p>All this was so frank and open that Mary could not resent the tone of the
speaker. And yet she paled at the degradation of the class of labour.</p>
<p>"It must be very trying work for a lady," she said. "I mean for a lady
born."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is," Connie said thoughtfully. "But it is not so trying as your
landlady in the room demanding her back rent, coupled with a threat that if it
is not paid to-morrow she will put your boxes into the street. And that has
happened to me more than once, though my father was a general officer and my
mother the daughter of an archdeacon. I was quite alone in the world then; I
will never forget it. Try to fancy what it means for a young friendless girl to
be turned into the streets of London! I dream of it at night sometimes...That
afternoon I walked into the office of the Razzle and told one of the
assistant editors how I stood. It was like dragging the words from me. And he
gave me some work to do, and I sat up all night over it. Soon after that I was
carrying just one solitary sovereign. But what a lot that little coin meant to
me! And that is why I have a tender spot in my heart for that unspeakable old
Razzle. But I don't know why I am worrying you with all these sordid
details."</p>
<p>"Go on," Mary said in a hushed, awed voice. "You are opening up a new world
to me. You are making me feel ashamed of what I had hitherto regarded as an
exemplary life."</p>
<p>"We'll go into that presently," Connie said. "I've got to go and see a
friend of mine who is ill. We take her work and try to sell it. If it sells,
well and good. If not, we say that it has gone, and make up the money amongst
us. It sounds wrong, but it is meant in the proper spirit. I shan't be long.
Ring the bell and ask the landlady to clear away."</p>
<p>Connie vanished from the room, apparently taking all the sunshine with her,
and Mary proceeded to ring the bell. She wondered vaguely how many years it was
since she had entered that house. She did not hear the landlady address her at
first.</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," she said. "Yes, I am going to stay here for the
present with Miss Colam. You are Mrs. Speed...Where have I seen you
before? Your face is so very familiar to me. It brings back recollections of my
early childhood. You make me feel as if all this has happened before."</p>
<p>"I know the feeling, miss," the landlady said. "But I don't suppose you have
ever seen me. My very early days were spent on the estate of Sir Ralph
Dashwood, of Dashwood Hall. Maybe you have heard of it, miss?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-37" id="ch-37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII&mdash;THE UNEXPECTED
HAPPENS</h2>
<p>Just for a moment Mary felt inclined to disclose her identity. It warmed her
heart and brought tears to her eyes to hear this kind of voice from the past.
The wound of separation was too recent for Mary not to feel it keenly. The
woman's face was so familiar, too; it reminded the girl oddly of somebody else,
somebody that she did not like, but to whom for the moment she could not give a
name.</p>
<p>Then Mary's pride came back to her and the natural impulse to confide in the
woman was crushed down.</p>
<p>"I suppose I made a mistake," she said. "After all, it is not an uncommon
thing to find chance likenesses to your friends in other people. You must find
London a great change after being brought up in the country."</p>
<p>The woman sighed deeply and a look of pain came into her eyes. It was
evident that she had felt the change far more cruelly than Mary had imagined.
The girl longed to ask further questions, but she restrained her curiosity. Nor
could Connie Colam throw any light on the subject after she returned. She knew
very little about Mrs. Speed, except that she was a widow with a grown-up son,
who had been a great trouble to her. The son appeared occasionally, and Mrs.
Speed always seemed to be in deep distress afterwards. Mary was still debating
the matter in her mind at bedtime. After breakfast the following morning there
were more important matters to occupy her attention.</p>
<p>"Now you are going to show me what you can do," Connie said cheerfully. "I
take it that you have come up here with a view to getting your own living. If
you have any money&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You may get that idea out of your mind altogether," Mary smiled. "I have a
very few pounds to keep me going for the present, and a little jewellery to
fall back upon. I have not been used to this kind of life, and I shall probably
find it trying at first. But I am going to succeed. We have lost our position
socially and financially, and I would not be beholden to those who have taken
our place. I need not say more than that."</p>
<p>"That is just as you please," Connie said somewhat coldly. "I see you are
terribly proud and reserved, but you will grow out of that. And I like your
face. But please don't make up your mind that it is a very easy thing for a
girl to get her living in London. When you come to know the inside of a
pawnshop, and share the last sixpence with a friend, you will be all the
sweeter and better for it. Now show me your work."</p>
<p>Not without some pardonable pride, Mary displayed her drawings. There were
pretty landscapes in water colours, studies of groups of flowers in oils, and
the like, all the conventional kind of stuff that girls produce at finishing
schools under the eye of some discreet and clever master. But they did not seem
to impress Connie, who handled them with some contempt. Mary's sensitive face
flushed.</p>
<p>"You do not seem to care for them," she said with a challenge in her
voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, it isn't that," Connie replied. "It's the uselessness of the things. I
daresay that a good many of your friends have seriously advised you take up art
as a career."</p>
<p>"Two or three people," Mary protested, "who are in a position to judge."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know all about that," Connie said without ceremony. "It was just the
same with me in the happy days. My dear Mary, that pretty, pretty stuff of
yours is all very well to bring you in flattery from bazaar managers, but the
milk-stool school of art is no good when you get into the market. Painters,
real painters, mind, not daubers like us, find colour work dreadfully hard to
sell. There isn't a dealer who would give you five shillings for what you have
there. Could you do work like mine, for instance?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that I should not care to attempt it," Mary said coldly.</p>
<p>"There you go! Too vulgar for you, of course! You would never get the price
of your lodgings out of your class of work, believe me. I know, because I tried
it myself. But you will need to have your lesson like the rest of us, and I
will give you the names of a few of the most likely dealers in London. You
start off directly after breakfast and go the round of them. I shan't be back
to luncheon because I've got an hour or two on one of the evening papers
getting out sketches of a fashion plate for a lady's page."</p>
<p>Mary grasped eagerly at the suggestion. She wanted to prove that Connie was
wrong. With her head high and heart full of hope, she set off presently.</p>
<p>On the whole, it was a morning to be remembered. It was hot and stuffy, and
Mary was not accustomed to the blistering, trying heat of London pavements. She
was tired and worn out and her head ached terribly by the time she got back.
Nor was there any difference in the weight and contents of her portfolio.</p>
<p>Alas, for the blood of the Dashwoods! It was all the same to those
flinty-hearted dealers. Mary might have been the meanest beggar in London for
all the reception she met with. Struck by her distinguished appearance and
haughty beauty, a cringing shop assistant or proprietor would probably ask her
business, but what a change when the portfolio was produced! It was the same in
one shop after another, contemptuous inspection, rude denial, a suggestion that
the shopkeeper had more rubbish already than he knew what to do with. The tears
were at the back of Mary's eyes now; unconsciously her voice grew soft and
pleading. One dealer, a little kinder than the rest, did suffer the drawings to
be laid out before him.</p>
<p>"No use, my dear," he said with a sympathetic familiarity that, strange to
say, Mary could not bring herself to resent. "Bless your soul, cheap
lithographs and German reproductions have driven them out of the market. If you
offered me the lot at half-a-crown each I couldn't take them. It'll save you a
lot of trouble and disappointment if you put the whole batch on the fire. Why
should I buy that group of flowers for five shillings when I can sell you a
photogravure of Watts's for half the money? Your work has been out of date
since the mid-Victorian period."</p>
<p>It was the same everywhere, not so kindly expressed. At one o'clock Mary
returned to her lodgings utterly tired out and ready to cry in the bitterness
of her disappointment. How hard people were to one another, she thought. It
never occurred to her that this hardness had been her own great besetting sin
in the past. She was even inclined to quarrel with Connie because the latter's
prophecy had come so cruelly true.</p>
<p>But Connie was not in yet, and therefore Mary had to fight out her trouble
alone. Still, she had learned already a deeper and more important lesson than
she was aware of. She began to see that there was a world beyond the narrow
limit of the Dashwood horizon. There were other men and women living in the
world quite as worthy of respect. Mary took her sketches and dropped them one
by one slowly into the empty grate. Then she put a match to them and watched
them burn away to ashes. It was a full and complete confession of failure, and
Mary felt all the better for it. She rang the bell for a glass of milk to drink
with her frugal meal that was already set out on the table.</p>
<p>Nobody came in reply to her ring. Mary was not aware that it was an
understood thing in a general way that nobody rang the bell except at stated
times such as just after breakfast and the like. In houses of that class the
lodgers were expected to be away all day more or less. Otherwise, they were
really obliged to look after themselves. After the third ring Mary went
downstairs to investigate.</p>
<p>So far as she could judge the house was deserted. The dingy first floor
smelt horribly of cheap, stale, cigar smoke. The sordidness of the whole thing
struck Mary with peculiar and unpleasant force. It was all so totally different
to what she had been accustomed to. She wondered where Mrs. Speed was to be
found.</p>
<p>Then voices came from the dining-room, voices raised in anger. A man and a
woman there were quarreling violently. It seemed to Mary that the man's voice
was familiar to her, but she could not be quite certain as yet.</p>
<p>She made up her mind to go down into the basement&mdash;the dark, warm
basement that seemed to reek with the ghastly smells of bygone meals. Mary
wondered how people could live in an atmosphere like that. She was standing in
doubt at the head of the kitchen stairs when from the dining-room she heard her
own name.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the allusion to Dashwood. Quite naturally Mary stood
to listen. It was the man in the dining-room who was speaking.</p>
<p>"I tell you I must have it," he said. "What reason have you got to be fond
of the name of Dashwood? It never brought us any good. If Ralph Dashwood had
not been a fool, and you had played your cards right, you might be living at
the dower house now, with a handsome income and a staff of servants to wait
upon you."</p>
<p>The woman made some kind of reply that Mary could not quite catch, though
she knew by the choke in the voice that she was sobbing. The man resumed.</p>
<p>"I tell you I must have it," he said. "No use to tell me that you haven't
got the letters; for I have seen them in your possession. It's a letter sent
from Lady Dashwood to her son and the date is 9th September, 1884. Now you make
a note of that, please. If I don't have it, I shall find myself in serious
trouble. What game am I playing? I'm playing for more money than you ever
dreamed of."</p>
<p>"Money!" the woman said bitterly, "that is always your cry. But it has not
prevented you from taking all mine. And I owe three quarters' rent, which has
to be paid to-morrow. If it isn't paid to-morrow, I shall be sold up and turned
into the street."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-38" id="ch-38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII&mdash;THE MYSTERY
DEEPENS</h2>
<p>No reason to tell Mary now that it was Mrs. Speed who was speaking. She
recognised the tired, faded voice by this time. But the other voice was still
more familiar.</p>
<p>"That's bad," the man was saying, "why didn't you let me know that things
had got to this pass? I daresay I could have helped you."</p>
<p>"No, you would have promised to," Mrs. Speed cried, "and disappointed me at
the last moment. All my savings have gone into your pocket; you have wheedled
everything out of me till I haven't so much as a penny left. And now you come
here for more of those letters! That you are up to no good I feel certain. I
know by your dress and style that you have had the command of money. What are
you doing there?"</p>
<p>"Never you mind," the man said sulkily, "you'll know all in good time. I'm
playing for a big stake, and for once in a way it has turned up trumps. Only I
want that particular letter. When I get the letter I can answer certain
questions. Give me the letter, and I'll pledge my word that within a week you
shall have all the money you require. Only you are to ask no questions, and you
are not to move away from here mind that!"</p>
<p>"Oh, if I could get away from here!" Mrs. Speed sobbed. "Give me a chance of
earning my living, and that is all I ask for. I'll ask the agent to give me
another week, though I am afraid he won't do it. I've put him off too
often."</p>
<p>It was perhaps wrong of Mary to stand listening, but some fascination held
her to the spot. She had a strong desire to see who the man with the familiar
voice was.</p>
<p>"Then you are going to let me have the letter?" he said.</p>
<p>"I suppose so," came the weary response. "Never a thing yet that you made up
your mind to have that you didn't coax out of me. But the letters are hidden in
a box at the top of the house, and they will take some finding. Come again
to-morrow at the same time, and I'll see what I can do for you. But if I
consulted my own inclination I should go and see Lady Dashwood and tell her
everything. I am sick of this intrigue and mystery."</p>
<p>The man said something in a soothing kind of voice, and then followed a
sound like a kiss. Then a match was struck, and the heavy, dense atmosphere
became impregnated with the smell of fresh tobacco, after which the dining-room
door opened and the man came into the hall.</p>
<p>Mary walked swiftly back to the foot of the stairs. Without being noticed
now, she had a good view of the man's face. She started, but managed to check
the exclamation that rose to her lips. No wonder that the voice had been
familiar to her. For she was gazing at the dark, sinister features of Sir
Vincent Dashwood!</p>
<p>It was only for a moment, and then the front door opened and the man
swaggered out. Without troubling any further about her milk, Mary crept up the
stairs again. She had plenty now to occupy her thoughts. What was that man
doing here, and what letter was it that he was so anxious to obtain? And why
had he so powerful an influence over Mrs. Speed? It was open to Mary to ask the
question, but she decided to do nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>After all, questions of this sort would be worse than useless. They would
only arouse the suspicion and perhaps incur the curiosity of Mrs. Speed. Still,
the whole thing was a most extraordinary coincidence&mdash;not quite so much of
a coincidence perhaps if Mary had looked into the mind of Ralph Darnley?</p>
<p>But as the girl could not do so, she had to figure out the problem as best
she could. She recalled vividly to mind now the strange suggestions made by
Lady Dashwood, as to a great sin in the past with which she was intimately
connected. And here, according to Mrs. Speed, the latter was an accomplice
either before or after the fact. And why did the man who came here in such
urgent need of a certain letter require that document, seeing that he had been
accepted all around as Sir Vincent Dashwood?</p>
<p>Mary was still pondering the problem when Connie came back. The latter was
her own bright and cheerful self again, she had done a good morning's work, and
she had been paid for it to the extent of nearly a sovereign. She was inclined
to take a light view of life. She made no allusion to the portfolio, for which
Mary was grateful.</p>
<p>"I am very hungry," she said. "How nice this pressed beef is, and the
lettuce, too! I have had better, but as things go in London they are very
good."</p>
<p>Mary was silent. The beef was stringy and a little dry, the lettuce wilted
and yellow. In her mind's eye the girl could see the luncheon table of the
dower house at this particular moment; she could see the dusky, cool room, with
the breeze coming off the flowers in the garden. She could see the snowy cloth
and the crystal and the salad, cool and refreshing in the great silver bowl.
There would be nectarines and peaches too from the ripe south walls of the
garden. The whole atmosphere of it flooded Mary's soul and brought the tears to
her eyes.</p>
<p>"You are homesick," Connie said softly; "I used to be the same at one time.
And, of course, this luncheon is not at all nice, only I like to pretend that
it is. But you shall tell me all about yourself when you come to know me
better. And you shall also tell me what luck you had with the portfolio this
morning."</p>
<p>"I had no luck at all," Mary said presently, "nothing but slights and
insults, rebuffs and bitter humiliations. I might have been a servant girl for
all the civility I received. And even one man, who seemed to have a heart in
his breast, told me to come home and burn the lot."</p>
<p>"Wherefore you bounced out of the shop indignantly," Connie laughed.</p>
<p>"Indeed I didn't, I was too utterly crushed and sorrowful for that. I crept
here and made a bonfire of my precious drawings, and I am ready to ask your
pardon for the cold way in which I accepted your good advice this morning.
There!"</p>
<p>It was a great deal for Mary to say, a confession that she had failed, that
she was utterly wrong, the like of which she had never made before. Her face
was flushed now and her lips were all trembling. Connie looked at her with
undisguised admiration.</p>
<p>"You have won a greater victory than you know," she said quietly. "It is
very hard for anyone brought up as you have been to admit a failure. I had a
letter from Mr. Darnley this morning in which he told me a good deal about you.
I hope the day will come when you will learn to appreciate Ralph Darnley
properly."</p>
<p>"I think I do," Mary said, with the red mounting to her cheeks. "He is a
good man, and I owe him a great deal&mdash;my life itself on two occasions. But
he&mdash;he did not quite understand."</p>
<p>"Didn't he?" Connie asked, her eyes dancing with mischief, "he is an
audacious man. He thinks that he is good enough for any girl. And so he is,
bless him! Oh, you will learn your lesson in time, my dear. And when you do,
you will be one of the luckiest girls in the world. To be the wife of a man
like that, ah!"</p>
<p>"You think so highly of him as that?" Mary asked.</p>
<p>"Ay, I do, indeed. Oh, how I could love that man if only he cared for me! I
could open my heart to him to-morrow, and thank God fasting for a good man's
love. Fancy the sweet rest and peacefulness of it all, fancy laying down the
weary struggle, the fearful dread of the needs of the morrow with the assurance
that you had that man to protect you! But your eyes will be opened in time, you
will come to see that love is the best of all things."</p>
<p>Connie had dropped her voice almost to a whisper and her dark eyes were
moist. Then she seemed to wipe away the tears with a smile and was her sunny
self again.</p>
<p>"Please don't laugh at my sentimental manner," she said. "Let us talk about
you and your affairs. We may take it for granted that you have abandoned all
idea of making a fortune out of the milk-stool order of art. You feel quite
sure that you could make nothing of my kind of work."</p>
<p>"I should absolutely hate it," Mary shuddered. "Please don't be
offended."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am not in the least offended. I felt just like you at first. Did you
ever try your hand at designing? One or two girls I know do well at that."</p>
<p>Mary didn't know; as a matter of fact, she had never tried her hand at
anything of the kind; but she was perfectly willing to try. A horrible feeling
of helplessness was growing upon her; she wondered what she would have done if
Fate and Ralph Darnley had not thrown Connie and her together. For the next
hour or two she tried her hand at designs of various kinds, only to feel that
she made but a poor hand at the business. By tea-time her head was aching
terribly and she dropped into the armchair with a sigh of misery.</p>
<p>"They are pretty bad," Connie said in her candid way; "we shall have to wait
a little longer before we find your proper vocation. For the present you will
have to fall back upon colouring cards&mdash;Christmas cards, and post cards,
and the like. That pretty chocolate-box type of work of yours will do admirably
for that class of thing. You shall do a few specimen cards to-morrow, and I'll
give you the address of a man who will commission more. Only it is terribly
hard, you will get paid at the rate of half-a-crown a hundred."</p>
<p>Mary's heart sank within her. Half-a-crown a hundred! At that rate it would
be impossible for her to make more than fifteen shillings a week. She pointed
out the fact to Connie, who agreed with a cheerful nod.</p>
<p>"You have worked it out pretty accurately," she said. "There are hundreds of
girls who do it, and the worst of the thing is that so many girls can earn
pocket-money that way who have no need to do anything at all. It is the same
with typewriting, the same with everything. And, after all, it is quite
possible to live on fifteen shillings a week."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-39" id="ch-39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX&mdash;HOMELESS</h2>
<p>Connie refused to be drawn into further conversation for the present. She
was very busy touching up certain sketches which she informed Mary were
intended to illustrate the pages of a popular lady's novelette, the published
price of which was a halfpenny. They were dreadful drawings, as Mary could see,
grotesque exaggerations of the work of George Du Maurier, impossibly tall
females, with regular doll-like features and long lashes, with men of the same
type. Five drawings went to each novelette, and the price paid was thirty
shillings.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact they are not mine," Connie explained, as she put the
finishing touches to the figure of a severely classical duchess; "they are the
work of a friend. She has been very ill lately and her work has fallen off in
consequence. This lot would have been rejected by the editor, only I happen to
know his assistant, who suggested that I should take them back and patch them
up before they came under the eagle eye of the proprietor. I can get the money
for them this evening, and tell Grace that the editor asked me to bring it
along."</p>
<p>"That does not seem quite&mdash;quite the right thing," Mary suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh yes it does," Connie said bluntly. "Grace Cameron is a lady, and a great
friend of mine. This commission is all that she has to live on. I happen to
know that last night she spent her last two shillings on the peculiar tonic
medicine that is needful to her. Can't you imagine the poor girl's state of
mind if those drawings had been returned? What would you do if you were the
Recording Angel?"</p>
<p>Mary was silent. She had not looked at it in this light before. The delicacy
and tactfulness of it, the fine self-abnegation, appealed to her strongly. With
Connie, time was money, every hour she wasted represented the loss of some
necessary of life. And here she was cheerfully spending her own golden minutes
so that a poor invalid should not lack the peace of mind necessary to her
recovery. This was a practical sermon for Mary, worked out to a womanly and
logical conclusion. If Ralph Darnley could have looked into Mary's mind now he
would have been pleased with the success of his experiment.</p>
<p>"Oh, how good of you," she cried, "how womanly and sweet! You are actually
sacrificing yourself for the needs of others. I should never have thought of
it."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't at one time," Connie admitted frankly, "but I was a spoilt
child in those days, and gave no heed to anybody but myself. And when I came to
London alone and penniless and friendless, it was Grace Cameron who first held
out a hand to me. And Grace is capable of doing really good work. She is very
different from me. If she could only get into the country for a time and regain
her strength she would be heard of. But that is impossible!"</p>
<p>"Why?" Mary asked. She was deeply interested now. "Why can't she?"</p>
<p>"Because she helps to keep a widowed mother. One pound a week goes to the
poor old mother who is so proud of her girl's success. It is one of the most
pathetic and charming stories in the world. Mrs. Cameron is the widow of a
clergyman who left her very badly off, and Grace came to London to gain a name
with her brush. She did not succeed, but she never let her mother know, she has
always sent her something. And that 'something' makes all the world to the dear
old lady. You may call it a deception if you like, but I call it one of the
grandest things I have ever heard of. And all the while Grace is hoping for the
name that does not come, the name that will enable her to go into the country
and turn her back upon those impossible duchesses for ever. The story is known
to a few of us, and we take it in turn now that Grace is ill to do her work for
her. I am going down to Grace's rooms after supper, and you can come along with
me if you like."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes," Mary cried, "I should love to go with you. You may think
that I am very foolish and ignorant, but you are opening up a new world to me.
Positively I did not know that there were such things as these; even you are a
new type to me. And here am I, who have been living with my head in the clouds,
regarding the universe as being made up of people like the Dashwoods and
others, whose privilege and duty it is to serve them. How selfish!"</p>
<p>"Well, you are not selfish now," Connie said. "You had the pluck to turn out
and get your own living rather than eat what you call the bread of
charity."</p>
<p>"Pride," Mary exclaimed, "every bit of it pride. I was bitterly wounded with
a trick that Fortune had played upon me; in my arrogance, I left home, though
one kind heart bleeds for me, I only had my narrow point of view. And I hate
this kind of thing, I could cry aloud at the sordidness of it. I can't endure
it patiently as you do."</p>
<p>Connie laughed unsteadily. A mist crept into her eyes.</p>
<p>"It is because I have schooled myself," she said. "It is so weak to
complain. But there are times when I should like to die and make an end of it
all."</p>
<p>Again Mary had nothing to say. She was learning to plumb the depths of her
own selfishness by comparison with others. She was beginning dumbly to
understand what Ralph Darnley must think of her. And yet he had made no secret
of his love and affection. She was strangely silent as she walked along with
Connie in the darkness of the evening. They came at length to a mean little
street leading off Tottenham Court Road, and before a fairly respectable house
there, Connie stopped. Presently Mary found herself shaking hands with a tall,
thin girl, who gave her the strange impression that her new acquaintance was
made of some fragile china. Her clear skin was deadly pale, and the dark eyes
seemed to burn in the face like sombre flames. The slender frame was racked now
and then by distressing fits of coughing.</p>
<p>Yet there was a subtle strength and power about the girl that appealed to
Mary. Here was a girl after her own heart, one who would struggle to the end,
and if she had to die she would fall in her tracks without a murmur.</p>
<p>Yet everything was against her. She had no natural advantages like Mary.
There was more shame for the latter. Hitherto she had lived entirely for
herself; her bounties had been dispensed with a haughty hand.</p>
<p>She had never dreamed of a kingdom inhabited by such brave, pure souls as
these. Despite the shabby little sitting-room it was impossible to mistake
Grace Cameron for anything but a lady. She had a smile of sweet sympathy as
Connie made the necessary introduction, and spoke of Mary as another of the
elect who had come into the arena.</p>
<p>"You have my sympathy," the girl said with a pleasing smile, "I could wish a
woman foe of mine no harder fate. Anybody can see that you have not been used
to this kind of thing&mdash;you are too recently a commander to know the
bitterness of being commanded by the canaille we frequently have to deal with.
We cannot all meet our misfortunes as cheerfully as Connie does. But you will
learn your lesson in time. Tell me, have you heard anything as to those last
drawings of mine?"</p>
<p>"I have the money for them at any rate," Connie said without looking at the
speaker. "Mr. Scudamore was very kind."</p>
<p>Grace Cameron drew a deep breath of relief, a wave of pink rose to her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"They were dreadful," she whispered. "But I was so ill on Monday and Tuesday
that I had to drag myself to the work. My hand shakes terribly still, and I
have some kind of a commission that I must finish to-morrow. It is a design for
the cover of a new penny weekly. I have the scheme sketched out, but I am
afraid that I shall not be able to finish it. And I know that my mother is in
great need of a few pounds. How hard it is to be like this."</p>
<p>The last few words rang out passionately. Connie patted the speaker's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't despair," she said, "give me the rough design and I will put in the
colour. Take at least five hours! Well, what of that. Give us some supper
presently&mdash;it matters little what time we get home in the morning. Mrs.
Grundy has no terrors for the true and tried children of Bohemia."</p>
<p>Connie's cheerfulness seemed to be unflagging and unfailing. She had no
great aptitude for the brush, but she had the great gift of patience. The hours
wore on, supper came and went, and presently a clock somewhere struck the hour
of two. Then at last Connie held up the coloured design in triumph.</p>
<p>"There," she cried, "I guess they will be satisfied with that. I wish I had
some of your boldness and originality, Gracie. I think we've done it this time.
What a shame it is that good stuff should go for so little money! And now I
really must be off. Mary looks tired to death. I'll post this for you, if you
like."</p>
<p>Mary was tired and worn out, but she was not thinking of herself as she
dragged along by Connie's side. She had learned a great deal in the last
four-and-twenty hours.</p>
<p>In a vague, disturbed way she felt ashamed of herself. She did not notice
the little cry that broke from Connie as they stood before the house where
their rooms were. The place was all in pitch darkness, a litter of straw lay
before the door. As Connie applied her latchkey and pushed back the door the
house sounded curiously hollow. Footfalls clanked on a bare floor. Connie
struck a match and held it aloft.</p>
<p>"The house is empty!" she cried, "the people have gone. These things happen
with the struggling poor when they are threatened over their rent. Let us go
and see if they have packed our belongings in the confusion."</p>
<p>The little sitting-room was empty of everything, the bedroom the same;
nothing was left.</p>
<p>"My writing-case!" Mary cried, "my purse, too, in my box. And in the
case&mdash;my jewels. Connie, Connie, what will become of us?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-40" id="ch-40"></a>CHAPTER XL&mdash;IN PERIL</h2>
<p>Connie was the first to recover herself. She knew far better than Mary how
great the danger was, how great the need for coolness and judgment. And she had
been in dire straits like this before. She held the flaring match above her
head and looked round the deserted room. On the mantelpiece stood a fragment of
candle stuck in the neck of a bottle, and this Connie proceeded to light.</p>
<p>"Now we can go over the house and see if they have placed our belongings
anywhere," she said cheerfully. "I have been in one or two strange
predicaments, but never anything quite so bad as this. Still, I am sure that
Mrs. Speed is an honest woman. It is more than likely that she has placed our
goods and chattels somewhere."</p>
<p>But though the house was searched from top to bottom, nothing could be
found. Mary did not give way, though she was tired out and weary, and sinking
for the need of food. She had not yet lost her robust country appetite; she had
not brought herself down to exist on weak tea and bread and butter, as Connie
did.</p>
<p>"It is downright cruel," she cried. "That woman knew that we should come
back, that you are in the habit of entering the house with a latch key. And to
go off with all our wardrobe like this; to take everything. What are we to
do?"</p>
<p>"It must have been some terrible mistake," Connie said. As usual, she seemed
loth to judge anybody harshly. "The poor woman could not pay her rent. No doubt
the landlord had threatened to come in tomorrow and take everything. And Mrs.
Speed has a young family. She probably went to the agent and asked for
time&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know she did," Mary cried, recollection suddenly coming back to her.
"As it happens, I overheard the conversation. There was some man here, a man I
know something about, though we need not go into that. And Mrs. Speed seemed to
be terribly short of money. I heard her say what was going to happen. Oh,
Connie, my head is so confused that I cannot think, I shall wake up presently
and find myself at the dear old dower house again. I did not dream that there
were things like this in the world; I did not think it possible."</p>
<p>"There are worse things," Connie said sadly. "It is very terrible&mdash;very
indeed; but what can poor people do? And yet there are others who waste
thousands on their dress and amusement and pleasures, little dreaming of the
sort of hell that forms half the life of the poor. Mrs. Speed sees that her
household is in danger&mdash;her furniture is the one thing that stands between
herself and the workhouse. The poor creature is so distressed that she has no
thought for anybody else&mdash;she forgets our existence. She finds another
house to go to, and she hires a man to come late at night and remove the
things. I understand that there is a contractor who holds himself ready for
this kind of thing. He employs very rapid workmen, and he uses vans with no
name on the cover. The thing is easily done in this stony-hearted town, where
your next door neighbour is a matter of indifference to you.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Speed is in the new house waiting to receive her goods. In the haste
and confusion everything is packed, sent away. I have no doubt we shall get our
belongings back again."</p>
<p>"And meanwhile, we have lost everything," Mary protested. "We have exactly
what we stand up in. And every penny of my money, to say nothing of my jewels,
has gone. We ought to go straight to the police."</p>
<p>"No," Connie said firmly. "A year or two ago I should have done so without
hesitation, but not now. Ah, my dear I know how the poor live, how fierce are
their temptations. When the great Day of Judgment comes God will be tender to
His poor."</p>
<p>The fierce flame of Mary's anger died away, and a feeling of shame succeeded
it. She was forced to recognise the many ways in which her companion was the
superior of herself. Should she ever grow soft and sympathetic like that? Would
her misfortunes render her more lenient to the failings of others? And yet
Connie had said that she had been at one time the child of hard
selfishness.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are right," Mary admitted. "But what are we going to do? Where
are we going to sleep to-night? And have you any money?"</p>
<p>"Two shillings," Connie replied. "Two shillings in my pocket, more by
accident than anything else. My bank has vanished with my tin box. We can't go
back to Grace's lodgings at this time of night. But that is not the worst."</p>
<p>Mary's heart sank within her. Could there be any worse than this?</p>
<p>"It is that very question of lodgings," Connie explained. "Nobody will take
us without belongings. They would regard us as a pair of swindlers."</p>
<p>"Swindlers!" Mary's face flamed at the new word. The late mistress of
Dashwood Hall regarded by a common Cockney landlady as a swindler!</p>
<p>"It seems so cold, so hard-hearted," she protested. "And just now you were
speaking of the virtues of the poor, their kindness to each other,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear Mary, there is no kindness like it in the world, because generally
it is the very essence of self-sacrifice. But there is another side to the
matter. They have to be careful, they are compelled to look coldly on
outsiders, they&mdash;but why am I preaching social sermons to you at this time
of night? We must make the best of it till morning and then try to find Mrs.
Speed."</p>
<p>It seemed a hopeless kind of business to Mary. Something like looking for a
needle in the proverbial truss of hay. But the girl's wits were sharpened now
by this sudden contact with adversity. She began to see a way.</p>
<p>"It may be possible to find Mrs. Speed," she said. "It will be weary work,
but the thing has to be done. The man I was speaking about, the man who was
here yesterday&mdash;he is calling here to-morrow for a certain letter. I could
force him to...but that shall be my business. The question is where shall
we sleep? Not on these bare boards. And I shall drop if I don't have something
to eat."</p>
<p>The dawn was breaking in through the shutterless windows now&mdash;the red
dawn of the summer day that gives London an added touch of beauty. It would be
broad daylight before long. The presence of the light gave Mary a new
courage.</p>
<p>"It is useless to think of sleeping anywhere," Connie said. Her face was
pale and downcast, all the colour had gone out of her eyes. Mary had not before
seen her friend on the verge of despondency, and the knowledge spurred her to
new efforts.</p>
<p>"Let us go for a walk before the place gets hot and stuffy and full of
struggling humanity. A London crowd always makes me so sad&mdash;it is awful to
think that every man and woman streaming past you is engaged in the struggle
for bread."</p>
<p>"Come out of this," Mary said hoarsely. "Let us feel the sunshine. This is
heart-breaking, nerve-destroying work, but I am not sorry that I came. Let us
go and watch the sun rise, and if there is any place where we can get something
to eat&mdash;"</p>
<p>There was, at the end of the Embankment, a coffee stall, the leaden-eyed
proprietor of which regarded the girls without emotion. He had served all
classes of customers in his time, and, these well-dressed girls, with an
unmistakable air of class about them, inspired him with no curiosity. He filled
up the thick cups of muddy coffee and cut the stodgy bread and the debatable
butter. It was hideous stuff altogether, but Mary was astonished to find with
what zest she was devouring it. A flashy woman, terrible in her cheap finery,
staggered up and demanded tea. A man, unmistakably a gentleman, with a well-cut
suit of clothes, partook of cocoa and a slice of bread. His coat collar was
turned up, and Mary surmised that this was to hide the absence of a shirt. The
girl was learning her lesson with terrible swiftness. Another man, with a bag
in his hand, hurried up and breathlessly asked for tea. His face was white and
pink by turns, he looked about him a furtive kind of way. From behind the
barrow a powerful figure shot out and grabbed at the shoulder of the man with
the bag. The latter showed fight for a moment, then his white face broke into a
profuse shower of moisture.</p>
<p>"Better come quietly," the powerful man said. "You can have a cab if you
like, though it does not matter much at this time of day. You've given me a
long chase."</p>
<p>The two vanished in the direction of the Strand, where now the houses and
spires were all golden in the purple mists. Mary shuddered.</p>
<p>"What does that mean?" she asked. "Was&mdash;was he some criminal?"</p>
<p>"That is it," Connie explained quietly. "And the other man was a detective.
Oh, it is a horrible place, this London, if you come to see it from the
underside. I long for millions of money to turn this city into a paradise. You
think I am always cheerful and careless, but my two years here have left a mark
upon me that I will never get rid of. Let us walk along the Embankment as far
as Westminster, and then strike West for the Park. I feel a perfect longing for
flowers and green grass. We will go through Park Lane, and speculate as to what
the millionaires there are dreaming about&mdash;the people who have a hundred
times as much as they can spend, and are yet greedy for more. Oh, my dear, if
you only knew how tired I am, so utterly worn out."</p>
<p>Connie sat down on a seat on the Embankment and burst into tears.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-41" id="ch-41"></a>CHAPTER XLI&mdash;THE LESSON OF
ADVERSITY</h2>
<p>Hitherto Mary had been entirely dependent upon her newly-found friend. She
had come up to London with the proud intention of making her own living, a
Dashwood ready to defy Fate and overcome it from the first onset. On the
contrary, she had been a living example of the weakness of the unemotional when
confronted with the problem of existence. If it had not been for Connie, she
shuddered to think of what might have become of her by this time. But there was
stirring within her now those high attributes and noble qualities that Ralph
Darnley had discovered behind the armour of selfishness and ice of pride. It
behoved her to act now that Connie had failed.</p>
<p>That poor Connie's breakdown was only temporary made very little difference.
Mary must become the head of the expedition now. She placed her arm around the
other girl's waist and kissed her tenderly. Mary had never done such a thing in
her life before. She would have found it physically impossible. And here it
seemed the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>"You must not give way," she whispered. "Dear Connie, you can't tell how
much I admire and respect you. We are going to be friends as long as we both
live. You have taught me more in the last two days than I ever learned
before."</p>
<p>"I shall be better presently," Connie sobbed. "I am so tired. Let me put my
head on your shoulder and rest a little. Only don't let me go to sleep, as we
shall have some horrid policeman making us move on, and I have not come quite
to that."</p>
<p>The weary head fell back on Mary's shoulder and the weary eyes closed. Five
minutes later, and Connie had passed into the land of dreams. It was not much
past three yet, and the Embankment was very quiet, save for the passing of the
wretched wanderers, who seem to find nowhere rest for the soles of their feet.
There were evil-looking creatures, both men and women, slouching along and
hideous faces once human leered at Mary, but the daylight seemed to take all
the audacity out of this. There were others, too, who had fairer faces, and who
turned aside with proper respect as they saw the sleeping girl with her head on
Mary's shoulder. A policeman came along like the head of the universe and
paused before the seat.</p>
<p>"This isn't quite the thing," he said. "Hope there's nothing wrong,
miss?"</p>
<p>The man was gruff, but utterly sympathetic. Mary took heart of grace. Fancy
her, the heiress of the Dashwoods, explaining the sordid situation to a London
policeman!</p>
<p>"We have had a great misfortune," she said. "When we got back to our
lodgings to-night our landlady had vanished, taking all her furniture along.
And everything of ours had vanished also; we could do nothing till to-day. And
my friend is so worn out that she has fallen asleep, as you see."</p>
<p>The red-faced policeman whistled. He needed nobody to tell him that he was
face to face with a lady of the real West End type. He was a policeman of
experience. That Mary was telling the truth he could see from the look in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"Very sorry, miss," he said. "Don't disturb the other lady. I'll keep an eye
on you till I go off my beat at seven o'clock."</p>
<p>The man touched his helmet and passed silently on. The incident touched Mary
and brought the tears to her eyes. She was surprised to find how the once
unwonted tears rose to her lids. She did not realise perhaps how steadily the
ice was melting from around her heart. But she did realise what a great
palpitating thing the life of the town was, its cruelties and its misfortunes,
and the tender touches that spring from the impulses of a common humanity. Mary
was learning her lesson.</p>
<p>She sat there till the sun glinted on the bosom of the Thames; she saw the
barges gliding down with the tide; she watched the first rush of cabs from the
stations. And ever and anon the cool vision of Dashwood rose up before her. If
she were at home now she would be out in the garden gathering roses to decorate
the huge bowls in the drawing-room. She wondered if the Blois was out under her
window, and whether Clegg, the head gardener, had looked after the new phloxes
properly.</p>
<p>She could see it all now as it would be in the dewy sunlight. Well, if the
worst came to the worst, she could go back to the dower house again, but she
would not go alone. Connie should accompany her and Grace Cameron. It would be
a glorious thing to take the pallid, hollow-eyed painter down there, and send
her back to her beloved work with an elastic step and the light of health
glowing in her brown, ambitious eyes. Mary was beginning to understand what
wealth could do and what glorious privileges it possessed. She began to
understand what Ralph Darnley had been thinking about her. Well, the time would
come when Ralph should learn his mistake. All these things, and more, Mary
dreamed of as she sat patiently there with Connie's head on her shoulder. The
latter stirred presently, and opened her eyes to the glory of the day. It was
past seven now, and the greatest city in the world was awake to the struggle
for existence. It was some little time before Connie's mind was clear enough to
grasp the situation.</p>
<p>"I have been asleep for three hours," she exclaimed. "What an intolerable
burden you must have found me. Why didn't you wake me?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I have been dreaming myself," Mary smiled. "Anyway, I did not seem
to notice. And there was a policeman who was very kind. I was watching the day
break over the river, and it took me back to the old home. It seemed to me,
Connie, that I had not been as frank with you as I might. Let me tell you why I
left home. It will be a new experience for me to have a girl friend to love and
confide in."</p>
<p>They sat for an hour longer, and Mary told her story. She was surprised at
the ease and fluency with which the narrative came from her. And she was
surprised, too, to find how much better she felt for the telling.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, nothing can deprive us of the pleasures of memory," Connie said.
"I like to dream of the old home sometimes, though there is a deal of pain with
the joy in it. And you have the consolation of knowing that you can go back
when you like, and find a real loving welcome waiting you in the bargain."</p>
<p>"I shall never really go back under present conditions," Mary said. "But I
see now that this is no reason why I should not visit my dear Lady sometimes.
Wouldn't it be a glorious thing to have a nice holiday down there! To take you
with me for a fortnight, to take Grace also, and leave her with Lady Dashwood
till she was quite herself again. Now I know that you have been scheming and
planning for a long time to get a real chance for Grace. If I told Lady
Dashwood she would never hesitate for a moment&mdash;it would be as good as
done. That is the plan I have in my mind."</p>
<p>Connie caught at Mary and, heedless of passers-by, kissed her
affectionately.</p>
<p>"An angel unawares," she said with an unsteady laugh. "That is what you are.
Oh, my dear, you must not put these temptations in my way, you must not try to
make me discontented with my lot. For two years I have not seen a green field,
or caught a sight of the sea. It is two years since I was so extravagant as to
go to Hastings for the day. I took my lunch and passed the whole afternoon in
the glen at Fairlight.</p>
<p>"I met a doctor there, he was just recovering from a dangerous
illness&mdash;such a nice fellow! And it seemed the most natural thing in the
world that we should tell our story to one another. I wonder if I shall see
that young doctor again?"</p>
<p>"I wonder," Mary laughed. "But what are we going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Have a proper breakfast at a place I know of," Connie said. "Then we are
going to sit on the grass in the Park, and you will have a sleep whilst I look
after you. Grace does not get up till about mid-day, so we won't bother her
just yet. Perhaps she will be able to find us another lodging. My dear Mary,
your white face is quite a reproach to me. Let us go to breakfast at once."</p>
<p>The breakfast was plain, but good, and eaten in a clean room, which was
something. Then the two wandered into the Park, given over at this hour to
nursemaids and children, and under the shade of a tree Mary lay down and closed
her weary eyes. The warmth was soothing. Mary found herself wondering what they
would have done had it been a wet day...Her mind began to wander now...she
was back again in the garden at Dashwood, she was rambling the summer
woods with the breeze in the old elms overhead. Then gradually the world seemed
to grow dark, and she slept.</p>
<p>The sun was high overhead when she came to herself again. She felt fresh and
vigorous now, ready for anything. Then the humorous side of the thing struck
her and she laughed. The idea of a Dashwood sleeping out all night like a
common tramp! And yet Mary did not quite realise how near the most prosperous
of us is to the workhouse. A trick of Fate, misfortunes over money matters, a
long illness, and the thing is done. There are thousands of such instances
every year.</p>
<p>"Do you feel equal to moving yet?" Connie asked.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="ill-03" id="id03"></a><img alt="" src="1200191h-images/1200191h-05.jpg"></p>
<p><b>"Under the shade of a tree Mary laid down and closed her weary
eyes."</b></p>
</center>
<p>"My dear, I feel equal to anything," Mary cried. "My courage has come back
to me. And now what do you propose to do next?"</p>
<p>"The next thing is to call on Grace and tell her of our misfortunes. We must
not repeat last night's experiment if we can help it. Besides, there are those
drawings for the Wheezer which are promised for to-morrow. They were all
finished and lying on my table when the catastrophe happened. I must get them
back to-day."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-42" id="ch-42"></a>CHAPTER XLII&mdash;THE COURAGE OF
DESPAIR</h2>
<p>Grace Cameron was making a pretence of breakfast when Mary and Connie
arrived. Her pallid face was more flushed than usual, her cough very
distressing. But she had no thought for herself directly the story came to be
told.</p>
<p>"You poor dears!" she cried. "What a cruel misfortune! To have lost
everything in this way is doubly terrible. Oh, if it were only possible for you
to stay here! The house is almost full up, and my landlady is independent
accordingly. I am expecting every day that she will ask me to go&mdash;the
breakfast in bed and my late rising give a great deal of trouble. There seems
to be nothing that I can do."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, there is," Connie said cheerfully. "You can help us wonderfully.
For the moment we are absolutely penniless. Our idea is to take a bed
sitting-room together, for a few shillings a week, and restore confidence, in
lieu of personal belongings, by paying the rent in advance. I want you to lend
me a sovereign for about a week."</p>
<p>"But my dear, I haven't got it," Grace said in deep distress. "I only kept a
few shillings out of the money you gave me yesterday, the rest I posted to my
mother not an hour ago. If I had only known! And I suppose you can't possibly
draw any more money from the Wheezer till the end of the week!"</p>
<p>"I might have done so," Connie said. "I had the week's drawings finished.
They must be in to-morrow or I shall certainly do no more work in that quarter.
They were all lying ready on my table when I came round here last night."</p>
<p>"Oh, this is dreadful," Grace cried, with the tears in her eyes. "If you had
not returned here then, this dreadful thing would never have happened. To think
that your kindness and goodness to me should have produced a result like this!
Oh, Connie, what are you going to do, what can you do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't," Connie said unsteadily. "It was no fault of yours. I
daresay we shall manage to muddle through some way or another. It is a great
pity that so many of our circle are so hard up just at present."</p>
<p>"And Miss Dashwood is as badly off?" Grace asked.</p>
<p>"Please don't call me Miss Dashwood," Mary said. "It makes me feel as if I
were not one of you. Yes, I am in the same boat. Still, I dare say&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mary's voice trailed off into a whisper. An idea had come to her. She was
quite ready to humble her pride now; she no longer shrank from the idea with a
pain that was almost physical. If the worst came to the worst, she could
telegraph to Lady Dashwood and ask for a few pounds by wire. And yet that
seemed a weak thing to do, seeing that she had left the dower house so short a
time before, determined to make her way in the world. But that would have to be
done before nightfall, unless&mdash;</p>
<p>Unless! There was yet another way out of it. The recollection of the
dramatic scene between the so-called Sir Vincent Dashwood and Mrs. Speed came
with vivid force to Mary. The man had come for some important letter. What the
letter was and what it had to do with the Dashwood succession mattered nothing
at that moment. At any rate the letter was needed, and Vincent Dashwood had
promised to come back for it. And Mary did not fail to remember now what Mrs.
Speed had had to say about the trouble she was in over her rent. That trouble
had culminated with disastrous swiftness, and to save her furniture the woman
had vanished in the night.</p>
<p>With a mind full of her own troubles, she had probably given no heed to
Vincent Dashwood. But it was necessary to his success that he should find
her.</p>
<p>No doubt he was hanging about now somewhere in the locality of Keppel
Terrace waiting for a sign. And here was the desperate chance that Mary
needed.</p>
<p>She, too, would spend the next few hours in the neighbourhood of Keppel
Terrace. Her mind was made up and she resolved to act without delay. She rose
to her feet with a smile and made her way towards the door.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Connie asked.</p>
<p>"I have a little idea of my own," Mary said. "I can't tell you everything,
because it is in a way mixed up with my private affairs. But I think that I
shall be able to get everything back before we sleep to-night. I am not going
to be a helpless burden on you two poor dear things. I want you to feel that
you have been entertaining the proverbial angel unawares. I may not be back
till late, but you need not be anxious. After my experience of last night, I am
not afraid of anything."</p>
<p>"Let her go," Grace said, as Connie would have detained the speaker. "She is
anxious to do something, and I feel that she will succeed."</p>
<p>Mary went down stairs with a firm, steady tread. She was not in the least
afraid now. Whatever she lacked, there was no question of her courage. And she
was going off now on an errand of mercy and relief. The knowledge thrilled her,
she was conscious of emotions and feelings now that she had never felt before.
The warm hot blood was coursing through her veins; there was a gladness about
her heart that made her feel strangely young and buoyant. She would have liked
to meet Ralph Darnley now and tell him many things that had not occurred to her
before. She was ashamed of the way that she had treated that man. And he was
good enough for her; as Connie had said, he was good enough for any girl. What
did birth matter, what did anything matter, so long as the man was good and
true and the woman sweet and tender? It came to Mary with a crushing force that
the Dashwood pride was a poor and feeble thing by comparison.</p>
<p>She was still turning these new sensations over in her mind when she arrived
at Keppel Terrace. The empty house seemed to look at her with blank, mocking
eyes. For a long time she walked up and down before the house. An hour, two
hours, passed before Mary noted anything to attract her attention. Then she
thrilled as she saw Vincent Dashwood come swaggering along the terrace. He
paused at the step of No. 16, and looked up at the house. Mary could see his
gesture of passion. As he stood there, evidently nonplussed by his discovery, a
boy came up to him and handed him a card, which he read and then tore up.</p>
<p>Greatly daring, Mary came along the pathway. She pulled her veil down and
pretended to ring the bell at No. 17. Her back was to Dashwood; she calculated
that he would not notice her, that she would be the last person in the world he
was likely to meet. But Mary was trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>"All right," she heard Dashwood say. "I suppose the lady told you what I was
like?"</p>
<p>"That's it sir," the boy said. "The lady knew as you would come. She gave me
a shilling for this job. I've been hanging about here since dinner time."</p>
<p>"Well, here's another shilling for you," Dashwood said in great good humour.
"Tell the lady that you delivered the card properly and that I'll call after
dark. As it happens, I know the address on the card you gave me."</p>
<p>The boy went whistling off down the road and Dashwood swaggered away. Here
was a piece of luck that Mary had not expected. She had made up her mind to
loiter about the street till she saw Dashwood, provided that he had not come
and gone already. But she knew perfectly well that Dashwood and early hours did
not go together, and upon that fact she had acted. Her idea was to follow the
man, knowing that sooner or later he was certain to look for Mrs. Speed. But
here was a piece of real good fortune on which she had not reckoned at all.
Dashwood had read the address, and then, with his usual carelessness, had torn
up the card. Mary was off the doorstep as soon as it was safe, and the pieces
of torn card were in her hand. She had only to put them together and the
address was here.</p>
<p>This was splendid! Here was a way of proving to Connie and Grace Cameron
that she was a friend to be relied upon. Mary's heart warmed at the idea of it.
Her fingers trembled as she pieced the fragments of the card together and read
the address. It was clearly set out in a neat handwriting.</p>
<p>No. 24 Hamerton Gardens, N. W.&mdash;surely the new house was some distance
away. Mary had yet to learn that these midnight flittings necessitated a change
of neighbourhood at a considerable distance as to locality. A friendly
policeman directed Mary into the Strand, and another told her which 'bus to
take. By the time the girl arrived at her destination she had fourpence in her
possession.</p>
<p>But she did not care about that. She was on the right track now, and if luck
were dead against her she could walk home. Here was Hamerton Gardens at length,
and the litter of straw and refuse before the house testified to the fact that
somebody had recently occupied the house or left it. With a courage that was
all her own, Mary walked up the steps and rang the bell. As nobody responded to
the summons, she opened the door and walked in. She had made no mistake, she
recognised the umbrella stand at a glance. There was no linoleum down in the
hall as yet and the stair carpets were rolled up on the floor.</p>
<p>Somebody crossed the hall and entered a little room on the right. Mary
fairly gasped as she noted the tall figure in the grey silk. She wondered if
she could credit her eyes. For the tall figure in the grey silk was Lady
Dashwood!</p>
<h2><a name="ch-43" id="ch-43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII&mdash;GETTING NEARER</h2>
<p>Mary drew back a moment to see what was going to happen. She ought to have
been utterly taken by surprise at her discovery, but she felt no emotion of
that kind. She was past the feeling&mdash;life had been too full of thrilling
incidents during the last few hours for that. It never occurred to the girl
that she had made a mistake. In an instant her mind was made up. Very swiftly
and silently she darted after Lady Dashwood, and followed her into a room at
the back of the house. There was a grimy specimen of the London charwoman on
the floor, scrubbing the dirty boards apparently in readiness for the laying of
a roll of linoleum that stood in one corner. A bottle half filled with beer
ornamented the mantelpiece, and from this the worker on the floor frequently
refreshed herself, as her red face testified.</p>
<p>She looked up angrily as Lady Dashwood entered. The intruder had to ask her
question twice before she drew a reply.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Speed isn't in," the woman said, "and if she was, she would not care
to see any visitors as yet. We only moved in here last night, and not so much
as an odd man to help for love nor money, and me fit to drop."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear that," Lady Dashwood said in her gentle manner, "I have
come up from the country especially to see Mrs. Speed. Can you give me any idea
what time she is likely to be back again?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't," was the surly reply, "not before tea-time anyway. If you like
to wait in the dining-room, you can do so&mdash;you don't look the sort to go
off with anything. And there's an armchair or two in there."</p>
<p>As Lady Dashwood turned she came face to face with Mary. She stood quite
still, too utterly surprised to speak. Mary took her by the arm, and led the
way to the dining-room. She pushed one of the chairs forward, and invited Lady
Dashwood to sit down. Then Mary closed the door. She smiled at the helpless
amazement of Lady Dashwood's face.</p>
<p>"Mary, my dear child, what are you doing here?" the elder lady gasped.</p>
<p>"I might ask you the same question," Mary said. "What you regard as a most
strange coincidence has a very prosaic explanation. Oh, my dearest, if you only
knew how glad I am to see you again! If you only knew how I have missed you.
But I need not go into that now; there will be plenty of time presently. My
dear, I have been learning things the last two days and have been making
discoveries. You may not believe it, but I am glad that I came here, yes, glad,
glad!"</p>
<p>"You are looking fairly well," Lady Dashwood observed. "A little pale and
drawn, but there is something in your eyes that I never noticed before. A sort
of new strength and tenderness combined, not so hard and proud. But you seem
pale and tired."</p>
<p>Mary laughed. She had good reason to be pale and tired. She wondered what
Lady Dashwood would say when she heard last night's adventure.</p>
<p>"I am utterly worn out," she said frankly, "and yet I am glad I came to
London. You can't tell how much good it is doing me. Strange as it may seem, I
am quite happy, and all the more so because I am fighting for the good of other
people. Hitherto, I have never thought of anybody but myself. As you know, I
came up to London with an idea of getting my own living. I was going to be very
proud and independent I had a vague idea that being a Dashwood would make the
ground clear for me. I blush now to think of my ignorance and folly. But I am
wandering from the point. You will recollect that Mr. Darnley offered to ask a
friend of his in London to assist me.</p>
<p>"I refused the offer, of course, in my stupid way. But Connie Colam met me
at Victoria. What I should have done without her, goodness knows. She was
kindness itself to me. And in a very short time we became fast friends. Fancy
me, me, giving my heart to a girl who lives in Bloomsbury, and gets her living
by doing horrible drawings for a low-class paper!"</p>
<p>"It seems strange," Lady Dashwood murmured, "I hope that she is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear, Connie is a lady. Oh, if you only knew how my eyes have been
opened! And there is another girl, a lady, too, called Grace Cameron. But you
are going to meet them and satisfy yourself that I am not degrading the great
house of Dashwood. Grace Cameron is an invalid, and last night we stayed at her
house very late finishing some work for her. We did not get home till past two
in the morning. What do you think of that for a Dashwood?"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood could not repress a smile. It seemed very dreadful and
unconventional, but there was a glad, tender ring in Mary's voice that the
elder lady liked.</p>
<p>"We walked home through the streets at that hour," Mary went on, "and when
we reached our rooms the house was empty. Everything had gone! And that brings
me to the cause of my presence here at this moment. Our landlady was Mrs.
Speed, the woman who has just moved in here. She had got into trouble over her
rent; she was afraid that her furniture was going to be sold up, and when we
were out last night she had taken everything away. No doubt the poor woman was
half distracted, but it was a cruel thing to do with us. She might have given
us a hint. She might have left our belongings behind. But she didn't and there
we were bereft of everything that we possessed in the world at two o'clock in
the morning."</p>
<p>"Oh, my darling," Lady Dashwood cried, "what did you do then?"</p>
<p>"There was nothing to do. We had very little money and nowhere to go. So, as
it was a fine night, we slept on the Thames Embankment and breakfasted at a
coffee stall in the morning. Mary Dashwood sleeping in the streets! Fancy it!
To-day I discovered where Mrs. Speed had gone, and I am here to demand the
return of our goods and chattels. But I can quite understand why you are
here."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Lady Dashwood faltered.</p>
<p>"Well, I will tell you. When I went to Mrs. Speed's to share rooms with
Connie I was struck by the appearance of the woman. It seemed to me that I had
seen her before, and in some strange way she recalled my very early childhood.
I seemed to recollect the creature years and years ago sitting in your boudoir
and crying. She was wearing a black dress. It is one of the fragments of memory
that cling to one long after the surrounding circumstances are forgotten. I
could not get rid of the feeling, and I asked the woman about it. She said I
must be mistaken, because she came from a place called Dashwood, near Dashwood
Hall. I doubt if she knew my name. I had my own reasons for not betraying my
identity as you can imagine, but when Mrs. Speed told me that, I knew that I
was not mistaken. And knowing that she came from the old place, I was not
surprised to see you here after all."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood's agitation deepened. Mary could see that she was greatly
moved.</p>
<p>"The woman spoke the truth," the elder lady whispered, "her people lived on
the estate for many generations. And for years I have lost sight of her. I
can't tell you the story, Mary, because it is not all mine to tell. And this
morning I received a telegram from Mrs. Speed at this address saying that she
was in great trouble and asking for an interview. I did not send any answer to
the telegram because I decided to come in person. When things are explained,
they always become more simple."</p>
<p>"Not in this case," Mary said boldly. "My dear, I have found out something
far more important than that Mrs. Speed comes from Dashwood. I was going to the
kitchen to get a glass of milk yesterday morning when I heard what sounded like
a quarrel in the dining-room between Mrs. Speed and some man. The man's voice
sounded so familiar to me that I stopped to listen. He was after some letters,
the name of Dashwood was mentioned&mdash;one letter was of the greatest
importance. And then the man came out; he did not see me, but I recognised him.
Can you guess who he was?"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood made no reply for the moment. Her face had grown very pale and
her long, slim hand shook so that the rings on her fingers shimmered in the
light.</p>
<p>"You had better tell me," she ventured to say at length. "I fancy I can
guess, though I had not expected treachery as black as this. The man
was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sir Vincent Dashwood. Oh, there is no mistake about it. I saw him as
plainly as I see you at this moment. He had called at Keppel Terrace to
threaten and bully. It seems that he had had all Mrs. Speed's savings. And he
told her that if he could have that particular letter he would let her have as
much money as she needed. She spoke then of the danger in which she stood in
regard to her rent. She was going to see the agent of the property the same
day. Probably he would not wait any longer, and hence the sudden flitting in
the night. What does it all mean, Lady Dashwood? Why should this Sir Vincent
want that letter? And how much longer are we all going to remain under the
tyranny of that man?"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood made no reply. There was a sound of voices close by, and in
one of them Mary recognised the querulous tones of Mrs. Speed.</p>
<p>"Go and see her," Mary said, "I will wait here. But please do not disclose
my identity. And when you have finished, wait in the street for me. My business
with Mrs. Speed will not take long. After that, I want you to come and see my
new friends, I want you to know what manner of life I am living. There are
other things that I shall want to know too, but they will keep for the
present."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-44" id="ch-44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV&mdash;THE DREARY WAY</h2>
<p>Mary's patience was fairly well tried before she had an opportunity of
seeing Mrs. Speed. She heard the latter cry out in astonishment at the sight of
Lady Dashwood; she heard the two take their way up the uncarpeted stairs; she
could hear restless footsteps overhead. It was quite an hour before they came
down. Mary could not quite hear what was passing, but she heard enough to know
that Mrs. Speed was in tears.</p>
<p>The tears gave way to a sullen red as Mary came out of the dining-room. She
said nothing as the girl beckoned her into the room and shut the door.</p>
<p>"We need not waste any time," Mary said, "you will guess what I came
for."</p>
<p>"Who told you where to find me?" was the terrified question in a whisper.
"You don't mean to say that in Keppel Terrace they know already&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not concerned as to what Keppel Terrace knows or thinks," Mary said
coldly. "I came back to our rooms last night very late with Miss Colam. To our
great surprise and consternation we found the house empty. Our own things had
gone with the rest. You might have left them, as they did not belong to you.
Miss Colam, who has had more experience in the seamy side of life than I have,
says that this midnight flitting is quite usual with a certain class of people.
She gave me an experience of a friend of hers, but in that case her belongings
were left behind. What did you suppose that we were going to do?"</p>
<p>The woman shook her head sullenly. With her wider knowledge of the world she
seemed to think that she had an easy prey in Mary.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said, "and I didn't care. I've been too badly used by
the world to have much sympathy left for other people. And I had to move. The
agent told me that he was going to put an execution in to-day, and I had no
time to lose. I don't want to keep your traps and things; I daresay they are
here somewhere. Come again in a few days' time, and I will see what I can do
for you. I'm busy now."</p>
<p>The speaker advanced half threateningly towards Mary, with an intention of
bustling her out of the room. Mary's eyes flashed angrily as she stood before
the door.</p>
<p>"Now listen to me," she said in clear, incisive tones. "As a landlady of
experience in such matters you must know that it is almost impossible for Miss
Colam and myself to obtain other lodgings without our boxes and things. Last
night we slept out of doors because we had nowhere to go. You think that
because you live so far away from Keppel Terrace you can do as you like. If I
go from here now without our belongings I shall at once see the agent of the
Keppel Terrace property and tell him where you are to be found. I can easily
get the address of the agent from the people next door to your last house. I
don't know much about the law, but you can be punished for this kind of thing,
I feel quite certain. Now what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>The battle was over almost as soon as it had begun. The woman lost her
threatening air and her face became pleading. The easy tears fell from her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't want to do anything wrong," she said, "only you don't know
all the trouble and anxiety that I've been put to. When I came to London first
I had money in the bank and a good house of furniture, very different from the
miserable sticks I have about me now. I was doing well. Oh, you think you know
what trouble is and misery, but wait till you see the son you have loved and
slaved for grow up to be a curse and a blight to you; I sacrificed everything
for that boy and he has ruined me. He gets money from everybody, he has had all
mine, and I go on giving him more. He never comes near me unless he wants
something. If you knew everything, you would be sorry for me."</p>
<p>Mary made no reply for the moment. She was piecing the puzzle rapidly
together in her mind. She was wondering what the connection was between the
erring son and the man who called himself Sir Vincent Dashwood. She would have
asked a question or two, but it did not seem discreet to do so at this
moment.</p>
<p>"At present I need all my sympathy for Miss Colam and myself," Mary said
coldly. "You will be good enough to find our boxes. There is a desk of mine
that I need, a little desk in a leather case. I shall be glad to know that it
is safe."</p>
<p>"I think I saw it a little while ago," Mrs. Speed said eagerly. She seemed
quite anxious to make amends now. "I fancy it was in one of the bed-rooms. I
hope you will believe me, miss when I tell you that I had clean forgotten all
about you two young ladies. You see, I had to get away at a moment's notice.
There was the house to find and the van to arrange for. One way and another I
was fairly worked off my feet. If you'll come along with me now, I'll see what
I can do for you. There's a great pile of boxes upstairs."</p>
<p>Most of the missing boxes were identified at last, but they were more or
less buried under a great heap of things. Mary gave a sigh of relief to find
that the precious writing-case was intact and the lock unbroken. And there was
a box of hers on the top of the pile, and in that she knew was all that she
would require for a day or two. If she could get that away she would be able to
supply Connie with what was necessary in the way of linen. And it would be as
well to leave the rest until she had procured fresh lodgings.</p>
<p>"Get your woman to call a cab," she said, "I'll take this box with me and
the others can remain till we are ready for them. Directly we have somewhere to
go I will send you a telegram with the address, and you will give our
belongings to one of the carriers."</p>
<p>"You may depend on that, miss," Mrs. Speed said eagerly, "I'm sorry this
happened, I am indeed. If I had only thought of it I would have given you a
hint before. Now I'll go and see if I can get a cab for you."</p>
<p>The cab was procured at length and the precious box hoisted on the top. Lady
Dashwood was patiently waiting at the end of the road. The cab pulled up, and
Mary hailed her friend eagerly. A great weight had fallen from her mind, she
could see the way clear for the future now. If misfortune dogged her, she had
made up her mind to go back to the dower house. But now she was spared that
blow to her pride.</p>
<p>She wondered, with a tender smile on her lips, if Ralph Darnley would call
this the proper kind of pride. In her mind Mary decided that he would. It would
be possible now to arrange to stay for the present under the same roof with
Grace Cameron. Then Mary remembered with dismay that her ready cash had been
locked up in a box, and that the box in question was not on the top of the cab.
Not that she was afraid of anything happening to the money; still, money was
urgently needed.</p>
<p>The jewels were safe anyway&mdash;they reposed in the cab on the seat
opposite to Mary. And Lady Dashwood was seated by her side. The girl was in
high spirits: tired as she was, she was happier than she had been for years. It
came to her now that she had an object in life, something definite to live for.
She was doing good in the world; her eyes had been opened to the nobility of
life as lived by the brave poor. What a poor thing the Dashwood pride seemed by
comparison.</p>
<p>"You must know that I have been entirely successful," Mary said gaily. Lady
Dashwood had never heard her speak in this tone of voice before. "I have
bearded the lioness in her den and actually got the better of her. I am more
than pleased with the success of my scheme and the way in which I have worked
it out, Lady Dashwood. Please don't tell me that you are going back home by an
early train."</p>
<p>"I should like to go back at once and take you with me, child," Lady
Dashwood said. "You don't know how lonely I am without you! And yet I am quite
sure that you are learning a valuable lesson in these sordid surroundings."</p>
<p>Mary's face flushed with pleasure. A few days before she would have resented
a suggestion like that from Lady Dashwood or anybody else. Her mind had been
closed to everything, had been too proud to learn. And now Lady Dashwood's
remark was a compliment.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said softly, "I am learning a great lesson&mdash;the lesson of
humanity. It is astonishing how my mental vision has cleared already. I blush
with shame to think of the uselessness of my past life. But you will come with
me and see the dear companions who have taught me this lesson?"</p>
<p>"I think I will," Lady Dashwood said, "I need not get home till the last
train. I have half promised to dine informally with an old friend of mine in
Stratton Street. I shall have plenty of time to see your friends. I am quite
sure that they are ladies; you could not be happy with them otherwise."</p>
<p>"Oh, they are," Mary cried, "and now I am going to tell you all about them
and their hopes and ambitions. Grace's story is quite a pretty romance in its
way. It will tell you all about her, so that you need not betray your lack of
knowledge."</p>
<p>Mary rambled on in a pleasant way until the cab reached its destination.
There was a pure, womanly ring in her voice that Lady Dashwood noted with
gladness. She had always deemed Mary too hard and cold, too unsympathetic to
the weaknesses and failings of other people. The elder lady's eyes were moist
as she descended from the cab, and Mary guessed the reason. And then it came to
her, too, that she would have been glad if Ralph Darnley had been with
them.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-45" id="ch-45"></a>CHAPTER XLV&mdash;THE WALLS OF PRIDE</h2>
<p>"Now I must get you to pay for the cab," Mary went on in the same gay voice,
"for I haven't the money, at least, not in my pocket. You will find the place
very small and mean, but it is not quite so bad as some of the cottages on the
Dashwood estate. If ever good fortune took me back there as mistress I should
do a great deal with the cottages on the place. I begin to understand now how
trying is the lot of the poor. But I am dreaming again. Please come this
way."</p>
<p>Grace Cameron lay on a couch in the window getting as much fresh air as
possible. Towards her Lady Dashwood looked with special interest, for Mary had
told Grace's story at some length. The girl flushed as she noted the striking
personality of her visitor. She essayed to rise from the sofa.</p>
<p>"No, don't you move, my dear," Lady Dashwood said. "Quite by accident I met
Mary here, and she insisted upon bringing me to see you both. I think she has
told me everything about you. And it was quite natural that I should like to
see you. So this is Connie Colam. I think you are a couple of very brave
girls."</p>
<p>And Lady Dashwood proceeded to kiss them both in the most natural manner.
She found her way into their hearts at once.</p>
<p>"You are a darling," Connie said in her candid manner. "It is good of you,
Lady Dashwood. We were eating our hearts out with anxiety when Mary came in.
And Mary looks quite the conquering hero, I declare."</p>
<p>"Victory!" Mary cried, "my clever detective scheme has been quite
successful. I have brought all we need with me, and the rest will follow on the
despatch of a telegram. I have had a long interview with Mrs. Speed, and so far
as I can see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I hope you gave her what she deserved," Connie cried.</p>
<p>"I'm ashamed to say I didn't," Mary confessed. "The poor woman appeared to
be in distress. She said that she had forgotten all about us, and I believed
her. It seems that she has a dissipated, selfish son who has brought her to
this pass&mdash;Lady Dashwood, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"The London heat always tries me like this," Lady Dashwood murmured faintly,
"I daresay I shall be quite myself when I have had a cup of tea. Connie shall
make it for me&mdash;Mary says that she has the real art of tea-making. So this
is the place where you work. You look as if a good rest would do you good,
Grace."</p>
<p>Grace Cameron smiled wearily. It was one of her bad days, and the heat had
affected her. Her mind was filled now with pictures of the sea breaking cool
over the rocks; she thought of deep woods where the breeze played in the
trees.</p>
<p>"I can't afford to rest," she said; "if I did not go on working I should
lose my reason. And I do hate London so. Still, I have a mother more or less
dependent upon me, and for her sake I have to go on. If I could manage to get
into the country for a few weeks I think I could regain strength. Connie is an
angel of goodness, but I can't let her do my work for me much longer."</p>
<p>"That's sinful pride," Connie said with something between a laugh and a sob.
"What vexes her is that her substitute is so poor a workman. Still, there is a
deal in what Grace says, and if she could be in the country, not too far away
from London, where&mdash;"</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood glanced up and met Mary's pleading eyes. She understood
exactly what the girl meant without asking a single question. She crossed over
to the couch and took Grace's thin white hand tenderly in her own.</p>
<p>"There is nothing easier," she said, "let me be the fairy godmother. I am a
very lonely old woman, since Mary made up her mind that she would go out into
the world and earn her own living. I was very sad about it at the time, but I
am not so sad now. Because the day is coming when Mary will return to her old
home, and be happier by far than she has ever been before. Still, I am very
lonely now, and I should welcome some bright young face to gladden the whole
home and make life more tolerable to me. The dower house is a grand old place,
and any artist would soon fall in love with it. Bring your work down there,
Gracie, come and live in the open air and forget your anxiety for the future.
When I looked at Mary just now, her eyes asked me to do this thing. But I am
not doing it to please Mary so much as to please myself. It is very selfish of
me, I know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Selfish!" Grace cried, "I could love you for what you say. The mere thought
of it makes my heart beat all the faster. But for the sake of
others&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind the others," Connie cried, "go away and get well. I dare not
think what I should do if I had the same opportunity. Go away and do your own
work. How can you have the face to stay here and allow me to do your drawings
for you? It is the most selfish thing I ever heard of in my life, and I decline
to put up with it any longer...Oh, my dear, it is the very thing that I
have been praying for. Don't hesitate, Grace&mdash;think of your mother, of the
grand future. If I loved you less than I do&mdash;"</p>
<p>The smile faded from Connie's face, she had hard work to keep back the
tears. Lady Dashwood's smile, too, was watery and unsteady. She was glad to
find that Mary had fallen in with companions like these. She could understand
now why the girl had softened and improved. Hitherto she had regarded Mary as
perfect, but this was a chastened and purified Mary of whom she had never
dreamed. She could see the working of Grace's mind in her face.</p>
<p>"You are very good to me," the girl said slowly, "everybody is good to me. I
never knew how much goodness there was in the world till my health began to
fail. It made me hard and bitter to see those frivolous society people roll by
in their carriages, and think that the money they wasted on one abandoned toy
would have sufficed to give me back the strength I needed. Mary knows what I
mean."</p>
<p>"I do, indeed," Mary said with a flush on her face, "but I had to pay for my
knowledge of my selfish folly by the loss of everything that I held most dear.
And now that I have learned my lesson, I have nothing to put it into practice
with. Still, the point does not refer to Lady Dashwood, who is quite sincere in
what she says. If you hesitate any longer, Grace, I shall regard myself as a
murderess. You will not carry your pride so far as to endanger your life."</p>
<p>"No, no," Grace cried, "you are all right and I am wrong. I know perfectly
well that if I stay here like this I shall die. Therefore, with the deepest
gratitude, I have decided to accept Lady Dashwood's offer. Oh, if you only knew
how I long for the sight of a green tree&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then that is settled," Lady Dashwood said, "you are to come and take Mary's
place without delay. I will come up on Saturday and fetch you. And I decline to
hear a single word of thanks&mdash;it is a mutual pleasure, Grace. Now, let us
have the cup of tea, and then I must be going. And I am very glad that Mary has
made friends with you girls."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood departed presently, and for a little time the girls were
silent. Grace lay there looking out of the window, her eyes filled with happy
tears. Already in her imagination she could hear the murmur of the trees over
her head.</p>
<p>"I can't help it," she said presently, "I feel as if a great doctor had told
me to live after another surgeon had passed the sentence of death. An hour ago
I did not seem to care what happened, now I can feel the joy of life in my
finger tips. My ambition is singing a tale of hope in my ears...But what
about you both? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what are we going to do?" Connie said in tones of dismay, "we have no
money. Mary was too proud to ask her relation for any, which was quite right.
Unless, perhaps, Mary has recovered her purse, in which case&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, I haven't," Mary explained, "I forgot all about it. Still, it is only
a matter of a day or so, and, meanwhile, I have something that will do quite as
well. I daresay Grace's landlady will find us a spare bedroom."</p>
<p>"I believe there is such a thing in the house," Grace said dubiously, "but
my landlady is by no means a nice person, and she has done very well lately.
She is sure to ask to see your boxes, and if you tell her the truth she will
not believe you. Still, you must find quarters somewhere for to-night, and it
would do no harm to have the woman up and see her."</p>
<p>The landlady came, hard of face and none too pleasant of manner. She
listened in grim disapproval. She did not wish to insinuate anything, but she
had suffered in the past. She attached a value to the possession of personal
belongings, she had little faith in lodgers who came without them. To all this
Mary listened with a heightened colour and a rising temper.</p>
<p>"I suppose a week, or say a fortnight's rent in advance would do for you?"
she asked. "It seems the likeliest arrangement for a woman of your stamp."</p>
<p>"Nothing better, miss," the woman retorted, "money talks. Pay a sovereign on
account, and I shall have no more to say. Pay me, and I'll treat you well; on
the other hand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is going to be no 'other hand,'" Mary replied with her head in the
air. "Perhaps you will be so good as to change me a five-pound note?"</p>
<p>The woman gasped. She could not possibly do such a thing.</p>
<p>"Very well," Mary went on, serene in her victory, "you need not stay any
longer. I'll go out and get change, and let you have the sovereign without
delay."</p>
<p>The woman vanished with a respectful salutation. Mary crossed over to her
writing-case.</p>
<p>"My education is growing apace," she laughed, "my dearest Connie, will you
be so good as to tell me the way to the nearest pawn-broker's?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-46" id="ch-46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI&mdash;THE HEAD OF THE
HOUSE</h2>
<p>The lights in the great silver candlesticks at the dower house shed a soft
radiance over the dinner-table where Lady Dashwood sat alone. It was not yet
dark, the saffron glow of the setting sun still struggled with the candles.
Most of the dishes had been removed, and little remained but the peaches and
the nectarines and the great bloom tinted grapes in the silver baskets.</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood sat there alone. She had peeled one of the russet and golden
peaches, but the fragrant luscious fruit lay neglected on her plate. Her mind
was far away from her surroundings.</p>
<p>The peacefulness of the night suited her more or less painful meditations.
The same spirit of refinement and rest seemed to brood over the house; it
seemed hard to associate a place like that with misery. And, perhaps, on the
whole, Lady Dashwood was not altogether unhappy.</p>
<p>She had more or less expected Ralph Darnley to dinner, but he had declined
at the last moment. He had written to say that he might have the pleasure of
coming later, but even as to that he was not quite certain.</p>
<p>And so it came about that Lady Dashwood was alone. She had plenty of food
for thought. There was yesterday's adventure, for instance, the finding of Mary
in that unexpected way, and the visit to Grace Cameron's rooms.</p>
<p>Well, Lady Dashwood was not sorry that she had been, she was not sorry
either that Mary had made up her mind to try her future in London. In some
subtle way Mary had vastly improved. She had always shown a proper affection
for Lady Dashwood, she loved her passionately, but she had always been somewhat
reserved. She had not thought it right for a Dashwood to be demonstrative like
other people. And she had cared very little for the sufferings of other
people.</p>
<p>And now all this was changed. Mary had made the great discovery that she was
only human after all, and had begun to take an interest in sorrow, suffering
and gladness, and pleasure. Lady Dashwood was glad of that. Her own life had
been one of constant self-repression. Perhaps that was all the more reason why
she longed for an open display of affection now.</p>
<p>She was pleased to find that Mary was learning her lesson and that Ralph
Darnley had been right. Ralph had prophesied from the first that all Mary
needed was the fire of adversity to burn the alloy out of her system, and leave
nothing but the pure gold behind. And his policy had been wonderfully
successful.</p>
<p>But how much longer was this to continue? was the question that Lady
Dashwood asked herself.</p>
<p>How long before Ralph would declare himself, and sweep away the blight that
hung over Dashwood Hall at the present moment. Already people were beginning to
talk, already the servants had strange tales to tell. Dubious men were staying
at the Hall, a class of beings quite unknown to that historic house.</p>
<p>Sir Vincent Dashwood was entertaining a party at dinner to-night; he had
brought his friends down from London with him earlier in the day. As yet nobody
had called upon the new owner of Dashwood Hall, for people were holding aloof.
They wondered, too, why the deposed head of the house had cared to stay on
there. What Mary was actually doing in London was not known to anybody outside
the home circle, but her action was approved of. Lady Dashwood hoped that the
present state of things was not likely to last; she was going to ask Ralph to
see Mary and judge for himself whether the punishment had not already gone far
enough. Mary had had her eyes opened and would never be her cold, proud self
again.</p>
<p>The peach was finished slowly, and Lady Dashwood was thinking of rising from
the table. This solitary dining in state was a terrible trial to her. She had
reached the time of life when she craved for young people to be about her. The
house was very quiet, so quiet that the loud clang of the front door bell
fairly startled Lady Dashwood. She placed her hand to her heart in some
alarm.</p>
<p>Surely something dreadful had happened! No friend of the family would ever
ring the bell like that. It was, perhaps, a late telegram to say that
Mary&mdash;but the noisy voices in the hall did not suggest any catastrophe.
Two or three people were talking at once; Lady Dashwood was sure she could
smell tobacco smoke. Somebody laughed in a loud, vulgar way. What could it all
mean?</p>
<p>The staid butler came into the dining-room, his manner respectful as always,
but there was a flush on his face.</p>
<p>"My good Charles," Lady Dashwood exclaimed, "what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Your ladyship may well ask that question," the aggrieved butler replied,
"but I beg your ladyship's pardon, I am forgetting myself. We were sitting down
to supper in the housekeeper's room when that ring startled us. I went to the
door. Sir Vincent Dashwood was there, and those other men,&mdash;I mean
gentlemen, together with Sir George,&mdash;I mean Mr. Dashwood. And they want
to see your ladyship."</p>
<p>"At this time of night! Are they mad, Charles? Is it possible that gentlemen
who are perfect strangers to me&mdash;are smoking in my hall? Are
they&mdash;are they&mdash;sober?"</p>
<p>"I think so, your ladyship," Charles said dubiously. "Mr. Dashwood is all
right. As to the rest, I really cannot say. But they are bent upon seeing you,
at least Sir Vincent is. He&mdash;he seems to think that you would find it nice
and informal."</p>
<p>"Informal, certainly," Lady Dashwood said frostily. "Ask them into the
library."</p>
<p>The speaker was outwardly calm. But she was shaking with a righteous
indignation; a brilliant red spot flamed on either cheek. It was a very
haughty, stately figure that entered the library, a few moments later.</p>
<p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," she said. "You will pardon my
old-fashioned ways, but I am not accustomed to entertain strangers at this
hour."</p>
<p>"That's all right;" the head of the house laughed unsteadily. His eyes were
slightly glazed and he had some difficulty in balancing himself. "It's all
right, grandmother. Mr. Dashwood did not want to come; he said it wasn't quite
the thing."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of that," Lady Dashwood said haughtily. Her cold eyes swept over
the figure of George Dashwood, who stood by the doorway a picture of confusion.
"Mr. Dashwood was right, and as to these friends of yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They're all right," the head of the house went on. "Mr. Cotton and Mr.
Newfell, my grandmother. Cotton is something in the City, made a pile of money
there. When he isn't making money he spends his spare time in going over old
houses. I told him about this one, and he is anxious to see it. It is just the
kind of place he wants to buy, and if he offers me a fancy price for it, you
will have to find somewhere else to go, old lady."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood stood there trembling. She had no words to meet this
unpardonable insult. And the speaker was quite within his right. He was in a
position to sell the dower house if he chose. The head of the family had that
privilege, seeing that the little property formed no part of the settled
estate.</p>
<p>"I am afraid Lady Dashwood objects," the man called Cotton said.</p>
<p>"Indeed I should, sir," Lady Dashwood replied. "I am afraid I can't blame
you so much as my&mdash;my grandson for this unpardonable intrusion."</p>
<p>The City man flushed, but he had the grace to say nothing. The head of the
house fairly tingled.</p>
<p>"Insult be hanged," he cried, "what are you talking about? We only looked in
just to give my friend Cotton some idea of the place. I'm not anxious to sell.
It's a thirsty night, you fellows. Ring the bell, somebody, and ask the butler
for a whisky and soda."</p>
<p>"Better not," Cotton said, "it isn't quite the thing. Besides, you have had
enough already. I can see that we ought not to have come here at all."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood felt almost grateful to the speaker. There was silence for a
moment, and then from the hall came the sound of Ralph Darnley's voice. Here
was somebody at any rate who could grapple with the situation. Forgetful of her
real dignity, Lady Dashwood turned away and crossed over to the hall. She was
shaking from head to foot now and the tears had gathered in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You poor dear soul," Ralph whispered, as he kissed the trembling lips.
"Charles has been telling me all about it. He was so full of the matter that he
almost forgot himself. So you are already enjoying the fruits of the change of
proprietorship. Go back to the drawing-room and compose yourself. I will soon
get rid of those men for you."</p>
<p>Ralph strode into the library. His fingers were itching to be at the throats
of the men. But that could not be. He was so angry that his politeness was
exaggerated.</p>
<p>"Lady Dashwood is very sorry," he said, "but you will have to excuse her
to-night. She is not accustomed to visitors, especially at this time in the
evening. Sir Vincent, your display of family affection is a little too
exuberant."</p>
<p>"I did not want to come, sir," Cotton said sulkily.</p>
<p>"Thank you; therefore you will not mind going. Good-night, gentlemen.
Good-night, Mr. Dashwood. You will pardon me, I am sure. Well?"</p>
<p>For the head of the family sat sullenly in his chair though the rest had got
beyond the shadow of the front door by this time. He looked up defiantly at
Ralph.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-47" id="ch-47"></a>CHAPTER XLVII&mdash;"HOW LONG, HOW
LONG!"</h2>
<p>"If it isn't a rude question," he said, "who are you? What do you mean by
interfering in this way?"</p>
<p>"It does not matter in the least who I am," Ralph replied. "To put it
bluntly, Lady Dashwood has asked me to get rid of you. Until you have disposed
of this portion of the property, the house belongs to her ladyship. Your
dissolute companions have already gone. I don't blame them, however. I have no
doubt that they expected a congenial welcome here. They probably drew a wrong
picture altogether of Lady Dashwood. They had the grace to be ashamed of
themselves."</p>
<p>"Once more," Dashwood said with drunken gravity, "who are you?"</p>
<p>"As I said before, it does not in the least matter," Ralph replied. "At the
present moment I am acting on behalf of Lady Dashwood. I know that it is not
the slightest good to appeal to your better feelings, for the simple reason
that they don't exist. Will you be so good as to go, or am I to resort to
force?"</p>
<p>Dashwood laughed. The hot blood mounted to Ralph's face and the full force
of his passion tingled to his finger-tips. He threw open the long window that
led to the lawn; then he advanced to the figure lounging in the chair. He
wasted no time in argument, but bent over the chair and dragged Dashwood out by
the throat. A moment later the latter was flung violently on to the grass,
where he lay dazed and confused for a moment. Presently he picked himself up,
and loafed after his companions, who were noisily walking down the avenue. It
was a relief to Ralph to know that the fellow was not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>As if nothing had happened, he made his way to the dining-room. Lady
Dashwood was pacing up and down the room, her face white and set, her eyes full
of flaming anger. All the fiery blood of the race was raging in her veins
now.</p>
<p>"So they have gone," she cried. "A pretty outrage indeed! I shall have the
villagers here next dropping in on their way from the inn of a Saturday night.
Have men of that class no manners, no respect for the feelings of others?"</p>
<p>"You can't altogether blame them," Ralph said soothingly. "Probably they
took you to be what that drunken ruffian yonder would call 'a good sort.' They
judged you by him, and I am quite sure that Mr. George Dashwood did all he
could&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He didn't," Lady Dashwood flashed out. "He is a coward and a poltroon. He
is not worthy to be the father of a girl like Mary. Fancy him cringing and
fawning on a man like that for the sake of a good home and the dainty food that
he loves better than his independence! But I don't blame him and the man who
calls himself Sir Vincent Dashwood so much as I blame you."</p>
<p>"Me!" Ralph asked in some surprise, "what have I done?"</p>
<p>"Everything. You have brought all this about. If it had not been for you,
this disgraceful scene could not have happened. For purposes of your own, you
have placed a puppet on the throne at Dashwood&mdash;a disgraceful, drunken
image, that is not worthy to be called a man. Why do you do it?"</p>
<p>"I think you know perfectly well," Ralph said gently. "I am very, very
sorry; I could not have foreseen anything like this. Won't you forgive me?"</p>
<p>All the hot, rebellious anger died out of Lady Dashwood's heart.</p>
<p>"I must, when you speak to me like that," she said. "When you look at me
with your father's eyes, and speak to me with his voice, I could find it in me
to forgive you anything. But you must own that it is very hard to bear, Ralph.
When you came back here like a figure from the grave, I began to hope that God
was going to be good to me in my declining years. I have sinned heavily, but I
have paid the penalty. When I saw you that day at the fire I recognised you at
once, as Slight had done. My prayers had been answered, and one of my flesh and
blood had come back to claim the old inheritance. And you had come to free me
from the hateful attentions of the impostor who so grievously insulted me
to-night. But you did nothing of the sort; you tried to hide yourself from me
as if you were guilty of something shameful."</p>
<p>"But, my dear grandmother, I told you why," Ralph protested. "I had to work
out my life's romance in a way that seemed best to me. And Fate played into my
hands&mdash;the little affair of the silver match-box forced the so-called
Dashwood to speak. Still, it will not be for long. I saw the family solicitors
yesterday&mdash;they are by no means disposed to let matters remain as they
are. Have you any idea as to the real identity of the man who calls himself Sir
Vincent Dashwood?"</p>
<p>"I had," Lady Dashwood said. "But I was certain yesterday. I saw his mother.
Oh, but yesterday was a day of surprises."</p>
<p>"His mother," Ralph cried. "Is she still alive? She was Agnes Edgerton,
sister of my father's first wife. Is not that so?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely correct, but I did not know it till yesterday; I thought that
she was dead long since. I have never heard a word of her since she left the
village seventeen years ago. And because she knew of my crime, because she knew
of the great sin that hangs over the house, she wrote to me and asked me to
help her. It appears that she had been residing in London at a place called
Keppel Terrace, where she has tried to live by letting lodgings."</p>
<p>"That much I know," Ralph said. "She wrote to my father from time to time.
What I did not know is that she had a son. Please go on."</p>
<p>"It was a most pitiful letter she wrote me. She was going to lose her home
if she did not receive a certain sum by a certain time. The letter came too
late for me to help. It was followed by a telegram asking me to send the money
to another address. Had you not come into my life, had things been different, I
should have sent the money and thought no more about it. But things came into
my mind and a vague suspicion that I felt bound to verify. I went to London
yesterday and I saw Mrs. Speed. She told me that it was her son who had brought
her to this pass. Of course, up to that time I had no idea she had a son. I
asked her to show me his photograph, and she did so. You can guess whose
likeness it was?"</p>
<p>"I can guess now," Ralph said. "Of course, it was the man who is at present
master of Dashwood Hall. Did the woman know that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, no. She has not the least idea. But you can see now where the
impostor got all his knowledge, and how he came into possession of so many
documents."</p>
<p>"Not quite," Ralph said, "I want a little light on this particular
spot."</p>
<p>"Well, that is easy. When your father fell in love with his first wife,
Maria Edgerton, they took the sister Agnes, now Mrs. Speed, into their
confidence. She received and kept all the letters, at least, she seems to have
kept the letters after Maria Edgerton died. Of course, when the affair came to
the ears of your grandfather and myself we were terribly annoyed. Mind you, I
had nothing whatever to say against Maria Edgerton. She was very good and
beautiful, but very simple indeed, and ignorant of the ways of the world. We
thought that we had put an end to the affair, but we failed, and your father
and Maria Edgerton were secretly married. Even then we had hopes of hushing up
the scandal. Your father had to go away with his regiment, and we persuaded his
wife that he was dead. I did that, and old Patience helped me. And so did
Slight&mdash;we were all in the disgraceful business. Don't ask me why I did
it; call it the curse of the family pride if you like. We thought the woman
would go away and forget. Instead of that she pined and died. When the news
came to me I felt like a murderess. I have never been the same woman again, I
never shall be. And your father found it all out, he came home, and there was a
dreadful scene. He went away declaring that he would never come home again, and
he kept his word. I dared not write to him directly, but sent my letters
through Mrs. Speed. Now you can understand how her son has come to be so well
posted in the secret history of our house. He must have read and re-read those
letters till he had them by heart. But his mother did not know, she does not
guess. How much longer is this state of affairs to continue, Ralph?"</p>
<p>Ralph shook his head. These revelations came as a surprise to him. And it
was a very sad and very dreadful confession that Lady Dashwood had made to
him.</p>
<p>"All that I have heard confirms me in my opinion that I have acted for the
best," he said. "I cannot absolve you from blame, grandmother, indeed I cannot.
For the sake of the family pride, you have suffered this remorse for nearly
forty years. And yet, in the face of it all, knowing that Mary was coming into
the property some day, you fostered the same spirit in her. I love Mary, and
the one great object in my life is to make her my wife. But I wanted to be
loved for my own sake, and not for the sake of the family fetish. My
plan&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is succeeding," Lady Dashwood cried. "Nay, it has succeeded already. Go and
see Mary, call on her and ascertain for yourself whether I am speaking the
truth or not. She has only been gone a few days, but already the change has
worked wonders. Put your future to the touch, and you will not be disappointed.
Only end this dreadful state of affairs, turn that man out of the Hall, let me
see the place sweet and wholesome again before I die."</p>
<p>Ralph hesitated. It was a tempting picture that Lady Dashwood had drawn for
him. But he could not quite entertain the idea that already Mary had changed
her nature entirely, as a grub turns to a butterfly. At the same time Lady
Dashwood's plea was not one to be turned from lightly.</p>
<p>"I will see Mary," he said, "I will go to her tomorrow. I must see Mrs.
Speed also, for I have a message to deliver to her from my father. You see, I
had no idea where to look for her. Patience my dear, dear lady, patience. After
the lapse of forty years you will not mind waiting for a few days longer."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-48" id="ch-48"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII&mdash;FACE TO FACE</h2>
<p>"You are getting on," Connie cried, "after a time you will become a Radical.
Already you are fast forgetting the caste of Vere de Vere, especially after
your visit to the pawnbroker's yesterday. Tell me, did you feel very much
afraid?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, I didn't," Mary laughed. "It was not such a dreadful experience
after all. You see, I had the face of our landlady before my eyes. I tried to
think of nothing but the fact that we had another night out of doors before us.
I don't believe I even trembled as I placed a diamond ring on the counter and
asked a loan of five pounds on it. Perhaps I was just a little afraid of being
given in custody on a charge of dealing with stolen goods. Ah! the glow of
satisfaction when I found that money in my pocket! Will you believe me, Connie
dear, I was thinking nothing about myself, but about you and Grace. And when I
got back here and saw your faces it was the happiest moment in my life."</p>
<p>Connie kissed the speaker affectionately. She was genuinely touched, though
she did not care to own it. She pointed to the brushes and paints on the
table.</p>
<p>"Well, don't be prodigal," she said. "I've managed to get you five hundred
cards to paint and they will take you a whole week. And now I'll go and find
some fresh work to do. Thanks to Mrs. Speed's exit, I have lost my Wheezer job.
As the drawings were not on time I've been told that I need not ask for any
more work. It is such a pity, because it was such regular, steady
employment."</p>
<p>Connie spoke lightly, but Mary could see she felt it. She painted on at her
cards till nearly luncheon-time, until her back ached and her fingers were
almost too stiff to hold a brush. But there was peace and contentment in her
heart, a feeling of happiness and gladness that she had never felt before. She
took a glass of milk and a bun presently, and then put on her hat to go as far
as Mrs. Speed's. Though the promised telegram had been sent, the necessary
boxes had not turned up yet. And Mary was getting anxious. She would go and
fetch the boxes; in the circumstances, the luxury of a cab would be
justified.</p>
<p>Mary swung along the street with a free step and a sense of joyful elation.
She had not gone far before somebody touched her lightly on the shoulder. She
started and turned to find herself face to face with Ralph Darnley. He looked
bronzed and well. The tan on his handsome face brought with it a whiff of the
country. There was no mistaking the genuine pleasure that shone in his eyes as
he held Mary's hand in his.</p>
<p>"I called at your rooms," he said, "and they told me that you had just gone
out. I followed quickly with wonderful luck. Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Off to the wilds of North London," Mary laughed. She felt a strange sense
of gladness in the presence of Ralph; a certain shy happiness possessed her.
"Our late landlady went off with our boxes. We had to sleep out the night
before last."</p>
<p>"So Lady Dashwood told me," Ralph replied. "It must have been a dreadful
experience. And yet you look very well and happy, Mary."</p>
<p>The girl laughed in a shy kind of way.</p>
<p>"I really believe I am," she confessed. "Mind you, it was very dreadful at
first. I felt so utterly lost and sad that I very nearly came back and
proclaimed my defeat."</p>
<p>"At the expense of the family pride?" Ralph laughed.</p>
<p>"Yes," Mary said quietly with a flush on her face. "I am coming to the
conclusion that the family pride is a great mistake. It made me so cold and
self-contained. I never seemed to know what it was to have sympathy for
anybody. To be a Dashwood is a great thing, of course. But there are far higher
and nobler aims. Those two girls I live with made me thoroughly ashamed of
myself. They are ladies who get their own living by art work&mdash;but, of
course, you know all about Connie Colam. What a nature she has!"</p>
<p>"One of the noblest in the world," Ralph said quietly. "Mary, I hoped that
you would grow like her. I hoped that her example would be a benefit to you.
With your beauty and her disposition, you would be one of the most perfect
women that God ever made. Ah, the man will be lucky indeed who calls Connie
Colam his wife."</p>
<p>Mary assented warmly enough, and yet at the same time she was conscious of
just a tinge of passing jealousy at the high praise of her friend. Ralph had
told her all along that he loved her, that there was no other girl in the world
for him. Had her coldness killed that love? Then she told herself that it did
not matter, seeing that the affection was not returned in the way that Ralph
meant. All the same, she could not rid herself of the impression that such a
thing would take all the light out of her life, and leave her alone and
desolate indeed.</p>
<p>"Connie thinks very highly of you," she said shyly.</p>
<p>"That is very good of her," Ralph replied with something like a sigh, "but
we are too good friends ever to care for each other in any other way. Still,
she is doing you good, Mary. There is something about you that I can't
describe, some subtle change for the better. I never noticed till now that you
had such a sweet and tender smile and there is a thrill in your voice that
makes you pure and womanly. My experiment has been a success."</p>
<p>"What experiment is that?" Mary asked innocently.</p>
<p>"What am I saying?" Ralph laughed. "I have a confession to make later, but
it is not the time to go into that. It is good to be by your side again,
listening to your voice. Now, tell me all that you are doing."</p>
<p>Mary did not need to be asked. She fairly bubbled over with delight. The
deep thrill that Ralph had noticed in her voice touched him and caused a chord
to throb in response. It seemed almost impossible to believe that this was the
Mary of the old days, the proud, distant creature whose head was in the clouds
contemplating the glory of the family. She was tender and warm and confiding,
and the flush on her face gave the one thing needed to make her fair and
radiant beauty complete. This was the girl that Ralph loved, the woman of his
fondest dreams. He felt as if he could walk by her side for ever.</p>
<p>"But you will think me conceited," she said presently; "I have talked of
nothing but myself for half an hour or more. Please do not laugh at me."</p>
<p>"Certainly not," Ralph said indignantly. "I have no intention of laughing at
you, Mary. It is a positive joy to me to hear you talking like this! And so
there are better, truer things than the Dashwood pride and the family pedigree.
You have seen what noble womanhood can do for itself, what a dignified thing
honest labour is. Do you remember what I said to you the night that you came to
London, Mary!"</p>
<p>"I recollect," Mary whispered softly. "You prophesied for me. You said that
I should be better and purer for the sacrifice. You said that I should see life
as it is, and learn what a poor thing the family glory was by the side of
humanity. And I have learned the lesson, Ralph, I am quite content now to work
for my living; I am trying to forget Dashwood and all its glories. Why, I have
even become accustomed to London bread and butter."</p>
<p>The girl burst into a merry laugh in which Ralph joined from pure sympathy.
Here was the model wife for which he had been looking.</p>
<p>"That is important," he said, "but there is another lesson that I am anxious
about. You have become a child of the people now, a recruit in the great army
of labour. But with your new womanhood has there not come another and sweeter
dream to you, Mary? Have you not pictured someone by your side to help in the
struggle?"</p>
<p>The girl's face flushed crimson, but she bravely met Ralph's eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said frankly, "we were only talking about it last night. Oh, I
have gone a long way indeed since I saw you last."</p>
<p>"That is good to hear. And when the right man comes along you will not
refuse him simply because he does not have a long pedigree?"</p>
<p>"Please do not say too much about it," Mary pleaded. "If you only knew how
dreadfully ashamed you make me feel! As if it mattered, as if anything
mattered, so long as the woman loved the man and he was worthy of her
affection. There, Ralph, do you need me to say any more than that! A man does
not need a long pedigree or a fine estate to be a gentleman. But, really, you
are making me false to my creed, and I shall not tell you anything else till I
have seen Mrs. Speed. This is the house. Will you wait outside?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not," Ralph said, "I have something to say to Mrs. Speed as well
as you. You will perhaps be surprised to hear that she is an old friend of my
father's. Come along."</p>
<p>Mrs. Speed came up from the kitchen very hot and very red, and inclined to
be angry at being disturbed at this time of the day. She began to explain
volubly to Mary why the boxes had not yet been sent off. In the hall a man was
calling for the landlady. She broke off in her exclamations and stared at
Ralph. She seemed terribly agitated, her face grew white, her eyes astonished,
as Ralph held out his hand.</p>
<p>"A ghost!" she said, "a ghost from the grave. And yet it could not be; after
all these years, it is impossible that the form of&mdash;well, what is it?"</p>
<p>The man in the hall came swaggering into the room. He glanced at Ralph, and
would have vanished had not the latter detained him.</p>
<p>"This is an unexpected meeting," he said. "I did not expect to see you here
so far away from home, Sir Vincent Dashwood."</p>
<p>"Sir Vincent Dashwood!" Mrs. Speed cried. "Then who, sir, are you, I'd like
to know?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-49" id="ch-49"></a>CHAPTER XLIX&mdash;A BOLT FROM THE BLUE</h2>
<p>Just for a moment it looked as if Ralph's pretty scheme was destined to fall
to the ground. Naturally, Mary had the haziest idea of what was taking place.
She could only see that the man whom she knew as Sir Vincent Dashwood was
looking most terribly uneasy and casting imploring glances at Mrs. Speed.</p>
<p>It seemed strange that anybody should in any way be craving the good favours
of the faded-looking woman, but such was the case. If she had had the so-called
baronet's life in her hands he could not have regarded her with more entreaty.
And, as to her part, Mrs. Speed looked from one man to the other in a dazed
kind of way, as if she had not the slightest idea what was taking place. Her
face turned from red to white and then to red again; she seemed to have some
difficulty with her breathing.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," she gasped. "You are asking for me. It must be
wrong to say that this gentleman is Sir Vincent Dashwood."</p>
<p>Ralph had recovered his equanimity by this time. His obvious course now was
to prevent Mary from guessing at the true nature of the situation. She must not
know yet. And she had been so sweet and frank and candid with Ralph that not
for the world would he have her know the trick that had been played on her,
yet. That confession would have to come at the proper hour, with the proper
setting, say the rose garden at the dower house on a moonlight night.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, I am quite correct," he said. "I assure you that the
gentleman who has just come in is no other than Sir Vincent Dashwood, of
Dashwood Hall. As a matter of fact, I was in the fortunate position of placing
a valuable proof of his identity in his way. But the matter has developed
itself so recently that it is possible few people know of the change."</p>
<p>"Sir Vincent Dashwood!" Mrs. Speed repeated, as if the words had some
fascination for her. "And so he is Sir Vincent Dashwood. And who, sir, may you
be?"</p>
<p>The question came about in the form of a challenge. Mrs. Speed moved a step
forward as if to stand between Ralph and the other man. There was just the
suggestion of protection in the movement. Ralph smiled in reply.</p>
<p>"It does not much matter who I am," he said. "As a matter of fact, my name
is Ralph Darnley, and I came to you with a message from the late Ralph
Dashwood, who, at one time, was married to your sister."</p>
<p>"You knew him very well?" the woman asked in the same dazed way.</p>
<p>"I knew him very well indeed," Ralph replied, "but that we will go into
presently. In the meantime, this young lady desires a word with you. Perhaps
you will be so good as to settle with her first, my business will keep till
afterwards."</p>
<p>And Ralph moved off in the direction of the passage. Dashwood could do no
more than follow him in the circumstances. He looked restless and anxious and
whistled rather ostentatiously to cover his agitation.</p>
<p>"Upon my word you have made it very awkward for me," he said. "I never
dreamed of seeing you here. Mrs. Speed is an old friend of yours, I
presume."</p>
<p>"I have never seen her before to-day," Ralph said, aroused by the eagerness
of the question. "I came to bring her a message as you heard. She appeared to
be surprised to see me, but not more than she was surprised to hear of your new
dignity."</p>
<p>"She didn't know it, you see," Dashwood explained. "I&mdash;I haven't told
her yet. She was very good to me in my poorer days, and I am grateful for it.
Still, she knows the truth now, and there is an end of it. Odd that I should
find you mixed up like this with quite a different phase of my life. Don't you
think so?"</p>
<p>"Not at all; it is not in the least odd if you knew everything. Still, it
does not matter. You can afford to disclose your identity now."</p>
<p>"But I can't," Dashwood replied, "those lawyer people are making a great
fuss. Anybody would think that they had the title and estate to dispose of. All
the family recognise my position, nobody makes the least objection, and yet
those solicitors ask for all kinds of additional proofs. I don't half like
it."</p>
<p>Ralph made no reply. He knew all about the objection raised by the family
lawyers and was in a position to enlighten Dashwood's mind to a painful
degree.</p>
<p>But all this would come in time; meanwhile, the puppet must play his part in
the comedy. Any further conversation was cut short by the entrance of Mary. In
a tentative kind of way Dashwood wanted to know what she was doing here.</p>
<p>"No getting away from the old faces and the old places," he said. "I come to
see Mrs. Speed, so does Mr. Darnley, and you turn up at the same time. What are
you after?"</p>
<p>"It does not in the least matter," Mary said coldly. "I happened to be
staying under Mrs. Speed's roof at the time she had the misfortune to change
houses; in her hurry she took away with her certain things belonging to me. I
came to fetch them. It is very simple. Are you quite ready to go, Mr.
Darnley?"</p>
<p>"I think I will come," Ralph said impulsively. "What I have to say to Mrs.
Speed will keep till another day. She seems to be very unsettled here as yet.
Perhaps you will take that message to Mrs. Speed for me, Sir Vincent?"</p>
<p>Dashwood's anxious features cleared wonderfully. His air had hitherto been
one of guarded suspicion. He had a vague idea that Ralph was concealing
something. It would be no fault of his if Mrs. Speed and Darnley met again.</p>
<p>"Certainly, certainly," he said. "Is that your cab at the door, Mary? Let me
lend you a hand with those boxes. We shall have the pleasure of seeing you down
at Dashwood before long, I hope. Independence of spirit is all very well, but
you will find your new life a little trying after a bit. And there is always a
home for you at the Hall. Drop me a line to say when you are coming.
Good-bye."</p>
<p>The speaker fairly bundled Mary into the cab. Ralph followed with a grim
smile on his face. He was just as anxious to get away himself; it would be a
pity if his scheme broke down just as everything was going on splendidly.</p>
<p>"What does it all mean?" Mary demanded as the cab drove away. "What
connection is there between that man and Mrs. Speed? And why did she look at
you as if you had been some accusing ghost? And why was our friend so afraid
that Mrs. Speed should know his new title?"</p>
<p>"What a list of questions!" Ralph laughed. "Would you mind if I deferred the
reply for a few days? Do you suspect that anything is wrong?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," Mary exclaimed. "That woman has some guilty knowledge on
her mind. So has Sir Vincent Dashwood. And you looked angry and confused as he
came in. I know that Mrs. Speed came originally from our part, that she is the
sister of Ralph Dashwood's first wife. She knows all about the family quarrel
and the tragedy that followed. And she is in possession of certain papers that
Vincent Dashwood needs."</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" Ralph asked.</p>
<p>"I overheard the conversation at Keppel Terrace. Vincent Dashwood came here
to get those papers; I heard him say so. And he is at yonder house to-day for
the same purpose. If that man turns out to be an impostor, why, my
father&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I implore you not to build up on that," Ralph said warmly, "pray don't.
Your father will never be Sir George Dashwood. If you come back to the Hall
again in the same capacity as before, your experience&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mary laughed good-naturedly. Her face cleared; she discerned exactly what
was passing in the mind of her companion.</p>
<p>"Very well," she said, "I will dismiss that contingency from my mind.
Notwithstanding, I should dearly like to come back into my kingdom again. But
you need not be afraid that I should revert to the old order of things. The
change in me is permanent; the old pride and coolness have gone; I have learned
to love and feel for my kind. Do you know what I would do if the property were
mine? I would turn the dower house into a retreat for broken-down artists and
authors and the like, where they could regain their strength and rest at no
expense to themselves. Oh, I would do so many things to render the lives of
deserving people happy."</p>
<p>Mary's cheeks glowed and her blue eyes sparkled with a tenderness that Ralph
had never seen in them before. There was soul in the girl's face now, the soft
expression without which woman's beauty counts for nothing. And from the bottom
of his heart Ralph was glad. It was hard work to keep from Mary the fact that
the kingdom she so longed for was in her grasp.</p>
<p>"It does me good to hear you speak like that," he said. "No, I must not come
in, for I have a great deal to do. Give my kind regards to Connie, and say that
I shall call the next time I am in town. I am very anxious to see Miss Cameron
also. But you say she is coming down to the dower house on Saturday.
Goodbye."</p>
<p>Mary's hand lay in Ralph's for a moment and their eyes met. And then the
girl knew that Ralph still loved her, and the knowledge thrilled her with a
sudden happiness. She did not dare to stop and analyse her feelings, but deep
down in her heart she knew that when the time came Ralph would have his own
way.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-50" id="ch-50"></a>CHAPTER L&mdash;HARD PUT TO IT</h2>
<p>With a sigh of passionate relief Vincent Dashwood watched the cab drive
away. He hardly knew what he had to fear, and yet he discovered the fact that
he had got rid of some great danger. True, Ralph Darnley had more or less
betrayed his secret to Mrs. Speed, but then that discovery might have been made
at any moment.</p>
<p>Dashwood called impatiently to the tenant of the house. No reply came. He
walked into the dining-room muttering to himself. Mrs. Speed stood there by the
fireplace, her hands clasped convulsively together, her face hard and grey.
Once in his life Dashwood had been in court and heard a woman sentenced to
death. It came back to him now that the face of the criminal had looked exactly
like Mrs. Speed's.</p>
<p>"What on earth is the matter with you?" he asked brutally.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," the woman said hoarsely. "I was thinking, I was trying to
get it all clear in my brain. It seems impossible, altogether preposterous. He
told me that you were Sir Vincent Dashwood. He wasn't mad, was he?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," Dashwood grinned, "but I shall think you are if you go on
like this. I didn't dare to tell you at first because you do such foolish
things. You are quite good enough to have written to the old girl and told her
everything. It is a very fortunate thing that Lady Dashwood regards you as
being no longer in the world."</p>
<p>"Is it? Are you sure that Lady Dashwood thinks me dead?"</p>
<p>"Of course she does. I got that out of her by judicious pumping. Now that
Ralph Darnley has given me away I can tell you the whole truth. I got sick of
plodding in the City on small pay and hard work. One or two things you told me
gave me an idea of the game. I got hold of all those letters and things and
learned them by heart. Gradually, the whole story was mine. Then I pretended to
you that I had something to do in the north. I didn't go north at all; I went
down to Dashwood and introduced myself to the old lady. She asked me a lot of
questions, and I replied to them satisfactorily. Of course, she did not
recognise me as the boy I was when we left the parish seventeen years ago. And
she put old Slight on me, too. Well, I satisfied old Slight, too, though at the
first go-off he also regarded me as an impostor. Still, I hadn't the nerve to
go the whole thing, and pretended that I desired to wait till the old lady was
dead. And she was so much in love with the girl who was here just now that she
allowed me to have my own way. It was only when I looked like getting into
trouble over a charge of burning the Hall down that I had to speak. And blest
if Ralph Darnley did not come forward and produce the very marriage certificate
that I needed. It was as easy as falling off a house. Everybody gave way to me
without a struggle, I stepped into the estate and the title. That is not more
than a week ago. The only people who made a fuss were the lawyers. That is why
I came to you for those letters. But I shall soon stop the mouths of those old
landsharks, and then we shall have a good time. No more dodging about and
worrying over your rent in the future, mother."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Speed shared no joy in the prospect of her emancipation. The grey
look had not left her face and the strained terror was still in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I didn't mind it," she said. "At any rate, I have tried to be honest. And
so you claimed the estate of the Dashwoods on the ground that you are the son
of Ralph Dashwood, and all the time Ralph Darnley, as he calls himself, was
looking on. Has the man any bitter grudge against you?"</p>
<p>"Why should he? I never saw him in my life till a little less than a month
ago."</p>
<p>"And he permits this farce to go on! Why? What strange scheme has he in his
mind? Oh, why did he not turn up before, and prevent this great temptation from
being forced on you?"</p>
<p>The listener stared in astonishment at Mrs. Speed. A feeling of danger
troubled him. He caught the woman almost roughly by the shoulder and shook
her.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you?" he demanded. "Why can't you speak out? Who is
this Ralph Darnley that you should be in such mortal fear of him?"</p>
<p>"There is no Ralph Darnley," Mrs. Speed cried. "That man is Ralph Dashwood,
the son of the Dashwood who married my sister and then disappeared. How do I
know? Why, he is the very image of his father, as the latter was as a young
fellow. Directly he came into the room just now I recognised him. You could
have knocked me down with a feather. I have a portrait of Ralph Dashwood
upstairs&mdash;I only turned it out last night. And when I show you that photo
you will have no doubts as to who this Ralph Darnley is. Why he is allowing you
to stand in his shoes is a mystery. When he comes to declare his identity he
will make very short work of you, Vincent."</p>
<p>"Go up and get that photograph," the listener said hoarsely, "I'll get to
the bottom of this."</p>
<p>The photograph was a faded one, but there was no comfort in it for the man
who chose to call himself Vincent Dashwood. It was exactly as his mother had
said. Making due allowances for the change in fashion and dress, it was Ralph
Darnley who smiled out of the photograph into Vincent Speed's terrified
eyes.</p>
<p>"You're right," he said, "right as rain. No use disputing the thing in the
face of evidence like that. But what is that chap waiting for, why is he making
a cat's paw of me like this? No wonder that he could supply me with a copy of
the marriage certificate of his father's second matrimonial venture when he was
the offspring of the alliance. The question is? How much longer is he going to
keep me on the string? Still, nobody else knows. The best thing I can do is to
push a mortgage through and make myself secure with as much money as I can lay
my hands on. Perhaps I may manage to bamboozle Lady Dashwood out of a bit more.
At any rate, she does not know anything of this business, for&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Fool," Mrs. Speed cried, "of course she knows. Hasn't she seen Ralph
Darnley?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, he seems to be a prime favourite at the dower house."</p>
<p>"Naturally. Why, as soon as her ladyship set eyes upon the young fellow who
chooses to call himself Ralph Darnley she would recognise him. Do you suppose
that you could deceive a mother over a thing like that? She recognised him
instantly. So did old Slight. So would anybody who knew his father."</p>
<p>"Then why on earth didn't he kick me into the street?"</p>
<p>"Who can tell? Perhaps he came back to see how things were before he
disclosed himself. At any rate, he has fooled you. Oh, why do you stay here
like this, when at this very moment there may be a warrant out for your
arrest?"</p>
<p>Vincent Speed, to call him by his proper name, started and changed colour.
It seemed hard to lose everything just as the whole world was in his grasp. At
any rate, he would not go empty away, he would bluff it a little longer. Let
him have a week or so, and then the foe could do as he pleased. It would be an
easy matter to raise a vast sum of money on the family estates.</p>
<p>"I can't go back now," he said, "I must carry on the game till I have made
it worth while. And it is a strange thing to me if Lady Dashwood knows
anything. She is too simple-minded to be able to keep up the deception. She
would show it in her manner if she had made the discovery that I am an
impostor. She is just the same to me as she ever was. Swells of that sort are
not given to conceal their feelings.</p>
<p>"Oh, are they not?" Mrs. Speed said bitterly, "I know better. They can stoop
like the rest of us when it suits their book to do so. Well, go your own way,
and see what you can do, Vincent. It is just possible that when the time comes,
I can find a way to win Lady Dashwood over to our side; at least, I can use her
as an advocate for clemency as far as you are concerned."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" Speed asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I will not tell you," Mrs. Speed said with some show of firmness, "I have
let you learn too much already. And the secret is not entirely mine. Now you go
your way, and let me hear from you how things are going. But they can only go
in one way. Badly as you have used me, bad son as you are, I can't forget that
you are my son. It is no fine thing to be a woman&mdash;men never suffer as we
do."</p>
<p>Vincent Speed went away with a troubled mind and an uneasy feeling that some
disaster was hanging over him. The more he thought over the disclosures of the
past hour, the more they puzzled him. Well, he would have to struggle on a
little longer, until he had a large sum of money at his disposal. He drove down
to Bedford Row, where the office of the family solicitors was situated, and
sent in his card to the head of the firm. The latter received him with somewhat
cold politeness&mdash;he would like to know what he could do for Sir
Vincent.</p>
<p>Speed went on to explain. But no response came from the clean-shaven man on
the far side of the table. Mr. Morley shook his head.</p>
<p>"We can't do it," he said. "In the present circumstances it is impossible.
Of course, we have many clients who would be prepared to lend money on the
Dashwood property, but we are not yet satisfied as to&mdash;er&mdash;the legal
aspect of your claim. Till that point is cleared up to our satisfaction, we
must decline both to arrange the mortgage or even to part with the deeds
relating to the property."</p>
<p>Speed protested, but protested in vain. And nothing moved the iron-faced man
from his purpose; he might have been a statue for all he heeded those threats
and expostulations.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-51" id="ch-51"></a>CHAPTER LI&mdash;COLD COMFORT</h2>
<p>In an aimless kind of way Speed stepped into the street and turned his steps
in the direction of the City. It had occurred to him almost in the light of an
inspiration that Horace Mayfield might be of use at this juncture. Mayfield's
office was full of clients; the place had an air of prosperity. But the head of
the firm looked tired and jaded as Speed came into his private room; the
fingers on his cigarette shook terribly.</p>
<p>"Sit down," Mayfield said curtly, "I have been wondering what had become of
you. I have been expecting to hear about that sum of money we spoke of. Now
that you have come so easily into the estate there can be no difficulty. The
man who calls himself Ralph Darnley evidently is not aware of his own
identity."</p>
<p>"Oh, isn't he?" Speed sneered, "that's just where you make the mistake. I
have had no end of an eye-opener this morning, in fact, what you might call a
regular staggerer. It came from my mother. I wish that I had taken her into my
confidence from the first. But perhaps I had better tell you all about it."</p>
<p>"It would perhaps be as well," Mayfield said grimly. "Go on."</p>
<p>Speed proceeded to tell his story. Long before he had finished Mayfield's
grey face became still more ashen and the fingers on his cigarette trembled
visibly.</p>
<p>"So the ship has foundered," he said. "I've got a shrewd idea as to the game
that Darnley is playing. I took that man for a fool. As a matter of fact, he is
the cleverest chap I ever came across. To be candid, I did his father out of a
lot of money. I played much the same game with Sir George Dashwood. And it
seemed to me that Ralph Darnley was going to take it lying down. He made no
face; he took no proceedings. And then it came upon me like a thunderbolt. At
the time he was working up a case against me. He put it into the hands of the
cleverest firm of criminal lawyers in London. He arranged such a damning lot of
facts before me that I was bound to sacrifice everything to save a prosecution.
I scraped the money together from all kinds of sources. I robbed other clients
to get it. At the moment all my speculations go wrong, of course. I'm in a
desperate hole, Speed; there isn't a man in London who is in such a hole
to-day. If I don't get &pound;30,000 by Monday I shall have to bolt&mdash;and
there is no safe place to bolt to nowadays. You will have to get me this money
on mortgage."</p>
<p>"But I can't," Speed protested. "I went to the family lawyers just now, and
they refused to have anything to do with it. Said they were by no means
satisfied as to my legal position. They went so far as to declare they not only
decline to raise money on the estate, but they refuse to give up the
deeds."</p>
<p>Something like a groan came from Mayfield's lips, but his busy brain was
working all the time. He saw where the difficulty lay. With Ralph out of the
way he could, and would, crush Speed like a fly. He would expose the impostor
without mercy, and then things would revert to the old order as they were
before Ralph Darnley appeared.</p>
<p>An accident to Ralph Darnley! The real owner of the estate out of the way!
Properly manipulated, this might mean the recovery of that money from Darnley's
solicitors. It would at any rate mean the return of George Dashwood to his own
once more, the putting of the screw on Mary. The idea whirled in Mayfield's
mind like a dazzling wheel. He did not dare to look at Speed; he was afraid of
the tale his eyes might tell.</p>
<p>"I must have time to think this over," he said. "Meanwhile, you had better
return to Dashwood as if nothing out of the common had happened. I'll come down
and dine with you to-morrow night and stay till the morning. Then get hold of
this so-called Darnley, and see if you can pump any further information out of
him. If you could possibly induce him to dine with us so much the better. Only,
if I were you, I should not say that you had asked me. I've got a scheme
working in my mind, but it is not quite safe as yet, so we need not discuss
it."</p>
<p>"All right," Speed said moodily, "you are a much cleverer chap than I am,
and I shall rely on you to find some way out of the trouble. When I think what
is slipping through my fingers like this, I could commit murder."</p>
<p>Speed spoke vehemently, with a voice that rasped hoarsely. Mayfield started,
to find that his thoughts and Speed's were running in such parallel grooves. He
made a gesture of impatience, indicating that he should like to be alone. Speed
lounged out, lunched freely, and, with the courage that is born of wine, took
his way to the station with a resolve to return to Dashwood without delay.</p>
<p>Everything seemed just the same there; there was no suggestion that anybody
knew of the deceit which had been practised on the old house. Even Slight
appeared to be more respectful than usual, but this was all prearranged; Ralph
had travelled down by the same train as Speed, and Slight was fresh from an
interview with the man whom he called his master. It was after tea that Speed
went over to the dower house. His heart was beating a little faster than usual;
he felt his colour come and go as Lady Dashwood came into the garden with a
basket and a pair of scissors in her hand. Her greeting was cold and formal as
usual; but Speed could not detect any change in her manner.</p>
<p>"Let me hold the basket for you," he said graciously. "You are going to get
some roses?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Lady Dashwood replied, "I prefer to arrange my own flowers. And I
have a young friend coming to stay with me to-morrow, an acquaintance of
Mary's."</p>
<p>So far all was well, for the speaker did not refer to Mary as Miss Dashwood;
it was evident to Speed that he was still regarded as one of the family. He
wondered if Lady Dashwood had any idea as to his real identity.</p>
<p>"I saw Mary to-day," he said. "She had been lodging with a woman I know, a
Mrs. Speed. She has been very unfortunate of late, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know Mrs. Speed quite well," Lady Dashwood replied. "Her father was a
tenant on the estate many years ago. And I have heard all about the misfortune.
In fact, I was in London yesterday, and called upon Mrs. Speed, who had written
to me. What is the matter?"</p>
<p>"A thorn from one of the roses," Speed said in some confusion, "in my
finger."</p>
<p>He was staggered at the information delivered in Lady Dashwood's quiet,
level voice. Why had his mother not told him? Why had she withheld this fact
from him? Perhaps she had forgotten it in the agitation of the startling
disclosures of the morning. But Speed took fresh heart of grace from the news.
That Lady Dashwood was not talking at him he felt certain; her voice was too
matter of fact for that.</p>
<p>"That's a strange thing," Speed continued to say in a fairly steady voice.
"I did not know it before. Let me get the roses for you from the top of the
tree, they are so much finer. Have you seen anything of Ralph Darnley
lately?"</p>
<p>"Not for a day or two," Lady Dashwood replied. "He has been in London, but I
believe that he is coming back some time to-day, and I should not be surprised
if he came over here later."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact Ralph put in an appearance before the basket of roses
was filled. If the suspicions of Speed had been rocked to sleep, they were
awakened now, when he saw the way in which Lady Dashwood smiled at the
newcomer. There was real affection in her glance; the pressure of her hand was
warm and clinging.</p>
<p>"So you have come back again," she said, "I have quite missed you. And I
have felt so lonely all day. Won't you take pity on me and dine with me
to-night?"</p>
<p>Ralph expressed his gratification at the request. There was no fault to find
with his manner towards Speed. The latter was puzzled and worried.</p>
<p>"You have not dined with me yet," he said. "What do you say to coming in
to-morrow at half-past seven? Positively, I won't take a refusal."</p>
<p>Ralph hesitated just for a moment. Perhaps a feeling of curiosity moved him,
for he inclined his head presently with a smile.</p>
<p>It was hard work to keep up appearances with this man, but it was not going
to be for much longer. Ralph had made up his mind to that as soon as he had
parted with Mary that morning.</p>
<p>"I shall be pleased," he said, "Lady Dashwood, won't you let me come into
the house and help to arrange those flowers? I have a woman's weakness for that
sort of thing. You should see how the roses grow in California."</p>
<p>The pair walked towards the house and Speed lounged away. On the whole he
had no cause to be dissatisfied with the afternoon's work. He was still puzzled
and uneasy, but Lady Dashwood's manner had gone a long way to reassure him. But
he was frightened over Lady Dashwood's visit to his mother. He was inclined to
be bitter against the latter because she had not told him. The problem still
filled his mind as he reached the Hall and stumbled into the dining-room. He
poured himself out a large glass of whisky and soda, and took a cigarette from
the silver box on the table. And there on the table beside the cigarettes lay a
telegram. Speed tore it open and rapidly cast his eye over the
contents:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Make no mistake as to Darnley to-morrow night. He must dine with you. All
arrangements made and plan complete. Wire reply
immediately.&mdash;MAYFIELD."</p>
<p>Speed chuckled to himself as he filled in the reply form. If Mayfield had
laid his plans after his own fashion then success was bound to follow.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-52" id="ch-52"></a>CHAPTER LII&mdash;THE SPIDER'S WEB</h2>
<p>Speed rose next morning with a sense of his dangers and responsibilities. He
had sat up late the night before, thinking things over to the accompaniment of
much whisky and soda. Therefore, his head was heavy and his eyes were dull as
he crept down late to breakfast. He was inclined to take the gloomiest view of
the situation; the cheerfulness of Mr. George Dashwood irritated him.</p>
<p>Whatever Dashwood's faults were, he did not number dissipation of that
degrading kind amongst them. He looked cheerful enough as he sat before the
open window reading the paper and smoking an after-breakfast cigarette. He
greeted Speed heartily.</p>
<p>"Why do you smoke here?" the latter growled. "You know I can't stand the
smell of tobacco before I've had my breakfast. Go outside and finish it."</p>
<p>"All right, my dear fellow," Dashwood said politely. There was something
almost cringing in his manner. "Sorry to annoy you. Fine morning."</p>
<p>The speaker appeared anxious to please. He wanted to ignore the unpleasant
feeling that Speed despised him. There was little chance now of burning incense
on the altar of family pride; Speed took care of that. He was at no pains to
conceal the fact that he regarded Dashwood as a pensioner, dependent upon his
bounty, and to be treated accordingly. Dashwood had fallen a long way indeed
when he accepted the hospitality of his supplanter.</p>
<p>"What a confounded nuisance that old beggar is," he muttered, heedless of
the fact that Slight stood by the sideboard. "I shall have to get rid of him
altogether. If he had the spirit of a man he would not stay here. And they talk
of the pride of the Dashwoods. Slight, why aren't there any curried eggs and
some devilled kidneys? Am I always to be telling you about it? What a fine
thing it is to be a pampered, lazy lout of a man-servant. What are you gaping
at?"</p>
<p>"The eggs are under the silver cover, sir," Slight replied. "The kidneys are
here over the spirit lamp, sir. The rest of your remarks are unnecessary,
sir."</p>
<p>"Oh, are they? Did you behave in this insolent way in Sir Ralph's time?"</p>
<p>"Sir Ralph was a gentleman, sir. He knew how to speak to his
dependents."</p>
<p>"Oh, did he?" Speed roared, "I suppose I don't. If I like to swear at my
confounded flunkeys I'll do it. They can take it out in extra wages. If this
kind of thing goes on we shall part, Slight."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," Slight responded. "You have only to say the word. You may
be interested to hear that only last night I had great difficulty in preventing
the whole of the servants from resigning in a body."</p>
<p>Speed had no more to say. He was half afraid of a quarrel to the end with
Slight. The latter knew too much. The studied insolence that underlay his
respectful manner proved that. He moved about the room now with the air of a
man who is depriving himself of the decencies of life. He poured out the coffee
in a lordly way, as if under protest. Speed made advances towards
conciliation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mayfield is coming down to-night," he said, "he will dine here and
probably stay till to-morrow. Tell the housekeeper this. Mr. Darnley will dine
here also. I should like the cook to be sure of something extra. I can leave
you to see to the wines."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darnley dining here, sir?" Slight asked with a rising inflection of
voice. "Coming here to-night to meet that&mdash;I mean, Mr. Mayfield?"</p>
<p>"Well, why not? Any objection to make, Slight? Any little alteration to suit
you? You have only to mention it."</p>
<p>Slight muttered a hasty apology. He had come very near to betraying himself.
As he looked into Speed's bloodshot eyes he saw something there that filled his
heart with a sudden fear. For the old man knew everything; there was not a
single move in the game with which he was not acquainted.</p>
<p>But Speed had forgotten all about Slight and his little slip. A small
liqueur and a cigarette put him on good terms with himself once more. It was a
beautiful day, too, with a soft breeze and brilliant sunshine. Across the park
the deer were moving in a dappled line; the fine old gardens were looking their
very best. As Speed paced up and down the terrace one gardener and another
touched their hats to him. It filled him with a feeling of
pleasure&mdash;flattered self-importance. It was worth the risk to be the head
of a place like this, to feel that it was all his own. And only two years
before he had been the slave of the pen, the toady of a sweating employer.</p>
<p>Speed felt that he could never give it up again. In his heart he was a
murderer, so far as Ralph Darnley was concerned. He had read somewhere that
there were several different kinds of poisons that left no trace behind. One of
these was the virus of the cobra. No doubt that could be obtained in London,
where money could procure anything. A drop of that, and Ralph Darnley was a
dead man. Nobody would be any the wiser, it would be assumed that he had died
of heart failure. A comparatively small outlay might procure the poison. It
would be worth while going to London to see.</p>
<p>In these circumstances Speed knew that he would not have hesitated. He
really could not give up the place. He had always naturally been of
extravagant, luxurious tastes, and now he was in a position to gratify them to
the full. The new West End tailor grovelled before him; jewellers and wine and
cigar merchants laid their stocks at his feet; he had only to choose the list.
If he rang the bell a score of servants were ready to wait on him; the
costliest wines were at his disposal.</p>
<p>No, it would be impossible to give it up. Speed's mind kept harping on the
matter of those poisons. He must try to find out where they could be procured.
Once Ralph Darnley was out of the way, nobody would trouble him any more. Once
that event happened nobody would dispute his claim. But then perhaps Mayfield
had an idea. Mayfield was a clever, long-headed chap, who was not disposed to
be scrupulous. On the whole, perhaps it would be as well to leave things to
Mayfield.</p>
<p>There would be plenty of time to discuss matters before dinner. There was
more than time as it turned out, for Mayfield arrived unexpectedly before
luncheon. He looked drawn and worried, Speed thought, but there was a grim
determination in his eye that Speed liked. Mr. Dashwood met Mayfield in the
friendliest possible manner. If he felt any disgust towards the newcomer he
disguised it very effectively. He went off presently under a strong hint that
his host and Mayfield had some important business to discuss. He was going as
far as Longtown, he said, and should not be back before dinner.</p>
<p>"That's the way to get rid of him," Speed said as he lay back in his chair,
a large cigar between his lips. Slight had placed the wine on the table and
vanished. "What a useless old encumbrance he is about the house. I shall have
to get rid of him, Mayfield. When I wrote my generous offer I hoped that Mary
would come, too. Those confounded servants want keeping in hand, and, besides,
nobody seems to care about calling here, so long as there is nothing in the
shape of a mistress about the place."</p>
<p>"Everybody has been wise," Mayfield said cynically. "Anyway, I am glad you
have not got rid of old Dashwood yet. He is going to be a puppet in the play.
We shall be able to make a very effective use of him before the day is out.
Nothing happened yet, no kind of move on the part of the foe, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No," Speed explained, "nothing. I saw Lady Dashwood last night. She treated
me just in the same way as usual, which is all the more strange if she knows
who I really am."</p>
<p>"I don't suppose for a moment that she knows who you really are," Mayfield
said. "She may know who you are not&mdash;and that's her grandson. But if
Darnley was out of the way things would be quite different. Nobody would worry
you any longer. How did you manage to get him to come and dine here
to-night?"</p>
<p>"The thing worked out easily enough. I simply asked him and he said yes. He
hesitated just for a moment and then he smiled in a queer kind of way. But one
thing you may be sure of&mdash;he would not have come had he known that he was
going to meet you."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," Mayfield grinned. "Shall we dine here to-night?"</p>
<p>The question was put so abruptly that Speed started. He could see that
something evil was brooding in the mind of his companion. Mayfield's eyes were
taking in the arrangements of the room as a general might survey a field of
battle. There were three long windows in the room, leading to a kind of balcony
outside. In front of one of the windows was a double screen in carved oak,
which shielded the window and made it into a kind of alcove. Mayfield noted all
this with grim satisfaction, for a smile played about the corners of his hard
mouth.</p>
<p>"I asked you if we dined here to-night?" he said again.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Why not? We generally dine here&mdash;it is so much more pleasant
a room than the big dining hall. Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"We will come to that presently," Mayfield replied. "I take it that those
windows open to the terrace outside. Is there a seat behind that screen? I mean
a seat that one could lounge in."</p>
<p>"A big armchair," Speed whispered. "What are you driving at?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-53" id="ch-53"></a>CHAPTER LIII&mdash;THE WEB TIGHTENS</h2>
<p>"We shall get to the point all in good time," Mayfield said deliberately.
"That screen forms a kind of cosy corner and entrance to the terrace. If a good
dinner gave you a headache, and you could not stand the light, you might do
worse than sit in the big chair and smoke there whilst the others sat around
the table. I planned it all out coming along, with the recollection of this
room in my mind. But the geographical situation is even better than I
anticipated."</p>
<p>"What on earth are you driving at?" Speed asked with nervous irritation.</p>
<p>Mayfield laughed. There was something hard and grating in his mirth.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll put it in the form of a parable if you like," he said. "Suppose
that you and I found ourselves in a very tight place. It wants no imagination
to conceive that, you say. Very well, the situation is granted. We are in the
warm corner, and the same man is keeping us there. I need not say I am alluding
to Ralph Darnley. If I don't get him out of the way, I am a ruined man. Another
few days, and I shall have to fly the country in disgrace; I shall be brought
back and put on my trial. The result of that trial is a foregone conclusion and
society will be deprived of my presence for some years to come. My only hope is
in help of a substantial nature from you."</p>
<p>"That's all right," Speed whispered hoarsely, "you shall have as much as you
like, if you will only show me the way to raise the money."</p>
<p>"That's precisely what I am going to do. Darnley must be got of the way.
Then you will have all the money you need. Listen to me. Darnley dines here
to-night. He will not stay late because of my presence. When the dinner is
practically finished you will plead a headache, and go and sit in that big
chair with the window open. From time to time you will put in a remark to show
that you are still there. When Darnley rises to go I shall walk as far as the
hall with him and help him on with his coat. It may happen that he will smoke a
cigar that I shall select for him&mdash;a fresh cigar to carry him home. A few
whiffs of that cigar will make him very giddy, for my cigars are strong. I have
made arrangements for a message to come to Darnley about half past ten saying
that Lady Dashwood desires to see him at the dower house to-night.</p>
<p>"Now, if my memory serves me correctly, the quickest way to the dower house
is along the terrace here. Darnley will go that way. He will be very giddy and
sleepy. You are in the alcove whilst I am talking to old Dashwood. This is
where Dashwood comes in, where he will be a witness for me. As Darnley staggers
along, you get out on to the terrace. You happen to have a loaded stick handy.
I don't wish to suggest any connection between the two events, but it is just
possible that Darnley will be found in the park to-morrow morning, with his
head split open and his pockets empty. That would be a fortunate accident for
us."</p>
<p>"Yes," Speed said with chattering teeth, "it&mdash;it would. But I don't
quite&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, the rest is quite easy. I call to you directly I fancy things are safe,
and you come into the room grumbling at the light. I only want you to answer a
question, and so prove that you have been in the room all the time. We don't
lose sight of one another after that, not till everybody has gone to bed, when
I slip out and place the body so that it can be found to look as if robbery had
been the motive. Can you do it?"</p>
<p>Speed nodded without reply. The room had grown suddenly dark, for a
thunderstorm had come up from the west. There was a lurid flash of lightning
followed by a clap of thunder, and then the rain came down in torrents. It was
only a matter of ten minutes before the light came back again. Speed nodded
once more.</p>
<p>"All right," he whispered, "I am a fairly powerful man, and physically, I
have nothing to fear from Ralph Darnley. Besides, you say he will not be in a
condition...It's a dreadful thing to think of, Mayfield, but I can't give
this up. I really couldn't go back to the old life of drudgery again. Only
please don't revert to the subject. Let us have another glass of wine and
forget all about it for the time being."</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on; evening came at length, and presently with it, Ralph
Darnley. He entered the big dining-room where the others awaited him. His easy
manner changed as he caught sight of Mayfield. Just for the moment he felt a
desire to walk out of the room and leave the house. He had not expected an
insult like this. But, on the other hand, he had asked no questions; he had
accepted the invitation as much out of curiosity as anything else, and,
besides, Mary's father was there. And Ralph had been in more questionable
circumstances before now.</p>
<p>"I think you know Mayfield," Speed said carelessly.</p>
<p>"We have met on several occasions," Ralph said quietly, "we have had
business relations together. But I hardly expected the pleasure."</p>
<p>"Well, you have nothing to regret as far as the business relations are
concerned," Mayfield said with a laugh. "Still, it is possible to forget all
about that for the moment. My friend, Sp&mdash;I mean, Sir Vincent, has asked
me to stay here for a night. Upon my word, he is a man to be envied! It isn't
often that a place like this tumbles into a man's lap. With most of us virtue
is its own reward."</p>
<p>Ralph made some suitable reply. He was annoyed and angry with himself for
coming. But there was no getting out of it now; he would have to go on till
half-past ten at least. It was a relief in its way when Slight came in with the
announcement that dinner was ready. That meal would occupy two hours at
least.</p>
<p>There was everything set out just as it had been in the old days, and yet
there was a subtle difference. The house lacked the presence of a mistress; it
needed the refining influence of a woman. And, in his mind's eye, Ralph saw the
woman there, smiling and tender at the head of the table, her eyes looking into
his. It was worth all the discomfort and unpleasantness of such a meal to know
that the time would not be long now. The puppets had nearly finished their
parts, and the hour for their removal was close at hand.</p>
<p>But the dinner dragged all the same; only Mr. Dashwood made spasmodic
efforts at keeping up the flagging conversation. He was fitfully gay, perhaps
he noted the look of displeasure in Ralph's eyes.</p>
<p>The cloth was removed at length and the wines sparkled red and white under
the soft, shaded lamps. Mayfield slipped out of the room presently under
pretence that he had forgotten his cigar case. Directly he entered he turned to
Ralph.</p>
<p>"A message has come for you," he said. "Lady Dashwood would like to see you
at the dower house on your way home. She will not detain you long."</p>
<p>"In that case I must not be late," Ralph replied. He was glad of the excuse
to get away a little sooner than he had expected. "What is the matter with our
host?"</p>
<p>For Speed had started, the cigar fell from his fingers. The false message
was a signal to him that the tragedy had begun, and he was expected to play his
part when the time came. He placed his hand to his head and groaned.</p>
<p>"A bilious headache," he said, "they give me a lot of trouble from time to
time. This one has been coming on all day. The light hurts my eyes fearfully.
If you will excuse me, I'll go and sit in the shade behind the screen. I shall
be able to hear all that is going on from there."</p>
<p>Ralph murmured his sympathy. All he wanted to do now was to get away. He was
heartily sorry that he had come at all. Half an hour slipped away, half an
hour's talk about mining speculation, to which Mr. Dashwood listened eagerly.
Everything in the nature of gambling always appealed to him.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I must be going," Ralph said, "It is necessary for me to get
away early if I am to see Lady Dashwood to-night."</p>
<p>"Don't go without a cigar," Mayfield urged as he proffered his case. "There
are no finer cigars in the world, though I say it myself. Do try one."</p>
<p>Ralph held out his hand for the case. It certainly was an excellent cigar.
There was something very soothing about it. Mayfield followed Ralph into the
hall, only to return a moment later with the information that the visitor had
departed. Then came the sound of a movement from behind the screen, followed by
what might have been a moan of pain.</p>
<p>"Poor chap," Mayfield said with ready sympathy. "Now let me go on, Mr.
Dashwood, and explain to you what I meant about those South African shares. I
want to prove to you what a good thing they are, if only you have the pluck to
take them and hold them."</p>
<p>"Provided that you've got the money," Dashwood laughed, "but, as you are
aware, I have no money; fortune has been very unkind to me lately. Still, on
the other hand&mdash;but you do not seem to be listening to me."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," Mayfield stammered, "I am listening to
something outside. Let us ask Sir Vincent if his head is well enough to offer
an opinion. I say, Dashwood, would you mind coming here for a moment. Your
relation here says&mdash;"</p>
<p>"All right," came a little voice from behind the screen, "I'm coming. Why
can't you leave a fellow alone? I declare I'm shaking from head to foot with
cold. Let us sit here out of the draught...I'm fairly stung with the
cold."</p>
<p>The speaker's teeth were chattering, his face was a ghastly blue colour.
And, for a long time afterwards nobody spoke besides Mr. George Dashwood!</p>
<h2><a name="ch-54" id="ch-54"></a>CHAPTER LIV&mdash;"EYES CLEARER
GROWN&mdash;"</h2>
<p>"I'm glad she's gone," Connie exclaimed as the cab drove away and the last
flutter of Grace's handkerchief had vanished. "Let us hope she will have a
happy time with Lady Dashwood. But why didn't your dear relative fetch her as
arranged? Why that telegram? I hope there is nothing wrong at the dower
house?"</p>
<p>"Of course there is nothing wrong," Mary laughed. "It is not like you to
imagine things. What is the matter with you this morning, Connie?"</p>
<p>Connie remarked tearfully that she did not know. For once in a way she was
on the verge of tears. Perhaps she missed Grace, for her manner had changed,
directly the cab was gone.</p>
<p>"Now I am going to know all about it," said Mary. "You are the dearest
friend I have ever made as yet, and it hurts me for you to keep a secret from
me."</p>
<p>"What a change!" Connie said, a smile flashing through her tears. "What has
become of the cold, reserved girl that I met some days ago at Victoria Station?
Well, I'll tell you what is the matter. You know that I lost those sketches the
night Mrs. Speed went away and left us in the lurch. They were badly needed,
and I could not supply them. They had to fake up some old blocks and it caused
no end of trouble. The long and short of it is that last night I had a curt
intimation that I need not expect to get any more work for the Wheezer. It
means that my poor little weekly income has vanished for the present. It's very
hard just at a time when&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear," Mary cried, "how dreadful! And this is why you kept up
before&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Before Grace. I could not possibly tell her, it would have been hateful to
spoil her pleasure like that. But it has been hard work, Mary. Two or three
times to-day I have had to struggle to keep from positive blubbering. I hate to
snivel, but I suppose we are all prone to that at times. What to do I don't
know."</p>
<p>Mary looked up from the packs of postcards she was engaged upon.</p>
<p>"Please don't worry," she said, "it isn't as if we were penniless. I am
certain that you will get something to do before long."</p>
<p>"My dear girl, don't forget that the rent and the bread and butter go on
just the same. And don't forget either that whilst the grass grows the steed
starves."</p>
<p>"Not when the other steed has plenty of oats to spare," Mary laughed. "What
do you think of that for an epigram? If painting fails, I shall take to
literature. I'm quite sure that I shall be as good an author as an artist.
Don't think me hard or unsympathetic, Connie. I know how good you are, I know
that you would cheerfully share your last shilling with me, little as I deserve
it. And I am going to do the same by you. I have some three pounds left of the
money I borrowed from that convenient relative at the pawnshop, and I calculate
that I can raise quite two hundred pounds altogether. Within a short time you
will find fresh work to do."</p>
<p>Connie's tears were falling freely now. The burst of grief seemed to do her
good, for the sunny April smile flashed out again.</p>
<p>"You shall do as you like, dearest," she said. "Pride is a very sinful
luxury for people in my position. And I had forgotten all about that Pandora's
box of yours. It is just possible that on the strength of my Wheezer work I may
get a commission from the Honeysuckle Weekly. I believe they pay a slightly
better price than the other papers. Let us have an early lunch, and then I can
go the round of the offices. Don't worry if I am back late. And you can have a
good long afternoon at the postcards."</p>
<p>Mary had a long afternoon at the postcards indeed, for tea had been a thing
of the past for some time, and as yet Connie had not returned. Her head was
aching now and her hands were stiff with the toil. How hot and stifling it was,
how different to the coolness of the dower house. And Grace was there by this
time, doubtless.</p>
<p>Mary's day-dreams vanished suddenly at the sound of a cab outside. Connie
stepped out of the cab, followed by a tall, manly figure in a frock coat. From
his quiet air and manner Mary put the stranger down at once as a doctor. She
had little time to speculate as to that, for she saw to her distress that
Connie's hat was off and that her head was bandaged up with a handkerchief. She
staggered as she reached the pavement, and would have fallen but for the man by
her side. Mary flew to the door with words of quick sympathy on her lips. She
could see a curious tender smile on Connie's lips; her face was red; her eyes
were shining with some great happiness.</p>
<p>"Not much the matter," she said. "I got jumbled up in the Strand, and the
side-slipping of a motor threw me under a dray. The wheels did not go over me,
and I have not come home to die or anything of that kind. I got a blow on the
head, and I suppose I fainted. When I came to myself I was in Charing Cross
Hospital. Dr. Newcome was very kind to me, and insisted on seeing me home in a
cab. Strange as it may seem, Dr. Newcome is an old acquaintance of mine, Mary.
This is Miss Dashwood."</p>
<p>"I am very happy to see you," the doctor said in a pleasant voice. "I am
also glad to say that there is very little the matter with Miss Colam. I am
almost glad of the accident because it has brought Miss Colam and myself in
contact once more. I met her two years ago at Hastings, when I was getting over
a bad illness."</p>
<p>"Then Dr. Newcome is your doctor, Connie," Mary cried.</p>
<p>Connie flushed to her eyes. The stranger dropped his Evening Standard on the
table and affected to fold it neatly.</p>
<p>"I wish I could think so," he said. "We only met for a day. Dreadfully
unconventional, was it not? But I was very lonely at that time and very ill. My
outlook was rather gloomy, too. But I wanted to see Miss Colam again, and when
I got back to London I called at her rooms only to find her gone. I hope she
will believe me when I say that I have been looking for her ever since."</p>
<p>"The fortune of war," Connie said with a red face. "Nomads like ourselves
are always changing quarters. And here I am just as poor as I was that day at
Fairlight. I hope you can say more for your prospects, Dr. Newcome?"</p>
<p>"I have been very fortunate," Newcome said gravely. "A distant relative died
and left me some money. The money arrived just in time to enable me to buy an
exceedingly good practice. I was calling on a house surgeon friend of mine at
Charing Cross, when Miss Colam came in. And I do hope she won't change her
lodgings again without letting me know."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the significance of the last few words. Clearly
Connie had found the haven of rest for which her tired soul at times longed
for. Mary remembered what she had said as to the man to cling to for protection
in the hour of need, and what a blessed thing the man's love was for the lonely
and depressed. In her mind's eye Mary could see herself alone in those dingy
lodgings, painting her postcards and waiting for, what? It was, perhaps natural
that the figure of Ralph Darnley should rise before her now.</p>
<p>"I won't," Connie promised. "You will come and see me again, Dr.
Newcome?"</p>
<p>Newcome promised eagerly. He would be in town again in a day or two. Would
the girls dine with him, and go to the theatre afterwards? He had an aunt in
London, who he was sure would join the party. He would ask her to call on
Connie.</p>
<p>"So this is an end of your trouble," Mary laughed, when Newcome had
departed. "It is quite plain to me that you will very soon have the share of
that practice at your disposal, dear. And if the happy expression of your face
means anything, it tells me that you are not going to refuse the offer."</p>
<p>Connie hid her blushing face and laughed. She remarked that Dr. Newcome had
left his paper behind him. With some show of interest, she turned over the
paper. Then she stopped, and a little cry broke from her.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mary, listen to this!" she exclaimed. "'Mysterious outrage in Dashwood
Park. Only this morning the body of a well dressed man was found lying in the
avenue of Dashwood Park, the residence of Sir Vincent Dashwood. Robbery appears
to have been the motive, for the pockets of the unfortunate man had been turned
out, and his watch and chain were gone. As the sufferer was in evening dress,
and had every appearance of being a gentleman, inquiries were made, with the
result that the gentleman has been identified as Ralph Darnley. He is at
present lying at the dower house in a precarious condition!'"</p>
<p>With a broken cry Mary rose to her feet. Her face was white as death and her
hands were convulsively locked together. In a faint voice she asked for a time
table; she wanted to know what time the next train went.</p>
<p>"You are going down to Dashwood?" Connie asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course I am," Mary wept. "I could not stay away. I must be near him
so that I may know how he is progressing. I must help to nurse him back to life
again. I owe him everything&mdash;my very existence, my new self, my womanhood
that has come as such a precious thing to me. And to think that once I was fool
enough to prefer pride to the affection of a man like that, who&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mary, Mary, you love him. You love Ralph Darnley like that!"</p>
<p>Mary's eyes shone with a strange light. She flung her hands above her head
despairingly.</p>
<p>"I know it now," she said, "now that it is perhaps too late. Yes, ever since
I first met Ralph I have loved him with my whole heart and soul."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-55" id="ch-55"></a>CHAPTER LV&mdash;NOT DEAD</h2>
<p>Mayfield's face was grim and set; there was just a flash of contempt in his
eyes for Speed, who was breathing hard. The dramatic part of the situation was
lost on Mr. George Dashwood, who could think of nothing else beyond the
speculative possibilities that Mayfield had been holding out to him.</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be any better," Mayfield said to Speed, "you look
ghastly. Anybody would think that you had been caught in some crime."</p>
<p>Behind the contemptuous words there was a note of warning to Speed. Anybody
less blind than George Dashwood would have noticed how agitated he was. Speed
caught just a glimpse of his own features in a quaint old mirror over the
fireplace. He could see that he was green and grey by turns; he started at his
own haggard face. Small wonder, then, that Mayfield had given him a
warning.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling like a corpse," he said. "It's agony for me to sit up any
longer. If you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed."</p>
<p>"Why not try the fresh air?" Dashwood suggested. "It is a cure
sometimes."</p>
<p>"Drizzling with rain," Speed replied. "Darnley turned up the collar of his
overcoat as he passed the window. I could see him from behind the screen. On
the whole, I should be far better between the sheets."</p>
<p>As he spoke Speed shot a questioning glance at Mayfield. The latter
nodded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would be as well," he said; "if you feel as seedy as that. I
must not be long, either, as I have to leave pretty early to-morrow. I'll just
finish my discussion with Mr. Dashwood over a cigar, and then I'll follow your
example. I suppose the butler comes around and fastens up all the windows?"</p>
<p>"The rest of the house," Speed explained. "I generally fasten the windows
here myself. I'll leave you to do it to-night, Mayfield. Don't forget. One
never knows what sort of person is hanging about a house like this."</p>
<p>Speed crept out of the room and across the hall, on the way to his room. He
was shaking from head to foot still and his legs were hardly equal to his
weight. He lighted a candle with a trembling hand, taking several matches to do
so. Out of the shadow came Slight, who watched his master with a curious
expression.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you will permit me to do that for you, sir?" he suggested
politely.</p>
<p>"Go away," Speed cried. "Go to bed. Think that I'm too drunk to light a
candle? Why do you follow me like this? Send my man to me. Gone to Longtown for
the night, has he? Oh, I recollect giving him permission now."</p>
<p>Speed staggered up the stairs, and into his own room. Once there, he opened
a cupboard and produced therefrom a bottle of brandy. He poured out half a
tumbler and drank it greedily. He placed his hands over his eyes as if to hide
some horrible vision. He was free now to give way to his feelings; he was no
longer under observation. He would have given ten years of his life to recall
the last half hour.</p>
<p>He sat there, gazing into space and making no effort to remove his clothes.
An hour passed; then there was a tap on the door. Speed started violently; he
was half afraid that the arm of the law was groping for him already. His face
cleared a little as Mayfield came in and closed the door very carefully.</p>
<p>"Well?" the latter said. "Are you getting over it? I'm more than sorry I
started this little business. If Dashwood had had any power of observation he
would have seen that there was something worse than illness the matter with you
to-night."</p>
<p>"It was awful," Speed groaned, "you would feel just the same if you'd done
it. All the time I was pretending to be ill behind the screen, I was standing
by the open window. I heard Darnley say good-night to you. I stood with the
loaded stick in my hand. And as he passed by the window under the veranda I
struck him down...He fell stone dead without a single groan. He lay there
absolutely still. And I would have forfeited all I had to recall those last few
moments. If you could have seen his face&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind that," Mayfield said brutally. "The thing is done and there
is an end of it. And you know perfectly well that you would do the same thing
again to-morrow. So he lies there in the verandah, does he? What about the
stick?"</p>
<p>"The stick is hidden in the laurel bushes. We can burn that when there is
time."</p>
<p>"To-night. Our work is not finished. Darnley must not lie there. We shall
have to carry him as far as the drive. It is a bit risky, but the thing must be
done. Everybody has gone to bed now. Dashwood and old Slight can testify that
neither of us have been out of the house since dinner time, so we are quite
safe."</p>
<p>"Let him lie where he is," Speed whispered, with chattering teeth. "People
will think that he came back for something after we had gone to bed, and that
he had encounter with some prowling burglar. That's just as good as your
plan."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't," Mayfield said impatiently. "Mine is much more artistic and
reasonable. We have saved our own necks; now we want to put suspicion upon
somebody outside. We've got to carry the body of Ralph Darnley as far as the
avenue; we've got to turn out his pockets as if he had been robbed. We can bury
what he has on him and destroy the loaded stick at the same time. Everybody has
gone to bed. Come along."</p>
<p>Speed protested and groaned. But it was all the same to Mayfield. He
contemptuously indicated the brandy bottle, and suggested that Speed should
derive a little fleeting courage from it. Another strong dose and Speed
declared himself to be ready.</p>
<p>They crept down into the hall and from thence into the darkened dining-room.
In the hall Speed hastily snatched a big Inverness cape from the stand. His
intention was obvious. He wanted to throw this over the body...It lay
there quite still under the shelter of the verandah; outside the rain was
gently pattering on the grass. With half averted head, Speed flung the cloak
over the still black form.</p>
<p>He was heedless of the rain; both were heedless of the rain by this time. It
was not a tiring work, for the night was warm, and Mayfield had caught a little
of Speed's nervous excitement. He did not notice that it was raining at all.
They staggered on for some five hundred yards along the avenue. Speed declared
that he could not go any farther.</p>
<p>"This will do," he panted in a hoarse whisper. "Under the oak tree. It's
just the very spot where a man would stop to light a cigar. You do the rest,
Mayfield."</p>
<p>Mayfield did the rest cautiously enough. It was the dark before dawn; the
birds were not yet awake. A rabbit dashed across the road, and Speed started.
Mayfield was only at work a moment; it seemed like ages to Speed. They stole
quietly back to the house without meeting anybody; they gained the dining-room
at length. It was just as they had left it, nothing to show that anybody had
been there. Then they were back once more in Speed's bedroom.</p>
<p>"I must have some more brandy," he said. "I believe I could drink the
bottle. You are not looking quite so cool and self-possessed as usual,
Mayfield. Take a drop."</p>
<p>"I hate the stuff," Mayfield growled. "All the same, I don't mind confessing
that I am just a little bit shaky. I could do it with some whisky. I suppose I
could find a decanter of it on the sideboard?"</p>
<p>"Always there," Speed explained. "There must have been some rain when we
were out, for my coat is quite damp. So is yours. Better take it off."</p>
<p>Mayfield peeled off his dress coat carelessly. He took the candle and
proceeded to make his way down the stairs once more. Surely enough the big
glass bottle of whisky stood on the side-board. Mayfield helped himself
liberally, and filled up the glass with a spurt of soda from a syphon. Somebody
behind him coughed.</p>
<p>"It's only me, sir," the thin respectful voice of Slight said. "I've got a
touch of neuralgia, and couldn't sleep, sir. And just now it seemed to me that
I heard somebody about. Got the idea of burglars into my head, sir."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Mayfield said with a suggestion of relief in his
tone. "I couldn't sleep either, so I came down for a drink."</p>
<p>Slight bowed respectfully. But his old eyes had not overlooked the fact that
little beads of wet glistened on Mayfield's trousers, and that his dress shoes
were spotted with mud. Very silently and respectfully he crept away up the back
stairs, and so to the room of one of the menservants&mdash;a young protege of
his. He was sleeping soundly enough as Slight laid a hand on his shoulder. He
struggled to a sitting posture.</p>
<p>"Mr. Slight," he said sleepily. "What is the matter? Is the house on fire?
Why you do look serious? What is the matter?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Slight replied. "It may be murder for all I know. And I
thought that I was too clever for those two chaps. Get up and dress yourself,
Walters. As soon as ever it is light we've got something to do. Don't sit there
asking a lot of foolish questions. How did they manage it when he went so
early?"</p>
<p>Walters stared at the speaker, who pulled up abruptly.</p>
<p>"I dare say you think I am talking nonsense," he said. "Nothing of the kind,
my lad. Just put your clothes on and come as far as my room. If anything has
happened to that bonny lad of mine, I'll never forgive myself."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-56" id="ch-56"></a>CHAPTER LVI&mdash;FOUND!</h2>
<p>The morning was just breaking as Slight and his companion left the house. By
the time that it was possible to see they began their search. By this time too,
Walters had more than an inkling of what was wrong. They went first in the
direction of the dower house and then back again to the avenue. It was broad
daylight now, and the sun was climbing up over the hills behind the river.
Nobody was to be seen yet, nothing heard but the mad song of the birds
welcoming the glory of the morning. Presently Walters paused and pointed to a
black huddled object under one of the great oaks.</p>
<p>"What's that?" he whispered with a blanched face. "It looks like a man
sleeping there."</p>
<p>A cry half of anger, half despair, broke from Slight. He crossed the drive
and fell on his knees by the side of the limp figure. His tears ran without
restraint down the old man's withered face. He was beside himself with
grief.</p>
<p>"It's Master Ralph," he moaned. "I knew that I should find him like this.
But when he went off so early last night I felt that that message had done
those two ruffians. It made me feel easier in my mind. If I'd told him of my
suspicions he would only have laughed at me. And to think that I should find
him dead like this."</p>
<p>"Perhaps he isn't dead," Walters suggested in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, not. You are a sensible young chap Walters. He isn't dead, either.
I can feel him breathing. Good job it was a warm night. Good job, too, he lay
under a tree so that the wet couldn't get at him. There's blood all over the
back of his head. A nice murderous crack he got there. And here am I doddering
like a silly old woman, whilst there is work to be done. Go over to the corner
of the wood yonder, and pull up one of those gorsed hurdles there. Be sharp,
boy."</p>
<p>Walters returned presently, dragging after him a hurdle which was filled
with gorse. And then on this, with their coats and vests under his head, they
laid their unconscious burden. A faint groan broke from Ralph; he opened his
eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>"It's concussion of the brain, that's what it is," Slight said, with tears
running down his face freely. "I've helped once or twice in the hunting field
before now. Just you get hold of the other end of the hurdle, and start off on
the left foot. We'll get Mr. Ralph as far as the dower house and send for a
doctor."</p>
<p>It was not far away to the dower house, the inmates of which were speedily
aroused. A little time later and one of the footmen was riding for a doctor.
They made Ralph as comfortable as possible. Lady Dashwood came into the
dining-room presently, where Slight was waiting to see her.</p>
<p>"This is a very dreadful business, Slight," she said. "Mr. Ralph was robbed
and half murdered on his way from the Hall, they say. Strange that you found
him."</p>
<p>"Not so very strange, my lady," Slight replied, "seeing that I set out early
to look for him. I thought last night when your message came&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What message do you mean? I sent no message to the Hall."</p>
<p>"Well, that's very strange! Mr. Mayfield is staying at the Hall. He told Mr.
Ralph that you wanted to see him very particularly last night, and he left
early in consequence. Call me an old fool if you like, my lady, but I had a
fancy that those two men meant mischief to Mr. Ralph. I couldn't sleep for
thinking of it. I came down-stairs very early this morning, and I found that
Mayfield, not yet undressed, helping himself to whiskey and soda. And there was
mud on his dress shoes. I couldn't stand it any longer, so I set out at
daybreak to look for I didn't quite know what. And I found Mr. Ralph. How those
fellows managed it, I can't say, but they did manage it. And it is no fault of
theirs that they're not a pair of cold-blooded murderers."</p>
<p>The doctor came presently. He was upstairs for a long time, but when he came
down again his face was not so grave as might be expected.</p>
<p>"A bad blow," he explained. "A bad concussion, but no brain injury as far as
I can judge. And the patient is going on as well as I could expect. Oh, no, he
isn't going to die. He has too good a constitution for that, and he has taken
good care of himself. I'll come back in the course of an hour or so and report
again."</p>
<p>There was nothing for it now but to wait and hope for the best and keep the
patient quiet. Well satisfied with his efforts, Slight returned to the Hall.
When he got back there he found that Mayfield had already departed. Speed,
restless and irritable, and giving the impression that he had breakfasted on
something potent, demanded to know where Slight had been. Mr. Dashwood had not
come down to breakfast yet.</p>
<p>"Where have you been gallivanting to?" Speed demanded imperiously. "I'll put
a stop to this. Pack up your traps and go. You'll not serve me any more."</p>
<p>"You never spoke a truer word than that," Slight said coolly. "I sha'n't
serve you any more, for the very good reason that you won't be here to serve.
If you raise a hand to me I'll break your head with this hot water jug, old man
as I am. I was out early this morning looking for a murderer's work, and I
found it. It was I who found the body of Mr. Ralph, and took it to the dower
house. And he is not dead; and what is more to the point he isn't going to die,
you cold-blooded assassin."</p>
<p>Speed's face turned a ghastly grey. His bluster had left him.</p>
<p>"I know now how it was done," Slight went on. "I guessed it all as soon as I
heard that Lady Dashwood sent no message as to wanting to see Mr. Ralph last
night. The dodge was to get him to leave the house and pass along the verandah.
You shammed being ill, and pretended that the light was too strong for you.
That enabled you to lie and wait till Mr. Ralph came along. Then you hit him
with a loaded stick, the one that used to hang in the gun room. James missed
that stick just now and told me so. And there poor Mr. Ralph lay till everybody
had gone to bed. Then you stole out and carried him as far as the big oak tree,
and left him there with his pockets all turned out as if robbery had been the
motive. But one thing gave you away. Mr. Ralph left the house when it was
raining. He walked under the balcony out of the rain till he was struck down by
you, so that he lay sheltered.</p>
<p>"If he had walked from the house to the oak tree, under which we found him,
his clothes would have been all wet. Whereas they were perfectly dry.
Therefore, his body must have been carried to the old oak after the murderous
assault had been committed. Probably you threw some kind of wrap over the body
in case you met anybody&mdash;rabbit poachers or the like. Oh, you are very
clever, sir, but you didn't work your plans quite so secure as you might. You
have so arranged it that you can call Mr. Dashwood as a witness to prove that
you had not been outside the house after Mr. Ralph left; but there are other
things. I came down early this morning to find Mr. Mayfield here at the whisky
and soda. His dress shoes were covered with mud. I've got those dress shoes,
for I sent Walters home to get them."</p>
<p>Speed started again. He recollected now that Mayfield had made a fuss before
starting over the loss of his evening slippers.</p>
<p>"And I've got yours," Slight went on. "I've got proof that you were both out
in the rain last night, after everybody had gone to bed. And Mr. Ralph isn't
dead. And before very long I shall have the pleasure of giving evidence against
you both, and seeing that you don't either of you do any harm to society for
some years to come. And I don't altogether absolve Mr. Ralph from blame. If he
had spoken out in the first place, all this trouble would have been saved. If
he had said openly, 'I am Sir Ralph Dashwood,' why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He isn't," Speed said feebly. "I am Sir Vincent&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Vincent fiddlestick," Slight cried shrilly. "Just as if I didn't know who
you were after seeing Sir Ralph for the first time after his return. I was a
blind old fool not to have guessed from the start. I might have known where you
learned all the family secrets. And when Sir Ralph came home my eyes were
opened. He would not let me say anything, for he had his own reasons for
concealing the truth for the present. But I knew who you were when I spotted
who your mother was, Mr. Vincent Speed."</p>
<p>The wretched listener made no response. It was hopeless to continue the
fight in the face of such evidence as this. Slight still held the hot water jug
in his hand, ready for anything in the shape of an assault, but he need not
have been alarmed.</p>
<p>"You are not so clever by half as you think you are," Slight went on. "You
have only been the cat's paw of Mayfield all along. He knew all about Sir
Ralph, though he may not have known my young master's reasons for concealing
his identity. If this murder had been successful, and you had not been found
out, what would have happened? Mayfield would have had you betrayed and kicked
out of the house, and Mr. Dashwood, as Sir George, would have come into the
title and estates again. And Mayfield would have married Miss Mary. That was
Mayfield's little game as far as I can see it. I may be an old man, but I'm not
quite devoid of wit for all that. And that's why I am no longer in your
service, and so you can make the best of it."</p>
<p>Slight marched out of the room, feeling that he had vindicated his position
and his manhood. Speed stood there gnawing his nails, sick at heart, fearsome
of every sound. He was a fugitive now, ready to fly, eager to be away, but with
no settled plan of action. His one idea was to be off to London now and see
Mayfield.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-57" id="ch-57"></a>CHAPTER LVII&mdash;A CLEAN BREAST OF IT</h2>
<p>There were strange rumours in the air; the servants at the Hall were asking
thrilling questions in whispers. Nobody seemed to know anything but Slight, who
kept his counsel. Everything was going to come right in a day or two; all they
had to do was to go about their business quietly. Late in the afternoon it
became known that Sir Vincent had vanished, and within an hour or two, strange
men with an air of authority were calling at the Hall and asking questions. Mr.
Dashwood had gone over to the dower house to see what was really wrong. He
found Lady Dashwood in the dining-room in deep discussion with the family
solicitor, Mr. Morley.</p>
<p>"What is all this I hear?" Dashwood asked. "The new head of the family has
vanished, and I'm told that he and Mayfield tried to murder Ralph Darnley last
night. Slight has told me a great deal, but he will not say anything as to the
motive for the extraordinary crime. He says he prefers to leave me to hear the
truth from Lady Dashwood."</p>
<p>"Or from me," Mr. Morley said grimly. "As I have said all along, you have
been the victim of a most impudent imposter&mdash;the son of a woman called
Speed. Lady Dashwood has just been telling me the whole history of the painful
case. I need not go into that at length, Mr. Dashwood, as it is a confidential
matter. She was a sister of the late Mr. Ralph Dashwood's first wife, which
accounts for many things that that impudent impostor knew. I hear that the
police have taken out a warrant for the arrest of this Speed and his companion
in crime, Horace Mayfield. In any case, they are not likely to trouble us
again."</p>
<p>George Dashwood responded suitably. He hoped that Mr. Ralph Darnley was in
no danger. At the same time he could not be blind to the fact that the amazing
change in the condition of affairs made a great difference to his own position.
He had suffered the most from the machinations of the rascal who had so
deceived them all. Also, he could see now that he was free for ever from the
persecutions of Horace Mayfield. He felt quite proud and self-important; his
position took definite shape before him.</p>
<p>"In that case," he said, "we revert to the old condition of affairs. As a
matter of fact, I have never had any occasion to drop the title to
which&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, sir," Morley said drily. "You never had any more right to it
than the wretched criminal who at the present moment is flying from justice.
The young man you know as Ralph Darnley is really Sir Ralph Dashwood. Lady
Dashwood has just given me the most absolute proofs of his identity. Besides,
just before his death, the last Ralph Dashwood wrote to me and explained
everything. It was the new head of the family who asked me to let Vincent Speed
have his lead for a time. I believe there was some quixotic and sentimental
reason to account for this conduct on Sir Ralph's part. On that head Lady
Dashwood can speak more definitely than I can."</p>
<p>"When the time comes," Lady Dashwood murmured. "It is exactly as Mr. Morley
says, George. And I am glad to say the doctor reports very favourably of Ralph
this afternoon. If you had ever known my son, George, you would not have
doubted the identity of young Ralph directly you cast eyes on him. I would
rather not tell you as yet the real reason why he wished to be known as Ralph
Darnley."</p>
<p>George Dashwood was very disappointed. Yet, on the whole, things might have
been worse. He had never disguised from himself that the deposed impostor was
anything but a gentleman. And his position at the Hall might have been a
comfortable one, but it was full of humiliation. These things Dashwood spoke of
as he walked with Morley down the avenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lady Dashwood was spending her time between the dining-room and
the bedroom wherein Ralph lay. She was sorry for all the anxiety and misery on
the very day that Grace Cameron had arrived, but she had found the girl a great
comfort to her, she was so quiet and resourceful, so ready to help. The doctor
had called again for the third time just before dinner, and his report was as
favourable as before. Lady Dashwood and Grace were sitting down to something in
the way of dinner.</p>
<p>"I have been thinking," Grace said. "Mary ought to know of this."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood started and laid down her knife and fork. She had forgotten
all about Mary.</p>
<p>"She had quite escaped my memory," she confessed. "She will be very
distressed because she rather likes Ralph, and he saved her life on more than
one occasion. But Ralph is masterful and Mary is proud. Of course, I know what
Ralph's feelings are, and I may say that he was instrumental in getting her out
into the world. Oh, my dear, I think you can guess what the dream of my life is
as to those two people."</p>
<p>Grace smiled with ready sympathy. Her delicate face flushed.</p>
<p>"It will not be a dream much longer or I am greatly mistaken," she said.
"Mary loves that man. I know by the way she speaks of him. And Connie Colam has
told me. I don't want to be inquisitive, Lady Dashwood, but I should like to
hear the story of that romance. Connie says that I should hardly know Mary if I
had met her on the first day in London. She was hard and proud and distant, and
she deliberately allowed the ice to grow round her heart; she was eaten up with
family pride. And she learned her lesson in two days. I could see her change,
as a butterfly newly out changes in the sun. I dare say you may call that a
ridiculous simile, but I can't think of a better. And when Connie spoke to her
of love and the advantages of love over everything else she came to guess. I am
sure that Ralph Darnley has told her that he cares for her."</p>
<p>"That is so," Lady Dashwood smiled. "He is a very masterful young man, as I
told you before. And I fancy he told Mary that he would win her in spite of
everything. He has taken his own way of doing it, as you may hear some day. But
if all you say is true, I am not going to spoil Mary's pleasure in the telling
of her pretty love story. So you think that Mary ought to know what has
happened? You think that if we send her a telegram she will come down here at
once?"</p>
<p>"I am certain of it," Grace cried. "She will be displeased with us that we
had forgotten. It is all going to come right, Lady Dashwood. Your dream is
coming true, and Mary will be a happy girl yet."</p>
<p>Lady Dashwood smiled as she reached for the telegram forms. She wondered if
it would be possible for Mary to reach the dower house that night. Presently a
cab crept along the drive; no doubt it was the doctor coming to call once more.
Then Grace gave a cry of pleasure as the cab door opened and a slender figure
in black jumped out.</p>
<p>"She is here, Lady Dashwood," the girl exclaimed. "Mary! She must have
heard. These things find their way into London evening papers directly."</p>
<p>The door of the dining-room opened and Mary came in. She was pale and
agitated; she had her hand to her heart. It was some time before she could
speak. She glanced from one to the other, as if not daring to ask what was
trembling on the tip of her tongue. Her eyes filled with relief as she noted
the welcome on the faces of the others.</p>
<p>"He is better?" she gasped. "He is not dead. I&mdash;I was afraid to ask.
Oh, if you only knew the gnawing agony of the last hour! I saw it in one of the
evening papers. I flew down here as soon as possible. And how is he&mdash;how
is Ralph?"</p>
<p>Deeply touched as she was, Lady Dashwood smiled. She was glad to hear
Ralph's name come so naturally off Mary's tongue. It showed that she thought of
him by his Christian name.</p>
<p>"He is much better," she said. "The doctor gives a very good report. And he
is not in the least likely to die this time."</p>
<p>"You might have let me know," Mary said reproachfully. "It would have saved
a deal of anxiety. And I am quite sure that in his heart you know
that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You loved the man who is lying upstairs," Grace said gently.</p>
<p>Mary's pale face flushed; a yearning look came into her eyes,</p>
<p>"You have finished the confession for me," she cried. "I did not know, I
could not guess till I saw that dreadful paper. And then it came to me that a
great blank would come into my life if Ralph died. He said that I should learn
my lesson, and I have done so. It has not taken me long to learn the difference
between the false and the true, and that love is everything, and money and
position are nothing by the side of it. And then as if some veil had been
lifted from my eyes, I saw that I had cared for Ralph all the time. He told me
once that I should come to him on my knees and ask forgiveness. I am ready to
do it now."</p>
<p>The girl's voice rose loud and clear; she looked very sweet and womanly in
her self-abnegation. She felt all the better for her confession, as if a weight
had been lifted from her soul. Lady Dashwood would have said nothing in reply,
but the door opened at the same moment and the nurse came in.</p>
<p>"Mr. Darnley is conscious, my lady," she said. "He asked for you. It will do
no harm if you see him for one moment. He seems troubled to think that he is in
your room&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mary darted for the door. Before anybody could interfere she was half-way up
the stairs. In the darkened room Ralph lay; he could catch the rustle of a
dress; he noted the faint fragrance of a woman's hair. Then Mary was kneeling
by the bedside, her cool, wet face pressed to Ralph's hot flushed one.</p>
<p>"I have come to you," she said. "My darling, I have come to you. My lesson
has been learned. My eyes have been opened. And I love you, Ralph. I have come
to tell you, and make my confession. On my knees, dear, on my knees, dear
heart, as you prophesied, I make it!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-58" id="ch-58"></a>CHAPTER LVIII&mdash;"THE KING IS
DEAD.&mdash;"</h2>
<p>Mr. George Dashwood was of opinion that things at the Hall were not as they
used to be in the old days. In the first place he had been compelled to walk up
from the station after ordering a trap to meet him on his return from Longtown,
and now he could see no sign of dinner. He had come downstairs in a temper, and
had looked into the dining-room as he passed.</p>
<p>It was eight o'clock to the moment; there was no sign of dinner. The banks
of ferns and the great silver bowls of roses were there, but nothing else.
Dashwood forgot for the moment that he was no longer master of the house, and
rang the bell. Slight came in presently. He was still wearing his morning
coat.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this?" Dashwood demanded. "I ordered a trap to meet
me at the station and no trap appears. Then I came back here to dinner, of
which I see no sign. Have the servants left the house in a body?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," Slight replied. "We have had a trying day. In the first place the
police&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, the police, have they been here? Is there any clue to the mysterious
attack upon Mr.&mdash;er, Ralph Darnley? I had to go into Longtown to-day; I
did not expect to get back here till late. If your master has suddenly been
called to town&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He has vanished, sir," Slight said, "you may not be so very much surprised
to hear that he was at the bottom of the attack on Mr. Ralph&mdash;leastways
I'll speak of him as Mr. Ralph for the present. In a manner of speaking, it was
I who found the whole thing out. Perhaps it was foolish of me to do so, but I
couldn't help letting that rascal know all about it. He went off in a great
hurry this morning, and I for one shall be very much surprised if we ever see
him again. In a manner of speaking, we are like a lot of servants in bear
cages&mdash;nobody to look after us or give any orders. Me and the housekeeper
are doing what we can, sir, in the hopes that Lady Dashwood will come over
to-morrow and take charge. And that's why your dinner is forgotten."</p>
<p>"We will let it pass," Dashwood said with great magnanimity. "In the present
extraordinary circumstances, I suppose that I cannot complain. If you could get
me some cold chicken and salad, Slight, I dare say I could manage. And perhaps
you will be so good as to wait on me yourself, seeing that you are so far in
the confidences of the family. And perhaps you will give me an idea of what has
happened."</p>
<p>The salad and chicken were served presently, and the meal together with the
champagne, went far to salve Dashwood's wounded dignity. A cigarette completed
the process.</p>
<p>"Now tell me everything," he said. "Mind you, you must be wrong as to our
late host having anything to do with the outrage on Ralph Darnley."</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, sir," Slight replied. "Why, the thing was as good as
admitted. To call him by his proper name, Vincent Speed saw that the game was
up. Mind you, servants hear a great deal more than their employers give them
credit for, and I know that in some way Speed was under the thumb of that
scoundrel Mayfield. How you could ever have tolerated him in the house, beats
me, sir."</p>
<p>"I was also under the thumb of Mayfield," Dashwood murmured. "He was the
sort of man who always got his own way, and he was not in the least scrupulous
as to his methods. Possibly he knew who Speed really was."</p>
<p>"That's it, sir," Slight said eagerly. "He was after money. Well, Speed
found out that Mr. Ralph was the real heir, and that his time here was limited.
I dare say Speed got that information from his mother. I suppose it never
occurred to the fool that both Lady Dashwood and myself knew who Mr. Ralph
was."</p>
<p>"How did you know?" Dashwood asked. "I'm sure I didn't."</p>
<p>"Because you never met Mr. Ralph's father, sir. The likeness is a speaking
one. The very first day that Mr. Ralph arrived here, I knew that you had no
right to be in this house at all, sir. The same when Speed came
along&mdash;though I'm bound to admit that he took me in at first."</p>
<p>"But the whole thing is inexplicable," Dashwood said irritably. "Why this
masquerade? Why was Speed permitted to oust me at all? And why did I remain
here?"</p>
<p>Slight had his opinion, but it was not his plan to utter this. He shook his
head with an air of wisdom. Perhaps Miss Mary could explain that part. At any
rate, if she could not do so, Lady Dashwood could solve the problem.</p>
<p>"Well, it really doesn't matter," Dashwood exclaimed. "Get on with your
story. What had Speed to do with the disgraceful attack on Ralph Darnley?"</p>
<p>"He struck the blow, sir," Slight proceeded. "The murderous plot was
arranged between Speed and Mayfield. It was necessary to get Mr. Ralph out of
the way, and they determined to do it. For that purpose Mr. Ralph was invited
to dine at the Hall. The game was to get him out of the way in such a manner as
would not throw the slightest suspicion on those ruffians. They picked out you,
sir, to be their witness as to the fact."</p>
<p>"But they were not out of the house," Dashwood protested. "Neither of them
left the dining-room till bedtime, and we all went to bed together. And Speed
had such a dreadful bilious attack that he was good for nothing. I have no
reason to love either of those fellows, but I should be compelled to exonerate
them."</p>
<p>"It was clever," Slight admitted. "At the same time, it was Speed who did
it. He sat behind the screen over yonder, sir, but the window leading to the
balcony was open. Perhaps you will call to mind how Mayfield left the table to
fetch his cigar case. Then he came back with a message to the effect that Lady
Dashwood wanted to see Mr. Ralph on his way home. I have had it from her
Ladyship's lips that she sent no message of the kind. Still, the supposed
message had the desired effect for it took Mr. Ralph past the balcony; Speed
had only to pop out and knock him on the head, which he did. All the time you
thought that he was simply sitting in the armchair behind the screen."</p>
<p>"Incredible, but possible," Dashwood murmured. "Go on, Slight."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, I was frightened. I felt that there was something dark going on,
and I didn't go to bed. I came downstairs and found Mayfield drinking whisky
and soda not long before daylight. And his dress slippers were all over dirt. I
got hold of Speed's pumps, too, and they were as bad. That told me a story. I
made Walters get up, and together we began a search. At the foot of one of the
oak trees in the park we found Mr. Ralph. Though it had been raining at the
time he left here, his clothes were quite dry, though we found him nearly half
a mile from the house. Then I knew quite well that the body had been carried
there. That the pockets being turned out was only to make it look like robbery.
And I taxed Speed with it. I gave him chapter and verse for everything, and
he's gone. And, what's more, I know what his game is. I got that from the
telegrams he sent and the timetable he left about. He's gone to Weymouth on his
way to Jersey. When he reaches Weymouth, he'll charter a fishing boat to take
him as far as Jersey. It's no great distance, and for a little time he will be
safe there. From Jersey he can easily get across to Granville by a sailing
boat."</p>
<p>The more Dashwood thought this over the more was he disposed to agree with
the old servant. It was good, at any rate, to know that he was no longer likely
to suffer at the hands of Mayfield, for that rascal would have to fly also. No
doubt Speed had given his fellow-conspirator a hint of what had happened, and
that by this time he, too, was on his way to some place of safety. With these
thoughts uppermost in his mind, Dashwood walked across the park in the
direction of the dower house.</p>
<p>It was not yet dark, and Lady Dashwood was walking in the garden. There was
a look of peace and happiness on her face that Dashwood had never seen there
before. It was, at any rate, a good omen as to the progress of the patient.</p>
<p>"I have been having a long talk with Slight," Dashwood explained. "He has
been giving me some astounding information. I have been in Longtown all day,
and when I came back Speed had vanished. And Slight had afforded very cogent
reasons for his disappearance. Only I am utterly in the dark as to why Ralph
Darnley has behaved in this way. Slight suggests that you know."</p>
<p>"I do," Lady Dashwood smiled. "It is a very pretty story, and I think that
even you will be touched when it comes to be told. In the meantime, there is
one thing that I will ask you to do&mdash;please say nothing to Mary as to who
Ralph really is till you have permission."</p>
<p>"I can promise that all the more readily because I am not likely to see
Mary," Dashwood said in a grieved tone. "The child has behaved very badly to
me; she seems to forget that I am her father. So long as she remains in
London&mdash;"</p>
<p>"She is not in London, George. She has come back, and so far as I can judge,
is not in the least likely to return to London again. Directly she heard of
Ralph's accident, she came here at once to nurse him. Do not forget that she
owes her life to Ralph. And do not forget that he loves the very ground she
walks on. If my memory serves me correctly, he told you as much when you were
doing your best to sell your child to that scoundrel Mayfield. If you refrain
from interfering, that romance will end happily."</p>
<p>"By Jove, you don't mean it?" Dashwood cried. Visions of himself,
comfortably housed and fed at Dashwood, rose before his eyes. It was not quite
like being the master of the house, but it was the next best thing. "What a
fortunate circumstance! Really, my dear lady, I appear to be luckier than I
deserve."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-59" id="ch-59"></a>CHAPTER LIX&mdash;"LONG LIVE THE KING!"</h2>
<p>On the whole it was a most marvellous recovery. The nurse had been a little
severe on Mary; she had had no business to fly to the bedroom of the patient in
that way. But Ralph was most emphatically of the opinion that Mary's action had
hastened his convalescence. At the end of the week he was in the drawing-room
with the windows open, so that he could catch the sweet fragrance of the summer
air, and the doctor was jokingly congratulating him on the thickness of his
skull. The London police had been very busy during the past week, but as yet no
success had rewarded their efforts. Ralph had said nothing; it was deemed far
wiser not to allude to the attack at present, and old Slight had remained
silent in the presence of the detectives. Their superior air irritated him and,
therefore, he kept his knowledge to himself.</p>
<p>As to the rest, George Dashwood was in Paris. He had been sent there on an
errand by Lady Dashwood, who wanted him out of the way. The chatelaine of the
dower house was afraid lest George Dashwood should speak out and spoil
everything. And Mary had more or less made her peace with her father, who had
forgiven her.</p>
<p>"I've no doubt you thought that you were acting for the best," he said. "You
are not quite old enough fully to appreciate what is due to the family pride.
Still, as nobody knows that you have so far forgotten yourself as to try to
earn your own living, it does not much matter. I suppose you have done nothing
to be ashamed of."</p>
<p>Mary replied with becoming meekness that she hoped so. Only a little time
before she would have flung back the suggestion with passionate scorn. But
lately she had become more cheerful and gayer in her disposition. Still, the
situation was not without its humorous side. It was not for Mary to point out
to her father what a humiliating position he had occupied when he had accepted
the impostor's offer of a home at the Hall. But as yet Mary knew nothing of the
impostor's downfall, or the real story of the outrage on Ralph. All that was to
come. So George Dashwood departed on his errand to Paris, and the mistress of
the dower house breathed more freely.</p>
<p>The nurse had gone now; her services were no longer required. And to-morrow
the doctor had told Ralph that he could walk across the park if he liked. The
next day was a wet one, however, so there was no opportunity. The third day
broke gloriously fine, and Ralph came down to breakfast, a little pale and
shaky, but almost himself again. Lady Dashwood was reading the paper with a
grave face. It was not until the meal was over that she drew Ralph aside.</p>
<p>"I am going to speak freely to you," she said. "It is a strange thing that
you have never asked if we had found anything out about your accident."</p>
<p>"I was waiting for you to speak," Ralph said. "As for myself, I remember
nothing. The night I was dining at the Hall, Mayfield gave me a cigar. Almost
as soon as I reached the open air, I became so drowsy that I could have fallen
down and gone to sleep. A sudden pain darted through my head, and I recollected
no more till I came to myself here, and found that Mary was on her knees by the
side of my bed. Did I dream that, or did Mary come then and say that she loved
me? It was only for a few minutes that I was conscious."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that that was real enough," Lady Dashwood smiled tenderly.
"Mary did rush up to your room, and a fine scolding she got from the nurse for
it. But you can settle all that with our dear girl later. Let us get one thing
over at a time. You have not the slightest idea who made that attack on
you?"</p>
<p>Ralph confessed that such was the case, and Lady Dashwood proceeded to
enlighten him. She told Ralph everything that she had gleaned for herself, and
that Slight had acquainted her with. Ralph's face was very grave and stern as
he listened to the story.</p>
<p>"A very pretty plot," he said. "I can see it all quite clearly now. It was
invented by Mayfield. It never occurred to me till now that Mayfield guessed
who I was. You see he had seen my father. Very lately Mayfield had been in dire
need of money. I had seen to that. He could guess why I stood aside and let it
appear as if Speed was the heir of the property; he could see that I did this
to save Mary, knowing that I could stop it later and claim my own. But this
gave Mayfield a chance to blackmail Speed whilst he had a grip on the family
exchequer. After that was done, Speed could go hang, as far as Mayfield was
concerned. The whole thing was spoiled by my chance meeting with Speed in his
mother's house. She could tell him who I really was. Hence the plot that nearly
killed me. Perhaps I have been a little bit too clever. If ever I come across
my friend Vincent Speed again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You will never do that," Lady Dashwood said. "The man is dead. He perished
in yesterday's stormy crossing from Jersey to Granville in a ricketty boat.
There is a paragraph here in the papers. The man seems to have assumed his own
name again, for his linen was marked Vincent Speed. And old Slight told me that
he meant to escape in that way. On the whole, my dear Ralph, it will be just as
well to save scandal as much as possible. Of course, the neighbours will
naturally want to know a great deal, but we need not talk too much."</p>
<p>"I quite agree with that, though I fancy that the family pride will get
short shrift from me," Ralph laughed. "You had better put it down to the fact
that I had a democratic mother. But have you heard anything of Mayfield?"</p>
<p>"He has gone, Ralph, nobody knows where. There was a good deal about him in
yesterday's papers&mdash;the disappearance of a City man, and strange stories
of his swindled clients. I understand that a warrant on some charge or another
has been obtained for his arrest. But he will never be found, Ralph; he is too
cunning for that. On the whole, it will be better for you to tell the simple
truth, that you had not the slightest idea who caused your accident."</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I haven't," Ralph said. "But, of course, Mary
must know all these things. I can only rejoice in the misfortune that has
brought us together, and opened her eyes to the truth that love is best of all
things. I suppose she has no idea&mdash;"</p>
<p>"None whatever," Lady Dashwood said eagerly. "Slight will say nothing, and
George Dashwood has been got out of the way on purpose. But is it not time, my
dear boy, that Mary should be told the whole story? You need not fear any
longer that her heart is given to Ralph Darnley, and that Sir Ralph Dashwood is
quite a secondary consideration."</p>
<p>Ralph laughed with a tender inflection in his voice.</p>
<p>"I was going to do it after lunch," he said. "And positively I feel quite
nervous about it. You are very anxious to see us married, grandmother?"</p>
<p>"It will be the crowning happiness of a miserable life," Lady Dashwood said.
"I have already told you the story of my past, of the sin that cost one life
and wrecked the happiness of two others. For that sin I have fully atoned; I
fancy that my punishment is ended, and that is the one thing that you are never
to tell our dear Mary."</p>
<p>Ralph promised solemnly. After a pause Lady Dashwood proceeded:</p>
<p>"Now you know everything," she said. "I want to see my boy soon back in his
proper place; I want to see the best ruler that Dashwood ever had. We have been
too proud and cold in the past, and have thought more of our dignity than of
the comfort and happiness of those dependent upon us. But I see that that is
not going to be your way, and I rejoice in the knowledge. And in future I know
that it is not going to be Mary's way, either. And if the evening of my life is
going to be finished in the sunshine, I shall not regret the past. All I want
to do now is to see a child of yours and Mary's on my lap, and...that's
all, Ralph."</p>
<p>Ralph rose and kissed the speaker tenderly. He quite understood her
feelings.</p>
<p>"God grant that it may be as you say," he murmured. "But I feel so anxious.
And till now I have been quite strong in the knowledge that I should win Mary
in the long run. She could never have married Mayfield; I had only to declare
myself, and that was finished. But I saw the way to open the eyes of my dear
one, and I did it. Still, I wish it was all over, the confession made, and my
forgiveness freely offered. By tea time I shall know."</p>
<p>It was a quiet but very happy little party that gathered presently at the
luncheon table. Mary was soft and subdued; she had not forgotten the night of
her return, and the way in which she had knelt by Ralph's bedside, and told him
of her love. From that day the subject had not been alluded to between them,
for Mary had rather avoided Ralph save in the presence of others. But when she
met his glance from time to time, she knew that all was well, and that the
sacrifice she had made was the crowning blessing of her life.</p>
<p>"How sweet those roses are!" she said, as she plunged her heated face into a
bowl of blossoms. "I used to smell those roses all the time I was in London.
Really, I pretended to be very independent and all that kind of thing, but I'm
afraid I should never have been able to stand the life. I should have run down
here, and pretended that I was not well enough to return."</p>
<p>"Not you," Grace laughed. "Now, with me the case is different. It is
essential to good art that we should have congenial surroundings. Do you know
that I have done three solid hours' work to-day without feeling the least
fatigue! If I had attempted such a thing in London, I should have been knocked
up for a week."</p>
<p>"A few days have worked wonders in you," Ralph said. "In honour of the
occasion, we will go and have tea at the Hall. Mary and myself will go and make
all the arrangements, and you can follow with Lady Dashwood. What do you say,
Mary?"</p>
<p>"We are trespassers," the girl said, with a laugh and a blush. "Still, the
owner is away, and I am quite sure that Slight will give us a warm
welcome."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-60" id="ch-60"></a>CHAPTER LX&mdash;OPEN CONFESSION</h2>
<p>They had been very quiet for a long time as they sat in the rose garden
looking over the park. They could see the dappled deer under the great oaks;
the shadow of the fine old house lay behind. There was something very soothing
and peaceful about the picture. It was Ralph who spoke presently; he had Mary's
hand in his, and she did not draw it away.</p>
<p>"It is a pity to lose this," he said, "to know that it has gone for ever.
Mary, you were better and braver far than you knew, when you turned your back
on Dashwood Hall."</p>
<p>"Was I?" Mary asked absently. "It will always be a sadness and a sorrow to
me, more from the knowledge of what I might have some day made the place than
anything else. But I need not dwell on that. I have my living to get now."</p>
<p>"And I suppose I have mine," Ralph said. "Mary, you know what is on the tip
of my tongue. Could you share that lot with me? But I know that you would; I
know what your feelings are. You told me the night you came back here; you said
that my prophecy had come true; that you had returned to ask my pardon on your
knees. Do you regret that?"</p>
<p>"No," Mary said resolutely. "I do not regret it for a moment. Because it was
true then, and it is truer now. It was Connie who taught me that lesson, I
think. She pointed out to me what a good thing a man's love was. And when I
thought that I had lost you, why, then I knew what my mind was. If I am worth
the taking, Ralph&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My darling, you were always worth the taking," Ralph cried. "Even in the
days of your pride I had dreams of the sweet Mary that would like you to love
her, and behold, here she is! And you are prepared to share the lot of a poor
man without even a pedigree?"</p>
<p>Mary swayed towards her lover, and he caught her in his eager arms. The next
minute her face was hidden on his breast, happy tears rolling down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"Don't," she whispered. "Oh, please don't remind me of that, Ralph. From the
bottom of my heart I love you; I must have loved you from the very first. What
does it matter what you are, so long as you are what you are&mdash;a good man,
with a kind heart for a foolish girl like me? I am prepared to share your lot,
and go where you like, Ralph; anywhere you choose to take me. We shall be very
poor, I suppose, but that does not matter. I am glad, glad that the day came
when I had to leave the Hall."</p>
<p>"And if you never return you will not regret it, Mary?"</p>
<p>"No, Ralph, not with you by my side. And as to poverty, why, it could not be
worse than what I have gone through lately. We shall be very poor, Ralph."</p>
<p>"Not so very poor," Ralph smiled. There was nobody near to see them, so the
girl's head rested happily on Ralph's shoulder, his arm round her waist.
"Dearest, I have a confession to make to you. We are not poor at all."</p>
<p>"But I thought that you had lost everything, Ralph. That Mr. Mayfield had
your money. But don't let us talk about him. It makes me hot and cold all over.
To think that at one time there was more than a possibility that I
should&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, there was never the slightest possibility," said Ralph. "I have had all
the cards in the game from the very first. Mary, I am going to tell you a
little story; it is the history of a man who passed most of his early life in
America, where he did not see many people. He was quite a well-born man, but
his father had quarrelled with his relatives, and so he had not all the
advantages which were due to his station. But he was well brought up, and
prided himself that he had a high sense of honour.</p>
<p>"Well, in time, he came to Europe, and then he met the one woman that he
needed. She was very lovely, very proud, and very distant. But that young man
could see what lay under her pride, and he determined to win her for his wife.
She liked him, but she refused him. And for two years he did not meet her
again. Then he came to England, and accident brought those two together again.
In the meantime, the girl's father had come into possession of the family
estates, and the girl was more proud and distant than ever. And still that
young man was not dismayed.</p>
<p>"And now comes the strange part of my story. The young man, whose father had
died in the meantime, had come here to claim a title and a property. He had not
known anything of this till his father died, but he came, and his grandmother
recognized him at once. But that very same property and title had passed to the
girl's father. Now, the young man might have told the girl this, and doubtless
she would have married him. But he was a romantic young man, and desired to be
married for his own sake. Then another claimant to the property turned up, and
the young man pretended to back this impostor's claim. He did this, so that the
girl should go out in the world, as he felt that she would, and get her own
living. And his estimate of the girl was correct, for she did so."</p>
<p>"Go on," Mary whispered. "You can't tell how interested I am."</p>
<p>"Well, it was even as the young man had expected. The carefully-planned plot
succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations. The girl went out into the
world, and almost at once her better nature began to prevail. She saw the world
through other eyes; she learned what a wonderful and complex thing humanity is.
And when that young man saw the girl again he was astonished and delighted. He
did not regret his plot in the least. He knew now that here was the real girl
that he loved, deprived of her pride and hauteur, palpitating with love and
tender sympathy...In your case would you have forgiven that man,
Mary?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes," Mary cried. "Oh, I can read between the lines of your
parable. I am the girl and you are the man who has brought me to my senses.
Ralph, it sounds like a fairy story. And so you took this means of opening my
eyes, and showing me how small and narrow my world was. Forgive you? Could you
ever forgive me? And to think that you are the son of Ralph Dashwood come back
after all these years. And to think that Lady Dashwood should know and not tell
me. Marvellous!"</p>
<p>"I bound her to secrecy," Ralph explained. "And, really, things fell out
wonderfully for me. There was the incident of the fire and that match-box, for
instance; the incident that forced the impostor Speed to declare himself. For,
of course, you have guessed who the man who called himself Sir Vincent Dashwood
really was. I suppose we shall never hear who it was who tried to set the Hall
on fire."</p>
<p>Mary laughed happily through her tears.</p>
<p>"And you never found that out?" she said. "Why, I knew at once. And I was
horribly afraid lest the person should be found out and severely punished. Do
you recollect the night that those men took possession of the Hall, the night
when you tried to save me from Mayfield? Old Patience was there. It was one of
her lucid nights when she possessed her full intelligence. And she kept on
crying for somebody to smoke the rats out, for somebody who had courage to put
the match to the faggot. I found her quite late, and took her to sleep for the
night in my dressing-room. And when you came to save me, Patience had vanished.
I never had the slightest doubt who set the Hall on fire, and I hope that you
will not mention this to anybody, Ralph. Patience has quite forgotten it. I
alluded to the subject only yesterday, and she expressed her indignation."</p>
<p>"Well, that is the last of the mysteries cleared," Ralph said. "I suppose
the poor creature found that match-box somewhere. The next thing is to proclaim
myself, and then, Mary, you can come back to the Hall as mistress again."</p>
<p>"What happiness!" Mary whispered. "But a different kind of happiness to the
old. I shall hope a little later to see the old Hall a different place to what
it has ever been before. I should like to build a charming house close by for
the benefit of girls like my friends Connie and Grace. I owe them more than I
can ever repay; indeed, I owe humanity in general a deep debt of gratitude. You
will let me have my own way over this, Ralph, for I have set my heart on
it."</p>
<p>"It shall be as you say, darling," Ralph whispered, as he kissed the red
lips tenderly. "For the honour of the house, for now and evermore."</p>
