<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>THE Mahrajah of Curriebad was for the present located in Jermyn Street. On
the following day he was commanded to Windsor for the regulation dinner; in the
meantime he had practically chartered the hotel.</p>
<p>Morals the Mahrajah possessed none&mdash;they would have been perfectly
superfluous in any case&mdash;but money he had in plenty. For this reason the
India Office people were fond of him.</p>
<p>At the present moment they were desirous of getting something out of their
distinguished visitor: more territory, more men, an extra sack of diamonds; and
the Windsor interview was expected to clinch the business. Meantime the dusky
potentate winked the other eye. He fully appreciated the meaning of the phrase.
He had a private music-hall of his own at Curriebad.</p>
<p>Incidentally it may be mentioned that a more consummate rascal than Nana Rau
never drew the breath of life through shifty lips. Of his early career people
knew but little. They noted that he spoke excellent English, and that his
knowledge of the Stud-Book was not of a perfunctory character.</p>
<p>Nana Rau had just dined alone. As he lighted his second cigarette a servant
entered with the announcement that a visitor waited below. With rare
graciousness the Prince ordered the gentleman to be conveyed into his
presence.</p>
<p>He came, he bowed, he closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>"My name is Wilfred Vaughan, your Highness," he said.</p>
<p>The potentate nodded. The stranger prepossessed him, he was so exquisitely
dressed.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Mr. Vaughan," he said, "and take a cigarette. Then, if you
please, you can proceed to unfold your business."</p>
<p>"I am obliged to you. Ah, what it is to be an Eastern Potentate! Now, it
would be impossible for me to get cigarettes like these. My good friend, it is
possible that you have forgotten the old Oxford days?"</p>
<p>"That is a long time ago&mdash;twenty years," Nana Rau replied,
uneasily.</p>
<p>He felt uneasy, too. The India Office would have been surprised to hear that
Nana Rau had ever been at Oxford. But <i>then</i> he was not Nana Rau at all,
and four good lives stood between him and the sacks of Curriebad diamonds. Also
incidents had happened at Oxford which it was expedient should remain buried in
the silent tomb with the flowers blooming atop, and no white stone to mark
their memory. Even now, were those stories told, Nana Rau knew that his
connection with the throne of Curriebad would come to an abrupt conclusion.</p>
<p>"Twenty years are nothing," Vaughan said sententiously, "and my memory is
good."</p>
<p>"You are Vaughan of 'The House,' of course. What <i>can</i> you
remember?"</p>
<p>"Well, for instance," Vaughan smiled, "there was a pretty tobacconist's
assistant: she was found dead under very suspicious circumstances. About the
same time an Indian student at Christ Church disappeared. The police were
anxious to find him&mdash;<i>very</i> anxious. Strange to say he was never
heard of again; and, <i>until to-day</i>, I haven't seen him since."</p>
<p>Nana Rau recovered his equanimity. His thin lips ceased to twitch. He felt
that this was a mere matter of money.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200481h-images/1200481h-1.jpg" alt="MY MEMORY IS GOOD"></p>
<p>"Old chap," he said quite cordially, "what's the figure?"</p>
<p>"You always were a sensible man," Vaughan replied. "Never any dashed
Oriental poetry about you. All the same, there is no figure&mdash;in money
signs, that is."</p>
<p>"Then what the deuce do you want?"</p>
<p>"That I can hardly go into in detail. Let us speak plainly. I've got the
whip hand of you: a few words from me and your interest in the sovereign lord
and ruler business stops. You recognise that, of course. That I require
something is obvious. I want you to stay away from Windsor to-morrow."</p>
<p>Nana Rau smiled at the suggestion.</p>
<p>"Absurd," he said; "you know I dare not do so."</p>
<p>"Under ordinary circumstances, no. But these are not ordinary circumstances.
You are merely going semi-officially. There will be no State fuss; you will
dine at the Castle, and return here next morning. What is intended to take
place yonder you know as well as I do."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go. It's certain to be deuced slow. And if you can only
show me some way out of the difficulty without compromising myself--"</p>
<p>"Of course I have my plans prepared," Vaughan interrupted.</p>
<p>"You don't leave Paddington till a train somewhere about six. Here is my
card with my address. My place is out at Epsom. Come out there and lunch with
me to-morrow, and bring your suite with you, baggage and all, and if we can't
come to terms, my carriage shall take you to Paddington."</p>
<p>"I have only two chaps with me besides my cook," said the Prince.</p>
<p>"Good. So much the better. Then you will come?"</p>
<p>"Well, there is no harm in that," said Nana Rau. "I will."</p>
<p>A few minutes later Wilfred Vaughan, <i>alias</i> Felix Gryde, was placidly
walking along Piccadilly. He turned into the <i>Caf&eacute; Soyer</i>, where
the other parties to the conspiracy were awaiting him and dinner. They were the
tools to be used and to be discarded when the curtain fell.</p>
<p>"It's all right," Gryde proceeded to explain over the <i>bisque</i>. "I told
you Nana Rau was the same man I used to be at Oxford with twenty years ago. I
spotted him at Ascot, and I never forget a face. Nana was terribly frightened,
and, indeed, it was no idle boast that I could bring about his ruin."</p>
<p>"Will he come?" asked tht second conspirator.</p>
<p>"And will the original plan stand?" asked the third.</p>
<p>"Exactly as arranged. You will look after all the details, as I shall be
very busy till luncheon time to-morrow. You will see that the cold luncheon is
properly laid out by the local caterer, and pay for it. Then the keys must be
packed up so as to be posted to the landlord's agent directly we leave the
house. Let the carriage be ordered for 3.30 prompt, and pay the liveryman for
that also. Let it be understood that we have just taken the house for six
months furnished&mdash; which is, indeed, the fact&mdash;and go to a registry
office to inquire about servants. Order a dozen, and say the housekeeper will
call to interview them on a certain day. Each of us, till the time for changing
comes, retains his present disguise."</p>
<p>As a "make-up" artist Gryde had no equal. Several society acquaintances
there passed him without a s:gn of recognition.</p>
<p>"That's all very well," suggested one of the lieutenants; "but suppose any
of the Castle people happen to have seen Nana Rau?"</p>
<p>"Which they haven't done," said Gryde. "I have made the most minute
inquiries on this head. Besides, one Eastern Potentate is as like another as
two peas when he is in his full war paint. It's any money nobody yonder speaks
the language, and if they do I shall make it my pleasure to stick to English.
As you have both presumably been in England before, you can do the same. You
have carefully studied the plans of the apartments I gave to you?"</p>
<p>The others protested that they had.</p>
<p>"Very good," Gryde concluded; "in that case there is no more to be said. We
ought to find enough within easy reach yonder to reward us for all our trouble.
And the servants of the sovereign shall assist us in getting it away. I hope
you won't find it altogether too slow."</p>
<p>Gryde settled the score and they rose to depart. In the street they
separated, and each took a different way. Then they went to bed early and
virtuously as befit men who have before them matters of importance on the
morrow. On the whole they slept better than Nana Rau, Mahrajah of
Curriebad.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>IT WAS with considerable misgivings that Nana Rau drove with two dusky
assistants down to Epsom the following morning.</p>
<p>With him was all his baggage, a formidable-looking amount for a night out;
but then the dazzling splendour of Eastern attire cannot be measured by Western
sartorial restrictions. These big trunks contained the full war paint which
Nana Rau and suite intended to don after luncheon, and ere proceeding to
Windsor.</p>
<p>One thing Nana Rau was fully resolved upon. Nothing should induce him to
play into "Vaughan's" hands unless the latter could provide him with a proper
way out of the difficulty. It was only natural that the Prince should desire to
protect himself, and nothing short of being able to show that he was the
innocent victim of a vile conspiracy would satisfy him.</p>
<p>The Indians reached Vaughan's hospitable mansion at length and were met at
the door by that individual himself.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I shall have to request you to dispense with a deal of
ceremony," he said. "The fact is, this place has been let furnished for about a
year, and my late tenants only turned out of it last week, and thus we are
terribly short of servants. These footmen don't seem able to do anything
without a lot of women to help them."</p>
<p>Vaughan, or Gryde rather, rang the bell violently, and presently a pair of
men-servants appeared breathlessly. They were a fine-looking pair of men, and
their livery left nothing to be desired. The astute reader will have little
difficulty in guessing who these footmen were.</p>
<p>"Whatever have you fellows been doing?" Gryde demanded.</p>
<p>"Please, sir," replied one, in the purest of Cockney accents, "it's all
along of the new cook, which she's drunk--"</p>
<p>Gryde waved these details aside.</p>
<p>"I desire to know nothing of these matters," he replied. "Take the Prince up
to the room prepared for him, and these gentlemen also, and see that they have
everything they require. Luncheon is prepared, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Luncheon is waiting in the dining-room now, sir."</p>
<p>A little later and Nana Rau, together with his host and attendants, sat down
to one of the most perfect luncheons it is possible to imagine. The Prince was
a bit of an epicure in his way, and as the meal proceeded he softened. The
choice champagne rendered him indifferent to the calls of Windsor. And really,
it seemed quite bad taste to stand in the light of so enlightened a <i>bon
vivant</i> as Vaughan.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing had been left undone. The luncheon was a work of art, the
wines were cameos in their way, and the waiting of the two confederates left
nothing to be desired. In the poetic language of the modern Babylon, Nana Rau
was an accomplished "tiddler"; in the old days he would have been a
three-bottle man, and to leave such a feast of alcohol for a mere Court
function partook almost of the nature of a crime.</p>
<p>"Then why leave it?" Gryde asked, when the attendants had withdrawn and he
and the Prince were alone. "Stay and make an evening of it."</p>
<p>"What's the good of talking that dashed nonsense?" said Nana Rau thickly.
"You know as well as possible that I must go."</p>
<p>"But it was arranged that I was to take your place."</p>
<p>"O! I know that's your game. I suppose you've got some diplomatic swindle
on. Only show me a clear way out&mdash;a way which will absolutely absolve me
from all blame&mdash;and you shall take my place with pleasure."</p>
<p>"I am about to do so," said Gryde.</p>
<p>"I think I shall be able to satisfy even your scruples if you will permit me
to leave you for a minute."</p>
<p>Nana Rau waved his hand majestically. He wanted no other company beyond that
superb champagne. He closed his eyes with the ecstasy of it He opened them
again with a start five minutes later. Then, with a beatific smile upon his
face, he slipped from his chair on to the floor and slept.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200481h-images/1200481h-2.jpg" alt=
"HE SLIPPED FROM HIS CHAIR AND SLEPT"></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Let no slur rest upon the fair fame of Nana Rau. For instance, he was a
great deal more sober than Mr. Pickwick when discovered in the village pound.
But even the strongest of heads cannot rise superior to a bottle or so of '74
champagne <i>plus</i> a narcotic of potent properties.</p>
<p>A minute or two later Gryde entered the room, followed by his two
"footmen."</p>
<p>"You fellows did your part uncommonly well," Gryde said. "The Christy
minstrel on the floor is firm enough, and so are the others. They are perfectly
safe here until this time to-morrow. Now then, boys&mdash;no time to be lost.
Let us go upstairs at once and get the Eastern robes on. Very nice to think
that we should be actually provided with our disguises."</p>
<p>The work was by no means easy, though Gryde was an artist so far as this
branch of his profession was concerned. But patience and skill overcomes all
things, and at length the task was accomplished. It would indeed have puzzled
an Englishman to have told the counterfeit from the originals.</p>
<p>"This thing will make a bit of a stir," said Gryde.</p>
<p>"Egad, you are right there," said one of the others, grimly. "Look here, Mr.
Vaughan, I'm not very particular, but I have jibbed a bit over this job. Any
ordinary woman in England, but when it comes to--"</p>
<p>"You seem to regard me as somewhat simple," Gryde interrupted. "Do you
suppose I should be guilty of anything in such fearful taste?"</p>
<p>"But I was under the impression that we were going down on purpose
to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So we are. But my words will come true all the same. At six o'clock this
evening important information, bearing upon the face of it every evidence of
truth, will reach the India Office. A certain great lady will be informed of
the same without delay. And Nana Rau will not kiss the hand of her to whom he
owes fealty."</p>
<p>The scrupulous one said no more, being quite satisfied with this
explanation.</p>
<p>A little later a resplendent carriage drove up to the house, and the three
Indians gravely emerged. Two of them stood aside and bowed low as Gryde passed,
and then, when the two huge trunks were hoisted on the carriage, they
entered.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200481h-images/1200481h-3.jpg" alt=
"TWO OF THEM STOOD ASIDE AND BOWED"></p>
<p>The journey to Paddington was made without incident. Gryde had laid his
plans so carefully, he had made so many inquiries beforehand, that he has
nothing to fear from any display of ignorance on his part.</p>
<p>Everything went well, the retained carriage was entered at length, and the
train started.</p>
<p>"Nothing wanting," said Gryde, with an air of satisfaction; "not a single
hitch&mdash;and, really, this is a most critical part of the performance. They
might have laid a strip of crimson carpet across the platform, but at times
like these one is not disposed to be hypercritical. Windsor will be the next
trouble."</p>
<p>But Windsor proved no bother at all. The red liveried servants were allowed
to take everything in their own hands, and ere long the adventurers found
themselves bowling along the wide avenues up to the Castle.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?" asked Gryde.</p>
<p>"Uncommonly nervous," said the others in chorus.</p>
<p>Gryde smiled. He did not appear to be suffering from the same malady. On the
contrary, he was perfectly at his ease.</p>
<p>"The great charm of this mode of life," he muttered," lies in the fact that
it never lacks variety."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>AS FAR AS their reception was concerned, even the sensitive mind of an
Indian could find nothing at which to take offence. It was, of course, with
profound regret that the pseudo Nana Rau heard that no visitors could be
expected at the royal table the same evening in consequence of a slight
indisposition on the part of a certain great ruler. Nor was it suggested by the
gorgeous official who conducted the interview that the visit of the Prince
should be prolonged in consequence.</p>
<p>"It is greatly to be regretted," Nana murmured.</p>
<p>"I can assure you that the regret is mutual," was the reply. "If the Prince
will honour us by dining with the Household, together with his suite"</p>
<p>"I shall be delighted," the Prince interpolated. "As to my suite, they had
better dine in the apartment apportioned to their use. Afterwards you will
greatly oblige me by letting an attendant conduct them over the state rooms,
and show them some of the treasures of this wonderful place. It is a pleasure
that my faithful followers have looked forward to for a long time."</p>
<p>"Everything shall be done to make them comfortable," the big official
replied. "May I remind the Prince that we dine at eight."</p>
<p>Nana Rau nodded carelessly and intimated his desire to be alone with his
men. The request was immediately granted. For a little time the three
conspirators stood as far from the door as possible talking in whispers.</p>
<p>"You see how beautifully things are falling out," said Gryde. "We are here
without any suspicion being aroused. There is no chance of public sentiment
being awakened by a flagrant insult to the sovereign. All we have to do is to
fill these big trunks in the still watches of the night, and get these good
people to convey them to the station for us in the morning. By way of spotting
all the things worth having, an attendant will take you round presently and
point out the plums to you. But I need not waste my time on advice; you are
both capital judges of articles of value."</p>
<p>"And as to you?"</p>
<p>"As to me, I dine with the Household. Of course, you both occupy my
dressing-room. We leave by a train about seven, as I have an engagement in
Manchester to fill to-morrow night, or, at least, the real Nana has, so we
shall be away before anything is missing."</p>
<p>"And if things are missed just after we start?"</p>
<p>"What matter? We should be the last to be suspected. And you may be certain
the common or garden police would never be consulted in a matter like this.
Absolutely nothing in the way of a public scandal would be permitted. And say
they looked like bringing it home to us. Would they care to stop us, and cart
us off to a police-station? Not a bit of it. Am I not a man of power in our
country? A trustworthy courtier would come to us with every expression of
regret to call for the few trifles that were by mistake taken away with our
luggage. But as we are not going to Jermyn Street, and as we shall emerge on
Paddington platform clothed and in our right minds, they have little chance of
seeing those treasures again."</p>
<p>There was sound logic in every word that Gryde uttered. Unless by any
chance, and that was indeed a remote one, the real Indian was discovered, they
were absolutely safe. But, even if by some strange fortune the Simon Pure was
unearthed, the powerful drug would seal his lips for some hours yet.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, with an easy conscience and a mind at rest that Nana Rau
went down to dine with the Household. He would have felt a little more
comfortable, perhaps, in ordinary evening dress, but nobody seemed to notice
this. At the same time he had the satisfaction of knowing that there was
positively no flaw in his attire, and all the more so because at least two
generals who knew India well were present.</p>
<p>Gryde said very little, and that little awkwardly. His cue was to do the shy
and slightly suspicious guest, which part he acted to perfection.</p>
<p>A little before eleven he deemed it prudent to retire. In that exalted of
all exalted spheres they are not particularly late, and by twelve o'clock sleep
brooded over the Castle.</p>
<p>But not in the two rooms devoted to the Indian guests. They sat waiting and
talking there for the critical moment to arrive, which hour had been fixed by
Gryde for two. Meantime they had to wait.</p>
<p>"You have seen everything?" Gryde murmured.</p>
<p>"Well, not everything," was the reply; "but enough, and more than enough. We
can take away thousands of pounds' worth of stuff without quitting this
floor."</p>
<p>"So much the better," Gryde replied with a smile. "Never run any unnecessary
risks. Not that it would matter very much if one of you were taken." The time
crept slowly on, and at length the hour came. Gryde jumped to his feet. He was
alert and eager enough now. There was no need for lights, as all the passages
gleamed. What they had to fear were the watchmen. But there were three of
them.</p>
<p>"Now follow me," Gryde whispered. There was no time for hesitation. The
corridors appeared to be silent and deserted, but at any time a watchman might
come along. But nothing happened to disturb the work of the adventurers.
Tapestry hangings and Cordova leather here and there not only looked patrician
and valuable, but they formed capital cover for a laden thief whose modesty is
in proportion to the value of his burden.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour Gryde's bedroom presented an appearance of dazzling
splendour. Most of the treasures collected were not only historic but of
immense intrinsic value. On the whole, the haul was perhaps a better one than
the theft of the regal corpse.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200481h-images/1200481h-4.jpg" alt=
"EVEN GRYDE WAS SATISFIED AT LAST"></p>
<p>Even Gryde was satisfied at length.</p>
<p>"No more," he said. "Now remove those bars of lead from the baggage and hide
them behind the curtains. Pack the stuff away quietly and then get to bed. We
shall have to be up a little after six, remember."</p>
<p>Shortly after seven the next morning three shivering Orientals were sped
away from the Castle by a big official, who strove politely to hide his yawns.
When the station was reached and the Orientals were alone they developed new
vigour. One of them even went so far as to see the baggage safely in the van.
Perhaps he mistrusted the absent guard, for he followed it in, the others
standing by th&laquo; door.</p>
<p>His movements were peculiar and rapid. He touched a spring on each box and
the basket frames fell all to pieces. These were immediately hidden under mail
bags. Three huge portmanteaux of different colour were revealed. To each of
these a label bearing a different name was attached; the baggage was quite
transformed.</p>
<p>Then the shivering Orientals went on their way to the carriage reserved for
them. Directly they were inside the blinds were pulled down. The loose Eastern
robes were discarded, and beneath them were disclosed three typical English
garbs&mdash;a parson's, a country squire's, and that of a man about town. With
the free use of the lavatory and a make-up box produced by Gryde, he and the
other artists were utterly changed by the time Slough was reached. Just before
then a big bundle was carefully dropped out of the window. The train pulled up
at Slough. Gryde opened the window opposite the platform.</p>
<p>"Now," he whispered, "you've all got your tickets?"</p>
<p>Confederates One and Two nodded curtly. An instant later the door was closed
again with the curtains still down, and the trio had reached the further
platform without attracting the slightest attention. When they strolled back
again by the proper way to the train they appeared to be strangers to each
other, for each entered a different carriage, not, needless to remark, the one
with the drawn blinds. Then the train sped on towards Paddington.</p>
<p>Once arrived there, Gryde was out of the carriage before the train had
fairly stopped. In this move the other actors were not far behind him. The
great object now was to secure the baggage and get it out of the station
without delay. Out came the stuff tumbling on the platform, and a moment later
the three precious portmanteaux were hoisted upon three cabs and all driven
away at once to separate destinations. The <i>coup</i> had been
accomplished!</p>
<p>But not with much to spare. As Gryde looked with lamb-like gaze over the
tops of his glasses, a parson to the life, he saw coming down the slope into
the station two quiet men, who appeared to see nothing. Gryde smiled.</p>
<p>"They've found it out and telegraphed," he chuckled, "or else two shining
lights like Marsh and Elliott would not have been put on the job. If they have
found Nana Rau, why we have no time to lose. If not, why so much the
better."</p>
<p>It was about nine o'clock the same evening, and the three conspirators,
absolutely without disguise, and <i>qua</i> Gryde and Co., were seated over
dinner in the former's rooms. They had the air of men who had done well and
virtuously</p>
<p>"You managed to get rid of your lot?" Gryde asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," the first man responded. "All beyond recognition by this time. You'll
see to the disposal?"</p>
<p>"I suppose you are all right?" Gryde said to the other.</p>
<p>"I am also satisfied," said he. "We both deposited the plunder as you
directed. Most of my stuff was jewelled, and you can't recognise jewels. We are
as safe as houses. For my part I should like to have a bit of a rest,
considering that I haven't seen my own natural face for a fortnight. When I
look at myself in the glass I feel quite startled."</p>
<p>"Let's go round to a restaurant," suggested Gryde, " and see if anything's
come out."</p>
<p>The proposal found favour in the eyes of the others. In the St. Giles's one
or two men were languidly discussing something in connection with Windsor
Castle and incidentally Indian princes.</p>
<p>"What's that?" Gryde demanded.</p>
<p>"All in the <i>Globe</i>," said an exhausted voice. "Rum case, by Jove!"</p>
<p>Gryde took up the special <i>Globe</i> and turned it over languidly. He had
hardly' expected to find the case public. But all the same it was, and nothing
had been lost in the display of the juicy item:</p>
<blockquote>BURGLARY AT WINDSOR CASTLE<br>
INGENIOUS AND SUCCESSFUL FRAUD<br>
AN INDIAN PRINCE IS DRUGGED AND IMPERSONATED BY THIEVES<br>
<br>
From information just received it is evident that last night a clever and
successful attempt at burglary was carried out at Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>
It appears that H.R.H. the Mahrajah of Curriebad was summoned to Windsor for
some purpose of State, and this seems to have been known to the miscreants. The
Prince was lured away to Epsom by an individual claiming to be an old friend of
his, the pretext being an invitation to luncheon. There he and his attendants
were drugged and locked in a deserted house whilst the pseudo Indians repaired
to Windsor.<br>
<br>
What happened there we are not in a position to say, but early this morning the
Prince and his attendants escaped from their prison-house, and lost no time in
laying the case before the proper authorities. The police are extremely
reticent upon the point, but we have the best authority for saying that during
the night the daring thieves carried away from Windsor articles to the value of
thousands of pounds. How they managed to get clear away is a mystery, for
though the sham Indians were seen to enter their reserved carriage at Windsor,
it is certain they did not detrain en route. Up to the present nothing has been
heard or seen of them.<br>
<br>
At the last moment we are informed that a large bundle of Oriental robes have
been picked up on the line near Slough. How they got there must for the present
remain a mere matter for conjecture.</blockquote>
<p>Gryde smiled as he laid the paper aside.</p>
<p>"Looks to me like a hoax," he said,</p>
<p>"Depend upon it, our friend the Mahrajah got screwed and imagined the whole
thing. Burglary at Windsor Castle! The whole thing is too absurd."</p>
<p>With which Gryde went off to play pool, at which game, as usual, he proved
singularly successful. But he declined to stay late.</p>
<p>"No," he said; "I was up nearly all night. Some other time, perhaps. But you
chaps may depend upon it those 'Indians' will never be caught. See you fellows
in a day or two. I'm going out of town to-morrow for a time."</p>
<p>But Gryde's tools never saw him again. They had pooled their plunder, and
Gryde was to dispose of it. Yet days and weeks went by, and like the raven,</p>
<blockquote>"Still is sitting, never flitting,"<br>
they tarried for the master who came not.</blockquote>
<p>"Some day," growled No. 1, "we shall meet Vaughan again; then let him look
to himself. I should know him anywhere."</p>
<p>Vain boast, fond delusion. Tools it was necessary for Gryde to have, but as
to using them and making familiar as Gryde with them&mdash;never! A myth was
"Vaughan," and as a myth he is likely to remain.</p>
