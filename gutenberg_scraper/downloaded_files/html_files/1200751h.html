<h2>No. 6: A Pair of Handcuffs.</h2>

<h4>The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times, 4 September, 1909.</h4>
<hr>
<p>It was quite a new departure for so high-class a crowd as the
Sutton-Vascombe Opera Company, but from the financial point of view it had been
a great success. The company were on sharing terms, though the general public
was not supposed to know that. The expenses had been heavy, and something had
to be done. More than half the chorus were dismissed, two-thirds of the
orchestra found engagements in Melbourne or Sydney, and then 'the grand tour'
of the 'back blocks' began. It was somewhat rough-and-ready, but the miners and
sheep-shearers did not mind that. They got the best of singing and acting for
their money, which they put down freely. There were mining villages where the
exchange was pure dust&mdash;an ounce for a stall, and in proportion for the
gallery, so that the exchequer was actually getting heavy with gold that had
yet to see the mint. The treasurer was naturally a little anxious&mdash;it was
a wild district, and 'robbery under arms' was not yet altogether a thing of the
past. Jim Baynham came that way sometimes, and when he did somebody had to
suffer. Jim was the last word in the way of bushrangers&mdash;an Englishman who
had left his country for his country's good; there were warrants out for his
apprehension in England. For the last five years he had been ever the delight
and terror of the territory between the Poonah and the Yarra. He was by way of
being a gentleman, too, and he could do the thing very well when he chose. On
the other hand, he could behave with the most cold and malignant cruelty.</p>
<p>Consequently the secretary of the Sutton-Vascombe Company was uneasy in his
mind. He was responsible for some twelve hundred ounces of gold-dust, and there
was no chance of conveying it to a place of safety. He confided his fears to
all and sundry. They treated him lightly&mdash;they had no fear of Jim Baynham.
The women were nervous, of course&mdash;Marjorie Hickson, for instance. She was
a sweet little girl with a sweet voice, and she was going far in her
profession. Meanwhile, she had a brother just recovering from a serious
illness, and lying in a Melbourne hospital, who was entirely dependent upon her
for the time being. And in turn he had a wife in England. If anything happened
to Marjorie's share of the treasury, she trembled for the consequences.</p>
<p>"None of 'em care," the treasurer groaned. "Seem to think that actors are
exempt from troubles of that kind. They say that Jim Baynham was in the house
at Banawaddy. Just as if that was going to make any difference. And that chap
Claxton agrees with me. He knows the ropes. Been out here for years, he tells
me."</p>
<p>Claxton had joined the company at Paira River. He was understood to be the
surviving actor of a variety company which had been utterly stranded a year
ago. Claxton had been down with fever, and when he was on his feet again, it
was only to stand in his last pair of boots with the last shilling in his
pocket. He had drifted up against the Sutton-Vascombe combination just at the
time when they were short of an assistant baggage-man. The mere fact that
Claxton was undoubtedly a gentleman weighed very little with the company. The
knowledge that the stranger had been in vaudeville was enough. They never even
asked him what his line was. Most of them had been recruited from the
Universities, a good many of the women bore good names. They really were a
'tony' crowd. They admitted that the baggage-man was a gentleman; therefore
they tolerated him. But, artistically, they made him aware of the awful gulf
between them.</p>
<p>With the sweet unreasonableness of her sex, Marjorie took to Claxton from
the first. She was sorry for him&mdash;she felt sure that he had been the
victim of misfortune. She admired his square, handsome face, and that well-knit
figure of his. His eye was clear, his check was brown&mdash;he could not have
passed anything but a clean, wholesome existence. He had been all over the
world, too, and had many an interesting story to tell. At least, Marjorie
thought them interesting. And whenever her mind wandered uneasily in the
direction of bushrangers, she was curiously confronted by the knowledge that
Claxton was travelling with the company.</p>

<p><b>He was a little man, with a clean-cut, alive face, with a great beak of a
nose all on one side: a mass of thick black hair was brushed back from the
forehead and fell over the nape of his neck. A thin, clean-shaven mouth was
parted in a smile that disclosed a really splendid set of teeth. He was dressed
in a neat, double-breasted, blue serge suit; his brown shoes shone with a
glittering polish. In his right hand he had a revolver.</b></p>
<p>They had played for two nights near Sendigo when the drama began in earnest.
People had come from far and near to see the show&mdash;they were prepared to
travel home under the coolness of the stars, and the village was deserted. The
so-called 'hotel' was filled with the company, to the exclusion of everybody
else; supper was a thing of the past, and the management had retired. Most of
the combination were still in the big pitch-pine dining-room, talking over the
events of the evening, when the door was suddenly pushed open and a stranger
entered. He was a little man, with a clean-cut, alive face, with a great beak
of a nose all on one side; a mass of thick black hair was brushed back from the
forehead and fell over the nape of his neck. A thin, clean-shaven mouth was
parted in a smile that disclosed a really splendid set of teeth. He was dressed
in a neat, double-breasted, blue serge suit; his blown shoes shone with a
glittering polish. In his right hand he held a revolver.</p>
<p>"Mr. James Baynham, greatly at your service," he said gently. "It is as
well, perhaps, to remark that the first suggestion of resistance on the part of
any of you gentleman will result in a vacancy in the company. I should deeply
deplore this, as I am a musician myself. To shoot a tenor or precipitate a
baritone into an untimely grave would be a source of lasting sorrow to me."</p>
<p>Nobody moved for a moment. They were taken utterly by surprise, there was
not a revolver amongst the whole crowd; indeed it is doubtful whether a single
member of the company had the slightest idea how to handle one. Marjorie
Hickson crept a little closer to Claxton.</p>
<p>"Is that really the man, or is it somebody playing a trick on us?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the man right enough," Claxton replied. "We are old
acquaintances. As a matter of fact, I was at school with him in England."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed! And is he really quite as bad as people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Worse," Claxton said curtly. "He's a born rascal. As a matter of fact, he
couldn't be anything else. Some chaps are like that, you know. We shall have to
make the best of it."</p>
<p>Baynham was speaking again. He was understood to say that he was not alone.
He had come with two other intimate friends of his for a little music. The
friends were engaged at that moment taking precautions against a surprise on
the part of the hotel management. He regretted that he would be compelled to
take similar measures so far as the male members of the company were concerned.
There were too many of them for safety; they boasted too many athletes.</p>
<p>"We raided the police-station at Garralong as we came here," Baynham said
smilingly. "It was necessary to my scheme that we should have some handcuffs.
We found some score of pairs, and they are at present in the bar. Very sorry,
of course, but the thing must be done. You gentlemen will kindly line up
against the wall, facing it. Ladies, we are your devoted slaves. No harm shall
come to any of you. Now, you chaps!"</p>
<p>The last word rang out like a threat. Claxton shut his teeth together
grimly.</p>
<p>"It might be a great deal worse," he whispered to Marjorie. "You will see
where I come in presently. Don't worry about your share of the exchequer, and
don't be afraid. No harm will come to any of you girls. You will have to sing
and play until they have had enough of it. We shall look on with our hands
fastened behind our backs. It's a grim joke, but you will see presently that
there are two sides to it."</p>
<p>Marjorie smiled bravely. She heard Baynham utter a curse as Caxton lagged
behind. He strode up to Claxton and caught him by the shoulder. Then he started
back.</p>
<p>"Good evening, James," Claxton said mockingly. "Quite an unexpected
pleasure, isn't it? Never expected to see me again. Nice sort of life you are
leading, isn't it? Wonder how a family like yours managed to turn out such a
waster! It would have been far better if we had let you down that day in the
Monk's Pool below Chesham Bridge."</p>
<p>Baynham's lips parted in a snarl.</p>
<p>"So it's Claxton," he said, "Claxton of the Sixth. Head of the school. The
shining example to the rest of us! Kicking about Australia juggling, or
something of that kind. Very glad to meet you again, Phil Claxton. I shall know
how to deal with you presently. Be so good as to point out the treasurer of
this powerful operatic cast to me. He is suffering from over-anxiety, and I
want to relieve him of some of it. Oh, yes; the little man in the spectacles.
Still, pleasure before business is always my motto. Where is the music? I
expect the piano is a sufficiently ancient instrument, but we must make the
best of that. Now, ladies, please."</p>
<p>Two other men came trooping into the room at the same time. There was
nothing in their appearance to give cause for alarm. They were neatly and
quietly dressed like their chief, and were openly amused at the sight of the
helpless row of men facing the wall.</p>
<p>"Have you got the bracelets there?" Baynham asked.</p>
<p>The glittering pile of handcuffs were produced and handed to the leader of
the raid. One by one he fitted them on the wrists of the male members of the
company. The quick snapping of the locks was the only sound that could be
heard.</p>
<p>"So far so good," Bayham said cheerfully; "I am sorry that you will not be
able to smoke, gentlemen, but you can stand there with your hands behind you
and listen to the concert. When it is over I shall be able to relieve the
anxious mind of your treasurer, and after that I will place the key of the
handcuffs on the old green tree where the roads cross about a mile away."</p>
<p>The concert began promptly. The performers were palpably nervous, but that
wore off after a time. At any rate there was no violence to be feared. They
might lose all their money, but there was ample time to make some more. And,
after all, the situation was not devoid of comedy. The light-heartedness of the
artistic nature was asserting itself. Marjorie Hickson had sung a song that had
been received by the select audience with singular favour. Claxton stood with a
group of men about him whispering something in their ears. They seemed to be
interested in what he was saying. Claxton had a chance to say a few words to
Marjorie presently.</p>
<p>"I am very thirsty," she exclaimed. "It is such a hot night. Please get me
some lemonade."</p>
<p>Baynham turned to his colleagues. They hurried off in the direction of the
bar. Claxton strolled across the room towards Baynham. There was an ugly gleam
in his eye. Baynham saw it and rose to his feet instinctively. Instantaneously
his hand went to his hip-pocket. Then he smiled as if half-ashamed of himself.
Claxton's hands were securely fastened behind him. Nothing but a miracle.. ..
the miracle happened. Claxton's right fist appeared with the left end of the
handcuff dangling from it. The heavy metal described a gleaming circle in the
air, then it came down with a sickening blow on the parting of Baynham's thick
black hair. Something spurted hot and red as Baynham pitched headlong to the
floor and laid there lost to all creation. The thing was so startling, so
dramatic, so utterly unexpected, that no cry came from the ring of white-faced
women looking on. Claxton flung himself on the prostate body and hastily
searched Baynham's pocket. He held up something not unlike the key of an
ordinary beer-barrel.</p>
<p>"Gather round," he said hoarsely. "Stand in a group as naturally as you can.
I can release two or three of you if you will be quick. Make a stage scene of
it&mdash;nobody should be able to do it better."</p>
<p>Baynham's subordinates came bustling into the room carrying glasses and
bottles. As they advanced somebody stumbled against one of them, and a glass
smashed on the floor. There was a scramble to pick it up, and an instant later
the two outlaws lay at the bottom of a veritable football scrimmage. The thing
was done almost without a word being spoken.</p>
<p>"I think that will about do," Claxton said, after the discomfited ruffians
had been searched. "Take this key, somebody, and release the rest of the crowd.
I don't know who you two rascals are, but I expect the police do, and that
comes to the same thing. I've laid open the head of your chief, and he is not
likely to do any more mischief for some time to come. Now let's release the
landlord and the hotel staff and get them to ride for the police."</p>
<p>Claxton's popularity was assured now. The story spread like wildfire all
through the colony. Baynham was safe in jail with his followers; he was never
likely to do any more mischief. The whole thing was a piece of coolness and
courage calculated to appeal to the Colonial mind. But nobody quite knew how
Claxton had managed to get rid of his shackles. He did not in the least seem
disposed to talk about it either. It was Marjorie Hickson in whom he finally
confided.</p>
<p>"It was quite easy," he said. "I'll tell you, because you are the only one
who has been really nice to me. Besides, I'm giving up the game and going home.
My uncle is dead, and I have come into his property. As a matter of fact, the
whole business was a piece of wonderful good luck. These chaps here wanted to
know what my line was, and I refused to say. I was a Handcuff King. I learnt
the dodge from a professor in England. I have a wonderful pair of wrists, and I
can get out of anything. When these handcuffs were produced by Baynham, I saw
my way at once. He might just as well have tied me up with a piece of cobweb. I
waited till he felt quite comfortable, and then I took him unawares, as you
saw. You'll keep my secret, Miss Marjorie."</p>
<p>Marjorie thanked him with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You have saved everything," she said. "I don't know what I should have done
without my money. I was going to offer to share it with you, but since you have
so much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then let me share with you," Claxton said eagerly. "I shall never enjoy it
alone. And the worst of the thing is, there is such a lot of it, my dear. I
hope you are not offended."</p>
<p>But Marjorie was not in the least offended. She was not even annoyed when
Claxton kissed her. And she has seen no reason to repent her decision
since.</p>
