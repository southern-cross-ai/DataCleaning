<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>THAT VETERAN</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>All The Year Round</i>, Sep 2, 1882<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>"Served, sir? Yes, sir," said my tattered <i>vis-a-vis</i>, drawing himself
up and touching his apology for a hat. "Crimea and Mutiny, sir."</p>
<p>"What arm?" I asked, lazily.</p>
<p>"Royal Horse Artillery. Thank you sir, I take it hot with sugar."</p>
<p>It was pleasant to meet anyone who could talk English among those barren
Welsh mountains, and pleasanter still to find one who had anything to talk
about. I had been toiling along for the last ten miles, vowing in my heart
never to take a solitary walking tour again, and, above all, never under any
circumstances to cross the borders of the Principality. My opinions of the
original Celt, his manners, customs, and above all his language, were very much
too forcible to be expressed in decent society. The ruling passion of my life
seemed to have become a deep and all-absorbing hatred towards Jones, Davis,
Morris, and every other branch of the great Cymric trunk. Now, however, sitting
at my eaze in the little inn at Langerod, with a tumbler of smoking punch at my
elbow, and my pipe between my teeth, I was inclined to take a more rosy view of
men and things. Perhaps it was thsa spirit of reconciliation which induced me
to address the weather-beaten scarecrow in front of me, or perhaps it was that
his resolute face and lean muscular figure attracted my curiosity.</p>
<p>"You don't seem much the better for it," I remarked.</p>
<p>"It's this, sir, it's this," he answered, touching his glass with the spoon.
"I'd have had my seven shillings a day, as retired sergeant-major, if it wasn't
for this. One after another I've forfeited them&mdash;my badges and my good
service allowance and my pension, until they had nothing more to take rom me,
and turned me adrift into tho world at forty-nine. I was wounded once in the
trenches and once at Delhi, and this is what I got for it, just because I
oouldn't keep away from drink. You don't happen to have a fill of 'baccy about
you? Thank you, sir; you are the first gentleman I have met this many a
day.</p>
<p>"Sebastopol? Why, Lord bless you, I knows it as well as I know thia here
village. You've read about it, may be, but I could make it clear to you in a
brace of shakes. This here fender is the French attack, you see, and this poker
is the Bussian lines. Here's the Mamelon opposite the Frenoh, and the Redan
opposite the English. This spittoon stands for the harbour of Balaclava.
There's the quarries midway between the Russians and us, and here's Cathcart's
hill, and this is the twenty-four gun battery. That's the one I served in
towards the end of the war. You see it all now, don't you, sir?"</p>
<p>"More or less," I answered doubtfully.</p>
<p>"The enemy held those quarries at the commencement, and very strong they
made them with trenches and rifle-pits all round. It was a terrible thorn in
our side, for you couldn't show your nose in our advanced works, but a bullet
from the quarries would be through it. So at last the General, he would stand
it no longer, so we dug a covering trenoh until we were within a hundred yards
of them, and then waited for a dark night. We got our chance at last, and five
hundred men were got together quietly under cover. When the word was given they
made for the quarries as hard as they could run, jumped down, and began
bayonetting every man they met. There was never a shot fired on our side, sir,
but it was all done as quiet as may be. The Russians stood like men&mdash;they
never failed to do that&mdash;and there was a rare bit of give-an'-take
fightiug before we cleared them out. Up to the end they never turned, and our
fellows had to pitchfork them out of the place like so many trusses of hay.
That was the Thirtieth that was engaged that night. There was a young
lieutenant in that corps, I disremember his name, but he was a terrible one for
a fight. He wasn't more'n nineteen, but was as tall as you, sir, and a deal
stouter. They say that he never drew his sword during the whole war, but he
used an ash stick, supple and strong, with a knob the size of a oocoa-nut at
the end of it. It was a nasty weapon in hands like his. If a man came at him
with a firelock, he could down him before the bayonet was near him, for he was
long in the arm and active as well. I've heard from men in his company that he
laid about him like a demon in the quarries that night, and crippled twenty, if
he hit one."</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the veteran was beginning to warm to his subject,
partly, perhaps, from the effects of the brandy-and-water, and partly from
having found a sympathetic listener. One or two leading questions were all that
he would require. I refilled my pipe, settled myself down in my chair, put my
weary feet upon the fender, and prepared to listen.</p>
<p>"They were splendid soldiers, the Russians, and no man that ever fought
against them would deny it. It was queer what a fancy they had for the English,
and we for them. Our fellows that were taken by them were uncommon well used,
and when there was an armistice we could get on well together. All they wanted
was dash. Where they were put they would stick, and they could shoot right
well, but they didn't seem to have it in them to make a rush, and that was
where we had them. They could drive the French before them, though, when we
were not by. I've seen them come out for a sortie, and kill them like flies.
They were terribly bad soldiers&mdash; the worst I ever saw&mdash;all except
the Zouaves, who were a different race to the rest. They were all great
thieves, and rogues, too, and you were never safe if you were near them."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say they would harm their own allies?" said I.</p>
<p>"They would that, sir, if there was anything to be got by it. Look at what
happened to poor Bill Cameron, of our battery. He got a letter that his wife
was ailing, and as he wasn't vory strong himself, they gave him leave to go
back to England. He drew his twenty-eight pound pay, and was to sail in a
transport next day; but, as luck would have it, he goes over to the Frenoh
oanteen that night, just to have a last wet, and he lets out there that he had
the money about him. We found him next morning lying as dead as mutton between
the lines, and so kicked and bruised that you oould hardly tell he was a human
being. There was many an Englishman murdered that winter, sir, and many a
Frenchman who had a good British pea-jacket to keop out the cold.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you a atory about that, if I am not wearying you. Thank you, sir;
I thought I'd just make sure. Well, four of our fellows&mdash;Sam Kelcey and
myself,' and Jack Burns and Prout&mdash;were over in the Frenoh lines on a bit
of a spree. When we were coming back, this chap Prout suddenly gets an idea. He
was an Irishman, and uncommon clever.</p>
<p>"'See here, boys,' says he; 'if you can raise sixpence among you, I'll put
you in the way of making some money to-night, and a bit of fun into the
bargain.'</p>
<p>" Well, we all agreed to this, and turned out our pockets, but we only had
about fourpence altogether.</p>
<p>"'Nivor mind,' says Prout, 'come on with me to the Frenoh canteen. All
you've to do is to seem very drunk, and to keep saying " Yes" to all I
ask.'"</p>
<p>"All this time, sir, we hadn't a ghost of an idea of what he was driving at,
but we went stumbling and rolling into the canteen, among a crowd of loafing
Frenchmen, and spent our coppers in a drain of liquor.</p>
<p>"'Now,' says Prout, loud out, so as everyone could hear, 'are you ready to
come back to camp?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' says we.</p>
<p>"'Have you got your thirty pounds safe in your pooket, Sam?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' says Sam.</p>
<p>"'And you, Bill,' he says to me, 'have you got your three months' pay all
right?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I answers.</p>
<p>"'Well, come on then, and don't tumble down more'n you can help,' and with
that we staggers out of the canteen and away off into the darknoss.</p>
<p>"By this time we had a pretty good suspicion of what he was after, but when
we were well out of sight of evorybody he halted and explained to us.</p>
<p>"'They're bound to follow us after what we've said, and it's queer if the
four of us can't manage to best them. They keep their money in little bags
round their necks, and all you've got to do is to cut the string.'</p>
<p>"Wel, we stumbled on, still pretending to be very drunk, so as to have the
advantage of a surprise, but never a soul did we see. At last we was within a
stone's-tkrow of our lines when we heard a whispering of 'Anglais! Anglais!'
which is their jargon for 'English,' sir; and there, sure enough, was about a
dozen men coming down against us in the moonlight. We stumbled along,
pretending to be too drunk even to see them. Pretty soon they stopped, and one
of them, a big stout man, sidles up to Sam Kelcey and says, 'What time you call
it?' while the rest of them began to draw round us. Sam says nothing, but gives
a terrible lurch, on which the Frenohie, thinking it all right, sprang at his
throat.</p>
<p>"That was our signal for action, and in we went. Sam Kelcey was the
strongest man in the battery and a terrible bruiser, and he caught this leader
of theirs a clip under the jaw that sent him twice head over heels before he
brought up against the wall, with the blood pouring from his mouth. The others
made a run at un, but all they oould do was to kick and scream, while we kept
knocking them down as quick as they could get to their feet. We had all their
little bags, sir, and we left the lot of them stripped and senseless on the
road. Five-and-thirty golden pieces in English money and French we counted out
upon a knapsack when we got back to our quarters, besides boots and flannel
shirts and other things that were handy. There was never another drunken man
followed after that night's work, for you see they never could be sure that it
wasn't a sham."</p>
<p>The veteran paused for a moment to have a pull at his glass and listen to my
murmur of appreciation. I was afraid that I had exhausted his story-telling
capacities; but he rippled on again between the puffs of his pipe.</p>
<p>"Sam Kelcey&mdash;him that I spoke about&mdash;was a fine man, but his
brother Joe was a finer, though a bit of a scamp in his day, like many a fine
man is. When I was stationed at Gibraltar after the war Joe Kelcey was working
at the fortifications as a convict, having been sent out of England for some
little game or other. He was known to be a bold and resolute man, and the
overseers kept a sharp look-out on him for fear he'd try to break away. One day
he was working on the banks of the river and he seed an empty hamper come
floating down&mdash;one that had come with wine, as like as not, for the
officers' mess. He gets hold of the hamper, and be knocks the bottom out, and
stows it away among the rushes. Next morning we were having breakfast when in
rushes one of the guard and cries, 'Come on, boys; the five-of spades is
up!'&mdash;the five-of-spades being a name they gave to the spotted signal they
ran up when a convict had escaped. Out we all tumbled, and begin searching like
hounds for a hare, because there was always a reward of two pounds for the
finder. There wasn't a drain or a hollow but was overhauled, and never a sign
of Joe, till at last we gave him up in despair, and agreed that he must be at
the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>"That afternoon I was on guard on the ramparts, and my eye chanced to light
on an old hamper drifting about half a mile or so from the shore. I thought
nothing of it at the time, but in a quarter of an hour I happened to oatch
sight of the same object again. I stared at it in astonishment.</p>
<p>"'Why,' I said to the sentry on the wall, 'that hamper's going further away
towards the Spanish shore. Blest if it isn't moving against wind and tide and
every law of Nature.'</p>
<p>"'Nonsense!' says he; 'there's alway a queer eddy in the straits.'</p>
<p>"Well, this didn't satisfy me at all, so I goes up to Captain Morgan, of our
battery, who was smoking his cigar, and I saluted and told him about the
hamper. Off he goes, and is back in a minute with a spy-glass, and takes a peep
through it.</p>
<p>"'Bless my soul'! he cries, 'why the hamper's got arms sticking out of it!
Ah, to be sure, it's that rascal who esoaped this morning. Just run up the
signal to the man-of-war.'</p>
<p>"We hoisted it, and in a few minutes two boats were in pursuit of the
convict. Now if we had left well enough alone, Joe would have been caught sure
enough, for he never knew he was found out, and was taking things leisurely,
being an uncommon fine swimmer. But Captain Morgan says:</p>
<p>"'Just wheel round this thirty-two pounder, and wo'll drop a shot beside him
to show him that we see him, and bring him to a halt.'</p>
<p>"We slewed the gun round, sir, and the captain looked along the sights and
touched her off. A more wonderful shot you never saw, and the whole crowd that
was on the ramparts gave a regular shout. It hit the top of the hamper and sent
the whole thing flying in the air, so that we made sure that the man was
killed. When the foam from the splash had cleared away, he was still there
though, and striking out might and main for the Spanish coast. It was a close
race between him and the boats, and the coxswain actually grabbed at him with a
boat-hook as he clambered up on land, but there he was, and we could see him
dancing about and chaffiog the men-o'-war's men. There was a cheer, sir, when
we saw him safe, for a plucky ohap like that deserves to be free, whatever he's
been and done. You look tired. You've had a long walk maybe. Perhaps you'd best
have some rest."</p>
<p>This remark, disinterested as it sounds, was given point to by the plaintive
manner in which my companion gazed at the two empty glasses, as if it were
evident that the proceedings of the evening had come to a close.</p>
<p>"It's not often," he murmured, "that a poor old soldier like me finds a
gentleman as sociable-like and free as your honour."</p>
<p>I need hardly say that after that I had no alternative but to ring the bell
and order up a second edition of the brandy-and-water.</p>
<p>"You were talking about the Russians," he continued, "and I told you they
were fine soldiers. Some of their riflemen were as good shots as ever pulled a
trigger. Excuse me, that glass is yours, sir, and the other is mine. Our
sharpshooters used to arrange four sandbags, one on each side, one in front,
and one crossways on the top, so as to cover them all round. Then, you see,
they shot through the little slit between the bag in front and the one on the
top; maybe not more than two inches across. You'll hardly believe me, but I've
seen at the distance of five hundred yards the bullets humming through the
narrow slits as thick as bees. I've known as many as six men knocked over in
half an hour in one of these sand-traps, as we used to call them; every one of
them hit in the eye too, for that was the only part that showed.</p>
<p>"There is a story that reminds me of which might interest you. There was one
Russian fellow that had a sand-pit all of his own, right in front of our
trenches. I never saw anybody so persevering as that man was. Early in the
morning he'd be popping away, and there he'd stay until nightfall, taking his
food with him into the pit. He seemed to take a real pleasure in it, and as he
was a very fine shot, and never let us get muoh of a ohance at him, he was not
a popular character in the advanced trenches. Many a good fellow he sent to
glory. It got such a nuisance that we dropped shells at him now and again, but
he minded them no more than if they had been so many oranges.</p>
<p>"One day I was down in the trenches when Colonel Mancor, of the
Forty-eighth, a splendid shot and a great man for sport, came along. A party
with a sergeant were at work, and just as the colonel came up, one of them
dropped with a ball through his head.</p>
<p>"'Deuced good shot! Who fired that!' says the colonel, putting up his
eye-glass.</p>
<p>"'Man in the rifle-pit to the left, sir,' answers the sergeant.</p>
<p>"'Never saw a neater shot,' says the colonel. 'He only showed for a moment,
and wouldn't have shown then, only that the edge of the trench is a bit worn
away. Does he often shoot like that?'</p>
<p>"'Terribly dangerous man,' replies the sergeant; 'kills more than all the
guns in the Redan.'</p>
<p>"'Now, major,' says the colonel, turning to another officer as was with him,
'what's the odds against my picking him off?'</p>
<p>"'In how long?'</p>
<p>"'Within ten minutes.'</p>
<p>"'Two to one, in ponies, I'll give you,' says the major.</p>
<p>"'Say three, and it's a bargain.'</p>
<p>"'Three to one in ponies,' answered the major, and the bet was made.</p>
<p>"He was a great man for measuring his powder, was the colonel, and alwaya
emptied out a cartridge and then filled it up again according to his taste. He
took about half his time getting the sergeant's gun loaded to please him. At
last he got it right, and the glass screwed well into his eye.</p>
<p>"'Now, my lads,' says he, 'just push poor Smith here up over the trench.
He's dead enough, and another wound will make little difference to him.'</p>
<p>"The men began to hoist the body up, and the colonel stood, maybe 20 yards
off, peering over the edge with eyes like a lynx. As soon as the top of Smith's
shako appeared, we saw the barrel of the gun come slowly out of the sand-pit,
and when his poor dead face looks over the edge, whizz comes a bullet right
through his forehead. The Russian he peeps out of the pit to see the effect of
his shot, and he never looks at anything again until he sees the everlasting
river. The colonel fired with a sort of a chuckle, and the rifleman sprang up
in the air, and ran a matter of ten or twelve paces towards us, and then down
on his faoe as dead ns a doornail. 'Double or quits on the msn in the pit to
the right,' says the colonel, loading up his gun again, but I think the major
had dropped money enough for one day over his shooting, for he wouldn't hear of
another try. By the way, it was handed over to Smith's widow, for he was a
free-handed gentleman, was the colonel, not unlike yourself, sir.</p>
<p>"That running of dead men is a queer thing. Perhaps your eddication may help
you to understand it, but it beats me. I've seen it, though, many a time. I
remember the doctor of our regiment saying it was commonor among men hit
through the heart. What do you think about it, sir?"</p>
<p>"Your doctor was quite right," I answered. "In several murder cases people
who have been stabbed or shot through the heart have gone surprising distances
afterwards. I never heard of such a case occurring in a battle, but I don't see
why it shouldn't."</p>
<p>"It happened once," resumed my companion, "when Codrington's division were
going up the Alma, and were close on the great redoubt. To their surprise, a
single Russian came running down tha hill against them, with his firelock in
his hand. One or two fired at him, and seemed to miss him, for on he came till
he got right up to the line, when a sergeant, as had seen a deal of service,
gives a laugh, and throws his gun down in front of him. Down goes the Russian,
and lies there stone dead. Had been shot through tha heart at the top of the
hill, and was dead before ever he began that charge. At least, that's what the
sergeant said, and we all believied him.</p>
<p>"There was another queer incident of the same sort which happened later on
in the war. Perhaps you may have heard of it, for it got into print at the
time. One night a body, fearfully mangled and crushed, came crashing in among
the tents of the light division. Nobody could make head or tail of it, until
some deserters let it out long afterwards. It seems that they had one
old-fashioned sort of gun with a big bore in a Russian battery. Now the night
was cold, and the poor devil of a sentry thought he'd stow himself away where
he'd never be seen, so he creeps inside the big gun, and goes to sleep there.
In the middle of the night there was a sudden alarm of an attaok, and an
artilleryman runs up to the gun and touches it off, and the sentry was flying
through the air at twenty miles a minute. It didn't much matter," added the
veteran philosophically, "for he was bound to be shot any way, for sleeping at
his post, so it saved a deal of useless delay."</p>
<p>"To a man who has seen so much of the world," I remarked, "this humdrum life
in a Welsh village must be very slow."</p>
<p>"It is that, sir. It is that, sir. You've hit it there. Lord bless you, sir,
if I had a gentleman like yourself to talk to every night I'd be a different
man. I'll tell you one reason now for my coming to this place," here he leaned
forward impressively. "I've got a wife in London, sir, but I came here to break
myself of the drink. And I'm doing it slow, but sure. Why, three weeks ago, I
oould never sleep unless I had my five glasses under my belt, and now I can
manage it on three."</p>
<p>"Waiter, another glass of brandy-and-water," said I.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir; thank you. As you said just now, I have had a stirring
life, and this quiet business is too muoh for me. Did I ever tell you how I got
my stripes? Why it was by hanging three men&mdash;three men with these very
hands."</p>
<p>"How was that?" I asked sleepily.</p>
<p>"It was like this, sir. We were in Corfu, three batteries of us, in '50.
Well, one of our officers&mdash;a lieutenant he was&mdash;went off into the
mountains to shoot one day, and he never came back. His dog trotted into the
messroom, however, and began to howl for all the world like a human being. A
party was made up, and followed the dog, who led them right up among the hills
to a place where there was a ditch. There, with a lot of ferns and suchlike
heaped over him, the poor young fellow was lying with his throat cut from ear
to ear. He was a great favourite in the regiment, and more particularly with
the officer in command, and he swore that he'd have revenge. There was a deal
of discontent among the Greeks on the island at tha time, and this had been
encouraged by the priests&mdash;'pappas' they call them. Well, when we got back
to town the captain calls all these pappas before him, and there were three of
them who could give no sort of account of themselves, but turned pale and
stammered, and were terribly put out. A court martial was held, and the three
of them were condemned to be hanged. Now came the difficulty, however, for it
was well known that if anyone laid hands on a priest his life wasn't worth an
hour's purchase. They are very strict about that are the Greeks, and uncommon
handy with their knives. The captain called for a volunteer, and out I stepped,
for I thought it was my duty, sir, seeing that I had been the dead man's
servant. Well, the troops formed square round the scaffold, and I hung them as
high as Hamas. When the job was over, the captain says, 'Now, my lad, I'll save
your life,' and with that he forms the troops up into close order, puts me in
the middle, and marches me down to the quay. There was a steamer there just
casting off her warps for England, and I was shoved aboard, the crowd surging
all round, and trying to get at me. You never heard such a howl as when they
saw the ship steam out of the bay, and knew that I was gone. I have been a
lonely man all my life, sir, and I may say that was the only time I have been
honestly regretted when I left. We searched the ship when we got out to sea,
and blessed if there weren't three Greek stowaways aboard, each with his knife
in his belt. We hove them over the side, and since I have never heard from them
since I fear they may possibly have been drowned"; and the artilleryman grinned
in high delight. "They made me a corporal for that job, sir."</p>
<p>"By the way, what is your name?" I asked, getting more and more drowsy,
partly from the heat of the fire, and partly from a curious feeling which was
stealing over me and the like of which I had never experienced before.</p>
<p>"Sergeant Turnbull, air; Turnbull of B battery, Royal Horse Artillery. Major
Campbell, who was over us in the Crimea, or Captain Onslow, or any of the old
corps, would be glad to hear that you have seen me. You'll not forget the name,
will you, sir?"</p>
<p>I was too sleepy to answer.</p>
<p>"I could tell you a yarn about a Zouave that would amuse you. He was mortal
drunk, and mistook the Russian lines for ours. They was having their supper in
the Mamelon when he passes the sentry as cool as may
be&mdash;prisoner&mdash;jumps&mdash;colonel &mdash;free&mdash;"</p>
<p>When I came to myself I found that I was lying in front of the smouldering
fire, and that the candle was burning low. I was alone in the room. I staggered
to my feet with a laugh, but my brain seemed to spin round, and I came down
into my former position. Something was evidently amiss. I put my hand into my
pooket to find out the time. It was empty. I gave a gasp of astonishment. My
purse was gone too. I had been thoroughly rifled.</p>
<p>"Who's in there?" cried a voice, and a small dapper man, rather past the
prime of life, came into the room with a candle.</p>
<p>"Bless my soul, sir, my wifo told me a traveller had come, but I thought you
were in bed long ago. I'm the landlord, but I've been away all day at
Llanmorris fair."</p>
<p>"I've been robbed," said I.</p>
<p>"Robbed!" cried the landlord, nearly dropping the candle in his
consternation.</p>
<p>"Watch, money&mdash;everything gone," I said despondently. "What time is
it?"</p>
<p>"Nearly one," said he. "Are you sure there is no mistake?"</p>
<p>"No, there's no mistake. I fell asleep about eleven, so he's got two hours'
start."</p>
<p>"There was a train left about an hour and a half ago. He's clear away,
whoever he is," observed the landlord. "You seem weak, sir. Ah!" he added,
sniffing at my glass; "laudanum, I see. You've been drugged, sir."</p>
<p>"The villain! "I cried. "I know his name and history, that's one
blessing."</p>
<p>"What was it? " asked the landlord eagerly. "I'll make every police station
in the kingdom ring with it till I reach him. It is Sergeant Turnbull, formerly
of B Battery."</p>
<p>"Why, bless my soul!" oried my companion. "Why, I am Sergeant Turnbull of B
Battery, with medals for the Crimea and Mutiny, sir."</p>
<p>"Then who the deuce is he?"</p>
<p>A light eeomed to break upon the landlord.</p>
<p>"Was he a tall man with a scar on his forehead?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That's him!" I cried.</p>
<p>"Then he's the greatest villain unhung. Sergeant, indeed! Be never wore a
uniform except a convict's in his life. That's Joe Kelcey."</p>
<p>"And do you mean to say he never was in the Crimea?"</p>
<p>"Not he, sir. He's cover been out of England, except once to Gibraltar,
where he escaped very cleverly."</p>
<p>"He told me&mdash;he told me," I groaned; "and the officer with the stick,
and the sporting colonel, and the running corpses, and the Greek
priests&mdash;were they all lies?"</p>
<p>"All true as gospel, sir, but they happened to me, and not to him. He's
heard me tell the stories many a time in the bar, so he reeled them off to you,
so as to get a chance of hocussing the liquor. He's been reformed, and living
here quiet enough, but being left alone with you, and seeing your watch, has
been too much for him. Come up to bed, sir, and I'll send round and let the
police know all about it."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>And so, reader, I present you with a dtring of military anecdotes. I don't
know how you will value them. They cost me a good watoh and chain, and
&pound;14 7s 4d, and I thought them dear at the price.</p>

<h3>First published in <i>All The Year Round</i>, March 31, 1883<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>GENTLEMANLY JOE. That the name by which he was known in the banking house of
Ducat, Gulden &amp; Ducat, or at least in that branch of it which did a
thriving business in the great commercial city of Birchespool. It did not
require more than five minutes acquaintance, however, to inform the uninitiated
that the apparently complimentary epithet was bestowed rather from a keen sense
of humour on the part of his fellow-clerks, than on account of any exceptional
claims to blue blood in the case of Mr. Joseph Smith himself. Even the usual
customer, whose knowledge of Joe was limited to watching his self-satisfied
smirk and enormous watch-guard at the other side of the shining mahogany desk,
or admiring the emphasis with which he utilised his moistened thumb in
overcoming the gregarious leaves of his ledger must have been struck by the
misappropriate epithet. To us, however, who had, so to say, sat at his feet and
marveled at the war of independence which he was carrying on against the
Queen's English&mdash;a guerilla warfare consisting in attacks upon aspirates,
and the cutting off of straggling g's&mdash;to us our fanciful soubriquet was a
joke of the first water. If anything could have enhanced our enjoyment of it,
it was the innocent gravity with which our companion accepted the doubtful
title, and, after one feeble remonstrance, adopted it forever as his own
prerogative and right.</p>
<p>The circumstances of that remonstrance deserve to be recorded. Before the
arrival of Mr. Joseph Smith from the paternal training-stables&mdash;his father
was a successful sporting tout who had developed into a trainer&mdash;our
office had been a particularly aristocratic one. Welstead, our senior clerk,
was a fine, handsome young fellow of twenty-six, who came of a Scotch strain,
and was occasionally understood to make dark allusions concerning the extinct
earldom of Stirling. Dullan and Moreby were Oxford men, well connected and well
read; little Sparkins was the son of a High Church clergyman; and I had some of
the best blood of Wales in my veins. No wonder, then, that our dignity was hurt
by the appearance of a loudly dressed, scorbutic-looking youth, with horseshoe
pin and a necktie suggestive of spectrum analysis, upon the very stool vacated
by my old college friend, Vernon Hawkins&mdash;most gentlemanly and quiet of
mankind.</p>
<p>For a few days we contented ourselves with observing the habits and customs
of the creature. There was an audacity about his vulgarity, and a happy
unconsciousness of all offense, which fairly disarmed criticism. It was not
until he began to address us as "old pals," and went the length of playing a
small practical joke on little Sparkins, that a spirit of resistance began to
stir within our bosoms, and that Welstead, as usual, was pushed forward as our
mouthpiece.</p>
<p>"You see, Smith," he remarked in his most languid tones, "you have been in
our office a comparatively short period, and yet you have taught us many things
which were new to us. There is a natural buoyancy about your character which
points you out as one calculated to shine in the most select circles. Before
your arrival we had never learned to designate ladies as 'fillies,' nor had we
heard of the 'real gents,' whom you mention as having frequented your father's
establishment. These things interest and please us. Allow us to show some small
sense of the honour your society confers upon us, by christening you as
'Gentlemanly Joe,' excusing the liberty we take with your name in consideration
of the alliteration."</p>
<p>A great part of this speech must have been lost upon Mr. Joseph, but never
did elaborate sarcasm fall so utterly flat. Instead of being offended, as we
had fondly hoped would be the case, he burst into un uproarious fit of
laughter, and slapped his gaitered leg with the ebony ruler in token of
delight.</p>
<p>"Haw! haw!" he roared, writhing about on the top of the high stool,
"Whatever'll father say! Oh, law, to think of it! 'Gentlemanly Joe'&mdash;eh?
You're right, tho'; you're right and not ashamed to own up, neither. I said
when I was comin' up, 'Father,' says I. 'I'll teach them a trick or two,' and I
have, hain't I? Of course we're all gents here, for clerks is mostly reckoned
such, but it do make a difference when a man has been brought in contact with
the real thing. You can call me Gentlemanly Joe, an' pleasure, but not as
meaning to imply that there is any in this room not such, tho', maybe, not one
of you have seen a belted hearl give your father one in the short ribs and and
holler out, 'You're a deep old scoundrel, Smith, and one as knows how many
beans makes five!'"</p>
<p>Welstead's face at the idea of his gouty governor receiving such an
attention at the hands of the nobility was so ludicrous that we all burst into
a roar of laughter, which ended the first and last attempt to take a rise out
of our bucolic companion. It is true that his life was spent under a continual
shower of small jokes and chaff, and that his new name superseded his old one,
but there was a massive simplicity about the man, and a marvelous power of
converting the most unpromising remarks into compliments, which rendered him a
very disconcerting individual to attack. Allusions to his hat, necktie, or any
other peculiarity of raiment were met by his eternal horse-laugh, and an
earnest recommendation that we should allow him to send down to the country and
procure facsimiles for all and each of us. "You hain't got nothin' spicy in
Birchespool," he would I would remark. "Lord, I know a place at 'ome where you
can get your collar spotted over with fox's ends instead of bein' plain white,
which is a poor color at the best." I think he imagined it was nothing but want
of money which induced us to refuse to purchase these and other luxuries, and
he was wont to throw out allusions as to "it's not costing us nothing," while
he jingled the loose coins in his trouser pockets.</p>
<p>Town life did not improve Joseph. On the contrary, he deteriorated. During
the first six months that he honoured the office with his presence, he not only
lost none of the traits which he had brought with him from his father's
stables, but he grafted upon them everything which is objectionable in the city
snob. The premonitory symptoms were a suspicious waxiness of the half- dozen
hairs which adorned his upper lip, and the appearance of a large diamond ring
with a greenish and vitreous hue. His next venture was an eye-glass; and he
finally launched forth into a white ulster, decorated with a large black check,
which gave him the appearance of being inside a cage, with his head projecting
at one end and his feet at the other. "It's a proper thing for a gent to wear,"
he remarked. "When you see a get-up like this, you know at a glance who's a cad
and who ain't"&mdash;a sentiment which we all very cordially endorsed.</p>
<p>In spite of all these peculiarities we learned not only to tolerate the
gentleman, but even to like him. Indeed, we hardly knew how strong this feeling
was until he betook himself into the country on a fortnight's leave, carrying
with him ulster, eye-glass, ring, and everything else which was calculated to
impress the rustics and stamp him as the natural associate of the "belted
hearl." He left quite a vacancy behind him. There was a dead level of equality
about the five of 1 us which deprived life of all its piquancy. Even Welstead,
who had disliked him from the first, was fain to confess that he was good fun,
and that he wished him back. After all, if his laugh was obtrusive, it was
hearty, and his quaint, vulgar face had sincerity and good nature stamped upon
every line of it. It was with unaffected pleasure that we heard a loud view-
halloa in the street one morning just after the opening of the doors, and saw
our friend swaggering in, more ugly, more dressy, than before.</p>
<p>Newsome, our bank manager, was an excellent fellow, and on the best terms
with all of us. As we were all single men, with a very limited circle of
friends in Birchespool, he kindly gave us the run of his house, and it was
seldom that a week passed without our enjoying a musical evening there, winding
up with one of the choicest little suppers for I which Mrs. Newsome was
celebrated. On these occasions, since distinctions would be invidious,
Gentlemanly Joe used to be present in all his glory, with a very large white
frilled shirt-front, and another vitreous fragment sparkling gloomily in the
middle of it. This, with a watch chain which reminded one of the chain-cable of
a schooner, was his sole attempt at ornamentation, for, as he used to say, "It
ain't good form to show you're richer than your neighbours, even if you are.
Too much like a sheeny, don't you know?"</p>
<p>Joe was the endless source of amusement to Cissy Newsome, a mischievous,
dark-eyed little brunette of eighteen, the sole child of the manager. We had
all fallen in love with Cissy at one time or another, but had had to give it up
on finding that her heart was no longer her own to bestow. Charles Welstead had
known her from childhood, and the affection of early youth had ripened into
love on both sides. Never was there a more fondly attached couple, nor one to
whom the path seemed to lie so smoothly, for old Welstead had been Newsome's
personal friend, and Charles' prospects were of the brightest.</p>
<p>On these pleasant evenings which I have mentioned, it was great fun to see
Joe darting into the drawing-room and endeavouring to secure a seat in the
neighbourhood of the young lady, with a profound disregard for any claims her
parents might have upon his courtesy. If he attained the coveted position, he
would lean back in his chair with what he imagined to be an air of easy
gentility, and regale her with many anecdotes of horses and dogs, with
occasional reminiscences of the "big nobs" who had professional relations with
his father. On such occasions Miss Cissy would imitate him to his face in the
most amusing way, looking all the time as demure as a little mouse, while
Welstead leaned up against the piano, not quite sure whether to laugh or be
angry. Even he usually broke down, however, when the two came to discuss
"hetiquette," and Joe, in his character of gentleman, laid down his views as to
when a "feller should raise 'is 'at," and when not. The argument was generally
closed by a burst of laughter from all of us, in which Joseph would join,
though protesting loudly that he was unable to see the joke.</p>
<p>It is a proverbially dangerous thing to play with edged tools. I have never
been sure whether Smith knew how matters stood between Welstead and the young
lady. I am inclined to think that at first he did not. Perhaps, if some one had
informed him of it then, he might have mastered his feelings, and much misery
have been averted. It was clear to the young fellows who had gone through the
same experience how things were tending, but we held our tongues rather than,
spoil what we considered a capital joke. Cissy may have seen it too, and given
him a little mischievous encouragement&mdash;at least, young ladies have the
credit of not being blind in such cases. Certainly Smith pursued his hopeless
suit with a vigour which astonished us. During business hours he lived in a
sort of day-dream, musing upon his perch like some cogitative fowl, and getting
into endless trouble over his accounts, while every evening found him
interfering with Welstead's t&ecirc;te-&agrave;- t&ecirc;te at the high corner
house in Eldon street.</p>
<p>At last the crash came. There was no need to ask what had happened when
little Joe slunk quietly into the office one morning with dishevelled hair,
melancholy face, and eyes bleared with the wakefulness of a restless night. We
never learned the particulars of his dismissal. Suffice it that he was informed
once and forever that a gap which there was no crossing lay between Miss Cissy
Newsome and himself. He bore up bravely, and tried to hug his sorrow to heart,
and hide it from the vulgar gaze of mankind, but he became an altered man. What
had been but a passing fancy with us had taken root in his very soul and grown
there, so that he, who had barely known when it was planted, was now unable to
wrench it out. The ordeal he had gone through chastened him to a great extent
from his vulgarity by toning down his natural spirits, and though he
occasionally ventured upon a "Haw! haw!" it was painfully artificial, and a
good deal more suggestive of a dirge than a merriment. The worst feature of his
case was that every week increased the gloom which hung over him.</p>
<p>We began to suspect that our estimate of his character had been a
superficial one, and that there were depths in the little man's soul of whose
existence we had been ignorant.</p>
<p>Four months had passed away. None of us had changed much during that time,
with the exception of the Gentleman. We saw little of him except in office
hours. Where he spent the rest of the day was a mystery. Once I met him late at
night in the docks, stumbling along among ring-bolts and chains, careless of
the fact that a trip or slip might send him into eternity. Another time I saw a
cloaked figure lurking in the shadow beside the house in Eldon street, which
fled round the corner on my approach. His naturally unhealthy complexion had
become so cadaverous that the sandy eyebrows and mustache stood out quite dark
against it. His clothes hung loosely on his figure. The eye- glass was
discarded. Even the once gorgeous ring seemed to have assumed a somber and
melancholy luster, as if in sympathy with the feelings of the owner. His manner
had lost all its old audacity, and become timid and retiring. I doubt if anv of
his rustic acquaintances would have recognised their gaudy Joseph in the
shambling, unkempt figure which haunted the counting house of Ducat, Gulden
&amp; Ducat.</p>
<p>The termination of Welstead's engagement began to draw near. It had been
arranged that after his marriage he was to be promoted to the management of
another branch in a distant part of the country. This approaching break-up in
our little circle drew us all closer together, and made us the more sorry that
the general harmony should he destroyed by the unhappiness of one of our
number. If we could have cheered him we would, but there was something in his
look, for all his snobbishness, which forbade even sympathy on a subject so
sacred. He endeavoured to put on a carelees manner when he joined us all in
wishing Welstead good luck at mid-day on the Saturday preceding the Monday on
which the wedding was to take place. We expected then that we should not see
our fellow-clerk again until he appeared in the character of bridegroom. How
little did we guess the catastrophe which was impending.</p>
<p>I remember that Saturday evening well. It was in January, and a clear wintry
sky, with a suspicion of an aurora in its northern quarter, spread over the
great city. There was a slight frost in the air, and the ground clinked
cheerily under foot. One of my fellow clerks&mdash;Dullan&mdash;and I had kept
by little Smith all day, for there was a wild look about his eyes which made us
think he might be unsafe to leave him to his own devices. We dined at a
restaurant, and afterward dropped into a theater, where Joe's ghastly face in
the stalls had a very depressing effect upon the pantomime. We were walking
slowly homeward after supper, it being then between twelve and one, when we saw
a great crimson glow upon the heavens, such as aurora never threw, and a fire
engine dashed past us with a whistle and a clang, the big-boned shaggy horses
whirling it along at such a rate that we only caught a glimpse of a flash of
lights and a cluster of bearded, helmeted heads suspended, as it were, in the
darkness.</p>
<p>I have always had a weakness for fires. There is something grand and
ennobling in the irresistible sweep of a great volume of flame. I could
moralise over a conflagration as Chateaubriand did over Niagara. Dullan is of
the same bent of mind, and the Gentleman was ready to turn anywhere from his
own thoughts. We all began running in the direction of the blaze.</p>
<p>At first we ran languidly, jogging along with many other people who were
hurrying toward the same goal. Then, as we came to a quarter of the town which
we knew well, we almost involuntarily quickened our pace, until, tearing around
a familiar corner at racing speed, we pulled up, and gazed silently into each
other's pale faces. There, not a hundred yards from us, stood the high house of
Eldon street&mdash;the house under whose hospitable roof we had spent so many
happy hours&mdash;with the red flames licking round the whole lower story, and
spurting out of every chink and crevice, while a dense pall of smoke obscured
the upper windows and the roof.</p>
<p>We dashed through the crowd together, and fought our way to the clear space
on which the firemen were connecting their hose. As we reached them, a half
naked man. bare-footed and dishevelled, was pleading with the superintendent,
clutching frantically at his arm, and pointing up to the dark clouds above him,
already rent with jagged streaks of ascending flame.</p>
<p>"Too short!" he screamed, in a voice which we were horrified to recognise as
that of Mr. Newsome. "It can't be&mdash;it musn't be! There are more escapes
than one. Oh, man, she is burning&mdash;choking&mdash;suffering! Do something!
Save her! My child&mdash;my beautiful child&mdash;the only one I have!"</p>
<p>In the agony of his fear, he fell at the fireman's feet and implored his
assistance.</p>
<p>I was paralysed by the horror of the thing. The situation was apparent at a
glance. There, seen dimly through the smoke, was Cissy Newsome's window, while
beneath it, separated by a broad expanse of wall, was the head of the fire
escape. It was too short by a good twelve feet. The whole lower story was one
seething mass of fire, so that there seemed no possibility of approach from
that direction. A horrible feeling of impotence came over me. There was no sign
of movement at the young lady's window, though crawling trails of flame had
climbed up to it and festooned it round with their red garlands. I remember
hoping in my heart that she had been suffocated in her sleep, and had never
awoke to the dreadful reality.</p>
<p>I have said that we were paralysed for the moment. The spell was rapidly
broken. "This way, lads!"cried a resolute voice, and Charley Welstead broke in
among us with a fireman's hatchet in his hand. We pushed after him as he rushed
round to the rear of the house, where there was a door usually used by the
servants. It was locked, but a couple of blows shattered it to pieces. We
hurried up the stone kitchen stairs, with the plaster falling in strips all
around us, and the flags so hot that they burnt into the soles of our boots. At
the head of the stairs there was a second door, thicker and stronger than the
first, but nearly charred through by the fire.</p>
<p>"Give me room!" gasped Welstead, swinging round his axe.</p>
<p>"Don't do it, sir," cried a stalwart fireman, seizing him by the wrist;
"there's flames on the other side of that door."</p>
<p>"Let me go,"roared Charley.</p>
<p>"We're dead men if you break it!"</p>
<p>"Let me go!"</p>
<p>"Drop it, sir; drop it!"</p>
<p>There was a momentary struggle, and the axe clattered down upon the stone
step. It had hardly time to fall before some one caught it up. I could not see
who for the dense blue reek of smoke. A man dashed past the fireman, there was
the crash of the parting lock, and a great lick of flame, like a hound
unleashed, shot out and enveloped us. I felt its hot sear as it coiled round my
face, and I remember nothing more until I found myself leaning against the door
post, breathing in the fresh, sweet air of night, while Welstead, terribly
burned, struggled furiously with the fireman who held him back to prevent him
from reascending the staircase, which was now a solid sheet of fire.</p>
<p>"Hold back, sir! "I heard the honest follow growl; "ain't one life thrown
away enough? That little cove&mdash;him with the gaiters&mdash;the same that
broke the door&mdash;he's gone. I seen him jump rigbt slap into the middle of
it. He won't never come back no more!"</p>
<p>Together we led Welstead round to the front once more, all three staggering
like drunken men. The flames were higher than before, but the upper story and
the roof still rose above them like a black island in a sea of fire. There was
Mies Cissy's window dark and unopened, but the woodwork around it was in a
glow. There was no sign of the flutter of a female dress. How terrible it was
to stand and wait for the end, powerless to stretch out a saving hand. Poor
Welstead leaned against me sobbing like a child. A ghastly longing came into my
heart that I might see the flames in that room, that I might know it to be all
over, and her trouble at an end. Then I heard the crash of glass falling
outward, and I bent my head to avoid seeing the very thing that I had wished
for; and then there broke upon my ear a shout from ten thousand voices, so
wildly exultant and madly jubilant that I never hope to hear the like
again.</p>
<p>Welstead and I looked up. Balanced upon the narrow ledge outside the window
I had been watching, there was standing a man, framed, as it were, in fire. His
clothes were hanging around him as a few tattered, charred rags, and his very
hair was in a-blaze. The draught caused by knocking out the window had
encouraged the flames, so that a lurid curtain hung behind him, while the
ground was fully seventy feet below. Yet there on the thin slip of stone, with
eternity each side of him, stood Joe Smith, the uncouth and ungrammatical,
tying two sheets together, while women sobbed below and men shouted, and every
hand was raised to bless him. He staggered and disappeared so suddenly that we
feared he had fallen, but he was back again in an instant&mdash;not alone this
time, for the girl he had come to save was slung over his shoulder. The brave
fellow seemed to have doubts of the strength of his impromptu rope, for he
rested his own weight upon the nearly red-hot water pipe during those twelve
perilous feet, supporting Miss Newsome by the arm which clutched the sheet.</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, they descended, but at last his feet touched the
topmost rung of the escape. Was it a dream that I heard a voice high above me
say: "Hall right, missy," before a burst of cheering rang out which drowned
every other sound.</p>
<p>Miss Cissy, more frightened than hurt, was delivered over into her half-
distracted father's care, while I helped to lift Gentleman Joe from the escape.
He lay panting upon the ground, burned and scorched, his sporting coat tattered
and charred, while, strangely enough, the prismatic necktie and horse-shoe pin
had escaped the general destruction, so as to present an absurd oasis amid the
desert around. He lay without speaking or moving until Cissy Newsome was led
past him on her way to a cab. Then he made a feeble gesture with his hand,
which indicated that he wished to speak with her, and she stooped over him. No
other ear but mine caught that whisper.</p>
<p>"Don't fret, miss," he said, "'cause it was the wrong 'orse came in. He's a
good feller&mdash;a deal better than me&mdash;and did as much but hadn't the
luck."</p>
<p>A vulgar little speech, but Cissy's eyes got very moist as she listened, and
I'm not sure that mine didn't too.</p>
<p>The office was sadly reduced after that. With Welstead and the Gentleman on
the sick list, there were only four of us at the desk, and the reaction from
the excitement had left us anything but lively. I can remember only one remark
ventured upon during that first day. The dreary scratching of pens had lasted
unbroken for over an hour, when little Sparkins looked up from his ledger
saying:</p>
<p>"I suppose you would call him a gentleman, after all," he said.</p>
<p>"A very much better one than you will ever be," growled Dullan, and we
relapsed into the scratching of pens.</p>
<p>I was present at the wedding of Charley Welstead and Cissy Newsome, when,
after a long delay, it was finally celebrated. By the original arrangement I
was to have figured as best man, but my post of honour was handed over to a
ve'ry ugly young man whose appearance suggested the idea that he had spent the
last few weeks in a mustard poultice. Unromantic as it may seem, this youth not
only went through his duties with all the nonchalance in the world, but danced
at the subsequent festivities with the greatest vigour and grace. It is
commonly rumoured that this activity of his, combined with sundry interesting
anecdotes concerning horses and dogs, have so prevailed upon the heart of a
susceptible young lady, that there is every probability of our having a
repetition of the marriage ceremony. Should it be so, I trust that I may at
last revert to my original position as best man.</p>

<blockquote>"Caution.&mdash;The public are hereby cautioned against a man
calling himself Octavius Gaster. He is to be recognised by his great height,
his flaxen hair, and deep scar upon his left cheek, extending from the eye to
the angle of the mouth. His predilection for bright colours&mdash;green
neckties, and the like&mdash;may help to identify him. A slightly foreign
accent is to be detected in his speech. This man is beyond the reach of the
law, but is more dangerous than a mad dog. Shun him as you would shun the
pestilence that walketh at noonday. Any communications as to his whereabouts
will be thankfully acknowledged by A.C.U., Lincoln's Inn, London."</blockquote>
This is a copy of an advertisement which may have been noticed by many readers
in the columns of the London morning papers during the early part of the
present year. It has, I believe, excited considerable curiosity in certain
quarters, and many guesses have been hazarded as to the identity of Octavius
Gaster and the nature of the charge brought against him. When I state that the
"caution" has been inserted by my elder brother, Arthur Cooper Underwood,
barrister-at-law, upon my representations, it will be acknowledged that I am
the most fitting person to enter upon an authentic explanation.
<p>Hitherto the horror and vagueness of my suspicion, combined with my grief at
the loss of my poor darling on the very eve of our wedding, have prevented me
from revealing the events of last August to anyone save my brother.</p>
<p>Now, however, looking back, I can fit in many little facts almost unnoticed
at the time, which form a chain of evidence that, though worthless in a court
of law, may yet have some effect upon the mind of the public.</p>
<p>I shall therefore relate, without exaggeration or prejudice, all that
occurred from the day upon which this man, Octavius Gaster, entered Toynby Hall
up to the great rifle competition. I know that many people will always ridicule
the supernatural, or what our poor intellects choose to regard as supernatural,
and that the fact of my being a woman will be thought to weaken my evidence. I
can only plead that I have never been weak-minded or impressionable, and that
other people formed the same opinions of Octavius Gaster that I did.</p>
<p>Now to the story.</p>
<p>It was at Colonel Pillar's place at Roborough, in the pleasant county of
Devon, that we spent our autumn holidays. For some months I had been engaged to
his eldest son Charley, and it was hoped that the marriage might take place
before the termination of the Long Vacation.</p>
<p>Charley was considered "safe" for his degree, and in any case was rich
enough to be practically independent, while I was by no means penniless.</p>
<p>The old Colonel was delighted at the prospect of the match, and so was my
mother; so that look what way we would, there seemed to be no cloud above our
horizon.</p>
<p>It was no wonder, then, that that August was a happy one. Even the most
miserable of mankind would have laid his woes aside under the genial influence
of the merry household at Toynby Hall.</p>
<p>There was Lieutenant Daseby, "Jack," as he was invariably called, fresh home
from Japan in Her Majesty's ship <i>Shark,</i> who was on the same interesting
footing with Fanny Pillar, Charley's sister, as Charley was with me, so that we
were able to lend each other a certain moral support.</p>
<p>Then there was Harry, Charley's younger brother, and Trevor, his bosom
friend at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Finally there was my mother, dearest of old ladies, beaming at us through
her gold-rimmed spectacles, anxiously smoothing every little difficulty in the
way of the two young couples, and never weary of detailing to them <i>her</i>
own doubts and fears and perplexities when that gay young blood, Mr. Nicholas
Underwood, came a-wooing into the provinces, and forswore Crockford's and
Tattersall's for the sake of the country parson's daughter.</p>
<p>I must not, however, forget the gallant old warrior who was our host; with
his time-honoured jokes, and his gout, and his harmless affectation of
ferocity.</p>
<p>"I don't know what's come over the governor lately," Charley used to say.
"He has never cursed the Liberal Administration since you've been here, Lottie;
and my belief is that unless he has a good blow-off, that Irish question will
get into his system and finish him."</p>
<p>Perhaps in the privacy of his own apartment the veteran used to make up for
his self-abnegation during the day.</p>
<p>He seemed to have taken a special fancy to me, which he showed in a hundred
little attentions.</p>
<p>"You're a good lass," he remarked one evening, in a very port-winey whisper.
"Charley's a lucky dog, egad! and has more discrimination than I thought. Mark
my words, Miss Underwood, you'll find that young gentleman isn't such a fool as
he looks!"</p>
<p>With which equivocal compliment the Colonel solemnly covered his face with
his handkerchief, and went off into the land of dreams.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>How well I remember the day that was the commencement of all our
miseries!</p>
<p>Dinner was over, and we were in the drawing-room, with the windows open to
admit the balmy southern breeze.</p>
<p>My mother was sitting in the corner, engaged on a piece of fancy-work, and
occasionally purring forth some truism which the dear old soul believed to be
an entirely original remark, and founded exclusively upon her own individual
experiences.</p>
<p>Fanny and the young lieutenant were billing and cooing upon the sofa, while
Charley paced restlessly about the room.</p>
<p>I was sitting by the window, gazing out dreamily at the great wilderness of
Dartmoor, which stretched away to the horizon, ruddy and glowing in the light
of the sinking sun, save where some rugged tor stood out in bold relief against
the scarlet background.</p>
<p>"I say," remarked Charley, coming over to join me at the window, "it seems a
positive shame to waste an evening like this."</p>
<p>"Confound the evening!" said Jack Daseby.</p>
<p>"You're always victimising yourself to the weather. Fan and I ar'n't going
to move off this sofa&mdash;are we, Fan?"</p>
<p>That young lady announced her intention of remaining by nestling among the
cushions, and glancing defiantly at her brother.</p>
<p>"Spooning is a demoralising thing&mdash;isn't it, Lottie?" said Charley,
appealing laughingly to me.</p>
<p>"Shockingly so," I answered.</p>
<p>"Why, I can remember Daseby here when he was as active a young fellow as any
in Devon; and just look at him now! Fanny, Fanny, you've got a lot to answer
for!"</p>
<p>"Never mind him, my dear," said my mother, from the corner. "Still, my
experience has always shown me that moderation is an excellent thing for young
people. Poor dear Nicholas used to think so too. He would never go to bed of a
night until he had jumped the length of the hearthrug. I often told him it was
dangerous; but he <i>would</i> do it, until one night he fell on the fender and
snapped the muscle of his leg, which made him limp till the day of his death,
for Doctor Pearson mistook it for a fracture of the bone, and put him in
splints, which had the effect of stiffening his knee. They did say that the
doctor was almost out of his mind at the time from anxiety, brought on by his
younger daughter swallowing a halfpenny, and that that was what caused him to
make the mistake."</p>
<p>My mother had a curious way of drifting along in her conversation, and
occasionally rushing off at a tangent, which made it rather difficult to
remember her original proposition. On this occasion Charley had, however,
stowed it away in his mind as likely to admit of immediate application.</p>
<p>"An excellent thing, as you say, Mrs. Underwood," he remarked; "and we have
not been out to-day. Look here, Lottie, we have an hour of daylight yet.
Suppose we go down and have a try for a trout, if your mamma does not
object."</p>
<p>"Put something round your throat, dear," said my mother, feeling that she
had been outmanoeuvred.</p>
<p>"All right, dear," I answered; "I'll just run up and put on my hat."</p>
<p>"And we'll have a walk back in the gloaming," said Charley, as I made for
the door.</p>
<p>When I came down, I found my lover waiting impatiently with his fishing
basket in the hall.</p>
<p>We crossed the lawn together, and passed the open drawing-room windows,
where three mischievous faces were looking at us.</p>
<p>"Spooning is a terribly demoralising thing," remarked Jack, reflectively
staring up at the clouds.</p>
<p>"Shocking," said Fan; and all three laughed until they woke the sleeping
Colonel, and we could hear them endeavouring to explain the joke to that
ill-used veteran, who apparently obstinately refused to appreciate it.</p>
<p>We passed down the winding lane together, and through the little wooden
gate, which opens on to the Tavistock road.</p>
<p>Charley paused for a moment after we had emerged and seemed irresolute which
way to turn.</p>
<p>Had we but known it, our fate depended upon that trivial question.</p>
<p>"Shall we go down to the river, dear," he said, "or shall we try one of the
brooks upon the moor?"</p>
<p>"Whichever you like?" I answered.</p>
<p>"Well, I vote that we cross the moor. We'll have a longer walk back that
way," he added, looking down lovingly at the little white-shawled figure beside
him.</p>
<p>The brook in question runs through a most desolate part of the country. By
the path it is several miles from Toynby Hall; but we were both young and
active, and struck out across the moor, regardless of rocks and
furze-bushes.</p>
<p>Not a living creature did we meet upon our solitary walk, save a few scraggy
Devonshire sheep, who looked at us wistfully, and followed us for some
distance, as if curious as to what could possibly have induced us to trespass
upon their domains.</p>
<p>It was almost dark before we reached the little stream, which comes gurgling
down through a precipitous glen, and meanders away to help to form the Plymouth
"leat."</p>
<p>Above us towered two great columns of rock, between which the water trickled
to form a deep, still pool at the bottom. This pool had always been a favourite
spot of Charley's, and was a pretty cheerful place by day; but now, with the
rising moon reflected upon its glassy waters, and throwing dark shadows from
the overhanging rocks, it seemed anything rather than the haunt of a
pleasure-seeker.</p>
<p>"I don't think, darling, that I'll fish, after all," said Charley, as we sat
down together on a mossy bank. "It's a dismal sort of place, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Very," said I, shuddering.</p>
<p>"We'll just have a rest, and then we will walk back by the pathway. You're
shivering. You're not cold, are you?"</p>
<p>"No," said I, trying to keep up my courage; "I'm not cold, but I'm rather
frightened, though it's very silly of me."</p>
<p>"By jove!" said my lover, "I can't wonder at it, for I feel a bit depressed
myself. The noise that water makes is like the gurgling in the throat of a
dying man."</p>
<p>"Don't, Charley; you frighten me!"</p>
<p>"Come, dear, we mustn't get the blues," he said, with a laugh, trying to
reassure me. "Let's run away from this charnel-house place,
and&mdash;Look!&mdash;see!&mdash;good gracious! what is that?"</p>
<p>Charley had staggered back, and was gazing upwards with a pallid face.</p>
<p>I followed the direction of his eyes, and could scarcely suppress a
scream.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that the pool by which we were standing lay at the
foot of a rough mound of rocks. On the top of this mound, about sixty feet
above our heads, a tall dark figure was standing, peering down, apparently,
into the rugged hollow in which we were.</p>
<p>The moon was just topping the ridge behind, and the gaunt, angular outlines
of the stranger stood out hard and clear against its silvery radiance.</p>
<p>There was something ghastly in the sudden and silent appearance of this
solitary wanderer, especially when coupled with the weird nature of the
scene.</p>
<p>I clung to my lover in speechless terror, and glared up at the dark figure
above us.</p>
<p>"Hullo, you sir!" cried Charley, passing from fear into anger, as Englishmen
generally do. "Who are you, and what the devil are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Oh! I thought it, I thought it!" said the man who was overlooking us, and
disappeared from the top of the hill.</p>
<p>We heard him scrambling about among the loose stones, and in another moment
he emerged upon the banks of the brook and stood facing us.</p>
<p>Weird as his appearance had been when we first caught sight of him, the
impression was intensified rather than removed by a closer acquaintance.</p>
<p>The moon shining full upon him revealed a long, thin face of ghastly pallor,
the effect being increased by its contrast with the flaring green necktie which
he wore.</p>
<p>A scar upon his cheek had healed badly and caused a nasty pucker at the side
of his mouth, which gave his whole countenance a most distorted expression,
more particularly when he smiled.</p>
<p>The knapsack on his back and stout staff in his hand announced him to be a
tourist, while the easy grace with which he raised his hat on perceiving the
presence of a lady showed that he could lay claim to the <i>savoir faire</i> of
a man of the world.</p>
<p>There was something in his angular proportions and the bloodless face which,
taken in conjunction with the black cloak which fluttered from his shoulders,
irresistibly reminded me of a bloodsucking species of bat which Jack Daseby had
brought from Japan upon his previous voyage, and which was the bugbear of the
servants' hall at Toynby.</p>
<p>"Excuse my intrusion," he said, with a slightly foreign lisp, which imparted
a peculiar beauty to his voice. "I should have had to sleep on the moor had I
not had the good fortune to fall in with you."</p>
<p>"Confound it, man!" said Charley; "why couldn't you shout out, or give some
warning? You quite frightened Miss Underwood when you suddenly appeared up
there."</p>
<p>The stranger once more raised his hat as he apologised to me for having
given me such a start.</p>
<p>"I am a gentleman from Sweden," he continued, in that peculiar intonation of
his, "and am viewing this beautiful land of yours. Allow me to introduce myself
as Doctor Octavius Gaster. Perhaps you could tell me where I may sleep, and how
I can get from this place, which is truly of great size?"</p>
<p>"You're very lucky in falling in with us," said Charley. "It is no easy
matter to find your way upon the moor."</p>
<p>"That can I well believe," remarked our new acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Strangers have been found dead on it before now," continued Charley. "They
lose themselves, and then wander in a circle until they fall from fatigue."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the Swede; "it is not I, who have drifted in an open boat
from Cape Blanco to Canary, that will starve upon an English moor. But how may
I turn to seek an inn?"</p>
<p>"Look here!" said Charley, whose interest was excited by the stranger's
allusion, and who was at all times the most openhearted of men. "There's not an
inn for many a mile round; and I daresay you have had a long day's walk
already. Come home with us, and my father, the Colonel, will be delighted to
see you and find you a spare bed."</p>
<p>"For this great kindness how can I thank you?" returned the traveller.
"Truly, when I return to Sweden, I shall have strange stories to tell of the
English and the hospitality!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Charley. "Come, we will start at once, for Miss Underwood
is cold. Wrap the shawl well round your neck, Lottie, and we will be home in no
time."</p>
<p>We stumbled along in silence, keeping as far as we could to the rugged
pathway, sometimes losing it as a cloud drifted over the face of the moon, and
then regaining it further on with the return of the light.</p>
<p>The stranger seemed buried in thought, but once or twice I had the
impression that he was looking hard at me through the darkness as we strode
along together.</p>
<p>"So," said Charley at last, breaking the silence, "you drifted about in an
open boat, did you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," answered the stranger; "many strange sights have I seen, and many
perils undergone, but none worse than that. It is, however, too sad a subject
for a lady's ears. She has been frightened once to-night."</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid of frightening me now," said I, as I leaned on
Charley's arm.</p>
<p>"Indeed there is but little to tell, and yet is it sorrowful.</p>
<p>"A friend of mine, Karl Osgood of Upsala, and myself started on a trading
venture. Few white men had been among the wandering Moors at Cape Blanco, but
nevertheless we went, and for some months lived well, selling this and that,
and gathering much ivory and gold.</p>
<p>"'Tis a strange country, where is neither wood nor stone, so that the huts
are made from the weeds of the sea.</p>
<p>"At last, just as what we thought was a sufficiency, the Moors conspired to
kill us, and came down against us in the night.</p>
<p>"Short was our warning, but we fled to the beach, launched a canoe and put
out to sea, leaving everything behind.</p>
<p>"The Moors chased us, but lost us in the darkness; and when day dawned the
land was out of sight.</p>
<p>"There was no country where we could hope for food nearer than Canary, and
for that we made.</p>
<p>"I reached it alive, though very weak and mad; but poor Karl died the day
before we sighted the islands.</p>
<p>"I gave him warning!</p>
<p>"I cannot blame myself in the matter.</p>
<p>"I said, 'Karl, the strength that you might gain by eating them would be
more than made up for by the blood that you would lose!'</p>
<p>"He laughed at my words, caught the knife from my belt, cut them off and eat
them; and he died."</p>
<p>"Eat what?" asked Charley.</p>
<p>"His ears!" said the stranger.</p>
<p>We both looked round at him in horror.</p>
<p>There was no suspicion of a smile or joke upon his ghastly face.</p>
<p>"He was what you call headstrong," he continued, "but he should have known
better than to do a thing like that. Had he but used his will he would have
lived as I did."</p>
<p>"And you think a man's will can prevent him from feeling hungry?" said
Charley.</p>
<p>"What can it not do?" returned Octavius Gaster, and relapsed into a silence
which was not broken until our arrival in Toynby Hall.</p>
<p>Considerable alarm had been caused by our nonappearance, and Jack Daseby was
just setting off with Charley's friend Trevor in search of us. They were
delighted, therefore, when we marched in upon them, and considerably astonished
at the appearance of our companion.</p>
<p>"Where the deuce did you pick up that second-hand corpse?" asked Jack,
drawing Charley aside into the smoking-room.</p>
<p>"Shut up, man; he'll hear you," growled Charley. "He's a Swedish doctor on a
tour, and a deuced good fellow. He went in an open boat from What's-it's-name
to another place. I've offered him a bed for the night."</p>
<p>"Well, all I can say is," remarked Jack, "that his face will never be his
fortune."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! Very good! very good!" laughed the subject of the remark, walking
calmly into the room, to the complete discomfiture of the sailor. "No, it will
never, as you say, in this country be my fortune,"&mdash;and he grinned until
the hideous gash across the angle of his mouth made him look more like the
reflection in a broken mirror than anything else.</p>
<p>"Come upstairs and have a wash; I can lend you a pair of slippers," said
Charley; and hurried the visitor out of the room to put an end to a somewhat
embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>Colonel Pillar was the soul of hospitality, and welcomed Doctor Gaster as
effusively as if he had been an old friend of the family.</p>
<p>"Egad, sir," he said, "the place is your own; and as long as you care to
stop you are very welcome. We're pretty quiet down here, and a visitor is an
acquisition."</p>
<p>My mother was a little more distant. "A very well informed young man,
Lottie," she remarked to me; "but I wish he would wink his eyes more. I don't
like to see people who never wink their eyes. Still, my dear, my life has
taught me one great lesson, and that is that a man's looks are of very little
importance compared with his actions."</p>
<p>With which brand new and eminently original remark, my mother kissed me and
left me to my meditations.</p>
<p>Whatever Doctor Octavius Gaster might be physically, he was certainly a
social success.</p>
<p>By next day he had so completely installed himself as a member of the
household that the Colonel would not hear of his departure.</p>
<p>He astonished everybody by the extent and variety of his knowledge. He could
tell the veteran considerably more about the Crimea than he knew himself; he
gave the sailor information about the coast of Japan; and even tackled my
athletic lover upon the subject of rowing, discoursing about levers of the
first order, and fixed points and fulcra, until the unhappy Cantab was fain to
drop the subject.</p>
<p>Yet all this was done so modestly and even deferentially, that no one could
possibly feel offended at being beaten upon their own ground. There was a quiet
power about everything he said and did which was very striking.</p>
<p>I remember one example of this, which impressed us all at the time.</p>
<p>Trevor had a remarkably savage bulldog, which, however fond of its master,
fiercely resented any liberties from the rest of us. This animal was, it may be
imagined, rather unpopular, but as it was the pride of the student's heart it
was agreed not to banish it entirely, but to lock it up in the stable and give
it a wide berth.</p>
<p>From the first, it seemed to have taken a decided aversion to our visitor,
and showed every fang in its head whenever he approached it.</p>
<p>On the second day of his visit we were passing the stable in a body, when
the growls of the creature inside arrested Doctor Gaster's attention.</p>
<p>"Ha!" he said. "There is that dog of yours, Mr. Trevor, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes; that's Towzer," assented Trevor.</p>
<p>"He is a bulldog, I think? What they call the national animal of England on
the Continent?"</p>
<p>"Pure-bred," said the student, proudly.</p>
<p>"They are ugly animals&mdash;very ugly! Would you come into the stable and
unchain him, that I may see him to advantage. It is a pity to keep an animal so
powerful and full of life in captivity."</p>
<p>"He's rather a nipper," said Trevor, with a mischievous expression in his
eye; "but I suppose you are not afraid of a dog?"</p>
<p>"Afraid?&mdash;no. Why should I be afraid?"</p>
<p>The mischievous look on Trevor's face increased as he opened the stable
door. I heard Charley mutter something to him about its being past a joke, but
the other's answer was drowned by the hollow growling from inside.</p>
<p>The rest of us retreated to a respectable distance, while Octavius Gaster
stood in the open doorway with a look of mild curiosity upon his pallid
face.</p>
<p>"And those," he said, "that I see so bright and red in the
darkness&mdash;are those his eyes?"</p>
<p>"Those are they," said the student, as he stooped down and unbuckled the
strap.</p>
<p>"Come here!" said Octavius Gaster.</p>
<p>The growling of the dog suddenly subsided into a long whimper, and instead
of making the furious rush that we expected, he rustled among the straw as if
trying to huddle into a corner.</p>
<p>"What the deuce is the matter with him?" exclaimed his perplexed owner.</p>
<p>"Come here!" repeated Gaster, in sharp metallic accents, with an
indescribable air of command in them. "Come here!"</p>
<p>To our astonishment, the dog trotted out and stood at his side, but looking
as unlike the usually pugnacious Towzer as is possible to conceive. His ears
were drooping, his tail limp, and he altogether presented the very picture of
canine humiliation.</p>
<p>"A very fine dog, but singularly quiet," remarked the Swede, as he stroked
him down.</p>
<p>"Now, sir, go back!"</p>
<p>The brute turned and slunk back into its corner. We heard the rattling of
its chain as it was being fastened, and next moment Trevor came out of the
stable-door with blood dripping from his finger.</p>
<p>"Confound the beast!" he said. "I don't know what can have come over him.
I've had him three years, and he never bit me before."</p>
<p>I fancy&mdash;I cannot say it for certain&mdash;but I fancy that there was a
spasmodic twitching of the cicatrix upon our visitor's face, which betokened an
inclination to laugh.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think that it was from that moment that I began to have a
strange indefinable fear and dislike of the man.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Week followed week, and the day fixed for my marriage began to draw
near.</p>
<p>Octavius Gaster was still a guest at Toynby Hall, and, indeed, had so
ingratiated himself with the proprietor that any hint at departure was laughed
to scorn by that worthy soldier.</p>
<p>"Here you've come, sir, and here you'll stay; you shall, by Jove!"</p>
<p>Whereat Octavius would smile and shrug his shoulders and mutter something
about the attractions of Devon, which would put the Colonel in a good humour
for the whole day afterwards.</p>
<p>My darling and I were too much engrossed with each other to pay very much
attention to the traveller's occupations. We used to come upon him sometimes in
our rambles through the woods, sitting reading in the most lonely
situations.</p>
<p>He always placed the book in his pocket when he saw us approaching. I
remember on one occasion, however, that we stumbled upon him so suddenly that
the volume was still lying open before him.</p>
<p>"Ah, Gaster," said Charley, "studying, as usual! What an old bookworm you
are! What's the book? Ah, a foreign language; Swedish, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No, it is not Swedish," said Gaster; "it is Arabic."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say you know Arabic?"</p>
<p>"Oh, very well&mdash;very well indeed!"</p>
<p>"And what's it about?" I asked, turning over the leaves of the musty old
volume.</p>
<p>"Nothing that would interest one so young and fair as yourself, Miss
Underwood," he answered, looking at me in a way which had become habitual to
him of late. "It treats of the days when mind was stronger than what you call
matter; when great spirits lived that were able to exist without these coarse
bodies of ours, and could mould all things to their so-powerful wills."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see; a kind of ghost story," said Charley. "Well, adieu; we won't
keep you from your studies."</p>
<p>We left him sitting in the little glen still absorbed in his mystical
treatise. It must have been imagination which induced me, on turning suddenly
round half an hour later, to think that I saw his familiar figure glide rapidly
behind a tree.</p>
<p>I mentioned it to Charley at the time, but he laughed my idea to scorn.<br>
<br></p>
<p>I alluded just now to a peculiar manner which this man Gaster had of looking
at me. His eyes seemed to lose their usual steely expression when he did so,
and soften into something which might be almost called caressing. They seemed
to influence me strangely, for I could always tell, without looking at him,
when his gaze was fixed upon me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I fancied that this idea was simply due to a disordered nervous
sytem or morbid imagination; but my mother dispelled that delusion from my
mind.</p>
<p>"Do you know," she said, coming into my bedroom one night, and carefully
shutting the door behind her, "if the idea was not so utterly preposterous,
Lottie, I should say that that Doctor was madly in love with you?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, 'ma!" said I, nearly dropping my candle in my consternation at
the thought.</p>
<p>"I really think so, Lottie," continued my mother. "He's got a way of looking
which is very like that of your poor dear father, Nicholas, before we were
married. Something of this sort, you know."</p>
<p>And the old lady cast an utterly heart-broken glance at the bed-post.</p>
<p>"Now, go to bed," said I, "and don't have such funny ideas. Why, poor Doctor
Gaster knows that I am engaged as well as you do."</p>
<p>"Time will show," said the old lady, as she left the room; and I went to bed
with the words still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>Certainly, it is a strange thing that on that very night a thrill which I
had come to know well ran through me, and awakened me from my slumbers.</p>
<p>I stole softly to the window, and peered out through the bars of the
Venetian blinds, and there was the gaunt, vampire-like figure of our Swedish
visitor standing upon the gravel-walk, and apparently gazing up at my
window.</p>
<p>It may have been that he detected the movement of the blind, for, lighting a
cigarette, he began pacing up and down the avenue.</p>
<p>I noticed that at breakfast next morning he went out of his way to explain
the fact that he had been restless during the night, and had steadied his
nerves by a short stroll and a smoke.</p>
<p>After all, when I came to consider it calmly, the aversion which I had
against the man and my distrust of him were founded on very scanty grounds. A
man might have a strange face, and be fond of curious literature, and even look
approvingly at an engaged young lady, without being a very dangerous member of
society.</p>
<p>I say this to show that even up to that point I was perfectly unbiased and
free from prejudice in my opinion of Octavius Gaster.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"I say!" remarked Lieutenant Daseby, one morning; "what do you think of
having a picnic to-day?"</p>
<p>"Capital!" ejaculated everybody.</p>
<p>"You see, they are talking of commissioning the old <i>Shark</i> soon, and
Trevor here will have to go back to the mill. We may as well compress as much
fun as we can into the time."</p>
<p>"What is it that you call nicpic?" asked Doctor Gaster.</p>
<p>"It's another of our English institutions for you to study," said Charley.
"It's our version of a <i>f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</i>."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see! That will be very jolly!" acquiesced the Swede.</p>
<p>"There are half a dozen places we might go to," continued the Lieutenant.
"There's the Lover's Leap, or Black Tor, or Beer Ferris Abbey."</p>
<p>"That's the best," said Charley. "Nothing like ruins for a picnic."</p>
<p>"Well the Abbey be it. How far is it?"</p>
<p>"Six miles," said Trevor.</p>
<p>"Seven by the road," remarked the Colonel, with military exactness. "Mrs.
Underwood and I shall stay at home, and the rest of you can fit into the
waggonette. You'll all have to chaperon each other."</p>
<p>I need hardly say that this motion was carried also without a division.</p>
<p>"Well," said Charley, "I'll order the trap to be round in half an hour, so
you'd better all make the best of your time. We'll want salmon, and salad, and
hard-boiled eggs, and liquor, and any number of things. I'll look after the
liquor department. What will you do, Lottie?"</p>
<p>"I'll take charge of the china," I said.</p>
<p>"I'll bring the fish," said Daseby.</p>
<p>"And I the vegetables," added Fan.</p>
<p>"What will you do, Gaster?" asked Charley.</p>
<p>"Truly," said the Swede, in his strange, musical accents, "but little is
left for me to do. I can, however, wait upon the ladies, and I can make what
you call a salad."</p>
<p>"You'll be more popular in the latter capacity than in the former," said I,
laughingly.</p>
<p>"Ah, you say so," he said, turning sharp round upon me, and flushing up to
his flaxen hair. "Yes. Ha! ha! Very good!" And with a discordant laugh, he
strode out of the room.</p>
<p>"I say, Lottie," remonstrated my lover, "you've hurt the fellow's
feelings."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I didn't mean to," I answered. "If you like I'll go after him and
tell him so."</p>
<p>"Oh, leave him alone," said Daseby. "A man with a mug like that has no right
to be so touchy. He'll come round right enough."</p>
<p>It was true that I had not had the slightest intention of offending Gaster,
still I felt pained at having annoyed him.</p>
<p>After I had stowed away the knives and plates into the hamper, I found that
the others were still busy at their various departments. The moment seemed a
favourable one for apologising for my thoughtless remark, so without saying
anything to anyone, I slipped away and ran down the corridor in the direction
of our visitor's room.</p>
<p>I suppose I must have tripped along very lightly, or it may have been the
rich thick matting of Toynby Hall&mdash;certain it is that Mr. Gaster seemed
unconscious of my approach.</p>
<p>His door was open, and as I came up to it and caught sight of him inside,
there was something so strange in his appearance that I paused, literally
petrified for the moment with astonishment.</p>
<p>He had in his hand a small slip from a newspaper which he was reading, and
which seemed to afford him considerable amusement. There was something horrible
too in this mirth of his, for though he writhed his body about as if with
laughter, no sound was emitted from his lips.</p>
<p>His face, which was half-turned towards me, wore an expression upon it which
I had never seen on it before; I can only describe it as one of savage
exultation.</p>
<p>Just as I was recovering myself sufficiently to step forward and knock at
the door, he suddenly, with a last convulsive spasm of merriment, dashed down
the piece of paper upon the table and hurried out by the other door of his
room, which led through the billiard-room to the hall.</p>
<p>I heard his steps dying away in the distance, and peeped once more into his
room.</p>
<p>What could be the joke that had moved this stern man to mirth? Surely some
masterpiece of humour.</p>
<p>Was there ever a woman whose principles were strong enough to overcome her
curiosity?</p>
<p>Looking cautiously round to make sure that the passage was empty, I slipped
into the room and examined the paper which he had been reading.</p>
<p>It was a cutting from an English journal, and had evidently been long
carried about and frequently perused, for it was almost illegible in places.
There was, however, as far as I could see, very little to provoke laughter in
its contents. It ran, as well as I can remember, in this way:&mdash;<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Sudden Death in the Docks.&mdash;The master of the bark-rigged steamer
Olga, from Tromsberg, was found lying dead in his cabin on Wednesday afternoon.
Deceased was, it seems, of a violent disposition, and had had frequent
altercations with the surgeon of the vessel. On this particular day he had been
more than usually offensive, declaring that the surgeon was a necromancer and
worshipper of the devil. The latter retired on deck to avoid further
persecution. Shortly afterwards the steward had occasion to enter the cabin,
and found the captain lying across the table quite dead. Death is attributed to
heart disease, accelerated by excessive passion. An inquest will be held
to-day."<br>
<br></p>
<p>And this was the paragraph which this strange man had regarded as the height
of humour!</p>
<p>I hurried downstairs, astonishment, not un-mixed with repugnance,
predominating in my mind. So just was I, however, that the dark inference which
has so often occurred to me since never for one moment crossed my mind. I
looked upon him as a curious and rather repulsive enigma&mdash;nothing
more.</p>
<p>When I met him at the picnic, all remembrance of my unfortunate speech
seemed to have vanished from his mind. He made himself as agreeable as usual,
and his salad was pronounced a <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>, while his quaint little
Swedish songs and his tales of all climes and countries alternately thrilled
and amused us. It was after luncheon, however, that the conversation turned
upon a subject which seemed to have special charms for his daring mind.</p>
<p>I forget who it was that broached the question of the supernatural. I think
it was Trevor, by some story of a hoax which he had perpetrated at Cambridge.
The story seemed to have a strange effect upon Octavius Gaster, who tossed his
long arms about in impassioned invective as he ridiculed those who dared to
doubt about the existence of the unseen.</p>
<p>"Tell me," he said, standing up in his excitement, "which among you has ever
known what you call an instinct to fail. The wild bird has an instinct which
tells it of the solitary rock upon the so boundless sea on which it may lay its
egg, and is it disappointed? The swallow turns to the south when the winter is
coming, and has its instinct ever led it astray? And shall this instinct which
tells us of the unknown spirits around us, and which pervades every untaught
child and every race so savage, be wrong? I say, never!"</p>
<p>"Go it, Gaster!" cried Charley.</p>
<p>"Take your wind and have another spell," said the sailor.</p>
<p>"No, never," repeated the Swede, disregarding our amusement. "We can see
that matter exists apart from mind; then why should not mind exist apart from
matter?"</p>
<p>"Give it up," said Daseby.</p>
<p>"Have we not proofs of it?" continued Gaster, his gray eyes gleaming with
excitement. "Who that has read Steinberg's book upon spirits, or that by the
eminent American, Madame Crowe, can doubt it? Did not Gustav von Spee meet his
brother Leopold in the streets of Strasbourg, the same brother having been
drowned three months before in the Pacific? Did not Home, the spiritualist, in
open daylight, float above the housetops of Paris? Who has not heard the voices
of the dead around him? I myself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, what of yourself?" asked half a dozen of us, in a breath.</p>
<p>"Bah! it matters nothing," he said, passing his hand over his forehead, and
evidently controlling himself with difficulty. "Truly, our talk is too sad for
such an occasion." And, in spite of all our efforts, we were unable to extract
from Gaster any relation of his own experiences of the supernatural.</p>
<p>It was a merry day. Our approaching dissolution seemed to cause each one to
contribute his utmost to the general amusement. It was settled that after the
coming rifle match Jack was to return to his ship and Trevor to his university.
As to Charley and myself, we were to settle down into a staid respectable
couple.</p>
<p>The match was one of our principal topics of conversation. Shooting had
always been a hobby of Charley's, and he was the captain of the Roborough
company of Devon volunteers, which boasted some of the crack shots of the
county. The match was to be against a picked team of regulars from Plymouth,
and as they were no despicable opponents, the issue was considered doubtful.
Charley had evidently set his heart on winning, and descanted long and loudly
on the chances.</p>
<p>"The range is only a mile from Toynby Hall," he said, "and we'll all drive
over, and you shall see the fun. You'll bring me luck, Louie," he whispered, "I
know you will."</p>
<p>Oh, my poor lost darling, to think of the luck that I brought you!</p>
<p>There was one dark cloud to mar the brightness of that happy day.</p>
<p>I could not hide from myself any longer the fact that my mother's suspicions
were correct, and that Octavius Gaster loved me.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of the excursion his attentions had been most
assiduous, and his eyes hardly ever wandered away from me. There was a manner,
too, in all that he said which spoke louder than words.</p>
<p>I was on thorns lest Charley should perceive it, for I knew his fiery
temper; but the thought of such treachery never entered the honest heart of my
lover.</p>
<p>He did once look up with mild surprise when the Swede insisted on relieving
me of a fern which I was carrying; but the expression faded away into a smile
at what he regarded as Gaster's effusive good-nature. My own feeling in the
matter was pity for the unfortunate foreigner, and sorrow that I should have
been the means of rendering him unhappy.</p>
<p>I thought of the torture it must be fora wild, fierce spirit like his to
have a passion gnawing at his heart which honour and pride would alike prevent
him from ever expressing in words. Alas! I had not counted upon the utter
recklessness and want of principle of the man; but it was not long before I was
undeceived.</p>
<p>There was a little arbour at the bottom of the garden, overgrown with
honeysuckle and ivy, which had long been a favourite haunt of Charley and
myself. It was doubly dear to us from the fact that it was here, on the
occasion of my former visit, that words of love had first passed between
us.</p>
<p>After dinner on the day following the picnic I sauntered down to this little
summer-house, as was my custom. Here I used to wait until Charley, having
finished his cigar with the other gentlemen, would come down and join me.</p>
<p>On that particular evening he seemed to be longer away than usual. I waited
impatiently for his coming, going to the door every now and then to see if
there were any signs if his approach.</p>
<p>I had just sat down again after one of those fruitless excursions, when I
heard the tread of a male foot upon the gravel, and a figure emerged from among
the bushes.</p>
<p>I sprang up with a glad smile, which changed to an expression of
bewilderment, and even fear, when I saw the gaunt, pallid face of Octavius
Caster peering in at me.</p>
<p>There was certainly something about his actions which would have inspired
distrust in the mind of anyone in my position. Instead of greeting me, he
looked up and down the garden, as if to make sure that we were entirely alone.
He then stealthily entered the arbour, and seated himself upon a chair, in such
a position that he was between me and the doorway.</p>
<p>"Do not be afraid," he said, as he noticed my scared expression. "There is
nothing to fear. I do but come that I may have talk with you."</p>
<p>"Have you seen Mr. Pillar?" I asked, trying hard to seem at my ease.</p>
<p>"Ha! Have I seen your Charley?" he answered, with a sneer upon the last
words. "Are you then so anxious that he come? Can no one speak to thee but
Charley, little one?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Gaster," I said, "you are forgetting yourself."</p>
<p>"It is Charley, Charley, ever Charley!" continued the Swede, disregarding my
interruption. "Yes, I have seen Charley. I have told him that you wait upon the
bank of the river, and he has gone thither upon the wings of love."</p>
<p>"Why have you told him this lie?" I asked, still trying not to lose my
self-control.</p>
<p>"That I might see you; that I might speak to you. Do you, then, love him so?
Cannot the thought of glory, and riches, and power, above all that the mind can
conceive, win you from this first maiden fancy of yours? Fly with me,
Charlotte, and all this, and more, shall be yours! Come!"</p>
<p>And he stretched his long arms out in passionate entreaty.</p>
<p>Even at that moment the thought flashed through my mind of how like they
were to the tentacles of some poisonous insect. "You insult me, sir!" I cried,
rising to my feet. "You shall pay heavily for this treatment of an unprotected
girl!"</p>
<p>"Ah, you say it," he cried, "but you mean it not. In your heart so tender
there is pity left for the most miserable of men. Nay, you shall not pass
me&mdash;you shall hear me first!"</p>
<p>"Let me go, sir!"</p>
<p>Nay; you shall not go until you tell me if nothing that I can do may win
your love."</p>
<p>"How dare you speak so?" I almost screamed, losing all my fear in my
indignation. "You, who are the guest of my future husband! Let me tell you,
once and for all, that I had no feeling towards you before save one of
repugnance and contempt, which you have now converted into positive
hatred!"</p>
<p>"And is it so?" he gasped, tottering backwards towards the doorway, and
putting his hand up to his throat as if he found a difficulty in uttering the
words. "And has my love won hatred in return? Ha!" he continued, advancing his
face within a foot of mine as I cowered away from his glassy eyes. "I know it
now. It is this&mdash;it is this!" and he struck the horrible cicatrix on his
face with his clenched hand. "Maids love not such faces as this! I am not
smooth, and brown, and curly like this Charley&mdash;this brainless school-boy;
this human brute who cares but for his sport and his&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let me pass!" I cried, rushing at the door.</p>
<p>"No; you shall not go&mdash;you shall not!" he hissed, pushing me
backwards.</p>
<p>I struggled furiously to escape from his grasp. His long arms seemed to
clasp me like bars of steel. I felt my strength going, and was making one last
despairing effort to shake myself loose, when some irresistible power from
behind tore my persecutor away from me and hurled him backwards on to the
gravel walk.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw Charley's towering figure and square shoulders in the
doorway.</p>
<p>"My poor darling!" he said, catching me in his arms. "Sit here&mdash;here in
the angle. There is no danger now. I shall be with you in a minute."</p>
<p>"Don't Charley, don't!" I murmured, as he turned to leave me. But he was
deaf to my entreaties, and strode out of the arbour. I could not see either him
or his opponent from the position in which he had placed me, but I heard every
word that was spoken. "You villain!" said a voice that I could hardly recognise
as my lover's. "So this is why you put me on a wrong scent?"</p>
<p>"That is why," answered the foreigner, in a tone of easy indifference.</p>
<p>"And this is how you repay our hospitality, you infernal scoundrel!"</p>
<p>"Yes; we amuse ourselves in your so beautiful summer-house."</p>
<p>"We! You are still on my ground and my guest, and I would wish to keep my
hands from you; but, by heavens&mdash;"</p>
<p>Charley was speaking very low and in gasps now.</p>
<p>"Why do you swear? What is it, then?" asked the languid voice of Octavius
Gaster.</p>
<p>"If you dare to couple Miss Underwood's name with this business, and
insinuate that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Insinuate? I insinuate nothing. What I say I say plain for all the world to
hear. I say that this so chaste maiden did herself ask&mdash;"</p>
<p>I heard the sound of a heavy blow, and a great rattling of the gravel.</p>
<p>I was too weak to rise from where I lay, and could only clasp my hands
together and utter a faint scream.</p>
<p>"You cur!" said Charley. "Say as much again, and I'll stop your mouth for
all eternity!"</p>
<p>There was a silence, and then I heard Gaster speaking in a husky, strange
voice.</p>
<p>"You have struck me!" he said; "you have drawn my blood!"</p>
<p>"Yes; I'll strike you again if you show your cursed face within these
grounds. Don't look at me so! You don't suppose your hankey-pankey tricks can
frighten me?"</p>
<p>An indefinable dread came over me as my lover spoke. I staggered to my feet
and looked out at them, leaning against the door-way for support.</p>
<p>Charley was standing erect and defiant, with his young head in the air, like
one who glories in the cause for which he battles.</p>
<p>Octavius Gaster was opposite him, surveying him with pinched lips and a
baleful look in his cruel eyes. The blood was running freely from a deep gash
on his lip, and spotting the front of his green necktie and white waistcoat. He
perceived me the instant I emerged from the arbour.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha!" he cried, with a demoniacal burst of laughter. "She comes! The
bride! She comes! Room for the bride! Oh, happy pair, happy pair!"</p>
<p>And with another fiendish burst of merriment he turned and disappeared over
the crumbling wall of the garden with such rapidity that he was gone before we
had realised what it was that he was about to do.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charley," I said, as my lover came back to my side, "you've hurt
him!"</p>
<p>"Hurt him! I should hope I have! Come, darling, you are frightened and
tired. He did not injure you, did he?"</p>
<p>"No; but I feel rather faint and sick."</p>
<p>"Come, we'll walk slowly to the house together. The rascal! It was cunningly
and deliberately planned, too. He told me he had seen you down by the river,
and I was going down when I met young Stokes, the keeper's son, coming back
from fishing, and he told me that there was nobody there. Somehow, when Stokes
said that, a thousand little things flashed into my mind at once, and I became
in a moment so convinced of Gaster's villainy that I ran as hard as I could to
the arbour."</p>
<p>"Charley," I said, clinging to my lover's arm, "I fear he will injure you in
some way. Did you see the look in his eyes before he leaped the wall?"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Charley. "All these foreigners have a way of scowling and
glaring when they are angry, but it never comes to much."</p>
<p>"Still, I am afraid of him," said I, mournfully, as we went up the steps
together, "and I wish you had not struck him."</p>
<p>"So do I," Charley answered; "for he was our guest, you know, in spite of
his rascality. However, it's done now and it can't be helped, as the cook says
in 'Pickwick,' and really it was more than flesh and blood could stand."</p>
<p>I must run rapidly over the events of the next few days. For me, at least,
it was a period of absolute happiness. With Gaster's departure a cloud seemed
to be lifted off my soul, and a depression which had weighed upon the whole
household completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Once more I was the light-hearted girl that I had been before the
foreigner's arrival. Even the Colonel forgot to mourn over his absence, owing
to the all-absorbing interest in the coming competition in which his son was
engaged.</p>
<p>It was our main subject of conversation and bets were freely offered by the
gentlemen on the success of the Roborough team, though no one was unprincipled
enough to seem to support their antagonists by taking them.</p>
<p>Jack Daseby ran down to Plymouth, and "made a book on the event" with some
officers of the Marines, which he did in such an extraordinary way that we
reckoned that in case of Roborough winning, he would lose seventeen shillings;
while, should the other contingency occur, he would be involved in hopeless
liabilities.</p>
<p>Charley and I had tacitly agreed not to mention the name of Gaster, nor to
allude in any way to what had passed.</p>
<p>On the morning after our scene in the garden, Charley had sent a servant up
to the Swede's room with instructions to pack up any things he might find
there, and leave them at the nearest inn.</p>
<p>It was found, however, that all Gaster's effects had been already removed,
though how and when was a perfect mystery to the servants.</p>
<p>I know of few more attractive spots than the shooting-range at Roborough.
The glen in which it is situated is about half a mile long and perfectly level,
so that the targets were able to range from two to seven hundred yards, the
further ones simply showing as square white dots against the green of the
rising hills behind.</p>
<p>The glen itself is part of the great moor and its sides, sloping gradually
up, lose themselves in the vast rugged expanse. Its symmetrical character
suggested to the imaginative mind that some giant of old had made an excavation
in the moor with a titanic cheese-scoop, but that a single trial had convinced
him of the utter worthlessness of the soil.</p>
<p>He might even be imagined to have dropped the despised sample at the mouth
of the cutting which he had made, for there was a considerable elevation there,
from which the riflemen were to fire, and thither we bent our steps on that
eventful afternoon.</p>
<p>Our opponents had arrived there before us, bringing with them a considerable
number of naval and military officers, while a long line of nondescript
vehicles showed that many of the good citizens of Plymouth had seized the
opportunity of giving their wives and families an outing on the moor.</p>
<p>An enclosure for ladies and distinguished guests had been erected on the top
of the hill, which, with the marquee and refreshment tents, made the scene a
lively one.</p>
<p>The country people had turned out in force, and were excitedly staking their
half-crowns upon their local champions, which were as enthusiastically taken up
by the admirers of the regulars.</p>
<p>Through all this scene of bustle and confusion we were safely conveyed by
Charley, aided by Jack and Trevor, who finally deposited us in a sort of
rudimentary grandstand, from which we could look round at our ease on all that
was going on.</p>
<p>We were soon, however, so absorbed in the glorious view, that we became
utterly unconscious of the betting and pushing and chaff of the crowd in front
of us.</p>
<p>Away to the south we could see the blue smoke of Plymouth curling up into
the calm summer air, while beyond that was the great sea, stretching away to
the horizon, dark and vast, save where some petulant wave dashed it with a
streak of foam, as if rebelling against the great peacefulness of nature.</p>
<p>From the Eddystone to the Start the long rugged line of the Devonshire coast
lay like a map before us.</p>
<p>I was still lost in admiration when Charley's voice broke half-reproachfully
on my ear.</p>
<p>"Why, Lottie," he said, "you don't seem to take a bit of interest in
it!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes I do, dear," I answered. "But the scenery is so pretty, and the sea
is always a weakness of mine. Come and sit here, and tell me all about the
match and how we are to know whether you are winning or losing."</p>
<p>"I've just been explaining it," answered Charley. "But I'll go over it
again."</p>
<p>"Do, like a darling," said I; and settled myself down to mark, learn, and
inwardly digest.</p>
<p>"Well," said Charley, "there are ten men on each side. We shoot alternately;
first, one of our fellows, then one of them, and so on&mdash;you
understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand that."</p>
<p>"First we fire at the two hundred yards range&mdash;those are the targets
nearest of all. We fire five shots each at those. Then we fire five shots at
the ones at five hundred yards&mdash;those middle ones; and then we finish up
by firing at the seven hundred yards range&mdash;you see the target far over
there on the side of the hill. Whoever makes the most points wins. Do you grasp
it now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; that's very simple," I said.</p>
<p>"Do you know what a bull's eye is?" asked my lover. "Some sort of sweetmeat,
isn't it?" I hazarded.</p>
<p>Charley seemed amazed at the extent of my ignorance. "That's the
bull's-eye," he said; "that dark spot in the centre of the target. If you hit
that, it counts five. There is another ring, which you can't see, drawn round
that, and if you get inside of it, it is called a 'centre,' and counts four.
Outside that, again, is called an 'outer,' and only gives you three. You can
tell where the shot has hit, for the marker puts out a coloured disc, and
covers the place."</p>
<p>"Oh, I understand it all now," said I, enthusiastically. "I'll tell you what
I'll do Charley; I'll mark the score on a bit of paper every shot that is
fired, and then I'll always know how Roborough is getting on!"</p>
<p>"You can't do better," he laughed as he strode off to get his men together,
for a warning bell signified that the contest was about to begin.</p>
<p>There was a great waving of flags and shouting before the ground could be
got clear, and then I saw a little cluster of red-coats lying upon the
greensward, while a similar group, in grey, took up their position to the left
of them.</p>
<p>"Pang!" went a rifle-shot, and the blue smoke came curling up from the
grass.</p>
<p>Fanny shrieked, while I gave a cry of delight, for I saw the white disc go
up, which proclaimed a "bull," and the shot had been fired by one of the
Roborough men. My elation was, however, promptly checked by the answering shot
which put down five to the credit of the regulars. The next was also a "bull,"
which was speedily cancelled by another. At the end of the competition at the
short range each side had scored forty-nine out of a possible fifty, and the
question of supremacy was as undecided as ever.</p>
<p>"It's getting exciting," said Charley, lounging over the stand. "We begin
shooting at the five hundred yards in a few minutes."</p>
<p>"Oh, Charley," cried Fanny in high excitement, "don't you go and miss,
whatever you do!"</p>
<p>"I won't if I can help it," responded Charley, cheerfully. "You made a
'bull' every time just now," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, but it's not so easy when you've got your sights up. However, we'll do
our best, and we can't do more. They've got some terribly good long-range men
among them. Come over here, Lottie, for a moment."</p>
<p>"What is it, Charley?" I asked, as he led me away from the others. I could
see by the look in his face that something was troubling him.</p>
<p>"It's that fellow," growled my lover. "What the deuce does he want to come
here for? I hoped we had seen the last of him!"</p>
<p>"What fellow?" I gasped, with a vague apprehension at my heart.</p>
<p>"Why, that infernal Swedish fellow, Gaster!"</p>
<p>I followed the direction of Charley's glance, and there, sure enough,
standing on a little knoll close to the place where the riflemen were lying,
was the tall, angular figure of the foreigner.</p>
<p>He seemed utterly unconscious of the sensation which his singular appearance
and hideous countenance excited among the burly farmers around him; but was
craning his long neck about, this way and that, as if in search of
somebody.</p>
<p>As we watched him, his eye suddenly rested upon us, and it seemed to me
that, even at that distance, I could see a spasm of hatred and triumph pass
over his livid features.</p>
<p>A strange foreboding came over me, and I seized my lover's hand in both my
own.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charley," I cried, "don't&mdash;don't go back to the shooting! Say you
are ill&mdash;make some excuse, and come away!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, lass!" said he, laughing heartily at my terror. "Why, what in the
world are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>"Of him!" I answered.</p>
<p>"Don't be so silly, dear. One would think he was a demi-god to hear the way
in which you talk of him. But there! that's the bell, and I must be off."</p>
<p>"Well, promise, at least, that you will not go near him?" I cried, following
Charley.</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;all right!" said he.</p>
<p>And I had to be content with that small concession.</p>
<p>The contest at the five hundred yards range was a close and exciting one.
Roborough led by a couple of points for some time, until a series of "bulls" by
one of the crack marksmen of their opponents turned the tables upon them.</p>
<p>At the end of it was found that the volunteers were three points to the
bad&mdash;a result which was hailed by cheers from the Plymouth contingent and
by long faces and black looks among the dwellers on the moor.</p>
<p>During the whole of this competition Octavius Gaster had remained perfectly
still and motionless upon the top of the knoll on which he had originally taken
up his position.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that he knew little of what was going on, for his face was
turned away from the marksmen, and he appeared to be gazing into the
distance.</p>
<p>Once I caught sight of his profile, and thought that his lips were moving
rapidly as if in prayer, or it may have been the shimmer of the hot air of the
almost Indian summer which deceived me. It was, however, my impression at the
time.</p>
<p>And now came the competition at the longest range of all, which was to
decide the match.</p>
<p>The Roborough men settled down steadily to their task of making up the lost
ground; while the regulars seemed determined not to throw away a chance by
over-confidence.</p>
<p>As shot after shot was fired, the excitement of the spectators became so
great that they crowded round the marksmen, cheering enthusiastically at every
"bull."</p>
<p>We ourselves were so far affected by the general contagion that we left our
harbour of refuge, and submitted meekly to the pushing and rough ways of the
mob, in order to obtain a nearer view of the champions and their doings.</p>
<p>The military stood at seventeen when the volunteers were at sixteen, and
great was the despondency of the rustics.</p>
<p>Things looked brighter, however, when the two sides tied at twenty-four, and
brighter still when the steady shooting of the local team raised their score to
thirty-two against thirty of their opponents.</p>
<p>There were still, however, the three points which had been lost at the last
range to be made up for.</p>
<p>Slowly the score rose, and desperate were the efforts of both parties to
pull off the victory.</p>
<p>Finally, a thrill ran through the crowd when it was known that the last
red-coat had fired, while one volunteer was still left, and that the soldiers
were leading by four points.</p>
<p>Even <i>our</i> unsportsman-like minds were worked into a state of
all-absorbing excitement by the nature of the crisis which now presented
itself.</p>
<p>If the last representative of our little town could but hit the bull's-eye
the match was won.</p>
<p>The silver cup, the glory, the money of our adherents, all depended upon
that single shot.</p>
<p>The reader will imagine that my interest was by no means lessened when, by
dint of craning my neck and standing on tiptoe, I caught sight of my Charley
coolly shoving a cartridge into his rifle, and realised that it was upon his
skill that the honour of Roborough depended.</p>
<p>It was this, I think, which lent me strength to push my way so vigorously
through the crowd that I found myself almost in the first row and commanding an
excellent view of the proceedings.</p>
<p>There were two gigantic farmers on each side of me, and while we were
waiting for the decisive shot to be fired, I could not help listening to the
conversation, which they carried on in broad Devon, over my head.</p>
<p>"Mun's a rare ugly 'un," said one.</p>
<p>"He is that," cordially assented the other.</p>
<p>"See to mun's een?"</p>
<p>"Eh, Jock; see to mun's moo', rayther!&mdash;Blessed if he bean't foamin'
like Farmer Watson's dog&mdash;t' bull pup whot died mad o' the
hydropathics."</p>
<p>I turned round to see the favoured object of these flattering comments, and
my eyes fell upon Doctor Octavius Gaster, whose presence I had entirely
forgotten in my excitement.</p>
<p>His face was turned towards me; but he evidently did not see me, for his
eyes were bent with unswerving persistence upon a point midway apparently
between the distant targets and himself.</p>
<p>I have never seen anything to compare with the extraordinary concentration
of that stare, which had the effect of making his eyeballs appear gorged and
prominent, while the pupils were contracted to the finest possible point.</p>
<p>Perspiration was running freely down his long, cadaverous face, and, as the
farmer had remarked, there were some traces of foam at the corners of his
mouth. The jaw was locked, as if with some fierce effort of the will which
demanded all the energy of his soul.</p>
<p>To my dying day that hideous countenance shall never fade from my
remembrance nor cease to haunt me in my dreams. I shuddered, and turned away my
head in the vain hope that perhaps the honest farmer might be right, and mental
disease be the cause of all the vagaries of this extraordinary man.</p>
<p>A great stillness fell upon the whole crowd as Charley, having loaded his
rifle, snapped up the breech cheerily, and proceeded to lie down in his
appointed place.</p>
<p>"That's right, Mr. Charles, sir&mdash;that's right!" I heard old McIntosh,
the volunteer sergeant, whisper as I passed. "A cool head and a steady hand,
that's what does the trick, sir!"</p>
<p>My lover smiled round at the gray-headed soldier as he lay down upon the
grass, and then proceeded to look along the sight of his rifle amid a silence
in which the faint rustling of the breeze among the blades of grass was
distinctly audible.</p>
<p>For more than a minute he hung upon his aim. His finger seemed to press the
trigger, and every eye was fixed upon the distant target, when suddenly,
instead of firing, the rifleman staggered up to his knees, leaving his weapon
upon the ground.</p>
<p>To the surprise of everyone, his face was deadly pale, and perspiration was
standing on his brow.</p>
<p>"I say, McIntosh," he said, in a strange, gasping voice, "is there anybody
standing between the target and me?"</p>
<p>"Between, sir? No, not a soul, sir," answered the astonished sergeant.</p>
<p>"There, man, there!" cried Charley, with fierce energy, seizing him by the
arm, and pointing in the direction of the target, "Don't you see him there,
standing right in the line of fire?"</p>
<p>"There's no one there!" shouted half a dozen voices.</p>
<p>"No one there? Well, it must have been my imagination," said Charley,
passing his hand slowly over his forehead. "Yet I could have sworn&mdash;Here,
give me the rifle!"</p>
<p>He lay down again, and having settled himself into position, raised his
weapon slowly to his eye. He had hardly looked along the barrel before he
sprang up again with a loud cry.</p>
<p>"There!" he cried; "I tell you I see it! A man dressed in volunteer uniform,
and very like myself&mdash;the image of myself. Is this a conspiracy?" he
continued, turning fiercely on the crowd. "Do you tell me none of you see a man
resembling myself walking from that target, and not two hundred yards from me
as I speak?"</p>
<p>I should have flown to Charley's side had I not known how he hated feminine
interference, and anything approaching to a scene. I could only listen silently
to his strange wild words.</p>
<p>"I protest against this!" said an officer coming forward. "This gentleman
must really either take his shot, or we shall remove our men off the field and
claim the victory."</p>
<p>"But I'll shoot <i>him!</i>" gasped poor Charley.</p>
<p>"Humbug!"</p>
<p>"Rubbish!"</p>
<p>"Shoot him, then!" growled half a score of masculine voices.</p>
<p>"The fact is," lisped one of the military men in front of me to another,
"the young fellow's nerves ar'n't quite equal to the occasion, and he feels it,
and is trying to back out."</p>
<p>The imbecile young lieutenant little knew at this point how a feminine hand
was longing to stretch forth and deal him a sounding box on the ears.</p>
<p>"It's Martell's three-star brandy, that's what it is," whispered the other.
"The 'devils,' don't you know. I've had 'em myself, and know a case when I see
it."</p>
<p>This remark was too recondite for my understanding, or the speaker would
have run the same risk as his predecessor.</p>
<p>"Well, are you going to shoot or not?" cried several voices.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll shoot," groaned Charley&mdash;"I'll shoot <i>him</i> through!
It's murder&mdash;sheer <i>murder</i>!"</p>
<p>I shall never forget the haggard look which he cast round at the crowd. "I'm
aiming <i>through</i> him, McIntosh," he murmured, as he lay down on the grass
and raised the gun for the third time to his shoulder.</p>
<p>There was one moment of suspense, a spurt of flame, the crack of a rifle,
and a cheer which echoed across the moor, and might have been heard in the
distant village.</p>
<p>"Well done, lad&mdash;well done!" shouted a hundred honest Devonshire
voices, as the little white disc came out from behind the marker's shield and
obliterated the dark "bull" for the moment, proclaiming that the match was
won.</p>
<p>"Well done, lad! It's Maister Pillar, of Toynby Hall. Here, let's gie mun a
lift, carry mun home, for the honour o' Roborough. Come on, lads! There mun is
on the grass. Wake up, Sergeant McIntosh. What be the matter with thee? Eh?
What?"</p>
<p>A deadly stillness came over the crowd, and then a low incredulous murmur,
changing to one of pity, with whispers of "leave her alone, poor
lass&mdash;leave her to hersel'!"&mdash;and then there was silence again, save
for the moaning of a woman, and her short, quick cries of despair.</p>
<p>For, reader, my Charley, my beautiful, brave Charley, was lying cold and
dead upon the ground, with the rifle still clenched in his stiffening
fingers.</p>
<p>I heard kind words of sympathy. I heard Lieutenant Daseby's voice, broken
with grief, begging me to control my sorrow, and felt his hand, as he gently
raised me from my poor boy's body. This I can remember, and nothing more, until
my recovery from my illness, when I found myself in the sick-room at Toynby
Hall, and learned that three restless, delirious weeks had passed since that
terrible day.</p>
<p>Stay!&mdash;do I remember nothing else?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I do. Sometimes I think I can recall a lucid interval in
the midst of my wanderings. I seem to have a dim recollection of seeing my good
nurse go out of the room&mdash;of seeing a gaunt, bloodless face peering in
through the half-open window, and of hearing a voice which said, "I have dealt
with thy so beautiful lover, and I have yet to deal with thee." The words come
back to me with a familiar ring, as if they had sounded in my ears before, and
yet it may have been but a dream.</p>
<p>"And this is all!" you say. "It is for this that a hysterical woman hunts
down a harmlesssavant in the advertisement columns of the newspapers! On this
shallow evidence she hints at crimes of the most monstrous description!"</p>
<p>Well, I cannot expect that these things should strike you as they struck me.
I can but say that if I were upon a bridge with Octavius Gaster standing at one
end, and the most merciless tiger that ever prowled in an Indian jungle at the
other, I should fly to the wild beast for protection.</p>
<p>For me, my life is broken and blasted. I care not how soon it may end, but
if my words shall keep this man out of one honest household, I have not written
in vain.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Within a fortnight after writing this narrative, my poor daughter
disappeared. All search has failed to find her. A porter at the railway station
has deposed to having seen a young lady resembling her description get into a
first-class carriage with a tall, thin gentleman. It is, however, too
ridiculous to suppose that she can have eloped after her recent grief, and
without my having had any suspicions. The detectives are, however, working out
the clue.&mdash;EMILY UNDERWOOD</p>

OR, MY LECTURE ON DYNAMITE</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Boy's Own Paper</i>, Christmas edition, December
1883<br>

<hr>
<br>
<p>It has often seemed to me to be a very strange and curious thing that danger
and trouble should follow those who are most anxious to lead a quiet and
uneventful life. I myself have been such a one, and I find on looking back that
it was in those very periods of my existence which might have been most
confidently reckoned on as peaceful that some unexpected adventure has befallen
me, like the thunder-bolt from an unclouded sky which shook the nerves of old
Horace. Possibly my experience differs from that of other men, and I may have
been especially unfortunate. If so, there is the more reason why I should mourn
over my exceptional lot, and record it for the benefit of those more happily
circumstanced.</p>
<p>Just compare my life with that of Leopold Walderich, and you will see what I
complain of. We both come from Mulhausen, in Baden, and that is why I single
him out as an example, though many others would do as well. He was a man who
professed to be fond of adventure. Now listen to what occurred. We went to
Heidelberg University together. I was quiet, studious, and unassuming; he was
impetuous, reckless, and idle. For three years he reveled in every sort of
riot, while I frequented the laboratories, and rarely deserted my books save
for a hurried walk into the country when a pain in my head and ringing in my
ears warned me that I was trifling with my constitution.</p>
<p>Yet during that period his life was comparatively uneventful, while my whole
existence was a series of hairbreadth perils and escapes. I damaged my eyesight
and nearly choked myself by the evolution of a poisonous gas. I swallowed a
trichina in my ham, and was prostrated for weeks. I was hurled out of a second
floor window by an English lunatic because I ventured to quote the solemn and
serious passage in Schoppheim's Weltgeschichte which proves Waterloo to have
been a purely Prussian victory, and throws grave doubts on the presence of any
British force nearer than Brussels! Twice I was nearly drowned, and once I
should have been precipitated from the parapet of the schloss but for the
assistance of this same Englishman. These are a few of the incidents which
occurred to me while endeavouring to read in seclusion for my degree.</p>
<p>Even in smaller matters this luck of mine held good. I can well remember,
for example, that on one occasion the wilder spirits of the Badischer Corps
ventured upon an unusually hare-brained escapade. There was a farmer about a
couple of miles from the town whose name was Nicholas Bodeck. This man had made
himself obnoxious to the students, and they determined to play a prank upon him
in return. An enormous number of little caps were accordingly made with the
colours of the corps upon them, and the conspirators invaded his premises in
the middle of the night and gummed them upon the heads of all the fowls.</p>
<p>They certainly had a very comical effect, as I had an opportunity of
judging, for I happened to pass that way in the morning. I supposed that
Walderich and his friends carried out their little joke for excitement, knowing
the farmer to be a resolute man. They got no excitement from it, however; it
was I who got that. Activity was never my strong point, but certainly I ran
those two miles that morning with incredible speed&mdash;and so did the five
men with pitch- forks who ran behind me!</p>
<p>These things may seem trivial, but, as you say in England, a straw shows
which way the wind blows, and these were only indications of what was to
come.</p>
<p>I took my degree in medicine, and found myself Herr Doctor Otto von Spee. I
then graduated in science, receiving much applause for my thesis, "On the
Explosive Compounds of the Tri-methyl Series". I was quoted as an authority in
works of science, and my professors prophesied that a great career lay before
me. My studies, however, were suddenly put an end to by the outbreak of the
great war with France.</p>
<p>Waldenich volunteered into one of the crack regiments, fought in nearly
every engagement, covered himself with glory, and came back unhurt to be
decorated with the cross for valour. I was stationed in an ambulance which
never even crossed the frontier, yet I succeeded in breaking my arm by tumbling
over a stretcher, and in contracting erysipelas from one of the few wounds
which came under my care. I got no medal or cross, and went back quietly to
Berlin after it was all over, and there I settled as privat docent of chemistry
and physics.</p>
<p>You will naturally ask what all this has to do with my Christmas story. You
shall see in time that it is necessary I should tell you this, in order that
you may appreciate that crowning event in my long list of misfortunes. You must
remember also that I am a German and therefore somewhat long-winded perhaps, as
my nation has the reputation of being. I have often admired the dashing,
rattling manner of English story-tellers, but I fear if I were to attempt to
imitate this it would be as if one of our own ponderous old Mulhausen storks
were to adopt the pretty graceful airs of your Christmas robins. You shall hear
in time all that I have to say about my Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>After I had settled in Berlin I endeavoured to combine the private practice
of medicine with my labours as a privat docent, which corresponds to what you
call a "coach" in England. For some years I pursued this plan, but I found that
my practice, being largely among the lower classes, favoured my unfortunate
propensity for getting into trouble, and I determined to abandon it.</p>
<p>I took a secluded house, therefore, in a quiet quarter of the city, and
there I gave myself up to scientific research, pursuing principally the same
train of investigation which had originally attracted me&mdash;namely, the
chemistry of explosive compounds.</p>
<p>My expenses were small, and all the money which I could spare was laid out
on scientific instruments and mechanical contrivances of different sorts. Soon
I had a snug little laboratory which, if not as pretentious as that at
Heidelberg, was quite as well fitted to supply my wants. It is true that the
neighbours grumbled, and that Gretchen, my housekeeper, had to be quieted with
a five-mark piece, after having been blown up three separate times, and blown
down once while engaged in fixing an electric wire upon the summit of an
outhouse. These little matters, however, were easily settled, and I found my
life rapidly assuming a peaceful complexion, of which I had long despaired.</p>
<p>I was happy&mdash;and what is more I was becoming famous. My "Remarks on
Cacodyl" in the "Monthly Archives of Science" created no small sensation, and
Herr Raubenthal of Bonn characterised them as, "meisterlich," though dissenting
from many of my deductions. I was enabled, however, in a later contribution to
the same journal to recount certain experiments which were sufficient to
convince that eminent savant that my view of the matter was the correct
one.</p>
<p>After this victory I was universally recognised as an authority in my own
special branch, and as one of the foremost living workers at explosives. The
Government appointed me to the torpedo commission at Kiel, and many other
honours were bestowed upon me. One of the consequences of this sudden accession
of celebrity was that I found myself in great request as a lecturer, both at
scientific gatherings and at those meetings for the education of the people
which have become so common in the metropolis. By these means my name got into
the daily papers as one learned in such matters, and to this it is that I
ascribe the events which I am about to narrate.</p>
<p>It was a raw windy Christmas Eve. The sleet pattered against the window
panes, and the blast howled among the skeleton branches of the gaunt
poplar-trees in my garden. There were few people in the street, and those few
had their coats buttoned up, and their chins upon their breasts, and hurried
rapidly homewards, staggering along against the force of the storm. Even the
big policeman outside had ceased to clank up and down, and was crouching in a
doorway for protection.</p>
<p>Many a lonely man might have felt uncomfortable upon such a night, but I was
too interested in my work to have time for any sympathy with the state of the
weather. A submarine mine was engaging my attention, and in a leaden tank in
front of me I had stuck a small pellet of my new explosive. The problem was how
far its destructive capacities would be modified by the action of the water.
The matter was too important to allow me to feel despondent. Besides, one of
Gretchen's lovers was in the kitchen, and his gruff expressions of
satisfaction, whether with her charms or my beer, or both, were sufficiently
audible to banish any suspicion of loneliness.</p>
<p>I was raising my battery on to the table, and was connecting the wires
carefully so as to explode the charge, when I heard a short, quick step outside
the window, and immediately afterwards a loud knock at the outer door.</p>
<p>Now I very seldom had a call from any of my limited number of acquaintances,
and certainly never upon such a night as this. I was astonished for a moment;
then concluding that it was a visitor of Gretchen's, I continued to work at my
apparatus.</p>
<p>To my very great surprise, after Gretchen had opened the door there was some
muttering in the hall, and then a quiet tap at the entrance of my sanctum,
followed by the appearance of a tall lady whom I could vow that I had never
seen in my life before.</p>
<p>Her face was covered by a thick dark veil, and her dress was of the same
sombre colour, so that I concluded her to be a widow. She walked in with a
decisive energetic step, and after glancing round, seated herself quietly upon
the sofa between the voltaic pile and my stand of reagents&mdash;all this
without saying a word, or apparently taking the slightest notice of my
presence.</p>
<p>"Good evening, madam," I remarked, when I had somehow recovered my
composure.</p>
<p>"Would you do me a favour, doctor?" she replied, brusquely, in a harsh
voice, which harmonised with her gaunt angular figure.</p>
<p>"Surely, madam," I answered, in my most elegant manner. I remember a girl at
Heidelberg used to say that I had a very fascinating way sometimes. Of course
it was only a joke, but still something must have put it into her head or she
would never have said it. "What can I do for you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You can send away that servant of yours, who is listening at the door."</p>
<p>At this moment, before I could move hand or foot, there were a succession of
tremendous bumps, followed by a terrible crash and a prolonged scream. It was
evident that my unhappy domestic had fallen downstairs in her attempt to avoid
detection. I was about to rise, but the stranger arrested me.</p>
<p>"Never mind now," she said. "We can proceed to business."</p>
<p>I bowed my head to show that I was all attention.</p>
<p>The fact is, doctor," she continued, "that I wish you to come back with me
and give me your opinion upon a case."</p>
<p>"My dear madam," I answered, "I have long retired from the practice of my
profession. If you go down the street, however, you will see the surgery of
Doctor Benger, who is a most competent man, and who will be happy to accompany
you."</p>
<p>"No, no," cried my companion, in great distress. "You or no one! You or no
one! My poor dear husband cried out as I left him that Otto von Spee was the
only man who could bring him back from the tomb. They will all be broken-
hearted if I return without you. Besides, the professors at the hospital said
that you were the only one in Europe who would be capable of dealing with
it."</p>
<p>Now, devoted as I was to scientific research, I had always had a conviction
in my mind that I had the makings in me of a first-class practical physician.
It was inexpressibly consoling to hear that the heads of the profession had
endorsed this opinion by referring a curious case to my judgment. The more I
thought of it, however, the more extraordinary did it seem. "Are you sure?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, quite sure."</p>
<p>"But I am a specialist&mdash;a student of explosives. I have had very little
experience in practice. What is the matter with your husband?"</p>
<p>"He has a tumour."</p>
<p>"A tumour? I know nothing of tumours."</p>
<p>"Oh come, dear Doctor von Spee; come and look at it!" implored the female,
producing a handkerchief from her pocket and beginning to sob convulsively.</p>
<p>It was too much. I had lived a secluded life, and had never before seen a
female in distress.</p>
<p>"Madam," I said, "I shall be happy to accompany you."</p>
<p>I regretted that promise the moment it was uttered. There was a wild howl of
wind in the chimney which reminded me of the inclemency of the night. However,
my word was pledged, and there was no possibility of escape. I left the room
with as cheefful an aspect as possible, while Gretchen wrapped a shawl round my
neck and muffled me up to the best of her ability.</p>
<p>What could there be about this tumour, I wondered, which had induced the
learned surgeons to refer it to my judgment&mdash;I who was rather an
artillerist than a physician? Could it be that the growth was of such stony
hardness that no knife could remove it, and that explosives were necessary for
extraction? The idea was so comical that I could scarce refrain from
laughing.</p>
<p>"Now, madam," I said re-entering the study, "I am at your disposal." As I
spoke I knocked against the electric machine, causing a slight transmission of
the current along the wires, so that the submarine mine exploded with a crash,
blowing a little column of water into the air. Accustomed as I was to such
accidents, I confess that I was considerably startled by the suddenness of the
occurrence. My companion, however, sat perfectly impassive upon the sofa, and
then rose without the slightest sign of surprise or emotion, and walked out of
the room.</p>
<p>"She has the nerves of a grenadier," I mentally ejaculated, as I followed
her into the street.</p>
<p>"Is it far?" I asked, as we started off through the storm.</p>
<p>"Not very far," she answered; "and I took the liberty of bringing a cab for
you, for fear Herr Doctor might catch cold. Ah, here it comes."</p>
<p>As she spoke, a closed carriage dashed along the road, and pulled up beside
us.</p>
<p>"Have you got Otto von Spee?" asked a sallow-faced man, letting down the
window and protruding his head.</p>
<p>"Yes, here he is."</p>
<p>"Then shove him in."</p>
<p>For the moment I was inclined to regard the expression as a playful figure
of speech, but my companion soon dispelled the delusion by seizing me by the
collar and hurling me, with what seemed superhuman strength, into the vehicle.
I fell upon the floor, and was dragged on to a seat by the man, while the other
sprang in, slammed the door, and the horses dashed off at a furious gallop.</p>
<p>I lay back in a state of bewilderment, hardly able to realise what had
occurred. It was pitch dark inside the carriage, but I could hear my two
companions conversing in low whispers. Once I attempted to expostulate and
demand an explanation of their conduct, but a threatening growl, and a rough
hand placed over my mouth, warned me to be silent. I was neither a wealthy man
nor particularly well connected, nor was I a politician. What then, could be
the object of these people in kidnapping me in such an elaborate fashion? The
more I pondered over it, the more mysterious did it seem.</p>
<p>Once we halted for a moment, and a third man got into the carriage, who also
inquired anxiously whether Otto von Spee had been secured, and expressed his
satisfaction on being answered in the affirmative. After this stoppage we
rattled along even more quickly than before, the vehicle rocking from side to
side with the velocity, and the clatter of the horses hoofs sounding above the
howling of the gale. It seemed to me that we must have passed through every
street in Berlin before, with a sudden jar, the coachman pulled up, and my
captors intimated that I was to descend.</p>
<p>I had hardly time to look about me and realise the fact that I was in a
narrow street in some low quarter of the city. A door opened in front of us,
and the two men led me through it, while the herculean female followed us,
effectually cutting off any hopes of escape.</p>
<p>We were in a long passage or corridor, feebly illuminated by a couple of
flickering lamps, whose yellow glare seemed to intensity the darkness around
them. After walking about twenty metres or more we came to a massive door,
blocking our passage. One of my guardians struck it a blow with a stick which
he carried in his hand, when it reverberated with a metallic clang, and swung
open, closing with a snap behind us.</p>
<p>At this point I ventured to stop and expostulate with my companions once
again. My only answer, however, was a shove from the individual behind me,
which shot me through a half-opened door into a comfortable little chamber
beyond. My captors followed in a more leisurely manner, and after turning the
lock, they proceeded to seat themselves, motioning to me that I should do the
same.</p>
<p>The room in which I found myself was small, but elegantly furnished. A fire
was sparkling in the grate, and the bright colours of the handsome suite of
furniture and variegated carpet helped to give it a cheering aspect. The
pictures on the walls, however, went far towards neutralising this effect. They
were very numerous, but every one of them treated of some unpleasant or
murderous passage of history. Many of them were so distant that I was unable to
decipher the inscriptions. To a scholar like myself, however, the majority were
able to tell their own story. There was the lunatic Schtaps in the garden,
making his attempt upon the life of the First Napoleon. Above it was a sketch
of Orsini with his cowardly bomb, waiting silently among the loungers at the
opera. A statuette of Ravaillac was placed upon a pedestal in the corner, while
a large oil-painting of the strangling of the unhappy Emperor Paul in his
bedchamber occupied the whole of one wall of the apartment.</p>
<p>These things did not tend to raise my spirits, and the appearance of my
three companions was still less calculated to do so. I had several times
doubted the sex of the individual who had seduced me from my comfortable home,
but the veil had now been removed and revealed a dark moustache and sunburnt
countenance, with a pair of searching, sinister eyes, which seemed to look into
my very soul. Of the others, one was gaunt and cadaverous, the other
insignificant- looking, with a straggling beard and unhealthy complexion.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry, Doctor von Spee, to be reduced to this necessity," said
the last-mentioned individual, "but unhappily we had no other method of
securing the pleasure of your society."</p>
<p>I bowed&mdash;a little sulkily, I am afraid.</p>
<p>"I must apologise for any little liberties I have taken, above all for
having deprived you of the satisfaction of beholding my husbands remarkable
tumour," said my original acquaintance.</p>
<p>I thought of the manner in which he had bundled me about like an empty
portmanteau, and my bow was even more sulky than before.</p>
<p>"I trust, gentlemen," I remarked, "that since your practical joke has been
so admirably carried out, you will now permit me to return to the studies which
you have interrupted."</p>
<p>"Not so fast, Herr Doctor&mdash;not so fast," said the tall man, rising to
his feet. "We have a little duty which you shall pefform before you leave us.
It is nothing more nor less than to give a few inquirers into the truth a
lesson upon your own special subject. Might I beg you to step in this
direction?"</p>
<p>He walked over to a side door, painted of the same colour as the paper on
the wall, and held it persuasively open. Resistance was useless, as the other
confederates had also risen, and were standing on either side of me. I yielded
to circumstances, and walked out as directed.</p>
<p>We passed down a second passage, rather shorter than the first, and much
more brilliantly illuminated. At the end of it a heavy velvet curtain was hung,
which covered a green baize folding-door. This was swung open, and I found
myself, to my astonishment, in a large room in which a considerable number of
people were assembled. They were arranged in long rows, and sat so as to face a
raised platform at one end of the apartment, on which was a single chair, with
a small round table, littered with a number of objects.</p>
<p>My companions ushered me in, and our entrance was greeted with considerable
applause. It was clear that we had been awaited, for there was a general
movement of expectation throughout the assembly. Glancing round, I could see
that the majority of the company were dressed as artisans or labourers. There
were some, however, who were respectably and even fashionably attired, and a
few whose blue coats and gilt shoulder-bands proclaimed them to be officers in
the army. Their nationalities seemed almost as varied as their occupations. I
could distinguish the dolichocephalic head of the Teuton, the round, curl-
covered cranium of the Celt, and the prognathous jaw and savage features of the
Slav. I could almost have imagined myself looking into one of the cabinets of
casts in my friend Landerstein's anthropological museum.</p>
<p>However, I had not much time for wonder or reflection. One of my guardians
led me across the room, and I found myself standing at the table, which I have
already mentioned as being situated upon a raised dais. My appearance in this
situation was the signal for a fresh outburst of applause, which, with clapping
of hands and drumming of sticks upon the floor, lasted for some considerable
time.</p>
<p>When it had subsided, the gaunt man who had come with me in the carriage
walked up to the dais and addressed a few words to the audience. "Gentlemen,"
he said, "you will perceive that the committee have succeeded in keeping their
promise and of bringing the celebrated&mdash;("beruhmte" was the word he
used)&mdash; Doctor Otto von Spee to address you." Here there was renewed
applause.</p>
<p>"Doctor," he continued, turning to me, "I think a few words of public
explanation will not be amiss in this matter. You are well known as an
authority upon explosives. Now all these gentlemen and myself have an interest
in this subject, and would gladly listen to your views upon it. We are
particularly anxious that you should give us clear and precise directions as to
the method of preparing dynamite, guncotton, and other such substances, as we
sometimes have a little difficulty in obtaining such things for our
experiments. You shall also tell us about the effect of temperature, water, and
other agents upon these substances, the best method of storing them, and the
way of using them to the greatest advantage. For our part, we shall listen
attentively and treat you well, always provided that you make no attempt to
summon aid or to escape. Should you be so ill-advised as to do
either"&mdash;here he slapped his pocket&mdash;"you shall become as intimately
acquainted with projectiles as you now are with explosives." I cannot say that
this struck me as a good joke, but it seemed to meet considerable favour among
the audience.</p>
<p>"I wish to add a few words to the remarks of our learned president," said a
small man, rising up from among the first line of the company. "I have placed
upon the table such materials as I could lay my hands upon in order that the
learned doctor may be able to illustrate his discourse by any experiments which
he may think appropriate. I may warn him, in conclusion, to speak somewhat
slowly and distinctly, as some of his hearers are but imperfectly acquainted
with the German language."</p>
<p>Here was my old luck again with a vengeance! At a time when Walderich and
every gay dog in Berlin were snoring peacefully in their beds, I&mdash;I,
Doctor Otto von Spee, the modest man of science&mdash;was lecturing to a
murderous secret organisation&mdash;for my audience could be nothing
else&mdash;and teaching them to forge the weapons with which they were to
attack society and everything which should be treasured and revered. And on
such a night as this too! Should I, then, put it in their power to convert a
house into an arsenal, to destroy the stability of the Fatherland, and even
perhaps attempt the life of my beloved kaiser? Never! I swore
it&mdash;never!</p>
<p>Most small men who wear spectacles are obstinate. I am a small man with
spectacles, and I was no exception to the rule. I clenched my teeth, and felt
that ruat ccelum, never a word should pass my lips that might be of any help to
them. I should not refuse to lecture, but I was determined to avoid those very
points upon which they desired to be instructed.</p>
<p>I was not allowed much time for meditation. An ominous murmur among the
audience, and a shuffling of feet upon the floor, betokened their impatience. I
must say, however, that many of them seemed actuated with rather kindly
feelings towards me, more particularly one stoutish individual of a well-marked
Celtic type, who, not content with smiling all over his florid countenance,
waved his arms occasionally in motions intended to indicate sympathy and
inspire confidence.</p>
<p>I stepped up to the table, which was covered all over with such objects as
were thought to have a bearing upon my subject. Some of them were rather
curious&mdash;a lump of salt, an iron teapot, part of the broken axle of a
wheel, and a large pair of kitchen bellows. Others were more appropriate. There
was a piece of guncotton which could not have weighed less than a couple of
pounds, coarse cotton, starch, various acids, a Bunsen burner, tubes of
fulminate of mercury, some dynamite powder, and a large pitcher of water. There
was also a carafe and tumbler for my own use, should I feel so disposed.</p>
<p>"Meine herren," I began, with perhaps a slight quaver in my voice, "we have
met here tonight for the purpose of studying dynamite and other explosives." It
flowed naturally from my lips, as it was the stereotyped formula with which my
discourses at the Educationische Instirut were usually commenced. My audience
seemed, however, to be much amused, and the florid Celt was convulsed with
admiration and merriment. Even the forbidding-looking man who had been referred
to as the president condescended to smile his approval and remark that I
adapted myself readily to my circumstances.</p>
<p>"These substances," I continued, "are powerful agents either for good or for
evil. For good when used for the quarrying of rocks, the removal of impediments
to navigation, or the destruction of houses during a conflagration. For
evil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think you had better pass on to something more practical," said the
president, grimly.</p>
<p>"On dipping starch into certain liquids," I resumed, "it is found to assume
an explosive property. The attention of a learned countryman of ours, the
chemist Schonbein, was directed to the fact, and he found that by treating
cotton in a similar manner the effect was enormously increased. Schonbein was a
man respected among his contemporaries, devoted to his country, and
loyal&mdash; "</p>
<p>"Pass on!" said the president.</p>
<p>"After being treated in this fashion," I continued, "the cotton is found to
gain eighty per cent. in weight. This substance is more susceptible to an
increase of temperature than gunpowder, igniting at 300&ordm; Fahrenheit, while
the latter requires a heat of 560&ordm; for its explosion. Guncotton can also
be exploded by a blow, which is not the case with a mixture of carbon, sulphur,
and saltpetre."</p>
<p>Here there were some angry murmurs among the company, and the president
interrupted me for the third time.</p>
<p>"These gentlemen complain," he said, "that you have left no definite
impression upon their minds as to how the substance is manufactured. Perhaps
you will kindly dwell more fully upon the point."</p>
<p>"I have no further remarks to make," I said.</p>
<p>There was another threatening murmur, and the president took something out
of the pocket of his coat, and toyed with it negligently. "I think you had
better reconsider your decision," he remarked.</p>
<p>Most little men with spectacles are timid. Again I was no exception to the
rule. I am ashamed to say that the peril of my Fatherland and even of my kaiser
suddenly vanished from my recollection. I only realised that I, Otto von Spee,
was standing upon the brink of eternity. After all, I argued, they could find
out for themselves in any book upon chemistry. Why should my valuable life be
sacrificed for such a trifle? I resumed my lecture with somewhat undignified
haste.</p>
<p>"Guncotton is manufactured by steeping cotton waste in nitric acid. The
explosion is caused by the oxygen of the acid combining with the carbon of the
wool. It should be well cleaned with water after manufacture, otherwise the
superfluous nitric acid acts directly upon the wool, charring it and gradually
reducing it to a gummy mass. During this process heat is often evolved
sufficient to explode the cotton, so that it is a dangerous matter to neglect
the cleaning. After this a little sulphuric acid may be used to get rid of the
moisture, when the substance is ready for use."</p>
<p>There was considerable applause at this point of my discourse, several of
the audience taking notes of my remarks.</p>
<p>While I had been speaking I had been making a careful survey of the room in
the hope of seeing some possibility of escape. The dais upon which I stood
extended as far as the side wall, in which there was a window. The window was
half open, and, could I reach it, there appeared to be a deserted looking
garden outside, which might communicate with the street. No one could intercept
me before I reached the window, but then there was the deadly weapon with which
my cadaverous acquaintance was still trifling. He was sitting on the other
side, and the table would partially protect me should I venture upon a dash.
Could I screw up my courage to make an attempt? Not yet, at any rate.</p>
<p>"General von Link," I continued, "the Austrian artillerist, is one of our
leading authorities upon guncotton. He experimented upon it in field-pieces,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind that," said the president.</p>
<p>"After being manufactured, guncotton may be compressed under water. When
compressed it is perfectly safe, and cannot be discharged. This sample which we
have upon the table is not compressed. No amount of heat will have any effect
upon the wet cotton. In an experiment tried in England a storehouse containing
guncotton was burned down without there being any explosion. If, however, a
charge of fulminated mercury, or a small piece of dry cotton, be fired in
connection with a damp disc, it will be sufficient to discharge it. I shall now
proceed to demonstrate this to you by an experiment."</p>
<p>An idea had come into my mind. Upon the table there was lying a mixture of
sugar and chlorate of potash, used with sulphuric acid as a fuse for mining
purposes. A bottle of the acid was also ready to my hand. I knew the white
dense cloud of smoke which is raised by the imperfect combustion of these
bodies. Could I make it serve as a screen between the weapon of the president
and myself?</p>
<p>For a moment the plan seemed wild and unfeasible; still, it offered some
chance of escape, and the more I thought it over the more reconciled I became
to it. Of course, even after getting through the window there was the
possibility that the garden might prove to be a cul-de-sac, and that my
pursuers might overtake me. But then, on the other hand, I had no guarantee
that I might not be murdered at the conclusion of my lecture. From what I knew
of the habits of such men I considered it to be extremely probable. It was
better to risk&mdash;but no, I would not think of what I was risking.</p>
<p>"I am now going to show you the effect of fulminate of mercury upon a small
piece of damp cotton," I said, shaking out the sugar and chlorate of potash
upon the edge of the table and pushing the large piece of cotton to the other
end to be out of danger from the effects of the explosion.</p>
<p>"You will observe that the fact of the substance having been soaked with
water does not in any way hinder its action." Here I poured the sulphuric acid
over the mixture, dropped the bottle, and fled for the window amid a perfect
cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>Most little men with spectacles are not remarkable for activity. Ha! there
at last I proved myself to be an exception. I seemed hardly to put my foot to
the ground between leaving the table and shooting out through the window as the
equestrians fly through hoops in the circus. I was well outside before the
sharp crack which I was expecting sounded in the chamber behind me, and
then&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah! what then? How can I ever hope to describe it? There was a low, deep
rumble, which seemed to shake the ground, swelling and swelling in sound until
it culminated in a roar which split the very heavens. Flames danced before my
eyes, burning wood and stones and d&eacute;bris came clattering down around me,
and as I stared about me in bewilderment I received a crushing blow upon the
head, and fell.</p>
<p>How long I may have remained unconscious it is difficult to say. Some time,
at any rate, for when I came to myself I was stretched upon the bed in my own
little chamber at home, while the devoted Gretchen bathed my temples with
vinegar and water. In the doorway were standing a couple of stalwart polizei
diener, who bobbed their helmeted heads and grinned their satisfaction on
seeing that I was returning to consciousness.</p>
<p>It was some while before I could recall anything of what had passed. Then
gradually came the recollection of my mysterious visitor, of the wild drive
through the storm, of the impromptu lecture on dynamite, and lastly of some
strange and unaccountable accident. Strange it still remains, but I think that
when we reflect that the table was between the bullet and me, and that on that
table were two pounds of guncotton liable to ignition at a blow, we have not
very far to go for an explanation. I have fired a pistol at a distance into a
small piece of the same substance since that occasion with very much the same
result.</p>
<p>And where was the house? you will ask, and what was the fate of its inmates?
Ah! there my lips are sealed. The police of the Fatherland are active and
cunning, and they have commanded me to say nothing&mdash;not even to my dearest
friend&mdash;upon either point. No doubt they have their reasons for it, and I
must obey. Perhaps they wish other conspirators to imagine that more has been
found out than is actually the case. I may say, however, that it is not
conducive to long life or perfect health to be present on such an occasion.
That, at least, no one can object to.</p>
<p>I am nearly well again now, thanks to Gretchen and Dr Benger, who lives down
the road. I can hobble about, and my neighbours are already beginning to
complain of the noxious vapours which I evolve. I fear I have not quite the
same enthusiasm, however, upon the subject of explosives as I entertained
before my midnight lecture on dynamite. The subject seems to have lost many of
its charms. It may be that in the course of time I may return to my first love
once again; at present, however, I remain a quiet privat docent of the more
elementary branches of chemistry. It is that very quietness which weighs upon
my mind. I fear that I am on the verge of some other unexpected adventure.
There is one thing, however, upon which I am unalterably determined. Should
every relative that I have in the world, with the Imperial family and half the
population of Berlin, be clamouring at my door for medical advice, I shall
never again protrude my head after nightfall. I am content to work away in my
own little groove, and have laid aside for ever the pretensions to be looked
upon as a practical physician which I entertained before that eventful
Christmas Eve.</p>

<h3>First published in <i>Temple Bar</i> magazine, January 1884<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>"Bob," said I, "this won't do; something must be done."</p>
<p>"It must," echoed Bob, as he puffed away from his pipe in a mouldy little
sitting-room in the Shamrock Arms, at Glenmahowley.</p>
<p>Glenmahowley attained any importance which it possessed by being the centre
of an enormous area of peat cuttings and bog land which stretched away with
exasperating monotony to the horizon, unbroken by the slightest irregularity.
In one place only, along the Monatsimon road, there was a single belt of thick
woods, whose luxuriance only served to aggravate the hopeless waste around
them. The village itself consisted of a long straggling line of thatched
cottages, each with an open door, through which entered bare-legged children,
gaunt pigs, cocks and hens, ragged-looking, short-piped men and slatternly
women. Bob Elliott seemed rather to admire the aborigines. No doubt it tickled
his vanity to hear admiring exclamations as he went down the street; such as
"Look at him now; look at the illigant fut on him!" or, "Och, then an' isn't he
a beautiful gintleman entoirely!" But I don't care for these things. Besides,
though far more handsome than Bob, my beauty is of an intellectual type, and is
lost upon those savages. My nose is pronounced, my complexion pallid, and my
head denotes considerable brain power. "There's no harm in the crayter!" was
the least offensive of the opinions which these idiots expressed of me.</p>
<p>We had been located in this barbaross place about a week. Bob and I were
second cousins, and a distant mutual relation whom neither of us had seen had
bequeathed us each a small property in tha West. The clearing-up of business
attendant on this, and the necessity of consulting with the old lady's
pragmatical country attorney, had kept us for a week in the Shamrock Arms, and
promised to keep s for at least another one in that unenviabe retreat if we
could survive the tedium cf our existence so long.</p>
<p>"What can we do?" groaned Bob again.</p>
<p>"Where's Pendleton? Let's get Pendleton up and take a rise out of him," I
suggested, with a flickering attempt at vivacity. Pendleton was our fellow-
lodger at the inn&mdash;a quiet young fellow of artistic proclivities, with a
weakness for solitary rambles and seclusion. All or attempts to pump him had
failed as yet to elicit any explanation of the object and aims which had led
him to Glenmahowley, unless it were that its bleak morasses harmonised with his
misanthropic turn of mind.</p>
<p>"I's no use," said my companion. "He's as dismal as a tombstone and as shy
as a girl. I never saw such a fellow. I wanted him to come with me this morning
when you were writing your letter and to aid and abet me in a little mild chaff
with the two girls at the draper's&mdash;you need help against these Irish
girls, you know&mdash;but he flushed up quite red, and wouldn't hear of such a
thing."</p>
<p>"No, he is hardly cut out for a ladykiller," I remarked, adjusting my
necktie before the fly-blown mirror and practising a certain expression which I
have found extremely effective with the weaker sex&mdash;a sort of Lara-like
piratical cock of the eye which gives the impression of hidden griefs and a
soul which spurns the commonplaces of existence. "Perhaps he will come in,
though, and play dummy whist."</p>
<p>"No, he never touches cards."</p>
<p>"Milksop!" I ejaculated. "We'll send for the landlord, Bob, and ask him if
there is nothing we can see or do."</p>
<p>This was recognised to be the most rational proceeding under the
circumstances, and a messenger was despatched in hot haste to summon Dennis
O'Keefe, our worthy host. Let me remark, while he is shuffling upstairs in his
slipshod carpet slippers, that I am the mortal known as John Vereker,
barrister- at-law, popularly supposed to be a rising man, though the exact
distance that I have risen during the four years that I have been in practice
is not calculated to turn my brain. Several nice little actions have, however,
during that time been taken against me in county courts and otherwise, so that
I have put the machinery of the law into motion, though my personal profit in
the matter must be acknowledged to have been somewhat remote.</p>
<p>O'Keefe was a fine specimen of the aboriginal Celt&mdash;freckle-faced and
rough-haired, with shrewd grey eyes and a deep rich Milesian voice. "Good-
morrow to ye, gintlemen," he began as he entered, his large flat feet and
uncouth gait giving him a sort of plantigrade appearance. "What would your
honours be afther today?"</p>
<p>"The very thing we wanted to ask you, O'Keefe," aaid Bob. "What in the world
are we to do? Can't you suggest anything?"</p>
<p>"There's the church," remarked O'Keefe, scratching his red hair in
perplexity. "'Tis a foine building. There was a gintleman came here the year
before last just for to look at it. Maybe your honors&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hang the church!" roared Bob, with as much vehemence as a Radical advocate
for Disestablishment; "we were there five times last week&mdash;in fact, every
day except Sunday. Try again, old Pict and Scot."</p>
<p>Our host, who was serenely indifferent to the many unintelligible epithets
applied to him by Bob's exuberant fancy, pondered once more over the problem.
"There's the hole in the bog," he suggested with diffidence. "The same where
the boys threw Mr Lyons, of Glenmorris&mdash;bad scran to him!&mdash; after
they shot him. Maybe you'd loike to see where they found him wid his head in
the mud an' his feet stickin' up. Ah, it was a glad soight, Sorrs, for the
pisantry that had worked and slaved&mdash;the craturs&mdash;and then for him to
step in wid a dirty foive and twinty per cint reduction in the rint and serve
notices on them as wouldn't pay. Sure you could take your food&mdash;or a
gossoon could carry it&mdash;and picnic by the hole."</p>
<p>"The prospect is alluring," I remarked "but there seems to me to be too much
chance of the inoffensive tillers of the soil taking a fancy to plant a couple
more Saxons upside down in the bog-hole. I negative that suggestion."</p>
<p>"What are those trees to the eastward?" asked Bob. "Surely there is
something to be seen down there."</p>
<p>"It's proivate. It's the Clairmont family's ground, an' you'd be shot as
loike as not if you so much as put your nose over the wall."</p>
<p>"Pleasant land this, Jack!" remarked my companion ruefully. "I almost wish
old O'Quibble would unearth a codicil leaving the place to somebody else."</p>
<p>"Ah, sure you can't judge of the counthry now while it's quoiet," said our
host. "Wait till the throubles come round agin&mdash;next year maybe, or the
year afther. It's a loively land when the bhoys is out&mdash;sorra a taste of
scenery would you think about; and bein' landlords yourselves by that toime,
you'd see the cream of the diversion."</p>
<p>"How about these Clairmonts?" I asked at a venture. "Do they live upon their
own land?"</p>
<p>"Begorra&mdash;you've got it there!" cried O'Keefe. "They do nothing but
live on their own land. They've niver stirred off it for more'n 15 years."</p>
<p>"Never stirred off it!"</p>
<p>"Sorra a fut beyond the park gates and the great brick wall. No man's oi has
ever rested upon Miss Clairmont's face bar ould Dennis the lodgekeeper
&mdash;the blackmouthed spalpeen&mdash;more be token they say she's grown into
the purtiest girl in the county, forbye having foive and twinty thousand in her
own right."</p>
<p>"What!" we both roared.</p>
<p>"Foive and twinty thousand pound," repeated O'Keefe solemnly; "and when her
ould cat of a mother dies she'll come in for the whole family estate."</p>
<p>"What is she?" "Where is she?" "Who is she?" "What the devil is the matter
with her?" shouted Bob and I, forming a sort of strophe and antistrophe to the
landlord's chorus.</p>
<p>O'Keefe's account of the past history of the Clairmont family was a
remarkable one, and, when curtailed of his many Hibernian digressions and
meanderings, amounted to this: A certain Major Clairmont had come into the
County some 16 years before, bearing with him a large sum in hard cash, a
showy- looking wife of rather foreign appearance, and a pretty little daughter
about two years old. Having expended a portion of the first item upon the
purchase of a considerable estate near Glenmahowley, he had taken up his
residence there and awaited some recognition from the County families. This
came soon enough in the ease of tlie Major, who, as an old Guardsman, possessed
a recognised social position, which was secured by his own many admirable
qualities. It was different with Madame. The men might drink the old claret of
the soldier, or take a day's shooting in his pheasant preserves, but their
wives made no sign. Strange rumours were in circulation as to the antecedents
of Mrs C. Some said that she had been upon the stage before her marriage; some
that her career had been more equivocal still. There were individuals who
ventured to doubt that she possessed even now the little blue slip of paper
which civilisation demands. It was this rumour which some busybody brought to
the ears of the Major, coupling with it the name of a neighbouring landed
proprietor. The Major was a bull-necked, choleric man. He chose out his
heaviest hunting crop and galloped furiously down the avenue to interview the
traducer of his wife's character. The lodgekeeper was surprised to see the
veteran horseman reel in his saddle as he shot through the gates and then fall
backward with a dull thud on to the dusty road. The local practitioner
pronounced it to be apoplexy, while the family physician favoured heart
disease&mdash;but whatever the cause, the Major's spirit had drifted far away
from Glemnahowley. It was then that that fiery foreign strain which showed
itself on his wife's face asserted itself in her character. She would live on
the estates still because he had been fond of them, but her life should be
spent in mourning her loss and in educating her daughter in her own way. Above
all, never should she again exchange word or look with any living being to the
County which had insulted her aud indirectly caused her husband's death. The
great gates were walled up, and only small slits left through which provisions
and other necessaries ordered by Dennis, the lodgekeeper, were handed. A
formidable row of spikes was plantod on the brick wall which had always
surrounded the estate. In this extraordinary seclusion, cut off from the whole
world, Mrs Clairmont and her daughter had now passed 15 years of their lives
unseen by human eyes, save those of the few English domestics who remained with
them, and perhaps an occasional daring urchin who might penetrate into the wood
which surrounded the great house. It was these irregular scouts no doubt who
had brought word of the exceeding beauty of the young lady, though no adult
male had yet had the privilege of being able to form an opinion upon it. She
was at present close upon her eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p>Thus far O'Keefe; while Bob and I sat, with elbows upon the table and chins
upon our hands, drinking in every word. Neither of ua broke the silence for
some little time after he had concluded. Bob Elliott puffed furiously at his
pipe, while I looked dreamily out of the window at the thatched roofs of the
cottages and the long, monotonous stretch of bog land in the distance.</p>
<p>"She is beautiful?" asked Bob at last.</p>
<p>"She is that!"</p>
<p>"And rich?" I queried.</p>
<p>"Divil a doubt of it."</p>
<p>We relapsed into another silence, in the midst of which our worthy landlord,
evidently thinking us the worst of company, stole out of the room, walking for
some unknown reason upon the tips of his toes as if he were afraid of waking
us.</p>
<p>Left to ourselves, we became even more meditative than before. Bob strolled
restlessly up and down in front of the door; I whistled and continued to stare
out of the window. We were both lost in our own thoughts.</p>
<p>"Fancy a girl who has never even seen a male fellow creature!" ejaculated
Bob at last.</p>
<p>"Who is unfettered by the conventionalities of civilisation!" said I.</p>
<p>"How artless she must be and how simple!" remarked my companion, twisting
his moustache.</p>
<p>"What a depth of pent-up affection there must be in that heart!" I
exclaimed, with my corsair-like look of slumbrous passion.</p>
<p>"How charmingly childlike and romantic!" said Bob, smoothing his hair in the
glass.</p>
<p>"How easy for a dashing young fellow to win!" I returned, smiling at my own
reflection over Bob's shoulder.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that for the remainder of the day, though nothing in
the shape of a distraction turned up, neither of us complained of the ennui of
a residence in Glenmahowley. We both seemed suddenly reconciled to a
contemplative existence, and even became tolerant of Pendleton, whose
contentment under existing circumstances had struck us hitherto as nothing less
than an insult. He came in about supper-time with his sketch-book and his mud-
bespattered boots, apparently as happy as if he were among the most artistic
scenery in the world. If it were not for his shyness and reserve he would be
rather a pleasant fellow&mdash;that is, in gentlemen's society, for his
diffidence would ruin him among women. He is tall, slim, and fair-haired,
rather a good-looking young man&mdash;decidedly more so than Bob.</p>
<p>I did not sleep very well that night; neither did my companion. He showed
his tousled head round the corner of my door somewhere about two o'clock in the
morning.</p>
<p>"Hello, Jack," he said, "are you asleep?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"What was the figure again?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-five," I growled.</p>
<p>"I thought it was twenty. Thanks! Good night!"</p>
<p>"Good-night!" and the head disappeared like the apparition in "Macbeth." It
was evident that our thoughts were running in very much, the same groove. As
for me, my plans were matured, and I could afford to smile at Bob's
cogitations. While he hankered aimlessly for the prize I should swoop down and
carry it off. The Verekers were always noted for their iron determination. I
chuckled to myself while I dropped to sleep as I thought of the march which I
should steal upon him on the morrow.</p>
<p>The day broke without a cloud on the sky. Both Elliott and Pendleton were
somewhat silent at breakfast, and as I was engaged in planning the details of
the enterprise to which I had determined to commit myself, I did not attempt to
enter into conversation with them. After the meal Pendleton remarked that he
would take a short stroll in search of effects, and Bob almost immediately
afterward sallied out for a mouthful of fresh air. This was a most unexpected
piece of luck. I had ransacked my brain for some excuse which would enable me
to get rid of my companion, and here he had solved the problem of his own
accord. Giving him half an hour's grace to take him well out of the way, I
slipped out through the back door of the Shamrock Arms and made my way rapidly
down the Morristown road in the direction of the Clairmont estate.</p>
<p>My sole doubt and anxiety was as to how I was to succeed in obtaining an
interview with the young lady. Should fortune befriend me in that matter the
rest appeared simple enough. I pictured to myself her mental condition, the
sense of desolation which must oppress her young soul. Cooped up away from the
world, her heart must yearn for some manly bosom upon which to rest her head,
some strong arm to break her fetters. Besides, I was a man with exceptional
personal advantages. Without being conceited, I have a just appreciation of my
own merits. To eyes accustomed to nothing but an occasional glance of Dennis,
the lodge-keeper, I should appear an Adonis. By the way, how about Dennis?
Might he not resent my intrusion? Pooh! he was an old man. I remember the
landlord saying so. What would I not risk for the girl whom I was prepared to
adore! Perhaps he would have a gun, though! These Irishmen are hotheaded and
blood-thirsty. I grew thoughtful and slackened my pace.</p>
<p>By this time I had come to the place where a high brick wall, with a conical
coping bristling with spikes and pieces of broken bottles, ran along by the
side of the road. This I recognised, from O'Keefe's description, as being the
boundary line of the Clairmont estate. At the other side of the wall there was,
as far as I could see, a thick forest. Should I do it, or should I not? I
thought of the five and twenty thousand pounds. Besides, what would a gate-
keeper be doing with a gun! What a sell for Bob Elliott&mdash;and for
Pendleton, the shy Pendleton! Would they not curse their want of energy when
they saw the prize which had slipped through their fingers? How the fellows
would talk in London, too, even if I failed! It would make my name as a Don
Juan. I could imagine Clinker or Waterhuse or some of the old set coming into
the Temple wine bar and beginning: " I say, you chaps, have you heard of
Vereker's latest? Very devil among women, is Vereker. He was in Ireland a few
weeks ago"&mdash;and so on, and so on. "By Jove!" I cried, as I approached the
wall in a paroxysm of recklessness, "I'll do it if I have to skin my knee!"</p>
<p>I did skin my knee; in fact, I skinned them both. I also removed portions of
integument from my scalp, shoulder, elbow, hand, and ankle, besides splitting
my coat and losing my hat. I was recompensed for all this, however, as I sat
astride upon the top of the wall and looked down into the forbidden land
beyond. I could have laughed at the thought of the march I was stealing on my
two companions. I would have done so had it not been for a spike which was
running into the calf of my leg.</p>
<p>The drop on the other side did not look very deep. I held on to tho largest
projection I could see, and lowered myself until my feet were not more than a
yard or so from the ground. Then I let go, but only to find that I hung
suspended by a hook which had passed through my waistband. This impediment,
however, gave way, and I fell with a crash for about nine feet into a sort of
trench, which had been dug apparently all round the inner side of the wall, and
was so artistically covered with grass and sticks that it was impossible to
detect it from the top. All this I discovered after I crawled out of it, for
during the few minutes that I lay at the bottom every idea was shaken out of my
head beyond a general impression that I had been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>The trees grew so thickly together that it was impossible to see for any
distance into the wood, and the brushwood was so dense that it was no easy
matter to move in any direction. After emerging from the ditch I hesitated for
a moment as to my next step, and then was about to keep to what appeared to be
some sort of path on the left when my eye was attracted by a small I placard
attached to the trunk o&pound; a tree. I made my way toward it eagerly, pushing
aside the intervening briers and brambles. It might contain some directions
which would enable me to find my way, or&mdash;romantic thought!&mdash;it might
be that the lonely Beatrice I was in search of had inscribed her pinings and
longings where they might meet the eye of an adventurous stranger. As I stood
before the inscription and read it I felt a kind of cold flush, if the
expression be permissible, pass along my spine and up to the roots of my hair,
while my knees, or what was left of them, knocked together like castanets.
Scrawled upon the paper in a rough bold hand were the three words, "Bloodhounds
&mdash;spring-guns&mdash;mantraps;" unpleasant words at any time, but most
particularly so amid the gloom of a forest with a ten-foot wall in one's rear.
The announcement was a concise one, and yet I felt as I re-perused it that it
contained more food for reflection than any volume which I had ever read. Was I
to abandon my enterprise now that the first difficulty had been successfully
overcome? Possibly the notice was a mere empty threat. Surely no one would
allow such things to remain in their shrubberies. The combination of ideas was
so dreadful. Suppose that I was caught in a mantrap, whatever that might be,
and was then attacked by a bloodhound. The mere supposition made me shudder.
But then if these frightful dogs were really roaming about over the forest, how
was it that none of them were shot by the spring guns or caught in the traps?
This consideration revived my drooping spirits, and I pushed on through the
thick underwood.</p>
<p>As I advanced it opened up somewhat, so that I made better progress. A few
half-overgrown paths meandered here and there, but I avoided these and kept
under the concealment of the trees. Never shall I forgot that dreadful walk!
Every time a twig snapped I sprang into the air under the impression that I was
shot. No hero of romance ever underwent such an ordeal for his lady, and indeed
no lady was ever worth it. Five and twenty thousand pounds, however, are enough
to steel the heart of the most timorous, but even they would hardly recompense
me for the frights which were if store for me.</p>
<p>I had got to one of the deepest and one of the most secluded parts of the
wood, when I stopped suddenly and crouched down, trembling in every limb. Was
it the sound of footsteps which had been wafted toward me on the breeze? I
listened intently, and then with a long sigh of relief was about to rise,
convinced that I had been mistaken, when the same sound came to my ears, but
much louder than before. There could be no question that it was approaching me.
I lay down upon my face among the prickly brambles, hoping to escape
observation. The footsteps continued to come nearer and nearer. They were those
of a man&mdash;but put down stealthily and softly as if he were also shunning
observation. Could it be that some ruffian had observed me and was hunting me
down as one stalks a deer? He waa coming nearer and nearer. I could hear the
rustle of the leaves as he brushed past them. It seemed to me that I could even
distinguish the sound of his breathing. Nearer he came and nearer still&mdash;
he was close to me, and the next moment the brambles in front of me parted and
a man stepped out almost upon the top of me, and staggered back with a shout as
I sprang to my feet. The voice seemed familiar&mdash;so did the figure. Could
it be? Yes; there was no mistaking the identity of Mr Robert Elliott, of
Lincoln's Inn!</p>
<p><i>Sed quantum mutatus ab illo!</i> The stylish coat was torn and covered
with mud. The aristocractic face was stained with dust and perspiration, and
interlaced with scratches where the brambles had left their mark. His hat had
been knocked in and was a hopless wreck. His watchguard and the studs in his
shirt seemed to stand out as oases of respectability in a great desert of
desolation.</p>
<p>"Bob!" I ejaculated. It was a few moments before any sign of recognition
came over his face. Then gradually the ghost of a smile appeared in his
astonished eyes, which deepened and deepened until he burst into an uproarious
fit of laughter.</p>
<p>"Vereker, by Jove!" he yelled. "Whatever have you been doing to
yourself?"</p>
<p>I looked down at my own costume and was forced to acknowledge that there was
very little to choose between us. What with the wall and the ditch and the
underwood and the briars, there was hardly an article of clothing which was fit
to be worn again. The two of us looked more like a couple of scarecrows on
tramp and in search of employment, than two prominent members of the Junior
Bar.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Elliott?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Exploring," he answered evasively ; "what are you?"</p>
<p>"Explor&mdash;No, hang it, why can't we be frank to one another, Bob? You
know, very well you came after thst girl."</p>
<p>My companion looked sheepish. "Well, I suppose you did the same." he
said.</p>
<p>"Of course I did. What fools we were to try and bamboozle each other! If we
had stuck together we might never have got into such a plight."</p>
<p>"I'm very sure I should never have tumbled into that infernal ditch if I had
seen you go in," said Bob ruefully.</p>
<p>"Oh, you've been in the ditch, too, have you?" I remarked, with the first
approach to satisfaction I had felt since I left O'Keefe's hospitable roof.</p>
<p>"Yes," groaned Bob. "I think I have been through the whole performance. Did
you see any notices on the trees?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"Has old Dennis been round to you yet?"</p>
<p>"No; have you seen him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he passed within ten yards of me a short time ago. At least I suppose
it was him&mdash;a big gaunt fellow with a great stick."</p>
<p>"Heaven save us!" I ejaculated.</p>
<p>"However, he has passed now, and the question is what are we to do?"</p>
<p>"Persevere," I responded manfully. "It would be more dangerous to go back
than to go on since that truculent gatekeeper is behind us."</p>
<p>"Right you are!" said Elliott, with a melancholy attempt at cheerfulness.
"You lead on, and I'll follow."</p>
<p>"No, you go first," I answered, not, I am bound to say, from any innate
courtesy or feeling of politeness, but with an idea that dangers from the
abominations mentioned on the placard would be lessened thereby.</p>
<p>We threaded our way through the forest in Indian file, and after advancing
for about half a mile were evidently close to the edge of it. The trees were
smaller and the unplanted spaces larger. Suddenly Bob pulled up and pointed in
front of him. "There's the house," he said.</p>
<p>There it was sure enough, a stern-looking edifice of gray stone with a large
number of small, glimmering windows. There was a lawn in front of it, very
tastefully laid out, which somewhat relieved the gloomy and prison-like
appearance of the building. No one was to be seen either outside or at the
windows. We held a council of war as to what our next step ahould be.</p>
<p>"We can't walk right up to the house under some excuse or other, can we?"
said Bob.</p>
<p>"It would be too dangerous," I remarked. "There is no saying what they might
do to us. They seem to be very savage people."</p>
<p>"Besides it would be the very last way to have any chance of saying a few
words to the young lady," added my companion.</p>
<p>"The whole thing makes a deuced romatic situation," I observed.</p>
<p>"I wonder what Pendleton would think of us if he saw us?"</p>
<p>"Poor shy Pendleton! I think he would put us both down as madmen."</p>
<p>"It's a pity he is so retiring," said Bob. "But I say, Jack, what do you
intend to say to the young lady when you see her?"</p>
<p>"Why, I propose to tell her of my love straight off, and ask her to fly with
me. It must be all done to-day. I'm not coming in here again on any
consideration. Besides, I think it will not be difficult to carry a romantic
girl of that sort by a kind of <i>coup de main</i>."</p>
<p>"But that's exactly my plan," said Bob plaintively.</p>
<p>"The deuce it is!" I ejaculated. "By George! There she is!"</p>
<p>The last exclamation was drawn from me by the appearance upon the steps of
the house of an elegantly dressed young lady. Her features were invisible,
owing to the . distance, but her erect carriage and the long, graceful curves
of her figure showed that report had not exaggerated her charms. She turned as
she came out to address an elder woman, her mother probably, who followed her.
The latter seemed, as far as we could make out, to be weeping, for she raised
her handkerchief to her eyes several times, while the girl passed her arm round
her neck as if to console her. In this she appeared to succeed, for the elder
went back into the house, and the younger sprang down the three steps at a
single bound and hurried away, with long, elastic steps, down the path which
led into the shrubbery.</p>
<p>"We must follow her," I cried.</p>
<p>"Take your time," said Bob. "We must come to some agreement before we start.
It would be too ridiculous for the two of us to plunge at her together and
begin pouring out two confessions of love."</p>
<p>"It might startle her," I remarked, "especially as she has never seen either
of us before."</p>
<p>"Who is to have the preference, then?"</p>
<p>"I am the elder," I observed.</p>
<p>"But then I left the inn first," objected Elliott.</p>
<p>"Well, suppose we toss for it."</p>
<p>"I suppose we must," said Bob gloomily, producing a penny and spinning it up
in the air: " Heads, so it is. Just my luck. Of course, if after your proposal
the young lady thinks fit to refuse you I am at liberty to do whatever I
choose. Is that agreed?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," I answered, and we both pushed on rapidly through the
shrubbery, gaining confidence as we saw some prospect of attaining our
object.</p>
<p>"There she is," whispered Bob, as we saw the flutter of a pink dress among
the trees in front of us.</p>
<p>"There's a man talking to her!"</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>"There is."</p>
<p>If there was he must have disappeared very rapidly on hearing our approach,
for when he got near enough to her to see her whole figure she was alone. She
turned with a start of surprise, and seemed inclined for a moment to run away
from us, but then, recovering herself, she came toward us. As she advanced I
saw that she was one of the most lovely girls that I had ever seen in my
life&mdash;not at all the doll-like sort of beauty that I had imagined from
what I knew of her training, but a splendid, well-developed young woman with a
firmly set lower jaw and delicately moulded chin which would have been almost
masculine in their force had they not been relieved by a pair of pensive blue
eyes and a sweetly sensitive mouth. Somehow, as I found her steady gaze
directed at me, all the well-turned speeches which I had rehearsed in my mind
seemed to fade entirely from my memory and leave nothing but an utter blank
behind. The amorous gallop with which we bore down upon her subsided into a
ridiculous trot, and when eventually I pulled up a few yards in front of her I
could no more have uttered a word of explanation than I could have recovered my
lost hat or concealed the gaps in my clothing.</p>
<p>"I fancy you must have mistaken your way," she said in a low, sweet voice
without the slightest appearance of heing affected by this apparition of young
men. I felt Bob nudge me from behind and whisper something about "going' ahead"
and "making the running," but my only inclination under the gaze of those calm,
tranquil eyes was to make the running in the opposite direction at the top of
my speed.</p>
<p>"The house is over there," she observed, pointing through the trees. "I
suppose that you are the bailiff."</p>
<p>"Bailiffs!" I gasped.</p>
<p>"Excuse me if I do not give you your proper title," she continued with a
melancholy 3mile. "It is the first time that we have ever been brought in
contact with the officers of the law, and hardly know how to address them. We
have expected you for two days."</p>
<p>Bob and I could only stare at her in silent bewilderment.</p>
<p>"There is one thing I should like to ask you," she went on, drawing nearer
to us with her liands clasped and a beautiful pleading expression upon her
face.</p>
<p>"Though my mother and I are almost beggars now, remember that she is a lady,
delicately reared and sensitive. Above all, remember that she has no one to
protect her or to take her part. Be gentle with her, therefore, and do you duty
without wounding her feelings more than you can help."</p>
<p>"Bob," I whispered, drawing my companion aside, though he still continued to
stare idiotically over my shoulder at the young lady. "Do you realise it? They
expect the bailiffs. There's no money in the concern. What are we to do?"</p>
<p>"She's an angel!" was all Bob could evolve.</p>
<p>"So she is, but she's got no money."</p>
<p>"Then you give her up?"</p>
<p>"I do," said I with a sentimental twinge at my heart. Sentimentalism has
always been my weak point.</p>
<p>"You won't propose?" asked Bob excitedly.</p>
<p>"No, marriage is an expensive luxury. Besides&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Besides what? "</p>
<p>"I am convinced she would not have me."</p>
<p>"Then, by Jove, I'll do it I" said Bob, facing round with a look of
determination upon his dirty face.</p>
<p>Miss Clairmont had been standing looking considerably surprised and a little
frightened during our hurried conclave. She drew back a few feet. Bob took a
step toward her with his arms thrown out in eloquent entreaty, like an animated
semaphore.</p>
<p>"Young lady," he began, "I am not a bailiff. I belong to another and a
higher branch of the legal profession. I am a Londoner and a gentleman."</p>
<p>Bob paused for a moment to allow this statement to sink into his listener's
mind. Miss Clairinont looked more amazed than impressed, though it was evident
from her shrinking figure that she was considerably startled. "In a foreign
land," cried Bob warming to his work&mdash;"a land beyond the seas &mdash;I
allude to England&mdash;I heard of your charms and of your solitary existence,
and I swore&mdash;that is to say, we both did, only I lost the toss&mdash;to
save you and bring you out into the great world which you are so fitted to
adorn. We crossed the deep&mdash;which made us both exceedingly
unwell&mdash;and flew to your rescue. We have scaled this inhospitable wall of
yours; if you doubt my statement you will find a large portion of the sleeve of
my coat upon one of the spikes which adorn it. We also ran the gauntlet of the
many unpleasant things which your amiable parent seems to have littered about
for the benefit of the casual stranger. Dear girl," continued Bob, advancing
with an imbecile grin upon his countenance, which he imagined no doubt to be a
seductive smile, "fly with me! Be mine! Share with me the wild free life of a
barrister! Say that you return the love which fills my heart &mdash;oh, say
it!" Here Bob put his hand over a hole in his waistcoat and struck a dramatic
attitude.</p>
<p>During this extraordinary address the young lady had been gradually edging
away from us, and at its conclusion she burst into a merry peal of
laughter.</p>
<p>"Edward?" she cried&mdash;"Ned! Do come out! It's really too ridiculous, but
I don't know what to say to them."</p>
<p>At this summons a man emerged from behind a tree where he had concealed
himself and flew to her side. Imagine our petrifying and all-absorbing
astonishment when we recognised in him Pendleton, our retiring companion of the
inn.</p>
<p>"Don't be frightened, darling," he said, passing his arm round her slender
waist, to Bob's intense and audible disgust. "I can understand, gentlemen," he
went on, "the romantic motives which have led you here, but you will see how
futile they are when I tell you that this lady is my wife."</p>
<p>"Your what?" roared Bob and I in chorus.</p>
<p>"My wedded wife. You are the first that have heard our secret, though Mrs
Clairmont must learn it to-day. It does not matter to you how we met or how we
married&mdash;suffice it that it is so. To-day the ruin which I had long
foreseen has come upon the household; Mrs Pendleton thinks it may have softened
the hard heart of her mother, and we are going up now to see her together, to
confess what we have done, and to offer her a home for the rest of her life at
my place in Devon. You will see, gentlemen," he continued, "that a delicate
matter of this sort must be done without interruption and at once; you will
therefore excuse us from showing you off the grounds. I may say, however, that
if you will keep to that path on the left you will soon find yourselves at the
boundary&mdash;and now, gentlemen, my wife and myself must wish you a very good
morning," with which he offered the young lady his arm and the two strolled off
together in the direction of the house.</p>
<p>How long Bob and I stood there gazing after them and at each other neither
of us could ever determine. Then we plodded sullenly down the path pointed out,
without exchanging a word, and after sundry gymnastic exercises found ourselves
in the road once more.</p>
<p>Bob was inclined to be sentimental all day, and perhaps I was hardly myself
either. When night fell, however, and a steaming jug of hot water was brought
up, flanked with a lemon on one side and the sugar on the other, while the
whisky bottle towered in the rear, we began to get over our troubles, and I
doubt if O'Keefe, when he joined us, could have given a guess at the stirring
events which had occurred since he told us the story of the Clairmont family
the night before. Certainly by next morning there were no traces left of our
short matrimonial campaign.</p>
<p>Another week found us in our chambers in town, settling down comfortably
into the old routine. I do not know where our next holiday will be spent, but I
confidently predict that it will not be at Glenmahowley. I have heard nothing
since of the Pendletons beyond the fact that he is the owner of a large estate
on the borders of Dartmoor. Bob talks of visiting those parts in the Spring,
but I think for his I own peace of mind he had better steer clear of those blue
eyes and sweet features which are our only pleasant recollection of the land of
bogs.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>THE TRAGEDIANS</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Bow Bells,</i> 20 August 1884.</h3>
<hr>
<p>I</p>
<p>Night had fallen on the busy world of Paris, and its gay population had
poured out on to the Boulevards; soldier and civilian, artistocrat and workman,
struggled for a footing upon the pavement, while in the roadway the Communistic
donkey of the costermonger jostled up against the Conservative thoroughbreds of
the Countess de Sang-pur. Here and there a <i>caf&eacute;,</i> with its
numerous little tables, each with its progeny of chairs, cast a yellow glare in
front of it, through which the great multitude seemed to ebb and flow.</p>
<p>Let us leave the noise and bustle of the Boulevard des Italiens behind us,
and turn to the right, along the Rue D'Egypte. At the bottom of this there lies
a labyrinth of dingy little quiet streets, and the dingiest and quietest of
them all is the Rue Bertrand.</p>
<p>In England, we should call it shabby-genteel. The houses are two-storied
semi-detached villas. There is a mournful and broken-down look about them, as
if they had seen better days, and were still endeavouring to screen their
venerable tiles and crumbling mortar behind a coquettish railing and jaunty
Venetian blinds.</p>
<p>The street is always quiet, but it is even quieter than usual to-night;
indeed, it would be entirely deserted but for a single figure which paces
backwards and forwards over the ill-laid pavement. The man&mdash;for a man it
is&mdash;must be waiting or watching for someone, as the Rue Bertrand is the
last place which the romantic dreamer would select for his solitary reverie. He
is here with a purpose, no doubt, and what that purpose may be is no business
either of ours or of the gendarme who comes clanking noisily round the
corner.</p>
<p>There is a house just opposite the spot where the watcher has stationed
himself, which exhibits not only signs of vitality, but even some appearance of
mirth. The contrast, perhaps, has caused him to stop and gaze at it. It is
neater and more modern-looking than its companions. The garden is well laid
out, and between the bars of the green <i>persiennes</i> the warm light glows
out into the street. It has a cheery, English look about it, which marks it out
among the fossils which surround it.</p>
<p>If the outside gives this impression, it is confirmed by the appearance of
the snug room within. A large fire is crackling and sparkling merrily, as if in
playful defiance of the stolid lamp upon the table. There are two people seated
in front of the blaze, both of the gentler sex, and it would take no very
profound student of humanity to pronounce at a glance that they were mother and
daughter.</p>
<p>In both there is the same sweet expression and the same graceful figure,
though the delicate outlines of the younger woman are exaggerated in her plump
little mother, and the hair which comes from under the matronly cap is streaked
with traces of grey.</p>
<p>Mrs. Latour has had an anxious time since her husband, the Colonel, died,
but has battled through it all with the uncomplaining patience of her race. Her
second son, Jack, at a university in England, has been a grief to her, for Jack
is sowing his wild oats, and vague reports of the process are wafted across the
Channel, and startle the quiet household in the Rue Bertrand. There is Henry,
too, with his great talent for tragedy, and no engagement for more than six
months. It is no wonder that the bustling, kind-hearted little woman is sad at
times, and that her cheery laugh is heard less frequently than of old. The sum
which the Colonel had left behind him is not a large one; were it not for the
supervision exercised by Rose it would hardly have met their necessary
expenses.</p>
<p>This young lady would certainly never be expected to have the household
virtues, if it be a fact that ornament and utility are seldom united in her
sex. It is true that she was no regal beauty; her features had not even the
merit of regularity; yet the graceful girl, with her laughing eyes and winning
smiles, would be a dangerous rival to the stateliest of her sex.
Unconsciousness of beauty is the strongest adjunct which beauty can have, and
Rose Latour possessed it in an eminent degree. You could see it in every
natural movement of her lithe form, and in the steady gaze of her hazel eyes.
No wonder that even in the venerable Rue Bertrand, which should have been above
such follies, there was a parting of window blinds when the dainty little
figure went tripping down it, and that the <i>blas&eacute;</i> Parisian
lounger, glancing at her face, sauntered on with the conviction that there was
something higher in womanhood than he had met with in his varied experiences of
the "Mubille" and the <i>Caf&eacute;s Chantants.</i></p>
<p>"Remember this, Rose," the old lady was saying, emphasising every second or
third word with an energetic little nod of the head, which gave her a strong
resemblance to a plump and benevolent sparrow, "you are a Morton, and nothing
but a Morton. You haven't one drop of French blood in you, my dear!"</p>
<p>"But papa was a Frenchman, wasn't he?" objected Rose.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear; but you are a pure Morton. Your father was a dear good man,
though he was a Frenchman, and only stood five feet four; but my children are
all Scotch. My father was six feet two, and so would my brother have been only
that the nurse used to read as she rolled him in the perambulator, and rested
her book upon his head, so that he was compressed until he looked almost
square, poor boy, but he had the makings of a fine man. You see, both Henry and
Jack are tall men, so it is ridiculous to call them anything but Morton, and
you are their sister. No, no, Rose; you haven't one drop of your father's blood
in you!"</p>
<p>With which physiological deduction the good old lady dropped twenty stitches
of her knitting and her ball of worsted, which rolled under the sideboard, with
the strange instinct which all things dropped possess, and was only dislodged
by Rose after ten minutes' poking in the dark with fire-irons.</p>
<p>This little interruption seemed to change the current of Mrs. Latour's
ideas.</p>
<p>"Henry is later than usual to-night," she remarked.</p>
<p>"Yes; he was going to the Theatre National to apply for an engagement, you
know. I do hope he won't be disappointed."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I can't conceive why they should ever refuse <i>such</i> a
handsome young fellow," said the fond mother. "I think, <i>even</i> if he could
not act at all, they would fill the house with people who wanted to look at
him."</p>
<p>"I wish I were a man, mamma," said Rose, pursing her lips to express her
idea of masculine inflexibility.</p>
<p>"Why, what would you do, child?"</p>
<p>"What wouldn't I do? I'd write books, and lecture, and fight, and all sorts
of things."</p>
<p>At which summary of manly accomplishments Mrs. Latour laughed, and Rose's
firmness melted away into a bright smile at her mother's mirth.</p>
<p>"Papa was a soldier," she said.</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear, there is no such thing as fighting now-a-days. Why, I
remember, when I was a girl in London, how twenty and thirty thousand people
used to be killed in a day. That was when young Sir Arthur Wellesley went out
to the Peninsula. There was Mrs. McWhirter, next door to us&mdash;her son was
wounded, poor fellow! It was a harrowing story. He was creeping through a hole
in a wall, when a nasty man came up, and ran something into him."</p>
<p>"How very sad!" said Rose, trying to suppress a smile.</p>
<p>"Yes; and I heard young McWhirter say, with his own lips, that he had never
seen the man before in his life, and he added that he never wished to see him
again. It was at Baggage-horse."</p>
<p>"Badajos, 'ma."</p>
<p>"I said so, dear. The occurrence dispirited young McWhirter very much, and,
indeed, threw a gloom over the whole family for the time. But England has
changed very much since then in every way. Why, the very language seems to me
to be altering in a marvellous manner. I doubt if I could make myself
understood if I went back. There is Jack, at Edinburgh&mdash;he uses
refinements of speech which you and I, Rose, have no idea of. We can't keep up
to the day when we are living in a foreign country."</p>
<p>"Jack does use some queer words," said Rose.</p>
<p>"I had a letter from him to-night," continued the little old woman, diving
first into her pocket, and then into her reticule. "Dear me! Oh, yes, here it
is! I really can't understand one word of it, my dear, except that the poor lad
seems to have met with some sort of an accident or misfortune."</p>
<p>"Acident, 'ma?"</p>
<p>"Well, something unpleasant, at any rate. He does not enter into any
particulars. Just listen, Rose, for it is very short. Perhaps you will be able
to make out what it means; but I confess it has puzzled me completely. Where
are my spectacles? It begins, 'Dearest mother,&mdash;that is intelligible
enough, and very gratifying, too, as far as it goes&mdash;'I have dropped a
pony over the Cambridgeshire.' What do you suppose your brother meant by that,
dear?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know, mamma," said the young lady, after pondering over
the mysterious sentence.</p>
<p>"You know he could not really have dropped a pony over anything. It would
have been too heavy for him, though he is a strong lad. His poor dear father
always used to say that he would be sure to have a very fine muscle; but that
would be too much. It must be his way of saying that a pony dropped him over
something, and no doubt he means that the accident occurred in
Cambridgeshire."</p>
<p>"Very likely, mamma."</p>
<p>"Well, now, listen to this. 'It was a case of scratching, so I was done for
without a chance.' Think of that, Rose! Something has been scratching the poor,
dear boy, or else he has been scratching something; I'm sure I don't know
which. I shouldn't think the pony can have scratched him, for they have hoofs,
you know."</p>
<p>"I don't think it could have been the pony," laughed Rose.</p>
<p>"It is all very mysterious. The next sentence is a little plainer. He says,
'If you have any of the ready, send it.' I know what he means by that, but it
is the only intelligible thing in the letter. He wishes to pay his doctor's
fees, no doubt, poor boy! He adds in a postcript that he may run over very
soon, so he cannot be much the worse."</p>
<p>"Well, that's consoling," said Rose. "I hope he will come soon, and explain
what it is all about."</p>
<p>"We'd better lay the table for supper," said the old lady. "Henry must come
soon."</p>
<p>"Never mind ringing for Marie," said the daughter. "I am what Jack would
call 'no end of a dab' at laying a table."</p>
<p>The mother laughed as she watched her darling flitting about the room, and
coming to endless grief over the disposition of her knives and forks.</p>
<p>"You have given the carver four knives," she said, "while his right-hand
neighbour has nothing but the steel to eat with. Listen, Rose; isn't that your
brother's step?"</p>
<p>"There are two people."</p>
<p>"One of them is he, I fancy."</p>
<p>"So it is!" cried Rose, as the key was turned in the latch, and a masculine
voice was heard in the hall. "How did you get on, Harry? Did you get it?"</p>
<p>And she took a spring into the passage, and threw her arms round her
brother.</p>
<p>"Wait a bit, Rosey! Let me get my coat off before you begin to throttle me!
It's all right this time, and I have got an engagement at the 'National.'"</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you, Rose?" said the mother.</p>
<p>"Come in, do, and let us know all about it!" pleaded Rose. "We are dying to
know!"</p>
<p>"I mustn't forget my politeness, though," said Henry. "Let me introduce Mr.
Barker, an Englishman, and a friend of Jack's."</p>
<p>A tall, dark young man, with a serious face, who was standing in the
background, stepped forward, and made his bow.</p>
<p>(I may remark, in parenthesis, before proceeding further, that I myself was
that Mr. Barker, and that what follows in this startling narrative is therefore
written from my own personal observation.)</p>
<p>We went into the snug little drawing-room, and drew up to the cheery
fire.</p>
<p>Rose sat upon her brother's knee, while Mrs. Latour dropped her knitting,
and put her hand into that of her son.</p>
<p>I leaned back in the shadow, at the other side of the hearth; while the
gleam of the light played upon the golden tresses of the girl and the dark,
stern profile of her brother.</p>
<p>"Well," said Henry, "to begin at the beginning, I went to a
<i>caf&eacute;</i> after I set out, and it was there that I had the good
fortune to come across Mr. Barker, whose name I know very well from Jack."</p>
<p>"We all seem to know you very well," said the mother.</p>
<p>I smiled and bowed.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to be in this miniature England in the heart of France.</p>
<p>"We went together to the National," continued Henry, "firmly believing I
hadn't the ghost of a chance, for Lablas, the great tragedian, has much
influence there, and he always does his best to harm and thwart me, though I
never gave him cause of offence that I know of."</p>
<p>"Nasty thing!" said Rose.</p>
<p>"My dear, you really musn't!"</p>
<p>"Well, you know he is, 'ma. But go on, do!"</p>
<p>"I didn't see Lablas there, but I managed to get hold of the manager, old
Monsieur Lambertin. He jumped at the proposal. He had the goodness to say that
he had seen me act at Rouen once, and had been much struck."</p>
<p>"I should think so!" said the old lady.</p>
<p>"He then said that they were just looking out for a man to play an important
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>&mdash;that of <i>Laertes,</i> in a new translation of
Shakespeare's 'Hamlet.' It is to come out on Monday night, so that I have only
two days to learn it in. It seems that another man, Monnier by name, was to
have played it, but he has broken his leg in a carriage accident. You have no
idea how cordial old Lambertin was!"</p>
<p>"Dear old man!" said Rose.</p>
<p>"But come, you must be hungry, Barker, and the supper is on the table. Pull
up your chairs, and just have some water boiling afterwards, Rose."</p>
<p>And so, with jest and laughter, we sat down to our little supper, and the
evening passed away like a happy dream.</p>
<p>Looking back through the long vista of years, I seem to be able to recall
the scene; the laughing, blushing girl, as she burned her fingers and spilt the
water in her attempts at making punch; the purring little bright-eyed mother;
the manly young fellow, with his honest laugh!</p>
<p>Who could have guessed the tragedy which was hanging over them? Who, except
that dark figure that was then still standing in the Rue Bertrand, and whose
shadow stretched across to darken the doorstep of number twenty-two?</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It was the same night, or rather the following morning, for the cathedral
clock had already struck three. The streets of Paris were deserted, save for an
occasional gendarme or a solitary reveller hurrying home from some scene of
pleasure.</p>
<p>Even in the Rue d'Anjou (the most dissipated of fashionable streets) there
were but few houses which showed a light.</p>
<p>It is to one of these, however, that our story leads us.</p>
<p>In a large room, luxuriously fitted up, half a dozen men in evening dress
were lounging and smoking. The great chandelier reflected its lustre cheerily
in the mirrors around, and cast a warm glow on the red velvet of the
furniture.</p>
<p>The carpet was so thick that hardly a footfall was heard, as one of the men
rose from his seat and walked over to lean against the great marble
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Any <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the French theatres would have known at a
glance who this man was. One could not easily forget the sinewy, upright form,
and the dark, cynical smile of Lablas, the foremost tragedian of the Theatre
National. A follower of Spurzheim would have prophesied great things, of good
or of evil, from that broad, low forehead and massive jaw; and another glance
at the cold grey eye and the sensual lip would have warned the physiognomist
that off the boards of the National this was a man to be shunned, a selfish
friend and a vindictive foe.</p>
<p>Our theatrical <i>habitu&eacute;</i> would have found some other, and
possibly some more agreeable, old acquaintances here.</p>
<p>Over there by the little glittering cabinet was Grossi&egrave;re, from the
Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s, cleverest and most unscrupulous of actors, whose duels
and intrigues were only less notorious than those of his host, Lablas. Beside
him was a <i>blas&eacute;</i> young officer of cavalry, and near him Turville,
another well-known actor and "lion." Reposing on the couch, puffing at a
meerschaum pipe, was Cachet, from the Gaiet&eacute;; while one or two less
known actors completed the group.</p>
<p>Lablas looked wearily at the table, all heaped with cards, dice, and odd
pieces of coin.</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "you must please yourselves. Shall we have
another turn or not?"</p>
<p>"We have plenty of time yet," said one of the actors; "but I fear there is
such a run of luck against the unfortunate Lieutenant, that he will hardly dare
to try again. Positively it is cruel to ask him."</p>
<p>The young officer looked up, with a flush upon his beardless face. He was a
very young bird to endeavour to hold his own among these seasoned old vampires.
It was evident from the way in which they glanced round at him when
Grossi&egrave;re made the remark, that he had been elected as the butt of the
company.</p>
<p>"What if I <i>have</i> bad luck?" he said. "It's all fair play and the
fortune of war. I'll try again."</p>
<p>And he drank down a tumbler of champagne to try and drown the vision of a
little woman down at Montpellier, in the sunny south, who was scraping and
saving in order to keep her handsome boy like a gentleman in Paris.</p>
<p>"That's right! Pluckily said!" went up the chorus of voices from around the
table.</p>
<p>"Don't drink your wine like that, though," said Cachet. "You'll make
yourself unsteady."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid our military friend is unsteady already," remarked Lablas.</p>
<p>"Not at all, monsieur," said the young Lieutenant. "My hand is as steady as
your own."</p>
<p>"There is no hand in Paris as steady as my own, young man," returned Lablas.
"Lallacourt, of your own regiment, could tell you as much. You were with me,
Cachet, when I shot away his trigger finger at Vincennes. I stopped his pistol
shooting for ever and a day. Do you perceive a little dark spot which is fixed
in the centre of the white sheet at the other side of the room? It is the head
of a fusee, a mark which I generally use for the purpose of practice, as there
can be no doubt as to whether you have struck it or not. You will excuse the
smell of gunpowder, messieurs?" he continued, taking a small and
highly-finished pistol from a rack upon the wall.</p>
<p>He seemed hardly to glance along the sights; but as he pulled the trigger,
there was a crack and spurt of flame from the other side of the room, and the
fusee, struck by the bullet, was scattered in burning splinters upon the
floor.</p>
<p>"I hardly think you will venture to state that your hand is as steady as
mine for the future," he added, glancing towards the young officer, as he
replaced the dainty weapon in its stand upon the wall.</p>
<p>"It was a good shot, sir," returned the other.</p>
<p>"Hang the shooting!" said Grossi&egrave;re, rattling up the dice. "If you
want your revenge, Lieutenant, now is your time!"</p>
<p>And once again money began to change hands, while a hush in the talk showed
how all interest was concentrated upon the table. Lablas did not play, but he
hovered round the green baize like some evil spirit, with his hard smile upon
his lips, and his cold eye bent upon the man who was at once his guest and his
dupe.</p>
<p>Poor lad! No wonder he lost when all were combining to play against him. He
pushed his chair back at last in despair.</p>
<p>"It is useless!" he said. "The luck is against me! But, gentlemen," he
added, beseechingly, "if I can raise a little money tomorrow, even though it be
only a little, you will not refuse to play the same stakes&mdash;you will give
me a chance?"</p>
<p>"We will play just exactly as long as your little lasts!" said Turville,
with a brutal laugh.</p>
<p>The young officer was flushed and excited. He sat apart from the others, and
seemed to hear the talk which ensued as in a dream. He had an uneasy feeling
that all had not been fair, and yet, do what he would, he could not give one
proof to the contrary.</p>
<p>"Pass over the wine," said Grossi&egrave;re. "Where were you till one
o'clock, Lablas?"</p>
<p>Lablas showed his white teeth in a smile.</p>
<p>"The old story, I suppose?" said Turville.</p>
<p>"Bah! It is becoming too old a story," resumed Grossi&egrave;re. "A story
without change or variety is apt to become monotonous. One intrigue is as like
another as a pair of small swords, and success is always the end of them."</p>
<p>"They are too easily won," assented Cachet.</p>
<p>"I promise you this will not be too easily won," said Lablas. "Though she is
a quarry worth flying for, as she is as beautiful as an angel, she is strictly
preserved too; and there is a six-foot brother acting as gamekeeper, so there
is a prospect of some little excitement."</p>
<p>"Have you made any advance yet?" asked Cachet.</p>
<p>"No; I have taken a few preliminary observations, however," returned the
<i>rou&eacute;.</i> "I fear it must be done by force, and it will need both
courage and tact."</p>
<p>"Who is the girl, Lablas?" said Turville.</p>
<p>"That I won't answer."</p>
<p>"Come, do tell us her name."</p>
<p>"Curiosity sometimes verges on impertinence," said Lablas, looking from
under his eyebrows at his brother actor. "Take care that you do not cross the
border, for I never tolerate a liberty."</p>
<p>Turville was a brave man enough, but he sank his eyes before the fiery
glance of the practised duellist.</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence, and then Lablas stretched out his hand and
said, "Come, Turville, forgive and forget. I didn't mean to speak hastily, but
you know my cursed temper. There, I can say no more. After all, there is no
reason why I should not give you the name. I may need your assistance; and, in
any case, you are men of honour, and would not thwart me in my plans. I don't
suppose any of you know her. Her name is Rose Latour, and she lives in the Rue
Bertrand.</p>
<p>"What? The sister of Henry Latour?" cried Grossi&egrave;re. "Yes, the same.
Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Know him? Why he plays <i>Laertes</i> to your <i>Hamlet</i> on Monday
night.'"</p>
<p>"The deuce he does!"</p>
<p>"Yes, old Lambertin closed with him last night. This will be a pretty
complication! As good a fellow as ever breathed."</p>
<p>"I don't see that that affects the question of my carrying off his
sister."</p>
<p>"I know the girl, too&mdash;as chaste as she is beautiful. You'll never
succeed there, Lablas. She is an angel upon earth, and her brother is not the
man to be trifled with."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," said Lablas, "don't you see that every word you say is
strengthening my resolution? As you said just now, intrigues become monotonous.
There is some variety about an abduction."</p>
<p>"You will fail," said Grossi&egrave;re.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I shall succeed."</p>
<p>"I would stake my head that you will fail."</p>
<p>"If you are willing to stake ten thousand francs, it will be more to the
purpose. Shall it be a bet, and I claim twenty-four hours only in which to
carry the little Puritan off."</p>
<p>"Done!" responded the comedian.</p>
<p>"You are my witnesses, messieurs," said Lablas, turning to the company, and
entering the figures in an ivory writing-tablet.</p>
<p>There was a hush as he wrote, and then a youthful voice broke the
silence.</p>
<p>"I will be no partner to this!" it said.</p>
<p>It was the young officer.</p>
<p>He had risen from his chair, and was standing opposite Lablas.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of surprise among the actors as their butt and plaything
rose up and dared the arch-spirit of them all. They would have saved him if
they could. Cachet grasped him by the sleeve, and half pulled him down.</p>
<p>"Sit down!" he whispered,&mdash;"sit down! He is the deadliest shot in
France!"</p>
<p>"I will not sit down!" said the soldier. "I protest against this! If the
young lady's helplessness and virtue are powerless to screen her, surely the
fact that her brother is your fellow-actor should suffice to save her from your
insulting wager."</p>
<p>Lablas never raised his eyes from the book in which he was writing.</p>
<p>"How long," he said, in the cold, measured voice which those who had heard
it knew to be more dangerous than the bully's shout,&mdash;"how long have you
turned moralist, Monsieur Malpas?"</p>
<p>"I have not turned moralist. I simply remain a gentleman, a title which I
regret to say that you have forfeited."</p>
<p>"Indeed! You become personal."</p>
<p>"I don't pretend to be immaculate; far from it. But, so help me Heaven!
nothing in the whole world would induce me to be an accomplice in such a
cold-blooded, villainous seduction!"</p>
<p>There was a brave ring in the lad's voice as he spoke, and all the fire of
the chivalrous South sparkled in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I only regret," he continued, "that your confiding your plans to our honour
before revealing them will prevent my helping to frustrate them."</p>
<p>"Dear, innocent youth!" sneered Lablas. "I think I see the cause of your
conversion to morality. You have some intentions in that quarter yourself,
<i>mon cher.</i> Is it not so?"</p>
<p>"You lie, and you know that you lie!" said the soldier. "Here, hold
him&mdash;hold his arms, Cachet! Pull him back! Don't let them brawl like
roughs!"</p>
<p>"Let me go, I say!" yelled Lablas. "He called me a liar! I'll have his
life!"</p>
<p>"To-morrow, my dear fellow&mdash;to-morrow," said Grossi&egrave;re. "We will
see that you have every satisfaction."</p>
<p>"There is my card," said the Lieutenant, as he threw it down upon the table.
"You shall find me ready whenever it is convenient to you. Capitaine Haut
shares my rooms; he will act as my friend. Adieu, gentlemen!&mdash;<i>au
revoir,</i> monsieur!"</p>
<p>And the young fellow turned on his heel, and swaggered gallantly out of the
room, leaving his money behind him.</p>
<p>In spite of his faults, the old lady in Montpellier would not have been
ashamed of her son if she could have seen him then.</p>
<p>"You will call upon his friend to-morrow, Cachet," said Lablas, grimly. "In
the meantime, to business. Can I rely upon your help in the matter of the
girl&mdash;and yours, Turville?"</p>
<p>"We will do all we can."</p>
<p>"Well, I had a good look at the house to-night. It is a simple two-storey
one, and she sleeps alone in one of the upper rooms. So much I gathered, partly
from observation, and partly from the servant. They go to bed early, and there
is only the brother and the old lady in the house. They have no shutters to the
bedrooms&mdash;only blinds."</p>
<p>"What will be your mode of action?"</p>
<p>"It is easy enough. You know the street is a very quiet one. We'll take my
closed carriage; one of us can drive. Then, as you know, I have a ladder in
three pieces for such little affairs. It can be brought with us. We leave the
carriage; put up our ladder, open her window, gag her in her sleep, carry her
down, and it is done. If she is awake and screams, surely the three of us can
knock her brother on the head. They will have no clue as to who we are, or
where we have gone. It will be a splendid triumph."</p>
<p>"So it will;" and the three men laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"The little prude! She will be tractable enough soon, I warrant. Well, I
must be steady to-morrow, so I had better turn in for a few hours. I shall want
you in the Rue Bertrand about two o'clock on Monday morning. They go to bed at
eleven. Good night." And, throwing his half-finished cigar into the fire, the
profligate actor sauntered out of the room, leaving his associates to discuss
the diabolical deed in which they were called upon to assist.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>It is strange how naturally Englishmen adapt themselves to the customs of
the country in which they happen to be placed&mdash;more especially when those
customs happen to accord with their own inclinations.</p>
<p>At home I am a rigid Churchman enough; but on that Parisian Sunday, the
still small voice of conscience was even stiller and smaller than usual, as I
sauntered round to the Rue Bertrand to see if my new friend, Henry Latour,
would have pity on my loneliness, and venture out for a stroll.</p>
<p>Possibly the fair Rose had more to do with my visit than her brother; but,
if so, I was disappointed, as that young lady had just tripped off to church,
and I was compelled to put up with the male element of the household.</p>
<p>"You couldn't possibly have done better than come," said Henry, as he
stretched his tall frame in a stupendous yawn. "I have been sitting in this
confounded chair, making sure of my part, ever since breakfast, and I think I
am right at last. I have been doing the <i>quarte tierce</i> business too with
the poker, in preparation for the last scene. You know I used to be an
excellent fencer, and it always brings down the house."</p>
<p>"I suppose your <i>Hamlet</i> can fence?" I remarked.</p>
<p>"He is notorious for it," Henry answered, as a dark shade passed over his
handsome face. "But come, Barker; it's my last free day for some time to come,
so we must make the most of it."<br>
<br></p>
<p>We certainly did make the most of it, and the young actor proved himself to
be an admirable cicerone, doing the honours of picture galleries and museums
with an amusing air of proprietorship. He was in excellent spirits about his
engagement at the National, to which he often referred as being a splendid
opening.</p>
<p>"There's only one drawback," he remarked, "and that is having to play second
fiddle to that unmitigated scoundrel, Lablas. He is a profligate fellow,
Barker. This very morning they say that he fought a duel in the Bois de
Boulogne; shot a young officer of cavalry through the lungs. I shall have a
quarrel with him, I fear; for, as <i>Hamlet</i> says, 'There is something
sensitive in me,' and the man's manner jars upon me more than I can tell."</p>
<p>It was dark by this time, and we were both somewhat fatigued and hungry
after our long peregrination.</p>
<p>"There's a <i>caf&eacute;</i> here," said Henry, "on the right-hand side,
close to the railway station, where we can have a quiet little meal. That's it
where the lights are. Shall we try it?"</p>
<p>"All right," I said. And we turned to enter.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, a tall young fellow, with a carpet-bag in his hand, who
was coming out, ran against us.</p>
<p>"Pardon, messieurs," he said, turning half round and bowing, and was about
to pass on, when Henry sprang forward, and caught him by the arm.</p>
<p>"Jack, my boy, where in the world did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Henry, and Barker, by all that is astonishing!" said the voice of my old
college friend, Jack Latour, as he seized us alternately by the hand. "Why,
what an extraordinary thing!"</p>
<p>"Extraordinary, indeed," cried his brother. "Why, we thought you were in
Edinburgh, hundreds of miles away!"</p>
<p>"So I ought to be; but it struck me yesterday that a change of air would do
me good. The insolent familiarity of the British tradesman was beginning to
prey upon my mind. My tailor was exhibiting an increased hankering after his
filthy lucre, so I thought I would deprive him for a few weeks of the refining
influence of my society."</p>
<p>"The old game, Jack," said I.</p>
<p>"Yes, the old game; and I conclude you fellows are up to the old game, since
I find you mooning about the first 'pub' I pass&mdash;I beg pardon,
<i>caf&eacute;. Caf&eacute;</i> sounds better than 'pub'."</p>
<p>"How do you account for your own presence here?" laughed Henry.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, you don't seriously suppose that I came in search of
bibulous refreshment? No; it was a harmless eccentricity which led me within
these walls. What do you fellows intend to do with yourselves? There is no use
my knocking up Rose and the mother to-night, so I shall stay with you."</p>
<p>"We have nothing particular to do," I said.</p>
<p>"Then come up to the 'Anglais' with me. Two Edinburgh men are up
there&mdash;Grant and Buckley. Will you come?"</p>
<p>"I am willing," said I.</p>
<p>"And I," said Henry.</p>
<p>So the bargain was concluded, and we all three repaired to the hotel, where
we were introduced to Jack's friends, a couple of reckless, light-hearted
medical students of his own kidney.</p>
<p>There is no reason why I should dwell upon the convivial evening which
ensued. I have only alluded to these things as influencing the dark events
which were impending.</p>
<p>It was close upon one o'clock before Henry Latour glanced at his watch, and
announced that it was high time to break up.</p>
<p>"I must run over my part again to-morrow," he said. "You come along with me,
Jack, and we can sleep together without disturbing anyone. I have a key."</p>
<p>"I'll walk round with you," said I; "I want to finish my pipe."</p>
<p>I am afraid that the sight of a certain window was becoming dearer to me
than all the tobacco Virginia ever grew.</p>
<p>The brothers were delighted that I should come, so we bade our fellow
countrymen adieu, and set off together.</p>
<p>We were a hilarious party as long as we kept to the well-lit Boulevards, but
when we got into the quiet streets which branch off from them, a curious
feeling of depression stole over us, which affected even the irrepressible
Jack.</p>
<p>We strode on together, each buried in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Everything was very still&mdash;so still that we all looked up in surprise
when a closed carriage rattled past us, going in our own direction.</p>
<p>"That fellow is driving at a deuce of a rate," remarked Jack. "Without
lights either," I said.</p>
<p>"I wonder where he can be bound for? This is not much of a carriage
neighbourhood, especially at such an hour."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, he isn't going to visit us," laughed Henry; "so it's no
business of ours."</p>
<p>And so saying, he quickened his pace, and we all three rounded the corner,
and passed into the Rue Bertrand.</p>
<p>We were hardly round, before Jack stopped in amazement. "Why, Harry!" he
said; "what on earth is this? They just exactly <i>are</i> visiting us!"</p>
<p>There was no doubt about it. The moon had just come from behind a cloud, and
was pouring a flood of cold light upon the dingy little street. And there, away
down opposite number twenty-two, was a dark blur, which could be nothing but
the carriage. It had pulled up.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Henry.</p>
<p>"There are a couple of men on the pavement!"</p>
<p>"One of them has a lantern!"</p>
<p>"What a lark!" cried Jack. "It's my Edinburgh tailor, for a dollar!"</p>
<p>"They can't be burglars!" I whispered. "Let us watch them for a bit."</p>
<p>"By Heaven, there's ladder against a window&mdash;against Rose's window!"
hissed a voice which we could hardly recognise as Henry's it was so
altered.</p>
<p>The light fell upon his face, and I could see that it was dark with wrath,
and that his jaw was fixed and hard, while his features worked
spasmodically.</p>
<p>"The villains!" he said. "Come after me, but quietly!" Swiftly and silently
he started down the street.</p>
<p>Jack's rage was as great as his brother's, but he was of a less fiery
disposition. He ground his teeth, and followed Henry with giant strides.</p>
<p>Had I been alone, I should have shouted my indignation, and hurried forward
to the rescue. Henry Latour's was the leading mind among us, however, and it is
on such occasions that mind asserts itself. There was something terrible in his
very stillness.</p>
<p>We followed him implicitly down the road.</p>
<p>Rain had fallen during the evening, and the ground was very soft.</p>
<p>We made little noise as we approached the carriage. We might have made more
without fear of detection, for the horses had been left to themselves, and the
men we had seen were in the front garden, too much occupied with their own
movements and those of their leader to be easily disturbed. The Rue de Bertrand
was a <i>cul de sac,</i> and the possibility of being disturbed at their work
was so slight as to be disregarded.</p>
<p>Henry slipped behind the carriage, and we followed him. We were effectually
concealed, and commanded a view of all that was going on in front of us.</p>
<p>Two of the men were standing at the foot of a ladder which was reared
against one of the upper windows.</p>
<p>They were watching the movements of a third who appeared at that moment at
the open casement bearing something on his arms.</p>
<p>My blood seemed to run in a fiery torrent through my veins as I saw the man
place his foot upon the upper step and begin to descend. I glanced at Henry,
but he held up his hand as if to ask for one more moment's forbearance. I could
see that he knew as well as I did what the poor little white burden was which
the man was clasping to his breast. I had lost sight of Jack, but a smothered
curse from between the wheels showed me where he was crouching.</p>
<p>The leader came slowly and gingerly down the ladder. He must have been a
powerful fellow, for the additional weight did not seem to inconvenience him.
We could see that his face was covered with a mask. His friends below kept
encouraging him in whispers.</p>
<p>He reached the bottom without an accident.</p>
<p>"Hurry her into the carriage!" he said.</p>
<p>Henry rose silently to his feet, with every muscle braced. The time for
action had arrived.</p>
<p>And at this very moment the prisoner's gag must have slipped, for a sweet,
piteous voice rang out on the still night,&mdash;"Harry! Brother! Help!"</p>
<p>Never, surely, was an appeal so promptly answered. The spring was so swift,
so sudden, that I never saw him leave my side. I heard a snarl like a wild
beast's and a dull thud, and my friend with the man in the mask were rolling on
the ground together.</p>
<p>It all happened in less time than I take to tell it. Jack and I ran forward
to assist Rose into the house; but we were confronted by the two
confederates.</p>
<p>I would have passed my antagonist in order to help the lady, but he flew at
me with a savage oath, hitting wildly with both hands.</p>
<p>A Frenchman can never realise the fact that a segment is shorter than an
arc; but I gave my opponent a practical illustration of the fact by stopping
him with a facer before he could bring his hands round, and then toppling him
over with what is known to the initiated as a Cribb's hit behind the ear.</p>
<p>He sat down upon a rose-bush with a very sickly smile, and manifested a
strong disinclination to rise up; so I turned my attention to Jack.</p>
<p>I was just in time to see his adversary make a desperate attempt to practice
the barbarous French <i>savate</i> upon him; but the student was a man of
expedients, and springing aside, he seized the uplifted foot, and gave it a
wrench, which brought the discomfited owner howling to the ground with a
dislocated leg.</p>
<p>We led poor trembling Rose into the house, and after handing her over to her
frightened mother, hurried back into the garden.</p>
<p>Neither of our acquaintances were in a condition to come up to time; but the
struggle between their leader and Henry Latour was going on with unabated
vigour.</p>
<p>It was useless to attempt to help our friend. They were so entwined, and
revolving so rapidly upon the gravel walk, that it was impossible to
distinguish the one from the other.</p>
<p>They were fighting in silence, and each was breathing hard.</p>
<p>But the clean living of the younger man began to tell. He had the better
stamina of the two.</p>
<p>I saw the glint of the moonlight upon his sleeve-links as he freed his arm,
and then I heard the sound of a heavy blow. It seemed to stun his antagonist
for a moment; but before it could be repeated he had shaken himself free, and
both men staggered to their feet.</p>
<p>The mask had been torn off, and exposed the pale face of the Frenchman, with
a thin stream of blood coursing down it from a wound on the forehead.</p>
<p>"You infernal scoundrel! I know you now!" yelled Henry, and would have
sprung at him again had we not restrained him.</p>
<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> you'll know me better before you die!" hissed the man, with
a sinister smile.</p>
<p>"You accursed villain! do you think I fear your threats? I'll fight you now
if you wish; I have weapons! Run in for the pistols, Jack!"</p>
<p>"Quietly, old man&mdash;quietly," said I; "don't do anything rash."</p>
<p>"Rash!" raved Henry. "Why, man, it was my sister! Give me a pistol!"</p>
<p>"It is for me to name the time and place," said Lablas; for he it was. "It
is I who have been struck."</p>
<p>"When, then?"</p>
<p>"You shall hear from me in the morning. Suffice it that you shall be
chastised before all Paris. I shall make a public warning of you, my young
friend."</p>
<p>And with the same hard smile upon his face, he mounted upon the box, and
seized the reins.</p>
<p>"If this gentleman whose joint I have had the pleasure of damaging considers
himself aggrieved," said Jack, "he shall always find me ready to make any
amends in my power."</p>
<p>"The same applies to my friend on the right," said I. "I refer to the
gentleman with the curious swelling under his ear."</p>
<p>Our friends only answered our kind attentions by a volley of curses.</p>
<p>The patron of the <i>savate</i> was hoisted into the carriage, and the other
followed him; while Lablas, still white with passion, drove furiously off, amid
laughter from Jack and myself and curses from Henry, whose fiery blood was too
thoroughly roused to allow him to view the matter in its ridiculous aspect.</p>
<p>"Nothing like evaporating lotions for bruises," was the practical piece of
advice which our medical student shouted after them as the carriage rumbled
away like a dark nightmare, and the sound of its wheels died gradually in the
distance.</p>
<p>At this moment a gendarme, true to the traditions of his order, hurried on
to the scene of action; but after jotting down the number of the house in a
portentous note-book, he gave up the attempt of extracting any information from
us, and departed with many shrugs.</p>
<p>My heart was heavy as I trudged back to my hotel that night. There is always
a reaction after such excitement, and I wasuneasy at the thought of what the
morrow might bring forth.</p>
<p>The allusion which Henry had made in the early part of the evening to the
duelling proclivities of Lablas, and in particular to the sinister result of
his encounter with the young French officer, had not been forgotten by me.</p>
<p>I knew the wild blood which ran in my friend's veins, and that it would be
hopeless to attempt to dissuade him from a meeting. I was powerless, and must
let events take their own course.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>When I came down to breakfast in the morning I found the two brothers
waiting for me. Henry looked bright and almost exultant as he greeted me, but
Jack was unusually serious.</p>
<p>"It's all right, old fellow," said the young actor.</p>
<p>"Yes; look here, Barker," explained Jack, evidently in considerable
perturbation. "It's a most extraordinary business. The queerest challenge I
ever heard of, though I confess that my experience of these things is very
limited. I suppose we cannot get out of it?"</p>
<p>"Not for the world!" cried his brother.</p>
<p>"See here," said Jack; "this is the note I got. Read it for yourself."</p>
<p>It was addressed to the student, and ran thus:&mdash;<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Sir,&mdash;</p>
<p>"On the understanding that you act as second to Mr. Henry Latour, allow me
to state that in the exercise of his right M. Lablas selects rapiers as his
weapon. He begs you to accompany your principal to the theatre to-night, where
you will be admitted to the stage as a supernumerary. You can thus satisfy
yourself that the final scene is fought according to the strict rules of the
duello. The rapiers will be substituted for stage foils without difficulty. I
shall be present on behalf of M. Lablas. I have the honour to remain very
sincerely yours,</p>
<p>"PIERRE GROSSIERE."<br>
<br></p>
<p>"What do you think of that?" said Jack.</p>
<p>"Why, I think that it is a preposterous idea, and that you should
refuse."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't do," said Henry. "They would try and construe it into
cowardice. Besides, what does it matter where I meet the fellow so long as I
<i>do</i> meet him? I tell you, Barker," he continued, laying his hand upon my
arm, "that when I do, I intend to kill him!"</p>
<p>There was something resolute in the ring of my friend's voice. I felt that,
in spite of his advantages, Lablas would meet with a dangerous opponent.</p>
<p>"If you should fall, Henry," said Jack, "I will take your place, and either
lick the blackguard or never leave the stage. It would make a sensation to have
<i>Hamlet</i> run through by a super-numerary, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>And he gave the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>"Well, write an acceptance at once, Jack," said Henry. "My only fear is that
my sister's name should get mixed up in the matter."</p>
<p>"No fear of that," said I. "It would not be their interest to talk about the
ridiculous <i>fiasco</i> they have made."</p>
<p>"You will come to the National to-night, Barker?" asked Henry. "You can get
a place in the front row of the stalls."</p>
<p>"I will," said I; "and if you should both fail to avenge your sister, Lablas
will have to reckon with me before the curtain falls."</p>
<p>"You are a good fellow, Barker," said Henry. "Well," he added, after a
pause, "my private quarrel mustn't interfere with my duty to the public, so
I'll go back and read my part over. Good-bye, old man! We shall see you
to-night."</p>
<p>And the brothers left me alone to my coffee.</p>
<p>How they got through the day I do not know. I should think even
imperturbable Jack found the hours hung rather heavily upon his hands.</p>
<p>As for myself, I was in a fever of suspense. I could only pace up and down
the crowded streets, and wait for the evening to come.</p>
<p>The doors did not open until seven o'clock, but the half-hour found me
waiting at the entrance to the National.</p>
<p>A knot of enthusiasts, eager to secure places, were already clustering round
it. I spent the time in perusing a poster, which was suspended to one of the
pillars.</p>
<p>"Lablas" was written across it in great capitals, while in smaller print
below there were a few other names, that of Henry Latour being one of them.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the door would never open. There is an end to all things,
however, and the hour struck at last. We filed into the theatre one after
another, in the orderly French fashion.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to secure what I wanted&mdash;namely, a centre seat
in the front row.</p>
<p>Nothing but the orchestra intervened between me and the footlights. I would
have given anything to have seen Jack now&mdash;to have had anyone with whom I
could exchange a word on the topic which was nearest my heart; but my immediate
neighbours were a stolid English manager, who had come over in the hope of
picking up something worth imparting, and an enthusiastic young lady with her
elderly mamma.</p>
<p>I had learned, even in our short acquaintance, to regard Henry as a dear
friend; but I think it was the idea of his sister which gave me such a sinking
at the heart, when I thought of the deadly science and diabolical
vindictiveness of Lablas.</p>
<p>During the overture I was far too preoccupied to pay much attention to my
neighbour the manager, who was pouring into my ears his views of the French
stage.</p>
<p>"We can't approach them on 'touch-and-go' comedy," he said; "it's their
strong point; but when it comes to Shakespeare, they are lost,
sir&mdash;utterly lost. If you had seen the <i>Hamlets</i> I have
seen&mdash;Macready, sir, and the older Kean&mdash;"</p>
<p>But here his reminiscences were providentially cut short by the rise of the
curtain.</p>
<p>The first few scenes were tame enough. The translation lacked the rugged
strength and force of our own glorious language. Old theatre goers became
restless in their seats, and whispered that there was something amiss with
their favourite actor.</p>
<p>His eye seemed to rest upon me with a dark and threatening scowl. The black,
tight-fitting dress showed off his splendid figure to advantage, and was
admirably adapted, as I could not help thinking, for the second and more tragic
part which he was about to play.</p>
<p>My spirits revived when Henry entered. He looked cool and at his ease,
though I could see a dangerous light in his eye when he glanced towards his
brother actor.</p>
<p>The spirit and fire of his elocution semed to captivate his hearers. From
pit to gallery there was not one who did not sympathise with the gallant young
Danish nobleman, and he was applauded to the echo.</p>
<p><i>Hamlet</i> was forgotten in <i>Laertes</i>. I shall never forget the
torrent of indignation which rang out in the words&mdash;</p>
<p>"A sister driven into desperate terms.<br>
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br>
Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br>
For her perfections. But my revenge will come."</p>
<p>"By Jove, sir!" said the manager, <i>sotto voce;</i> "those last words were
nature itself."</p>
<p>Henry was called before the curtain at the end of the fourth act; but it was
in the scene at <i>Ophelia's</i> grave that he surpassed himself. His howl of
"The devil take thy soul!" as <i>he</i> sprang at <i>Hamlet's</i> throat,
fairly brought down the house, and caused me involuntarily to spring to my
feet; but he seemed to recollect himself in time, and shook himself clear of
his rival.</p>
<p><i>Hamlet's</i> invective, too was the strongest point in his character. The
vast audience seemed to hang on every word which passed between them.</p>
<p>"You'll get an English actor to make more stage points," said the manager;
"but there's a confounded naturalness about all this which is wonderful!"</p>
<p>His dramatic instinct had told him that, in spite of his forty years'
experience, there was something here which he had never met before.</p>
<p>And now there was a great hush in the house as the curtain rose upon the
final scene. It was magnificently put upon the stage. The rude, barbaric pomp
of the Danish Court was pictured to the life. The king and queen were seated in
the background, under a canopy of purple velvet, lined with ermine. The walls
of the royal banquet-hall were gorgeous with strange trophies, supposed to have
been brought from afar by Viking hands.</p>
<p>There was a clear space in the centre, and at either side a swarm of
men-at-arms, courtiers, and all the hangers-on of the royal household.</p>
<p><i>Laertes</i> was leaning carelessly against a pillar, while <i>Hamlet</i>
stood with a smile of confidence upon his face, conversing with a courtier.</p>
<p>Beside <i>Laertes</i> I could see Jack Latour, got up in a suit of armour
which was ridiculously out of proportion to his brawny limbs. There was a look
upon his face, however, that would have forbidden a laugh at his expense.</p>
<p>To me the excitement was agonising, and all over the house a strange
interest began to manifest itself in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Not a sound could be heard over the great theatre as <i>Osric</i> came
tripping forward with the bundle of foils.</p>
<p>I surmised that the rapiers were lying among them, for <i>Hamlet</i> took
some little time to satisfy himself, though <i>Laertes</i> seemed to choose his
weapon without a moment's hesitation.</p>
<p>"Gad!" said the manager; "look at the man's eyes! I tell you it's
unique!"</p>
<p>The salute was given, and the courtier with whom Lablas had been speaking
drew up to his principal, while Jack took up his position behind his
brother.</p>
<p>His honest face was pale with anxiety, and I could see that instead of the
double-edged Danish sword, he had a delicate rapier slung to his side. I knew
what was meant by that.</p>
<p>I turned away my eyes as the two men approached each other; but I glanced
round again involuntarily as I heard a quick stamp, and the sharp ring of
steel.</p>
<p>The silence was so profound that you might have heard the breathing of the
combatants at the extreme end of the pit.</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse of the dark, savage face of Lablas, and the tall, lithe
figure of his antagonist, and I turned my eyes away again from sheer
nervousness.</p>
<p>Then there came a 'momentary cessation in the clash of the swords, and I
heard the manager say, "The deception is admirable. You'd swear there was blood
running down the leg of <i>Laertes.</i> Capital! capital! The business is
perfect!"</p>
<p>I shuddered, and looked up again as they sprang at each other for the second
time, and my eyes were riveted upon the stage for the remainder of the
conflict.</p>
<p>The combatants were very evenly matched; first one, and then the other,
seemed to gain a temporary advantage. The profound science of Lablas was
neutralised by the fire and fury of his antagonist's attack.</p>
<p>I could see from Henry's face that he had determined to bring matters to a
crisis. To kill or be killed had become his one idea.</p>
<p>He rushed at his opponent so furiously that he drove him back among the
crowd of courtiers. I saw Lablas give a deadly lunge under the guard, which
Henry took through his left arm; and then I saw my friend spring in, and there
was a groan and a spurt of blood as <i>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,</i> tottered
forwards to the footlights and fell heavily upon his face.</p>
<p>The effect upon the audience was electrical. There was a hush for a moment,
and then, from pit to boxes, and from boxes to gallery, there went up a cheer
so spontaneous and so universal, that it was like the mighty voice of one man.
The whole house sprang to its feet with round after round of applause.</p>
<p>It was the finest illusion of the year&mdash;it was the best <i>coup de
theatre,</i> and most realistic stage duel that had ever been fought. But the
English manager shuddered as he caught me convulsively by the wrist, and said,
in an awe-struck whisper, <i>"I saw it come out at his back</i>!"</p>
<p>Yes, it was the finest illusion of the year; and still the audience
applauded and applauded.</p>
<p>Surely he will rise and bow his acknowledgments? One more cheer may do it.
But no; he lies there stiff and stark, with a scowl upon his white face, and
his life-blood trickling down the boards.</p>
<p>And now there is a hot, heavy smell in the orchestra, which was surely never
caused by a stage illusion. Why is that young man gesticulating so? A little
crimson pool has trickled upon his music book, and he sees that it is still
dripping down, liquid and warm.</p>
<p>And a hush comes over the pit, while the boxes are still applauding; and
then the boxes grow quiet, and strange whispers go about. Then the audience
above become silent, too, and a great stillness falls upon the theatre, and the
heavy brown curtain is rolled down.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Well, my boy," said Jack, when I met him, "it was all very terrible, but it
ended right."</p>
<p>"Won't there be an inquiry into the matter?"</p>
<p>"No, not a bit. The initiated know that it was all fair play, and the rest
are under the impression that a button slipped, or a foil snapped. Henry's name
as an actor is made for ever&mdash;that's some consolation."</p>
<p>"How is he?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, well enough to see company. You must come along and dine with us. He
has a slight wound in the leg, and is run through the biceps; but there is no
damage done. Rose and the mother are terribly cut up, but, of course, they
think it was all an accident. They shall never know the truth."</p>
<p>And now, before I conclude, let me sketch another scene. It is that solemn
and orthodox ritual with which fiction usually, and fact occasionally, as in
the present instance, terminates. A man and a woman are kneeling at the foot of
an altar, while a clergyman is pronouncing the words that refute the
commonly-received doctrine that one and one are two. You will have no
difficulty in recognising the pretty little girlish bride; she is altered but
little since we saw her six months ago. The bride-groom is&mdash;No, most
astute and sagacious reader, it is <i>not</i> myself; it is a young French
officer of cavalry, with a boyish smile, and the scar of a bullet upon his left
breast.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>THE LONELY HAMPSHIRE COTTAGE</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Cassell's Saturday Journal,</i> 2 May 1885.</h3>
<hr>
<p>John Ranter, ex-landlord of the "Battle of Dettingen" public-house in
Southampton, was not a man whom one would desire as a friend, and still less
would one relish him as a foe. Tall and strong in his person, dark and
saturnine in his disposition, the two-and-fifty years which had passed over
John's head had done little to soften his character or to modify his passions.
Perhaps the ill-fortune which had attended him through life had something to do
with his asperity, yet this same ill-fortune had been usually caused by his own
violent and headstrong temper. He had quarrelled with his parents when a lad,
and left them. After working his way up in the world, to some extent, he had
fallen in love with a pretty face, and mated himself to a timid, characterless
woman, who was a drag rather than a help to him. The fruit of this union had
been a single son; but John Ranter beat the lad savagely for some trivial
offence, and he had fled away to sea as a cabin-boy, and was reported to have
been drowned in the great wreck of the <i>Queen of the West.</i> From that time
the publican went rapidly down-hill. He offended his customers by his morose
and sullen temper, and they ceased to frequent the "Battle of Dettingen,"
until, at last, he was compelled to dispose of the business. With the scanty
proceeds he purchased a small house upon the Portsmouth and Southampton road,
about three miles from the latter town, and settled down with his wife to a
gloomy and misanthropic existence.</p>
<p>Strange tales were told of that lonely cottage, with its bare brick walls
and great, overhanging thatch, from under which the diamond-paned windows
seemed to scowl at the passers-by. Waggoners at roadside inns talked of the
dark-faced, grizzly-haired man, who lounged all day in the little garden which
adjoined the road, and of the pale, patient face, which peered out at them
sometimes through the half-opened door. There were darker things, too, of which
they had to speak, of angry voices, of the dull thud of blows, and the cries of
a woman in distress. However tired the horses might be, they were whipped up
into a trot, when, after nightfall, they came near the wooden gate which led up
to that ill-omened dwelling.</p>
<p>It was one lovely autumn evening that John Ranter leaned his elbows upon
that identical gate, and puffed meditatively at his black clay pipe. He was
pondering within himself as to what his future should be. Should he continue to
exist in the way in which he was doing, or should he embark what little capital
he had in some attempt to better his fortunes? His present life, if
unambitious, was at least secure. It was possible that he might lose all in a
new venture. Yet, on the other hand, John felt that he still had all the energy
of youth, and was as able as ever to turn his hand to anything. If his son, he
reflected, who had left him fifteen years before had been alive, he might have
been of assistance to him now. A vague longing for the comforts which he had
enjoyed in more fortunate days filled and unsetttled his mind. He was still
brooding over the matter when, looking up, he saw, against the setting sun, a
man dressed in a long grey overcoat, who was striding down the road from the
direction of Southampton.</p>
<p>It was no uncommon thing for pedestrians of every type to pass the door of
John Ranter, and yet this particular one attracted his attention to an unusual
degree. He was a tall, athletic young fellow, with a yellow moustache, and a
face which was tanned by exposure to the sun and weather. His hat was a
peculiar slouched one, of soft felt, and it may have been this, or it may have
been the grey coat, which caused the ex-publican to look closely at him. Over
his shoulder the stranger had a broad leather strap, and to this was attached a
large black bag, something like those which are worn by bookmakers upon a
race-course. Indeed, John Ranter's first impression was that the traveller
belonged to the betting fraternity.</p>
<p>When the young fellow came near the gate, he slowed down his pace, and
looked irresolutely about him. Then he halted, and addressed John, speaking in
a peculiar metallic voice.</p>
<p>"I say, mate," he said; "I guess I'd have to walk all night if I wanted to
make Portsmouth in the morning?"</p>
<p>"I guess you would," the other answered, surlily, mimicking the stranger's
tone and pronunciation. "You've hardly got started yet."</p>
<p>"Well now, that beats everything," the traveller said, impatiently. "I'd ha'
put up at an inn in Southampton if I dared. To think o' my spending my first
night in the old country like that!"</p>
<p>"And why dar'n't you put up at an inn?" John Ranter asked.</p>
<p>The stranger winked one of his shrewd eyes at John.</p>
<p>"There ain't such a very long way between an innkeeper and a thief," he
said; "anyway, there's not in Californey, and I guess human natur' is human
natur' all the world over. When I've got what's worth keepin' I give the inns a
wide berth."</p>
<p>"Oh, you've got what's worth keeping, have you?" said the old misanthrope to
himself, and he relaxed the grimness of his features as far as he could, and
glanced out of the corner of his eyes at the black leather bag.</p>
<p>"Ye see, it's this way," the young man said, confidentially; "I've been out
at the diggings, first in Nevada and then in Californey, and I've struck it,
and struck it pretty rich too, you bet. When I allowed that I'd made my pile, I
pushed for home in the <i>Marie Rose</i> from 'Frisco to Southampton. She got
in at three to-day, but those sharks at the customs kept us till five 'fore we
could get ashore. When I landed I let out for Portsmouth, where I used to know
some folk; but you see I didn't quite reckon up how far it was before I
started. Besides, this bag ain't quite the thing a man would lug about with him
if he was walkin' for a wager."</p>
<p>"Are your friends expecting you in Portsmouth?" John Ranter asked.</p>
<p>The young man laid down his bag, and laughed so heartily that he had to lean
against the gate for support.</p>
<p>"That's where the joke comes in," he cried; "they don't know that I've left
the States."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the joke, is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes; that's the joke. You see, they are all sitting at breakfast, maybe, or
at dinner, as the case might be, and I pushes my way in, and I up with this
here bag and opens it, and then ker-whop down comes the whole lot on the
table;" and the young man laughed heartily once more over the idea.</p>
<p>"The whole lot of what?" asked John.</p>
<p>"Why, of shiners, of course&mdash;dollars, you understand."</p>
<p>"And d'ye mean to say you carry your whole fortune about with you in gold?"
Ranter asked in amazement.</p>
<p>"My whole fortune! No, boss, I reckon not. The bulk of it is in notes and
shares, and they're all packed away right enough. This is just eight hundred
dollars that I put to one side for this same little game that I spoke of. But I
suppose it's no use trying to get there to-night, and I'll have to trust to an
inn after all."</p>
<p>"Don't you do that," the elder man said, earnestly. "They are a rough lot in
the inns about here, and there's many a poor sailor found his pockets as empty
in the morning as they were the day he sailed out of port. You find some honest
man and ask him for a night's lodging; that's the best thing you can do."</p>
<p>"Well, pard, I guess I've lost my bearings in this neighbourhood," the
gold-digger said. "If you can put me on the track of any such berth as you
speak of, I'd be beholden to you."</p>
<p>"Why, for that matter," John Ranter said, "we have a spare bed of our own,
and should be very glad if you would pass the night in it. We are simple folk,
my wife and I; but as far as a fire and a warm supper go, you're very welcome
to both the one and the other."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't say fairer than that," the traveller responded, and he
walked up the little gravel walk with his companion, while the shadow of night
spread slowly over the landscape, and the owl hooted mournfully in the
neighbouring wood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ranter, who had been a comely lass thirty years before, was now a
white-haired, melancholy woman, with a wan face and a timid manner. She
welcomed the stranger in a nervous, constrained fashion, and proceeded to cook
some rashers of bacon, which she cut from a great side which hung from the
rafters of the rude kitchen. The young man deposited his bag under a chair, and
then, sitting down above it, he drew out his pipe and lit it. Ranter filled his
again at the same time, eyeing his companion furtively all the while from under
his heavy eye-brows.</p>
<p>"You'd best take your coat off," he said, in an off-hand way.</p>
<p>"No; I'll keep it on, if you don't mind," the other returned. "I never take
this coat off."</p>
<p>"Please yourself," said John, puffing at his pipe; "I thought maybe you'd
find it hot with this fire burning; but then, Californey is a hot place, I'm
told, and maybe you find England chilly?"</p>
<p>The other did not answer, and the two men sat silently watching the rashers,
which grizzled and sputtered upon the pan.</p>
<p>"What sort o' ship did you come in?" the host asked, at last.</p>
<p>"The <i>Marie Rose</i>," said the other. "She's a three-masted schooner, and
came over with hides and other goods. She's not much to look at, but she's no
slouch of a sea boat. We'd a gale off Cape Horn that would have tried any ship
that ever sailed. Three days under a single double-reefed topsail, and that was
rather more than she could carry. Am I in your way, missus?"</p>
<p>"No, no," said Mrs. Ranter, hurriedly. The stranger had been looking at her
very hard while he spoke.</p>
<p>"I guess the skipper and the mates will wonder what has become of me," he
continued. "I was in such a hurry that I came off without a word to one of
them. However, my traps are on board, so they'll know I've not deserted them
for good."</p>
<p>"Did you speak to anyone after you left the ship?" Ranter asked,
carelessly.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you take a trap if you wanted to get to Portsmouth?"</p>
<p>"Mate, you've never come ashore from a long sea voyage, else you'd not ask
me that question. Why, man, it's the greatest pleasure you can have to stretch
your legs, and keep on stretching them. I'd have padded on right enough if the
light had held."</p>
<p>"You'll be a deal better in a comfortable bed," said Ranter; "and now the
supper's ready, so let us fall to. Here's beer in the jug, and there's whisky
in that bottle, so it's your own fault if you don't help yourself."</p>
<p>The three gathered round the table and made an excellent meal. Under the
influence of their young guest's genial face and cheery conversation, the
mistress of the house lost her haggard appearance, and even made one or two
timid attempts to join in the talk. The country postman, coming home from his
final round, stopped in astonishment when he saw the blazing light in the
cottage window, and heard the merry sound of laughter which pealed out on the
still night air.</p>
<p>If any close observer had been watching the little party as they sat round
the table, he might have remarked that John Ranter showed a very lively
curiosity in regard to the long grey coat in which his visitor was clad. Not
only did he <i>eye</i> that garment narrowly from time to time, but he twice
found pretexts to pass close to the other's chair, and each time he did so he
drew his hand, as though accidentally, along the side of the overcoat. Neither
the young man nor the hostess appeared, however, to take the slightest notice
of this strange conduct upon the part of the ex-publican.</p>
<p>After supper the two men drew their chairs up to the fire once more, while
the old woman removed the dishes. The traveller's conversation turned
principally upon the wonders of California and of the great republic in which
he had spent the best part of his life. He spoke of the fortunes which were
made at the mines, too, and of the golden store which may be picked up by
whoever is lucky enough to find it, until Ranter's eyes sparkled again as he
listened.</p>
<p>"How much might it take to get out there?" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh! a hundred pounds or so would start you comfortably," answered the man
with the grey coat.</p>
<p>"That doesn't seem much."</p>
<p>"Why anyone should stay in England while there is money to be picked up
there is more than I can understand," the miner remarked. "And now, mate,
you'll excuse me, but I'm a man that likes to go to roost early and be up at
cock-crow. If the missus here would show me my room I'd be obliged."</p>
<p>"Won't you have another whisky? No? Ah! well, good-night. Lizzie, you will
show Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mr. Goodall," said the other.</p>
<p>"You will show Mr. Goodall up to his room. I hope you'll sleep well."</p>
<p>"I always sleep sound," said the man with the grey coat; and, with a nod, he
tramped heavily, bag in hand, up the wooden staircase, while the old woman
toiled along with the light in front of him.</p>
<p>When he had gone, John Ranter put both his hands into his trousers pockets,
stretched out his legs, and stared gloomily into the fire, with a wrinkled brow
and projecting lips. A great many thoughts were passing through his
mind&mdash;so many that he did not hear his wife re-enter the kitchen, nor did
he answer her when she spoke to him. It was half-past ten when the visitor
retired, and at twelve John Ranter was still bending over the smouldering heap
of ashes with the same look of thought upon his face. It was only when his wife
asked him whether he was not going to bed that he appeared to come to
himself.</p>
<p>"No, Lizzie," he said, in a more conciliatory tone than was usual with him.
"We'll both stay up a short time to-night."</p>
<p>"All right, John," the poor woman said, with a glad smile. It was many a
year since he had ever asked her for her company.</p>
<p>"Is he upstairs all right?"</p>
<p>"Who? Oh, Mr. Goodall? Yes; I showed him into the spare room."</p>
<p>"D'ye think he's asleep?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so, John. He's been there nigh an hour and a half."</p>
<p>"Is there a key in the door?"</p>
<p>"No, dear; but what queer questions you do ask."</p>
<p>John Ranter was silent for a time.</p>
<p>"Lizzie," he said at last, taking up the poker, and playing with it
nervously, "in the whole world there is no one who knows that that man came
here to-night. If he never left us again no one would know what had become of
him, or care to make any search after him."</p>
<p>His wife said nothing, but she turned white to her very lips. "He has eight
hundred dollars in that bag, Lizzie, which makes over a hundred and fifty pound
of our money. But he has more than that. He's got lumps of gold sewn into the
lining of that grey coat of his. That's why he didn't care about taking it off.
I saw the knobs, and I managed to feel 'em too. That money, my girl, would be
enough to take the two of us out to that same country where he picked all this
up&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake, John," cried his wife, flinging herself at his feet, and
clasping his knees with her arms, "for my sake&mdash;for the sake of our boy,
who might be about this young man's age&mdash;think no more of this! We are
old, John, and, rich or poor, we must in a few short years go to our long home.
Don't go with the stain of blood upon you. Oh, spare him! We have <i>been</i>
bad, but never so bad as this!"</p>
<p>But John Ranter continued to gaze over his wife's head into the fire, and
the set sternness of his features never relaxed for one moment. It seemed to
her, as she looked up into his eyes, that a strange new expression had come
into them such as she had never seen before&mdash;the baleful, lurid glare of
the beast of prey.</p>
<p>"This is a chance," he said, "such as would never come to us again. How many
would be glad to have it! Besides, Lizzie, it is my life or this man's. You
remember what Dr. Cousins said of me when we were at Portsea. I was liable to
apoplexy, he said, and disappointment, or hardships or grief, might bring it
on. This wretched life has enough of all three. Now if we had the money, we
could start afresh, and all would be well. I tell you, wife, I shall do it!"
and he clenched his large brown hand round the poker.</p>
<p>"You must not, John&mdash;and you shall not."</p>
<p>"I shall, and I will. Leave go of my knees."</p>
<p>He was about to push her from him when he perceived that she had fainted.
Picking her up he carried her to the side of the room and laid her down there.
Then he went back, and taking up the poker he balanced it in his hand. It
seemed to strike him as being too light, for he went into the scullery, and
after groping about in the dark he came back with a small axe. He was swinging
this backwards and forwards when his eye fell upon the knife which his wife had
used before supper in cutting the rashers of bacon. He ran his finger along the
edge of it. It was as keen as a razor. "It's handier and surer!" he muttered;
and going to the cupboard he drank off a large glass of raw whisky, after which
he kicked off his boots and began silently to ascend the old-fashioned
stair.</p>
<p>There were twelve steps which led up from the kitchen to a landing, and from
the landing eight more to the bedroom of their guest. John Ranter was nearly
half an hour in ascending those first twelve. The woodwork was rotten, and the
construction weak, so that they creaked under the weight of the heavy man. He
would first put his right foot lightly upon the board, and gradually increase
the pressure upon it until his whole weight was there. Then he would carefully
move up his left foot, and stand listening breathlessly for any sound from
above. Nothing broke the silence, however, except the dull ticking of the clock
in the kitchen behind him and the melancholy hooting of an owl among the
shrubbery. In the dull, uncertain light there was something terrible in this
vague, dark figure creeping slowly up the little staircase&mdash;moving,
pausing, crouching, but always coming nearer the top.</p>
<p>When he reached the landing he could see the door of the young miner's room.
John Ranter stood aghast. The door was on the jar, and through the narrow
opening there shone a thin golden stream. The light was still burning. Did it
mean that the traveller was awake? John listened intently, but there was no
sound of any movement in the room. For a long time he strained his ears, but
all was perfectly still.</p>
<p>"If he were awake," John said to himself, "he would have turned in his bed,
or made some rustling during this time."</p>
<p>Then he began stealthily to ascend the eight remaining steps until he was
immediately outside the bedroom door. Still all was silent within. No doubt it
was one of his foreign customs to leave the light burning during the night. He
had mentioned in conversation that he was a sound sleeper. Ranter began to fear
that unless he got it over soon his wife might recover and raise an alarm.
Clutching his knife in his right hand, he quietly pushed the door a little more
open with his left and inserted his head. Something cold pressed against his
temple as he did so. It was the muzzle of a revolver.</p>
<p>"Come in, John Ranter," said the quiet voice of his guest; "but first drop
your weapon, or I shall be compelled to fire. You are at my mercy."</p>
<p>Indeed, the ex-publican's head was caught in such a way that it was
difficult for him either to withdraw or to force his way in. He gave a deep
groan of rage and disappointment, and his knife clattered down upon the
floor.</p>
<p>"I meant no harm," he said, sulkily, as he entered the room.</p>
<p>"I have been expecting you for a couple of hours," the man with the grey
coat said, holding his pistol still cocked in his right hand, so that he might
use it if necessary. He was dressed exactly as he had been when he went
upstairs, and the ill-fated bag was resting upon the unruffled bed. "I knew
that you were coming."</p>
<p>"How&mdash;how?" John stammered.</p>
<p>"Because I know you; because I saw murder in your eye when you stood before
me at the gate; because I saw you feel my coat here for the nuggets. That is
why I waited up for you."</p>
<p>"You have no proof against me," said John Ranter, sullenly.</p>
<p>"I do not want any. I could shoot you where you stand, and the law would
justify me. Look at that bag upon the bed there. I told you there was money in
it. What d'ye think I brought that money to England for? It was to give it to
you&mdash;yes, to you. And that grey coat on me is worth five hundred pounds;
that was for you also. Ah! you begin to understand now. You begin to see the
mistake you have made."</p>
<p>John Ranter had staggered against the wall, and his face was all drawn down
on one side.</p>
<p>"Jack!" he gasped. "Jack!"</p>
<p>"Yes; Jack Ranter&mdash;your son. That's who I am." The young man turned
back his sleeve, and bared a blue device upon his forearm. "Don't you remember
Hairy Pete put that 'J.R.' on when I was a lad? Now you know me. I made my
fortune, and I came back, earnestly hoping that you would help me to spend it.
I called at the 'Battle of Dettingen,' and they told me where to find you.
Then, when I saw you at the gate, I thought I'd test my mother and you, and see
if you were the same as ever. I came to make you happy, and you have tried to
murder me. I shall not punish you; but I shall go, and you shall never see
either me or my money any more."</p>
<p>While the young man had been saying these words, a series of twitchings and
horrible contortions had passed over the face of his father, and at the last
words he took a step forward, raising his hands above his head, and fell, with
a hoarse cry, upon the ground. His eyes became glazed, his breathing
stertorous, and foam stood upon his purple lips. It did not take much medical
knowledge to see that he was dying. His son stooped over him and loosened his
collar and shirt.</p>
<p>"One last question," he said, in quick, earnest tones. "Did my mother aid in
this attempt?"</p>
<p>John Ranter appeared to understand the import of it, for he shook his head;
and so, with this single act of justice, his dark spirit fled from this world
of crime. The doctor's warning had come true, and emotion had hastened a
long-impending apoplexy. His son lifted him reverentially on to the bed, and
did such last offices as could be done.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is the best thing that could have happened," he said, sadly, as
he turned from the room, and went down to seek his mother, and to comfort her
in her sore affliction.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Young John Ranter returned to America, and by his energy and talents soon
became one of the richest men in his State. He has definitely settled there
now, and will return no more to the old country. In his palatial residence
there dwells a white-haired, anxious-faced old woman, whose every wish is
consulted, and to whom the inmates show every reverence. This is old Mrs.
Ranter; and her son has hopes that with time, and among new associations, she
may come to forget that terrible night when the man with the grey coat paid a
visit to the lonely Hampshire cottage.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>THE FATE OF THE EVANGELINE</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Boy's Own Paper,</i> Christmas number, 1885.</h3>
<hr>
<p>My wife and I often laugh when we happen to glance at some of the modern
realistic sensational stories, for, however strange and exciting they may be we
invariably come to the conclusion that they are tame compared to our own
experiences when life was young with us.</p>
<p>More than once, indeed, she has asked me to write the circumstances down,
but when I considered how few people there are in England who might remember
the <i>Evangeline</i> or care to know the real history of her disappearance, it
has seemed to me to be hardly worth while to revive the subject. Even here in
Australia, however, we do occasionally see some reference to her in the papers
or magazines, so that it is evident that there are those who have not quite
forgotten the strange story: and so at this merry Christmastide I am tempted to
set the matter straight.</p>
<p>At the time her fate excited a most intense and lively interest all over the
British Islands, as was shown by the notices in the newspapers and by numerous
letters which appeared upon the subject. As an example of this, as well as to
give the facts in a succinct form, I shall preface this narrative by a few
clippings chosen from many which we collected after the event, which are so
numerous that my wife has filled a small scrapbook with them. This first one is
from the "Inverness Gazette" of September 24th, 1873.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"PAINFUL OCCURRENCE IN THE HEBRIDES.&mdash;A sad accident, which it is
feared has been attended with loss of life, has occurred at Ardvoe, which is a
small uninhabited island lying about forty miles north-west of Harris and about
half that distance south of the Flannons. It appears that a yacht named the
Evangeline, belonging to Mr. Scholefield, jun., the son of the well-known
banker of the firm Scholefield, Davies, and Co., had put in there, and that the
passengers, with the two seamen who formed the crew, had pitched two tents upon
the beach, in which they camped out for two or three days. This they did no
doubt out of admiration for the rugged beauty of the spot, and perhaps from a
sense of the novelty of their situation upon this lonely island. Besides Mr.
Scholefield there were on the <i>Evangeline</i> a young lady named Miss Lucy
Forrester, who is understood to be his fianc&eacute;e, and her father, Colonel
Forrester, of Teddington, near London. As the weather was very warm, the two
gentlemen remained upon shore during the night, sleeping in one tent, while the
seamen occupied the other. The young lady, however, was in the habit of rowing
back to the yacht in the dinghy and sleeping in her own cabin, coming back by
the same means in the morning. One day, the third of their residence upon the
island, Colonel Forrester, looking out of the tent at dawn, was astonished and
horrified to see that the moorings of the boat had given way, and that she was
drifting rapidly out to sea. He promptly gave the alarm, and Mr. Scholefield,
with one of the sailors, attempted to swim out to her, but they found that the
yacht, owing to the fresh breeze and the fact that one of the sails had been so
clumsily furled as to offer a considerable surface to the wind, was making such
headway that it was impossible to overtake her. When last seen she was drifting
along in a west-sou'-westerly direction with the unfortunate young lady on
board. To make matters worse, it was three days before the party on the island
were able to communicate with a passing fishing-boat and inform them of the sad
occurrence. Both before and since, the weather has been so tempestuous that
there is little hope of the safety of the missing yacht. We hear, however, that
a reward of a thousand pounds has been offered by the firm of Scholefield to
the boat which finds her and of five thousand to the one which brings Miss
Forrester back in safety. Apart from any recompense, however, we are sure that
the chivalry of our brave fishermen will lead them to do everything in their
power to succour this young lady, who is said to possess personal charms of the
highest order. Our only grain of consolation is that the Evangeline was well
provided both with provisions and with water."<br>
<br></p>
<p>This appeared upon September 24th, four days after the disappearance of the
yacht. Upon the 25th the following telegram was sent from the north of
Ireland:<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Portrush.&mdash;John Mullins, of this town, fisherman, reports that upon
the morning of the 21st he sighted a yacht which answered to the description of
the missing Evangeline. His own boat was at that time about fifty miles to the
north of Malin Head, and was hove-to, the weather being very thick and dirty.
The yacht passed within two hundred yards of his starboard quarter, but the fog
was so great that he could not swear to her appearance. She was running in a
westerly direction under a reefed mainsail and jib. <i>There was a man at the
tiller.</i> He distinctly saw a woman on board, and thinks that she called out
to him, but could not be sure owing to the howling of the wind."</p>
<p>I have many other extracts here expressive of the doubts and fears which
existed as to the fate of the Evangeline, but I shall not quote one more than
is necessary. Here is the Central News telegram which quashed the last
lingering hopes of the most sanguine. It went the round of the papers upon the
3rd of October.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Galway, October 2nd, 7.25 p.m.&mdash;The fishing boat Glenmullet has just
come in, towing behind her a mass of wreckage, which leaves no doubt as to the
fate of the unfortunate Evangeline and of the young lady who was on board of
her. The fragments brought in consist of the bowsprit, figurehead, and part of
the bows, with the name engraved upon it. From its appearance it is conjectured
that the yacht was blown on to one of the dangerous reefs upon the north-west
coast, and that after being broken up there this and possibly other fragments
had drifted out to sea. Attached to it is a fragment of the fatal rope, the
snapping of which was the original cause of the disaster. It is a stout cable
of manilla hemp, and the fracture is a clean one&mdash;so clean as to suggest
friction against a very sharp rock or the cut of a knife. Several boats have
gone up and down the coast this evening in the hope of finding some more
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> or of ascertaining with certainty the fate of the young
lady."<br>
<br></p>
<p>From that day to this, however, nothing fresh has been learned of the fate
of the <i>Evangeline</i> or of Miss Lucy Forrester, who was on board of her.
These three extracts represent all that has ever been learned about either of
them, and in these even there are several statements which the press at the
time showed to be incredible. For example, how could the fisherman John Mullins
say that he saw a man on board when Ardvoe is an uninhabited island, and
therefore no one could possibly have got on board except Miss Forrester? It was
clear that he was either mistaken in the boat or else that he imagined the man.
Again, it was pointed out in a leader in the "Scotsman" that the conjecture
that the rope was either cut by a rock or by a knife was manifestly absurd,
since there are no rocks around Ardvoe, but a uniform sandy bottom, and it
would be preposterous to suppose that Miss Forrester, who was a lady as
remarkable for her firmness of mind as for her beauty, would deliberately sever
the rope which attached her to her father, her lover, and to life itself. "It
would be well," the "Scotsman" concluded, "if those who express opinions upon
such subjects would bear in mind those simple rules as to the analysis of
evidence laid down by Auguste Dupin. 'Exclude the impossible,' he remarks in
one of Poe's immortal stories, 'and what is left, however improbable,
<i>must</i> be the truth.' Now, since it is impossible that a rock divided the
rope, and impossible that the young lady divided it, and doubly impossible that
anybody else divided it, it follows that it parted of its own accord, either
owing to some flaw in its texture or from some previous injury that it may have
sustained. Thus this sad occurrence, about which conjecture is so rife, sinks
at once into the category of common accidents, which, however deplorable, can
neither be foreseen nor prevented."</p>
<p>There was one other theory which I shall just allude to before I commence my
own personal narrative. That is the suggestion that either of the two sailors
had had a spite against Mr. Scholefield or Colonel Forrester and had severed
the rope out of revenge. That, however, is quite out of the question, for they
were both men of good character and old servants of the Scholefields. My wife
tells me that it is mere laziness which makes me sit with the scrapbook before
me copying out all these old newspaper articles and conjectures. It is
certainly the easiest way to tell my story, but I must now put them severely
aside and tell you in my own words as concisely as I can what the real facts
were.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>My name is John Vincent Gibbs, and I am the son of Nathaniel Gibbs, formerly
a captain in one of the West Indian regiments. My father was a very handsome
man, and he succeeded in winning the heart of a Miss Leblanche, who was heiress
to a good sugar plantation in Demerara. By this marriage my father became
fairly rich, and, having left the army, he settled down to the life of a
planter. I was born within a year of the marriage, but my mother never rose
again from her bed, and my father was so broken-hearted at his loss that he
pined away and followed her to the grave within a few months.</p>
<p>I have thus never known either of my two parents, and the loss of their
control, combined perhaps with my tropical birthplace, made me, I fear,
somewhat headstrong and impetuous.</p>
<p>Immediately that I became old enough to be my own master I sold the estate
and invested the money in Government stock in such a way as to insure me an
income of fifteen hundred a year for life. I then came to Europe, and for a
long time led a strange Bohemian life, flitting from one University to another,
and studying spasmodically those subjects which interested me. I went to
Heidelberg for a year in order to read chemistry and metaphysics, and when I
returned to London I plunged for the first time into society. I was then
twenty-four years of age, dark-haired, dark-eyed, swarthy, with a smattering of
all knowledge and a mastery of none.</p>
<p>It was during this season in London that I first saw Lucy Forrester. How can
I describe her so as to give even the faintest conception of her beauty? To my
eyes no woman ever had been or could be so fair. Her face, her voice, her
figure, every movement and action, were part of one rare and harmonious whole.
Suffice it that I loved her the very evening that I saw her, and that I went on
day after day increasing and nourishing this love until it possessed my whole
being.</p>
<p>At first my suit prospered well. I made the acquaintance of her father, an
elderly soldier, and became a frequent visitor at the house. I soon saw that
the keynote of Miss Forrester's character was her intense devotion to her
father, and accordingly I strove to win her regard by showing extreme deference
and attention to him. I succeeded in interesting her in many topics, too, and
we became very friendly. At last I ventured to speak to her of love, and told
her of the passion which consumed me. I suppose I spoke wildly and fiercely,
for she was frightened and shrank from me.</p>
<p>I renewed the subject another day, however, with better success. She
confessed to me then that she loved me, but added firmly that she was her
father's only child, and that it was her duty to devote her life to comforting
his declining years. Her personal feelings, she said, should never prevent her
from performing that duty. It mattered not. The confession that I was dear to
her filled me with ecstasy. For the rest I was content to wait.</p>
<p>During this time the colonel had favoured my suit. I have no doubt that some
gossip had exaggerated my wealth and given him false ideas of my importance.
One day in conversation I told him what my resources were. I saw his face
change as he listened to me, and from that moment his demeanour altered.</p>
<p>It chanced that about the same time young Scholefield, the son of the rich
banker, came back from Oxford, and having met Lucy, became very marked in his
attentions to her. Colonel Forrester at once encouraged his addresses in every
possible way, and I received a curt note from him informing me that I should do
well to discontinue my visits.</p>
<p>I still had hopes that Lucy would not be influenced by her father's
mercenary schemes. For days I frequented her usual haunts, seeking an
opportunity of speaking to her. At last I met her alone one morning in St.
James's Park. She looked me straight in the face, and there was an expression
of great tenderness and sadness in her eyes, but she would have passed me
without speaking. All the blood seemed to rush into my head, and I caught her
by the wrist to detain her.</p>
<p>"You have given me up, then?" I cried. "There is no longer any hope for
me."</p>
<p>"Hush, Jack!" she said, for I had raised my voice excitedly. "I warned you
how it would be. It is my father's wish and I must obey him, whatever it costs.
Let me go now. You must not hold me any more."</p>
<p>"And there is no hope?"</p>
<p>"You will soon forget me," she said. "You must not think of me again."</p>
<p>"Ah, you are as bad as he," I cried, excitedly. "I read it in your eyes. It
is the money&mdash;the wretched money." I was sorry for the words the moment
after I had said them, but she had passed gravely on, and I was alone.</p>
<p>I sat down upon one of the benches in the park, and rested my head upon my
hands. I felt numbed and stupefied. The world and everything in it had changed
for me during the last ten minutes. People passed me as I sat&mdash;people who
laughed and joked and gossiped. It seemed to me that I watched them almost as a
dead man might watch the living. I had no sympathy with their little aims,
their little pleasures and their little pains. "I'll get away from the whole
drove of them," I said, as I rose from my seat. "The women are false and the
men are fools, and everything is mean and sordid." My first love had unhappily
converted me to cynicism, rash and foolish as I was, as it has many such a man
before.</p>
<p>For many months I travelled, endeavouring by fresh scenes and new
experiences to drive away the memory of that fair false face. At Venice I heard
that she was engaged to be married to young Scholefield. "He's got a lot of
money," this tourist said&mdash;it was at the table d'h&ocirc;te at the Hotel
de l'Europe. "It's a splendid match for her." For <i>her</i>!</p>
<p>When I came back to England I flitted restlessly about from one place to
another, avoiding the haunts of my old associates, and leading a lonely and
gloomy life. It was about this time that the idea first occurred to me of
separating my person from mankind as widely as my thoughts and feelings were
distinct from theirs. My temperament was, I think, naturally a somewhat morbid
one, and my disappointment had made me a complete misanthrope. To me, without
parents, friends, or relations, Lucy had been everything, and now that she was
gone the very sight of a human face was hateful to me. Loneliness in a
wilderness, I reflected, was less irksome than loneliness in a city. In some
wild spot I might be face to face with nature and pursue the studies into which
I had plunged once more, without interruption or disturbance.</p>
<p>As this resolution began to grow upon me I thought of this island of Ardvoe,
which, curiously enough, had been first mentioned to me by Scholefield on one
of the few occasions when we had been together in the house of the Forresters.
I had heard him speak of its lonely and desolate position, and of its beauty,
for his father had estates in Skye, from which he was wont to make yachting
trips in summer, and in one of these he had visited the island. It frequently
happened, he said, that no one set foot upon it during the whole year, for
there was no grass for sheep, and nothing to attract fishermen. This, I
thought, would be the very place for me.</p>
<p>Full of my new idea, I travelled to Skye, and from thence to Uist. There I
hired a fishing-boat from a man named McDiarmid, and sailed with him and his
son to the island. It was just such a place as I had imagined&mdash;rugged and
desolate, with high, dark crags rising up from a girdle of sand. It had been
once, McDiarmid said, a famous emporium for the goods of smugglers, which used
to be stored there, and then conveyed over to the Scotch coast as occasion
served. He showed me several of the caves of these gentry, and one in
particular, which I immediately determined should be my own future dwelling. It
was approached by a labyrinth of rocky paths, which effectually secured it
against any intruder, while it was roomy inside, and lit up by an aperture in
the rock above, which might be covered over in wet weather.</p>
<p>The fisherman told me that his father had pointed the spot out to him, but
that it was not commonly known to the rare visitors who came to the island.
There was abundance of fresh water, and fish were to be caught in any
quantity.</p>
<p>I was so well satisfied with my survey that I returned to Scotland with the
full intention of realising my wild misanthropical scheme.</p>
<p>In Glasgow I purchased most of the more important things that I wanted to
take with me. These included a sleeping bag, such as is used in the Arctic
seas; several mathematical and astronomical instruments; a very varied and
extensive assortment of books, including nearly every modern work upon
chemistry and physics; a double-barrelled fowling-piece, fishing-tackle, lamps,
candles, and oil. Subsequently at Oban and Stornoway I purchased two bags of
potatoes, a sack of flour, and a quantity of tinned meats, together with a
small stove. All these things I conveyed over in McDiarmid's boat, having
already bound both himself and his son to secrecy upon the matter&mdash;a
promise which, as far as I know, neither of them ever broke. I also had a table
and chair conveyed across, with a plentiful supply of pens, ink, and paper.</p>
<p>All these things were stowed away in the cave, and I then requested
McDiarmid to call upon the first of each month, or as soon after as the weather
permitted, in case I needed anything. This he promised to do, and having been
well paid for his services, he departed, leaving me upon the island.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation to me when I saw the brown sail of his boat
sinking below the horizon, until at last it disappeared, and left one broad,
unbroken sheet of water before me. That boat was the last tie which bound me to
the human race. When it had vanished, and I returned into my cave with the
knowledge that no sight or sound could jar upon me now, I felt the first
approach to satisfaction which I had had through all those weary months. A fire
was sparkling in the stove, for fuel was plentiful on the island, and the long
stove-pipe had been so arranged that it projected through the aperture above,
and so carried the smoke away. I boiled some potatoes and made a hearty meal,
after which I wrote and read until nightfall, when I crept into my bag and
slept soundly.</p>
<p>It might weary my readers should I speak of my existence upon this island,
though the petty details of my housekeeping seem to interest my dear wife more
than anything else, and ten years have not quite exhausted her questions upon
the subject. I cannot say that I was happy, but I was less unhappy than I could
have believed it possible. At times, it is true, I was plunged into the deepest
melancholy, and would remain so for days, without energy enough to light my
fire or to cook my food. On these occasions I would wander aimlessly among the
hills and along the shore until I was worn out with fatigue. After these
attacks, however, I would become, if not placid, at least torpid for a time.
Occasionally I could even smile at my strange life as an anchorite, and
speculate as to whether the lord of the manor, since I presumed the island
belonged to some one, would become aware of my existence, and if so, whether he
would evict me ignominiously, or claim a rent for my little cavern.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Three months had passed, as I knew by the regular visits of the worthy
fisherman, when the event occurred which altered the course of my whole life,
and led in the end to the writing of this narrative.</p>
<p>I had been out all day surveying my little kingdom, and having returned
about four o'clock, had settled down to Ricardo's "Principles of Political
Economy," of which work I was writing a critical analysis. I had been writing
about three hours, and the waning light (it was in September) was warning me
that the time had come to stop, when suddenly, to my intense astonishment, I
heard a human voice. Crusoe, when he saw the footstep, could hardly have been
more surprised. My first idea was that some unforeseen circumstance had induced
McDiarmid to come across before his time, and that he was hailing me; but a
moment's reflection showed me that the voice which I had heard was very
different from the rough Gaelic accents of the fisherman. As I sat pen in hand,
wondering and listening, a peal of laughter rose up from the beach. An
unreasoning indignation at this intrusion on my privacy then took possession of
me, and I rushed out of my cave and peered over the rocks to see who the
invaders might be.</p>
<p>Down beneath me in the bay a trim little yacht of five-and-twenty tons or
thereabouts was riding at anchor. On the beach two yachtsmen&mdash;a young man
and an old&mdash;were endeavouring with the aid of a sailor to raise a canvas
tent, and were busily engaged knocking pegs into the crumbling sand and
fastening ropes to them. Between the shore and the yacht there was a small boat
rowed by one man, and in the sheets there sat a lady. When the boat reached the
shore one of the yachtsmen, the younger of the two, ran down and handed its
passenger out. The instant she stood erect I recognised her. Even after the
lapse of ten years I feel again the rush and whirlwind of emotion which came
over me when I saw once more in this strange place the woman whom I loved
better than all the world besides.</p>
<p>At first it seemed so extraordinary, so utterly inexplicable, that I could
only surmise that she and her father and lover (for I had now recognised the
two men also) had heard 'of my presence here and had come with the intention of
insulting me. This was the mad notion which came into my disordered brain. The
unconcerned air of the party showed, however, that this could not be. On second
thoughts I convinced myself that it was no very wonderful coincidence after
all. No doubt Scholefield was taking up the young lady and her father to pay a
visit to his rich friends in Skye. If so, what more natural than that in
passing they should visit this island concerning which I remembered that Lucy
had expressed interest and curiosity when Scholefield spoke of it originally?
It seemed to me now to be such a natural sequence of events that my only wonder
was that the possibility of it had not occurred to me earlier.</p>
<p>The tent was soon up, and they had supper inside it, after raising another
smaller tent for the two seamen. It was evident that the whole party intended
to camp out for a time.</p>
<p>I crept down towards the beach after it was dark, and came as near to them
as I dared. After a time Scholefield sang a sea song; and then, after some
persuasion, she sang too&mdash;a melancholy ballad, one which had been a
favourite of mine in the old days in London. What would she have thought, I
wondered, could she have seen me, unshaven and dishevelled, crouching like a
wild beast among the rocks! My heart was full, and I could bear it no longer. I
went back to my lonely cave with all my old wounds ripped open afresh.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock I saw her in the moonlight go down to the beach alone, and
row to the yacht, where she fastened the dinghy astern. She was always proud, I
remembered, of being at home upon the water. I knew then for certain that she
was not married yet, and a gush of senseless joy and hope rose up in my
bosom.</p>
<p>I saw her row back in the morning, and the party breakfasted together in the
tent. Afterwards they spent the day in exploring the island and in gathering
the rare shells which are to be found upon the beach. They never came my
way&mdash;indeed the rocks among which my cave lay were well-nigh inaccessible
to any one who did not know the steep and intricate pathway. I watched the lady
wandering along the sands, and once she passed immediately beneath my citadel.
Her face was pale, I thought, and she seemed graver than when I saw her last,
but otherwise there was no change. Her blue yachting costume with white lace
and gilt buttons suited her to perfection. Strange how small details may stick
in the memory!</p>
<p>It was on the evening of the second day of their visit that I found that the
stock of fresh water which I usually kept in my cave had run short, which
necessitated my going to the stream for more. It was about a hundred yards off,
and not far from the tent, but it seemed to me that since darkness had set in I
should be running no risk of discovery; so taking my bucket in my hand I set
off. I had filled it and was about to return when I heard the footsteps and
voices of two men close to me, and had hardly time to crouch down behind a
furze bush when they stopped almost within arm's length of me.</p>
<p>"Help you!" I heard one of them say, whom I at once identified as old
Forrester. "My dear fellow, you must help yourself. You must be patient and you
must be resolute. When I broached the matter to her she said that she had
obeyed me in not speaking to the other, but when I asked for more than that I
exceeded the claims which a father has upon a daughter. Those were her very
words."</p>
<p>"I can't make it out," the other said peevishly; "you always hold out hopes,
but they never come to anything. She is kind to me and friendly, but no more.
The fellows at the club think that I am engaged to her. Everybody thinks
so."</p>
<p>"So you will be, my boy, so you will be," Forrester answered. "Give her
time."</p>
<p>"It's that black chap Gibbs who runs in her head," said Scholefield. "The
fellow is dead, I believe, or gone mad, as I always said he would. Anyway he
has disappeared from the world, but that seems to make no difference to
her."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" the other answered. "Out of sight is out of mind, sooner or later.
You will have exceptional opportunities at Skye, so make the most of them. For
my part I promise to put on all the pressure I can. At present we must go down
to the tent or she'll think we are lost," with which they moved off, and their
steps died away in the distance.</p>
<p>I stood up after they were gone like one in a dream, and slowly carried back
my bucket. Then I sat down upon my chair and leaned my head upon my hands,
while my mind was torn by conflicting emotions. She was true to me then. She
had never been engaged to my rival. Yet there was the old prohibition of her
parent, which had no doubt the same sacred weight with her as ever. I was
really no nearer her than before. But how about this conspiracy which I had
overheard&mdash;this plot between a mercenary father and a mean-spirited
suitor. Should I, ought I, to allow her to be bullied by the one or cajoled by
the other into forsaking me? Never! I would appeal to her. I would give her one
more chance at least of judging between her father and myself. Surely, I
thought, I who love her so tenderly have more claim upon her than this man who
would sell her to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Then in a moment it came into my head how I could take her away from them,
so that no one should stand between us, and I might plead my cause without
interruption. It was such a plan as could only have occurred perhaps to a man
of my impetuous nature. I knew that if once she left the island I might never
have the chance again. There was but one way to do it, and I was determined
that it should be done.</p>
<p>All night long I paced about my cave pondering over the details of my
scheme. I would have put it into execution at once, but the sky was covered
with clouds and the night was exceptionally dark. Never did time pass more
slowly. At last the first cold grey light began to show upon the horizon and to
spread slowly along it. I thrust a clasp knife into my pocket and as much money
as I had in the cave. Then I crept down to the beach, some distance from the
sleeping party, and swam out to the yacht. The ladder by which Lucy had got on
board the night before was still hanging down, and by it I climbed on board.
Moving softly so as not to awake her, I shook out enough of one of the sails to
catch the breeze, and then stooping over the bows I cut the thick rope by which
we were moored. For a minute or so the yacht drifted aimlessly, and then
getting some way on her she answered the helm, and stood out slowly towards the
Atlantic.</p>
<p>Do not misunderstand me. I had no intention of forcing the lady's
inclinations in any way, or compelling her to break her promise to her father.
I was not base enough for that. My sole and only object was to have an
opportunity of appealing to her, and pleading my cause for the last time. If I
had not known, on the authority of her suitor, that she still loved me, I would
have cut my right hand off as soon as cut that cable. As it was, if I could
persuade her to be my wife we could run down to Ireland or back to Oban, and be
married by special licence before the prisoners at Ardvoe could get away. If,
on the other hand, she refused to have anything to do with me, I would loyally
take the <i>Evangeline</i> back to her moorings and face the consequences,
whatever they might be. Some have blamed me for putting the lady in such a
compromising situation. Before they judge they must put themselves in my
position, with but one chance of making life happy, and that chance depending
upon prompt action. My savage life, too, may have somewhat blunted my regard
for the conventionalities of civilisation.</p>
<p>As the boat slowly headed out to sea I heard a great outcry upon the beach,
and saw Forrester and Scholefield, with the two sailors, running frantically
about. I kept myself carefully out of sight. Presently Scholefield and one of
the sailors dashed into the water, but after swimming a little way they gave it
up as hopeless, for the breeze was very fresh, and even with our little rag of
canvas we could not have been going less than five knots. All this time Miss
Forrester had not been disturbed, nor was there anything to let her know that
the yacht was under way, for the tossing was no greater than when she was at
anchor.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The moorings had been at the south end of the island, and as the wind was
cast, we headed straight out to the Atlantic. I did not put up any more sail
yet, for it would be seen by those we had left, and I wished at present to
leave them under the impression that the yacht had drifted away by accident, so
that if they found any means of communicating with the mainland they might
start upon a wrong scent. After three hours, however, the island being by that
time upon the extreme horizon, I hoisted the mainsail and jib.</p>
<p>I was busily engaged in tugging at the halliards, when Miss</p>
<p>Forrester, fully dressed, stepped out of her cabin and came upon deck. I
shall never forget the expression of utter astonishment which came over her
beautiful features when she realised that she was out at sea and with a strange
companion. She gazed at me with, at first, terror as well as surprise. No
doubt, with my long dark hair and beard, and tattered clothing, I was not a
very reassuring object.</p>
<p>The instant I opened my lips to address her, however, she recognised me, and
seemed to comprehend the situation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gibbs," she cried. "Jack, what have you done? You have carried me away
from Ardvoe. Oh, take me back again! What will my poor father do?"</p>
<p>"He's all right," I said. "He is hardly so very thoughtful about you, and
may not mind doing without you now for a little." She was silent for a while,
and leaned against the companion rail, endeavouring to collect herself.</p>
<p>"I can hardly realise it," she said, at last. "How could you have come here,
and why are we at sea? What is your object, Jack? What are you about to
do?"</p>
<p>"My only object is this," I said, tremblingly, coming up closer to her. "I
wished to be able to have a chance of talking to you alone without
interruption. The whole happiness of my life depends upon it. That is why I
have carried you off like this. All I ask you to do is to answer one or two
questions, and I will promise to do your bidding. Will you do so?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "I will."</p>
<p>She kept her eyes cast down and seemed to avoid my gaze. "Do you love this
man Scholefield?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," she answered, with decision.</p>
<p>"Will you ever marry him?"</p>
<p>"No," she answered again.</p>
<p>"Now, Lucy," I said, "speak the truth fearlessly, let me entreat you, for
the happiness of both of us depends upon it. Do you still love me?"</p>
<p>She never spoke, but she raised her head and I read her answer in her eyes.
My heart overflowed with joy.</p>
<p>"Then, my darling," I cried, taking her hand, "if you love me and I love
you, who is to come between us? Who dare part us?"</p>
<p>She was silent, but did not attempt to escape from my arm.</p>
<p>"Not your father," I said. "He has no power or right over you. You know well
that if one who was richer than Scholefield appeared to-morrow he would bid you
smile upon him without a thought as to your own feelings. You can in such
circumstances owe him no allegiance as to giving yourself for mere mercenary
reasons to those you in heart abhor."</p>
<p>"You are right, Jack. I do not," she answered, speaking very gently, but
very firmly. "I am sorry that I left you as I did in St. James's Park. Many a
time since I have bitterly regretted it. Still at all costs I should have been
true to my father if he had been true to me. But he has not been so. Though he
knows my dislike to Mr. Scholefield he has continually thrown us together as on
this yachting excursion, which was hateful to me from the first. Jack," she
continued, turning to me, "you have been true to me through everything. If you
still love me I am yours from this moment&mdash;yours entirely and for ever. I
will place myself in their power no more."</p>
<p>Then in that happy moment I was repaid for all the long months of weariness
and pain. We sat for hours talking of our thoughts and feelings since our last
sad parting, while the boat drifted aimlessly among the tossing waves, and the
sails flapped against the spars above our heads. Then I told her how I had swum
off and cut the cable of the <i>Evangeline.</i></p>
<p>"But, Jack," she said, "you are a pirate; you will be prosecuted for
carrying off the boat."</p>
<p>"They may do what they like now," I said, defiantly; "I have gained you, in
carrying off the boat."</p>
<p>"But what will you do now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I will make for the north of Ireland," I said; "then I shall put you under
the protection of some good woman until we can get a special licence and be
able to defy your father. I shall send the <i>Evangeline</i> back to Ardvoe or
to Skye. We are going to have some wind, I fear. You will not be afraid,
dear?"</p>
<p>"Not while I am with you," she answered, calmly.</p>
<p>The prospect was certainly not a reassuring one. The whole eastern horizon
was lined by great dark clouds, piled high upon each other, with that lurid
tinge about them which betokens violent wind. Already the first warning blasts
came whistling down upon us, heeling our little craft over till her gunwale lay
level with the water. It was impossible to beat back to the Scotch coast, and
our best chance of safety lay in running before the gale. I took in the topsail
and flying-jib, and reefed down the mainsail; then I lashed everything moveable
in case of our shipping a sea. I wished Lucy to go below to her cabin, but she
would not leave me, and remained by my side.</p>
<p>As the day wore on the occasional blasts increased into a gale, and the gale
into a tempest. The night set in dark and dreary, and still we sped into the
Atlantic. The <i>Evangeline</i> rose to the seas like a cork, and we took
little or no water aboard. Once or twice the moon peeped out for a few moments
between the great drifting cloud-banks. Those brief intervals of light showed
us the great wilderness of black, tossing waters which stretched to the
horizon. I managed to bring some food and water from the cabin while Lucy held
the tiller, and we shared it together. No persuasions of mine could induce her
to leave my side for a moment.</p>
<p>With the break of day the wind appeared to gain more force than ever, and
the great waves were so lofty that many of them rose high above our masthead.
We staggered along under our reefed sail, now rising upon a billow, from which
we looked down on two great valleys before and behind us, then sinking down
into the trough of the sea until it seemed as if we could never climb the green
wall beyond. By dead reckoning I calculated that we had been blown clear of the
north coast of Ireland. It would have been madness to run towards an unknown
and dangerous shore in such weather, but I steered a course now two more points
to the south, so as not to get blown too far from the west coast in case that
we had passed Malin Head. During the morning Lucy thought that she saw the loom
of a fishing-boat, but neither of us were certain, for the weather had become
very thick. This must have been the boat of the man Mullins, who seems to have
had a better view of us than we had of him.</p>
<p>All day (our second at sea) we continued to steer in a south-westerly
direction. The fog had increased and become so thick that from the stern we
could hardly see the end of the bowsprit. The little vessel had proved herself
a splendid sea boat, and we had both become so reconciled to our position, and
so confident in her powers, that neither of us thought any longer of the danger
of our position, especially as the wind and sea were both abating. We were just
congratulating each other upon this cheering fact, when an unexpected and
terrible catastrophe overtook us.</p>
<p>It must have been about seven in the evening, and I had gone down to rummage
in the lockers and find something to eat, when I heard Lucy give a startled cry
above me. I sprang upon deck instantly. She was standing up by the tiller
peering out into the mist.</p>
<p>"Jack," she cried. "I hear voices, There is some one close to us."</p>
<p>"Voices!" I said; "impossible. If we were near land we should hear the
breakers."</p>
<p>"Hist!" she cried, holding up her hand. "Listen!"</p>
<p>We were standing together straining our ears to catch every sound, when
suddenly and swiftly there emerged from the fog upon our starboard bow a long
line of Roman numerals with the figure of a gigantic woman hovering above them.
There was no time for thought or preparation. A dark loom towered above us,
taking the wind from our sails, and then a great vessel sprang upon us out of
the mist as a wild beast might upon its prey. Instinctively, as I saw the
monster surging down upon us, I flung one of the life-belts, which was hanging
round the tiller, over Lucy's head, and seizing her by the waist, I sprang with
her into the sea.</p>
<p>What happened after that it is hard to tell. In such moments all idea of
time is lost. It might have been minutes or it might have been hours during
which I swam by Lucy's side, encouraging her in every possible way to place
full confidence in her belt and to float without struggling. She obeyed me to
the letter, like a brave girl as she was. Every time I rose to the top of a
wave I looked around for some sign of our destroyer, but in vain. We joined our
voices in a cry for aid, but no answer came back except the howling of the
wind. I was a strong swimmer, but hampered with my clothes my strength began
gradually to fail me. I was still by Lucy's side, and she noticed that I became
feebler.</p>
<p>"Trust to the belt, my darling, whatever happens," I said.</p>
<p>She turned her tender face towards me.</p>
<p>"If you leave me I shall slip it off," she answered.</p>
<p>Again I came to the top of a great roller, and looked round. There was
nothing to be seen. But hark! what was that? A dull clanking noise came on my
ears, which was distinct from the splash of the sea. It was the sound of oars
in rowlocks. We gave a last feeble cry for aid. It was answered by a friendly
shout, and the next that either of us remember was when we came to our senses
once more and found ourselves in warm and comfortable berths with kind anxious
faces around us. We had both fainted while being lifted into the boat.</p>
<p>The vessel was a large Norwegian sailing barque, the <i>Freyja,</i> of five
hundred tons, which had started five days before from Bergen, and was bound for
Adelaide in Australia. Nothing could exceed the kindness of Captain Thorbjorn
and his crew to the two unfortunates whom they had picked out of the Atlantic
Ocean. The watch on deck had seen us, but too late to prevent a collision. They
had at once dropped a boat, which was about to return to the ship in despair,
when that last cry reached their ears.</p>
<p>Captain Thorbjorn's wife was on board, and she at once took my dear
companion under her care. We had a pleasant and rapid voyage to Adelaide, where
we were duly married in the presence of Madame Thorbjorn and of all the
officers of the <i>Freyja.</i></p>
<p>After our marriage I went upcountry, and having taken a large farm there, I
remained a happy and prosperous man. A sum of money was duly paid over to the
firm of Scholefield, coming they knew not whence, which represented the value
of the <i>Evangeline.</i></p>
<p>One of the first English mails which followed us to Australia announced the
death of Colonel Forrester, who fractured his skull by falling down the marble
steps of a Glasgow hotel. Lucy was terribly grieved, but new associations and
daily duties gradually overcame her sorrow.</p>
<p>Since then neither of us have anything to bind us to the old country, nor do
we propose to return to it. We read the English periodicals, however, and have
amused ourselves from time to time in noticing the stray allusions to the yacht
<i>Evangeline,</i> and the sad fate of the young lady on board her. This short
narrative of the real facts may therefore prove interesting to some few who
have not forgotten what is now an old story, and some perhaps to whom the
circumstances are new may care to hear a strange chapter in real life.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>TOUCH AND GO: A MIDSHIPMAN'S STORY</h2>
<p>Published in <i>Cassell's Family Magazine,</i> April 1886.</p>
<p>What is there in all nature which is more beautiful or more inspiriting than
the sight of the great ocean, when a merry breeze sweeps over it, and the sun
glints down upon the long green ridges with their crests of snow? Sad indeed
must be the heart which does not respond to the cheery splashing of the billows
and their roar upon the shingle. There are times, however, when the great
heaving giant is in another and a darker mood. Those who, like myself, have
been tossed upon the dark waters through a long night, while the great waves
spat their foam over them in their fury, and the fierce winds howled above
them, will ever after look upon the sea with other eyes. However peaceful it
may be, they will see the lurking fiend beneath its smiling surface. It is a
great wild beast of uncertain temper and incalculable strength.</p>
<p>Once, and once only, during the long years which I have spent at sea, have I
found myself at the mercy of this monster. There were circumstances, too, upon
that occasion, which threatened a more terrible catastrophe than the loss of my
own single life. I have set myself to write down, as concisely and as
accurately as I can, the facts in connection with that adventure and its very
remarkable consequences.</p>
<p>In 1868 I was a lad of fourteen, and had just completed my first voyage in
the <i>Paraguay</i>, one of the finest vessels of the finest of the Pacific
lines, in which I was a midshipman. On reaching Liverpool, our ship had been
laid up for a month or so, and I had obtained leave of absence to visit my
relations, who were living on the banks of the Clyde. I hurried north with all
the eagerness of a boy who has been abroad for the first time, and met with a
loving reception from my parents and from my only sister. I have never known
any pleasure in life which could compare with that which these reunions bring
to a lad whose disposition is affectionate.</p>
<p>The little village at which my family were living was called Rudmore, and
was situated in one of the most beautiful spots in the whole of the Clyde.
Indeed, it was the natural advantages of its situation which had induced my
father to purchase a villa there. Our grounds ran down to the water's edge, and
included a small wooden jetty which projected into the river. Beside this jetty
was anchored a small yacht, which had belonged to the former proprietor, and
which had been included in the rest of the property when purchased by my
father. She was a smart little clipper of about three-ton burden, and directly
my eyes fell upon her I determined that I would test her sea-going
qualities.</p>
<p>My sister had a younger friend of hers, Maud Sumter, staying with her at
this time, and the three of us made frequent excursions about the country, and
occasionally put out into the Firth in order to fish. On all these nautical
expeditions we were accompanied by an old fisherman named Jock Reid, in whom my
father had confidence. At first we were rather glad to have the old man's
company, and were amused by his garrulous chat and strange reminiscences. After
a time, however, we began to resent the idea of having a guardian placed over
us, and the grievance weighed with double stress upon me, for, midshipman-like,
I had fallen a victim to the blue-eyes and golden hair of my sister's pretty
playmate, and I conceived that without our boatman I might have many an
opportunity of showing my gallantry and my affection. Besides, it seemed a
monstrous thing that a real sailor, albeit only fourteen years of age, who had
actually been round Cape Horn, should not be trusted with the command of a boat
in a quiet Scottish firth. We put our three youthful heads together over the
matter, and the result was a unanimous determination to mutiny against our
ancient commander.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to carry our resolution into practice. One bright
winter's day, when the sun was shining cheerily, but a stiffish breeze was
ruffling the surface of the water, we announced our intention of going for a
sail, and Jock Reid was as usual summoned from his cottage to escort us. I
remember that the old man looked very doubtfully at the glass in my father's
hall, and then at the eastern sky, in which the clouds were piling up into a
gigantic cumulus.</p>
<p>"Ye maunna gang far the day," he said, shaking his grizzled head. "It's like
to blow hard afore evening."</p>
<p>"No, no, Jock," we cried in chorus; "we don't want to go far."</p>
<p>The old sailor came down with us to the boat, still grumbling his
presentiments about the coming weather. I stalked along with all the dignity of
chief conspirator, while my sister and Maud followed expectantly, full of
timidity and admiration for my audacity. When we reached the boat I helped the
boatman to set the mainsail and the jib, and he was about to cast her off from
her moorings when I played the card which I had been reserving.</p>
<p>"Jock," I said, slipping a shilling into his hand; "I'm afraid you'll feel
it cold when we get out. You had better get yourself a drop of something before
we start."</p>
<p>"Indeed I will, maister," said Jock emphatically. "I'm no as young as I was,
and the coffee keeps the cold out."</p>
<p>"You run up to the house," I said; "we can wait until you come back."</p>
<p>Poor old Jock, suspecting no treachery, made off in the direction of the
village, and was soon out of sight. The instant he had disappeared six busy
little hands were at work undoing the moorings, and in less than a minute we
were clear of the land, and were shooting gallantly out into the centre of the
Firth of Clyde. Under her press of canvas, the little boat heeled over until
her lee-gunwale was level with the water, and as we plunged into the waves the
spray came showering over the bows and splashing on our deck. Far away on the
beach we could see old Jock, who had been warned by the villagers of our
flight, running eagerly up and down, and waving his arms in his excitement. How
we laughed at the old man's impotent anger, and what fun we made of the salt
foam which wet our faces and sprinkled on our lips! We sang, we romped, we
played, and when we tired of this the two girls sat in the sheets, while I held
the tiller and told many stories of my nautical experiences, and of the
incidents of my one and only voyage.</p>
<p>At first we were somewhat undecided as to what course we should steer, or
where we should make for; but after consultation it was unanimously decided
that we should run out to the mouth of the Firth. Old Jock had always avoided
the open sea, and had beaten about in the river, so it seemed to us, now that
we had deposed our veteran commander, that it was a favourable opportunity for
showing what we could do without him. The wind, too, was blowing from the
eastward, and therefore was favourable to the attempt. We pulled the mainsail
as square as possible, and keeping the tiller steady, ran rapidly before the
wind in the direction of the sea.</p>
<p>Behind us the great cumulus of clouds had lengthened and broadened, but the
sun was still shining brightly, making the crests of the waves sparkle again,
like long ridges of fire. The banks of the Firth, which are four or five miles
apart, are well wooded, and many a lovely villa and stately castle peeped out
from among the trees as we swept past. Far behind us we saw the long line of
smoke which told where Greenock and Glasgow lay, with their toiling thousands
of inhabitants. In front rose a great stately mountain-peak, that of Goatfell,
in Arran, with the clouds wreathed coquettishly round the summit. Away to the
north, too, in the purple distance lay ranges of mountains stretching along the
whole horizon, and throwing strange shadows as the bright rays of the sun fell
upon their rugged sides.</p>
<p>We were not lonely as we made our way down ihe great artery which carries
the commerce of the west of Scotland to the sea. Boats of all sizes and shapes
passed and re-passed us. Eager little steamers went panting by with their loads
of Glasgow citizens, going to or returning from the great city. Yachts and
launches, and fishing-boats, came and went in every direction. One of the
latter crossed our bows, and one of her crew, a rough-bearded fellow, shouted
hoarsely at us; but the wind prevented us from hearing what he said. As we
neared the sea a great Atlantic steamer went slowly past us, with her big
yellow funnel vomiting forth clouds of smoke, and her whistle blowing to warn
the smaller craft to keep out of her way. Her passengers lined the side to
watch us as we shot past them, very proud of our little boat and of
ourselves.</p>
<p>We had brought some sandwiches away with us, and a bottle of milk, so that
there was no reason why we should shorten our cruise. We stood on accordingly
until we were abreast of Ardrossan, which is at the mouth of the river and
exactly opposite to the island of Arran, which lies in the open sea. The strait
across is about eight miles in width, and my two companions were both clamorous
that we should cross.</p>
<p>"It looks very stormy," I said, glancing at the pile of clouds behind us; "I
think we had better put back."</p>
<p>"Oh, do let us go on to Arran!" little Maud cried enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Do, Archie," echoed my sister; "surely, you are not afraid?"</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I <i>was</i> afraid, for I read the signs of the weather
better than they did. The reproachful look in Maud's blue eyes at what she took
to be my faint-heartedness overcame all my prudence.</p>
<p>"If you wish to go, we'll go," I said; and we sailed out from the mouth of
the river into the strait.</p>
<p>Hitherto we had been screened from the wind to some extent by the hills
behind us, but as we emerged from our shelter it came upon us in fiercer and
more prolonged blasts. The mast bent like a whip under the pressure upon the
sail, and would, I believe, have snapped short off, had it not been that I had
knowledge enough of sailing to be able to take in a couple of reefs in the
great sail. Even then the boat lay over in an alarming manner, so that we had
to hold on to the weather bulwarks to prevent our slipping off. The waves, too,
were much larger than they had been in the Firth, and we shipped so much water
that I had to bail it out several times with my hat. The girls clapped their
hands and cried out with delight as the water came over us, but I was grave
because I knew the danger; and seeing me grave, they became grave too. Ahead of
us the great mountain-peak towered up into the clouds, with green woods
clustering about its base; and we could see the houses along the beach, and the
long shining strip of yellow sand. Behind us the dark clouds became darker,
lined at the base with the peculiar lurid tint which is nature's danger signal.
It was evident that the breeze would soon become a gale, and a violent one. We
should not lose a moment in getting back to the river, and I already bitterly
repented that I had ever left its sheltering banks.</p>
<p>We put the boat round with all the speed we could, but it was no light task
for three children. When at last we began to tack for the Scotch coast, we
realised how difficult a matter it was for us to return. As long as we went
with the wind, we went also with the waves; and it was only a stray one which
broke over us. The moment, however, that we turned our broadside towards the
sea we were deluged with water, which poured in faster than we could bail it
out. A jagged flash of lightning clove the dark eastern sky, followed by a
deafening peal of thunder. It was clear that the gale was about to burst; and
it was evident to me that if it caught us in our present position we should
infallibly be swamped. With much difficulty we squared our sail once more, and
ran before the wind. It had veered a couple of points to the north, so that our
course promised to take us to the south of the island. We shipped less water
now than before, but on the other hand, every minute drove us out into the wild
Irish Sea, further and further from home.</p>
<p>It was blowing so hard by this time, and the waters made such a clashing,
that it was hard to hear each other's words. Little Maudie nestled at my side,
and took my hand in hers. My sister clung to the rail at the other side of
me.</p>
<p>"Don't you think," she said, "that we could sail right into one of the
harbours in Arran? I know there is a harbour at Brodick, which is just opposite
us."</p>
<p>"We had better keep away from it altogether," I said. "We should be sure to
be wrecked if we got near the coast; and it is just as bad to be wrecked there
as in the open sea."</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Anywhere the wind takes us," I answered; "it is our only chance. Don't cry,
Maudie; we'll get back all right when the storm is over." I tried to comfort
them, for they were both in tears; and, indeed, I could hardly keep my sobs
down myself, for I was a very little fellow to be placed in such a
position.</p>
<p>As the storm came down on us it became so dark that we could hardly see the
island in front of us, and the dark line of the Bute coast. We flew through the
water at a tremendous pace, skimming over the great seething waves, while the
wind howled and screamed through our rigging as though the whole air was full
of pursuing fiends intent upon our destruction. The two girls cowered,
shivering with terror, at the bottom of the boat, while I endeavoured to
comfort them as well as I could, and to keep our craft before the wind. As the
evening drew in and we increased our distance from the shore; the gale grew in
power. The great dark waves towered high above our mast-head, so that when we
lay in the trough of the sea, we saw nothing but the sombre liquid walls in
front and behind us. Then we would sweep up the black slope, till from the
summit we could see a dreary prospect of raging waters around us, and then we
would sink down, down into the valley upon the other side. It was only the
extreme lightness and buoyancy of our little craft which saved her from instant
destruction. A dozen times a gigantic billow would curl over our heads, as
though it were about to break over us, but each time the gallant boat rose
triumphantly over it, shaking herself after each collision with the waters as a
seabird might trim her feathers.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the horrors of that night! As the darkness settled down
upon us, we saw the loom of a great rock some little distance from us, and we
knew that we were passing Ailsa Craig. In one sense it was a relief to us to
know that it was behind us, because there was now no land which we need fear,
but only the great expanse of the Irish Sea. In the short intervals when the
haze lifted, we could see the twinkling lights from the Scottish lighthouses
glimmering through the darkness behind us. The waves had been terrible in the
daytime, but they were worse now. It was better to see them towering over us
than to hear them hissing and seething far above our heads, and to be able to
make out nothing except the occasional gleam of a line of foam. Once, and once
only, the moon disentangled itself from the thick hurrying clouds which
obscured its face. Then we caught a glimpse of a great wilderness of foaming,
tossing waters, but the dark scud drifted over the sky, and the silvery light
faded away until all was gloom once more.</p>
<p>What a long weary night it was! Cold and hungry, and shivering with terror,
the three of us clung together, peering out into the darkness and praying as
none of us had ever prayed before. During all the long hours we still tore
through the waters to the south and west, for the wind was now blowing from the
north-east. As the day dawned, grey and cheerless, we saw the rugged coast of
Ireland lining the whole western horizon. And now it was, in the first dim
light of dawn, that our great misfortune occurred to us. Whether it was the
result of the long-continued strain, or whether some gust of particular
violence had caught the sail, we have never known, but suddenly there was a
sharp cracking, rending noise, and next moment our mast was trailing over the
side, with the rigging and the sails flapping on the surface of the water. At
the same instant, our momentum being checked, a great sea broke over the boat
and nearly swamped us. Fortunately the blow was so great, that it drove our
boat round so that her head came to the seas once more. I bailed frantically
with my cap, for she was half full of water, and I knew a little more would
sink her, but as fast as I threw the water out, more came surging in. It was at
this moment, when all seemed lost to us, that I heard my sister give a joyful
cry, and looking up, saw a large steam launch ploughing its way towards us
through the storm. Then the tears which I had restrained so long came to my
relief, and I broke down completely in the reaction which came upon us, when we
knew that we were saved.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter for our preservers to rescue us, for close contact
between the two little craft was dangerous to both. A rope was thrown to us,
however, and willing hands at the other end drew us one after the other to a
place of safety. Maudie had fainted, and my sister and I were so weakened by
cold and fatigue, that we were carried helpless to the cabin of the launch,
where we were given some hot soup, after which we fell asleep, in spite of the
rolling and tossing of the little vessel.</p>
<p>How long we slept I have no idea, but when we woke it appeared to be
considerably past mid-day. My sister and Maudie were in the bunk opposite, and
I could see that they were still sleeping. A tall, dark-bearded man was
stooping over a chart which was pinned down to the table, measuring out
distances with a pair of compasses. When I moved he glanced up and saw that I
was awake.</p>
<p>"Well, mate," he said cheerily, "how are you now?"</p>
<p>"All right," I said; "thanks to you."</p>
<p>"It was touch and go," he remarked. "She foundered within five minutes of
your coming aboard. Have you any idea where you are now?"</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>"You're just off the Isle of Man. We're going to land you there on the west
coast, where no one is likely to see us. We've had to go out of our course to
do it, and I should have preferred to have taken you on to France, but the
master thinks you should be sent home as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"Why don't you want to be seen?" I asked, leaning on my elbow.</p>
<p>"Never mind," he said; "we don't&mdash;and that's enough. Besides, you and
these girls must keep quiet about us when you land. You must say that a
fishing-boat saved you.'</p>
<p>"All right," I said. I was much surprised at the earnestness with which the
man made the request. What sort of vessel was this that we had got aboard of? A
smuggler, perhaps, certainly something illegal, or else why this anxiety not to
be seen? Yet they had been kind and good to us, so whatever they might be, it
was not for us to expose them. As I lay speculating upon the point I heard a
sudden bustle upon deck, and a head looked down the hatchway.</p>
<p>"There's a vessel ahead of us that looks like a gun-boat," it said.</p>
<p>The captain&mdash;for such I presumed the dark-haired man to
be&mdash;dropped his compasses, and rushed upon deck. A moment later he came
down, evidently much excited.</p>
<p>"Come on," he said; "we must get rid of you at once." He woke the girls up,
and the three of us were hurried to the side and into a boat, which was manned
by a couple of sailors. The hilly coast of the island was not more than a
hundred or two yards away. As I passed into the boat, a middle-aged man, in
dark clothes and a grey overcoat, laid his hand upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Remember," he said&mdash;"silence! You might do much harm!"</p>
<p>"Not a word," I answered.</p>
<p>He waved an adieu to us as our oarsmen bent to their oars, and in a few
minutes we found our feet once more upon dry land. The boat pulled rapidly
back, and then we saw the launch shoot away southward, evidently to avoid a
large ship which was steaming down in the distance. When we looked again she
was a mere dot on the waters, and from that day to this we have never seen or
heard anything of our deliverers.</p>
<p>I fortunately had money enough in my pocket to send a telegram to my father,
and then we put up at a hotel at Douglas, until he came himself to fetch us
away. Fear and suspense had whitened his hair; but he was repaid for all when
he saw us once more, and clasped us in his arms. He even forgot, in his
delight, to scold us for the piece of treachery which had originated our
misfortunes; and not the least hearty greeting which we received upon our
return to the banks of the Clyde was from old Jock himself, who had quite
forgiven us our desertion.</p>
<p>And who were our deliverers? That is a somewhat difficult question to
answer, and yet I have an idea of their identity. Within a few days of our
return, all England was ringing with the fact that Stephens, the famous Fenian
head-centre, had made good his escape to the Continent. It may be that I am
weaving a romance out of very commonplace material; but it has often seemed to
me that if that gun-boat had overtaken that launch, it is quite possible that
the said Mr. Stephens might never have put in an appearance upon the friendly
shores of France. Be his politics what they may, if our deliverer really was
Mr. Stephens, he was a good friend to us in our need, and we often look back
with gratitude to our short acquaintance with the passenger in the grey
coat.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>UNCLE JEREMY'S HOUSEHOLD</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Boy's Own Paper,</i> 8 January&mdash;19 February 1887.</h3>
<hr>
<p>My life has been a somewhat chequered one, and it has fallen to my lot
during the course of it to have had several unusual experiences. There is one
episode, however, which is so surpassingly strange that whenever I look back to
it it reduces the others to insignificance. It looks up out of the mists of the
past, gloomy and fantastic, overshadowing the eventless years which preceded
and which followed it.</p>
<p>It is not a story which I have often told. A few, but only a few, who know
me well have heard the facts from my lips. I have been asked from time to time
by these to narrate them to some assemblage of friends, but I have invariably
refused, for I have no desire to gain a reputation as an amateur Munchausen. I
have yielded to their wishes, however, so far as to draw up this written
statement of the facts in connection with my visit to Dunkelthwaite.</p>
<p>Here is John Thurston's first letter to me. It is dated April 1862. I take
it from my desk and copy it as it stands:<br>
<br></p>
<p>"My dear Lawrence,&mdash;if you knew my utter loneliness and complete
<i>ennui</i> I am sure you would have pity upon me and come up to share my
solitude. You have often made vague promises of visiting Dunkelthwaite and
having a look at the Yorkshire Fells. What time could suit you better than the
present? Of course I understand that you are hard at work, but as you are not
actually taking out classes you can read just as well here as in Baker Street.
Pack up your books, like a good fellow, and come along! We have a snug little
room, with writing-desk and armchair, which will just do for your study. Let me
know when we may expect you.</p>
<p>"When I say that I am lonely I do not mean that there is any lack of people
in the house. On the contrary, we form rather a large household. First and
foremost, of course, comes my poor Uncle Jeremy, garrulous and imbecile,
shuffling about in his list slippers, and composing, as is his wont,
innumerable bad verses. I think I told you when last we met of that trait in
his character. It has attained such a pitch that he has an amanuensis, whose
sole duty it is to copy down and preserve these effusions. This fellow, whose
name is Copperthorne, has become as necessary to the old man as his foolscap or
as the 'Universal Rhyming Dictionary.' I can't say I care for him myself, but
then I have always shared Caesar's prejudice against lean men&mdash;though, by
the way, little Julius was rather inclined that way himself if we may believe
the medals. Then we have the two children of my Uncle Samuel, who were adopted
by Jeremy&mdash;there were three of them, but one has gone the way of all
flesh&mdash;and their governess, a stylish-looking brunette with Indian blood
in her veins. Besides all these, there are three maidservants and/the old
groom, so you see we have quite a little world of our own in this
out-of-the-way corner. For all that, my dear Hugh, I long for a familiar face
and for a congenial companion. I am deep in chemistry myself, so I won't
interrupt your studies. Write by return to your isolated friend,</p>
<p>"JOHN H. THURSTON."<br>
<br></p>
<p>At the time that I received this letter I was in lodgings in London, and was
working hard for the final examination which should make me a qualified medical
man. Thurston and I had been close friends at Cambridge before I took to the
study of medicine, and I had a great desire to see him again. On the other
hand, I was rather afraid that, in spite of his assurances, my studies might
suffer by the change. I pictured to myself the childish old man, the lean
secretary, the stylish governess, the two children, probably spoiled and noisy,
and I came to the conclusion that when we were all cooped together in one
country house there would be very little room for quiet reading. At the end of
two days' cogitation I had almost made up my mind to refuse the invitation,
when I received another letter from Yorkshire even more pressing than the
first.</p>
<p>"We expect to hear from you by every post," my friend said, "and there is
never a knock that I do not think it is a telegram announcing your train. Your
room is all ready, and I think you will find it comfortable. Uncle Jeremy bids
me say how very happy he will be to see you. He would have written, but he is
absorbed in a great epic poem of five thousand lines or so, and he spends his
day trotting about the rooms, while Copperthorne stalks behind him like the
monster in Frankenstein, with notebook and pencil, jotting down the words of
wisdom as they drop from his lips. By the way, I think I mentioned the
brunettish governess to you. I might throw her out as a bait to you if you
retain your taste for ethnological studies. She is the child of an Indian
chieftain, whose wife was an Englishwoman. He was killed in the mutiny,
fighting against us, and, his estates being seized by Government, his daughter,
then fifteen, was left almost destitute. Some charitable German merchant in
Calcutta adopted her, it seems, and brought her over to Europe with him
together with his own daughter. The latter died, and then Miss
Warrender&mdash;as we call her, after her mother&mdash;answered uncle's
advertisement; and here she is. Now, my dear boy, stand not upon the order of
your coming, but come at once."<br>
<br></p>
<p>There were other things in this second letter which prevent me from quoting
it in full.</p>
<p>There was no resisting the importunity of my old friend, so, with many
inward grumbles, I hastily packed up my books, and, having telegraphed
overnight, started for Yorkshire the first thing in the morning. I well
remember that it was a miserable day, and that the journey seemed to be an
interminable one as I sat huddled up in a corner of the draughty carriage,
revolving in my mind many problems of surgery and of medicine. I had been
warned that the little wayside station of Ingleton, some fifteen miles from
Carnforth, was the nearest to my destination, and there I alighted just as John
Thurston came dashing down the country road in a high dog-cart. He waved his
whip enthusiastically at the sight of me, and pulling up his horse with a jerk,
sprang out and on to the platform.</p>
<p>"My dear Hugh," he cried, "I'm so delighted to see you! It's so kind of you
to come!" He wrung my hand until my arm ached.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you'll find me very bad company now that I am here," I answered;
"I am up to my eyes in work."</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," he said, in his good-humoured way. "I reckoned on
this. We'll have time for a crack at the rabbits for all that. It's a longish
drive, and you must be bitterly cold, so let's start for home at once."</p>
<p>We rattled off along the dusty road.</p>
<p>"I think you'll like your room," my friend remarked. "You'll soon find
yourself at home. You know it is not often that I visit Dunkelthwaite myself,
and I am only just beginning to settle down and get my laboratory into working
order. I have been here a fortnight. It's an open secret that I occupy a
prominent position in old Uncle Jeremy's will, so my father thought it only
right that I should come up and do the polite. Under the circumstances I can
hardly do less than put myself out a little now and again."</p>
<p>"Certainly not," I said.</p>
<p>"And besides, he's a very good old fellow. You'll be amused at our
m&eacute;nage. A princess for governess&mdash;it sounds well, doesn't it? I
think our imperturbable secretary is somewhat gone in that direction. Turn up
your coat-collar, for the wind is very sharp."</p>
<p>The road ran over a succession of low bleak hills, which were devoid of all
vegetation save a few scattered gorse-bushes and a thin covering of stiff wiry
grass, which gave nourishment to a scattered flock of lean, hungry-looking
sheep. Alternately we dipped down into a hollow or rose to the summit of an
eminence from which we could see the road winding as a thin white track over
successive hills beyond. Every here and there the monotony of the landscape was
broken by jagged scarps, where the grey granite peeped grimly out, as though
nature had been sorely wounded until her gaunt bones protruded through their
covering. In the distance lay a range of mountains, with one great peak
shooting up from amongst them coquettishly draped in a wreath of clouds which
reflected the ruddy light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>"That's Ingleborough," my companion said, indicating the mountain with his
whip, "and these are the Yorkshire Fells. You won't find a wilder, bleaker
place in all England. They breed a good race of men. The raw militia who beat
the Scotch chivalry at the Battle of the Standard came from this part of the
country. Just jump down, old fellow and open the gate."</p>
<p>We had pulled up at a place where a long moss-grown wall ran parallel to the
road. It was broken by a dilapidated iron gate, flanked by two pillars, on the
summit of which were stone devices which appeared to represent some heraldic
animal, though wind and rain had reduced them to shapeless blocks. A ruined
cottage, which may have served at some time as a lodge, stood on one side. I
pushed the gate open and we drove up a long, winding avenue, grass-grown and
uneven, but lined by magnificent oaks, which shot their branches so thickly
over us that the evening twilight deepened suddenly into darkness.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid our avenue won't impress you much," Thurston said, with a laugh.
"It's one of the old man's whims to let nature have her way in everything. Here
we are at last at Dunkelthwaite."</p>
<p>As he spoke we swung round a curve in the avenue marked by a patriarchal oak
which towered high above the others, and came upon a great square whitewashed
house with a lawn in front of it. The lower part of the building was all in
shadow, but up at the top a row of blood-shot windows glimmered out at the
setting sun. At the sound of the wheels an old man in livery ran out and seized
the horse's head when we pulled up.</p>
<p>"You can put her up, Elijah," my friend said, as we jumped down. "Hugh, let
me introduce you to my Uncle Jeremy."</p>
<p>"How d'ye do? How d'ye do?" cried a wheezy cracked voice, and looking up I
saw a little red-faced man who was standing waiting for us in the porch. He
wore a cotton cloth tied round his head after the fashion of Pope and other
eighteenth-century celebrities, and was further distinguished by a pair of
enormous slippers. These contrasted so strangely with his thin spindle shanks
that he appeared to be wearing snowshoes, a resemblance which was heightened by
the fact that when he walked he was compelled to slide his feet along the
ground in order to retain his grip of these unwieldly appendages.</p>
<p>"You must be tired, sir. Yes, and cold, sir," he said, in a strange jerky
way, as he shook me by the hand. "We must be hospitable to you, we must indeed.
Hospitality is one of the old-world virtues which we still retain. Let me see,
what are those lines? 'Ready and strong the Yorkshire arm, but oh, the
Yorkshire heart is warm?' Neat and terse, sir. That comes from one of my poems.
What poem is it, Copperthorne?"</p>
<p>"'The Harrying of Borrodaile'," said a voice behind him, and a tall
long-visaged man stepped forward into the circle of light which was thrown by
the lamp above the porch. John introduced us, and I remember that his hand as I
shook it was cold and unpleasantly clammy.</p>
<p>This ceremony over, my friend led the way to my room, passing through many
passages and corridors connected by old-fashioned and irregular staircases. I
noticed as I passed the thickness of the walls and the strange slants and
angles of the ceilings, suggestive of mysterious spaces above. The chamber set
apart for me proved, as John had said, to be a cheery little sanctum with a
crackling fire and a well-stocked bookcase. I began to think as I pulled on my
slippers that I might have done worse after all than accept this Yorkshire
invitation.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>When we descended to the dining-room the rest of the household had already
assembled for dinner. Old Jeremy, still wearing his quaint headgear, sat at the
head of the table. Next to him, on his right, sat a very dark young lady with
black hair and eyes, who was introduced to me as Miss Warrender. Beside her
were two pretty children, a boy and a girl, who were evidently her charges. I
sat opposite her, with Copperthorne on my left, while John faced his uncle. I
can almost fancy now that I can see the yellow glare of the great oil lamp
throwing Rembrandt-like lights and' shades upon the ring of faces, some of
which were soon to have so strange an interest for me.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant meal, apart from the excellence of the viands and the fact
that the long journey had sharpened my appetite. Uncle Jeremy overflowed with
anecdote and quotation, delighted to have found a new listener. Neither Miss
Warrender nor Copperthorne spoke much, but all that the latter said bespoke the
thoughtful and educated man. As to John, he had so much to say of college
reminiscences and subsequent events that I fear his dinner was a scanty
one.</p>
<p>When the dessert was put on the table Miss Warrender took the children away,
and Uncle Jeremy withdrew into the library, where we could hear the dull murmur
of his voice as he dictated to his amanuensis. My old friend and I sat for some
time before the fire discussing the many things which had happened to both of
us since our last meeting.</p>
<p>"And what do you think of our household?" he asked at last, with a
smile.</p>
<p>I answered that I was very much interested with what I had seen of it. "Your
uncle," I said, "is quite a character. I like him very much."</p>
<p>"Yes; he has a warm heart behind all his peculiarities. Your coming seems to
have cheered him up, for he's never been quite himself since little Ethel's
death. She was the youngest of Uncle Sam's children, and came here with the
others, but she had a fit or something in the shrubbery a couple of months ago.
They found her lying dead there in the evening. It was a great blow to the old
man."</p>
<p>"It must have been to Miss Warrender too?" I remarked. "Yes; she was very
much cut up. She had only been here a week or two at the time. She had driven
over to Kirby Lonsdale that day to buy something."</p>
<p>"I was very much interested," I said, "in all that you told me about her.
You were not chaffing, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No, no; it's true as gospel. Her father was Achmet Genghis Khan, a
semi-independent chieftain somewhere in the Central Provinces. He was a bit of
a heathen fanatic in spite of his Christian wife, and he became chummy with the
Nana, and mixed himself up in the Cawnpore business, so Government came down
heavily on him."</p>
<p>"She must have been quite a woman before she left her tribe," I said. "What
view of religion does she take? Does she side with her father or mother?"</p>
<p>"We never press that question," my friend answered. "Between ourselves, I
don't think she's very orthodox. Her mother must have been a good woman, and
besides teaching her English, she is a good French scholar, and plays
remarkably well. Why, there she goes!"</p>
<p>As he spoke the sound of a piano was heard from the next room, and we both
paused to listen. At first the player struck a few isolated notes, as though
uncertain how to proceed. Then came a series of clanging chords and jarring
discords, until out of the chaos there suddenly swelled a strange barbaric
march, with blare of trumpet and crash of cymbal. Louder and louder it pealed
forth in a gust of wild melody, and then died away once more into the jerky
chords which had preceded it. Then we heard the sound of the shutting of the
piano, and the music was at an end.</p>
<p>"She does that every night," my friend remarked; "I suppose it is some
Indian reminiscence. Picturesque, don't you think so? Now' don't stay here
longer than you wish. Your room is ready whenever you would like to study."</p>
<p>I took my companion at his word and left him with his uncle and
Copperthorne, who had returned into the room, while I went upstairs and read
Medical Jurisprudence for a couple of hours. I imagined that I should see no
more of the inhabitants of Dunkelthwaite that night, but I was mistaken, for
about ten o'clock Uncle Jeremy thrust his little red face into the room.</p>
<p>"All comfortable?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Excellent, thanks," I answered.</p>
<p>"That's right. Keep at it. Sure to succeed," he said, in his spasmodic way.
"Good night!"</p>
<p>"Good night!" I answered.</p>
<p>"Good night!" said another voice from the passage; and looking out I saw the
tall figure of the secretary gliding along at the old man's heels like a long
dark shadow.</p>
<p>I went back to my desk and worked for another hour, after which I retired to
bed, where I pondered for some time before I dropped to sleep over the curious
household of which I had become a member.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>I was up betimes in the morning and out on the lawn, where I found Miss
Warrender, who was picking primroses and making them into a little bunch for
the breakfast-table. I approached her before she saw me, and I could not help
admiring the beautiful litheness of her figure as she stooped over the flowers.
There was a feline grace about her every movement such as I never remember to
have seen in any woman. I recalled Thurston's words as to the impression which
she had made upon the secretary, and ceased to wonder at it. As she heard my
step, she stood up and turned her dark handsome face towards me.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Miss Warrender," I said. "You are an early riser, like
myself."</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered. "I have always been accustomed to rise at
daybreak."</p>
<p>"What a strange, wild view!" I remarked, looking out over the wide stretch
of fells. "I am a stranger to this part of the country, like yourself. How do
you like it?"</p>
<p>"I don't like it," she said, frankly. "I detest it. It is cold and bleak and
wretched. Look at these"&mdash;holding up her bunch of primroses&mdash;"they
call these things flowers. They have not even a smell."</p>
<p>"You have been used to a more genial climate and a tropical vegetation?"</p>
<p>"Oh, then, Mr. Thurston has been telling you about me," she said, with a
smile. "Yes, I have been used to something better than this."</p>
<p>We were standing together when a shadow fell between us, and looking round I
found that Copperthorne was standing close behind us. He held out his thin
white hand to me with a constrained smile.</p>
<p>"You seem to be able to find your way about already," he remarked, glancing
backwards and forwards from my face to that of Miss Warrender. "Let me hold
your flowers for you, miss."</p>
<p>"No, thank you," the other said, coldly. "I have picked enough and am going
inside."</p>
<p>She swept past him and across the lawn to the house. Copperthorne looked
after her with a frowning brow.</p>
<p>"You are a student of medicine, Mr. Lawrence?" he said, turning towards me
and stamping one of his feet up and down in a jerky, nervous fashion, as he
spoke.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am."</p>
<p>"Oh, we have heard of you students of medicine," he cried in a raised voice,
with a little crackling laugh. "You are dreadful fellows, are you not? We have
heard of you. There is no standing against you."</p>
<p>"A medical student, sir," I answered, "is usually a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Quite so," he said, in a changed voice. "Of course I was only joking."
Nevertheless I could not help noticing that at breakfast he kept his eyes
persistently fixed upon me while Miss Warrender was speaking, and if I chanced
to make a remark he would flash a glance round at her as though to read in our
faces what our thoughts were of each other. It was clear that he took a more
than common interest in the beautiful governess, and it seemed to me to be
equally evident that his feelings were by no means reciprocated.</p>
<p>We had an illustration that morning of the simple nature of these primitive
Yorkshire folk. It appears that the housemaid and the cook, who sleep together,
were alarmed during the night by something which their superstitious minds
contorted into an apparition. I was sitting after breakfast with Uncle Jeremy,
who, with the help of continual promptings from his secretary, was reciting
some Border poetry, when there was a tap at the door and the housemaid
appeared. Close at her heels came the cook, buxom but timorous, the two
mutually encouraging and abetting each other. They told their story in a
strophe and antistrophe, like a Greek chorus, Jane talking until her breath
failed, when the narrative was taken up by the cook, who, in turn, was
supplanted by the other. Much of what they said was almost unintelligible to me
owing to their extraordinary dialect, but I could make out the main thread of
their story. It appears that in the early morning the cook had been awakened by
something touching her face, and starting up had seen a shadowy figure standing
by her bed, which figure had at once glided noiselessly from the room. The
housemaid was awakened by the cook's cry, and averred stoutly that she had seen
the apparition. No amount of cross-examination or reasoning could shake them,
and they wound up by both giving notice, which was a practical way of showing
that they were honestly scared. They seemed considerably indignant at our want
of belief, and ended by bouncing out of the room, leaving Uncle Jeremy angry,
Copperthorne contemptuous, and myself very much amused.</p>
<p>I spent nearly the whole of the second day of my visit in my room, and got
over a considerable amount of work. In the evening John and I went down to the
rabbit-warren with our guns. I told John as we came back of the absurd scene
with the servants in the morning, but it did not seem to strike him in the same
ridiculous light that it had me.</p>
<p>"The fact is," <i>he</i> said, "in very old houses like ours, where you have
the timber rotten and warped, you get curious effects sometimes which
predispose the mind to superstition. I have heard one or two things at night
during this visit which might have frightened a nervous man, and still more an
uneducated servant. Of course all this about apparitions is mere nonsense, but
when once the imagination is excited there's no checking it."</p>
<p>"What have you heard, then?" I asked with interest.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing of any importance," he answered. "Here are the youngsters and
Miss Warrender. We mustn't talk about these things before her, or else we shall
have her giving warning too, and that would be a loss to the
establishment."</p>
<p>She was sitting on a little stile which stood on the outskirts of the wood
which surrounds Dunkelthwaite, and the two children were leaning up against
her, one on either side, with their hands clasped round her arms, and their
chubby faces turned up to hers. It was a pretty picture and we both paused to
look at it. She had heard our approach, however, and springing lightly down she
came towards us, with the two little ones toddling behind her.</p>
<p>"You must aid me with the weight of your authority," she said to John.
"These little rebels are fond of the night air and won't be persuaded to come
indoors."</p>
<p>"Don't want to come," said the boy, with decision. "Want to hear the rest of
the story."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;the 'tory," lisped the younger one.</p>
<p>"You shall hear the rest of the story to-morrow if you are good. Here is Mr.
Lawrence, who is a doctor he will tell you how bad it is for little boys and
girls to be out when the dew falls."</p>
<p>"So you have been hearing a story?" John said as we moved on together.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;such a good story!" the little chap said with enthusiasm. "Uncle
Jeremy tells us stories, but they are in po'try and they are not nearly so nice
as Miss Warrender's stories. This one was about elephants&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And tigers&mdash;and gold&mdash;" said the other.</p>
<p>"Yes, and wars and fighting, and the king of the Cheroots&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Rajpoots, my dear," said the governess.</p>
<p>"And the scattered tribes that know each other by signs, and the man that
was killed in the wood. She knows splendid stories. Why don't you make her tell
you some, Cousin John?"</p>
<p>"Really, Miss Warrender, you have excited our curiosity," my companion said.
"You must tell us of these wonders."</p>
<p>"They would seem stupid enough to you," she answered, with a laugh. "They
are merely a few reminiscences of my early life."</p>
<p>As we strolled along the pathway which led through the wood we met
Copperthorne coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>"I was looking for you all," he said, with an ungainly attempt at geniality.
"I wanted to tell you that it was dinner-time."</p>
<p>"Our watches told us that," said John, rather ungraciously as I thought.</p>
<p>"And you have been all rabbiting together?" the secretary continued, as he
stalked along beside us.</p>
<p>"Not all," I answered. "We met Miss Warrender and the children on our way
back."</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Warrender came to meet you as you came back!" said he. This quick
contortion of my words, together with the sneering way in which he spoke, vexed
me so much that I should have made a sharp rejoinder had it not been for the
lady's presence.</p>
<p>I happened to turn my eyes towards the governess at the moment, and I saw
her glance at the speaker with an angry sparkle in her eyes which showed that
she shared my indignation. I was surprised, however, that same night when about
ten o'clock I chanced to look out of the window of my study, to see the two of
them walking up and down in the moonlight engaged in deep conversation. I don't
know how it was, but the sight disturbed me so much that after several
fruitless attempts to continue my studies I threw my books aside and gave up
work for the night. About eleven I glanced out again, but they were gone, and
shortly afterwards I heard the shuffling step of Uncle Jeremy, and the firm
heavy footfall of the secretary, as they ascended the staircase which led to
their bedrooms upon the upper floor.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>John Thurston was never a very observant man, and I believe that before I
had been three days under his uncle's roof I knew more of what was going on
there than he did. My friend was ardently devoted to chemistry, and spent his
days happily among his test-tubes and solutions, perfectly contented so long as
he had a congenial companion at hand to whom he could communicate his results.
For myself, I have always had a weakness for the study and analysis of human
character, and I found much that was interesting in the microcosm in which I
lived. Indeed, I became so absorbed in my observations that I fear my studies
suffered to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>In the first place, I discovered beyond all doubt that the real master of
Dunkelthwaite was not Uncle Jeremy, but Uncle Jeremy's amanuensis. My medical
instinct told me that the absorbing love of poetry, which had been nothing more
than a harmless eccentricity in the old man's younger days, had now become a
complete monomania, which filled his mind to the exclusion of every other
subject. Copperthorne, by humouring his employer upon this one point until he
had made himself indispensable to him, had succeeded in gaining complete power
over him in everything else. He managed his money matters and the affairs of
the house unquestioned and uncontrolled. He had sense enough, however, to exert
his authority so lightly that it galled no one's neck, and therefore excited no
opposition. My friend, busy with his distillations and analyses, was never
allowed to realise that he was really a nonentity in the establishment.</p>
<p>I have already expressed my conviction that though Copperthorne had some
tender feeling for the governess, she by no means favoured his addresses. After
a few days I came to think, however, that there existed besides this unrequited
affection some other link which bound the pair together. I had seen him more
than once assume an air towards her which can only be described as one of
authority. Two or three times also I had observed them pacing the lawn and
conversing earnestly in the early hours of the night. I could not guess what
mutual understanding existed between them, and the mystery piqued my
curiosity.</p>
<p>It is proverbially easy to fall in love in a country house, but my nature
has never been a sentimental one, and my judgment was not warped by any such
feeling towards Miss Warrender. On the contrary, I set myself to study her as
an entomologist might a specimen, critically, but without bias. With this
object I used to arrange my studies in such a way as to be free at the times
when she took the children out for exercise, so that we had many walks
together, and I gained a deeper insight into her character than I should
otherwise have done.</p>
<p>She was fairly well read, and had a superficial acquaintance with several
languages, as well as a great natural taste for music. Underneath this veneer
of culture, however, there was a great dash of the savage in her nature. In the
course of her conversation she would every now and again drop some remark which
would almost startle me by its primitive reasoning, and by its disregard for
the conventionalities of civilisation. I could hardly wonder at this, however,
when I reflected that she had been a woman before she left the wild tribe which
her father ruled.</p>
<p>I remember one instance which sruck me as particularly characteristic, in
which her wild original habits suddenly asserted themselves. We were walking
along the country road, talking of Germany, in which she had spent some months,
when she suddenly stopped short and laid her finger upon her lips. "Lend me
your stick!" she said, in a whisper. I handed it to her, and at once, to my
astonishment, she darted lightly and noiselessly through a gap in the hedge,
and bending her body, crept swiftly along under the shelter of a little knoll.
I was still looking after her in amazement, when a rabbit rose suddenly in
front of her and scuttled away. She hurled the stick after it and struck it,
but the creature made good its escape, though trailing one leg behind it.</p>
<p>She came back to me exultant and panting. "I saw it move among the grass,"
she said. "I hit it."</p>
<p>"Yes, you hit it. You broke its leg," I said, somewhat coldly. "You hurt
it," the little boy cried, ruefully.</p>
<p>"Poor little beast!" she exclaimed, with a sudden change in her whole
manner. "I am sorry I harmed it." She seemed completely cast down by the
incident, and spoke little during the remainder of our walk. For my own part I
could not blame her much. It was evidently an outbreak of the old predatory
instinct of the savage, though with a somewhat incongruous effect in the case
of a fashionably dressed young lady on an English high road.</p>
<p>John Thurston made me peep into her private sitting-room one day when she
was out. She had a thousand little Indian knickknacks there which showed that
she had come well-laden from her native land. Her Oriental love for bright
colours had exhibited itself in an amusing fashion. She had gone down to the
market town and bought numerous sheets of pink and blue paper, and these she
had pinned in patches over the sombre covering which had lined the walls
before. She had some tinsel too, which she had put up in the most conspicuous
places. The whole effect was ludicrously tawdry and glaring, and yet there
seemed to me to be a touch of pathos in this attempt to reproduce the
brilliance of the tropics in the cold English dwelling-house.</p>
<p>During the first few days of my visit the curious relationship which existed
between Miss Warrender and the secretary had simply excited my curiosity, but
as the weeks passed and I became more interested in the beautiful Anglo-Indian
a deeper and more personal feeling took possession of me. I puzzled my brains
as to what tie could exist between them. Why was it that while she showed every
symptom of being averse to his company during the day she should walk about
with him alone after nightfall? Could it be that the distaste which she showed
for him before others was a blind to conceal her real feelings? Such a
supposition seemed to involve a depth of dissimulation in her nature which
appeared to be incompatible with her frank eyes and clear-cut proud features.
And yet, what other hypothesis could account for the power which he most
certainly exercised over her?</p>
<p>This power showed itself in many ways, but was exerted so quietly and
silently that none but a close observer could have known that it existed. I
have seen him glance at her with a look so commanding, and, as it seemed to me,
so menacing, that next moment I could hardly believe that his white impassive
face could be capable of so intense an expression. When he looked at her in
this manner she would wince and quiver as though she had been in physical pain.
"Decidedly," I thought, "it is fear and not love which produces such
effects."</p>
<p>I was so interested in the question that I spoke to my friend John about it.
He was in his little laboratory at the time, and was deeply immersed in a
series of manipulations and distillations, which ended in the production of an
evil-smelling gas, which set us both coughing and choking. I took advantage of
our enforced retreat into the fresh air to question him upon one or two points
on which I wanted information.</p>
<p>"How long did you say that Miss Warrender had been with your uncle?" I
asked.</p>
<p>John looked at me slyly, and shook his acid-stained finger. "You seem to be
wonderfully interested about the daughter of the late lamented Achmet Genghis,"
he said.</p>
<p>"Who could help it?" I answered, frankly. "I think she is one of the most
romantic characters I ever met."</p>
<p>"Take care of the studies, my boy," John said, paternally. "This sort of
thing doesn't do before examinations."</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous!" I remonstrated. "Any one would think that I was in
love with Miss Warrender to hear the way in which you talk. I look on her as an
interesting psychological problem, nothing more."</p>
<p>"Quite so&mdash;an interesting psychological problem, nothing more."</p>
<p>John seemed to have some of the vapours of the gas still hanging about his
system, for his manner was decidedly irritating.</p>
<p>"To revert to my original question," I said. "How long has she been
here?"</p>
<p>"About ten weeks."</p>
<p>"And Copperthorne?"</p>
<p>"Over two years."</p>
<p>"Do you imagine that they could have known each other before?"</p>
<p>"Impossible!" said John, with decision. "She came from Germany. I saw the
letter from the old merchant, in which he traced her previous life.
Copperthorne has always been in Yorkshire except for two years at Cambridge. He
had to leave the university under a cloud."</p>
<p>"What sort of a cloud?"</p>
<p>"Don't know," John answered. "They kept it very quiet. I fancy Uncle Jeremy
knows. He's very fond of taking rapscallions up and giving them what he calls
another start. Some of them will give him a start some of these fine days."</p>
<p>"And so Copperthorne and Miss Warrender were absolute strangers until the
last few weeks?"</p>
<p>"Quite so; and now I think we can go back and analyse the sediment."</p>
<p>"Never mind the sediment," I cried, detaining him. "There's more I want to
talk to you about. If these two have only known each other for this short time,
how has he managed to gain his power over her?"</p>
<p>John stared at me open-eyed.</p>
<p>"His power?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, the power which he exercises over her."</p>
<p>"My dear Hugh," my friend said, gravely, "I'm not in the habit of thus
quoting Scripture, but there is one text which occurs irresistibly to my mind,
and that is, that 'Much learning bath made thee mad.' You've been reading too
hard."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say," I cried, "that you have never observed that there is
some secret understanding between your uncle's governess and his
amanuensis?"</p>
<p>"Try bromide of potassium," said John. "It's very soothing in twenty-grain
doses."</p>
<p>"Try a pair of spectacles," I retorted, "you most certainly need them;" with
which parting shot I turned on my heel and went off in high dudgeon. I had not
gone twenty yards down the gravel walk of the garden before I saw the very
couple of whom we had just been speaking. They were some little way off, she
leaning against the sundial, he standing in front of her and speaking
earnestly, with occasional jerky gesticulations. With his tall, gaunt figure
towering above her, and the spasmodic motions of his long arms, he might have
been some great bat fluttering over a victim. I remember that that was the
simile which rose in my mind at the time, heightened perhaps by the suggestion
of shrinking and of fear which seemed to me to lie in every curve of her
beautiful figure.</p>
<p>The little picture was such an illustration of the text upon which I had
been preaching, that I had half a mind to go back to the laboratory and bring
the incredulous John out to witness it. Before I had time to come to a
conclusion, however, Copperthorne caught a glimpse of me, and turning away, he
strolled slowly in the opposite direction into the shrubbery, his companion
walking by his side and cutting at the flowers as she passed with her
sunshade.</p>
<p>I went up to my room after this small episode with the intention of pushing
on with my studies, but do what I would my mind wandered away from my books in
order to speculate upon this mystery.</p>
<p>I had learned from John that Copperthorne's antecedents were not of the
best, and yet he had obviously gained enormous power over his almost imbecile
employer. I could understand this fact by observing the infinite pains with
which he devoted himself to the old man's hobby, and the consummate tact with
which he humoured and encouraged his strange poetic whims. But how could f
account for the to me equally obvious power which he wielded over the
governess? She had no whims to be humoured. Mutual love might account for the
tie between them, but my instinct as a man of the world and as an observer of
human nature told me most conclusively that no such love existed. If not love,
it must be fear&mdash;a supposition which was favoured by all that I had
seen.</p>
<p>What, then, had occurred during these two months to cause this
high-spirited, dark-eyed princess to fear the white-faced Englishman with the
soft voice and the gentle manner? That was the problem which I set myself to
solve with an energy and earnestness which eclipsed my ardour for study, and
rendered me superior to the terrors of my approaching examination.</p>
<p>I ventured to approach the subject that same afternoon to Miss Warrender,
whom I found alone in the library, the two little children having gone to spend
the day in the nursery of a neighbouring squire.</p>
<p>"You must be rather lonely when there are no visitors," I remarked. "It does
not seem to be a very lively part of the country."</p>
<p>"Children are always good companions," she answered. "Nevertheless I shall
miss both Mr. Thornton and yourself very much when you go."</p>
<p>"I shall be sorry when the time comes," I said. "I never expected to enjoy
this visit as I have done; still you won't be quite cornpanionless when we are
gone, you'll always have Mr. Copperthorne."</p>
<p>"Yes; we shall always have Mr. Copperthorne." She spoke with a weary
intonation.</p>
<p>"He's a pleasant companion," I remarked; "quiet, well informed, and amiable.
I don't wonder that old Mr. Thurston is so fond of him."</p>
<p>As I spoke in this way I watched my companion intently. There was a slight
flush on her dark cheeks, and she drummed her fingers impatiently against the
arms of the chair.</p>
<p>"His manner may be a little cold sometimes&mdash;" I was continuing, but she
interrupted me, turning on me furiously, with an angry glare in her black
eyes.</p>
<p>"What do you want to talk to me about him for?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I beg pardon," I answered, submissively, "I did not know it was a forbidden
subject."</p>
<p>"I don't wish ever to hear his name," she cried, passionately. "I hate it
and I hate him. Oh, if I had only some one who loved me&mdash;that is, as men
love away over the seas in my own land, I know what I should say to him."</p>
<p>"What would you say?" I asked, astonished at this extraordinary
outburst.</p>
<p>She leaned forward until I seemed to feel the quick pants of her warm breath
upon my face.</p>
<p>"Kill Copperthorne," she said. "That is what I should say to him. Kill
Copperthorne. Then you can come and talk of love to me."</p>
<p>Nothing can describe the intensity of fierceness with which she hissed these
words out from between her white teeth.</p>
<p>She looked so venomous as she spoke that I involuntarily shrank away from
her. Could this pythoness be the demure young lady who sat every day so primly
and quietly at the table of Uncle Jeremy? I had hoped to gain some insight into
her character by my leading question, but I had never expected to conjure up
such a spirit as this. She must have seen the horror and surprise which was
depicted on my face, for her manner changed and she laughed nervously.</p>
<p>"You must really think me mad," she said. "You see it is the Indian training
breaking out again. We do nothing by halves over there&mdash;either loving or
hating."</p>
<p>"And why is it that you hate Mr. Copperthorne?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," she answered, in a subdued voice, "perhaps hate is rather too
strong a term after all. Dislike would be better. There are some people you
cannot help having an antipathy to, even though you are unable to give any
exact reason."</p>
<p>It was evident that she regretted her recent outburst and was endeavouring
to explain it away.</p>
<p>As I saw that she wished to change the conversation, I aided her to do so,
and made some remark about a book of Indian prints which she had taken down
before I came in, and which still lay upon her lap. Uncle Jeremy's collection
was an extensive one, and was particularly rich in works of this class.</p>
<p>"They are not very accurate," she said, turning over the many-coloured
leaves. "This is good, though," she continued, picking out a picture of a
chieftain clad in chain mail with a picturesque turban upon his head. "This is
very good indeed. My father was dressed like that when he rode down on his
white charger and led all the warriors of the Dooab to do battle with the
Feringhees. My father was chosen out from amongst them all, for they knew that
Achmet Genghis Khan was a great priest as well as a great soldier. The people
would be led by none but a tried Borka. He is dead now, and of all those who
followed his banner there are none who are not scattered or slain, whilst I,
his daughter, am a servant in a far land."</p>
<p>"No doubt you will go back to India some day," I said, in a somewhat feeble
attempt at consolation.</p>
<p>She turned the pages over listlessly for a few moments without answering.
Then she gave a sudden little cry of pleasure as she paused at one of the
prints.</p>
<p>"Look at this," she cried, eagerly. "It is one of our wanderers. He is a
Bhuttotee. It is very like."</p>
<p>The picture which excited her so was one which represented a particularly
uninviting-looking native with a small instrument which looked like a miniature
pickaxe in one hand, and a striped handkerchief or roll of linen in the
other.</p>
<p>"That handkerchief is his roomal," she said. "Of course he wouldn't go about
with it openly like that, nor would he bear the sacred axe, but in every other
respect he is as he should be. Many a time have I been with such upon the
moonless nights when the Lughaees were on ahead and the heedless stranger heard
the Pilhaoo away to the left and knew not what it might mean. Ah! that was a
life that was worth the living!"</p>
<p>"And what may a roomal be&mdash;and the Lughaee and all the rest of it?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, they are Indian terms," she answered, with a laugh. "You would not
understand them."</p>
<p>"But," I said, "this picture is marked as Dacoit, and I always thought that
a Dacoit was a robber."</p>
<p>"That is because the English know no better," she observed. "Of course,
Dacoits are robbers, but they call many people robbers who are not really so
Now this man is a holy man and in all probability a Gooroo."</p>
<p>She might have given me more information upon Indian manners and customs,
for it was a subject upon which she loved to talk; but suddenly as I watched
her I saw a change come over her face, and she gazed with a rigid stare at the
window behind me. I looked round, and there peering stealthily round the corner
at us was the face of the amanuensis. I confess that I was startled myself at
the sight, for, with its corpse-like pallor, the head might have been one which
had been severed from his shoulders. He threw open the sash when he saw that he
was observed.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you," he said, looking in, "but don't you think,
Miss Warrender, that it is a pity to be boxed up on such a fine day in a close
room? Won't you come out and take a stroll?"</p>
<p>Though his words were courteous they were uttered in a harsh and almost
menacing voice, so as to sound more like a command than a request. The
governess rose, and without protest or remark glided away to put on her bonnet.
It was another example of Copperthorne's authority over her. As he looked in at
me through the open window a mocking smile played about his thin lips, as
though he would have liked to have taunted me with this display of his power.
With the sun shining in behind him he might have been a demon in a halo. He
stood in this manner for a few moments gazing in at me with concentrated malice
upon his face. Then I heard his heavy footfall scrunching along the gravel path
as he walked round in the direction of the door.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>For some days after the interview in which Miss Warrender confessed her
hatred of the secretary, things ran smoothly at Dunkelthwaite. I had several
long conversations with her as we rambled about the woods and fields with the
two little children, but I was never able to bring her round to the subject of
her outburst in the library, nor did she tell me anything which threw any light
at all upon the problem which interested me so deeply. Whenever I made any
remark which might lead in that direction she either answered me in a guarded
manner or else discovered suddenly that it was high time that the children were
back in their nursery, so that I came to despair of ever learning anything from
her lips.</p>
<p>During this time I studied spasmodically and irregularly. Occasionally old
Uncle Jeremy would shuffle into my room with a roll of manuscript in his hand,
and would read me extracts from his great epic poem. Whenever I felt in need of
company I used to go a-visiting to John's laboratory, and he in his turn would
come to my chamber if he were lonely. Sometimes I used to vary the monotony of
my studies by taking my books out into an arbour in the shrubbery and working
there during the day. As to Copperthorne, I avoided him as much as possible,
and he, for his part, appeared to be by no means anxious to cultivate my
acquaintance.</p>
<p>One day about the second week in June, John came to me with a telegram in
his hand and look of considerable disgust upon his face. "Here's a pretty go!"
he cried. "The governor wants me to go up at once and meet him in London. It's
some legal business, I suppose. He was always threatening to set his affairs in
order, and now he has got an energetic fit and intends to do it."</p>
<p>"I suppose you won't be gone long?" I said.</p>
<p>"A week or two perhaps. It's rather a nuisance, just when I was in a fair
way towards separating that alkaloid."</p>
<p>"You'll find it there when you come back," I said laughing. "There's no one
here who is likely to separate it in your absence."</p>
<p>"What bothers me most is leaving you here," he continued. "It seems such an
inhospitable thing to ask a fellow down to a lonely place like this and then to
run away and leave him."</p>
<p>"Don't you mind about me," I answered, "I have too much to do to be lonely.
Besides, I have found attractions in this place which I never expected. I don't
think any six weeks of my life have ever passed more quickly than the
last."</p>
<p>"Oh, they passed quickly, did they?" said John, and sniggered to himself. I
am convinced that he was still under the delusion that I was hopelessly in love
with the governess.</p>
<p>He went off that day by the early train, promising to write and tell us his
address in town, for he did not know yet at which hotel his father would put
up. I little knew what a difference this trifle would make, nor what was to
occur before I set eyes upon my friend once more. At the time I was by no means
grieved at his departure. It brought the four of us who were left into closer
apposition, and seemed to favour the solving of that problem in which I found
myself from day to day becoming more interested.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile from the house of Dunkelthwaite there is a
straggling little village of the same name, consisting of some twenty or thirty
slate-roofed cottages, with an ivy-clad church hard by and the inevitable
beerhouse. On the afternoon of the very day on which John left us, Miss
Warrender and the two children walked down to the post-office there, and I
volunteered to accompany them.</p>
<p>Copperthorne would have liked well to have either prevented the excursion or
to have gone with us, but fortunately Uncle Jeremy was in the throes of
composition, and the services of his secretary were indispensable to him. It
was a pleasant walk, I remember, for the road was well shaded by trees, and the
birds were singing merrily overhead. We strolled along together, talking of
many things, while the little boy and girl ran on, laughing and romping.</p>
<p>Before you get to the post-office you have to pass the beerhouse already
mentioned. As we walked down the village street we became conscious that a
small knot of people had assembled in front of this building. There were a
dozen or so ragged boys and draggle-tailed girls, with a few bonnetless women,
and a couple of loungers from the bar&mdash;probably as large an assemblage as
ever met together in the annals of that quiet neighbourhood. We could not see
what it was that was exciting their curiosity, but the children scampered on
and quickly returned brimful of information.</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Warrender," Johnnie cried, as he dashed up, panting and eager,
"there's a black man there like the ones you tell us stories about!"</p>
<p>"A gipsy, I suppose," I said.</p>
<p>"No, no," said Johnnie, with decision; "he is blacker than that, isn't he,
May?"</p>
<p>"Blacker than that," the little girl echoed.</p>
<p>"I suppose we had better go and see what this wonderful apparition is," I
said.</p>
<p>As I spoke I glanced at my companion. To my surprise, she was very pale, and
her great black eyes appeared to be luminous with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>"Aren't you well?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Come on!" she cried, eagerly, quickening her step; "come on!"</p>
<p>It was certainly a curious sight which met our eyes when we joined the
little circle of rustics. It reminded me of the description of the opium-eating
Malay whom De Quincey saw in the farmhouse in Scotland. In the centre of the
circle of homely Yorkshire folk there stood an Oriental wanderer, tall, lithe,
and graceful, his linen clothes stained with dust and his brown feet projecting
through his rude shoes. It was evident that he had travelled far and long. He
had a heavy stick in his hand, on which he leaned, while his dark eyes looked
thoughtfully away into space, careless apparently of the throng around him. His
picturesque attire, with his coloured turban and swarthy face, had a strange
and incongruous effect amongst all the prosaic surroundings.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow!" Miss Warrender said to me, speaking in an excited, gasping
voice. "He is tired and hungry, no doubt, and cannot explain his wants. I will
speak to him;" and, going up to the Indian, she said a few words in his native
dialect.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the effect which those few syllables produced. Without
a word the wanderer fell straight down upon his face on the dusty road and
absolutely grovelled at the feet of my companion. I had read of Eastern forms
of abasement when in the presence of a superior, but I could not have imagined
that any human could have expressed such abject humility as was indicated in
this man's attitude.</p>
<p>Miss Warrender spoke again in a sharp and commanding voice, on which he
sprang to his feet and stood with his hands clasped and his eyes cast down,
like a slave in the presence of his mistress. The little crowd, who seemed to
think that the sudden prostration had been the prelude to some conjuring feat
or acrobatic entertainment, looked on amused and interested.</p>
<p>"Should you mind walking on with the children and posting the letters?" the
governess said. "I should like to have a word with this man."</p>
<p>I complied with her request, and when I returned in a few minutes the two
were still conversing. The Indian appeared to be giving a narrative of his
adventures or detailing the causes of his journey, for he spoke rapidly and
excitedly, with quivering fingers and gleaming eyes. Miss Warrender listened
intently, giving an occasional start or exclamation, which showed how deeply
the man's statement interested her.</p>
<p>"I must apologise for detaining you so long in the sun," she said, turning
to me at last. "We must go home, or we shall be late for dinner."</p>
<p>With a few parting sentences, which sounded like commands, she left her
dusky acquaintance still standing in the village street, and we strolled
homewards with the children.</p>
<p>"Well?" I asked, with natural curiosity, when we were out of earshot of the
visitors. "Who is he, and what is he?"</p>
<p>"He comes from the Central Provinces, near the land of the Mahrattas. He is
one of us. It has been quite a shock to me to meet a fellow-countryman so
unexpectedly; I feel quite upset."</p>
<p>"It must have been pleasant for you," I remarked. "Yes, very pleasant," she
said, heartily.</p>
<p>"And why did he fall down like that?"</p>
<p>"Because he knew me to be the daughter of Achmet Genghis Khan," she said,
proudly.</p>
<p>"And what chance has brought him here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's a long story," she said, carelessly. "He has led a wandering life.
How dark it is in this avenue, and how the great branches shoot across! If you
were to crouch on one of those you could drop down on the back of any one who
passed, and they would never know that you were there until they felt your
fingers on their throat."</p>
<p>"What a horrible idea!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Gloomy places always give me gloomy thoughts," she said, lightly. "By the
way, I want you to do me a favour, Mr. Lawrence."</p>
<p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Don't say anything at the house about this poor compatriot of mine. They
might think him a rogue and a vagabond, you know, and order him to be driven
from the village."</p>
<p>"I'm sure Mr. Thurston would do nothing so unkind."</p>
<p>"No; but Mr. Copperthorne might."</p>
<p>"Just as you like," I said; "but the children are sure to tell."</p>
<p>"No, I think not," she answered.</p>
<p>I don't know how she managed to curb their little prattling tongues, but
they certainly preserved silence upon the point, and there was no talk that
evening of the strange visitor who had wandered into our little hamlet.</p>
<p>I had a shrewd suspicion that this stranger from the tropics was no chance
wanderer, but had come to Dunkelthwaite upon some set errand. Next day I had
the best possible evidence that he was still in the vicinity, for I met Miss
Warrender coming down the garden walk with a basketful of scraps of bread and
of meat in her hand. She was in the habit of taking these leavings to sundry
old women in the neighbourhood, so I offered to accompany her.</p>
<p>"Is it old Dame Venables or old Dame Taylforth to-day?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Neither one nor the other," she said, with a smile. "I'll tell you the
truth, Mr. Lawrence, because you have always been a good friend to me, and I
feel I can trust you. These scraps are for my poor countryman. I'll hang the
basket here on this branch, and he will get it."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's still about, then," I observed.</p>
<p>"Yes, he's still in the neighbourhood."</p>
<p>"You think he will find it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, trust him for that," she said. "You don't blame me for helping him, do
you? You would do the same if you lived among Indians and suddenly came upon an
Englishman. Come to the hothouse and look at the flowers."</p>
<p>We walked round to the conservatory together. When we came back the basket
was still hanging to the branch, but the contents were gone. She took it down
with a laugh and carried it in with her.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that since this interview with her countryman the day before
her spirits had become higher and her step freer and more elastic. It may have
been imagination, but it appeared to me also that she was not as constrained as
usual in the presence of Copperthorne, and that she met his glances more
fearlessly, and was less under the influence of his will.</p>
<p>And now I am coming to that part of this statement of mine which describes
how I first gained an insight into the relation which existed between those two
strange mortals, and learned the terrible truth about Miss Warrender, or of the
Princess Achmet Genghis, as I should prefer to call her, for assuredly she was
the descendant of the fierce fanatical warrior rather than of her gentle
mother.</p>
<p>To me the revelation came as a shock, the effect of which I can never
forget. It is possible that in the way in which I have told the story,
emphasising those facts which had a bearing upon her, and omitting those which
had not, my readers have already detected the strain which ran in her blood. As
for myself, I solemnly aver that up to the last moment I had not the smallest
suspicion of the truth. Little did I know what manner of woman this was, whose
hand I pressed in friendship, and whose voice was music to my ears. Yet it is
my belief, looking back, that she was really well disposed to me, and would not
willingly have harmed me.</p>
<p>It was in this manner that the revelation came about. I think I have
mentioned that there was a certain arbour in the shrubbery in which I was
accustomed to study during the daytime. One night, about ten o'clock, I found
on going to my room that I had left a book on gynwcology in this summer-house,
and as I intended to do a couple of hours' work before turning in, I started
off with the intention of getting it. Uncle Jeremy and the servants had already
gone to bed, so I slipped downstairs very quietly and turned the key gently in
the front door. Once in the open air, I hurried rapidly across the lawn, and so
into the shrubbery, with the intention of regaining my property and returning
as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>I had hardly passed the little wooden gate and entered the plantation before
I heard the sound of talking, and knew that I had chanced to stumble upon one
of those nocturnal conclaves which I had observed from my window. The voices
were those of the secretary and of the governess, and it was clear to me, from
the direction in which they sounded, that they were sitting in the arbour and
conversing together without any suspicion of the presence of a third person. I
have ever held that eavesdropping, under any circumstances, is a dishonourable
practice, and curious as I was to know what passed between these two, I was
about to cough or give some other signal of my presence, when suddenly I heard
some words of Copperthorne's which brought me to a halt with every faculty
overwhelmed with horrified amazement.</p>
<p>"They'll think he died of apoplexy," were the words which sounded clearly
and distinctly through the peaceful air in the incisive tones of the
amanuensis.</p>
<p>I stood breathless, listening with all my ears. Every thought of announcing
my presence had left me. What was the crime which these ill-assorted
conspirators were hatching upon this lovely summer's night.</p>
<p>I heard the deep sweet tones of her voice, but she spoke so rapidly, and in
such a subdued manner, that I could not catch the words. I could tell by the
intonation that she was under the influence of deep emotion. I drew nearer on
tip-toe, with my ears straining to catch every sound. The moon was not up yet,
and under the shadows of the trees it was very dark. There was little chance of
my being observed.</p>
<p>"Eaten his bread, indeed!" the secretary said, derisively. "You are not
usually so squeamish. You did not think of that in the case of little
Ethel."</p>
<p>"I was mad! I was mad!" she ejaculated in a broken voice. "I had prayed much
to Buddha and to the great Bhowanee, and it seemed to me that in this land of
unbelievers it would be a great and glorious thing for me, a lonely woman, to
act up to the teachings of my great father. There are few women who are
admitted into the secrets of our faith, and it was but by an accident that the
honour came upon me. Yet, having once had the path pointed out to me, I have
walked straight and fearlessly, and the great Gooroo Ramdeen Singh has said
that even in my fourteenth year I was worthy to sit upon the cloth of the
Tupounee with the other Bhuttotees. Yet I swear by the sacred pickaxe that I
have grieved much over this, for what had the poor child done that she should
be sacrificed!"</p>
<p>"I fancy that my having caught you has had more to do with your repentance
than the moral aspect of the case," Copperthorne said, with a sneer. "I may
have had my misgivings before, but it was only when I saw you rising up with
the handkerchief in your hand that I knew for certain that we were honoured by
the presence of a Princess of the Thugs. An English scaffold would be rather a
prosaic end for such a romantic being."</p>
<p>"And you have used your knowledge ever since to crush all the life out of
me," she said, bitterly. "You have made my existence a burden to me."</p>
<p>"A burden to you!" he said, in an altered voice. "You know what my feelings
are towards you. If I have occasionally governed you by the fear of exposure it
was only because I found you were insensible to the milder influence of
love."</p>
<p>"Love!" she cried, bitterly. "How could I love a man who held a shameful
death for ever before my eyes. But let us come to the point. You promise me my
unconditional liberty if I do this one thing for you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Copperthorne answered; "you may go where you will when this is done.
I shall forget what I saw here in the shrubbery."</p>
<p>"You swear it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I swear it."</p>
<p>"I would do anything for my freedom," she said.</p>
<p>"We can never have such a chance again," Copperthorne cried. "Young Thurston
is gone, and this friend of his sleeps heavily, and is too stupid to suspect.
The will is made out in my favour, and if the old man dies every stock and
stone of the great estate will be mine."</p>
<p>"Why don't you do it yourself, then?" she asked.</p>
<p>"It's not in my line," he said. "Besides, I have not got the knack. That
roomal, or whatever you call it, leaves no mark. That's the advantage of
it."</p>
<p>"It is an accursed thing to slay one's benefactor."</p>
<p>"But it is a great thing to serve Bhowanee, the goddess of murder. I know
enough of your religion to know that. Would not your father do it if he were
here?"</p>
<p>"My father was the greatest of all the Borkas of Jublepore," she said,
proudly. "He has slain more than there are days in the year."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have met him for a thousand pounds," Copperthorne remarked, with
a laugh. "But what would Achmet Genghis Khan say now if he saw his daughter
hesitate with such a chance before her of serving the gods? You have done
excellently so far. He may well have smiled when the infant soul of young Ethel
was wafted up to this god or ghoul of yours. Perhaps this is not the first
sacrifice you have made. How about the daughter of this charitable German
merchant? Ah, I see in your face that I am right again! After such deeds you do
wrong to hesitate now when there is no danger and all shall be made easy to
you. Besides that, the deed will free you from your existence here, which
cannot be particularly pleasant with a rope, so to speak, round your neck the
whole time. If it is to be done it must be done at once. He might rewrite his
will at any moment, for he is fond of the lad, and is as changeable as a
weather-cock."</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and a silence so profound that I seemed to hear my
own heart throbbing in the darkness.</p>
<p>"When shall it be done?" she asked at last.</p>
<p>"Why not to-morrow night?"</p>
<p>"How am I to get to him?"</p>
<p>"I shall leave his door open," Copperthorne said. "He sleeps heavily, and I
shall leave a night-light burning, so that you may see your way."</p>
<p>"And afterwards?"</p>
<p>"Afterwards you will return to your room. In the morning it will be
discovered that our poor employer has passed away in his sleep. It will also be
found that he has left all his worldly goods as a slight return for the devoted
labours of his faithful secretary. Then the services of Miss Warrender the
governess being no longer required, she may go back to her beloved country or
to anywhere else that she fancies. She can run away with Mr. John Lawrence,
student of medicine, if she pleases."</p>
<p>"You insult me," she said, angrily; and then, after a pause. "You must meet
me to-morrow night before I do this."</p>
<p>"Why so?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Because there may be some last instructions which I may require."</p>
<p>"Let it be here, then, at twelve," he said.</p>
<p>"No, not here. It is too near the house. Let us meet under the great oak at
the head of the avenue."</p>
<p>"Where you will," he answered, sulkily; "but mind, I'm not going to be with
you when you do it."</p>
<p>"I shall not ask you," she said, scornfully. "I think we have said all that
need be said to-night."</p>
<p>I heard the sound of one or other of them rising to their feet, and though
they continued to talk I did not stop to hear more, but crept quietly out from
my place of concealment and scudded across the dark lawn and in through the
door, which I closed behind me. It was only when I had regained my room and had
sunk back into my armchair that I was able to collect my scattered senses and
to think over the terrible conversation to which I had listened. Long into the
hours of the night I sat motionless, meditating over every word that I had
heard and endeavouring to form in my mind some plan of action for the
future.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>The Thugs! I had heard of the wild fanatics of that name who are found in
the central part of India, and whose distorted religion represents murder as
being the highest and purest of all the gifts which a mortal can offer to the
Creator. I remember an account of them which I had read in the works of Colonel
Meadows Taylor, of their secrecy, their organisation, their relentlessness, and
the terrible power which their homicidal craze has over every other mental or
moral faculty. I even recalled now that the roomal&mdash;a word which I had
heard her mention more than once&mdash;was the sacred handkerchief with which
they were wont to work their diabolical purpose. She was already a woman when
she had left them, and being, according to her own account, the, daughter of
their principal leader, it was no wonder that the varnish of civilisation had
not eradicated all her early impressions or prevented the breaking out of
occasional fits of fanaticism. In one of these apparently she had put an end to
poor Ethel, having carefully prepared an alibi to conceal her crime, and it was
Copperthorne's accidental discovery of this murder which gave him his power
over his strange associate. Of all deaths that by hanging is considered among
these tribes to be the most impious and degrading, and her knowledge that she
had subjected herself to this death by the law of the land was evidently the
reason why she had found herself compelled to subject her will and tame her
imperious nature when in the presence of the amanuensis.</p>
<p>As to Copperthorne himself, as I thought over what he had done, and what he
proposed to do, a great horror and loathing filled my whole soul. Was this his
return for the kindness lavished upon him by the poor old man? He had already
cozened him into signing away his estates, and now, for fear some prickings of
conscience should cause him to change his mind, he had determined to put it out
of his power ever to write a codicil. All this was bad enough, but the acme of
all seemed to be that, too cowardly to effect his purpose with his own hand, he
had made use of this unfortunate woman's horrible conceptions of religion in
order to remove Uncle Jeremy in such a way that no suspicion could possibly
fall upon the real culprit. I determined in my mind that, come what might, the
amanuensis should not escape from the punishment due to his crimes.</p>
<p>But what was I to do? Had I known my friend's address I should have
telegraphed for him in the morning, and he could have been back in
Dunkelthwaite before nightfall. Unfortunately John was the worst of
correspondents, and though he had been gone for some days we had had no word
yet of his whereabouts. There were three maid-servants in the house, but no
man, with the exception of old Elijah; nor did I know of any upon whom I could
rely in the neighbourhood. This, however, was a small matter, for I knew that
in personal strength I was more than a match for the secretary, and I had
confidence enough in myself to feel that my resistance alone would prevent any
possibility of the plot being carried out.</p>
<p>The question was, what were the best steps for me to take under the
circumstances? My first impulse was to wait until morning, and then to quietly
go or send to the nearest police-station and summon a couple of constables. I
could then hand Copperthorne and his female accomplice over to justice and
narrate the conversation which I had overheard. On second thoughts this plan
struck me as being a very impracticable one. What grain of evidence had I
against them except my story? which, to people who did not know me, would
certainly appear a very wild and improbable one. I could well imagine too the
plausible voice and imperturbable manner with which Copperthorne would oppose
the accusation, and how he would dilate upon the which I bore both him and his
companion on account of their mutual affection. How easy it would be for him to
make a third person believe that I was trumping up a story in the hope of
injuring a rival, and how difficult for me to make any one credit that this
clerical-looking gentleman and this stylishly-dressed young lady were two
beasts of prey who were hunting in couples! I felt that it would be a great
mistake for me to show my hand before I was sure of the game.</p>
<p>The alternative was to say nothing and to let things take their course,
being always ready to step in when the evidence against the conspirators
appeared to be conclusive. This was the course which recommended itself to my
young adventurous disposition, and it also appeared to be the one most likely
to lead to conclusive results. When at last at early dawn I stretched myself
upon my bed and I had fully made up my mind to retain my knowledge in my own
breast, and to trust to myself entirely for the defeat of the murderous plot
which I had overheard.</p>
<p>Old Uncle Jeremy was in high spirits next morning after breakfast, and
insisted upon reading aloud a scene from Shelley's "Cenci," a work for which he
had a profound admiration. Copperthorne sat silent and inscrutable by his side,
save when he threw in a suggestion or uttered an exclamation of admiration.
Miss Warrender appeared to be lost in thought, and it seemed to me more than
once that I saw tears in her dark eyes. It was strange for me to watch the
three of them and to think of the real relation in which they stood to each
other. My heart warmed towards my little red-faced host with the quaint
head-gear and the old-fashioned ways. I vowed to myself that no harm should
befall him while I had power to prevent it.</p>
<p>The day wore along slowly and drearily. It was impossible for me to settle
down to work, so I wandered restlessly about the corridors of the old-fashioned
house and over the garden. Copperthorne was with Uncle Jeremy upstairs, and I
saw little of him. Twice when I was striding up and down outside I perceived
the governess coming with the children in my direction, but on each occasion I
avoided her by hurrying away. I felt that I could not speak to her without
showing the intense horror with which she inspired me, and so betraying my
knowledge of what had transpired the night before. She noticed that I shunned
her, for at luncheon, when my eyes caught hers for a moment, she flashed across
a surprised and injured glance, to which, however, I made no response.</p>
<p>The afternoon post brought a letter from John telling us that he was
stopping at the Langham. I knew that it was now impossible for him to be of any
use to me in the way of sharing the responsibility of whatever might occur, but
I nevertheless thought it my duty to telegraph to him and let him know that his
presence was desirable. This involved a long walk to the station, but that was
useful as helping me to while away the time, and I felt a weight off my mind
when I heard the clicking of the needles which told me that my message was
flying upon its way.</p>
<p>When I reached the avenue gate on my return from Ingleton I found our old
serving-man Elijah standing there, apparently in a violent passion.</p>
<p>"They says as one rat brings others," he said to me, touching his hat, "and
it seems as it be the same with they darkies."</p>
<p>He had always disliked the governess on account of what he called her
"uppish ways."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, then?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It's one o' they furriners a-hidin' and a-prowlin'," said the old man. "I
seed him here among the bushes, and I sent him off wi' a bit o' my mind.
Lookin' after the hens as like as not, or maybe wantin' to burn the house and
murder us all in our beds. I'll go down to the village, Muster Lawrence, and
see what he's after," and he hurried away in a paroxysm of senile anger.</p>
<p>This little incident made a considerable impression on me, and I thought
seriously over it as I walked up the long avenue. It was clear that the
wandering Hindoo was still hanging about the premises. He was a factor whom I
had forgotten to take into account. If his compatriot enlisted him as an
accomplice in her dark plans, it was possible that the three of them might be
too many for me. Still it appeared to me to be improbable that she should do
so, since she had taken such pains to conceal his presence from
Copperthorne.</p>
<p>I was half tempted to take Elijah into my confidence, but on second thoughts
I came to the conclusion that a man of his age would be worse than useless as
an ally.</p>
<p>About seven o'clock I was going up to my room when I met the secretary, who
asked me whether I could tell him where Miss Warrender was. I answered that I
had not seen her.</p>
<p>"It's a singular thing," he said, "that no one has seen her since
dinner-time. The children don't know where she is. I particularly want to speak
to her."</p>
<p>He hurried on with an agitated and disturbed expression upon his
features.</p>
<p>As to me, Miss Warrender's absence did not seem a matter of surprise. No
doubt she was out in the shrubbery somewhere, nerving herself for the terrible
piece of work which she had undertaken to do. I closed my door behind me and
sat down, with a book in my hand, but with my mind too much excited to
comprehend the contents. My plan of campaign had been already formed. I
determined to be within sight of their trysting-place, to follow them, and to
interfere at the moment when my interference would have most effect. I had
chosen a thick, knobby stick, dear to my student heart, and with this I knew
that I was master of the situation, for I had ascertained that Copperthorne had
no firearms.</p>
<p>I do not remember any period of my life when the hours passed so slowly as
did those which I spent in my room that night. Far away I heard the mellow
tones of the Dunklethwaite clock as it struck the hours of eight and then of
nine, and then, after an interminable pause, of ten. After that it seemed as
though time had stopped altogether as I paced my little room, fearing and yet
longing for the hour as men will when some great ordeal has to be faced. All
things have an end, however, and at last there came pealing through the still
night air the first clear stroke which announced the eleventh hour. Then I
rose, and, putting on my soft slippers, I seized my stick and slipped quietly
out of my room and down the creaking old-fashioned staircase. I could hear the
stertorous snoring of Uncle Jeremy upon the floor above. I managed to feel my
way to the door through the darkness, and having opened it passed out into the
beautiful starlit night.</p>
<p>I had to be very careful of my movements, because the moon shone so brightly
that it was almost as light as day. I hugged the shadow of the house until I
reached the garden hedge, and then, crawling down in its shelter, I found
myself safe in the shrubbery in which I had been the night before. Through this
I made my way, treading very cautiously and gingerly, so that not a stick
snapped beneath my feet. In this way I advanced until I found myself among the
brushwood at the edge of the plantation and within full view of the great
oak-tree which stood at the upper end of the avenue.</p>
<p>There was someone standing under the shadow of the oak. At first I could
hardly make out who it was, but presently the figure began to move, and, coming
out into a silvery patch where the moon shone down between two branches, looked
impatiently to left and to right. Then I saw that it was Copperthorne, who was
waiting alone. The governess apparently had not yet kept her appointment.</p>
<p>As I wished to hear as well as to see, I wormed my way along under the dark
shadows of the trunks in the direction of the oak. When I stopped I was not
more than fifteen paces from the spot where the tall gaunt figure of the
amanuensis looked grim and ghastly in the shifting light. He paced about
uneasily, now disappearing in the shadow, now reappearing in the silvery
patches where the moon broke through the covering above him. It was evident
from his movements that he was puzzled and disconcerted at the non-appearance
of his accomplice. Finally he stationed himself under a great branch which
concealed his figure, while from beneath it he commanded a view of the gravel
drive which led down from the house, and along which, no doubt, he expected
Miss Warrender to come.</p>
<p>I was still lying in my hiding-place, congratulating myself inwardly at
having gained a point from which I could hear all without risk of discovery,
when my eye lit suddenly upon something which made my heart rise to my mouth
and almost caused me to utter an ejaculation which would have betrayed my
presence.</p>
<p>I have said that Copperthorne was standing immediately under one of the
great branches of the oak-tree. Beneath this all was plunged in the deepest
shadow, but the upper part of the branch itself was silvered over by the light
of the moon. As I gazed I became conscious that down this luminous branch
something was crawling&mdash;a flickering, inchoate something, almost
indistinguishable from the branch itself, and yet slowly and steadily writhing
its way down it. My eyes, as I looked, became more accustomed to the light, and
then this indefinite something took form and substance. It was a human
being&mdash;a man&mdash;the Indian whom I had seen in the village. With his
arms and legs twined round the great limb, he was shuffling his way down as
silently and almost as rapidly as one of his native snakes.</p>
<p>Before I had time to conjecture the meaning of his presence he was directly
over the spot where the secretary stood, his bronzed body showing out hard and
clear against the disc of moon behind him. I saw him take something from round
his waist, hesitate for a moment, as though judging his distance, and then
spring downwards, crashing through the intervening foliage. There was a heavy
thud, as of two bodies falling together, and then there rose on the night air a
noise as of some one gargling his throat, followed by a succession of croaking
sounds, the remembrance of which will haunt me to my dying day.</p>
<p>Whilst this tragedy had been enacted before my eyes its entire
unexpectedness and its horror had bereft me of the power of acting in any way.
Only those who have been in a similar position can imagine the utter paralysis
of mind and body which comes upon a man in such straits, and prevents him from
doing the thousand and one things which may be suggested afterwards as having
been appropriate to the occasion. When those notes of death, however, reached
my ears I shook off my lethargy and ran forward with a loud cry from my place
of concealment. At the sound the young Thug sprang from his victim with a snarl
like a wild beast driven from a carcase, and made off down the avenue at such a
pace that I felt it to be impossible for me to overtake him. I ran to the
secretary and raised his head. His face was purple and horribly distorted. I
loosened his shirt-collar and did all I could to restore him, but it was
useless. The roomal had done its work, and he was dead.</p>
<p>I have little more to add to this strange tale of mine. If I have been
somewhat long-winded in the telling of it, I feel that I owe no apology for
that, for I have simply set the successive events down in a plain unvarnished
fashion, and the narrative would be incomplete without any one of them. It
transpired afterwards that Miss Warrender had caught the 7.20 London train, and
was safe in the metropolis before any search could be made for her. As to the
messenger of death whom she had left behind to keep her appointment with
Copperthorne under the old oak-tree, he was never either heard of or seen
again. There was a hue and cry over the whole countryside, but nothing came of
it. No doubt the fugitive passed the days in sheltered places, and travelled
rapidly at night, living on such scraps as can sustain an Oriental, until he
was out of danger.</p>
<p>John Thornton returned next day, and I poured all the facts into his
astonished ears. He agreed with me that it was best perhaps not to speak of
what I knew concerning Copperthcirne's plans and the reasons which kept him out
so late upon that summer's night. Thus even the county police have never known
the full story of that strange tragedy, and they certainly never shall, unless,
indeed, the eyes of some of them should chance to fall upon this narrative.
Poor Uncle Jeremy mourned the loss of his secretary for months, and many were
the verses which he poured forth in the form of epitaphs and of "In Memoriam"
poems. He has been gathered to his fathers himself since then, and the greater
part of his estate has, I am glad to say, descended to the rightful heir, his
nephew.</p>
<p>There is only one point on which I should like to make a remark. How was it
that the wandering Thug came to Dunkelthwaite? This question has never been
cleared up; but I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind, nor I think can
anyone have who considers the facts of the case, that there was no chance about
his appearance. The sect in India were a large and powerful body, and when they
came to look around for a fresh leader, they naturally bethought them of the
beautiful daughter of their late chief. It would be no difficult matter to
trace her to Calcutta, to Germany, and finally to Dunkelthwaite. He had come,
no doubt, with the message that she was not forgotten in India, and that a warm
welcome awaited her if she chose to join her scattered tribesmen. This may seem
far-fetched, but it is the opinion which I have always entertained upon the
matter.</p>
<p>I began this statement by a quotation from a letter, and I shall end it by
one. This was from an old friend, Dr. B.C. Haller, a man of encyclopmdic
knowledge, and particularly well versed in Indian manners and customs. It is
through his kindness that I am able to reproduce the various native words which
I heard from time to time from the lips of Miss Warrender, but which I should
not have been able to recall to my memory had he not suggested them to me. This
is a letter in which he comments upon the matter, which I had mentioned to him
in conversation some time previously:<br>
<br></p>
<p>"My dear Lawrence,&mdash;I promised to write to you <i>re</i> Thuggee, but
my time has been so occupied that it is only now that I can redeem my pledge. I
was much interested in your unique experience, and should much like to have
further talk with you upon the subject. I may inform you that it is most
unusual for a woman to be initiated into the mysteries of Thuggee, and it arose
in this case probably from her having accidently or by design tasted the sacred
goor, which was the sacrifice offered by the gang after each murder. Any one
doing this must become an acting Thug, whatever the rank, sex, or condition.
Being of noble blood she would then rapidly pass through the different grades
of Tilhaee, or scout, Lughaee, or grave-digger, Shumsheea, or holder of the
victim's hands, and finally of Bhuttotee, or strangler. In all this she would
be instructed by her Gooroo, or spiritual adviser, whom she mentions in your
account as having been her own father, who was a Borka, or an expert Thug.
Having once attained this position, I do not wonder that her fanatical
instincts broke out at times. The Pilhaoo which she mentions in one place was
the omen on the left hand, which, if it is followed by the Thibaoo, or omen on
the right, was considered to be an indication that all would go well. By the
way, you mention that the old coachman saw the Hindoo lurking about among the
bushes in the morning. Do you know what he was doing? I am very much mistaken
if he was not digging Copperthorne's grave, for it is quite opposed to Thug
customs to kill a man without having some receptacle prepared for his body. As
far as I know only one English officer in India has ever fallen a victim to the
fraternity, and that was Lieutenant Monsell, in 1812. Since then Colonel
Sleeman has stamped it out to a great extent, though it is unquestionable that
it flourishes far more than the authorities suppose. Truly 'the dark places of
the earth are full of cruelty,' and nothing but the Gospel will ever
effectually dispel that darkness. You are very welcome to publish these few
remarks if they seem to you to throw any light upon your narrative.</p>
<p>"Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>"B.C. HALLER."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>THE STONE OF BOXMAN'S DRIFT</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Boy's Own Paper,</i> Christmas number, 1887.</h3>
<hr>
<p>The sun had sunk down behind the distant Griqualand mountains and had left a
few bright slashes upon the western sky, which faded slowly from scarlet into
pink and from that into the prevailing grey. A deep purplish haze lay over
veldt, and kopje, and kloof. Through the gathering twilight the Vaal river lay
like a silver serpent, winding its way through valley and gorge, until it lost
itself amid the mists of the horizon. Here and there along its course a group
of glittering twinkling yellow lights, like golden pendants on a silver string,
marked the position of the score of hamlets and townships which are studded
along its banks.</p>
<p>But how come towns and hamlets to be there? To the north stretch the wilds
of Bechuanaland, where the savage and the wild beast are still contending their
world-old quarrel. It is the desolate kingdom of the two-footed man-slayer and
of the four-footed man-eater. To the south lies a barren and unprofitable
region, where water is scarce, and the dry withered veldt grass can hardly
support the flocks of gaunt ill-fed sheep which roam over it. The east and west
are still the homes of three Kaffir tribes, who have slowly and sullenly
retreated before the advancing tide of civilisation. How comes it, then, that
men are so ready to risk their lives and their property in the valley of the
Vaal? The answer is the old, old one. It is the search for riches that brings
them there. Of all the thousands who live down there, there is not one who does
not hope that a single stroke of a pick may send him home some day a wealthy
man, to take his place among the magnates of his native shire. To the eyes of
hope these scattered shanties and dilapidated huts are the porticos which lead
up to honour, position, wealth, all that can place a man above his fellows. For
in this desolate valley, amid the sordid clay and gravel, lies buried that
which can lend state to the stately monarch, and beauty to the beautiful woman;
that which rejoices the soul of the covetous and pleases the eyes of the
fastidious. As surely as California is the home of gold, and Nevada of silver,
so is this wild and desolate African valley the chosen seat and throne of the
most precious of the products of nature, the regal diamond.</p>
<p>Who can say by what convulsion and cataclysm of nature they come to be
there? those sparkling fragments of carbon, lying scattered broadcast among the
gneiss and the felspar, and other humbler crystalline brethren. A poor Boer,
trekking through in his waggon, observes his children playing with a glittering
stone. Struck by its appearance, he takes it with him to Natal, where it is
pronounced to be a diamond of the purest water. The news spreads fast over the
whole habitable globe. There is in very truth a valley as marvellous as that of
Sindbad, where a king's ransom may be picked up for the stooping. From every
country, by land and by water, on foot, on horseback, in buggy or in waggon,
the searchers after wealth converge upon it. Neither savage man nor savage
beast can deter them from their purpose. And so the mining camps spring up and
the pits are dug, and nature's hidden wealth is torn from her, and pressed into
the service of restless avaricious man.</p>
<p>But where money is all other things must come even in the heart of savage
Africa. The store enlarges and becomes an emporium, while the liquor saloon
expands into the hotel. The bank, the police-station, and the church are all
found to be necessary adjuncts of civilisation. Thus, at the time of which I
write, the hamlet of Dutoitspan had grown into the flourishing city of
Kimberley, while all the other camps, which extended for sixty miles or more
along the Vaal river, bore evident signs of prosperity, as befitted a
settlement which was turning out a million or more of money every year.
Luxuries were very dear, but they were attainable. Frock coats and felt hats
were occasionally to be seen in the streets. Now and again the rough
inhabitants rose superior to the law, and argued with six-shooters, or
emphasised their remarks with knives, but in spite of these occasional
outbreaks, Peniel, Winter Rush, Blue Jacket, or Hebron were by no means rowdy
localities. The work was too hard and constant to allow of dissipation. A
successful digger might at long intervals indulge in a night's orgy, and be
found lying heavy with whisky on the roadway in the morning, but the necessity
of working his claim was too urgent to allow him to devote much of his time to
the consumption of alcohol. Vice is not seldom the offspring of idleness, and
here all were busy.</p>
<p>A mile or so from the camp at Winter Rush there is a small gulch, or ravine,
named Boxman's Drift, which is a mere rocky cleft in the hill, with a small
stream running down the centre. This locality had been frequently prospected,
and several experimental pits sunk in it, but with so little success that it
had long been abandoned as useless. It chanced, however, in 1872, that two
Englishmen, finding every other claim occupied, erected a hut in this lonely
gulch, and succeeded, either through hard work or good luck, in making their
workings pay their way. Indeed, after a year or two they struck pay gravel, and
were able to enlarge their claim and to hire a couple of Kaffirs to assist them
in the work. They were steady, industrious men, quiet in their habits, loyal to
each other, and accustomed to work from daybreak to sunset during six days out
of the seven. On the evening in question they had remained in their pit digging
and washing, until light failed them, when the elder, Bill Stewart, clambered
reluctantly out, and reaching down a powerful hand, pulled his partner up after
him.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Bill," said the latter, a slim, flaxen-haired man
in the prime of life, "if we are going to make this pit much deeper we shall
need a cord and a windlass. It's all very well for giants like you, but it
would take me all my time to get out if I were alone."</p>
<p>"We'll set Pompey to cut steps," the other answered. "Talking about deep
places, d'ye see that flaw in the rock?" pointing with his shovel to a dark
crack which zigzagged along one side of the valley. "That's deep enough. It's
my belief that it extends to somewhere near the centre of the earth&mdash;or
maybe right through to old England. 'Twould save postage if we could drop our
letters through."</p>
<p>"Aye, it's very deep," said his companion. "The day you went to Kimberley I
tried it with a beer-bottle bent on to a hundred fathoms of string, but I never
touched bottom."</p>
<p>"I'll try the beer-bottle without the string, for I am as dry as a chip,"
said Bill Stewart, slinging his tools over his shoulder. "Have you the take,
Headley?"</p>
<p>"All safe."</p>
<p>"Then come along, and we'll reckon it up at the hut."</p>
<p>The hut in question was a square wooden shanty which had been erected on
entirely novel architectural principles by Stewart, or Big Bill, as he was
usually called in the camps. He was a stolid, slow-tempered man; but if there
was a subject upon which he was thin-skinned it was when any one ventured to
hint that there was any room for improvement in Azalea Cottage, as he
grandiloquently termed it. It was in vain to quote against it any obvious
defect, for Bill would at once proceed to prove that that had been specially
introduced, and was the result of his own care and forethought.</p>
<p>"Crooked," he would say; "yes, it's not one of your twopenny-halfpenny
square-faced blocks that look as if they were turned out by a machine at so
much a dozen. It's a select house, sir. There is style about it. Chinks! Why,
yes, sir, I like chinks. They promote ventilation, and all good architects aim
at that. I took some trouble to work all those chinks in. Holes in the roof?
Well, it's an advantage to know when it's raining without going outside to
look. Besides, it's handy when the fire smokes. We'd all have been smothered if
I hadn't thought to leave those holes there." These were Bill Stewart's usual
answers to the casual and inquisitive stranger; but should the banter proceed
too far, an angry light would appear in his big blue eyes. "That house, sir,"
he would remark, "is good enough for my pard, Headley Dean, who is a gentleman
born, and so I guess it's good enough for you!" At which descent to
personalities the stranger, if he were a wise man, would shift the conversation
to the price of stones, or the latest blunder of the Cape Town Government.</p>
<p>The two partners, as they sat opposite to one another on either side of the
blazing fire, were a remarkable contrast to each other. Headley Dean, with his
crisp, neatly-trimmed hair and beard, his quick, glancing eyes, and his
nervous, impulsive ways, had something of the Celt, both in his appearance and
in his manner. Eager, active, energetic, he gave the impression of a man who
must succeed in the world, but who might be a little unscrupulous in his
methods of doing so. Big Bill, on the other hand, quiet, unimpressionable, and
easy-going, with a sweeping yellow beard and open Saxon countenance, may have
had a stronger and deeper nature than his partner, but was inferior to him in
fertility of resource, and in decision of character in all the minor matters of
life. This superior readiness made the big man look up to the other and bow to
his opinions in a manner that was almost ludicrous considering the relative
size and physical strength of the pair.</p>
<p>"Well, and how much have we taken?" asked Stewart, stretching his
mud-bespattered boots up to the blaze.</p>
<p>"Not very much," said the other, stirring his pannikin of tea and looking
down at the small, flat box in which the day's takings had been placed. "There
are fourteen stones of a sort, but there's not one worth more than a few
shillings. If we get three pound for the lot it's as much as they are
worth."</p>
<p>Bill Stewart whistled. "Our working expenses are close on two pound a day,"
he remarked. "We won't make a fortune at this rate!"</p>
<p>Headley Dean took a flat tin case from a shelf, and having unlocked it, laid
it upon the table. It was divided into compartments, and was half-full of
diamonds, arranged in their different classes. He proceeded to examine each of
the stones taken that day, and to assign them to their various categories.</p>
<p>"These three are off-coloured," said he. "That makes a hundred and eighteen
off-coloured stones which we hold."</p>
<p>"Better sell," suggested Bill Stewart, lighting his pipe with an ember.</p>
<p>"Better do nothing of the sort!" replied his partner, curtly. "You might as
well give them away. Why, the market is at its very lowest!"</p>
<p>"Hold on to them then," said the other, puffing philosophically.</p>
<p>"I intend to. Here are twin stones. They are no great shakes. And here are
four flawed ones, and two smoky. Only one pure coloured stone among the lot,
and it so small as to be almost worthless. Yet we hear of other fellows getting
unexpected pieces of luck. Look at that fellow over at Murphy turning up a
twenty thousand pounder out of a claim that had ruined four men before him! Why
are we never to have a show? Why are we to be always at this drudgery while the
best years of our life are passing over our heads? And you can sit there and
smoke, and look as contented as though we hadn't a wish unsatisfied." He locked
up the box with a vicious snap, and replaced it with a bang upon the shelf.</p>
<p>"Well, pard," said the big miner, "to tell the truth, I think we have a deal
to be thankful for. If we don't win we don't lose. We pay the boys and the
licences, and we bank a few hundreds. There's many a dead-broke down there in
the valley would be glad to swap with us. If we hang on long enough we must
come on a streak of luck. You keep your beak in the air and wait for it."</p>
<p>"It's a precious long time coming," the other remarked, peevishly.</p>
<p>"All the more welcome when it does come. Now, suppose&mdash;just suppose we
was to hit on a real hundred carat pure-water stone, and your share was to be
ten thousand, and my share was to be ten thousand, what would you do with your
share, eh?"</p>
<p>"What would I do?" said Dean, nursing his knee, and staring into the fire
with glistening eyes. "What would I not do? I would take my natural position in
the world once more as a gentleman. I would wash the dirt of labour from my
hands for ever. Is it not the hope of some such chance that spurs me on to dig
like a mole in this filthy gravel, or to stay day after day knee-deep in the
mud of the gulches? I should return to society and to the world."</p>
<p>"Hum! That's just it," Big Bill remarked, ruefully. "You and me's been thick
enough in these days, but if our luck were to come you'd mount a play hat and a
boiled shirt and sail right away into society, which might be glad enough to
see you, but would look twice at your pardner. It would be Sir Edward this, or
My Lord that, and goodbye to old Bill Stewart."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, man," said Headley Dean, "success would never alter me. We have
worked together and we shall rise together. Here's my hand on it. But
you&mdash;what would you do with your money in case we had any such piece of
luck?"</p>
<p>"Build a house," his companion answered, with decision. "Build a house, and
boss the job myself. It should be in the country just in the very snuggiest and
blue-bloodiest bit of England. It should be like the houses of the nobles and
gentry, big and square, with about half a hundred flagstaffs stuck on the roof,
and a Union Jack flying from each. None of your grey stone, you understand, but
the blazing bricks, with ivy and ancestral oaks and balconies, and the family
tree stuck up above the hall door, all in the best o' taste."</p>
<p>Headley Dean laughed languidly at his comrade's ideal country house.</p>
<p>"It would be something between a grand-stand and a private lunatic asylum,"
he remarked. "But I fear you won't have the chance of building it just yet
awhile. Have you seen my pipe?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I seed it lying in the claim just as we struck work."</p>
<p>"Strange, I have no remembrance of using it to-day. Well, I suppose I must
clamber down and fetch it, unless you happen to be going that way."</p>
<p>"I don't leave Azalea Cottage to-night," said Bill Stewart, with
decision.</p>
<p>His partner glanced at him with surprise, for it was seldom that his
good-natured companion refused to execute his small errands.</p>
<p>"Then I suppose I must go myself," he remarked, somewhat sulkily, and strode
off into the darkness.</p>
<p>The big miner, left to himself, rose and began pacing up and down the room,
chuckling softly and rubbing his broad palms together with delight. So amused
was he that he was compelled at last to lean up against the doorpost shaking
with suppressed merriment. When, however, the sound of hurrying feet announced
his companion's return he managed to resume his gravity, and reseated himself
on the chair by the fire.</p>
<p>"Bill!" cried Headley Dean, bursting into the room with a face white with
emotion. "Bill!"</p>
<p>"What now, pard?"</p>
<p>"Come down to the pit with me Bill! Never mind your hat, but come at once.
Come, come!" He tugged at his companion's coat with nervous trembling
fingers.</p>
<p>"What's up now?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask questions, but come." With feverish energy he rushed out of the
hut, half leading, half dragging his friend, and retraced his steps to the
diamond pit. The night was dark and the path was steep, but the two never
slackened their pace until they were at the brink of the claim. "Look there!"
said Headley Dean, pointing downwards with a quivering finger.</p>
<p>It was indeed a strange and impressive sight. The pit was full of
light&mdash;a vague, greenish, glimmering light, which pervaded its whole
extent without appearing to radiate from any central point. Every stick and
stone, and even the missing pipe, were visible in the dim ghostly illumination.
Had the floor and walls been strewn with phosphorus they could not have been
brighter.</p>
<p>Bill Stewart Ove a long whistle as he gazed down at this extraordinary
phenomenon. "Why, pard," said he at last, though in no very excited tones, "it
must be a carbuncle."</p>
<p>"An enormous one! A gigantic one!" said the other in a subdued whisper. "In
letting myself down into the pit I took a grip of the small bush which used to
grow on the side of the ridge. It came away in my hand, and at once the pit was
filled with that wondrous light."</p>
<p>"Think of that now! The stone must have been under the roots of the bush.
Suppose I go down and hoist you up on my back, so that you may examine the
place."</p>
<p>"I am almost afraid to," cried Dean; "what a blow if it should prove to be
anything else!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, man, what else could it be? There's nothing else in all nature
that gives a light like that except a carbuncle. Come along down, and we'll
soon pick out our little twinkler."</p>
<p>The two scrambled down into the pit, and Stewart, picking up his partner in
his herculean grip, held him up against the side of the wall. With eager
nervous fingers Dean felt all over the place where the bush had been, thrusting
his hand into every cleft and cranny. "There's no stone here," he said at last,
in a disconsolate voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, but there is, though," cried the other from below. "There must be."</p>
<p>"I have searched every square inch of it," Dean answered moodily.</p>
<p>"Well, if this doesn't lick cock-fighting! I tell you there is a stone
there. Look again."</p>
<p>"Let me down!" cried Dean, excitedly. "Don't you see what's over my head!
Let me down!"</p>
<p>"What is it now? What's over your head?"</p>
<p>"Why, my shadow! Don't you see it against the wall?"</p>
<p>"What then?" asked his slow-witted comrade.</p>
<p>"If the shadow is above, the light must be below. Why, of course it must
come from the roots of the fallen bush. What a fool I was not to think of it!
Here's the bush&mdash;yes, and here's the stone! Hurrah! hurrah!" He capered
about the bottom of the pit, holding up above his head a great blazing
scintillating crystal.</p>
<p>"It is a beauty, ain't it?" said Stewart, with his hands in his pockets. "I
never seed a finer. But there's one thing it can't do. It can't stop us from
getting cold if we stand all night in this damp hole. We can admire it a great
deal more at our ease if we march it up to the cottage."</p>
<p>This matter-of-fact advice had the effect of steadying his partner's excited
nerves. "You are right, Bill," he said. "We must get it to a place of safety."
Clambering to the surface, they made their way back to the hut, where they
proceeded to make a more minute examination of their prize.</p>
<p>It was rather larger than a pigeon's egg in size, and of a lustrous ruby
tint, save on one side where there was an opaque discolouration. Held up to the
light it proved to be beautifully transparent, save at that one point. Headley
Dean produced a delicate pair of scales from a drawer, and weighed it with the
utmost care and nicety.</p>
<p>"A hundred and fourteen carats," he said. "The largest stone that has been
found during my time. One small flaw at the side, but that can be got over in
the cutting. It is worth a small fortune in itself."</p>
<p>"Of course it is," said Big Bill gleefully. "There won't be no more tin
pannikins for us, pard."</p>
<p>Headley Dean had stowed the stone away in his innermost pocket, and was
sitting lost in thought, his heavy brows drawn down over his keen, shifting
eyes, and his clenched hand drumming against the table. His partner's chatter
fell meaningless upon his heedless ear. A dark thought had come into his mind,
and he had not cast it out. It had fastened there, and was rapidly sprouting
and growing until his whole better nature was clouded and obscured.</p>
<p>"It's too big a stone to sell in these parts," remarked Stewart. "We must
realise all we have here, and make tracks for London. That's the place for
dealers and big prices! Then you can go straight into your natural
<i>spear,</i> as I think I've heard you call it, and I'll get started on the
house. But, bless you! we won't lose sight of each other on that account. For
half the time I'll be in London a-visiting you in your natural spear, and the
other half you'll spend with me, a-walking under the oaks."</p>
<p>Still the gloom grew deeper upon his partner's face as the devil of avarice
whispered in his ear. He put his hand upon the little hard lump where the
carbuncle lay hid, and his brows grew darker and his eyes more keen.</p>
<p>"Twenty thousand," said Big Bill, "or maybe thirty thousand. What's half
that? Two's into thirty&mdash;fifteen! Yes, fifteen thousand pounds apiece. How
much is that at five per cent? Five tens's fifty, and fifteen fifties"&mdash;he
counted on his great red fingers, like an overgrown schoolboy&mdash;"seven
hundred and fifty pounds a year! How's that for a fortune? But what on earth's
the matter with you, pard? Have a drop. This bit o' excitement has been too
much for you."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Headley Dean, pushing back the bottle which his partner held
towards him. "I don't want any brandy; I want to put this matter in its right
light, though, so that we may know exactly how we stand, that there may be no
misunderstanding. I think you rather mistake our relations to one another in
the matter. Of course, you know very well that I want everything to be
honourable between us, and that I would not willingly take advantage of you in
any way."</p>
<p>"In course you wouldn't!" cried the big miner, heartily.</p>
<p>"Still, on the other hand, business is business, even between the best of
friends. If we had been at work together during working hours, and had come on
this stone, why of course it would have belonged to us both in equal shares.
But this, you see, is quite a different matter."</p>
<p>"Eh?" cried Stewart.</p>
<p>"Quite a different matter. It was an accident at a time when I was not
looking for a stone, and when you were not present. You see that, don't you?
I'm sure I only want to do what is fair. Suppose you were to pick up a purse of
gold in the drift, I could not claim half because I was your partner. It would
be a thing outside our agreement. And so is this a thing outside our agreement.
Still, of course I would not be mean about it. If I get a fair price for the
stone you shall certainly have a share. I only wish you to understand that you
have no right to claim a full half." He spoke with his face averted and his
eyes still fixed on the fire, for, clothe it as he would with sophistry, he was
too sensitive not to feel deeply the ignominy of his position.</p>
<p>His partner sat for some minutes in a silence which was far more suggestive
then any words. The ticking of the Kimberley-made clock and the crackling of
the fire appeared to be almost oppressively loud in the complete stillness. At
last Stewart spoke in a slow, measured voice, very unlike his usual cheery
tones.</p>
<p>"You don't intend that I should have half the price of the stone?" he
said.</p>
<p>"You have no right to it."</p>
<p>"Oh!" No physical pain could have wrung from the stalwart miner the groan
which was elicited by this unlooked-for treachery. Not another word passed his
lips, but, putting on his broad hat and drawing it down over his brows, he
passed away out of the hut and into the night. His heavy footsteps might be
heard scrunching their way among the shingle which lined Boxman's Drift, until
they slowly died away in the distance.</p>
<p>Headley Dean continued to sit by the fire and to brood over the incident of
the evening. What though his innermost conscience told him that he had acted
shamefully, he was still ready with some sophism, some subtle distinction
between what should and what should not be divisible between partners, to
bolster up his misdeed. If his heart failed him for a moment he had but to draw
the beautiful glowing carbuncle from his pocket to find an argument which would
silence every doubt. How could he bear to part with half of it, he who had
discovered it all! What use was a paltry income of seven hundred pounds? With
fifteen hundred some little show might be kept up. If Bill had a share of the
money he would only waste it on some tomfoolery. Still, he should of course
give him something, five hundred down, or even a thousand. No one could say
that that was not generous.</p>
<p>This was the train of thought which passed through Dean's head as he sat
waiting for his companion's return. An hour passed, and then another, but there
were no signs of the absentee. The young miner went to the door and peered out
into the darkness. All was very still save the melancholy whooping of a
veldt-owl somewhere down the kloof.</p>
<p>"What can have become of the fellow?" he muttered to himself. "He must have
turned sulky, and gone off to Winter Rush or to Peniel for the night. Well,
anyhow, I can't sit up all night, for I must be off to Kimberley by the early
coach in the morning."</p>
<p>With this reflection he threw himself down on his bunk without undressing,
with the precious carbuncle still pressed close to his heart. For an hour or
more he lay awake, listening for a footstep which never came, but at last he
sank into a troubled and uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>He woke in the morning with a strange sense of sadness and depression. The
door of the hut was half-open, and the keen fresh air of the drift was blowing
in through it, yet he felt hear and weary. He sat up for a moment with his hand
on his forehead, endeavouring to collect his thoughts. What misfortune had
occurred to him that he should feel like this? His eye fell upon the empty bunk
opposite, where the burly form of his partner was wont to lie. Ah, of course,
he remembered it all now. It was no misfortune, but a crowning piece of good
luck. Why, then, should he feel so sad at heart? He had never felt like that
when he was a poor adventurer. He drew the stone again from its place of
concealment; and again its lurid brilliance, which caught and reflected the
clear morning light, reconciled him to the dull prickings of his
conscience.</p>
<p>He had determined to set off for Kimberley by the early coach, in order that
he might submit his stone to an expert, and have a definite opinion as to its
value. Having ascertained that, his next step would be to convey it to London,
and there dispose of it. Full of his purpose, he snatched a hurried breakfast,
and started off down the drift with the precious jewel in his hand. As he
walked he held it up against the rising sun, and marvelled to see how it
shimmered and glittered and gleamed. So intent was he upon it that he did not
observe until he was close upon him that his injured partner was standing
silent and thoughtful with his arms folded across his broad chest, beside the
diamond pit.</p>
<p>"Ah, good morning, Bill," said Headley Dean, with outstretched hand; "I sat
up late waiting for you."</p>
<p>But Stewart took no notice of the proffered hand. "If any man had told
me&mdash;" he began; "but there! there's no use talking about it. Are you still
of the same mind you were in last night?"</p>
<p>"What, about the stone? Why, Bill, you know miner's law, and you know you
have no claim on the stone. Any one would tell you that. Why should you turn
rusty about it? It's a mere matter of business. Besides, you shall have a
thousand&mdash;I promise you that. I am going down to Kimberley to have it
valued."</p>
<p>"Look here, Headley Dean," said Bill Stewart, talking very slowly and
deliberately. "I've known you as an honest man for six years, and if anyone had
come to me and told me that you were no better than a thief I'd have knocked
him flat. Yes, thief is the word, though you may colour up at it. I won't
believe now that it's <i>you</i> that's dishonest. It isn't the old Headley
Dean that I knew. It's some evil spirit that has taken possession of him. I
shall protect you against it in spite of yourself, pard. You shall not do a
thing that will be a shame to you for ever. Give me the stone!"</p>
<p>"What, would you rob me by violence?" cried Dean, for his partner was
advancing upon him with a very determined expression upon his stolid face. "I
won't stand it, Stewart. Keep your hands off me!"</p>
<p>"Give me the stone!"</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"Then I shall take it;" and in a moment the big miner had seized his
companion by the hand which held the diamond. Headley Dean was a far less
muscular man, but his nervous energy and his strength of purpose enabled him to
struggle for a few moments with the giant. Then his fingers opened, the
carbuncle flew out of them, and, bounding down the slope of the valley,
vanished over the side of the unfathomable volcanic crack.</p>
<p>For an instant the two stood silent and spellbound, staring at the spot
where the stone had disappeared. Then, with a cry of rage and disappointment,
Headley Dean rushed to the head of the fissure and gazed down into the narrow
cleft. All was black and silent beneath him. Far down in those dark
inaccessible depths the great Boxman's Drift carbuncle would flicker and gleam
at the bottom of the terrible chasm until some fresh convulsion of nature would
in the course of ages bring it again within the reach of man. And he&mdash;he
had lost his stone, he had lost his honour, he had lost his friend, he had lost
his self-respect. What was there left to him? He turned sharply upon his heel,
and with his head sunk upon his breast he went back without a word to the
cottage.</p>
<p>Now that the demoralising presence of the stone had been removed he saw
clearly enough the meanness and unutterable vileness of his own conduct. He was
not by nature a. dishonest man, nor was he devoid of a code of honour from
which he had never before deviated. But his principles were not very firm, and
the sudden temptation had been too strong for him. To do him justice, his
remorse and grief at his own conduct were now so strong that they entirely
overcame his sorrow at the loss he had sustained. It was for himself he mourned
and not for the stone. There was no reparation which he would not willingly
offer to undo the past and make up for the shameful injustice which he had done
his partner. Anything to feel the grip of his hard hand once more, and to know
that he was forgiven. What were all the diamonds in Africa compared to one's
own self-respect and the friendship of such a man? He could see it clearly
enough now that it was too late. With his elbows upon his knees, and his face
buried in his hands, he racked his brain to find some method of showing his
sincere repentance and of repairing the evil that he had done.</p>
<p>A heavy footfall was heard outside the cottage, and the big miner came
lounging in.</p>
<p>Headley Dean rose and faced him with downcast eyes and trembling lip. "I
hardly know what to say to you, Bill," he said, in a low, broken voice. "I have
behaved abominably&mdash;shamefully. The stone was, as you said, like an evil
spirit, which brought all the bad that is in me to the surface. If I could
repair the past by cutting my right hand off I would do it without hesitation.
No doubt you think I am saying this just because I have lost the stone. It is
only natural you should think so. There's one thing I'll do, though, to show
that I am in earnest. We have in that tin box a thousand pounds' worth of
diamonds, which belong to us jointly. You may do what you will with my share.
You would scorn to take it yourself, no doubt, but you may give it to the
hospital at Kimberley. I at least shall never touch them."</p>
<p>Bill walked over to the fire and lit his pipe. "You say if you had the stone
you would go fair halves?" said he.</p>
<p>"If I had it you should have the disposing of it," Dean answered.</p>
<p>"I bear no malice," said Stewart. "Shake hands on it."</p>
<p>The great red hand of the big miner enclosed the nervous white one of his
partner. When they separated Headley Dean stood staring and rigid and pale to
the very lips, for there, in the centre of the palm of his outstretched hand,
lay the very stone which he had just seen disappear into the bowels of the
earth.</p>
<p>"Whoa!" cried Big Bill, supporting him into a chair. "You ain't strong
enough to bear up against this sort o' surprise. There, the colour's coming
back to your cheeks. Why, bless you! there's nothing very wonderful about it.
That chasm ain't the same depth all along. Where you measured there's no bottom
to it, but where the stone fell in it ain't more 'n forty feet deep. It was too
narrow for me or you to go down, but I got little Kaffir Jim and lowered him
down with a rope. He got it in no time. He tells me it was a-shinin' as bright
as ever, but the curve of the rock hid it from the top. So, you see, it ain't
lost yet!"</p>
<p>Headley Dean could but sit and listen and gaze at the wondrous gem. The
sudden revulsion of feeling had stupefied him.</p>
<p>"The fun of the thing," said Bill Stewart, chuckling heartily to himself,
"is that this is the third time as that 'ere stone has been discovered. I found
it three nights back, but I had often noticed, pard, what a relish and a
pleasure it was to you to find a stone, and, being myself of a kind o' coarse
and common nature, that don't feel these things so much, I made up my mind that
you should find it for yourself. I therefore put your pipe in the
pit&mdash;like you put the cheese in a mouse-trap&mdash;and I pulled the bush
out, knowing you always use it for getting up and down, and I hid the stone
amongst the roots. Thinks I, 'When pard goes down out will come the bush, and
he'll be fairly dazzled,' for I knew the thing would shine in the dark. Well,
you goes, and you finds it, and then you begins playing a game on your pard,
and we gets skylarking and the stone gets down the crevice, and Kaffir Jim
fetches it up, and here we are, all snug and comfortable. Who's game to come to
Kimberley and have it valued?"</p>
<p>"You shall do what you will with the gem," said Headley Dean, laying it upon
the table; "I have forfeited all part and share in it."</p>
<p>"All right, Boss," Stewart answered, shoving it away into his trousers
pocket, "we'll talk about that during our voyage to London. If this here stone
is not going to put you into your natural spear, why, souse it goes into the
Atlantic Ocean, and then what becomes of my house and flagstaff, etc. They all
depend on the stone of Boxman's Drift."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There is no need to say more. The gem realised even more than had been
anticipated, and the two partners are now well-to-do country gentlemen in one
of the inland shires. Big Bill has built a house which is a source of
never-failing delight to himself, and of wonder to the whole countryside.
Headley Dean lives hard by, a quiet and contented man. The two old friends are
much together, and have many a chat about their old African experiences, but it
may safely be said that they never did, and never will, allude to the one
eventful estrangement which had occurred between them.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>A PASTORAL HORROR</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>People,</i> 21 December 1890.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Far above the level of the Lake of Constance, nestling in a little corner of
the Tyrolese Alps, lies the quiet town of Feldkirch. It is remarkable for
nothing save for the presence of a large and well-conducted Jesuit school and
for the extreme beauty of its situation. There is no more lovely spot in the
whole of the Vorarlberg. From the hills which rise behind the town, the great
lake glimmers some fifteen miles off, like a broad sea of quicksilver. Down
below in the plains the Rhine and the Danube prattle along, flowing swiftly and
merrily, with none of the dignity which they assume as they grow from brooks
into rivers. Five great countries or principalities,&mdash;Switzerland,
Austria, Baden, Wurtemburg, and Bavaria&mdash;are visible from the plateau of
Feldkirch.</p>
<p>Feldkirch is the centre of a large tract of hilly and pastoral country. The
main road runs through the centre of the town, and then on as far as Anspach,
where it divides into two branches, one of which is larger than the other. This
more important one runs through the valleys across Austrian Tyrol into Tyrol
proper, going as far, I believe, as the capital of Innsbruck. The lesser road
runs for eight or ten miles amid wild and rugged glens to the village of Laden,
where it breaks up into a network of sheep-tracks. In this quiet spot, I, John
Hudson, spent nearly two years of my life, from the June of '65 to the March of
'67, and it was during that time that those events occurred which for some
weeks brought the retired hamlet into an unholy prominence, and caused its name
for the first, and probably for the last time, to be a familiar word to the
European press. The short account of these incidents which appeared in the
English papers was, however, inaccurate and misleading, besides which, the
rapid advance of the Prussians, culminating in the battle of Sadowa, attracted
public attention away from what might have moved it deeply in less troublous
times. It seems to me that the facts may be detailed now, and be new to the
great majority of readers, especially as I was myself intimately connected with
the drama, and am in a position to give many particulars which have never
before been made public.</p>
<p>And first a few words as to my own presence in this out of the way spot.
When the great city firm of Sprynge, Wilkinson, and Spragge failed, and paid
their creditors rather less than eighteen-pence in the pound, a number of
humble individuals were ruined, including myself. There was, however, some
legal objection which held out a chance of my being made an exception to the
other creditors, and being paid in full. While the case was being brought out I
was left with a very small sum for my subsistance.</p>
<p>I determined, therefore, to take up my residence abroad in the interim,
since I could live more economically there, and be spared the mortification of
meeting those who had known me in my more prosperous days. A friend of mine had
described Laden to me some years before as being the most isolated place which
he had ever come across in all his experience, and as isolation and cheap
living are usually synonymous, I bethought use of his words. Besides, I was in
a cynical humour with my fellow-man, and desired to see as little of him as
possible for some time to come. Obeying, then, the guidances of poverty and of
misanthropy, I made my way to Laden, where my arrival created the utmost
excitement among the simple inhabitants. The manners and customs of the
red-bearded Englander, his long walks, his check suit, and the reasons which
had led him to abandon his fatherland, were all fruitful sources of gossip to
the topers who frequented the Gruner Mann and the Schwartzer Bar&mdash;the two
alehouses of the village.</p>
<p>I found myself very happy at Laden. The surroundings were magnificent, and
twenty years of Brixton had sharpened my admiration for nature as an olive
improves the flavour of wine. In my youth I had been a fair German scholar, and
I found myself able, before I had been many months abroad, to converse even on
scientific and abstruse subjects with the new cur&eacute; of the parish.</p>
<p>This priest was a great godsend to me, for he was a most learned man and a
brilliant conversationalist. Father Verhagen&mdash;for that was his
name&mdash;though little more than forty years of age, had made his reputation
as an author by a brilliant monograph upon the early Popes&mdash;a work which
eminent critics have compared favourably with Von Ranke's. I shrewdly suspect
that it was owing to some rather unorthodox views advanced in this book that
Verhagen was relegated to the obscurity of Laden. His opinions upon every
subject were ultra-Liberal, and in his fiery youth he had been ready to
vindicate them, as was proved by a deep scar across his chin, received from a
dragoon's sabre in the abortive insurrection at Berlin. Altogether the man was
an interesting one, and though he was by nature somewhat cold and reserved, we
soon established an acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of morality in Laden was a very rarefied one. The position of
Intendant Wurms and his satellites had for many years been a sinecure.
Non-attendance at church upon a Sunday or feast-day was about the deepest and
darkest crime which the most advanced of the villagers had attained to.
Occasionally some hulking Fritz or Andreas would come lurching home at ten
o'clock at night, slightly under the influence of Bavarian beer, and might even
abuse the wife of his bosom if she ventured to remonstrate, but such cases were
rare, and when they occurred the Ladeners looked at the culprit for some time
in a half admiring, half horrified manner, as one who had committed a gaudy sin
and so asserted his individuality.</p>
<p>It was in this peaceful village that a series of crimes suddenly broke out
which astonished all Europe, and for atrocity and for the mystery which
surrounded them surpassed anything of which I have ever heard or read. I shall
endeavour to give a succinct account of these events in the order of their
sequence, in which I am much helped by the fact that it has been my custom all
my life to keep a journal&mdash;to the pages of which I now refer.</p>
<p>It was, then, I find upon the 19th of May in the spring of 1866, that my old
landlady, Frau Zimmer, rushed wildly into the room as I was sipping my morning
cup of chocolate and informed me that a murder had been committed in the
village. At first I could hardly believe the news, but as she persisted in her
statement, and was evidently terribly frightened, I put on my hat and went out
to find the truth. When I came into the main street of the village I saw
several men hurrying along in front of me, and following them I came upon an
excited group in front of the little stadthaus or town hall&mdash;a barn-like
edifice which was used for all manner of public gatherings. They were collected
round the body of one Maul, who had formerly been a steward upon one of the
steamers running between Lindau and Fredericshaven, on the Lake of Constance.
He was a harmless, inoffensive little man, generally popular in the village,
and, as far as was known, without an enemy in the world. Maul lay upon his
face, with his fingers dug into the earth, no doubt in his last convulsive
struggles, and his hair all matted together with blood, which had streamed down
over the collar of his coat. The body had been discovered nearly two hours, but
no one appeared to know what to do or whither to convey it. My arrival,
however, together with that of the cur&eacute;, who came almost simultaneously,
infused some vigour into the crowd. Under our direction the corpse was carried
up the steps, and laid on the floor of the town hall, where, having made sure
that life was extinct, we proceeded to examine the injuries, in conjunction
with Lieutenant Wurms, of the police. Maul's face was perfectly placid, showing
that he had had no thought of danger until the fatal blow was struck. His watch
and purse had not been taken. Upon washing the clotted blood from the back of
his head a singular triangular wound was found, which had smashed the bone and
penetrated deeply into the brain. It had evidently been inflicted by a heavy
blow from a sharp-pointed pyramidal instrument. I believe that it was Father
Verhagen, the cur&eacute;, who suggested the probability of the weapon in
question having been a short mattock or small pickaxe, such as are to be found
in every Alpine cottage. The Intendant, with praiseworthy promptness, at once
obtained one and striking a turnip, produced just such a curious gap as was to
be seen in poor Maul's head. We felt that we had come upon the first link of a
chain which might guide us to the assassin. It was not long before we seemed to
grasp the whole clue.</p>
<p>A sort of inquest was held upon the body that same afternoon, at which
Pfiffor, the maire, presided, the cur&eacute;, the Intendant, Freckler, of the
post office, and myself forming ourselves into a sort of committee of
investigation. Any villager who could throw a light upon the case or give an
account of the movements of the murdered man upon the previous evening was
invited to attend. There was a fair muster of witnesses, and we soon gathered a
connected series of facts. At half-past eight o'clock Maul had entered the
Gruner Mann public-house, and had called for a flagon of beer. At that time
there were sitting in the tap-room Waghorn, the butcher of the village, and an
Italian pedlar named Cellini, who used to come three times a year to Laden with
cheap jewellery and other wares. Immediately after his entrance the landlord
had seated himself with his customers, and the four had spent the evening
together, the common villagers not being admitted beyond the bar. It seemed
from the evidence of the landlord and of Waghorn, both of whom were most
respectable and trustworthy men, that shortly after nine o'clock a dispute
arose between the deceased and the pedlar. Hot words had been exchanged, and
the Italian had eventually left the room, saying that he would not stay any
longer to hear his country decried. Maul remained for nearly an hour, and being
somewhat elated at having caused his adversary's retreat, he drank rather more
than was usual with him. One witness had met him walking towards his home,
about ten o'clock, and deposed to his having been slightly the worse for drink.
Another had met him just a minute or so before he reached the spot in front of
the stadthaus where the deed was done. This man's evidence was most important.
He swore confidently that while passing the town hall, and before meeting Maul,
he had seen a figure standing in the shadow of the building, adding that the
person appeared to him, as far as he could make him out, to be not unlike the
Italian.</p>
<p>Up to this point we had then established two facts&mdash;that the Italian
had left the Gruner Mann before Maul, with words of anger on his lips; the
second, that some unknown individual had been seen lying in wait on the road
which the ex-steward would have to traverse. A third, and most important, was
reached when the woman with whom the Italian lodged deposed that he had not
returned the night before until half-past ten, an unusually late hour for
Laden. How had he employed the time, then, from shortly after nine, when he
left the public-house, until half-past ten, when he returned to his rooms?
Things were beginning to look very black, indeed, against the pedlar.</p>
<p>It could not be denied, however, that there were points in the man's favour,
and that the case against him consisted entirely of circumstantial evidence. In
the first place, there was no sign of a mattock or any other instrument which
could have been used for such a purpose among the Italian's goods; nor was it
easy to understand how he could come by any such a weapon, since he did not go
home between the time of the quarrel and his final return. Again, as the
cur&eacute; pointed out, since Cellini was a comparative stranger in the
village, it was very unlikely that he would know which road Maul would take in
order to reach his home. This objection was weakened, however, by the evidence
of the dead man's servant, who deposed that the pedlar had been hawking his
wares in front of their house the day before, and might very possibly have seen
the owner at one of the windows. As to the prisoner himself, his attitude at
first had been one of defiance, and even of amusement; but when he began to
realise the weight of evidence against him, his manner became cringing, and he
wrung his hands hideously, loudly proclaiming his innocence. His defence was
that after leaving the inn, he had taken a long walk down the Anspach-road in
order to cool down his excitement, and that this was the cause of his late
return. As to the murder of Maul, he knew no more about it than the babe
unborn.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at some length upon the circumstances of this case, because
there are events in connection with it which makes it peculiarly interesting. I
intend now to fall back upon my diary, which was very fully kept during this
period, and indeed during my whole residence abroad. It will save me trouble to
quote from it, and it will be a teacher for the accuracy of facts.</p>
<p>May 20th.&mdash;Nothing thought of and nothing talked of but the recent
tragedy. A hunt has been made among the woods and along the brook in the hope
of finding the weapon of the assassin. The more I think of it, the more
convinced I am that Cellini is the man. The fact of the money being untouched
proves that the crime was committed from motives of revenge, and who would bear
more spite towards poor innocent Maul except the vindictive hot-blooded Italian
whom he had just offended. I dined with Pfiffor in the evening, and he entirely
agreed with me in my view of the case.</p>
<p>May 21st.&mdash;Still no word as far as I can hear which throws any light
upon the murder. Poor Maul was buried at twelve o'clock in the neat little
village churchyard. The cur&eacute; led the service with great feeling, and his
audience, consisting of the whole population of the village, were much moved,
interrupting him frequently by sobs and ejaculations of grief. After the
painful ceremony was over I had a short walk with our good priest. His
naturally excitable nature has been considerably stirred by recent events. His
hand trembles and his face is pale.</p>
<p>"My friend," said he, taking me by the hand as we walked together, "you know
something of medicine." (I had been two years at Guy's). "I have been far from
well of late."</p>
<p>"It is this sad affair which has upset you," I said.</p>
<p>"No," he answered, "I have felt it coming on for some time, but it has been
worse of late. I have a pain which shoots from here to there," he put his hand
to his temples. "If I were struck by lightning, the sudden shock it causes me
could not be more great. At times when I close my eyes flashes of light dart
before them, and my ears are for ever ringing. Often I know not what I do. My
fear is lest I faint some time when performing the holy offices."</p>
<p>"You are overworking yourself," I said, "you must have rest and
strengthening tonics. Are you writing just now? And how much do you do each
day?"</p>
<p>"Eight hours," he answered. "Sometimes ten, sometimes even twelve, when the
pains in my head do not interrupt me."</p>
<p>"You must reduce it to four," I said authoritatively. "You must also take
regular exercise. I shall send you some quinine which I have in my trunk, and
you can take as much as would cover a gulden in a glass of milk every morning
and night."</p>
<p>He departed, vowing that he would follow my directions.</p>
<p>I hear from the maire that four policemen are to be sent from Anspach to
remove Cellini to a safer gaol.</p>
<p>May 22nd.&mdash;To say that I was startled would give but a faint idea of my
mental state. I am confounded, amazed, horrified beyond all expression. Another
and a more dreadful crime has been committed during the night. Freckler has
been found dead in his house&mdash;the very Freckler who had sat with me on the
committee of investigation the day before. I write these notes after a long and
anxious day's work, during which I have been endeavouring to assist the
officers of the law. The villagers are so paralysed with fear at this fresh
evidence of an assassin in their midst that there would be a general panic but
for our exertions. It appears that Freckler, who was a man of peculiar habits,
lived alone in an isolated dwelling. Some curiosity was aroused this morning by
the fact that he had not gone to his work, and that there was no sign of
movement about the house. A crowd assembled, and the doors were eventually
forced open. The unfortunate Freckler was found in the bed-room upstairs, lying
with his head in the fireplace. He had met his death by an exactly similar
wound to that which had proved fatal to Maul, save that in this instance the
injury was in front. His hands were clenched, and there was an indescribable
look of horror, and, as it seemed to me, of surprise upon his features. There
were marks of muddy footsteps upon the stairs, which must have been caused by
the murderer in his ascent, as his victim had put on his slippers before
retiring to his bed-room. These prints, however, were too much blurred to
enable us to get a trustworthy outline of the foot. They were only to be found
upon every third step, showing with what fiendish swiftness this human tiger
had rushed upstairs in search of his victim. There was a considerable sum of
money in the house, but not one farthing had been touched, nor had any of the
drawers in the bed-room been opened.</p>
<p>As the dismal news became known the whole population of the village
assembled in a great crowd in front of the house&mdash;rather, I think, from
the gregariousness of terror than from mere curiosity. Every man looked with
suspicion upon his neighbour. Most were silent, and when they spoke it was in
whispers, as if they feared to raise their voices. None of these people were
allowed to enter the house, and we, the more enlightened members of the
community, made a strict examination of the premises. There was absolutely
nothing, however, to give the slightest clue as to the assassin. Beyond the
fact that he must be an active man, judging from the manner in which he
ascended the stairs, we have gained nothing from this second tragedy. Intendant
Wurms pointed out, indeed, that the dead man's rigid right arm was stretched
out as if in greeting, and that, therefore, it was probable that this late
visitor was someone with whom Freckler was well acquainted. This, however, was,
to a large extent, conjecture. If anything could have added to the horror
created by the dreadful occurrence, it was the fact that the crime must have
been committed at the early hour of half-past eight in the evening&mdash;that
being the time registered by a small cuckoo clock, which had been carried away
by Freckler in his fall.</p>
<p>No one, apparently, heard any suspicious sounds or saw any one enter or
leave the house. It was done rapidly, quietly, and completely, though many
people must have been about at the time. Poor Pfiffor and our good cur&eacute;
are terribly cut up by the awful occurrence, and, indeed, I feel very much
depressed myself now that all the excitement is over and the reaction set in.
There are very few of the villagers about this evening, but from every side is
heard the sound of hammering&mdash;the peasants fitting bolts and bars upon the
doors and windows of their houses. Very many of them have been entirely
unprovided with anything of the sort, nor were they ever required until now.
Frau Zimmer has manufactured a huge fastening which would be ludicrous if we
were in a humour for laughter.</p>
<p>I hear to-night that Cellini has been released, as, of course, there is no
possible pretext for detaining him now; also that word has been sent to all the
villages near for any police that can be spared.</p>
<p>My nerves have been so shaken that I remained awake the greater part of the
night, reading Gordon's translation of Tacitus by candlelight. I have got out
my navy revolver and cleaned it, so as to be ready for all eventualities.</p>
<p>Mary 23rd.&mdash;The police force has been recruited by three more men from
Anspach and two from Thalstadt at the other side of the hills. Intendant Wurms
has established an efficient system of patrols, so that we may consider
ourselves reasonably safe. To-day has cast no light upon the murders. The
general opinion in the village seems to be that they have been done by some
stranger who lies concealed among the woods. They argue that they have all
known each other since childhood, and that there is no one of their number who
would be capable of such actions. Some of the more daring of them have made a
hunt among the pine forests to-day, but without success.</p>
<p>May 24th.&mdash;Events crowd on apace. We seem hardly to have recovered from
one horror when something else occurs to excite the popular imagination.
Fortunately, this time it is not a fresh tragedy, although the news is serious
enough.</p>
<p>The murderer has been seen, and that upon the public road, which proves that
his thirst for blood has not been quenched yet, and also that our
reinforcements of police are not enough to guarantee security. I have just come
back from hearing Andreas Murch narrate his experience, though he is still in
such a state of trepidation that his story is somewhat incoherent. He was
belated among the hills, it seems, owing to mist. It was nearly eleven o'clock
before he struck the main road about a couple of miles from the village. He
confesses that he felt by no means comfortable at finding himself out so late
after the recent occurrences. However, as the fog had cleared away and the moon
was shining brightly, he trudged sturdily along. Just about a quarter of a mile
from the village the road takes a very sharp bend. Andreas had got as far as
this when he suddenly heard in the still night the sound of footsteps
approaching rapidly round this curve. Overcome with fear, he threw himself into
the ditch which skirts the road, and lay there motionless in the shadow,
peering over the side. The steps came nearer and nearer, and than a tall dark
figure came round the corner at a swinging pace, and passing the spot where the
moon glimmered upon the white face of the frightened peasant, halted in the
road about twenty yards further on, and began probing about among the reeds on
the roadside with an instrument which Andreas Murch recognised with horror as
being a long mattock. After searching about in this way for a minute or so, as
if he suspected that someone was concealed there, for he must have heard the
sound of the footsteps, he stood still leaning upon his weapon. Murch describes
him as a tall, thin man, dressed in clothes of a darkish colour. The lower part
of his face was swathed in a wrapper of some sort, and the little which was
visible appeared to be of a ghastly pallor. Murch could not see enough of his
features to identify him, but thinks that it was no one whom he had ever seen
in his life before. After standing for some little time, the man with the
mattock had walked swiftly away into the darkness, in the direction in which he
imagined the fugitive had gone. Andreas, as may be supposed, lost little time
in getting safely into the village, where he alarmed the police. Three of them,
armed with carbines, started down the road, but saw no signs of the miscreant.
There is, of course, a possibility that Murch's story is exaggerated and that
his imagination has been sharpened by fear. Still, the whole incident cannot be
trumped up, and this awful demon who haunts us is evidently still active.</p>
<p>There is an ill-conditioned fellow named Hiedler, who lives in a hut on the
side of the Spiegelberg, and supports himself by chamois hunting and by acting
as guide to the few tourists who find their way here. Popular suspicion has
fastened on this man, for no better reason than that he is tall, thin, and
known to be rough and brutal. His chalet has been searched to-day, but nothing
of importance found. He has, however, been arrested and confined in the same
room which Cellini used to occupy.<br>
<br></p>
<p>At this point there is a gap of a week in my diary, during which time there
was an entire cessation of the constant alarms which have harassed us lately.
Some explained it by supposing that the terrible unknown had moved on to some
fresh and less guarded scene of operations. Others imagine that we have secured
the right man in the shape of the vagabond Hiedler. Be the cause what it may,
peace and contentment reign once more in the village, and a short seven days
have sufficed to clear away the cloud of care from men's brows, though the
police are still on the alert. The season for rifle shooting is beginning, and
as Laden has, like every other Tyrolese village, butts of its own, there is a
continual pop, pop, all day. These peasants are dead shots up to about four
hundred yards. No troops in the world could subdue them among their native
mountains.</p>
<p>My friend Verhagen, the cur&eacute;, and Pfiffor, the maire, used to go down
in the afternoon to see the shooting with me. The former says that the quinine
has done him much good and that his appetite is improved. We all agree that it
is good policy to encourage the amusements of the people so that they may
forget all about this wretched business. Vaghorn, the butcher, won the prize
offered by the maire. He made five bulls, and what we should call a magpie out
of six shots at 100 yards. This is English prize-medal form.</p>
<p>June 2nd.&mdash;Who could have imagined that a day which opened so fairly
could have so dark an ending? The early carrier brought me a letter by which I
learned that Spragge and Co. have agreed to pay my claim in full, although it
may be some months before the money is forthcoming. This will make a difference
of nearly &pound;400 a year to me&mdash;a matter of moment when a man is in his
seven-and-fortieth year.</p>
<p>And now for the grand events of the hour. My interview with the vampire who
haunts us, and his attempt upon Frau Bischoff, the landlady of the Gruner
Mann&mdash;to say nothing of the narrow escape of our good cure. There seems to
be something almost supernatural in the malignity of this unknown fiend, and
the impunity with which he continues his murderous course. The real reason of
it lies in the badly lit state of the place&mdash;or rather the entire absence
of light&mdash;and also in the fact that thick woods stretch right down to the
houses on every side, so that escape is made easy. In spite of this, however,
he had two very narrow escapes to-night&mdash;one from my pistol, and one from
the officers of the law. I shall not sleep much, so I may spend half an hour in
jotting down these strange doings in my dairy. I am no coward, but life in
Laden is becoming too much for my nerves. I believe the matter will end in the
emigration of the whole population.</p>
<p>To come to my story, then. I felt lonely and depressed this evening, in
spite of the good news of the morning. About nine o'clock, just as night began
to fall, I determined to stroll over and call upon the cur&eacute;, thinking
that a little intellectual chat might cheer me up. I slipped my revolver into
my pocket, therefore&mdash;a precaution which I never neglected&mdash;and went
out, very much against the advice of good Frau Zimmer. I think I mentioned some
months ago in my diary that the cur&eacute;'s house is some little way out of
the village upon the brow of a small hill. When I arrived there I found that he
had gone out&mdash;which, indeed, I might have anticipated, for he had
complained lately of restlessness at night, and I had recommended him to take a
little exercise in the evening. His housekeeper made me very welcome, however,
and having lit the lamp, left me in the study with some books to amuse me until
her master's return.</p>
<p>I suppose I must have sat for nearly half an hour glancing over an odd
volume of Klopstock's poems, when some sudden instinct caused me to raise my
head and look up. I have been in some strange situations in my life, but never
have I felt anything to be compared to the thrill which shot through me at that
moment. The recollection of it now, hours after the event, makes me shudder.
There, framed in one of the panes of the window, was a human face glaring in,
from the darkness, into the lighted room&mdash;the face of a man so concealed
by a cravat and slouch hat that the only impression I retain of it was a pair
of wild-beast eyes and a nose which was whitened by being pressed against the
glass. It did not need Andreas Murch's description to tell me that at last I
was face to face with the man with the mattock. There was murder in those wild
eyes. For a second I was so unstrung as to be powerless; the next I cocked my
revolver and fired straight at the sinister face. I was a moment too late. As I
pressed the trigger I saw it vanish, but the pane through which it had looked
was shattered to pieces. I rushed to the window, and then out through the front
door, but everything was silent. There was no trace of my visitor. His
intention, no doubt, was to attack the cur&eacute;, for there was nothing to
prevent his coming through the folding window had he not found an armed man
inside.</p>
<p>As I stood in the cool night air with the cur&eacute;'s frightened
housekeeper beside me, I suddenly heard a great hubbub down in the village. By
this time, alas! such sounds were so common in Laden that there was no doubting
what it forboded. Some fresh misfortune had occurred there. To-night seemed
destined to be a night of horror. My presence might be of use in the village,
so I set off there, taking with me the trembling woman, who positively refused
to remain behind. There was a crowd round the Gruner Mann public-house, and a
dozen excited voices were explaining the circumstances to the cur&eacute;, who
had arrived just before us. It was as I had thought, though happily without the
result which I had feared. Frau Bischoff, the wife of the proprietor of the
inn, had, it seems, gone some twenty minutes before a few yards from her door
to draw some water, and had been at once attacked by a tall disguised man, who
had cut at her with some weapon. Fortunately he had slipped, so that she was
able to seize him by the wrist and prevent his repeating his attempt, while she
screamed for help. There were several people about at the time, who came
running towards them, on which the stranger wrested himself free, and dashed
off into the woods, with two of our police after him. There is little hope of
their overtaking or tracing him, however, in such a dark labyrinth. Frau
Bischoff had made a bold attempt to hold the assassin, and declares that her
nails made deep furrows in his right wrist. This, however, must be mere
conjecture, as there was very little light at the time. She knows no more of
the man's features than I do. Fortunately she. is entirely unhurt. The
cur&eacute; was horrified when I informed him of the incident at his own house.
He was returning from his walk, it appears, when hearing cries in the village,
he had hurried down to it. I have not told anyone else of my own adventure, for
the people are quite excited enough already.</p>
<p>As I said before, unless this mysterious and bloodthirsty villain is
captured, the place will become deserted. Flesh and blood cannot stand such a
strain. He is either some murderous misanthrope who has declared a vendetta
against the whole human race, or else he is an escaped maniac. Clearly after
the unsuccessful attempt upon Frau Bischoff he had made at once for the cures
house, bent upon slaking his thirst for blood, and thinking that its lonely
situation gave hope of success. I wish I had fired at him through the pocket of
my coat. The moment he saw the glitter of the weapon he was off.</p>
<p>June 3rd.&mdash;Everybody in the village this morning has learned about the
attempt upon the cur&eacute; last night. There was quite a crowd at his house
to congratulate him on his escape, and when I appeared they raised a cheer and
hailed me as the "tapferer Englander." It seems that his narrow shave must have
given the ruffian a great start, for a thick woollen muffler was found lying on
the pathway leading down to the village, and later in the day the fatal mattock
was discovered close to the same place. The scoundrel evidently threw those
things down and then took to his heels. It is possible that he may prove to
have been frightened away from the neighbourhood altogether. Let us trust
so!</p>
<p>June 4th.&mdash;A quiet day, which is as remarkable a thing in our annals as
an exciting one elsewhere. Wurms has made strict inquiry, but cannot trace the
muffler and mattock to any inhabitant. A description of them has been printed,
and copies sent to Anspach and neighbouring villages for circulation among the
peasants, who may be able to throw some light upon the matter. A thanksgiving
service is to be held in the church on Sunday for the double escape of the
pastor and of Martha Bischoff. Pfiffer tells me that Herr von Weissendorff, one
of the most energetic detectives in Vienna, is on his way to Laden. I see, too,
by the English papers sent me, that people at home are interested in the
tragedies here, although the accounts which have reached them are garbled and
untrustworthy.</p>
<p>How well I can recall the Sunday morning following upon the events which I
have described, such a morning as it is hard to find outside the Tyrol! The sky
was blue and cloudless, the gentle breeze wafted the balsamic odour of the pine
woods through the open windows, and away up on the hills the distant tinkling
of the cow bells fell pleasantly upon the ear, until the musical rise and fall
which summoned the villagers to prayer drowned their feebler melody. It was
hard to believe, looking down that peaceful little street with its quaint
topheavy wooden houses and old-fashioned church, that a cloud of crime hung
over it which had horrified Europe. I sat at my window watching the peasants
passing with their picturesquely dressed wives and daughters on their way to
church. With the kindly reverence of Catholic countries, I saw them cross
themselves as they went by the house of Freckler and the spot where Maul had
met his fate. When the bell had ceased to toll and the whole population had
assembled in the church, I walked up there also, for it has always been my
custom to join in the religious exercises of any people among whom I may find
myself.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the church I found that the service had already begun. I
took my place in the gallery which contained the village organ, from which I
had a good view of the congregation. In the front seat of all was stationed
Frau Bischoff, whose miraculous escape the service was intended to celebrate,
and beside her on one side was her worthy spouse, while the maire occupied the
other. There was a hush through the church as the cur&eacute; turned from the
altar and ascended the pulpit. I have seldom heard a more magnificent sermon.
Father Verhagen was always an eloquent preacher, but on that occasion he
surpassed himself. He chose for his text:&mdash;"In the midst of life we are in
death," and impressed so vividly upon our minds the thin veil which divides us
from eternity, and how unexpectedly it may be rent, that he held his audience
spell-bound and horrified. He spoke next with tender pathos of the friends who
had been snatched so suddenly and so dreadfully from among us, until his words
were almost drowned by the sobs of the women, and, suddenly turning he compared
their peaceful existence in a happier land to the dark fate of the
gloomy-minded criminal, steeped in blood and with nothing to hope for either in
this world or the next&mdash;a man solitary among his fellows, with no woman to
love him, no child to prattle at his knee, and an endless torture in his own
thoughts. So skilfully and so powerfully did he speak that as he finished I am
sure that pity for this merciless demon was the prevailing emotion in every
heart.</p>
<p>The service was over, and the priest, with his two acolytes before him, was
leaving the altar, when he turned, as was his custom, to give his blessing to
the congregation. I shall never forget his appearance. The summer sunshine
shining slantwise through the single small stained glass window which adorned
the little church threw a yellow lustre upon his sharp intellectual features
with their dark haggard lines, while a vivid crimson spot reflected from a
ruby-coloured mantle in the window quivered over his uplifted right hand. There
was a hush as the villagers bent their heads to receive their pastor's
blessing&mdash;a hush broken by a wild exclamation of surprise from a woman who
staggered to her feet in the front pew and gesticulated frantically as she
pointed at Father Verhagen's uplifted arm. No need for Frau Bischoff to explain
the cause of that sudden cry, for there&mdash;there in full sight of his
parishioners, were lines of livid scars upon the cure's white wrist&mdash;scars
which could be left by nothing on earth but a desperate woman's nails. And what
woman save her who had clung so fiercely to the murderer two days before!<br>
<br></p>
<p>That in all this terrible business poor Verhagen was the man most to be
pitied I have no manner of doubt. In a town in which there was good medical
advice to be had, the approach of the homicidal mania, which had undoubtedly
proceeded from overwork and brain worry, and which assumed such a terrible
form, would have been detected in time and he would have been spared the awful
compunction with which he must have been seized in the lucid intervals between
his fits&mdash;if, indeed, he had any lucid intervals. How could I diagnose
with my smattering of science the existence of such a terrible and insidious
form of insanity, especially from the vague symptoms of which he informed me.
It is easy now, looking back, to think of many little circumstances which might
have put us on the right scent; but what a simple thing is retrospective
wisdom! I should be sad indeed if I thought that I had anything with which to
reproach myself.</p>
<p>We were never able to discover where he had obtained the weapon with which
he had committed his crimes, nor how he managed to secrete it in the interval.
My experience proved that it had been his custom to go and come through his
study window without disturbing his housekeeper. On the occasion of the attempt
on Frau Bischoff he had made a dash for home, and then, finding to his
astonishment that his room was occupied, his only resource was to fling away
his weapon and muffler, and to mix with the crowd in the village. Being both a
strong and an active man, with a good knowledge of the footpaths through the
woods, he had never found any difficulty in escaping all observation.</p>
<p>Immediately after his apprehension, Verhagen's disease took an acute form,
and he was carried off to the lunatic asylum at Feldkirch. I have heard that
some months afterwards he made a determined attempt upon the life of one of his
keepers, and afterwards committed suicide. I cannot be positive of this,
however, for I heard it quite accidentally during a conversation in a railway
carriage.</p>
<p>As for myself, I left Laden within a few months, having received a pleasing
intimation from my solicitors that my claim had been paid in full. In spite of
my tragic experience there, I had many a pleasing recollection of the little
Tyrolese village, and in two subsequent visits I renewed my acquaintance with
the maire, the Intendant, and all my old friends, on which occasion, over long
pipes and flagons of beer, we have taken a grim pleasure in talking with bated
breath of that terrible month in the quiet Vorarlberg hamlet.</p>

<hr>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>On the western side of the island of Arran. seldom visited, und almost
unknown to tourists is the little island named Uffa. Between the two lies a
strait, or roost, two miles and a half broad, with a dangerous current which
sets in from the north. Even on the calmest day there are ripples and swirls
and dimples on the surface of the roost, which suggest hidden influences, but
when the wind blows from the west and the great Atlantic waves choke up the
inlet and meet their brethren which have raced round the other side of the
island, there is such seething und turmoil that old sailors say they have never
seen the like. God help the boat that is caught there on such a day!</p>
<p>My father owned one-third part of the island of Uffa, and I was born and
bred there. Our farm, or croft, was a small one enough, for if a good thrower
were to pick up a stone on the shore at Carracuil (which was our place) he
could manage, in three shies, to clear all our arable land, and it was hardly
longer than it was broad. Behind this narrow track, on which we grew corn and
potatoes. was the homesteading of Carracuil&mdash;a rather bleak-looking
graystone house with a red-tiled byre buttressed against one side of it, and
behind this again the barren undulating moorland stretched away up to Beg-na-
sacher and Beg-na-phail, two rugged knowes which marked the centre of the
island. We had grazing ground for a couple of cows and eight or ten sheep, and
we had our boat anchored down in Carravoe. When the fishing failed there was
more time to devote to the crops, and if the season was bad. as likely as not
the herring would be thick on the coast. Taking one thing with another, a
crofter in Uffa had as much chance of laying by a penny or two as most men on
the mainland.</p>
<p>Besides our own family, the McDonalds of Carracuil, there were two others on
the island. These were the Gibbs of Arden and the Fullartons of Corriemains.
There was no priority claimed among us, for none had any legend of the coming
of the others We had ali three held our farms by direct descent for rnany
generations, paying rent to the Duke of Hamilton, and all prospering in a
moderate way. My father had been enabled to send me to begin the study of
medicine at the University of Glasgow, and I had attended lectures there for
two Winter sessions, but, whether from caprice or from some lessening in his
funds. he had recalled me, and in the year 1865 I found myself cribbed up in
this little island with just education enough to wish for more, and with no
associate at home but the grim, stern old man, for my mother had been dead some
years, and I had neither brother nor sister.</p>
<p>There were two youths about my own age in the island, Geordie and Jock
Gibbs, but they were rough, loutiish fellows, good-hearted enough, but with no
ideas above fishing and farming. More to my taste was the society of Minnie
Fullarton, the pretty daughter of old Fullarton of Corriemains. We had been
children together, and it was natural that when she blossomed into a buxom,
fresh-faced girl, and I into a square-shouldered, long-legged youth, there
should be something warmer than friendship between us. Her elder brother was a
corn chandler in Ardrossan, and was said to be doing welL so that the match was
an eligible one, but for some reason my father objected very strongly to our
intimacy and even forbade me entirely to meet her. I laughed at his commands,
for I was a hot-headed, irreverent youngster. and continued to see Minnie, but
when it came to his ears it caused many violent scenes between us, which nearly
went the length of blows. We had a quarrel of this sort just before the
equinoctial gales in the Spring of the year in which my story begins, and I
left the old man with his face hushed and his great bony hands shaking with
passion, while I went jauntily off to our usual trysting place. I have often
regretted since that I was not more submissive, but how was I to guess the dark
things which were to come upon us?</p>
<p>I can remember that day well. Many bit-ter thoughts rose in my heart as I
strode along the narrow pathway, cutting savagely at the thistles on either
side with my stick. One side of our little estate was bordered by the Combera
cliiffs, which rose straight out of the water to the height of a couple of
hundred feet. The top of these cliffs was covered with greensward and commanded
a noble view on every side. I stretched myself on the turf there and watched
the breakers dancing over the Winner sands and listened to the gurgling of the
water down beneath me in the caves of the Combera. We faced the western side of
the island, and from where I lay I could see the whole stretch of the Irish
Sea, right across to where a long hazy line upon the horizon marked the
northern coast of the sister isle. The wind was blowing freshly from the
northwest, and the great Atlantic rollers were racing rnerrily in, one behind
another. dark brown below, light green above. and breaking with a sullen roar
at the base of the cliffs. Now and again a sluggish one would be overtaken by
its successor, and the two would come crashing in together and send the spray
right over me as I lay. The whole air was prickly with the smack of the sea.
Away to the north there was a piling up of clouds, and the peak of Goatfell in
Arran looked lurid and distinct. There were no craft in the oiiing except one
little eager, panting steamer making for the shelter of the Clyde, and a trim
brigantine tacking along the coast. I was speculating as to her destination
when I heard a light, springy footstep, and Minnie Fullarton was standing
beside me, her face rosy with exercise and her brown hair floating behind
her.</p>
<p>"Wha's been vexing you, Archie?" she asked with the quick intuition of
womanhood. "The auld man has been spealing aboot me again; has no'?"</p>
<p>It was strange how pretty and mellow the accents were in her mouth which
came so raspingly from my father. We sat down on a little green hillock
together, her hand in mine, while I told her of our quarrel in the morning.</p>
<p>"You see, they're bent on parting us," I said; "but, indeed, they"ll find
they have the wrong man to deal with if they try to frighten me away from
you."</p>
<p>"I'm no' worth it, Archiie," she answered, slghing. "I'm ower hamely and
simple for one like you that speaks well and is a scholar forbye."</p>
<p>"You're too good and true for any one, Minne," I answered, though in my
heart I thought there was some truth in what she said.</p>
<p>"I'Il no' trouble any one lang," she continued, looking earnestly into my
face. " I got my call last nicht; I saw a ghaist, Archie."</p>
<p>"Saw a ghost!" I ejaculated.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I doubt it was a call for me. When my cousin Steevie deed he saw
one the same way."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it, dear," I said, impressed by her solemnity.</p>
<p>"There's no much to tell: It was last nicht aboot twelve, or maybe one
o'clock. I was lying awake thinking o' this and that wi' my een fixed on the
window. Suddenly I saw a face looking in at me through the glass&mdash;an
awfu'-like face, Archie. lt was na the face of any one on the island. I canna
tell what it was like&mdash;it was just awfu'. lt was there may be a minute
looking tae way and tither into the room. I could see the glint o' his very een
&mdash;for it was a man's face&mdash;and his nose was white where it was
pressed against the glass. My very blood ran cauld and I couldna scream for
fright. The it went awa' as quickly and as sudden as it came."</p>
<p>"Who could it have been?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"A wraith or a bogle," said Minnie, positively.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it wasn't Tammy Gibbs?" I suggested.</p>
<p>"Na, na, it wasna Tammy. It was a dark, hard, dour sort of face."</p>
<p>"Well," I said, laughing, "I hope the fellow will give me a look up, whoever
he is. l'll soon learn who he is and where he comes from. But we won't talk of
it, or you'll be frightening yourself to-night again. It'll be a dreary night
as it is."</p>
<p>"A bad nicht for the puir sailors," she answered, sadly, glancing at the
dark wrack hurrying up from the northward, and at the white line of breakers on
the Winner sands. "I wonder what yon brig is after? Unless it gets roond to
Lamlash or Brodick Bay it'll find itself on a nasty coast."</p>
<p>She was watching the trim brigantine which had already attracted my
attention. She was still standing off the coast, and evidently expected rough
weather, for her foresail had been taken in and her topsail reefed down.</p>
<p>"It's too cold for you up here!" I exclaimed at last, as the clouds covered
the sun, and the keen north wind came in more frequent gusts. \We walked back
together, until we were close to Carracuil, when she left me, taking the
footpath to Corriemains, which was about a mile from our bothy. I hoped that my
father had not observed us together. but he met me at the door, foaming with
passion. His face was quite livid with rage, and he held his shotgun in his
hands. I forget if I mentioned that in spite of his age he was one lof the most
powerful men I ever met in my life.</p>
<p>"So you've come!" he roared, shaking the gun at me. " You great gowk
&mdash;" I did not wait for the string of adjectives which I knew was
coming.</p>
<p>"You keep a civil tongue in your head," I said.</p>
<p>"You dare !" he shouted, raising his arm as if to strike me. " You wunna
come in here. You can gang back where you come frae!"</p>
<p>"You can go to the devil!" I answered, losing my temper completely, on which
he jabbed at me with the butt end of the gun, but I warded it off with my
stick. For a moment the devil was busy in me, and my throat was full of oaths,
but I choked them clown, and, turning on my heel, walked back to Corriemains,
where I spent the day with the Fullartons. It seemed to me that my father, who
had long been a miser, was rapidly becoming a madman&mdash;and a dangerous one
to boot.</p>
<br>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>My mind was so busy with my grievance that I was poor company, I fear, and
drank perhaps more whisky than was good for me. I remember that. I stumbled
over a stool once and that Minnie looked surprised and tearful. while old
Fullarton sniggered to himself and coughed to hide it. I did not set out for
home till half-past nine, which was a very late hour for the island. I knew my
father would be asleep, and that if I climbed through my bedroom window I
should have one night in peace.</p>
<p>lt was blowing great guns by this time, and I had to put my shoulder against
the gale as I came along the winding path which led down to Carracuil. I must
still have been under the intluence of liquor, for I remember that I sang
uproariously and joined my feeble pipe to the howling of the wind. I had just
got to the inclosure of our croft when a little incident occurred which helped
to sober me.</p>
<p>White is a color so rare in nature that in an island like ours, where even
paper was a precious commodity, it would arrest the attention at once.
Something white fluttered across my path and stuck flapping upon a furze bush.
I lifted it up and discovered, to my very great surprise, that it was a linen
pocket handkerchief&mdash;and scented. Now, I was very sure that beyond my own
there was no such thing as a white pocket handkerchief in the island. A small
community like ours knew each other's wardrobes to a nicety. But as to scent in
Uffa&mdash;it was preposterous! Who did the handkerchief belong to. then? Was
Minnie right. and was there really a stranger in the island? I walked on very
thouglitfully, holding my discovery in my hand and thinking of what Minnie had
seen the night before.</p>
<p>When I got into my bedroom and lit my rushlight I examined it again. It was
clean and new, with the initials "A.W." worked in red silk in the corner. There
was no other indication as to who it might belong to, though from its size it
was evidently a man's. The incident struck me as so extraordinary that I sat
for some time on the side of my bed turning it over in my befuddled mind, but
without getting any nearer a conclusion. I might even have taken my father into
confidence, but his hoarse snoring in the adjoining room showed that he was
fast asleep. It is as well that it was so, for I was in no humour to be
bullied, and we might have had words. The old man had little longer to live,
and it is some solace to me now that that little was unmarred by any further
strife between us. I did not take my clothes off, for my brain was getting
swimmy after its temporary clearness, so I dropped my head upon the pillow and
sank into profound slumber. I must have slept about four hours when I woke with
a violent start. To this day I have never known what it was that roused me.
Everything was perfectly still, and yet I found all my faculties in a state of
extreme tension. Was there some one in the room?</p>
<p>It was very dark, but I peered about, leaning on my elbow. There was nothing
to be seen, but still that eerie feeling haunted me. At that moment the flying
scud passed away from the face of the moon and a flood of cold light was poured
into my chamber. I turned my eyes up instinctively, and&mdash;good
God!&mdash;there at the window was the face, an evil. malicious face, hard- cut
and distinct against the silvery radiance, glaring in at me as Minnie had seen
it the night before. For one moment I tingled and palpitated like a frighten ed
child; the next both glass and sash were gone and I was rolling over and over
on the gravel path with my arms round a tall strong man&mdash; the two of us
worrying each other like a pair of dogs. Almost by intuition I knew as we went
down together that he had slipped his hand into his side pocket, and I clung to
that wrist like grim death. He tried hard to free it, but Iwas too strong for
him, and we staggered on to our feet again in the same position, panting and
snarling.</p>
<p>"Let go of my hand, damn you!" he said.</p>
<p>"Let go that pistol, then" I gasped.</p>
<p>We looked hard at each other in the moonlight, and than he laughed and
opened his fingers. A heavy. glittering object, which I could see was a
revolver, dropped witha clink on to the gravel. I put my foot on it and let go
my grip of him.</p>
<p>"Well, matey, how now," he said with another laugh. "Is that the end of a
round or the end of a battle? You islanders seem a hospitable lot.Your're so
ready to welcome a. stranger that you can't. wait to find the door, but must;
come flying through tho window like infernal fireworks."</p>
<p>"What do you want to come prowling round people's houses at night for, with
weapons in your pocket," I asked. sternly.</p>
<p>"I should think I needed a weapon," he answered, "when ther are young devils
like you knocking around, HuIlo! here's another of the family."</p>
<p>I turned my heady and there was my father almost at my elbow. He had come
round from the front door. His gray woolen night dress and grizzled hair were
streaming in the wind, and he was evidently much excited. He had in his hand
the double-barreled gun with which he had threatened me in the morning. He put
this up to his shoulder, and would most certainly have blown out either my
brains or those of the stranger, had I not turned away the barrel with my
hand.</p>
<p>"Wait a bit, father," I said, " let us hear what he has to say for himself.
And you," I continued, turning to the stranger, "can come inside with us and
justify yourselt if you can. But remember we are in a majority, so keep your
tongue between your teeth."</p>
<p>"Not so fast, my young bantam," he grumbled; " you've got my six-shooter,
but I have a Derringer in my pocket. I learned in Colorado to carry them both.
However, come along into this shanty of yours, and let us get the damned
palaver over. I'm wet through, and most infernally hungry."</p>
<p>My father was still mumbling to himself and fidgeting with his gun, but he
did not oppose my taking the stranger into the house. I struck a match and lit
the oil lamp in the kitchen, on which our prisoner stooped down to it and began
smoking a cigarette. As the light fell full on his face both my father and I
took a good look at him. He was a man of about forty, remarkably handsome, of
rather a Spanish type, with blue&mdash;black hair and beard, and sun-burned
features. His eyes were very bright and their gaze so intense that you would
think they projected somewhat, unless you saw him in profile. There was a dash
of recklessness and devilry about them, which, with his wiry, powerful frame
and jaunty manner, gave the impression of a man whose past had been an
adventurous one. He was elegantly dressed in a velveteen jacket and grayish
trousers of a foreign cut. Without in the least resenting our prolonged
scrutiny. he seated himself upon the dresser, swinging his legs and blowing
little blue wreaths from his cigarette. His appearance seemed to reassure my
father, or perhaps it was the sight of the rings which flashed on the
stranger's left hand every time he raised it to his lips.</p>
<p>"Ye munna mind Archie, Sir," he said in a cringing voice. "He was aye a
fashious bairn, ower quick wi' his hands, and wi' mair muscle than brains. I
was fashed mysel' wi' the sudden stour, but as tae shootin' at ye, Sir, that
was a' an auld man's havers. Nae doobt ye're a veesitor, or maybe it's a
shipwreck&mdash;it's no' a shipwreck, is't?" The idea awoke the covetous devil
in my father's soul, and it looked out through his glistening eyes, and set his
long stringy hands a-shaking.</p>
<p>"I came here in a boat," said the stranger shortly. "This was the iirst
house I came to after I left the shore, and I'm not likely to forget the
reception you have given me. That young hopeful of yours has nearly broken my
back."</p>
<p>"A good job too!" I interrupted hotly, "why couldn't you come up to the door
like a man, instead of skulking at the window?"</p>
<p>"Hush, Archie, hush !" said my father imploringly; while our visitor grinned
across at me as amicably as if my speech had been most conciliatory.</p>
<p>"I don't blame you," he said&mdash;he spoke with a strange mixture of
accents, sometimes with a foreign lisp, sometimes with a slight Yankee
intonation, and at other times very purely indeed. " I have done the same,
mate. Maybe you noticed a brigantine standing on and off the shore
yesterday?"</p>
<p>I nodded my head.</p>
<p>"That was mine," he said. "I'm owner, skipper, and everything else. Why
shouldn't a man spend his money in his own way? I like cruising about and I
like new experiences. I suppose there's no harm in that. I was in the
Mediterranean last month, but I'm sick of blue skies and fine weather. Chios is
a damnable paradise of a place. I've come up here for a little fresh air and
freedom. I cruised all down the western isles, and when we came abreast ef this
place of yours it rather took my fancy, so I hauled the foreyard aback and came
ashore last night to prospect. It wasn't this house I struck, but another
further to the west'ard: however, I saw enough to be sure it was a place after
my own heart&mdash;a real quiet corner. So I went back and set everything
straight aboard yesterday, and now here I am. You can put me up for a few
weeks, I suppose. I'm not hard to please, and I can pay my way; suppose we say
ten dollars a week for board and lodging, and a fortnight to be paid in
advance?</p>
<p>He put his hand in his pocket and pro-duced four shining napoleons, which he
pushed along the dresser to my father, who grabbed them up eagerly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I gave you such a rough reception," I said rather awkwardly. "I
was hardly awake at the time."</p>
<p>"Say no more, mate, say no more!" he shouted heartily, holding out his hand
and clasping mine. "Hard knocks are nothing new to me. I suppose we may
consider the bargain settled then?"</p>
<p>"Ye can bide as lang as ye wull, Sir," answered my father, still fingering
the four coins. "Archie and me'll do a' we can to mak' your veesit a pleasant
ane. It's no' such a dreary place as ye might think. When the Lamlash boats
come in we get the papers and a' the news."</p>
<p>It struck me that the stranger looked anything but overjoyed by this piece
of inforniation. "You don't mean to say that you get the papers here," he
said.</p>
<p>"O aye, the <i>Scotsman</i> an' the Glasgey <i>Herald</i>. But maybe you
would like Archie and me to row ower to your ship in the morn, an' fetch your
luggage?</p>
<p>"The brig is fifty miles away by this time," said,our visitor. "She is
running before the wind for Marseilles. I told the mate to bring her round
again in a month or so. As to luggage, I always travel light in that matter. If
a man's purse is only full he can do with very little else. All I have is in a
bundle under your window. By the way, my name is Digby&mdash;Charles
Digby."</p>
<p>"I thought your initials were A.W.," I remarked.</p>
<p>He sprang off the dresser as if he had been stung, and is face turned quite
gray for a moment. "What the devil do you mean by that?"' he said.</p>
<p>"I thought this might be yours," I answered, handing him the handkerchief I
had found.</p>
<p>'"Oh, is that all !" he said, with rather a forced laugh. "I didn't quite
see what you were driving at. That's all right. It belongs to Whittingdale, my
second oflicer. l'll keep it until I see him again. And now suppose you give me
something to eat, for I'm about famished."</p>
<p>We brought him out such rough fare as was to be found in our larder, and he
ate ravenously, and tossed off a stiff glass of whisky and water. Afterward my
father showed him into the solitary spare bedroom, with which he professed
himself well pleased, and we all settled down for the night. As I went back to
my couch I noticed that the gale had freshened up, and I saw long streamers of
seaweed flying past my broken window in the moonlight. A great bat fluttered
into the room, which is reckoned a sure sign of misfortune in the islands; but
I was never superstitious, and let the poor thing find its way out again
unmolested.</p>
<br>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>In the morning it was still blowing a whole gale, though the sky was blue
for the most part. Our guest was up betimes, and we walked down to the beach
together. It was at sight to see the great rollers sweeping in, overtopping one
another like a herd of oxen, and then bursting with a roar, sending the
Carracuil pebbles flying before them like grapeshot and filling the whole air
with drifting spume.</p>
<p>We were standing together watching the scene, when, looking round, I saw my
father hurrying towards us. He had been up and out since early dawn. When he
saw us looking he began waving his hands and shouting, but the wind carried his
voice sway. We ran towards him, however, seeiing that he was heavy with
news.</p>
<p>"The brig's wrecked, and they're all drowned!" he cried as we met him.</p>
<p>"What!" roared our visitor.</p>
<p>If ever I heard exceeding great joy compressed into a monosyllable it
vibrated in that one.</p>
<p>"They're a' drowned and naething saved! repeated my father. "Come yoursel'
and see."</p>
<p>We followed him across the Combera to the level sends on the other side.
They were strewn with wreckage, broken pieces of bulwark and handrail, paneling
of a cabin, and an occasional caks. A single large spar was tossing in the
waves close to the shore, occasionally shooting up towards the sky like some
giant's javelin, then sinking and disappearing in the trough of the great
scooping seas. Digby hurried up to the nearest piece of timber, and stooping
over It examined it intently.</p>
<p>"By God!" he said at last, taking in a long breath between his teeth, "you
are right. It's the Proserpine, and all hands are-lost. What a termble
thing!"</p>
<p>His face was very solemn as he spoke, but his eyes danced and glittered. I
was beginning to conceive .a great repugnanee and distrust toward this man.</p>
<p>"Is there no chance of any one having got ashore?" he said.</p>
<p>"Na, na, nor cargo neither," my father answered with real grief in his
voice. "Ye dinna ken this coast. There's an awful undertow outside the Winners,
and it's a' swept round to Holy Isle. De'il take it, if there was to be a
shipwreck what for should they no run their ship agroond to the east'ard o' the
point and let an honest mun have the pickings instead o' they rascally loons in
Arran? An empty barrel might float in here, but there's no chance o' a sea
chest, let alane a body."</p>
<p>"Poor fellows!" said Digby. " But there&mdash;-we must meet it some day, and
why not here and now? I've lost my ship, but, thank heaven, I can buy another.
It is sad about them though&mdash;very sad. I warned Lamarck that he was
waiting too long with a low barometer and an ugly shore under his lee. He has
himself to thank. He was my first officer, a prying, covetous, meddlesome
hound."</p>
<p>"Don't call him names!" I said. "He's dead."</p>
<p>"Well said, my young prig!" he answered. "Perhaps you wouldn't be so
mealy-mouthed yourself if you lost five thousand pounds before breakfast. But
there&mdash;there's no use crying over spilt rnilk. <i>Vogue la
gal&egrave;re!</i> as the French say. Things are never so bad but that they
might be worse."</p>
<p>My father and Digby stayed at the scene of the wreck, but I walked over to
Corriemains to reassure Minnie's mind as to the apparition at the window. Her
opinion, when I had told her all, coincided with mine, that perhaps the crew of
the brig knew more about the stranger than he cared for. We agreed that I
should keep a close eye upon him without letting him know that he was
watched.</p>
<p>"But oh, Archie," she said, &ldquo;ye munna cross him or anger him while he
carries them awfu' weapons. Ye maun be douce and saft, and no' gainsay
him&middot;."</p>
<p>I laughed, and promised her to be very prudent, which reassured her a
little. Old Fullarton walked back with me in the hope of picking up a piece of
timber, and both he an my father patrolled the shore for many days, without,
however, finding any prize of importance, for the undercurrent off the Wiinners
was very strong, and everything had probably drifted right round to Lamlash
Bay, in Arran.</p>
<p>It was wonderful how quickly the stranger accommodated himself to our
insular ways, and how useful he made himself about the homesteading. Within a
fortnight he knew the island almost as well as I did myself. Had it not been
for that one unpleasant recollection of the shipwreck which rankled in my
remembrance. I could have found it in my heart to become fond of him. His
nature was a tropical one&mdash;fiiercely depressed at times, but sunny as a
rule, bursting continually into jest and song from pure instinct, in a manner
which is unknown among us Northerners. In his graver moments he was a most
interesting companion, talking shrewdly and eloquently of men and manners and
his own innumerable and strange adventures. I have seldom heard a more
brilliant conversationalist. Of an evening he would keep my father and myself
spellbound by the kitchen fire for hours and hours, while he chatted away in a
desultory fashion and smoked his cigarettes. It seemed to me that the packet he
had brought with him on the first night must have consisted en-tirely of
tobacco. I noticed that in these conversations, which were mostly addressed to
my father, he used, unconsciously perhaps, to play upon the weak side of the
old man's nature. Tales of cunning, of smartness, of various ways in which
mankind had been cheated and money gained, came most readily to his lips, and
were relished by an eager listener. I could not help one night remarkiug upon
it, when my father had gone out of the room, laughing hoarsely, and vibrating
with amusement over some story of how the Biscayan peasants will strap lanterns
to a bullock's horns and, taking the beast some distance inland on a stormy
night will make it prance and rear so that the ships at sea may imagine it to
be the lights of a vessel, and steer fearlessly in that direction only to find
themselves on a rockbound coast.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't tell such tales to an old man," I said.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," he answered very kindly, "you have seen nothing of the
world yet. You have formed fine ideas, no doubt, and notions of delicacy and
such things, and you are very dogmatic about them, as clever men of your age
always are. I had notions of right and wrong once, but it has been all knocked
out of me. It's just a sort of varnish which the rough friction of the world
soon rubs off. I started with a whole soul, but there are more gashes and seams
and scars in it now than there are in my body, and that's pretty fair, as
you'll allow"&mdash;with which he pulled open his tunic aud showed me his
chest.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" I said. "How on earth did you get those?"</p>
<p>"This was a bullet," he said, pointing to a deep bluish pucker underneath
his collar bone. "I got it behind the barricades in Berlin in eighteen hundred
and forty-eight. Langenback said it just missed the subclavian artery. And
this," he went on, indicating a pair of curious elliptical scars upon his
throat, "was a bite from a Sioux chief, when I was under Custer on the plains
&mdash;I've got an arrow wound ou my leg from the same party. This is from a
mutinous Lascar aboard ship, and the others are mere scratches&mdash;
Californian vaccination marks. You can excuse my being a little ready with my
own irons, though, when I've been dropped so often."</p>
<p>"What's this?" I asked, pointing to a little chamois leather bag which was
hung by a strong cord around his neck. "It looks like a charm."</p>
<p>He buttoned up his tunic again hastily, looking extremely disconcerted. "It
is nothing," he said brusquely. "I am a Roman Catholic, and it is what we call
a scapular."</p>
<p>I could hardly get another word out of him that night, and even next day he
was reserved and appeared to avoid me. This little incident made me very
thoughtful, the more so as I noticed shortly afterward, when standing over him,
that the string was no longer around his neck. Apparently he had taken it off
after my remark about it. What could there be in that leather bag which needed
such secrecy and precaution! Had I but known it, I would sooner have put my
left hand in the fire than have pursued that inquiry.</p>
<p>One of the peculiarities of our visitor was that in all his plans for the
future, with which he often regaled us, he seemed entirely untrammeled by any
monetary considerations. He would talk in the lightest and most offhand way of
schemes which would involve the outlay of much wealth. My father's eyes would
glisten as he heard him talk carelessly of sums which in our frugal minds
appeared enormous It seemed strange to both of us that a man who by his own
confession had been a vagabond and adventurer all his life should he in
possession of such a fortune. My father was inclined to put it down to some
stroke of luck on the American gold fields. I had my own ideas even then
&mdash;chaotic and half-formed as yet, but tending in the right direction. It
was not long before these suspicions began to assume a more definite shape,
which came about in this way. Minnie and I made the summit of the Combera cliff
a favorite trystiug place, as I think I mentioned before, and it was rare for a
day to pass without our spending two or three hours there. One morning, not
long after my chat with our guest, we were seated together in a littlo nook
there, which we had chosen as sheltering us from the wind as well as from my
father's observation, when Minnie caught sight of Digby walking along the
Carracuil beach. He sauntered up to the base of the cliff, which was boulder-
studded and slimy from the receding tide, but instead of turning back he kept
on climbing over the great green slippery stones, and threading his way among
the pools until he was standing immediately beneath us, so that we looked
straight down at him. To him the spot must have seemed the very acme of
seclusion, with the great sea in front, the rocks on each side and the
precipice behind. Even had he looked up he could hardly have made out the two
human faces which peered down at him from the distant ledge. He gave a hurried
glance around, and then slipping his hand into his pocket he pulled out the
leather bag which I had noticed and took out of it a small object which he held
in the palm of his hand and looked at long and, as it were, lovingly. We both
had an excellent view of it from where we lay. He then replaced it in the bag,
and shoving it down to the very bottom of his pocket picked his way back more
cheerily than he had come. Minnie and I looked at each other. She was smiling;
I was serious. "Did you see it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yon? Aye, I saw it,"</p>
<p>"What did you think it was, then?"</p>
<p>"A wee bit of glass," she answered, looking at me with wondering eyes.</p>
<p>"No," I cried excitedly, "glass could never catch the sun's rays so. It was
a diamond, and, if I mistake not, one of extraordinary value. It was as large
as all I have seen put together, and must be worth a fortune."</p>
<p>A diamond was a mere name to poor, simple Minnie, who had never seen one
before, nor had any conception of their value, and she prattled away to me
about this and that, but I hardly heard her. In vain she exhausted all her
little wiles in attempting to recall my attention. My mind was full of what I
had seen. Look where I would, the glistening of the breakers, or the sparkling
of the mica-laden rocks, recalled the brilliant facets of the gem which I had
seen. I was moody and distraught, and eventually let Minnie walk back to
Corriemains by herself, while I made my way to the homesteading. My father and
Digby were just sitting down to the midday meal, and the latter hailed me
cheerily.</p>
<p>"Come along mate," he cried, pushing over a stool, "we were just wondering
what had become of you. Ah! you rogue, I'll bet my bottom dollar it was that
pretty wench I saw the other day that kept you."</p>
<p>"Mind your own affairs," I answered angrily.</p>
<p>"Don't be thin skinned," he said, "young people should control their
tempers, and you've got a mighty bad one. my lad. Have you heard that I am
going to leave you?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear it," I said frankly; "when do you intend to go?"</p>
<p>"Next week," he answered, "but don't be afraid; you'll see me again. I've
had too good a time here to forget you easily. I'm going to buy a good steam
yacht&mdash;250 tons or thereabouts&mdash;and I'll bring her round in a few
months and give you a cruise."</p>
<p>"What would be a fair price for a craft of that sort?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Forty thousand dollars," said our visitor carelessly.</p>
<p>"You must very rich," I remarked, "to throw away so much' money on
pleasure."</p>
<p>"Rich!" echoed my companion, his southern blood mantling up for a moment.
"Rich; why, man, there is hardly a limit&mdash;but there, I was romancing a
bit. I'm fairly well off, or shall be very shortly."</p>
<p>"How did you make your money?" I asked. The question came so glibly to my
lips that I had no time to check it, though I felt the moment afterward that I
had made a mistake. Our guest drew himself into himself at once, and took no
notice of my query, whilo my father said:</p>
<p>"Hush, Archie laddie, ye munna speer they questions of the gentleman!" I
could see, however, from the old man's eager gray eyes, looking out from under
the great thatch of his brows, that he was meditating over the same problem
himself.</p>
<p>During the next couple of days I hesitated very often as to whether I should
tell my father of what I had seen and the opinions I had formed about our
visitor; but he forestalled me by making a discovery himself which supplemented
mine and explained all that had been dark. It was one day when the stranger was
out for a ramble that, entering the kitchen, I found my father sitting by the
fire deeply engaged in perusing a newspaper, spelling out the words laboriously
and following the lines with his great forefinger. As I came in he crumpled up
the paper as if his instinct were to conceal it, but then, spreading it out
again on his knee, he beckoned me over to him.</p>
<p>"Wha d'ye think this chiel Digby is?" he asked. I could see by his manner
that he was much excited.</p>
<p>"No good," I answered.</p>
<p>"Come here, laddie, come here!" he croaked. "You're a braw scholar. Read
this tae me alood&mdash;read it and tell me if you dinna think I've fitted the
cap on the right heid. It's a Glasgey <i>Herald</i> only four days auld
&mdash;a Loch Ranza feeshin' boat brought it in the morn. Begin frae here
&mdash;'Oor Paris Letter.' Here it is. 'Fuller details;' read it a' to me."</p>
<p>I began at the spot indicated, which waa a paragraph of the ordinary French
correspondence of the Glasgow paper. It ran in this way:</p>
<blockquote>"Fuller details have now come before the public of the diamond
robbery by which the Duchesse de Rochevieille lost her celebrated gem. The
diamond is a pure brilliant weighing eighty-three and one-half carats, and is
supposed to be the third largest in France and the seventeenth in Europe. It
came into the possession of the family through the great-granduncle of the
duchess, who fought under Bussy in India, and brought it back to Europe with
him. It represented a fortune then, but its value now is simply enormous. It
was taken, as will be remembered, from the jewel case of the duchess two months
ago during the night, and though the police have made every effort, no real
clue has been obtained as to the thief. They are very reticent upon the
subject, but it seems that they have reason to suspect one Achille Wolff, an
Americanized native of Lorraine, who had called at the chateau a short time
before. He is an eccentric man, of bohemian habits, and it is just possible
that his sudden disappearance at the time of the robbery may have been a
coincidence. In appearance he is described as romantic-looking, with an
artistic face, dark eyes and hair, and a brusque manner. A large reward is
offered for his capture."</blockquote>
<p>When I finished reading this my father and I sat looking at each other in
silence for a minute or so. Then my father jerked his finger over his shoulder.
"Yon's him," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, it must be he," I answered, thinking of the initials on the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>Again we were silent for a time. My father took one of the faggots out of
the grate and twisted it ahout in his hands. "It maun be a muckle stane," he
said. "He canna hae it aboot him. Likely he's left it in France."</p>
<p>"No, he has it with him," I said, like a cursed fool as I was.</p>
<p>"Hoo d'ye ken that?" asked the old man, looking up quickly with eager
eyes.</p>
<p>"Because I have seen it."</p>
<p>The faggot which he held broke in two in his grip, but he said nothing more.
Shortly afterward our guest came in, and we had dinner, but neither of us
alluded to the arrival of the paper.</p>
<br>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>I heard our visitor give a great scream. I have often been amused, when
reading stories told in the first person, to see how the narrator makes himself
out, as a matter of course, to be a perfect and spotless man. All around may
have their passions and weaknesses and vices, but he remains a cold and
blameless nonentity, running like a colorless thread through the tangled skein
of the story. I shall not fall into this error. I see myself as I was in those
days, shallow-hearted, hot-headed and with little principle of any kiud. Such I
was, and such I depict myself.</p>
<p>From the time that I finally identified our visitor Digby with Achille
Wolff, the diamond robber, my resolution was taken. Some might have been
squeamish in the matter, and thought that because he had shaken their hand and
broken their bread he had earned some sort of grace from them. I was not
troubled with sentimentality of this sort. He was a criminal escaping from
justice. Some providence had thrown him into our hands, and an enormous reward
awaited his betrayers. I never hesitated for a moment as to what was to be
done.</p>
<p>The more I thought of it the more I admired the cleverness with which he had
managed the whole business. He was clear that he had a vessel ready, manned
either by confederates or by unsuspecting fishermen. Hence he would be
independent of all those parts where the police would be on the lookout for
him. Again, if he had made for England or for America, he could hardly have
escaped ultimate capture, but by choosing one of the most desolate and lonely
spots in Europe he had thrown them off his track for a time, while the
destruction of the brig seemed to destroy the last clue to his whereabouts. At
present ho was entirely at our mercy, since he could not move from the island
without our help. There was no necessity for us to hurry, therefore, and we
could mature our plans at our leisure. But my father and I showed no change in
our manner toward our guest, and he himself was as cheery and light-hearted as
ever. It was pleasant to hear him singing as we mended the nets or calked the
boat. His voice was a very high tenor and one of the most melodious I ever
listened to. I am convinced that he could have made a name upon the operatic
stage, but like most versatile scoundrels he placed small account upon the
genuine talents which he possessed, and cultivated the worst portion of his
nature. My father used sometimes to eye him sideways in a strange manner, and I
thought I knew what he was thinking about&mdash;but there I made a mistake.</p>
<p>One day, about a week after our conversation, I was fixing up one of the
rails of our fence, which had been snapped in the gale, when my father came
along the seashore, plodding heavily among the pebbles, and sat down on a stone
at my elbow. I went on knocking in the nails, but looked at him from the corner
of my eyes as he pulled away at his short black pipe. I could see that he had
something weighty on his mind, for he knitted his brows and his lips
projected.</p>
<p>"D'ye mind what was in yon paper?" he said at last, knocking his ashes out
against the stone.</p>
<p>"Yes," I answered shortly.</p>
<p>"Well, what's your opeenion?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Why, that we should have the reward, of course!" I replied.</p>
<p>"The reward!" he said with a fierce snarl. "You would tak' the reward. You'd
let the stane that's worth thoosands an' thoosands gang awa' back tae some
furrin Papist, an a' for the sake o' a few pund that they'd fling till ye, as
they fling a bane to a dog when the meat's a' gone. It's a clean flingin' awa
o' the gifts o' Providence."</p>
<p>"Well, father," I said, laying down the hammer, "you must be satisfied with
what you can get. You can ouly have what is offered."</p>
<p>"But if we got the stane itsel'," whispered my father, with a leer ou his
face.</p>
<p>"He'd never give it up," I said.</p>
<p>"But if he deed while he's here&mdash;if he was suddenly"</p>
<p>"Drop it, father, drop it!" I cried, for the old man looked like a fiend out
of the pit. I saw now what he was aiming at.</p>
<p>"If he deed," he shouted, "wha saw him come, and wha wad speer where he'd
ganged till? If an accident happened, if he came by a dud on the heid, or woke
some nicht to find a knife at his trapple, wha wad be the wiser?"</p>
<p>"You mustn't speak so, father," I said, though I was thinking many things at
the same time.</p>
<p>"It may as well be oot as in," he answered, and went away rather sulkily,
turning around after a few yards and holding up his finger toward me to impress
the necessity of caution.</p>
<p>My father did not speak of this matter to me again, but what he said rankled
in my mind. I could hardly realize that he meant his words, for he had always,
as far as I knew, been an upright, righteous man, hard in his ways and grasping
in his nature, but guiltless of any great sin. Perhaps it was that he was
removed from temptation, for isothermal lines of crime might be drawn on the
map through places where it is hard to walk straight, and there are others
where it is as hard to fall. It was easy to be a saint in the Island of
Uffa.</p>
<p>One day we were finishing breakfast when our guest asked if the boat was
mended (one of the tholepins had been broken). I answered that it was.</p>
<p>"I want you two," he said, "to take me round to Lamlash to-day. You shall
have a couple of sovereigns for tho job. I don't know that I may not come back
with you&mdash;but I may stay."</p>
<p>My eyes met those of my father for a flash. "There's no' vera much wind," he
said.</p>
<p>"What there is is in the right direction," returned Digby, as I must call
him.</p>
<p>"The new foresail has no' been bent," persisted my father.</p>
<p>"There's no use throwing difficulties in the way," said our visitor angrily.
"If you won't come, I'll get Tommy Gibbs and his father, but go I shall. Is it
a bargain or not?"</p>
<p>"I'll gang," my father replied sullenly, and went down to get the boat
ready. I followed, and helped him to bend on the new foresail. I felt nervous
and excited.</p>
<p>"What do you intend to do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I dinna ken," he said irritably. "Gin the worst come to the worst we can
gie him up at Lamlash&mdash;but oh, it wad be a peety, an awfu' peety. You're
young an strong, laddie; can we no' master him between us?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "I'm ready to give him up, but I'm damned if I lay a hand on
him."</p>
<p>"You're a cooardly, white livered loon!" he cried, but I was not to be moved
by taunts, and left him mumbling to himself and picking at the sail with
nervous fingers. It was about two o'clock before tho boat was ready, but as
there was a slight breeze from the north we reckoned on reaching Lamlash before
nightfall. There was just a pleasant ripple upon the dark blue water, and as we
stood on the beach before shoving off we could see the Carlin's Leap and
Goatfell bathed in a purple mist, while beyond them along the horizon loomed
the long line of the Argyleshire hills. Away to the south the great bald summit
of Ailsa Crag glittered in the sun, and a single white fleck showed where a
fishing boat was beating up from the Scotch coast. Digby and I stepped into the
boat, but my father ran back to where I had been mending the rails and came
back with the hatchet in his hand, which he stowed away under the thwarts.</p>
<p>"What d'ye want with the axe?" our visitor asked.</p>
<p>"It's a handy thing to hae aboot a boat," my father answered with averted
eyes, and shoved us off. We set the foresail, jib and mainsail and shot away
across the Roost, with the blue water splashing merrily under our bows. Looking
back I saw the coast line of our little island extend rapidly on either side.
There was Carravoe which we had left, and our own beach of Carracuil, and the
steep, brown face of the Coinbera, and away behind the rugged crests of Beg-na-
phail and Beg-na-sacher I could see the red tiles of the byre of our
homesteading, and across the moor a thin blue reek in the air which marked the
position of Corriemains. My heart warmed toward the place which had been my
home since childhood.</p>
<p>We were about half way across the Roost when it fell a dead calm, and the
sails flapped against the mast. We were perfectly motionless except for the
drift of the current, which runs from north to south. I had been steering and
my father managing the sails, while the stranger smoked his eternal cigarettes
and admired the scenery; but at his suggestion we now got the sculls out to
row. I shall never know how it began, but as I was stooping down to pick up an
oar I heard our visitor give a great scream that he was murdered, aud looking
up I saw him with his face all in a sputter of blood leaning against the mast,
while my father made at him with the hatchet. Before I could move hand or foot
Digby rushed at the old man and caught him round the waist. "You gray-headed
devil," he cried in a husky voice, "I feel that you have done for me; but
you'll never get what you want. No&mdash;never! never! never!" Nothing can ever
erase from my memory the intense and concentrated malice of those words. My
father gave a raucous cry, they swayed and balanced for a moment, and then over
they went into the sea. I rushed to the side, boathook in hand, but they never
came up. As the long rings caused by the splash widened out, however, and left
an unruffled space in the center, I saw them once again. The water was very
clear, and far, far down I could see the shimmer of two white faces coming and
going, faces which seemed to look up at me with an expression of unutterable
horror. Slowly they went down, revolving in each other's embrace until they
were nothing but a dark loom and then faded from my view forever. There they
shall lie, the Frenchman and the Scot, till the great trumpet shall sound, and
the sea give up its dead. Storms may rage above them and great ships labor and
creak, but their slumber shall be dreamless and unruffled in the silent green
depths of the Roost of Uffa. I trust when the great day shall come that they
will bring up the cursed stone with them that they may show the sore temptation
which the devil had placed in their way as some slight extenuation of their
errors while in this mortal flesh.</p>
<p>It was a weary and lonesome journey back to Carravoe. I remember tug-
tugging at the oars as though to snap them in trying to relieve the tension of
my mind. Towards evening a breeze sprang up and helped me on my way, and before
nightfall I was back in the lonely homesteading once more, and all that had
passed that Spring afternoon lay behind me like some horrible nightmare.</p>
<p>I did not remain in Uffa. The croft and the boat were sold by public roup in
the market place of Androssan, and the sum realized was sufficient to enable me
to continue my medical studies at the university. I fled from the island as
from a cursed place, nor did I ever set foot on it again. Gibbs and his son,
and even Minnie Fullarton, too, passed out of my life completely and forever.
She missed me for a time no doubt, but I have heard that young McBane, who took
the farm, went a-wooing to Corriemains after the white-fishing, and, as he was
a comely fellow enough, he may have consoled her for my loss. As for myself, I
have settled quietly down into a large middle-class practice in Paisley. It has
been in the brief intervals of professional work that I have jotted down these
reminiscences of the events which lead up to my father's death. Achille Wolff
and the Rochevieille diamond are things of the past now, but there may be some
who will care to hear of how they visited the Island of Uffa.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>THE VOICE OF SCIENCE</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Strand Magazine,</i> March 1891.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Mrs. Esdaile, of the Lindens, Birchespool, was a lady of quite remarkable
scientific attainments. As honorary secretary of the ladies' branch of the
local Eclectic Society, she shone with a never-failing brilliance. It was even
whispered that on the occasion of the delivery of Professor Tomlinson's
suggestive lecture "On the Perigenesis of the Plastidule" she was the only
woman in the room who could follow the lecturer even as far as the end of his
title. In the seclusion of the Lindens she supported Darwin, laughed at Mivart,
doubted Haeckel, and shook her head at Weissman, with a familiarity which made
her the admiration of the University professors and the terror of the few
students who ventured to cross her learned but hospitable threshold. Mrs.
Esdaile had, of course, detractors. It is the privilege of exceptional merit.
There were bitter feminine whispers as to the cramming from encyclopzedias and
text-books which preceded each learned meeting, and as to the care with which
in her own house the conversation was artfully confined to those particular
channels with which the hostess was familiar. Tales there were, too, of
brilliant speeches written out in some masculine hand, which had been committed
to memory by the ambitious lady, and had afterwards flashed out as extempore
elucidations of some dark, half-explored corner of modern science. It was even
said that these little blocks of information got jumbled up occasionally in
their bearer's mind, so that after an entomological lecture she would burst
into a geological harangue, or <i>vice versa,</i> to the great confusion of her
audience. So ran the gossip of the malicious, but those who knew her best were
agreed that she was a very charming and clever little person.</p>
<p>It would have been a strange thing had Mrs. Esdaile not been popular among
local scientists, for her pretty house, her charming grounds, and all the
hospitality which an income of two thousand a year will admit of, were always
at their command. On her pleasant lawns in the summer, and round her
drawing-room fire in the winter, there was much high talk of microbes, and
leucocytes, and sterilised bacteria, where thin, ascetic materialists from the
University upheld the importance of this life against round, comfortable
champions of orthodoxy from the Cathedral Close. And in the heat of thrust and
parry, when scientific proof ran full tilt against inflexible faith, a word
from the clever widow, or an opportune rattle over the keys by her pretty
daughter Rose, would bring all back to harmony once more.</p>
<p>Rose Esdaile had just passed her twentieth year, and was looked upon as one
of the beauties of Birchespool. Her face was, perhaps, a trifle long for
perfect symmetry, but her eyes were fine, her expression kindly, and her
complexion beautiful. It was an open secret, too, that she had under her
father's will five hundred a year in her own right. With such advantages a far
plainer girl than Rose Esdaile might create a stir in the society of a
provincial town.</p>
<p>A scientific conversazione in a private house is an onerous thing to
organise, yet mother and daughter had not shrunk from the task. On the morning
of which I write, they sat together surveying their accomplished labours, with
the pleasant feeling that nothing remained to be done save to receive the
congratulations of their friends. With the assistance of Rupert, the son of the
house, they had assembled from all parts of Birchespool objects of scientific
interest, which now adorned the long tables in the drawing-room. Indeed, the
full tide of curiosities of every sort which had swelled into the house had
overflowed the rooms devoted to the meeting, and had surged down the broad
stairs to invade the dining-room and the passage. The whole villa had become a
museum. Specimens of the flora and fauna of the Philippine Islands, a ten-foot
turtle carapace from the Gallapagos, the os frontis of the Bos montis as shot
by Captain Charles Beesly in the Thibetan Himalayas, the bacillus of Koch
cultivated on gelatine&mdash;these and a thousand other such trophies adorned
the tables upon which the two ladies gazed that morning.</p>
<p>"You've really managed it splendidly, ma," said the young lady, craning her
neck up to give her mother a congratulatory kiss. "It was so brave of you to
undertake it."</p>
<p>"I think that it will do," purred Mrs. Esdaile complacently. "But I do hope
that the phonograph will work without a hitch. You know at the last meeting of
the British Association I got Professor Standerton to repeat into it his
remarks on the life history of the Medusiform Gonophore."</p>
<p>"How funny it seems," exclaimed Rose, glancing at the square box-like
apparatus, which stood in the post of honour on the central table, "to think
that this wood and metal will begin to speak just like a human being."</p>
<p>"Hardly that, dear. Of course the poor thing can say nothing except what is
said to it. You always know exactly what is coming. But I do hope that it will
work all right."</p>
<p>"Rupert will see to it when he comes up from the garden. He understands all
about them. Oh, ma, I feel so nervous."</p>
<p>Mrs. Esdaile looked anxiously down at her daughter, and passed her hand
caressingly over her rich brown hair. "I understand," she said, in her
soothing, cooing voice, "I understand."</p>
<p>"He will expect an answer to-night, ma."</p>
<p>"Follow your heart, child. I am sure that I have every confidence in your
good sense and discretion. I would not dictate to you upon such a matter."</p>
<p>"You are so good, ma. Of course, as Rupert says, we really know very little
of Charles&mdash;of Captain Beesly. But then, ma, all that we do know is in his
favour."</p>
<p>"Quite so, dear. He is musical, and well-informed, and good-humoured, and
certainly extremely handsome. It is clear, too, from what he says, that he has
moved in the very highest circles."</p>
<p>"The best in India, ma. He was an intimate friend of the Governor-General's.
You heard yourself what he said yesterday about the D'Arcies, and Lady
Gwendoline Fairfax, and Lord Montague Grosvenor."</p>
<p>"Well, dear," said Mrs. Esdaile resignedly, "you are old enough to know your
own mind. I shall not attempt to dictate to you. I own that my own hopes were
set upon Professor Stares."</p>
<p>"Oh, ma, think how dreadfully ugly he is."</p>
<p>"But think of his reputation, dear. Little more than thirty, and a member of
the Royal Society."</p>
<p>"I couldn't ma. I don't think I could, if there was not another man in the
world. But, oh, I do feel so nervous; for you can't think how earnest he is. I
must give him an answer to-night. But they will be here in an hour. Don't you
think that we had better go to our rooms?"</p>
<p>The two ladies had risen, when there came a quick masculine step upon the
stairs, and a brisk young fellow, with curly black hair, dashed into the
room.</p>
<p>"All ready?" he asked, running his eyes over the lines of relic-strewn
tables.</p>
<p>"All ready, dear," answered his mother.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am glad to catch you together," said he, with his hands buried deeply
in his trouser pockets, and an uneasy expression on his face. "There's one
thing that I wanted to speak to you about. Look here, Rosie; a bit of fun is
all very well; but you wouldn't be such a little donkey as to think seriously
of this fellow Beesly?"</p>
<p>"My dear Rupert, do try to be a little less abrupt," said Mrs. Esdaile, with
a deprecating hand outstretched.</p>
<p>"I can't help seeing how they have been thrown together. I don't want to be
unkind, Rosie; but I can't stand by and see you wreck your life for a man who
has nothing to recommend him but his eyes and his moustache. Do be a sensible
girl, Rosie, and have nothing to say to him."</p>
<p>"It is surely a point, Rupert, upon which I am more fitted to decide than
you can be," remarked Mrs. Esdaile, with dignity.</p>
<p>"No, mater, for I have been able to make some inquiries. Young Cheffington,
of the Gunners, knew him in India. He says&mdash;"</p>
<p>But his sister broke in upon his revelations. "I won't stay here, ma, to
hear him slandered behind his back," she cried, with spirit. "He has never said
anything that was not kind of you, Rupert, and I don't know why you should
attack him so. It is cruel, unbrotherly." With a sweep and a whisk she was at
the door, her cheek flushed, her eyes sparkling, her bosom heaving with this
little spurt of indignation, while close at her heels walked her mother with
soothing words, and an angry glance thrown back over her shoulder. Rupert
Esdaile stood with his hands burrowing deeper and deeper into his pockets, and
his shoulders rising higher and higher to his ears, feeling intensely guilty,
and yet not certain whether he should blame himself for having said too much or
for not having said enough.</p>
<p>Just in front of him stood the table on which the phonograph, with wires,
batteries, and all complete, stood ready for the guests whom it was to amuse.
Slowly his hands emerged from his pockets as his eye fell upon the apparatus,
and with languid curiosity he completed the connection, and started the
machine. A pompous, husky sound, as of a man clearing his throat proceeded from
the instrument, and then in high, piping tones, thin but distinct, the
commencement of the celebrated scientist's lecture. "Of all the interesting
problems," remarked the box, "which are offered to us by recent researches into
the lower orders of marine life, there is none to exceed the retrograde
metamorphosis which characterises the common barnacle. The differentiation of
an amorphous protoplasmic mass&mdash;" Here Rupert Esdaile broke the connection
again, and the funny little tinkling voice ceased as suddenly as it began.</p>
<p>The young man stood smiling, looking down at this garrulous piece of wood
and metal, when suddenly the smile broadened, and a light of mischief danced up
into his eyes. He slapped his thigh, and danced round in the ecstasy of one who
has stumbled on a brand-new brilliant idea. Very carefully he drew forth the
slips of metal which recorded the learned Professor's remarks, and laid them
aside for future use. Into the slots he thrust virgin plates, all ready to
receive an impression, and then, bearing the phonograph under his arm, he
vanished into his own sanctum. Five minutes before the first guests had arrived
the machine was back upon the table, and all ready for use.</p>
<p>There could be no question of the success of Mrs. Esdaile's conversazione.
From first to last everything went admirably. People stared through
microscopes, and linked hands for electric shocks, and marvelled at the
Gallapagos turtle, the os frontis of the Bos montis, and all the other
curiosities which Mrs. Esdaile had taken such pains to collect. Groups formed
and chatted round the various cases. The Dean of Birchespool listened with a
protesting lip, while Professor Maunders held forth upon a square of triassic
rock, with side-thrusts occasionally at the six days of orthodox creation; a
knot of specialists disputed over a stuffed ornithorhynchus in the corner;
while Mrs. Esdaile swept from group to group, introducing, congratulating,
laughing, with the ready, graceful tact of a clever woman of the world. By the
window sat the heavily-moustached Captain Beesly, with the daughter of the
house, and they discussed a problem of their own, as old as the triassic rock,
and perhaps as little understood.</p>
<p>"But I must really go and help my mother to entertain, Captain Beesly," said
Rose at last, with a little movement as if to rise.</p>
<p>"Don't go, Rose. And don't call me Captain Beesly; call me Charles. Do,
now!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, Charles."</p>
<p>"How prettily it sounds from your lips! No, now, don't go. I can't bear to
be away from you. I had heard of love, Rose; but how strange it seems that I,
after spending my life amid all that is sparkling and gay, should only find out
now, in this little provincial town, what love really is!"</p>
<p>"You say so; but it is only a passing fancy."</p>
<p>"No, indeed. I shall never leave you, Rose&mdash;never, unless you drive me
away from your side. And you would not be so cruel&mdash;you would not break my
heart?"</p>
<p>He had very plaintive, blue eyes, and there was such a depth of sorrow in
them as he spoke that Rose could have wept for sympathy.</p>
<p>"I should be very sorry to cause you grief in any way," she said, in a
faltering tone.</p>
<p>"Then promise&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no; we cannot speak of it just now, and they are collecting round the
phonograph. Do come and listen to it. It is so funny. Have you ever heard
one?"</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"It will amuse you immensely. And I am sure that you would never guess what
it is going to talk about."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I won't tell you. You shall hear. Let us have these chairs by the open
door; it is so nice and cool."</p>
<p>The company had formed an expectant circle round the instrument. There was a
subdued hush as Rupert Esdaile made the connection, while his mother waved her
white hand slowly from left to right to mark the cadence of the sonorous
address which was to break upon their ears.</p>
<p>"How about Lucy Araminta Pennyfeather?" cried a squeaky little voice. There
was a rustle and a titter among the audience. Rupert glanced across at Captain
Beesly. He saw a drooping jaw, two protruding eyes, and a face the colour of
cheese.</p>
<p>"How about little Martha Hovedean of the Kensal Choir Union?" cried the
piping voice.</p>
<p>Louder still rose the titters. Mrs. Esdaile stared about her in
bewilderment. Rose burst out laughing, and the Captain's jaw drooped lower
still, with a tinge of green upon the cheese-like face.</p>
<p>"Who was it who hid the ace in the artillery card-room at Peshawur? Who was
it who was broke in consequence? Who was it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Esdaile, "what nonsense is this? The machine is
out of order. Stop it, Rupert. These are not the Professor's remarks. But, dear
me, where is our friend Captain Beesly gone?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid that he is not very well, ma," said Rose. "He rushed out of the
room."</p>
<p>"There can't be much the matter," quoth Rupert. "There he goes, cutting down
the avenue as fast as his legs will carry him. I do not think, somehow, that we
shall see the Captain again. But I must really apologise. I have put in the
wrong slips. These, I fancy are those which belong to Professor Standerton's

<p>Rose Esdaile has become Rose Stares now, and her husband is one of the most

<h3>Published in <i>Lloyd's Weekly London Newspaper,</i> 26 July 1891.</h3>
<hr>
<p>There was some surprise in Birchespool when so quiet and studious a man as
Colonel Bolsover became engaged to the very dashing and captivating Miss Hilda
Thornton. And in truth this surprise was mingled with some feeling of pity for
the gallant officer. It was not that anything really damaging could be alleged
against the young lady. Her birth at least was excellent, and her
accomplishments undeniable. But for some years she had been mixed up with a
circle of people whose best friends could not deny that they were fast. "Smart"
they preferred to call themselves, but the result was much the same.</p>
<p>Hilda Thornton was a very lovely woman of the blonde, queenly, golden-haired
type. She was the belle of the garrison, and each fresh subaltern who came up
from Woolwich or from Sandhurst bowed down and adored her. Yet subalterns grew
into captains and captains into majors without a change in her condition. An
interminable succession of sappers, gunners, cavalrymen and linesmen filed past
through the social life of Birchespool, but Miss Hilda Thornton remained Miss
Hilda still. Already she had begun to show a preference for subdued lights, and
to appear some years younger in the evening than in the morning, when good,
simple-hearted Colonel Bolsover, in one of his brief sallies into the social
world, recognising in her all that was pure and fresh, with much diffidence
made her the offer of an honoured name, a good position, and some two thousand
a year. It is true that there were a grizzled head and an Indian constitution
to set off against these advantages, but the young lady showed no hesitation,
and the engagement was the talk next day of all the mess-rooms and
drawing-rooms of the little town.</p>
<p>But even now it was felt that there was a doubt as to her ultimate marriage.
Spinsters whispered dark prophecies upon the subject, and sporting ensigns had
money on the event. Twice already had Hilda approached the happy state, and
twice there had been a ring returned, and a pledge unfulfilled. The reason of
these fiascos had never been made plain. There were some who talked of the
fickleness and innate evil of mankind. Others spoke of escapes, and hinted at
sinister things which had come to the horrified ears of her admirers, and had
driven them from her side. Those who knew most said least, but they shook their
heads sadly when the colonel's name was mentioned.</p>
<p>Just six days before the time fixed for the marriage Colonel Bolsover was
seated in his study with his cheque-book upon the desk in front of him,
glancing over the heavy upholsterer's bills, which had already commenced to
arrive, when he received a visit from his very old friend, Major Barnes, of the
Indian horse. They had done two campaigns together on the frontier, and it was
a joy to Bolsover to see the dark, lean face and the spare, wiry figure of the
Bengal Lancer.</p>
<p>"My dear boy," he cried, with outstretched hands. "I did not even know that
you were in England."</p>
<p>"Six months' furlough," answered his old comrade, returning his greeting
warmly. "Had a touch of liver in Peshawar, and a board thought that a whiff of
the old air might stiffen me up. But you are looking well, Bolsover."</p>
<p>"So I should Barnes. I have had some good fortune lately, better fortune
than I deserve. Have you heard it? You may congratulate me, my boy. I am a
Benedict from next Wednesday."</p>
<p>The Indian soldier grasped the hand which was held out to him, but his grip
was slack and his eyes averted.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I hope it is all for the best, Bolsover."</p>
<p>"For the best? Why, man, she is the most charming girl in England. Come in
this evening and be introduced."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Bolsover, I think that I have already met the young lady. Miss
Hilda Thornton, I believe? I dined with the Sappers last night and heard the
matter mentioned."</p>
<p>Barnes was talking in a jerky, embarrassed style, which was very different
to his usual free and frank manner. He paused to pick his words, and scraped
his chin with his finger and thumb. The colonel glanced at him with a
questioning eye.</p>
<p>"There's something wrong, Jock," said he.</p>
<p>"Well, old chap, I have been thinking&mdash;we have been
thinking&mdash;several of your old chums, that is to say&mdash;I wish to the
Lord they would come and do their own talking&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're a deputy?" Bolsover's mouth set, and his brows gathered.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, we were talking it over, you know, Bolsover, and it seemed
to us that marriage is a very responsible kind of thing, you know."</p>
<p>"Well, you ought to know," said the colonel, with a half smile. "You have
been married twice."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, but in each case I give you my word, Bolsover, that I acted with
prudence. I knew all about my wife and her people: upon my honour I did!"</p>
<p>"I don't quite see what you are driving at, Barnes."</p>
<p>"Well, old chap, I am rather clumsy at anything of this sort. It's out of my
line, but you will forgive me, I am sure. But we can't see a chum in danger
without a word to warn him. I knew Tresillian in India. We shared one tent in
the Afghan business. Tresillian knew Miss Thornton, no one better. I have
reason to believe that when he was quartered here five years ago&mdash;"</p>
<p>Colonel Bolsover sprang from his chair, and threw up a protesting hand.</p>
<p>"Not another word, Barnes," said he. "I have already heard too much. I
believe that you mean well to me, but I cannot listen to you upon this subject.
My honour will not permit it."</p>
<p>Barnes had risen from his chair, and the two old soldiers looked into each
other's eyes.</p>
<p>"You are quite resolved upon this, Bolsover?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>"Nothing would shake you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing on earth."</p>
<p>"Then that's an end of it. I won't say another word. I may be wrong and you
may be right. I am sure that I wish you every happiness from the bottom of my
heart."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Jock. But you'll stay tiffin. It's almost ready."</p>
<p>"No, thank you, my boy. I have a cab at the door, and I am off to town. I
ought to have started by the early train, but I felt that I could not leave
Birchespool without having warned&mdash;that is to say congratulated you upon
the event. I must run now, but you'll hear from me by Friday."</p>
<p>Such was the embassy of Major Jack Barnes, the one and only attempt which
was made to shake the constancy of Percy Bolsover. Within a week Hilda Thornton
was Hilda Thornton no longer; and amid a pelting storm of rice the happy couple
made their way to the Birchespool railway station, <i>en route</i> for the
Riviera.</p>
<p>For fifteen months all went well with the Bolsovers. They had taken a large
detached villa which stood in its own grounds on the outskirts of Birchespool,
and there they entertained, with a frequency and a lavishness which astonished
those who had known the soldierly simplicity of the colonel's bachelor days.
Indeed he had not altered in his tastes. A life of frivolity was thoroughly
repellent to him. But he was afraid of transplanting his wife too suddenly into
an existence which might seem to her to be austere. After all he was nearly
twenty years her senior, and was it reasonable to suppose that she could
conform her tastes to his? He must sacrifice his own tastes. It was a duty. He
must shake off his old ways and his old comforts. He set himself to the task
with all the energy and thoroughness of an old soldier, until Bolsover's dances
and Bolsover's dinners were one of the features of social life in
Birchespool.</p>
<p>It was in the second winter after their marriage that the great ball was
given in the little town on account of a very august and Royal visitor. The
cream of the county had joined with the garrison to make it a brilliant
success. Beautiful women were there in plenty. But Bolsover thought as he gazed
upon the dancers that there was none who could compare with his own wife. In a
grey tulle toilette, trimmed with apple-blossom, with a diamond aigrette
twinkling from amid her golden hair, she might have stood as the very type and
model of the blonde regal Anglo-Saxon beauty. In this light the first faint
traces of time were smoothed away, and, with a gleam of pleasure in her eyes,
and a dash of colour in her cheeks, she was so lovely that even the Royal and
august, though reported to be very blas&eacute; in the matter of beauty, was
roused to interest. The colonel stood among the palms and the rhododendrons,
following her with his eyes, and thrilling with pride as he noticed how heads
turned and quick whispers were exchanged as she passed through the crowd.</p>
<p>"You are to be congratulated, colonel," said Lady Shipton, the wife of the
general of the brigade. "Madame is quite our belle to-night."</p>
<p>"I am very flattered to hear you say so," said the colonel, rubbing his
hands in his honest delight.</p>
<p>"Ah, you know that you think so yourself," said the lady, archly, tapping
his arm with her fan. "I have been watching your eyes."</p>
<p>The colonel coloured slightly and laughed. "She certainly seems to be
enjoying herself," he remarked. "She is a little hard to please in the matter
of partners, and when I see her dance twice with the same I know that she is
satisfied."</p>
<p>The lady looked, and a slight shadow crossed her face. "Oh, her partner!"
she exclaimed. "I did not notice him."</p>
<p>"He looks like a man who has been hard hit at some time," observed the
colonel. "Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He used to be stationed here before you came. Then he got an
appointment and went to India. Captain Tresillian is his name, of the Madras
Staff corps."</p>
<p>"Home on leave, I suppose!"</p>
<p>"Yes. He only arrived last week."</p>
<p>"He needed a change," observed the colonel. "But the band is rather
overpowering here. This next is the 'Lancers.' May I have the pleasure?"</p>
<p>The face which had attracted the colonel's attention was indeed a remarkable
one&mdash;swarthy, keen, and hawklike, with sunken cheeks and deep set eyes,
which were Italian rather than English in their blackness and brightness. The
Celtic origin of his old Cornish blood showed itself in his thin, wiry figure,
his nervous, mobile features, and the little petulant gestures with which he
lent emphasis to his remarks. Hilda Bolsover had turned pale to the lips at the
sight of him as she entered the ballroom, but now they had danced two
consecutive dances, and the third they had sat out under the shadow of the
palms. There the colonel found them as he strolled round the room while the
dancers were forming up for the cotillon.</p>
<p>"Why, Hilda, this is one of your favourites," said he. "You are surely not
going to miss it?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Percy; but I am a little tired. May I introduce you to my old
friend, Captain Tresillian, of the Indian army! You may have heard me speak of
him. I have known him for ever so many years."</p>
<p>Colonel Bolsover held out his hand cordially, but the other swung round his
shoulder, and gazed vacantly across the ballroom as though he had heard
nothing. Then suddenly, with a half shrug, like a man who yields to his fate,
he turned and took the hand which was offered to him. The colonel glanced at
him in some surprise, for his manner was strange, his eyes wild, and his grasp
burned like that of a man in a fever.</p>
<p>"You have not been home long, I believe?"</p>
<p>"Got back last week in the Jumna."</p>
<p>"Had you been away long?"</p>
<p>"Only three years."</p>
<p>"Oh! Then you found little changed at home?"</p>
<p>Captain Tresillian burst into a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I find plenty of change at home. Plenty of change. Things are very
much altered."</p>
<p>His swarthy face had darkened, and his thin, dark hands were nervously
opening and shutting.</p>
<p>"I think, Percy," said Hilda Bolsover, "that the carriage will be waiting
now. Good night, Captain Tresillian. I am sure that we shall be happy to see
you at Melrose Lodge."</p>
<p>"Most certainly," cried the colonel. "Any friend of my wife's is a welcome
guest. When may we hope to see you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; I shall certainly call," the other answered, "I am very much
obliged to you. Good night."</p>
<p>"Do you know, Hilda," remarked the colonel, as they rattled homewards that
night in their brougham, "I notice something very strange in the manner of your
friend, Captain Tresillian. He struck me as a very nice fellow, you know, but
his talk and his look were just a little wild at times. I should think he has
had a touch of the sun in India."</p>
<p>"Very possibly. He has had some trouble, too, I believe."</p>
<p>"Ah, that might account for it. Well, we must try and make the place as
pleasant to him as we can."</p>
<p>Hilda said nothing, but she put her arms round her husband's neck and kissed
him.</p>
<p>The very next day and for many days after Captain Tresillian called at
Melrose Lodge. He walked with Hilda, he rode with her, he chatted with her in
the garden, and he escorted her out when the colonel was away at his duties. In
a week there was gossip about it in Birchespool: in a month it was the
notorious patent scandal of the town. Brother veterans sniggered about it,
women whispered, some pitied, some derided; but amid all the conflict of
opinions Bolsover alone seemed to be absolutely unconcerned. Once only Lady
Shipton ventured to approach the subject with him, but he checked her as firmly
as, if more gently than, he had his old friend in the days of his engagement.
"I have implicit faith in her," he said. "I know her better than anyone else
can do."</p>
<p>But there came a day when the colonel, too, found that he could no longer
disregard what was going on beneath his roof. He had come back late one
afternoon, and had found Captain Tresillian installed as usual in the
drawing-room, while his wife sat pouring out tea at the small table by the
fire. Their voices had sounded in brisk talk as he had entered, but this had
tailed off to mere constraint and formalities. Bolsover took his seat by the
window, thoughtfully stirring the cup of tea which his wife had handed to him,
and glancing from time to time at Tresillian. He noticed him draw his note-book
from his pocket, and scribble a few words upon a loose page. Then he saw him
rise with his empty cup, step over to the table with it, and hand both it and
the note to her. It was neatly done, but her fingers did not close upon it
quickly enough, and the little slip of white paper fluttered down to the
ground. Tresillian stooped for it, but Bolsover had taken a step forward, and
had snatched it from the carpet.</p>
<p>"A note for you, Hilda," said he quietly, handing it to her. His words were
gentle, but his mouth had set very grimly, and there was a dangerous glitter in
his eyes.</p>
<p>She took it in her hand and then held it out to him again. "Won't you read
it out to me?" said she.</p>
<p>He took it and hesitated for an instant. Then he threw it into the fire.
"Perhaps it is better unread," said he. "I think, Hilda, you had best step up
to your room."</p>
<p>There was something in his quiet, self-contained voice which dominated and
subdued her. He had an air and a manner which was new to her. She had never
seen the sterner side of his character. So he had looked and spoken on the
fierce day before the Delhi Gates, when the Sepoy bullets were hopping like
peas from the tires of his gun, and Nicholson's stormers were massing in the
trenches beneath him. She rose, shot a scared, half-reproachful glance at
Tresillian, and left the two men to themselves.</p>
<p>The colonel closed the door quickly behind her, and then turned to his
visitor.</p>
<p>"What have you to say?" he asked, sternly and abruptly.</p>
<p>"There was no harm in the note." Tresillian was leaning with his shoulder
against the mantelpiece, a sneering, defiant expression upon his dark, haggard
face.</p>
<p>"How dare you write a note surreptitiously to my wife? What had you to say
which might not be spoken out?"</p>
<p>"Well, really, you had the opportunity of reading it. You would have found
it perfectly innocent. Mrs. Bolsover, at any rate, was not in the least to
blame."</p>
<p>"I do not need your assurance on that point. It is in her name as much as in
my own that I ask you what you have to say."</p>
<p>"I have nothing to say, except that you should have read the note when you
had the chance."</p>
<p>"I am not in the habit of reading my wife's correspondence. I have implicit
confidence in her, but it is one of my duties to protect her from impertinence.
When I first joined the service there was a way by which I could have done so.
Now I can only say that I think you are a blackguard, and that I shall see that
you never again cross my threshold, or that of any other honest man in this
town, if I can help it."</p>
<p>"You show your good taste in insulting me when I am under your roof,"
sneered the other. "I have no wish to enter your house, and as to the other
thing you will find me very old-fashioned in my ideas if you should care to
propose anything of the kind. I wish you good-day."</p>
<p>He took up his hat and gloves from the piano, and walked to the door. There
he turned round with his hand upon the handle and faced Bolsover with a face
which was deeply lined with passion and with misery.</p>
<p>"You asked me once whether I found things different in England. I told you
that I did. Now I will tell you why. When I was in England last I loved a girl
and she loved me&mdash;she loved me, you understand. There was a secret
engagement between us. I was poor, with nothing but my pay, and she had been
accustomed to every luxury. It was to earn enough to be able to keep her that I
volunteered in India, that I worked for the Staff, that I saved and saved, and
lived as I believe no British officer ever lived in India yet. I had what I
thought was enough at last, and I came back with it. I was anxious, for I had
had no word from my girl. What did I find? That she had been bought by a man
twice my age&mdash;bought as you would buy&mdash;." He choked and put out a
hand to his throat before he could find his voice. "You complain&mdash;you pose
as being injured," he cried. "I call God to witness which has most reason to
cry out, you or I."</p>
<p>Colonel Bolsover turned and rang the bell. Before the servant could come,
however, his visitor was gone, and he heard the quick scrunch of his feet on
the gravel without. For a time he sat with his chin on his hands, lost in
thought. Then he rose and ascended to his wife's boudoir.</p>
<p>"I want to have a word with you, Hilda," said he, taking her hand, and
sitting down beside her on the settee. "Tell me truly now, are you happy with
me?"</p>
<p>"Why, Percy, what makes you ask?"</p>
<p>"Are you sorry that you married me? Do you regret it? Would you wish to be
free?"</p>
<p>"Ohl Percy, don't ask such questions."</p>
<p>"You never told me that there was anything between you and that man before
he went to India."</p>
<p>"It was quite informal. It was nothing&mdash;a mere friendship."</p>
<p>"He says an engagement."</p>
<p>"No, no; it was not quite that."</p>
<p>"You were fond of him?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I was fond of him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are so still?"</p>
<p>She turned away her face, and played with the jingling ornaments of her
chatelaine. Her husband waited for an answer, and a spasm of pain crossed his
face as no answer came.</p>
<p>"That will do," said he, gently disengaging his hand from hers. "At least
you are frank. I had hoped for too much. I was a fool. But all may yet be set
right. I shall not mar your life, Hilda, if I can help it."</p>
<p>The next day the authorities at the War office were surprised to receive a
strongly-worded letter from so distinguished an artillery officer as Percy
Bolsover, asking to be included in an expedition which was being fitted out in
the North-west of India, and which notoriously promised a great deal of danger
and very little credit. There was some delay in the answer, and before it
arrived the colonel had reached his end in another and a more direct
fashion.</p>
<p>No one will ever know how the fire broke out at Melrose Lodge. It may have
been the paraffin in the cellars, or it may have been the beams behind the
grate. Whatever the cause the colonel was wakened at two on a winter morning by
the choking, suffocating smell of burning wood, and rushing out of his bedroom
found that the stairs and all beneath him was already a sea of fire. Shouting
to his wife he dashed upstairs, and roused the frightened maids, who came
screaming, half-dressed, down into his bedroom.</p>
<p>"Come, Hilda," he cried, "we may manage the stairs."</p>
<p>They rushed down together as far as the first landing, but the fire spread
with terrible rapidity; the dry woodwork was blazing like tinder, and the swirl
of mingled smoke and flame drove them back into the bedroom. The colonel shut
the door, and rushed to the window. A crowd had already assembled in the road
and the garden, but there were no signs of the engines. A cry of horror and of
sympathy went up from the people as they saw the figures at the window, and
understood from the flames which were already bursting out from the lower floor
that their retreat was already cut off.</p>
<p>But the colonel was too old a soldier to be flurried by danger, or at a loss
for a plan. He opened the folding windows and dragging the feather-bed across
the floor he hurled it out.</p>
<p>"Hold it under the window," he cried. And a cheer from below showed that
they understood his meaning.</p>
<p>"It is not more than forty feet," said he, coolly. "You are not afraid,
Hilda?"</p>
<p>She was as calm as he was. "No, I am not afraid," she answered.</p>
<p>"I have a piece of rope here. It is not more than twenty feet, but the
feather bed will break the fall. We will pass the maids down first, Hilda.
Noblesse oblige!"</p>
<p>There was little time to spare, for the flames were crackling like pistol
shots at the further side of the door and shooting little red tongues through
the slits. The rope was slung round one maid, under her arms, and she was
instructed to slip out from it, and to fall when she had been lowered as far as
it would go. The first was unfortunate, for she fell obliquely, bounded from
the edge of the bed, and her screams told those above her of her mishap. The
second fell straight, and escaped with a shaking. There were only the husband
and wife now.</p>
<p>"Step back from the window, Hilda," said he. He kissed her on the forehead,
as a father might a child. "Good-bye, dear," he said. "Be happy."</p>
<p>"But you will come after me, Percy?"</p>
<p>"Or go before you," said he, with a quiet smile. "Now, dear, slip the rope
round you. May God watch over you and guard you!"</p>
<p>Very gently he lowered her down, leaning far over the window, that another
three feet might be taken from her fall. Bravely and coolly she eyed the bed
beneath her, put her feet together, and came down like an arrow into the centre
of it. A cheer from beneath told him that she was unhurt. At the same instant
there was a crash and a roar behind him, and a great yellow blast of flame
burst roaring into the room. The colonel stood framed in the open window,
looking down upon the crowd. He leaned with one shoulder against the stonework,
with the droop of the head of a man who is lost in thought. Behind him was a
lurid background of red flame, and a long venomous tongue came flickering out
over his head. A hundred voices screamed to him to jump. He straightened
himself up like a man who has taken his final resolution, glanced down at the
crowd, and then, turning, sprang back into the flames.</p>
<p>And that was the colonel's choice. It was "Accidental death" at the inquest,
and there was talk of the giddiness of suffocation and the slipping of feet;
but there was one woman at least who could tell how far a man who truly loves
will carry his self sacrifice.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>A SORDID AFFAIR</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>People,</i> 29 November 1891.</h3>
<hr>
<p>"My dear, what a perfectly charming bodice! I mean the Louis Quinze with the
vest of white chiffon de soie."</p>
<p>"Ah, but do look at that skirt of old rose silk, brocaded &agrave; la
Pompadour, and trimmed with duchesse lace!"</p>
<p>"But you know, Alice, my favourite of them all is that satin foulard, the
grey one, gouffred at the neck. It is so lovely, I think, and exactly my
measurements, for I went in and inquired."</p>
<p>"Then why not have it?"</p>
<p>"My dear! Fifteen guineas! It was dreadful. Now, if it had been ten I might
have managed it."</p>
<p>The speakers were two well-dressed ladies, standing in front of one of the
largest plate-glass windows in Bond Street, and gazing up at the dense group of
slim, headless figures in prim, straight-cut, tailor-made costumes, or in
evening dresses of the many strange neutral tints which were the rage of the
moment. They had raised their voices in their excitement, and gave little
clutches at each other's wrists as they compared notes about the treasures in
front of them. Close behind them stood a plainly-clad middle-aged woman with a
sad wrinkled face, and the air of one who has found the world anything but a
playground. She had stood gazing with a very critical eye at the various
costumes, and listening with a half smile to the comments of the ladies beside
her, but at their last remark she looked earnestly at the speaker, and put her
hand out timidly towards her to attract her attention.</p>
<p>"If you please, ma'am," she said, "I could do that for you."</p>
<p>The lady looked round in surprise. "What could you do, my good woman?"</p>
<p>"A dress the exact same as that one at every point for ten pounds."</p>
<p>"You could do it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am. You'll excuse my speaking to you, but I could not help hearing
what you said, and I know that I could give you satisfaction. I did all Madame
Davoust's work when she was court dressmaker."</p>
<p>The lady looked inquiringly at her companion. "What do you say, Louise?"</p>
<p>"Well, my dear, if you wish such a dress. You need not pay unless you are
satisfied with it."</p>
<p>"No, of course not. What is your name, please?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Raby."</p>
<p>"Well then, Mrs. Raby, you quite understand that I shall require the dress
to be absolutely as well finished as the one in the window, material and cut
identical."</p>
<p>"Yes, madam."</p>
<p>"And it must be ready by next Monday before ten o'clock."</p>
<p>"Very well, madam."</p>
<p>"And your price is ten pounds, inclusive."</p>
<p>"Ten pounds, madam."</p>
<p>"I have your solemn promise that the dress shall be the same, and that I
shall have it on Monday by ten?"</p>
<p>"I promise you, madam."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you may call this afternoon, and take your measurements. Mrs.
Clive is the name, 73, Palace Gardens." She gave a nod, and turned again to her
companion, while the dressmaker, with another very critical glance at the dress
in the window, hurried off upon her way.</p>
<p>A busy morning lay before her, for her foulard was to be purchased at one
shop, her linings at another, her braid and her buttons at yet another, all
down in the depths of the City, far away from West-end prices. At last, with
her arms full of brown paper parcels, she gained her 'bus, and drove out to
Brompton, where in a quiet side street of two-storeyed houses, a small brass
plate, "Mrs. Raby, costumier and dressmaker," showed where she carried on her
modest business.</p>
<p>In the front room an assistant was whirring away upon a hand sewing machine,
running a seam down the edge of a dress, while all round her lay heaped masses
of cloth, grey strips of lining, and rolls of braid.</p>
<p>"Whose is that, Anna?" asked Mrs. Raby.</p>
<p>"It is Mrs. Summerton's." The assistant was a broad-faced, good-humoured
girl, with red hair and freckles.</p>
<p>"Ah, you must be very careful with it. She is most particular. The front cut
straight, and the back gored and cut on the cross."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Raby. It's coming out fine."</p>
<p>"I have a new order, a foulard dress, which must be ready by Monday. This is
the stuff, and I shall have the measurements this evening. It will take us all
our time. Is Mr. Raby in?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he came in half an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>"In the back room."</p>
<p>Mrs. Raby closed the door, and went into the next apartment. A small man,
black bearded and swarthy, was seated at a side table, stooping over a box of
colours and a small oval piece of ivory, upon which he was beginning to paint a
background. He was a peaky, irritable-looking person, with sunken cheeks, a
nervous manner, and a very large piece of blue-ribbon in his button-hole.</p>
<p>"It is no use, Helen," he said. "I can't paint until I have an order."</p>
<p>"But however are you to get an order if you don't show folk what you can do.
Why don't you paint me, John, and hang me up in a case outside the door."</p>
<p>"I want something that will look nice and attractive," said he,
petulantly.</p>
<p>She laughed good-humouredly. "Paint me as you remember me when you first met
me, then," said she.</p>
<p>"Ah, you were different then."</p>
<p>"Well, if I am, you ought to know, John, what it is that has changed me. It
has not been an easy life for me these twenty years."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure I don't know what more I can do. I've taken the ribbon to
please you."</p>
<p>"Yes, John, dear, you've dropped the drink, and God bless you for it."</p>
<p>"Six months since I had a taste."</p>
<p>"And aren't you the better for it, in health and happiness and everything? I
always knew that if you were to get away from those other clerks you would be
all right. Now you are a clerk no longer. You're an artist."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I earned my money as a clerk, and I have made none as an artist. I
don't see that I am the gainer by the change."</p>
<p>"Ah, I'd rather starve, dear, and have you a sober man. Besides, I can earn
enough for both while you are gradually getting a few customers."</p>
<p>"Sitters!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sitters. But you must go to them or they will never come to you.
Why, look at me! I heard two ladies talking in the street, and by pushing
myself in I got a ten-pound job."</p>
<p>"Did you, though."</p>
<p>"Yes, this very morning. My stuff will cost from five to six, but there
should be four pound profit." She took a key from her pocket, unlocked a drawer
in a side table, and taking a tin box out unlocked that also.</p>
<p>"We have fifteen pounds here," said she, turning out a small heap of gold.
"We'll make it twenty soon, and then I think I may afford to take on another
assistant."</p>
<p>Her husband looked wistfully at the gold. "It seems hard that you should put
away all that money, and I should go about without a half-crown in my pocket,"
said he.</p>
<p>"I don't want your pocket to be empty, John, but you don't need more than
sixpence. It is only putting yourself in the way of temptation."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, I ought to be head in my own family. Why don't you give me
the key, and let me have the keeping of the money."</p>
<p>"No, no, John; it is my earning and I'll have the keeping. What you want
I'll buy for you, but what I save I must have in my own hands."</p>
<p>"A pretty thing, too!" He went back to his painting with a snarl, while she
very carefully locked up her small treasure again, and then returned to the
work-room. She had hardly turned her back when he sprang from his seat, rushed
to the table and took two wicked little tugs at the drawer, but all was fast,
so he slunk back, cursing under his breath, to his paints and his ivory.</p>
<p>That afternoon Mrs. Raby called at Palace Gardens, obtained her
measurements, and forthwith got to work with might and main upon the dress. It
was a Thursday, and she had only two and a half working days before her, but
she had given her promise, and she was a woman who would keep her word, if
flesh and blood could do it. On Saturday morning it must be ready for the
trying on, and on the Monday by ten o'clock it must be actually delivered. So
away she went cutting, and stitching, gouffring, and tabbing, and looping, and
hemming, working late, and working early, until on the second day a dozen
separate pieces were all brought together like a child's puzzle, a square
there, a triangle here, a long narrow slip down the front, and there, out of
what to a masculine eye would have seemed the merest scraps, there rose the
daintiest, neatest little dress that heart could wish, still loosely pinned
together, but taking already its ultimate outlines. In this state it was
carried to Palace Gardens, tried on, and then brought back to be finally
completed. By twelve o'clock at night it was finished, and all Sunday it stood
upon the frame in the workroom looking so fresh and neat and perfect, that the
wife, in the pride of her heart, could not forbear from running in every hour
or so, and coaxing her husband in with her, to look and to admire.</p>
<p>He had been a sorry helpmate to her. It was not work which had placed those
marks of care upon his face. As a clerk in the wholesale cocoa firm, he had for
years been having some three pounds a week, but of the three it was seldom that
one found its way to his wife, who planned, and worked, and managed as only a
devoted woman can. At last she had herself turned to business, and had made
herself independent of him, or, rather, had made him dependent upon her. A long
course of secret drunkenness had ended in a raging attack of delirium tremens,
which could not be concealed from his employers, and which brought about his
instant dismissal from his situation. But it was no misfortune in the eyes of
his wife. She had long made up her mind that his weak nature was not to be
reformed while he was surrounded by temptation. Now, at last, she had him to
herself. Some occupation must be found for him which would hold him within her
influence. It was always with others that she laid the blame, never with him,
for her eyes were blind to the shattered irritable wreck, and could only see
the dark-haired bashful lad who had told her twenty years ago how he loved her.
Could she keep out those evil influences, all would yet be well. Her woman's
wit was set to do it. He had long had some leanings towards art, so now she
bought him paints and paper and all that an artist could require. She had
prayed and argued until he had taken the blue ribbon, and for six whole months
she had stood between him and danger, shutting off what was evil, encouraging
the little that was good, like some tender gardener watching over a sickly
plant. And now at last all seemed bright before her. Her husband had forsworn
his fatal habits. She had saved a little money, and there was a prospect of
saving more. Soon she might hope for a second assistant, and even spend a few
pounds in advertisements. As she went into her work-room for the last time that
Sunday night, holding out the lamp in her work-worn hand, and looked at the
delicate tint and dainty curves, it seemed to her that the long struggle was at
last drawing to an end, and that the evening would be mellow if the day had
been stormy.</p>
<p>She slept heavily that night, for she had worked almost continuously until
the dress was finished. It was nearly eight o'clock when she woke. Her husband
was not lying by her side. His clothes and boots were gone. She smiled to think
how completely she had overslept herself, and, rising, she dressed, hurriedly
putting on her outdoor things so that she might be ready to start immediately
after breakfast to keep her appointment. As she descended the stair she noticed
that the work-room door was open. She entered with a sudden strange sinking at
the heart. The new dress had disappeared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Raby sat down on a packing case, and sank her face in her hands. The
blow was so sudden, so unexpected! But she was a practical woman, and there was
no use in sitting groaning. She walked through the house. Her husband, as she
expected, was nowhere to be seen. Then she wrote a short note to the assistant,
left it on the workroom table, and leaving the door upon the latch, set out
upon her hopeless and piteous chase.</p>
<p>Just round the corner, in the Brompton Road, was a pawnbroker's shop, and
into it she hastened. A heavy, red-bearded man, who was reading the morning
paper in the corner, cocked his eye at her as she entered.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, ma'am?"</p>
<p>"Would you kindly tell me, sir, if any one has been here this morning to
pledge a grey dress?"</p>
<p>The pawnbroker called to his assistant, a young, pasty-faced man, who
emerged from among the countless suits of clothes and piles of miscellaneous
things which blocked the shop.</p>
<p>"There was some one here with a grey dress, Alec, was there not?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir! that was the one that you thought might be a police matter."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, of course. A small, dark man, with black hair?"</p>
<p>"That's it, sir."</p>
<p>"He was here at quarter-past seven, just after opening time. I wasn't down
yet, but my assistant told me that the dress was a very good and new one, and
that the man's manner was just a bit suspicious."</p>
<p>"You didn't take it, then?"</p>
<p>"You don't know where he went?"</p>
<p>"No idea."</p>
<p>The red-bearded man plunged back into his morning paper, and the woman
hurried on upon her quest. Should she turn up the street or down. The sight of
a distant glimmer of gilt balls decided her, and she found herself in another
office. They had seen nothing there either of her husband or of the dress.</p>
<p>She paused irresolute outside the door. Then she reflected that if her
husband had come up the road he would certainly have come there. He must have
turned down then. She entered the first pawnbroker's in that direction, and
there was the grey foulard dress hanging up upon a hook right in front of her.
She gave a cry ofjoy at the sight of it. It was not yet nine, and there was
time to keep her appointment.</p>
<p>"That's my dress," she gasped.</p>
<p>The pawnbroker gazed at her curiously. "It was pawned this morning, ma'am,
by a small, dark man."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, that was my husband. How much did he get on it?"</p>
<p>"Three pound, five."</p>
<p>She had put some money into her pocket when she left home. Now she laid four
sovereigns upon the counter.</p>
<p>"Please let me have it at once."</p>
<p>"Where's the ticket?"</p>
<p>"The ticket? I have none."</p>
<p>"Then you can't have the dress."</p>
<p>"But it is my dress, and here is the money. Why can I not have it?"</p>
<p>"I am very sorry for you, marm. But we must stick to the law. Suppose I take
your money and give you your dress, and suppose then your husband comes here
with the ticket and demands his pledge, what could I say to him? He could put
his own price on it, and I should have to pay him."</p>
<p>"But I promise you he won't come. Do, do, let me have the dress. I've
promised it to a customer at ten."</p>
<p>"I tell you that I can't, and there's an end of it," said the pawnbroker,
turning upon his heel.</p>
<p>It was heartbreaking to be within touch of it, and not to be allowed to take
it. And yet she could not blame the pawnbroker. She could see that he could not
act otherwise. What remained then? To find her husband. But how could she tell
in which of a hundred public-houses he was making amends for his long
abstention. She paced wildly up and down the pavement. What would this lady
think of her? She had given a promise, and a promise had always been a sacred
thing with her. Was there no way in which she could manage? And then suddenly
an idea came to her, and she ran as hard as she could back to her own house,
rushed into the back room, opened her drawer, poured her little heap of savings
into her purse, and hastened out to catch an eastward bound 'bus.</p>
<p>At Bond Street she got out and sped on to the window where she had first
undertaken this unhappy contract. Thank God, the dress was still unsold in the
window. She remembered that the lady had said that the measurements were
correct. In five minutes more her whole savings had gone into the till of the
wealthy retail firm, and she, with her great cardboard-box was driving at the
top of her speed to Palace Gardens.</p>
<p>"My dear Alice," remarked her friend, who had dropped in early that morning,
in order to criticise the costume, "you see it never does to trust people in
that class of life. She said ten o'clock, and now it is five minutes past. They
have no idea of the nature of a promise."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not. Still, she is sure to come, for I have not paid her
anything yet. Ah, here she is coming up the stair, so she is not so very late
after all."</p>
<p>The dress was duly unpacked, and Mrs. Alice Clive put it on at once, while
her friend and the dressmaker walked slowly round her with sidelong heads,
eyeing it up and down.</p>
<p>"Well, dear, how do you like it. It feels very comfortable and seems to sit
well about the shoulders."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I think it will do. I don't think, however, that the foulard is
quite of the same quality as that which we saw in the shop."</p>
<p>"I assure you, madam, that it is."</p>
<p>"Well, Mrs. Raby, I am sure you will acknowledge that the lace is
inferior."</p>
<p>"No, it is precisely the same."</p>
<p>The lady critic shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>"At least, there is no question as to the inferiority of the cut," said she,
"I cannot refuse to believe my own eyes."</p>
<p>"Well, at least, it is not dear at that price," said her friend.</p>
<p>"It is entirely a matter of taste," the other rejoined, "but I confess that
I would rather pay fifteen guineas for the other than ten for this."</p>
<p>"Well, well, on the whole I am pretty well satisfied," said she, Mrs. Clive,
and paid over the ten pounds to the silent weary woman who stood before
her.</p>
<p>But strange and wondrous are the ways of women, and where is the man who
shall grasp them. As she walked home, tired, footsore, the loser in time and in
money, with all her little hopes shattered to ruins, and all to be built up
once more, she saw a crowd of jeering boys at the corner of the Brompton Road,
and peeping over their shoulders, she caught a glimpse of a horrid crawling
figure, a hatless head, and a dull, vacant, leering face. In an instant she had
called a cab.</p>
<p>"It is my husband," said she, "he is ill. Help me to get him into the cab,
policeman. We live quite close to here."</p>
<p>They thrust him into a four-wheeler, and she got in beside him, holding him
up with her arms. His coat was covered with dust, and he mumbled and chuckled
like an ape. As the cab drove on, she drew his head down upon her bosom,
pushing back his straggling hair, and crooned over him like a mother over a
baby.</p>
<p>"Did they make fun of him, then?" she cried. "Did they call him names? He'll
come home with his little wifey, and he'll never be a naughty boy again."</p>
<p>Oh, blind, angelic, foolish love of woman! Why should men demand a miracle
while you remain upon earth?</p>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>A REGIMENTAL SCANDAL</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Indianapolis Journal,</i> 14 May 1892.</h3>
<hr>
<p>It was a very painful business. I don't think any of us have forgotten it or
are at all likely to. The morality of the third Carabiniers was as loose as
their discipline was tight, and if a man rode straight and was keen on
soldiering he might work out his private record to his own mind. But still
there is a limit to what even such a thoroughgoing old sportsman as the Colonel
could stand, and that limit was passed on the instant that there was a breath
of suspicion about fair play at the card table.</p>
<p>Take the mess. They had ridden through the Decalogue as gaily as through
Arabi's guns at Kassassin. Professionally they had made free with other men's
lives. But the unwritten laws of honour lay unbroken amid the shattered
commandments. They were short and sharp, and woe to the man who transgressed
them. Sporting debts must be paid. There was no such thing as a white feather.
Above all, a man must play fair. It was a simple code of ethics, but it
commanded an absolute obedience which might have been refused to a more
elaborate system.</p>
<p>If there was one man in the mess who could be held up by the youngsters as
the embodiment of honour it was Major Errington. He was older than the chief,
and having served twice as a volunteer war correspondent and once as a military
attach&eacute;, he had been shot over by Berdan's and Manuffcher repeaters,
which seemed to us a much more gaudy thing than Jezails or even Egyptian
Remingtons. We had all done Egypt and we had all done the Soudan, but when he
would begin his modest after-mess anecdote with: "I remember when Gourko
crossed the Balkans," or "I was riding beside the Red Prince's staff just two
days before Gravelotte," we would feel quite ashamed of our poor "Puzzles" and
"Pathans," and yearn to replace the foreign office by a committee of subalterns
of the Carabiniers, all pledged to a spirited policy.</p>
<p>Then our Major was so humble and gentle with it all. That was his only fault
as a soldier. He could fight&mdash;none better&mdash;but he could not be stern.
No matter how heinous the crime of the defaulter who was brought before him,
and no matter how resolutely he might purse up his features into a frown, there
was still something so very human always gleaming from his eyes that the most
drunken deserter could not but feel that this, instead of being a commanding
officer, was merely a man and a brother. Though far the richest man in the
regiment, for he had ample private means, he lived always in the simplest
fashion. Some even set him down as parsimonious, and blamed him for it. But
most of us saw in it only another example of the Major's delicacy which made
him fear to make others feel poor by showing himself rich. It was no wonder
that he was popular. We subalterns worshipped him, and it was to him that we
brought all those tiffs and bickerings and misunderstandings which need a
little gentle wisdom to set them right. He would sit patiently, with his
cheroot reeking from the corner of his mouth and his eyes fixed upon the
ceiling, listening to our details, and then would come the quick, "I think that
you ought to withdraw the expression, Jones," or "Under the circumstances, you
were quite justified, Hall," which settled the matter forever. If we had been
told that the chief had burgled the regimental plate or that the chaplain had
invited the secularist Sergeant Major to tea, we should have been less
astonished than at the rumour that Major Errington had been guilty of anything
which was dishonourable.</p>
<p>It came about in this way. The chief was a born plunger. Horses, cards,
dice&mdash;they were all the same to him. He would bet on, or he would bet
against, give the odds or take them, but bet he would. It was all very well as
long as he stuck to shilling points and half-crown rubs at whist, or made his
little book upon the regimental cup; but when he took to American railway
scrip, and laid out all his savings on seven per cent bonds which were selling
at sixty-two, he started a game where the odds are all on the bank and the
dealer sits somewhere near Wall Street. It was no use telling the old man that
Monte Carlo was a sound family investment in comparison. He held on grimly
until the inevitable came round. The line was squelched by a big capitalist,
who wished to buy it, and our chief was left on the very edge of the bankruptcy
court, uncertain from week to week how long it might be before he would need to
send in his papers. He said nothing, for he was as proud as Lucifer, but he
looked bleary about the eyes in the morning, and his tunic did not fit him
quite as tight as it used to. Of course, we were very sorry for the poor old
chief, but we were sorrier still for his daughter Violet. We were all in love
with Violet Lovell, and her grief was a blight to the regiment. She wasn't such
a very pretty girl, either, but she was fresh and bright and sprightly as an
English spring, and so sweet, and good, and sympathetic, that she was just the
type of womanhood for all of us. She was one of those girls about whom when
once you come to know them, you never think whether they are pretty or not. You
only know that it is pleasant to be near them, to see their happy faces, to
hear their voices, and to have life made sweeter and more beautiful by their
presence. That was how we all felt toward Violet&mdash;from the old Major to
the newly-joined subaltern, with a brand new razor case upon his dressing
table. So when that bright face clouded over as the shadow of her father's
troubles fell upon it, we clouded over also, and the mess of the Carabiniers
sank into a state from which even the caterer's Deutz and Guelderman of '81 was
unable to redeem it.</p>
<p>The Major was the most stricken of all. I think that he took the whole
matter to heart even more than the Colonel did, although it had been against
his strenuous advice that those cursed bonds had been bought. He was an old
friend of the chief and he knew that the disgrace of bankruptcy would be the
old man's death blow; but he was fonder still of the chiefs daughter&mdash;none
of us ever knew how much so, for he was a shy, silent man, and, in his English
fashion, he hid away his emotions as though they were shameful vices. Yet, with
all his care, we got a little peep into his heart, if only through his grey
eyes when he looked at her, and we knew that he was very fond of our
Violet.</p>
<p>The chief used to go to his own room after mess, and whoever wished was
welcome to follow him there. Major Errington always went, and the two would
play &eacute;carte by the hour, while we others either made a four at whist, or
smoked and looked on. It was worth looking at too. The chief was a fine
&eacute;carte player, and they were doing all they knew, for they had taken to
playing high points. Of course, the chief, bankruptcy or no, was always ready
to plank down whatever he had in his pocket upon the turn of a card. But it was
something new in Errington. There had been a time when he had refused to play
for money at all. Now he closed at once with every challenge, and even seemed
to goad his opponent on to higher stakes still. And he played with the air of a
man who was anxious about the game&mdash;too anxious to be quite good form,
considering that there was money upon the table. He was flustered and unlike
himself, and more than once he misplayed the cards completely; but still luck
was absolutely in his favour and he won. It went against us to see the old man,
who had been so hard hit, losing the money which he needed badly to the richest
man in the regiment; but still the Major was the soul of honour, and if he did
it there must be some very good reason behind it all.</p>
<p>But there was one of our subalterns who was not so sure about that. Second
Lieutenant Peterkin was young and small and newly joined, but he was as keen as
a razor edge, with the wits of a racing tout of 50 crammed into a boy's body.
He had made a book himself at 9, ridden a winner at 10 and owned one at 13, so
that by the time he came our way he was as blas&eacute; and shrewd and knowing
as any man in the corps. But he had pluck and he was good humoured, so we all
got along with him pretty well until he breathed that first word of suspicion
against the Major.</p>
<p>It was in the billiard-room one morning and there were six of us there, all
subalterns except Austen, who was the junior captain. Austen and Peterkin were
knocking the balls about and we others were helping them by sitting on the
corner pockets. Suddenly Austen chucked down his cue with a clatter into the
corner.</p>
<p>"You're a damned little liar, Peterkin," he remarked.</p>
<p>This was interesting, as we had not listened to the context. We came off our
perches and stared. Peterkin took up the chalk and gently rubbed the tip of his
cue.</p>
<p>"You'll be sorry for having said that, Captain Austen," said he. "Shall
I?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and you'll apologise to me for it."</p>
<p>"Oh indeed!"</p>
<p>"All I ask is that you test the matter for yourself tonight, and that
tomorrow we all meet here again at this hour, and that you let these gentlemen
know what you think then."</p>
<p>"They have nothing to do with it."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Captain Austen, they have everything to do with it. You used an
expression to me a few moments ago in their presence, and you must withdraw it
in their presence also. I shall tell them what the matter was about, and
then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not a word!" cried Austen, angrily. "Don't dare to repeat such a
libel!"</p>
<p>"Just as you like, but in that case you must agree to my conditions."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll do it. I'll watch tonight, and I'll meet you here tomorrow; but
I warn you, young Peterkin, that when I have shown up this mare's nest of yours
the regiment will be too hot to hold you!" He stalked out of the room in a
passion, while Peterkin chuckled to himself and began to practise the spot
stroke, deaf to our questions as to what was the matter.</p>
<p>We were all there to keep our appointment next day. Peterkin had nothing to
say, but there was a twinkle in his little, sharp eyes, especially when Austen
came in with a very crestfallen expression upon his face.</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "If I hadn't seen with my own eyes I should never have
believed it, never! Peterkin, I withdraw what I said yesterday. You were right.
By God, to think that an officer of this regiment should stoop so low!"</p>
<p>"It's a bad business," said Peterkin. "It was only by chance I noticed
it."</p>
<p>"It's a good thing you did. We must have a public exposure."</p>
<p>"If it's a matter affecting the honour of any fellow of the mess it would
surely be best to have Major Errington's opinion," said Hartridge.</p>
<p>Austen laughed bitterly. "You fellows may as well be told," said he.
"There's no use in any mystification. Major Errington has, as you may know,
been playing high stakes at &eacute;carte with the chief. He has been seen, on
two evenings in succession, first by Peterkin and then by me, to hide cards and
so strengthen his hand after dealing. Yes, yes, you may say what you like, but
I tell you that I saw it with my own eyes. You know how short-sighted the chief
is. Errington did it in the most barefaced way, when he thought no one was
looking. I shall speak to the chief about it. I consider it to be my duty."</p>
<p>"You had better all come to-night," said Peterkin, "but don't sit near the
table, or pretend to be watching. Six witnesses will surely be enough to settle
it."</p>
<p>"Sixty wouldn't make me believe it," said Hartridge.</p>
<p>Austen shrugged his shoulders. "Well, you must believe your own eyes, I
suppose. It's an awkward thing for a few subalterns to bring such a serious
charge against a senior major of twenty years' service. But the chief shall be
warned, and he may take such steps as he thinks best. It's been going on too
long, and to-night should finish it for good and all."</p>
<p>So that night we were all in the Colonel's room, when the card table was
pushed forward and the two seniors sat down to their &eacute;carte as usual. We
others sat round the fire with a keen <i>eye</i> on the players. The Colonel's
face was about two shades redder than usual, and his stiff hair bristled up, as
it would when he was angry. Austen, too, looked ruffled. It was clear that he
had told the chief, and that the chief had not taken it very sweetly.</p>
<p>"What points?" asked the Major.</p>
<p>"Pound a game, as before."</p>
<p>"Pound a trick, if you like," suggested the Major.</p>
<p>"Very good. A pound a trick." The chief put on his pince-nez and shot a keen
questioning glance at his antagonist. The Major shuffled and pushed the cards
over to be cut.</p>
<p>The first three games were fairly even. The Major held the better cards, but
the chief played far the finer game. The fourth game and deal had come round to
the Major again, and as he laid the pack down he spread his elbows out so as to
screen his hands from me. Austen gave his neighbour a nudge and we all craned
our necks. A hand whisked over the pack and Peterkin smiled.</p>
<p>The chief played a knave and the Major took it with a queen. As he put
forward his hand to pick up the trick the Colonel sprang suddenly out of his
chair with an oath.</p>
<p>"Lift up your sleeve, sir," he cried. "By&mdash;, you have a card under
it!"</p>
<p>The Major had sprung up also, and his chair toppled backward onto the floor.
We were all on our feet, but neither of the men had a thought for us. The
Colonel leaned forward with his thick red finger upon a card which lay face
downward upon the table. The Major stood perfectly composed, but a trifle paler
than usual.</p>
<p>"I observe that there was a card there, sir," said he, "but surely you do
not mean to insinuate that&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Colonel threw his hand down upon the table.</p>
<p>"It's not the first time," said he.</p>
<p>"Do you imagine that I would take an unfair advantage of you?"</p>
<p>"Why, I saw you slip the card from the pack&mdash;saw it with my own
eyes."</p>
<p>"You should have known me better after twenty years," said Major Errington,
gently. "I say sir, that you should have known me better, and that you should
have been less ready to come to such a conclusion. I have the honour to wish
you good evening, sir." He bowed very gravely and coldly and walked from the
room.</p>
<p>But he had hardly closed the door when the curtains at the other end, which
separated the card room from the little recess where Miss Lovell was pouring
out our coffee, were opened, and she stepped through. She had not a thought for
any of us, but walked straight up to her father.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help hearing you, Dad," said she. "I am sure that you have done
him a cruel injustice."</p>
<p>"I have done him no injustice. Captain Austen, you were watching. You will
bear me out."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I saw the whole affair. I not only saw the card taken, but I saw
which it was that he discarded from his hand. It was this one." He leaned
forward and turned up the top card.</p>
<p>"That one!" shouted the chief; "why that is the king of trumps."</p>
<p>"So it is."</p>
<p>"But who in his senses would discard the king of trumps; what did he
exchange?" He turned up the card on the table. It was an eight. He whistled and
passed his fingers through his hair.</p>
<p>"He weakened his hand," said he. "What was the meaning of that?"</p>
<p>"The meaning is that he was trying to lose, Dad."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir, now that I come to think of it, I am convinced that Miss
Lovell is perfectly correct," said Captain Austen. "That would explain why he
suggested high points, why he played such a vile game, and why, when he found
that he had such good cards in his hand that he could not help winning, he
thought himself justified in getting rid of some of them. For some reason or
other he was trying to lose."</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" groaned the Colonel, "what can I say to put matters straight?"
and he made for the door.</p>
<p>And so our little card scandal in the Carabiniers was brought to an
honourable ending, for all came out as it had been surmised. Ever since the
Colonel's financial misfortunes his comrade's one thought had been to convey
help to him, but finding it absolutely impossible to do it directly he had
tried it by means of the card table. Finding his efforts continually foiled by
the run of good cards in his hands he had broken our usual calm by his clumsy
attempts to weaken himself. However, American railway bonds are up to 87 now,
owing to the providential death of the American millionaire, and the Colonel is
no longer in need of any man's help. The Major soon forgave him for his
mistake, and for a time hoped that Violet would have been the pledge of
reconciliation&mdash;and no match would have been more popular in the
regiment&mdash;but she destroyed the symmetry of things by marrying a young
Madras Staff Corps man, home on leave, so our senior major is still a bachelor,
and likely to remain so.</p>

A STORY OF AN OLD OFFENDER</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Chambers's Journal</i>, Jan 19, 1895<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>"WHO can he be?" thought I, as I watched my companion in the second-class
carriage of the London and Dover Railway.</p>
<p>I had been so full of the fact that my long-expected holiday had come at
last, and that for a few days, at least, the gayeties of Paris were about to
supersede the dull routine of the hospital wards, that we were well out of
London before I observed that I was not alone in the compartment. In these days
we have all pretty well agreed that "three is company and two is none" upon the
railway. At the time I write of, however, people were not so morbidly sensitive
about their travelling companions. It was rather an agreeable surprise to me to
find that there was some chance of whiling away the hours of a tedious journey.
I therefore pulled my cap down over my eyes, took a good look from beneath it
at my vis-&agrave;-vis, and repeated to myself: "Who can he be?"</p>
<p>I used rather to pride myself on being able to spot a man's trade or
profession by a good look at his exterior. I had the advantage of studying
under a master of the art, who used to electrify both his patients and his
clinical classes by long shots, sometimes at the most unlikely of pursuits; and
never very far from the mark.</p>
<p>"Well, my man," I have heard him say, "I can see by your fingers that you
play some musical instrument for your livelihood, but it is a rather curious
one; something quite out of my line." The man afterwards informed us that he
earned a few coppers by blowing "Rule Britannia" on a coffee-pot, the spout of
which was pierced to form a rough flute. Though a novice in the art, I was
still able to astonish my ward companions on occasion, and I never lost an
opportunity of practising. It was not mere curiosity, then, which led me to
lean back on the cushions and analyze the quiet middle-aged man in front of
me.</p>
<p>I used to do the thing systematically, and my train of reflections ran
somewhat in this wise: "General appearance, vulgar; fairly opulent and
extremely self-possessed; looks like a man who could out-chaff a bargee, and
yet be at his ease in middle-class society. Eyes well set together and nose
rather prominent; would be a good long-range marksman. Cheeks flabby, but the
softness of expression redeemed by a square-cut jaw and a well-set lower lip.
On the whole, a powerful type. Now for the hands&mdash;rather disappointed
there. Thought he was a self-made man by the look of him, but there is no
callous in the palm and no thickness at the joints. Has never been engaged in
any real physical work, I should think. No tanning on the backs of the hands;
on the contrary, they are very white, with blue projecting veins and long,
delicate fingers. Couldn't be an artist with that face, and yet he has the
hands of a man engaged in delicate manipulations. No red acid spots upon his
clothes, no ink stains, no nitrate of silver marks upon the hands (this helps
to negative my half-formed opinion that he was a photographer). Clothes not
worn in any particular part. Coat made of tweed, and fairly old; but the left
elbow, as far as I can see it, has as much of the fluff left on as the right,
which is seldom the case with men who do much writing. Might be a commercial
traveller, but the little pocketbook in the waistcoat is wanting, nor has he
any of those handy valises suggestive of samples."</p>
<p>I give these brief headings of my ideas merely to demonstrate my method of
arriving at a conclusion. As yet I had obtained nothing but negative results;
but now, to use a chemical metaphor, I was in a position to pour off this
solution of dissolved possibilities and examine the residue. I found myself
reduced to a very limited number of occupations. He was neither a lawyer nor a
clergyman, in spite of a soft felt hat, and a somewhat clerical cut about the
necktie. I was wavering now between pawnbroker and horsedealer; but there was
too much character about his face for the former, and he lacked that
extraordinary equine atmosphere which hangs about the latter even in his hours
of relaxation; so I formed a provisional diagnosis of betting man of
methodistical persuasions, the latter clause being inserted in deference to his
hat and necktie.</p>
<p>Pray, do not think that I reasoned it out like this in my own mind. It is
only now, sitting down with pen and paper, that I can see the successive steps.
As it was, I had formed my conclusion within sixty seconds of the time when I
drew my hat down over my eyes and uttered the mental ejaculation with which my
narrative begins.</p>
<p>I did not feel quite satisfied even then with my deduction. However, as a
leading question would&mdash;to pursue my chemical analogy&mdash;act as my
litmus paper, I determined to try one. There was a "Times" lying by my
companion, and I thought the opportunity too good to be neglected.</p>
<p>"Do you mind my looking at your paper? " I asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir, certainly," said he most urbanely, handing it across.</p>
<p>I glanced down its columns until my eye rested upon the list of the latest
betting. "Hullo!" I said, "they are laying odds upon the favorite for the
Cambridgeshire. But perhaps," I added, looking up, "you are not interested in
these matters?"</p>
<p>"Snares, sir!" said he violently; "wiles of the enemy! Mortals are but given
a few years to live; how can they squander them so? They have not even an eye
to their poor worldly interests," he added in a quieter tone, "or they would
never back a single horse at such short odds with a field of thirty."</p>
<p>There was something in this speech of his which tickled me immensely. I
suppose it was the odd way in which he blended religious intolerance with
worldly wisdom. I laid the "Times" aside with the conviction that I should be
able to spend the next two hours to better purpose than in its perusal.</p>
<p>"You speak as if you understood the matter, at any rate," I remarked.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," he answered; "few men in England understood these things better
in the old days before I changed my profession. But that is all over now."</p>
<p>"Changed your profession?" said I, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Yes; I changed my name, too."</p>
<p>"Indeed?" said I.</p>
<p>"Yes; you see, a man wants a real fresh start when his eyes become opened,
so he has a new deal all round, so to speak. Then he gets a fair chance."</p>
<p>There was a short pause here, as I seemed to be on delicate ground in
touching on my companion's antecedents, and he did not volunteer any
information. I broke the silence by offering him a cheroot.</p>
<p>"No, thanks," said he; "I have given up tobacco. It was the hardest wrench
of all, was that. It does me good to smell the whiff of your weed. Tell me," he
added suddenly, looking hard at me with his shrewd gray eyes, "why did you take
stock of me so carefully before you spoke?"</p>
<p>"It is a habit of mine," said I. "I am a medical man, and observation is
everything in my profession. I had no idea you were looking."</p>
<p>"I can see without looking," he answered. "I thought you were a detective,
at first; but I couldn't recall your face at the time I knew the force."</p>
<p>"Were you a detective, then?" said I.</p>
<p>"No," he answered, with a laugh; "I was the other thing&mdash;the detected,
you know. Old scores are wiped out now, and the law cannot touch me; so I don't
mind confessing to a gentleman like yourself what a scoundrel I have been in my
time."</p>
<p>"We are none of us perfect," said I.</p>
<p>"No; but I was a real out-and-outer. A 'fake,' you know, to start with, and
afterwards a 'cracksman.' It is easy to talk of these things now, for I've
changed my spirit. It's as if I was talking of some other man, you see."</p>
<p>"Exactly so," said I. Being a medical man, I had none of that shrinking from
crime and criminals which many men possess. I could make all allowances for
congenital influence and the force of circumstances. No company, therefore,
could have been more acceptable to me than that of the old malefactor; and as I
sat puffing at my cigar, I was delighted to observe that my air of interest was
gradually loosening his tongue.</p>
<p>"Yes; I'm converted now," he continued, "and of course I am a happier man
for that. And yet," he added wistfully, "there are times when I long for the
old trade again, and fancy myself strolling out on a cloudy night with my jimmy
in my pocket. I left a name behind me in my profession, sir. I was one of the
old school, you know. It was very seldom that we bungled a job. We used to
begin at the foot of the ladder, the rope ladder, if I may say so, in my
younger days, and then work our way up, step by step, so that we were what you
might call good men all through."</p>
<p>"I see," said I.</p>
<p>"I was always reckoned a hard-working, conscientious man, and had talent,
too; the very cleverest of them allowed that. I began as a blacksmith, and then
did a little engineering and carpentering, and then I took to sleight-of-hand
tricks, and then to picking pockets. I remember, when I was home on a visit,
how my poor old father used to wonder why I was always hovering around him. He
little knew that I used to clear everything out of his pockets a dozen times a
day, and then replace them, just to keep my hand in. He believes to this day
that I am in an office in the City. There are few of them could touch me in
that particular line of business, though."</p>
<p>"I suppose it is a matter of practice?" I remarked.</p>
<p>"To a great extent. Still, a man never quite loses it, if he has once been
an adept&mdash;excuse me; you have dropped some cigar ash on your coat," and he
waved his hand politely in front of my breast, as if to brush it off. "There,"
he said, handing me my gold scarf pin, "you see I have not forgot my old
cunning yet."</p>
<p>He had done it so quickly that I hardly saw the hand whisk over my bosom,
nor did I feel his fingers touch me, and yet there was the pin glittering in
his hand. "It is wonderful," I said as I fixed it again in its place.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing! But I have been in some really smart jobs. I was in the
gang that picked the new patent safe. You remember the case. It was guaranteed
to resist anything; and we managed to open the first that was ever issued,
within a week of its appearance. It was done with graduated wedges, sir, the
first so small that you could hardly see it against the light, and the last
strong enough to prize it open. It was a clever managed affair."</p>
<p>"I remember it," said I. " But surely some one was convicted for that? "</p>
<p>"Yes, one was nabbed. But he didn't split, nor even let on how it was done.
We'd have cut his soul out if&mdash;" He suddenly damped down the very ugly
fires which were peeping from his eyes. "Perhaps I am boring you, talking about
these old wicked days of mine? "</p>
<p>"On the contrary," I said, "you interest me extremely."</p>
<p>"I like to get a listener I can trust. It's a sort of blow-off, you know,
and I feel lighter after it. When I am among my brethren I dare hardly think of
what has gone before. Now I'll tell you about another job I was in. To this
day, I cannot think about it without laughing." I lit another cigar, and
composed myself to listen.</p>
<p>"It was when I was a youngster," said he. "There was a big City man in those
days who was known to have a very valuable gold watch. I followed him about for
several days before I could get a chance; but when I did get one, you may be
sure I did not throw it away. He found, to his disgust, when he got home that
day, that there was nothing in his fob. I hurried off with my prize, and got it
stowed away in safety, intending to have it melted down next day. Now, it
happened that this watch possessed a special value in the owner's eyes because
it was a sort of ancestral possession&mdash;presented by his father on coming
of age, or something of that sort. I remember there was a long inscription on
the back. He was determined not to lose it if he could help it, and accordingly
he put an advertisement in an evening paper, offering thirty pounds reward for
its return, and promising that no questions should be asked. He gave the
address of his house, 31 Caroline Square, at the end of the advertisement. The
thing sounded good enough, so I set off for Caroline Square, leaving the watch
in a parcel at a public house which I passed on the way. When I got there, the
gentleman was at dinner; but he came out quick enough when he heard that a
young man wanted to see him. I suppose he guessed who the young man would prove
to be. He was a genial-looking old fellow, and he led me away with him into his
study.</p>
<p>"'Well, my lad,' said he, 'what is it?'</p>
<p>"'I've come about that watch of yours,' said I. 'I think I can lay my hands
on it.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, it was you that took it!' said he.</p>
<p>"'No,' I answered; 'I know nothing whatever about how you lost it. I have
been sent by another party to see you about it. Even if you have me arrested
you will not find out anything.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' he said, 'I don't want to be hard on you. Hand it over, and here is
my check for the amount.'</p>
<p>"'Checks won't do,' said I;' I must have it in gold.'</p>
<p>"'It would take an hour or so to collect in gold,' said he.</p>
<p>"'That will just suit,' I answered, 'for I have not got the watch with me.
I'll go back and fetch it, while you raise the money.'</p>
<p>"I started off and got the watch where I had left it. When I came back, the
old gentleman was sitting behind his study table, with the little heap of gold
in front of him.</p>
<p>"'Here is your money,' he said, and pushed it over.</p>
<p>"'Here is your watch,' said I.</p>
<p>"He was evidently delighted to get it back; and after examining it
carefully, and assuring himself that it was none the worse, he put it into the
watch-pocket of his coat with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"'Now, my lad,' he said, 'I know it was you that took the watch. Tell me how
you did it, and I don't mind giving you an extra five-pound note.'</p>
<p>"'I wouldn't tell you in any case,' said I; 'but especially I wouldn't tell
you when you have a witness hid behind that curtain.' You see, I had all my
wits about me, and it didn't escape me that the curtain was drawn tighter than
it had been before.</p>
<p>"'You are too sharp for us,' said he, good-humoredly. 'Well, you have got
your money, and that's an end of it. I'll take precious good care you don't get
hold of my watch again in a hurry. Good night&mdash;no; not that door,' he
added as I marched towards a cupboard. 'This is the door,' and he stood up and
opened it. I brushed past him, opened the hall door, and was round the corner
of the square in no time. I don't know how long the old gentleman took to find
it out, but in passing him at the door, I managed to pick his pocket for the
second time, and next morning the family heirloom was in the melting-pot, after
all. That wasn't bad, was it?'"</p>
<p>The old war-horse had evidently forgotten all about his conversion now.
There was a tone of triumph in the conclusion of his anecdote which showed that
his pride in his smartness far surpassed his repentance of his misdeeds. He
seemed pleased at the astonishment and amusement I expressed at his
adroitness.</p>
<p>"Yes," he continued with a laugh, "it was a capital joke. But sometimes the
fun lies all the other way. Even the sharpest of us come to grief at times.
There was one rather curious incident which occurred in my career. You may
possibly have seen the anecdote, for it got into print at the time."</p>
<p>"Pray let me hear it," said I.</p>
<p>"Well, it is hard lines telling stories against one's self, but this was how
it happened: I had made a rather good haul, and invested some of the swag in
buying a very fine diamond ring. I thought it would be something to fall back
upon when all the ready was gone and times were hard. I had just purchased it,
and was going back to my lodgings in the omnibus, when, as luck would have it,
a very stylishly-dressed young lady came in and took her seat beside me. I
didn't pay much attention to her at first; but after a time something hard in
her dress knocked up against my hand, which my experienced touch soon made out
to be a purse. It struck me that I could not pass the time more profitably or
agreeably than by making this purse my own. I had to do it very carefully; but
I managed at last to wriggle my hand into her rather light pocket, and I
thought the job was over. Just at this moment she rose abruptly to leave the
'bus, and I had hardly time to get my hand with the purse in it out of her
pocket without detection. It was not until she had been gone some time that I
found out that in drawing out my hand in that hurried manner the new and ill-
fitting ring had slipped over my finger and remained in the young lady's
pocket. I sprang out and ran in the direction in which she had gone with the
intention of picking her pocket once again. She had disappeared, however; and
from that day till this I have never set eyes on her. To make the matter worse,
there was only four pence half-penny in coppers inside the purse. Sarve me
right for trying to rob such a pretty girl; still, if I had that two hundred
quid now I should not be reduced to&mdash;Good heavens, forgive me! What am I
saying?"</p>
<p>He seemed inclined to relapse into silence after this; but I was determined
to draw him out a little more, if I could possibly manage it.</p>
<p>"There is less personal risk in the branch you have been talking of," I
remarked, " than there is in burglary."</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, warming to his subject once again, "it is the higher game
which is best worth aiming at. Talk about sport, sir, talk about fishing or
hunting! Why, it is tame in comparison! Think of the great country house with
its men-servants and its dogs and its firearms, and you with only your jimmy
and your centre-bit, and your mother wit, which is best of all. It is the
triumph of intellect over brute force, sir, as represented by bolts and
bars."</p>
<p>"People generally look upon it as quite the reverse," I remarked.</p>
<p>"I was never one of those blundering life-preserver fellows," said my
companion. "I did try my hand at garroting once; but it was against my
principles, and I gave it up. I have tried everything. I have been a bedridden
widow with three young children; but I do object to physical force."</p>
<p>"You have been what? " said I.</p>
<p>"A bedridden widow. Advertising, you know, and getting subscriptions. I have
tried them all. You seem interested in these experiences," he continued, "so I
will tell you another anecdote. It was the narrowest escape from penal
servitude that ever I had in my life. A pal and I had gone down on a country
beat&mdash;it doesn't signify where it was&mdash;and taken up our headquarters
in a little provincial town. Somehow it got noised abroad that we were there,
and householders were warned to be careful, as suspicious characters had been
seen in the neighborhood. We should have changed our plans when we saw the game
was up; but my chum was a plucky fellow, and wouldn't consent to back down.
Poor little Jim! He was only thirty-four round the chest, and about twelve at
the biceps; but there is not a measuring-tape in England could have given the
size of his heart. He said we were in for it, and we must stick to it; so I
agreed to stay, and we chose Morley Hall, the country house of a certain
Colonel Morley, to begin with.</p>
<p>"Now this Colonel Morley was about the last man in the world that we should
have meddled with. He was a shrewd, coolheaded fellow, who had knocked about
and seen the world, and it seems that he took a special pride in the detection
of criminals. However, we knew nothing of all this at that time; so we set
forth hopefully to have a try at the house.</p>
<p>"The reason that made us pick him out among the rest was that he had a
good-for-nothing groom, who was a tool in our hands. This fellow had drawn up a
rough plan of the premises for us. The place was pretty well locked up and
guarded, and the only weak point we could see was a certain trap-door, the
padlock of which was broken, and which opened from the roof into one of the
lumber-rooms. If we could only find any method of reaching the roof, we might
force a way securely from above. We both thought the plan rather a good one,
and it had a spice of originality about it which pleased us. It is not the mere
jewels or plate, you know, that a good cracksman thinks about. The neatness of
the job and his reputation for smartness are almost as important in his
eyes.</p>
<p>"We had been very quiet for a day or two, just to let suspicion die away.
Then we set out one dark night, Jim and I, and got over the avenue railings and
up to the house without meeting a soul. It was blowing hard, I remember, and
the clouds were hurrying across the sky. We had a good look at the front of the
house, and then Jim went round to the garden side. He came running back in a
minute or two in a great state of delight. 'Why, Bill,' he said, gripping me by
the arm, 'there never was such a bit of luck! They've been repairing the roof
or something, and they've left the ladder standing.' We went round together,
and there, sure enough, was the ladder towering above our heads, and one or two
laborers' hods lying about, which showed that some work had been going on
during the day. We had a good look round, to see that everything was quiet, and
then we climbed up, Jim first and I after him. We got to the top, and were
sitting on the slates, having a bit of a breather before beginning business,
when you can fancy our feelings to see the ladder that we came up by suddenly
stand straight up in the air, and then slowly descend until it rested in the
garden below. At first we hoped it might have slipped, though that was bad
enough; but we soon had that idea put out of our heads.</p>
<p>"'Hullo, up there!' cried a voice from below.</p>
<p>"We craned our heads over the edge, and there was a man, dressed, as far as
we could make out, in evening dress, and standing in the middle of the grass
plot. We kept quiet.</p>
<p>"'Hullo!' he shouted again. 'How do you feel yourself? Pretty comfortable,
eh? Ha! ha! You London rogues thought we were green in the country. What's your
opinion now?'</p>
<p>"We both lay still, though feeling pretty considerably small, as you may
imagine.</p>
<p>"'It's all right; I see you,' he continued. 'Why, I have been waiting behind
that lilac bush every night for the last week, expecting to see you. I knew you
couldn't resist going up that ladder, when you found the windows were too much
for you.&mdash;Joe! Joe!'</p>
<p>"'Yes, sir,' said a voice, and another man came from among the bushes.</p>
<p>"'Just you keep your eye on the roof, will you, while I ride down to the
station and fetch up a couple of constables?&mdash;<i>Au revoir</i>, gentlemen!
You don't mind waiting, I suppose?' And Colonel Morley&mdash;for it was the
owner of the house himself&mdash;strode off; and in a few minutes we heard the
rattle of his horse's hoofs going down the avenue.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, we felt precious silly, as you may imagine. It wasn't so much
having been nabbed that bothered us, as the feeling of being caught in such a
simple trap. We looked at each other in blank disgust, and then, to save our
lives, we couldn't help bursting into laughter at our own fix. However, it was
no laughing matter; so we set to work going around the roof, and seeing if
there was a likely water-pipe or anything that might give us a chance of
escape. We had to give it up as a bad job; so we sat down again, and made up
our minds to the worst. Suddenly an idea flashed into my head, and I groped my
way over the roof until I felt wood under my feet. I bent down and found that
the colonel had actually forgotten to secure the padlock! You will often
notice, as you go through life, that it is the shrewdest and most cunning man
who falls into the most absurd mistakes; and this was an example of it. You may
guess that we did not lose much time, for we expected to hear the constables
every moment. We dropped through into the lumber-room, slipped downstairs, tore
open the library shutters, and were out and away before the astonished groom
could make out what had happened. There wasn't time enough to take any little
souvenir with us, worse luck. I should have liked to have seen the colonel's
face when he came back with the constables and found that the birds were
flown."</p>
<p>"Did you ever come across the colonel again?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes; we skinned him of every bit of plate he had, down to the salt- spoons,
a few years later. It was partly out of revenge, you see, that we did it. It
was a very well-managed and daring thing, one of the best I ever saw, and all
done in open daylight, too."</p>
<p>"How in the world did you do it? " I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, there were three of us in it&mdash;Jim was one&mdash;and we set about
it in this way: We wanted to begin by getting the colonel out of the way, so I
wrote him a note purporting to come from Squire Brotherwick, who lived about
ten miles away, and was not always on the best of terms with the master of
Morley Hall. I dressed myself up as a groom, and delivered the note myself. It
was to the effect that the squire thought he was able to lay his hands on the
scoundrels who had escaped from the colonel a couple of years before, and that
if the colonel would ride over they would have little difficulty in securing
them. I was sure that this would have the desired effect; so, after handing it
in, and remarking that I was the squire's groom, I walked off again, as if on
the way back to my master's.</p>
<p>"After getting out of sight of the house, I crouched down behind a hedge;
and, as I expected, in less than a quarter of an hour the colonel came swinging
past me on his chestnut mare. Now, there is another accomplishment I possess
which I have not mentioned to you yet, and that is, that I can copy any
handwriting that I see. It is a very easy trick to pick up if you only give
your mind to it. I happened to have come across one of Colonel Morley's letters
some days before, and I can write so that even now I defy an expert to detect a
difference between the hands. This was a great assistance to me now, for I tore
a leaf out of my pocket-book and wrote something to this effect:</p>
<p>"'As Squire Brotherwick has seen some suspicious characters about, and the
house may be attempted again, I have sent down to the bank, and ordered them to
send up their bank-cart to convey the whole of the plate to a place of safety.
It will save us a good deal of anxiety to know that it is in absolute security.
Have it packed up and ready, and give the bearer a glass of beer.'</p>
<p>"Having composed this precious epistle, I addressed it to the butler, and
carried it back to the Hall, saying that their master had overtaken me on the
way and asked me to deliver it. I was taken in and made much of down-stairs,
while a great packing case was dragged into the hall, and the plate stowed
away, among cotton-wool and stuffing. It was nearly ready, when I heard the
sound of wheels upon the gravel, and sauntered round just in time to see a
business-like closed car drive up to the door. One of my pals was sitting very
demurely on the box, while Jim, with an official-looking hat, sprang out and
bustled into the hall.</p>
<p>"'Now then,' I heard him say, 'look sharp! What's for the bank? Come
on!'</p>
<p>"'Wait a minute, sir,' said the butler.</p>
<p>"'Can't wait. There's a panic all over the country, and they are clamoring
for us everywhere. Must drive on to Lord Blackbury's place, unless you are
ready.'</p>
<p>"'Don't go, sir!' pleaded the butler. 'There's only this one rope to tie.
There, it is ready now. You'll look after it, won't you?'</p>
<p>"'That we will. You'll never have any more trouble with it now,' said Jim,
helping to push the great case into the car.</p>
<p>"'I think I had better go with you and see it stowed away in the bank,' said
the butler.</p>
<p>"'All right,' said Jim, nothing abashed. 'You can't come in the car, though,
for Lord Blackbury's box will take up all the spare room. Let's see; it's
twelve o'clock now. Well, you be waiting at the bank door at half-past one, and
you will just catch us.'</p>
<p>"'All right; half-past one,' said the butler.</p>
<p>"'Good-day,' cried my chum; and away went the car, while I made a bit of a
short cut and caught it around a turn of the road. We drove right off into the
next county, got a down-train to London, and before midnight the colonel's
silver was fused into a solid lump."</p>
<p>I could not help laughing at the versatility of the old scoundrel. "It was a
daring game to play," I said.</p>
<p>"It is always the daring game which succeeds best," he answered.</p>
<p>At this point the train began to show symptoms of slowing down, and my
companion put on his overcoat and gave other signs of being near the end of his
journey.</p>
<p>"You are going on to Dover? " he said.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"For the Continent?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How long do you intend to travel?"</p>
<p>"Only for a week or so."</p>
<p>"Well, I must leave you here. You will remember my name, won't you? John
Wilkie. I am pleased to have met you. Is my umbrella behind you?" he added,
stretching across. "No; I beg your pardon. Here it is in the corner;" and with
an affable smile, the ex-cracksman stepped out, bowed, and disappeared among
the crowd upon the platform.</p>
<p>I lit another cigar, laughed as I thought of my late companion, and lifted
up the "Times," which he had left behind him. The bell had rung, the wheels
were already revolving, when, to my astonishment, a pallid face looked in at me
through the window. It was so contorted and agitated that I hardly recognized
the features which I had been gazing upon during the last couple of hours.
"Here, take it," he said, "take it. It's hardly worth my while to rob you of
seven pounds four shillings, but I couldn't resist once more trying my hand;"
and he flung something into the carriage and disappeared.</p>
<p>It was my old leather purse, with my return ticket, and the whole of my
travelling expenses. His newly awakened conscience had driven him to instant
restitution.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>THE CONFESSION</h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Star,</i> 17 January 1898.</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Convent of the Third Order of Dominican Nuns&mdash;a large whitewashed
building with little deep-set windows&mdash;stands at the corner of the Rua de
St. Pedro in Lisbon. Inside the high wooden porch there is a life-size wooden
statue of Saint Dominic, founder of the order, and the stranger is surprised to
observe the curious scraps which are scattered over the pedestal. These
singular votive offerings vary from week to week. For the most part they
consist of cups of wine, splinters of firewood, crumbs of cheese, and berries
of coffee, but occasionally a broken tin saucepan or a cracked plate is to be
found among them. With simple faith the sisters, when their household stores
run low, lay a piece of whatever it is they lack in front of their saint, as a
reminder to him that they look to him for help; and sure enough upon the next
day there arrives the wood, the wine, the new saucepan, or whatever else it is
that they need. Whether this is due to a miracle, or to the help of the pious
laity outside, may be a question to others, but it is none to the simple-minded
Sisters of Saint Dominic. To them their whole existence is one continued
miracle, and they point to the shelves of their own larder as a final
refutation of every heretical doubt.</p>
<p>And had they been asked, these gentle fanatics, why their order above all
others should be chosen for this constant supernatural care, they would have
answered that it was a heavenly recognition of the sanctity of their Mother
Superior. For twenty years Sister Monica had worked among those fallen classes
which it is the special mission of the Dominican nuns to rescue. There was not
an alley in Lisbon which had not been brightened by the flutter of her long
white gown. And still as lady abbess she went on working and praying, with a
tireless energy which put the young novices to shame. No one could compute how
many there were who had been drawn from a life of sin through her exertions.
For she had, above all things, the power of showing sympathy and of drawing the
confidence of those who had suffered. They said that it was a sign that she had
suffered herself; but none knew her early history, for she had come from the
mountains of the north, and she spoke seldom and briefly of her own life. Her
wax-like face was cold and serene, but there came a look sometimes into her
large dark eyes which made the wretched and the poor feel that there was no
depth of sorrow where the Abbess Monica had not been before them.</p>
<p>In the placid life of the convent, there is one annual event which is
preceded by six months of expectation and followed by six of reminiscence. It
is the yearly mission or "retreat," when some reverend preacher comes among
them, and, through a week of prayer and exhortation, stimulates these pious
souls to a finer shade of spirituality. Only a saint could hope to influence so
saint-like a congregation, and it is the last crown to the holy and earnest
priest that he should have given a retreat to the Sisters of Saint Dominic. On
one year it had been Espinas, the Franciscan; on another Father Menas, the
famous Abbot of Alcantara. But neither of these had caused the suppressed
excitement which filled the convent when it passed from cell to cell that the
retreat this year was to be given by no less a man than Father Garcia, the
Jesuit.</p>
<p>For Father Garcia was a priest whose name was famous through all Catholic
Europe as being a worthy successor to those great men, the Xaviers and Loyolas,
who founded the first company of Jesus. He was a preacher; he was a writer;
above all he was a martyr, for he had carried the gospel into Thibet and had
come back with splintered fingers and twisted wrists as a sign of his devotion.
Those mutilated hands raised in exhortation had moved his hearers more than the
exhortation itself. In person he was tall, dark, and bent, worn to the bone
with self-discipline, with a keen, eager face, and the curved predatory nose of
the aggressive Churchman. Once that dark, deep-lined face had grace and beauty;
now it had character and power; but in youth or age it was a face which neither
man nor woman could look upon with indifference. A pagan sword-cut, which had
disfigured the cheek, gave it an additional grace in the eyes of the faithful.
So warped, and worn, and haggard was the man's whole appearance, that one might
have doubted whether such a frame could contain so keen and earnest a spirit,
had it not been for those flashing dark eyes which burned in the heavy shadows
of the tufted brows.</p>
<p>It was those eyes which dominated his hearers, whether they consisted of the
profligate society of Lisbon or of the gentle nuns of St. Dominic. When they
gleamed fiercely as he denounced sin and threatened the sinner, or when, more
seldom, they softened into a serene light as he preached the gospel of love,
they forced those who saw them into the emotion which they expressed. Standing
at the foot of the altar, with his long black figure and his eager face, he
swayed the dense crowd of white-cowled women with every flash of those terrible
eyes and with every sweep of that mutilated hand. But most of all he moved the
Abbess. Her eyes were never taken from his face, and it was noticed that she,
who had seemed for so long to have left all the emotions of this world beneath
her, sat now with her wax-like face as white as the cowl which framed it, and
that after every sermon she would tremble and shake until her rosary rattled
against the wooden front of her prie-dieu. The lay-sister of the refectory, who
had occasion to consult the Lady Abbess upon one of those nights, could
scarcely believe her eyes when she saw her self-contained Superior sobbing her
heart out, with her face buried in her little hard pillow.</p>
<p>At last the week of the retreat was over, and upon the Saturday night each
nun was to make her general confession as a preparation for the Communion upon
the Sunday morning. One after another these white-gowned figures, whose dress
was emblematic of their souls, passed into the confessional, whispered through
the narrow grating the story of their simple lives, and listened in deep
humility and penitence to the wise advice and gentle admonitions which the old
priest, with eyes averted, whispered back to them. So in their due order,
lay-sisters, novices, sisters, they came back into the chapel, and waited only
for the return of their Abbess to finish the day with the usual vespers.</p>
<p>The Abbess Monica had entered the little dark confessional, and saw through
the foot-square wire-latticed opening the side of a grey head, one listening
ear, and a claw-like hand which covered the rest of the face. A single candle
was burning dimly by the Jesuit's side, and she heard the faint rustle as he
turned over the leaves of his breviary. With the air of one who discloses the
most terrible crimes, she knelt, with her head abased in sweet humility, and
murmured the few trivial faults which still united her to humanity. So slight
they were, and so few, that the priest was wondering in his mind what penance
there was which would not be out of all proportion to her innocence, when the
penitent hesitated, as if she still had something to say but found it difficult
to say it.</p>
<p>"Courage, my sister," said Father Garcia: "what is there which still
remains?"</p>
<p>"What remains," said she, "is the worst of all."</p>
<p>"And yet it may not be very serious," said the confessor reassuringly:
<i>"have</i> no fear, my sister, in confiding it to me."</p>
<p>But still the Abbess hesitated, and when at last she spoke it was in a
whisper so low that the hand beyond the grating gathered itself round the
ear.</p>
<p>"Reverend father," she said, "we who wear the garb of the holy Dominic have
vowed to leave behind us all thoughts of that which is worldly. And yet I, who
am the unworthy Abbess, to whom all others have a right to look for an example,
have during all this week been haunted by the memory of one whom I
loved&mdash;of a man whom I loved, father&mdash;in the days so many years ago
before I took the veil."</p>
<p>"My sister," said the Jesuit, "our thoughts are not always ours to command.
When they are such as our conscience disapproves we can but regret them and
endeavour to put them away."</p>
<p>"There lies the blackness of my sin, father. The thoughts were sweet to me,
and I could not in my heart wish to put them away. When I was in my cell I did
indeed struggle with my own weakness, but at the first words which fell from
your lips&mdash;"</p>
<p>"From my lips!"</p>
<p>"It was your voice, father, which made me think of what I had believed that
I had at last forgotten. Every tone of your voice brought back the memory of
Pedro."</p>
<p>The confessor started at this indiscretion by which the penitent had
voluntarily uttered the name of her lover. She heard his breviary flutter down
upon the ground, but he did not stoop to pick it up. For some little time there
was a silence, and then with head averted he pronounced the penance and the
absolution.</p>
<p>She had risen from the cushion, and was turning to go, when a little gasping
cry came from beside her. She looked down at the grating, and shrank in terror
from the sight. A convulsed face was looking out at her, framed in that little
square of oak. Two terrible eyes looked out of it&mdash;two eyes so full of
hungry longing and hopeless despair that all the secret miseries of thirty
years flashed into that one glance.</p>
<p>"Julia!" he cried.</p>
<p>And she leaned against the wooden partition of the confessional, her hand
upon her heart, her face sunk. Pale and white-clad, she looked a drooping
lily.</p>
<p>"It is you, Pedro," said she at last. "We must not speak. It is wrong."</p>
<p>"My duty as a priest is done," said he. "For God's sake give me a few words.
Never in this world shall we two meet again."</p>
<p>She knelt down upon the cushion, so that her pale pure face was near to
those terrible eyes which still burned beyond the grating.</p>
<p>"I did not know you, Pedro. You are very changed. Only your voice is the
same."</p>
<p>"I did not know you either&mdash;not until you mentioned my old name. I did
not know that you had taken the veil."</p>
<p>She heaved a gentle sigh.</p>
<p>"What was there left for me to do?" she said. "I had nothing to live for
when you had left me."</p>
<p>His breath came quick, and harsh through the grating. "When I left you? When
you ordered me away," said he.</p>
<p>"Pedro, you know that you left me."</p>
<p>The eager, dark face composed itself suddenly, with the effort of a strong
man who steadies himself down to meet his fate.</p>
<p>"Listen, Julia," said he. "I saw you last upon the Plaza. We had but an
instant, because your family and mine were enemies. I said that if you put your
lamp in your window I would take it as a sign that you wished me to remain true
to you, but that if you did not I should vanish from your life. You did not put
it."</p>
<p>"I did put it, Pedro."</p>
<p>"Your window was the third from the top?"</p>
<p>"It was the first. Who told you that it was the third?"</p>
<p>"Your cousin Alphonso&mdash;my only friend in the family."</p>
<p>"My cousin Alphonso was my rejected suitor."</p>
<p>The two claw-like hands flew up into the air with a horrible spasm of
hatred.</p>
<p>"Hush, Pedro, hush!" she whispered.</p>
<p>"I have said nothing."</p>
<p>"Forgive him!"</p>
<p>"No, I shall never forgive him. Never! never!"</p>
<p>"You did not wish to leave me, then?"</p>
<p>"I joined the order in the hope of death."</p>
<p>"And you never forgot me?"</p>
<p>"God help me, I never could."</p>
<p>"I am so glad that you could not forget me. Oh, Pedro, your poor, poor
hands! My loss has been the gain of others. I have lost my love, and I have
made a saint and a martyr."</p>
<p>But he had sunk his face, and his gaunt shoulders shook with his agony.</p>
<p>"What about our lives!" he murmured. "What about our wasted lives!"<br>
<br></p>
<p>The Sisters of St. Dominic still talk of the last sermon which Father Garcia
delivered to them&mdash;a sermon upon the terrible mischances of life, and upon
the hidden sweetness which may come from them, until the finest flower of good
may bloom upon the foulest stem of evil. He spoke of the soul-killing sorrow
which may fall upon us, and how we may be chastened by it, if it be only that
we learn a deeper and truer sympathy for the sorrow of our neighbour. And then
he prayed himself, and implored his hearers to pray, that an unhappy man and a
gentle woman might learn to take sorrow in such a spirit, and that the
rebellious spirit of the one might be softened and the tender soul of the other
made strong. Such was the prayer which a hundred of the sisters sent up; and if
sweetness and purity can aid it, their prayer may have brought peace once more
to the Abbess Monica and to Father Garcia of the Order of Jesus.</p>

<h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i>, Dec 1898<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>SIR WILLIAM SPARTER was a man who had raised himself in the course of a
quarter of a century from earning four-and-twenty shillings a week as a fitter
in Portsmouth Dockyard to being the owner of a yard and a fleet of his own. The
little house in Lake Road, Landport, where he, an obscure mechanic, had first
conceived the idea of the boilers which are associated with his name, is still
pointed out to the curious. But now, at the age of fifty, he owned a mansion in
Leinster Gardens, a country house at Taplow and a shooting in Argyleshire, with
the best stable, the choicest cellars and the prettiest wife in town.</p>
<p>As untiring and inflexible as one of his own engines, his life had been
directed to the one purpose of attaining the very best which the world had to
give. Square-headed and round-shouldered, with massive, clean-shaven face and
slow, deep-set eyes, he was the very embodiment of persistency and strength.
Never once from the beginning of his career had public failure of any sort
tarnished its brilliancy.</p>
<p>And yet he had failed in one thing, and that the most important of all. He
had never succeeded in gaining the affection of his wife. She was the daughter
of a surgeon, and the belle of a northern town when he married her. Even then
he was rich and powerful, which made her overlook the twenty years which
divided them. But he had come on a long way since then. His great Brazilian
contract, his conversion into a company, his baronetcy&mdash;all these had been
since his marriage. Only in the one thing he had never progressed. He could
frighten his wife, he could dominate her, he could make her admire his strength
and respect his consistency, he could mold her to his will in every other
direction, but, do what he would, he could not make her love him.</p>
<p>But it was not for want of trying. With the unrelaxing patience which made
him great in business, he had striven, year in and year out, to win her
affection. But the very qualities which had helped him in his public life had
made him unbearable in private. He was tactless, unsympathetic, overbearing,
almost brutal sometimes, and utterly unable to think out those small attentions
in word and deed which women value far more than the larger material benefits.
The hundred-pound check tossed across a breakfast lable is a much smaller thing
to a woman than the five-shilling charm which represents some thought and some
trouble upon the part of the giver.</p>
<p>Sparter failed to understand this. With his mind full of the affairs of his
firm, he had little time for the delicacies of life, and he endeavored to atone
by periodical munificence. At the end of five years he found that he had lost
rather than gained in the lady's affections. Then, at this unwonted sense of
failure, the evil side of the man's nature began to stir, and he became
dangerous. But he was more dangerous still when a letter of his wife's came,
through the treachery of a servant, into his hands, and he realized that if she
was cold to him she had passion enough for another. His firm, his ironclads,
his patents, everything was dropped, and he turned his huge energies to the
undoing of the man.</p>
<p>He had been cold and silent during dinner that evening, and she had wondered
vaguely what had occurred to change him. He had said nothing while they sat
together over their coffee in the drawing-room. Once or twice she had glanced
at him in surprise, and had found those deep-set gray eyes fixed upon her with
an expression that was new to her. Her mind had been full of some one else, but
gradually her husband's silence and the inscrutable expression of his face
forced themselves upon her attention.</p>
<p>"You don't seem yourself, to-night, William. What is the matter?" she asked.
"I hope there has been nothing to trouble you."</p>
<p>He was still silent and leaned back in his arm-chair, watching her beautiful
face, which had turned pale with the sense of some impending catastrophe.</p>
<p>"Can I do anything for you, William?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you can write a letter."</p>
<p>"What is the letter?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you presently."</p>
<p>The last murmur died away in the house, and they heard the discreet step of
Peterson, the butler, and the snick of the lock as he made all secure for the
night. Sir William Sparter sat listening for a while. Then he rose.</p>
<p>"Come into my study," said he.</p>
<p>The room was dark, but he switched on the green-shaded electric lamp which
stood upon the writing-table.</p>
<p>"Sit there at the table," said he. He closed the door and seated himself
beside her. "I only wanted to tell you, Jacky, that I know about Lambert."</p>
<p>She gasped and shivered, flinching away from him with her hands out as if
she feared a blow.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know everything," said he, and his quiet tone carried such
conviction with it that she could not question what he said. She made no reply,
but sat with her eyes fixed upon his grave, massive face. A clock ticked loudly
upon the mantelpiece, but everything else was silent in the house. She had
never noticed that ticking before, but now it was like the hammering of a nail
into her head. He rose and put a sheet of paper before her. Then he drew one
from his own pocket and flattened it out upon the corner of the table.</p>
<p>"I have a rough draft here of the letter which I wish you to copy," said he.
"I will read it to you if you like. 'My own dearest Cecil: I will be at No. 29
at half-past six, and I particularly wish you to come before you go down to the
opera. Don't fail me, for I have the very strongest reasons for wishing to see
you. Ever yours, Jacqueline.' Take up a pen and copy that letter."</p>
<p>"William, you are plotting some revenge. Oh, William, if I have wronged you,
I am so sorry&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>"But what is it that you wish to do? Why should you desire him to come at
that hour?"</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>"How can you be so harsh, William? You know very well&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>"I begin to hate you, William. I believe that it is a fiend, not a man, that
I have married."</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>Gradually the inflexible will and the unfaltering purpose began to prevail
over the creature of nerves and moods. Reluctantly, mutinously, she took the
pen in her hand.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't harm him, William!"</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>"Will you promise to forgive me, if I do?"</p>
<p>"Copy that letter!"</p>
<p>She looked at him with the intention of defying him, but those masterful
gray eyes dominated her. She was like a half-hypnotized creature, resentful,
and yet obedient.</p>
<p>"There, will that satisfy you?"</p>
<p>He took the note from her hand and placed it in an envelope.</p>
<p>"Now address it to him!"</p>
<p>She wrote "Cecil Lambert, Esq., 138B, Half Moon street, W." in a straggling,
agitated hand. Her husband very deliberately blotted it and placed it carefully
in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>"I hope that you are satisfied now." said she with weak petulance.</p>
<p>"Quite," said he gravely. "You can go to your room. Mrs. McKay has my orders
to sleep with you, and to see that you write no letters."</p>
<p>"Mrs. McKay! Do you expose me to the humiliation of being watched by my own
servants?"</p>
<p>"Go to your room!"</p>
<p>"If you imagine that I am going to be under the orders of the
housekeeper&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Go to your room!"</p>
<p>"Oh. William, who would have thought in the old days that you could ever
have treated me like this? If my mother had ever dreamed&mdash;"</p>
<p>He took her by the arm, and led her to the door.</p>
<p>"Go to your room!" said he, and she passed out into the darkened hall. He
closed the door and returned to the writing table. Out of a drawer he took two
things which he had purchased that day, the one a paper and the other a book.
The former was a recent number of the "Musical Record," and it contained a
biography and picture of the famous Signor Lambert, whose wonderful tenor voice
had been the delight of the public and the despair of his rivals. The picture
was that of a good-natured, self-satisfied creature, young and handsome, with a
full eye, a curling mustache and a bull neck. The biography explained that he
was only in his twenty-seventh year, that his career had been one continued
triumph, that he was devoted to his art, and that his voice was worth to him,
at a very moderate computation, some twenty thousand pounds a year. All this
Sir William Sparter read very carefully, with his great brows drawn down, and a
furrow like a gash between them, as his way was when his attention was
concentrated. Then he folded the paper up again, and he opened the book.</p>
<p>It was a curious work for such a man to select for his reading&mdash;a
technical treatise upon the organs of speech and voice-production. There were
numerous colored illustrations, to which he paid particular attention. Most of
them were of the internal anatomy of the larynx, with the silvery vocal cords
shining from under the pink arytenoid cartilage. Far into the night Sir William
Sparter, with those great virile eyebrows still bunched together, pored over
these irrelevant pictures, and read and reread the text in which they were
explained.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Dr. Manifold Ormonde, the famous throat specialist, of Cavendish square, was
surprised next morning when his butler brought the card of Sir William Sparter
into his consulting-room. He had met him at dinner at the table of Lord Marvin
a few nights before, and it struck him at that time that he had seldom seen a
man who looked such a type of rude, physical health. So he thought again, as
the square, thick-set figure of the shipbuilder was ushered in to him.</p>
<p>"Glad to see you again. Sir William," said the specialist. "I hope there is
nothing wrong with your health."</p>
<p>"Nothing, thank you."</p>
<p>He sat down in the chair which the doctor had indicated, and he ran his eyes
slowly and deliberately round the room. Dr. Ormonde watched him with some
curiosity, for he had the air of a man who looks for something which he had
expected to see.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't come about my health." said he at last. "I came for
information."</p>
<p>"Whatever I can give you is entirely at your disposal."</p>
<p>"I have been studying the throat a little of late. I read Mclntyre's book
about it. I suppose that is all right."</p>
<p>"An elementary treatise, but accurate as far as it goes."</p>
<p>"I had an idea that you would be likely to have a model or something of that
kind."</p>
<p>For answer the doctor unclasped the lid of a yellow, shining box upon his
consulting-room table, and turned it back upon the hinge. Within was a complete
model of the human vocal organs.</p>
<p>"You are right, you see," said he.</p>
<p>Sir William Sparter stood up, and bent over the model.</p>
<p>"It's a neat little bit of work," said he, looking at it with the critical
eyes of an engineer. "This is the glottis, is it not? And here is the
epiglottis."</p>
<p>"Precisely. And here are the cords."</p>
<p>"What would happen if you cut them?"</p>
<p>"Cut what?"</p>
<p>"These things&mdash;the vocal cords."</p>
<p>"But you could not cut them. They are out of the reach of accident."</p>
<p>"But if such a thing did happen?"</p>
<p>"There is no such case upon record, but, of course, the person would become
dumb&mdash;for a time, at any rate."</p>
<p>"You have a large practice among singers, have you not?"</p>
<p>"The largest in London."</p>
<p>"I suppose you agree with what this man Mclntyre says, that a fine voice
depends partly upon the cords."</p>
<p>"The volume of sound would depend upon the lung capacity, but the clearness
of the note would correspond with the complete control which the singer
exercised over the cords.</p>
<p>"Any roughness or notching of the cords would ruin the voice?"</p>
<p>"For singing purposes, undoubtedly&mdash;but your researches seem to be
taking a very curious direction."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sir William, as he picked up his hat, and laid a fee upon the
corner of the table. "They are a little out of the common, are they not?"</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Warburton street is one of the network of thoroughfares which connects
Chelsea with Kensington, and it is chiefly remarkable for the number of studios
it contains. Signor Lambert, the famous tenor, owned an apartment here, and his
neat little dark-green brougham might have been seen several times a week
waiting at the head of the long passage which led down to the chambers in
question.</p>
<p>When Sir William Sparter, muffled in his overcoat, and carrying a small
black leather bag in his hand, turned the corner, he saw the lamps of the
carriage against the curb, and knew that the man whom he had come to see was
already in the place of assignation. He passed the empty brougham, and walked
up the tile-paved passage with the yellow gas lamp shining at the far end of
it.</p>
<p>The door was open, and led into a large empty hall, laid down with coconut
matting and stained with many footmarks. The place was a rabbit warren by
daylight, but now, when the working hours were over, it was deserted. A
housekeeper in the basement was the only permanent resident. Sir William
paused, but everything was silent, and everything was dark save for one door
which was outlined in thin yellow slashes. He pushed it open and entered. Then
he locked it upon the inside and put the key in his pocket.</p>
<p>It was a large room, scantily furnished, and lit by a single oil lamp upon a
center-table. On a chair at the farther side of the table a man had been
sitting, who had sprung to his feet with an exclamation of joy, which had
changed into one of surprise, and culminated in an oath.</p>
<p>"What the devil do you mean by locking that door? Unlock it again, sir, this
instant!"</p>
<p>Sir William did not even answer him. He advanced to the table, opened the
bag, and began to take out all sorts of things&mdash;a green bottle, a
dentist's gag, an inhaler, a forceps, a curved bistoury, a curious pair of
scissors. Signor Lambert stood staring at him in a paralysis of rage and
astonishment.</p>
<p>"You infernal scoundrel&mdash;who are you, and what do you want?"</p>
<p>Sir William had emptied his bag, and now he took off his overcoat and laid
it over the back of a chair. Then for the first time he turned his eyes upon
the singer. He was a taller man than himself, but far slighter and weaker. The
engineer, though short, was exceedingly powerful, with muscles which had been
toughened by hard physical work. His broad shoulders, arching chest and great
gnarled hands gave him the outline of a gorilla. Lambert shrunk away from him,
frightened by his sinister figure and by his cold, inexorable eyes.</p>
<p>"Have you come to rob me?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"I have come to speak to you. My name is Sparter."</p>
<p>Lambert tried to retain his grasp upon the self-possession which was rapidly
slipping away from him.</p>
<p>"Sparter!" said he. with an attempt at jauntiness. "Sir William Sparter, I
presume? I have had the pleasure of meeting Lady Sparter, and I have heard her
mention you. May I ask the object of this visit?" He buttoned up his coat with
twitching fingers, and tried to look rierce over his collar.</p>
<p>"I've come," said Sparter. jerking some fluid from the green bottle into the
inhaler, "to change your voice."</p>
<p>"To change my voice?"</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"You are a madman! What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Kindly lie back upon the settee."</p>
<p>"You are raving! I see it all. You wish to bully me. You have some motive in
this. You imagine that there are relations between Lady Sparter and me. I do
assure you that your wife&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My wife has nothing to do with the matter either now or hereafter. Her name
does not appear at all. My motives are musical&mdash;purely musical, you
understand. I don't like your voice. It wants treatment. Lie back upon the
settee!",</p>
<p>"Sir William, I give you my word of honor&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Lie back."</p>
<p>"You're choking me! It's chloroform! Help, help, help! You brute! Let me go!
Let me go, I say! Oh, please! Lemme&mdash;Lemme&mdash;Lem&mdash;!" His head had
fallen back, and he muttered into the inhaler. Sir William pulled up the table
which held the lamp and the instrument.</p>
<p>It was some minutes after the gentleman with the overcoat and the bag had
emerged that the coachman outside heard a voice shouting, and shouting very
hoarsely and angrily, within the building. Presently came the sounds of
unsteady steps, and his master, crimson with rage, stumbled out into the yellow
circle thrown by the carriage lamps.</p>
<p>"You, Holden!" he cried, "you leave my service to-night. Did you not hear me
calling? Why did you not come?"</p>
<p>The man looked at him in bewilderment, and shuddered at the color of his
shirt-front.</p>
<p>"Yes. sir, I heard some one calling," he answered, "but it wasn't you, sir.
It was a voice that I had never heard before."</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>"Considerable disappointment was caused at the opera last week," said one of
the best-informed musical critics, "by the fact that Signor Cecil Lambert was
unable to appear in the various roles which had been announced. On Tuesday
night it was only, at the very last instant that the management learned of the
grave indisposition which had overtaken him, and had it not been for the
presence of Jean Caravatti. who had understudied the part, the piece must have
been abandoned. Since then we regret to hear that Signor Lambert's seizure was
even more severe than was originally thought, and that it consists of an acute
form of laryngitis, spreading to the vocal cords, and involving changes which
may permanently affect the quality of his voice. All lovers of music will hope
that these reports may prove to be pessimistic, and that we may soon be charmed
once more by the finest tenor which we have heard for many a year upon the
London operatic stage."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>A TRUE STORY OF THE TRAGEDY OF <i>FLOWERY
LAND</i></h2>
<h3>Published in <i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i>, 10 March 1899.</h3>
<hr>
<p>A steam tug was puffing wheezily in front of the high-masted barque-rigged
clipper. With her fresh painted glistening black sides, her sharp sloping bows
and her cut-away counter she was the very picture of a fast, well-found
ocean-going sailing ship, but those who knew anything about her may have made
her the text of a sermon as to how the British seaman was being elbowed out of
existence. In this respect she was the scandal of the river. Chinamen, French,
Norwegian, Spaniards, Turks&mdash;she carried an epitome of the human race.
They were working hard cleaning up the decks and fastening down the hatches,
but the big burly mate tore his hair when he found that hardly a man on board
could understand an order in English.</p>
<p>Capt. John Smith had taken his younger brother, George Smith, as a passenger
and companion for the voyage, in the hope that it might be beneficial to his
health. They were seated now at each side of the round table, an open bottle of
champagne between them, when the mate came in answer to a summons, his eyes
still smouldering after his recent outburst.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Karswell," said the captain, "we have a long six months before
us, I dare say, before we raise the light of Singapore. I thought you might
like to join us in a glass to our better acquaintance and to a lucky
voyage."</p>
<p>He was a jovial, genial soul, this captain, with good humour shining from
his red weather-stained face. The mate's gruffness relaxed before his kindly
words and he tossed off the glass of champagne which the other had filled for
him.</p>
<p>"How does the ship strike you, Mr. Karswell?" asked the captain.</p>
<p>"There's nothing the matter with the ship, sir."</p>
<p>"Nor with the cargo, either," said the captain. "Champagne we are
carrying&mdash;a hundred dozen cases. Those and bales of cloth are our main
lading. How about the crew, Mr. Karswell?" The mate shook his head.</p>
<p>"They'll need thrashing into shape, and that's a fact, sir. I've been
hustling and driving ever since we left the pool. Why, except oursleves here
and Taffir, the second mate, there's hardly an Englishman aboard. The steward,
the cook and the boy are Chinese, as I understand. Anderson, the carpenter, is
a Norwegian. There's Early, the lad, he's English. Then there's one Frenchman,
one Finn, one Turk, one Spaniard, one Greek and one negro, and as to the rest I
don't know what they are, for I never saw the match of them before."</p>
<p>"They are from the Philippine Islands, half Spanish, half Malay," the
captain answered. "We call them Manila men, for that's the port they all hail
from. You'll find them good enough seamen, Mr. Karswell. I'll answer for it
that they work well."</p>
<p>"I'll answer for it, too," said the big mate, with an ominous clenching of
his great red fist.</p>
<p>Karswell was hard put to it to establish any order amongst the strange
material with which he had to work. Taffir, the second mate, was a mild young
man, a good seaman and a pleasant companion, but hardly rough enough to bring
this unruly crew to heel. Karswell must do it or it would never be done. The
others he could manage, but the Manila men were dangerous. It was a strange
type, with flat Tartar noses, small eyes, low brutish foreheads and lank, black
hair like the American Indians. Their faces were of a dark coffee tint, and
they were all men of powerful physique. Six of these fellows were on board,
Leon, Blanco, Duranno, Santos, Lopez and Marsolino, of whom Leon spoke English
well and acted as interpreter for the rest. These were all placed in the mate's
watch together with Watto, a handsome young Levantine, and Carlos, a Greek. The
more tractable seamen were allotted to Taffir for the other watch. And so, on a
beautiful July day, holiday makers upon the Kentish downs saw the beautiful
craft as she swept past the Goodwins&mdash;never to be seen again, save once,
by human eyes.</p>
<p>The Manila men appeared to submit to discipline, but there were lowering
brows and sidelong glances which warned their officers not to trust them too
far. Grumbles came from the forecastle as to the food and water&mdash;and the
grumbling was perhaps not altogether unreasonable. But the mate was a man of
hard nature and prompt resolution, and the malcontents got little satisfaction
or sympathy from him. One of them, Carlos, the Spaniard, endeavoured to keep
his bunk upon a plea of illness, but was dragged on deck by the mate and triced
up by the arms to the bulwarks. A few minutes afterward Capt. Smith's brother
came on deck and informed the captain what was going on forward. He came
bustling up, and having examined the man he pronounced him to be really unwell
and ordered him back to his bunk, prescribing some medicine for him. Such an
incident would not tend to preserve discipline, or to uphold the mate's
authority with the crew. On a later occasion this same Spaniard began fighting
with Blanco, the biggest and most brutal of the Manila men, one using a knife
and the other a handspike. The two mates threw themselves between them, and in
the scuffle the first mate felled the Spaniard with his fist. In the meantime
the barque passed safely through the bay and ran south as far as the latitude
of Cape Blanco upon the African coast. The winds were light, and upon the 10th
of September, when they had been six weeks out, they had only attained latitude
19 degrees south and longitude 36 degrees west. On that morning it was that the
smouldering discontent burst into a most terrible flame.</p>
<p>The mate's watch was from one to four, during which dark hours he was left
alone with the savage seamen whom he had controlled. No lion-tamer in a cage
could be in more imminent peril, for death might be crouching in wait for him
in any of those black shadows which mottled the moonlit deck. Night after night
he had risked it until immunity had perhaps made him careless, but now at last
it came. At six bells or three in the morning&mdash;about the time when the
first grey tinge of dawn was appearing in the Eastern sky, two of the mulattos,
Blanco and Duranno, crept silently up behind the seaman, and struck him down
with handspikes. Early, the English lad, who knew nothing of the plot was
looking out on the forecastle head at the time. Above the humming of the
foresail above him and the lapping of the water, he heard a sudden crash, and
the voice of the mate calling murder. He ran aft, and found Duranno, with
horrible persistence, still beating the mate about the head. When he attempted
to interfere, the fellow ordered him sternly into the deckhouse, and he obeyed.
In the deckhouse the Norwegian carpenter and Candereau, the French seaman, were
sleeping, both of whom were among the honest men. The boy Early told them what
had occurred, his story being corroborated by the screeches of the mate from
the outside. The carpenter ran out and found the unfortunate fellow with his
arm broken and his face horribly mutilated.</p>
<p>"Who's that?" he cried, as he heard steps approaching. "It's me&mdash;the
carpenter."</p>
<p>"For God's sake get me into the cabin!"</p>
<p>The carpenter had stooped, with the intention of doing so, but Marsolino,
one of the conspirators, hit him on the back of the neck and knocked him down.
The blow was not a dangerous one, but the carpenter took it as a sign that he
should mind his own business, for he went back with impotent tears to his
deckhouse. In the meanwhile Blanco, who was the giant of the party, with the
help of another mutineer, had raised Karswell, and hurled him, still yelling
for help, over the bulwarks into the sea. He had been the first attacked but he
was not the first to die.</p>
<p>The first of those below to hear the dreadful summons from the deck was the
Captain's brother, George Smith&mdash;the one who had come for a pleasure trip.
He ran up the companion and had his head beaten to pieces with handspikes as he
emerged. Of the personal characteristics of this pleasure tripper the only item
which has been handed down is the grim fact that he was so light that one man
was able to throw his dead body overboard. The Captain had been aroused at the
same time and had rushed from his rooms into the cabin. Thither he was followed
by Leon, Watto and Lopez, who stabbed him to death with their knives. There
remained only Taffir, the second mate, and his adventures may be treated with
less reticence since they were happier in their outcome.</p>
<p>He was awakened in the first grey of dawn by the sounds of smashing and
hammering upon the companion. To so experienced a seaman those sounds at such
an hour could have carried but one meaning, and that the most terrible which an
officer at sea can ever learn. With a sinking heart, he sprang from his bunk
and rushed to the companion. It was choked by the sprawling figure of the
captain's brother, upon whose head a rain of blows was still descending. In
trying to push his way up, Taffir received a crack which knocked him backwards.
Half distracted he rushed back into the cabin and turned down the lamp, which
was smoking badly&mdash;a graphic little touch which helps us to realise the
agitation of the last hand which lit it. He then caught sight of the body of
the captain pierced with many stabs and lying in his blood-mottled nightgown
upon the carpet. Horrified at the sight he ran back into his berth and locked
the door, waiting in a helpless quiver of apprehension for the next move of the
mutineers. He may not have been of a very virile character, but the
circumstances were enough to shake the most stout-hearted. It is not an hour at
which a man is at his best, that chill hour of the opening dawn, and to have
seen the two men, with whom he had supped the night before, lying in their
blood, seems to have completely unnerved him. Shivering and weeping he listened
with straining ears for the footsteps which would be the forerunners of
death.</p>
<p>At last they came, and of half a dozen men at least, clumping heavily down
the brass-clamped steps of the companion. A hand beat roughly upon his door and
ordered him out. He knew that his frail lock was no protection, so he turned
the key and stepped forth. It might well have frightened a stouter man, for the
murderers were all there. Leon, Carlos, Santos, Blanco, Duranno, Watto,
dreadful looking folk most of them at the best of times, but now, armed with
their dripping knives and crimson cudgels, and seen in that dim morning light,
as terrible a group as ever a writer of romance conjured up in his imagination.
The Manila men stood in a silent semi-circle round the door, with their savage
Mongolian faces turned upon him.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with me?" he cried. "Are you going to kill me?" He
tried to cling to Leon as he spoke, for as the only one who could speak English
he had become the leader.</p>
<p>"No," said Leon. "We are not going to kill you. But we have killed the
captain and the mate. Nobody on board knows anything of navigation. You must
navigate us to where we can land."</p>
<p>The trembling mate, hardly believing the comforting assurance of safety,
eagerly accepted the commission.</p>
<p>"Where shall I navigate you to?" he asked.</p>
<p>There was a whispering in Spanish among the dark-faced men, and it was
Carlos who answered in broken English.</p>
<p>"Take up River Platte," said he. "Good country! Plenty Spanish!" And so it
was agreed.</p>
<p>And now a cold fit of disgust seemed to have passed through those callous
ruffians for they brought down mops and cleaned out the cabin. A rope was slung
round the captain and he was hauled on deck. Taffir, to his credit be it told,
interfering to impart some decency to the ceremony of his burial. "There goes
the captain!" cried Watto, the handsome Levantine lad, as he heard the splash
of the body. "He'll never call us names any more!" Then all hands were called
into the saloon with the exception of Candereau, the Frenchman, who remained at
the wheel. Those who were innocent had to pretend approval of the crime to save
their own lives. The captain's effects were laid out upon the table and divided
into seventeen shares. Watto insisted that it should only be eight shares, as
only eight were concerned in the mutiny, but Leon with greater sagacity argued
that everyone should be equally involved in the crime by taking their share of
the booty. There were money and clothes to divide, and a big box of boots which
represented some little commercial venture of the captain's. Everyone was
stamping about in a new pair. The actual money came to about ten pounds each
and the watch was set aside to be sold and divided later. Then the mutineers
took permanent possession of the cabin, the course of the ship was altered for
South America, and the ill-fated barque began the second chapter of her
infamous voyage.</p>
<p>The cargo had been breached and the decks were littered with open cases of
champagne, from which everyone helped himself as he pleased. There was a
fusillade of popping corks all day, and the air was full of the faint, sweet,
sickly smell of the wine. The second mate was nominally commander, but he was
commander without the power to command. From morning to night he was threatened
and insulted, and it was only Leon's interference and the well-grounded
conviction that they could never make the land without him, which saved him
from their daily menaces. They gave a zest to their champagne carousals by
brandishing their knives in his face. All the honest men were subjected to the
same treatment. Santos and Watto came to the Norwegian carpenter's whetstone to
sharpen their knives, explaining to him as they did so that they would soon use
them on his throat. Watto, the handsome lad, declared that he had already
killed sixteen men. He wantonly stabbed the inoffensive Chinese steward through
the fleshy part of the arm. Santos said to Candereau, the Frenchman, "In two or
three days I shall kill you."</p>
<p>"Kill me then!" cried Candereau with spirit.</p>
<p>"This knife," said the bully, "will serve you the same that it has the
captain."</p>
<p>There seems to have been no attempt upon the part of the nine honest men to
combine against the eight rogues. As they were all of different races and spoke
different languages it is not surprising that they were unable to make head
against the armed and unanimous mutineers.</p>
<p>And then there befell one of those incidents which break the monotony of
long sea voyages. The topsails of a ship showed above the horizon and soon
there rose her hull. Her course would take her across her bows, and the mate
asked leave to hail her, as he was doubtful as to his latitude.</p>
<p>"You may do so," said Leon. "But if you say a word about us you are a dead
man."</p>
<p>The strange ship hauled her yard aback when she saw that the other wished to
speak to her, and the two lay rolling in the Atlantic swell within a hundred
yards of each other.</p>
<p>"We are the <i>Friend,</i> of Liverpool," cried an officer. "Who are
you?"</p>
<p>"We are the <i>Louisa,</i> seven days out from Dieppe for Valparaiso,"
answered the unhappy mate, repeating what the mutineers whispered to him. The
longitude was asked and given, and the two vessels parted company. With
yearning eyes the harassed man looked at the orderly decks and the well served
officer of the Liverpool ship, while he in turn noticed with surprise those
signs of careless handling which would strike the eye of a sailor in the rig
and management of the <i>Flowery Land.</i> Soon the vessel was hull down upon
the horizon, and in an hour the guilty ship was again alone in the vast ring of
the ocean.</p>
<p>This meeting was very nearly being a fatal one to the mate, for it took all
Leon's influence to convince the other ignorant and suspicious seamen that they
had not been betrayed. But a more dangerous time still was before him. It must
have been evident to him that when they had made their landfall then was the
time when he was no longer necessary to the crew and when they were likely to
silence him forever. That which was their goal was likely to prove his death
warrant. Every day brought him nearer to this inevitable crisis, and then at
last on the night of the 2nd of October the look-out man reported land ahead.
The ship was at once put about, and in the morning the South American coast was
a dim haze upon the western horizon. When the mate came upon deck he found the
mutineers in earnest conclave about the forehatch, and their looks and gestures
told him that it was his fate which was being debated. Leon was again on the
side of mercy. "If you like to kill the carpenter and the mate, you can: I
shall not do it," said he. There was a sharp difference of opinion upon the
matter, and the poor, helpless mate waited, like a sheep near a knot of
butchers.</p>
<p>"What are they going to do with me?" he cried to Leon, but received no
reply. "Are they going to kill me?" he asked Marsolino.</p>
<p>"I am not, but Blanco is," was the discouraging reply.</p>
<p>However, the thoughts of the mutineers were happily diverted by other
things. First they ckwed up the sails and dropped the boats alongside. The mate
having been deposed from his command there was no commander at all, so that
everything was chaos. Some got into the boats and some remained upon the decks
of the vessel. The mate found himself in one boat which contained Watto, Paul
the Sclavonian, Early the ship's boy and the Chinese cook. They rowed a hundred
yards away from the ship, but were recalled by Blanco and Leon. It shows how
absolutely the honest men had lost their spirit, that though they were four to
one in this particular boat they meekly returned when they were recalled. The
Chinese cook was ordered on deck, and the others were allowed to float astern.
The unfortunate steward had descended into another boat, but Duranno pushed him
overboard. He swam for a long time begging hard for his life, but Leon and
Duranno pelted him with empty champagne bottles from the deck until one of them
struck him on the head and sent him to the bottom. The same men took Cassap,
the little Chinese boy, into the cabin. Candereau, the French sailor heard him
cry out: "Finish me quickly then!" and they were the last words that he ever
spoke.</p>
<p>In the meantime the carpenter had been led into the hold by the other
mutineers and ordered to scuttle the ship. He bored four holes forward and four
aft, and the water began to pour in. The crew sprang into the boats, one small
one, and one large one, the former in tow of the latter. So ignorant, and
thoughtless were they that they were lying alongside as the ship settled down
in the water, and would infallibly have been swamped if the mate had not
implored them to push off. The Chinese cook had been left on board, and had
clambered into the tops so that his gesticulating figure was almost the last
that was seen of the ill-omened <i>Flowery Land</i> as she settled down under
the leaping waves. Then the boats, well laden with plunder, made slowly for the
shore.</p>
<p>It was 4 in the afternoon upon the 4th of October that they ran their boats
upon the South American beach. It was a desolate spot, so they tramped inland,
rolling along with the gait of seamen ashore, their bundles upon their
shoulders. Their story was that they were the shipwrecked crew of an American
ship from Peru to Bordeaux. She had foundered a hundred miles out, and the
captain and officers were in another boat which had parted company. They had
been five days and nights upon the sea. Toward evening they came upon the
estancia of a lonely farmer to whom they told their tale, and from whom they
received every hospitality. Next day they were all driven over to the nearest
town of Rocha. Candereau and the mate got an opportunity of escaping that
night, and within twenty-four hours their story had been told to the
authorities and the mutineers were all in the hands of the police.</p>
<p>Of the twenty men who had started from London in the <i>Flowery Land</i> six
had met their deaths from violence. There remained fourteen, of whom eight were
mutineers, and six were destined to be the witnesses against them. No more
striking example could be given of the long arm and steel hand of the British
law than that within a few months this mixed crew, Sclavonian, negro, Manila
men, Norwegian, Turk and Frenchman, gathered on the shore of the distant
Argentine, were all brought face to face at the Central Criminal Court in the
heart of London town.</p>
<p>The trial excited great attention on account of the singular crew and the
monstrous nature of their crimes. The death of the officers did less to rouse
the prejudice of the public and to influence the jury than the callous murder
of the unoffending Chinaman. The great difficulty was that of apportioning the
blame amongst so many men and of determining which had really been active in
the shedding of blood. Taffir, the mate: Early, the ship's boy: Candereau, the
Frenchman, and Anderson, the carpenter, all gave their evidence, some
incriminating one and some another. After a very careful trial five of them,
Leon, Blanco, Watto, Duranno and Lopez, were condemned to death. They were all
Manila men, with the exception of Watto, who came from the Levant. The oldest
of the prisoners was only five and twenty years of age. They took their
sentence in a perfectly callous fashion, and immediately before it was
pronounced Leon and Watto laughed heartily because Duranno had forgotten the
statement which he had intended to make. One of the prisoners who had been
condemned to imprisonment was at once heard to express a hope that he might be
allowed to have Blanco's boots.</p>
<p>The sentence of the law was carried out in front of Newgate upon the 22nd of
February. Five ropes jerked convulsively for an instant, and the tragedy of the
<i>Flowery Land</i> had reached its fitting consummation.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>AN IMPRESSION OF THE REGENCY</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly</i>, Aug 1900<br>
First book appearance in <i>The Unknown Conan Doyle</i>, 1929</h3>
<hr>
<p>IT was in those stormy days of the early century when England, in an age of
heroes and buffoons, had turned in her intervals of prize-fighting and horse-
racing, Almack balls and Carlton House scandals, to grasp the sceptre of the
seas, and to push Napoleon's veterans out of the Peninsula. The practical
jokers of St. James Street and the gamblers of Watier's were of the same blood
and class as the exquisites of Wellington or the Foleys and Balls whose
foppishness aroused the anger of Nelson until their gallantry extorted his
admiration. A singular effeminacy and a desperate recklessness alternated in
the same individual, and the languid lounger of the evening was easily stirred
into the fierce duellist of the morning. Amid this strange society of brutality
and sentiment there moved the portly figure of George, the Prince and Regent,
monstrous on account of his insignificance and interesting for the inhuman
absence of any points of interest. Weak and despicable, a liar and a coward, he
still in some inexplicable way catches the attention of posterity as he did of
his own contemporaries, and draws the eye away from better men.</p>
<p>George the King was in his second and more fatal period of madness while
George the Prince waited for his heritage and filled his father's place. Twice
a year the Regent should go to Windsor where the lunatic was kept, and satisfy
himself as to his condition. It was a formality, but in the strange lumbering
British constitution formalities are the ultimate rulers of all things, with
Kings, Lords and Commons groaning under their tyranny. And so, sorely against
his will, the weak foolish man abandoned his Brighton palace and drove
northwards to fulfill his odious duty at the Castle.</p>
<p>But he did not go alone. He was no lover of solitude at any time, and least
of all when his work might be done or lightened by others. Sir Charles
Tregellis shared his coach&mdash;Tregellis the arbiter of fashions, the gentle
duellist, the languid rake, the weary gambler, the masterful lounger whose
drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes could dominate the most high-blooded
buck in Watier's or in Brooks'. Lord Yarmouth was with them, the foxy-haired
red-whiskered sportsman, and all day they drove through the weald of Sussex and
over the uplands of Surrey until in the evening, ankle deep in playing cards,
they saw the Thames wind through green meadows, and the huge dark bulk of the
Windsor towers loom black against the gold and carmine of a September sunset.
Another coach and yet another were on the London road, for it had been given
out that the Regent had need of company and his friends were rallying to his
call.</p>
<p>Why should the Prince see his father? It was enough to have paid his formal
visit and to have received the reports of Doctor John Willis and his son. To
the Regent an unpleasant duty meant a duty to be evaded. He had seen his father
once, and he had never forgotten it. It came to him still, that memory, when he
lay restless at night, and not all his little glasses of maraschino could
banish it from his mind. The royal state had always seemed so fenced in from
unpleasantness of every kind! The whole world conspired to keep trouble away.
But Nature would not join in the conspiracy. Nature was rough, brutal,
unreasonable. This Prince had never heard one harsh or reproving word in all
his life, save only from this stern old man, his father, and from the dreadful
unutterable German woman whom he had married. Once or twice when the Commons
had been asked to pay his debts there had been unpleasant speeches, but then he
did not hear them and they only reached his ears in the mildest and least
irritating form. Sycophants and courtiers filtered everything from the outer
world. And now into this sheltered life, weakened and softened by indulgence,
there came the brutal realities of disease. The King himself, the one man whose
position was more august than his own, was struck into puling childish
imbecility. George's craven heart quailed at the sight of the foolish garrulous
old man for ever pouring forth a ceaseless gabble of meaningless words. It
brought home to him that there was a higher law against which all his
prerogatives were vain. He shrank now from such an experience, and his
quarters, with those of his friends, were placed at that wing of the Castle
which was furthest from the chambers of the King.</p>
<p>There were twelve of them at supper that night, and they sat late over the
wine. The Prince drank deeply to clear away the weight which lay upon his
spirits. This house of royal suffering cast its gloom upon him. And the others
drank as much or more than he out of sympathy with their royal comrade, and
because it was their good pleasure and the custom of the time. Sheridan, of the
inflamed face and the ready tongue; Hertford, the husband of the reigning
favorite; Yarmouth, his son; Theodore Hook, the jester; Tregellis, whose pale
cheek flushed into comeliness upon a fourth bottle; Mountford, with the lewd
eyes and the perfect cravat; Mackinnon, of the Guards; Banbury, who shot Sir
Charles Williams behind Chalk Farm&mdash;these were the men who, out of all the
virtue and wisdom of England, had in his fiftieth year gathered as intimates
round the English Prince.</p>
<p>He lay back in his chair, as the decanters circulated, his eyes glazed and
his face flushed. His waistcoat was partly undone and his ruffled shirt came
bursting through the gaps. Laziness and liquors had made him very fat, but he
carried himself in his official duties with a dignified solemnity. Now in his
hour of relaxation the dignity was gone and he lolled, a coarse, swollen man,
at the head of his table. At supper he had been amusing. He had two genuine
gifts, the one for telling a story and the other for singing a song, and, had
he been a commoner, he had still been a good companion. But his brain had
softened and he was at a disadvantage with the seasoned men around him. A
little wine would make him excited, a little more, maudlin, and then it was but
a short step to irresponsibility. Already he had lost all sense of decency and
restraint. He raged between his glasses at his brothers, at his wife, at the
Princess Charlotte, his daughter, at the Whigs, the cursed Whigs, who would not
come to heel, at the Commons who would not vote him the money for which his
duns were clamoring&mdash;at everything and every-body as far as they had ever
stood in the way of his ever-varying whims. The baser of the company urged him
onwards by their ready sympathy) * others looked downwards at their glasses, or
raised their critical eyebrows * they glanced across at each other. And then,
in yet another stage of his exaltation, he lied with palpably absurd
vainglorious lies which sprang from that same family taint which had laid his
father low. Always behind the pampered, foolish Sybarite there loomed the
shadow of madness.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, he has done well enough," said he, for the talk had turned upon
the recent victories of Wellington in the Peninsula. "He has done well enough,
but he is lucky in those who serve him. Now, at Salamanca&mdash;"</p>
<p>They all glanced furtively at each other, for the delusion was well known to
them.</p>
<p>"At Salamanca," he continued pompously, "where would he have been if the
heavies had not charged? And why did the heavies charge?"</p>
<p>"Because your Highness gave the order," said some sycophant.</p>
<p>"Ah ha, the thing has become public, then?" said he exultantly. "York tried
to hush it up and so did Wellington, d&mdash;&mdash;d jealous of me, both of
them&mdash;but truth will come out.</p>
<p>"'Le Marchant,' said I, 'if the heavies don't charge, the game is up.'</p>
<p>"'We cannot charge unshaken infantry,' said he.</p>
<p>"'Then by God, sir, I can and I will,' said I. I rammed my spurs into my
charger&mdash;a big black he was, with white stockings&mdash;and we went right
into them. You can vouch for the story, Tregellis."</p>
<p>"I can vouch for the story," said Sir Charles, with an emphasis upon the
last word, which caused a titter.</p>
<p>"Sir Charles expresses himself cautiously," said Mountford, eager to pose as
champion of the Prince. "He will, no doubt, vouch for the fact as well."</p>
<p>"I had not the honor to be there," said Sir Charles wearily. "It is strange,
Lord Mountford, that you should ask for a voucher for anything which the Prince
has cited as a fact."</p>
<p>Mountford's point had been turned against his own breast so adroitly that
the befuddled Prince had not perceived it. He frowned darkly at his champion,
and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Have you any doubts of the truth of what I have said, Lord Mountford? Eh,
sir? What?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least, sir."</p>
<p>"Then I must ask you, sir, to be more guarded in your language," he pouted
like an angry child, and Mountford flushed from his curling hair to his
speckless, many-wreathed cravat.</p>
<p>"Do you return early to town, Sir Charles?" he asked quickly, when the hum
of conversation had been resumed.</p>
<p>"I shall still be here at seven," said Sir Charles, smiling gently.</p>
<p>"I shall walk in the Eton meadows," said Mountford bowing.</p>
<p>It was the last walk he ever made without a stick. But the company cared
nothing for a quarrel so discreetly conducted. The Prince was telling a story.
He missed the point, but they guffawed with outrageous merriment. Hook capped
it with another which was all point but met with a languid murmur of approval.
The talk turned upon racing, why Sam Chifney had been warned off the turf and
why the Regent had abandoned Newmarket. There were drunken tears in his dull
eyes as he told how scandalously he had been treated. And then it passed on to
prize-fighting. Yarmouth was a patron of the ring, and told of Gregson, the
North Country giant whom he had seen in Ward's ordinary in St. Martin's Lane.
His father bet a hundred guineas against him in the coming fight, and the
family wager was booked amidst shoutings and laughter. Then the talk came back
to the never failing topic of women, and it was seen how a coarse and material
age could debase the minds of men, and soil the daintiest of subjects. A shadow
of disgust passed over the pale face of Tregellis as he listened to the
hiccoughed reminiscences of the maudlin Regent.</p>
<p>"By-the-way, sir," said he, adroitly changing the subject, "has your
Highness heard of the vogue which Captain Mackinnon has obtained? No function
is &agrave; la mode without his exploit. Even Lady Lieven swears that the next
ball at Ahnack's will not be complete unless he goes round the room upon the
route chairs and the instruments of the musicians."</p>
<p>The jaded appetite of the Regent needed eternal novelties to stimulate it.
Hook had risen from the depths to the surface on account of his
originality&mdash;an originality which was already losing its freshness.
Everyone who had any talent or peculiarity, however grotesque, was brought to
Brighton. Mackinnon had never before been in the presence, and his fresh young
soldier face was suffused with blushes at the words of Tregellis. The Regent
looked at him with his glazed eyes.</p>
<p>"Let me see, I heard of you, sir, but I am d&mdash;&mdash;d if I can call to
mind what you can do. Didn't you kill a cat with your teeth at the Cockpit? No,
that was Ingleston. Or are you the man who imitates a coach horn? No, by
George, I've got it! you're the furniture man."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Go round any room in London on the furniture&mdash;never been
beaten&mdash;haw! haw! Well, it's close enough here, and any child could do
it."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Mackinnon. "It would be easy here."</p>
<p>"They tried to beat him at Lady Cunningham's," cried Banbury. "They had but
four chairs and a settee, but he climbed up the window and scrambled round the
picture rod. He takes some pounding, I tell you."</p>
<p>The Regent glanced round at the furniture, and staggering to his feet, he
pulled off his plum-colored silken coat.</p>
<p>"Coats off, gentlemen!" said he, and in an instant, young and old, they were
all in their white cambric shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>"We'll all do it," said he. "Every man Jack of us. By gad, Captain
Mackinnon, we'll play you at your own game. 'Pon my life, a little exercise
will harm none of us. Now, sir, give us a lead! You next, Banbury! You,
Yarmouth! You, Hertford! Then myself! And so, as we sit! And the man who is
pounded shall drink a claret glass of maraschino for a punishment."</p>
<p>It was an idiotic spectacle, and yet one which was characteristic of an age
when, in the highest circles, any form of ludicrous eccentricity was a more
sure pass to popularity and success than wisdom or brilliancy. If wise and
brilliant men&mdash;a Fox, or a Sheridan&mdash;<i>did</i> succeed in such
circles, it was by reason of their vices rather than of their virtues. A
Wordsworth or a Coleridge would have been powerless before a rival who crowed
like a cock or had a boundless invention for practical jokes. So it was that
Mackinnon, with his absurd accomplishment, had taken London society by storm
and shot over the heads of his superior officers into the select circle which
shared the amusements and the vices of the repulsive George.</p>
<p>Mackinnon, a little flurried at this strange game of follow-my-leader for
which he was to he responsible, had risen from his chair. He was a tall, thin,
supple lad, with a wiry, active figure, which bore out his reputation for
gymnastic skill. But there was nothing here to test his powers. As the Prince
had remarked, any one could, with a little address, have made the circuit of
the room without touching the floor, for the furniture was massive and
abundant. From a chair he stepped onto the long brown oaken sideboard, strewn
with fruit and plate. Walking along it, he found himself some few feet from an
armchair, onto which he sprang. The others followed with shouts and
cheers&mdash;some as active and light as himself, some stout from good living
and unsteady from wine, but all entering eagerly into the royal joke. The
courtly Banbury sprang with languid grace from the sideboard to the armchair,
and, landing on the arm, rolled with it upon the ground, George, balanced among
the dishes and wine-coolers upon the sideboard, laughed until he had to hold on
to a picture to keep from falling. When he, in his turn, sprang onto the chair
his two feet went through the bottom, amid shrieks of delight from his
companions. "Hark forrard! Hark forrard!" cried Hook; and Mountford "yoicked"
like a huntsman. Onto the broken chair they bounded, one after another, until
it was a bundle of splinters and upholstery. From there, with all the yapping
and clamor of a hunt, they scrambled over a cabinet, and so along a chain of
chairs that ended at the broad marble mantelpiece. Here was indeed a perilous
passage; nothing but a high pier glass upon one side, and a five-foot drop into
an ornamental fender upon the other. Mackinnon tripped over, and then Banbury,
Yarmouth, Hertford and the Prince, the last pawing nervously at the glass with
fat, moist hands which left their blurred marks across it. He had shuffled his
unwieldy bulk almost into safety, when suddenly the shoutings and the cheerings
died away, and a strange silence fell upon the rioters. Another sound, which
had grown louder upon their ears, hushed their foolish outcry.</p>
<p>It was a long, monotonous, bellowing call; a strangely animal uproar; one
deep note repeated again and again, but rising in volume to a retching whoop.
For some minutes Tregellis and others had been conscious of the sinister
clamor; but now it grew louder with every instant, as if some wandering heifer
were lowing down the corridor and rapidly approaching the door of their dining
room. It was so overpoweringly loud that it boomed through all their riot and
reduced them to a startled silence. For it was an extraordinary noise, animal
in sound, but human in origin&mdash;a grim, mindless hooting which struck cold
into their hearts. They looked from one to the other, the grotesque line of
coatless men, balanced upon the tables and the chairs. Who could it be who
howled thus down the royal corridor? The question flashed from eye to eye, and
it was the bloodless lips of George which found the answer. He had descended to
a chair and stood there with frightened, staring eyes fixed upon the door.
Outside there rang one last terrific whoop, as the door was flung open, and the
mad King stood mewing and gabbling in the opening.</p>
<p>He was in a gray dressing gown, with red slippers protruding beneath. His
white hair was ruffled, a white beard fell over his chest, and his huge,
protruding eyes rolled round him with the anxious eagerness of a purblind man.
For a moment he stood thus, his hand upon the door, a piteous, venerable
figure. Then the white beard dropped, the mouth opened wide, and again that
discordant, horrible, long-drawn cry boomed through the room. At the same
instant the frightened roisterers saw moving figures in the corridor over his
shoulder, the startled faces of hurrying doctors, and heard the patter and
rustle of their feet. Eager hands clutched at the old King, he was plucked
backwards, and the door slammed behind his struggling, screaming form. There
was a heavy thud within the dining room. Tregellis sprang for the brandy
decanter.</p>
<p>"Loosen his shirt," said he; "hold up his head." And a little group of
flushed, half-drunken men propped up the gross and senseless form of the heir-
apparent.</p>

<hr>
<p>[Being the fragment of a letter from Sulpicius Balbus, Legate of the Tenth
Legion, to his uncle, Lucius Piso, in his villa near Bai&aelig;, dated The
Kalends of the month of Augustus in the year 824 of Rome.]</p>
<p>I promised you, my dear uncle, that I would tell you anything of interest
concerning the siege of Jerusalem; but, indeed, these people whom we imagined
to be unwarlike have kept us so busy that there has been little time for
letter- writing. We came to Jud&aelig;a thinking that a mere blowing of
trumpets and a shout would finish the affair, and picturing a splen&shy;did
triumph in the via sacra to follow, with all the girls in Rome throwing flowers
and kisses to us. Well, we may get our triumph, and pos&shy;sibly the kisses
also, but I can assure you that not even you who have seen such hard service on
the Rhine can ever have experienced a more severe campaign than this has been.
We have now won the town, and to-day their temple is burning, and the smoke
sets me coughing as I sit writing in my tent. Put it has been a terri&shy;ble
business, and I am sure none of us wish to see Jud&aelig;a again.</p>
<p>In fighting the Gauls, or the Germans, you are against brave men, animated
by the love of their country. This passion acts more, how&shy;ever, upon some
than others, so that the whole army is not equally inflamed by it. These Jews,
however, besides their love of country, which is very strong, have a desperate
religious fer&shy;vour, which gives them a fury in battle such as none of us
have ever seen. They throw them&shy;selves with a shriek of joy upon our swords
and lances, as if death were all that they de&shy;sired.</p>
<p>If one gets past your guard may Jove protect you, for their knives are
deadly, and if it comes to a hand-to-hand grapple they are as danger&shy;ous as
wild beasts, who would claw out your eyes or your throat. You know that our
fel&shy;lows of the Tenth Legion have been, ever since C&aelig;sar's time, as
rough soldiers as any with the Eagles, but I can assure you that I have seen
them positively cowed by the fury of these fanatics. As a matter of fact we
have had least to bear, for it has been our task from the beginning to guard
the base of the peninsula upon which this extraordinary town is built. It has
steep precipices upon all the other sides, so that it is only on this one
northern base that fugitives could escape or a rescue come. Mean&shy;while, the
fifth, fifteenth, and the twelfth or Syrian legions have done the work,
together with the auxiliaries. Poor devils! we have often pitied them, and
there have been times when it was difficult to say whether we were attacking
the town or the town was attacking us. They broke down our tortoises with their
stones, burned our turrets with their fire, and dashed right through our whole
camp to de&shy;stroy the supplies in the rear. If any man says a Jew is not a
good soldier, you may be sure that he has never been in Jud&aelig;a.</p>
<p>However, all this has nothing to do with what I took up my stylus to tell
you. No doubt it is the common gossip of the forum and of the baths how our
army, excellently handled by the princely Titus, carried one line of wall af
ter the other until we had only the temple before us. This, however, is&mdash;
or was, for I see it burning even as I write&mdash;a very strong fortress.
Romans have no idea of the mag&shy;nificence of this place. The temple of which
I speak is a far finer building than any we have in Rome, and so is the Palace,
built by Herod or Agrippa, I really forget which. This temple is two hundred
paces each way, with stones so fitted that the blade of a knife will not go
be&shy;tween, and the soldiers say there is gold enough within to fill the
pockets of the whole army. This idea puts some fury into the attack, as you can
believe, but with these flames I fear a great deal of the plunder will be
lost.</p>
<p>There was a great fight at the temple, and it was rumoured that it would be
carried by storm to-night, so I went out on to the rising ground whence one
sees the city best. I wonder, uncle, if in your many campaigns you have ever
smelt the smell of a large beleaguered town. The wind was south to-night, and
this terrible smell of death came straight to our nostrils. There were half a
million people there, and every form of disease, starvation, decomposition,
filth and horror, all pent in within a narrow compass. You know how the lion
sheds smell behind the Circus Maximus, acid and foul. It is like that, but
there is a low, deadly, subtle odour which lies beneath it and makes your very
heart sink within you. Such was the smell which came up from the city to-
night.</p>
<p>As I stood in the darkness, wrapped in my scarlet chlamys&mdash;for the
evenings here are chill&mdash;I was suddenly aware that I was not alone. A
tall, silent figure was near me, looking down at the town even as I was. I
could see in the moonlight that he was clad as an officer, and as I approached
him I recognized that it was Longinus, third tribune of my own legion, and a
soldier of great age and experience. He is a strange, silent man, who is
respected by all, but understood by none, for he keeps his own council and
thinks rather than talks. As I approached him the first flames burst from the
temple, a high column of fire, which cast a glow upon our faces and gleamed
upon our armour. In this red light I saw that the gaunt face of my companion
was set like iron.</p>
<p>"At last!" said he. "At last!"</p>
<p>He was speaking to himself rather than to me, for he started and seemed
confused when I asked him what he meant.</p>
<p>"I have long thought that evil would come to the place," said he. "Now I see
that it has come, and so I said 'At last!'"</p>
<p>"For that matter," I answered, "we have all seen that evil would come to the
place, since it has again and again defied the authority of the
C&aelig;sars."</p>
<p>He looked keenly at me with a question in his eyes. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I have heard, sir, that you are one who has a ftill sympathy in the matter
of the gods, be&shy;lieving that every man should worship accord&shy;ing to his
own conscience and belief."</p>
<p>I answered that I was a Stoic of the school of Seneca, who held that this
world is a small matter and that we should care little for its fortunes, but
develop within ourselves a con&shy;tempt for all but the highest.</p>
<p>He smiled in grim fashion at this.</p>
<p>"I have heard," said he, "that Seneca died the richest man in all Nero's
Empire, so he made the best of this world in spite of his philosophy."</p>
<p>"What are your own beliefs?" I asked. "Are you, perhaps, one who has
fathomed the mys&shy;teries of Isis, or been admitted to the Society of
Mythra?"</p>
<p>"Have you ever heard," he asked, "of the Christians?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said I. "There were some slaves and wandering men in Rome who called
themselves such. They worshipped, so far as I could gather, some man who died
over here in Jud&aelig;a. He was put to death, I believe, in the time of
Tiberius."</p>
<p>"That is so," he answered. "It was at the time when Pilate was procurator
&mdash;Pontius Pilate, the brother of old Lucius Pilate, who had Egypt in the
time of Augustus. Pilate was of two minds in the matter, but the mob was as
wild and savage as these very men that we have been contending with. Pilate
tried to put them off with a criminal, hoping that so long as they had blood
they would be satisfied. But they chose the other, and he was not strong enough
to withstand them. Ah! it was a pity&mdash;a sad pity!"</p>
<p>"You seem to know a good deal about it," said I.</p>
<p>"I was there," said the man simply, and be&shy;came silent, while we both
looked down at the huge column of flame from the burning temple. As it flared
up we could see the white tents of the army and all the country round. There
was a low hill just outside the city, and my companion pointed to it.</p>
<p>"That was where it happened," said he. "I forget the name of the place, but
in those days&mdash;it was more than thirty years ago&mdash;they put their
criminals to death there. But He was no criminal. It is always His eyes that I
think of&mdash;the look in His eyes."</p>
<p>"What about the eyes, then?"</p>
<p>"They have haunted me ever since. I see them now. All the sorrow of earth
seemed mir&shy;rored in them. Sad, sad, and yet such a deep, tender pity! One
would have said that it was He who needed pity had you seen His poor battered,
disfigured face. But He had no thought for Himself&mdash;it was the great world
pity that looked out of His gentle eyes. There was a noble maniple of the
legion there, and not a man among them who did not wish to charge the howling
crowd who were dragging such a man to His death."</p>
<p>"What were you doing there?"</p>
<p>"I was junior Centurion, with the gold vine-&shy;rod fresh on my shoulders.
I was on duty on the hill, and never had a job that I liked less.</p>
<p>But discipline has to be observed, and Pilate had given the order. But I
thought at the time&mdash;and I was not the only one&mdash;that this man's name
and work would not be forgotten, and that there would be a curse on the place
that had done such a deed. There was an old woman there, His mother, with her
grey hair down her back. I remember how she shrieked when one of our fellows
with his lance put Him out of his pain. And a few others, women and men, poor
and ragged, stood by Him. But, you see, it has turned out as I thought. Even in
Rome, as you have observed, His followers have appeared."</p>
<p>"I rather fancy," said I, "that I am speak&shy;ing to one of them."</p>
<p>"At least, I have not forgotten," said he. "I have been in the wars ever
since with little time far study. But my pension is overdue, and when I have
changed the sagum for the toga, and the tent for some little farm up Como way,
then I shall look more deeply into these things, if, perchance, I can find some
one to in&shy;struct me."</p>
<p>And so I left him. I only tell you all this because I remember that you took
an interest in the man, Paulus, who was put to death for preaching this
religion. You told me that it had reached C&aelig;sar's palace, and I can tell
you now that it has reached C&aelig;sar's soldiers as well. But apart from this
matter I wish to tell you some of the adventures which we have had recently in
raiding for food among the hills, which stretch as far south as the river
Jordan. The other day&hellip;</p>

<hr>
<p>IT WAS a winter evening, and as I sat by a dwindling fire in the twilight,
my mind hit upon a strange line of thought. Mulling over the great crises of
history, I could see that the chief actor in each had always come to a dividing
of the ways where it was within his choice to take the one path or the other.
He took the one, and the annals tell us what came of it. But suppose that he
had taken the other? Is it possible for the human imagination to follow up the
course of events which would have resulted from that? A series of fascinating
alternatives passed through my brain, each involving a problem of its own. Had
Caesar remained faithful as a general of the republic, and refused to cross the
Rubicon, would not the whole story or Imperial Rome have been avoided? Had
Washington persuaded his fellow countrymen to wait patiently until a liberal
majority in the British Parliament righted their wrongs, would not Britain and
all her Dominions now be an annex to the great central power of America? If
Napoleon had msde peace before entering upon the Russian campaign&mdash;and so
on, and so on.</p>
<p>As I brooded thus, a modern instance came into my mind, and so, half
sleeping, and with my eyes fixed upon the red embers, there came a series of
pictures, a vision, if one may so call it, which, with realistic detail duly
added, might be traruslated into some such narrative as this:</p>
<p>It was a dull November day in the little Belgian town of Spa. It was very
easy to see that some great event had occurred&mdash;some event which had
stirred the townspeople to their depth. Business had ceased, and they stood in
excited, gossiping groups along the sidewalks. Among them there wandered great
numbers or German soldiers in their gray-green uniforms, some of them so worn
with service that they presented every shade of color. These men were as
excited aa the civilians, and choked the streets with their noisy,
gesticulating assemblies. Boys carrying newspapers rushed wildly here and
there. The whole place waa like an ants' nest stirred up suddenly by some
intrusive stick. Suddenly the groups fell apart to give space for a huge motor
car, containing four officers and two civilians, who were clearly men of
importance, to judge by the attention which they excited. The lionlike face
which looked fiercely out at the undisciplined groups of soldiers was one which
was familiar to every bystander, since Spa had been for so long the center of
German military activity. It was old Marshal von Berg himself. Beside him, lost
in thought. sat a high naval officer, his clean-shaven race seamed with furrows
of care. It was the famoua Admiral von Speer. Two other high generals and two
statesmen fresh from Berlin completed the group. The car roared down the main
street, turned hard to the right, swung round between the pillars of an
ornamental gate, and halted presently before the stucccoed front of the Villa
Froneuse. Sentries on either side of the door presented arms, a red-plushed
butler appeared in the opening, and the illustrious deputation vanished into
the house, while curious faces and staring eyes lined the railing, for it was
rumored that some eventful decision was to be reached that day, and that the
moment of fate had arrived.</p>
<p>The deputation was ushered into the large hall, decorated in white and gold,
and from the end of it they entered a spacious lounge, or study, where they
seated themselves round a table.</p>
<p>"The Emperor waa expecting you," said the butler. "He will be with you
presently." He walked silently, as one who is at a funeral, and closed the door
gently.</p>
<p>The party waa clearly ill at ease. They looked at one another in a
questioning way. It was the naval officer who broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would be best, sir, if you opened the matter," said he to the
great soldier. "His Majesty knows that what you advise comes from a loyal
heart."</p>
<p>"Do you imply, admiral, that our advice is anything but loyal?" asked one of
the Berlin statesmen.</p>
<p>The admiral shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"You come from the center of disturbance. For the moment we can trust
nothing from Berlin. We only know that forces behind the line have brought our
affairs to ruin."</p>
<p>"If you mean to say&mdash;" cried the civilian hotly, but Von Berg
interrupted with a wave of his arm.</p>
<p>"We have had discussion enough," he growled. "But I am a soldier, not a
talker. Do you speak, Von Stein, and we will check what you say."</p>
<p>"It is no pleasant task," answered the civilian, a large, heavy, blond man
with a flowing yellow beard. "Still, if you so desire it&mdash;"</p>
<p>The door opened and a man entered. The six men round the table sprang to
their feet and their heels all clicked together. The Emperor bowed stiffly, and
motioned that they should be seated. His keen gray eyes glanced from the face
of one to the other, as if to gather what their message might be. Then, with a
wry smile, he seated himself alone at the farther end of the table.</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "I hear that you have been determining the fate
of your Emperor. May I ask the result of your deliberations?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," said Von Stein in answer, "we have carefully considered the
situation, and we are all of one mind. We feel that Your Majesty's safety is
endangered if you remain here. We cannot answer for what may happen."</p>
<p>The Emperor shrugged. "If Germany falls, it can matter little what happens
to individuals," said he.</p>
<p>"Germany may stumble, Your Majesty, but she can never fall. Sixty millions
of people cannot be wiped from the map. There will soon come a period of
reconstruction, and who can say how necessary the presence of Your Majesty may
be at such a time?"</p>
<p>"What are your views, field marshal," the Emperor asked.</p>
<p>Von Berg shrugged his massive shoulders and shook his head
disconsolately.</p>
<p>"I have had reports from the seven armies today, Your Majesty. The greater
part of the soldiers are still ready to fight the enemy. They refuse, however,
to fight their own comrades, snd many of the battalions are out of hand."</p>
<p>"And the navy, admiral?"</p>
<p>"It is hopeless, Your Majesty. The red flag flies on every ship in Kiel and
Wilhelmshaven. The officers have been set ashore. There is little violence, but
the Soviets command the vessels."</p>
<p>"And the civilians, Herr von Stein?"</p>
<p>"They will support the war no longer, Your Majesty. They are weary of it
all, and they ask only for peace."</p>
<p>"Do they realize the consequencee if we lay down our arms? "</p>
<p>"Erzberger and his party are at the French headquarters making such terms as
they can. Perhaps. sire, it may not be so bad as you think."</p>
<p>"We need not deceive ourselves. We have only to ask ourselves what our own
terms would have been had we been the victors. It means the loss of our fleet,
of our colonies, and of all that was built up under my care in the last
twenty-five years. And why, why, has this terrible thing come upon us?"</p>
<p>"Because the nation behind the line has failed us."</p>
<p>"But why has it failed us?" There was a cold gleam of anger in the Emperor's
eyes, and he looked from one to the other for an answer.</p>
<p>"They were tried too hard, Your Majesty. There is a limit to human
endurance. They could go no further."</p>
<p>"It is false!" cried the Emperor hotly, and he struck the table with his
hand. "It is because you did not trust them. It is because they were forever
misinformed, as I was misinformed, so that they lost all confidence in you and
me and everyone."</p>
<p>"Misinformed, Your Majesty?"</p>
<p>"Yes, misinformed at every turn. I might well use a stronger word. I am not
accusing you individuaJly, gentlemen. I speak of the various services which you
represent; though indeed you are yourselves not guiltless in the matter, and
you have helped, each of you, to supply me with information which was false, so
that all my plans were built upon an unsound foundation. We might have had
peace with honor at any time, had I known all that I know now."</p>
<p>The members of the council moved uneasily in their seatd. It WllB the second
civilian, a smal1, dark, bristle-haired man, clean-cut and alert like a
well-hred terrier, who was the first to speak. "Your Majesty may perhaps be
putting blame upon us which might be justly borne by more august ahoulders,"
said he.</p>
<p>"Be silent," said Von Berg roughly. "We want none of your Berlin insolence
here."</p>
<p>"We want the truth, which the Emperor has so seldom had in the past!" cried
the radical deputy. "Has he not told us so himself? Has not everyone said what
would please him rather than what is true, and has he not been too confiding
and complaisant in accepting such assurances?"</p>
<p>"Enough, Brunner!" cried the admiral angrily. "We are here to hear the
Emperor, not to listen to speeches from the left bench... But, Your Majesty.
your accusation is a grave one. How and when have your counselors failed
you?"</p>
<p>"At every turn," said the Emperor bitterly. "There is hardly one vital
promise ever made to me or to the nation which has not proved to be false. Take
your own service, Admiral von Speer. Is it not a fact that your authorities
assured us that if we had indiscriminate U-boat warfare from February, 1917,
onwards, we must starve England out, and so win? Was it not said again and
again? Now it is November, 1918, and where is the starvation of England?"</p>
<p>"Events were too strong for us, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"A wise counselor foresees events. And you, Von Berg, did not you and
Ludendorff assure me that when the Russians broke away and our Eastern armies
were available for action in the West, we would drive the French behind Paris
and the British into the sea?"</p>
<p>"We nearly did so, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"There was no qualification in your assurances. You all declared that it
would be so. And did not every military leader assure me in 1914 that the
Britiah might be disregarded upon the land, and yet these papers"&mdash;he beat
upon a wallet which lay upon the table&mdash;"show me that in the last four
months they have taken from us more prisoners and guns than all the Allies put
together. Can you excuse such miscalculations as that?"</p>
<p>The great soldier sank his eyes.</p>
<p>"I have never underrated the British," he said.</p>
<p>"But my advisers did. And the Americans! Did not my statesmen say that they
would not come into the war? Did not my sailors say that they could not bring
an army to Europe? Did not my soldiers say that they had no army to bring? And
now"&mdash;he caught up the wal1et and ahook it at the council&mdash;" they
have over a million men available, and there are American naval guns which are
sweeping the roads between Montmedy and Conflans, the only line of retreat of
my Eastern armies... This could not happen. That could not happen. But it has
all happened. Is it a wonder that the people should lose heart when every
promise is broken?"</p>
<p>A thin, austere general in spectacles, who had not yet spoken, now joined in
the debate. His voice was cold, harsh and precise; a man of definite routine
and fixed ideas.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, any recriminations now are out of place. The question is
immediate and pressing. There are Bolsheviks within fifteen miles of Spa, and
if you should fall into their hands, no one can foresee the consequences. Your
life is in danger and the responlibility for your person rests with us."</p>
<p>"What, then, do you advise, General von Groner?"</p>
<p>"We are unanimous, sir, that you should at once cross the Dutch border.
General von Hentz suggested it. It is but a few miles, and your own special
train waits in the station."</p>
<p>"And where should I go when I cross the border?"</p>
<p>"We have gone so far, Your Majesty, as to telegraph to the Dutch Government.
We have not yet received a reply. But we cannot wait. Your own train affords
every accommodation and carries your personal servants. All else can be settled
later. Let us hear you are at Eyden, and our minds will be at ease."</p>
<p>The Emperor sat for some little time in silence.</p>
<p>"Would this not appear," said he at last, "as if I were deserting my people
and my army at a moment of need? There is my personal honor to be
considered."</p>
<p>"So long, sire, as you are acting upon the advice of your council, you can
hardly be called to account," said Von Groner.</p>
<p>"A man's honor is his own private affair, and no one can lessen his
responlibility," the Emperor answered. "I think that I may now dismiss you,
gentlemen. You have advised me to the best of your ability, and the rest
remains with me. If you will wait, Von Berg, and you, admiral, I would have a
last word with you."</p>
<p>The others bowed and filed out from the room. The Emperor advanced toward
his two great servants, both of whom had risen to their feet.</p>
<p>"In you," he said, placing his hand upon the old field marshal's sleeve,
"and in you, admiral, I recognize two men who represent the honor of my army
and my navy. You, of all men, are judges upon such a point. Tell me now, as
between man and man, since there is no longer any question of Emperor and
subject, would you advise me to go to Holland?"</p>
<p>"We would," the two men said in a breath.</p>
<p>"Would you consider that in doing so my honor was quite untouched?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, Your Majesty. We have now to treat for terms. The American
President has ventured to say that he will not treat with you. Everything will
be at a deadlock until you go. You are best serving the country by sacrificing
your own feelings and vanishing from the scene."</p>
<p>The Emperor pondered for a minute or more, with his brows drawn down over
his eyes and a deep frown of concentrated thought upon his face. At last he
broke silence:</p>
<p>"Let us go back a hundred years for our leason. Suppose the Emperor Napoleon
had refused to give himself up or resign: what would have followed?"</p>
<p>"A hopelesa war with senseless slaughter, which would have ended in his
death or capture."</p>
<p>"You misunderstand me. Suppose that he had never left the field of Waterloo,
but had thrown himself inside a square of his Old Guard and had perished with
them. What then?"</p>
<p>"What would have been gained, sire?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, perhaps, to France, save as an example. But would his memory not
be greater? Would he not seem now like some wonderful angel of destruction who
had set foot upon the earth, if we were not disabused by that anticlimax of St.
Helena?"</p>
<p>The field marahal shook his rugged head.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty is a better historical student than I," said he. "I fear that
I have enough upon my hands now, without going back a hundred years."</p>
<p>"And you, Von Speer? Have you nothing to say?"</p>
<p>"If you insist upon an answer, Your Majesty, I think that Napoleon should
have died at Waterloo."</p>
<p>The Emperor grasped him by the hand.</p>
<p>"You are a kindred sul. I have your aasurance that my honor is safe,
whatever course I take. But there is something even higher than honor. There is
that super-honor which we call heroism, when a man does more than is required
of him. Napoleon failed to find that quality. And now I wish you farewell,
gentlemen. Be assured that I will think carefully over what you have told me,
and I will then announce my action."</p>
<p>The Emperor sat with his head resting upon his hands, listening first to the
clank of spurred feet in the hall, and then to the rumble of the heavy motor.
For half an hour or more he was motionless, lost in thought. Then be sprant
luddenly to hill feet and raised his face and hands to the heavens.</p>
<p>"God give me the strength!" he cried. He rang the electric bell and a
footman appeared.</p>
<p>"Tell Captain von Mann that I await him."</p>
<p>A moment later a young fresh-faced officer with quick intelligent eyes had
entered the room and saluted.</p>
<p>"Sigurd," said the Emperor, "there are likely to be very serious times
before us. I hereby free you from any personal allegiance to me. From what I
hear, Prince Max of Baden has probably of his own initiative freed all Germany
by now."</p>
<p>"I have no wish to be freed. You are always my master and my Emperor."</p>
<p>"But I would not involve you in a tragic fate."</p>
<p>"I wish to be involved."</p>
<p>"But if it means death?"</p>
<p>"Even so."</p>
<p>"What I say I mean in a literal sense. You will die if you follow me far
enough."</p>
<p>"I ask for no better fate."</p>
<p>The Emperor grasped the young man's hand. "Then we are comrades in a great
venture!" he cried. "Now, sit beside me here at the table and let us discuss
our plans. No ignoble suicide will end your Emperor's career. There are nobler
ways of dying, and it is for me to find them."</p>
<p>There was a curious scene at the Spa station that night, though none save
the three actors in it were aware of it. It was in the station-master's room,
which had the door barred and the curtains drawn. Three men sat round a
circular table, with a strong lamp above them, beating down upon their
heads.</p>
<p>Outside, the trains clanked and whistled and roared, while the hubbub upon
the platform showed that all was anarchy and confusion. Yet, regardless of all
this, the man whose very duty it was to set the matter right sat at the table
with such a look of astonishment upon his face that it was clear that he was
oblivious of the turmoil outside. The station master, Baumgarten, was a smart,
alert, youngish man, such a man as one would expect to find attached to army
headquarters, and he was giving his whole attention now to what the elder of
his two visitors was expiaining. This man, who, like his companions was dressed
in civilian dress&mdash;a loose-fitting suit of gray tweeds&mdash;was studying
a railway map, while his younger companion looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"There is but one change, Your Majesty," said the station master.</p>
<p>"So I see," answered the Emperor, placing his finger upon Cologne. "Once
through that point we are safe. But it is all-important that we should not be
recognized."</p>
<p>"Alas, sire, your face is so well known that it is impossible you should
escape notice."</p>
<p>"Think, man, think!" cried the younger man impatiently. "Surely you can plan
it out."</p>
<p>Baumgarten scratched his puzzled head and paced the room in perplexity. Then
suddenly there came an inspiration. He stopped and turned to the table.</p>
<p>"There is a refrigtrator car, Your Majesty. It has just come through with
vegetables from Holland. We can shut off the refrigerating apparatus. It is of
course closed and windowless. If Your Majesty would condescend&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drop titles," said the Emperor, looking round him suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, if you would consent to travel in so humble a fashion, we could
have it marked 'Not to be opened' and sent through to Kiel with the next
train."</p>
<p>"Excellent. It could not be better. See that some food and water are placed
in it."</p>
<p>"And a bed, Your&mdash;a bed, sir."</p>
<p>"Tut, tut! Straw will serve us well. Can we get on at once"!"</p>
<p>"Within half an hour. But how can you cross the platform here unseen?"</p>
<p>"I had anticipated that difficulty," said the aide-de-camp. He drew a
bandage from his pocket If, sir, you would not mind acting the part of an
officer who is wounded in the face, I could easily disguise you."</p>
<p>"My wound is in the heart," said the Emperor. "But how about the civilian
clothes?"</p>
<p>"People will not stop to reason in such times as these." With a few deft
twists the young man passed the bandage over the Emperor's brow and then
diagonally across the telltale mustache. "Now, sir, I think you are safe."</p>
<p>"Well done, Sigurd. We will wait here, Herr Baumgarten, and when you give
the word, we are ready."</p>
<p>And so it waa that thirty-six hours later the station master of Kiel, known
to be a loyalist, opened the locked door of a refrigerator van, from which
emerged a middle-aged man bandaged as from a severe face wound, and his young
companion, who looked after him with touching care. The pair were cold and
stiff, but the station master hustled them rapidly into his own room, where hot
coffee was waiting, and a warm stove.</p>
<p>"Anything I can do, sire. You have but to command."</p>
<p>"Presentiy you shall learn," said the Emperor. "Meanwhile you will take this
note, or send it by a trusty hand, to Admiral von Drotha. When he comes you
will show him in to us."</p>
<p>An hour later a very amazed officer in the uniform of the Imperial Navy
entered the humble room. He was quivering with emotion and eager zeal. He sank
upon his knee before the Emperor who raised him to his feet.</p>
<p>"My dear admiral, the days of such things are pused. Has not Prince Max
declared that I have abdicated; though I confess that it was news to me! This
is my throne now." He waved. his hand toward the station chair.</p>
<p>"You are always our Emperor!"</p>
<p>"Yes, here&mdash;here"&mdash;and the speaker struck his breast&mdash;"I am
always the Emperor. God has given me the charge, and only he can relieve me
from it. But in these times I ask for no response and no favor from
others&mdash;save only one. But it is a supreme and onerous one. I wonder if
your loyalty will rise to it?"</p>
<p>"It will rise to any height, Sire. What is it?"</p>
<p>"That you should die with me. "</p>
<p>"Sire, it is my greatest ambition."</p>
<p>Tears of devotion ran down the face of the honest sailor. The Emperor also
passed his hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>"I have had false friends," he said, "but there are true hearts also in the
world. Now sit here, admiral. These are rather different surroundings from the
Potsdam palace, where last we two met. But we hsve privacy, and that is
essential. I have come to Kiel to lead my fleet out against the English."</p>
<p>The admiral gasped. "But, sire, the men are in mutiny! They have driven the
officers ashore! How can we man our ships?"</p>
<p>"They will come. They will come. They are Germans, and will not let their
Emperor go out to die alone; for I am going, admiral, if it is only one torpedo
boat which takes me out."</p>
<p>"And I am the commander of that torpedo boat!" cried the admiral.</p>
<p>"And I on the deck," said Sigurd von Mann.</p>
<p>"But what do you propose, sire? You have some definite plan in your
head."</p>
<p>"Yes, admiral, I have thought out every detail. In the first place, can you
name any large room where some hundreds of men can be privately assembled?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sire. Count von Waldorf has a dancing hall attached to his villa which
would exactly meet your requirement. The count, I need not say, is loyal to the
core."</p>
<p>"If we could pass the word round to all the officers and assemble them
there, I would appeal for their support and co-operation."</p>
<p>"Sire, I know the feelings of my comrades. To ask such a question is pure
loss of time. There is not a man of the officers' corps of the German Navy who
would shrink from following you. You have only to signify your desire, and they
are ready to meet it."</p>
<p>"Then so much time is gained, and every hour now is of importance.
Everything is cracking both on the line and behind it. We must act at once or
we may be stopped. What of the men?"</p>
<p>"I fear, eire, that they will not come. It might even be dangerous for them
to know that you are in the town."</p>
<p>"Danger is nothing. When death is the certain end, who cares for danger upon
the way! I take your word, Admiral, as to the officers. Are there any who are
loyal and trustworthy among the men?"</p>
<p>"There are many such, sire, but they are in a minority."</p>
<p>"They will serve aa our messengers. Collect as many as you can. Send by
their hand letters to every vessel. Ask the men to send their delegates, three
for a large ship, two for a light cruiser, one for a small unit to the room of
which you speak. Say that at three o'clock their Emperor would wish to speak
with them. Call me Wilhelm von Hohenzol1ern if you wish. It matters not what
they call me, so long as they will come."</p>
<p>"Sire, they will come, and a bodyguard of your faithful officers will
surround you. They will only approach you over our bodies."</p>
<p>"Not an officer, admiral. I must trust the men, or our cause is lost. You
and Captain von Mann. No others. Send me a closed motor-car, and warn your
friend, Count von Waldorf, that I am coming. I will see you again at three
o'clock."</p>
<p>Long before the time mentioned, all Kiel was buulng with excitement. The
news had spread like wildfire that the Emperor was in the town, and that he was
in the Villa Waldorf. Great crowds assembled in the streets, and here or there
a red flag fluttered over them, but there was no demonstration. Utter amazement
was the prevailing sentiment. That he should come here of all places&mdash;the
very center of revoutionary disturbance. That he should put his head into the
lion's mouth . Amazing! Still more wonderful was it when an open car bearing a
bearded officer in an admiral's uniform made its way slowly through the crowd
and its occupant entered the villa. That thin, eager face was well known to
all&mdash;the face of Henry, younger brother of William and head admiral of the
fleet. What was going on? What could it mean? Were they planning a coup
d'&eacute;tat? If so, hey would soon find out that revolutions are not so
easily set aside. So growled the crowd as it stood watching the white-stuccoed
face of the palatial villa.</p>
<p>And now the delegates began to assemble. In twos and threes they elbowed
their way through the crowd, amid a good deal of rough chaff. Many had red
handkerchiefs slung ostentatiously round their necks or red ribands in their
caps. Soon the great hall with its splendid hangings and polished oak floor,
began to fill up. The red velvet seats which lined it were filled with sailors,
and the body of the hall was also crammed. Everyone was smoking and the air was
a blue haze. Someone started a revolutionary song, and it rolled and echoed
round the high, vaulted roof. In the very midst of it the Emperor appeared. The
song was cut off in an instant, and every eye was upon that small upright
figure with the dangling arm, and upon that earnest, care-worn face which
looked down upon them from the band dais at the end. He was clad now in a rough
blue pilot jacket, and seemed far more a man of the sea, one of their own kind,
than ever he had done in his lordly trappings. A kindly wave of human sympathy
went out to him. Those who were seated rose to their feet. Two men who had
uttered shrill whistles of disapprovai were bundled out of the hall.</p>
<p>The Emperor moved to the front and laid his hand upon the gilt rail. His
brother Henry, Admiral von Drotha, and young Sigurd von Mann stood behind him.
When he spoke, it was in a firm voice which rang through the hall.</p>
<p>"I speak," said he, "as a German to Germans. I thought it right to come here
and see you face to face. I am not talking politics. There is no question of
empire or republic in my mind. I have but one thought, my personal honor, the
honor or my fleet, and the honor of my country."</p>
<p>There was no question that he had already captured his rough audience, as
earnest honesty will always capture an audience. The sea of weather-beaten
faces were all strained with attention . Their eyes were riveted upon the
speaker.</p>
<p>"They are surrendering at Berlin. Is that any reason why we should surrender
at Kiel? The army has fought most bravely, but it is worn out and can fight no
more. It is not I who have left the army, but the army has left me. The navy,
too, has fought bravely. But it is not worn out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Skagerrak!" cried many voices.</p>
<p>"Yes, you did well at Skagerrak. But your battle was not with the British
fleet. It was with two or three squadrons at the most. We have still to pit our
strength fairly against theirs. I am told that it is hopeless. I am told that
their numbers make it impossible. There is nothing hopeless or impossible to
brave men. And if it is hopeless or impossible, is it not at the worst better
that we and our ahipa should lie at the bottom or the North Sea than that they
should be surrendered without a blow? Would you stand by and let such a thing
be, you men of the German fleet? Or are you ready to die with your
Emperor?"</p>
<p>He flung out his arm in an eloquent gesture of appeal, and then a proud,
happy smile passed over his face, for he had won his cause. A forest of
outstretched hands, a lake of flushed, eager faces, a roar of deep-toned
voices&mdash;the navy would die with its Kaiser!</p>
<p>"Quick, William! Strike at once!" whispered his brother.</p>
<p>"You will come with me. I knew that you would. Then carry my word to your
comrades. Say that no unwilling man need come. Let them stay ashore. But you
and I and all true German hearts will sail together upon the death voysge or
the German fleet. Go, and do what I have told you."</p>
<p>There was a rush of heavy feet, and in a few minutes the hall W88 cleared
and every exit filled with pushing, struggling men. In some strange way the
crowd outside had in an instant learned what was afoot, and had caught the
flame. The whole town was in an uproar of cheering. Flags broke out on every
flagstaff, the German war flag on the same pole as the red ensign of
revolution. On that the sailors were firm. The war flag might go up, but the
red flag should not come down. All day and all night the Soviets held their
heated meetings, where again and again dissentients were struck down by thoee
who wished to go. News came back from Wilhelmshaven that the excitement had
spread there, that all officers had been recalled to their ships, that the
crews were at their quarters and that the engineers were stoking their fires.
Soon the fleet would be ready to start.</p>
<p>The next few days saw an uninterrupted flow of vessels through the canal, to
join the main fleet which lay in the Jade. Some delay was caused by the
breakdown of a light cruiser, which blocked the passage near Neu Wittenbek but
thiS was finally overcome, and by the evening of the third day the ships had
collected, either in the vicini ty of the Jade or in the Wilhelmshaven Roads.
That night a council was held in the wardroom or the new battleship Bayern, at
which all the German chiefs were present, including the Emperor, who insisted
upon taking a subordinate place, while Von Speer, who had hastened from Spa at
the first whisper of what had happened, presided over the deliberations. Vice-
admirals and captains of capital ships&mdash;forty in all&mdash;crowded the
room, gloom, and yet determination, upon every face.</p>
<p>"I understand, Your Majesty, that your commands are that there shall be s
fight to a finish?"</p>
<p>"That is my wish and my order," the Emperor answered. "The fleet is to be
sunk, and it is better that it take as many of the enemy as possible with
it."</p>
<p>"We have to face the cost," said the admiral. "It meane the death or Your
Majesty."</p>
<p>"I desire no better fate."</p>
<p>"And of twenty-five thousand officers and men."</p>
<p>"Is there anyone in this council who shrinks from it?" asked the Emperor.
There was silence. All were ready. The fleet was ready.</p>
<p>"But with all respect," said a young vice-admiral, "is it necessary that we
talk as if defeat were inevitable? We held the English at Skagerrak. May we not
do so again?"</p>
<p>"Besides," said another, "our fleet is now stronger&mdash;far stronger than
then. Have we not added the Bayern and Baden, great ships with fifteen- inch
guns, whereaa we had nothing over twelve inches at the Skagerrak. And the
Hindenburg too! Is she not an addition? And the new fire control! May we not
have s surprise for the English?"</p>
<p>"It is too late," said Von Speer. "If we win the victory, we have no
fatherland to which to return." He took a telegram from his pocket and read it
aloud:</p>
<p><tt>THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT SEVERELY CONDEMNS THE MAD PROJECT OF A SORTIE
UPON THE PART OF THE FLEET, WHICH CAN LEAD TO NO RESULT SAVE THE UNNECESSARY
LOSS OF SHIPS AND MEN. THE REPORT OF IT HAS SERIOUSLY IMPEDED THE NEGOTIATIONS
FOR AN ARMISTICE. YOUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT DEMANDS THAT YOU INSTANTLY
ORDER THE SHIPS TO RETURN TO THEIR ANCHORAGE.</tt></p>
<p>A growl or indignation rose from the officers as their admiral replaced the
paper in his pocket.</p>
<p>"I think you will agree with me, gentlemen, that our allegiance is due to
our Emperor, and to him alone."</p>
<p>"Have you answered it?" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>"No, sire. Our deeds will answer it. But I have drawn up a message here
which, with your consent, I would like to send to the British commander-in-
chief. It runs thus: 'The High Sea Fleet does not consent to any armistice. It
proposes to come out at once, and hopes on Monday to be seventy miles due west
or Heligoland if the mine-clearing permits. Should we be delayed, you will no
doubt have the courtesy to wait for us.'"</p>
<p>"Excellent!" cried the Emperor, and all the council clapped their hands.</p>
<p>"Then it shall go at once, "said the admiral.</p>
<p>"Might not the enemy lay their submarines at the spot?" asked one
captain.</p>
<p>"We shall not be too exact as to the spot. Our light cruisers wi11 guide the
enemy to where we are. But as to what you say, Captain Muller, concernlng the
addition to bur fleet, and to the Skagerrak, it is well to have no illusions.
The enemy has not been idle. We are in close touch with all that he has done.
If we can build and improve and organize, so can they. You are aware that they
lost two great ships because there was no cut-off from the turrets to the
magazines. That has now been remedied. The protection of their decks and the
roofs of their turrets are stronger now against plunging fire. Their shel1s
hsve more explosive power. They have added many powerful ships to their
squadrons. I have their names here. There is the Ramillies, the Resolution, the
Renown, the Repulse&mdash;all with fifteen-inch guns. They have a squadron,
too, of American battleships, and American naval history shows that they will
be well handled and well fought. The odds against us are greater than ever. We
can but swear to fight to the death. For myself, I swear it."</p>
<p>He raised his hand as he spoke, and every officer in the room, including the
Emperor, did the same. "We swear it!" they cried. Nobly, as this record will
show, did they fulfill their oath. That was the final word of the last council
of war ever held in the High Sea Fleet. With set and somber faces they bade one
another farewell; the captains returning to their vessela, while the admirals
remained to plan their future with their leader.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It was just one day later that two admirals sat talking very earnestly
together in the cabin of the commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet. One
was that commander himself. The other was the American, Bradman, whose fine
squadron, comprising the New York, Wyoming, Florida, Delaware, Arkansas and
Texas, was the latest addition to the most formidable collection of war vessels
ever assembled in the history or the world. Through the open porthole of
Beaton's cabin one could see them riding at anchor with the Stars and Stripes
flying over them, while beyond, line after line of mighty battleships, of giant
cruisers, and of smaller craft, under St. George's flag, choked the great bay.
Beyond lay the low barren shore of Scapa&mdash;as sad and bleak a prospect as
any in the world.</p>
<p>Beaton, his handsomefrace wearing a puzzled frown, was reading aloud to his
colleague the German wireless message.</p>
<p>"What do you make of that, Bradman?" he asked, looking up at his
companion.</p>
<p>"Say, it's just fine on the face of it!" the American answered. "Too good to
be true, I guess."</p>
<p>"I don't know. They have not much choice, have they? I think it is what we
should do if things were reversed. They can scuttle their own ships in harbor
or they can come outside and have them scuttled by our guns, taking a few of
our own to the bottom with them. It seems to me to be reasonable, and the first
thing that brave men would think of."</p>
<p>"Maybe so. But It might be a trap all the same."</p>
<p>"Well, we won't walk into a mine-field if we can help it. Our light craft
will look out for that. Anyhow, I think we should let them have an answer." He
took up a pencil and scribbled upon a card: "Very good. We shall be there.'
How's that?"</p>
<p>"That's the idea."</p>
<p>Beaton rang the gong and handed the message to a young officer in
attendance. "No need for code, Duncan. Send it as it stands." Then , as the
door closed, he turned to the great map of the North Sea, which was now so
crisscrossed with pencil-marks and bearings as to be almost worn out. "That
being so, Bradman, I suppose we should take it seriously and make our
preparations. The poor devils would not have a chance, for we are two to one;
but from what we saw of them at Jutland, I'll promise you that they will put up
a very fine fight."</p>
<p>"Yes, they side-stepped you there," said Bradman, with a sly twinkle.</p>
<p>"Maybe so. But it's difficult to take chances when on our side the war is
lost if our fleet is lost, while the other fellow lays no such stake upon the
table. That was our trouble at Jutland. We could not risk the rough and tumble
of a night action. We have a free hand now, and every man in the British fleet
wants a fight to a finish."</p>
<p>"I' ll answer for my squadron, too," said Admiral Bradman, and the two
sailors bent over the chart.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The day or the great adventure and of the supreme sacrifice had come. The
German fleet had assembled now in Heligoland Bay and, shortly after dawn,
started upon its last terrible voyage, its mine sweepera having for two days
swept a clear passage. In front of the magnificent array were two squadrons of
light cruisers, forming the screen for the fleet. Then came the battle cruisers
in double line, Derrflinger , Seydlitz, Moltke, and Von der Tann&mdash;the old
squadron which had already endured so much and won the respect of every British
sailor. Von Lippert was in command. They were strengthened now by the mighty
Hindenburg, but her sister ship, the Mackensen, was not yet ready for service.
Behind the cruisers came the magnificent line of the battleships, led by the
strongest squadron just out of the builder's yard&mdash;the Bayern, flying the
flag of Von Speer and carrying the Emperor on board, the Baden, and two others,
All these great ships carried eight fifteen-inch guns and had a speed of
twenty- two knots. Behind them were the four powerful ships of the K&ouml;nig
class&mdash;K&ouml;nig, Grosser Kurf&uuml;rst, Kronprinz, and Markgraf. They
carried ten twelve-inch guns. Then came four Kaisers&mdash;ships as strong as
the K&ouml;nigs and rather faster. Astern of these, the great line extended
across the whole visible circle of ocean, giant behind giant, the Friedrich der
Grosse, Ostfriesland, Th&uuml;ringen, Heligoland, Oldenburg, Posen, and many
more, while even the very old ships, such as the Deutschland or the Schleswig-
Holstein, which carried four heavy guns, but were incapable of more than
sixteen knots, had fallen in behind and panted along to share the fate of their
comrades. There was no need for hurry, and the whole fleet steamed at reduced
speed, while on every side the destroyers kept guard againat surprise.</p>
<p>In this they were but partially successful, as the Posen was struck by an
English submarine and had to stagger back into port in a sinking condition. The
submarine itself&mdash;M-16&mdash;was destroyed by the depth charges showered
around it.</p>
<p>The Allied fleet had to start long before dawn in order to keep its tryst.
If the German array had been formidable, this could only be described as
terrific. Apart from a swarm of light cruisers and destroyers, the van was led
by the Lion, which still bore upon her plates the dents of former battles.
Behind her in single line came the Tiger, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral
Morton, and astern were the Australia and Princess Royal. Even more formidable
were two new vessels, which, on account of their peculiar qualities, operated
apart. These were the Renown and Repulse, carrying fifteen-inch guns and
capable of attaining the amazing speed of thirty-two knots.</p>
<p>The light-battleship squadron, under Admiral Thoms, which had shown its fine
qualities at Jutland, where for a time it had been under the fire of a large
part of the German fleet, followed the cruisers. They were, as before, the
Malaya, Valiant, Warspite and Barham, with the Queen Elizabeth added, all armed
with fifteen-inch guns. Behind them in double column came the new prides of the
British service&mdash;the Ramillies, Resolution, Revenge, Royal Sovereign, and
Royal Oak&mdash;twenty-three-knot vessels carrying eight fifteen- inch guns
each. Behind them again was the splendid American squadron of six vessels
already named, with their fourteen-inch guns and twenty-one knots of speed. The
thick smoke from their funnels showed that they were coal-burning ships. So,
squadron after squadron, the great armada passed out from Scapa, with the
strange unwieldy airplane carrier, Furious, like a huge Noah's ark, in the
rear. Far out on each flank were the heavy cruisers Inflexible, New
Zealand,Indomitable, and others, while swarms of light cruisers and destroyers
covered the ocean up to the horizon in every direction. The heavier ships
formed into six columns outside the bay, and the whole majestic procession
moved at eighteen knots toward the southeast.</p>
<p>It was at 2:30 in the afternoon that two British seaplanes reported a German
Zeppelin in lat. 65.46 North, long. 5.14 East, and attacked it unsuccessfully.
Following it up, they saw and reported the thick fringe of scouts which
preceded the High Seas Fleet. The news was wirelessed to every vessel in the
Allied armada and assured them for the first time that the German challenge was
not empty bravado, and that the great day had really come when this
long-standing quarrel should be fought to an end. Battle flags were broken out
upon every ship, and Beaton increased his speed to twenty knots, even at the
risk of leaving his slower craft behind. The swift battle cruisers were sent on
independently at full speed to hold the enemy until the main fleet should
arrive. It was a fine day, but there was a brisk breeze from the southeast, and
the great cruisers, running at twenty-eight knots, had their foredecks almost
under water, and the spray as high as their funnels, while they thundered
through the racing waves. At 2:40 came the news that the light cruiser Phaeton
had been sunk by a German submarine. A few minutes later the same fate had
befallen the Inconstant. Then came word that a Zeppelin had been destroyed by
the anti-aircraft guns of the scout Arethusa.</p>
<p>Shortly after three, cocoa and light food were served out to the crews and
the bugles blew for action stations. News from the scouts was now coming in
thick and fast, and the sound of heavy firing could be heard from the flagship
in the southeastern direction. Seaplane No. 7042, launched from the Furious,
had flown the whole length of the German fleet, and though brought down with a
broken wing, managed to wireless her observations of their total fOrce, which
proved to be surprisingiy accurate, considering the difficult circumstances of
the reconnaissance. For this valuable servlce Flight Lieutenant Oliver was very
specially mentioned in dispatches.</p>
<p>The great fleeta were now rapidly closing, and the Fourth British Light
Cruiser Squadron was fiercely engaged with the Ninth German Squadron of scouts.
As the British main fleet came roaring along down upon the battle, the whole
horizon was dotted with these smaller vessels, many of them smothered in foam
from the shells which were falling thickly around them. At four o'clock the
head of the heavy cruiser squadron was engaged with the Derrflinger, which led
the German battle cruisers. The action had fairly begun.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>And here I pause. Was it to describe that great epic, that Armageddon of the
sea, that my vision was intended? Was it not rather to have the alternate fates
of that desperate and unhappy man who stood at the parting of the ways, where
one led to life with honor, and the other to death with heroism? And yet his
tragedy was so involved with this far greater one that my dream could scarce
deal with one except through the other. Therefore, with no more detail than is
necessary to give reallty to the picture, I will write what the eye of
imagination has seen.</p>
<p>As each side desired to flght rather than to maneuver, the covering
squadrons of light cruisers, having done their duty in reporting the enemy,
fell upon one another with the utmost fury. A whole series of desperate duels
was begun at a range of 7000 yards, shortening to 5000. So engrossed were the
little fellows in their own combats that they paid hardly any attention to the
heavier ships which passed through their m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and which could
each have sunk any one of them with a shot. The old rule of the sea by which
ships of the line did not flre upon frigates still held good, and the scouts
were left to settle their quarrel among themselves.</p>
<p>At flrst the Germans had the better, for their gunnery was perfect, and
their destroyers pushed boldly into the fight. The Daring, Dryad, Calliope,
Donegal and Lancaster were all sunk by gunflre or torpedo, while the Carnarvon
drew out of the line in a sinking condition. On the other hand, the Stettin and
Berlin were both sunk early in the fight, and the Pillau was put out of
action.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, fresh British light craft and destroyers joined in the
fray, and weight of metal and of numbers overbore the gallant Germans. The
Stuttgart, M&uuml;nchen and Frankfurt were all sunk by gunflre, while the
British lost only the Carnarvon, which was finally torpedoed by the Regensburg.
This fighting was desperate and bloody, but it was a mere digression from the
main businese of the day. As to the destroyers, the flotillas on either side
charged headlong at the capital ships of the enemy, and then, meeting halfway,
each strove desperately to prevent the other from reaching its mark. Like
fighting dogs, half smothered in foam, they tore through the sea, their sides
almost touching and the flashes of their guns licking the very paint from the
bulwarks of their opponents.</p>
<p>On every side one saw shattered and blazing wrecks, for the oil fuel turned
each stricken boat into a funeral pyre for its crew&mdash;a proper burial for
men who, on either side, came of the Viking blood. Some destroyers, German or
British, fought their way through the crowd and succeeded in driving home their
attack upon the battleships, with certain death for their reward. The
Marlborough was struck again, as she had been at Jutland, and this time sank
with all hands. The Orion, too, was badly damaged, and fell out of the line
with a list of twelve degrees to port. The New York and Renown were both hit,
but neither sustained serious damage, for their water-tight bulkheads stood
firm. In every case the secondary armament disposed of the brave little
assailsnt. The German line suffered even more heavily than the British. Captain
Hase's ship, the Derrflinger, had a huge hole blown in her bows, and sank by
the head. The Kaiserin and The Grosser Kurf&uuml;rst were each of them sunk,
and the Oldenburg was crippled. An American squadron under Captain Bosnell of
the Cushing distinguished itself In this work. On either side no notice was
taken of casualties.</p>
<p>The stricken must look after themselves. The deadly lock of battle held the
rest to their work.</p>
<p>Beaton had deployed his main fleet to either flank in the hope of placing an
Allied ship on each side of a German, but Von Speer had rapidly altered his
line ahead into double column to meet the danger. Now it was a fair gun duel,
opening at 17,000 yards and closing in until only 12,000 yards separated the
giants who moved parallel to one another, with no maneuvers, save that each
ship would sheer in or out to baffle the enemy's aim. The German range-finders
were the better, and they were the quicker on the mark, but the British guns
were heavier and there was little to choose in the shooting. Thus it was that
numbers were bound to tell. Ship after ship in the German line went up in flame
and smoke.</p>
<p>The British had learned the lesdon of Jutland, and though the heavy shells
of the new fifteen-inch German guns plunged repeatedly through the roofs of
turrets, exterminating the crews of the guns and putting them out of action,
there was no passage for that murderous back-flash which had formerly reached
the magazine and destroyed the ship. The deck protection was still too weak,
however, on either side, and the destruction of ships was due again and again
to plunging fire which penetrated to the vitals. Thus it was with many Germans,
and thus, too, with the Tiger, Inflexible, Florida, Repulse and Collingwood,
all of which shared the fate of the Queen Mary.</p>
<p>A gray flgure&mdash;sray in drese and gray in ce&mdash;tood for hours at the
side of the bridge of the flagship. It was the Emperor. A telescope with
magnifying power of flfteen diameters enabled him to view the terrific scene.
Hour after hour he saw and realized the awful thing that had come upon the
earth. Men of the same blood and culture, men sprung from the same Northern
stock, were locked in this horrible wrestle, which could only end in death. Who
can say what his thoughts might have been at such a time?</p>
<p>They flashed back to dwell upon his splendid father, the kindly golden-
bearded giant, and upon the Englishwoman, his mother. Yes, half the blood in
his own veins flowed from the same source as that which was in the crews of the
gray ships over yonder. By what extraordinary mishandling of chances and by
what evil ordering of events had it come about that he was now in such deadly
conflict with them? Why was it necessary, when Germany was already conquering
the world by its industry and circling the globe with ita colonies? It was
useless to go back upon the past. Far off, many years ago, some wrong path was
taken, and this was whither it had led. It was the twilight of the
gods&mdash;the most fearsome thing in all the history of the human race. They
held him responsible, and yet he knew that he was but a puppet in the hands of
fate, moving forward in some predestined and unavoidable fashion upon a
terrible course.</p>
<p>But who was responsible&mdash;surely there must be responsibility somewhere.
Was it the hand which drafted that mad ultimatum to Serbia? Was it the Czar and
his premature mobi1ization? Was it Von Tirpitz, with his colossal sea plans,
now at that moment reaching their tragic result? Was it to Von Schlieffen, with
his scheme of marching through Belgium, which must bring England into the war?
Was it his Uncle Edward, who had always been so suspicious of him? Or was it
his chancellor's act, when, in 1902, he had refused with contempt an offer of
an alliance from England?</p>
<p>Each and all of these facts seemed to his tired brain to have had something
to do with this awful conclusion. At his feet lay a shattered body, the blood
from which had splashed his high boots had left stains upon his gray overcoat.
It was his faithful aide-de-camp, Von Mann, true to death, as he had promissed.
And that mangled corpse, that premature death when youth was at its best, was
typical of ten million others for which so many held him responsible. He
ahuddered as terrible visions rose before him. They were interrupted by Von
Speer, who approached him on the bridge. The sdmiral had been hit on the
shoulder by splinter, and his face was white and drawn.</p>
<p>"How goes it now, admira1" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>The sailor shrulged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Aa to the fleet, we have lost nine battleships and four great cruisers. The
Hindenburg has just gone up. Our own two after-turrets have both been shot
away, the top is off one of the fore ones, and we have only two guns in action.
We are, as you can see, on fire at both ends, and only a part of our funnel is
standing. There is water in the engine room and the stokers are drowning. We
can do no more."</p>
<p>"What of the English? I have seen several of their ships go up."</p>
<p>"The battle now covers a line of fifteen miles. Many of the aerials have
been ahot away. But it is likely that they have lost ship for ship with
ourselves."</p>
<p>"And what now?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing for it but to fight our ships to the water's edge."</p>
<p>At this moment a midshipman ran upon the bridge with a message.</p>
<p>"The voice tubes are cut, sir," he cried as he saluted; "I was told to bring
it by hand."</p>
<p>The admiral tore open the paper.</p>
<p>"It ill a wireleaa from Beaton," he said.</p>
<p>"It runs: 'Surely honor is satisfled. No men could have done more. Why this
useless slaughter? You have only five ships left in a condition to give battle.
I can stand off and outrange you, so as to sink you from a distance which you
cannot reach. I should hate to kill brave men in such a way. Admit your
honorable and inevitable defeat, and strike your flag.' "</p>
<p>"Never!" said the Emperor.</p>
<p>"Never!" echoed the admiral.</p>
<p>But at that moment there came that which settled the matter. Some say that
the salvo was fired from the Delaware, some that it came from the Lion. Out of
eight shells, four fell direct upon the deck of the Bayern and plunged down
into her magazines. With a roar, the mighty vessel went up into the air. In the
instant of impact, conscious of what the next few seconds would bring, Emperor
and admiral shook hands. M any survivors have testified to seeing that salute.
It was the last gesture of the German Imperial house and of the German High Sea
F1eet. At that very moment the southern horizon was broken by the smoke of many
hurrying vessels. The Harwich flotilla was arriving, fresh and eager. It was
the end.</p>
<p>Late that night, when the sun had sunk and left only a pink glow in the
west, the British commander looked proudly and yet ruefully upon the scene of
that terrible epic. In every direction shattered wrecks were burning, and men
floated upon scattered spars or upon rafts, while swift torpedo boats flew from
one to the other on their errand of saving life. Admiral Beaton stood upon his
bridge, worn and weary, darkened by all the shadows of reaction.</p>
<p>"Might I suggest, sir, that we send a message to the fleet?" said the high
officer at his elbow.</p>
<p>"To what is left of the fleet," said Beaton with a wan smile; "I hear their
Emperor went down with their f1agship. My message, Murdoch, would be to fly our
flags halfmast in memory of a brave man."</p>
<p>So ran my vision of an alternative. And yet it may be that Fate was wiser,
and that the path upon the level was better than that upon the hilltops.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>THERE is a fascinating little print shop around the comer of Drury Lane.
When you pass through the old oaken doorway and into the dim dusty interior,
you seem to have wandered into some corridor leading back through time, for on
every side of you are the pictures of the past. But very specially I value that
table on the left where lies the great pile of portrait prints heaped up in
some sort of order of date: There you see the pictures of the men who stood
round the throne of the young Victoria, of Melbourne, of Peel, of Wellington,
and then you come on the D'Orsay and Lady Blessington period, and the long and
wonderful series of H.B., the great, unknown John Doyle, who, in his day, was a
real power in the land. Farther back still you come on the bucks and prize
fighters of the Regency&mdash;the pompous Jackson, the sturdy Cribb, the empty
Brummel, the chubby Alvanley. And then you may chance upon a face which you
cannot pass without a second and a longer look. It is a face which
Mephistopheles might have owned; thin, dark, keen, with bushy brows and fierce,
alert eyes which glare out from beneath them. There is a full-length coloured
print which shows him to be tall and magnificently proportioned, with broad
shoulders, slim waist, clad in a tightly-buttoned green ooat, buckskin breeches
and high Hessian boots. Below is the inscription: "Sir John Hawker"&mdash;and
that is the Devil Hawker of the legends.</p>
<p>In his short but vivid career, the end cf which is here outlined, Hawker was
the bully of the town. The bravest shrank away from the angry, insolent glare
of those baleful eyes. He was a famous swordsman and a remarkable pistol
shot&mdash;so remarkable that three times he starred the kneecap of his man;
the most painful injury wbich he could inflict. But above all, he was the best
amateur boxer of his day, and had he taken to the ring it is likely that be
would have made a name. His hitting is said to have been the most ferocious
ever seen, and it was his amusement to try out novices at Cribb's rooms, which
were his favorite haunt, and to teach them how to stand punishment. It
gratified his pride to show his skill, and his cruel nature to administer pain
to others. It was in these very rooms of Cribb that this little sketch of those
days opens, where, as on a marionette stage, I would try to show you what
manner of place it was and what manner of people walked London in those
full&middot;blooded, brutal and virile old days.</p>
<p>First, as to the place. It is at the oomer of Panton Street, and you see
over a broad, red-curtained door the sign: THOMAS CRlBB. DEALER IN LIQUOR AND
TOBACCO, with the Union Arms printed above. The door leads into a tiled passage
which opens on the left into a common bar behind which save on special
evenings, a big, bull&middot;faced, honest John Bull of a man may be seen with
two assistants of the sparring-partner type, handing out refreshment and
imbibing gratis a great deal more than was good for their athletic figures.
Already Tom is getting a waistline which will cause his trainer and himself
many a weary day at his next battle: if , indeed, the brave old fellow has not
already come to the last or his fights, when he defended the honor or England
by breaking the cast-iron jaw of Molyneaux, the black.</p>
<p>If, instead of turning into the common bar, you continue down the passage,
you find a green-baize door with the word "Parlour" printed acrose one upper
panel of glass. Push it open and you are in a room which is spacious and
comfortable. There is sawdust on the floor, numerous wooden armchairs, round
tables for the card players, a small bar presided over by Miss Lucy Stagg, a
lady who had been accused of many things, but never of shyness, in the corner,
and a fine collection of sporting pictures round the walls. At the back were
swing doors with the words "Boxing Saloon" printed across them, leading into a
large bare apartment, with a roped ring in the centre, and many pairs of gloves
hanging upon the wall, belonging, for the most part, to the Corinthians who
came up to have lessons from the champion, whose classes were only exceeded by
those of Gentleman Jackson in Bond Street.</p>
<p>It was early in the particular evening of which I speak, and there was no
one in the parlour save Cribb himself, who expected the quality that night, and
was cleaning up in anticipation. Lucy wiped glasses languidly in her little
bar. Beside the entrance door was a small, shriveled weasel of a man, Billy
Jakes by name, who sat behind a green-baize table, in receipt of custom as a
bookmaker, dog-fancier or cock supplier&mdash;a privilege for which he paid Tom
a good round sum every year. As no customers had appeared, he wandered over to
the little bar.</p>
<p>"Well, things are quiet tonight, Lucy."</p>
<p>She looked up from polishing her glasses.</p>
<p>"I expect they will be more lively soon, Mr. Jakes. It is full early."</p>
<p>"Well, Lucy, you look very pretty tonight. I expect I shall have to marry
you yet."</p>
<p>"La, Mr. Jakes, how you do carry on!"</p>
<p>"Tell me, Lucy; do you want to make some money?"</p>
<p>"Everyone wants that, Mr. Jakes."</p>
<p>"How much can you lay your hands on?"</p>
<p>"I dare say I could find fifty pounds at a pinch."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to turn it into a hundred?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course I would."</p>
<p>"It's Saracesca for the Oaks. I'd give you two to one, which is better than
I give the others. She's a cert it ever there is one."</p>
<p>"Well, if you say so, Mr. Jakes. The money is upstairs in my box. But if you
can really turn it into&mdash;"</p>
<p>Fortunately, honest Tom Cribb had been within earshot of this little debate,
and he now caught the man roughly by the sleeve and twirled him in the
direction of his table.</p>
<p>"You dirty dog; doing the poor girl out of her hard-earned savings!"</p>
<p>"All right, Tom. Only a joke! Only Billy Jakes' little joke!... I wouldn't
have let you lose. Lucy!"</p>
<p>"That's enough," said Tom. "Don't you heed him, Lucy. Keep your money in
your box."</p>
<p>The green swing-door opened and a number of bucks, in black coats, brown
coats, green coats and purple, came filing into the room. The shrill voice of
Jakes was at once uplifted and his clamour filled the air.</p>
<p>"Now, my noble sportsmen," he cried, "back your opinions! There is a bag of
gold waiting, and you have only to put your hands in. How about Woodstock for
the Derby? How about Saracesca for the Oaks? Four to one! Four to one! Two to
one, bar one!"</p>
<p>The Corinthians gathered for a moment round the bookie's table, for his
patter amused them.</p>
<p>"Lots of time for that, Jakes," said Lord Rulton, a big bluff county magnate
and landowner.</p>
<p>"But the odds are shorter every day. Now's your time, my noble gamesters!
Now's the time to sow the seed! Gold to be had for the asking, waitin' there
for you to pick up. I like to pay it. It pleases me to see happy faces round
me. 1 like to see them smiling Now's your time."</p>
<p>"Why, half the field may scratch before the race," said Sir Charles
Trevor&mdash;the imperturbable Charles, whose estate has been sucked dry by its
owner's wild excesses.</p>
<p>"No race, no pay. The old firm gives every gamester a run for his money. The
knowing ones are all on to it. Sir John Hawker has five hundred on
Woodstock."</p>
<p>"Well, Devil Hawker knows what he is about," said Lord Annerley, a dashing
young Corinthian.</p>
<p>"Have fifty on the filly for the Oaks, Lord Ruffton. Four to one?"</p>
<p>"Very good, Jakes," said the nobleman handing out a note. "I suppose I shall
find you after the race."</p>
<p>"Sitting here at this table, my lord. Old established place of business.
You've got a certainty, my lord."</p>
<p>"Well," said a young Corinthian, "if it is as certaIn as that, I'll have
fifty too."</p>
<p>"Right, my noble sportsman I book it at three to one."</p>
<p>"I thought it was four."</p>
<p>"It was four. Now it is three. You't lucky to get before it is two. Will you
take your winnings in paper or gold?"</p>
<p>"Well, in gold."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir. You'll find me waiting at this table with a bag of gold at
ten by the clock on the day after the race. It will be in a green-baize bag
with a grip, so you can easily carry it. By the way, I've got a fighting cock
that's never been beat. Would any of you gentlemen&mdash;"</p>
<p>But the door ad swung open and Sir John Hawker's handsome figure and
sinister face filled the gap. The others moved towards the small bar Hawker
paused a moment at the bookie's table.</p>
<p>"Hullo, Jakes; doing some fool out of their money as usual?"</p>
<p>"Tut, tut, Sir John, you should know me by now."</p>
<p>"Know you, you rascal! You have had a cool two thouand out of me from first
to last I know you too well."</p>
<p>"All you want is to persevere. You'll soon have it all back, Sir John."</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, I say. I have had enough."</p>
<p>"No offense, my noble sportsman. But I have a brindled terrier down at the
stable that's the best of rats in London."</p>
<p>"I wonder he hasn't had a nip at you then. Hullo, Tom."</p>
<p>Cribb had oome forward as usual to greet his Corinthian guests.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Sir John. Going to put them on to-night?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll see. What have you got?"</p>
<p>"Half a dozen up from old Bristol. That place is as full of milling coves as
a bin is of bottles."</p>
<p>"I may try one of them over."</p>
<p>"Then play light. Sir John. You cracked the ribs of that lad from Lincoln.
You broke his heart for fighting."</p>
<p>"It may as well be broke early as late. What's the use of him if he can't
take punishment?"</p>
<p>Several more men had come into the room; one of them exceedingly drunk,
another just a little less so. They wer two of the Tom-and-Jerry clique who
wandered day and night on the old round from the Haymarket to Panton Street and
St. J ames, imagining that they were seeing life. The drunken one&mdash;a young
hawbuck from the shires&mdash;was noisy and combative. His friend was trying to
put some term to their adventures.</p>
<p>"Come, George," he coaxed, "we'll just have one drink here. Then one at the
Dive and one at the Cellars, and wind up with broiled bones at Mother
Simpson's."</p>
<p>The name of the dish started ideas in the drunken man's head. He staggered
in the direction of the landlord. "Broiled bones!" he cried. "D'you hear? I
want broiled bones! Fetch me dish&mdash;large dish&mdash;of broiled bones this
instant&mdash;under pain&mdash;displeasure."</p>
<p>Cribb, who waa well accustomed to such visitors, continued his conversation
with Hawker without taking the slightest notice. They were discussing a
possible opponent for old Tom Shelton, the navvy, when George broke in
again.</p>
<p>"Where the devil's those broiled bones? Here, landlord! Ole Tom Cribb! Tom,
give me large dish broiled bones this instant , or I punch your old head." As
Cribb still took not the faintest heed, George became more bellicose.</p>
<p>"No broiled bones!" he cried. "Very good! Prepare defend yourself!"</p>
<p>"Don't hit him, George!" cried his more sober companion in alarm. "It's the
champion."</p>
<p>"It's a lie. I am the champion. I'll give him smack in the chops. See if I
don't."</p>
<p>For the first time Cribb turned a slow eye in his direction.</p>
<p>"No dancin' allowed here, sir," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not dancing. I'm sparring."</p>
<p>"Well , don't do it, whatever it is."</p>
<p>"I'm going to fight you. Going to give old Tom a smack in the chops."</p>
<p>"Some other time, sir, I'm busy."</p>
<p>"Where're those bones? Last time of asking."</p>
<p>"What bones? What is he talkin' of?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Tom, but have to give you good thrashing. Yes, Tom, very sorry, but
must have lesson."</p>
<p>He made several wild strokcs in the air, quite out of distance, and finally
fell upon his knees. His friend picked him up.</p>
<p>"What d'you want to be so foolish for, George?"</p>
<p>"I had him nearly beat."</p>
<p>Tom looked reproachfully at the soberer friend. "I am surprised at you, Mr.
Trelawney."</p>
<p>"Couldn't help it, Tom. He would mix port and brandy."</p>
<p>"You must take him out."</p>
<p>"Come on, George; you've got to go out."</p>
<p>"Got to go! No, sir; round two, Come up smilin'. Time!"</p>
<p>Tom Cribb gave a sign and a stalwart potman threw the pugnacious George over
his shoulder and carried him out of the room, kicking violently, while his
friend walked behind. Cribb laughed.</p>
<p>"There's seldom an evening that I don't have that sort of nuisance."</p>
<p>"They would not do it twice to me," said Hawker. "I'd send him home, and his
wench wouldn't know him."</p>
<p>"I haven't the heart to touch them. It pleases the poor things to say they
have punched the champion of England."</p>
<p>The room had now begun to fill up. At one end a circle had formed round the
bookie's table, On the other side there was a group at the small private bar
where very broad chaff was being exchanged between some of the younger bucks
and Lucy, who was well able to take care of herself. Cribb had gone inside the
swing doors to prepare for the boxing, while Hawker wandered from group to
group, leaving among these fearless men, hard-riding horsemen of the shires and
dare-devils at every sport, a vague feeling of repulsion which showed itself in
a somewhat formal response to his brief greetings. He paused at one chattering
group and looked sardonically at a youth who stood somewhat apart listening to,
but not joining in, the gay exchange of repartee. He was a well-built young man
with a singularly beautiful head, crowned by a mass of auburn curls. His figure
might have stood for Adonis, were it not that one foot was slightly drawn up,
which caused him to wear a rather unsightly boot.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Hawker," said he.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Byron. Is this one of your hours of idleness?"</p>
<p>The allusion was to a book of verse which the young nobleman had just
brought out, and which had been severely handled by the critics.</p>
<p>The poet seemed annoyed, for he was sensitive on the point.</p>
<p>"At least I cannot be accused of idleness today," said he. "I swam three
miles downstream from Lambeth, and perhaps you have not done so much."</p>
<p>"Well done!" said Hawker. "I hear of you at Angelo's, and Jackson's, too.
But fencing needs a quick foot. I 'd stick to the water if I were you." He
glanced down at the malformed limb.</p>
<p>Byron's blue-gray eyes blazed with indignation.</p>
<p>"When I wish your advice as to my personal habits, Sir John Hawker, I will
ask for it."</p>
<p>"No harm meant," said Hawker carelessly. "I am a blunt fellow and always say
what I think."</p>
<p>Lord Rufton plucked at Byron's sleeve. "That's enough said," he
whispered.</p>
<p>"Of course," added Hawker, "if anyone does not like my ways, they can always
find me at White's Club or my lodgings in Charles Street."</p>
<p>Byron, who was utterly fearless, and ready, though he was still only a
CambrLdge undergraduate, to face any man in the world, was about to make some
angry reply in spite of the well-meant warnings of Lord Rufton, when Tom Cribb
came bustling in and interrupted the scene.</p>
<p>"All ready, my lords and gentlemen. The fighting men are in their place.
Jack Scroggins and Ben Burn will begin."</p>
<p>The company began to move towards the door of the sparring saloon. As they
filed in, Hawker advanced quietly and touched the reckless baronet, Sir Charles
Trevor, upon the ahoulder.</p>
<p>"I must have a word with you, Charles."</p>
<p>"I want to get a ringside seat, John."</p>
<p>"Never mind that. I must have a word."</p>
<p>The others passed in. Devil Hawker and Sir Charles had the room. to
themselve, save for Jakes, counting his money at his distant table, and the
girl, Lucy, coming and going in her little alcove. Hawker led Sir Charles to a
central seat.</p>
<p>"I have to speak to you, Charles, of that three thousand you owe me. It
pains me vastly, but what am I to do? I have my own debts to settle, and it is
no easy matter."</p>
<p>"I have the matter in hand, John."</p>
<p>"But it presses"</p>
<p>"I'll pay it all right. Give me time."</p>
<p>"What time?"</p>
<p>"We are cutting the oaks at Selincourt. They should all be down by the
autumn. I can get an advance then that will clear all that I owe you."</p>
<p>"I don't want to press you, Charles. If you would like a sporting flutter to
clear your debt, I'm ready to give It to you at once."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, double or quits. Six thousand or nothing. If you're not afraid to
take a chance, I'll let you have one."</p>
<p>"Afraid, John. I don't like that word."</p>
<p>"You were always a brave gamester, Charles. Just as you like in the matter.
But you might clear yourself with a turn of the card, while, on the other hand,
if all the Selincourt timber is going, six thousand will be no more to you than
three."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a sporting offer, John. You say the turn of a card. Do you mean
one simple draw?"</p>
<p>"Why not? Sudden death. Win or lose. What say you?"</p>
<p>"I agree."</p>
<p>A pack of cards was lying on a near-by table. Hawker stretched out a long
arm and picked them up.</p>
<p>"Will thee do?"</p>
<p>"By all means."</p>
<p>He spread them out with a sweep of his hand.</p>
<p>"Do you care to shuffle?"</p>
<p>"No, John. Take them as they are."</p>
<p>"Shall it be a single draw?"</p>
<p>"By all means."</p>
<p>"Will you lead?"</p>
<p>Sir Charles Trevor was a seasoned gambler, but never before had three
thousand pounds hung upon the turn of a single card. But he was a reckless
plunger, and roared with laughter as he turned up the queen of clubs.</p>
<p>"That should do you, John."</p>
<p>"Possibly," said Hawker, and turned the ace of spades.</p>
<p>"I thought I had cleared myself, and now it is six thousand," cried Trevor,
and staggered as he rose from his seat.</p>
<p>" To wait until the oaks are cut," said Hawker. "In September I ahall
present my little bill. Meanwhile, perhaps a note of hand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you doubt my word, John!"</p>
<p>"No, no, Charles, but business is business. Who knows what may happen? I'll
have a note of hand."</p>
<p>"Very good. You'll have it by the post tomorrow. Well, I bear no grudge. The
luck was yours. Shall we have a glass upon it?"</p>
<p>"You were always a brave loser, Charles." The two men walked together to the
little bar in the corner.</p>
<p>Had either looked back he would have seen a sight which would have surprised
him. During the whole incident the little bookmaker had sat absorbed over his
accounts, but with a pair of piercing eyes glancing up every now and then at
the two gamblers. Little of their talk had been audible from where he sat, but
their actions had spoken for themselves. Now, with amazing, but furtive, speed
he stole across, picked up one card from the table and hurried back to his
perch, concealing it inside his coat. The two gentlemen, having taken their
refreshment, turned toward the boxing saloon; Sir Charles disappearing through
the swing-door, from behind which came the thud of heavy blows, the breathing
of hard-spent men, and every now and then a murmur of admiration or of
criticism.</p>
<p>Hawker was about to follow his companion when a thought struck him and he
returned to the card table, gathering up the scattered cards. Suddenly he was
aware that Jakes was at his elbow and that two very shrewd and malignant eyes
were looking up into his own.</p>
<p>"Hadn't you best count them, my noble sportsman?"</p>
<p>"What d'you mean?" The Devll'a great black brows were drawn down and his
glance was like a rapier-thrust.</p>
<p>"If you count them you'll find one missing."</p>
<p>"Why are you grinning at me, you rascal?"</p>
<p>"One card missing, my noble sportsman. A good winning card, too&mdash;the
ace of spades. A useful card, Sir John."</p>
<p>"Where is it, then?"</p>
<p>"Little Billy Jakes has It. It's here"&mdash;and he slapped his breast.
pocket. "A little playing card with the mark of a thumb-nail on one eorner of
the back."</p>
<p>"You Infernal blackguard!"</p>
<p>Jakes was no coward , but he shrank away from that terrible face. "Hands
off, my noble sportsman! Hands off, for your own sake! You can knock me about.
That's easily done. But it won't end there. I've got the card. I could eall
back Sir Charles and fill this room in a jiffy. There would be an end of you,
my beauty."</p>
<p>"It's all a lie&mdash;a lie."</p>
<p>"Right you are. Say so, if you like. Shall I call in the others, and you can
prove it a lie? Shall I show the cards to Lord Rufton and the rest?"</p>
<p>Hawker's dark faace was moving convulsively. His hands were twitching with
hia desire to break the back of this little weasel across his knee. With an
effort, he mastered himself.</p>
<p>"Hold on, Jakes. We have always been great friends. What do you want? Speak
low or the girl will hear."</p>
<p>"Now, that's talking. You got six thousand just now. I want half."</p>
<p>"You want three thousand pounds. What for?"</p>
<p>"You're a man of sense. You know what for. I've a tongue, and I can hold it
if it's worth my while."</p>
<p>Hawker considered for a moment. "Well, suppose I agree."</p>
<p>"Then we can fix it so."</p>
<p>"Say no more. We will consider it as agreed."</p>
<p>He turned away, his mind full of plans by which he could gain time and
disavow the whole business. But Jakes was not a man so easily fooled. Many
people had found that to their cost.</p>
<p>"Hold on, my noble sportsman. Hold on an instant. Just a word of writing to
settle it."</p>
<p>"You dog, is my word not enough?"</p>
<p>"No, Sir John, not by a long way... No, if you hit me I'll yell. Keep your
hands off. I tell you I want your signature to it."</p>
<p>"Not a word."</p>
<p>"Very good then. It's finished." Jakes started for the door of the
saloon.</p>
<p>"Hold hard! What am I to write?"</p>
<p>"I'll do the writing." He turned to the little alcove where Lucy, who was
accustomed to every sort of wrangling and argument, was dozing among her
bottles.</p>
<p>"Here, my dear; wake up! I want pen and ink."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"And paper?"</p>
<p>"There is a billhead. Will that do? Dearie me, it's marked with wine!"</p>
<p>"Never mind; that will do."</p>
<p>Jakes seated himself at a table and scribbled while Hawker watched him with
eyes of death. Jakes walked over to him with the scrawl completed. Hawker read
it over in a low mutter:</p>
<p>"'In consideration of your silence&mdash;'" He paused and glared.</p>
<p>"Well, that's true, ain't it? You don't give me half for the love of William
J akes, Esquire, do you now?"</p>
<p>"Curse you, Jakes! Curse you to hell!"</p>
<p>" Let it. out. my noble sportsman. Let it out or you'll bust. Curse me
again. Then sign that paper."</p>
<p>"'The sum of three thousand pounds, to be paid on the date when there is a
settlement between me and Sir Charles Trevor.' Well, give me the pen and have
done. There! Now give me that card."</p>
<p>Jakes had thrust the signed paper into his inner pocket.</p>
<p>"Give me the card, I say!"</p>
<p>"When the money is paid, Sir John. That's only fair."</p>
<p>"You devil!"</p>
<p>"Can't find the right word, can you? It'll not been invented yet, I
expect."</p>
<p>Jakes may have been very near his death at that moment. The furious passions
of the bully had reached a point when even his fears of exposure could hardly
hold him in check. But the saloon door had swung open and Cribb entered the
room. He looked with surprise at the ill-assorted couple.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Jakes, time is up, you know. You've passed your hours."</p>
<p>"I know, Tom, but I had an important settling-up with Sir John Hawker. Had I
not, Sir John?"</p>
<p>"You've missed the first bout, Sir John. Come and see Jack Randall take a
novice."</p>
<p>Hawker took a last scowl at the book-maker and followed the champion into
the saloon. Jakes gathered up his papers into his professional bag and went
across to the little bar.</p>
<p>"A double brandy, my dear," said he to Lucy. "I've had a good evening, but
it's been a bit of a strain upon my nerves."</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>IT WAS late in September that the grand old ancestral oaks of Selincourt
were given over to the contractor, and that their owner, having at last a large
balance at his bankers', was able to redeem the more pressing of his debts. It
was only a day later that Sir John Hawker, with Sir Charles' note of hand for
six thousand pounds in his pocket, found himself riding down the highroad at
Six-Mile Bottom near Newmarket. His mount was a great black stallion as
powerful and sinister as himself. He was brooding over his own rather
precarious affairs, which involved every shilling which he could raise, when
there was the click of hoofs beside him and there was Billy Jakes upon his
well- known chestnut cob.</p>
<p>"Good evening, my noble sportsman," said he. "I was looking out for you at
the stables, and when I saw you ride away, I thought it was time to come after
you. I want my settlement, Sir John."</p>
<p>"What settlement? What are you talking of?"</p>
<p>"Your written promise to pay three thousand. I know you have had your
money."</p>
<p>"I don' t know what you are talking about. Keep clear of me or you will get
a cut or two from this hunting crop."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the game, is it? We will see about that. Do you deny your
signature upon this paper?"</p>
<p>"Have you the paper on you?"</p>
<p>"What's that to you?"</p>
<p>"It was not wise, Billy Jakes, to trust yourself alone upon a country road
with one of the most dangerous men in England. For once your cupidity has been
greater than your shrewdness."</p>
<p>A quick glance of those deadly, dark eyes to right and to left, and then the
heavy hunting crop came down with a crash upon the bookmaker's head. With a
cry, he dropped from the cob, and he had hardly reached the ground before the
Devil had sprung from the saddle, and, with his left arm through his bridle
rein to hold down his plunging horse, he was rapidly running his right hand
through the pockets of the protrate man. With a bitter curse, he realised that
however imprudent Jakes had been, he had not been such a fool as to carry his
papers about with him.</p>
<p>Hawker rose, looked down at his half-conscious enemy, and then slowly drew
his spur across his face. A moment later he had sprung into his saddle and was
on his way London-wards, leaving the sprawling and bleedIng figure in the dust
of the highway. He laughed with exultation as he rode, for vengeance was sweet
to him, and he seldom missed it. What could Jakes do? If he took him into the
criminal courts, it was only such an assault as was common enough in those days
of vlolence. If, on the other hand, he pursued the matter of the card and the
agreement, it was an old story now, and who would take the word of the
notorious bookmaker against that of one of the best-known men in London! Of
course, it was a case of forgery and blackmail. Hawker looked down at his
bloody spur and felt well oontent with his morning's work.</p>
<p>Jakes was raised to his feet by some kindly traveler and was brought back,
half-conscious, to Newmarket. There, for three days, he kept his room and
nursed both his injuries and his grievance. Upon the fourth day he reached
London, and that night he made his way to the Albany and knocked at a door
which bore upon a shining brass plate the name or Sir Charles Trevor.</p>
<p>It was the first Tuesday of the month, the day on which the committee of
Watier's Club was wont to assemble. Half a dozen of them had sauntered into the
great board-room, decorated with heavy canvases on the walla, and with highly
polished dark mahogany furniture, which showed up richly against the huge
expanse of red Kidderminster carpet. The Duke of Bridgewater, a splendid,
rubicund old gentleman, grey-haired but virile, leaning heavily upon an amber-
headed cane, came hobbling in and bowed affably to the waiting committee&shy;-
men.</p>
<p>"How Is the gout, Your Grace?"</p>
<p>"A little sharp at times. But I can still get my foot into the stirrup.
Well, well , I suppose we had better get to work." He took his seat in the
centre of a half-moon table at one end of the room. Raising his quizzing-glass
he looked round him.</p>
<p>"Where is Lord Foley?"</p>
<p>"He is racng, Sir. He will not he here."</p>
<p>"The dog! He takes his duties too lightly. I would rather be on the heath
myself."</p>
<p>"I expect we all would."</p>
<p>"Ah, is that you, Lord Rufton?... How are you, Colonel D'Acre!... Bunbury,
Scott, Poyntz, Vandeleur, good-day to you! Where is Sir Charles Trevor?"</p>
<p>"He is in the members' room," said Lord Rufton. "He said he would wait Your
Grace's pleasure. The fact is that he has a personal interest in a case which
comes before us, and he thought he should not have a hand in judging it."</p>
<p>"Ah, very delicate! Very delicate indeed!" The Duke had taken up the agenda
paper and stared at it through his glass. "Dear me, dear me! A member accused
of cheating at cards! And Sir John Hawker too! One of the best-known men in the
club. Too bad! Too bad! Who is the accuser?"</p>
<p>"A bookmaker named Jakes, Your Grace!"</p>
<p>"I know him. Has a stand at Tom Cribb's. A rascal if ever I saw one.
However, we must look into it. Who has the matter in hand?"</p>
<p>"I have been asked to attend to it," said Lord Rufton.</p>
<p>"I am not lure," said the Duke, "that we are right in taking notice of what
such a fellow says about a member of this club. Surely, the law courts are
open."</p>
<p>"I entirely agree with Your Grace," said a solemn man upon the Duke's left.
He was General Scott, who was said to live on toast and water, and win ten
thousand a year from his more sober companions.</p>
<p>"I would point out to you, sir, that the alleged cheating was at the expense
of Sir Charles Trevor, a member of the club. It was not Sir Charles, however,
who moved in the matter. There was a violent quarrel between the man Jakes and
Sir John Hawker, and this is the result."</p>
<p>"Then the bookmaker has brought the case before us for revenge," said the
Duke. "We must move carefully in this matter. I think we had best see Sir
Charles first. Call Sir Charles."</p>
<p>The tall red-plushed footman at the door disappeared. A moment later, Sir
Charles, dehonair and smiling, stood before the committee.</p>
<p>"Good day, Sir Charles," said the Duke. "This is a very painful
business."</p>
<p>"Very, Your Grace."</p>
<p>"I understand from what is on the agenda paper that on May third, of this
year, you met Sir John at Cribb's Parlour and you cut cards with him at three
thousand pounds a cut."</p>
<p>"A single cut, Your Grace."</p>
<p>"And you lost?"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately."</p>
<p>"Well, now, did you in any way suspect foul play at the time?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least."</p>
<p>"Then you have no charge against Sir John!"</p>
<p>"None on my own behalf. Other people have something to say."</p>
<p>"Well, we can listen to them in their turn. Won' t you take a chair, Sir
Charles? Even if you do not vote, there can be no objection to your presence.
Is Sir John in attendance?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>"And the witness?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen, it is clearly a very serious matter, and I understand that
Sir John is a difficult person to deal with. However, we can make no
exceptions, and we are numerous enough and have, I trust, sufficient social
weight to carry this affair to a conclusion." He ranG for the footman.</p>
<p>"Place a chair in the centre, please! Now tell Sir John Hawker the committee
would be honoured if he would step this way."</p>
<p>A moment later the formidable face and figure of the Devil had appeared at
the door. With a scowl at the members present, he strode forward, bowed to the
Duke, and seated himself opposite the semicircle formed by the committee.</p>
<p>"In the first place, Sir John," said the Duke, "you will allow me to express
my regret and that of your fellow members that it should be our unpleasant duty
to ask you to appear before us. No doubt the matter will prove to be a mere
misunderstanding, but we felt that it was due to your own reputation as well as
to that of the club that no time should be lost In setting the matter
right."</p>
<p>"Your Crace," said Hawker, leaning forward and emphasising his remarks with
his clenched hand, "I protest strongly against these proceedings. I have come
here because it shall never be said that I was shy of meeting any charge,
however preposterous. But I would put it to you, gentlemen, that no man's
reputation is safe if the committee of his club is prepared to take up any
vague slander that may circulate against him."</p>
<p>"Kindly read the terms of the charge, Lord Rufton."</p>
<p>"The assertion is," he read, "that at ten o'clock on the night of Thursday,
May third, in the parlour of Tom Cribb'a house, the Union Arms, Sir John Hawker
did, by means of marked cards, win money from Sir Charles Trevor, both being
members of Watier's Club."</p>
<p>Hawker sprang from his chair. "It is a lie&mdash;a damned lie!" he
cried.</p>
<p>The Duke held up a deprecating hand. "No doubt&mdash;no doubt. I think,
however, Sir John, that you can hardly describe it as a vague slander."</p>
<p>"It is monstrous! What is to prevent such a charge being leveled at Your
Grace? How would you like, sir, to be dragged up before your fellow
members?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Sir John," said the Duke urbanely. "The question at present is
not what might be preferred against me, but what actually is preferred against
you. You will, I am sure, appreciate the distinction. What do you propose, Lord
Rufton?"</p>
<p>"It is my unpleaeant duty, Sir John," said Lord Rufton, "to array the
evidence before the committee. You will , I am sure, acquit me of any personal
feeling in the matter."</p>
<p>"I look on you, sir, as a damned mischievous busybody."</p>
<p>The Duke put up his pudgy many-ringed hand in protest.</p>
<p>"I am afraid, Sir John, that I must ask you to be more guarded in your
language. To me, it is immaterial, but I happen to know that General Scott has
an objection to swearing. Lord Rufton is merely doing his duty in presenting
the case."</p>
<p>Hawker shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>
<p>"I protest against the whole proceedings," he said.</p>
<p>"Your protest will be duly entered in the minutes. We have heard, before you
entered, the evidence of Sir Charles Trevor. He has no personal complaint. So
far as I can see, there is no case."</p>
<p>"Ha! Your Grace is a man of sense. Was ever an indignity put upon a man or
honor on so small a pretext?"</p>
<p>"There is further evidence, Your Grace," said Lord Rufton. "I will call Mr.
William Jakes."</p>
<p>At a summons the gorgeous footman swung open the massive door and Jakes was
ushered in. It was a month or more since the assault, but the spur mark still
shone red across his sallow cheek. He held hie cloth cap in his hand, and
rounded his back as a tribute to the oompany, but his cunning little eyes, from
under their ginger lashes, twinkled knowingly, not to say impudently, as
ever.</p>
<p>"You are William Jakes, the bookmaker? " said the Duke.</p>
<p>"The greatest rascal in London," interpolated Hawker.</p>
<p>"There is one greater within three yards of me," the little man snarled.
Then, turning to the Duke: "I'm William Jakes, Your Worship, known as Billy
Jakes at Tattersall's. If you want to back a horse, Your WorshIp, or care to
buy a game-cock or a ratter, you'll get the best price&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence, sir," said Lord Rufton. "Advance to this chair."</p>
<p>"Certainly, my noble sportsman."</p>
<p>"Don't sit. Stand beside it."</p>
<p>"At your servlce, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"Shall I cross-examine, Your Grace?"</p>
<p>"I understand, Jakes, that you were In Cribb's back parlour on the night of
May third of this year?"</p>
<p>"Lord bless you, Sir, I 'm there every night. It's where I meet my noble
Corinthians."</p>
<p>"It is a sporting house, I understand."</p>
<p>"Well, my lord, I can't teach you much about it." There was a titter from
the committee, and the Duke broke in.</p>
<p>"I dare say we have all enjoyed Tom's hospitality at one time or another,"
he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, Your Grace. Well I remember the night when you danced on the
crossed 'baccy pipes."</p>
<p>"Keep your witness to the point," said the smiling Duke.</p>
<p>"Tell us now what you saw pass between Sir John Hawker and Sir Charles
Trevor."</p>
<p>"I saall there was to see, You can trust little Billy Jakes for that. There
was to be a cutting game. Sir John reached out for the cards, which lay on
another table. I had seen him look over those cards in advance and turn the end
of one or two with his thumb nail."</p>
<p>"You liar!" cried Si r John.</p>
<p>"It's an easy trick to mark them so that none can see. I've done&mdash;I
know another man that can do it. You must keep your right thumb nail long and
sharp. Well, look at Sir John's now."</p>
<p>Hawker sprang from his chair. "Your Grace, am I to be exposed to these
insults?"</p>
<p>"Sit down, Sir John. Your indignation is most natural. I suppose it is not a
fact that your right thumb-nail&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly not!"</p>
<p>"Ask to see!" cried Jakes.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would not mind showing your nail?"</p>
<p>"I will do nothing of the kind."</p>
<p>"Of course you are quite within your rights in refusing&mdash;quite," said
the Duke. "Whether your refusal might in any way prejudice your case is a point
which you have no doubt considered... Pray continue, Jakes."</p>
<p>"Well, they cut and Sir John won. When be turned his back, I got the winning
card, and saw that it was marked. I showed it to Sir John when we were
alone."</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p>
<p>"Well, my lord, I wouldn't like to repeat before such select company as this
some of the things he laid. He carried on shocking. But after a bit he saw the
game was up and he consented to my having half shares."</p>
<p>"Then," said the Duke, "you became, by your own admission, the compounder of
a felony."</p>
<p>Jakes gave a comical grimace.</p>
<p>"No breaks here! This ain't a court, is it? Just a private house, as one
might say, with one gentleman chatting easylike with other ones. Well, then,
that's just what I did do."</p>
<p>The Duke shrugged hie shoulders. "Really, Lord Rufton, I do not see how we
can attach any importance to the word of such a witness. On his own confession
he is a perfect rascal."</p>
<p>"Your Grace, I'm surprised at you!"</p>
<p>"I would not condemn any man&mdash;far less the member of an honorable
club&mdash;on this man's word."</p>
<p>"I quite agree. Your Grace," said Rufton. "There are, however, some
corroborative documents."</p>
<p>"Yes, my noble sportsmen," cried Jake in a sort of ecstasy, "there's lots
more to come. Billy's got a bit up his sleeve for a finish. How's that?" He
pulled a pack of cards from his pocket and singled one out. "That's the pack.
Look at the ace. You can see the mark yet."</p>
<p>The Duke examined the card. "There is certainly a mark," he said, "which
might well be made by a sharpened nail."</p>
<p>Sir John was up once more, his face dark with wrath.</p>
<p>" Really, gentlemen, there should be some limit to this foolery. Of course
these are the cards. Is it not obvious that after Sir Charles and I had left,
this fellow gathered them up and marked them so as to put forward a
blackmailing demand? I only&mdash;I only wonder that he has not forged some
document to prove that I admitted this monstrous charge."</p>
<p>Jakes threw up his hands in admiration.</p>
<p>"By George, you have a nerve! I always said it. Give me Devil Hawker for
nerve. Grasp the nettle, eh? Here's the document he talks about." He handed a
paper to Lord Rufton.</p>
<p>"Would you be pleased to read it?" said the Duke.</p>
<p>Rufton read: "'In consideration of services rendered, I promise William
Jakes three thousand pounds when I settle with Sir Charles Trevor. Signed, John
Hawke.'"</p>
<p>"A palpable forgery! I guessed as much, cried Sir John.</p>
<p>"Who knows Sir John's signature?"</p>
<p>"I do," said Sir Charles Sunbury,</p>
<p>"Is that it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so."</p>
<p>"Tut, the fellow is a born forger!" cried Hawker.</p>
<p>The Duke looked at the back of the paper, and read: "'To Thomas Cribb,
Licensed Dealer in Beer, Wine, Spirits and Tobacco.' It is certainly paper from
the room alluded to."</p>
<p>"He could help himself to that."</p>
<p>"Exactly. The evidence is by no means convincing. At the same time, Sir
John, I am compelled to tell you that the way in which you anticipated the
evidence has produced a very unpleasant impression in my mind."</p>
<p>"I knew what the fellow was capable of."</p>
<p>"Do you admit being intimate with him?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"You had nothing to do with him?"</p>
<p>"I had occasion recently to horsewhip him for insolence. Hence this charge
against me."</p>
<p>"You knew him very slightly?"</p>
<p>"Hardly at all."</p>
<p>"You did not correspond!"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"Strange, then, that he should have been able to copy your signature if he
had no letter of yours."</p>
<p>"I know nothing of that."</p>
<p>"You quarreled with him recently?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. He was impertinent and I beat him."</p>
<p>"Had you any reason to think you would quarrel?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Does it not seem strange to you then that he should have been keeping the
cards all these weeks to buttress up a false charge againt you, if he had no
idea that an occasion for such a charge would ever arise?"</p>
<p>"I cannot answer for his actions," said Hawker in a sullen voice.</p>
<p>"Of course not. At the same time I am forced to repeat, Sir John, that your
anticipatlon of this document has seemed to me exactly what might be expected
from a man of strong character who knew that such a document existed."</p>
<p>"I am not responsible for this man's assertions, nor can I control Your
Grace's speculations, save to say that so far as they threaten my honour, they
are contemptible and absurd. I place my case in the bands of the committee. You
know, or can easily learn, the character of this man Jakes. Is it possible that
you can hesitate between the words of such a man and the character of one who
has for years been a fellow member of this club?"</p>
<p>"I am bound to say, Your Grace," said Sir Charles Dunbury, "that, while I
associate myself with every remark which has fallen from you, I am still of the
opinion that the evidence is of so corrupt a character that it would be
impossible for us to take action upon it."</p>
<p>"That is also my opinion," came from several of the committee, and there was
a general murmur of acquiescence.</p>
<p>"I thank you, gentlemen," said Hawker, rising. "With your permission, I
shall bring this sitting to an end."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir; there are two more witnesses," said Lord Rufton.</p>
<p>"Jakes, you can withdraw. Leave the documents with me."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my lord. Good-day, my noble sportsmen. Should any of you want a
cock or a terrier&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That will do. Leave the room." With many bows and backward glances, William
Jakes vanished frum the scene.</p>
<p>"I should like to ask Tom Cribb one or two questions," said Lord Rufton.
"Call Tom Cribb."</p>
<p>A moment later the burly figure of the champion came heavily into the room.
He was dressed exactiy like the pictures of John Bull, with blue coat with
shining brass buttons, drab trousers and top-boots, while his face, in its
broad, bovine serenity, was also the very image of the national prototype. On
his head he wore a low-crowned, curly-brimmed hat, which he now whipped off and
stuffed under his arm. The worthy Tom was much more alarmed than ever he had
been in the ring, and looked helplessly about him like a bull who finds himself
in a strange enclosure.</p>
<p>"My respects, gentlemen all!" he repeated several times, touching his
forelock.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Tom," said the Duke affably. "Take that chair. How are
you?"</p>
<p>"Damned hot, Your Grace. That is to say, very warm. You see, sir, I do my
own marketing these days, and when you've been down to Covent Oarden and then
on to Smithfield, and then trudge back here, and you two stone above your
fighting weight&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We quite understand. The chief steward will see to you presently."</p>
<p>"I want to ask you, Tom," said Lord Rufton, "do you remember the evening of
May third last in your parlour?"</p>
<p>"I heard there was some barney about it, and I've been lookin' it up," said
Tom. "Yes, I remember it well, for it was the night when a novice had the
better of old Ben Burn. Lor', I couldn't but laugh. Old Ben got one on the mark
in the first round, and before he could get his wind&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind, Tom. We'll have that later. Do you recognise these cards?"</p>
<p>"Why, those cards are out of my parlour. I get them a dozen at a time, a
shllhng each, from Ned Summers of Oxford Street; the same what&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, that's settled then. Now, do you remember seeing Sir John here and
Sir Charles Trevor that evening!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. I remember saying to Sir John that he must play light with my
novices, for there was one cove, Bill Summers hy name, out of Norwich, and when
Sir John&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind that, Tom, Tell us, now, did you see Sir John and the bookmaker,
Jakes, together that night? "</p>
<p>"Jakes was there, for he says to the girl in the bar, 'How much money have
you, my lass?' And I said, 'You dirty dog&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Enough, Tom. Did you see the man Jakes and Sir John together?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; when I came into the parlour after the bout between Shelton and
Scroggins. I saw the two of them alone, and Jakes, he said that they had done
business together. "</p>
<p>"Did they seem friendly?"</p>
<p>"Well, now you ask it, Sir John didn't seem too pleased. But, Lord love you,
I'm that busy those evenings that if you dropped a shot on my head I'd hardly
notice it."</p>
<p>"Nothing more to tell us?"</p>
<p>"I don't know as I have. I'd be glad to get back to my bar."</p>
<p>"Very good, Tom. You can go."</p>
<p>"I'd just remind you gentlemen that it's my benefit at the Five Court, St.
Martin's Lane, come Tuesday week." Tom bobbed hill bullet-head many times and
departed.</p>
<p>"Not much in all that," remarked the Duke. "Does that finish the case?"</p>
<p>"There is one more, Your Grace. Call the girl Lucy. She is the girl of the
private bar."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I remember," cried the Duke. "That is to say, by akk means. What
does this young person know ahout it?"</p>
<p>"I believe that she was present." As Lord Rftton spoke, Lucy, very nervous,
but cheered by the knowledge that she was in her best Sunday clothes, appeared
at the door.</p>
<p>"Don't be nervous, my girl. Take this chair," laid Lord Rufton kindly.
"Don't keep on curtsying. St down."</p>
<p>The girl sat timidly on the edge of the chair. Suddenly her eyes caught
those of the august chairman.</p>
<p>"Why, Lord bless me!" she said. "It's the little Duke!"</p>
<p>"Hush, my girl, hush"" His Grace held up a warning hand.</p>
<p>"Well, I never!" cried Lucy, and began to giggle and hide her blushing face
In her handkerchief.</p>
<p>"Now, now!" said the Duke. "This is a grave business! What are you laughing
at?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't help it, sir. I was thinking of that evening down in the private
bar when you bet you could walk a chalk line with a bottle of champarne on your
head."</p>
<p>There was a general laugh, in which the Duke joined.</p>
<p>"I fear, gentlemen , I must have had a couple in my head before 1 ventured
such a feat. Now, my good girl, we did not ask you here for the sake of your
reminiscences. You may have seen some of us unbending: but we will let that
pass... You were in the bar on May the third?"</p>
<p>"I'm always there."</p>
<p>"Cast your mind back and recall the evening when Sir Charles Trevor and Sir
John Hawker proposed to cut cards for money."</p>
<p>"I remember it well, sir."</p>
<p>"After the others had left the bar, Sir John and a man named Jakes are said
to have remained behind."</p>
<p>"I saw them."</p>
<p>"It's a lie! It's a plotl" cried Hawker.</p>
<p>"Now, Sir John, I must really beg you!" It was the Duke who was cross-
questioning now. "Describe to us what you saw."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, they began talking over a pack of cards. Sir John up with his
hand, and I was about to call for West Country Dick&mdash;he's the chucker-out
you know, sir, at the Union Arms&mdash;but no blow passed and they talked very
earnest-like for a time. Then Mr. Jakes called for paper and wrote something,
and that's all I know except that Sir John seemed very upset."</p>
<p>"Did you ever see that piece of paper before?" The Duke held it up.</p>
<p>"Why, air. it looks like Mr. Cribb's bill-head."</p>
<p>"Exactly. Was It a piece like that which you gave to these gentlemen that
night!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Could you distinguish it?"</p>
<p>" Why, sir, now that I come to think of it, I could."</p>
<p>Hawker sprang up with a convulsed face. "I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going."</p>
<p>"No, no; Sir John. Sit down again. Your honour demands Your presence...
Well, my good girl, you say you could recognise it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I could. There was a mark, sir. I drew some burgundy for Sir
Charles, sir, and some slopped on the counter. The paper Wall marked with It on
the aide. I was in doubt if I should give them so soiled a piece."</p>
<p>The Duke looked very grave. "Gentlemen, this is a serious matter. There is,
as you see, a red stain upon the side of the paper. Have you any remark to
make, Sir John?"</p>
<p>"A conspiracy, Your Grace! An infernal, devilish plot against a gentleman's
honour."</p>
<p>"Vou may go, Lucy." said Lord Rufton, and with curtsies and giggles, the
barmaid disappeared.</p>
<p>"You have heard the evidence, gentlemen," said the Duke. "Some of you may
know the character of this girl, which is by all accounts excellent."</p>
<p>"A drab out of the gutter!"</p>
<p>"I think not, Sir John; nor do you improve your poaition by such assertions.
You will each have your own impression as to how far the girl's account seemed
honest and carried conviction with it. You will observe that had she merely
intended to injure Sir John, her obvious method would have been to have said
she overheard the conversation detailed by the witness, Jakes. This she has not
done. Her account, however, tends to corroborate&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Your Grace," cried Hawker, "I have had enough of this!"</p>
<p>"We shall not detain you much longer, Sir John Hawker," said the chairman,
"but for that limited time we must insist upon your presence."</p>
<p>"Insist, sir!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, insist."</p>
<p>"This is strange talk."</p>
<p>"Be seated, sir. This matter must go to a finish."</p>
<p>"Well!" Hawker fell back into his chair.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the Duke, "Slips of paper are before you. After the custom
of the club, you will kindly record your opinion and hand to me. Mr. Poyntz? I
thank you. Vandeleur! Bunbury! Hurton! General Scott! Colonel Turton! I thank
you."</p>
<p>He exminded the papers. "Exactly. You are unanimous! I may say that I
entirely agree with your opinion." The Duke's rosy kindly face had set as hard
as flint.</p>
<p>"What am I to understand by this, sir" cried Hawker.</p>
<p>"Bring the club book," said the Duke. Lord Rufton carried across a large
brown volume from the side-table and opened it before the chairman.</p>
<p>"C, D, E, F, G&mdash;Ah, here we are&mdash;H. Let us see! Houston, Harcourt,
Hume, Duke of Hamilton I have it&mdash;Hawker. Sir John Hawker, your name is
forever erased from the book of Watier'a Club."</p>
<p>He drew the pen across the page as he spoke. Hawker sprang frantically to
his feet.</p>
<p>"You cannot mean it! Consider, sir; this is social ruin! Where shall I show
my face if I am cast from my c1ub? I could not walk the streets of London. Take
it back, sir! Reconsider it!"</p>
<p>"Sir John Hawker, "we can only refer you to Rule 19. It says: 'If any member
shall be guilty of conduct unworthy of an honourable man, and the said offense
be established to the unanimous satisfaction of the committee, then the
aforesaid member shall be expelled the club without appeal.'"</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," cried Hawker, "I beg you not to be precipitate! You have had
the evidence of a rascal bookmaker and of a serving wench. Is that enough to
ruin a gentleman's life? I am undone if this goes through."</p>
<p>"The matter has been considered and is now in order. We can only refer you
to Rule 19."</p>
<p>"Your Grace, you cannot know what this will mean. How can I Iive? Where can
I go? I never asked mercy of man bfore. But I ask it now. I implore it,
gentlemen. Reconsider your decision!"</p>
<p>"Rule 19."</p>
<p>"It is ruin, I tell you&mdash;disgrace and ruin!"</p>
<p>"Rule 19."</p>
<p>"Let me resign. Do not expel me."</p>
<p>"Rule 19."</p>
<p>It was hopeless, and Hawker knew it. He strode in front of the table.</p>
<p>"Curse your rules! Curse you, too, you silly, babbling jackanapes. Curse you
all&mdash;you, Vandeleur, and you, Poyntz, and you, Scott, you doddering
toast-and-water gamester. You will live to mourn the day you put this indignity
upon me. You will answer it&mdash;every man of you! I'll set my mark on you. By
the Lord I will! You first, Rufton. One by one, I'II weed you out! I've a
bullet for each. I'll number 'em!"</p>
<p>"Sir John Hawker," said the Duke, "this club is for the use of members only.
May I ask you to take yourself out of it?"</p>
<p>"And if I don't&mdash;what then?"</p>
<p>The Duke turned to General Scott. "Will you ask the hall porters to step
up?"</p>
<p>"There! I'll go!" yelled Hawker. "I will not be thrown out&mdash;the
laughing stock of Jermyn Street. But you will hear more, gentlemen. You will
remember me yet. Rascals! Rascals everyone!"</p>
<p>And so it was, raving and stamping, with his clenched hands waving above his
head, that Devil Hawker passed out from Watier's Club and from the social life
of London.</p>
<p>For it was his end. In vain he sent furious challenges to the members of the
committee. He was outside the pale, and no one would condescend to meet him. In
vain he thrashed Sir Charles Bunbury in front of Limmer's Hotel. Hired ruffians
were put upon his track and he was terribly thrashed in return. Even the
bookmakers would have no more to do with him, and he was warned off the turf.
Down he sank, and down, drinking to uphold his spirits until he was but a
bloated wreck of the man that he had been.</p>
<p>And so, at last, one morning in his rooms in Charles Street, that dueling
pistol which had so often been the instrument of his vengeance was turned upon
himself, and that dark face, terrible even in death, was found outlined against
a blood-sodden pillow in the morning.</p>
<p>So put the print back among the pile. You may be the better for having
honest Tom Cribb upon your wall, or even the effeminate Brummell. But Devil
Hawker never, in life or deat, brought luck to anyone. Leave him there where
you found him, In the dusty old shop of Drury Lane.</p>

<br>
<p>Kid Wilson's natural home would seem to be the Atlantic, since neither
England nor America showed the least desire for his presence. However, in some
way he got himself smuggled to London, and there found his level instantly on
the edge of the criminal classes. Waldren and I used to meet him occasionally
at a small and very disreputable joint at the back of Soho&mdash;a place which
opened with the last postman and closed with the first milkman. One certainly
heard conversation there which was worth while. You can never, unfortunately,
make virtue as interesting as vice, for virtue is negative and vice is
positive. The man who does not do certain things is the better citizen, but he
has not the glamour of the man who does do them. It is sad but true.</p>
<p>When Kid Wilson got talking we were content to listen, for the world of
which he spoke was one which was unknown to us, and yet he had, in his own
rough way, the art of bringing it home to us. Sitting with chair at perilous
angle and a black cigar thrusting out from the corner of his mouth, he would
lead us into that strange underworld of the great American cities, where he was
clearly a very competent guide. Looking across the water, it was not, so far as
we could gather, the sheriffs or chiefs of police of whom he was afraid, but it
was his own confederates and fellow-criminals who had it in for him. It was a
silent lesson to us to watch him as he made his way out of our dive in the
early mornings. With his hand slipped beneath his coat tails, he would take the
sharp, quick glances of a hunted animal round each side of the door, before
ever he ventured his unsavoury person into the street.</p>
<p>Either his experience or his imagination was very great, and he could hold
us spellbound when he wished. On this particular night he started out upon a
long story. Waldren says that it is no use my repeating it, because the snap of
it depends upon the great American language. Well, perhaps I can talk a little
of that, too. Anyhow, I will try to get some suggestion of Wilson even as he
spoke.</p>
<p>"I could have done better", said he, "if it had not been for that old skirt
with the slop-pail. I'll give you what I can while it is clear in my mind.</p>
<p>"It's all about a certain burg in Amurrca. I won't give it a name, for it
might make trouble, and what I say would fit any one of a dozen. You'll just
figure it for yourselves as a wide-open burg, so wide open that it didn't seem
that as if any power on earth would ever get it shut again. The whole city
seemed to have gone rotten, from the mayor down to the bellhops. The crooks had
it in their hands, the bootleggers, the hi-jackers, the thugs, the racketeers,
the hold-up men, and the likes. You'll understand that the bootlegger and the
hi-jacker are mostly the same person, bootlegging on his own, and hi-jacking
the booze of the other guys. The police were got at, the judges were made safe,
the district attorney was squared, the mayor was seen. An honest juryman
wouldn't have a chance with an insurance office. The gangsters would take him
for a ride within a day of the verdict. It's no wonder that you would call
fifty venire men before you got one that would stick. There was no safety
anywhere. Even the State attorney was swinging a racket in gambling machines in
drug stores. Yes, sir, the lid was fairly off that old burg. I was there
helping, and I know, for I was beer-hustling myself till the police bought me
up.</p>
<p>"It came sort of gradual. It rather amused the decent citizen at first to
see these wops and dagoes laying each other out with automatics and Thompsons.
There were gang quarrels, where some guy with three i's in his name would claim
part of the city for his work, and another guy with three o's in his name would
come muscling in. Then there would be shooting, good and proper, and whoever
got hit there was one crook the less. But presently the decent citizen began to
understand that he was the next bird to be shot at. That woke him up some. Then
came the racketeers, and every store was put under blackmail, or the gorillas
would be let loose and the stuff thrown into the street with the owner on the
top of it. The money, too, was all on the side of the crooks, and money counts
over in God's Own Country. Oh, yes, it was fierce, and no one could see any way
out of it. But there was a way, and Gideon H. Fanshawe was the guy who found
it. I'll hand it to Gideon, I will.</p>
<p>"He was a strange man, was Gideon H. Fanshawe. Some thought he was loco and
some thought he was genius. He was rich, very rich, for he had been junior
partner of Gould and Fanshawe, the real-estate folk. He spent his life in the
library among books, sort of dreaming, but every now and then he kind of woke
up from his dream and then things began to happen. He woke up once and climbed
the highest peak in Alaska. Another time he woke up and killed three burglars
in his house. Then he woke up at the War-time, and no one saw him for a year,
when he came back with one foot missing and a French medal. Yes, he was a queer
guy and not too safe to handle&mdash;with a big think-box on the top, but a
mouth like a rat-trap and a man-eating jaw. He was awake now and takin' notice,
and somebody was goin' to hear about it. Lookit here, you folk, you can take it
from me that there are plenty of dangerous men in Amurrka, but the most
dangerous of all is just the ordinary citizen when you drive him in a corner
and there ain't no escape, except what he can horn out for himself. You've
heard tell of Vigilanties of San Francisco? Well, that's what I mean.</p>
<p>"For a month or more Gideon was just snooping round in his machine,
interviewing this man and interviewing that man, and feeling his way. Then
there were all-night meetings in his library, where the records of the big
shots of the law and the police were debated and addresses taken and plans
formed and everyone given the layout, and charged a grand each for the
expenses. At that time I was stool-pigeon for the police, and I was had up at
one or two of those meetings, where maybe a couple of hundred prominent
citizens were present, and where I would be asked questions about what I knew.
I was well paid, but I was told to keep my mouth shut or they would shut it for
me, and, by George, those boys meant what they said.</p>
<p>"There was one clean honest man in the office, and that was old Jack Barlow,
the Chief of the Police. He wasn't what you would call a strong man &mdash;they
would have had him out or shot him cold if he had been&mdash;but he was white
all through. One night Gideon Fanshawe went down to see John Barlow, and I'll
tell you what passed between them, but I have to tell it in my own way of
talking.</p>
<p>"After greetings Gideon looked round the room.</p>
<p>" 'Lookit here, John,' he asked, 'there ain't no detectiphones? No stenog.
round the corner?'</p>
<p>" 'Not with you, Mr. Fanshawe,' said the Chief, smiling and pushing over his
box of cigars, friendly like.</p>
<p>" 'Word of honour, John?'</p>
<p>" 'Yep. You may take it so.'</p>
<p>" 'Now, I'm talking turkey, John. Every word has its face value. First of
all, did you ever hear of the G.T.S. Society?'</p>
<p>" 'Can't say as I have. I'm fair hazed with all these societies.'</p>
<p>" 'Well, I'm here to tell you about it. There are two thousand of the best
citizens in this town in it, and the letters meat "Got to Stop."'</p>
<p>" 'Meaning the crooks and bootlegs?'</p>
<p>" 'Just so. Now, John, you know as well as I do that something has got to be
done. We all trust you. We know you are straight. But your power has gone. Your
own force is rotten from end to end. Is it not so?'</p>
<p>" 'I'd soon set it right, Mr. Fanshawe, if I had support. But what can I do?
These people have the money and they've bought up the whole crowd.'</p>
<p>" 'Except yourself.'</p>
<p>" 'No, Mr. Fanshawe, nor a few more that I could name. But what can we
do?'</p>
<p>" 'You can do nothing, John. That is why we are coming in to do it for you.
Now, first of all&mdash;excuse my plain talking&mdash;I know what your place is
worth.'</p>
<p>" 'Well, you can read that in city accounts. It is about the only true
figure you'll find.'</p>
<p>" 'Well, then'&mdash;Mr. Fanshawe drew a bundler of papers from his pocket
&mdash;'these are bearer bonds in first-class securities and you keep
them.'</p>
<p>" 'Mr. Fanshawe, you are insulting me. How can you say I am a white man and
yet put such a proposition before me?'</p>
<p>" 'Don't lose your hair, John. You don't quite see my meaning. You will keep
these bonds, John, as a guarantee that you don't suffer though anything we may
do. If you don't suffer, then you hand them back. But if you were to get fired
on account of what we did, then it is clear justice that we should make good
what we have caused you to lose. What have you say against that?'</p>
<p>" 'Well, as you put it, that sounds fair enough, Mr. Fanshawe. If I should
agree to risk my place for your sake&mdash;well, I'm a married man with a
family, and I've got to live. But it all depends on what you want me to do. If
it's crooked&mdash;cut it out. Forget it.'</p>
<p>" 'If it is against the crooks it can't be crooked. First of all, John, are
there any men at all under your orders who are straight?'</p>
<p>" 'Sure. I could name two hundred that I could swear by.'</p>
<p>" 'Then form these into one squad and order them to do as they are told on a
night I shall name. Keep all the others at head-quarters or any other place so
long as they are not on the streets. We don't want to hurt any cops if we can
help it, and they'll get hurt for sure if they horn in between the crooks and
us. Could you manage that?'</p>
<p>" 'Well, it would seem good sense.'</p>
<p>" 'Then I want you just to go for a joy ride that night where no telephones
can reach you, with orders to you deputy to touch nothing till you return. That
gives us a free hand, and that's all we ask.'</p>
<p>" 'But what are you trying to do, Mr. Fanshawe?'</p>
<p>" 'Well, just leave it at that, John. If you don't know then you can't be
held to be a partner. Just go and leave the rest to us. If all goes smooth,
then you hand back those bonds. If there is trouble and you get fired, then
you're none the worse. See?'</p>
<p>" 'Well, that's a bit fierce, Mr. Fanshawe. But there's my hand on it, and
I'll do as you say.'</p>
<p>"So that was that. And when May 14th came round, honest John simply did a
fade-away, while two hundred good harness bulls&mdash;that means cops in
uniform&mdash;reported to the Auditorium Hall, which was the head-quarters of
Gideon H. Fanshawe and his G.T.S. boys on that night.</p>
<p>"It was twelve o'clock when the whistle blew. All the crooks had been tabbed
down days before and there was no difficulty in finding them. Three hundred
automobiles full of hard-boiled citizens were after them, and the greater part
was rounded up. No wrens were touched. It was reckoned wiser to deal with the
men only. All over the city there were struggles and shootings, but all went as
planned. By one o'clock or after there was a row of machines two deep for four
blocks from the Hall, with heavily armed guards to each, and the prisoners
without arms inside. Then Phil Hudson, he was the man who led the raid, a
little hard guy that had been a flying ace in the War, reported to Fanshawe
that all was ready and in order.</p>
<p>"The Auditorium Hall was all lit up, and at one end Fanshawe was seated at a
high table with a dozen of his crowd, his lists and papers in front of him, and
every man with a gun on the table beside him. Behind him was his guard, twenty
men with shotguns, each with the G.T.S. badge on his arm. They were mostly
ex-service men in the G.T.S. Society. In the Hall were two or three hundred
more of them, and some of the general public such as myself. I told you I was
stool-pigeon for the police at the time, and I, like others, was there just to
give a nod here or there when it was a question of some guy identity, or shake
if he was talking blah.</p>
<p>"Phil Hudson, he came to the foot of the dais and saluted.</p>
<p>" 'We have all we could find, Chief,' said he. 'Some were tipped off, but
not too many.'</p>
<p>" 'How many have you, Phil?'</p>
<p>" 'A thousand or more.'</p>
<p>" 'Anyone hurt?'</p>
<p>" 'We had to shoot up ten or twelve of them. Six citizen were shot.'</p>
<p>" 'Too bad! Too bad! Well, we had best get to it. Send in the mayor
first.'</p>
<p>"Fat old Tom Baxter, a very surprised man, was led up, with a guard on each
side of him. He was a silly old butter-and-egg man, never done with the wrens,
and he was as corrupt as a graveyard.</p>
<p>" 'You shall pay for this, Mr. Fanshawe. What is the meaning of this
outrage?'</p>
<p>" 'We are here to clean up this town, Mr. Mayor, and we begin at the top.
The committee of the G.T.S. have examined the evidence in your case. You have
sheltered the crooks. You have taken their money. You have used your office as
it should not have been used. Take him away!'</p>
<p>" 'Take me away! Take me where?'</p>
<p>" 'To the Odeum. You'll have all your friends round you there. You won't be
lonely. Remove him.' "</p>
<p>So the mayor with a gat stuck into his ribs was walked down the aisle, and
then came the whole procession. First it was Burgess, the district attorney,
and a fine rage was in.</p>
<p>" 'I'll have the law on you for this, Mr. Fanshawe. Are you aware that I was
dragged out of my bedroom by these ruffians of yours, and that I have only my
pyjama suit underneath this slicker?'</p>
<p>" 'Too bad! Too bad!' said Fanshawe. 'But the citizens of this town are
dissatisfied with your conduct of your office, Mr. Attorney. They have examined
your case and it has gone against you.'</p>
<p>" 'What right have you?'</p>
<p>" 'The right of the people. All power springs from the people, Mr. Attorney,
and all power must answer to the people. You have taken money to let crooks
slip though the law. You have condoned murders. You have been the paid servant
of the gangsters. Take him to the Odeum.'</p>
<p>" 'What for?' The little overfed guy was shaking like a jelly.</p>
<p>" 'Let us say it is to have a photograph taken,' said Fanshawe. 'Anyhow, we
want you all in a bunch. Take him away.' "</p>
<p>"Then came Moltak, the big black Polack, boss of the South Side beer racket
who was said to have made five million bucks in two years. He was a great giant
of a man, all hair and muscles, and he glared murder at the men on the
dais.</p>
<p>" 'I get you. I get you for this,' he cried.</p>
<p>" 'Looks as if we had got you, Mr. Moltak,' said Fanshawe, with his quiet
smile. 'We've got twenty killings against you and your outfit. How many of them
have we, Hudson?'</p>
<p>" 'There are seventy-six outside.'</p>
<p>" 'Well, we can't make distinctions. They've all got to go. I'll see you
again at the Odeum, Moltak. Take him away and his whole gang along with
him.'</p>
<p>"The fellow tried to make a rough house, but they had his arms twisted and
he was helpless. There were some man-handlers, I tell you, among those ex-
service men. They raced him down and he made way for Genaro, boss of Societas
Meridionale. This slick little Southerner with his evening dress and his sissy
ways was up to his eyes in murder. He had been snapped up at some swell
gathering and he was very sore about it.</p>
<p>" 'You take me from my guests, Mr. Fanshawe. What you dare do? You take me
from the best society in this town. Six judges dine with me to-night, and you
drag me away from them.'</p>
<p>" 'Got those judges, Phil?' asked Fanshawe.</p>
<p>" 'Yes, Chief.'</p>
<p>" 'Let them go in with the others. All right, Genaro, we won't talk about
it. We've got you down for near fifty murders. You didn't do them with your own
hands. You had your choppers and your gunmen. But they were yours all the same.
Have you the gang?'</p>
<p>" 'Sixty of them.'</p>
<p>" 'That's enough to go on with. Off with them to the Odeum.'</p>
<p>"All night they were being led in, gangsters of every kind, thugs, gunmen,
booze-hustlers, hi-jackers, racketeers, con-men, scratchers, common yeggmen,
and hold-uppers&mdash;crooks of every size and shape. Fanshawe had them all
tabbed, ran his finger down the list, had the man's record in a moment, and
dealt with him in a word or two. Often he had a consultation with his friends,
and once or twice he looked across for a nod from me or some other who was in
the inside of things. Here or there a man was set free with a few stern words
of warning. Far the greater part were sent on to the Odeum. At last, just as
dawn was breaking, Fanshawe rose, stretched himself, threw down his half-smoked
cigar&mdash;he had smoked a chain of them through the whole night&mdash;and
came down from the dais. The other followed, and so did I.</p>
<p>"There were crowds in the street, but the cops and the G.T.S. men had made
an avenue, and Fanshawe, with his committee, drove down to the Odeum, which was
only three or four blocks away. For my own part, I made my way on foot through
the crowd, and reached the place after they had entered. There was a guard at
the door, but MacDonovan, who was a pal of mine up at police head- quarters,
caught me by the shoulder as I tried to squeeze in.</p>
<p>" 'Not in your life, kid,' said he. 'These guys know you for what you are,
and if you get among them I guess there wouldn't be enough of you left to be
worth a funeral.'</p>
<p>" 'Can't I get a look in anywhere, Mac?'</p>
<p>"There was a little metal-faced door just inside, and he opened it.</p>
<p>" 'Get up this stair,' said he. 'You are taking a chance from the
President's guards, but if you get up there you will see all there is.'</p>
<p>"So up I went, only to find a gat flushed into my face from a sentry at the
top. I got friendly, however, and he let me stop where I could get a view.</p>
<p>"The Odeum is a big square dancing hall with no furniture. It just has a
gallery at one end where the band would play&mdash;and that is where I was.
There was the one stair leading to the gallery, with the guarded and locked
door at the bottom. There were two or three other guarded doors faced with
metal down below, and the windows, which were high, were all boarded up. Down
in the body of the hall were about twelve hundred people, some in dress, most
in any sort of rough clothes, but all of them just dancing with rage. They were
shaking their fists up at the gallery and yelling out every kind of abuse and
threat of what they were going to do with the G.T.S. folk when they got
loose.</p>
<p>"Dancing mad&mdash;that was how they were&mdash;and as you looked down under
the bright top lights you could just see open yelling mouths, and twisted
faces, and fists held up shaking at the President. I'll hand it to him for
being cool. There he sat with a few of his committee looking down in silence on
the mob, as quiet as a fish in ice. On each side of him was a big brass tripod,
and a velvet cloth over each such as photographers use. Half-a- dozen G.T.S.
were at the back, and if ever I saw hard-bitten soldiers it was there.</p>
<p>"Presently Fanshawe rose and held up his hand for silence. There were some
yells of hatred, but as the man stood and looked down at them with a face like
death and eyes like icicles, these died away, and there was such utter
stillness that there might have been no one in the room. Then he began to speak
with a voice that crackled like electricity.</p>
<p>" 'There are a few Amurrcans in this room, more shame to them,' said he.
'They have been corrupted and led away, and yet they were the very ones chosen
by the people and trusted to look after their affaires. I am sorry for them,
but they have only themselves to thank. As to the rest of you, you are nearly
all from foreign lands, whence you were driven by want or tyranny. You came
here and Amurrca welcomed you. She could not have been more generous. Within a
year she put you on an equality with the oldest citizen. She gave you all her
broad lands that you might find a place for yourselves and use every gift that
was in you. That is what Amurrca has done for you. And what have you done for
Amurrca? You have broken her laws, made the name of her cities a scandal,
corrupted her citizens with your ill-got money, broken down her legal system,
killed her guardians of the peace when you could not corrupt them. In a word,
you have done such things that at long last we, who are the real people, have
had to come forth and show you that there is a live Amurrca which has been good
and liberal and generous, but which has in it also the power which can punish
those who abuse what has been given. You have forced it on us. You have left us
no other way but this. Enough said! Cut loose!'</p>
<p>"As he spoke a man on either side pulled the cloth off the machine-guns. The
hard-bitten citizens behind sprang to their positions, and in an instant the
massacre began.</p>
<p>"I only had a glance at it. I saw them rushing for the doors. I saw them
climbing to the sealed windows. I saw them piling up in the corners as rats do
when a terrier is loose. I saw them running and screaming, and tripping and
falling, and some hiding behind the others, and the dead piling up, and the
judges all going down in one heap, and the mayor running forward with his hands
up. All this I seemed to see, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, what then?"</p>
<p>"Well, as I said at the beginning, the rattle of that skirt's slop-pail
carried on the tapping of the guns, and then she was bobbing and scarping, and
saying that she thought I had been up and out."</p>
<p>We sat in disgruntled silence.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say," I cried, at last, "that this has all been a
dream?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can call it that if you like," he answered, taking the sodden
cigar from his mouth. "A vision, maybe, is a better word. It hasn't happened
just like that yet. But wait a bit, folk, wait a bit."</p>
<p>Poor old Kid! We felt that the end of his story had been a bit of a flop.
But his own end was dramatic enough. Only a few days later we saw the curt
paragraph in a morning paper:&mdash;</p>
<p>"An American named Wilson was found by the police early yesterday morning in
the portico of a common lodging-house in Carlisle Street, Soho, suffering from
several knife wounds. His assailants had apparently waited for him in the
shadow of the door, and attacked him as he returned, according to his wont, in
the early morning. He was alive when found, but refused to make any statement,
and died on his way to the hospital. There is no clue at present to the
assassins, but there are reasons to believe that the tragedy is part of that
gangster system which has wrought such havoc in America."</p>
