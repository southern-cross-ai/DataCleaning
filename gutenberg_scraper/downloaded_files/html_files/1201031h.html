  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1"></a>I. &mdash; IN WHICH THE "MAID OF<br>
  ORLEANS" LEAVES FOR BOULOGNE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE <i>Maid of Orleans</i> drew slowly away from the side.
  Leaning over the rail was the usual row of cross-Channel passengers calling
  out final good-byes to their friends on the quay. An odd Customs man or two
  drifted back to their respective offices: the R.A.C. representative raised
  protesting hands to High Heaven because one of his charges had departed
  without his triptyque. In fact, the usual scene on the departure of the
  Boulogne boat, and mentioned only because you must start a story somewhere,
  and Folkestone harbour is as good a locality as any.</p>

  <p>Standing side by side on the quay were two men, who had been waving their
  hands in that shame-faced manner which immediately descends on the male sex
  when it indulges in that fatuous pursuit. The targets of their innocent
  pastime were two women, whose handkerchiefs had fluttered in response from
  the upper deck. And since these two charming ladies do not come into the
  matter again it might be as well to dispose of them forthwith. They were, in
  short, the wives of the two men, departing on their lawful occasions to Le
  Touquet, there to play a little golf and lose some money in the Casino. Which
  is really all that needs to be said about them, except possibly their last
  remark chanted in unison as the ship began to move:</p>

  <p>"Now mind you're both good while we're away."</p>

  <p>"Of course," answered the two men, also in unison.</p>

  <p>And here and now let us be quite clear about this matter. Before ordering
  a dinner the average man consults the menu. If his mouth is set for underdone
  beef with horse-radish sauce it is as gall and wormwood to him to be given
  mutton and red-currant jelly. Similarly, before reading a book the average
  reader likes to have a pointer as to what it is about. Does it concern the
  Sheik of Fiction carrying off a beautiful white woman on his thoroughbred
  Arab; or does it concern the Sheik of Reality riding a donkey and picking
  fleas out of his burnous? Does it concern a Bolshevist plot to blow up the
  policeman on point duty at Dover Street; or does it concern the meditations
  of an evangelical Bishop on the revised Prayer-Book? And honesty compels me
  to state that it concerns none of these things, which is just as well for all
  concerned.</p>

  <p>But it occurred to me that the parting admonition of those two charming
  ladies might possibly be construed to mean that they feared their husbands
  would not be good during their absence. Far from it: such a thought never
  even entered their heads. It was just a confirmatory statement of a fact as
  certain as the presence of Nelson in Trafalgar Square.</p>

  <p>"Dear lambs," they remarked to one another as the boat cleared the
  harbour, "it will do them good to have a few days' golf all by
  themselves."</p>

  <p>However, I still haven't given this pointer. And with it the last hopes of
  those who insist on a love story will be dashed to the ground. They must have
  received a pretty severe jolt when this matter of husband and wife was
  alluded to, though a few of the more optimistic ones may have had visions of
  a divorce looming somewhere, or even a bit of slap and tickle. Sorry: nothing
  doing. So if this is the mutton of my restaurant analogy you know what to do.
  But don't forget this book weighs as much as "Pansy, or the Girl who Lost All
  for Love," and will do just as much damage to the aspidistra if you hit it.
  Another thing, too, which it does not concern is golf. On that fact, I must
  admit with shame and sorrow that these two miserable men had deceived their
  trusting wives. The larger and more nefarious of the two had actually
  addressed his partner in crime at breakfast that morning on the subjects of
  handicaps and niblicks and things, and what they were going to do during
  their few days at Rye. His eye had not twitched: his hand when he helped
  himself to marmalade had been steady. And yet he lied&mdash;the dirty
  dog&mdash;he lied.</p>

  <p>And his companion in vice knew he had lied, though, to his everlasting
  shame, he said no word. Both of these scoundrels allowed their wives to leave
  them for a perilous sea voyage with a falsehood ringing in their ears. Which
  shows you the type of men you're dealing with. However&mdash;that's that:
  I'll get on with it. Still not given the pointer? Oh! read the darned book
  and find out for yourself.</p>

  <p>I will take the larger one first. His height was a shade over six feet in
  his socks: his breadth and depth were in proportion. Which, in boxing
  parlance, entitles him to be placed among the big men. And big he was in
  every sense of the word. His face was nothing to write home about, and even
  his wife admitted that she only used it to amuse the baby. Anyway, looks
  don't matter in a man. What does matter is his condition, and, reverting once
  more to boxing parlance, this man looked what he was&mdash;trained to the
  last ounce.</p>

  <p>It has always been a bit of a marvel to me how Hugh Drummond kept as fit
  as he did, in view of his incredible capacity for lowering ale. Nevertheless,
  the bald fact remains that in the matter of fitness he had all of us beat to
  a frazzle. I particularly wish to emphasise that fact, because I believe that
  this is the first occasion that one of his really intimate friends has
  written about him. Take, for instance, the extraordinary adventure with that
  crazy woman, Irma, on Salisbury Plain. Joe Dixon wrote that, and Joe, good
  fellow though he is, hardly knew Hugh at all. But fourteen years have gone by
  since I first met him, in the front line near Arras, and in fourteen years
  one gets to know a man. From which it will be inferred that I was the other
  of the two nefarious scoundrels who had stood waving to their trusting wives
  from the quay.</p>

  <p>Now, as will perhaps be remembered by those who have followed some of our
  adventures in the past, we got mixed up with a bunch of criminals shortly
  after the war. Their leader was a man named Carl Peterson, who was killed by
  Drummond in Wilmot's giant airship just before it crashed in flames. And that
  led up to the amazing happenings on Salisbury Plain that I have already
  alluded to, when Peterson's mistress kidnapped Drummond's wife and nearly got
  the lot of us. But she escaped, and the first thought that had sprung to my
  mind on getting Hugh's letter was that she had reappeared again. Up till now
  I had had no chance of speaking to him privately, but as the boat disappeared
  round the end of the jetty, I turned to him eagerly:</p>

  <p>"What's the game, Hugh? Is it Irma on the scene again?"</p>

  <p>He held up a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peter," he remarked, "have you noticed that the sun is in the
  position technically known as over the yardarm?"</p>

  <p>"And as the Governor of North Carolina said to his pal, let's get to it,"
  I answered. "What about the Pavilion Hotel?"</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderful thing being married, Peter," he said thoughtfully as we
  strolled along the platform.</p>

  <p>"Marvellous," I agreed, and glanced at him sideways: there was a certain
  note in his voice that confirmed my suspicions.</p>

  <p>"And," he continued, "it is good for all of us to sacrifice something in
  Lent."</p>

  <p>"It is June," I answered, "but the principle holds good."</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said, as we fell into two easy chairs in the lounge, "your
  brain has probably jumped to the fact that it was not entirely due to a
  desire to beat your head off on Rye golf links that I engineered this little
  affair at Le Touquet. Waiter&mdash;two large tankards of ale."</p>

  <p>"Some such idea had dawned on me," I agreed. "It seemed so remarkably
  sudden."</p>

  <p>"My dear old lad," he said with a grin, "you can't imagine the diplomacy I
  had to use. I first of all suggested that we all four should go to Le Touquet
  &mdash;a proposal which was jumped at by my devoted spouse. I then wrote you
  that masterpiece of duplicity."</p>

  <p>"Masterpiece it may have been," I laughed, "but it gave me brain fever
  trying to think of an excuse that would hold water."</p>

  <p>"What did you cough up finally?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I wrote to my lawyer," I said, "and told him to write to me and say he'd
  got some urgent business on my dear old grandmother's will. Sounded a bit
  thin to me, I confess, but, by the mercy of Allah, it went down. And Molly
  was deuced keen to go."</p>

  <p>"So, bless her, was Phyllis," answered Hugh. "Thin or not, Peter, it
  worked. For a few days we are going to be bachelors. And much may happen in a
  few days."</p>

  <p>"As you say," I agreed, "much may happen in a few days. At the same time,
  you haven't answered my first question. Is it Irma?"</p>

  <p>"It is not, bless her. Maybe another time, for I should hate to lose her.
  But this time it's something quite, quite new."</p>

  <p>He drained his tankard and pressed the bell.</p>

  <p>"We will have the other half section, while I put you wise. Mark you,
  Peter, it may be the most hopeless mare's nest, and if it is we can always
  play golf. But somehow or other I don't think it is. In fact, in my own mind,
  I'm quite certain it isn't. You don't know this part of the world at all, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, the first thing to do is to give you a rough idea of the lie of the
  land. Once we leave Hythe we come to a large stretch of absolutely flat
  country which is known as Romney Marsh. The word 'marsh' is a misnomer, as
  the soil itself is quite hard and gives very good grazing. There are a few
  small villages dotted about, and an odd farmhouse or two, but the prevailing
  note is solitude. Motor charabancs cross it daily from Hastings and
  Folkestone, and the roads are good but a bit narrow. But it is a solitary
  sort of place for all that; you feel that anything might happen on it.</p>

  <p>"A few centuries ago it was covered by the sea, which came right up to the
  foothills, so that all of Romney Marsh is reclaimed land. And from those
  hills you get the most marvellous view away towards Dungeness and
  Lydd&mdash;if you like that type of view, that's to say. Open, free, with the
  tang of the sea in the wind. I love it; which was one of the deciding factors
  that led me to take our present house. It has a clear sweep for miles right
  out to sea, and I've installed a powerful telescope on the terrace&mdash;a
  telescope, Peter, which has been and is going to be of assistance. However,
  to return to our muttons. As I've told you, the Marsh itself is sparsely
  populated. The only considerable towns are Rye and Winchelsea&mdash;which can
  hardly be said to be on Romney Marsh at all. Rye is set on a sort of conical
  hill, and must in the olden days have been almost completely surrounded by
  water. But except for them, and Lydd, where the artillery range is, and New
  Romney, there's not much in the house line, and those that are there belong
  principally to small farmers.</p>

  <p>"About a week ago&mdash;to be exact, the day before I wrote to you&mdash;I
  was undressing to go to bed. It was fairly early&mdash;not more than eleven
  or a quarter past&mdash;and after I had got into pyjamas I sat by the open
  window having a final cigarette. My dressing-room faces over the Marsh, and I
  could see the lights of a passing steamer going West. Suddenly, from the very
  middle of the Marsh itself, there came a red flash lasting about a second;
  then a pause, and a moment afterwards it was blue. They were repeated half a
  dozen times&mdash;red, blue, red, blue&mdash;then they ceased altogether.</p>

  <p>"For a while I sat there staring out, wondering what on earth they could
  mean. By putting a couple of matches on my dressing-table I got the rough
  alignment so that I could get the direction in the morning&mdash;but I was
  sorely tempted to go out and investigate then and there. However, I decided
  not to; Phyllis was in bed, and I was undressed. And if the truth be told,
  Peter, even at that early hour the possibility of a little fun had struck me,
  and I didn't want to run the risk of cramping our style. So I didn't mention
  anything about it to the dear soul. That it was a signal of some sort seemed
  fairly obvious, but for what and to whom? The first thought that flitted
  across my mind was that smugglers were at work. For if rumour speaks the
  truth there is the devil of a lot of smuggling going on since these new silk
  duties were put on. There are stories told of fast motor-boats, and
  mysterious motor-cars that go careering about in the middle of the night.
  However, when I began to think things over a bit, I dismissed the smuggling
  theory. To put it mildly, it seemed unlikely that men engaged in such an
  extremely secret and risky business would take the trouble to advertise
  themselves by flashing red and blue lights all over the place. Besides, one
  would have expected the signal&mdash;if such it was&mdash;to be given towards
  the sea, and this was given towards the land. So I washed out smugglers.</p>

  <p>The next solution that presented itself was that it wasn't a genuine
  signal at all, but the work of some boy with a developed film sense. A joke
  inspired by 'Dandy Dick&mdash;the Cowboy's Terror,' or something of that
  sort. And leaving it at that, I fell asleep.</p>

  <p>"The next morning I was up early. A mist was lying over the Marsh which
  lifted after a while, and I took a squint over my two matches. They, of
  course, gave me the right direction, but not elevation. That I had to guess.
  As I've told you, there are very few houses about, and there was only one
  through which the line of my matches passed. Moreover, as far as I could
  judge, though things look very different by day to what they do at night,
  that house gave me approximately the right elevation. So I went downstairs
  and focussed my telescope on it.</p>

  <p>"It was, as I expected, an ordinary farm-house. There seemed to be a
  couple of out-houses and four or five biggish trees. Moreover, the whole
  property stood isolated by itself, like a little island rising out of a lake.
  As far as I could judge, it stood about a quarter of a mile from the main
  road between Rye and New Romney, and was connected to it by a rough track. I
  could see no sign of life, until the front door opened and a woman with a
  pail in her hand came out and went into one of the outhouses. In every
  respect a peaceful country scene.</p>

  <p>"However, I waylaid the postman that morning and got some more information
  from him. It appeared that the place was known as Spragge's Farm. It belonged
  to a man of that name, and had belonged to his father and grandfather before
  him. The present man lived there with his wife, and, I gathered, was not a
  popular individual. He was surly and morose, and had the reputation of being
  a miser. Apparently he was quite well off, but he refused to keep a servant,
  making his wife do all the menial work. He had a ferocious temper, and on two
  or three occasions had been run in before the local Bench for actual physical
  violence to one of his farm hands, the result being that now he could get no
  one to work for him. Following up my second theory I asked if he had any
  children, and was told that he hadn't. But, I gathered, he occasionally took
  in a lodger who wanted quiet and rest. I further gathered that the usual
  duration of the said lodger's stay was not extensive, as he got neither rest
  nor quiet for his money. I asked if he had one now, but that the postman
  couldn't tell me. He hadn't heard of one, but then, Spragge's Farm wasn't on
  his beat. So having found out mighty little, I thanked him and he went off.
  And then, after he'd gone a few yards he turned round and came back. It
  appeared that he had suddenly remembered that the cards which Spragge had put
  in one or two of the shops in Rye, advertising that he took in boarders, had
  been removed recently, the assumption being that possibly he had given up
  that side line. And that comprised all the information I got.</p>

  <p>"Off and on through the morning I had a look at the place, but nothing of
  the slightest interest did I see. Once a man came out who I assumed was
  Spragge himself, and I saw the woman two or three times, but except for that
  there was no sign of life about the farm. And after a while I began to wonder
  if the whole thing wasn't capable of some perfectly ordinary explanation; or
  possibly that the farm itself was not the origin of the lights.</p>

  <p>"And then, Peter, there occurred the thing which caused my letter to you
  and the departure of our womenkind to-day."</p>

  <p>Hugh lit a cigarette, and I followed suit. Up to date it struck me that
  the doings had been hardly such as to awake feverish excitement in the
  breasts of the troops, but I knew my man. Domesticity might have dulled him a
  little, but he could still spot the genuine article like a terrier spots a
  rat.</p>

  <p>"We will now leave the Marsh," he continued, "and come to the higher
  ground where my house is. I've got no one near me&mdash;my next neighbour
  being about half a mile away. He, too, commands a view right out to sea, but
  there all similarity ends between us, I trust. His name is Granger, and he's
  a gentleman I've got remarkably little use for. In appearance, he is small
  and measly-looking: you see smaller editions in a bit of ripe Stilton. As far
  as I know he lives alone, save for two servants&mdash;one a great bullock of
  a man who looks like a prize-fighter, the other an elderly female who cooks.
  I got those details from my own staff, because I've never been inside his
  house myself. In fact, the only time I've met the blighter is occasionally
  out walking, when he is invariably accompanied by this professional pug. And
  it was on one such occasion that he stopped and spoke to me.</p>

  <p>"'Captain Drummond, I believe,' he said.</p>

  <p>"I admitted the soft impeachment, and wondered what was coming.</p>

  <p>"'You and your wife must forgive my not calling on you,' he went on
  jerkily. 'I am a recluse, Captain Drummond, and my health is not of the
  best.'</p>

  <p>"He rambled on, and when he'd finished I assured him that it did not
  matter in the least, and that we quite understood. I didn't add that the only
  thing we wouldn't forgive him for was if he did call, and we parted, leaving
  me with two very distinct impressions.</p>

  <p>"The first was that, in spite of his name, the man was not pure English.
  There was a distinct trace of an accent in his voice, though I couldn't
  decide what. The second was that he was afraid of something. The whole time
  he was talking to me his eyes had been darting this way and that, as if he
  was perpetually on the lookout for some unexpected danger. Of course, it
  might have been only a mannerism, but that was the impression he gave me, and
  subsequent gossip confirmed my idea. The man was frightened, though whether
  of a specific individual or of people at large I didn't know.</p>

  <p>"It appeared he had taken the house very soon after the war, and had
  immediately proceeded to fortify the place like a prison. There was already a
  high wall all round the house, and his first act was to have the top of it
  covered with a double row of long crossed steel spikes. His next performance
  was to have the existing open gates for the drive replaced by two heavy
  wooden ones whose tops were also covered with the same contraption of spikes.
  These were kept permanently locked, and the only way of getting in was
  through a small wicket let into one of them. But this was also kept locked,
  and before it could be opened a tremendous ceremony had to be gone through.
  My informant on all this once again was the postman. When the time came for
  the various errand boys to bring the provisions for the day, the
  prize-fighter took up his position by the wicket gate. When the bell rang he
  opened it and took the meat, or whatever it was, from the boy. Then
  everything was shut up again as before. The same with the postman, too. On
  the rare occasions when Mr. Granger got a letter he handed it to the
  bodyguard through the gate; he was never allowed to go up to the front
  door.</p>

  <p>"But that wasn't all; I've only mentioned the outer line of defences up to
  date. The inner was just as thorough. Every window in the house was protected
  on the outside by iron bars, exactly like a prison cell. Even the attics had
  them; not only the ground floor rooms. That work was done by a local man, so
  the countryside got full information&mdash;but a London firm was employed for
  other things, of which only vague rumours got round. Burglar alarms of the
  most modern type were installed, and trip wires in the grounds which rang
  gongs, and the Lord knows what else.</p>

  <p>"However, there is no good elaborating the details. I've told you enough
  already to show you that my neighbour not only resented intrusion, but was
  determined to stop it. Naturally, in a country place like this the
  inhabitants buzzed like a hive of bees with curiosity, though when I took my
  place three years after, the excitement had died down. They had become used
  to him, and the generally accepted theory was that he was an eccentric who
  lived in terror of burglars. Colour was added to that idea by the doctor who,
  on one occasion, was called in to see him. It appeared that everything short
  of blindfolding the medico was done to prevent him seeing anything. He was
  rushed from the wicket gate to the front door, through the hall and up to the
  bedroom. And when he got there the prize-fighter remained in the room. Mark
  you, Peter, the doctor man told me this himself.</p>

  <p>"He waited for the servant to go, and when he showed every intention of
  staying, he stuck in his toes. He told Granger, who was in bed, that he was
  not in the habit of having a third person in the room when he was examining a
  patient unless that person was a qualified nurse. Granger answered very
  querulously that the man was his confidential valet and that he wished him to
  stay. The doctor replied to the effect that he didn't care a damn what he
  was, but that if he didn't clear out of the room Mr. Granger would have to
  obtain another doctor. Well, the long and the short of it was, that, after a
  while, and very reluctantly, the servant left the room, and the doctor got on
  with his job. As he said to me, he didn't really mind in the slightest if the
  man remained or if he didn't, but he was determined to see what would happen
  if he insisted.</p>

  <p>"After he had made his examination, and prescribed something or other, he
  glanced round the room.</p>

  <p>"'Lovely things you've got here, Mr. Granger,' he remarked casually.</p>

  <p>"The invalid struck a little bell beside the bed, and the servant entered
  so quickly that he must have been just outside the door.</p>

  <p>"'Show the doctor out,' said the sick man irritably. 'And I'll let you
  know. Doctor Sinclair, if I want you again.'</p>

  <p>"Now the doctor, though one of the best, has the devil of a temper. And he
  let drive at that.</p>

  <p>"'Your case is not one that I care to continue treating,' he said coldly.
  'It is not your bodily health that requires attention, but your manners. My
  fee is half a guinea.'</p>

  <p>"For a moment or two, so he told me, he thought the prize-fighter was
  going to strike him, but Granger pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"'Forgive me, doctor,' he said. 'I'm not feeling my best to-day. Yes,
  there are some lovely things in this room, and, in fact, all over the house.
  That is why I have taken these somewhat elaborate precautions against
  unauthorised people gaining an entrance. A burglar's paradise, my dear sir; a
  burglar's paradise. I trust you will forgive my momentary irritability, and
  continue as my medical attendant.'</p>

  <p>"By that time Sinclair's anger had evaporated, and he said no more. And
  when he did go back next day the valet made no attempt to remain in the room.
  Even the precautions of the first day were relaxed a little, and he didn't
  have the impression that he was being marched along under an armed guard. But
  no time was wasted lingering about the house, and no further mention was made
  of what was in it.</p>

  <p>"This yarn of the doctor's, as I say, was taken by most people to confirm
  the theory that Granger was frightened of burglars. And one has certainly
  heard of cases where miserly eccentrics have lived for years surrounded by
  their treasures, and protected by every sort of mechanical device. But though
  I said nothing about it at the time the solution didn't quite satisfy me.
  Even the most suspicious recluse would hardly suspect a respectable medical
  man of any desire to steal the spoons. So, why these elaborate precautions on
  the occasion of his visit? Was it eccentricity on Granger's part which was
  almost akin to insanity: the result of a fear so great that he suspected any
  and everyone without exception?</p>

  <p>"Or was it something deeper than that; and if so, what?</p>

  <p>"Well, I set to work to puzzle it out. The first idea that occurred to me
  was that he was afraid for his life. That, again, was open to the same
  objection. You don't expect a doctor to pinch your spoons, but even less do
  you anticipate that he will murder you. So I dismissed that theory, and tried
  another. Was there something to conceal in the house which he didn't wish the
  doctor to see? Remember, the doctor is the only human being, as far as I
  know, who has ever been in the house from the outside world. I worked along
  that line for a bit, saying nothing to anybody, and the more I thought of it
  the more did I become convinced that I was on the right track. Of course, it
  was possible that he was afraid that the doctor might spot some of the inner
  secrets of his defences, but again the same darned old objection. If he did
  he was hardly likely to run round revealing his discovery to bands of
  burglars. So what was the mystery? If I was right, what was hidden inside?
  Was it a human being? Possibly, but the idea presented difficulties.
  Remember, Granger has been there for six years, and, in spite of all his
  safeguards, it would have been difficult to keep a fourth person in the house
  for all that time without someone spotting it. And if it wasn't a human being
  it must be some object. But surely it would have been perfectly simple to
  hide it away so that the doctor couldn't see it during his quick walk through
  the house. So there I was up against a blank wall once more. And after a
  while I gave up worrying over the blamed thing; it wasn't worth it. Perhaps
  someday the mystery, if any, would come out, and in the meantime I,
  outwardly, at any rate, subscribed to the theory that Mr. Granger was an
  eccentric old man who did not want to be disturbed, and had taken damned good
  care that he shouldn't be. Sorry for all this hot air, Peter, but I had to
  make it clear to you. We will now get on a bit quicker. The morning after I
  had seen the lights on the Marsh I went out for a stroll to the village. And
  that meant I had to go past Granger's house. Now don't forget that all my
  cogitations on his menage had taken place months ago: I had long given up
  worrying my head about it. So that what happened cannot be fancy or
  imagination due to my suspicions. About a quarter of a mile before I got to
  his gates who should I see coming along the road but the man himself and his
  tame bruiser. Now on the rare occasions when I had met him we had always
  stopped and had a few words&mdash;generally platitudes about the weather. And
  as usual I halted as I came abreast of him and passed the time of day. He was
  a bit more affable than usual for some reason: in fact, he even managed to
  crack a smile over something that I said. And then, for some unknown reason,
  I mentioned the lights I'd seen on the Marsh. It was just a sudden impulse
  said without thought.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Peter, I thought the man had gone mad. He stared at me with
  dilated eyes, and his lower jaw was shaking like a man with ague. And the pug
  wasn't much better.</p>

  <p>"'Red and blue lights,' he stammered foolishly. 'Red and blue lights.'</p>

  <p>"He was croaking in his agitation, and clutching the valet's arm with two
  trembling hands.</p>

  <p>"'Where did you see them, Captain Drummond&mdash;these lights?'</p>

  <p>"But by that time I'd taken a pull at myself: evidently there was a
  mystery in the offing, and I wasn't going to be too specific.</p>

  <p>"'Somewhere on Romney Marsh,' I said vaguely. 'Why? What's all the
  excitement about?'</p>

  <p>"'Red and blue,' he almost screamed to the valet. 'Santa Maria!
  Gaspard&mdash;it is he.'</p>

  <p>"'Shut up,' growled the pug, though his own forehead was wet with
  sweat.</p>

  <p>"But the other was beyond hope: he was in a state of gibbering terror.</p>

  <p>"'Back to the house,' he kept on muttering. 'Hurry&mdash;for the love of
  the Virgin.'</p>

  <p>"And away the pair of them went down the road with Granger clawing at the
  valet, and the valet glancing this way and that over his shoulder, as if he
  expected someone to materialise out of the hedge. For a while I stood staring
  after them foolishly: the whole thing was so totally unexpected. Then I
  followed them at a discreet distance, feeling a strong desire to laugh. They
  looked so damned ridiculous. Granger, as I think I've mentioned, is a little
  man, and to see him hopping along beside that vast bullock of a valet who
  every now and then broke into a shambling run had its humorous aspect. They
  reached their front gate, and while the pug was fumbling with his key to open
  the wicket Granger kept dancing about in his agitation. Then they
  disappeared, and I heard an iron bar clang home. The fortress had been
  reached in safety."</p>

  <p>Hugh paused and looked at me with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Getting a bit nearer the meat juice, ain't we, Peter? Why should the fact
  that a red and blue light had been flashed on Romney Marsh inspire terror in
  the breasts of our Mr. Granger and his pugilistic companion? And no mild form
  of terror either. For if I'm a judge that man was sick with fear for his
  life."</p>

  <p>"It would seem," I murmured mildly, "that the problem is one which can
  hardly be solved on paper. And since our wives are at Le Touquet, it might
  help to pass the agonising time till they rejoin us, if we--"</p>

  <p>"Good lad," he laughed. "I knew you would."</p>

  <p>"But, look here, Hugh," I said, "has nothing more happened? Have you seen
  the lights again?"</p>

  <p>"Only once&mdash;three nights ago."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't been down to this place&mdash;Spragge's Farm?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I thought I'd wait for you, Peter. It seemed a crime
  to keep a thing like this to oneself."</p>

  <p>"Just one small point, old man," I put in.</p>

  <p>"What about the police? If your surmise is right: if this man Granger is
  in fear of his life why hasn't he told the police about it? Or has he?
  Because if so "</p>

  <p>"He hasn't, Peter," he interrupted. " That I know. The local inspector is
  a great pal of mine. And since that very objection occurred to me, I made a
  point of meeting him. I brought the conversation round to Granger&mdash;never
  a difficult thing to do. And I'm convinced that if he had asked for police
  protection I should have heard of it. Therefore he hasn't. Why not? Because,
  laddie, he dare not. That's my answer to it. It's what I have thought all
  along. There is something that man has got to conceal, and he dare not run
  the risk of bringing the police in."</p>

  <p>"It sounds feasible," I agreed. "Anyway what's the next move?"</p>

  <p>"A couple of short ones. Then lunch. And after that we'll lay out a plan
  of campaign."</p>

  <p>He led the way and I followed: thus it had always been in the past.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2"></a>II. &mdash; IN WHICH WE MEET TWO NEW ALLIES</h2>

  <p class="first">I DON'T pretend for a moment, of course, that there was the
  slightest excuse to be offered for us. Manifestly the matter was no business
  of ours. If Mr. Granger chose to barricade his house with iron spikes it was
  his affair, and no one else's. Still I regret to say that there are people in
  this world who are as irresistibly drawn to a thick-ear atmosphere as a cat
  is to a saucer of milk. And Hugh Drummond was one of them, having been born
  that way.</p>

  <p>In that way he differed from me: I only acquired the liking by force of
  his example. And I am bound to admit that had I been the one to see a red and
  blue light flashing on Romney Marsh, and realised that such a harmless, even
  peculiar phenomenon produced terror in the breast of my next-door neighbour,
  I should not have proceeded farther with the matter.</p>

  <p>Wherefore the difference of our mental attitudes during lunch is easily
  understandable. Mine was principally concerned with our official position in
  the matter: his was entirely occupied with whether the thing was likely to
  produce some sport.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peter," he said, as the waiter brought the coffee, "we haven't
  got any official position in the matter. So that's that, and there's no use
  worrying about it. But it is manifestly the duty of every law-abiding citizen
  to investigate such a strange pastime as flashing coloured lights on the
  Marsh. Maybe it is some new method of catching moths: maybe not. Anyway we're
  darned well going to see."</p>

  <p>"And the first move?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Is to call at Spragge's Farm," he answered.</p>

  <p>We are not to know that his notice about rooms to let has been withdrawn.
  We will therefore, on the way back, present ourselves at the door, and you
  will ask if he can put you up. Say that you're suffering from nervous
  breakdown due to backing three winners in succession, and demand to see what
  accommodation he has to offer. Then say you'll let him know. We'll both keep
  our eyes skinned and perhaps we'll see something."</p>

  <p>"Right ho!" I said resignedly. "As long as I'm not expected to stop at the
  bally place, I'll put up the palaver."</p>

  <p>We paid the bill, and left the dining-room. Hugh's car was outside the
  hotel, a Bentley Sports model: and ten minutes later we had dropped down the
  hill to Sandgate and were running along by the sea towards Hythe.</p>

  <p>"From now on, Peter," he said, "until we get actually to Rye itself the
  ground is dead flat. When we get out a bit further you'll see the range of
  hills away to the right where my house stands."</p>

  <p>It was a hot, lazy afternoon, and the heat haze shimmered over the country
  which stretched dry and parched on each side of the road. Even the usual
  breeze which one gets in the locality had died away, and the few cattle we
  saw were standing listlessly in what shade they could find. The disused red
  water cistern on Littlestone golf links dropped away behind us, and the
  Martello Towers ceased as we turned away from the sea after New Romney.</p>

  <p>"Dungeness away there to the left," said Hugh briefly. "And Lydd. Now
  we're on the Marsh proper."</p>

  <p>The road was good but narrow, with a deep ditch on each side, and he
  pointed out the spot to me where a motor charabanc had skidded and overturned
  one night, pinning the occupants underneath it till they were drowned in six
  inches of water.</p>

  <p>"These grass sides to the road get slippery at times," he explained. "And
  then you want to watch it."</p>

  <p>At length he stopped the car and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Now, Peter," he said, "we approach our destination. That place there in
  front of us is Rye. Cast your eyes two fingers right and you will see on the
  hill an imposing red brick edifice. That is the house of Drummond. Straight
  in front of us you will see a smallish house in a clump of trees: that is
  Spragge's Farm. One finger to the right of my house, also on the hill, you
  perceive another house. That is our friend Granger's prison. Now you get the
  geography of the part that concerns us. And the great point, as you will
  notice, is that if, as I am tolerably certain, those lights were a warning of
  some sort, Spragge's Farm is as good a place as any on the Marsh for Granger
  to see them from."</p>

  <p>"Correct," I agreed. "Now what am I really to say to Spragge?"</p>

  <p>"Any darned thing you like," he laughed as we started once more. " It's
  only a preliminary reconnaissance, and we can't expect much luck."</p>

  <p>It was fortunate we didn't, because we had none at all. The farm stood
  about a quarter of a mile from the road, and a rough drive&mdash;little more
  than a stony lane&mdash;led up to it. A gate barred the entrance, and leaning
  over it was a morose looking individual smoking a pipe. He stared at us with
  scarcely veiled hostility as we pulled up, and made no effort to move.</p>

  <p>"This is Spragge's Farm, isn't it?" said Hugh politely.</p>

  <p>"It is," grunted the man without removing his pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Do you know if Mr. Spragge is anywhere about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. Spragge. What might you be wanting?"</p>

  <p>Hugh's fingers began to drum on the steering wheel, and it wasn't
  difficult to tell exactly what he was wanting. But to clip a man over the jaw
  is not conducive to further conversation, and his voice remained studiously
  mild.</p>

  <p>"I was told, Mr. Spragge," he said quietly, "that you had a room to let at
  your farm. My friend here is anxious for a place where he can
  finish&mdash;er&mdash;a book undisturbed. If your room is free he would like
  to see it."</p>

  <p>The man removed his pipe, only apparently to enable him to spit with
  greater ease. Then he stared insolently from one to the other of us.</p>

  <p>"You were told wrong," he grunted. "I've no room to let, and if I had I
  choose who I put--"</p>

  <p>"Your choice must be fairly limited I should imagine," remarked Hugh, "if
  this is a fair sample of your manners. Nice chatty little fellow, aren't you,
  Mr. Spragge?"</p>

  <p>The man straightened himself up, and the veins on his forehead began to
  stand out like whipcord.</p>

  <p>"Look here, you damned dude," he said thickly, "you get out of this before
  I lose my temper. I speaks how I like, and to whom I like. But unless you're
  out of this pretty quick, I'll pull you out of your car and little Pansy-face
  beside you as well."</p>

  <p>Hugh laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"And why should I get out of this, Mr. Spragge? This road is as much mine
  as yours, and you've no idea what a pretty picture you make leaning against
  that gate. True, your face leaves much to be desired, and your clothes are
  deplorable, but the general picture&mdash;the <i>tout ensemble</i>&mdash;of
  the Englishman guarding his home is quite wonderful. Don't you agree,
  Peter?"</p>

  <p>I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye, and saw the old
  well-remembered look on his face. He was deliberately goading the man on,
  though for what purpose I couldn't quite make out. This man Spragge was a
  powerful looking brute, and I failed to see any object in starting a rough
  house. And that was exactly what seemed imminent. With a flood of blasphemy
  the farmer flung open the gate, and slouched over to the car; and as he came
  Hugh opened the door and stepped into the road.</p>

  <p>"You " snarled Spragge. "I've warned you once: now you can have it."</p>

  <p>I almost laughed: how many men had said words to that effect in days gone
  by? And with the same result. Spragge shot out a fist like a leg of mutton,
  which encountered air, and the next instant he was lying flat on his back in
  the middle of the road, completely knocked out.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Peter," said Hugh urgently. " Sling the blighter into the back of
  the car, and we'll take him to the farm. Heaven forbid, old man," he chuckled
  as the Bentley spun up the track, "that we should be so grossly inhuman as to
  leave this poor injured fellow lying in the road. His wife's tender care is
  essential, and&mdash;keep your eyes skinned. We might spot something."</p>

  <p>We pulled up at the door, and almost immediately a woman appeared. She was
  a worthy helpmeet to Mr. Spragge: in fact I have seldom seen a more
  forbidding looking pair. Tall and gaunt, with a thin saturnine face and bony
  hands, she looked an even more unpleasant customer than her husband. He was a
  powerful, foul-tempered brute: she looked the personification of evil.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" she asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Spragge, I assume?" remarked Hugh politely. "I regret to state that
  your husband's jaw has encountered a hard substance, which has temporarily
  rendered him unconscious. So, my friend and I, at great personal
  inconvenience, have brought him to the dear old homestead. Shall we bring him
  in?"</p>

  <p>Spragge was already beginning to stir uneasily, so there was no time to be
  lost if we were to get inside the house.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," she said angrily. "What has happened to the
  fool?"</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me, madam," murmured Hugh, "to cavil at the excellent
  description of your spouse. But he will doubtless tell you all about it when
  he is his own bright self again."</p>

  <p>We had slung him out of the car and laid him on the grass, and as Hugh
  spoke I suddenly became aware of a noise that rose and fell regularly. It
  came from the inside of the house, and at that moment, Hugh evidently heard
  it too. He grinned faintly, and looked at the woman.</p>

  <p>"How nice it is to have a little peaceful nap in the afternoon," he
  murmured. "But you should never take in a lodger that snores, Mrs,
  Spragge."</p>

  <p>"Get out of this," came a thick voice from behind us. Spragge, who had
  come to, had raised himself on his elbow, and was glaring vindictively.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," cried Hugh. "Our own bright boy again. A little arnica applied
  by mother, and the face will be as good as new. But tell me, who is the human
  fog-horn within?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, mister," cried the woman shrilly, "you be off. This farm ain't
  no business of yours, and I'll thank you to get into your car and clear
  out."</p>

  <p>"The ingratitude of woman," said Hugh resignedly. "After all I've done for
  poor Mr. Spragge too. Well, Peter, never shall it be said that we stayed
  where we weren't wanted. We'll go. But do tell little Ferdinand when he wakes
  that he ought not to sleep on his back."</p>

  <p>He swung the car round, and as we went down the drive I glanced back. The
  man had scrambled to his feet, and was standing by his wife. And the two of
  them stood there motionless watching us, until we turned out of the drive
  into the main road.</p>

  <p>"Not much out of that, Peter, I'm afraid," said Hugh. " All that we have
  established is that the Spragges are a very unsavoury pair, and that they
  have a man who snores staying in the house. But whether the man who snores is
  the red and blue light merchant, or whether it is any of them, Heaven alone
  knows. And as far as I can see there is only one way to find out."</p>

  <p>"Which is?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To go there by night," he answered.</p>

  <p>"That's when the activity is likely to occur. And I've somehow or other
  got a hunch that our musical sleeper is going to turn out to be very much in
  the picture. Let's go back to the house now, so that you can dump your kit:
  then we'll have dinner at the Dolphin in Rye, and do a bit of night work
  after. Jove! Peter, I'm beginning to feel quite young again."</p>

  <p>"You'll be younger before you've finished," I said resignedly. " They tell
  me a few months in prison is a wonderful rejuvenator."</p>

  <p>But he only grinned; in an affair of this sort he was beyond hope.</p>

  <p>"Prison be blowed, old boy. We may be a pair of thugs, but we are young
  men from the Christian Association compared to this comic bunch. Besides, we
  can always retire from the contest if we want to."</p>

  <p>At that it was my turn to grin: a lion can retire from its kill if it
  wants to. At any rate time would show: up to date beyond putting Mr. Spragge
  to sleep we were blameless.</p>

  <p>The Bentley swung to the left as we came to Rye, and we took the circular
  road around the hill on which the town is built.</p>

  <p>"Up that cobbled road to the right, Peter," said Hugh when we had gone
  halfway round, "is the Dolphin Inn. A famed resort for smugglers in the old
  days, and an extraordinarily good pub now. On your left is the road to
  Hastings, but we go straight on up to the higher ground."</p>

  <p>We crossed the railway line, and another three miles brought us to Hugh's
  house, where I dropped my baggage. As he said, the view over the Marsh was
  wonderful: it lay spread out in front of us like an aeroplane photograph.</p>

  <p>"If you look through the telescope," he remarked, "you'll see it is
  focussed on Spragge's Farm."</p>

  <p>I adjusted the eyepiece and found that I could make out every detail of
  the house. Almost could I see the handle on the front door so powerful was
  the instrument. But though I kept my eye glued to it for fully five minutes I
  saw no sign of life. The place was deserted: presumably Mr. Spragge was
  dealing with the arnica, and the mysterious sleeper still snored.</p>

  <p>"When you're ready, Peter," he said, after, he had had a look himself, "we
  might stroll along past friend Granger's place. I'd like you to cast an eye
  on his preparations."</p>

  <p>I was ready, and so we once more took the road. A short ten minutes' walk
  brought us to our destination, and assuredly Hugh had not exaggerated when he
  called it a prison. The wall was about ten feet high, and constituted a
  fairly formidable obstacle in itself. But what made it practically impassable
  was the arrangement of steel spikes on the top. They faced in all directions:
  and each one was about two feet long. There was no gap anywhere: they
  continued over the massive wooden gates that formed the entrance. And by
  standing away from the wall I could see the top story of the house inside:
  every window was guarded with iron bars as Hugh had said.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman certainly seems to resent intrusion," I remarked, and even
  as I spoke a small two-seater went past us and stopped outside the gates. A
  young man was driving it, and by his side was an extremely pretty girl. For a
  time they sat in the car looking somewhat dubiously at the prospect
  confronting them: then they both turned round and looked at us. And after a
  moment or two the man got out and came over to us.</p>

  <p>He was a cheerful looking youngster with a snub nose and freckles, and
  when he spoke he had a perfectly charming smile.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said, "but is either of you Mr. Granger?"</p>

  <p>"Not guilty," remarked Hugh. " The gentleman you're after is inside the
  fortifications."</p>

  <p>"I say," he went on a bit awkwardly, "you'll understand I don't want to be
  rude, or any tripe of that sort, but what kind of a bird is he?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?" said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;the lady with me has taken on a secretarial job with
  Mr. Granger. And dash it all, this bally place looks like an inebriates'
  home."</p>

  <p>"It's not that as far as I know," said Hugh. "But frankly I shouldn't call
  it the sort of household that I'd like a girl I knew to go to."</p>

  <p>"You hear that, Pat," he sung out. "This gentleman thinks the show is a
  dud."</p>

  <p>The girl got out of the car and came and joined us. Though usually of an
  unobservant nature, I noticed that there was a ring on her engagement finger,
  and with the acumen of Sherlock Holmes I arrived at what turned out to be the
  correct solution.</p>

  <p>"Can't help that, Freckles," she said calmly. "Dud or no dud, I've had
  fifty of the best out of the old bean and that's that."</p>

  <p>"You could send the money back," he said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Easily, little bright-eyes," she laughed, "if I had it to send.
  Unfortunately all that remains is twelve shillings and fourpence
  halfpenny."</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of a snag," he admitted. " But look here, Pat, I don't like
  the smell of this place at all."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I," she agreed frankly. "But what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me anything about this gentleman, sir?"</p>

  <p>He turned again to Hugh with a worried look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Practically nothing, I'm afraid," said Hugh. "He came here some years
  ago, and had all these affairs erected round the house. He calls nowhere and
  sees no one, and the only other occupants of the house are a man and his
  wife."</p>

  <p>"There is a woman there then. That's good."</p>

  <p>The youngster looked vaguely relieved.</p>

  <p>"But may I ask exactly how you came to hear of this job?" said Hugh to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Quite easily," she smiled. " I had my name down at a bureau in London for
  secretarial work. Ten days ago I went in to find if anything was doing, and
  the woman who runs it offered me this. It might have been anybody else, only
  I happened to be the first. And the terms were so very good that I jumped at
  it. Five pounds a week, and fifty on account."</p>

  <p>"Ten days ago," said Hugh thoughtfully, glancing at me, and it was clear
  what he was thinking. If this girl had only heard of it then the offer must
  have been made before the appearance of the lights on the Marsh.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea what your work is to be?" went on Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," she answered. "Presumably an ordinary secretarial
  job."</p>

  <p>Once again Hugh glanced at me: then he lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I told this gentleman," he remarked, "it's not the sort of house
  I'd choose for a rest cure. But I may be wrong: I've never been inside
  myself. Only there is one thing you ought to know."</p>

  <p>And then very briefly he told her about the mysterious signals from
  Spragge's Farm. She listened in silence, but the result was a foregone
  conclusion. Her mind was made up, though Freckles did his best to dissuade
  her.</p>

  <p>"Can't you possibly chuck it, Pat?" he said earnestly.</p>

  <p>"How can I, you mut?" laughed the girl. "I tell you I've spent the fifty
  quid."</p>

  <p>"And I'm overdrawn ," he muttered. "Hell!"</p>

  <p>"Look here," began Hugh and I simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The girl gave us both a delicious smile.</p>

  <p>"Sweet of you both," she said. " I know just what you were going to say.
  But I couldn't dream of it. After all this old bird can't eat me. I shall be
  all right, Tom: don't you worry."</p>

  <p>"But I do worry," answered the youth. " So would anybody who saw what sort
  of a house it was."</p>

  <p>"Go and press the bell, my pet," she said firmly. " It's little Patricia
  for the shore. Go on, you ass: we can't stand here in the road all day."</p>

  <p>He went over reluctantly and did as he was told, and suddenly Hugh
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Miss?"</p>

  <p>"Verney," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Mine is Drummond: and this is Peter Darrell. What I was going to say was
  this. My house is the next one to this&mdash;about half a mile away towards
  Rye. Now everything may be quite O.K., but in case&mdash;only in case, mind
  you&mdash;it isn't, it will help you to know that we're near at hand. So one
  or other of us will make a point of being here between two and three each
  day. Of course it's quite on the cards that you'll be able to take a walk: in
  fact, if I were you I'd insist on it. Then if anything crops up you can come
  and tell us. But if by any chance he keeps you inside or makes you stop in
  the garden, and you want to get at us, just write a note, put it in an
  envelope with half a brick inside and bung it over the wall. You can spot the
  place&mdash;close by the gate, and we'll be here to get it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks most awfully," said the girl gratefully, "though I'm quite certain
  it won't be necessary. Oh! my goodness, what an awful looking man!"</p>

  <p>The peephole in the gate had opened suddenly, and staring through it was
  the man who I placed at once as the pugilistic servant. He was certainly not
  a prepossessing sight as his narrow eyes took us in in turn, and the girl's
  exclamation was very natural. Suspicion was in every line of his face, and it
  was not until he saw Hugh that his expression cleared.</p>

  <p>"This lady," said Hugh, "has come to do secretarial work for Mr. Granger.
  Presumably you are expecting her."</p>

  <p>The man made no reply, but stared up and down the road. Then at last we
  heard an iron bar clang and the gate opened just sufficiently to let him
  through.</p>

  <p>"Come quickly," he said in a harsh voice. "Mr. Granger expects you, but we
  had forgotten your coming."</p>

  <p>"My trunk is in the car," said the girl. "Get it, please. Don't touch the
  typewriter: I will carry that myself."</p>

  <p>"Pat: I don't like it." Freckles made one final, despairing attempt.
  "Can't you possibly get out of it? "</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I like it very much myself, Tom," she said quietly, "but
  I'm going through with it for all that."</p>

  <p>The man, with the trunk on his shoulder, stood in the open gateway
  beckoning to her urgently.</p>

  <p>"So long, old son," she said with a smile. And then turning to Hugh she
  held out her hand. "Between two and three: I'll remember."</p>

  <p>She took her machine out of the car, and the iron bar clanged to
  inside.</p>

  <p>"Damn it," began Freckles, "she oughtn't to have gone. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, and at the same time I felt the flesh at the back of
  my scalp begin to tingle. For from inside the wall there came the deep-noted
  baying of a hound. It rose and fell, in a snarling roar of incredible
  ferocity: then as suddenly as it had begun it ceased, and only the faint
  noise of rattling bars could be heard.</p>

  <p>I looked at the boy: he was as white as a sheet. And the next moment he
  had sprung forward and was pounding with his fists on the gate.</p>

  <p>"Pat," he shouted, "Pat! Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>Came her answer, faint and a little tremulous.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Tom. It's locked up."</p>

  <p>For a while we stood there looking at one another, whilst the colour
  slowly came back to his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! that gave me a shock," he said at length. " I ought never to
  have let her take this filthy job," he added savagely.</p>

  <p>On Hugh Drummond's face there appeared his habitual cheery smile.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he cried, "from the little I know of the adorable sex,
  the question, as they say in Parliament, did not arise. Miss Verney had
  determined to take the job, and that was that. Don't you worry: we'll look
  after her."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," said Freckles gloomily. " Anyway, I'm going to
  put up at the pub here till I'm certain she's all right."</p>

  <p>For a moment Hugh hesitated, and I could see he was summing the boy
  up.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said after a while, "don't bother about a pub. Come and
  put up with me.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean it?" He stared at Hugh doubtfully. " I mean&mdash;dash
  it &mdash;you hardly know me. You don't even know my name."</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you not to steal the spoons," laughed Hugh. " But it would be
  an advantage to know your name."</p>

  <p>"Scott," said Freckles. "Tom Scott. And it's really most awfully good of
  you. I'd love to stay with you if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't have asked you if I did," said Hugh. "Let's get into that bus
  of yours and push back to the house."</p>

  <p>"It may take a bit of time to start her," said the proud owner. " I picked
  her up cheap."</p>

  <p>At the end of five minutes his prophecy had proved correct. Acting under
  instructions, I had pulled out a wire and received a severe electric shock:
  Hugh had stamped on a button, causing a loud explosion and a discharge of
  grey smoke through the radiator. But finally she commenced to fire on at
  least two of the four cylinders and we started, the driver's face wreathed in
  a complacent smile.</p>

  <p>"The steering is a bit dicky," he explained as we missed a milestone by an
  inch. "Wants knowing. Nearly took a tramcar coming over Vauxhall Bridge this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," gasped Hugh, who was precariously clutching at the
  sides of the dickey, "that you drove this abom&mdash;this affair out of
  London?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Freckles. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"To the left here," muttered Hugh feebly. "And for God's sake don't kill
  the cat. She has maternal duties to perform at the moment."</p>

  <p>A frightful crash occurred in the bowels of the machine, and we came to a
  halt.</p>

  <p>"When the brakes don't act, I put her into reverse," explained Freckles,
  and Hugh nodded weakly.</p>

  <p>"I no longer have any fears for Miss Verney," he remarked. "Her perils at
  present are as nothing to driving out of London in this machine. However,
  young fellow, we'll have it pushed round to the garage and then we must have
  a little talk. Because there are one or two things you've got to get into
  your head."</p>

  <p>He led the way into the house, and we followed him.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you your room afterwards," he said to Scott. "But after that
  motor drive I want a nerve tonic. Help yourselves, you fellows: it's all on
  the sideboard."</p>

  <p>We took our drinks outside and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Now I suppose I'm right," began Hugh, "in assuming that you are
  responsible for the ring on Miss Verney's finger?"</p>

  <p>"That's so," said Freckles with a grin. "We fixed it a month ago, but
  since neither of us has a bean the outlook is a bit grim."</p>

  <p>"You've got plenty of time before you," laughed Hugh. "However, just at
  the moment we'll leave your matrimonial prospects. You heard what I said to
  your fiancee about those lights on the Marsh, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," cried the boy. "What's the game do you think?"</p>

  <p>"That," said Hugh, "is exactly what Darrell and I had decided to find out.
  We still propose to find out, but now you and Miss Verney have come into the
  picture."</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven she hadn't," said Scott gloomily.</p>

  <p>"If she hadn't you wouldn't have either," remarked Hugh. "And we shouldn't
  be sitting here drinking a whisky and soda and having this talk. But she did
  and there's no more to be said about it. Now let me say at once that I do not
  believe she is in any danger, so you can set your mind at rest over that. But
  I do believe that she's in a house where some pretty funny doings are going
  to happen in the near future. It's obvious that her boss is terrified to
  death of something, though what that something is we know no more than you.
  But we propose to have a dip at finding out to-night."</p>

  <p>"How?" cried Scott eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you heard me mention Spragge's Farm. If you look
  through that telescope you'll find that it is focussed on it. And that is the
  house from which the lights have come. It therefore looks as if there was a
  connection between it and Mr. Granger's terror, which has only arisen since
  the signal was given. This afternoon Peter and I, by a little subterfuge, got
  as far as the front door, but we couldn't get any farther. However, it was
  enough to prove that there is someone else in the house beside Spragge and
  his wife, because we heard the blighter snoring. To-night we propose to
  investigate again, and you can come too if you like."</p>

  <p>"If I like," cried Freckles joyfully. "Lead me to it."</p>

  <p>"But on one condition," said Hugh quietly. "There seems to me to be every
  prospect of a bit of fun, and fun is too hard to come by to run any risk of
  having it spoiled. If you come in with us, Scott, you have got to do as you
  are told. No fancy tricks of your own or anything of that sort&mdash;do you
  get me?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," answered the other. "I'll do just what you say."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "Now come here, and let me feel your muscle. Not too
  bad. Got it cranking that infernal contrivance of yours, I suppose. Anyway,
  don't forget the golden rule&mdash;if you've got to hit, hit first."</p>

  <p>"I say you really are a priceless pair," said Freckles ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"We may get a bit of sport," said Hugh casually, and then his eyes
  narrowed suddenly. "Isn't that a car, at the turn-off to Spragge's Farm?"</p>

  <p>He went to the telescope and focussed it.</p>

  <p>"A big yellow one, Peter," he said. "There's a woman in the driver's seat
  with a man beside her. And leaning over the gate talking to them is our Mr.
  Spragge himself unless I'm much mistaken. Now I wonder if they've got
  anything to do with it. Hullo! they are turning round, and going back towards
  Rye. Going like hell into the bargain. Come on, let's hit the Bentley. We
  might spot something."</p>

  <p>"A Bentley," sighed Freckles. "Indeed and in truth the Lord is good. And
  incidentally, Drummond, if it's any good to you at any time, I'm used to
  driving the breed."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "It may come in handy."</p>

  <p>We fell into the car, and he let her out. He drove, as he did everything
  else, magnificently, and in four minutes we struck the top of the hill
  leading down to Rye. Now as I say, Hugh had trodden on the juice, and yet,
  roaring up the hill towards us was a big yellow car driven by a woman with a
  man sitting beside her. And another in the back seat. I had a fleeting
  glimpse of a beautiful, rather scornful face bending over the wheel, and a
  man with a small pointed beard sitting beside her: then they had flashed
  past.</p>

  <p>"See which way they go, Peter," sang out Hugh, braking hard.</p>

  <p>"They've turned off towards your house," I said.</p>

  <p>"And towards Granger's," he answered, swinging into the entrance of a
  house to turn. "By George! they must have travelled."</p>

  <p>"An Isotto straight twelve," remarked Freckles casually. "But you've got
  the legs of them in this. Oh! if Mother only knew what her baby boy was doing
  instead of sitting in Prodom and Peanut's office, the old girl would pass
  right out."</p>

  <p>"You are a reprehensible young devil," chuckled Hugh as we started up the
  hill again. "But the girl at the wheel, Peter, was undoubtedly a pippin of
  the first order."</p>

  <p>And as from a great distance I heard the voices of two adorable ladies in
  the Hermitage at Le Touquet wondering how the dear lambs were enjoying their
  golf.</p>

  <p>We swung past the entrance to Hugh's house, and then he slackened speed a
  little.</p>

  <p>"No good looking as if we were racing them," he said. "And if they've got
  anything to do with it By Jove! Peter, they have."</p>

  <p>The yellow car had stopped at the entrance to Granger's house. The
  occupants were still sitting in it, and were apparently studying the place.
  But as we passed they all three stared at us.</p>

  <p>"Don't look round," said Hugh quietly. "Though I'm afraid we've committed
  a tactical bloomer. Do you think they spotted us as the car they met on the
  hill?"</p>

  <p>"The chauffeur bloke at the back did," said Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said Hugh. "However it is done now. We'll go back to Rye by
  another route. Now I wonder where that bunch come into the picture. In fact,
  I wonder the hell of a lot of things."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3"></a>III. &mdash; IN WHICH WE COME TO SPRAGGE'S FARM BY
     NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Dolphin Inn at Rye is almost too well known to need
  description. It stands halfway up a steep cobbled hill in the centre of the
  town, and to its hospitable doors come all sorts and conditions of men.
  Tourists, artists, golfers&mdash;all may be found there&mdash;discussing
  everything from the history of the Cinque Ports to the Putt that Failed on
  the Last Green. Of old, when the sea lapped round the foothills of Rye, and
  in later years too, it was a well-known haunt of smugglers, as Hugh had said.
  Many a cask of old brandy: many a roll of silk had come in through the front
  door, which the most drastic search by preventive men had failed to reveal.
  There were stories told of secret passages, and sliding panels by means of
  which the Excise men were outwitted; but in the present year of grace the
  only sliding panel in evidence is the one through which the barman hands out
  the necessary.</p>

  <p>It was half-past six when we entered the lounge hall, having left the car
  at the bottom of the hill. Two old ladies were sitting in one corner immersed
  in guide books, whilst another was occupied by an elderly clergyman. There
  was plenty of room for us, but Hugh went straight through to a small room
  which led off the main hall.</p>

  <p>"The only untouched part of the hotel," he remarked. "This room is as it
  was when the place was built."</p>

  <p>Nearly the whole of one end of it was occupied by a huge fireplace, in
  which as the guide book put it, "it was the custom on special occasions to
  roast an ox whole." The special occasions presumably were when a particularly
  good haul of contraband had successfully eluded the coastguard men. On each
  side of the fireplace the wall consisted of a sort of scroll-work, long since
  blackened by the smoke. The shelves were filled with pewter&mdash;some
  valuable, but for the most part modern stuff. And perhaps the most
  interesting thing in the room was an old map worked in embroidery, showing
  the country in 1723. Even as late as that the sea was very nearly up to the
  outskirts of Rye, and almost the whole of Romney Marsh was covered with
  water.</p>

  <p>"Looks a bit different, doesn't it?" said Hugh, studying it idly. "Where
  we dotted old man Spragge one this afternoon was a bally lake. There's where
  his farm is, Scott," he went on. "And that is our destination to-night. By
  Jove! " he added with sudden interest, "that must be Granger's house. I'd no
  idea it was so old. A convent: that accounts for the wall round it."</p>

  <p>"Naughty girls&mdash;the nuns," said Freckles. "Do you know the
  story?"</p>

  <p>But we never heard this bright particular gem, because at that moment two
  men came in, one of whom hailed Hugh with a shout of joy. He wore a Guards
  tie, and his face seemed vaguely familiar to me.</p>

  <p>"You old blighter," he cried. "Fancy meeting you here."</p>

  <p>"Hullo! John James," said Hugh. "How's yourself? You know Darrell, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I met you once in the pavilion at Lord's," cried the newcomer, and then I
  placed him. He was whisky or beer or something, and rolled in money. Sir John
  Jameson, Bart., was his name, and he had recently come into the title.
  Moreover he had a big place somewhere in Kent.</p>

  <p>"This is Scott," went on Hugh. "Sir John Jameson."</p>

  <p>"This undoubtedly calls for a drop of the old and bold," said John James.
  "By the way, this is Piggy Heythrop, who suffers from the delusion that he
  can beat me at golf. Waiter&mdash;five martinis. Well, old lad&mdash;what are
  you doing down here?"</p>

  <p>"I've rented a house for the summer called Bay Trees. Principally because
  there isn't one."</p>

  <p>"The devil you have," cried the other. "Why, man, that house used to
  belong to my governor. And the one next door as well. Look here, Hugh, we've
  got back to Laidley Towers: you and your lady wife must come over and
  stop."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a moment, John," said Hugh. "You say the next-door house used
  to belong to you. Which one do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Temple Tower. Used to be a convent. The old man sold 'em both about
  twenty years ago. Personally I was rather sorry about Temple Tower. It's got
  a very interesting history. I wonder who has it now."</p>

  <p>"A very eccentric individual," said Hugh. "By name of Granger. He's
  barricaded the place like a prison: put two-foot spikes round the top of the
  wall, and bars on every window. He's got a menagerie in the garden, and any
  caller is examined through a hole in the gate before he is let in. It would
  take a cross between a monkey and a mongoose all its time to get in, let
  alone a human being."</p>

  <p>John James stared at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary bloke," he remarked. "Doesn't sound as if he was
  all there. Still I bet I'd penetrate the fastness: once, that is, I'd
  negotiated the wall."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said Hugh sitting up with a jerk,</p>

  <p>"I told you the place had belonged to us," said the other. "Well&mdash;it
  used to be a convent.</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Hugh. "Just seen it marked on the map."</p>

  <p>"And the nuns, bless 'em, though forbidden to receive male visitors
  through the front door got away with the goods through the back. There's an
  underground passage leading from an old crypt in the garden which runs into
  one of the cellars."</p>

  <p>"Are you certain?" cried Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am, old boy. Mr. Monk, having said his little piece in the
  crypt, toddled along the passage to pay his respects to the lady of his
  choice in the house. Why, we've got an old plan of it hanging up in the hall
  at Laidley Towers."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been along this passage, John?" demanded Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have," admitted the other. "As a matter of fact, it's not
  quite as plain sailing as it sounds. You see--"</p>

  <p>"How much did you beat him by?" said Hugh suddenly, "We must have a game
  one day, John."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" stammered the bewildered baronet. "I&mdash;er--"</p>

  <p>"How are the links playing, John? Must be a bit dry, I suppose."</p>

  <p>And it was then I became aware that someone else had entered the room. It
  was the bearded man who had been sitting by the girl in the car. Hugh went on
  calmly talking golf: John James, though still looking slightly dazed,
  followed his lead, until Heythrop, happening to look at his watch, gave a
  startled exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! John&mdash;it's nearly half-past seven."</p>

  <p>"The devil it is," cried the other. "We must go, Hugh. Got the most
  ghastly collection of county bores dining. Look here&mdash;I'll come over and
  see you to-morrow sometime."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Hugh. "We might have a four ball."</p>

  <p>He followed them into the hall, and under cover of some desultory
  conversation with young Scott I took stock of the bearded gentleman.</p>

  <p>He was a good-looking man of his type, but the type was not one that
  appealed to me. His features were aquiline: his mouth full and red under the
  carefully trimmed beard. His clothes were perfect&mdash;rather too perfect,
  and though they carried the unmistakable stamp of an English tailor, in some
  strange way they served to accentuate the fact that the man who wore them was
  not an Englishman. His hands were beautifully kept: his pearl tie-pin was a
  little too ostentatious. In fact, the man was overdressed: he didn't fit into
  the picture. He gave the impression of the exquisite hero in musical
  comedy.</p>

  <p>He looked up suddenly, and found my eyes were fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"A very interesting part of your country," he said suavely.</p>

  <p>"Most," I answered shortly, feeling a little annoyed at having been
  discovered staring at him.</p>

  <p>"And this inn certainly belies the terrible reputation enjoyed by your
  country hotels abroad," he went on politely.</p>

  <p>"A reputation which I fear is thoroughly deserved," I answered as affably
  as I could. After all, there was no good showing my feelings, though I found
  myself disliking his voice even more than his appearance. It was oily and
  sleek&mdash;if a voice can be sleek: and underlying it was another quality
  which for the moment I could not spot. Then I got it&mdash;it was cruelty: I
  could imagine the man opening his flat gold cigarette case, and extracting
  one with the utmost deliberation, just in order to keep his victim on the
  rack a little longer so that he might gloat over him.</p>

  <p>We talked on casually, and all the time I was wondering what nationality
  he was. Italian possibly, though his English was faultless. The girl, in the
  two quick glimpses I had had of her might well have been Italian. And what
  was their relationship to one another? I knew that he was studying me also,
  though our conversation was confined to banalities: studying young Scott too
  with his heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

  <p>"Golf," he was saying, "is a game which I unfortunately have never had the
  opportunity to master."</p>

  <p>"Master!" broke in Freckles with a laugh. "You're in the same boat as a
  good many other people."</p>

  <p>"So I believe," he said politely. "And yet it seems to the outsider that
  it should not be hard to hit a stationary ball with some degree of precision.
  Dear me&mdash;what's that?"</p>

  <p>From outside had come a sudden crash, followed by a loud "Damnation," in
  Hugh's voice. I rose at once, followed by Scott, and went into the hall.
  Standing outside the door was Hugh staring upwards; at his feet, smashed to
  pieces on the cobble, was a heavy chimney-pot.</p>

  <p>"Confound it," he exploded when he saw me, "this cursed thing only missed
  me by about a foot."</p>

  <p>Attracted by the noise the boots had appeared, and two or three of the
  guests were staring out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, sir, I'm sure," said Boots scratching his head. "Such a thing
  ain't never happened before, not to my knowledge."</p>

  <p>"And if it happens again somebody is going to get a thick ear," said Hugh
  grimly. He was still staring upwards and his mouth was set in a hard line.
  Then with a little shrug of his shoulders he entered the hotel.</p>

  <p>"I must apologise for my language," he said with a smile to the
  clergyman.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," said the cleric benignly, "a mild expletive is surely
  permissible under the circumstances. Why, if that heavy thing had hit you on
  the head it might have stunned you."</p>

  <p>Hugh gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"As you say, it might have stunned me," he agreed. "But it didn't. I am
  going to wash, Peter, and then we might have some dinner."</p>

  <p>We followed him to the lavatory, and he carefully closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Ever heard of a chimney-pot falling on a dead calm day?" he said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said Freckles looking startled.</p>

  <p>"I strolled down to the bottom of the hill to see John off," went on Hugh.
  "And also to put him wise to one or two things. Then I came back, and was
  standing outside the door lighting a cigarette. A sitting target, though I
  must say it never dawned on me that anything of that sort was likely to
  happen. But luckily the blighter missed."</p>

  <p>"You think someone pushed the thing over deliberately?" cried
  Freckles.</p>

  <p>"I don't think: I know. I saw his shadow move."</p>

  <p>"Then why not go and have a look-see," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"Because the shadow will have moved a considerable distance by now,"
  answered Hugh dryly. "In other words we'd find nothing, and merely make
  ourselves look fools. But don't be under any delusions, you fellows: that was
  a deliberate attempt by someone to lay me out."</p>

  <p>"It can't have been the bearded gentleman," I said. "He's been talking to
  us ever since you left."</p>

  <p>"I don't know who it was," said Hugh drying his hands, "But if he, or
  they, are prepared to go to the length of attempted murder it proves one
  thing at any rate. We're up against a pretty tough lot. It's all right, young
  fellow," he went on as Scott's face fell. "This bunch is outside the garden
  wall: your girl is inside."</p>

  <p>But to me privately as we went out, leaving Freckles to the basin, he was
  not so optimistic.</p>

  <p>"We were fools, Peter," he said. "We ought never to have allowed that girl
  to go inside that house. I'm not frightened of anything happening to her now:
  what I am afraid of is what is going to take place if this lot, whoever they
  are, do get inside."</p>

  <p>"You think that's the game?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Granger is the game," he said. "And if the mountain won't go to Mahommed,
  Mahommed must go to the mountain. Granger has gone to ground in his house,
  and nothing short of an earthquake is going to get him out. Therefore to get
  him, they've got to get into the house. <i>Voil&agrave; tout</i>."</p>

  <p>"We might send her a letter telling her to leave," I suggested.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"From what I saw of the girl," he laughed, "I think she'd tell us to go to
  blazes."</p>

  <p>Young Scott joined us and we went in to dinner. And though Hugh
  deliberately kept the conversation on outside topics, I couldn't keep my mind
  off the problem that confronted us. The whole thing seemed so utterly
  disconnected: that was the trouble. What link bound the bearded man and his
  companions with the snorer at Spragge's Farm? What was the signification of
  the red and blue lights? Above all, if Hugh was right, and he was not a man
  who made mistakes on matters of that sort, who was it who had deliberately
  tried to lay him out with the chimney-pot? And why?</p>

  <p>The bearded man was eliminated, which left of those we knew the girl and
  the chauffeur. But even granted it was one of them the second question
  remained unanswered. Why? Even if we had aroused their suspicions by going
  back on our tracks in the car, their return for it seemed a little
  drastic.</p>

  <p>Another alternative came into my mind: supposing it wasn't them at all?
  Supposing we had struck some completely new factor in the situation? Again
  came the same unanswerable question. Why? What had we done&mdash;or rather
  what had Hugh done&mdash;to give any possible reason for trying to kill him?
  The only person who could legitimately feel that way was Spragge, and it
  seemed well nigh incredible that that worthy should have secreted himself on
  the roof on the bare chance of laying him out.</p>

  <p>From Spragge my thoughts turned to the snorer. He was a possibility. True
  he hadn't seen us as far as we knew, but Hugh was an easy man to describe.
  Supposing Spragge had told him what had happened in the afternoon: supposing
  the man was a criminal and thought detectives were after him, and had
  determined to try to get rid of them?... And then I gave it up: it was
  obvious that that solution wouldn't hold water. Genuine detectives don't go
  about the country in racing Bentleys slogging people over the jaw. And
  further he had no possible means of knowing that we were going to be at the
  Dolphin.</p>

  <p>We were halfway through dinner when the bearded man and the girl entered.
  She swept past us as if the whole of Rye belonged to her, but her companion
  paused by our table and nodded to me.</p>

  <p>"I must congratulate you, sir," he said turning to Hugh, "on your narrow
  escape. I was talking to your friends at the time, and the crash was
  terrific."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," said Hugh gravely. "It's the worst of these old
  houses: anything might happen."</p>

  <p>"Precisely: anything might happen," agreed the other, and with a bow he
  passed on to his table.</p>

  <p>"Unless I am much mistaken," said Hugh thoughtfully, "the time is coming
  in the very near future when that gentleman's face will disappear through the
  back of his skull. He is the type of mess I like not: moreover he is
  undoubtedly one of the players. So here's to hoping.</p>

  <p>We finished our dinner in silence, and it was not until the coffee came
  that any further allusion was made to the subject. Hugh, I could tell, was
  trying to puzzle things cut in his own mind as I had done, and
  Freckles&mdash;the confounded young scoundrel&mdash;couldn't keep his eyes
  off the girl.</p>

  <p>"What's the plan of campaign, Hugh, for to-night?" I asked, after the
  waiter had left us.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking over it, Peter," he answered, "and I've come to the
  conclusion that the safest way of tackling it if we want to find out
  anything, will be to approach the house from the other side&mdash;that is
  from the sea. I figure it out this way. We are obviously under suspicion: it
  is known that we are taking an interest in Spragge's Farm, in that swab over
  there all covered with hair, in Granger's house&mdash;in fact, in the whole
  outfit. If, as is more than likely, we are all three seen leaving Rye in the
  Bentley and taking the road towards Spragge's Farm, the betting is a fiver to
  a dried pea that we shall be followed. We'll have to leave the car in the
  road, and that gives us away completely. So my suggestion is this. There is a
  road&mdash;it's pretty bad, but it will serve&mdash;that runs past the golf
  links and goes down to the sea. True we still have to leave Rye in the
  direction of the farm, but as long as they don't find the car in the road it
  doesn't matter. In fact it's rather to the good; it may help to put 'em off
  the scent if they think we've gone on towards Folkestone. So we'll leave the
  car on the sea road, which incidentally peters out into nothing, strike
  inland on foot, and approach Spragge's Farm from the rear. And after that,
  it's on the lap of the gods. Ever done any night work, young Scott?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of night work?" demanded Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Moving about country at night, of course."</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have," admitted the youngster.</p>

  <p>"Well, keep close to me, and do exactly as you are told," said Hugh. "And
  pay attention to where you put your clumsy great feet. We'll want silence,
  and don't forget it."</p>

  <p>"Do you think there is a chance of a scrap?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said Hugh. "But I want to avoid one if
  possible. We want to find out all we can, and not be discovered doing
  so."</p>

  <p>"What time do you suggest starting?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Let's see," he calculated. "It will be a good hour's walk&mdash;perhaps
  more. Allowing for the car journey&mdash;say an hour and a half. So if we
  leave here as soon as we've finished dinner, we ought to strike the farm
  about eleven thirty."</p>

  <p>He finished his coffee and got up. And for the first time to my knowledge
  the girl showed herself aware of our existence. Her glance rested on
  Hugh&mdash; coolly and thoughtfully: then I was honoured and after that young
  Scott. Then she returned to her dinner as if we had been summed up and
  dismissed, for all the world like a man turning down three horses that had
  been brought out for his inspection. I said as much to Hugh as we left the
  coffee-room, and he smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Bless her heart," he laughed. "I wonder if it was she who tried to anoint
  my head with the chimney-pot. Incidentally, I wonder what their names are.
  Presumably they are staying here since she has changed for dinner."</p>

  <p>We opened the hotel register, and looked at the last three entries.</p>

  <p>Paul Vandali. Madame Vandali. Jean Picot.</p>

  <p>"H'm," grunted Hugh. "If the names are genuine, they mark the chauffeur
  down as French, and the other two as Southerners of sorts. Possibly Italian.
  However, we shall doubtless find out in time. Now you fellows, smoke if you
  want to, because once we start walking it will be a case of no lights."</p>

  <p>We strolled down the hill, and I noticed that Hugh was glancing from side
  to side. But the road seemed deserted, and we got into the car without having
  seen a soul.</p>

  <p>"One hour at this time of night ought to be enough to make Folkestone," he
  said as we got in.</p>

  <p>"Did you see him, Peter?" he asked me as we drove off.</p>

  <p>"Not a sign," I said surprised. "Where was he?"</p>

  <p>"In the shadow of that big warehouse place. Mr. Jean Picot for a tozzy. I
  couldn't make out his face, but there was someone there crouching against the
  wall."</p>

  <p>"Then let's hope you put him off," I remarked.</p>

  <p>The night was a perfect one for our purpose. Already dark, it would be
  darker still, as the moon was not due to rise till three o'clock. A faint
  breeze was blowing, and in the distance the light of a signal gleamed like a
  great red star. For the first half mile the road ran dead straight: then came
  a T-bend. To the left lay the road to Folkestone and to the proper entrance
  to Spragge's Farm: to the right lay our route to the sea. And so it was with
  some surprise, after what he had said at dinner, that I found Hugh swing
  left-handed when we got there.</p>

  <p>"There are no flies on those birds," he said briefly. "And on these
  marshes you can see the headlights of a car for miles."</p>

  <p>He drove on for perhaps another mile until he came to a small track
  leading off the road. Then he switched off the headlights, and turned the
  car.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking no chances, Peter," he said as we drove slowly back with only
  the small side lamps alight. "We're up against brains this trip."</p>

  <p>We got back to the bend without having met anyone, and took our proper
  road. He was still driving without headlights and so our progress was slow.
  Gradually the road got worse and worse, until the murmur of the sea on the
  shore to our right told us we had struck the coast. To our left lay the sand
  dunes, and Hugh continually peered in that direction as if looking for some
  landmark .</p>

  <p>"There's a path somewhere about here which leads a little way into the
  dunes," he explained. "It will give us a bit of cover for the bus. Here it
  is."</p>

  <p>We swung along it, and after going about twenty yards he pulled up. The
  car was almost hidden from the road: certainly at night no one passing along
  would be likely to spot it. And there we left it, and struck inland on foot,
  Hugh leading. At first the going was bad: the low sandhills so beloved of
  golfers exercise no attraction for the mere pedestrian. But after a while it
  got better, and the loose-shifting soil gave place to firm reclaimed
  ground.</p>

  <p>We walked in silence; only the harsh cry of a stray night bird broke the
  stillness of the night. In the distance the lights of Rye glittered from the
  hill: in front of us darkness save for an occasional gleam from some
  cottage.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Hugh paused, and we came up with him. He was standing on the edge
  of a dyke&mdash;one of the many which intersect the Marsh in all directions.
  But for some reason or other this one seemed to interest him.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen one so broad," he explained. "This is more like a
  miniature canal. However, it seems to be leading in the right direction. We
  may as well follow it up."</p>

  <p>We walked on once more, sticking to the bank, until once again he paused,
  this time with a low whistle of surprise. A boat was in the water completely
  covered with a tarpaulin, and even in the darkness it was easy to see that it
  was no ordinary row-boat. He scrambled down, and lifted up the covering: then
  he came up and joined us again.</p>

  <p>"A motor-boat and a powerful one," he said thoughtfully. "Now I wonder if
  that is also part of the jigsaw. Or is it just a perfectly harmless machine
  belonging to some perfectly harmless individual?"</p>

  <p>"Useful for smuggling," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Quite," he answered. "Or as a line of escape. Do you notice, Peter, that
  the dyke narrows and becomes congested with weeds from here inland? Whereas
  the other way presumably it is clear right down to the sea. However, there is
  no good wasting time. We'll just make a mental note of the fact that it is
  here."</p>

  <p>We pushed on again still keeping to the edge of the dyke. And now there
  were more signs of life. We saw sheep in a field to our left, and also a few
  cows.</p>

  <p>"This is probably Spragge's ground," said Hugh. "We must begin to go
  warily. Hullo! Is that our friends, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>In front of us about a mile away we could see the headlights of a car. It
  was moving fast in the Folkestone direction, and for a while we stopped and
  looked at it. At one moment it seemed to be coming straight towards us: then
  as the road jinked we saw only the reflection of the lights travelling
  sideways across our front. And so we stood until the glare had almost faded
  away to our right: almost but not quite. For Hugh had been correct in his
  tactics: it was our friends as he had predicted. The reflection became
  stationary in the sky: shifted as the car turned, and then became again the
  headlights returning on the same road. And to me there seemed something
  strangely ominous in that powerful silent light searching the country for us,
  with people who we even now knew would stick at nothing, in the car behind
  it. Was the girl driving again, with Paul Vandali sitting beside her; or were
  other unknown people on the trail too?</p>

  <p>"Let's hope that has put 'em off the scent anyway," said Hugh as the light
  disappeared in the direction of Rye. "It's lucky we took the sea road."</p>

  <p>Once more we struck out along the bank of the dyke. We walked in single
  file with Hugh leading and young Scott in the centre. Sheep were becoming
  more plentiful now, and suddenly Hugh came to an abrupt halt,</p>

  <p>"There's the house," he said in a low voice as we joined him. "Straight in
  front of us."</p>

  <p>It lay there black and silent. No chink of light came from any window: no
  sound broke the stillness save the faint creaking of the branches of a tree,
  A little to one side lay the outhouse we had noticed that afternoon and
  suddenly Hugh clutched my arm.</p>

  <p>"There's a light filtering through a crack in the wall, Peter. In the
  outhouse. Don't you see it? And, by Jove!" his grip tightened, "we're not the
  only prowlers abroad to-night. Somebody passed across the light just
  then."</p>

  <p>We stood there motionless, scarcely breathing, staring into the darkness.
  I could see the light distinctly now, shining probably through the hinge of
  the door. But no further shadow blotted it out: the other nocturnal wanderer,
  whoever he was, was lying up in the darkness now like us.</p>

  <p>"It is the possibility of a dog that I'm afraid of," whispered Hugh. "It
  might have been one of the household who is walking about."</p>

  <p>Cautiously, a step at a time, we crept nearer. And after a while I became
  conscious of a curious noise. It would last for perhaps ten seconds: then
  cease abruptly. And after a pause it would be repeated. Hugh heard it too: I
  could just see the outline of his face beside me peering ahead trying to
  locate it.</p>

  <p>For the third time it came: but on this occasion an unmistakable sound of
  splintering occurred in the middle, and one part of the problem was solved.
  Someone was sawing wood, and I almost laughed. If after all our elaborate
  precautions we were to find old man Spragge cutting up to-morrow's firewood
  the jest would be rather rich.</p>

  <p>As we drew nearer it was obvious that the sound came from the outhouse:
  saw, pause, saw, pause. And whoever it was who was producing it he certainly
  wasn't working overtime. The pauses grew longer, the noise shorter, and when
  at length we reached the wall of the building the sawing seemed to have
  ceased altogether. From inside came the occasional sound of a person moving
  about, and once some tool fell with a metallic clang on the floor.</p>

  <p>We were some two yards from the chink of light, and I could see that Hugh
  was looking keenly all round us. It was obvious what was worrying him, and I,
  too, searched the darkness intently. If we had seen the other watcher in the
  light from the door, he, in his turn, would be able to see us if we peered
  through. And that was the last thing we wanted. If he was a member of the
  household he would give the alarm: if he was one of the opposing side we
  should have given ourselves away completely. And so for five minutes we
  stared into the night, but without success. No trace could we see of him: he
  seemed to have vanished completely.</p>

  <p>At last came Hugh's whisper in my ear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We'll chance it, crouch low," and inch by inch he edged his way to the
  door. I followed close behind him on my hands and knees, with the youngster
  just on my heels. I could hear his excited breathing, and truth to tell I was
  getting well worked up myself. Were we going to see anything inside, or would
  it turn out to be a false alarm?</p>

  <p>Very gradually Hugh straightened himself up until he could see through the
  crack. For a moment or two he stared and I saw a look of amazement appear on
  his face. Then he went on and I took his place.</p>

  <p>The scene was an astounding one. The illumination came from half a dozen
  candles which stood on a rough carpenter's bench. A saw and some tools were
  scattered about, but it was the worker himself who fascinated me. He was
  sitting on an overturned box, and in the course of my life I have never seen
  a more bestial face. He was clean shaven save for a short moustache. His
  mouth was a little open as he worked, and the light shone on a row of yellow
  teeth, from which two were missing. His nose was flattened, and a great red
  scar ran down one cheek from the temple almost to the chin. His eyebrows were
  bushy, and once when he happened to glance up I saw his eyes glaring with a
  kind of animal ferocity. He paused in his work, too, at that moment and shook
  both his fists in the air as at some imaginary enemy. And his expression was
  that of a homicidal maniac.</p>

  <p>Never, in fact, unless I had seen it, would I have believed that any
  living thing, who bore the outward semblance of a man, could have presented
  such an utterly devilish appearance. He fascinated me, so that I stared and
  stared until Hugh nudged me in the ribs. And then only did I force myself to
  look away from him at the work he was doing.</p>

  <p>At first I couldn't make it out. He had beside him two or three slats of
  wood each about a foot long, two inches broad and an inch thick. There was an
  augur hole at each end of the slats, and through these holes he was passing
  two ropes. And then it suddenly dawned on me: the man was making a rope
  ladder. I looked on the floor at his feet, and saw the ends of the top ropes
  were attached to a canvas sack about the size and shape of a bolster. And at
  last I got it, but not before Hugh had pulled me forcibly away, and performed
  the same office on young Freckles, who had nearly given the whole show away
  by an audible gasp when he had looked in.</p>

  <p>"Damn it," muttered Hugh irritably, "you blokes might have been getting
  your money's worth at a peep-show in a circus."</p>

  <p>We were sitting on the ground some sixty yards away from the house, under
  cover of a hedge.</p>

  <p>"I saw all there was to see in two seconds," he went on. "And for the love
  of Pete don't forget we're not the only people here to-night."</p>

  <p>"What was that horror doing?" said Scott. "I've never seen such an awful
  looking specimen in my life."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Hugh hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well, young fellow," he said at length, "I fear that his present mission
  in life is fairly obvious. When you see a man making a rope ladder it is safe
  to assume he wants to climb something. And when you further see a big canvas
  sack at one end of the rope ladder, it is not difficult to spot what it is he
  wants to climb. That sack will just lie nicely between the spikes on
  Granger's wall, and will anchor the top of the ladder into the bargain. And
  when he gets to the top he can sit on the sack, throw the ladder down the
  inside of the wall, and there you are."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," stammered Freckles, "that that beast, that damned
  murderous swine, is going to get into Temple Tower? With Pat there? Not on
  your life, Drummond. If you won't go for him now, by God, I will!"</p>

  <p>He had scrambled to his feet, and I could hear his quick agitated
  breathing.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and shut up," said Hugh curtly. "I am not going for him now, and
  he'd eat you with one hand. Sit down, youngster," he went on kindly. "I guess
  it is a bit of a shock to you, but we've got to do a bit of thinking. No good
  has ever come yet of barging in like a bull in a china shop, and whatever may
  be that beauty's intentions in the future, he's perfectly safe where he is at
  present."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4"></a>IV. &mdash; IN WHICH THE NECESSITY FOR SPARKING PLUGS IS
     PROVED</h2>

  <p class="first">AND so for the next quarter of an hour we sat there
  discussing the thing in whispers. The feeling of incongruity, almost of the
  ridiculous, in three grown men prowling about Romney Marsh at night, which I
  at any rate had experienced, even if only slightly, had disappeared: we were
  face to face with reality, and pretty grim reality at that.</p>

  <p>That this horrible, bestial individual was preparing to get into Temple
  Tower was obvious. And that his reason for doing so was not to pay a polite
  call was equally obvious. That it had been Granger who was in his mind when
  he had paused in his task and shaken his great fists in the air I was sure.
  But beyond that there was still much that was obscure. We had learned
  something of vital importance it was true, but the one ray of light we
  possessed only seemed to make the surrounding darkness more impenetrable.</p>

  <p>Was this brute sitting in the outhouse the man we had heard snoring? Was
  he the man who had flashed the red and blue warning to the house on the hill?
  Whose was that other shadowy form that we had seen cross the light through
  the door? And most curious of all, what was the connection if any between
  this animal man and the Vandalis? Were they working in conjunction, or was
  the maker of rope ladders playing a lone hand?</p>

  <p>That his object was to get at Granger was, as I have said, clear. And as
  Hugh said, if Granger knew that this specimen was after him his precautions
  were comprehensible. But was it only his life they were after, or was there
  something concealed in Temple Tower that they wanted as well?</p>

  <p>"I give it up," said Hugh at length. "We don't know enough yet to say. But
  our evening has not been wasted: we've got another player taped all right.
  And as I don't think we can do more, I suggest home and hitting the hay. The
  only thing I wish is that we could spot that other bloke, but it is hopeless
  on a night like this."</p>

  <p>But we were destined to have one more glimpse of him. Even as we rose the
  door of the barn opened, and the ladder maker stood there framed in the
  light. We had only seen him sitting before; standing up he seemed more
  horrible than ever. He was a short man, but his arms were abnormally long,
  and he looked for all the world like a huge misshapen ape. Then he turned
  back, blew out the lights, and as he did so we crept nearer the house. It was
  just possible we might learn something, and the night was yet young.</p>

  <p>He opened the door and went in, and shortly afterwards a light shone
  through the curtains of one of the rooms facing the road. As luck would have
  it the window was open, and as we crept along the side of the house we heard
  voices.</p>

  <p>"It is cursed foolishness, I tell you," came in Spragge's snarling voice.
  "You've done it twice now, and it is bound to attract attention."</p>

  <p>"I agree with Spragge." It was Mrs. Spragge speaking. "Those two men this
  afternoon&mdash;what were they doing except trying to find things out?"</p>

  <p>And then I, at any rate, got the shock of my life. For the voice that
  answered them was soft and musical. It was as if one had suddenly discovered
  some priceless gem of beauty in a filthy pigsty. At first, in fact, I could
  hardly believe that it was the bestial monstrosity speaking.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mes amis</i>," he said gently, "it is for the last time. My ladder is
  nearly finished; soon, very soon the moment will come. It matters not to me
  what these two Englishmen suspect: maybe it is just idle curiosity on their
  part. It is no offence against your laws to flash a red light and then a blue
  across the Marsh. There is nothing here which all the world may not see. But
  those lights&mdash;they are seen by him. And he knows what they mean. And his
  soul is sick with terror because he knows that death is near. Moreover he
  knows"&mdash;and now the voice grew, if anything, more gentle and
  sweet&mdash;" that that death will not be quick. Not for him the swift bullet
  that shatters the brain. But a death of lingering agony&mdash;a death which
  makes him welcome death as a lover welcomes his mistress. My arms will be
  about him, and when I have torn him limb from limb my hands will squeeze the
  last fleeting breath from his body. Ah! yes&mdash;he knows. Once more shall
  he see the lights, to remind him that I am still here. And then we will go to
  bed."</p>

  <p>"You talk too much," grumbled Spragge. "And don't you forget, Mister, what
  you promised us after it was all over."</p>

  <p>"I shall not forget," said the other contemptuously. "Now turn out the
  light."</p>

  <p>Came a sudden darkness, and we crouched there enthralled. Had it been said
  blusteringly, had the voice been what one would have expected from such a
  being, half the effect would have been lost. But those soft melodious, gentle
  words carried with them an icy thrill, impossible to set down on paper. And
  whatever might have been Granger's crime in the past, I felt sorry for him if
  this man ever got hold of him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came a sharp hissing noise, and a bright red light shone
  out. And then things happened quickly. I had a brief glimpse of a man
  silhouetted in the light not twenty yards away: of the beast-faced ladder
  maker staring out above our heads, and then the light went out. He too had
  seen the man, and with a grunting cry he hurled himself through the open
  window and crashed past us so close that we could almost have touched him.
  For a while we heard him blundering round in the darkness, searching for the
  other watcher. The instant he had jumped past us Hugh, fearing that Spragge
  might join in the search, had risen and led the way round the house in the
  direction away from the front door.</p>

  <p>Which was just what did happen, and for some ten minutes, hidden behind a
  small tool shed we listened to the two men as they searched. But it was
  useless&mdash;the mysterious unknown had disappeared completely&mdash;and at
  length they gave it up and returned to the house.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't find an elephant on a night like this, let alone a man," came
  Spragge's growling voice. "It's your damned fault anyway, playing with those
  fool lights."</p>

  <p>"My friend," said the other, "the man was there anyway. The light merely
  discovered him."</p>

  <p>Probably that swine who was here this afternoon," said Spragge, and then
  their voices died away as they got round the corner of the house.</p>

  <p>The front door shut with a bang, and still we stayed on. Was anything
  further going to occur? Would the ladder maker still insist on flashing his
  signal across the Marsh, or would he follow Spragge's advice and give it up?
  Apparently it was to be the latter, for shortly after a light appeared in one
  of the upper windows. Then that, too, went out, and the house was in
  darkness. The charming trio had retired for the night.</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Hugh. "I think we've seen all we are likely to
  to-night."</p>

  <p>We skirted along by the footpath until we reached the dyke, and though it
  seemed to me that the need for precaution had gone, I noticed that Hugh still
  moved with the utmost caution. And it wasn't until we had put a good half
  mile between us and the farm that he relaxed his vigilance.</p>

  <p>There is an air of efficiency about this bunch," he remarked, "that
  behoves us to be careful. Spragge and his spouse are negligible: even the
  handsome bloke making ladders seems to have his intentions cut and dried. But
  it is the others."</p>

  <p>Do you think there were more than one there to-night?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," he answered. "There may have been half a dozen for all I
  know. On the other hand, the man who showed up in the light, and the man who
  crossed the outhouse door may be one and the same person. But one thing is
  cleared up anyway: he and that horrible brute are not working in
  collusion."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said Freckles, "that he is a detective who is after the
  other swine.</p>

  <p>"As you say, young fellow, it is possible," agreed Hugh. "The trouble is
  that there are the hell of a lot of things that seem to me to be possible.
  But one thing is quite definitely certain. We've got to get that girl of
  yours out of Temple Tower in the near future. She's not in any danger
  to-night&mdash;so there is no need to worry at the moment. But in view of the
  prospective caller, I think she will have to have a telegram recalling her to
  London."</p>

  <p>"I've never thought of such a specimen," said Freckles. "He made one
  positively sick to look at."</p>

  <p>"You noticed his slight accent, Peter," said Hugh. "And the way he
  started, <i>Mes amis</i>. The whole darned bunch are foreigners."</p>

  <p>"What I principally noticed was his voice," I said. "A voice like that
  from such a man is the most astounding thing I've ever known."</p>

  <p>We walked on briskly. Now that the thing was over for the night the
  thought of bed was becoming increasingly attractive, especially as our long
  spell without movement at the farm had made us all a bit chilly. The
  motor-boat loomed up as a welcome halfway landmark, and shortly after we left
  the dyke and struck off right-handed.</p>

  <p>"Sometime," said Hugh, "when we've got a spare moment, we might follow
  that dyke down to the sea. Though it seems pretty obvious that it must be
  clear. Also we might make a few discreet inquiries concerning the boat
  itself."</p>

  <p>At last the car hove in sight, and with a sigh of relief young Freckles
  fell into the back seat.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord no one has pinched that," he remarked sleepily. "Every
  garment I possess is full of sand, and&mdash;Good Lord! won't she start?"</p>

  <p>Most emphatically she wouldn't start: moreover the engine, when Hugh
  pressed the self-starter, was making the most peculiar noise.</p>

  <p>"What the devil has happened?" he said grimly. "Has she been tampered
  with?"</p>

  <p>He got down and opened the bonnet: then he gave a low whistle. He had
  flashed an electric torch on to the engine, and by its light, propped up
  inside, I saw a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>"This is no business of yours, Captain Drummond," he read out slowly.
  "There are quite enough people engaged in it already without you butting in.
  This is only a small warning and punishment for what you have done up to
  date: next time, if you should be so ill-advised as to let there be a next
  time, you will be hurt."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Hugh softly, and then he began to laugh. "Stung, you
  fellows, stung good and proper. We're either here for the night or we've got
  to walk."</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" demanded Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Our friendly correspondent, my lad," said Hugh, "in addition to embarking
  on a literary career has amused himself by removing all the sparking plugs.
  And cars have grave difficulty in running without sparking plugs."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got any spare ones?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;possibly two. But not six. Damn it&mdash;I'm not a walking
  garage."</p>

  <p>"Where is the nearest garage?" cried Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Rye," said Hugh laconically. "And even if we got there the chances of
  waking them up are remote."</p>

  <p>We looked at one another blankly&mdash;the significance of this new
  development was overshadowed for the moment by the physical annoyance of the
  thing. We were all tired, and here we were, four or five miles from anywhere,
  planted with an immovable motor-car.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's only one thing to be done," said Hugh at length. "One of us
  must go to Rye and throw bricks at the first garage until someone does appear
  on the scene. Let's toss: odd man out goes,"</p>

  <p>"It would be me," said Freckles resignedly, as we looked at the coins,
  "Well, chaps, when my bloodless body is found dead in a ditch, tell Mother
  that it wasn't the effect of alcohol."</p>

  <p>We watched him go off down the road, and Hugh grinned.</p>

  <p>"A good youngster," he said. "Very good ,"</p>

  <p>And then he grew thoughtful again, studying the paper he held in his hand.
  The words were printed in block capitals, so there was no handwriting clue to
  be obtained. The message was in pencil, evidently done on the spot, as the
  paper had been roughly torn out of a notebook,</p>

  <p>"Can you remember, Peter," he said at length, "whether we mentioned the
  fact that we were coming to Spragge's Farm to-night when we were in the
  Dolphin? I know we talked about it at dinner, and at my house, but on neither
  of those two occasions could we have been overheard."</p>

  <p>I cast my mind back.</p>

  <p>"I think we did," I answered. "I think it was mentioned when we were in
  that small room looking at that old map. But there were only the three of us
  there at the time."</p>

  <p>We might have been overheard from the hall," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"As far as I remember only the parson and those two elderly women were in
  the hall. Anyway what is the great idea?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," he admitted. "But what I was wondering was whether it was
  a pure fluke that this car was found here by whoever wrote that message? Or
  did the other side know we were coming?"</p>

  <p>I saw his point, but I could no more supply the answer than he could. As
  far as we knew we had not been overheard, but only as far as we knew.</p>

  <p>"It's becoming increasingly obvious," he went on, "that a considerable
  number of people are involved in this. That man we saw silhouetted in the
  light was neither Vandali nor the chauffeur. Of that fact I'm perfectly
  certain. He was too tall for the first, and too slight for the second.
  Further, I don't think that it can have been he who wrote this note, unless
  by some extraordinary chance he was actually lying up in these sand-hills
  when we arrived. Even then it takes time to remove six sparking plugs, and
  write a note. Yet he was at Spragge's Farm before us."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally, how did he know your name?" I said.</p>

  <p>"That's easy," he remarked. "It's written on a plate on the instrument
  board, even if he didn't know it before. But if my suspicions are right he
  did know it before, just as he knew our plans before. The key to this
  mystery, Peter, or at any rate one of them, lies in the Dolphin Inn. The
  little episode of the chimney-pot is all part and parcel of it."</p>

  <p>"But look here," I objected, "if that's the case: if they knew we were
  coming here why did that car go along the other road? Of course, it's
  possible that it wasn't their car at all, but some other people who had taken
  the wrong road."</p>

  <p>"And another thing is possible too," he said quietly. "That it was their
  car, and when they drew blank on the main road they knew we must have come
  along this one."</p>

  <p>"But that disposes of your own theory that they knew our plans," I
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Does it?" he said. "I don't agree. They knew part of our plan, but not
  all of it. They knew we were coming to Spragge's Farm, but they did not know
  we were coming by the sea route."</p>

  <p>"I don't see," I began densely.</p>

  <p>"Lord! man, it's plain," he cried. "If, that is to say, my supposition is
  correct, and the finding of the car was not a fluke. Where did we discuss
  approaching the Farm from the sea? In the dining-room, where we know we were
  not overheard. Where did we discuss the main idea of going to the Farm? In
  the little room."</p>

  <p>"Where," I interrupted, "we know with even greater certainty that we were
  not overheard. Confound it all, old boy, we three were alone in the room. The
  only people within range were the padre and those two old trouts knitting.
  You surely don't suspect one of them?"</p>

  <p>"Every man who wears a dog collar isn't of necessity a parson," he said
  obstinately.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway," I remarked, "it can't have been the cleric who bunged the
  chimney at your head, because he was in the hall the whole time."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right, Peter," he said, but it was quite obvious he didn't
  think so. However, he said no more, and after a while, I began to doze in the
  sand. I calculated that it would be daylight before Freckles could possibly
  be back, and sleep seemed better than an insoluble argument. In fact, the
  only thing that mattered as far as I was concerned was that, fluke or no
  fluke, the darned blighter had successfully kept me out of my bed.</p>

  <p>It was the sun's rays shining direct on my face that woke me. Hugh was
  still sitting beside me, and as I stirred he looked round.</p>

  <p>"I hope to heaven nothing has happened to that youngster," he said in a
  worried voice.</p>

  <p>I was wide awake in an instant: that possibility hadn't dawned on me up
  till then.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have gone myself," he went on. "He's but a baby. I'll never
  forgive myself if he's come to grief."</p>

  <p>He rose and stared down the road, and I joined him. Visibility was poor,
  as the ground mist had not yet lifted, and after a while he began to fidget
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I've got a good mind to go and look for him," he said. "It's three hours
  now since he started."</p>

  <p>"But surely," I said, "they wouldn't be such fools as to lay him out. They
  don't want to attract attention to themselves."</p>

  <p>"I don't think they are going to kill him and leave him in a ditch," he
  grunted. "But we're up against an absolutely unscrupulous bunch, Peter. And
  whoever removed our plugs must have known one of us would go for more. What
  easier than to lie up&mdash;then dot that boy one as he passed? Just to make
  him talk when he came to. He's loyal all right&mdash;but don't forget his
  girl is there. And that would tend to spoil his nerve."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Hugh," I said seriously, "we'll have to hand this thing over
  to the police. All joking apart, it's got a bit beyond our form. As you say
  yourself, that girl is inside Granger's house."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right, Peter," he said regretfully. "But it does seem
  cruel hard, doesn't it? The point about the whole thing though, is this. What
  are we going to say to the blighters? After all, as far as I can see, the
  only actual offence that has been committed as yet, is the removal of our
  plugs. And we don't know who did it. Making a rope ladder is a perfectly
  legitimate occupation: flashing red and blue lights is not a criminal
  offence. The person to go to the police, if anyone, is Granger himself. And
  he won't. It's not all as easy as it looks, you know."</p>

  <p>I was silent: what he said was undoubtedly true. Even if we showed them
  the note written by the unknown, our case was decidedly thin. More than
  likely they would regard it as a stupid practical joke, and in addition to
  that, view us with considerable suspicion for our share in the night's
  activities. At the same time one could not get away from the feeling of
  responsibility with regard to the girl, and I could see that Hugh was not too
  happy in his mind about it either.</p>

  <p>"It is this way as I see it, Peter," he went on after a while. "And
  honestly it is not because I want to keep this bit of fun and laughter to
  ourselves that I say it. If we tell the police what little we know about this
  show up to date our connection with it automatically stops. We pass out of
  the picture. Now the police are trammelled by all sorts of rules and
  regulations: in other words they are not free agents. They have to obtain
  warrants and things of that kind before they can move a step. Would it not
  therefore be better to keep matters in our own hands at any rate until we
  know a bit more? Then if we think it necessary, or if there seems to be the
  slightest danger threatening that girl we'll tell them all we know."</p>

  <p>"You darned old hypocrite," I laughed. "Have it your own way."</p>

  <p>And once again we fell silent, staring down the road. The mist was lifting
  gradually, though it was still impossible to see any distance.</p>

  <p>Out to sea was a tramp homeward bound, and the occasional wail of a siren
  showed that the fog was not confined to the land.</p>

  <p>And suddenly Hugh heaved a sigh of relief; a figure trudging wearily along
  had come in sight. It was Freckles with the parcel of plugs clutched in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Hell take it," he said as he came up. "I've had the most frightful time.
  An old woman in a nightcap bunged a bucket of water over me in one garage:
  thought I was tight or mad. No one could understand why I wanted six of the
  damned things. I've walked about eighteen miles."</p>

  <p>"Did you see anyone on the way, young fellow?" asked Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," grunted Freckles. "Except a tramp asleep in a ditch. Lucky
  devil&mdash;I very nearly joined him."</p>

  <p>He got into the car, and lay back wearily.</p>

  <p>"Home, John, home. I'm just about done in."</p>

  <p>"Right ho! my son," said Hugh. "You shall be between the sheets very soon
  now."</p>

  <p>He tightened up the last plug, and closed the bonnet.</p>

  <p>"Hop in, Peter," he cried. "Taking everything into consideration I'd
  sooner get past the coastguard station before they are all awake. What the
  dickens is that?"</p>

  <p>We had gone over a bump in the road, and an extraordinary metallic clang
  had come from behind the car. He got out, and I followed him. And when we got
  to the back of the car, for a moment or two neither of us spoke. There are
  times when the power of speech fails one.</p>

  <p>Hanging on to the luggage grid, attached by a short piece of string, were
  our six original sparking plugs. And in the middle of them was another small
  note.</p>

  <p>"Your plugs, I believe," read Hugh, and just then Freckles' face appeared
  over the hood.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" he spluttered.</p>

  <p>"Keep calm," said Hugh weakly. "Remember your aged mother."</p>

  <p>"You mean to tell me," remarked Freckles, in a choking voice, "that those
  plugs were there all the time?" He swallowed once or twice, and over the next
  minute I will draw a decent veil. Even Hugh listened in admiration to the
  flood of rhetoric that poured forth, and he is no mean artist in that line
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Laddie," he said gravely, when Freckles paused for breath, "I had no idea
  that such language was known to anyone under forty."</p>

  <p>"I would put him," said Freckles broodingly, as the car drew up at the
  house, "on a hard concrete surface. And then I would cover him all over with
  sparking plugs. And then having pegged him down I would take a roller of
  medium weight, and passage it backwards and forwards over his vile body,
  pausing occasionally to jump on his stomach with hobnailed boots.
  Yea&mdash;thus and more would I do to that offspring of Beelzebub. And if any
  sparking plugs were over I would ram them down his mouth with a
  sledge-hammer."</p>

  <p>"Run away to bed," laughed Hugh and Freckles departed muttering horribly.
  And not until his door had closed did Hugh grow serious again. He wanted less
  sleep than any man I've ever known, and my immediate need of it had been met
  by the two hours I had had in the sand dunes. And now as we stood by the
  dining-room window staring over the Marsh I could see his brain was busy once
  more.</p>

  <p>"What was the idea, Peter, of that little jest?" he said at length. He was
  holding the note in his hand as he spoke. "Was it in reality what he says
  here&mdash;a small warning and punishment?"</p>

  <p>"Why should you think otherwise?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"This morning," he said, in an unusually quiet and serious tone of voice
  for him, "I had a very queer sensation. I got it first of all when you were
  asleep. I suddenly became convinced that there was someone else there. I saw
  no one: I heard no sound. Nevertheless the feeling was strong on me that we
  were not alone: that somebody else was watching us. In those sand dunes, of
  course, you could hide a battalion of infantry. Footmarks disappear as soon
  as they are made. It was hopeless to try and explore, but for all that I
  believe there was someone there."</p>

  <p>"And if there was," I said, "what do you deduce from it? "</p>

  <p>"That the object of the plug episode was a little deeper than appears on
  the surface: that there was more in it than to make us temporarily annoyed
  and inconvenienced. Mark you&mdash;I don't know. It is all surmise on my
  part, and surmise moreover based on what may be a false start. There may have
  been no one there at all. But if there was then I think that the main object
  of the thing was to enable the watcher to take stock of us considerably more
  closely than any of the opposing side have been able to up to date."</p>

  <p>"Assuming for the moment that you are right," I said, "have you any theory
  as to who the watcher was?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None at all. I've got no theories on the thing at all. But one thing I do
  know, though you will probably call me every kind of an ass for saying so. I
  feel it instinctively. There is someone in this show who is infinitely more
  dangerous than that specimen making the rope ladder, or than the Vandalis. I
  sense his influence behind them. Whether he is the leader or not, or whether
  he is quite separate I can't tell you&mdash;but he's there. Further, I
  believe that it was he who first of all tried to out me with the chimney-pot,
  and having failed there decided on other measures and lay up this morning to
  study us."</p>

  <p>"The man we saw at Spragge's Farm," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Possibly: possibly not. Time will show. But the solution lies at present
  in the Dolphin, and when you turn in I'm going to see what there is to be
  seen there. Probably nothing, but there's no harm in having a try."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," I said, but he refused to allow me to.</p>

  <p>"I can do without sleep," he remarked, "and you can't. Go and turn in, old
  boy, and I'll have a bit of shut-eye this afternoon."</p>

  <p>I went up to my room and slowly undressed. In front of me lay the Marsh,
  bathed in the early morning sunshine. The mist had quite gone: only a haze
  over the sea still remained. For a while I stood by the open window staring
  at Spragge's Farm, but there was no sign of life. Then with a feeling that
  the whole thing was an unreal dream I got into bed. And the next thing I knew
  was the sound of Hugh's voice.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, Peter. It is half-past twelve. Time for a spot of lunch."</p>

  <p>"Did you find out anything?" I said as I scrambled out of bed.</p>

  <p>"Not very much," he answered. "I went over the list of visitors, but got
  no farther. There is, however, one thing I noticed that gives one to think a
  little. The Vandalis' room is Number 18. Now Number 18 is on the first floor.
  It stands at the corner of the passage, and is directly above the little room
  leading off the hall. Do you see the significance?"</p>

  <p>"Not at the moment," I said. "We weren't talking loud enough to be
  overheard through the ceiling. Besides Vandali was in the room."</p>

  <p>"But the lady was not," he retorted. "Think again, Peter. Number 18
  undoubtedly possesses a fireplace, though I haven't been into it to see. The
  flue of that fireplace must lead into the main one which communicates with
  the huge chimney in the room below&mdash;a chimney which would act as a
  glorified megaphone. It is a point anyway to bear in mind."</p>

  <p>He left me to finish dressing, and ponder over this fresh development. It
  undoubtedly was a point to bear in mind; and if he was correct it accounted
  for a great deal. More than likely words spoken in the little room below,
  even in a low tone, would be heard perfectly distinctly by anyone
  listening-in just above the chimney.</p>

  <p>"John is coming to lunch," he said as I joined him below. "Moreover, he is
  bringing the plan of Temple Tower. And that is another point, Peter, which is
  going to have a bearing on the situation. The possession of that plan is a
  very big asset in our favour. For without it, as far as I can see, no one is
  going to get inside the house. Our friend of the Marshes may get inside the
  grounds, but there he will stick."</p>

  <p>He swung round as a car pulled up at the door.</p>

  <p>"Here he is. Morning, John. Got the necessary?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," said the other coming into the hall. "Look here, Hugh, you
  didn't play a damn fool practical joke on me last night, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I'm aware of," he answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"You remember that plan I was telling you about&mdash;the one of Temple
  Tower?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Hugh, sitting up suddenly. "You were going to bring it over
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"I know I was. And I haven't, for a very good reason. Someone broke into
  Laidley Towers last night, and stole it."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5"></a>V. &mdash; IN WHICH WE COME TO THE WOOD AT TEMPLE
     TOWER</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a while we stared at him in silence, and at that moment
  Freckles came down and joined us.</p>

  <p>"You're certain, John," said Hugh at length, "that it isn't hidden away in
  a drawer somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm certain, old man," answered the other. "The darned thing
  was framed, and it used to hang in a corner of the hall. When I went to get
  it this morning it wasn't there. I sent for the butler, and he swore on his
  Bible oath that it was there yesterday. Besides, there is more to it than
  that. It appeared that when we were at dinner last night, a man called to see
  me. One of the footmen answered the door, and told him that I had a party.
  The man looked all right apparently, and when he said that he would wait and
  that I was not to be disturbed on any account, the footman showed him into a
  room off the hall. Then the darned fool forgot all about him for some time.
  As soon as he remembered he went back to the room, and found that the bird
  had gone. He made a hurried survey, and when, as far as he could see, nothing
  was missing, he decided that his best policy was to say nothing about it. Of
  course when I found out what had happened, I gave him hell. He was very
  contrite about it: assured me again and again that the man had looked like a
  gentleman: that he had driven up in a car and all that. But when it came to
  describing him to me it was hopeless. He gave a description that would fit a
  hundred people. And all he could really say was that he would know him again
  if he saw him."</p>

  <p>"It just bears out what we were saying, Peter, said Hugh thoughtfully.
  "Where were we discussing the plan? Why, in the little room again. And we
  were overheard there. It stands to reason. An old plan of Temple Tower is of
  no earthly value to anybody, unless they are connected with this business. A
  pony to a tanner it is the woman. By the way, John, I suppose it wasn't our
  bearded friend who visited you?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless he'd shaved off his beard. Even my mutton-headed poop would
  have noticed that amount of face fungus. But there is one rather important
  point, which I forgot to tell you yesterday. The plan was framed, and on the
  back of it is some writing. And that writing gives the clue to the secret
  entrance. The plan, of course, shows where it is approximately, but without
  the writing at the back you can't get in."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't any idea what is written there?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not the remotest. Dash it, old boy! I was only about eleven years old at
  the time."</p>

  <p>"As you say, John, that is very important," said Hugh. "Because what it
  boils down to as far as I can see is that unless the bloke that pinched it
  takes it out of the frame it is useless to him."</p>

  <p>"That's about the long and the short of it," agreed the other</p>

  <p>"Gosh! You fellows," cried Hugh, "I'd give something to see a little
  daylight in this. Anyway, let's go and gnaw a bone."</p>

  <p>And all through lunch we argued it backwards and forwards. Was it the man
  we had seen at Spragge's Farm who had stolen the plan, or was it, perhaps,
  Jean Picot the chauffeur?</p>

  <p>"That's a point, John," said Hugh. "Go and ring up your place and find out
  if the footman can say what sort of a car it was the man came in. See if he
  remembers the colour: that might help."</p>

  <p>But again we drew blank. The car had not been left at the front door, and
  the man had no idea on the subject.</p>

  <p>"The more I see of it, Scott," said Hugh as we finished lunch, "the more
  do I think that the first real daylight we shall get is from Miss Verney. I
  want you and Peter to be there from two to three this afternoon, in case she
  gets a note over the wall. I'm going to turn in for a couple of hours, and
  then this evening our work really begins."</p>

  <p>"The Marsh again?" asked Freckles.</p>

  <p>"No, young fellow&mdash;Temple Tower," said Hugh gravely. "If anybody gets
  inside that wall we're going to follow."</p>

  <p>And so two o'clock found Freckles and me ensconced in the little wood
  which lay opposite the front gate. Hugh had turned in: John James had
  returned to Laidley Towers with the definite intention of getting some kit
  and then coming back to the house. As he pointed out, it was his plan, and if
  there was any fun and laughter going begging, he was going to have a dip at
  it.</p>

  <p>Not unnaturally, the boy was a bit on edge, and I certainly didn't blame
  him. All that we could see of the house was the tower: the rest of it was
  hidden by the wall. And in the hot, drowsy afternoon the whole place looked
  more like a prison than ever. Even to me it was so gloomy as to be
  depressing, and I hadn't got my fiancee inside.</p>

  <p>We hardly talked at all, and when we did for some reason or other, we
  found ourselves whispering. Save for the drone of countless insects, the
  silence was absolute: even the birds seemed stricken dumb. Once a farm waggon
  creaked slowly by, the driver half asleep: but except for that the road was
  deserted. And after a while Freckles began to doze.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have followed his example, because I distinctly remember
  that I had a brief vivid dream of the beast-faced man at Spragge's Farm. And
  then, quite suddenly, I was wide awake. Something had moved not far away, and
  the sound had roused me. I sat up and glanced at my watch: it was a quarter
  to three. I looked at Freckles: he was sleeping peacefully. Then I stared
  round me: what was the noise I had heard?</p>

  <p>The undergrowth was dense: I could see nothing. But that noise which had
  sounded like the cracking of a twig must have been caused by something. Or
  somebody. And then&mdash;I cannot explain it&mdash;I began to be aware of a
  peculiar sensation, a sensation I had never experienced before. Someone was
  watching me; I knew it.</p>

  <p>Once again I stared all round me; once again I saw nothing save the
  brambles and trees. But the feeling grew on me, till it amounted to a
  certainty. I was being watched. Back to my mind came Hugh's words of that
  morning: he, too, had felt the same sensation in the sand dunes. And after a
  while I could stand it no longer: I got up. Still no sound: still no sign,
  but the feeling remained. The silent watcher was still there. I took a few
  steps forward, and there came the sudden crack of another twig. And now I
  knew I was right: we were not alone in the wood.</p>

  <p>Absurd I know, and I am almost ashamed to admit it, but for some reason or
  other the most unreasoning panic began to get hold of me. And only by taking
  a firm pull at myself did I remain where I was. In the middle of a summer's
  afternoon, for a grown man to be frightened in an English wood was utterly
  ridiculous, and yet the plain fact remained that I was. The noise had seemed
  to come from the direction in which I was facing, and acting on a sudden
  impulse I plunged into the undergrowth. There was nothing&mdash;nothing at
  all. A bird startled by the noise flew away chattering angrily, but of anyone
  human there was no sign. I took a few more steps, peering in every direction,
  with the same result. And then, suddenly, I heard Freckles calling me, and
  his voice was urgent.</p>

  <p>"Darrell! Darrell! Where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Here I am," I answered. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>I found him sitting up, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"I must have been dreaming," he said slowly. "And yet I could have sworn I
  was awake."</p>

  <p>"What did you think you saw?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a most extraordinary thing," he said, "but I thought I saw a black
  figure through those bushes over there. It was all black, standing between
  those two trees. Just at first I thought it was you, until it moved: then I
  saw it wasn't. And then it suddenly vanished."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look," I said: and together we walked over to the two
  trees. But there was no one there, and though we stood listening intently we
  heard no further sound. The wood had relapsed into its drowsy silence once
  more.</p>

  <p>"A trick of the light most probably," he said. "Some shadow or other."</p>

  <p>"Shadows don't come and go," I answered. "As a matter of fact for the last
  five minutes I've had the impression that we were being watched."</p>

  <p>"But, damn it," he cried, "if there really was someone there, what was he
  doing in that extraordinary rig. He was absolutely black, and a most peculiar
  shape."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by a peculiar shape?" I said.</p>

  <p>"I'm blowed if I know what I do mean," he answered, scratching his head.
  "But he didn't look normal."</p>

  <p>"When you say black," I persisted, "do you mean he was a nigger?"</p>

  <p>"No; he didn't seem to have a face at all. He was just a black outline."
  He gave an irritable laugh. "Confound it, Darrell, I'm not tight. And I know
  I was awake. What the deuce is in this wood?"</p>

  <p>"It's a bit too big a proposition to explore at the moment," I said. "I
  think we'd better return to our observation post; we don't want to miss the
  letter if it comes."</p>

  <p>We went back to our original position and lay down again. And for the next
  ten minutes while we waited I have no hesitation in admitting that I
  frequently found myself looking over my shoulder into the shadows behind us.
  What was this mysterious being that I had heard, and Freckles had seen?</p>

  <p>After a while I glanced at my watch: it was ten minutes past three. And I
  was on the point of suggesting that we should give it up, when something
  skimmed over the wall and fell in the road, not two yards from where we were
  lying. It was the letter, and it had hardly reached the ground before
  Freckles had it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Pat," he called out in a low voice. "Pat."</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" I just heard her answer from the other side.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite. Look here, Tom...."</p>

  <p>But whatever she was going to say we missed, because at that moment
  Freckles glanced up the road. He let out an urgent "Shut up," and bolted back
  under cover beside me.</p>

  <p>"The Vandalis," he muttered, and even as he spoke I heard the roar of
  their car in the distance. It drew up almost in front of us, but fortunately
  in such a position that we could see the gate. The woman was driving, and we
  wormed our way a little further forward in order to see better. The whole
  thing was evidently cut and dried beforehand, and a direct frontal assault
  was the plan. Vandali got out of the car, looking even more overdressed than
  he had in the Dolphin, walked over to the bell and rang it. Then he lit a
  cigarette, and coming back to the car, stood leaning against it and talking
  to the girl. Once I thought he must have seen us, because he stared perfectly
  straight at me, and seemed to pause for an instant in his conversation. But
  he gave no further sign, and a few moments later, the hole in the gate was
  opened and Gaspard looked out.</p>

  <p>Vandali turned round, and for a while he and the girl stared at him in
  silence. Then Vandali spoke.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Granger at home?"</p>

  <p>"That's as may be," retorted the other. "Who are you, and what do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"My name doesn't matter. But I wish to see your master."</p>

  <p>"Well, he don't wish to see you, nor anyone else."</p>

  <p>He made as if to shut the hole in the gate, but Vandali stepped
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, my friend," he said. "You know who is down there on the
  Marsh, don't you:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you are talking about," said Gaspard hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Don't lie: it is foolish," said Vandali. "You know that you are found at
  last&mdash;or rather your master is. And you know what that means."</p>

  <p>Gaspard moistened his dry lips with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Tell me who you are!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"As I said before," answered Vandali, "it doesn't matter who I am. But go
  and tell your master that someone who knows everything is outside and wishes
  to speak to him. And tell him further that he need have no fear."</p>

  <p>For a while the man hesitated: then he slammed and bolted the panel of the
  opening and we heard his steps departing up the drive.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Vandali thoughtfully to the girl, "if it will work the
  trick. We hit the mark all right over Marillard. Still it is only
  guess-work."</p>

  <p>"Guess-work that is a certainty," she answered impatiently. "My dear Paul,
  look at the house, look at the precautions he has taken against anyone
  getting in. Of course it is the man."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are right," he agreed. "Anyway, we can but try the
  bluff."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and stood leaning against the car.</p>

  <p>"And if the bluff doesn't succeed?" she remarked, "what then?"</p>

  <p>"I see nothing for it," he said, "but the police."</p>

  <p>The panel suddenly opened again, and he swung round. And framed for a
  moment in the hole in the gate was an unpleasant shifty-eyed face. The owner
  himself , I decided, and evidently Vandali had come to the same
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granger, I believe," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>But if he expected any further conversation he was doomed to
  disappointment, A querulous voice said: " I don't know you: go away," and
  then the panel slammed to again.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," called out Vandali. "I know you don't know me, but I know
  you."</p>

  <p>"Go away," shrieked the voice from the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, you fool," snarled Vandali, losing his temper, "or it will
  be the worse for you. Unless you consent to see me, and discuss things, I
  will put the police on to you."</p>

  <p>A peal of cackling laughter was the only reply, and I saw the girl put her
  hand on Vandali 's arm and whisper something.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Granger," he said more calmly, "we'll give you a day to
  think it over in. To-morrow at about this time we will return. And then I
  advise you, for your own sake, to see me."</p>

  <p>But there was no reply, and after a time, with a shrug of his shoulders,
  Vandali got back into the car. And the girl was just leaning forward to press
  the starter, when a noise like a young explosion occurred at my elbow. As I
  pointed out to Freckles afterwards, he might have controlled himself for
  another half second, but he merely retorted that half a second can be longer
  than an eternity if a fly goes up your nose. Anyway, the bald fact remains
  that the uproar of Freckles' sneeze literally shook the countryside. And the
  girl drew back from the self-starter, and then they both stared straight at
  us.</p>

  <p>"Botanising?" said Vandali quietly.</p>

  <p>"No. Only studying the habits of the lesser carnivora," burbled Freckles.
  "I say, laddie, he didn't seem to like your face, did he?"</p>

  <p>Vandali got out of the car, and slowly crossed the road.</p>

  <p>"Spying, I see," he remarked curtly.</p>

  <p>Freckles grinned amiably and sat up.</p>

  <p>"Blessed if it isn't my old friend from the Dolphin," he said. "And what
  are we doing in the fragrant countryside this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you are doing lying concealed here?" said Vandali
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Tush! Tush!" said Freckles, "and likewise pish, pish! I must buy you a
  little brochure on Manners for Men with Beards. Can you advance any reason
  why I and my dear old friend Abraham de Vere Potbelly should not lie in the
  verdant hay, studying the beauties of nature?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, my young friend," said Vandali quietly," I would strongly
  advise you not to play the fool with me."</p>

  <p>"God forbid, my dear old lad of the village," cried Freckles earnestly,
  "that I should ever play anything with you. I should hate to. I don't think
  you'd make at all a suitable companion for me. In fact I know my aged mother
  would object most strongly. 'Percy,' she would say, 'have nothing to do with
  that rude man. Give him the raspberry at once.'"</p>

  <p>The veins were beginning to stand out on Vandali's forehead, but he
  managed to control himself, and turned to me.</p>

  <p>"Since this boy seems partially insane," he said, "might I ask you to be
  good enough to tell me what the great idea is?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil has it got to do with you?" I said curtly. "As far as I
  know we have as much right to lie in this wood, as you have to drive your car
  along the road."</p>

  <p>"I see," he answered slowly. "Well, I hope you have profited by your
  eavesdropping."</p>

  <p>"Immensely, thanks," said Freckles. "And now don't let us keep you any
  more. I would fain resume my studies of nature."</p>

  <p>"Come along, Paul," cried the girl imperiously. "You are only wasting
  time."</p>

  <p>"Madame," said Freckles tragically, "you wound me to the very core.
  Surely, surely, to engage in playful badinage with one of my engaging
  countenance cannot be regarded as wasting time. But I do wish you'd get him
  to cut the grouse moor on his face. That's given him the once-once," he
  continued with a grin as the car drove off. "But there is no doubt, laddie,
  that the girl is a decided pippin."</p>

  <p>"I wish you could have controlled your nose," I said irritably. "Damn it!
  People in Rye must have heard you."</p>

  <p>"It was a bit of a break," he admitted. "Still I do not see that it has
  done much harm. We've had a pleasant little chat, and I suggest that we now
  ooze back to the house, and read Pat's letter."</p>

  <p>There certainly seemed to be no object in staying where we were, and I was
  on the point of agreeing, when suddenly the panel in the gate was cautiously
  opened, and Granger again looked out. We were standing in the middle of the
  road, so it was useless to try and conceal ourselves. He stared at us with
  utmost hostility, but Freckles, completely unperturbed, seized the
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Good-afternoon," he cried cheerily. "Do you mind telling Miss Verney that
  I am here. Scott is my name."</p>

  <p>"Are you friends of Captain Drummond?" answered Granger, with a look of
  relief replacing the anger.</p>

  <p>And then there occurred the most extraordinary thing. Granger's expression
  changed suddenly. And it changed so suddenly that we could do nothing but
  stare at him blankly. His jaw dropped, and a look of terror appeared on his
  face, such as I have never seen before or since. For perhaps a second he
  stood there: then the panel clanged to.</p>

  <p>What the devil is the matter with the man?" stammered Freckles.</p>

  <p>"It was not us," I muttered. "He wasn't looking at us."</p>

  <p>We swung round quickly, and peered into the wood, the same thought in both
  our minds. And this time I, too, saw it&mdash;a great black shape that seemed
  to flit between the trees until it vanished. For a moment or two we stood
  there undecided, then we pulled ourselves together and gave chase. But it was
  hopeless. Once I thought I saw it in the distance between two trees, but when
  we got there, there was nothing. And after a while we gave it up and returned
  to the road mopping our foreheads.</p>

  <p>"So it wasn't my imagination after all," said Freckles. "What is it,
  Darrell?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," I answered. "But whatever it is it put the fear of God
  into our friend Granger. I've never seen a man look more terrified in my
  life.".</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it is that swine from Spragge's Farm masquerading about in
  disguise," he said as we strolled back to the house. "What defeats me is that
  it seemed such a rum shape." He stopped, struck with a sudden thought. "I
  suppose it is human, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, man!" I cried irritably, "there are enough complications in
  this affair already without introducing a bally ghost. Besides, ghosts do not
  step on twigs and break them."</p>

  <p>"That is so," he admitted. "But it really was the most extraordinary
  object. It didn't seem to have a face."</p>

  <p>We walked on in silence until we reached the house. Up to date every
  single hour seemed to have produced a new development, and I fully expected
  to find that something more had happened in our absence. But in that I proved
  to be wrong. Hugh was taking his ease in a long chair on the veranda, and
  assured us that nothing had disturbed his siesta. He hoped that we were not
  as hot as we looked, whereat we cursed him for a lousy knave, and demanded
  beer in tankards. But all his air of laziness vanished when we began to tell
  him what had happened.</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely certain about this peculiar thing you saw in the
  wood?" he said. "But, of course, you must be. You couldn't both have imagined
  it. Very strange: very strange indeed."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if you are not right, Scott," he went on, "and it
  is not our friend from Spragge's Farm."</p>

  <p>"Whose name would seem, from what Vandali said, to be Marillard," I put
  in. "But my impression of the thing we saw in the wood was that it was
  considerably taller."</p>

  <p>"Anyway," said Hugh, "whether it is him or not, we've arrived at two
  definite conclusions. Granger is frightened of it, and he is not frightened
  of the Vandalis. Therefore it would seem that it and Vandalis are working
  separately. Am I right or wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," grunted Freckles. "The whole thing at the present moment
  is completely above my form. But there is one point that sticks out a bit,
  and that is the fact that the Vandalis know about Marillard, and that Granger
  is frightened of him. So that if the 'it' is Marillard, even though they may
  be working separately, the Vandalis are using him as a weapon for their own
  ends."</p>

  <p>"Life is certainly a trifle complicated," murmured Hugh. "However, let us
  hear what your perfectly good girl has to say on the matter."</p>

  <p>Great Scott! She has written a three volume novel," said Freckles as he
  opened the letter. "Er&mdash;and the first paragraph, chaps, does not seem to
  bear directly on the subject."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said Hugh gravely. "The first paragraph may therefore
  be omitted."</p>

  <p>"It certainly will be," laughed the other. "Here is where she really gets
  going."</p>

  <p>He settled himself comfortably in his chair.</p>

  <p>"This is the most amazing household," he began. "I'll start at the
  beginning and try not leave out anything. The first excitement occurred the
  instant the gate was shut&mdash;and you heard it. The dog, I mean, if such an
  animal can be called a dog. It is the size of a calf, and I suppose it saw a
  stranger. Instantly it hurled itself against the bars of its cage,
  roaring&mdash; there is no other word for it&mdash;with rage. Its eyes were
  red, its great fangs were showing, and the front of the cage shook so much
  that I feared it might give way.</p>

  <p>"'What an awful brute,' I said to the man who had opened the gate. His
  name is Gaspard, and he and the dog are a pretty pair.</p>

  <p>You're right,' he said. 'And he runs loose at night. Don't forget
  that.'</p>

  <p>"He flung open the front door, and then I really thought for a moment or
  two I had come to a madhouse. A nasty-looking little man, who subsequently
  turned out to be my employer, was coming downstairs as I stepped into the
  hall. The instant he saw me he started shouting, 'Who's that woman? Who's
  that woman?' at the top of his voice. I stood there wondering whether to
  laugh or be angry, while the servant man said something to him which seemed
  to reassure him. At any rate, he came shambling forward, and muttered some
  sort of an apology.</p>

  <p>You must excuse me, my dear young lady,' he said, 'but I am a great
  recluse. My nerves are not all they might be.'</p>

  <p>"'So I see,' I answered. 'I presume you are expecting me.'</p>

  <p>"'Of course, of course,' he muttered. 'Just for the moment I had forgotten
  you were coming&mdash;that is all. Let me see&mdash;you come from Miss
  Mudge's bureau, don't you? Now you would like to see your room, I'm sure.
  Gaspard&mdash; tell your wife to show this young lady to her room. And then
  later we will go into your duties. Tell me, as you came in, did you see
  anyone outside in the road?'</p>

  <p>"'I came with my fianc&eacute;,' I said. 'And there were two gentlemen who told
  us which the house was.'</p>

  <p>"I could hardly get the sentence out before he was shouting for
  Gaspard.</p>

  <p>"'Did you see the men?' he stuttered. 'The two men outside?'</p>

  <p>"'Only Drummond and a friend of his,' said Gaspard.</p>

  <p>"'Who was the friend?' he cried.</p>

  <p>"'If you want to know,' I said coldly, 'his name was Darrell.'</p>

  <p>"He stared at me suspiciously, and I suppose he noticed I was looking a
  bit surprised. Anyway, he made an attempt to pull himself together.</p>

  <p>"'I don't encourage strangers. Miss...'</p>

  <p>"I told him my name.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! yes, of course. I remember now. No, Miss Verney, I don't encourage
  strangers. As I told you, I am a recluse, and I keep myself to myself.'</p>

  <p>"I forbore to make the obvious retort that no one was likely to object,
  and he went rambling on, evidently trying to put me at my ease. And then at
  last the woman arrived, and I escaped upstairs.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Granger seems in a very nervous condition,' I said to her.</p>

  <p>"She was a furtive-eyed creature and very uncommunicative.</p>

  <p>"'So would you be if you never stirred outside the house,' she muttered
  morosely. 'Here's your room.'</p>

  <p>"She flung open a door, and walked in in front of me. And then Gaspard
  brought in my box, and the pair of them went out and left me alone. The room
  was quite comfortable, though the furniture was very plain. And like every
  other room in the house, there were steel bars over the window.</p>

  <p>"I got unpacked, and shortly afterwards the woman brought me some tea.</p>

  <p>"'When you've finished, ring the bell and I'll take you to Granger,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>"I noticed the omission of the 'mister,' but said nothing. As a matter of
  fact, it only confirmed what I'd thought ever since I got into the house,
  that they were all of much the same class. However, I finished my tea and
  went off to interview the gentleman. His room is at the top of the house, and
  is, if possible, more heavily barricaded than the rest. The door is about
  three inches thick, and you can hardly see out of the window for bars. He was
  sitting at his desk when I came in, and I took a pew opposite, from which I
  could study him more fully than I'd been able to up to date. He is the most
  terrible little man, Tom: perfectly frightful. He is like some kind of insect
  with a rash on it, and but for the fifty quid I think I should have left then
  and there.</p>

  <p>However, he started explaining what he wanted me to do. And after a time I
  had to stop him: he was so incoherent and rambling that I could not make head
  or tail of what he was saying. In addition to which he kept popping up to
  have a look out of the window, until I could have shied the inkpot at his
  head.</p>

  <p>"'You must forgive me, Miss Verney,' he said several times, 'but I have
  had a great shock just lately.'</p>

  <p>"I said nothing, of course, but presumably he was alluding to the signals
  Captain Drummond was talking about. And quite obviously the man is in a
  pitiful condition of nerves. However, to get back to the point. After he had
  hummed and hawed for some time, and told me that he would want me to write
  letters and that sort of thing for him, he suddenly asked me if I knew
  anything about jewellery and precious stones. I said I knew very little.</p>

  <p>"'I have one or two beautiful bits of stuff,' he rambled on. 'I have been
  an ardent collector for years.'</p>

  <p>"Which, of course, was very nice, but what it had to do with my duties as
  his secretary was a little obscure. So I brought him back to the point.</p>

  <p>"'I should like to know, Mr. Granger,' I said, 'what will be the
  arrangement over going out. There seemed to be a great deal of difficulty
  over getting in: I hope it won't apply to getting out.'</p>

  <p>"'That we will arrange,' he cried. 'Just at present it would be better, I
  think, for you to take your walk in the grounds. There are reasons, important
  reasons. But one thing, as you value your life, you must not forget&mdash;do
  not go out after dusk.'</p>

  <p>"'You mean the dog?' I said.</p>

  <p>"'Yes&mdash;and other things, too. Soon I hope the danger will be over,
  but for the next few days do not forget my warning.'</p>

  <p>"And then I could not help it: I just had to ask him:</p>

  <p>"'Why have you got your house barricaded like a prison?' I said.</p>

  <p>"'I have an enemy,' he answered; 'an unscrupulous enemy. He believes I did
  him a wrong&mdash;years ago. As if one could do such as he a wrong. But I'll
  beat him, I'll beat him.'</p>

  <p>"He was literally jibbering in his excitement, and for some time I thought
  he was going to have a fit. Then the upheaval passed.</p>

  <p>"'A vile criminal, Miss Verney: a man debased beyond words.'</p>

  <p>"Bearing in mind the speaker, I thought that a bit rich.</p>

  <p>Do not be alarmed,' he continued, 'if you hear things at night, out in the
  grounds. You will be quite safe. Well, well, we will finish our talk
  to-morrow. A letter or two, and your outings. We must discuss them: we must
  certainly discuss them.'</p>

  <p>"And with that I left him. Honestly I do not think the man is quite all
  there, and as for his remarks about the criminal outside, the man is as
  crooked as a corkscrew himself. However, it is past eleven now, and I am
  going to bed. My dinner was sent up to my room, and I have not seen Mr.
  Granger again. But an hour ago I heard the most frightful quarrel going on
  between him and Gaspard, and it sounded to me as if Gaspard was drunk.
  Anyway, I have locked my door, though, to give the devil his due, neither of
  them has given me any trouble at all. Good-night: I'll finish this effusion
  to-morrow, though whether I will ever get it to you or not remains to be
  seen."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6"></a>VI. &mdash; IN WHICH WE COME TO TEMPLE TOWER</h2>

  <p class="first">BY Gosh! the old thing has spread herself," said Freckles.
  "There is a further vast instalment." "Get on with it," cried Hugh. "It
  strikes me Miss Verney has her head screwed on in exactly the right way."</p>

  <p>"She is not too dusty," conceded her fianc&eacute; graciously. "Now this whack of
  stuff is headed Mid-day."</p>

  <p>"Had a perfectly good night," she begins, "though I woke up once with that
  beastly dog baying at something outside. However, I soon fell asleep again,
  and did not wake till after eight. All of which matters not: I'll get on with
  it. I received his majesty's command to wait on him at ten o'clock. Now you
  know my watch has never been quite itself again since it fell in the river at
  Henley, and sure enough it had apparently gained about twenty minutes this
  morning. The result was that little Patricia, with pencil and paper complete,
  fresh and radiant in the morning sunshine, popped into the sacred room at
  twenty to ten instead of ten. Not, you would have thought, a very frightful
  crime, but you should have seen the result. His lordship was kneeling by the
  side of the fireplace, holding something in his hand. As soon as he heard the
  door open he thrust whatever it was back into a recess, which he closed. Then
  he scrambled to his feet in a fury.</p>

  <p>"'I said ten,' he stormed.</p>

  <p>"'I thought it was ten,' I remarked amiably. 'My watch must have
  gained.'</p>

  <p>"Then I sat down with paper and pencil, and waited for him to start. After
  a bit he calmed down and took a seat at his desk.</p>

  <p>"'You must make allowances for me, Miss Verney,' he mumbled. 'My health is
  not very good.'</p>

  <p>"'That's all right,' I said. 'It was my fault for coming too soon.'</p>

  <p>"And once more I waited for him to begin. At last he got under way, and
  dictated three short letters&mdash;all of them business, and all of them
  trivial to a degree. Then he stopped.</p>

  <p>"'Is that all?' I said.</p>

  <p>"'All for this morning,' he answered. 'As a matter of fact. Miss Verney,
  my correspondence is very small. Being the recluse I am, I know but few
  people.'</p>

  <p>"'If this is a fair sample of a day's job,' I remarked, 'I shall certainly
  not be overworked. I will go and type these now, and bring them to you to
  sign.'</p>

  <p>"I got up and went to the door and just as I was opening it I heard him
  muttering in his beard again: there are times when he talks exactly like a
  man with his mouth full of fish-bones. So I waited for him to get it off his
  chest, and if you can explain it I shall be glad, for I certainly can't.</p>

  <p>"He first of all started on the question of outings. He mumbled and he
  grunted, and repeated his warning of last night about the immediate future.
  Then without a word of warning he suddenly asked me if I'd like to go to
  London. I stared at him blankly and asked him if he meant alone, or was he
  going, or what.</p>

  <p>"'Alone,' he said. 'All alone in a nice first-class carriage.'</p>

  <p>"Honestly, Tom, I don't think the man is all there. I half expected him to
  go on and say something about the pretty puff-puff. However I waited, and let
  him get on with it in his own way.</p>

  <p>"'You see, Miss Verney,' he said for the twenty-fourth time, 'I am a
  recluse. I dislike intensely going outside my own grounds. And one of the
  things that I shall wish you to do for me will be to make frequent trips to
  London on very confidential business.'</p>

  <p>"'That seems quite clear,' I said. 'But what sort of business? Because I
  have got no knowledge of anything except typing and shorthand.'</p>

  <p>"'You won't require any knowledge,' he assured me. 'All that I want is a
  nice-looking young lady whom I can trust implicitly.'</p>

  <p>"And suddenly I remembered a thing which Miss Mudge had said when she told
  me of my being engaged. At the time I didn't think about it, but now it came
  back. One absolute proviso was that I must look a lady.</p>

  <p>"'You see, Miss Verney,' he went on, 'my one hobby all through my life has
  been acquiring beautiful things. And recently a relative of mine has died,
  and left me a wonderful collection of old jewellery. Now this big place, as
  you will understand, costs a lot of money to keep up, and I fear that, much
  as I regret it, I shall have to sell some of my things. And that is where I
  want you to help me.'</p>

  <p>"'You mean,' I said, 'that you want me to take them up to London and sell
  them for you?'</p>

  <p>"'That's it,' he cried. 'That is just what I want.'</p>

  <p>But why not send for a good man from Christies,' I said, 'or a first-class
  jeweller to come here? I should probably be badly swindled.'</p>

  <p>"He shook his head cunningly. 'No, you won't,' he said. 'Not if you do it
  the way I say. You see,' he went on confidentially, 'it is like this. If I
  send for a first-class jeweller to come to me here, and he sees all my
  collection or even half of it, it stands to reason that he won't give me as
  good a price as if I sold each article separately. At the same time I
  obviously cannot ask a man to make fifty different journeys down here and
  show him the things one at a time. So I want you to make the fifty different
  journeys up to London. There are scores of first-class jewellers either there
  or in the big towns like Birmingham and Manchester, and if you go to a
  different one each time you will get the maximum price for each article.
  Look, for instance, at that.'</p>

  <p>"He produced from his desk a small box, and opened it. Inside was the most
  lovely pearl and diamond pendant I have ever seen. The setting was
  old-fashioned, but even I could realise how valuable it was.</p>

  <p>"'Now,' he went on, 'if you took that to a good man, and told him it had
  been left you by your mother or a relative, I am sure he would give you a
  thousand pounds for it.'</p>

  <p>"'I should think it more than likely,' I said. 'But why bring in the bit
  about it having been left me? Why not simply say that I want to sell it?'</p>

  <p>"'He might want to know how you got it.' he explained. 'And the one
  important thing. Miss Verney, is that the news should not be passed round
  among them that a big collection is being disposed of piecemeal. Once that is
  known, down will go the prices.'</p>

  <p>"I suppose he is right, though I don't know much about these things.</p>

  <p>"'I had intended,' he went on, 'when I first engaged you for you to start
  on that side of your duties at once. But now certain things have occurred
  which render it necessary for you to postpone it a little. So that for a few
  days, my dear young lady&mdash;just for a few days&mdash;your duties will not
  be very onerous.'</p>

  <p>"With that I left him, and went and typed the letters. What is the meaning
  of it, Tom? One thing is perfectly clear: it is not for any secretarial work
  that I have been engaged. The main part of my job is obviously to sell his
  stuff for him. But it all seems so peculiar. Incidentally when I took him
  back the letters to sign, he was down again on his knees by the fireplace,
  and he had completely forgotten all about them. Moreover he was furious at my
  walking in, though I had knocked twice.</p>

  <p>"Lunch time&mdash;so I will stop. What do you think? It all seems very
  funny to me."</p>

  <p>"And to me," said Hugh thoughtfully, as Freckles folded up the letter.
  "But not inexplicable, once one thing is granted."</p>

  <p>"And that is?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"That the stuff to be disposed of is stolen," he answered. "If this
  collection he talks of was honestly come by, the simplest method by far of
  disposing of it would be to do what Miss Verney suggests, and have a really
  good man down from London. Obviously he dare not. So he has hit on this
  distinctly clever method. If Miss Verney walked into a shop with an ornament
  such as she mentions, it would arouse no suspicions. It is just the sort of
  thing she might have been left by a relative. And a good man would give her a
  fair price for it. If Granger walked into a shop with it they would probably
  ring up Scotland Yard after one look at his face. And if he took it to an
  ordinary fence he would get a third of its value."</p>

  <p>He rose and began to stroll up and down.</p>

  <p>"We are on the line," he said: " I am sure of it, though we are the deuce
  of a long way from spotting the whole thing. Our friend at Temple Tower is
  obviously in possession of a big lump of stolen property which he intends to
  sell. For that purpose he engages a lady secretary, who without suspicion can
  get a good price for it. Then suddenly along comes the bird at Spragge's Farm
  who puts the fear of God into Granger. He is probably a man whom Granger
  double-crossed, and who is entitled to his share of the swag. So that
  necessitates Miss Verney's activities being postponed until he is disposed of
  one way or the other. Does that sound feasible?"</p>

  <p>And the more I thought of it the more it did, though, as Hugh said, there
  were still a lot of unaccountable things. Where, for instance, did the
  Vandalis come in? Were they also entitled to a share in the stolen property?
  And, if so, why had Granger not recognised them? And then last, but certainly
  not least, whose was that mysterious black figure that had flitted silently
  through the wood, and which inspired Granger with such ghastly terror? Was it
  the man from Spragge's Farm, or was it yet a further complication?</p>

  <p>A sudden exclamation from Hugh interrupted my thoughts. He was standing
  with his eye glued to the telescope, and the instrument was focussed on
  Spragge's Farm.</p>

  <p>"Activity," he remarked, "on one of the fronts. There is a car standing
  outside the farm&mdash;a thing that looks like a tradesman's van. They are
  all three of them there, the two men and the woman, and they are putting
  something into it.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he went on excitedly after a moment, "I believe it is. It is
  just about the shape. They are putting the rope ladder on board, you fellows.
  Now the woman has gone into the house, and one of the men has clambered into
  the back of the car. They're off."</p>

  <p>And now it was easy to see the car coming along the track away from Rye,
  and after a while we lost sight of it.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what that signifies," said Freckles.</p>

  <p>"It signifies that the ladder is finished," said Hugh gravely. "And it
  also signifies, if I mistake not, that the game is shortly going to begin in
  earnest. That car can get to Temple Tower from the opposite direction. Come
  on: we've got to take the road once more."</p>

  <p>"But he surely won't try and climb the wall by daylight?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"No: but it is more than possible that he is going to hide the ladder
  nearer the scene of action by daylight," said Hugh. "And if he hides it
  anywhere he is going to hide it in that wood. There is no particular hurry
  because it is going to take that car at least half an hour to get there going
  by that route. But I think we'll just stroll along and see what happens."</p>

  <p>And so once again did we find ourselves lying up in our hiding-place
  opposite the gate of Temple Tower, only this time Hugh was with us. Moreover
  I noticed that he, every now and then, threw a glance over his shoulder into
  the gloom of the wood behind, as if he expected to see that mysterious black
  figure. But on this occasion there was no sign of it: the wood was silent and
  deserted. And after a time I even began to wonder if the whole thing had not
  been a trick of the light, and whether we hadn't imagined it all.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed, quarter of an hour, and then we heard the sound of a
  car in the distance. Very cautiously we peered out, and Hugh gave a little
  grunt of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"It is the one I saw," he muttered, and we waited breathlessly to see what
  would happen. Forty yards away from us it pulled up, and Spragge, who was
  driving, said something to the passenger hidden behind. And the next moment
  the ladder maker emerged.</p>

  <p>I don't know about the others, but to me he seemed even more repulsive in
  the daylight than he had the night before. He peered up and down the road;
  then, seeing there was no one in sight, he hauled his ladder out of the body
  of the car. The rope part was wrapped round the central bolster, and its
  general appearance was that of a gigantic sausage. Then, putting it under his
  arm, he dived into the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>We could hear him crashing about, and then, after a short silence, he
  emerged, and again went to the back of the car. This time he pulled out a
  wooden pole about the length of a hay-rake. At one end he had constructed a
  sort of cradle, and its object was evidently to enable him to hoist the
  ladder into position on the wall. He went into the wood once more: then,
  reappearing a second time, he vanished into the back of the car, which drove
  rapidly past us towards Rye. His preparations were finished: he was ready for
  the night's work.</p>

  <p>We waited till the car had disappeared, and then stepped out on to the
  road.</p>

  <p>"There would be no harm," remarked Hugh, "in investigating our friend's
  handiwork. And there is one rather useful point. If he makes as much noise
  moving about at night as he did then, he won't be hard to follow."</p>

  <p>We found the ladder and the wooden cradle without difficulty. They had
  been roughly pushed under some blackberry-bushes, with but little attempt at
  concealment. Relying on the fact that there was no one about, all he had done
  was to put them sufficiently far from the road to escape the eye of a stray
  passer-by.</p>

  <p>"A sailor, I should think," remarked Hugh thoughtfully, as he examined the
  ladder. "That canvas and tarred twine seem to smack of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Do we leave them there?" asked Freckles.</p>

  <p>"We do, my lad," laughed Hugh. "Because unless I am very much mistaken
  to-night's entertainment is going to help us considerably to elucidate
  things. It is all right, young fellow," he went on reassuringly. "Miss Verney
  is not going to come to any harm&mdash;that I promise you. Let's stroll back
  and see if John has returned to the fold."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke he swung round with that characteristic movement I
  knew so well. He was peering into the undergrowth with every muscle braced,
  and every nerve alert. But nothing moved: the silence was still absolute. And
  after a while he relaxed and stepped out of the wood into the road.</p>

  <p>"What did you see?" said Freckles eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he answered curtly. "I thought I did for a moment, but it was
  my imagination. Come on: let's get back."</p>

  <p>He said no more until we were in the house, and then he waited till
  Freckles had left us alone,</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said gravely, "the plot thickens."</p>

  <p>"You did see something in the wood, then?" I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I saw your mysterious black friend," he answered quietly. "He is very
  good at concealing himself, but I happen to know a trick or two concerning
  that game myself. He was about twenty yards away from us."</p>

  <p>"But then why didn't we go for him?" I cried bewildered.</p>

  <p>"There is one little point that I have learned in the course of my life,
  Peter," he answered, "that rather influenced the situation. A man without a
  gun is at a considerable disadvantage when opposed to a man with one. We were
  in the former category: he was in the latter. Had we moved, we were for it:
  he'd got us covered."</p>

  <p>"But do you really think he would have dared to have shot the three of us
  close to a main road?" I objected.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose he wished to for a moment," he agreed. "At the same time,
  had we gone for him then and there he might have been forced to. And I wasn't
  for taking the chance. Peter," he went on in a lower voice, "there is a
  damned sight more in this affair than is at present sticking out on the
  surface. We are up against something pretty big, and we have got to move
  warily. But there is one thing I can promise the gentleman in the wood: two
  people can play at his game. My hand may have lost its cunning to a certain
  extent, but I think I can still guarantee to stalk the stalker. And next time
  he will not be the only one with a gun. Don't say anything to the
  youngster."</p>

  <p>I did not, though I couldn't prevent myself from thinking over this new
  development. That Hugh was perhaps mistaken never entered my head: he simply
  was one of those men who did not make mistakes on matters of that sort. He
  had the eyesight of a lynx, and if he had seen an automatic, then there was
  an automatic. And as he said, it put matters on a different footing. If the
  owner of the gun was prepared, if forced to it, to kill three men close to a
  main road, the affair was bigger than we had at first thought. But who was
  he: what was he: where did he come in? Was he acting in collusion with the
  ladder maker Marillard? Or was he another quite separate cog in the machine?
  One thing was certain, whatever he might be: he was a very dangerous addition
  to the other side. And a further thing, too, was certain. The possibility
  that it might be Marillard himself who was masquerading in some disguise was
  disposed of: that at any rate we now knew.</p>

  <p>John James had appeared on the scene in time for dinner, eager to hear if
  any further doings had taken place. And having been posted up to date there
  was nothing further to do but to wait for darkness before once again treading
  the familiar road to Temple Tower. Hugh was unusually silent as we sat
  outside finishing our brandy, and I guessed that he was trying to piece
  together the jigsaw in his mind. And it came as a feeling of relief when, at
  a quarter to ten, he got up and said it was time to start.</p>

  <p>"Come into my study for a moment, Peter," he said to me. "Look here, old
  boy," he remarked when he had shut the door, "here is one for you. I daren't
  trust either of the other two with a gun, but you are used to them,"</p>

  <p>I slipped a vicious-looking little Colt into my pocket, and I could see
  the outline of another in his.</p>

  <p>"Needless to say, don't use it unless it is absolutely essential," he
  warned, "But also, needless to say, don't forget that our friend of the wood
  carries one himself."</p>

  <p>We rejoined the others, and Hugh looked at them critically. Freckles was
  obviously on edge with excitement, and Hugh smote him on the back.</p>

  <p>"Easy does it, young fellow," he laughed. "And don't forget&mdash;not an
  unnecessary word, not an unnecessary sound. And if I tell you to do
  something, jump to it. Now we'll go in two pairs. I'll go first with Scott,
  and we will go beyond the spot where we know the ladder is hidden. Peter, you
  follow with John, and go to ground where we were this afternoon. Give us two
  or three minutes' start."</p>

  <p>It was practically dark when we reached our hiding-place. We had passed no
  one on the road, nor had we seen any sign of the other two who were some
  three or four hundred yards ahead of us.</p>

  <p>"How long are we likely to have to stop here?" whispered John James to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," I answered. "Presumably until our friend from Spragge's
  Farm considers it safe to start work."</p>

  <p>Half an hour passed, an hour, and then quite suddenly from inside the
  grounds there came the most terrible sound. It rose and fell in a deep-
  throated snarling roar, savage beyond description. For perhaps a quarter of a
  minute it continued: then it ceased as abruptly as it had commenced.</p>

  <p>"Good God! what was that?" muttered John James in a shaking voice.</p>

  <p>"The Pekinese," I answered, none too steadily myself. "I've heard the
  brute once before."</p>

  <p>And at that moment I heard Hugh's voice, low and urgent.</p>

  <p>"Peter, where are you?" He loomed out of the darkness. "We have been
  stung," he said. "The ladder has gone. We have been sitting here all this
  time like damned fools, and the enemy is inside."</p>

  <p>We scrambled to our feet, as Scott joined him.</p>

  <p>"When I heard that hound," he went on, "I began to wonder. So I had a
  look. It is not there.</p>

  <p>Our friend is inside the wall. Moreover," he continued grimly, "the dog
  seems to be aware of the fact."</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Go round the wall," he answered, "keeping your eyes skinned for the
  ladder. We ought just to be able to see that bolster thing against the sky.
  If we can't we are done, because the ladder itself will be inside. I'll lead:
  Peter, you bring up the rear."</p>

  <p>We started off in single file, keeping to the road. As Hugh had said, it
  was possible to see the top of the wall outlined against the sky, and there
  had been no sign of the canvas sack when we reached the corner. There we
  struck away from the road at right angles, still following the wall. And as
  luck would have it we had come the right way. Not fifty yards from where we
  had turned we saw it on top of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Hugh, "which of you two is the lightest? Scott, I should
  think. Up you go, young fellow, on my shoulders: get astride that bolster and
  pass the ladder over to this side."</p>

  <p>It proved easier than one would have thought, and ten seconds later
  Freckles was sitting astride the wall and Hugh was climbing up the ladder.
  Then he threw it over to the other side and disappeared down it, leaving
  Freckles to pass it back for us. John James went next and I followed, and
  three minutes from the time we had found it we were all inside.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of cover to conceal our movements as we crept cautiously
  forward. The whole place was unkempt and badly looked after. Thick
  undergrowth grew between the trees, and there was no semblance of even the
  crudest track or foot-path. At last we came to an opening. Ahead of us, some
  fifty yards away, lay the house, and a light was burning in one of the
  ground-floor windows. Then suddenly another light went on, this time on the
  second floor, and outlined against it was the figure of a girl. She was
  peering out, and Freckles gave a quick exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," growled Hugh. "Not a sound."</p>

  <p>It was Miss Verney, and after a time she put out the light again. Once
  more the house was in darkness save for the ground-floor room.</p>

  <p>"I want to see into that room," whispered Hugh. "Skirt round to the left,
  keeping under cover."</p>

  <p>We followed him, dodging from tree to tree, until he halted before another
  open space. In front of us was what looked like an old ruined wall, as far as
  one could see in the darkness. It was broken down and crumbling, and in some
  places was on a level with the ground.</p>

  <p>"The old chapel," he muttered, and John James grunted assent.</p>

  <p>And we were just on the point of going on when there came the sound of
  voices from the house. It was too far off to hear what was said, but they
  were loud and angry. Both were men's, and it was obvious that a quarrel was
  going on. And then, just for an instant, I saw the two of them silhouetted
  against the light, and recognised Granger and the servant Gaspard. Granger
  was shaking his fists in the air, and Gaspard was standing sullenly with his
  hands in his pockets. Then they disappeared, and the light went out.</p>

  <p>"Damn," muttered Hugh. "However, let's go on and have a look at the
  chapel. Careful where you put your feet: it is going to be awkward if someone
  sprains his ankle."</p>

  <p>We crept on till we came to the crumbling stonework. It was grass-grown
  and afforded treacherous walking, rendered all the harder by the darkness.
  Twice did I dislodge a stone with my foot, and I was just beginning to wonder
  what good Hugh hoped to do when I heard him give a gasp of surprise. I peered
  ahead: he was bending over something on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he muttered, "look at this."</p>

  <p>"This " was the dog&mdash;stone dead. It was an enormous brute, and its
  body was arched, and its great fangs gleamed white in a last death snarl. And
  in the air there hung the smell of burnt almonds .</p>

  <p>"Prussic acid," he said. "I wondered what had silenced it so
  suddenly."</p>

  <p>And then he straightened up, and his hand went to his revolver pocket.</p>

  <p>"The dog is dead," he muttered grimly, "but the man who did
  it&mdash;isn't. Keep your eyes skinned."</p>

  <p>Instinctively, we closed up; there was something terrifying about that
  gloomy, silent house and the rank undergrowth, even without the additional
  knowledge that we were not the only watchers. The whole place smelt of decay,
  and I was on the point of suggesting to Hugh that we should go, when there
  came from the house the sound of bolts being drawn. Someone was coming
  out.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and in the dim light from the hall we saw for a moment
  the outlines of Granger and the servant. Then it clanged to again, and we
  heard the bolt shoot home.</p>

  <p>"Nero; where are you, you brute?"</p>

  <p>Gaspard's voice came through the darkness: evidently he had been shut out
  of the house to find out what had happened to the dog. He went plunging into
  the undergrowth, calling and whistling, whilst we still stood there undecided
  what to do.</p>

  <p>"Nero. Nero."</p>

  <p>His voice was coming closer, and Hugh signed to us to move back under
  cover. And then quite suddenly there came a shrill scream of terror, followed
  by a horrible choking noise. The calls for Nero ceased abruptly: and after a
  moment or two the choking noise ceased too. The same thought was in all our
  minds: what was happening in the darkness close by? What had caused that
  sudden scream of mortal fear?</p>

  <p>Like a shadow Hugh glided away in the direction of the sound, and we
  followed. Every now and then he paused and peered ahead, but in the gloom of
  the undergrowth it was impossible to see anything. And it so happened that it
  was my lot to make the discovery. I was the last of the four, and quite by
  chance I was staring at a bush to my left. And it seemed to me that something
  moved.</p>

  <p>I went nearer, and only by the greatest self-control did I check a cry
  myself. A great black object was lying on the ground, and as I approached it
  suddenly rose. It seemed to unwrap itself, and I felt instinctively that it
  was staring at me. Then, with a sort of snarling hiss, it vanished, and I saw
  what it had left behind.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," I said shakily, and in a second he was with me.</p>

  <p>"Good God! " he muttered, and pulled out a tiny electric torch. Gaspard
  was lying there, his face red and swollen, and a glance showed that he was
  dead. He had been throttled: the marks on his throat were plain to see.</p>

  <p>"It was the black figure," I said. "It was lying on top of him, and when
  it heard me, it got up and vanished."</p>

  <p>"It strikes me we are dealing with a homicidal maniac," he remarked, and
  his voice was hard. "And with that brand one shoots on sight. Let's see if we
  can't get a sight. Back to the ladder, and move."</p>

  <p>He led the way, and we followed as quickly as we could. But to keep up
  with Hugh in the dark was an impossibility, and he was soon far ahead of us.
  At last the wall loomed up in front, and it was as we reached it that the
  sharp crack of a revolver brought us all up standing. It came from the
  direction of the road, and a sick feeling of fear got hold of me. Which of
  them had fired?</p>

  <p>"Hugh," I called out, regardless of who might hear. "Where are you?"</p>

  <p>"All right, Peter," came his welcome voice, and to my amazement I realised
  that he was the same side as we were.</p>

  <p>''That shot! " I said. "Who fired it?"</p>

  <p>"I can't see through a brick wall," he answered, "so I don't know. But
  with luck we may find out soon. He was over the wall when I got here, and the
  ladder is the other side. Up you go, Scott, and pass it back."</p>

  <p>Once again we repeated the performance of crossing, but this time Hugh was
  off like a flash the instant he reached the ground. And it was just as we
  were wondering whether to follow him or not that the final shock of the
  evening occurred. A voice with a slight American twang came out of the
  darkness from close by.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you guys think you are doing?" it said. "Or would it be
  indiscreet?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" I cried. "And where are you?</p>

  <p>"Who I am doesn't matter at the moment," went on the voice. "Nor where I
  am. But I have a gun in my hand, which I shall have no hesitation in using,
  if necessary."</p>

  <p>"A game at which two can play."</p>

  <p>Hugh's voice, doubly welcome this time, showed that he had returned.</p>

  <p>"By the sound you are both new ones to me," said the unknown quietly. "I
  am thinking we'd better have a little light on the scene, or else someone
  will be making a bloomer.</p>

  <p>"Then I will supply it," snapped Hugh.</p>

  <p>He switched on his torch, and focussed it on the stranger. He was standing
  about five yards away, a thin, hatchet-faced man of about fifty. In his hand
  was a revolver, but it was banging loosely by his side, and he made no move
  to raise it. For a while he stood there in silence: then he smiled faintly
  and spoke.</p>

  <p>"I trust the inspection is satisfactory," he remarked. "But in case you
  want anything more, do you recognise that ?"</p>

  <p>He opened his coat, displaying the badge of the New York police.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Hugh. "Was it you who fired that shot?"</p>

  <p>"It was not," answered the other. "And if you will deflect your torch a
  little lower you will see why, though you will have to come nearer."</p>

  <p>He was still holding his coat open, and as we got close to him we could
  see a bullet hole clean through it on a level with his waist.</p>

  <p>"Touch and go, gentlemen," he remarked. "And now, if you have satisfied
  yourselves that I am not the villain of the piece, I would strongly suggest
  that you put out that torch. There are people abroad to-night who are
  attracted to torches, and next time it may not be my coat."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Hugh hesitated, then he switched off the light.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what your name is?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, though I fear it will not convey much to you. My name is
  Matthews&mdash;Victor Matthews. Am I right in supposing that you are the
  gentlemen who were wandering around Spragge's Farm last night?"</p>

  <p>"You can suppose any damned thing you please," snapped Hugh. "What I want
  to know, Mr. Matthews, is what you are doing prowling about here!"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have always heard," he said, "that offence is the best defence. But
  really, sir, don't you think your remark is a bit cool? You may remember the
  badge I showed you, which, at any rate, gives me an official standing. But as
  far as you gentlemen are concerned, I fail to see that you have any&mdash;
  certainly none that permits you to break into the private grounds of a house
  in the dead of night. However, you need not fear: I shall say nothing about
  it. In fact, I am profoundly relieved to see you. I have played a lone hand
  long enough. And if you are prepared to assist me, no one will be more
  pleased than myself. Did you find anything of interest inside there
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"We found," said Hugh quietly, "a dead dog and a dead man."</p>

  <p>"Dead man!" cried the other sharply. "Who&mdash;<i>le Rossignol</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The how much?" cried Hugh: prizes for French have hitherto eluded
  him.</p>

  <p>"The Nightingale," said Matthews. "The man you saw at Spragge's Farm,
  making that ladder."</p>

  <p>"No: it wasn't him," said Hugh. "It was Gaspard, Granger's servant. And he
  had been killed by a mysterious being in black."</p>

  <p>"Throttled, of course," said the other.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" asked Hugh suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Matthews, "the mysterious being in black, as you call him,
  who very nearly finished me off, is known, amongst other things, as the
  Silent Strangler. So he has killed the servant, has he?"</p>

  <p>"We came on him in the act," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Then that accounts for his rapid retreat," remarked Matthews
  thoughtfully. "Well, gentlemen, do we work together, or do we not? I can only
  assume that you have come into this show out of idle curiosity, or for sport.
  Am I right?"</p>

  <p>And now it was Hugh's turn to laugh.</p>

  <p>"I have heard worse guesses," he said. "What do you think, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly think that if Mr. Matthews can explain some of these
  mysterious happenings we should join forces," I said.</p>

  <p>"I can explain almost everything," he answered quietly. "But I do not
  think this is either the time or the place. So let us put things in order
  here, and go. It will be dawn soon."</p>

  <p>"But look here, chaps," objected Freckles, "what about the bloke from
  Spragge's Farm&mdash;the Sparrow or whatever he is called? He must still be
  lying about all over the place."</p>

  <p>It was perfectly true: in the general excitement the ladder maker had been
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>"You saw no signs of him inside?" asked Matthews.</p>

  <p>"Not a trace," said Hugh. "And even if we didn't see him, I should have
  expected to hear him. He is not a silent mover. Incidentally, I wonder if he
  came at all to-night."</p>

  <p>"He must have, to put the ladder there," said John.</p>

  <p>"Not of necessity," answered Hugh. "Don't forget that this man in black
  saw him hide it and knew where it was."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" cried Matthews.</p>

  <p>"Because we encountered the gentleman in the wood this afternoon. Only, as
  he was armed and we weren't, we left him alone."</p>

  <p>Matthews whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"You can thank your stars that you did," he remarked. "Or we should not be
  having this conversation now. Anyway, gentlemen, I look at it this way: If
  <i>le Rossignol</i> is inside there, let him remain: he will do no harm. He
  will kill Granger if he gets a chance, but, believe me, that doesn't matter.
  And if he is outside, again, let him remain there."</p>

  <p>"That is all jolly fine and large," cried Freckles, "but a great friend of
  mine&mdash;a lady&mdash;is inside there, too."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Matthews. "A lady? How is that?"</p>

  <p>"My fianc&eacute;e is doing secretarial work for Granger," explained
  Freckles.</p>

  <p>And once again Matthews whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," was his somewhat unexpected remark. "Perfectly splendid."</p>

  <p>"I am damned if I see anything splendid about it," grunted Freckles.</p>

  <p>"But I venture to think that you will," answered the other. And then his
  tone changed. "Gentlemen," he said briskly, "we cannot stand here all night.
  You, of course, must do exactly as you like. But may I ask what you were
  proposing to do if you had not run into me?"</p>

  <p>And for a while no one answered. It was a bit of a poser: what was there
  to be done?</p>

  <p>"As I thought," continued Matthews, "you don't know. And I don't blame
  you. To be quite frank, gentlemen, you have put yourselves in a position that
  is a little difficult to explain. If you go to the police you have to admit
  that you have broken the law yourselves, and you have to tell them a story
  which will take a bit of swallowing. I know it is true: you know it is true,
  but&mdash;well, I won't labour the point. I think you would find the
  atmosphere a little incredulous, to put it mildly. So I have a definite
  proposition to make to you. Do nothing at all until you have heard my story.
  As I told you, I can explain everything&mdash;or almost everything. Then you
  must do as you see fit&mdash;go to the police or not, as you like. In return,
  you shall tell me all you know, and between us, gentlemen"&mdash;his voice
  rose in his excitement&mdash; "we will beat the most dangerous criminal that
  lives in the world to-day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what about my fiancee?" cried Freckles.</p>

  <p>"I give you my solemn word that she is in no danger," said Matthews
  quietly. "But if you are under any apprehensions, get her out of the house
  to-morrow. Anyway, you can't now. And, as I said before, I think you will
  understand, when you have heard my story, why I was pleased when I heard that
  one of our side was in the house. Well, gentlemen, what do you say?"</p>

  <p>And at last Hugh spoke.</p>

  <p>"Agreed," he said laconically. "You had better come to my shanty."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Matthews. "Then the first thing to do is to remove that
  ladder and hide it in a different place. And after that we will go to your
  house, and I will tell you a story which, though long, I think you will find
  not uninteresting.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7"></a>VII. &mdash; IN WHICH VICTOR MATTHEWS BEGINS HIS
     STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">"FOR the purposes of this argument, Mr. Matthews," remarked
  Hugh, "you had better assume that we know nothing."</p>

  <p>We had all returned to his house, and having hunted round for bacon and
  eggs, had first of all had some breakfast. The ladder had been carefully
  hidden in the undergrowth, and we had seen no further trace of the man in
  black. And now, seated on the terrace, with the mist stretching like a white
  sea below us, we waited eagerly for him to begin.</p>

  <p>"All right," he answered, "I will assume that you know nothing. And, as a
  matter of fact, gentlemen, I am very certain that you do know nothing of what
  I am going to tell you. Because I am going back to the year of grace 1881. It
  was in that year that the inhabitants of Bordeaux had an unsuspected honour
  accorded them&mdash;so unsuspected, in fact, that most of them are still
  probably unaware of it. Under the very shadow of the Cathedral of St. Andr&eacute; a
  male child was born into the world. The question of nomenclature was a little
  difficult, since the mother had no idea who was the proud father, but she
  compromised by calling the child Jean and giving it her own surname of
  Marillard.</p>

  <p>"From the very first, I should imagine, the child was a most
  unprepossessing specimen. It was abnormally ugly, and that fact, coupled with
  the sneers of its companions over the question of its birth, combined to make
  its life intolerable. Anyway, it never had a fair chance, and as a result,
  the boy's character grew from bad to worse. He was an incipient criminal from
  the start, and his surroundings nurtured the growth, until, at the age of
  sixteen, he was nothing more nor less than a savage young animal. And if you
  chose to turn up the archives of the Bordeaux police you would there find
  records of positively murderous assaults perpetrated by this youth, in many
  cases on men years older than himself. He was possessed of incredible
  strength, and at times he was perfectly uncontrollable. He also possessed
  another strange characteristic&mdash;a very soft and melodious voice."</p>

  <p>The speaker smiled slightly and waved his hand in the direction of
  Spragge's Farm.</p>

  <p>"Thus the propitious beginning of Jean Marillard, now, as you will see, in
  his forty-seventh year. However, to return to his earlier days. He was
  eighteen years old, as far as I remember, when he decided that he had had
  enough of Bordeaux and drifted to Paris, where he naturally became associated
  with the lowest type of Apache. And you must remember, gentlemen, that in
  those days the Apaches were Apaches&mdash;not harmless citizens earning an
  honest penny by dressing themselves up for the part for the benefit of
  credulous tourists, as is the case to-day. Like to like: it was but in the
  nature of things that young Marillard should consort with the most vicious of
  the whole tribe. And it was then that he received his nick-name of 'the
  Nightingale.'</p>

  <p>"For the next year or so his history is unimportant. He remained submerged
  in the underworld of Paris, a skulker in dark corners. And then, with the
  invention of motor-cars, came the great opportunity. The thing has been done,
  of course, <i>ad nauseam</i> since, but the first motor bandit gang was the
  one of which the Nightingale was a prominent member. It is all a question of
  proportion, and just as in these days a racing car, with its eighty miles an
  hour, has the advantage over other users of the road, so, then, did some
  ancient Peugeot capable of only twenty.</p>

  <p>"And now I must leave him for a moment and introduce you to some other
  characters in the story. Only two are of any importance, and one of those
  two..."</p>

  <p>He paused, and a strange, almost dreamy, look came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"One of those two is the most powerful and dangerous man in the world
  to-day. I will take the other first. His origin is completely obscure. Half
  an Englishman, half Heaven knows what, he was in his way as dangerous a man
  as the Nightingale. But it was a very different way. The Nightingale, to do
  him credit, feared no man. He fought in the open&mdash;fought like a beast
  perhaps&mdash;but face to face. Also he was loyal to his pals, which was just
  what the other was not. A slimy, mean, creeping little beast, who conformed
  to no standard at all save what suited himself best. They called him <i>le
  Crapeau</i>, which I always thought was an insult to such an intelligent
  beast as the toad. And unless I am very much mistaken&mdash;in fact, I know I
  am not mistaken&mdash;the Toad is your next-door neighbour, who now passes
  under the name of Granger. When I say 'passes under,' for all I know Granger
  may really be his name."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," shouted Freckles, "that that is the man who
  Pat&mdash; who Miss Verney is working for?"</p>

  <p>"Don't alarm yourself, Mr. Scott," said Matthews quietly. "You already
  have my word for it that your fiancee is perfectly safe. Moreover, I think it
  is more than likely that you will finally come to the conclusion that the
  luckiest thing she ever did in her life was to go there."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" said Freckles, staring at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"May I finish my story, and I think you will see what I mean?" said
  Matthews. "Where was? Ah! yes&mdash;the Toad. There were three other members
  of the gang, who do not concern us at all now, since they are all dead. For
  the sake of clearness, however, I will give you their nick-names. One&mdash;a
  great hulking brute of a man&mdash;was called the Butcher. He was a
  slaughterer pure and simple: a man with no brain, but of great strength. The
  second was a deadly shot with a revolver, who was known&mdash;why I can't
  tell you&mdash;as the Snipe. And the last member calls for no particular
  description. He had no nickname, and was called Robert.</p>

  <p>"Now, I do not propose to weary you with a full account of their
  activities. Many of them were quite insignificant: many were even stupid.
  Remember that motor-cars were a new toy then for everyone, and our friends
  were no exception to the rule. They behaved, in short, on frequent occasions
  like children who are showing off, and they were treated accordingly by the
  authorities. Until the day came..."</p>

  <p>Once again he paused, that same dreamy look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he went on quietly, "you may think that what I am about to
  tell you is an exaggeration: that I have a bee in my bonnet on this
  particular subject. You may think that such a being as a master criminal is
  merely part of the stock in trade of the sensational novelist&mdash;a fiction
  of the films. You are wrong. It was in 1898 that a strange sinister influence
  began to make itself felt throughout the underworld at Paris, and not only
  through the underworld, but through that section of society that reacts
  instantly to it&mdash;the police. At first the influence was vague&mdash;more
  a suggestion than a definite force. Incredible rumours flew round, and no one
  knew what to believe. The police, as a body, scoffed openly at the whole
  thing: so did some of the Apaches. For gradually these rumours crystallised
  into one central idea: that a power had arisen which was definitely
  controlling the criminal activities of Paris, and controlling them for its
  own ends.</p>

  <p>What the power consisted of no one knew: who wielded it, no one knew. But
  after a year had passed the scoffing ceased: the thing was a proven fact. An
  intelligence was at work more powerful than the police, more cunning than the
  Apaches.</p>

  <p>"How came the proof, you ask? I will tell you. Not by any single dramatic
  stroke, but by a series of incidents, which, though small in themselves, when
  taken cumulatively, afforded irrefutable evidence. Men who had received
  orders from an unknown source, and had disregarded them, were found dead: and
  no one knew the hand that had struck them down. The police, too, did not
  escape: gendarmes who had interfered with the unknown's plan were killed.
  Some were shot: a few were knifed, but his favourite method was to strangle
  his victims. In fact, a reign of terror started, the more terrifying because
  of the air of mystery that surrounded it. Men spoke together in bated
  whispers, glancing fearfully over their shoulders, for no one knew who was a
  spy or who was not. The King of the Underworld had arrived."</p>

  <p>Victor Matthews paused to light a cigarette, whilst we waited eagerly for
  him to continue. Amazing though the story was, it was his quiet way of
  telling it that made it so impressive.</p>

  <p>"It was in 1900," he continued, "that a further development took place. He
  was cunning, this man&mdash;and clever. He knew to a nicety the French
  nationality: his psychology was perfect. Up to date, he had maintained his
  air of mystery: from now on he would give them something concrete to catch
  hold of. And so it was that there gradually came into circulation a series of
  exquisitely drawn little pictures. A man would find one in his pocket when he
  came to undress, with no idea as to how it had come there. And with each of
  them would be some definite order, written in block capitals. And if those
  orders were disobeyed, the recipient would later be found dead, with the same
  device pinned to his coat. Here is one that I kept for many years."</p>

  <p>He pulled out his pocket-book, and even as he had it in his hands, his
  eyes dilated and he sat motionless, staring at a tree just behind my
  seat.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he muttered. "Look at that."</p>

  <p>"What the devil," began Hugh, and then he came over to where I was
  sitting. And in silence we all stared at a small piece of paper which we had
  failed to notice in our absorption up till then. It was about two inches
  square, and was fastened to the tree by a drawing-pin. And in the centre of
  it, drawn in ink, was a perfect representation of a hunchback.</p>

  <p>"Is that the device you mean?" said Hugh quietly.</p>

  <p>For answer Matthews unfastened his pocket-book, and from it he took the
  exact replica of the paper pinned to the tree, save that it was yellow with
  age. But the drawing was the same&mdash;a hunchback.</p>

  <p>"I took this one," he said gravely, "from the body of a man who was found
  strangled one morning behind a lot of crates in the Gare de Lyons. He had in
  his pocket a third-class ticket for Marseilles, but he had not caught his
  train."</p>

  <p>For a while we were all silent, each busy with our own thoughts. This
  sudden verification of Matthews' story, coming, as it were, out of the blue
  into a sunny English garden, seemed wellnigh uncanny. Almost mechanically
  Hugh went to the telescope and stared through it. And after a while he swung
  round and faced us.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did that get there?" he said.</p>

  <p>Matthews gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"Your activities are evidently known. Captain Drummond, and are not
  approved of. <i>Le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> must have put it there himself."</p>

  <p>"Masqu&eacute;?" I cried, and Matthews nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes: I was coming to that, when this somewhat dramatic interruption
  occurred."</p>

  <p>"Damn the fellow," spluttered Hugh. "Having the gall to come into my
  garden and stick his cursed bits of paper all over the view. If I catch the
  blighter I'll turn his hump into a goitre in his neck. However, Mr. Matthews,
  please pardon the natural annoyance of a respectable English householder.
  Let's hear some more."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I was saying," continued the other, "it was in 1900 that that
  design began to become familiar with the population of Paris. That it was a
  further development of the same man, we knew; his methods remained exactly
  similar to those he employed when he was unknown. Only now he began to grow
  more daring. Up till then, his orders had always been transmitted in writing:
  now he commenced to issue them verbally. And this, of course, was seized on
  as a golden opportunity by the police. In every community there are men who
  can be bought, and the underworld of Paris is certainly no exception to the
  rule. And so as soon as this new development became known plans were very
  carefully laid to catch him. With great secrecy, and through the most
  trustworthy channels possible, it was communicated to certain likely quarters
  that in the event of anyone receiving a message from <i>le Bossu</i>, with
  instructions to meet him personally, the police were to be at once
  communicated with. And a very big reward was promised if the information led
  to his capture.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, one day we got a ring on the telephone. And a guarded voice
  informed us that <i>le Bossu</i> had summoned the speaker&mdash;a
  particularly unpleasant form of brute known as the Rat&mdash;to go to a small
  hotel not far from the Gare de l'Est at ten that night. The police surrounded
  the place: every entrance to the hotel was picketed when the Rat arrived. He
  was presumably to receive more detailed instructions in the hall as to which
  room he was to go to, and we gave him orders to communicate the number to the
  man at the door. It had been decided to allow him a little time with <i>le
  Bossu</i> so that we could find out what scheme that gentleman had in view,
  and it was ten minutes after the Rat had disappeared upstairs that we rushed
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Now, gentlemen, I was in the passage outside the room from the time the
  Rat went in. And I will swear that no one came out. Yet, when we went in, he
  was lying stone dead in the middle of the carpet, with a knife driven up to
  the hilt in his back."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Freckles, a cigarette he had forgotten to light between
  his lips. "But how did the fellow get away?"</p>

  <p>Matthews shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The window was open, and so that was where he escaped, presumably. But
  that was only one case out of a dozen."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a minute," said Hugh. "Had no one in the hotel seen the man who
  took the room?"</p>

  <p>"The room had been booked by telephone," said Matthews. "And the hotel,
  though small, is a busy one. Numbers of men had been in there that evening,
  and it was quite impossible to say which of them it was."</p>

  <p>"But a hunchback is a pretty conspicuous figure," I objected.</p>

  <p>"Ah! but was he a hunchback? True, he had adopted this device, but that
  was no proof that he was one himself. Or possibly the hump was
  detachable&mdash; a specially assumed disguise."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that's true," agreed Hugh.</p>

  <p>"You may take it from me, gentlemen," went on Matthews, "that we took
  every possible, and impossible, theory into account. But the plain, bald fact
  remained that under the very noses of the police the Rat had been murdered,
  and the murderer had vanished into thin air. However, I must get on: that is
  all ancient history and is nothing whatever to do with our little affair
  to-day, save that it gives you a good idea of the type of man we are dealing
  with."</p>

  <p>"Awfully jolly," murmured Freckles. "He sounds an absolute topper,"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming now to the part that really concerns us," continued Matthews.
  "And to make it clear to you, I will take it as it actually happened, not as
  we found it out at the trial of the Nightingale. He was our informant when,
  unfortunately, it was too late. As you will understand, after the episode of
  the Rat, and several others of a similar type, it had become impossible to
  carry on with the method we had originally hoped so much from. No one dared
  run the risk, though we doubled and trebled the money offered. But certain
  facts leaked out from the men who had seen him, and two of these were early
  established. First&mdash;he had a hump, though, as I said before, whether it
  was genuine or not we didn't know. Second&mdash;he was always masked. There
  was not a soul in the whole underworld of Paris who could claim to have seen
  his face.</p>

  <p>"It was in September, 1902, that the Nightingale received a message which
  caused him to turn pale with fear&mdash;a summons from <i>le Bossu
  Masqu&eacute;</i>. The Nightingale and his gang had, as I have already told you,
  been playing about with their motor-car, and enjoying themselves in their own
  mild way. If the truth be known, I think they were rather frightened of the
  machine: certain it is, they had no notion of its possibilities as an
  instrument of crime. And to them, pottering along with their little footpad
  tricks, came this sudden summons. The car, driven by the Nightingale alone,
  was to be taken to the small town of Magny, halfway between Paris and Rouen,
  and there further instructions would be given him."</p>

  <p>Matthews smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"I can imagine the feelings of <i>le Rossignol</i>," he went on, "as he
  drove out through the Porte Maillot on that fine September morning. The
  ever-present fear of the driver of those days that the car would break down
  was for once forgotten: he probably prayed devoutly that it would. But his
  prayer was unanswered, and at eleven o'clock he drew up outside the H&ocirc;tel du
  Grand-Cerf, in Magny, and proceeded to fortify himself with some alcohol.</p>

  <p>"Lunch time came, and with it a wild hope that there was some mistake, and
  that he was to be allowed to continue his normal life undisturbed by <i>le
  Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>. Vain thought: the summons came as he finished his meal. A
  letter was handed to him by the gar&ccedil;on, which he opened with trembling hands.
  It ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"'At eight to-night you will take the road to Gisors on foot. Four
  kilometres out of the town, on the left of the road, is a small copse. In the
  centre of the copse is a wood-cutter's shed. Go there.'</p>

  <p>"He told us at the trial, that three times that afternoon did he get as
  far as the local gendarmerie, only on each occasion to have his courage fail
  him at the last moment. Poor devil! one can hardly blame him. No one knew
  better than he what had been the penalty for treachery in Paris. And if it
  occurred in Paris with the whole force of police available, what chance had a
  couple of stout local gendarmes at night in the middle of a wood? And so
  eight o'clock found him taking the road for Gisors. He trudged along
  whistling, probably to try and keep his spirits up, until at length the copse
  on the left of the road loomed up out of the darkness. Like all town-dwellers
  the country at night was full of nameless terrors for him, even on normal
  occasions. The sudden scream of a night-bird could make him sweat with fear
  far more easily than any report of a revolver. So it isn't difficult to
  imagine his feelings on this far from normal occasion, when he struck into
  the trees and began to search for the wood-cutter's shed.</p>

  <p>"At last he found it. It was in pitch darkness, and when he tried the door
  it was locked. (Interrupting myself for a moment, I think at the trial, when
  all this came out, that our friend made as good a story as he could out of
  it, to try and enlist sympathy. But even granted that, I'll bet he had a
  pretty grim half-hour.) After a while he sat down, and took out a packet of
  Caporals. A cigarette, he reflected, might help to quieten his nerves. And
  even as he felt in his pocket for a match a hand came out of the darkness and
  took the cigarette out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Frozen with horror he sat there, leaning against the wall of the shed.
  Speech he could understand: the roar of Paris he was at home in, but that
  silent action in the middle of a deserted wood, where he had believe himself
  to be alone, literally petrified him with terror. His tongue was cleaving to
  his dry mouth: he couldn't even scream. Somewhere close to him was that most
  dreaded being in Paris&mdash;the masked hunchback.</p>

  <p>"The sweat ran in streams from his forehead: his teeth chattered. If only
  this other one would speak: if only something would happen to break this
  ghastly silence! But there was nothing&mdash;nothing save the faint creaking
  of the trees in the night breeze. At last he forced himself to look round:
  there, standing just behind him, was the figure of a man. He could make out
  no details: only the outline could be seen against the blackness of the wood.
  And after a while he scrambled to his feet.</p>

  <p>"'I have come,' he said in a shaking voice.</p>

  <p>"'Why do you suppose, <i>Rossignol</i>, that I chose a spot like this for
  our rendezvous?"</p>

  <p>"According to Marillard at his trial the voice of <i>le Bossu</i> was the
  most terrible thing he had ever heard. It was never raised, and his own
  description of it was that it sounded like drops of iced water boring into
  his brain.</p>

  <p>"'That we should be secret, M'sieur,' he stammered.</p>

  <p>"'And that is why you propose to light a cigarette in the middle of a dark
  wood,' went on the voice. 'That you were a fool I have long known: I perceive
  that you are an even more incredible imbecile than I suspected.'</p>

  <p>"'Pardon, M'sieur,' muttered <i>le Rossignol</i>. 'I am not used to the
  country: I did not think.'</p>

  <p>"'Precisely: you did not think. In future, you will think. Now pay very
  close attention. To-night you will sleep at the H&ocirc;tel du Grand-Cerf.
  To-morrow you will return to Paris. The day after you and the Snipe will take
  the car and go to Ch&acirc;teaudun. You know the road?'</p>

  <p>"'No, M'sieur. But I will find out.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes: you will find out. You leave Paris through the Porte d' Orleans.
  The distance is one hundred and twenty-five kilometres. Arrived there you
  will put up at the H&ocirc;tel de la Place, and see that your car is refilled with
  petrol and oil. Place also in your car two bottles of wine and food
  sufficient for two of you for a day. The rest of your gang will go there by
  train. They will put up at the H&ocirc;tel St. Louis. Repeat what I have said.'</p>

  <p>"In a trembling voice <i>le Rossignol</i> repeated his instructions.</p>

  <p>"Good. You will then await further instructions. And be careful,
  <i>Rossignol</i>, to put a guard on your tongue. Too much wine may be
  dangerous. If you serve me well, it will be to your advantage. If you
  fail&mdash;you will not do so twice. It is my pleasure to employ your car for
  other purposes than frightening old women in the street.'</p>

  <p>"'Oui, M'sieur: I will not fail. The Porte d' Orleans, you said?'</p>

  <p>"But there was no answer: <i>le Rossignol</i> was alone. As he had come so
  did <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> go&mdash;in utter silence. And an hour later a
  badly shaken Apache entered the H&ocirc;tel du Grand-Cerf and called for wine.
  Whatever the future might hold, this nerve-wracking first fence was safely
  over. That eerie wood was a thing of the past: in the inn was warmth and
  comfort and, most important of all, light.</p>

  <p>"Now there were many people who, when they heard the story I have just
  told you at the trial, laughed it to scorn. Why, they demanded, these
  elaborate and theatrical details? Why this meeting in a deserted wood at what
  must have been great inconvenience to <i>le Bossu</i> himself, if all that
  transpired could as easily have been done in Paris itself? But they didn't
  see what I and one or two others saw. They didn't understand that <i>le
  Bossu</i> was a master of criminal psychology. He realised the immensely more
  powerful effect that he would produce on the mentality of a man like
  Marillard, if he met him as he had done, rather than in Paris, which was
  <i>le Rossignol's</i> own atmosphere. It was the terror of the unknown that
  he was exploiting&mdash;the most potent terror of all, especially to a man of
  low mental calibre. He was proposing to use this gang for his own ends, and
  none knew better than he that fear was the safest way of keeping their mouths
  shut. However, that is all in parenthesis. Subsequent events prove only too
  clearly that I and the others who thought as I did were right. So we will
  pass on to the day but one after, which found <i>Rossignol</i> and the Snipe
  installed in the H&ocirc;tel de la Place at Ch&acirc;teaudun, while the Toad and the
  other two were in the H&ocirc;tel St. Louis. The car had been filled up with petrol
  and oil: all instructions had been carried out, and there was nothing to do
  but to wait.</p>

  <p>And now we come to one of the most amazing crimes that has ever been
  perpetrated in France: the crime, moreover, that is the direct cause of this
  present state of affairs here. Strange, you will think, that such a long time
  has elapsed, but the reason for that you will understand when I have
  finished. Many of the actual details of the crime, I can, of course, only
  fill in by guess-work: for many we have to take Marillard's unsupported word,
  on an occasion, too, when admittedly he was trying to make out the best case
  he could for himself. Still, the story hangs together, and I can vouch for
  its main essentials.</p>

  <p>"About three miles out from Ch&acirc;teaudun, on the road to Vemd&ocirc;me, there
  stands the Ch&acirc;teau du Lac Noir. It is a magnificent old building standing in
  enormous grounds. It dates, I think, from the thirteenth century, and until
  quite recent years was the property of the Duc de St. Euogat. However, he had
  found keeping up the place beyond his means, and he had sold it about ten
  years previously to a Russian&mdash;Prince Boris Marcovitch. He was a man of
  fabulous wealth, whose only hobby in life was collecting. He didn't confine
  himself to one particular line: anything that attracted his attention and
  that he liked, he bought. But if there was one thing that he did have a
  predilection for, it was precious stones&mdash;particularly emeralds. I have
  talked to men who had seen his collection, and they have, one and all,
  assured me that it was unique in the world.</p>

  <p>"He was a man of peculiar tastes&mdash;this Russian Prince. He rarely, if
  ever, left the ch&acirc;teau grounds, and when he wanted company he imported it
  wholesale from Paris. It didn't seem to matter very much to him whether he
  knew the people or whether he didn't. He would write to a cousin of his who
  lived in the capital, requesting him to bring down a party. Perhaps a dozen
  girls and some men would arrive, and then for twenty-four hours there would
  take place what can only be described as an orgy. Drink flowed like water,
  and the only person on whom it had no effect was the Prince himself.</p>

  <p>"I remember a man who had attended one of them describing the end of the
  performance to me.</p>

  <p>"'I was pretty well tight myself,' he said, 'but not as bad as the rest.
  The whole lot of them, men and women alike, were sprawling round the table
  dead drunk. In the earlier part of the debauch the Prince had been the leader
  of the revels: now he sat at the end of the table, twirling a wine-glass
  between his fingers and with a look of ineffable contempt on his face. His
  thoughts were so obvious that he might have spoken them aloud.'</p>

  <p>"'"You boors: you loutish swine&mdash;why in heaven's name did I ever have
  anything to do with you?"'</p>

  <p>"So my informant told me, and I had confirmation from other sources. He
  seemed to be a man who from time to time had to break out, and then was
  sickened by the reaction when he had done so. But his disgust would only last
  a couple of months at the most. Then another of the same sort of parties
  would be given, to be attended with the same result.</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps unnecessary to say that, whatever was the effect on the
  host, his guests thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment&mdash;particularly the
  ladies of the party. The Prince would think nothing of giving each girl a
  present worth a hundred pounds when they left, and since most of them came
  from the ranks of the Casino de Paris or the Folies Berg&egrave;res, you can imagine
  their feelings on the matter. And so when it was noised abroad in the
  theatrical set in Paris that a supreme debauch of all was planned, the
  Prince's cousin became amazingly popular. It was to be a fancy-dress affair,
  and everyone was to come as an Apache. It got round of course to Police
  Headquarters, but it was none of our business what the Prince chose to do in
  his ch&acirc;teau. Our only concern was the prevention of crime, and it was on that
  account that a week before this historic party I found myself getting out of
  the train at Ch&acirc;teaudun. You will understand that I was unofficially
  attached, and Grodin, my immediate superior, thought that I could give the
  Prince a friendly warning better than one of the regular men.</p>

  <p>"He saw me at once when I arrived, and as I looked at that refined
  aristocrat I marvelled that he could ever give way to these appalling
  excesses.</p>

  <p>"'Monsieur le Prince,' I said, when he had glanced at my card, 'I wish to
  assure you that my visit is entirely unofficial. But we understand that you
  are giving a party here shortly, and that your guests are coming as
  Apaches.'</p>

  <p>"'Correct, Mr. Matthews,' he remarked. 'Is there any objection?'</p>

  <p>"'None, sir,' I said. 'But in view of your magnificent collection we
  wondered at Headquarters if you would like any police protection for the
  night in question? '</p>

  <p>"He drew himself up and stared at me coldly.</p>

  <p>"'May I ask why I should require protection against my own guests?'</p>

  <p>"'You will pardon me, sir,' I said doggedly, 'but I intend no reflection
  on those of your guests whom you know personally. It is, however, a
  well-known fact that many of the people who accept your hospitality are quite
  unknown to you.' 'Proceed, sir,' he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"'And such an opportunity as this is the very one to attract the attention
  of <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>.'</p>

  <p>"He began to laugh silently: then he rose and pressed a bell.</p>

  <p>"'Come with me, Mr. Matthews.' He gave an order in Russian to a servant
  who entered. 'I have heard rumours of this mysterious <i>Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>,
  and I can assure you that nothing would please me more than if he should
  honour my party with his presence.'</p>

  <p>"He was leading the way into the garden as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"He might succeed in giving me what I find so difficult to experience
  to-day&mdash;a genuine thrill. On the other hand&mdash;he might not. In my
  spare time, Mr. Matthews, I have sought to improve a natural aptitude in the
  use of firearms, and you shall judge for yourself whether my efforts have
  proved successful.</p>

  <p>"He had halted by a small garden table on which a waiting servant had
  already placed a case containing two revolvers. Once again he gave an order
  in Russian, and the man took up a position twenty yards away, holding my
  visiting-card in his outstretched hand. There came a crack, and the
  visiting-card was no more. Then the man threw an apple in the air. The Prince
  shot twice. He got the apple with the first, and the largest bit of it with
  the second."</p>

  <p>"Good shooting," said Hugh. "I used to be able to do that myself, but I
  have my doubts if I could do it now. Sorry to interrupt. Go on, Mr.
  Matthews."</p>

  <p>"As you say. Captain Drummond&mdash;good shooting, marvellous shooting. He
  laid down his revolver, and turned to me with a smile.</p>

  <p>"'That, sir,' he said, 'is why I say that on the other hand&mdash;he might
  not. For I should have not the smallest hesitation in killing him on the
  spot.'</p>

  <p>"I bowed: there seemed nothing more to say.</p>

  <p>"'I understand perfectly,' he continued, 'the object of your visit. And I
  am greatly obliged to your Headquarters for their courtesy. But I can assure
  you that I am quite capable of dealing with any uninvited guest myself; and,
  as for the others, I have implicit confidence in my cousin.'</p>

  <p>"So I returned to the station and to Paris. I reported the result of my
  visit to Grodin, who shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Well, anyway, he can't blame us if anything does happen,' he remarked,
  and at that we left it. We had done all we could: we had warned him. And, as
  Grodin pointed out, <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>, up to date, had confined his
  activities to Paris and its suburbs."</p>

  <p>Victor Matthews paused and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Eight days later," he said quietly, "we received a frenzied call on the
  telephone from the Ch&acirc;teaudun police. In the early hours of the morning
  Prince Boris Marcovitch, while at supper with his friends, had been shot dead
  through the heart, by <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>, and practically the whole
  collection had been stolen."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried Hugh, "this beats the band. Take a breather, my dear
  fellow, and have a drink."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8"></a>VIII. &mdash; IN WHICH VICTOR MATTHEWS ENDS HIS
     STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">"I WAS afraid you might find the story a little long," said
  Matthews, as the butler brought out the tray.</p>

  <p>"Long be blowed," cried Hugh. "It is the most extraordinary yarn I ever
  listened to. Sounds like a book."</p>

  <p>"Truth is stranger, Captain Drummond. The old tag. I think that beer looks
  very promising."</p>

  <p>He took the glass, and raised his hand in a toast.</p>

  <p>"I'm just trying to think," he went on after a while, "of the best way of
  telling you the remainder. I think perhaps I shall make it most interesting
  if I first of all give you the story as it was told us on our arrival at the
  Ch&acirc;teau du Lac Noir by the guests who had been detained there by the local
  police pending our coming.</p>

  <p>"There were fourteen of them in all&mdash;eight women, and six men. And
  their condition, as you can imagine, was pretty bad. In addition to this
  appalling affair, which in itself was sufficient to upset anyone, the whole
  lot of them had been extremely drunk the night before. And they looked like
  it.</p>

  <p>"However, by dint of questioning and piecing together their various
  stories, we managed to arrive at a fairly accurate account of what had
  happened. They had arrived by the train which reached Ch&acirc;teaudun at four
  o'clock the previous day. As usual they had been met at the station by the
  Prince's private carriages, and taken straight to the ch&acirc;teau, where the
  Prince received them. Champagne and caviar had at once been served, which
  sent them all upstairs to change for dinner in an expansive mood.</p>

  <p>Dinner itself started at eight-thirty and was preceded by more rounds of a
  special aperitif known only to the Prince, so that even at the beginning of
  the meal several of them were talking out of their turn. And by eleven
  o'clock most of them were riotously tight. Two girls from the Folies Berg&egrave;res
  were dancing on the table: in fact, an extra special debauch was in full
  swing. The hours went on: more drink arrived, and yet more drink, until many
  of the guests were frankly and unashamedly asleep. Only the Prince remained
  his normal self, though he was drinking level with them all.</p>

  <p>"Now it was his custom to hold these carousals in the huge old
  banqueting-hall. It was a lofty room with a broad staircase at one end
  leading up to the musicians' gallery. They had long since faded away,
  completely worn out, and in the general din probably no one even noticed that
  they had ceased playing. And so you can visualise the scene. The candles
  guttering on the table around which sprawled the drunken guests; and sitting
  at one end, with a look of scornful weariness already beginning to show on
  his face, their host. The staircase was behind his left shoulder, the top
  half of it in semi-darkness, as were the portraits of the Prince's ancestors
  which stared down on the revellers from the walls.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly one of the men who was singing some maudlin song broke off
  abruptly and leaned forward rubbing his eyes. What on earth was that strange
  object on the staircase? Was it really there&mdash;or was the great black
  shadow his imagination? Then it moved and he lurched to his feet. Grim
  reality struggled through the fumes of alcohol, and he hiccoughed out a
  warning.</p>

  <p>"The others looked up: a woman screamed. And cold as ice the Prince turned
  round to find himself facing a masked hunchback. There was a moment of dead
  silence&mdash;then he rose to his feet. And even as he did so a solitary shot
  rang out from the stairs, and the Prince pitched forward on his
  face&mdash;stone dead.</p>

  <p>"The guests, sobered by this utterly unexpected tragedy, huddled together
  like sheep. '<i>Le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>' passed from lip to lip in fearful
  whispers. And still this monstrous figure stood there motionless, his
  revolver still in his hand. Suddenly the door from the servants' quarters
  opened and five men came in. Save for the fact that they were masked they
  might have been five of the guests, because they too were dressed as Apaches.
  Two of them advanced to the terrified guests, and each of them carried a
  revolver. No word was spoken; evidently the whole thing had been planned
  beforehand. While the two of them guarded the guests, and the sinister masked
  hunchback stood in silence on the stairs the other three systematically
  looted the place. They smashed in cabinets and wrenched open drawers, while
  the man whose collection they were taking lay dead by his own table.</p>

  <p>"It lasted nearly an hour so we are told. The stuff was carried out
  through the front door, the looters returning each time for more. And then at
  length they finished, and the three men who had been removing the stuff
  disappeared. There was the sound, and of this they were one and all quite
  positive, of a motor-car driving away&mdash;then silence. Slowly the two men
  who had been covering them the whole time backed to the door and disappeared
  also. And with that pandemonium broke loose.</p>

  <p>"As mysteriously as he had come <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> had vanished. The
  thing was over and finished; only broken cabinets and a dead man, who stared
  at the ceiling, remained to prove that it was ghastly reality and not a
  drunken dream. Completely sobered by now the men of the party dashed round
  the house, only to find that every servant had been bound and gagged. So they
  did the only thing there was to be done and sent for the local police.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was the situation that confronted us on our arrival. Two
  things were established at once. <i>Le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> had added yet another
  murder to the long list already to his credit; and the fact that a motor-car
  had been used, and that there were five Apaches in the raid, made it
  practically certain that the gang involved was <i>le Rossignol's</i>. So the
  first thing obviously to do was to try and lay that gang by the heels, which
  should have proved an easy matter. They have their invariable haunts to which
  they always return sooner or later, and we anticipated no difficulty whatever
  in catching them. But two days went past; three; a week; and still there was
  no sign of them. And it became increasingly obvious to me that the reason was
  simply and solely that they were acting under orders from <i>le Bossu
  Masqu&eacute;</i> himself: it was his brain we were contending against&mdash;not
  theirs.</p>

  <p>"Then came a new development. In a wood not far from Chartres a shepherd
  found a deserted motor-car. It had been forced in through some undergrowth,
  and was completely hidden from the road. Indeed, but for the fact that he
  thought he had seen a snake, and had gone into the bushes after it, the car
  might have remained there for months without being discovered. Of the gang,
  however, there was still no trace, nor of the loot they had taken&mdash;loot
  which, on the Prince's cousin's valuation, was worth, at a conservative
  estimate, half a million pounds.</p>

  <p>"And then at last came the final development of all. The telephone bell
  rang in our office, and a voice came over the wire. It was disguised, but not
  quite sufficiently. Before he had said a sentence I knew it was the Toad
  speaking, though I didn't let on that I knew. And his information was to the
  effect that <i>le Rossignol's</i> gang were lying up in a wood halfway
  between Mamers and Alen&ccedil;on. He was speaking from a public telephone call
  office so it was hopeless to try and track him through that. But I passed on
  the word that the Toad was back in Paris, and sat down to think it out.</p>

  <p>"If you look at the map you will see that the wood mentioned by the Toad
  is some sixty miles west of Ch&acirc;teaudun, while the wood where the car was
  found is about twenty miles due north. That seemed peculiar in the first
  place. In the second, what had caused the Toad to split? That it was quite in
  keeping with his nature I knew, but the Toad never did anything without a
  reason. And what was the reason in this case? Why had he turned traitor? Was
  he doing it on his own account, or was he doing it under orders from <i>le
  Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>? Had that gentleman decided that now the cat had pulled the
  chestnut out of the fire for him, its services could very well be dispensed
  with?</p>

  <p>"However, the first thing to be done was to verify the Toad's information.
  The wood he mentioned was surrounded by a cordon of armed police, who
  gradually closed in on the centre. And what he had told us proved correct.
  The gang was there; at least, three of them were. Who fired the first shot I
  don't know, but men's fingers are quick on the trigger in cases like that.
  Sufficient to say that two of the police were killed, and two were wounded,
  before the three bandits fell riddled with bullets. Finding themselves
  cornered, half starving, dirty, and unkempt, the Snipe, the Butcher, and the
  man called Robert fought like rats in a trap and died. But of the Nightingale
  there was no trace. Nor, again, was there any sign of the stolen property,
  though we searched the wood with a fine-tooth comb. And so there we were up
  against a brick wall once again. It was true that three of the gang were
  dead, but they were the three least important ones. <i>Le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>
  had completely vanished: so had both the Nightingale and the Toad. Had they
  split up the loot between them, or what had they done with it? Were they
  hanging together or had they fallen out? Those were the questions we
  constantly asked one another, and as constantly failed to answer.</p>

  <p>"And then, one day about a fortnight after the fight in the wood, we
  caught the Nightingale. With his voice and terrible appearance he was
  altogether too conspicuous a character to escape notice. And the police found
  him hiding in a back slum in Rouen, and promptly despatched him to us in
  Paris, where he first of all told us that part of his story that I have
  already told you.</p>

  <p>"If you remember, we left him and his gang at Ch&acirc;teaudun putting up in the
  two hotels of the town, and having arrived there on the day of the Prince's
  party. They were completely in the dark as to what their further orders were
  to be: all they had to do was to sit and wait. Their instructions came to
  them at eight o'clock that night, and were simple in the extreme. They were
  to wait until eleven, and were then to proceed by car to the Ch&acirc;teau du Lac
  Noir. The motor was to be left in the shadow of some trees a hundred metres
  from the front door, and they were to remain hidden in the trees, also, until
  they saw a light flash twice from the bedroom window over the front door.
  They were then to proceed to the back door, where they would again receive
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"They waited until, at two-thirty, they saw the light. When they got to
  the back door they found it open, and confronting them in the darkness of the
  passage the dim black figure of the <i>Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>, who ordered them to
  pick up some coils of rope and follow him.</p>

  <p>"They obeyed: as <i>le Rossignol</i> said&mdash;'Messieurs, we dared not
  do otherwise. We were more frightened of <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> than of all
  the fiends in hell.'</p>

  <p>"Suddenly he flung open the door into a lighted room, and there
  confronting them they saw the four men-servants, who, following the example
  of those upstairs, were a bit fuddled themselves. Incidentally, of course, we
  knew all this part of the story already. But confirmation is always valuable,
  and we thought it a good thing to let him tell the yarn in his own way. They
  trussed the servants up, and then they received their final instructions.
  When they heard a shot they were to go straight into the banqueting-hall: the
  Snipe and he were to cover the guests, the other three were to loot the
  place. And he told us then exactly the same story as we had already heard
  from the guests.</p>

  <p>"So far, so good&mdash;but what we wanted to know was still to come.</p>

  <p>"'Be very careful now, <i>Rossignol</i>,' said Grodin sternly. 'You have
  spoken the truth up to date: see that you continue doing so.'</p>

  <p>"'By the Holy Virgin, M'sieur,' he exclaimed passionately, 'no word but
  the truth shall pass my lips. And if it does then may I be stricken dead, and
  have to forego my revenge on that festering sore <i>le Crapeau</i>.'</p>

  <p>"Grodin glanced at me&mdash;that was a bit of news. But he merely told
  <i>le Rossignol</i> curtly to continue.</p>

  <p>"It appeared, then, that the Snipe, the Butcher, and Robert were to find
  their way by cross-country trains to Mamers, from which place they were to go
  to a wood between there and Alen&ccedil;on.</p>

  <p>"'And of those three, Messieurs, I can tell you no more. I saw in the
  paper that they were dead. How, if I may ask, did you find them?'</p>

  <p>"'The Toad gave them away,' I said quietly, and for a moment we thought he
  was going to have an apoplectic fit. The veins stood out on his forehead, and
  a flood of the most filthy blasphemy poured out of his lips. We let him
  finish: as far as his feelings about the Toad were concerned, we had a
  certain sympathy with him.</p>

  <p>"At last he pulled himself together and continued. His orders and the
  Toad's were to take the car, with the loot inside it, on the road towards</p>

  <p>174 IN WHICH VICTOR MATTHEWS</p>

  <p>Chartres. After they had gone twenty kilometres, they would find a track
  leading off to the right. They would know it, because there were three tall
  trees at the junction. They were to proceed along this track for two
  kilometres, where they would find a disused quarry. In the quarry was a shed,
  and in that shed they were to put the car. Under no circumstances were they
  to move out of the quarry, or light a fire, or attract attention to
  themselves in any way. But if, by any chance, they were discovered by some
  wandering pedestrian, the pedestrian was to wander no more. And they would
  receive further instructions in due course.</p>

  <p>"Now I may say at once that we subsequently verified this statement. We
  found the track, and the quarry, and the actual wheelmarks of the car in the
  shed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it appeared that they sat there the whole of the next day. They had
  the bread and cheese and wine which <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> had ordered them
  to put in the car, so they were not hungry. And, incidentally, it struck me,
  even at the time, what astounding attention to detail that little fact
  showed. For if there is one thing that will overcome fear it is hunger, and
  but for having given them food one or other of them would most certainly have
  gone to the nearest village to get it.</p>

  <p>"I will now try and continue in the Nightingale's own words.</p>

  <p>"'It was about six o'clock, M'sieurs, that it happened. The sun was just
  setting, so I know the time. I had risen and was standing in the door of the
  shed, wondering what we should next be told to do. Suddenly I received the
  most terrible blow in the back of the neck, and I knew no more.'</p>

  <p>"We looked at his neck, and there was an ugly looking scar about two
  inches long. In fact, anyone except an abnormality like the Nightingale would
  never have known any more.</p>

  <p>"'When I recovered consciousness,' he went on, 'it was dark. At first I
  didn't know where I was, everything was a blank. And then, little by little,
  memory came back to me. The quarry&mdash;the affair at the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;the
  car. Mon Dieu! M'sieurs&mdash;sick and faint, I raised myself on my elbow.
  The car had gone: so had <i>le Crapeau</i>. I was alone in the shed. How long
  I had lain there I knew not: some hours, because the sky was studded with
  stars. And then there came a voice out of the darkness, and I nearly fainted
  with horror.</p>

  <p>"'"<i>Rossignol</i>,'" it said, "where is the car?"</p>

  <p>"'I was not alone: <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> was there too.</p>

  <p>"'"M'sieur," I cried, "I do not know. That accursed traitor <i>le
  Crapeau</i> struck me from behind with what must have been a spanner.
  See&mdash;I am wet with blood." '</p>

  <p>"'And, in truth, I was, gentlemen&mdash;soaked with it&mdash;my coat, my
  shirt, everything.'</p>

  <p>"'"Accursed fool," went on the voice, and I could dimly see <i>le
  Bossu's</i> outline in the gloom. "Blundering idiot. Do I plan with my great
  brain this wonderful coup in order that you should allow yourself to be
  sandbagged like an English tourist? And by <i>le Crapeau</i> of all
  people."</p>

  <p>"'"M'sieur," I pleaded, "I did not suspect him. I was standing in the door
  wondering what our next instructions would be when he crept on me from
  behind."</p>

  <p>"Be silent, worm," he said. "It is well for you, <i>Rossignol</i>, that
  your shirt is soaked with blood. Were it otherwise I might be tempted to
  think that this was a put-up job between you."</p>

  <p>"'"By the blood of the Virgin, M'sieur," I cried, "I swear to
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'"Be silent," he snarled. "I said it was well for you that he hit so
  hard. It proves to me that you are only a fool and not a traitor. Were you
  the second, <i>Rossignol</i>, I would strangle you here and now with my own
  hands. As it is, your punishment is sufficient."</p>

  <p>"'"But, M'sieur," I cried, "what am I to do?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer, <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> had gone. I was alone now, in
  very truth&mdash;miles from anywhere.'</p>

  <p>"So did the Nightingale ramble on. We let him talk, but there was
  obviously nothing more that he could tell us. He was very incoherent as to
  dates and times, and I think he undoubtedly remained in that shed in a
  semi-delirious state for three or four days. How he finally arrived at Rouen
  we never found out: he hardly seemed to know himself. Anyway, the point was
  not important.</p>

  <p>"He was brought up on a charge of robbery with violence, and sentenced to
  twenty-one years' imprisonment in Devil's Island. And with that we can leave
  him for the present. And with that also my story of the quarter of a century
  ago is practically finished. <i>Le Rossignol</i>, with a characteristic
  outburst of frenzied invective against the Toad, disappeared from the dock
  into twenty-one years of hell.</p>

  <p>"And now, gentlemen, we pass out of the region of certain fact into the
  region of guess-work. To take the Toad first. I do not think there can be any
  doubt as to what he did. Overcome by the thought of so much loot, he
  determined to try and get it all for himself. He laid out the Nightingale,
  and went off in the car. What happened then we can only surmise. Perhaps he
  found that he couldn't manage the car: perhaps he lost his nerve. But
  somewhere in that area of country he hid the stolen stuff. Probably he put in
  his pocket sufficient jewellery to keep him in comfort for many a long day.
  But the bulk of the stuff he must have hidden, intending to go back for it
  when the hue and cry was over. Then he ran the car into a wood, hid it as
  well as he could, and disappeared. And it is a fact that he did disappear.
  Years passed by: the war came, but never a trace of the Toad did we see. He
  vanished from the underworld of Paris as completely as a stone vanishes in
  the sea. Many people thought he was dead, though, personally, I never agreed
  with them. But at last the whole thing was forgotten: even the search for the
  treasure was abandoned. That had really been hopeless from the first, unless
  we could lay our hands on the Toad and make him lead us to it.</p>

  <p>"As to what happened to <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> we are equally in doubt.
  Many people believed that he had caught the Toad, and had murdered him for
  his treachery, first compelling him to reveal the hiding-place of the loot.
  There was a great deal to be said for the theory, though, somehow, I never
  believed it myself. No body was ever found anywhere which could possibly have
  been the Toad's. And I felt tolerably certain that a big man like <i>le
  Bossu</i> would never have taken the trouble to follow an object of that sort
  out of the country merely to kill him. It was the loot he was after&mdash;not
  the Toad. We still felt his activities in Paris, though, as years went by,
  they seemed to grow less and less. And there are strange stories told of
  incredible deeds of heroism performed in the war by a masked hunchback, who
  appeared suddenly in different parts of the line. Fiction, of course, but
  <i>le poilu</i> likes his little bit of mystery&mdash;just as your Tommy
  does.</p>

  <p>"And so we come to the present moment, and this strange reunion of the
  principals in that drama of nearly thirty years ago. As a matter of fact, you
  will see that it is not quite so strange as it would appear at first sight,
  but a perfectly logical affair.</p>

  <p>"It starts with the release of the Nightingale from Devil's Island five
  years ago. I was then working with the police in New York, but not because I
  had to. I happen to be of independent means, and I work for the love of the
  thing, not for the salary. And the case of all others that intrigued me most
  during my whole career was the one I have just told you. It was unsolved: I
  felt I had been beaten.</p>

  <p>Now I have a fairly good knowledge of the criminal nature. And quite by
  chance I happened to learn that an uncle of <i>le Rossignol</i>'s had died
  leaving his money to his nephew. So I gambled on the result that twenty-one
  years in Devil's Island would produce on a man like the Nightingale,
  believing, as he did, that he was there principally because of the Toad's
  treachery. I chucked up my job, and got on the heels of the Nightingale.</p>

  <p>"Well, my guess proved right. He was now, for a man in his position,
  comparatively affluent, which enabled him to be free from the necessity of
  working. And, as I thought would prove the case, he was obsessed with one
  idea, to the exclusion of everything else. And that idea was revenge on the
  Toad. While <i>le Crapeau</i> was still alive he was going to find him.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, these past few years may seem to you to have been dull: to me
  they have been fascinating. Backwards and forwards, searching and ferreting,
  the Nightingale has chased his man. Old companions of twenty years previously
  have been interrogated: clues have been followed up, only to be discarded.
  And all the time, unknown to him, I have been sitting on his heels, patiently
  waiting. I knew that no one was better qualified to find the Toad than he
  was. He had access to information that I could never have got: in addition it
  was the sole driving force of his life.</p>

  <p>"It is true, I admit, that at one period, when for months he seemed
  completely defeated, I very nearly gave it up. And then, quite suddenly out
  of the blue, there came the message that gave me the greatest thrill of my
  life. It was proof of what I had always thought in days gone by. Just an
  envelope handed to me by a gamin as I sat outside a cafe in Paris.</p>

  <p>"'Keep out of this.' That was all that was written on the paper:
  that&mdash; and the drawing I hadn't seen for so many years. So <i>le Bossu
  Masqu&eacute;</i> was not dead: <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> was on the trail, too. He
  also was following the Nightingale: he also was working on the same lines as
  myself. A strange situation as you will agree: I and that greatest of
  criminals both using the same dog to hunt our man, and the dog quite
  unconscious of the fact that he was being so used. It added zest to it, I can
  assure you. It meant sleeping with one eye permanently open: it meant that
  the whole time it was necessary to look in every direction, not only at the
  Nightingale. Several times I sensed his presence near me: how, I can't tell
  you. And remember the terrible handicap that I was working under. He knew me,
  but I didn't know him.</p>

  <p>"However, that is neither here nor there. Just as the obsession of <i>le
  Rossignol</i>'s life was to lay hands on the Toad, so the obsession of mine
  became the desire to catch <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>. It had turned into a duel
  between him and me. And that duel is now approaching its end."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Victor Matthews fell silent, his eyes fixed on the
  little drawing still pinned to the tree above my head. And we, enthralled
  though we were, let him take his own time.</p>

  <p>"The rest," he continued after a while, "is fairly soon told. Little by
  little, from a clue here and a clue there, it became increasingly certain
  that the Toad had left France. But where had he gone, and had he taken the
  loot with him? And then came a sudden and astounding stroke of luck. The
  Nightingale, in the course of his search, had reached Boulogne, and one
  evening he was sitting in a small wine-shop on the Quai Gambetta. At the next
  table to him was a French <i>ouvrier</i>, and I venture to think that not
  even the <i>Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> himself would have recognised me in that
  excellent workman. The cafe was fairly empty, and I was on the point of going
  when two French fishermen came in. They were both a little tight, and their
  conversation was clearly audible. But what principally attracted my attention
  was the fact that they obviously were full of money.</p>

  <p>"At first I listened idly, and then a stray sentence struck my ear.</p>

  <p><i>"'Le moulin &agrave; Bonneval.'</i></p>

  <p>"The mill at Bonneval, and Bonneval was the name of a village between
  Ch&acirc;teaudun and Chartres. Moreover, it was the nearest village to the quarry
  where the motor-car had been hidden during the day. Isn't it an astounding
  fact how sometimes, after months and years of fruitless labour, a stray
  remark casually overheard may provide a clue? As it stood, of course, there
  was nothing in it&mdash;but the coincidence attracted my attention. It was
  well it did so: amazing though it seems that a chance remark was destined to
  end our search.</p>

  <p>"I stole a glance at the Nightingale: he, too, had caught the phrase, and
  was listening intently. And after a while, as the full significance of their
  conversation sank into his mind, he began to quiver like a terrier when it
  sees a rat. Sometimes the men lowered their voices, but for the most part
  what they said was clearly audible. And one fact was soon established
  definitely. These two sailors owned the ketch <i>Rose Marie</i>, and they had
  recently smuggled over a cargo consisting of three large wooden cases, which
  had been landed on Romney Marsh somewhere between Rye and Dungeness. Further,
  that these cases had something to do with the mill at Bonneval.</p>

  <p>"I give you my word that by this time I was almost as excited as the
  Nightingale himself. I remembered that there was an old disused mill,
  standing a little back from the road, about a kilometre north of
  Bonneval.</p>

  <p>"Was it possible that that was the hiding-place which we had searched for
  in vain? And if so, who was the recipient of the cases on Romney Marsh?</p>

  <p>"Then another thought struck me: was <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> present? I
  glanced round the room: there were only some fisher-folk and a pale youth who
  looked as if he served in some shop. Honestly I could not think he was there,
  and yet--"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand at the tree behind me.</p>

  <p>"However," he continued, "it may be that he wasn't. The Nightingale is an
  easy man to track, and that may easily account for it. To return to that
  evening. The two sailors didn't say much more, but what they had said was
  quite enough to send the Nightingale flying over to England. He has one gift
  which you probably noticed the night before last&mdash;he speaks English
  fluently. And that was a considerable help to him. It was impossible for him
  to tell, of course, if the cases had been landed on Romney Marsh because the
  Toad was near at hand, or simply because it is an admirably situated locality
  for smuggling."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard a moment," said Hugh. "How long ago did you overhear this
  conversation in the wine shop?"</p>

  <p>"About six weeks," answered Matthews. "Rather more. Well, I can't tell you
  when the Nightingale first discovered that the man he wanted was your
  next-door neighbour. He's no fool, and presumably his suspicions at once fell
  on a house fortified like Temple Tower. So did mine. But the Toad is a
  secretive gentleman, and suspicion is not proof. Personally, I have not seen
  the man who now calls himself Granger, though I've lain up for hours waiting
  for him. I assume that the Nightingale has; at any rate, he has satisfied
  himself somehow that Granger is the Toad. And so his quest is ended: he has
  found his enemy. Theatrical as all those people are, he has flashed his
  warning across the Marsh&mdash;red and blue lights, the colours of the gang.
  For years that man&mdash;ever since <i>le Rossignol</i> was liberated from
  Devil's Island&mdash;has lived in fear of being found. And now he has
  been."</p>

  <p>Young Freckles took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I say, chaps," he remarked," we are having a jolly party, aren't we? And
  how do the Beaver and the girl come in?"</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to them," said Matthews. "Paul Vandali is one of those
  men, well-known to the police to be criminals, who have yet succeeded in
  steering clear of trouble. The only commandment they keep is the
  eleventh&mdash; thou shalt not be found out. The lady has not, I think, ever
  been united to Vandali in the holy bonds of matrimony, but she has been his
  inseparable companion for three years."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he is not the <i>Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Matthews shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible," he said. "He is not old enough. Vandali is a man of
  only about thirty-five. So that rules him out. Oh, no! He comes in in a very
  different way. I have mentioned, if you remember, the Prince's cousin, who
  chose his parties for him. Now that cousin is also the Prince's heir, and he
  is alive to-day in Paris. He inherited all the Prince's money, and so is an
  extremely wealthy man. After the affair at the Ch&acirc;teau du Lac Noir, he
  offered an enormous reward for the recovery of the stolen property&mdash;no
  less than fifty thousand pounds. Naturally he, years ago, gave up all hope of
  getting it back, though the reward still stood. And then Vandali and the lady
  appeared on the scene. You have seen them, and you will realise that they are
  people who are quite at home in the highest society. At any rate, they met
  Count Vladimir&mdash;that is the cousin&mdash;at supper one night not very
  long ago. And the conversation came round to the affair at the Ch&acirc;teau du Lac
  Noir. My informant was the waiter&mdash;who was not a waiter. To be more
  explicit, the Paris police were after Vandali over a little matter at Nice.
  They had no proof, but they were trying to trap him in an unguarded moment.
  And the waiter was really a detective.</p>

  <p>"Well, he got nothing from the meal which helped him over the Nice
  business, but what he did get was that Vladimir most categorically stated
  that the reward of fifty thousand pounds still held good. He said it with a
  laugh, almost as if he implied that it might just as well be a million for
  the good it would do. But the detective caught a very significant glance that
  passed between the two. And here they are.</p>

  <p>"How they spotted this place I can't tell you. It may be that they, too,
  through friends in the underworld, have kept themselves posted in the
  Nightingale's movements, realising, as I did, that in him lay their best
  chance of being led to the treasure. At any rate, they are here."</p>

  <p>Matthews paused and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, so much for the past, and the original causes that have
  led up to the situation as it stands to-day. Of my doings since I have been
  here there is little to say. I have told you that the main obsession of my
  life is to lay hands on the man who nearly murdered me to-night. And I have
  been lying up in a small place in Rye, watching and waiting for what I knew
  must happen, sooner or later&mdash;his arrival. I have kept my eye on <i>le
  Rossignol</i>: you saw me the other night when I very foolishly got caught in
  the light. But until to-night I did not know <i>le Bossu</i> was here. I
  don't know quite what took me up there&mdash;restlessness, perhaps, or
  something deeper. It sounds strange, I know," his voice grew almost solemn,
  "but I veritably believe, though I have never seen him until to-night, that
  there is some channel of communication between him and me which cannot be
  explained by any natural means. Gentlemen, I have felt him near me in Paris:
  I know it. And to-night an overmastering impulse took me to Temple Tower, You
  know with what result. Suddenly I saw him&mdash;looming out of the
  darkness&mdash;right on top of me. And although I had half expected it, the
  shock at the moment was almost paralysing. I even forgot to draw my gun till
  it was too late: he had gone."</p>

  <p>He paused, and a dreamy look came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"But he is here, and I am here, and this time it is the end, one way or
  the other."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two no one spoke: there was something almost awe-inspiring
  in the quiet finality of his words. Just as at Spragge's Farm, the soft
  melodious voice of <i>le Rossignol</i> had seemed to ring Granger's death
  knell, so, now, did this second deadly hatred promise a fight to the
  finish.</p>

  <p>"Enough, gentlemen," he went on in his normal voice. "No good has ever
  come of dreaming. Will you now return the compliment, and tell me what has
  happened to you? Then we will draw up a plan of campaign and decide what to
  do."</p>

  <p>We told him everything: about the chimney-pot episode, the sparking plugs,
  the stolen map, and Miss Verney's letter. And when we had finished, he smoked
  a complete cigarette before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond," he said quietly, "I congratulate you. I think your
  deductions are absolutely correct. Whether he meant to kill you with the
  chimney-pot, or only put you out of the way temporarily, is
  immaterial&mdash;but that was his first idea. And I think your appearance on
  the scene has changed all his plans. He has only just arrived, of that I am
  sure. He came expecting to find <i>le Rossignol</i> and me: instead, he finds
  all of you, to say nothing of the Vandalis."</p>

  <p>He rose and began pacing up and down, his face working eagerly as he
  emphasised each point.</p>

  <p>"What is the result? Merely that time becomes all important. He hears of
  the map belonging to Sir John: he steals it. Not knowing of the verse behind,
  he thinks that he has solved the method of getting in to Temple Tower. And he
  was looking for the entrance to-night when the dog found him. Probably
  alarmed by the din the animal made, he hid for a while near by, and it was
  then that Gaspard stumbled on him, only to be strangled. Who knows why he did
  that? It is possible he did not know you were in the grounds, and thought he
  might gain access to the house by pretending to be Gaspard: it is possible he
  had no alternative. But of one thing, gentlemen, I am very sure: time is now
  even more all important to <i>le Bossu</i> than it was a few hours ago.</p>

  <p>"In view of the fact that he did not gain access to the house, the killing
  of Gaspard was an error&mdash;a bad error. But it is done and cannot be
  undone. And of another thing I am very sure, too." His voice grew grave, and
  he stared over the Marsh thoughtfully. "If you heard the Vandalis' programme,
  Mr. Darrell, so did he. And I do not think it would find favour in his eyes
  &mdash;far from it. I hold no brief for either of them, but "</p>

  <p>He said no more, but the little shrug of his shoulders filled in the
  silence more ominously than any spoken word.</p>

  <p>"Had he got into the house to-night, the Vandalis would not have mattered.
  But he didn't, and now they do. However, they can look after themselves: the
  point we have to decide is what we are going to do. Shall we call in the
  police, or shall we not? There are, it seems to me, two main objections. The
  first is this: What are we going to tell them? Nothing that we can do can
  bring the man Gaspard back to life, and if we tell them anything, we must
  tell them all. And frankly, gentlemen, though you are, of course, the best
  judges of that, I think an account of your recent doings, told in cold blood
  at a police station, might prove a little awkward."</p>

  <p>"I know the Inspector pretty well," said Hugh, "but perhaps you are
  right."</p>

  <p>"The other objection," went on Matthews, "is this. And to me it is a far
  bigger one. If we tell the police, and they take the matter up, we drop out,
  or at any rate you do. And"&mdash;he thumped his fist into his open
  palm&mdash;"for the local police to try and tackle <i>le Bossu</i> is about
  equivalent to asking a board school child to explain Einstein's Theory. They
  are naturally trammelled by the law, and <i>le Bossu</i> would laugh at them.
  No, gentlemen, the only way of catching him, if you are prepared to do it, is
  for us to join forces and act outside the law on our own. Keep the police out
  of it, and we will catch him. Let them in, and our hands are tied."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said Hugh with a grin, "no one loathes the idea of
  letting the police in more than I do. But do not forget there is a lady
  involved."</p>

  <p>"I don't," remarked Matthews gravely, and turned to young Freckles. "I
  quite appreciate your position, Mr. Scott. But I am going to say something
  which I hope you will not consider impertinent. There is a reward of fifty
  thousand pounds at stake. Wait, please"&mdash;he held up his hand, as
  Freckles started to speak&mdash;"and then bite me afterwards. Captain
  Drummond, if I may say so, hardly seems to be a gentleman in need of money. I
  am in this show for one reason only&mdash;to get to grips with <i>le
  Bossu</i>. If between us we find that property, we get fifty thousand pounds.
  And do not be under any delusion. Count Vladimir can pay that sum without
  feeling it. Which brings me to my point. Your fiancee can be of invaluable
  assistance to us in finding it, and as a natural result would be entitled to
  the whole reward. Please understand me, Mr. Scott," he continued with a
  smile, which robbed his words of any offence. "But young ladies do not as a
  general rule take on jobs of that sort if their future husbands are
  wealthy."</p>

  <p>"My dear old lad," laughed Freckles, "we haven't got a blinking bean
  between us, if that is what you mean."</p>

  <p>Then here is an unprecedented opportunity of getting fifty thousand of the
  best," said Matthews.</p>

  <p>"Be a bit more explicit," said Hugh after a pause.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le Bossu</i> will return to Temple Tower," said Matthews quietly. "You
  disturbed him last night, but there is no power in Heaven or Hell that will
  deter that man from doing what he has come here to do. He may or may not kill
  <i>le Crapeau</i>, according to the mood he is in: but he has come to get the
  stuff stolen twenty-five years ago&mdash;the stuff which, as Captain Drummond
  says, Miss Verney has been engaged to sell. Well, gentlemen, my suggestion is
  this. Let us lie up and wait for him. In the past we have always laboured
  under the disadvantage of not knowing where he would turn up: this time that
  disadvantage is gone. We know exactly, and all we have to do is to wait for
  him. And this time," he added softly, "we are going to catch him. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>Hugh glanced round at all of us.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that Scott must decide."</p>

  <p>"Well, old birds," answered Freckles, "it seems to me that if five of us
  can't tackle this bloke, the addition of a couple of policemen isn't going to
  help much. I'm all for Mr. Matthews' suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Good," cried Hugh. "Then that's that. What do you want, Denny?"</p>

  <p>The butler had come out of the house in an obvious state of suppressed
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard sir, what they've found in the wood opposite Temple
  Tower?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Hugh quietly. "What?"</p>

  <p>"A dead man, sir. Hidden in the bushes. A terrible looking thing he was,
  so the postman told me&mdash;more like a great monkey than a man. They say
  that he has been stopping at Spragge's Farm."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two there was silence: then Victor Matthews spoke.</p>

  <p>"How was he killed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>And I think we all knew the answer before it came.</p>

  <p>"Murdered, sir, so I hear. From the marks round his neck they say he was
  strangled."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9"></a>IX. &mdash; IN WHICH I MEET "LE BOSSU MASQU&Eacute;"</h2>

  <p class="first">SO <i>le Rossignol</i> had been there after all. His dead
  body must have been quite close to us during the hour we had lain up waiting,
  before we found that the ladder had gone. And horrible and repulsive though
  he had been, I could not help feeling a twinge of pity for the poor brute. I
  could imagine him there in the darkness of the wood searching for the rope
  ladder he had made so laboriously, and then suddenly feeling the grip of the
  silent strangler on his throat. Perhaps that same choking cry that Gaspard
  had given &mdash;and then silence.</p>

  <p>"Your friend," said Hugh grimly, when the butler had gone, "is evidently
  no believer in half measures."</p>

  <p>Matthews was silent: this new development seemed to have nonplussed him.
  He paced up and down with quick, nervous steps, and a look of frowning
  concentration on his face,</p>

  <p>"This alters things, gentlemen," he said at length. "Now the police must
  come into the affair."</p>

  <p>"True," remarked Hugh. "At the same time, I don't see why we should run
  round telling them what we know. In fact, it makes it even more difficult to
  do so, because we lay ourselves open to grave blame for not having informed
  them about what we knew of the Nightingale's intentions."</p>

  <p>"That is so," said Matthews thoughtfully. "And as a matter of fact, it is
  even worse for me. Strictly speaking, if only as a matter of courtesy, I
  should have informed them of my presence here, and what I was doing. Instead
  of that, I am passing as an ordinary tourist. You are right. Captain
  Drummond. We must still say nothing about it. And there, going along the
  road, if I'm not mistaken, is the local inspector."</p>

  <p>Hugh started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'll get him in," he exclaimed, going towards the gate.</p>

  <p>"Please don't mention who I am," called Matthews after him, and Hugh
  nodded in answer.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Inspector," he hailed, "what's this I hear about someone being
  murdered?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right, sir," said the other gravely, halting by the gate. "Just
  come from there myself."</p>

  <p>"Come in and have a spot of ale," said Hugh, "and tell us all about it. I
  think you know Sir John, don't you? And these are three other friends of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"A bad business, gentlemen," said the Inspector, putting down his glass.
  "Very bad. And as far as I can see at present, there is no trace of a
  clue</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Hugh. "I've heard vaguely from my butler, who had
  heard vaguely from the postman."</p>

  <p>"It was Joe Mellor that found him, sir&mdash;him that keeps the dairy farm
  along the road there. Found him quite by accident, he did: or rather, not
  him, but his dog. He was walking past Temple Tower, and his dog was in the
  wood opposite. Suddenly it began to bark and make a rare blather, and Joe
  went in to see what was happening. He found the dog standing by some bushes,
  and, when he looked closer, he saw a man's leg sticking out. The rest of the
  body was carefully covered, and Joe tells me that he'd never have seen it but
  for the dog. He gives a pull on the leg and hauls out the body. Well,
  gentlemen, in the course of my life I've run across some pretty queer
  customers, but I give you my word that the dead man is the queerest. He don't
  look like a man at all: he looks like a great ape. A terrible face he's got,
  and not improved by the manner of his death. He was strangled, and the face
  is all red and puffy."</p>

  <p>"You've got no clue at all?" asked Hugh. "No idea who the man is?"</p>

  <p>"None at present, sir," answered the Inspector. "But I shall soon. Bill
  Matcham, who works down on the Marsh, happened to be passing, and the instant
  he saw him he recognised him as a man who had been lodging at Spragge's
  place. Maybe you know the farm, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Vaguely," said Hugh casually. "Somewhere down there, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He waved a comprehensive hand at the Marsh.</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir. And Spragge himself is a queer customer. Well, I don't
  mind if I do, sir." He took the refilled glass from Hugh. "Hot work this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Matthews speaking for the first time, "for how long had
  this man been dead?"</p>

  <p>"The doctor said somewhere about twelve hours, sir," answered the
  Inspector.</p>

  <p>"So it happened last night," cried Hugh, in affected surprise.</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir; last night sometime round about ten o'clock this man
  was strangled and his body hidden in the wood by Temple Tower."</p>

  <p>"You've got something in your mind, Inspector," said Hugh quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, we're all of us entitled to our thoughts, and maybe I have
  mine. Ever see anything of Mr. Granger, sir?"</p>

  <p>Hugh smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is, is it? I can't say I do, Inspector. I've met him out
  walking once or twice, that's all."</p>

  <p>"A queer gentleman, sir: very queer. Who ever heard before of a man coming
  to live in a place like this and fortifying his house with all them steel
  spikes and things, to say nothing of the bars all over the windows?"</p>

  <p>The worthy officer put down his glass and wiped his lips with the back of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, I must be going. This affair is going to keep me
  busy."</p>

  <p>"But surely you don't suspect that Mr. Granger had anything to do with it?
  " said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"I don't suspect no one, sir," answered the other. "All I say is that Mr.
  Granger is a queer customer, and this is a queer affair."</p>

  <p>"A most sapient conclusion," remarked Matthews with a faint smile as the
  gate shut behind the Inspector. "One wonders what the worthy man would think
  if he knew that a precisely similar corpse lay inside the
  fortifications."</p>

  <p>"One also wonders," said Hugh quietly, "what steps our Mr. Granger is
  going to take over that similar corpse."</p>

  <p>But any surmises on that point proved unnecessary, for at that moment who
  should appear at the gate but Miss Verney. Even at that distance one could
  see that she was in a state of great agitation, and she had left Temple Tower
  in such a hurry that she had come without a hat. And as she stood there for a
  moment the Inspector returned and joined her. Then they both came towards
  us.</p>

  <p>"She's found Gaspard's body," said Matthews with quiet conviction. "Be
  very careful what all of you say."</p>

  <p>And he proved to be right. It appeared that, going out after breakfast,
  the first thing that had struck her was that the dog's kennel was empty. And
  then, in the distance, she had seen the brute lying asleep as she thought.
  For a time she had watched it, ready to dart back to the house if it moved.
  But after a while it had struck her that from its attitude it couldn't be
  asleep: one hind leg was sticking straight up in the air, and she had
  approached it cautiously to find that it was dead,</p>

  <p>"I was so amazed," she went on, "that for a moment or two I just stood
  there staring at it. There was no sign of blood, or of any wound, and so I
  guessed it must have been poisoned. But who by? I had heard it baying
  furiously in the middle of the night, and then it suddenly stopped and there
  wasn't another sound. Still trying to puzzle it out, I walked on into the
  undergrowth. And there I found "&mdash;she grew a little white at the
  recollection, and her voice trembled&mdash;"the body of the servant Gaspard.
  He looked too awful, with his face all red and terrible. And I simply lost my
  head and flew to the gate and came here."</p>

  <p>"An extraordinarily wise proceeding, Miss Verney," said Hugh quietly.</p>

  <p>"May I ask who this young lady is?" said the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Miss Verney was engaged to do secretarial work for Mr. Granger," answered
  Freckles. "And her engagement is now terminated," he concluded firmly.</p>

  <p>"This is most extraordinary," said the Inspector, scratching his head with
  a pencil. "I must go back there at once. One inside and--"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Inspector," interrupted Hugh with a warning sign. "But Miss
  Verney is a bit tired at the moment. I'll stroll with you to the gate. Come
  along, Peter, There is no good upsetting her any more," he went on as we got
  out of ear-shot, "by telling her about the other."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, sir?" said the Inspector as we came to the
  road.</p>

  <p>"Well, from what Miss Verney said," remarked Hugh, "it would appear as if
  the servant Gaspard had also been strangled. And if that is so, the strong
  presumption is that the same man did both murders, and poisoned the dog."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded portentiously, and then lowered his voice
  impressively.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you, sir; what did I tell you? Mr. Granger is a queer
  customer."</p>

  <p>"Queer customer he may be," answered Hugh. "But one thing is as certain as
  that gate in front of us. He had nothing to do with the two murders. With his
  physique, he could no more have strangled Gaspard than he could have
  strangled me."</p>

  <p>"I don't say he did it, sir," said the other, "but you mark my words, he
  could tell a lot about it if he chose to."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if you're not right," said Hugh gravely. "Drop in
  on your way back and let us know if you find out anything."</p>

  <p>For a while we stood leaning over the gate, watching his retreating
  back.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Peter?" said Hugh suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It is one of the most extraordinary affairs I've ever heard of," I
  answered. "Even with Matthews' explanation it's amazing enough: without it,
  as the Inspector is, no wonder he is scratching his head. It's a mighty lucky
  thing that <i>le Bossu</i> missed him."</p>

  <p>"Mighty lucky," he agreed, lighting a cigarette. "He strikes me as being
  an extraordinarily sound sort of bloke. Extraordinarily sound," he repeated,
  as we started to walk back to the house. "In fact, I was proposing to ask him
  to come and stay here."</p>

  <p>"Not at all a bad idea," I agreed. "Then we're all on the spot
  together."</p>

  <p>We found him alone with John, the other two having disappeared somewhere,
  and Hugh at once proposed it.</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you. Captain Drummond," he said. "But, frankly
  speaking, I don't think there will be much staying."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said Hugh, looking puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Simply that matters have come to a head," he answered. "I am as certain
  as I can be of anything that <i>le Bossu</i> never intended to be in Rye to-
  day. He murdered <i>le Rossignol</i>, and then got into the grounds by the
  ladder, believing that, once he was inside. Sir John's plan would enable him
  to find the secret entrance. It didn't. Then the dog came for him and
  disturbed the household. Then Gaspard came, and he murdered him, once again
  believing that he would be able to get into the house&mdash;this time by the
  front door. And what defeated him was your sudden appearance. I know I've
  said much the same before, but when one is dealing with a man of his calibre
  there's no harm in being clear in one's head. He didn't mind in the slightest
  if these two murders were discovered after he had settled things with the
  Toad: but now the discovery has been made before the settlement. And that is
  why I say matters have come to a head and there won't be much staying before
  the end comes. We are going to find things moving at breakneck speed, and the
  only comfort is that even <i>le Bossu</i> can't do anything by day. But I
  think you can dismiss the idea of sleep at night for the next day or
  two."</p>

  <p>"That's not likely to worry us," said Hugh. "And I quite see your point.
  Still, the offer holds if you care to make this house your headquarters."</p>

  <p>"Thank you again," answered Matthews. "I won't bother to move my kit here,
  but if I may drop in when I want to I shall greatly appreciate it. And if I
  may stay now for a little lunch I should be most grateful."</p>

  <p>"Of course, my dear fellow," cried Hugh,</p>

  <p>And in view of our rather erratic time-table and hours at the moment, I'm
  rather in favour of a bit of food at once. It's twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>He shouted for Denny, who, accustomed as he was to Hugh's vagaries,
  betrayed no astonishment. And then, whilst we waited, we went on discussing
  from every angle what was likely to be the next move. With his previous
  knowledge of <i>le Bossu</i>, it was only natural that Victor Matthews should
  take the lead, but even he confessed himself beaten. How was the silent
  strangler to rectify his mistake?</p>

  <p>"<i>Le Bossu</i> knows," he said, "as every other criminal knows, that the
  English police, once they get their teeth into a thing, never let it go. They
  may chew slowly, but they chew surely. And he must know that the discovery of
  these two murders is going to make the police swarm round Temple Tower, which
  is the last place he wants them at. So what is he going to do? Because he'll
  do something: of that you can rest assured."</p>

  <p>And it is safe to say that not one of us there, in our wildest dreams,
  would have guessed what <i>le Bossu</i> did do that very afternoon&mdash;so
  staggering was it in its simplicity, so incredible in its ferocity. But of
  that in its proper place.</p>

  <p>Lunch was over, and the first problem to be settled was what the girl was
  to do. She, on hearing the whole story, was as keen as mustard on helping,
  but Freckles&mdash;in fact, all of us&mdash;were absolutely opposed to her
  returning to Temple Tower. She already knew, at any rate, one of the secret
  hiding-places of the stolen jewels, and though she offered to go back, we
  vetoed it unanimously. And, finally, it was decided that she should stop at
  Hugh's house for the present at any rate, with Freckles as her guard, an
  arrangement which seemed to satisfy everybody concerned. John had decided to
  motor back to Laidley Towers, returning again in the evening, and as soon as
  he heard that, Victor Matthews asked for a lift to Rye. He was of the opinion
  that developments might take place there in connection with the two murders,
  and he had decided, if necessary, to tell the police something, if not all,
  of what he had told us that morning. Later, John might pick him up on his way
  back.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Hugh?" I said.</p>

  <p>"I dunno, old lad," he answered. "Don't you worry about me."</p>

  <p>And sure enough he disappeared soon after lunch and I was left to my own
  resources.</p>

  <p>At first I tried to sleep, but I soon gave up the attempt. Sleep simply
  would not come, and after a while I decided to go for a walk. I gathered from
  Denny that there was a short cut over the fields which led to Rye, and with
  the idea of possibly getting a lift back in John's car I struck out along it.
  There was always a chance, I thought, of finding out something, and if not,
  Rye was a town well worth exploring.</p>

  <p>It was a drowsily warm afternoon, and I walked slowly, my thoughts full of
  Matthews' astounding story. It seemed wellnigh unbelievable that this amazing
  crime of a generation ago should have its denouement in such a peaceful
  English setting. Who was he&mdash;this sinister being&mdash;who had baffled
  the whole French police force? Had we seen him in the Dolphin the night
  before? Was he the clergyman, as Hugh had half suggested? Futile surmises: if
  Matthews didn't know, it was hardly likely that I should. But the problem
  haunted me: I couldn't get it out of my thoughts. And suddenly I arrived at a
  decision. I would stroll round Rye, and then go to the Dolphin for tea. With
  luck I might find the little room empty, in which case I would investigate
  the fireplace, and see if there was anything in Hugh's theory. It could do no
  harm, and it gave me an object for the afternoon. Possibly even, I might
  solve the problem of the identity of <i>le Bossu</i> himself.</p>

  <p>A neighbouring clock struck three, and shortly after I reached the
  outskirts of the town. I strolled aimlessly round, looking into old curiosity
  shops for about half an hour: then, striking up the hill, I made for the
  Dolphin. Once I thought I saw Victor Matthews in the distance, but I wasn't
  sure, and I wondered how his line of inquiries was progressing.</p>

  <p>The hall was deserted when I entered: so, fortunately, was the little
  room. And I made a dive at once for the fireplace. It was, as I have already
  said, an enormous affair, in which it was easy to stand with one's head and
  shoulders up the flue. I peered upwards, but could see nothing. Evidently
  there was a jink in the chimney which stopped the light. At any rate there
  was only blackness to be seen.</p>

  <p>"Do you require tea, sir?"</p>

  <p>I emerged hurriedly, to find a waiter staring at me.</p>

  <p>"Please," I said, feeling remarkably foolish. "A wonderful fireplace,
  this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. It is very famous."</p>

  <p>He stalked from the room, leaving me with the uncomfortable feeling that
  he regarded me with grave suspicion. Admittedly the beauties of the fireplace
  were best seen from the outside: at the same time I failed to see any reason
  why I shouldn't stand inside it if I wished to. However, having satisfied
  himself on his return that the fireplace was still there, he thawed somewhat
  under the influence of a substantial tip.</p>

  <p>"Hotel pretty full?" I said casually.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. They comes and goes," he answered. "Week-ends we're always full
  up, but we've got some rooms now if you want one."</p>

  <p>His interest waned when he found I didn't, and after a while he drifted
  away to some new arrivals in the hall. They were obviously American tourists
  motoring through, and therefore could be given a clean bill of health as far
  as I was concerned. Presumably, also, the waiter might be excluded, though
  his case was not quite so certain. I had already made up my mind that the
  most unlikely person would prove to be the man we wanted, and that even women
  must not be ruled out. After all, men had masqueraded in female clothes
  before now.</p>

  <p>Other people came drifting in, and I eyed them all like a lynx. And then,
  after a while, the absurdity of the proceeding struck me: how could I
  possibly know? It was more than likely that <i>le Bossu</i> had already left
  the hotel, even assuming he had ever been there.</p>

  <p>Suddenly my interest revived: Vandali and the girl had come into the hall.
  For a moment or two they seemed undecided as to where they would sit: then
  they turned and came into the little room. The girl swept past me as if
  unconscious of my existence, but Vandali gave me a curt bow.</p>

  <p>"Been doing any more botanising?" he said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Been getting the Yuletide welcome at Temple Tower again?" I returned.</p>

  <p>He paused and stared at me, and I thought for a moment that he was going
  to have an actual discussion. Then apparently he thought better of it and he
  passed on and joined the girl. I picked up a paper and pretended to read. It
  was a day old but I wanted a screen from behind which I could study them.
  They had begun to talk in low tones, and it was impossible to hear more than
  an odd word or two. But it seemed to me that he was urging some line of
  action on her, and that she was opposed to it. What it was I had no idea, but
  once I distinctly heard him mention the word "police." I strained my ears,
  but they were sitting too far away. Only it became increasingly obvious that
  there was a fundamental difference of opinion between them over something,
  and that neither could apparently convert the other.</p>

  <p>I laid down the paper and lit a cigarette. There did not seem to be much
  object in waiting any longer. I could not move closer to them without making
  things obvious, and they were evidently not going to raise their voices. And
  I was on the point of getting up when some dirt fell down the chimney at the
  end of the room and lay in a little heap on the whitened hearthstone. A very
  ordinary phenomenon, and yet&mdash;was it? I felt my pulse begin to go a
  little quicker. Had that dirt fallen naturally, or had it been disturbed by
  something? Was the hidden listener even now at his post? And yet how could he
  be unless he was in the room?</p>

  <p>The other two had noticed nothing. For about five minutes they continued
  their conversation: then, shrugging his shoulders irritably, the man got up
  and left the room, whilst the girl picked up an illustrated weekly. In a
  fever of impatience I waited for her to go too: I wanted to have another look
  up the chimney. But apparently she had no intention of following her
  companion's example, and after a time she took out her cigarette-case.</p>

  <p>I watched her out of the corner of my eye, as she began to hunt in her bag
  for a match. And it suddenly struck me that the opportunity was too good to
  miss.</p>

  <p>"Allow me," I said, rising and striking one for her.</p>

  <p>She thanked me, and a little to my surprise she laid down her paper as if
  quite ready to talk.</p>

  <p>"A ghastly affair," I said, "these two murders."</p>

  <p>"Two!" she cried, staring at me blankly. "Two!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "One outside, and one inside the grounds of Temple
  Tower."</p>

  <p>And now it was obvious that not only was the information a surprise to
  her, but it was a very agitating surprise.</p>

  <p>"I heard of one," she said, "the one outside. But, tell me, who was
  murdered inside?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granger's servant&mdash;a man called Gaspard. It appears that both
  men were strangled."</p>

  <p>"But this is amazing," she cried. "You're sure it wasn't Mr. Granger who
  was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," I said. "The police are investigating both crimes
  now."</p>

  <p>A look of relief appeared on her face, though her bewilderment was still
  obvious, and I tried to read the situation by the light of my inside
  knowledge of the Vandalis' plans. The reason for the relief was clear: it
  would have complicated things for them considerably if Granger had been
  dead.</p>

  <p>"It is incredible," she said once again. "Who on earth killed the man
  outside?"</p>

  <p>"The same person presumably who killed the one inside," I answered, but
  her remark, phrased as it was, threw a sudden ray of light on what she was
  thinking and the reason for her surprise at my news. Evidently she must have
  assumed that <i>le Rossignol</i> had been murdered by Gaspard. And the
  information that Gaspard himself was dead completely nonplussed her. So much
  was apparent: what was not clear was whether or not she knew of <i>le
  Bossu</i>. Her expression at the moment seemed to be that of a person who had
  heard an inexplicable piece of news: but surely if she knew of <i>le
  Bossu</i> the matter ceased to be inexplicable at once. And as we continued
  to discuss the thing, I began more and more to feel sure that she did not
  know of the silent strangler. Which only tended to make it more baffling.</p>

  <p>If Hugh's surmise was right: if our plans had been overheard by someone
  listening in the chimney, and if, further, the Vandalis' room was the one
  overhead, something must be wrong somewhere. He had put his theory forward
  when the idea was that the person who had heard our plans was the very woman
  I was talking to. Of course, it might well be that there was no one there at
  the moment, and that the dirt had fallen accidentally. And even as I thought
  so, some more fell down the chimney and lay in a little heap on the whitened
  hearthstone.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," I said, suddenly conscious that she had asked a
  question and was expecting an answer. "I didn't quite catch your remark."</p>

  <p>"I asked if you knew anything about this man Granger?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I fear I am only a stranger here," I answered lightly. "He seems a man of
  curious disposition."</p>

  <p>"Is it worthwhile," she said coldly, "lying in quite such a stupid
  fashion? A man does not go and conceal himself beside the road on a hot
  summer's day for fun."</p>

  <p>"Is it worthwhile," I answered equally coldly, "calling a man a liar until
  you are quite certain of your facts? The reason for my concealment, as you
  call it, was simple. Mr. Granger has recently engaged a secretary. She
  happens to be the fiancee of the youngster who was with me. And in view of
  the type of house it had been arranged that she should throw a letter over
  the wall telling him if she was all right. Hence our presence there."</p>

  <p>She stared at me suspiciously, but with the serene confidence of having
  told the truth&mdash;or very nearly&mdash;I returned the look blandly.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that that is all you were there for?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"What else is there to be there for?" I countered.</p>

  <p>"A man doesn't fortify himself like that unless he is afraid of
  something," she said.</p>

  <p>"Some such idea had occurred to me," I agreed.</p>

  <p>For a while she smoked in silence: then she seemed to come to a sudden
  decision.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he is afraid of? " she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Presumably the entrance of callers," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Shall we cease to beat about the bush. Monsieur?" she said quietly. "For
  I really cannot believe that your ignorance is quite so profound as you make
  out."</p>

  <p>"If it enabled me to talk a little longer with you, Madame," I replied, "I
  would wish it were even more profound."</p>

  <p>She waved aside the clumsy compliment with a frown .</p>

  <p>"You know who the man is who was found murdered in the wood." The remark
  was a statement, not a question.</p>

  <p>"Let us suppose for the moment that I do. What then?"</p>

  <p>"Why, then you must know everything," she cried irritably. "Why not come
  out into the open. Monsieur? There is plenty for all of us. And now that he
  is dead there is no hurry. We can take our time."</p>

  <p>At last her meaning was clear, and with it the absolute certainty that she
  was ignorant of the existence of <i>le Bossu</i>. She believed that, with the
  murder of <i>le Rossignol</i>, the only people left to share the reward for
  the stolen property were themselves and us. But one thing it seemed to me she
  had overlooked even from her own point of view.</p>

  <p>"Madame," I remarked, "we agreed, I think, that the object of the
  fortification was to keep out callers, and it would not appear to have been
  successful. Someone must have been inside the grounds last night."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," she said, staring me straight in the face. "And that someone
  must have been a very powerful man. Almost as powerful as your friend who was
  in here a night or two ago."</p>

  <p>For a moment I did not take her meaning.</p>

  <p>Then it suddenly dawned on me, and I burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," I cried, "you surely are not accusing us of having pulled
  off a double murder, are you? That is a bit too rich altogether."</p>

  <p>She rose without answering, and with a feeling of relief I realised she
  was going. There was nothing more to be gained by prolonging the
  conversation, and I wanted to have another look up the chimney. It was
  certainly not my intention to enlighten her over <i>le Bossu</i>, and if she
  chose to pretend to me that she thought we had murdered Gaspard and <i>le
  Rossignol</i>, she was quite at liberty to do so.</p>

  <p>I watched her step out into the hall, and stand there for a moment or two
  as if undecided where to go: then she turned and ascended the stairs. And I,
  after a swift look round to make sure I was unobserved, made a dart for the
  chimney. And this time it was not all darkness: Hugh was right.</p>

  <p>About six feet above my head was a square opening through which a faint
  light was filtering. And even as I stared at it something moved behind it,
  and I saw a pair of savage eyes staring down into mine. Then they were gone,
  and I stepped out into the room again.</p>

  <p>My pulse was beating a shade faster than usual, but my brain was perfectly
  cool. What was the next move? That those eyes had belonged to <i>le Bossu</i>
  Masqu&eacute; himself I felt sure, but what was going to happen now? According to
  Hugh, the Vandalis' room was above us, and Madame Vandali had just gone
  upstairs. So that she would be bound to find him, and what then? Because,
  from my reading of the case, she didn't know of his existence.</p>

  <p>I waited&mdash;but there was no sound. Then I took another look up the
  chimney, but this time all was darkness. And after a while another thought
  struck me. If, as I believed, the Vandalis did not know about him, would he
  have dared to go into their room?</p>

  <p>I went quickly out into the hall and looked upstairs. True enough. Number
  18 was over the little room where we had been talking, and so far Hugh was
  right. But he had not seen the position of the opening in the chimney, and I
  had. And I saw at once that that opening could not have been made from Number
  18, but must have come from the room next it. Number 19 was <i>le Bossu</i>'s
  room&mdash;not 18. The door was shut, and for a moment I had an insane
  impulse to stroll casually up the stairs, open the door, and walk in. I could
  pretend I had come into the wrong room by mistake, and he could not do me any
  harm in the Dolphin.</p>

  <p>However, I decided against it, and walked over to the Visitors' Book.
  There was the entry right enough: " H. Thomas, London. No. 19."</p>

  <p>"I see you have a Mr. Thomas staying here," I said to the girl. "I wonder
  if that is the Harold Thomas I used to play golf with? Is he a big man with a
  slight stoop?"</p>

  <p>"He is a biggish man, but I don't think he stoops," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Fair moustache?" I asked,</p>

  <p>"I think he is clean shaven," she replied. "I really couldn't say for
  sure. But I expect he will be back for dinner."</p>

  <p>He is not in the hotel, then?" I said quietly. No. I haven't seen him all
  day."</p>

  <p>She turned to a new arrival, and I went back into the annex. What was to
  be done now? That the man who called himself Thomas was in the hotel I knew.
  But it was manifestly impossible for me to tell the girl how I knew it. If a
  man lays claim to having seen eyes peering at him out of chimneys, his
  audience is more than likely to make rude insinuations concerning alcohol.
  And yet it was utterly imperative that, somehow or other, I should see inside
  Number 19. How to do it: that was the problem.</p>

  <p>I wandered restlessly back into the hall: what about sitting down in a
  spot which commanded a view of the room? And to my amazement I found, on
  looking up, that the door was open. Mechanically I ordered a whisky and soda:
  how did that fact affect things? Did it mean that the owner of Number 19 had
  gone out in reality, or what?</p>

  <p>I finished my drink, and as I laid down the glass I came to a decision. I
  would go up and walk straight into the room. If there was any unpleasantness
  I could pretend that I thought it was my mythical Harold Thomas and apologise
  for my intrusion. But I should have seen the man we wanted: and that, so it
  seemed to me, was worth a big risk.</p>

  <p>There was no one about, and so, putting a bold face on it, I walked
  straight up the stairs. Then for a moment I admit I hesitated: visions of
  being arrested as an hotel thief floated before me. But I banished them, and
  with a preliminary knock on the door, I went into Number 19.</p>

  <p>There was no one in it, and I glanced quickly round. A weather-beaten
  suitcase stood in one corner: on the bed lay a pair of pyjamas. A man's
  toilet accessories&mdash;hair brushes, shaving gear, and the
  like&mdash;adorned the dressing-table. In fact, it was without exception the
  least suspicious looking room I have even been in. And then I suddenly became
  aware of a most peculiar noise. It came from the next room, and it sounded as
  if someone was drumming with his feet on the partition wall. It came
  fitfully, and then, after a while, it died away altogether, save for an
  occasional bump.</p>

  <p>With its cessation I pulled myself together: there was no good my
  remaining there now that I had found the room empty. The bluff about Mr.
  Harold Thomas was all very well, but not having found him at home there was
  no excuse for my remaining in his room. I must go down and resume my watch in
  the hall.</p>

  <p>And even as I came to that conclusion I happened to look in the glass in
  front of me. I could see over my shoulder the room behind me.</p>

  <p>The door was slowly shutting. With a great effort I forced myself to look
  round. Evidently Mr. Thomas had returned.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't Mr. Thomas. Standing almost on top of me was a masked
  figure, that in the fading light seemed of monstrous size. In a flash I took
  in the hump on his back, realised it was <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> himself, and
  then his hands shot out and he got my throat. I struggled wildly, and I am
  not generally considered a weakling. But in that man's hands I might have
  been a child. The silent strangler had got me.</p>

  <p>Soon there came a roaring in my ears, and still the grip held. I was
  losing consciousness: he was throttling me. And the last thing I remember
  before everything went black was the look of fierce triumph in his eyes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>X. &mdash; IN WHICH "LE BOSSU" RETRIEVES HIS ERROR</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN I came to myself, for a moment or two I could recall
  nothing. Then in a wave it all came back to me. Once again I saw that
  terrible figure crouching over me, and felt those vicelike hands on my
  throat.</p>

  <p>Feeling a little dazed and sick, I scrambled to my feet. Of my assailant,
  there was no sign: the room was empty. And then another thing struck me: the
  kit that had been lying about was no longer there. Everything had gone,
  including the suitcase.</p>

  <p>For a while I sat on the bed trying to pull myself together. My neck was
  most infernally sore: undoubtedly <i>le Bossu</i> well deserved his second
  nickname of the Strangler. Because it was useless to blind myself to the fact
  that had he wished to kill me he could easily have done so. Luckily he had
  not so wished, and I was still alive, but it was not due to any prowess on my
  part. He had decided to make me unconscious whilst he packed his things and
  left the hotel, and had calmly proceeded to do so.</p>

  <p>I glanced at my watch: it was seven o'clock. I had been unconscious for
  roughly an hour. And it was as I replaced it in my pocket that my eye was
  caught by a big piece of folded paper lying half under the bed. I picked it
  up mechanically, and opened it out. And then, for a time, I stood gazing at
  it, literally unable to believe my eyes. It was the actual plan of Temple
  Tower which had been stolen from Laidley Towers the preceding night. I turned
  it over: on the back were written some lines in pencil.</p>

  <p>I crossed to the window to examine it better: then, on second thoughts, I
  crammed it in my pocket. There would be plenty of time to study it later: the
  immediate necessity was to get out of the room. I calculated that he must
  have dropped it inadvertently when packing, and once he discovered his loss
  he would almost certainly return for it. And I had no wish whatever to
  encounter the gentleman by myself again. True, I could accuse him of half
  murdering me, but who was there to prove it? A stiff neck gives no outward
  and visible sign of its existence; it would only be my word against his.
  Whereas it would be obvious to all concerned that I was in a room where I had
  no right to be.</p>

  <p>I opened the door cautiously and peered out. And with a sigh of relief I
  saw that no one was about. Even if I was seen leaving the room I should
  render myself liable to suspicion, but luck was with me. And ten seconds
  later I was in the hall again, with the precious plan in my pocket. There was
  no hurry now: I could afford to take my time. And the best thing to do, it
  struck me, was to inquire into Mr. Thomas' movements. So I walked over to the
  office.</p>

  <p>"By the way," I said to the girl, "has Mr. Thomas returned yet?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thomas paid his bill and left half an hour ago," she said. "He didn't
  say anything about coming back."</p>

  <p>"I must have misunderstood his plans," I remarked. "Did he say if he was
  returning to London?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say anything," said the girl. "But he can't get back to London
  to-night from here. The last train has gone."</p>

  <p>I thanked her and let the subject drop. There was nothing more to be got
  out of her, and it seemed to me that she was already looking at me a little
  curiously. What had happened was clear. After laying me out he had calmly
  packed his kit and walked out of the hotel. And we were none of us any nearer
  knowing what he looked like than we were before. That was the sickening part
  of it. But I'd got the plan, and that was worth half a dozen stiff necks. I
  sat down in a secluded spot and ordered the largest whisky and the smallest
  soda that the hotel could produce. Then I pulled the precious piece of
  parchment out of my pocket and proceeded to examine it.</p>

  <p>The plan itself was dated MLXXXII, which I calculated as 1532. And though
  my history was extremely rusty, I worked that date out as being in the reign
  of Henry the Eighth. It showed the original house of Temple Tower, though, of
  course, not under that name, and the guarding wall. It also showed another
  building situated about a hundred yards from the house, which I assumed must
  have been the now non-existent chapel. Connecting the two buildings from
  outside wall to outside wall, there ran the secret passage clearly marked on
  the plan. So that, at first sight, it appeared that once one was inside the
  grounds, with a tape measure, the entrance to the passage would be easy to
  locate.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Darrell, where did you get that?"</p>

  <p>I glanced up quickly, to find John James regarding me in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" I said. "Here's your bally old plan."</p>

  <p>"So I see," he cried. "I didn't think it was a copy of the <i>Pink
  'Un</i>. But how did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down," I remarked, "and order the necessary. I could do with another.
  And I will tell you the doings."</p>

  <p>"What's stung your face, laddie?" he said. "It looks kind of fixed in
  position."</p>

  <p>"It is," I answered. "And it's all part of the doings."</p>

  <p>He sat down, and I told him briefly what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned," he muttered, when I'd finished. "He's a cool customer.
  However, let's get back to the old plan. Turn it over, and we'll see what is
  on the other side."</p>

  <p>The writing was crabbed and old-fashioned, and being in pencil, the words
  were none too easy to decipher. But at last we managed to make them out.</p>

  <p style="text-indent=0; margin-left:25%"><i>When tower and eastern turret
  come in line, a tree is found.</i><br>
  <i>Thirty long paces north, and in the ground</i><br>
  <i>The answer lies. But should you hear the sound</i><br>
  <i>Of turning wheels&mdash;beware.</i></p>

  <p>"Seems helpful," he murmured. "The only drawback is that we've got to get
  inside the grounds to make use of it. Moreover, we've got to get in by
  day."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two I did not get his meaning.</p>

  <p>"At night we probably shouldn't be able to see the bally turret," he
  explained.</p>

  <p>"But look here," I said, "this bit of doggerel is only a repetition of the
  information in the plan. There's the passage clearly marked."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong," he answered positively. "The plan only shows
  the spot where the passage passed underneath the old outside wall. The actual
  entrance was somewhere inside the chapel, just as the entrance the other end
  is somewhere inside Temple Tower."</p>

  <p>"Then it seems to me," I remarked, "that I've got a stiff neck for
  nothing. For I'm darned if I can see how we're going to get into the place by
  day."</p>

  <p>"It's just possible that the girl might be able to help us there," he said
  thoughtfully. "Scott's girl, I mean. She'll have to go back for her kit, and
  then she ought to have no difficulty in spotting the tree, and marking it for
  us somehow. Anyway," he continued after a pause, "what do we do now,
  sergeant-major? There doesn't seem much good our sitting on here."</p>

  <p>"Let's give it a little longer," I said. "I feel there is a bare
  possibility of our friend returning to find this. And it would be a pity to
  miss the blighter."</p>

  <p>"Right ho!" he agreed. "As long as you like as far as I'm concerned. But
  my own opinion is that he's not going to come back for that. Why should he?
  He's read the verse at the back, and it's not difficult to remember. So that
  the plan is of no more use to him now, any more than it is to us."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," I said. "Let's give it ten minutes or so, and then
  we'll push back for dinner."</p>

  <p>I replaced the plan in my pocket, and lit a cigarette, whilst he got
  up.</p>

  <p>"I'll wander down to the station," he said, "and get an evening paper.
  Then, if you're ready, we'll toddle when I get back."</p>

  <p>He strolled out, leaving me to finish my drink. The lounge was empty, and
  the soft evening light slanting through the old-fashioned windows gave it a
  particularly peaceful aspect. Then four men, two of whom I recognised as
  golfers of Walker Cup repute, came in talking shop. And I wondered idly what
  they would think if I butted into their conversation.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," I might say, "interrupting your dissertation on putting, but
  have you seen a masked hunchback lying about anywhere? Because I've just been
  very nearly strangled by one."</p>

  <p>I began to chuckle inwardly as I imagined their expressions. And yet it
  was true, damn it, it was true. It wasn't a dream, and it wasn't an attack of
  delirium tremens. Then the clergyman came in, with the two elderly ladies in
  tow, and one of the golfers, who had abandoned his hobby for the latest from
  the Stock Exchange, lowered his voice discreetly.</p>

  <p>I lit another cigarette and wondered if by any chance <i>le Bossu</i>
  would return. Probably John James was right, and he wouldn't. And even if he
  did, unless he actually walked into Number 19, how should I know him? I
  glanced upstairs once again, and as I did so I suddenly remembered that
  strange drumming noise that I had heard before <i>le Bossu</i> attacked me.
  It had come from Number 18, the Vandalis' room, and I began wondering what
  had caused it. It had been such a peculiar noise, unlike anything that I
  could recall having heard before. It had sounded almost as if someone was
  knocking on the wall with a mallet.</p>

  <p>Could it have been a signal of some sort? If so, it must have been
  intended for <i>le Bossu</i> himself, and that proved at once that I was
  wrong, and the three of them were in collusion. But then, if that were the
  case, why bother to signal, when all that was necessary was to walk into the
  room and talk?</p>

  <p>After a while I gave it up: like so many other things in this
  extraordinary affair, there seemed to be a dozen different possibilities.
  Presumably, in time, we should arrive at some result, but at the moment I
  felt I couldn't see the forest for the trees.</p>

  <p>The door swung open, and I looked up hoping it was John James. I was
  beginning to agree with him that there was but little object in remaining any
  longer. But it proved to be the Inspector, and with him a shrewd-looking
  red-haired young man with journalist written all over him, who paused the
  instant he saw me, and then came over and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Darrell," he said. "You've forgotten me: on the
  <i>Folkestone Courier</i>. You were good enough to give me an interview when
  you were playing for Middlesex in the Canterbury Cricket Week two years ago.
  Extraordinary affair this, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I agreed. "What did you find out. Inspector? You were just going
  to Temple Tower when you left us this morning."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Of course," he said, "you were with Captain Drummond. Just for the
  moment I did not recognise you. Well, sir, you'll understand that I can't say
  much. Though, to tell you the truth," he added ruefully, "I haven't got much
  to say. I'm defeated&mdash;for the moment only, of course."</p>

  <p>"Quite," I agreed gravely. "You found out nothing from Mr. Granger
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"Practically nothing," he admitted. "It took me the best part of half an
  hour to force my way in. I rang the bell again and again, and nothing
  happened. Finally a woman came to the gate, and I told her that unless she
  opened it I would have it broken down: that a murder had been committed in
  the grounds, and that by law I must investigate. As soon as I said that she
  turned as white as a sheet, and opened the gate.</p>

  <p>"'A murder!' she stammered. 'Who's been murdered?'</p>

  <p>"Now, she wasn't lying: I have enough knowledge of human nature to know
  that. She knew nothing about it: of that I am convinced. She shut the gate
  and bolted it: then she followed behind me. And when we came to the body she
  let out a scream and nearly fainted. I don't blame her, for the dead man was
  her husband. He was strangled just like the other, and he was not a pretty
  sight.</p>

  <p>"However, to cut a long story short, I left her weeping and moaning and
  made tracks for the house and Mr. Granger. It took me the best part of
  another half hour to get in there: he kept peering at me through a hole in
  the door. Finally, he opened it, and then bolted it again as soon as I was
  in.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want?' he said in a whining sort of voice.</p>

  <p>"I told him, and I'll eat my hat if he wasn't as surprised as the
  woman.</p>

  <p>"'Two,' he kept on croaking. 'Two men killed! Gaspard&mdash;and who was
  the other? Who was the other?'</p>

  <p>"He clawed at my arm, as I described the other, and a look of relief came
  over his face.</p>

  <p>"'That's one of them, at any rate,' he muttered.</p>

  <p>"'Look here,' I said sternly, 'there's more in this than meets the eye,
  Mr. Granger. And you know more about it than you are telling me. How comes it
  that these two men are strangled, one inside your grounds and one just
  outside? Somebody must have done it: do you know who?'</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't say any more: Just shut up like an oyster.</p>

  <p>"'You'll be subpoenaed for the inquest,' I warned him. ' And then you'll
  be on oath, don't forget. Someone was in your grounds last night, and that
  someone did the murders. Moreover, I believe you know who that someone was!
  '</p>

  <p>"But he just went on muttering and mumbling to himself, and finally I left
  him. There wasn't anything more to be got out of him for the moment: the man
  seemed half crazy to me. But we'll make him speak at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Did you go and see Spragge?" I asked as the Inspector paused.</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;later," he answered. "And I did not get much out of him. He
  identified the body of the man in the wood as the man who had been staying
  with him. And all he could tell me was that yesterday, about six o'clock, a
  note was delivered at his farm by a small boy for the lodger&mdash;a note
  which threw him into a terrible state of agitation. He says he went out about
  eight-thirty and that is the last he's seen of him."</p>

  <p>"Very strange," said the red-haired young man. "But good copy. Dead dog:
  two men strangled&mdash;one inside, one out. Very strange. I suppose you are
  absolutely certain it couldn't have been this man Granger himself?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said the Inspector. "He hasn't got the strength."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;who did it?" demanded the journalist. "That is the point."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," I mildly remarked, "that is the point."</p>

  <p>"Has the doctor decided which was killed first?" asked the journalist.</p>

  <p>"The one outside," said the Inspector. "Two or three hours before the
  other."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried the other. "Then we arrive at this conclusion, anyway."</p>

  <p>He talked on: he was the type of man who would talk on for ever and ever,
  but I hardly heard what he was saying. It seemed almost impossible to realise
  that I could, in a sentence, explain to them the whole baffling mystery. And
  not for the first time did the worrying thought return to me: were we
  justified in withholding our information? True, I saw the difficulties that
  confronted us: what were we to say without incriminating ourselves? Still,
  the thought kept coming back, and try as I would, I could not quite pacify my
  conscience.</p>

  <p>I glanced round the hall. The four golfers had risen, and I watched them
  idly as they reached the top of the stairs and stood for a moment laughing
  and talking. They moved aside to let a maid, with a can of hot water in her
  hand, pass them, and I remember asking myself if it were possible to imagine
  a more prosaic scene. The quiet English inn&mdash;the routine unvaried for
  years. And I remember my thoughts because of the sudden amazing change.
  Tranquillity, order, peace&mdash;and then, in a second, a screaming,
  hysterical girl standing in the open doorway of Number 18, while the hot
  water dripped from the overturned can into the hall below.</p>

  <p>For a second or two no one moved: the thing was so utterly unexpected as
  to be paralysing. The golfers, with their mouths open, stared at her dazedly:
  so did we. Then, simultaneously, the power of action returned to all of us. I
  dashed upstairs behind the Inspector and the journalist, a thousand wild
  thoughts in my head. But the wildest of those thoughts had not prepared me
  for the ghastly sight that met my eyes as we entered the room.</p>

  <p>Hanging to one of the old oak beams was Vandali. A glance at his purple,
  swollen face was sufficient: the man was dead. His body sagged grotesquely,
  almost touching the wall that separated the room from Number 19. And with a
  sick sort of feeling, I realised that the strange drumming noise I had heard
  had been made by the poor devil's heels as he died. At his feet lay an
  overturned chair; evidently he had stood on it, and then kicked it away from
  underneath him. I heard the others talking in low tones: caught snatches of
  what they were saying: "Poor devil," "Hanged himself," "Where is the woman?":
  the disjointed phrases seemed to come from a long way off, and after a time I
  escaped downstairs.</p>

  <p>Why had Vandali hanged himself? The question hammered at my brain. True, I
  knew nothing about the man: all that I could say was that! had seen him a
  couple of hours previously apparently quite happy and contented. What on
  earth had happened to make him commit suicide?</p>

  <p>Then another thought struck me. When Madame Vandali left me she had gone
  upstairs. At the utmost, only a quarter of an hour had elapsed before I went
  to <i>le Bossu</i>'s room. Therefore, whatever had caused the tragedy must
  have taken place during that quarter of an hour, because it was impossible to
  think that she could have found him hanging and said nothing about it. Had
  they had some terrible quarrel, as a result of which she had left him and he
  had then committed suicide?</p>

  <p>It seemed almost incredible that such a thing could have happened in so
  short a time. And yet what other conceivable solution was there? Something
  must have happened during that quarter of an hour to make the man kill
  himself, and the only person who would be able to throw any light on what
  that something had been was the woman.</p>

  <p>But was she? Like a blinding flash, the thought struck me. Was she? When I
  had first peered up the chimney, I had stared into <i>le Bossu's</i> eyes:
  the next time the opening was shut. And when I had gone into his room, it was
  empty. Where had he been during that fateful quarter of an hour? Did that
  supply the cause of the quarrel? Was it the eternal triangle once again?</p>

  <p>I tried to fit a possible solution on those lines round the facts as I
  knew them. No one knew what <i>le Bossu</i> looked like: quite possibly he
  was a good looking, attractive man. Suppose, then, that he was an old lover
  of Madame Vandali, she being ignorant of the manner of man he was. Suppose he
  had suddenly confronted her, and she had determined at once to leave Vandali.
  Would that do? And honesty compelled me to admit that if it did, it was only
  by the barest margin. It meant that in a few minutes she had made up her
  mind, and left the hotel without packing, having first reduced Vandali to
  such a condition of hopelessness that he took his own life. Thin; altogether
  too thin. And yet the whole thing was so inexplicable that one could not
  disregard even the most wildly improbable solution.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is all this excitement?"</p>

  <p>I looked up to find that John James had returned and was staring up at the
  landing with a bewildered look on his face. I told him, and he sat down
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said. "What did he do it for?"</p>

  <p>"It is what I have been asking myself ever since it was discovered," I
  answered. "The whole thing is so utterly incredible that if I hadn't seen it
  with my own eyes I should hardly believe it. Well, Inspector, mysteries
  accumulate at Rye."</p>

  <p>"I dunno as there's much mystery about this, sir," he remarked, crossing
  the hall to us. "Just a plain case of suicide. Good-evening, Sir John."</p>

  <p>"'Evening, Inspector. Nothing to account for it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir. I've asked the manager, and he can't tell me anything. A
  charming wife, lots of money; and, apparently, not a care in the world."</p>

  <p>And at that moment the manager himself, looking anxious and worried, came
  up.</p>

  <p>"A terrible thing. Sir John," he cried. "I wouldn't have had it happen in
  this hotel for the world. The scandal: and you know what people are. I don't
  suppose I'll be able to let that room again for months."</p>

  <p>"By the way," I remarked, "I wonder if you can tell me anything about a
  Mr. Thomas who was staying here. The girl in the office tells me he has just
  gone, and I was wondering if it was a man I met a little while ago. He had
  Number 19."</p>

  <p>But he shook his head, and looked at me as if surprised that so irrelevant
  a detail could be introduced at such a moment.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I do not," he said. "I believe I saw him when he arrived, but I
  don't remember having seen him since. And, anyway, this dreadful affair has
  driven everything else out of my head."</p>

  <p>He bustled away as the doctor came down the stairs, as if he still vainly
  hoped to hear something that would lessen the tragedy. And then, in a
  feverish attempt to restore things to their normal time-table, he pealed the
  dinner-gong loudly. Gradually the lounge emptied, though there was only one
  topic of conversation to be heard on every side. And at length I was left
  alone with John and the doctor.</p>

  <p>There seemed no object in staying, and yet I was loath to go. I could not
  help thinking that there must be some further development; that Madame
  Vandali must return or the man who called himself Thomas. But as the time
  went on and nothing more happened, it seemed useless waiting any longer. And
  we were on the point of going when the further development occurred. Only
  this time it was not an hysterical chamber-maid, but the Inspector,
  whitefaced, who stood on the landing outside Number 18.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he called hoarsely. "For God's sake come quick."</p>

  <p>The doctor ran up the stairs, and almost mechanically we followed him.
  What fresh horror had taken place in that ill-omened room? On the bed lay the
  motionless body of Vandali, covered with a sheet, but it was not at that we
  any of us looked. For the cupboard door was open and on the floor was the
  huddled-up body of a woman. It was Madame Vandali, and she, too, was
  dead.</p>

  <p>But in this case there was no question of suicide: it was murder. The mark
  around her throat was plain to see: she had been strangled.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" muttered John shakily, "this is a bit grim."</p>

  <p>"I was going through his effects," said the Inspector, "and happened to
  open that door."</p>

  <p>"Lift her out carefully," ordered the doctor. "Though it is obvious
  nothing can be done."</p>

  <p>He mopped his forehead, and furiously ordered away two waiters from the
  door, who were looking in with wide-open mouths.</p>

  <p>As he said, it was obvious that nothing could be done. The unfortunate
  woman was quite dead. Her face, too, was puffed and swollen, though not quite
  so badly as the man's.</p>

  <p>"Throttled!" said the doctor shakily. "Throttled to death, poor soul."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but who by?" wailed the manager.</p>

  <p>The poor little man, completely unnerved by this second tragedy, was
  standing by the door wringing his hands. And it was left to the red-haired
  journalist, who had mysteriously appeared from nowhere, to supply the
  answer.</p>

  <p>"Him," he said, pointing with dramatic suddenness to the bed.</p>

  <p>We all turned and stared at him, and his ferret-nose was literally
  twitching with excitement.</p>

  <p>"But they were a devoted couple," stammered the manager.</p>

  <p>Red-hair snorted contemptuously, and turned to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Was it you," he asked, "who examined those two men who were found dead
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>"It was," said the doctor. "But what..."</p>

  <p>"Man, don't you see?" the other almost yelled. "It is the clue: it is the
  answer. Who murdered those two men? Why&mdash;he did, of course."</p>

  <p>For a moment no one spoke. I stared at John, and John stared at me: what
  on earth was he driving at?</p>

  <p>"Look here," he went on excitedly, "it is clear to me. Tell me if I'm
  wrong. When you find three people mysteriously strangled within twenty-four
  hours in the same locality&mdash;what do you assume? Why&mdash;that they were
  all strangled by the same person."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded portentiously.</p>

  <p>"That's so," he conceded.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," said the other. "If someone else murdered these three,
  why should that man go and hang himself? But supposing it was he who did it:
  supposing he was a murderer by instinct, and had some terrible quarrel with
  this woman. Possibly without even intending to, he seized her by the throat
  and strangled her. That accounts for his hanging himself. When he realised
  what he had done, half mad with remorse, he committed suicide."</p>

  <p>The Inspector scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but why?" he began.</p>

  <p>But Red-hair was not to be put off.</p>

  <p>"Find out whether this man had anything to do with Temple Tower," he
  cried. "I'll bet you he did."</p>

  <p>"You win your bet," I said. "I happened to be passing Temple Tower
  yesterday when he and this unfortunate woman were trying to get in."</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" he said triumphantly. "There's your murderer:
  there's the solution to the whole thing. Why he did it the Lord
  knows&mdash;and possibly that man Granger. And neither of them are likely to
  split. But he did it. Damn it! is there any other solution? But for this
  quarrel here there was nothing at present to connect him with the two murders
  at Temple Tower. Now there is. Once a poisoner: always a poisoner. Once a
  strangler: always a strangler."</p>

  <p>Once again I caught John's eye, and this time I signed to him urgently to
  leave the room.</p>

  <p>"Ought I to speak?" I asked him as we went downstairs .</p>

  <p>"How can you?" he answered. "What on earth can you say? You have got no
  proof. And, anyway, are you certain that that youth isn't right?"</p>

  <p>"How can he be right?" I cried. "I heard Vandali's heels drumming against
  the wall before I was attacked myself."</p>

  <p>"<i>Le Bossu</i> or no <i>le Bossu</i>," he answered obstinately, "I
  refuse to believe that a man can be forced to commit suicide. Come on: let's
  get back to Hugh's house. My head is simply buzzing."</p>

  <p>"Where is Matthews?" I asked. "Weren't you going to pick him up?"</p>

  <p>"He said he'd wait for me in the car," he said. "And if he wasn't there, I
  was to get along back."</p>

  <p>There was no sign of him, and we started off. My brain felt as if it was
  going round and round in circles also: as John had said, no man can be forced
  to commit suicide. And yet it was not Vandali who was the murderer: of that I
  was convinced.</p>

  <p>We found them all at dinner&mdash;Victor Matthews included, and they
  listened in silence while we told our story. And the first person to speak
  when we had finished was Matthews.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said quietly, "that neither of you thought of asking the
  doctor if Vandali' s neck was broken?"</p>

  <p>We all stared at him: what was he driving at? And then he began to laugh
  quietly to himself as if enjoying some secret joke.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me laughing," he said, "but it is indicative of genuine
  admiration. What a man! What a man!" He grew serious again. "We were
  wondering&mdash;all of us&mdash;how <i>le Bossu</i> was going to retrieve his
  error. Now we know."</p>

  <p>"You think it was <i>le Bossu</i>?" demanded John.</p>

  <p>"I don't think," answered the other, "I know."</p>

  <p>Then how did he make Vandali commit suicide?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't&mdash;for the simple reason that Vandali didn't commit
  suicide."</p>

  <p>"But," spluttered John, "confound it all&mdash;he did."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong, Sir John. Vandali was murdered: just as the others were
  murdered. And by that simply and kindly little act on the part of <i>le
  Bossu</i> he has not only removed from his path two people he wanted removed,
  but he has supplied the ready-made solution, so ably discovered by your
  journalistic friend, to account for everything."</p>

  <p>But how do you know Vandali was murdered?" insisted John.</p>

  <p>"Know is perhaps too strong a word," admitted Matthews. "And yet, I'm not
  sure that it is. Just think. If a man is hanged in the accepted sense of the
  word, his neck is broken, and death is instantaneous. But to obtain that
  result a long drop of several feet is necessary. In the case, however, of a
  man standing on a chair, and then kicking it away&mdash;there were one or two
  cases during the war of captured spies doing it&mdash;the neck is not broken.
  Death is not instantaneous, and is due to strangulation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but dash it all," objected John again, "what's that got to do with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Dry up, John," said Hugh. "I see what he is driving at."</p>

  <p>"Strangulation, Sir John," continued Matthews. "So that, in reality, all
  four deaths were due to the same cause. Which puts a very different
  complexion on the matter, doesn't it? Our friend, by the simple process of
  hanging one of the dead bodies up, has made it appear as if only three were
  due to strangulation, and that the fourth was suicide. That being so, the
  solution to the whole affair would be exactly what the journalist got, and
  which <i>le Bossu</i> intended someone to get. I don't blame anyone for
  jumping to the conclusion that has been jumped to: without the inside
  knowledge we possess it is the conclusion we should arrive at."</p>

  <p>But look here, Mr. Matthews," I said, "there are still some pretty useful
  difficulties in the way. If we accept your theory we have also got to accept
  the fact that <i>le Bossu</i> walked quite openly into the Vandalis' bedroom,
  and strangled them one after another without a sound being heard. Further,
  that Madame Vandali, who must have been killed second, came into the room to
  find her husband hanging to the beam, and never uttered a cry. Why, she'd
  have screamed the place down."</p>

  <p>Matthews smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Agreed, Mr. Darrell," he said. "Put as you have done, it sounds a bit
  difficult. Let me, however, try and reconstruct what may have happened. While
  the two Vandalis were talking in the little room below, <i>le Bossu</i> was
  listening. Vandali goes upstairs into his room: <i>le Bossu</i> leaves Number
  19, and follows him in. There he strangles him and puts the body in the
  cupboard. Wait"&mdash;as I again started to speak&mdash;"I can guess your
  objection, but let me finish first. Then he goes back to his listening-post,
  and shortly after Madame comes up to the room. With her he repeats the
  process, and having killed them both, he hangs the man on the beam, and puts
  the woman in the cupboard. Then once again he goes back to his room, where he
  finds you. Now, it's obvious he can't kill you. To do so would be to shed the
  light of publicity on Number 19, and the mystical Mr. Thomas. So he renders
  you unconscious, packs his things and departs. Moreover, Mr. Thomas will be
  seen no more. He has served his purpose, and he now disappears from the cast
  &mdash;as Mr. Thomas."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;as Mr. Thomas?" demanded Hugh.</p>

  <p>Victor Matthews leaned forward impressively. Assuming that my account of
  what happened is correct, and substantially it must be so, there is still one
  grave difficulty&mdash;a difficulty which I think Mr. Darrell spotted. If a
  stranger walks into your room, for whatever purpose, there will be some
  conversation, and probably loud conversation. In Mr. Darrell 's case it was a
  little different: he was in a room where he had no right to be, and he was
  taken by surprise. But with the Vandalis&mdash;especially with Madame
  Vandali&mdash; one would have expected a scream or some cry, at any rate. And
  there was nothing&mdash;no sound at all. Don't you see the almost
  irresistible conclusion we arrive at?"</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I do," said Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Why, that <i>le Bossu</i> was not a stranger to the Vandalis, He is a
  man, moreover, who could walk into their room without occasioning comment on
  their part. Jean Picot&mdash;the chauffeur: he is <i>le Bossu
  Masqu&eacute;</i>."</p>

  <p>He almost shouted in his excitement, and we all stared at him.</p>

  <p>"It fits," he went on. "It must fit. He comes over as their chauffeur. All
  along he has meant to get rid of them sometime or other. Having arrived he
  takes the first opportunity of getting the room next to them, and for the
  purpose he disguises himself and takes the name of Thomas. So that he has two
  rooms in the hotel: Jean Picot' s room, and Mr. Thomas' room."</p>

  <p>He paused and lit a cigarette, looking round the table triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"By George! laddie," boomed Hugh, "what a brain! Picot it is, for a fiver.
  What shall we do? Go and push his face in? Or have a mug of port?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>XI. &mdash; IN WHICH WE SEE A FACE AT THE WINDOW</h2>

  <p class="first">THE more one thought of it the more probable did it seem
  that Matthews was right. It accounted for so many little odd threads that had
  hitherto proved puzzling. Particularly the elusiveness of the so-called Mr.
  Thomas. It had struck me when I asked the girl in the office that she seemed
  very vague about him: the manager, too, in spite of the worry of the tragedy,
  might have been a little more helpful. But once one assumed that he and Picot
  were the same person, much of the difficulty disappeared. To a master of
  disguise, such as <i>le Bossu</i> almost certainly was, there would have been
  no difficulty over entering Number 19 as Mr. Thomas, and leaving it, if he so
  wished, as Jean Picot. His presence in that part of the hotel was easily
  accounted for in his role of chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Then again the chimney-pot episode. It had seemed to me that it had caused
  the Vandalis so little surprise that they must be privy to it. And they
  probably had been, thinking it was Jean Picot who had pushed it over at Hugh.
  But a Jean Picot who really was their chauffeur and accomplice: not a Jean
  Picot who was using them to his own ends entirely.</p>

  <p>All the way through it was the same thing, and it was impossible not to
  feel a certain unwilling admiration for the swine. For just so long as a
  person was useful to him, <i>le Bossu</i> employed him. Then without the
  smallest compunction he murdered him. <i>Le Rossignol</i> was allowed to make
  his ladder, and almost put it in position on the wall. Then&mdash;death: that
  hideous silent death which, had it suited him, would have been my
  portion.</p>

  <p>The Vandalis had been allowed to live only as long as they served his
  purpose. While it had seemed possible that they might get the jewels from
  Granger, <i>le Bossu</i> was perfectly prepared to let them try. He was, in
  fact, a past master in letting the cat pull the chestnuts out of the fire for
  him.</p>

  <p>It all fitted in, as Matthews said. On hearing of the plan he had
  forthwith driven off to Laidley Towers and obtained it, returning in time to
  hide in the shadow of the warehouse as we started off in the car. Then, later
  on, they were the lights of his car that we had seen on the main road&mdash;
  going and then coming back. And having drawn blank there, he had returned and
  tried the sea road till he found our car and removed the sparking-plugs.</p>

  <p>"He's a blinking marvel," cried Hugh. "Equalled only by our Mr.
  Matthews."</p>

  <p>Matthews waved a deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, you must not forget that I know him. But I assure you that
  on the score of brain I lay no claim to be in the same street as <i>le
  Bossu</i>. However, this time, by a combination of circumstances, I think
  we've got him. And our principal asset is Sir John's plan."</p>

  <p>"You think he will still go on with it?" said John doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"A man is not going to kill four people for nothing," answered Matthews.
  "And though the risk will be great, <i>le Bossu</i> is accustomed to risk. He
  must guess, of course, that we shall be there. That he knows about Miss
  Verney is, I should think, almost certain. And he will doubtless arrive at
  exactly the same conclusion as Sir John did&mdash;namely, that the best way
  of spotting the tree is for her to return to Temple Tower to-morrow, under
  the pretext of getting her luggage. Further, he will assume that once the
  tree is found we shall lose no time in searching for the entrance to the
  passage. And then he will rely on his own cunning. That is how I see it,
  gentlemen. Moreover, I see another thing, too. The inquest will be, I should
  imagine, the day after to-morrow. He, if it can possibly be done, would like
  to be clear of Temple Tower before the publicity, which is going to be given
  to Granger and all his doings, occurs. And so I believe <i>le Bossu</i> will
  be prepared to run an additional risk, if he can pull it off to-morrow night.
  If it was feasible he would do it to-night, but it isn't. He does not know
  where the tree is."</p>

  <p>"And so, on your theory," said Hugh, "we are going to be the last bunch of
  pussy-cats for the monkey. Supposing we refuse to play?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing would please him more," laughed Matthews. "Though we have the
  easiest method of spotting the tree, there are others. A thing like that is
  not going to deter <i>le Bossu</i>. And if we refuse to play we leave him a
  free hand. Besides, our friend is quite a good enough judge of human nature
  to know that you are not going to let me down. I've got to play, any
  way."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," cried Hugh horrified, "I was only jesting. Why, great
  Scott! this is where the fun begins. We'll dot him one all right."</p>

  <p>"The only point," said Freckles doubtfully, "is this. Now that we know
  Picot is <i>le Bossu</i>, oughtn't we to say something to the police?"</p>

  <p>"The old, old difficulty," answered Matthews.</p>

  <p>The difficulty which confronts us at every stage in our career. I speak as
  a policeman myself. We know&mdash;or we think we know: but can we prove? And
  at this stage of the proceedings we lay ourselves open to very grave censure
  for not having spoken sooner. Catch him in the act, and it becomes a very
  different matter. We have a definite result to show: a tangible asset.
  Besides "&mdash;his voice sank a little, and the dreamy look I had seen
  before came on his face&mdash;" he's my meat."</p>

  <p>"Your meat he shall remain, old lad," laughed Hugh. "We'll just come along
  and help in the mincing."</p>

  <p>And at that moment Pat Verney screamed. She was staring at the window, and
  as I swung round I had a momentary glimpse of Jean Picot's face pressed
  against the pane. His features were distorted with rage: his eyes were fixed
  on Victor Matthews. For a second I saw it, and then it seemed to me that the
  crack of a revolver and the sound of breaking glass were simultaneous with
  the lights going out. A bullet went past my head with a wicked ping, and a
  further crash of glass showed that no one was hit.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le Bossu</i>," shouted Matthews. "After him."</p>

  <p>"Who put out the light?" came Hugh's quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"I did," cried Matthews. "I'm by the switch now. Somebody stay with Miss
  Verney: come on the rest."</p>

  <p>"No earthly use," said Hugh. "The night is too dark. But I wish the damned
  fellow wouldn't break my glass. I think he was having a pot at you,
  Matthews."</p>

  <p>"I'm quite certain of it," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Good God! the door is opening," yelled Freckles.</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke, there came a half-strangled shout which turned into
  a hideous gurgling noise. It ceased as abruptly as it had begun, and then the
  door shut again.</p>

  <p>"Lights," said Hugh curtly. "And, Peter, keep your gun handy."</p>

  <p>But the light revealed nothing except an almost incredible sight. Victor
  Matthews, with his hand to his throat, and his eyes staring, was half
  crouching, half lying against the wall. His lips were moving, but only
  inarticulate sounds came from them. And on his face was a look of utter
  terror. Hugh sprang to the door and flung it open. The hall, which was dimly
  lighted, was empty, but the front door was open. And after a time he came
  back into the room.</p>

  <p>"Our old pal <i>le Bossu</i> going all out," he remarked thoughtfully.
  "Undoubtedly a gentleman of nerve."</p>

  <p>"Two hands&mdash;got me&mdash;by throat," gasped Matthews, and still the
  terror remained on his face. He was peering fearfully round the room, as if
  he expected <i>le Bossu</i> to materialise once more, and every now and then
  a long shuddering sigh shook him.</p>

  <p>"Spot of whisky?" said Hugh. "By Gad! that's calm, you know," he went on
  as he crossed to the sideboard. "First of all he has a pot shot at you: and
  then he comes into the bally house, and says 'How d'you do?'"</p>

  <p>"Do you require anything, sir?" Denny had quietly materialised. "I thought
  I heard a shot."</p>

  <p>"Just go and say 'shoo' at the front door, my trusty fellah," said Hugh.
  "But mind you don't get strangled or anything. If you think it is likely,
  call me."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Shall I lock up after that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;lock up. But say 'shoo' two or three times, as if you meant it.
  And then bring some more glasses. And beer. You know," he continued as Denny
  left the room, "this bally fellow is growing on me. Peter&mdash;for sheer
  nerve &mdash;he's got old Carl Peterson beat to a frazzle."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," I said, "it has definitely settled one thing. Picot is
  <i>le Bossu</i>."</p>

  <p>"That is so," he agreed. "And it seems to me that the thing to do now is
  to lay out our plan of campaign, provided, that is to say, Matthews is
  feeling fit enough."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right now, thanks," said Matthews. "The thing was so completely
  unexpected that it shook me for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it did," said Hugh. "Deuced nasty business having a bird like
  that keeping his hand in on you. Did you say 'shoo,' Denny?"</p>

  <p>"Three times, sir," answered the butler, putting down the beer. "Only a
  cat responded to the threat."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "We may not cut much ice with old Picot, but with cats
  we're perfect devils. Now the next move, Denny, is with Mrs. Denny. Ask her
  to go and ferret round in Mrs. Drummond's gear and get the necessary
  wherewithal for Miss Verney for to-night. Miss Verney will sleep in the green
  room. Now, what about you, Matthews? I think you'd better stay as well. You
  can sleep in my dressing-room&mdash;afraid it is the only one left. And you
  can sleep soundly, because the only way into it is through my wife's and my
  room. So that if old Picot returns we can give him a thick ear between
  us.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Captain Drummond," said Matthews. "I'll accept your offer with
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>He had quite recovered, and the colour had come back to his face. He now
  appeared almost amused at the whole thing: Hugh's very matter-of-fact
  conversation seemed to have pulled him together.</p>

  <p>"Splendid. Very well then, Denny&mdash;that's all settled. Lock up
  everywhere, and then you can turn in. Now," he went on, as Denny left the
  room, "to-morrow, at crack of dawn, somewhere round about ten o'clock. Miss
  Verney, accompanied by Scott, will repair to Temple Tower. Having arrived
  there, while Miss Verney gets her kit, Scott will wander round the grounds,
  get the tower and the eastern turret in line and then mark the tree so that
  we shall know it again. That clear?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said Freckles.</p>

  <p>"Right. Then I suggest. Miss Verney, that you should push off to bed. You
  must be completely exhausted. And don't feel alarmed: you're quite safe."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a bit frightened," she answered. "And I think I will go: last
  night was not a particularly restful one."</p>

  <p>"I'm for the shore, too," said John. "Any chance of that bally fellow
  coming back?"</p>

  <p>"Always a chance," said Hugh. "But we'll shutter all the ground floor, and
  unless he's a cat-burglar as well as a strangler, he won't get in. Off you
  push: there will be mighty little sleep for anyone to-morrow night. How's the
  neck, Matthews?" he went on, when the other three had gone.</p>

  <p>"Quite recovered. But when next I meet Picot..." He paused expressively.
  "And that will not be till to-morrow night. Our friend, I am open to a small
  bet, will not be much in evidence by day."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Hugh. "Probably not. Well, would you like me to show you your
  room?"</p>

  <p>He led the way upstairs, and I mixed myself another drink. Used as I was
  to Hugh's methods and moods, there was something about him tonight that I
  couldn't quite understand. His complete calmness and nonchalance under the
  most unusual circumstances I was accustomed to, and his manner, since the
  attack on Matthews, had been just what I should have expected. But there was
  an underlying something that beat me. No one else would have noticed it, but
  then no one else in the room knew him as I did. And when he came down the
  stairs again I tackled him.</p>

  <p>He gave a lazy grin.</p>

  <p>"It's his gall, old Peter, his gall, that tickles me to death. Plastering
  notices on my trees, and then doing target practice amongst the crockery.
  Damn the fellow, it might be his house. And then to come in and give poor old
  Matthews the once over."</p>

  <p>"But why the devil didn't you go after him?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Nerve shaken, old boy," he said earnestly. "I assure you I was all of a
  tremble."</p>

  <p>"Confound you, Hugh," I laughed, "don't talk such appalling tripe to me.
  There's something at the back of your ugly face."</p>

  <p>"A desire for beer, Peter. More beer. Much more beer."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and, with his eyes half closed, he lay back in his
  chair blowing smoke rings. And now I knew I was right: it was the attitude he
  invariably adopted when he was thinking. Absolutely motionless, save for the
  movement of his arm as he lifted his cigarette to his mouth, he sat there
  staring at the ceiling. Then, quite suddenly, he began to laugh gently to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"That's it, Peter. Gall to the nth degree. But, by Gad! old boy, a
  dangerous man to play games with&mdash;damned dangerous. I wouldn't miss
  to-morrow night for a thousand pounds. As Matthews says&mdash;it all fits in.
  As far as I can see, there isn't a flaw up to date&mdash;but what is he going
  to do when he finds us sitting over the entrance to the passage? It won't be
  too easy for the bird."</p>

  <p>"My own impression is that he will do nothing," I said, "for the simple
  reason that there will be nothing to do."</p>

  <p>"Think so?" he laughed. "Well, well&mdash;we shall see. Another pint, old
  boy, and then what about a little shut-eye?"</p>

  <p>"What are you doing to-morrow?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"This and that, Peter," he answered. "As a matter of fact, I think I shall
  take it easy. Do accounts, or something of that sort."</p>

  <p>"Do accounts?" I gasped. "If you weren't so damned large, Hugh Drummond, I
  should welt you good and hearty."</p>

  <p>I stood up: I was beginning to feel infernally sleepy. But when I reached
  the top of the stairs Hugh was still in the same attitude, with a fresh
  cigarette between his fingers. And from what I knew of him it was more than
  likely that he would remain there for hours. Something was worrying him,
  though for the life of me I couldn't see what. The one big problem&mdash;the
  identity of <i>le Bossu</i>&mdash;was solved. And the only thing that I
  couldn't see&mdash;as I said to Hugh&mdash;was what <i>le Bossu</i> could
  hope to do against five of us the following night.</p>

  <p>I slept like a log, despite the stiffness of my neck, and arrived down to
  breakfast before anyone except Victor Matthews.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le Bossu's</i> neck treatment seems to be conducive to early rising,"
  I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he laughed. "And somebody else was up pretty early, or stayed up
  mighty late. Your reporter friend has spread himself."</p>

  <p>He passed over a copy of the <i>Folkestone Courier</i>, and I glanced at
  it. Undoubtedly Matthews was right: Ferret-face had wallowed in it.</p>

  <p class="headline">AMAZING CRIME ON ROMNEY MARSH</p>

  <p class="headline">INCREDIBLE TRIPLE MURDER AND SUICIDE</p>

  <p class="headline">MYSTERY OF THE WALLED HOUSE</p>

  <p>The headlines shrieked at one, and I ran my eye down the page. It
  contained nothing that we did not know already, but one point became
  increasingly clear, as I read on. Before many hours were out, there would be
  hordes of people on the spot, armies of reporters. The account in the London
  papers was brief&mdash;just a summary of what had happened. But with the
  <i>Folkestone Courier</i> giving tongue as it had, the other papers would be
  sure to follow suit.</p>

  <p>"Get off as soon as you can, Miss Verney," said Hugh after breakfast. "It
  strikes me that this road is shortly going to look like Egham on Gold Cup
  day."</p>

  <p>She started off with Freckles five minutes later, and he turned to
  Matthews.</p>

  <p>"What's your programme?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Jean Picot," answered Matthews tersely. "There is no other problem. And
  though I don't think there is the smallest chance of my seeing him to-day,
  there is no harm in trying. There is nothing to do until to-night, and so I
  shall go into Rye and nose around."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "As you say, it can do no harm."</p>

  <p>And when John decided that he would go back to Laidley Towers, the same
  arrangement as the previous day was fixed up. He would drop Matthews in Rye,
  and pick him up again on his return in the evening.</p>

  <p>"That leaves only the old firm, Peter," said Hugh, as John's car
  disappeared through the gates. "And what does the old firm do?"</p>

  <p>"Accounts," I grinned.</p>

  <p>He was staring thoughtfully over the sun-baked marsh.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said, "accounts. To settle accounts is always an
  excellent thing to do. But in view of the fact that you bore the burden and
  heat of the day yesterday, I would like you to take a rest to-day. I want you
  to stay here. You can knit yourself some underclothes, or indulge in any
  other form of dissipation you like. But stay here&mdash;and keep your eyes
  skinned."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do yourself?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Settle accounts," he repeated. "Or, at any rate, do the preliminary
  bookwork. And if you've got no other way to occupy yourself, ponder on one
  thing. If you saw that plan sticking out from under the bed, why was <i>le
  Bossu</i> suddenly stricken with blindness?"</p>

  <p>So that was what had been worrying him the night before. If his words had
  any significance at all, he was implying that <i>le Bossu</i> had dropped the
  plan on purpose: that it was no accident and he had intended me to pick it
  up. And the notion was so completely novel that I must have stood for quite
  five minutes after the roar of the Bentley had died away, staring down the
  drive.</p>

  <p>All of us, and most certainly I personally, had assumed that the dropping
  of the plan had been a slip. We had based our plan of action on that theory:
  we had, in military parlance, appreciated the situation from that point of
  view. And here was Drummond quietly suggesting to me that the whole of our
  foundation was faulty.</p>

  <p>I sat down and began to weigh up the points for and against. And the more
  I thought of it, the more likely did it seem that he was right. <i>Le
  Bossu</i> had been in no hurry: he had quietly and systematically packed,
  taking about half an hour over it, and had then left. Was it likely that he
  would have dropped such a valuable asset as the plan, or, having dropped it
  in a distinctly conspicuous place, that he would not have seen it? Against
  that, why in the name of fortune should he have done it at all?</p>

  <p>Matthews' theory that he would still carry on was based on the idea that,
  though he had lost the plan, he would turn his loss to good account, by
  letting us find the entrance for him. But it put a very different complexion
  on matters if he had arranged for us to have it. To make the best of a bad
  job was comprehensible: deliberately to make the job bad was not. And it was
  absurd to say that only by using Miss Verney could the location of the
  entrance be found. There must be other ways, even though she afforded the
  simplest.</p>

  <p>The devil of it all lay in the fact that this new idea complicated things
  so much. While it had been left as an accident&mdash;as a slip on <i>le
  Bossu's</i> part&mdash;everything had seemed plain sailing. Now that we knew
  who he was, it had only seemed to be a question of waiting until he walked
  into our hands, either in the grounds of Temple Tower, or somewhere outside.
  But this notion of Drummond's, if it was correct, altered the whole
  situation. What was at the back of <i>le Bossu</i>'s mind, that had caused
  him to do it? He must know that we would take advantage of the verse and
  would find the entrance. Then why had he done it? And the more I thought of
  it, the more utterly incomprehensible did it seem.</p>

  <p>Unless&mdash;I sat up suddenly&mdash;unless the whole thing was a trap.
  Step by step I traced it from the hypothesis. <i>Le Bossu</i> wished to get
  rid of us, as he had got rid of the other four who stood in his way. He
  wanted to murder us, as he had murdered them. But with us he was confronted
  with a difficulty: he couldn't get us individually as he had got them. We
  were always together. So he decided to try and do us in collectively. He
  presents us with a definite spot to gather together at, and prepares that
  spot beforehand, with some infernal machine like a bomb.</p>

  <p>I checked there: how could he find the place? He might have got into the
  grounds after he had left us the preceding night&mdash;waited for the first
  faint streaks of dawn&mdash;and found it then. But in that case why didn't he
  beat it while the going was good, and go straight on into the house? So that
  wouldn't do.</p>

  <p>And then in a flash it came to me. The spot was not prepared, but <i>le
  Bossu</i> was. Once when we were bunched together there, he would steal as
  near as he could in the darkness, and throw a bomb amongst us, either killing
  or wounding the lot. Then he would go calmly along the secret passage,
  probably murder Granger, take the jewels and clear out. If alarm was caused
  by the explosion of the bomb, he would trust to luck to escape in the
  confusion.</p>

  <p>Once again the incredible audacity of the man staggered me. That I had hit
  the only possible solution, once granted Hugh's theory was right, seemed to
  me obvious. There could be no other reason which would have caused him to
  give us a piece of information, which above all others it would seem he would
  have kept to himself. And the objection which might be advanced&mdash;namely,
  that without the plan we should not have found the spot&mdash;was easily met.
  True, we might not have found the exact spot, but we should have been
  wandering round in the locality. We had already interrupted him once, when he
  was killing the wretched Gaspard, and he was not going to run the risk a
  second time. And as the full realisation of the man's cold-blooded ferocity
  sank into my mind, I was inclined to agree with Hugh that compared to him,
  Carl Peterson had been a turtle-dove.</p>

  <p>The morning wore on slowly. Midday came, and there was still no sign of
  Miss Verney or Scott, though an increasing number of cars had passed the gate
  on the way to Temple Tower. And then, at half-past twelve, the Inspector
  looked in, ostensibly to see Drummond, but in reality to quench his
  thirst.</p>

  <p>"Reporters like flies," he said. "And there's one&mdash;probably a
  photographer&mdash;circling over the house in an aeroplane. Look&mdash;there
  he is now."</p>

  <p>I glanced up: sure enough there was a machine passing backwards and
  forwards over Temple Tower,</p>

  <p>"You've found out nothing more, I suppose?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir," he said. "I can't say that I hold with those newspaper
  chaps myself, but I'm bound to admit that I think that red-haired young
  fellow has got it right this time. That is, as far as the actual murders are
  concerned. The man Vandali did them, and then hanged himself. But as to why,
  he doesn't know any more than I do. To-morrow, I think, should help us a
  little there."</p>

  <p>"At the inquest, you mean?" I said.</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir&mdash;at the inquest. That man Granger will have to
  talk then. I've been up there this morning, but he says he is sick and can't
  see anyone."</p>

  <p>"By the way," I said casually, "these Vandalis had a chauffeur, didn't
  they?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, and drained his glass,</p>

  <p>"I've examined him already," he said, "but he can't tell me anything.
  Speaks very little English. From what he says he has only been with them
  about a month, and knows nothing about them at all. Secretive sort of chap: I
  wouldn't be surprised if his past was a bit hectic. But as far as this show
  is concerned, he doesn't come into it. He has no idea whatever as to why they
  went to Temple Tower: didn't even know they had been there, in fact. No, sir.
  Granger is the man. Even though he had nothing to do with the actual murders,
  he knows why they were committed."</p>

  <p>He took his leave, and I sat on thinking idly. The aeroplane had finished
  its manoeuvres over Temple Tower, and was making off in the direction of
  Lympne: presumably the photographs had been taken. And then, happening to
  glance at my watch, I found, to my surprise, it was one o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Will you have lunch now, sir, or will you wait?" said Denny, coming out
  of the dining-room. "Mr. Scott has just returned."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Miss Verney come?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"She has not," said Freckles, appearing on the scene. "I did my level best
  to persuade her, but when Pat sticks her toes in she's like a mule."</p>

  <p>"We'll have lunch, Denny," I said. "Now what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"After the devil of a lot of fuss we managed to get in," he began. "And,
  incidentally, it's lucky we went when we did: when I left the place, ten
  minutes ago, a crowd of some fifty people hailed me as the murderer. However,
  we got in all right, and Pat went straight into the house while I oozed round
  the grounds. There was no difficulty whatever about spotting the tree. It is
  a big oak standing by itself in a bit of a clearing, and you couldn't
  possibly fail to get it, even at night."</p>

  <p>"Did you find the entrance to the passage?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I can't say I did," he said. "To tell you the truth I wasn't quite
  certain which way North was. I had a vague dip, but the only thing I saw was
  a rabbit scrape."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter," I said. "We'll get it to-night by the Pole Star. Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"Well, I sat about the grounds for over two hours, when Pat suddenly
  appeared. And, according to her, the bloke was entrenched in his room
  absolutely gnawing the blotting-paper with fright. Worse, far worse,
  apparently, than he's been before. Kept on saying 'He can't get in: he can't
  get in,' and wanting to know if they could force him to go to the inquest if
  he was ill. In fact, she seemed almost sorry for him, though I pointed out to
  her that, from what we'd heard, he must be a pretty ungodly maggot. Still,
  you know what women are&mdash;queer fish."</p>

  <p>I nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"Is that why she is staying with him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," he said, lowering his voice mysteriously. "The old
  bean thinks she is well on the road to spotting some more cubby holes. Secret
  hiding-places," he explained kindly, as he saw my look of bewilderment,
  "where he has hidden the rest of the stuff. She's got one&mdash;the panel by
  the fireplace&mdash;already, and she strongly suspects the waste pipe in the
  bathroom to be another. Apparently he gave tongue like a wounded hare on
  hearing the water turned on, but that was probably due to fright at the
  thought of washing. However, she thinks, to cut the thing short, that if she
  does a bit of nosing about this afternoon she might find out some pretty
  useful information. I thought it a bit risky myself, but she said that that
  was what Matthews had said she ought to do. And so I pushed off, and trickled
  back here. Though I don't like the idea much&mdash;leaving her practically
  alone in a house with a bloke crazy with fear."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the Toad was in an awkward position. A criminal himself, with
  hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stolen stuff in his possession, he
  dared not avail himself of police protection. Nor was he in a position to
  give the police any information as to the real terror that was hanging over
  him&mdash;<i>le Bossu</i>&mdash;for the very good reason that, unlike us, he
  didn't know who <i>le Bossu</i> was. He could give no description of him. And
  it struck me that if ever there was an example of evil bringing its own
  retribution, that was it. All these years, flying from hiding-place to
  hiding-place, in mortal terror of an unknown man. What a life! <i>Le
  Rossignol</i>, at any rate, he knew by sight, but any stranger might have
  been <i>le Bossu</i>. And then, when at last he had got his loot over from
  France, to be run to earth by both of them, unable to do anything save sit
  and wait behind his barricades."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he knows about the secret passage?" I said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>But to that question there was no answer: all that we could arrive at was
  that he had said nothing about it to Miss Verney. Which, of course, proved
  nothing at all.</p>

  <p>The afternoon dragged on slowly until at about seven o'clock Hugh
  returned, and I lost no time in putting my theory in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I haven't said anything to Scott," I told him. "But, if your idea is
  right, and that plan was left there on purpose, I don't see any other
  solution that fits. He wants to get us bunched, and then out us."</p>

  <p>But somewhat to my surprise Hugh would have none of it.</p>

  <p>"Not that I put it a bit beyond him, Peter," he remarked. "If it suited
  his purpose, he would blow up a babies' creche without scruple. But I cannot
  think that that would suit his purpose. Killing a stray individual silently
  is one thing: but to burst a bomb in the middle of the night is a very
  different affair. In all probability Temple Tower will have a certain amount
  of police attention to-night, and if the hell of an explosion takes place, it
  will be the scene of considerable activity. And there is another thing too,
  Peter. Supposing this entrance is all rusted over: supposing it takes a
  considerable time to get in? Then, according to your theory, he is going to
  draw the attention of everybody to the one spot which he wants to keep
  private."</p>

  <p>"Well, what the devil is your idea then?" I said peevishly.</p>

  <p>"Something far more subtle, old boy," he remarked with a grin, and from
  his tone of voice I knew that that was all I was going to get out of him.
  There are times when an oyster is chatty compared to Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Here is John," he said, glancing out of the window. "But no Matthews. I
  wonder where he has strayed to."</p>

  <p>"I left the policeman wallah running round in small circles in Rye," said
  John as he came in. "I'd fixed to meet him at a quarter to seven, and he
  didn't appear till ten past. From what he said he seems to have found out
  something completely new this afternoon. And he told me to tell you not to
  wait dinner for him, but that he would come up after."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "Then we might get down to it."</p>

  <p>"And what have you been doing all day, old horse?" went on John
  chattily.</p>

  <p>"This and that, laddie," said Hugh. "Trying to make four equal six, to be
  exact."</p>

  <p>"Presumably there is some meaning in your remark," said John kindly. "But
  at the moment I confess it eludes me."</p>

  <p>"And yet the fact that under certain circumstances four are as good as six
  will, unless I've bloomered badly, prove to be the deciding factor," laughed
  Hugh. "Come on, chaps: let us go and feed our faces."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>XII. &mdash; IN WHICH WE HEAR THE NOISE OF TURNING
     WHEELS</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT Hugh had some theory of his own was obvious, but by
  what possible method of subtlety <i>le Bossu</i> hoped to outwit us defeated
  me. His objection to my bomb idea was sound, I realised, but there seemed
  equally powerful objections to the use of cunning. Boiled down to rock-bottom
  facts, if five of us who all knew Jean Picot by sight were sitting round the
  entrance of the passage, it would require the deuce of a lot of subtlety to
  get past us. Force would be out of the question, and so what was going to
  happen? And the more I thought about it, the more did I come back to my
  original answer to the question&mdash;nothing at all. We should spend a night
  of intense discomfort for no result whatever.</p>

  <p>Dinner was over and we were sitting in the smoking-room. In half an hour
  it would be sufficiently dark to start, but there was still no sign of Victor
  Matthews. And we were just wondering when he would roll up when the telephone
  rang close by my chair.</p>

  <p>"Probably him," said Hugh. "Take the call, Peter."</p>

  <p>It was, and I told him we were all waiting.</p>

  <p>"Good," came his voice. "Listen, Mr. Darrell; the most extraordinary
  development has taken place. I'm hard on <i>le Bossu</i>'s trail. I think he
  has lost his nerve. Will you come at once&mdash;all of you&mdash;to Tenterden
  to the&mdash;Oh! my God."</p>

  <p>His voice rose to a hoarse scream, then stopped abruptly, and for a moment
  or two I was too stupefied to speak.</p>

  <p>Then, "Matthews!" I shouted wildly. "Matthews! What's happened?"</p>

  <p>But there was no answer&mdash;only silence, though again I shouted into
  the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Peter," came Hugh's voice. "What is the excitement?"</p>

  <p>"It was Matthews," I said. "He's just said he was hard on <i>le
  Bossu's</i> trail, and wanted us all to go to Tenterden at once. He was just
  going to say the name of the hotel, when he screamed out 'Oh! my God.' Then
  nothing more. <i>Le Bossu</i> must have got him."</p>

  <p>"Give me the receiver," said Hugh quietly. "I'll ring the exchange."</p>

  <p>We waited for what seemed an eternity.</p>

  <p>"That last call you put through to me," he said. "Where did it come
  from?"</p>

  <p>Again an interminable delay, and then he turned round.</p>

  <p>"The A.A. road box," he remarked, "on the road to Tenterden. I know it
  well. How very extraordinary."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" I said. "It is more than that: it is uncannily
  devilish."</p>

  <p>It seemed so easy to reconstruct the scene. Matthews pausing on his way to
  Tenterden, believing himself hot on <i>le Bossu</i>'s trail. He sees the A.
  A. box; decides to ring us up. And then as he stands there, unconscious of
  his danger, the very man he thought he was hunting steals on him from behind.
  The hunter hunted. And now a fifth murder to <i>le Bossu</i>'s credit.</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Hugh quietly. "This requires investigation."</p>

  <p>We tumbled into the Bentley and started off. I could see Hugh's face
  silhouetted against the reflection of the headlights, and it was like an
  expressionless mask.</p>

  <p>"It's simply amazing, Peter," he said suddenly. "I can't understand it.
  You're certain it was Matthews?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm certain," I answered. "I'd know his voice anywhere."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into silence again, and I tried to make out what was puzzling
  him. It seemed to me to be a development quite in keeping with the whole
  affair.</p>

  <p>"Here's the telephone box," he remarked, "about fifty yards ahead."</p>

  <p>He pulled up the car, and in the glare of lights the box stood out clearly
  outlined by the roadside. But of anything else there was no sign: the road
  was empty, there was no trace of any body.</p>

  <p>"He would have hidden it," I said. "He wouldn't leave it where anybody
  passing could see</p>

  <p>"No," said Hugh. "He would not. Can it be possible?" he added half to
  himself. He suddenly switched off the lights. "Come on&mdash;we must look.
  But, for God's sake, move warily. There's something here I don't understand
  at all."</p>

  <p>Halfway to the box he halted, and for a time we stood in the road
  listening intently. Not a sound could be heard save a train in the distance,
  and I suggested we should go a bit closer, and begin to search.</p>

  <p>"What I'm afraid of," said Hugh in a low voice, "is a trap. If Picot
  strangled Matthews, he must have heard what Matthews was saying, as he crept
  up to him from behind. If so, what will he assume? Why, that we shall do
  exactly what we have done. The flies are walking straight into the parlour,
  and your theory, Peter, of the bomb is quite feasible here. We must string
  out: I'll go first. And don't make a sound."</p>

  <p>He faded into the darkness, and we followed at intervals. Every now and
  then I stopped to listen, but I heard nothing except an owl hooting
  mournfully in a little wood ahead of us. Suddenly I saw a light on the road
  some twenty yards in front; Hugh had turned his torch on to the ground at the
  foot of the box, and was examining it carefully. I almost called out to him:
  if there was any chance of a trap, he was surely asking for trouble. But
  after a moment or two he switched it off again, and once more I crept forward
  till I came to the telephone box myself. He had disappeared, and for a while
  I stopped there trying once more to reconstruct in my mind what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>What would <i>le Bossu</i> have done with the body?</p>

  <p>Hidden it, of course, but hidden it as quickly as possible. A hedge ran
  behind the box, but as far as I could see there was no gap in it, and after a
  bit the hopeless futility of finding the body at night struck me. One might
  stumble on it, but the chances were all against it. And at that moment I
  heard Hugh's low whistle.</p>

  <p>He was standing in the road, and I joined him.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Peter," he said, "this is utterly futile. It's a hundred
  pounds to a banana skin against finding him."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," remarked Freckles, looming up. "I've stubbed my toe, and
  I don't want to play any more. The only way to spot him will be by day. Take
  an aeroplane and fly over the ground low, like that bloke was doing this
  morning at Temple Tower."</p>

  <p>"What's that you say?" yelled Hugh. "An aeroplane over Temple Tower?"</p>

  <p>"What under the sun is the excitement?" I cried. "I saw the fellow myself.
  A journalist taking photographs."</p>

  <p>"Journalist be damned," snapped Hugh. "Why in God's name didn't you tell
  me that before? To the car&mdash;and leg it."</p>

  <p>Almost speechless with amazement I followed him: what on earth was the
  great idea?</p>

  <p>"The one point that was missing," said Hugh tensely, as the speedometer
  touched seventy. "If only you had told me, Peter! Don't you see, man, the
  vital significance of it? The line between the tower and eastern turret, when
  produced, hits the ground at one end, and the other goes into the air. Get
  into that line from the air and you pick up the tree. It wasn't a journalist
  who was in the plane: it was <i>le Bossu</i>. And <i>le Bossu</i>, whilst we
  have been wasting time here, has calmly entered Temple Tower on the strength
  of the information that we thought only we possessed. Merciful Heavens!" he
  suddenly added in a low voice, "and the girl is there, too."</p>

  <p>The car roared on, whilst I cursed myself bitterly and savagely. Why had
  the point not struck me? I had accepted the Inspector's remark about a Press
  photographer without thought. It had seemed quite a probable explanation, and
  I hadn't bothered to look any further. And now, with a sick feeling of fear,
  I realised the result. <i>Le Bossu</i> was loose in Temple Tower, and Pat
  Verney was alone and unprotected in the house. Just as Hugh has said, he had
  assumed we should come to Matthews' aid, and had turned that assumption to
  good account. Probably we had actually passed him on the road as we came, in
  one of the cars we had met.</p>

  <p>"Lord! Peter," said Hugh, as I expressed my opinion of myself, "this is no
  time for regrets. And it wouldn't matter a tinker's curse, old man, but for
  the girl. But it is the one point that has been worrying me ever since <i>le
  Bossu</i> presented us with the plan. How was he going to find the tree
  without our assistance? And since it seemed an impossibility to me, I assumed
  he was proposing to invoke our assistance. On that assumption I mapped out
  his plan of campaign&mdash;a plan which I think I told you was one of
  subtlety."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"All in good time, old boy," he said. "This is not the moment for
  discussing theories that have proved to be wrong. All that we have to
  concentrate on at the moment, is beating the gentleman. But I will say one
  thing: I agree with Matthews' description of him. He is a very clever and
  dangerous man. And I blame myself bitterly for having given way to an
  extremely stupid and foolish impulse."</p>

  <p>But what that impulse was I had no time to ask, because at that moment we
  drew up outside Hugh's house.</p>

  <p>"Bolsters," he said. "One apiece."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do we want bolsters for?" cried John.</p>

  <p>"Denny," shouted Hugh. "I want four big bolsters."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said Denny. "I will get them at once."</p>

  <p>"If I asked for four elephants," said Hugh, "Denny would get them at once.
  My dear John," he remarked, "you don't suppose, do you, that our friend is
  going to leave the rope ladder in position on the wall? All nicely ready so
  that we can follow him in? He is going to get over himself, and then, with
  that wooden implement, remove the thing altogether, hiding it somewhere
  inside the wall. Moreover, he won't even go over in the same place as he went
  over before, so that we can dismiss the ladder as a method of entrance."</p>

  <p>"Four bolsters, sir," said Denny at the door.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh. "Now some ropes. I want about four yards."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said Denny. "I will get it at once."</p>

  <p>"We may not have a rope ladder," remarked Hugh, "but we'll get a damned
  good makeshift. Don't get fidgetty, young fellah," he added to Freckles. "I
  know what you're thinking, but believe me these preparations are necessary.
  There ain't much good arriving at the wall and having to stand outside the
  whole night looking at it."</p>

  <p>"I'm blaming myself over that aeroplane," said the youngster miserably.
  "It's I who ought to have spotted it much more than Darrell. Two or three
  times when I was standing by the tree I actually noticed the thing coming
  straight towards the house in a line with the tower. By God! if anything
  happens to Pat..."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is going to happen to Miss Verney," said Hugh quietly. "And here
  is Denny with the rope. Now then, a loop at one end, and we're ready. Except
  for one thing. Here are three whistles. Each of you take one of them, and
  keep them handy. And those whistles are only to be used for one purpose. If,
  in the darkness, <i>le Bossu</i> gets one of you, put it to your mouth and
  blow like hell."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to take the car?" I asked, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be wanted before the night is out," he said enigmatically. "And
  this time we will take precautions over sparking-plugs. Now then&mdash;up and
  over."</p>

  <p>And with a feeling strongly reminiscent of zero hour in France, in my
  chest at any rate, we followed him to the gate, carrying bolsters and the
  rope. But this trip there was no question of seventy miles an hour: we crept
  along at the car's most silent speed, with only our sidelights on. As I
  worked it out, <i>le Bossu</i> had about half an hour's start of us at the
  most, but half an hour was a terribly long time for that cold-blooded
  murderer to be given a free hand. And though I quite saw the necessity for
  silence, I chafed at the slow rate we were going.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards from the beginning of the wall Hugh stopped. A grass track
  ran off the road, and he backed down it for about thirty yards till a jink in
  the hedge completely hid her from anyone passing. Then he padlocked both
  sides of the bonnet; took out the safety key, and we left her.</p>

  <p>To make absolutely certain, we first of all searched under the bushes
  where the rope ladder had been left, but there was no sign of it: Hugh's
  forethought over the bolsters was justified. <i>Le Bossu</i>, guessing it
  would be somewhere near the spot at which we had previously entered, had
  found it and used it, and we wasted no further time. We passed up the
  bolsters one by one to Freckles, who was standing on Hugh's shoulders, and he
  wedged them in between the spikes. Then he fixed the rope, and in turn we
  swarmed up and down the other side. The final act had started.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to locate the tree, and we crept silently
  forward. To keep in touch had been Hugh's order as we started, and he led us
  quickly through the undergrowth. Away to our right lay the house, sombre and
  forbidding. Two lights shone from it&mdash;one from a window at the very top,
  and the other from one about halfway up. At last we came to the old chapel
  wall, and he paused.</p>

  <p>"Now then, Scott," he whispered, "you take the lead. And not a sound."</p>

  <p>The tree stood, as Freckles had said, in a little clearing, and we found
  it without difficulty. But it was some little time before Hugh made the next
  move. He stood underneath it listening intently, though everything was
  silent, save for the faint creaking of the branches in the breeze. Once I
  thought I heard the crack of a twig not far off, but it was not repeated, and
  I dismissed it as imagination. And once I could have sworn I saw a dark
  shadow move between two bushes a few yards away.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake let's get on with it," muttered Freckles. "This is giving
  me the jumps."</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Hugh curtly. "Use your ears and not your mouth."</p>

  <p>At last he seemed satisfied, and stepped out into the open. The Great Bear
  was easy to spot, and from it the Pole Star. Thirty long paces
  north&mdash;our next task&mdash;was simple, and there the answer lay.</p>

  <p>The excitement of the thing was getting me now&mdash;what was the answer
  going to be? Should we find some hole open in the ground&mdash;some ancient
  rusted door, perhaps, through which <i>le Bossu</i> had already passed? Or
  should we find <i>le Bossu</i> himself still trying to force an entrance, and
  unable to do so single-handed?</p>

  <p>Twenty-five: twenty-six long steps, and Hugh paused, again peering into
  the darkness ahead. I could hear my heart beating in the deathly stillness:
  even the night breeze had died away. But nothing stirred&mdash;nothing moved
  in front.</p>

  <p>Twenty-eight: twenty-nine: thirty. We were there&mdash;but where was the
  answer? We were standing on an ordinary piece of roughish turf, exactly the
  same as the ground we had walked over from the tree. But of any secret
  entrance to a passage there was no trace. In front of us were more bushes,
  but the actual spot where we were standing was in a little open space. And
  round that space we felt our way, exploring every inch of it. The result was
  nil: something had gone wrong. Wherever the answer lay, it wasn't there.</p>

  <p>That the tree was the correct one Freckles was prepared to swear. That the
  directions had been thirty long paces north we were all prepared to swear. So
  it boiled down to the fact that the directions were wrong. But if they were
  wrong for us, they were also wrong for <i>le Bossu</i>. He was in the same
  boat as ourselves, and in that lay the only consolation.</p>

  <p>The thing was so completely unexpected. All sorts of other difficulties we
  had been prepared for, but none of us had ever thought of the possibility of
  not finding the entrance at all. And the problem that immediately confronted
  us was what to do next. Somewhere within the grounds was the man we wanted;
  but how were we to get at him? Wait till dawn and hope for the best, or what?
  One thing seemed obvious: it was useless to try and look for him in the
  darkness. And that course being eliminated, it really seemed that there was
  nothing else to do but to sit tight and wait with what patience we could.</p>

  <p>It was Hugh who was the most worried. Freckles, now that any danger to
  Miss Verney had gone, was quite happy: John and I were inclined to view the
  matter philosophically. But Hugh had worked himself into a condition of
  positive irritability, which was an unheard-of thing with him.</p>

  <p>"I want that swab, Peter," he fumed, "as a cat wants milk. And what is he
  doing now? That is what I can't make up my mind about. Is he still here in
  the grounds, or has he done a bunk? Why should he stop on when he has once
  found out that the verse is wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear man," I said, "one thing is pretty obvious. If we can't
  find him inside the wall there is even less chance of our doing so outside.
  So it seems to me that we have either got to sit here and hope, or toddle
  back to bed."</p>

  <p>And even as I spoke there came a most peculiar noise from the house. It
  sounded like the clanging of a gong, and we all sprang up and stared through
  the bushes. The noise went on for perhaps a quarter of a minute: then it
  ceased as abruptly as it had begun.</p>

  <p>"A burglar alarm for a fiver," said Hugh. "Now, who has caused that to go
  off?" He was rubbing his hands together in his satisfaction. "He's inside,
  you fellows, he hasn't done a guy. And he is trying to get into the house. He
  has hit a trip wire or something of that sort. But where&mdash;damn it&mdash;
  where?"</p>

  <p>Still we peered in front of us, trying impotently to see. Somewhere in
  that inky blackness was <i>le Bossu</i>, but he might as well have been in
  Timbuctoo for our chances of catching him.</p>

  <p>"He can't get in through a window, anyway," said Hugh, "short of using
  dynamite. If only that damned fool inside would realise that he is far safer
  if he lit every room in the house instead of cowering there practically in
  darkness. Keep your eyes skinned for the flash of a torch, or the faintest
  suspicion of a light."</p>

  <p>But there was nothing: the darkness remained impenetrable, and the minutes
  dragged slowly on. Had <i>le Bossu</i>, alarmed by the sudden noise, given
  up, or was he still in front of us trying to break in? It was the uncertainty
  of it and the impossibility of doing anything to make sure that was so
  maddening. And yet we were better where we were than blundering round
  blindly. Suddenly Hugh gripped my arm.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said tensely, "look at the top room. There were three shadows
  there a moment ago."</p>

  <p>I stared up at it: the light shone out undimmed. And then, there appeared
  for an instant the shadows of three people. Distorted into fantastic shapes,
  they showed up clear in the light&mdash;then they vanished again. Miss Verney
  and Granger&mdash;but whose was the third? Even as I asked myself the
  question it appeared again&mdash;grotesque and monstrous, with outstretched
  arms. <i>Le Bossu</i> was in the room.</p>

  <p>"We must get in," cried Freckles in an agony. "We must. If necessary by
  the front door."</p>

  <p>The boy was almost beside himself, and small blame to him. Until that
  moment the situation from his point of view had seemed all right: now
  everything was changed. If the third shadow was <i>le Bossu</i> the danger
  was enough to appal anyone, let alone the fianc&eacute; of the girl who was now
  facing him.</p>

  <p>"Can't you fire through the window?" he muttered. "Drummond, you must do
  something."</p>

  <p>"Steady, old boy," said Hugh, and though to the others his voice was quite
  normal, I caught the note of almost feverish anxiety in it. In fact, he told
  me afterwards that in the whole course of his life he had never felt so
  desperately afraid.</p>

  <p>"I visualised the scene, Peter," he said to me a few days later, "as if I
  had been in the room myself. I could see Granger and the girl sitting there,
  believing themselves to be perfectly safe. And then the door slowly opening,
  and that great masked figure standing in silence watching them. Granger crazy
  mad with fear: the girl wondering desperately what to do, and where we were.
  She would play for time, of course, and provided Granger handed over the
  stuff, it was possible that <i>le Bossu</i> would spare her. That was all I
  cared about, naturally. Nothing else mattered. Even allowing <i>le Bossu</i>
  to escape altogether was infinitely better than that the slightest damage
  should come to her. But what to do? Peter, I damned nearly went bughouse.
  There was that poor devil jibbering beside us, and I knew that the most fatal
  thing we could do was to give away the fact that we were in the grounds."</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, "our only hope was to let <i>le Bossu</i> think he
  had the whole stage to himself. And the devil of it was that to all intents
  and purposes he had. He had got into the house, and we hadn't. And it was
  possible, I thought, that if he remained in ignorance of our presence he
  might not hurt the girl. Whereas, if we went and pealed on the front door
  bell, we gave the whole show away without doing any good. Up till then we had
  all of us thought that he, like ourselves, was outside. Now we knew he'd got
  in. How? Not by the door: not by a window. So how? It must have been by the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Gosh! old boy, my brain was moving as the poor old thing had never
  creaked before. Passage, passage, passage&mdash;the word positively hammered
  at it. <i>Le Bossu</i> had found the entrance: we hadn't. Why? We had
  followed out the instructions to the letter: the same instructions that he
  had followed out before us. But we couldn't have done, or we should have
  found the entrance ourselves. What followed irresistibly? Why, that the
  instructions we had followed were not the same that had guided <i>le
  Bossu</i>. It was just about that stage of my brain storm," he added with a
  laugh, "that I bit young Freckles' head off, if you remember, for
  interrupting. Poor devil! he couldn't help it, I know, but I was absolutely
  keyed up. I felt I was on the right track, but what was the next step?</p>

  <p>"If the instructions were not the same, <i>le Bossu</i> had deliberately
  altered them before passing the plan on to you. He had read them aright
  himself first: then he had cooked them for our benefit. And at that point I
  almost despaired. He might have written anything&mdash;the most complete rot
  and gibberish. Bad thing&mdash;despair, and the ray of hope came quick. Would
  he have dared to write rot? His object was to keep us in some safe place out
  of the way, while he walked in. If the verse he had invented was meaningless,
  it would not have produced that result. Besides, he knew that at any rate
  part of the verse was far from meaningless: it had led us straight to the
  tree. Therefore the alteration he had made was a small one&mdash;yet it was
  sufficient. And it was then that I made the remark that so astounded you: the
  solution had hit me like a kick in the stomach from a mule."</p>

  <p>So, four days later, did Hugh fill in for my benefit the two minutes that
  followed the appearance of <i>le Bossu</i>'s shadow in the upper room. To us
  who were with him, they had seemed an eternity. He had stood there absolutely
  motionless, without speaking, save for one remark, when, as he said, he bit
  the youngster's head off. John was muttering to me that we must do something:
  Freckles was almost sobbing in his despair. And then, like a bolt from the
  blue, came Hugh's sudden remark.</p>

  <p>"Sixty yards. Ample at night. That's it. Wait by the tree."</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you talking about?" I cried, but he had vanished, and,
  a little dazedly, we walked towards the tree. I could hear him near at hand:
  with <i>le Bossu</i> inside the house the necessity for silence had gone. And
  suddenly he loomed up out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I've found the entrance," he said quietly. "Our friend altered two
  letters in the verse before passing it on to us. S to N and U to R. Thirty
  long paces north took us exactly sixty long paces from the spot we wanted to
  find, which happens to be thirty long paces south of the tree. Come on.</p>

  <p>At the time it had seemed to me the wildest piece of guess-work that had
  come right: an unworthy suspicion for which I afterwards abased myself. But
  the fact that it had come right was all that mattered, and a few seconds
  later we were standing in front of the entrance. Some bushes screened us from
  the house, and Hugh switched on his torch.</p>

  <p>It consisted of a hole in the ground, from which mouldering stone steps
  went downwards. It had evidently been covered with boards and rubbish,
  because these had been removed and now lay in an untidy heap beside the edge.
  Rotting green fungus was growing on the sides of the steps and walls, and the
  spot reeked with the putrid smell of decay.</p>

  <p>Earth was lying thick on the steps, and in the light of the torch
  footprints were plainly visible&mdash;footprints which went towards the house
  and did not return, grim proof that we were not mistaken over the shadow. Not
  many minutes previously <i>le Bossu</i> had passed along that passage, and
  with a curt warning to walk warily, Hugh led the way down the steps.</p>

  <p>The air was dark and foetid, though the passage itself proved to be of a
  comfortable height to walk in. The floor was rough and uneven, and the walls
  consisted of crude blocks of stone, moss covered and crumbling in places.</p>

  <p>For about twenty yards it ran in a straight line: then it jinked sharply
  to the left, and Hugh paused.</p>

  <p>"Presumably," he said, "we are now under the chapel wall. And from this
  point the passage runs straight to the house. So we've got to carry on
  without a light."</p>

  <p>He switched off his torch: undoubtedly he would have been a sitting shot
  for anyone lying up for us at the other end. But feeble though the glimmer
  had been in front, it had served its purpose: now that it was out, the
  darkness seemed the most intense thing I had ever known. It pressed on one
  till one felt it was tangible. Not one glimmer of even faint greyness, but a
  solid black wall closing in on one from all sides.</p>

  <p>From my recollection of the position of the chapel wall, I estimated the
  distance to the house from the jink in the passage, to be about sixty yards.
  And I guessed that we had gone about thirty when suddenly the same noise
  began as we had heard in the grounds before. But this time it was much
  louder. It came from the house in front of us&mdash;the loud insistent
  clanging of a gong. I stopped instinctively: we must have run into the same
  alarm as <i>le Bossu</i>.</p>

  <p>The others had halted also: I could hear John's quick breathing just in
  front of me. And what happened then, happened so quickly that it is hard to
  recall the exact sequence of events.</p>

  <p>First there came a loud creaking noise from close by us&mdash;so loud that
  it quite drowned the clamour of the gong. Then a sudden shout from
  Freckles&mdash; "My God! the walls are moving!" Then light&mdash;blessed
  light&mdash;from Hugh's torch.</p>

  <p>Only one momentary glimpse did I get of the amazing scene before Hugh's
  roar of warning galvanised us all into activity.</p>

  <p>"Back for your lives."</p>

  <p>And just in time did we all get back. Another half second and Hugh, who
  was the last out, would have been caught. As Freckles had said, the walls
  were moving: they were closing together for a length of about ten yards in
  front of us. Like two gigantic millstones they approached each other until
  they met with a dull thud in the centre. The meaning of the line about the
  turning wheels was clear.</p>

  <p>"An unpleasant death," said Hugh grimly, his torch fixed on the solid
  block of stone that now confronted us. "But the damned annoying thing is that
  we are on one side of the obstruction and <i>le Bossu</i> is on the other. He
  got through and we didn't. Back to the entrance: there is nothing more to be
  done here."</p>

  <p>And there was nothing more to be done there either. Fifteen yards only did
  we go before we found that the walls had closed behind us also. We were shut
  in the space between them: caught like rats in a trap.</p>

  <p>For a moment even Hugh gave way to despair and cursed wildly: then he
  pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"No good biting the bedclothes," he remarked. "Let's explore our
  quarters."</p>

  <p>The exploration did not take long, and certainly did nothing to raise our
  spirits. There was no possible way out, until the mechanism should operate in
  the other direction. We could go neither forwards nor backwards. And the roof
  presented no hope either. It looked perfectly solid, and judging by the
  number of steps we had come down at the entrance there were at least four
  feet of earth on top of it. In fact the only ray of comfort lay in the fact
  that though the moving walls had completely blocked us in, there was a space
  between the top of them and the roof. Not large enough for one of us to crawl
  through, but sufficient to allow of the passage of air. There was no danger
  of our being suffocated. Also for the same reason our prison was not
  sound-proof: we could shout and in due course somebody would be certain to
  hear us. But who? What was the good of shouting when the whole house was in
  the hands of <i>le Bossu</i>? He wasn't likely to let us out.</p>

  <p>It was the thought of that that drove us nearly insane. At that very
  moment, whilst we stood there powerless to do anything, <i>le Bossu</i> was
  free to do what he liked in the stronghold itself. And Miss Verney was in his
  power. He had the whole night in front of him to find the stolen stuff, and
  then what would he do? Kill Granger for a certainty, but what about the girl?
  If he was the type who would kill one woman, he certainly wouldn't scruple
  about killing another if it served his purpose. And then, leaving us where we
  were, he would quietly depart, having beaten us all along the line. True we
  did know who he was, but that was very cold comfort. To devote the rest of
  one's life to the pursuit of Jean Picot was an inadequate return for what he
  had done to us, even if we ever caught him.</p>

  <p>We didn't talk: there was nothing to say, just as there was nothing to be
  done. Just once Hugh put his hand on Freckles' shoulder and said, "Buck up,
  old man: no need to despair yet." But for the rest we sat or stood in
  silence, each busy with his own thoughts. And after a while Hugh switched off
  the torch, which was beginning to run low, and black, overpowering darkness
  came down on us again.</p>

  <p>Not a sound came from the house; each minute seemed like an hour as it
  dragged by. And at length I began to doze where I stood. Suddenly I felt
  Hugh's grip on my arm: a faint light was filtering over the top of the
  barrier between us and the house. I glanced at the luminous dial of my wrist
  watch; and it showed a quarter to one. For nearly two hours had we been
  imprisoned.</p>

  <p>The light flickered a little, and then grew steady. Still there was no
  noise; only that faint illumination proved that someone was about on the
  other side. Then, without warning, there came the most ghastly sound I have
  ever listened to in my life&mdash;peal after peal of wild maniacal laughter.
  It rose and fell&mdash;echoing round us: then, abruptly, it ceased. And a
  moment or two later the light flickered again, and then went out. Darkness
  was on us once more: darkness and silence.</p>

  <p>"My God!" stammered Freckles in a shaking voice, "what was that?"</p>

  <p>My own forehead was wet with sweat, and even Hugh's iron nerve was a bit
  shaken. Regardless of his failing battery he had switched on his torch: even
  its feeble glow was welcome after that devilish laughter. Was it Granger, or
  was it <i>le Bossu</i>? Gone mad suddenly... loose in the house.... And no
  one blamed the youngster when he suddenly hurled himself hysterically at the
  stone barrier and began to beat at it with his fists.</p>

  <p>"Damn you," he screamed, "damn you&mdash;open."</p>

  <p>And to our stupefied amazement it did. At the time&mdash;not knowing the
  reason&mdash;it seemed like a miracle: afterwards when we did know the
  reason, and the marvellous part played by that marvellous girl, it seemed no
  less of a miracle. But at the moment we could think of nothing save the fact
  that the prison door was opening. The wheels on which the walls moved creaked
  and groaned, until, with a thud, they came to rest in their proper place. The
  way to the house was free.</p>

  <p>But not at once did Hugh move: the possibility of a trap was still there.
  It might have been the man whose frenzied laughter we had heard who had
  opened the walls. And if that was so he might be even now waiting for us out
  of sight, inside the house, to pot us one by one as we came out of the
  passage. At last he went with a rush, and from inside there came the single
  sharp clang of the gong. And with each of us as we dashed through the clang
  was repeated. But after that there was silence. No movement came from the
  walls: no movement came from the house. The man whose laughter we had heard
  was not there.</p>

  <p>We were standing in a sort of stone basement, from which stairs led to the
  upper part of the house. Further delay was useless now: the time had come to
  meet <i>le Bossu</i> on equal terms. And so we raced up the stairs behind
  Hugh. A light was shining above us through an open door. And in the doorway
  he stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he muttered. "Look at that."</p>

  <p>We crowded round him. It was the hall we were in, and the big chandelier
  in the centre was lit. Hanging from it, just as Vandali had hung from the
  beam in the Dolphin, was Granger. He was swinging to and fro, and as he moved
  the tips of his toes brushed against the carpet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came footsteps on the stairs above us, and we swung round.
  Faltering they were, and unsteady: no man was making them. A figure in white
  appeared, clutching the bannister: then, tottering and swaying, it came down
  towards us&mdash;a step at a time. It was Pat Verney, and with a great cry
  Freckles sprang to meet her.</p>

  <p>But she hardly seemed to see him, as she stood staring at us with a look
  of frozen horror in her eyes. She just gave a little cry of: "Has he gone?"
  then, without another word, she pitched forward insensible.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT IS SETTLED</h2>

  <p class="first">AND now, before I tell of the last grim fight between Hugh
  Drummond and <i>le Bossu</i>, I will go back a few hours, and write of what
  happened in Temple Tower while we lay prisoners in the passage. Not for three
  or four days did we hear it, and, bit by bit, we got it from Pat Verney. And
  because the horror of it was still on her, she got the horror of it across to
  us, so that I feel that I actually was present myself in that upstair room
  where it happened. Wherefore I will write of it as if I had been a silent and
  invisible witness, and not as the teller of a secondhand tale.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock Pat Verney had dinner in her own room. It was served by
  Mrs. Gaspard, and to her dismay she discovered that the instant it was dark
  the servant proposed to go. Nothing, she said, would induce her to remain
  another night in the house, and so the girl found herself confronted with the
  prospect of being left alone in the house with a man who was to all intents
  and purposes demented with terror. For a while she hesitated: should she go
  too? She weighed it up in her mind, as she stood by the window staring over
  the grounds. Dusk was beginning to fall, and in her imagination she seemed to
  see phantom figures slinking through the undergrowth already. Then she took a
  pull at herself. Even if <i>le Bossu</i> did come, were there not five of us?
  And already she had discovered another of Granger's hiding-places: afterwards
  she might discover more. She had agreed to go and sit in his room at the top
  of the house, after she had finished her meal, and with luck she might get
  him to talk.</p>

  <p>Nine o'clock came, and she turned on her light. In half an hour or so she
  would go to Granger: until then she tried to concentrate on a book. From
  below there came no sound: Mrs. Gaspard had gone, and much as she disliked
  the woman it seemed as if the last link with the outside world had snapped.
  She and the Toad were left alone to face the unknown terrors of the
  night.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Pat Verney," she told herself. "You and your unknown
  terrors! <i>Le Bossu</i> will probably get a thick ear, and with your share
  of the reward you will be in a position to tell Miss Mudge to go to
  blazes."</p>

  <p>But try as she would she couldn't be altogether common sense about it.
  There was something in the incredible cold butchery of <i>le Bossu</i> that
  prevented anyone being normal about him. Supposing he did dodge us: supposing
  he came first&mdash;what then? Little did she think that she was actually
  going to get the answer to her question, poor kid.</p>

  <p>At half-past nine she put down her book: even Granger's society seemed
  preferable to none at all. She opened her door; outside the house was in
  darkness. No lights were lit in the passage, and for a while she hesitated.
  No lights ever were lit in Temple Tower, but to-night she wondered whether
  she should turn them on. From all around her came those queer noises that
  occur in every house after the sun goes down, but each sudden crack of a
  board sounded to her like a footstep on the stairs. And at length she turned
  and fairly ran up to Granger's room, feeling every moment that hands might
  come out of the darkness and clutch her by the throat.</p>

  <p>The Toad was seated at his desk, muttering to himself. He looked up as she
  entered, and it seemed to her that he looked lower and more debased than
  ever. Some trick of the light perhaps, or a leering expression of cunning
  that had for the moment replaced his chronic terror, may have caused it, but
  the fact remained that she very nearly returned to her room.</p>

  <p>"Sit down. Miss Verney," he mumbled. "Sit down. Will he come to-night, do
  you think?"</p>

  <p>"Will who come, Mr. Granger?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The other one," he said. "The one who is the devil himself."</p>

  <p>His clawlike hands were moving like talons, and suddenly he burst into a
  cackle of laughter.</p>

  <p>"He has been once. I know: I know. But the police don't. He caught the
  Nightingale, and he caught Gaspard: with his hands&mdash;so."</p>

  <p>Fascinated, she watched his hands curving as if a man's throat was inside
  them.</p>

  <p>"The Strangler: the Silent Strangler," he went on. "That is what we called
  him in the old days. And other names, too. But <i>le Crapeau</i> was his
  match: <i>le Crapeau</i> beat him."</p>

  <p>She said nothing: not by the tremor of an eyelid did she give away the
  fact that she knew the whole story. To let him talk was her object, in the
  hope that he might give away the secret of his various hiding-places. And it
  never seemed to occur to him that to anyone who knew nothing of the story
  what he was saying must have appeared absolutely gibberish.</p>

  <p>"By the old mill near Bonneval the Toad hid the stuff. Deep down under
  boards and sacks. He feared the police: but he feared the other one more. For
  to offend the other one&mdash;to play him false&mdash;meant death. Till then,
  no one who had done so had ever lived: but <i>le Crapeau</i> did, for he
  could not find <i>le Crapeau</i>."</p>

  <p>"How do you know all this, Mr. Granger?" she said quietly.</p>

  <p>But he didn't seem to see the relevance of the question: apparently it
  didn't strike him that he had given himself away utterly and completely. And
  after a while, as he went on chuckling and talking more to himself than to
  her, she began to realise that the man's brain had partially gone. Sudden
  flashes of suspicion pulled him up periodically in his rambling story, but
  only for a moment. Then he was off again in full spate, as she put it.</p>

  <p>"Beaten them all," he kept on repeating. "<i>Le Crapeau</i> beat them all.
  He was clever, was the old one. And now he will beat them again. The
  Nightingale " &mdash;he shook with hideous, silent laughter&mdash;"the
  Nightingale. The Strangler got him, but he won't get the Toad. The Toad is
  too clever for him."</p>

  <p>"What does the Strangler look like?" she asked.</p>

  <p>But he took no notice of the question, hardly seemed to hear it, in fact.
  On and on he rambled, incoherently mixing up the past and the present, until
  she gave up any attempt at listening. And after a while a sense of unreality
  stole over her: she felt the whole thing must be a dream. This crazy man
  gibbering and muttering: the bright-lit room, with its barred window making a
  black patch against the night, was a figment of imagination. And even as her
  eyes began to close, a sudden deafening clamour filled the room.</p>

  <p>In a second she was wide awake. The noise was coming from a gong fastened
  to one of the walls. It was evidently worked by electricity, and for a time
  she stared at it in bewilderment. What had suddenly started it ringing? Then
  she looked at Granger, and it took all her strength of mind to bite back a
  scream. For the man's face was that of a devil. His lips were drawn back in a
  snarl, showing his yellow, discoloured teeth, and he was half standing, half
  crouching by his desk, with his eyes fixed on the gong. Then suddenly, with a
  grunt that was animal-like in its ferocity, he hurled himself across the room
  and forced home a big electric switch.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the gong ceased, and in its place she heard another
  noise, this time coming from down below. Then that ceased also, and there was
  silence, save for Granger's wild laughter. He was dancing round the room like
  a madman, yelling and shouting, but after a while he calmed down a
  little.</p>

  <p>"Beaten him: the old one has beaten him," he mouthed. "The wheels have
  turned: the Strangler is caught."</p>

  <p>And now terror got hold of her: what did he mean? In a flash the line of
  the verse came back to her: The sound of turning wheels&mdash;beware. But
  what was she to do? Something had happened below in the secret passage:
  something which filled Granger with such delight that he was almost off his
  head. Something, moreover, which made him think he was absolutely safe.</p>

  <p>She forced herself to be calm. She must act, and act quickly. Granger
  believed that the Strangler was caught below: to her it seemed certain that
  it was us. And so she did the one fatal thing. Believing us to be in some
  deadly peril, she argued that if it had been caused by putting in the switch,
  it would be removed by taking it out. And so, utterly regardless of the crazy
  madman, she dashed to the wall and pulled it out.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he did not seem to realise what she had done: then,
  with a scream of bestial fury, he hurled himself at her. Desperately, she
  clung to the handle of the switch, whilst from below came the creaking,
  grinding noise once again. What had shut was now opening: let her but hold it
  a little longer and we should be safe.</p>

  <p>Thus she argued, whilst Granger clawed at her throat, mouthing foul abuse
  at her. Then there came one sharp clang of the gong above their heads, and
  silence from below. She had succeeded: we were free. Her hands relaxed weakly
  from the handle: she sank, half fainting, on the ground.</p>

  <p>Standing over her, with murder in his eyes, was Granger. So great was his
  fury that he seemed to have forgotten the Strangler, forgotten everything
  save his animal fury with her. His hands shot out once more and gripped her
  throat&mdash;gripped it till there came a roaring in her ears. He was
  murdering her: would we never come? And even as she had given up hope, a
  shadow fell on them both, and over Granger's shoulder she saw a great masked
  figure. <i>Le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> had arrived.</p>

  <p><i>"Crapeau! Crapeau!"</i></p>

  <p>Like a whiplash, the words cut through the room, and the grip relaxed from
  her throat. For a moment or two the relief was so great that she could think
  of nothing else: then she scrambled to her feet with a feeling of sick
  despair. We had not come: <i>le Bossu</i> had. Opening the switch had been
  the worst thing she could have done.</p>

  <p>"So, <i>Crapeau</i>, we meet again. What have you to say?"</p>

  <p>Granger, his hands plucking feverishly at his collar, was cowering in a
  corner, whilst <i>le Bossu</i> stood motionless in the centre of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless a lot, <i>Crapeau</i>. But it will keep for a while. Just now I
  would like an explanation of that interesting mechanical device in the secret
  passage. Quickly, <i>Crapeau</i>: very quickly. I have an idea that before
  the night is out it may come in handy once again."</p>

  <p>"Spare me," screamed Granger, dragging himself forward on his knees.
  "Spare me. I'll tell you everything."</p>

  <p>"Speak!" hissed the other. "And at once."</p>

  <p>"A stone in the floor," explained Granger in a shaking voice. "If you
  stand on it it rings that gong by electricity. Then that switch makes the
  walls close. It used to work differently, by some mechanism, but I had it
  altered."</p>

  <p>"I see. So when you heard the gong ring, <i>Crapeau</i>, you knew that
  someone was standing on the stone. You knew that I had come for you,
  <i>Crapeau</i>. And so you put in the switch."</p>

  <p>The Toad was grovelling at the other's feet in his terror.</p>

  <p>"That is easy," continued <i>le Bossu</i>. "What is difficult is why you
  took it out again. Or was it the lady?"</p>

  <p>"It was, you foul murderer," said the girl contemptuously, and <i>le
  Bossu</i> gave a little hissing chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Considerate of you," he remarked. "Do you think the gong will ring again
  to-night or not?"</p>

  <p>He stood there shaking with silent laughter, and she stared at him
  fascinated.</p>

  <p>"Because, if it does, we know what to do," he continued, "to ensure that
  we shall not be interrupted. Your friends are a little foolish to pit their
  brains against mine. And now, <i>Crapeau</i>"&mdash;he turned once more to
  the cowering man&mdash;come here.</p>

  <p>Granger rose and slunk towards him like a beaten dog.</p>

  <p>"To gratify my curiosity I am going to ask you a few questions, and then
  we will proceed to the business of the evening. Where did you hide yourself,
  <i>Crapeau</i>, so that even I couldn't find you?</p>

  <p>"In Switzerland," whined Granger.</p>

  <p>"Switzerland!" said <i>le Bossu</i> thoughtfully. "That's where you bolted
  to, was it? However, it matters not. What you did in those far-off days is
  old and stale, and I grow weary of you. All these years you have slunk
  through the world, <i>Crapeau</i>, in fear of your life. Never knowing when
  <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> would come: never knowing when his hands would steal
  round your throat. You hid yourself here: you barricaded yourself in thinking
  you would be safe. And now you see the result. Your precautions were useless:
  <i>le Bossu</i> has found you. The time of reckoning has come."</p>

  <p>Clang went the gong again, and <i>le Bossu</i> turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Quicker than I had expected," he murmured. "But this time the switch will
  remain in, young lady."</p>

  <p>He forced it in, and, sick with apprehension. she heard the gong cease
  abruptly and the creaking noise come from below. Then silence.</p>

  <p>"A pretty little prison," purred <i>le Bossu</i>, where your friends will
  remain until I have finished. And perhaps longer than that. It all
  depends&mdash;on you. Should you attempt to open the switch" &mdash;his
  fingers touched her throat, and she shrank back in horror&mdash;"I should
  have to take steps to prevent you succeeding. And then they might have to
  stop there for days, or even weeks. So remember. Go and sit on the other side
  of the room."</p>

  <p>She stumbled over blindly: there was something immeasurably more
  terrifying in that soft hissing voice even than there had been in the animal
  fury of Granger,</p>

  <p>"Now, <i>Crapeau</i>, to business. What have you sold in these past years?
  Give an account of your stewardship."</p>

  <p>"Only enough to live on, and to buy this house," pleaded Granger. "By the
  blood of the Virgin, I speak the truth. The rest is all here: take it."</p>

  <p>"I shall take exactly what I want," said <i>le Bossu</i>. "I trust for
  your sake that you have not sold the emeralds."</p>

  <p>"They are here," cried Granger, fumbling with unsteady hands at the
  opening by the fire-place. "All of them."</p>

  <p>Fascinated in spite of herself the girl watched <i>le Bossu</i> as he
  tossed them from hand to hand in lines of living green fire.</p>

  <p>"The beauties," he whispered. "The beauties. Now, <i>Crapeau</i>&mdash;the
  rest. Put them on your table, and I will choose."</p>

  <p>And then for the next hour the scene must surely have been as amazing as
  any ever thought of in the wildest fairy story. From different hiding-places
  all over the room came every conceivable form of treasure. Pearls, rubies,
  diamonds, exquisite miniatures, littered the desk, until the mind reeled at
  the value of what lay there. And all the time <i>le Bossu</i> sat motionless
  in his chair. Once only did he make a movement, and that was to pick up an
  exquisitely chased gold cup and turn it over in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Divine work," he said thoughtfully. "A pity that it must remain."</p>

  <p>Another hour passed in a sort of semi-stupor for her, while <i>le
  Bossu</i> made his choice. Each stone was carefully examined, and either
  returned to the table or placed carefully in one of the velvet bags he had
  taken from his pocket. No word was spoken, and once when Granger ventured
  some cringing remark he was bidden curtly to be silent. And for the second
  time that night the sense of unreality came over her. The great deformed
  figure at the desk, silent and absorbed: the fawning, obsequious Granger at
  his side, were just parts of some ghastly nightmare.</p>

  <p>At length <i>le Bossu</i> rose: he had finished, and for a space he stood
  staring at Granger. His back was towards the girl, but in his eyes there must
  have been something which told the other the truth. For with a sudden
  frenzied cry he hurled himself on his knees and grovelled for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Spare me," he screamed again and again. "I have given you all."</p>

  <p>"<i>Crapeau</i>," came a terrible voice, "what was the penalty for
  disobeying me in the past?"</p>

  <p>"Death," moaned the other.</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason, <i>Crapeau</i>," went on the voice, "why you should
  escape that penalty?"</p>

  <p>And then <i>le Bossu</i> paused and swung round. For the girl had seized
  him by the arm, and was shouting at him hysterically.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to murder him," she cried. "It's monstrous: it's..."</p>

  <p>The words died away on her lips, and she gave a little moaning sob of
  terror, and cowered back. For his eyes seemed to be glowing with some strange
  light, a greenish-yellow light, which bored into her brain and numbed her.
  Then like a flash he turned again. There came a choking squeal: then silence
  save for a faint hissing noise. <i>Le Bossu</i> was strangling <i>le
  Crapeau</i> before her eyes.</p>

  <p>He seemed to her like some monstrous spider, who had at last got the fly
  in its clutches. Her brain refused to act: she could only lean against the
  wall moaning pitifully. And suddenly it was all over. With a thud Granger
  fell on the floor: the strangler's work was done. For a moment she stared at
  the victim's face. Then, with a little sob of utter horror, she fainted.</p>

  <p>When she came to herself the room was empty. And it was only the heap of
  rejected stuff which still lay on the table that told her it had been grim
  reality and not some ghastly dream. <i>Le Bossu</i> had been there, he had
  murdered Granger and had gone. But had he? For the moment he was not in the
  room, but at any instant he might return and complete his work by killing
  her.</p>

  <p>Now was her chance to open the switch. Shakily she got to her feet, and it
  was when she was halfway across the room that the crazy maniacal laughter,
  which we had heard in the passage, pealed through the house. For a second or
  two she paused, clutching the table, wondering whether the murderous fiend
  was even now playing with her as a cat plays with a mouse. Then, as the
  laughter ceased, she took a little run forward and pulled out the switch. And
  so did she come stumbling down the stairs to us&mdash;a girl who had reached
  the breaking-point.</p>

  <p>We lifted her on to the sofa, and then Hugh spoke. His voice was perfectly
  normal, and in all probability the others noticed nothing. But I knew at once
  that he was in a condition of cold, overmastering rage. It was rare with him,
  very rare: only twice before, I think, had I seen him in a similar condition.
  And it were safer for a man to sit on an open barrel of gunpowder with a
  lighted match in his hand, than to come to grips with Hugh Drummond in such a
  mood.</p>

  <p>"Scott," he said quietly, "you and John will remain with Miss Verney. When
  she has recovered sufficiently take her back to my house. Come, Peter."</p>

  <p>Without another word he strode to the front door and I followed. It was
  open: <i>le Bossu</i> had left that way. And the instant he was outside he
  dodged into the bushes: rage or no rage his judgment was not blinded. In
  absolute silence he made his way through the undergrowth, and at such a speed
  that I, used though I was to his uncanny power of movement at night, was hard
  put to it to keep up with him. Only once did he pause, and that was when
  there came from the distance the sudden roar of a motor engine. Then we
  reached the wall, and swarmed over.</p>

  <p>"Leave those things," he said shortly. "There will be a good deal to tell
  the police before the night is through, and our method of entry will be one
  of them."</p>

  <p>The Bentley was where we had left her, and started at once. No tampering
  this time, and a few minutes later we spun past Hugh's house.</p>

  <p>"Where are we bound for?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The Marsh," he answered. "And the proof that four can be as good as six.
  But, my God! Peter, we've cut it fine this time."</p>

  <p>Through Rye, and along the straight stretch to the fork, where he turned
  right-handed along the sea road. We were going to the same place as the first
  night when we had visited Spragge's Farm. And it was not until he was getting
  out of the car that he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"If by any chance he does me in, Peter," he said gravely, "shoot him as
  you would shoot a mad dog."</p>

  <p>So it was here that the final battle was to come. Somewhere in the sand
  dunes Drummond and <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> were going to meet. How Hugh knew I
  didn't ask: he was in no mood for idle chatter. That he did know was enough
  for me: that he had known all along was obvious now. And even at that moment,
  keyed up though I was, I couldn't help realising the torment of mind he must
  have gone through when, as a prisoner in the passage, he thought his plan was
  going to fail through no fault of his own.</p>

  <p>Side by side we crept over the sandy hummocks. He was taking a course
  almost parallel with the sea, but a little inshore. And after we had gone
  about four hundred yards, he put out his hand as a warning. Evidently we were
  near the spot. In front of us lay a dune higher than the average, and up this
  he wormed his way on his stomach. I followed him, and then, inch by inch, I
  raised my head to see what was on the other side. And in that instant I
  understood.</p>

  <p>Below us was the motor-boat we had found on our visit to Spragge's Farm.
  It had been moved from its original position, and now it lay, its bows
  pointing to the open sea, in a little creek. We had cut in on <i>le
  Bossu</i>'s line of retreat.</p>

  <p>"We may have to wait some time," whispered Hugh in my ear. "But that is
  better than being too late."</p>

  <p>And then began an eerie vigil. The ceaseless roar of the sea: the harsh
  call of some night bird above our heads, were the only sounds. And after a
  while there came that faint lessening of the darkness over Dungeness that
  heralded the approach of dawn. I glanced at my watch, it marked a quarter to
  three.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Hugh gripped my arm.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," he whispered.</p>

  <p>I had heard nothing myself, but of old I knew that Drummond at night was
  not as other men. And then, I, too, heard the noise of a stone being
  dislodged. It came from inland, and I peered in the direction of the
  sound.</p>

  <p>"There he is," breathed Hugh. "We will play with him a little, Peter."</p>

  <p>And now I could see his outline plainly. He was coming along the side of
  the dyke towards the motor-boat. Moreover, he did not seem to be taking any
  precautions about moving silently: evidently he had no suspicions whatever
  that we were there before him. He paused by the side of the boat, and I half
  expected Hugh to hurl himself down the dune on to him. But he made no
  movement, though in the very faint light I thought I detected a grim smile on
  his face.</p>

  <p>Below us, quite unconscious of his danger, <i>le Bossu</i> went on with
  his preparations. He was stowing some things away in the stern of the boat,
  and every now and then he lifted his head and listened. The possibility of
  pursuit was clearly in his mind, and once he paused for nearly a minute. One
  could just see his movements against the jet-black mirror of water: one was
  near enough to hear the faint hissing whistle with which he worked, like a
  man grooming a horse.</p>

  <p>At length he straightened up and stepped into the boat: he was going to
  take off the tarpaulin that covered the engine. I glanced at Hugh: it struck
  me that what he had said on the drive down was true now&mdash;he was cutting
  it fine. Once let <i>le Bossu</i> start the engine, there was every chance in
  the darkness of his being able to make the sea. At any rate, the only method
  of stopping him would be to fire more or less blindly at the boat. But still
  Hugh made no movement: like a piece of carved granite he lay there staring at
  the boat below.</p>

  <p><i>Le Bossu</i> folded the tarpaulin, and threw it into the bows. Then he
  got on to the bank once more, and the rattle of a chain told us he had cast
  off the painter. He was ready to go. For a moment or two he stood by the side
  of the boat, and clear above the noise of the waves we heard him laughing.
  Low and triumphant, and yet with the same ring of madness in it as that wild,
  frenzied peal he had given at Temple Tower. Then he got back into the boat,
  and again I glanced at Hugh. Surely he wasn't going to wait any longer.</p>

  <p>Crank went the starting-handle: no result. Again he tried: nothing. His
  laughter had ceased; and he tried once more. The engine refused to fire. And
  now I felt Hugh shaking silently beside me&mdash;and a dim premonition of
  what had happened began to dawn on me&mdash;a premonition which was confirmed
  a moment or two later. <i>Le Bossu</i> had switched on his torch to examine
  the motor. All the four sparking-plugs had been removed. The meaning of
  Hugh's cryptic utterance about four being the equivalent of six was
  clear.</p>

  <p>Out went the light, and from below us came a flood of the most frightful
  blasphemy. His voice was hardly above a whisper, but every word carried to
  our ears. Then abruptly it ceased: <i>le Bossu</i> was thinking. That he
  still had no inkling of our presence was obvious: he still believed himself
  to be alone. But alone with a useless motor-boat instead of alone and well
  out to sea. What was he to do? He must have realised that the object of the
  boat was known to us; and that being the case, that we should come to it the
  instant we got out of the secret passage. And he must have cursed himself for
  not having taken more precautions to prevent us doing so. As long as he had
  thought that the secret of the boat was his alone, it had not mattered when
  we escaped: now when he knew it wasn't, everything was altered.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear: the idea of escaping in the boat must be abandoned,
  at any rate, for the present. Moreover, the sooner he was away from the boat,
  the better for him. Feverishly he began to unpack the things he had so
  carefully stowed away; every second was of importance. At any moment we might
  be on him: from triumph he had plunged to failure. And it was then I realised
  that Hugh was no longer beside me: like a shadow he had vanished into the
  darkness. The time for play was over: the final settlement was due. I hitched
  myself forward a few inches, and with my revolver ready I waited. How was it
  going to happen?</p>

  <p>Suddenly from about ten yards away came Hugh's clear laugh, and with a
  hiss like an angry snake <i>le Bossu</i> straightened up. A few seconds later
  came the laugh again, but from quite a different spot, and <i>le Bossu</i>
  spun round. Then again and again came that laugh, each time from a fresh
  place. Dimly I could see <i>le Bossu</i>, crouching on the bank, his head
  jerking round quickly at each sound: playtime evidently was not yet over. The
  murderous devil was to have a taste of his own medicine before the end.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, <i>Bossu</i>," came Hugh's drawling voice. "Your sparking-
  plugs are in my pocket. It was kind of you to give me the idea. Won't you
  come and get them?"</p>

  <p>A snarl was the only answer.</p>

  <p>"Five people, <i>Bossu</i>, have you murdered on this little trip. To say
  nothing of an attempt to brain me with a chimney-pot. I dislike people who
  try to brain me with chimney-pots, <i>Bossu</i>. So what are we going to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>And once again there came a snarl that was half animal in ferocity.</p>

  <p>"I can see you quite clearly, <i>Bossu</i>," mocked Hugh. "And you can't
  see me. Unfortunate, isn't it? Shall I put five perfectly good bullets into
  your carcass, one for each person you have murdered, or would you prefer to
  die another way?"</p>

  <p>There came a sudden crack from below me, and a shot went droning
  harmlessly over the Marsh.</p>

  <p>"Quite the wrong direction, my friend," said Hugh easily. "Don't, I beg of
  you, add a harmless cow to your bag. And you haven't answered my question.
  Which way would you prefer to die, <i>Bossu</i>? Because you are going
  to&mdash;very shortly. You won't say? Then I have a suggestion to make. You
  shall die as you have lived&mdash;by strangling. Does that appeal to your
  sense of humour?"</p>

  <p>Silence from below, and once again Hugh laughed.</p>

  <p>"Putting on the robes of office, are you, <i>Bossu</i>? The false hump:
  the mask: the long black hood. I have been wondering off and on why you
  bothered with quite such an elaborate make-up. The mask I can understand:
  even the hump. But it was the hood that defeated me. Am I right in supposing
  that a fold of loose stuff like that round your neck, gives you a
  considerable advantage if your adversary tries to meet you at your own game
  and endeavours to strangle you? I can assure you that you needn't be afraid
  of giving away any of your parlour secrets: you will never need them again.
  You won't speak? Not very chatty to-night, are you, <i>Bossu</i>?"</p>

  <p>It was growing lighter now, and I could plainly see the great black figure
  below me. He was staring around like a wild beast at bay, trying to locate
  Drummond, and in his right hand was an ugly-looking revolver. And knowing the
  nature of the brute I slipped my own gun a little further forward: it was not
  a moment for taking chances. "It was clever of you to think of the aeroplane
  to-day," went on his invisible tormentor. "Indeed I don't mind admitting it
  was a stroke of genius. Very nearly&mdash;so very nearly&mdash;it enabled you
  to pull it off. In fact, <i>Bossu</i>, I quite agree with all that that dear
  fellow Victor Matthews said about you. But it doesn't alter my opinion that
  you are a nasty bit of work: so nasty, to be exact, that I grow weary of you.
  I would fain seek ale in my humble cottage. Throw your gun into the water,
  <i>Bossu</i>."</p>

  <p>The drawling voice had ceased: the order came curt and stern. But the man
  below still glared savagely round him. Came a crack, and a stab of flame.
  Another crack from <i>le Bossu</i>, who had fired at the flash, and Hugh's
  mocking laugh.</p>

  <p>"Through your hump that time, <i>Bossu</i>, and more peril to the cows
  from you. I am a very much better shot than you, so if you take my advice you
  won't go on playing at that game. I give you exactly five seconds to throw
  your gun into the water. The next time I fire it will be through your
  revolver hand."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two <i>le Bossu</i> seemed to hesitate: then without a
  word he flung his revolver into the creek.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Hugh curtly. "Now, <i>Bossu</i>, put your hands above your
  head."</p>

  <p>Again came a momentary hesitation, then his arms, grotesquely draped in
  the black hood, went above his head. And simultaneously Hugh emerged from
  behind a sand dune twenty yards away. His gun was in his hand, and he walked
  slowly along the edge of the water till he reached <i>le Bossu</i>. And then
  for a space there was silence.</p>

  <p>I watched fascinated: had ever day dawned on a more incredible scene? This
  monstrous masked devil&mdash;this murderer many times over, facing a man in
  whose face there was no glint of pity.</p>

  <p>"Strictly speaking, <i>Bossu</i>, I suppose I should hand you over to the
  police," said Drummond quietly. "But we are not speaking strictly at the
  moment. And so I propose to give myself the extreme pleasure of anticipating
  the hangman. Do not imagine, <i>Bossu</i>, that I shall suffer in any way. I
  have here a witness in the shape of Mr. Darrell who will swear that you made
  a dastardly assault upon me, should any questions arise."</p>

  <p>He paused: then he flung his revolver up to me.</p>

  <p>"Right, strangler, I am ready. Do you begin, or shall I?"</p>

  <p>And now, the necessity for concealment gone, I stood up. I was almost
  shaking with excitement, but neither man paid any attention to me. <i>Le
  Bossu</i> had dropped his arms, and was crouching a little. His body swayed
  slightly from side to side: his hands, with the fingers curved like steel
  hooks, were in front of him, stretched out towards Hugh. And suddenly, like a
  flash, he sprang.</p>

  <p>Came a dull heavy thud, and a short laugh from Drummond, as <i>le
  Bossu</i> crashed on his back.</p>

  <p>Hugh's fist, with fourteen stone behind it, had caught him on the point of
  the jaw.</p>

  <p>"Fight on, strangler," said Hugh quietly. "Fight on. There is no time
  limit to this round. "</p>

  <p>And then to my amazement he stepped back a pace. He was staring at <i>le
  Bossu</i> fixedly with an expression on his face I couldn't fathom.</p>

  <p>"By God! Peter," he cried, "his eyes have gone green. The brute is not
  human."</p>

  <p>But human or the reverse, the next instant he was fighting for his life.
  Snarling and panting, infuriated by the blow, <i>le Bossu</i>, for the next
  minute, gave Hugh all he wanted. Once he got his hands to Drummond's throat,
  only to have them torn away. He tried to wrap himself round Drummond: he
  fought like a maddened beast. And at one moment I, who knew his strength,
  began to feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>But not for long: the strangler had met his match at last. Under the hood
  went Hugh's vice-like hands, and the snarling gave place to a hideous
  gurgling noise. Then that, too, ceased. And when Hugh finally relaxed his
  grip, it was into the boat, which he had planned to take him to safety, that
  <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i> fell dead.</p>

  <p>"His eyes were green, Peter," Hugh said to me. He was rubbing his hands
  together thoughtfully. "A sort of greeny yellow."</p>

  <p>He bent over the dead man, and ran his hands through his pockets.</p>

  <p>"The loot," he said curtly. And then&mdash;"Greeny yellow. For a moment it
  shook me."</p>

  <p>"Anyway," I remarked, "Jean Picot will strangle no more."</p>

  <p>He stared at me thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You'll blame me, Peter: you'll all of you blame me. I ought to have told
  you sooner. But I never thought it would be quite such touch and go as
  this."</p>

  <p>He stepped into the boat, and ripped off the mask and hood from the dead
  man. And I gave an involuntary cry.</p>

  <p>"You knew?" I almost shouted.</p>

  <p>"All along," he said.</p>

  <p>For the man who lay dead in the boat, his face still distorted in the
  snarl of death, was Victor Matthews.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>XIV. &mdash; IN WHICH THE "MAID OF<br>
  ORLEANS" RETURNS FROM BOULOGNE</h2>

  <p class="first">MY dear people," remarked Drummond lazily, "you have every
  right to pelt me metaphorically with bad eggs. I abase myself: I grovel. I
  should have let you into the secret. My only excuse is that between you I
  thought you'd give it away to the swab: and in addition I believed I had the
  situation easily in hand."</p>

  <p>We were all of us sprawling in easy chairs in his garden late that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>"How did you spot it?" demanded Freckles.</p>

  <p>"I spotted it when he was telling us the tale," said Hugh. "All about the
  Ch&acirc;teau du Lac Noir, which, incidentally, I have taken the trouble to verify.
  It was all absolutely true. In fact, where Matthews' cleverness came in was
  that all the way through ninety per cent, of what he told us was the truth.
  But to go back to the moment when I spotted it. He reached out his left hand
  to pick up a glass of ale. In doing so his sleeve slipped back, and on his
  forearm were some most peculiar red marks. They were evidently caused
  recently, because in places the blood was showing purple under the skin. And
  I found myself wondering idly what could have caused them. I suppose
  suspicions like that come in a flash, and to start with it was only a
  suspicion. It struck me that they were exactly the sort of marks that would
  be caused by a dog savaging a man's arm that was protected by a sleeve. What
  does a fellow do, instinctively, if an animal flies at him? He flings up his
  left arm to protect his face, and uses his right for attack. I studied his
  sleeve. The cloth was not torn, but its condition was on the tired side. And
  from that moment I began to read everything that happened by the light of the
  supposition that Victor Matthews was <i>le Bossu Masqu&eacute;</i>. I was prepared
  to abandon it at any moment, but it was always present in my mind. The
  revolver shot through his coat, of course, was a very old trick. It might
  have been fired by someone else: equally well it might have been fired by
  himself as a blind. The first thing was to go through everything that had
  happened, and find out if there was any episode that ruled it out. And up to
  date there wasn't. The chimney-pot on my head: there was no reason why
  Matthews shouldn't have done it. You get the line I was going on? True, there
  was no proof that he had: but there was no proof that he hadn't. Therefore
  the chimney-pot didn't rule him out.</p>

  <p>"Stealing John's plan. Once again there was nothing to prove that Matthews
  wasn't the culprit. He had plenty of time to go to Laidley Towers, steal the
  plan, and then be back at Spragge's Farm at the hour we saw him.</p>

  <p>Then came number one difficulty&mdash;my sparking-plugs. True, there was
  time for him to have walked back to where the car was, after he had been
  caught by the light, whilst we were lying up. It didn't absolutely rule him
  out&mdash;but I didn't like it very much. And Jean Picot began to float into
  my mind. Where did he come in? It was him we had seen skulking by the
  warehouse when we started in the car. Was he in league with <i>le Bossu</i>?
  If so what about the Vandalis? At that time I had to leave a lot to chance,
  and all I had arrived at up to date was that nothing had happened which
  absolutely ruled him out.</p>

  <p>"Then came the biggest poser of all. Why, in view of the fact that he had
  got well away from us, after the murder of Gaspard, had he deliberately
  delivered himself, so to speak, into our hands? Well, the answer to that,
  after a good deal of thought, struck me this way. We were a completely
  unexpected factor in his calculations. Four large men, barging round for
  sport, were a complication he hadn't bargained for at all. He had failed to
  get into Temple Tower, through knowing nothing about the verse at the back of
  the plan. So he knew he would have to try again the following night. And he
  came to the instantaneous decision that if we were going to be there he would
  sooner have us as allies than enemies. That seemed to answer that.</p>

  <p>"Then the Inspector arrived on the scene with the information about the
  Nightingale's murder. And I cast my optic on Matthews' face. There was no
  doubt about it: the news had upset him. He was annoyed. How did that fit in
  with my assumption?</p>

  <p>"All right: at any rate, it didn't disprove it. When he murdered the
  Nightingale his idea was that he would be through with the whole thing that
  night, and since the Nightingale had served his purpose by supplying the
  ladder, he was a nuisance who might well be removed. If you remember,
  Matthews himself said all this afterwards, which was where his damned
  cleverness came in. It was true, and his momentary annoyance was due to the
  fact that, having failed to get in, the body had been found; as he said, it
  cut <i>le Bossu</i> short for time, meaning that it cut him himself short for
  time. Then along comes Miss Verney with the news about Gaspard, and he
  realises that both these murders, which wouldn't have mattered if he had
  succeeded the night before, are now going to complicate things badly. Police,
  reporters&mdash;the light of day on Temple Tower&mdash;altogether very
  awkward. How was he going to rectify it? I assure you I was as interested as
  he was.</p>

  <p>Well, we know how he rectified it. The cold-blooded, unscrupulous devil
  proceeds to murder both the Vandalis, and throws suspicion for all four
  murders on Vandali. Matthews was Mr. Thomas of the Dolphin. But it was there
  he nearly overstepped the mark. He had forgotten Jean Picot, a gentleman with
  whom I had a long talk yesterday afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Jean Picot is another of these birds with a past, and Jean Picot has been
  serving two masters. He had been with the Vandalis as chauffeur for three
  years, and in his queer way was absolutely devoted to her. But as I say, he
  had a past, and Matthews knew that past. And so he had but little difficulty
  in persuading Picot to help him. And, as a matter of fact, it was Picot who
  actually removed the plugs from the car, acting under Matthews' orders.</p>

  <p>"But when it came to the murder of the Vandalis, Picot stuck in his toes.
  He knew it was Matthews who had done it&mdash;or Thomas as he called
  him&mdash;but he couldn't prove it. And exactly what happened in that room we
  shall never know. As Mr. Thomas, Matthews had undoubtedly become acquainted
  with the Vandalis. And presumably he carried out that double murder in much
  the same method as he described it. Only he put it on Picot.</p>

  <p>"A clever touch, that. In the first place it gave him a ready-made
  <i>Bossu</i> to plant on us: in the second, it would fit in with any possible
  attempt Picot might make to get even. In fact, I should imagine that our
  friend, as he sat in the dining-room that evening, just before Picot' s
  shooting practice, must have thought himself on velvet.</p>

  <p>"He had removed four obstacles in his path, without any suspicion falling
  on him. The outside public thought the murderer was Vandali: we thought it
  was Picot. In addition to that he had all of us eating out of his hand. And
  at that time I thought, as I told you Peter, that his plan was one of
  subtlety. He had presented us with the map&mdash;incidentally, how any of you
  could ever have thought that was an accident I don't know. It was the one
  flaw in an otherwise brilliant scheme. However, he had to take a chance, and
  he took it.</p>

  <p>"We now know he made an alteration in the verse, but that does not affect
  what I believe his scheme to have been. It merely gave him an alternative
  line of action which, as events turned out, he availed himself of. And his
  scheme, I am convinced, was this. He intended to remain Victor Matthews with
  us to the end. With us he would have entered the grounds. No trace of <i>le
  Bossu</i>. With us he would have found the entrance: with us he would have
  forced his way into the house, and in the name of law and order compelled
  Granger to disgorge. And then, somehow or other, he would have given us the
  slip. That was his scheme, I am convinced, before I gave way to an extremely
  stupid impulse.</p>

  <p>"You remember when Picot let drive through the window and Matthews turned
  out the lights. Well&mdash;I couldn't help it: I knew I was a fool at the
  time &mdash;but I just couldn't help it. The door opened slowly, didn't
  it?&mdash; largely because I pulled it. Then it shut, largely because I shut
  it. And Matthews screamed and gurgled, largely because I had my hands on his
  throat."</p>

  <p>"You're the limit, Drummond," cried Freckles ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"Far from it, young fellow," said Hugh gravely. "It was a damned silly
  thing to do, knowing what I did. From being absolutely confident that he had
  us fooled, he suddenly became suspicious. Was it Picot who had caught him by
  the throat, or was it not?</p>

  <p>"However, the mischief was done, and I did my best to rectify it. I took
  the precaution of making him sleep in a room from which he could not get out
  without my knowledge, and I did my best to allay his doubts. But I know I
  didn't succeed. It was then he changed his plan, and took the alternative. It
  was then he decided to work alone: to make use of what he knew was the right
  verse, and leave us to stew in the wrong one.</p>

  <p>"But at once he was confronted with a difficulty. Miss Verney and Scott
  were going to find the tree, and under his first scheme of working with us
  that was good enough for him: working alone it wasn't. He had to find that
  tree for himself. And he thought of the aeroplane.</p>

  <p>"Admittedly the man was a devil incarnate, but you can't deny it was a
  stroke of genius. Not only did it make him independent of us, but it had the
  secondary effect of lulling me into a fool's paradise. I did not see how he
  could get in without us. That he was going to have a dip at it that night I
  knew: I was lying up in the Marsh yesterday when he moved the motor-boat from
  its original position to where Peter and I found it."</p>

  <p>"That's when you took the plugs?" I said, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"How was he going to get in?" he went on.</p>

  <p>That was what seemed to me to be the essence of the whole thing. And all
  through yesterday I still believed that my original idea was right.</p>

  <p>Knowing nothing of the aeroplane or the change in the verse, it was
  impossible to allow for the alternative plan. Even when he gave his cry for
  help over the telephone, I still felt absolutely safe, though that little
  effort positively reeked of suspicion. Why an A. A. box, of all places, to
  ring up from? And by what possible fluke of fate could he expect us to
  believe <i>le Bossu</i> was waiting there for him? But once again, believing
  that we were indispensable to him, I saw no risk in going. In fact, to tell
  you the truth, so preposterous did it seem to me as a blind, that I half
  believed something had happened to him. That possibly he had persuaded Picot
  for some reason or other to go with him in the car, and that in the middle of
  a message to us, Picot had actually set on him. Anyway, we know he didn't,
  and Matthews got a start on us that, had it not been for Miss Verney, would
  have proved fatal. A very salutary thought, chaps: he got away with it as
  near as makes no odds, and but for her, he got away with it entirely.
  "Anyway, that's that: only one little ceremony remains. From inquiries I made
  yesterday I gather that Count Vladimir still lives in the Rue Nitot in Paris.
  And since this property is his "&mdash;he held up the velvet bag&mdash;" I
  took the liberty of telling him that a charming lady, accompanied by a
  graceless young blighter, would wait upon him in due course to restore it,
  and to entertain him with an account of how it was recovered. He expressed
  himself as delighted, and confirmed the fact that the reward still stood. And
  so I have much pleasure in presenting Miss Verney with the bag of nuts, prior
  to consuming one or even two beakers of ale."</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible, Captain Drummond," cried the girl, "We must share
  it."</p>

  <p>"My dear soul," said Hugh, with a grin, "it's too hot to argue. Peter
  would only spend it in drink and riotous living, and my share would go in
  bailing him out. As for John, churchyards are full of Inspectors of Taxes who
  have died of shock on seeing his income tax cheque. They didn't know there
  was so much money in the world."</p>

  <p>And so it ended&mdash;that strange affair which had started in an Apache
  revel nearly thirty years ago. Vengeance had come on the last two of that
  motor-bandit gang: vengeance had come on the mysterious being who had
  employed them. Whether his real name was Matthews no one will ever know. From
  inquiries we made, the fact emerged that there was a man of that name, whose
  description tallied with Matthews, employed in the Paris police round about
  1900, and whose reputation was above reproach. And if they were the same it
  may well be that it was an extraordinary example of dual personality, a
  second case of Jekyll and Hyde. For without some such explanation it is
  well-nigh impossible to conceive how the suave, capable, courteous man we had
  known could turn on the sudden into a snarling brute-beast murderer.</p>

  <p class="first">The <i>Maid of Orleans</i> drew slowly into the side.</p>

  <p>Leaning over the rail was the usual row of cross-Channel passengers
  calling out greetings to their friends on the quay. An odd Customs man or two
  drifted out of their respective offices: the R.A.C. representative raised
  entreating hands to High Heaven lest one of his charges should arrive without
  his triptyque. In fact, the usual scene on the arrival of the Boulogne boat,
  and mentioned only because you must end a story somewhere, and Folkestone
  Harbour is as good a locality as any.</p>

  <p>Standing side by side on the quay were two men, waving their hands in that
  shame-faced manner which immediately descends on the male sex when it
  indulges in that fatuous pursuit. The targets of their innocent pastime were
  two women whose handkerchiefs fluttered in response from the upper deck. And
  since these two charming ladies have come into the matter again, it might be
  as well to dispose of them forthwith. They were, in short, the wives of the
  two men, arriving on their lawful occasions from Le Touquet, where they had
  played a little golf and lost some money in the Casino. Which is really all
  that needs to be said about them, except, possibly, their first remark,
  chanted in unison, as the ship came to rest.</p>

  <p>"Have you both been good while we've been away?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," answered the two men, also in unison.</p>
