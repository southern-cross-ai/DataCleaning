<h2>CHAPTER I.--Stewart Towers.</h2>
<p>Embosomed in stately fir and pine trees, Stewart Towers stood upon the brow
of a low hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>If sombre, the place was romantic enough to have satisfied the soul of a
poet, or painter, or modern writer of fiction, and it would have satisfied its
owner, Malcolm Stewart, but for one thing.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>The condition on which Malcolm Stewart inherited Stewart Towers was, that
until marriage he should reside there for not less than three months in every
year; or to be more precise, that he should reside there during the three
summer months, from December to February inclusive, which, it will be seen
included Christmas Day. He was to reside in any portion of it, said the will,
except the Northern Tower rooms, which were to be reserved for the occupation
of two nieces of the legatee.</p>
<p>The strange old man had further decided in his will, that Malcolm Stewart
should marry one of these two ladies.</p>
<p>And unless by their own free choice they married other men the will bound
him to remain free to wed one or the other. On the day that he discontinued
residence, during this special three months, or married any other woman, there
passed from him Stewart Towers and the greater part of a large fortune.</p>
<p>For the first three months of Malcolm's enforced residence, the two maidens
had at the same time in company with an aunt, as chaperon, occupied the Tower
rooms.</p>
<p>This was exasperating to Malcolm, for his dislike of the two girls almost
amounted to hatred. When he met them in the grounds, he seldom looked at or
spoke to them. One of these two, by his father's will, he had to marry, and
both seemed to be waiting for him. His soul dwelt in a wilderness at the
thought of it, the knowledge that they lived in the Tower rooms of his romantic
residence made life lonely and uncongenial. It was no company for him to have
them there; nor could he, for fear of ridicule invite friends to stay with him,
and in his heart he almost cursed the girls, and the will, and Christmas
time.</p>
<p>He determined however, to hold his own, and live it out, and force "the
ladies of the Tower," as the neighbourhood who knew about the affair, delighted
to call them, to tire of waiting and marry someone else.</p>
<p>Now it was strange that he should dislike them so, for they were young and
not uncomely. He had not known them in his father's life time, indeed had never
heard of them until the will was read to him under peculiar and somewhat
unfortunate circumstances; and they had never made themselves in any way
unpleasant to him, except that in obedience to their uncles stupid will, they
for three months in the year came to reside there.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>It was no doubt a stupid will, an extraordinary will, a most unseemly and
aggravating will, but it was the will and Malcolm Stewart and Alice and
Winifred Stewart had to abide by it, or half a dozen claiments would have
stepped in to dispossess them of the property at once. This was the state of
affairs when there dawned the second Christmas day of this singular story.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.--Under a Grey Sky.</h2>
<p>To make our story clear to the reader, it will be wise, perchance, to put
back the clock of time from the 25th of December, 18--, for a trifle over
twenty years. A baby boy had just awakened in a cottage by the sea, not more
than a quarter of a mile away from Stewart Towers. Blinking his eyes, he gazed
wonderingly from out of his soft cambric and fleecy woollen wrappings at his
nurse. The room was meanly furnished, but spotlessly clean. The personal
surroundings of the infant were rich and costly, as though he was a child of
expectancy and promise, whose advent had been desired and waited for, and who
was destined to a fortune and a name.</p>
<p>But the homely face of the nurse looked down pitifully upon the little
stranger as she whispered to herself rather than to the child:</p>
<p>"It's a hard, sad world you've come to, little beauty; you'd better have
stayed in the country where they wear no clothes."</p>
<p>At this she soothed the child with a motherly hand and placed some food
beside it in the cradle, and pressed the rubber teat into the little rosebud
mouth; the child sucked vigorously, and the kindhearted woman wished that it
had been its mother's breast instead.</p>
<p>"The wee things drink in love with their mother's milk," she thought,
looking disdainfully at the bottle.</p>
<p>"The child's the very image of its mother," said the good nurse to herself,
as she commenced her household work, "and I shall love the mite for its
mother's sake; but dear me! to think that this is Christmas Eve and she has
come and gone again and left this little mite behind her, and it's no more than
three months and a day. She was very close about herself--very close--and that
stupid Peter of mine seemed just as gone upon her as I was afterward
myself--and he knows no more about her. But she was a lady, and has some one
that loves her, but I don't know that she was married, although I am not going
to tell Peter. Men guess and think a lot themselves, and often know more than
they say, but I don't think that could have occurred to him."</p>
<p>At this Mrs. Sampson stepped across to the window to take a look at Peter,
for this morning she could see him occasionally, although he was a mile or more
away. In full view of the cottage window there stretched the great waters Of
the South Pacific Ocean, and far out at sea like a speck upon its placid bosom
was a fisherman's boat.</p>
<p>The good woman stood and watched it, as indeed well she might, for it
contained not only Peter Sampson, her husband, but Sonny Sampson, as the
neighbours called her only child, now grown to be a strong limbed youth, nearly
as tall as his father. They were schnapper fishing.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-03" id="id03"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-03.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>The woman stood and watched the boat, as now and again it would disappear
for a full half minute as it sank in the hollow between two waves. It was the
long roll of the Pacific across thousands of miles of open water to the south
east which caused these great waves to break in thunder and foam upon the iron
bound coast of south-eastern Australia.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-04" id="id04"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-04.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>The scene which spread itself before Nurse Sampson (for thus was she known
among the people of the place) was singular and romantic, if not actually
beautiful. A tiny bay had been formed by a cleft in the rugged, rock bound
shore. Here, for centuries and more, the ocean had washed up yellow sand
between the two rock strewn shores, which, in turn, a fresh water stream washed
back again. The miniature bay was a mere cleft in the rocky coast, so narrow
that a strong-armed man might have thrown a stone from the pile of water-worn
rocks on the one side to the dwarfed cliffs upon the other. There were a few
cottages overlooking the sea in addition to Peter Sampson's, and on the city
side, looking down upon the lowly homes of the fishermen, was the residence of
the eccentric Donald Stewart.</p>
<p>But, as Catherine Sampson stood there dreamily watching her husband's boat,
and also a distant coasting schooner, and the smoke of a steamer still hull
down on the distant horizon, she saw other things. There were grey clouds above
the land and sea, and they set her thinking about the mother and the child. Of
the mother of whom she knew so little, of the child she had yet to learn about
and understand. She was a woman of active temperament and cheerful disposition,
but the grey of the morning seemed to have cast its sombre tints upon her
mind.</p>
<p>It was good, perhaps, that it was so, for it is only as we see life under
varied aspects that we truly understand it. Sunshine hides as well as reveals.
There are things which will never be seen except in a darkened landscape; never
be learned except under sombre skies. The stars which lie hid in the daytime
shine out in the night, and we want to look at life under all conditions to
know it truly. This morning the grey side of it was uppermost to Peter
Sampson's wife.</p>
<p>"Ah me!" ejaculated the woman at last, as a sigh escaped her lips, "the wee
mite will be a sight of trouble and responsibility to me. I wonder why the good
God allows bairns to be born into a world as doesn't want them."</p>
<p>"But he's come to stay," continued the good woman, bustling about her work
to make up for lost time, "and he'll need to be cared for. Besides," she said,
"to-morrow will be Christmas Day."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.--A Stewart of Stewart Towers.</h2>
<p>Malcolm grew up a stirring child, under Nurse Sampson's fostering care. Not
that either she or Peter, or Sonny Sampson exactly understood him.</p>
<p>"Nothing tires his little limbs; from morn to night he runs and jumps and
plays, he needs one to be always watching him; and for mischief, I never saw
such a child, but I cannot whip him; if he is scolded he looks so penitent and
wise. He repeats everything we say and knows far too much for his little head."
Thus spake Mrs. Sampson to a neighbour, and they all knew that Malcolm Sampson
was not her child--but true woman that she was, she never wholly gave away the
secret of the child she loved. He was her child now she said, that was enough;
but none the less he was a child "out of Nazareth."</p>
<p>He found this out a few years afterward when he attended the public school
of the adjoining village. He had been taught at home as long as possible, for
it was a mile and a half away, and Mrs. Sampson dreaded sending him there
alone.</p>
<p>"Can'st fight?" said the big school bully to the little fellow, the first
afternoon at close of school. The words were accompanied by a stinging slap
across the face.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-05" id="id05"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-05.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>The tears sprang to the youngster's eyes for the blow was painful, and he
was unused to such punishment; but although he knew it not, he was the child of
pluck and culture, and he threw himself back in fighting attitude--Malcolm
against the school.</p>
<p>The crowd of youngsters cheered him and pushed in to separate him from the
bully, for all but the baser sort appreciate spirit and courage; but the latter
were too numerous by far, and the bully and his chums waylaid Malcolm later on
as he went home, and dragged him into the bush and beat him brutally.</p>
<p>He struck back as well as he was able; but they were five to one.</p>
<p>Nurse Sampson simply raged on his return with cut and swollen face.</p>
<p>"The wretched beasts of boys," she cried.</p>
<p>"There were five of them," said Malcolm, gravely, "all bigger than myself. I
did not cry very much, mother, and I hit them back."</p>
<p>He learned everything quickly. It was his nature to learn. He had to; it
came to him, both good and bad. The first he wished to know, the latter he
could not avoid; it forced itself upon him, for he had knowledge of good and
evil, as hath every child of genius. His schoolmaster took a great fancy to the
boy; he was "out of Nazareth," for the fisherman's cottage was evidently not
his natural home; and the thoughtful man of letters questioned with himself on
many occasions as to the pros and cons of Malcolm's origin. "It is strange," he
thought, "that this boy, named by his mysterious mother Malcolm Stewart, (for
he had obtained from Nurse Sampson a fragmentary account of his birth, etc.)
should be living in a fisherman's cottage under the shadow, as it were, of
Stewart Towers."</p>
<p>It has been said that Donald Stewart was the great man of the place. He was
supposed by the neighbours to be deeply interested in mines; but all agreed
that he was a rich man, for he kept servants and carriages; and when away for
months at a time, as was not infrequently the case, kept up Stewart Towers just
as though he had been living there.</p>
<p>He was a cultured, reserved man, and was generally understood to be a
widower without children, he had relatives in Scotland, and possibly in
Australia; but he talked little about himself to anyone. A few gentleman, at
rare intervals, were the only visitors known at the Towers. At which times the
sound of hilarious laughter, slightly suggestive of old Scotch whiskey, might
be heard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer, the housekeeper, who looked well after the appointments of
the mansion, was always to be found quietly supervising affairs, dressed in
black silk.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart's confidential man acted both as bailiff and butler, and took a
general oversight of the men about the stables and grounds. He collected the
rents of the estate, and generally represented the Towers to the people of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-06" id="id06"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-06.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Malcolm was nearing his fourteenth birthday, when a noteworthy event altered
the whole aspect of his life. That was the meeting of Malcolm one morning with
the master of the Towers.</p>
<p>A long avenue of trees led from the entrance gate into the grounds, and one
hot day in summer, Donald Stewart was smoking as he paced up and down under the
shady trees, absorbed in thought. Suddenly he found himself confronted by a
boy. The two stood for a moment and looked at each other, for on the face of
the elder there was depicted the most complete surprise.</p>
<p>"Good heaven! my lad, who are you, and where have you come from?"</p>
<p>Malcolm lifted his cap respectfully, and explained that he was a foster son
of Peter and Sarah Sampson. He hoped that he had not offended Mr. Stewart, he
had a message for Mrs. Mortimer at the Towers.</p>
<p>Donald Stewart still stood looking at him. Then throwing away his cigar, and
pulling the old felt hat he wore down on his head, he caught Malcolm by the arm
and said: "Boy, you are strangely like some one I once knew, take me to where
you live."</p>
<p>With his face buried in his hands, the proud master of Stewart Towers
listened for fully half an hour to the story nurse Sampson had to tell him.</p>
<p>The woman loved the boy and at once scented a secret, which might prove to
the boy's advantage; she grew garralous as the incidents of the boy's birth
came back to her recollection; but the man listened to the very end without a
word.</p>
<p>Then he said simply: "The boy is mine, the lady was my wife, it is a most
remarkable story; you have been kind to the lad and I will recompense you. Call
him in."</p>
<p>When the boy came in the old man broke down utterly, and wept as he embraced
and kissed his son. "My God!" he ejaculated, "what a thing to do, and to think
that I never knew of it."</p>
<p>It became known in the neighbourhood that Donald Stewart had adopted Peter
Sampson's boy, and that he was henceforth to be known as Malcolm Stewart. He
was sent to the city university; then was taken by his father for a year or two
of travelling in the old land. It was no wonder that Donald Stewart was proud
of him, he had thought himself childless, and suddenly found a son; who was
endowed with his mother's beauty and wit, and more than his father's
cleverness.</p>
<p>But just when gratification was at its highest, and prospects brightest, and
Malcolm about to celebrate his twenty-first birthday, Donald Stewart died, and
left a will which before taking up the thread of the story needs a few words of
explanation.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of Malcolm, Donald Stewart had promised an only
brother when dying to make provision for two nieces.</p>
<p>Nellie and Winifred Stewart were at school in South Australia when their
father died, and their Uncle's first will was made immediately afterward, under
which they inherited the Towers and other property.</p>
<p>Malcolm's appearance on the scene, had resulted in a long codicil which
practically annulled the will, and by its singular conditions as explained in a
previous chapter, seemed very likely to bring those most concerned into serious
difficulty with each other.</p>
<p>The girls heard of the codicil to the will through their aunt Mrs.
Shrimpton, some time before Malcolm did, and not unnaturally, although anxious
to see and know more about their new found cousin, felt very much
disappointed.</p>
<p>The sudden death of Malcolm's father was a great blow to him, and as at the
time he was suffering from over study, the executors advised him to leave for a
trip to New Zealand immediately after the funeral.</p>
<p>When he returned he settled down with a college friend at the Towers, but,
through some carelessness on the part of the executors, he was not advised as
to the singular conditions under which he was to inherit the property.</p>
<p>Malcolm was of a studious disposition, fond of reading, and music, and
literature, and at the time referred to, was collaborating with his friend
Frank Robertson in the writing of a book.</p>
<p>Jonas Brown, the butler, looked well after matters in the household and
outside, and Mrs. Mortimer attended to their residential comforts and
wardrobes, so that with an occasional day off for fishing or other amusement,
Malcolm lived a very quiet life.</p>
<p>Nurse Sampson was not forgotten, but she preferred her own cottage home; or
her foster son would have brought her to live at the Towers. Malcolm's one
grief was that he could find no authentic trace of his mother. The attempts he
had made to obtain information about her from his father had been unfortunately
unsuccessful. Not that Donald Stewart had actually refused to tell Malcolm, but
the subject had been deferred, until death suddenly intervened, and it was too
late.</p>
<p>While matters were thus quietly proceeding at Stewart Towers, one afternoon,
while Malcolm and his friend Frank Robertson were out for a days fishing, Alice
and Winifred, in charge of their aunt Mrs. Shrimpton, put in a sudden and most
unexpected appearance.</p>
<p>They had come up from South Australia by steamer, and been delayed several
days, much to Mrs. Shrimpton's alarm, who knew all about the conditions of the
will, for the day was the 30th of November; only one day before they were
actually required to be in residence to fulfil its conditions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shrimpton was tall, spare, and angular, with sharp cut features, and an
aggressive chin and nose. Her thin mouth bespoke determination and her grey
eyes resolution. She was dressed in a fashionable travelling gown, and as she
stepped out of the carriage and passed under the entrance portico she gave a
quick glance around, which might have intimated to a beholder that the Towers
would soon know of her arrival.</p>
<p>Closely following her were two intelligent bright faced girls also
fashionably dressed.</p>
<p>"It looks a jolly sort of place," whispered Alice, to her sister, "I wonder
whether Malcolm will be as nice as his residence?"</p>
<p>The ladies were at once shown into a large handsomely furnished reception
room, while the housemaid who opened the door, went to call "Mr. Brown the
butler."</p>
<p>"Mr. Stewart is not at home Madam," said the butler in answer to Mrs.
Shrimpton's inquiry.</p>
<p>"That's unfortunate," said the lady. "I presume, however, that the North
Tower rooms are ready for our occupation?"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon madam--I don't understand you," stammered Brown.</p>
<p>"You have a housekeeper," said Mrs. Shrimpton, "you had better send her to
me, no doubt she knows about our coming. These young ladies are cousins of Mr.
Malcolm Stewart."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer, on ordinary occasions, was a very amiable woman, but she was
now thoroughly bewildered; she knew nothing of any such arrangement as that
referred to by Mrs. Shrimpton.</p>
<p>She had not heard of any nieces of her late Master; she instinctively
resented the proposed residential arrangement; and suggested that the ladies
might leave their luggage in the carriage and await Mr. Malcolm's return.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Mortimer had not taken the exact measure of Mrs. Shrimpton. The
latter at once saw, as she thought, a deeply laid scheme to deprive her
sister's children of their claim upon their Uncle's property. The following day
was the first of December when, according to the will, they had to be in
residence in the Tower rooms.</p>
<p>The trustees had been notified that they were coming a week before
(unfortunately the letter had been mislaid by Mr. Gordon the trustee); here was
an evident attempt to hustle the girls out of their interest in the property.
But she would let them see!</p>
<p>She could not possibly give them possession of the Tower rooms; they might
wait for an hour or so, and she would have refreshments brought to them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shrimpton asserted however, that they had come to stay, and was about
to discharge the carriage, when the housekeeper interposed again.</p>
<p>"You had better keep the carriage Ma'am, I feel sure that you will not be
able to stay here."</p>
<p>For three long hours they waited, but no Malcolm appeared; both the
housekeeper and butler were evidently getting fidgety and had come in and out
of the room on one pretext and another several times.</p>
<p>At last, when Mrs. Mortimer suggested that Mr. Malcolm Stewart might not be
back that night and they had better call again on the morrow, Mrs. Shrimpton
aroused herself and drawing out of her handbag a pair of spectacles, and a copy
of the will, commenced to peruse the document with eagerness. Jonas and Mrs.
Mortimer the while staring at her with the greatest interest.</p>
<p>"Shall be in residence in the northern Tower rooms from the month of
December inclusive." Here she stopped her reading, and turning around to Alice
said, "you hear that my dear, and tomorrow is the first, and this woman says
your cousin Malcolm may not be back tonight, and that we cannot remain."</p>
<p>Here she stepped into the hall.</p>
<p>"Coachman!" she screamed at the top of her voice, "unharness the horses, and
leave the carriage at the front door. Put the horses into some paddock
adjoining the house."</p>
<p>"I beg pardon, ma'am; but I would advise him to do nothing of the sort,"
said Jonas, "the carriage will block up the entrance."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shrimpton had meant to sleep in it if necessary.</p>
<p>"Are you the butler?" queried Mrs. Shrimpton, ignoring the interruption.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, somewhat sulkily.</p>
<p>"And you're the housekeeper?" she said, looking at Mrs. Mortimer.</p>
<p>The latter nodded her head.</p>
<p>"Is there a steward of the estate or any one over you?" she asked, speaking
this time to the butler.</p>
<p>"Only Mr. Malcolm, and Mr. Gordon the Trustee."</p>
<p>"Well then, as Malcolm Stewart is away, send for Mr. Gordon."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon ma'am," said Jonas; "but what reason can I give for
troubling the gentleman? He lives nearly two miles away."</p>
<p>"Good reason you idiot," said the lady, "call the rest of the servants and
listen to Donald Stewart's will."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon ma'am; but I am not an idiot and I'll do nothing of the
sort," said Jonas.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Shrimpton paid no heed to him, and commenced to read the will
aloud, at which Jonas and the house-keeper listened with the utmost
eagerness.</p>
<p>As she proceeded their faces became pictures of astonishment.</p>
<p>"Are you sure Ma'am, that's a true copy of the old masters will," gasped
Jonas, when she had finished.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shrimpton deigned no reply, but simply said "send straight away and
fetch Mr. Gordon."</p>
<p>On the arrival of that gentleman, an hour afterward, possession of the four
rooms, in, and adjoining, the northern Tower, were given to the ladies;
Malcolm's things being tumbled out very unceremoniously.</p>
<p>"What an unfortunate thing it is," said Winifred, nearly crying to her
sister. "If I were cousin Malcolm I am sure I should hate to have my things
served so badly. Aunt has broken several of his trinkets, and I am sure there
will be a dreadful disturbance when he comes back."</p>
<p>"But it's great fun," replied Alice. "It's my opinion Mr. Gordon has kept
him in ignorance of the will on purpose. No doubt, was afraid to tell the young
man. Of course the whole thing is most absurd and stupid; but if Aunt Rhoda
does not go too far and spoil things, there is no reason why one of us should
not marry him."</p>
<p>"But what an unfortunate mistake it is that he did not know of our coming,"
said Winifred. "Aunt and Sally are unpacking our trunks downstairs, and
bundling all his nice things out most unceremoniously. I hate it all, and feel
more like a burglar than a visitor or resident."</p>
<p>"Don't be soft, Winnie. We are not bad looking girls, and my opinion is that
Malcolm will be very pleased to find us here. I am going to be as sweet as
sugar, and set my cap straight at him, and when we are married you can live
with us until Sir James Grant comes from India to marry you."</p>
<p>"What nonsense you talk. I don't believe Cousin Malcolm will take to either
of us. The very fact that he is expected to marry one of us will settle that,
and, as for Sir James Grant, you know there is nothing in it, and you ought not
to say such things."</p>
<p>This conversation, it may be said, took place on the summit of the North
Tower, from which there was a fine view of the grounds and bay and the great
waters of the Pacific Ocean. The girls had again and again exclaimed at the
beauty of the romantic scenery around them.</p>
<p>"Uncle was not so foolish, after all," said Alice. "Why, it would be
impossible to live in a place like this for a fortnight with any sort of a nice
young man without falling in love with him. And as for a boy like Malcolm, if
he has any romance or poetry in him, he'll capitulate to one of us before
Christmas, I think that I shall bring him up here to propose."</p>
<p>As she spoke, the western sky was flaming with the glory of a splendid
sunset. All around the roofs of the mansion were the great trees; while a
steamer, and a sailing vessel, and some fishermen's boats dotted the distant
waters.</p>
<p>"It's perfectly lovely," said Winifred.</p>
<p>"Yes," retorted Alice, "and loveliness has a singular tendency to make
people loving and loveable. Now, who could resist the temptation of making love
on a Tower like this?"</p>
<p>"But it's no use talking to you," said the lively girl, laughing at her
sister; "you are a regular Miss Prim, but I know that I'll either make Malcolm
marry me or have some fun out of him. I am going downstairs to ask Aunt Rhoda
whether we ought not to kiss him when we first meet. One of the girls at school
told me that cousins always kiss."</p>
<p>It need scarcely be said, however, that there was no kissing on Malcolm's
return. In fact, largely through Mrs. Simpson's lack of tact and judgment, the
great disturbance feared by Winnie actually took place.</p>
<p>Malcolm upbraided Mr. Gordon for not having previously made him acquainted
with the contents of the will; he stormed at Jonas for allowing his things to
be bundled out of his favourite rooms; and positively refused to meet either
Mrs. Shrimpton or his cousins, or have anything to do with them.</p>
<p>"Does the will really say that it is to be a joint occupation for three
months out of the twelve?" asked Malcolm, pacing angrily up and down the big
dining-room.</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon was a gentlemanly little man who did not like scenes, and was
terribly given to putting off an evil day.</p>
<p>"Look, Malcolm," he replied, "don't talk about it any more to-night, you are
only upsetting yourself. I don't care to ask Mrs. Shrimpton to lend me her copy
of the will, but I will get a copy from Smith, the lawyer, to-morrow, and in
the meantime, ask the ladies into dinner and be friendly. They are your
cousins, remember."</p>
<p>"But I have Robertson here, and would not let him know of the miserable will
for the world. Dine with them, indeed! after the way that woman has invaded the
place, and turned me out of my rooms. I'll put a six foot fence between
us!"</p>
<p>"But, Malcolm," remonstrated Mr. Gordon, "remember your father made this
will on purpose to throw you and your cousins into each other's society, and
they will have to be boarded by the establishment, and have a right to the use
of the dining room."</p>
<p>"Then I'll clear out and live in the servants' quarters, as far away as I
can get from them. Why, Robertson's mother and sisters were coming in to-night
after dinner."</p>
<p>"And I suppose Miriam Robertson," said Mr. Gordon, gloomily.</p>
<p>"And why not?" said Malcolm. "Do you think, Mr. Gordon, that I would sell
myself, soul and body, for the sake of Stewart Towers."</p>
<p>"What nonsense! There's no selling yourself about it; but if you marry
Miriam Robertson, you'll lose the property."</p>
<p>Malcolm went out and dined with the Robertsons that night, and flirted
desperately with Miriam. He was an "eligible," and ought to have known better,
and certainly felt thoroughly ashamed of himself afterward, both for his
attention to Miriam and his inattention to his cousins. He told his friend,
Frank Robertson, as much as he cared to about the whole thing, and wound up by
saying, "I am afraid that I have made a great fool of myself to-night old
fellow, in more ways than one; but that Mrs. Shrimpton would aggravate a
saint."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.--Alice Wants to be Worshipped.</h2>
<p>Malcolm did not erect a fence between himself and his cousins, nor was he in
love with Miriam Robertson, but things went far from smoothly.</p>
<p>During the first month of his cousins' residence he had taken up his abode
in rooms as far from the North Tower end of the mansion as possible. He made
for himself and friend a study and bachelor's den in the South Tower. Only once
had he met Mrs. Shrimpton and the girls inside the house, which was on
Christmas Day--for the will actually specified that the cousins should then
dine together.</p>
<p>Malcolm was certainly somewhat ashamed of the attitude he had taken up
toward his relations, and showed himself more polite, but there were no other
visitors, and the meal passed in embarrassed silence. Malcolm wanted to say
something, and Alice was dying to have some fun, but Winifred was actually
trembling with nervousness, and scarcely ate anything, while Mrs. Shrimpton was
on her dignity, which had been seriously affronted by Malcolm's behaviour to
them. Mentally, she hoped that the "handsome young fool," as she pleased to
call him, would marry Miriam Robertson, of whom she had heard, and then her
nieces would step into the full enjoyment of Stewart Towers and other
property.</p>
<p>It was a wretchedly dull Christmas evening, however, for the girls. Mrs.
Shrimpton was in her own room writing to her husband, and the two sisters went
up the Tower and sat down upon the cosy seats they had there made for
themselves. The cool sea breeze was grateful that warm summer's night, and the
moon, just past the full, rose with a silver wake behind it from the sea.</p>
<p>The girls talked in low tones about other Christmas's, when, instead of
being in a sombre place like Stewart Towers, at variance with a sombre cousin,
they were surrounded by merriment and fun.</p>
<p>"It's Christmas," said Winifred at last, "and you are quite out in your
calculations; Cousin Malcolm hasn't proposed to either of us."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we have been too good to him," said Alice, despondently.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, he lifts his hat now when he meets us, and he opened the drive gate
for me the other morning," said Winifred.</p>
<p>"I suppose you bowed, and blushed, and thanked him," said Alice.</p>
<p>"Really, I am afraid I only bowed, I was too nervous to thank him. I tried
to, but, however it was, no words would come."</p>
<p>"You are a goose, Winnie," said her sister. "I am thinking of writing him a
polite little note to ask him to take us out sailing."</p>
<p>"You will do nothing of the sort, Alice."</p>
<p>"Yes, I will, though, I am tired of this kind of a life; fancy not being
jolly with your own cousin. I shall tell him just what I think about him one of
these days, and also about that horrid will. I shall tell him, too, that I
would not marry him on any account, and that I'll just live in Stewart Towers
as long as I like, if only to plague him. They say he is eccentric because he
is writing a book, and so on; my own belief is that he is eccentric because he
is made too much of. Just see how Mrs. Mortimer fusses around him, and that
stupid Jonas, the butler. Frank Robertson is the only one that seems to dare to
say anything to him. I was in the shrubbery the other day when they were coming
up the drive together, and I stood behind a bush when they passed. Frank was
talking to him like a father."</p>
<p>"Some people like to be talked back to a little," said Winnie
reflectively.</p>
<p>"Malcolm Stewart is one of them," replied Alice, "and it's my belief he
would worship a girl that was really clever enough to boss him, and show him
his faults without actually making him think little of himself. He's really a
handsome, clever fellow, but he's regularly spoilt."</p>
<p>"And are you positively going to give him up?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Winnie, dear, you may have him. I'll tell you as a great secret
because it's Christmas, which, you know, is a time of tender confidences, I
believe I'm half in love with Frank Robertson."</p>
<p>The weeks slipped by and Alice was as good as her word. She managed somehow
to let her cousin see that she cared as little about him as he seemed to care
about them. One thing puzzled them, however, Malcolm might often be seen
walking about on the north terrace, within sight and hearing of the Tower
apartments.</p>
<p>The ladies were at last informed by Mrs. Mortimer that Mr. Malcolm was
writing a book and had to walk about there when he was thinking out a chapter,
as it had been a favourite spot of his, and was in full view of the bay, near
which he had been born. He had tried other parts of the grounds, but he could
always think best just there.</p>
<p>"He is very particular to explain to us why he frequents our end of the
Towers," said Mrs. Shrimpton.</p>
<p>The three months, however, were nearly up and Mrs. Shrimpton and her nieces
had arranged to leave the Towers on the very day following that prescribed for
their residence by the will.</p>
<p>Alice was in high spirits at the idea of a change from their quiet life,
and, as she put it, her literary-smitten cousin.</p>
<p>She was on fairly friendly terms, now, with Frank Robertson, somewhat to
Malcolm's annoyance. Frank had asked her who it was sang the semi-sacred songs
he often heard, and she had gravely informed him that Winnie was the
songstress, but that she usually played.</p>
<p>"And who is it does the comic business, Miss Stewart?"</p>
<p>"Oh that's Mrs. Shrimpton," was Alice's reply.</p>
<p>"You don't say so," said Frank, "Malcolm would not believe it."</p>
<p>"Were they very rowdy songs?" asked Alice, demurely,</p>
<p>"H'm--somewhat rowdy," said Frank.</p>
<p>"Then, I must have been out," said Alice, "when they were sung. Did Mr.
Malcolm want to know who sang them?"</p>
<p>"He was a bit surprised at hearing such songs at your end of the house,"
said Frank, smiling.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Robertson, we are going away to-morrow, and you can tell my
cousin that we are not at all sorry to go, and you may say too that it's my
sister, Winifred, that sings those very rowdy comic songs. Good Night."</p>
<p>No matter how much you are opposed to people, there is always something
about a place which makes the word good-bye pathetic, and when Frank told
Malcolm over dinner in their accustomed bachelors quarters at the south end of
the house that the girls were going, he seemed to eat his food less
heartily.</p>
<p>"I'll be bound the girls will be sorry to go after all; but we've been
awfully bearish Malcolm, and it's your fault."</p>
<p>"You mean that it's Mrs. Shrimpton's fault," replied Malcolm.</p>
<p>"No I don't," said Frank.</p>
<p>"They will be back again in nine months time," said Malcolm, and it was hard
to know by the tone of his voice whether he was glad or sorry.</p>
<p>"I've been talking to Alice to-night," said Frank, "she says that it's Mrs.
Shrimpton sings those rollicking comic songs."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it."</p>
<p>"But Alice says that she plays and the others sing."</p>
<p>"Well," said Malcolm, "if Alice does not sing at all, it may be Mrs.
Shrimpton; but I would not have given her credit for possessing such a voice.
But a shy creature like Miss Winifred would never sing such songs as I have
sometimes heard there. I have wished them at Jericho; those wretched songs have
spoiled some of the best chapters of our book."</p>
<p>The night was warm and Frank rose from the table and threw up a window; they
had sat late over dinner--they could hear a city clock striking eight.</p>
<p>Just then the rich tones of the piano in the North Tower drawing-room were
heard, and a moment afterward a rich contralto voice commenced to sing
"Listening."</p>
<p>"Light a cigar and come round under the trees," said Frank, "the grass is
thick and they won't hear us."</p>
<p>Malcolm obeyed without a word, and the two young men stood in entranced
silence, as the voice sang--</p>
<p>I am thinking of the old days</p>
<p>Of the woodland on the hill, etc.</p>
<p>"That's Winnie singing," said Malcolm, as the voice hushed. "I am afraid
that I have been extremely uncivil to the girls," he continued.</p>
<p>It was not much of an apology to make, but Frank knew there was more meant
than was said. Malcolm was regretting his absurd and uncousinly behaviour. "I
wish she'd sing again," said Malcolm, sentimentally. "You know--some really
sweet thing that it would please one to remember."</p>
<p>Just then some one drew near to the open window, and looked out a bit
suspiciously, and then said, "Now, Winnie, sing a nice pathetic farewell song
to Stewart Towers; something to make us all cry, as did 'The Old Folks at Home'
at that first concert on board the steamer in the Mediterranean."</p>
<p>"That's Alice," said Frank, in an undertone, "so it's Winnie that will sing
again."</p>
<p>Malcolm was extremely fond of good music, and he leaned against a tree that
he might the better listen.</p>
<p>A skilful hand touched a few chords on the piano; then came a quaint,
pathetic prelude; and then, to the horror and dismay of the listeners, the same
rich voice warbled forth the following farewell doggerel to Stewart
Towers:--</p>
<p>Oh, who will smoke my meerschaum pipe--</p>
<p>Meerschaum pipe!</p>
<p>Oh, who will smoke my meerschaum pipe--</p>
<p>Meerschaum pipe!</p>
<p>Oh, who will smoke my meerschaum pipe</p>
<p>When I am far away!</p>
<p>Some other man. Some other man.</p>
<p>Bad man! Bad man!</p>
<p>Oh, who will wear my cast-off boots--</p>
<p>Cast-off boots!</p>
<p>Oh, who will wear my cast-off boots--</p>
<p>Cast-off boots!</p>
<p>Oh, who will wear my cast-off boots</p>
<p>When I am faraway!</p>
<p>Some other man. Some other man.</p>
<p>Bad man! Bad man!</p>
<p>Oh, who will darn my poor old socks--</p>
<p>Poor old socks!</p>
<p>Oh, who will darn my poor old socks--</p>
<p>Poor old socks!</p>
<p>Oh, who will darn my poor old socks</p>
<p>When I am far away!</p>
<p>Some other man. Some other man.</p>
<p>Bad man! Bad man!</p>
<p>Oh, who will kiss her cherry lips--</p>
<p>Cherry lips!</p>
<p>Oh, who will kiss her cherry lips--</p>
<p>Cherry lips!</p>
<p>Oh, who will kiss her cherry lips</p>
<p>When I am far away!</p>
<p>Some other man. Some other man.</p>
<p>Bad man! Bad man!</p>
<p>The emphasis on the last "Bad man! Bad man!" was most pronounced.</p>
<p>The two men turned away as the window was closed and the lights suddenly
extinguished.</p>
<p>"It must have been Mrs. Shrimpton," said Malcolm, but his voice belied his
words. Frank, very wisely, said nothing.</p>
<p>The following morning cards were laid upon Malcolm Stewart's plate at
breakfast. They announced the departure, by an early train, of Mrs. Shrimpton
and the Misses Stewart to South Australia.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.--How Winifred Came to Say "Yes."</h2>
<p>That song provoked more controversy between Malcolm and Frank as to its
authorship and general accuracy, and suitableness to the occasion, than did
ever the song of Solomon or the Book of Job. Frank named it "The lady's
farewell to a bad man," and said it was no more than they both deserved.</p>
<p>Malcolm contented himself with arguing that Winifred could not possibly have
sung it, as was suggested by what they heard Alice say at the window.</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Frank. "It was Mrs. Shrimpton that sang it. She knows
that you occasionally smoke a meerschaum pipe."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it," said Malcolm, "it was Alice, and she has a wonderful
voice; but it is, unfortunately, associated in my mind with this very vulgar
song."</p>
<p>Vulgar or not, however, Frank discovered the whole four verses written on
Malcolm's blotting pad the next morning. And the funny thing was, that he said
nothing about it, but refreshed his memory where he had forgotten a line or
two, and hummed a snatch of the tune until Malcolm expostulated with him later
on in the morning.</p>
<p>Frank took it very quietly, but reported to his sister when he next went
home that their book was not progressing very satisfactorily. They had been out
fishing a good bit, and Malcolm had taken to writing poetry, which he thought a
bad sign in an author.</p>
<p>"And pray what do you do now the Miss Stewarts and Mrs. Shrimpton have left
the Towers?" asked his sister, somewhat maliciously.</p>
<p>"Oh, I've taken to darning my poor old socks and smoking a meerschaum pipe,
until they come back again," said Frank.</p>
<p>"What rubbish!" said his sister.</p>
<p>Then Frank could not resist the inclination to tell his sister about the
ladies' farewell song to Stewart Towers, and the two of them went into fits of
laughter.</p>
<p>But Frank afterward felt a bit sorry and ashamed of himself for telling
about it it was like repeating something he had surreptitiously overheard, and
in his heart of hearts, he knew that it was Alice who had sung that song.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Six months had passed, the routine of things was very much as usual at the
Towers, Malcolm had been talking of taking a trip to Melbourne, but somehow he
had not gone, when one morning the mail bag was found to contain a fairly bulky
parcel.</p>
<p>Opening it, Malcolm discovered two books, one addressed to himself and the
other to Frank. They were at breakfast, so he pushed Frank's book over to him
saying "that's the report I expect from the University."</p>
<p>Frank cut open the inner paper-cover leisurely, as Malcolm proceeded with
his breakfast.</p>
<p>"Jerusalem!" he suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Malcolm.</p>
<p>"Open your parcel," he said. "I think you will find a new book in it,
written by some one you know."</p>
<p>Malcolm tore off the cover of the parcel, and there lay in his hand a new
book--a brand new book, a book fragrant with the odour of the publishing house.
He thought the title seemed strange, but on perusing it further he was simply
dumb-founded. It was a new novel entitled 'Bad Man's Land' presented with the
compliments of the author, and on the title page he read "written after a three
months enforced residence on a Tower." It was a clever book, full of humour,
and wisdom, and smart biting things. It was superbly illustrated; many of the
pictures being reproductions of familiar scenes around the Towers, and they
were almost all signed A. J. S., which both men knew to be Alice's
initials.</p>
<p>It was a woman's book, Malcolm said, as though in disparagement; but they
spent the whole morning reading it, and when Frank finally closed it, it was
with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"It's a remarkably clever book," he said, "and is bound to catch on, and it
serves us both jolly well right; but does she not rub it into the men."</p>
<p>"I am very glad," said Malcolm, "that she does not make any personal
references to us."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing, I was prepared for that, an author's personal friends
or personal enemies, expect it! I was afraid we should find our portraits
somewhere in it."</p>
<p>The following December the three ladies were again in residence in the North
Tower rooms in compliance with Donald Stewart's will.</p>
<p>There had been no correspondence between the cousins and both Alice and
Winifred had the book upon their consciences, for Winnie had written it
assisted by Alice's suggestions and clever illustrations. Both girls felt
somewhat shy of the meeting.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-07" id="id07"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-07.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Malcolm and Frank both called on the day of their return, but the young
ladies deputed Mrs. Shrimpton to receive their visit, and she intimated
somewhat cooly that they thought it best to preserve intact their former
household arrangements.</p>
<p>"By George! Malcolm," said Frank, "it does not look as though either of your
cousins wanted very badly to marry you, does it? That was a mere excuse about
being tired and not very well."</p>
<p>"I expect it's 'swelled head' they are suffering from, the result of
successful authorship," said Malcolm, who was much mortified at the reception
they had had.</p>
<p>For a whole week the only sight they could get of the girls was when in the
cool of the evening they occupied their favorite seats on the Tower, and then
Mrs. Shrimpton was always with them.</p>
<p>The young men, however, never neglected to take an evening stroll together
under the terrace, where they could both see and be seen.</p>
<p>"I believe Winifred has grown," said Malcolm.</p>
<p>"And so has Alice," said Frank. "I should not be a bit surprised to hear
that they are both engaged."</p>
<p>"Nor I either," said Malcolm, moodily.</p>
<p>It was growing dusk, but the figures of the girls, who were dressed in
white, could be seen above the Tower battlements.</p>
<p>"They have got up," said Frank, "and are going down. You may depend upon it,
it's Mrs. Shrimpton that has got them to promise not to speak to us."</p>
<p>"She always spoils everything," said Malcolm. "I don't believe Eve would
have tempted Adam if Mrs. Shrimpton had been about."</p>
<p>Frank laughed at this, and said something about there having been neither
Towers nor Mrs. Shrimpton's in those days. It might have been better for Adam's
posterity if there had been.</p>
<p>That night, however, Malcolm was wandering about the grounds alone,
searching for inspiration for his book, when he thought he heard an unusual
commotion at the North Tower end of the mansion. It was the sound of girls'
laughter. He hurried along, for, to his surprise, he saw a white figure
descending by a rope from the summit of the Tower to the ground. The lady was
evidently a bit of an athlete, for she let herself down with much deliberation.
Presently, however, he heard Winifred call out, "Alice, this rope is not long
enough. I am at the end of it, and I must be six feet from the ground."</p>
<p>"You'll hurt yourself," called out Malcolm, rushing forward to where his
cousin hung in mid-air, a few feet only from the grass.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she called out, with a scream at being discovered, and then loosed the
rope, and a moment afterwards Malcolm found his arms full of soft frills and
flounces and his cousin Winifred.</p>
<p>"You are not hurt?" he said, holding her quite an unnecessarily long time in
his arms.</p>
<p>"Of course not, put me down Malcolm."</p>
<p>It was fortunately dark so Malcolm could not see his cousins blushes as she
explained that in some fit of absent-mindedness their aunt had bolted the Tower
door, and not wishing to create a disturbance, Alice had proposed that they
should let themselves down by a rope.</p>
<p>"Then why did not Alice make the descent," said Malcolm.</p>
<p>"Oh she said that I was afraid, so I showed her that I wasn't."</p>
<center>
<p><a name="1201541h-08" id="id08"></a><img alt="" src="1201541h-images/1201541h-08.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Needless to say that after this affair the cousins were on a very different
footing. As Malcolm confessed afterward, too, he had fallen in love with his
cousin over her book. But Alice would have it that the descent from the Tower
had a good deal to do with Malcolm's prompt proposal and early marriage. "Why,"
she said, "I watched you both, and the way he held you in his arms told me that
he loved you. I almost wished that I had gone down myself instead, and that
Frank had been there ready to have caught me." However, in due time, either she
caught Frank or Frank caught her, it does not much matter which.</p>
<p>As both girls were orphans, and Mrs. Shrimpton wanted to get back again to
her husband and family in South Australia, an early double marriage was
arranged for, and both proved happy ones.</p>
<p>It should be added that the following Christmas-day at Stewart Towers was a
very different one to the first, also that the two husbands gave up
collaborating together, and never finished the book. Malcolm was clever enough,
and distinguished himself in other ways, and he said that he thought one author
was quite enough in a family.</p>
