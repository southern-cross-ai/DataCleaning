  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; UNDER ORDERS</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," I answered.</p>

  <p>"And you entirely follow my argument?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely."</p>

  <p>"It is imperative that active steps must be taken to preserve England's
  supremacy, and at the same time frustrate this aggressive policy towards us
  which is undoubtedly growing. I need not tell you that the outlook is far
  from reassuring. As a diplomatist you know that as well as I do. The
  war-cloud which rose over Europe at the end of the last Administration is
  still darkening. It therefore behoves us to avoid a repetition of the recent
  fiasco at St. Petersburg with regard to Port Arthur, and strive to prevent
  foreign diplomacy from again getting the better of us. You quite follow
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I have always striven to do my utmost towards that end," I answered.</p>

  <p>"I know, Crawford. I'm perfectly conscious of that, otherwise I should not
  have spoken so plainly as I have now done. Recollect that I've taken you into
  my confidence in this matter. You did well&mdash;exceedingly well&mdash;in
  Vienna, and showed most creditable tact and forethought. Because of that I
  have recalled you and selected you for this particular duty." And the
  speaker, the Most Honourable the Marquess of Macclesfield, K.G., her
  Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, paused with his
  dark expressive eyes fixed upon me. Under those eyes many a foreign
  diplomatist had quivered, for so keen was he of perception that he could
  divine one's inmost thoughts. This calm, thin, gray-faced, rather shabbily
  attired man, the great statesman upon whose actions and decisions the
  prosperity and integrity of the British Empire depended, had, from the
  earliest moment when I had entered the Foreign Office, treated me with
  friendly consideration and kindly regard, and now as, late on that dull
  afternoon in February, I sat in his private room in Downing street, whither I
  had been summoned from the Embassy at Constantinople, he spoke to me not as
  my master, but as my friend and counsellor.</p>

  <p>As an attache at Vienna, at Rome, and at the Porte I had worked under
  Ambassadors of various moods, but by this feeling of friendliness which the
  Marquess had extended towards me, I had, in my duties, always felt that I was
  serving the great statesman personally, and not merely the particular chief
  which for the time I chanced to be under. Undoubtedly the secret of the
  success of the Macclesfield Ministry in the management of foreign affairs was
  in great measure due to the amicability of his lordship towards the
  staff.</p>

  <p>"I cannot disguise from myself that this duty is extremely difficult," he
  went on, leaning back in his chair after a pause, and glancing around the
  fine room, with its life-sized portrait of her Majesty upon the green painted
  wall. "Nevertheless, secret services must sometimes be performed, and I have
  sufficient confidence in your diplomatic instinct to know that you will never
  act rashly, nor display any ill-advised zeal. The secret of England's
  greatness is her smart diplomacy, and in this affair you have, Crawford,
  every chance of distinction."</p>

  <p>"You may rely upon me to do my very best to fulfil this important
  appointment to your satisfaction," I replied. "I shall act with care and
  discretion."</p>

  <p>"And to you is due our peace with honour," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Act with that caution combined with dignity, as though you were directly
  serving her Majesty herself. Remember, I am only her servant."</p>

  <p>"No, no," he laughed deprecatingly. "True, I am the figure-head, but it is
  men such as you who man the ship. No Secretary has been more fortunate in his
  staff than I am to-day, for I am vain enough to think that although they are
  scattered in all quarters of the globe, yet a cordiality exists among them
  which is quite as strong as their patriotism. I am proud to think that in all
  our Embassies and Ministries we have no traitor."</p>

  <p>"The <i>esprit de corps</i> has been engendered by your lordship's
  personal interest in us, one and all," I remarked. "It was not so during the
  late Ministry."</p>

  <p>He merely raised his grey eyebrows, and tapped the edge of the table with
  the quill in his thin bony hand. I know that I had made a mistake in uttering
  that sentence, for he did not like ill things said of his political
  opponents.</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago, Crawford," he exclaimed, after a few moments' reflection,
  "it is just ten years ago this month if my memory serves me aright, when, in
  this very room I first made your acquaintance&mdash;you, the son of one of
  our most trusted and valued man who had ever served his Queen at a foreign
  Court, followed your father's footsteps, and entered the Foreign Office. You
  remember the advice and maxims I then gave you. That you have remembered them
  is evidenced by the discretion and ingenuity you have displayed in the
  various posts you have occupied. I only ask you still to recollect them while
  performing the difficult and important duties before you; duties in which I
  wish you every success and good fortune."</p>

  <p>Then his lordship rose, as a sign that our conference was at an end. He
  shook my hand warmly, with that cordiality which endeared him to every member
  of the Foreign Office staff, and simultaneous with the re-entry of Menton,
  his private secretary, who had been dismissed while we had talked, I went out
  and down the great staircase, that magnificent flight of stairs up which
  representatives of every country in the world climb to have audience of the
  grey-haired, refined statesman, whom Bismarck once referred to as "the ruler
  of Europe." The most tactful, alert, far-seeing Foreign Minister that England
  had had during the present century, to him was due the extension of the
  British Empire in all parts of the world during recent years, notably the
  acquisition of new countries in Africa with their untold mineral wealth, the
  occupation of Egypt, the firm policy in the Soudan, and the clever
  checkmating of Russia in the Far East. To his intimates he was mild-mannered,
  soft-voiced, and essentially a pleasant man, but to those highly ingenious
  and unscrupulous diplomats of the Powers who were ever striving to undermine
  England's prestige he was so dry, hard, and matter-of-fact that they feared
  him, and dreaded entering his presence, because in any argument they were
  invariably worsted, while if they attempted diplomacy they were very quickly
  confounded.</p>

  <p>Upon the Marquess of Macclesfield's tact and farsightedness depended the
  prosperity of England, the lives of her millions, and the peace of Europe. A
  single stroke of the pen, a hasty or ill-advised action, and a war might
  result which would cost our Empire millions in money and millions of valuable
  lives; an ill-worded Note might, he know, cause England's prestige to be
  wrecked, and thus precipitate her from her present proud position of first
  among the great nations of the world. Truly his position was no enviable one,
  and his salary of five thousand a year inadequate for the eternal anxiety
  ever upon him day and night for the preservation of his country's greatness
  and the honour of his Sovereign. Restless, whether at his country seat down
  in Hampshire, or at his town house in Grosvenor-square, he lived ever at the
  end of a telegraph wire, which brought him hour by hour information or
  inquiries from the various Embassies abroad, all of which demanded his
  personal attention and reply.</p>

  <p>In the dead of night Paterson, his faithful valet, would awaken him and
  hand him one of those red despatch-boxes with which a Foreign Service
  messenger had posted across Europe from Vienna, Constantinople, Berlin, or
  Petersburg, with orders to deliver it with all possible speed. Indeed, in
  such a life of terrible brain-tear, it was not surprising that the years of
  statesmanship had aged him prematurely, that his eyes were sunken, that he
  had developed a restless nervous habit of pacing the room while talking, or
  that insomnia would frequently seize him, and at such times he would go forth
  in the dead of night into the deserted streets of London, and walk miles and
  miles for recreation. For the faithful discharge of his difficult duties he
  had received many times the personal thanks of her Majesty, but, truth to
  tell, it was the applause and cries of "Good Old Macclesfield!" which fell
  spontaneously from the lips of those monster audiences he at rare intervals
  addressed in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and other provincial centres,
  which pleased him most of all. He had been heard to say that those hearty
  ringing cheers which greeted him when he rose to speak, and again when he
  re-seated himself, were in themselves sufficient repayment for the constant
  and terrible strain ever upon him.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the great staircase, just as I was passing out into the
  courtyard wherein the lamps were already lit, as the short day had ended and
  the yellow twilight was fast fading into night, a cheery voice behind me
  exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What, Crawford? Is that you old chap, back from Constant?"</p>

  <p>I turned quickly and saw before me a tall slim figure in overcoat and silk
  hat, whom I recognised as my old whilom colleague Gordon Clunes, of the
  Treaty Department; a dark-haired, spruce, easy-going fellow with whom I had
  lived in chambers in the Albany eight years ago, before being nominated
  attache.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! Gordon!" I cried, grasping his hand, "I thought you always went
  at three, so I meant to look in and see you to-morrrow."</p>

  <p>"Busy, old chap," he laughed, in explanation. "But why are you home?
  What's occurred?"</p>

  <p>"I was recalled by the Chief," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Recalled? Nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I'm appointed to Brussels," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"To Brussels!" he echoed in a strange tone of surprise, I thought. Then
  for a few moments he was silent in contemplation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but why are you surprised?" I inquired, puzzled. It seemed as though
  he begrudged me my advancement.</p>

  <p>"It will be a pleasant change to you," he responded, with that air of
  irresponsibility I had known so well in the old days. "Brussels is a much
  better post than Constantinople, and only a few hours from London. Why,
  Henky, when he was attache there, used to keep on his rooms in London and run
  over about once a fortnight&mdash;sometimes oftener."</p>

  <p>"Poor Henky wasn't very remarkable for his attention to duty," I laughed,
  remembering how when he was attache with me at Vienna he used often to
  receive a mild reprimand from the Ambassador. But the Honourable Alfred
  Henniker was a merry Guardsman, and such a renowned lady-killer that we at
  the Embassy nicknamed him the Fly-paper because all the girls stuck to
  him.</p>

  <p>Brussels was, as my friend Clunes had pointed out, a much more desirable
  diplomatic post than Constantinople, where society is so mixed, and where
  leave is almost unobtainable.</p>

  <p>"When do you go?" my friend inquired.</p>

  <p>I told him that it was uncertain, and that having only arrived from Turkey
  the night before, after an absence of eighteen months, I hoped to get a few
  weeks' leave in England. I was staying with a maiden aunt&mdash;a very prim
  and proper old lady who lived in Warwick Gardens, Kensington, and who had
  long ago given me to understand that in the event of her decease I should
  fall in for a very fair share of this world's goods. Therefore, as diplomacy
  is an expensive profession, and further, as my income was a decidedly limited
  one, I felt in duty bound to pay the old lady a visit whenever I came to
  town, while on her part she seemed to be proud of talking to her friends of
  the advancement and success of her 'nephew in the Diplomatic Service.'</p>

  <p>As we walked together along Downing-street, gloomy and deserted save for
  the solitary detective on guard against anarchist outrages who wished us
  "Good evening, gentlemen," as we passed, we spoke of mutual friends, and I
  referred to his own recent marriage which I had seen announced in the
  papers.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he laughed. "Couldn't stand bachelor life any longer, my dear
  fellow, so having let our old chambers, I took a wife, and am now settled
  down as a respectable citizen. I live at Richmond. Come down and dine
  to-morrow night. My wife will be delighted to meet you. I've told her long
  ago of our menage, and of the five years we spent together. Those were merry
  days, weren't they&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, smiling at some amusing remembrances which at that
  moment crossed my mind. "They were. Thank you for your invitation. I'll be
  pleased to come."</p>

  <p>"Then, here's a card," he said. "You'll easily find the house. It's one of
  those new ones on the way up to the Terrace Gardens. But I must take this cab
  to Waterloo, or I shan't catch my tram. Good-bye till to-morrrow, old
  fellow," and with a cordial hand-grip, he sprang into a hansom, while I, full
  of thoughts of my new appointment, turned and strolled on towards that centre
  whither all diplomats drift, the St. James's Club, in Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>Glad of an opportunity to escape from the terrible formality of dining at
  my aunt's, where old Bateson waited upon one with the air of a funeral mute,
  I dressed next evening and took train to Richmond, where I had no difficulty
  in finding Gordon's place, a large new house about halfway up Richmond Hill.
  It was a decidedly pleasant place, built in artistic early English style, the
  interior being mostly decorated in dead white, with a square hall and oak
  staircase, and rooms with high oak wainscoting and wrought iron electric
  light brackets. In the hall where he welcomed me a fire burnt brightly, and
  in his little den beyond, with its high-backed antique chairs, everything was
  decidedly cosy. Indeed I envied him, and remarked upon the perfectly artistic
  arrangement of his abode.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he laughed. "It's my wife's fancy to have a house like this. She is
  fond of having things different to other people&mdash;a woman's weakness for
  the distinct, I suppose."</p>

  <p>My train had brought me there about a quarter of an hour too early;
  therefore, when I had removed my coat, we sat chatting in my old friend's
  little study, lounging lazily before the fire and enjoying a quiet few
  minutes.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" Gordon exclaimed, after a pause. "It's really a stroke of good
  fortune, old fellow, to be appointed to Brussels. The Chief has indeed been
  generous. I only wish I could get a post abroad, but somehow I'm always
  passed over."</p>

  <p>"Why, surely you don't want to give this up?" I said. "How long have you
  been here?"</p>

  <p>"About a year."</p>

  <p>"And yet you want to go abroad!" said I. "I tell you, Gordon, you wouldn't
  be half so happy, living in a foreign town, with your wife snubbed by some of
  the women with whom you have, for diplomatic purposes, to be nice to. It's
  all very well to be an attache while you're a bachelor, but
  afterwards&mdash;well, the thing's impossible."</p>

  <p>"And you've had a rattling good time of it&mdash;eh?" he asked,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, on the whole, yes," I responded.</p>

  <p>"At any rate you've earned distinction, and I congratulate you," he said
  earnestly. He was a good fellow, one of my best friends and I had always kept
  up a weekly or fortnightly correspondence with him ever since I had been
  appointed abroad. The post he held was one of greatest trust. Indeed, perhaps
  no one in the whole Department of Foreign Affairs, excepting the Minister
  himself, knew so many secrets of State as did Gordon Clunes. He was a free,
  merry, open-hearted fellow, but was discretion itself. With regard to those
  secret drafts which daily passed through his hands, and were seen by no other
  eyes than those of Lord Macclesfield, he was a veritable sphinx. There are a
  good many drones in the Foreign Office hive, but Gordon was by no means an
  idler. I had often regretted that he had not been appointed to one of the
  Embassies, but it seemed as though the Marques reposed such perfect
  confidence in him that his presence at headquarters was much more
  valuable.</p>

  <p>"I know I have your best wishes old chap," I remarked, "and I believe that
  Brussels is a very pleasant Embassy. Lots of life, and within easy distance
  of London."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, Dick Crouch, who was nominated there three years ago,
  once told me that it was gayer than Vienna. Old Drummond is a brick, and you
  can get leave almost at any time. When Crouch couldn't get it he used to
  bring over despatches, and save the messenger a journey."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can do the same," I said.</p>

  <p>"No doubt you will," he replied. "The Chief was talking with the Permanent
  Secretary in my room to day, and mentioned that you had been appointed on
  secret service. You didn't tell me so."</p>

  <p>"I really didn't think it necessary," I said, slightly annoyed. "I
  understood from the Chief that this fact was entirely between ourselves.
  Truth to tell, I don't like the expression secret service."</p>

  <p>"Savours too much of spy, doesn't it, old fellow?" he laughed. "But," he
  added, "that's the very essence of diplomacy. The successful Diplomat is the
  man who keeps his weather-eye constantly upon his opponent's doings, and
  presents elaborate reports to headquarters. Isn't every Ambassador a spy,
  more or less?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I responded, "But I'm not an Ambassador yet."</p>

  <p>"But you're a deal more shrewd than some of the old fossils, who potter
  over trifles and send along screeds to the Chief over every vice-consul's
  worry."</p>

  <p>"Then you think I'll make a good spy?" I asked, laughing.</p>

  <p>"My dear, old fellow," he said, slapping me on the hack as he rose, "there
  are few of those blanked foreigners who'll be able to get the better of you.
  The way in which you got at that secret in Vienna is sufficient proof of
  that."</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" I inquired, starting in surprise that he should be
  aware of a matter which I fully believed was private between Lord
  Macclesfield and myself.</p>

  <p>"By the alteration in the treaty," my friend responded promptly. "The
  alteration was in your handwriting, and not in the Ambassador's. Your tact
  and shrewdness in that affair avoided a very ugly difficulty. Of course," he
  added, confidentially, "I'm not such a fool as to breathe a single word of
  it. Not a soul in the office knows that you are on secret service besides
  myself."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, broken only by the low ticking of the clock.</p>

  <p>"And you will preserve my secret?" I said, looking him straight in the
  face. "Remember that there are secret agents around us even here; and if the
  truth of my real position leaked out I should no doubt find all my efforts
  thwarted. Upon secrecy alone my success depends."</p>

  <p>"I know, Philip," he replied, in deep earnestness. "You have trusted me
  before&mdash;you can trust me now&mdash;can't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I know I can," I answered, reassured, and the strange sense of
  misgiving which had suddenly crept upon me a few moments before was at once
  succeeded by a feeling of reassurance in my old friend's fidelity.</p>

  <p>Just at that moment the door opened and my hostess entered, a dainty
  figure in pale coral, sweet-faced, fair-haired, and wearing a beautiful
  collar of amethysts and pearls around her white slender throat. She was not
  more than twenty-three, graceful, with large expressive eyes of deep blue,
  and a figure almost perfect in its symmetry. Gordon introduced me as his "old
  friend and fellow bachelor, Phil," and as I took the slim white hand she
  extended our eyes met in a quick glance of recognition.</p>

  <p>I held a suspicion that I felt her hand tremble in mine.</p>

  <p>Her face was certainly familiar to me; too familiar it somehow seemed. Yet
  try how I would I could not recollect under what conditions or when or where
  we had met. That she, too, had recognised me was also evident, yet her quick
  and strenuous effort to cover her surprise and confusion was in itself
  suspicious.</p>

  <p>In an instant I divined her intention. She had recovered herself with a
  swiftness that was marvellous; so quickly, indeed that her husband had not
  noticed it, and I saw that if I claimed acquaintance with her she intended to
  deny it.</p>

  <p>We had met somewhere under extraordinary conditions, I knew, yet with
  tantalising perversity my memory in this direction was an utter blank.</p>

  <p>She smiled upon me, yet there was a hardness about the corners of her
  mouth which I did not fail to notice, and standing in the centre of that cosy
  little room with her necklet of amethysts glistening in the electric glow she
  greeted me with an amiable effusiveness which, by some strange intuition, I
  knew disguised an intense and bitter hatred.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; JUDITH</h2>

  <p class="first">DINNER was a pleasant affair in the panelled room through
  the long windows of which I could see the valley of the Thames, with its
  riverside lights twinkling afar. Two elderly men and a couple of pretty girls
  had been invited to meet me, and the gossip was light and amusing. My hostess
  was the life and soul of the party, bright, vivacious, and full of mirth, yet
  I could not disguise the fact that she regarded me with some suspicion.
  During the meal I tried hard to recollect where we had met before, but failed
  utterly. Her conversation was that of a well-educated, clever woman. Her face
  was familiar; her lips, a trifle thick and full, had once before struck me as
  unusual in one of her beauty and grace. But where I had seen her I could not
  remember.</p>

  <p>"Gordon tells me that you've just had the good fortune to be appointed to
  Brussels," exclaimed a pretty, dark-haired girl in blue who sat next to me,
  but whose name I had not caught when introduced to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I laughed. "Do you know Brussels?"</p>

  <p>"I was at school there four years," she answered, toying with her hock
  glass. "But I didn't see very much of it. Our excursions were mainly confined
  to Sunday walks in the Bois."</p>

  <p>"You'll return, perhaps, when you are married," I said, smiling. "It's a
  very pleasant city for a honeymoon."</p>

  <p>"We spent part of our honeymoon there, on our way to the Rhine,"
  interrupted Mrs. Clunes. "It was quite as bright as Paris, without all that
  rush and turmoil. And the Bois de la Cambre&mdash;isn't it charming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, for as part of my training for a diplomatic career I had
  spent a year in the Belgian capital, and practically knew every inch of it,
  from the Quartier where the English reside, away to Laeken, and from St.
  Giles to Schaerbeck.</p>

  <p>"I only wish we could live there, instead of here," she continued, with a
  slight pout. "I do hope that some day Gordon will get nominated abroad. I
  should love a cosmopolitan life."</p>

  <p>"Life at an embassy would be awfully jolly," observed my neighbour in
  blue. "One must meet so many interesting people, from kings and queens
  downwards."</p>

  <p>"Kings and queens are not as a rule interesting people," I said. "The
  monarchs I have met have not impressed me very much. They look much more
  regal in the illustrated papers than they are in real life. The most
  interesting persons as a rule are those foreign secret agents who are always
  seeking to pry into our affairs and learn what we don't desire that they
  should know."</p>

  <p>"I've heard a lot of strange stories about those spying individuals," said
  my hostess, at once interested. "What are they like? Do tell me."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "every one of the Governments of Europe, with the possible
  exception of Switzerland, finds it necessary to maintain a corps of secret
  agents for confidential duty. Their remuneration being defrayed from the
  Secret Service Fund at the disposal of every Prime Minister, the national
  treasury takes no cognisance of their expenses or of their names. These
  latter are only known to the Premier and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
  They are ignored at the regular police headquarters, while the general public
  very often has no knowledge of the existence of such a force. Their duty is
  to learn all that transpires in the various Embassies and report to the
  Chancellerie. They number people in every class of life, and almost every
  nationality."</p>

  <p>"And does not our British Government take steps to combat the efforts of
  these spies?" asked the old gentlemen opposite.</p>

  <p>"In a measure it does," I responded carelessly. "It, of course, behoves us
  to be wary with this horde of secret agents about us, for their ingenuity is
  simply marvellous."</p>

  <p>"Of course there are lots of books which reveal the elaborate system of
  espionage in Russia," observed the girl in blue.</p>

  <p>"Ah! that's quite a different affair," I replied. "The Russian agents are
  mostly employed for the purpose of keeping watch upon the doings of those of
  the Czar's subjects who live beyond the frontiers of Russia; and when it is
  borne in mind that those number close upon a million, and that every Russian
  has in his blood the characteristic Asiatic taste for conspiracy and intrigue
  against his Government, it can be readily understood that the secret agents
  of the Chancellerie of the Emperor have their hands pretty full. It is not
  the agents of the Ministry of the Interior that troubles us, but the system
  of spies established in every country in Europe with a view to learning the
  secrets of British diplomacy. We hold the balance of power you see; and
  because of this every effort is being made to reduce our prestige and
  undermine our supremacy."</p>

  <p>"It certainly behoves you all to be as secret as the grave," my hostess
  said. "I don't think I should like to be in possession of a State secret
  which a hundred unscrupulous persons were seeking to discover. One must feel
  awfully uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>"But you are a woman, my dear," laughed her husband. "They say that your
  sex can't keep a secret," a remark whereat everyone laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! perhaps not," answered the merry, light-hearted little woman. "But it
  seems so horrible if you can't tell who is your friend and who's your enemy,"
  and she fixed her eyes upon me with a strange look of misgiving.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," I said. "This secret service, being beyond the pale of the law,
  is contrary to all notions of what is straightforward and honourable. The
  methods of action these agents employ are often most questionable and
  unsavoury. Indeed, for example at Vienna, where perhaps the secret service is
  permitted to play the greatest role, his Majesty has been compelled by the
  stress of public opinion to consent to the imprisonment and suspension from
  office of the chief of the service for making use of dishonourable
  manoeuvres. Again, in Germany, in response to the memorable speech by the
  Liberal leader Richter in the Reichstag, exposing the unscrupulousness of
  secret agent von Rumpf, his role as a provoker and instigator of crime, and
  his employment, not only of criminal methods, but even of criminals, in order
  to succeed in the intrigues in which he was engaged, the Minister of the
  Interior proclaimed the doctrine that the Executive and his Government have a
  right to use the extra-legal, or to put it plainly, unlawful, methods for
  attaining its aims when the ordinary legal methods are inadequate and
  unavailing. This declaration is in itself sufficient to show to what an
  extent espionage is carried at a foreign Court."</p>

  <p>"If such is the case, then each of our Embassies is surrounded by
  enemies," observed young Mrs. Clunes.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," exclaimed her husband. "Don't you recollect that I told
  you once how cleverly they work the <i>cabinet noir</i> in France, in
  Germany, and in Russia&mdash;so ingeniously, indeed, that our representatives
  at those Courts dare not send a single despatch through the post, otherwise
  it is opened and copied."</p>

  <p>"Then they open official letters?" exclaimed the girl in blue at my
  side.</p>

  <p>"To the <i>cabinet noir</i> nothing is sacred," I said.</p>

  <p>"It is established for the purpose of dealing with both official and
  private correspondence, and the manner in which letters are opened and
  resealed is in itself a marvel of ingenuity. So well is it done that letters
  sealed with wax are opened and again secured, leaving the original seal
  intact, without a trace remaining that it has been tampered with."</p>

  <p>"We've had one or two experiences of that sort of thing of late, Crawford,
  haven't we?" remarked my friend with a meaning look.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "At Constantinople lately one or two matters which we
  believed secret, while we were trying to adjust affairs between Turkey and
  Greece after the war, leaked out in a very mysterious way. Active inquiries
  were made, and it was found that the Russian <i>cabinet noir</i> was at work,
  and, further, that at Petersburg they were fully informed of all our secret
  instructions received from Lord Macclesfield."</p>

  <p>My hostess sighed. As her white chest heaved her necklet of amethysts
  glistened, and her lips became compressed. I noticed this latter involuntary
  movement of the muscles of her face, and saw that she was anxious to change
  the subject. I admit that at that moment I entertained a growing suspicion of
  her.</p>

  <p>That she was eminently graceful and charming there could be no two
  opinions. Gordon, however, had never told me who she was. When I had been a
  month at Constantinople I received a letter suddenly announcing his marriage,
  to which I had responded by sending a cheque to a London silversmith with
  instructions to forward a wedding-present, and by writing him a letter of
  congratulation. Then I had seen the announcement in the <i>Standard</i> a
  week later that he had married, at the village of Rockingham, 'Judith,
  daughter of the late William Carter-Harrison,' and had wondered whether or
  not she were pretty.</p>

  <p>Gordon had not much changed in the years I had been absent. Ten years ago
  we were both second division clerks, and we had certainly enjoyed London life
  and had a very large circle of friends. He was always gay and light-hearted,
  fond of practical joking and eternally declaring that he should never marry.
  Yet he had now taken to himself a wife, and had become just a trifle graver
  than before, as of course befitted a responsible householder whose name was
  on the jury-list.</p>

  <p>At last, when dessert was finished, the ladies left, and presently after a
  brief gossip we rejoined them in the drawing-room. The size and tasteful
  decoration of the place surprised me. The walls were entirely in white, with
  a ceiling of that type for which Adams was noted a century ago; blazing logs
  burned upon old-fashioned fire-dogs, and there was a capacious chimney-corner
  with its settle and old oak arm-chair. It needed not a second glance to
  ascertain that the furniture, every bit of it, was genuine old oak, and as we
  entered I could not refrain from repeating to Gordon my admiration of his
  tasteful home.</p>

  <p>"It is Judith's fancy," he repeated, happily. "I was for a house in
  Kensington; but she loves Richmond because in summer we can get on the river,
  or go for pleasant drives. She's always been used to the country, and
  declares that London suffocates her."</p>

  <p>"Can you wonder at it?" his wife asked me, overhearing our conversation.
  "To me London is dreadful. I go up once or twice a week to do shopping, or to
  a theatre, but really I'm always glad to get back here to the quietness of my
  home. And besides, the view from these windows is the best within a hundred
  miles of London."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I replied, for although I could see nothing in the darkness I
  knew well the picturesque scene from the windows of the Star and Garter,
  where I had so often dined in the days before I went abroad. Below lay a
  broad green valley, with the Thames winding away like a silver ribbon between
  trees and meadows past Twickenham Ferry to Teddington Lock, a magnificent
  picture at any time but doubly so when the silent highway reflected back the
  golden blaze of summer sunset. "But your decorations here are in such
  excellent taste, yet so extremely simple. I envy Gordon his home. Only one
  room have I seen before similar to this."</p>

  <p>"Where?" my friend inquired.</p>

  <p>"In Vienna. It belonged to a lady I knew."</p>

  <p>"Vienna!" exclaimed his wife, with sudden interest. "Were you at the
  Embassy there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "I was there about two years."</p>

  <p>"Then you may perhaps have known of an officer named Krauss&mdash;Oswald
  Krauss?"</p>

  <p>In an instant the truth came upon me as a lightning flash. Perhaps I
  started at mention of that name&mdash;a name which to me carried with it
  recollections of a hideous but hidden page in my history&mdash;at any rate,
  even though I felt myself standing immovable, glaring at her, I managed to
  recover myself sufficiently to answer:</p>

  <p>"The name Krauss is exceeding common in Vienna. I have no recollection of
  any man whose Christian name was Oswald. What was he?"</p>

  <p>"His father was Baron Krauss, of Budapesth," she answered, simply, her
  blue eyes fixed upon me, with a curious look of severity.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered with affected carelessness, "I have no recollection of
  ever meeting him."</p>

  <p>That calm inquiry she had uttered held me breathless. No. I had not been
  mistaken when suspicion had seized me that we were not altogether strangers.
  This woman in coral had, by mention of that name, a hated name graven for
  ever upon my memory because of the burden of evil which had fallen upon me,
  brought back to me in all their hideous reality those circumstances which I
  had so long striven to forget. Our eyes again met, and in the blue depths of
  hers there was a smile of mocking triumph.</p>

  <p>This woman who was Gordon's wife held the secret of my sin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE SHADOW</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning, determined to learn something further
  regarding the mystery of Gordon's wife, and either to confirm or to dispel my
  apprehensiveness, I devised an excuse, and going down to the Foreign Office,
  found him in his room, poring over some long formal document, which he
  instinctively covered with his blotting pad as the messenger ushered me
  in.</p>

  <p>His greeting was cordial as usual, and presently when he had chatted a
  little time, he asked suddenly, "Well, Phil, and how do you like Judith?"</p>

  <p>"She's altogether charming," I answered. "By Jove, old chap, I envy you. A
  menage like yours is a distinct improvement on the Albany, even though our
  Sunday evening concerts with little chorus-girls as performers were pleasant
  gathering&mdash;weren't they?"</p>

  <p>"They were," he laughed. "Good Heavens! what a life we led in those days!
  But after you went, and I was alone, I fancy I must have settled down a
  bit."</p>

  <p>"You have indeed settled down," I said. "For you have a wife to be proud
  of. She came from the Midlands somewhere, if I remember the announcement in
  the papers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. From a little place called Rockingham."</p>

  <p>"She surely wasn't a village belle? She's far too refined for that."</p>

  <p>"Hardly, old follow. She was born in London; but she lived a good deal on
  the Continent and afterwards with an aunt at Rockingham, for several
  years."</p>

  <p>"And how did you come to know her?" I inquired, trying to conceal my
  anxiety and inquisitiveness.</p>

  <p>"I was staying with some people at Ketton, in the vicinity, and we were
  introduced at a local flower-show held in the Castle grounds."</p>

  <p>"And you fell in love with her?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I don't wonder that you did. I'm sure I wish you both
  every happiness. Has she any brothers?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "She was left an orphan at ten, and her aunt, quite a
  cosmopolitan old lady, has ever since looked after her. Her father was a
  wealthy man, and when she came of age, three years before I married her, she
  inherited a very respectable fortune."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, surprised. "Then she had money?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, my dear follow. You don't think that I could build and furnish
  a house like Holmwood on my salary? Heaven knows we who work at home get a
  paltry pittance enough. If the Government doubled our remuneration it
  wouldn't be adequate for the work we do. We are ill-paid, everyone of
  us&mdash;from the chief downwards. People think there are fat emoluments in
  our department, but we could very soon undeceive them."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right," I sighed, for with us in the diplomatic service, as
  with those at home in Downing-street, there is always a perpetual grumbling
  regarding the cheeseparing policy of the Government. Many of the chief
  positions of trust are absurdly ill-paid. "However," I added, "you ought not
  to grumble, now that you are comfortably off. Look at me! The old governor
  left me twenty-five thousand when he died six years ago, and I'm nearly at an
  end of it already."</p>

  <p>"Vienna cost you a lot, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Dearest place in Europe," I answered. "I had to keep horses, and go the
  pace thoroughly. A fellow with only his salary can't live in Vienna. He'd be
  snubbed by everybody, and in three months life would be intolerable."</p>

  <p>"And how about your new appointment?"</p>

  <p>"Gay, but not quite so expensive," I responded. "I must lie low for a
  time, then things will be brighter with me. I can't go on at the pace I've
  been going."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, a trifle coldly. "Take my tip, old man, and live a bit more
  economically. Your extravagance in Vienna was noticed."</p>

  <p>I smiled. Had not Lord Macclesfield himself commended me for my work in
  Vienna? And had I not, in order to perform that mission&mdash;a secret
  one&mdash;been compelled to spend my own money recklessly to gain success?
  His lordship alone knew the reason of my extravagance, and had congratulated
  me upon my vigorous action.</p>

  <p>We gossiped on for perhaps half an hour, then strolled along to the Ship,
  that small restaurant a few doors from Charing Cross, where so many Foreign
  Office men take their lunch. There we ate our mid-day chop together, and
  then, having satisfied myself upon one or two points regarding his wife, we
  parted.</p>

  <p>What he had told me did not allay my fears. The facts that she was an
  orphan, that she had lived with an aunt in an unknown country village, and
  that she had inherited money were all suspicious. No, I could not rid myself
  of a most uncomfortable feeling, a kind of presage of some coming evil. That
  look of triumph and hatred in her blue eyes was ever before me, haunting me
  night and day. She meant mischief.</p>

  <p>Yes, now more than ever was I confident that she possessed the secret
  which I had foolishly thought none knew beside myself.</p>

  <p>Next day I left London on a round of dutiful visits to various friends in
  the north, and as it was a particularly dry spring, I managed to get a good
  deal of enjoyment and plenty of outdoor exercise. To me, tired of the hot,
  dusty, evil-smelling streets of Constantinople, English rural life was an
  exceedingly pleasant change, and for nearly three weeks I made one of a
  particularly gay house party at Dedisham, Sir Henry Halsford's place beside
  the Arun, in Sussex. There were about fifteen guests, besides myself, and as
  many of them were young there was an unvarifying round of gaiety.</p>

  <p>Among the men staying there one was a quiet fellow of middle age named
  Poynter&mdash;a relative of Lady Halsford's, to whom I took a particular
  fancy. We often walked or rode out together, and in the evening we would play
  billiards, or smoke and chat about the Continental capitals I knew. He was a
  man of leisure who had travelled constantly in Europe, as so many men do, for
  the purpose of obtaining a decent climate, spending each winter in Nice,
  spring at Florence, Aix or Biarritz, summer in Switzerland, and autumn in
  Scotland, until he had become, like myself, a thorough cosmopolitan.</p>

  <p>One dry bright afternoon we had together walked over the hill to
  Dewestryde to make a call on some people, and were returning along the
  Slinfold road, past the quaint old windmill, which is a landmark in that part
  of rural Sussex, when, having passed through the quaint little hamlet of
  Rowhook, our conversation chanced to turn upon the political outlook in
  Europe.</p>

  <p>"Things appear black," he said, as he strode on by my side, both of us
  heedless of the rain which had commenced to fall. "In every part of the world
  nations seem to show unfriendliness towards England."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," I said, with a sigh. "A European war would surprise
  nobody."</p>

  <p>"It is you diplomatic people whose duty it is to prevent war," he said
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"A good many very acute difficulties are yearly adjusted by our
  ambassadors and the public remain in ignorance. The papers, for instance,
  have never been able to show the public how active we have been of late at
  Constantinople. A dozen times within the last three months we've been on the
  verge of war with Russia over the eternal Eastern question."</p>

  <p>"On the verge of war!" he exclaimed, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "And had it not been for the tact and clever diplomacy
  of my chief, backed by Lord Macclesfield's firm policy at home, we might by
  this time have had Cossack sentries outside Buckingham Palace."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible? Do you think that such a disaster might ever occur?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"Quite," I responded. "With others of my profession I share certain
  misgivings regarding our naval and military strength. France, Russia, and
  Germany are all three our possible enemies, and with such Powers against her
  England would have to strain every effort to preserve her own. How near we
  often are to hostilities with the Powers jealous of our position as rulers of
  the world, only we at the Embassies know. Our country may thank itself that
  at this moment its Ambassadors are, without exception, calm, level-headed men
  who carry out to the letter the instructions of their Chief. The Opposition
  press, and those irresponsible journalistic curs whose bark is more furious
  than their bite, may rail at us whenever one of the other Powers has
  seemingly got the better of us, but they never pause to consider whether
  discretion is not oft-times the better part of valour; or whether to
  conciliate is not better than to provoke a costly and bloody war."</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Poynter said. "The papers are far too fond of making
  political capital out of our complications abroad. They no doubt form easy
  subjects for what are journalistically known, I believe, as 'second leaders.'
  I remember," he went on, "when I was in Vienna a couple of years ago how
  strained were our political relations with Russia."</p>

  <p>"Two years ago?" I said. "Why, I was there at that time."</p>

  <p>"Then you remember, of course, how the machinations of Russia against
  Austria were suddenly exposed by the publication in the press of reports made
  by a secret agent. It was said that this exposure was brought about by
  someone in the British Embassy, who, at the risk of his life, tracked down
  the spy, and succeeded in getting from him certain plans of the frontier
  fortresses which he had prepared, together with some documents stolen from
  the archives of the Embassy. Was that true?"</p>

  <p>I held my breath, glancing at him furtively. We were skirting Furnace
  Wood, a dark, gloomy place, and the rain was now falling so heavily that I
  was nearly wet through.</p>

  <p>"I do not know the exact truth," I stammered, after a moment's
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "if the exposure was due to anybody in the Embassy he
  ought to have been well rewarded, for it threw a side-light on the byways of
  Russian diplomacy which not only aroused indignation all over Europe, but
  thwarted a plan which would have undoubtedly resulted in war, if it had been
  successful.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "I remember the published facts quite well. We were
  then actually on the verge of hostilities. As we say at the Embassies, the
  Chief always sits on the edge of a volcano. He never knows when the eruption
  is to take place, but must always be on the alert and in readiness to combat
  any conspiracy against British prestige and power."</p>

  <p>"We ought to be thankful, indeed," my companion said, "that we have so
  many excellent and talented men looking after our interests abroad, for it
  would, indeed, be a sorry day for England if war ever broke out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "the jingoes would certainly receive a heavy blow," and
  then in silence we both plodded on along the wet road, the mud splashing with
  each stop until, in the growing gloom, we saw the old ivy-covered house
  through the budding trees.</p>

  <p>How strange it was, I reflected, that this stroke of diplomacy I had
  myself effected unaided was remembered, even in this later rush of exciting
  events. Until that evening at Richmond when I had dined with Gordon and his
  wife, I had confidently hoped that it was all forgotten. Yet this man with
  whom I had come in contact quite by accident remembered every detail of that
  action which I was always aiming to forget.</p>

  <p>He had said that I deserved a rich reward for laying bare a base
  conspiracy against England's honour. What, I wondered, would he say if he
  knew the ghastly truth? My reward had been promotion to Constantinople, and
  now nearer home to a secret and responsible mission in the Belgian capital.
  True, I had strained every nerve in that long-past affair, and had been
  successful where all others had failed. Yet at what terrible cost had that
  vile plot been unmasked.</p>

  <p>I had saved the honour of England at the cost of my own! That woman who
  was my friend's wife alone know the truth.</p>

  <p>But I had little time then for reflection, for we were soon indoors, and
  after changing I was compelled to join the ladies for tea in the
  old-fashioned low-ceilinged drawing-room, where the wood fire burned
  brightly, throwing out a welcome flickering light which danced upon the
  teacups and the service of shining silver, and where the gossip was light and
  the laughter merry. Lady Halsford was a brilliant and tactful hostess, and
  was always able to gather about her a happy party in winter. When I had first
  been appointed abroad I at first missed the shooting and fishing which I had
  so much enjoyed at country houses, but now after a few years I fear I had
  grown to be so much of a foreigner that I preferred a warm drawing-room and
  feminine chatter to tramping over fields after game. The elegant foreigner
  looks askance at the Englishman's zeal for sport, and is quite content to
  cycle on public roads attired in wonderful suits and sweaters, for the
  admiration of his fellows. Beyond that he has no further desire to
  distinguish himself. If he hunts or shoots it is not because he likes it, but
  because he considers it correct form. The educated foreigner always apes the
  Englishman.</p>

  <p>Many pleasant chats I had with Poynter during the week I still remained at
  Dedisham, and as he announced his intention of coming to Brussells for a
  month or so in spring I expressed a hope to meet him there. On leaving Sussex
  I first returned for a few days to Warwick Gardens, then went north to grey
  old Lancaster, and afterwards spent a few days with my brother Frank, whose
  regiment, the 7th Hussars, was stationed at York, my leave, however, being
  cut short by the receipt of a formal letter from the Chief's private
  secretary asking me to call at the Foreign Office on the following day.
  Therefore I left, and the next day at noon once more ascended the grand
  staircase which led to the great statesman's private room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE FACE AND THE MASK</h2>

  <p class="first">A CABINET Council had been summoned to decide some important
  affair of State, therefore my interview with Lord Macclesfield was a brief
  one. As usual he was grave and courteous, sitting in his large padded
  writing-chair, his thin white hands clasped upon the table before him, his
  keen dark eyes fixed upon me.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see you once more before you leave, Crawford, in order to give
  a word of final advice in the matter you are about to undertake. The affair,
  from later despatches appears to be much more serious than I had at first
  believed. It will require the greatest care and judgment. We have enemies in
  Brussels&mdash;secret enemies you understand&mdash;and if report be true they
  are the most daring and unscrupulous set with whom we have yet had to deal.
  Have you thought over the matter well?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "I have recollected every word you spoke to me when you
  entrusted the secret in my keeping."</p>

  <p>"And you now feel yourself quite competent to undertake the task?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely so," I said. "You may rely upon me doing my best."</p>

  <p>"You are not married, I presume?" he asked suddenly, with a quick
  penetrating glance.</p>

  <p>"No," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Are you likely to be?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I responded with a smile, "truth to tell, I have not yet found a
  woman for whom I should care as wife."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. Quite right," he answered testily. "It's a mistake for any
  young diplomatist to marry&mdash;a grave mistake. He should be
  free&mdash;entirely free. You are free, therefore you have every chance of
  succeeding."</p>

  <p>"I shall strive my utmost."</p>

  <p>"Both Russia and France have clever representatives at the Belgian Court,
  therefore you will be compelled to act with considerable tact. But I rely on
  you. Matters have become so serious that it is better for you to leave at
  once for Brussels and take up your position at the Embassy. I have instructed
  Sir John Drummond to allow you to have an absolutely free hand, both as
  regards time and expense, and from time to time you will report direct to me
  by special messenger. Trust nothing to the post, for we have already had
  evidence that the <i>cabinet noir</i> is active."</p>

  <p>I nodded acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"And before you leave," the Premier added, "you had better see Clunes, of
  the Treaty Department. Yesterday, in conversation with me upon another
  matter, he made a statement which is very extraordinary, and appears to have
  some connection with the mystery you are about to fathom."</p>

  <p>"Clunes!" I ejaculated in surprise. "What has he discovered?"</p>

  <p>"You had better hear his statement; for the information may or may not be
  of use to you. At any rate the story is an astounding one, and if true, shows
  the extraordinary ingenuity of our enemies."</p>

  <p>"You have doubts as to its veracity?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>His eyes fell upon the blotting pad before him, and for a few seconds he
  appeared deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"Truth to tell, Crawford," he said at last, in a tone of confidence, "I am
  wondering whether the strange allegation was not made to me with some
  ulterior motive."</p>

  <p>"But you don't suspect that Clunes, a trusted servant in that department
  where secrecy is so imperative, would willingly mislead you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>His lordship shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Recollect," he added quickly, "this matter is entirely between us. I do
  not know whether or not you are a friend of Clunes's, but if you are, then
  recollect that you are before everything the servant of your Queen and
  country, just as I am, and that private friendships or prejudices must never
  be allowed to interfere with duty."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you wish me to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"See Clunes this evening, obtain his statement, and on arrival in Brussels
  report to me your opinion regarding its truth."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I answered, not, however, pleased at the prospect. His
  lordship's suspicion of Gordon unsettled me, for I had always found him a
  true and faithful friend. What, I wondered, had he discovered? and what could
  be the nature of this extraordinary statement, which might throw some light
  upon the matter I was about to investigate? If anything of importance had
  come to his knowledge it was strange, knowing that I had been appointed on a
  secret mission, that friends as we were he had not given me the benefit of
  his knowledge. I scarcely suspected him of endeavouring to curry favour with
  his lordship, except that on account of his wife's eagerness that he should
  obtain a post abroad he might have been induced by her to make a bold bid for
  fortune. I recollected that this woman he had married was my secret and most
  bitter enemy. Perhaps she was endeavouring to use her husband as a tool for
  my downfall.</p>

  <p>My teeth closed tightly as I recollected that look of triumph in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Then, with a final adieu to his lordship, who had already risen and put on
  his hat to attend the meeting of the Cabinet, I went out and downstairs to
  Gordon's room.</p>

  <p>On entering I found him absent, and one of the clerks informed me that a
  telegram had been received that morning saying that he was indisposed, and
  would not attend that day. I was annoyed at this, as it meant that I should
  be compelled to travel down to Richmond and there again meet the hateful
  woman who held my future in her unscrupulous hands.</p>

  <p>As I left my friend's room I ran up against one of my whilom colleagues,
  Jack Carmichael, and with him walked round to the St. James's Club to lunch.
  He was an easy-going bachelor of thirty-five, who never took life very
  seriously, and as we sat over our coffee in the smoking-room he gossiped on,
  telling me all the news of the personnel of the Foreign Office during the
  past couple of years; how young Carew had gone the pace, got into the hands
  of the Jews and been compelled to resign; how Bramford, the younger son of a
  well-known peer, had died of alcoholic poisoning; how old Black, the
  passport-clerk, had retired on a pension, and how kind Lady Macclesfield had
  been to the family of old Saddington, the messenger and hall-porter, who had
  died of bronchitis after forty years of service. These and other things he
  related, all of them interesting to me, for in the days before my nomination
  as attache abroad I had, I believe, been rather popular among my colleagues.
  At least they had made me a very handsome presentation when I had left them
  for more important duties.</p>

  <p>"And Clunes has taken to himself a wife," I remarked, when he had
  finished.</p>

  <p>My companion shrugged his shoulders expressively.</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A wife!" and he smiled again.</p>

  <p>"But surely she is his wife," I exclaimed. I knew Gordon to be the soul of
  honour.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," answered Carmichael, "but she's not the sort of woman I'd
  care to marry, old chap."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired instantly interested.</p>

  <p>"Least said soonest mended, you know," he answered vaguely.</p>

  <p>"But tell me," I urged.</p>

  <p>"No," he responded. "It isn't fair to gossip about a pal's wife. He's your
  friend and mine, remember."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said. "Nevertheless I've met her, and I also have
  suspicions that they are not quite so happy as people imagine."</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes, they're happy enough," he answered. "Gordon's far happier than
  most men who forge the matrimonial fetters. Thank Heaven that although I've
  had my periods of sentimental silliness I've never so far played the giddy
  ass as to marry."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," I observed. "But neither of us is an old man yet. We both might
  fall in love."</p>

  <p>Jack Carmichael pulled a wry face, as though such a prospect was nauseous.
  But he was always joking, and one never knew whether or not to take him quite
  seriously.</p>

  <p>"If I married," he said after a pause, "I'd rather marry a washerwoman
  than an unknown foreigner, as Gordon did."</p>

  <p>"A foreigner! Surely she's not a foreigner, is she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But Heaven alone knows what her nationality really is. She speaks
  English well, and passes as an Englishwoman," he replied. "I stood as
  Gordon's best man at the wedding, and it was at the wedding luncheon that I
  first detected that she wasn't English."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"She was excited, having drunk an unusual quantity of fizz, and once or
  twice she dropped into a foreign accentuation of certain words. Gordon never
  seemed to have noticed it, strangely enough."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps her maiden name was a false one?" I suggested, all these
  facts only serving to verify the suspicion I had from the first moment
  entertained of her.</p>

  <p>"Her name was Judith Carter-Harrison, but Heaven knows whether it was an
  assumed name, or not," he answered. "Since their marriage I've been a
  frequent visitor at Richmond, and once, when I was alone with her, I
  carefully led up to the subject of foreign birth and education. She, however,
  strenuously evaded giving me direct answers to my questions, and seemed
  extremely annoyed that I should entertain any suspicion that she was other
  than she had represented herself to be."</p>

  <p>"Strange," I remarked. "Very strange. She's, of course, extremely
  good-looking."</p>

  <p>"I should rather think so. When Gordon takes her to the theatre she's
  always the centre of attraction. Her face is almost flawless in its
  beauty."</p>

  <p>"And poor old Gordon is so blindly infatuated that he has not yet
  discovered that she has deceived him," I said with a sigh. "Some day, I fear,
  he will suddenly awake to the truth, and then the blow will fall heavily upon
  him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," my friend replied. "He's such an excellent fellow that I can't help
  feeling sorry for him. Truth to tell, I believe the Chief does not give him
  his promotion solely because of this foolish marriage."</p>

  <p>"Does Lord Macclesfield know her?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"I'm not certain," he responded. "But I have a vague suspicion that he
  does."</p>

  <p>I held my breath in alarm. If that were so, then I knew not from one
  moment to another when she might go to him and relate the ghastly story which
  I had ever striven to hide, a secret which, if exposed, would ruin me
  irretrievably. His lordship's remarkable words regarding the fidelity of
  Clunes himself recurred to me, and I became pensive, plunged in gloomy
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>That being my last day in London, I made several calls during the
  afternoon, and it was about five o'clock, and already dark, when I entered
  the train at Waterloo for Richmond.</p>

  <p>What Carmichael had told me caused me considerable uneasiness. That my old
  chum Gordon should marry an adventuress seemed extremely improbable, yet I
  could not forget that her face was quite familiar to me. There was but one
  way to silence her, I reflected. That I feared her I willingly admit; still
  when I thought calmly and weighed each fact carefully, I saw that the look of
  terror I had noticed in her eyes was not altogether without reason. Her
  attitude when I visited her on the last occasion had been one of
  watchfulness. She apparently desired to see whether I recognised her, or
  whether I intended to speak to her husband upon her striking resemblance to
  that woman I had once known. Yet I had made no sign, therefore she had smiled
  in confidence and triumph when she had uttered the one name most hateful to
  me.</p>

  <p>In that journey to Richmond, stifled in a compartment overcrowded by city
  men eagerly returning to their homes at Barnes, Mortlake, and Teddington, and
  that new suburb, Fulwell, I reflected deeply. If ever man was desperate, I
  was at that moment. Before me I had a secret mission which, if successfully
  accomplished, would no doubt result in my further advancement. For a young
  man I had made rapid strides; but this woman stood as a menace between myself
  and success. Well I knew her ingenuity, her craftiness, the calm cunning and
  the relentless revenge of which she was capable. She was, indeed, a
  formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it likewise tardily occurred to me that although she held my
  secret, yet I also held the key to her disreputable past. Could I not, if she
  uttered a single word, expose her in her true light as an adventuress, a
  woman <i>declass&eacute;e</i> and beyond the pale of society, an infamous schemer
  whose real name stank in the nostrils of everyone in two European capitals?
  This I saw was my only safeguard. She was now awaiting her chance to expose
  my true office and to bring not only me, but British diplomacy into derision,
  and render it ignominious; therefore I realised that it was incumbent upon me
  to strike the first blow. I sat in the railway carriage pretending to read
  the evening paper, but really trying to decide how to act. The best and
  wisest course appeared to be to recognise her at once, pretend to hold her in
  abhorrence, and threaten to explain all to her husband. Then she in turn
  would threaten me, whereupon I could proceed to make advantageous terms with
  her. This seemed the only course, therefore after due consideration I decided
  to adopt it.</p>

  <p>A neat maid answered my summons when I rang, and I was at once ushered
  into the white drawing-room which I had so admired on my first visit. Then,
  after a few minutes, she entered, rather flurried, I thought. She was
  confused at my unexpected call, and this gave me courage.</p>

  <p>"I've come down to see Gordon on business," I explained, when we had
  exchanged greetings and she had taken a seat opposite me.</p>

  <p>"He was not at all well this morning, poor boy, so I persuaded him not to
  go to town," she explained.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with him?" I asked, concerned.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered quickly. "A slight headache, that's all. He's very
  subject to headaches, occasioned, I suppose, by overwork. Lord Macclesfield
  ought to give him an assistant. It's really too bad."</p>

  <p>She spoke the truth. The duties in the Treaty Department were always very
  onerous and heavy. He had several times complained to me in his letters that
  further assistance was absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>"Are you very devoted to him?" I said suddenly, my gaze fixed severely
  upon her.</p>

  <p>She started quickly. I saw a look of terror in her blue eyes. Her brows
  contracted.</p>

  <p>"Devoted to him? Of course I am. What do you mean?" she asked with
  affected hauteur.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to feign ignorance," I said, quickly. "Recollect that we
  are not strangers, Judith."</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, in a hoarse voice. "Would to God we were!"</p>

  <p>"Well," I went on ruthlessly, "and why do I find you masquerading here as
  wife of my best friend? Surely you were not so confiding as to believe that
  you, of all women, could remain long undiscovered?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you were in the vicinity," she replied in a tone of hatred, her
  teeth set hard, her eyes flashing an angry fire.</p>

  <p>"No, no," I laughed. "To struggle against the inevitable is useless. You
  were ill-advised to marry Gordon Clunes. It is not often that you make such a
  grave error as this, but it is a step you cannot retrace. That you married
  him with some set purpose is quite apparent. I won't ask you what it is,
  because I know you well enough to be aware that I should never obtain the
  truth from your lips. But," I added in a stern, meaning tone, "if you suppose
  that I will allow my friend to be longer imposed upon by a woman so
  unscrupulous and worthless, then you are mistaken."</p>

  <p>"You dare!" she cried, rising quickly to her feet, pale, with alarm.
  "You&mdash;you intend to expose me!"</p>

  <p>"Do you recollect your words on the last occasion we met?" I asked, also
  rising and regarding her fixedly. She was, I know, a woman who would hesitate
  at nothing in order to gain her ends.</p>

  <p>"I forget nothing," she answered in a low harsh tone.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," I replied. "Once, you played me false."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no Philip!" she cried, her manner in an instant changing from
  defiance to penitence. "I tell you that was not my fault. You have misjudged
  me."</p>

  <p>"But you have nevertheless inveigled Gordon into marriage," I said
  bitterly. "And I am his friend."</p>

  <p>She paused, her eyes fixed for a moment on the burning logs. I saw that
  she held me in fear.</p>

  <p>"But I am his wife," she said.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And for that very reason I intend to tell him the truth."</p>

  <p>"You dare not," she said, her face white and resolute. "Listen! If you
  utter one word to him I will explain all that I know. You are fully aware of
  what I mean."</p>

  <p>I smiled. It was just what I had expected. From her manner I had divined
  her secret intention to expose me, but victory generally lies with him who
  strikes the first blow, and I saw that she was now in deadly fear of me.</p>

  <p>"And if you spoke who would believe you?" I said, in order to taunt her,
  for by doing so I thought I might perhaps gather something further of her
  plans.</p>

  <p>"Once you measured your strength with mine and proved victor," she said in
  a voice of intense hatred. "My life was wrecked because of you. I staked high
  and lost&mdash;ignominiously. You were too clever and outwitted me. I shall
  take care to repay the debt."</p>

  <p>"After Gordon has cast you from his house," I said, preserving a perfect
  calm.</p>

  <p>"If you dare to tell him, the result will be fatal to your own
  interest&mdash;to all your prospects. You go now to Brussels. Good!
  Forewarned is forearmed."</p>

  <p>"If your husband overhears this interesting conversation he'll no doubt be
  edified," I said.</p>

  <p>"He cannot overhear," she answered in a strained voice. Then she added
  quickly, "Do not imagine that I fear any statement that you may care to make
  about me. You have no evidence."</p>

  <p>"Except one little piece, which is, I think you'll admit, quite
  sufficient."</p>

  <p>"And what is that, pray?" she inquired with indignation.</p>

  <p>"Something which you have apparently forgotten," I answered. "Your
  photograph taken when you left your enforced confinement in that place where
  they didn't trouble to air the beds, and where the drawing-room was not
  exactly in Early English style."</p>

  <p>My words held her dumb. She stood before me open-mouthed, her countenance
  blanched to the lips.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her hands clenched, her cold blue eyes darted at me a look of
  evil, a murderous glance that I had only once seen before, and with an
  imprecation she cried with a strained, hollow laugh.</p>

  <p>"Then tell him!&mdash;tell him! But recollect that if you do, I will make
  a statement to the press which will considerably alter the political
  situation in Europe. You have to choose between silence and exposure."</p>

  <p>And without further word she swept past me out of the room.</p>

  <p>I laughed to myself, for this scene had been enacted exactly as I had
  intended it should be, and I saw by her manner that my threat to expose her
  had sealed her lips. She had become Gordon's wife for some mysterious purpose
  or other, and it was evident that she did not mean to relinquish her
  position. This fact gave me confidence; for I saw that as long as she
  remained with him she dared utter no word of the past.</p>

  <p>I remained there alone for a few minutes, then, hearing no sound, I opened
  the door and crossed the hall to the dining-room in search of Gordon. The
  room was, however, empty; therefore recollecting that the door at the end of
  that room led to my friend's cosy little study where we had smoked when I had
  first visited him I walked across and opened it.</p>

  <p>On the couch on the opposite side of the writing table Gordon was lying,
  and on seeing him I cried:</p>

  <p>"Wake up, old chap! Not too seedy to see me, are you?"</p>

  <p>His face was turned to the wall, and he was apparently sleeping
  soundly.</p>

  <p>For a moment I hesitated whether I should rouse him, but suddenly the
  paleness of his neck against the cushion of dark red velvet struck me as
  peculiar, and I bent over and looked into his face.</p>

  <p>His eyes, those merry, laughing eyes I knew so well, were wide open.</p>

  <p>I touched his cheek lightly with my finger tips. It was pale, waxen, and
  as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>In an instant the ghastly truth flashed upon me, and involuntarily I
  uttered a cry of horror and dismay.</p>

  <p>Gordon Clunes, the husband of this scheming, evil woman who held my
  secret, was dead!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE STATEMENT OF ANN PRIMROSE</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a few seconds I stood inactive, horrified, gazing upon
  the white face whence the light of life had faded.</p>

  <p>So suddenly had I made this ghastly discovery that at first I was unable
  to realise that the man who had been so full of activity and good-humour was
  now a corpse. Even while I had been in conversation with this woman, who was
  his wife, he had been lying there dead, and then, as I reflected, the truth,
  a vivid and disconcerting one, was suddenly revealed to me.</p>

  <p>By Gordon's death my power over this woman had vanished. My future was in
  her hands, and too well I knew that she would be merciless.</p>

  <p>Again I placed my fingers upon the chill face, and then chafed the thin
  stiffening hands. But those wide-open glaring eyes, in which the film of
  death had already gathered, told me that life had fled. The honest
  true-hearted man with whom I had shared chambers through my early years of
  wild-oat sowing had been snatched away with a suddenness that was
  appalling.</p>

  <p>Then, the suggestion occurring to me that after all he might be only in a
  state of unconsciousness, and that medical aid might succeed in resuscitating
  him, I rushed through into the dining-room and touched the electric button.
  Opening the door I listened for the approach of someone, but all seemed
  strangely silent.</p>

  <p>The great square hall with its black oak stair-case and balcony above was
  but dimly lit, and there was an ominous stillness everywhere. I rushed across
  to the drawing-room under the impression that the dead man's wife might still
  be there, but that chamber was in darkness. The electric light had been
  switched off.</p>

  <p>Again I rang the bell violently; then, standing in the hall, shouted
  loudly for help. My voice echoed through the house, but no one stirred.</p>

  <p>Why, I wondered, had everyone deserted the place like that? Surely this
  woman who was my enemy must have known all along that my threats were
  unavailing, now that the man who had made her his wife was lying cold and
  dead.</p>

  <p>Having failed to obtain assistance I went back to the little study and
  tried myself to arouse him. But from the first moment of the discovery I knew
  that all efforts were futile. He had lain down there calmly, and passed away
  in peaceful silence, for his face was in no way distorted. Only the fact that
  his hands were clenched showed that the last sting of death had caused him
  pain. The room seemed chill and draughty, and on examination I was surprised
  to find, behind the drawn curtains, that the long window leading out upon the
  small sloping lawn was open&mdash;a fact in itself suspicious.</p>

  <p>Could it be possible that Gordon had been the victim of foul play?</p>

  <p>Such suggestion, however, was quickly put aside by the recollection that a
  telegram had been received at the Foreign Office announcing his
  indisposition. He had no doubt been taken ill suddenly, and died from some
  unknown natural cause.</p>

  <p>I had closed the window when, on glancing round the room, my attention was
  attracted by a smell of tobacco-smoke, and I saw on the table an ash-tray
  wherein were ashes and the end of a freshly-smoked cigar. Had Gordon smoked
  before his death, or had he received some male visitor?</p>

  <p>Yet another curious fact greatly perplexed me. In the fireplace was a
  quantity of tinder&mdash;the remains of some voluminous document which had
  recently been destroyed. One tiny portion of the paper remained charred, but
  not consumed. I picked it out carefully, and on examining it was amazed to
  discover that the paper was of that peculiar tint and texture used in the
  French Foreign Office. Surely Gordon could not have destroyed some
  compromising papers in his possession, and then afterwards deliberately
  committed suicide?</p>

  <p>Whatever the explanation, there was no doubt that some secret papers had
  been burnt there, and further, that these papers were not English. The window
  leading to the garden being open lent colour to the theory that some one had
  passed out of the house by that means. Again, the flight of Judith, and the
  absence of the servants, were all circumstances of the gravest suspicion.</p>

  <p>The room wherein my friend was lying was more of a smoking-room than
  study. True, there was a large writing-table at the end and a couple of
  well-filled bookcases, but the cane rocking-chairs, the long deck-chair with
  its holders in the arms for the big glass of whisky and soda, and the two
  smoking-tables, showed that its owner was more fond of ease than of
  study.</p>

  <p>On glancing around the writing-table I saw something unusual on the
  blotting-pad, and bent to examine it. The paper was white, but discoloured by
  a great stain of bright yellow. This was still damp, and on smelling it I
  found it to be some acid; but what it was I could not determine.</p>

  <p>Just, however, at the moment when I held the pad in my hand I heard a
  movement behind me, and turning quickly with a start perceived a young woman
  fully dressed in neat black. She seemed equally surprised to discover me
  there, but without a moment's hesitation I demanded&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Ann, sir," she answered, drawing back as if in fear of me.</p>

  <p>"Are you one of the servants here?" I said, recognising her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you going out?"</p>

  <p>"I've only just come in, sir," she replied. "There's nobody in the house,
  so I came here to see if either master or mistress were here."</p>

  <p>"Your master is there," I answered, pointing to the couch.</p>

  <p>"What!" she cried in alarm. "Is he unwell?"</p>

  <p>"Were you not aware of his illness?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she answered. "He went out at the usual hour this morning, and
  had not returned when I left at three o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go out?"</p>

  <p>"It was my afternoon out, sir. Mistress gave me an extra two hours."</p>

  <p>In this latter statement I scented suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Why did she give you extra leave?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," the girl responded. "But is master very ill&mdash;can
  I do anything?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "You can do nothing, except to tell me all you know of
  this affair. Where's your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"Gone out, I suppose, sir&mdash;I've been through all the bedrooms, but
  there's no one in the house at all; no dinner ready, or anything. But is
  master sleeping?" she added with increasing anxiety.</p>

  <p>"No," I said, fearing to tell her the truth lest she should go off into
  hysterics or do something equally annoying. In this matter calmness was
  essential, and I was determined to learn from her all I could. "How long have
  you been in Mrs. Clune's service?"</p>

  <p>"Ever since they were married, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you have a good place here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I can't grumble. I don't get many Sundays out, but mistress is very kind
  and thoughtful of us."</p>

  <p>"How many are you?"</p>

  <p>"Three, sir; cook, another housemaid, and myself."</p>

  <p>"And you have no knowledge of where your two fellow servants have
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. They were here when I went out."</p>

  <p>"And your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"She went out immediately after luncheon."</p>

  <p>"Then your master was not at home ill today?" I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He went out about ten, as he usually does, to catch his train to
  London; but I noticed that he was dressed differently than is usual."</p>

  <p>"How?" I asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"He wore a low felt hat instead of his tall silk one, and had on an old
  tweed suit that's quite shabby. When I saw him go out I wondered at him
  dressing so badly. He's always so very smart&mdash;neat as a new pin, as the
  sayin' is."</p>

  <p>This was certainly a remarkable fact. At the Foreign Office a telegram had
  been received announcing his indisposition, while at the same time he had
  gone forth in what was apparently a disguise. It was not like Gordon to go to
  London in an old tweed suit.</p>

  <p>"And after your master had left, what occurred?" I inquired, determined to
  sift this matter to the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she responded. "There was only one caller, a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman!" I cried. "Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Now, my girl," I said earnestly, "in this matter you must be perfectly
  frank. It is most important in your master's interests that I should know all
  that has transpired here to-day. You, of course, recollect that I dined here
  a little time ago. I remember now that you waited at table&mdash;although at
  first in your hat and veil I failed to recognise you."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir; I'm quite ready to tell you, or master, all I know."</p>

  <p>"Well, with regard to this gentleman, was he merely an ordinary-looking
  man, or was there anything about him which struck you as peculiar?"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing extraordinary," she answered with a puzzled look. No
  doubt she thought my words strange ones. Her name was Primrose she had
  informed me. "He merely asked for mistress, and when I inquired his name he
  said it was Christian. I asked him into this room, and mistress, when I told
  her he had called, seemed just a trifle excited. Her face went red, and she
  seemed at first annoyed that he should call so early, for she hadn't quite
  finished dressing her hair."</p>

  <p>"And what then?"</p>

  <p>"She finished hastily with my assistance, and went down to him. He
  remained there fully half-an-hour, and then went away laughing."</p>

  <p>"Did you overhear any of their conversation?"</p>

  <p>"No. I think he was a foreigner, for they spoke French, or some foreign
  language, and they spoke it so quickly and loudly that it seemed once or
  twice as though they were quarrelling. Mistress is an excellent linguist, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know she is," I answered smiling grimly. "But this man was an
  entire stranger, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I'd never seen him before."</p>

  <p>"Young or old?"</p>

  <p>"About thirty-five, or perhaps forty; rather tall and fair."</p>

  <p>"With a moustache pointing upwards?"</p>

  <p>"No, his moustache was short and bristly; and he had a light beard," the
  maid replied. "He was rather thin and wore a light drab overcoat tightly
  buttoned."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak English well?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite well. Indeed, I thought he was English until the bell rang and
  I went to the dining-room, when I heard mistress speaking to him in a foreign
  tongue. She was standing near the fireplace while he was seated in the
  arm-chair over there&mdash;the one master always sits in. He seemed quite at
  home, and mistress ordered me to bring him some brandy and soda."</p>

  <p>"Then you left the room and heard no more?"</p>

  <p>"Not until the bell rang again and I showed him out."</p>

  <p>"And then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"When he'd gone mistress flew into a great rage. She said it was
  abominable that people should call so early."</p>

  <p>"But she treated him very courteously when he was present?"</p>

  <p>"Very. I, however, didn't like him. He seemed to treat mistress just a
  trifle too familiarly. Perhaps, however, it was only his foreign way.
  Foreigners hold different views from us I've heard it said."</p>

  <p>"Well," I exclaimed, "continue your story. What happened after that?"</p>

  <p>"Mistress spent some little time in the study, writing letters, I think.
  Then she lunched alone, and afterwards went out."</p>

  <p>"Was she dressed as though she intended making visits?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I assisted her to dress, and remarked that although the day
  was fine she seemed, like master, to have a leaning towards an old dress. She
  put on an old blue serge and a sailor hat&mdash;a thing which she'd put away
  since last summer&mdash;and she seemed in a hurry either to catch a train or
  to keep some appointment."</p>

  <p>"Has she many friends here in Richmond?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, lots. We're generally crowded on her 'At home' days."</p>

  <p>"And you went out soon after she did?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I went over to Kingston to see my mother, and then on to Surbiton.
  When I returned I went round to the back door, found it open, and came in,
  but to my surprise everybody had gone. The place was deserted. To tell you
  the truth, sir, when I first saw you peering about master's writing-table,
  which we are forbidden to touch, I thought you were a burglar."</p>

  <p>"That's not surprising," I answered with a smile. "But this affair, I may
  as well tell you at once, is a most serious one."</p>

  <p>"Serious? What do you mean, sir?" she asked, starting at my words and
  looking at me in surprise.</p>

  <p>"During your absence something mysterious has occurred. I don't know any
  more of it than you do. I only know the terrible truth."</p>

  <p>"And what's that?" she demanded breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"That your poor master is lying there dead!"</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she gasped, growing pale. "Dead! It can't be true."</p>

  <p>"It is true," I responded. "I found him there not long ago. Look for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>The trembling girl crossed the room on tiptoe, and gazed into the face of
  her master. It needed no second glance to convince her that she was in the
  presence of the dead.</p>

  <p>"It's terrible, sir&mdash;terrible!" she gasped, drawing back pale in
  horror. "Surely he can't really be dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "There's no doubt about it; absolutely no doubt. But
  whether it is the result of natural causes or of foul play it is impossible
  at present to tell."</p>

  <p>"Do you suspect, then, that he's been murdered, sir?" she inquired in a
  low, terrified voice.</p>

  <p>"I suspect nothing," I said. "I entered here and found him exactly as you
  see him now. The window, too, was open. Someone might have escaped by
  it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the window!" she said. "I recollect opening it this morning at
  mistress's orders. She declared that the room smelt stuffy."</p>

  <p>"Was it often open?"</p>

  <p>"It hadn't been opened all the winter until to-day, when I picked out the
  strips of cloth with which the cracks had been plugged up. Master always
  declared that there was an unbearable draught from it; so one day last
  October I helped mistress seal up the door altogether."</p>

  <p>"There was no other reason why it should be opened, except because the
  place was stuffy, was there?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. It was a fine day, of course, and I suppose mistress
  thought well to freshen up the room. I must say that the tobacco smoke is
  very thick here sometimes, when master has two or three friends. But poor
  master! I really can't believe it," she added, looking at him kindly again.
  "He was always so considerate towards us. I can't think what's become of cook
  and Mary."</p>

  <p>"Rather think of your mistress," I said. "What a blow this will be to
  her."</p>

  <p>The girl glanced at me curiously, as if trying to discern how much I
  knew.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she sighed, but refrained from further comment, a fact which went
  to confirm my opinion that this neat domestic knew much more than she had
  already told me.</p>

  <p>"Were your master and mistress always on good terms?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Always," the girl promptly replied. "They were devoted to each
  other."</p>

  <p>I smiled. The idea of that woman whom I had half-an-hour before threatened
  with exposure being devoted to anybody was, to me, amusing. That she knew of
  her husband's death was certain; yet after her ominous words to me she had
  left the house, leaving me alone with the corpse of my friend.</p>

  <p>I recollected now how my appearance had caused her confusion, and how she
  had greeted me with a hollow courtesy. Undoubtedly I had arrived at a very
  inopportune moment, and it seemed equally certain that the two other servants
  were fully aware that their master had passed away.</p>

  <p>Gordon's wife had fled, and that in itself was sufficient to arouse
  suspicion, while on the other hand my friend's own actions in sending the
  telegram of excuse to the Foreign Office, and in going out in unusual attire,
  complicated the puzzle to an extraordinary degree.</p>

  <p>Lord Macclesfield had sent me there to hear some strange statement, yet
  the lips that had uttered those words which had startled and interested the
  great statesman were now silent for ever.</p>

  <p>I stood gazing upon that white face, so calm and tranquil in death, and
  pondered deeply.</p>

  <p>Yes, that some grave, extraordinary mystery surrounded my friend's decease
  I felt convinced.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; IN CYPHER</h2>

  <p class="first">HALF an hour passed.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the girl Primrose I made a tour of the house, but it was
  evident that the dead man's wife had fled, therefore after full deliberation
  I despatched the servant with a note to the police station, asking that an
  inspector might be sent, but not stating any reason. I instructed the girl to
  remain silent for the present, and waited patiently until the officer
  arrived.</p>

  <p>Then I took him into the drawing-room, and when we were alone said:</p>

  <p>"An extraordinary affair has occurred in this house, but there are reasons
  why the matter should for the present remain absolutely secret; reasons which
  will become obvious when I explain the position of the parties
  concerned."</p>

  <p>He was a smart, youngish, rather pleasant faced man, who listened gravely
  while I related the whole of the facts. His brows contracted when I told him
  how Lord Macclesfield had instructed me to travel down to Richmond and hear
  the statement of the man whom I had discovered dead, and he gave vent to an
  exclamation of suspicion when I told him the story related by the girl
  Primrose.</p>

  <p>"I'll see him," the inspector exclaimed when I had finished; therefore I
  led the way across the hall into the small room where poor Gordon was
  stretched out upon the red velvet couch.</p>

  <p>The officer, to whom a mystery of this description and magnitude was not
  of everyday occurrence, glanced quickly around the room, turned the body
  slightly upon its side, and then, noticing no sign of a struggle,
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"I see no evidence of foul play, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered, "none whatever. But this window was unfastened, and
  there in that tray is a freshly smoked cigar."</p>

  <p>"Strange," he said, examining the ashes closely.</p>

  <p>"That points to the fact that he had a visitor," I said.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because he never smoked cigars, but always cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" observed the officer, "That may serve as a very valuable clue." Then
  passing into the dining-room, where the girl Primrose was standing, he
  submitted her to a searching cross-examination regarding her statement to me,
  and especially with reference to the tall fair man who had called upon her
  mistress in the earlier part of the day. From the girl's reply it was quite
  evident that she was concealing nothing, and that she had been much more
  observant than one would have supposed a servant to be. It was also clear
  that she entertained some ill-defined suspicion of her mistress, though of
  what neither of us could exactly make out.</p>

  <p>At length the inspector, whose name was Glass, sent for the divisional
  surgeon, who lived on the hill a little lower down, and also for the plain
  clothes officer attached to that station.</p>

  <p>Without delay the doctor, a stout red faced man, arrived, and after the
  officer had given him a brief explanation he made a cursory examination of
  the body.</p>

  <p>"He must died about an hour ago," he observed, rising from his knees and
  puffing after the exertion.</p>

  <p>"There are no signs of violence?" suggested the officer.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. From all outward appearance death was due to sudden
  failure of the heart's action."</p>

  <p>"Natural causes!"</p>

  <p>"I expect so. Of course I must make a post-mortem later, and then I shall
  be able to speak with greater confidence," the doctor answered. "At present
  there seem no grounds to suspect that death was due to violence. But his wife
  and the servants have left, you say. Strange, is it not."</p>

  <p>"Very curious&mdash;very," answered Glass. "I'm confident there's some
  mystery or other, but what it is there's certainly, as yet, nothing to
  show."</p>

  <p>"Have you noticed this, doctor?" I asked, taking up the blotting pad, and
  handing it to him.</p>

  <p>He touched the yellow stain with his finger, sniffed it, and, after
  holding the pad to the light and examining it carefully, said in the
  uncertain tone of one puzzled:</p>

  <p>"I wonder what was spilt here?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it acid of some sort?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps." Then turning to the inspector he added: "It will be better to
  preserve that. We may want to analyse it."</p>

  <p>I divined by the doctor's manner that he was undecided in his opinion. It
  appeared as though poor Gordon, having been sitting at his writing table,
  became suddenly unwell and while resting upon the couch had expired before he
  could summon aid. Yet if such theory were true, why had that voluminous
  document been burned? And why had Judith, his wife, fled after my arrival?
  Was it because, ignorant of Gordon's death, she feared the exposure which I
  had threatened, or was it because she knew of his decease and had escaped
  before I could discover the truth?</p>

  <p>About this time the detective was ushered in by the girl Primrose, and
  after hearing a brief explanation of the facts he looked at the body and then
  wandered from room to room, discovering nothing. He expressed an opinion
  which to me was certainly an absurd one, namely, that my friend's wife,
  discovering that he had died, had sent out the remaining two servants, and
  then herself gone forth to seek some intimate friend. It was quite feasible,
  he declared, that a woman should do this, for her mutual instinct is to seek
  someone to console her in distress.</p>

  <p>He, however, had no knowledge of the woman's character, and, of course, I
  did not enter into unnecessary detail. The one thought possessing me at that
  moment was a recollection of Lord Macclesfield's doubt consequent upon the
  mysterious statement which my friend had made. So startling and so utterly
  confusing had it been that his lordship deemed it best that I should be aware
  of all the facts ere I set forth on my secret mission to Brussels. The
  terribly sudden death of this man who had made the amazing revelations,
  whatever they were, was certainly an extraordinary development, and it was, I
  saw, imperative that his lordship should learn the truth at the earliest
  possible moment.</p>

  <p>I waited an hour in that silent house where lay the body of my friend, but
  Judith did not return. There was, of course, no direct evidence that he had
  died from any but natural causes, yet her absence increased our
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>Both servants returned in due course, and were dumb with amazement on
  finding the house in possession of the police. We heard their story, which
  was plain and straightforward enough. Their mistress, after my arrival, had
  given them leave to go out, adding that Ann would return shortly, therefore
  they could remain out till nine. They had gone out together, and walked along
  as far as Kew Bridge and back.</p>

  <p>"And you know nothing of your master being in the house when you went
  out?" the detective asked of the cook, a responsible middle-aged woman.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "Master went out as usual this morning, and mistress
  told me that he would not be back to dinner."</p>

  <p>"Neither of you took a telegram to the post office this morning about ten
  o'clock?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," was the response.</p>

  <p>It was therefore evident that Gordon had sent the telegraphic excuse to
  Downing-street himself, on his way out. Likewise, it was more than curious
  that his wife should have kept his return secret from the servants. The
  deeper we probed the mystery the more inexplicable it became.</p>

  <p>"Had you any idea that your mistress intended to go out?" the inspector
  inquired of the cook.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. If she went out Ann could not get in. She told me that she
  would remain at home, as she had been out the greater part of the day and was
  very tired."</p>

  <p>Many were the questions we put to the three domestics, but their knowledge
  threw no further light upon the mystery; therefore, having given my name and
  address to the police, I left and returned at once to London, arriving at
  Waterloo a little after ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>Without delay I took a hansom, and twenty minutes later was admitted to
  the great gloomy hall of the Premier's fine mansion in Grosvenor-square.</p>

  <p>"Is Lord Macclesfield in, Budd?" I inquired of the aged retainer who had
  spent all his life in the service of the family.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. But he's engaged. Is the business pressing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's official," I said. "Send in my card," and I handed him one.</p>

  <p>"Count Cusani, the secretary of the Italian Embassy is with him, and his
  lordship said that I was not to disturb him. I'm very sorry, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wait," I said; and without further word walked on into the
  small cosy room opposite, wherein representatives of every nation in the
  world, have, at one time or another, sat waiting the pleasure of the ruler of
  Europe. I knew the house well, having many times had occasion to call there
  to see his lordship. Indeed, night and day he was always visible on matters
  of pressing importance. His capacity for work was enormous, and his attention
  to duty a model for those junior clerks in the Foreign Office, who preferred
  to read the <i>Times</i> and smoke cigarettes to performing the work for
  which the country paid them. Old Budd, too&mdash;known to every foreign
  diplomatist in London, from the Russian Ambassador down to the Liberian
  Minister&mdash;was a sharp-witted amusing old fellow of courtly manner and
  impressive voice, and while I sat there I chatted with him.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen you lately, sir," the old man said presently.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "Of late I've been at Constantinople."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" he exclaimed. "Sir Richard Davis was there once, and Colonel Poole
  was once military attache. Both gentlemen told me it was a horrid place.
  You're better in London than there, they said."</p>

  <p>"They were right, Budd," I laughed. "But when you get a post abroad you
  have to put up with the uncomfortable as well as enjoy the comfortable. I
  really believe you'd have made a good ambassador."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," laughed the old man, heartily, for he loved a joke. "I
  shouldn't be able to take things so calmly as those gentlemen do. I'm afraid
  I should be for fighting, rather than for diplomacy."</p>

  <p>"Then, Budd, you'd be a dangerous man," I said; while at the same instant
  an electric bell sounded, and begging me to excuse him he went forth into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>The door being ajar I heard the frou-frou of silken skirts as a lady
  passed, and the stately old man opened the door and showed her out. Then I
  heard his lordship's voice telling his man that he would see me in a few
  moments.</p>

  <p>"Who was the lady?" I asked Budd when he returned to me.</p>

  <p>"A stranger, sir."</p>

  <p>"Young?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Rather good-looking," and the old man winked knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Budd," I said, "then though they call you an old fossil you're as
  keen as a knife, and you've got a good eye for a pretty woman."</p>

  <p>"When I was a youngster, sir, I was reckoned a bit of a don. But
  now&mdash;" and the old fellow sighed without finishing his sentence.</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>In the diplomatic world of London, especially among the feminine section
  of it, old Budd's courtesy and the manner in which he tucked up the pretty
  women in their carriages had long been a subject of comment. He was ugly and
  wizened, but he had the manners of a prince, and was as attentive to the
  ladies as their lovers.</p>

  <p>"Did that lady who has just gone out give any card?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I was in a hurry and didn't read the name," he replied. Then he
  added: "I fancy his lordship didn't want to see her, for she was only in his
  room about two minutes, and was then dismissed rather abruptly."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I can always tell by the manner his lordship shuts the door whether he's
  in a good humour or not."</p>

  <p>"And he's in a bad humour to-night, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, rather," he answered confidentially. "Sir Thomas Ridley, the
  Permanent Undersecretary, has been here all the evening, and I fancy the
  outlook is serious."</p>

  <p>Just then the electric bell again rang, and old Budd led the way to the
  large roomy chamber which I knew so well, the private thickly carpeted room
  of the trusted Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of her Majesty the
  Queen.</p>

  <p>The three long windows were heavily curtained, and upon the two large
  writing-tables, littered with State documents and despatches, four green
  shaded lamps shed a zone of light, the remainder of the room being in
  semi-darkness.</p>

  <p>Within the circle of light was a leather armchair, and in response to his
  lordship's invitation, I seated myself in it. It was not the first time I had
  sat there, and I knew how cunningly that chair was placed, so that the
  visitor had the light upon him while the great statesman's face remained in
  the shadow. As I looked across the table, I only saw the pale serious
  countenance, shadowy and indistinct in the gloom. He had a quill in his thin
  hand, and had been signing some papers as I entered. On the farther side of
  the old-fashioned room, wherein so much of the business of the Empire was
  transacted, hung a large portrait of her Majesty, just visible where the
  fitful glow of the fire fell upon it, and on a small table opposite was fixed
  the private telegraph instrument which enabled the Permanent Secretary at the
  Foreign Office to communicate with his Chief at any hour, night or day.</p>

  <p>"Well, Crawford, this visit is a rather late one," he exclaimed in a voice
  which betrayed impatience. He usually worked alone at night, without even a
  secretary; and I knew he hated to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I have to apologise," I answered, "but the matter is one which appears to
  be of pressing importance, in view of the confidence you have already reposed
  in me."</p>

  <p>"And what is it?" he inquired in a dry, calm tone.</p>

  <p>"It is with regard to your instructions to see Gordon Clunes before I
  leave for Brussels."</p>

  <p>"Well, you have seen him," he said, glancing at me quickly with his keen,
  penetrating eyes. "What is your opinion regarding his statement?"</p>

  <p>"I have not been able to get any statement from him," I answered. "I
  regret to say that he is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead," gasped his lordship, starting from his chair. "Is this the truth,
  Crawford?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, unfortunately," I answered. "I found him in his house alone, dead;
  and from certain appearances a mystery appears to surround the cause of his
  decease."</p>

  <p>"Clunes dead!" the great statesman echoed. "Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"He had been dead nearly an hour before I found him," I said.</p>

  <p>His lordship's hand clenched as it lay upon the table before him.</p>

  <p>"And that&mdash;that woman? What of her?" he asked, with a look of firm
  determination upon his blanched face, and laying stress upon the word
  <i>woman</i>. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"She has fled," I answered briefly.</p>

  <p>"Fled!" he cried, standing glaring at me as one dumbfounded. "Do you mean
  that she has disappeared?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then not an instant must be lost," exclaimed the controller of England's
  destinies, touching the electric button upon the table. "The coup of our
  enemies has been effected with an ingenuity and swiftness absolutely
  incredible. England's honour is involved in this affair, how deeply only
  myself and another are aware; but at all costs our dignity and prestige must
  be preserved. This complication is most serious, and creates a crisis the
  most acute of the many which have occurred during the period of my
  Administration. Our enemies must be outwitted and crushed, or this will
  indeed be a sorry day in the history of our Government and our country."</p>

  <p>At that instant his private secretary entered, and addressing him he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Get the Paris telephone switched on. I must speak with the Embassy at
  once."</p>

  <p>Matters were indeed serious, for while the secretary was ringing up, his
  lordship took from a locked drawer a small volume containing the secret
  cypher code for despatches, and after consulting it carefully wrote a long
  string of figures upon a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>Presently, after the lapse of some ten minutes, and while I still sat
  there watching, the secretary announced that they were 'on' to the Embassy in
  Paris, and that the First Secretary was awaiting his lordship.</p>

  <p>At once Lord Macclesfield handed his secretary the slip, whereupon the
  latter went to the transmitter, and in a clear mechanical voice spoke the
  usual formal preface:</p>

  <p>"From the Marquis of Macclesfield to Lord Lydhurst, Paris," and afterwards
  carefully read out figure after figure with clearness and distinctness,
  repeating the message, so that there could be no possibility of error.</p>

  <p>"End," the secretary exclaimed after concluding the unintelligible array
  of numerals, and as he hung up the receiver the tiny bell rang off.</p>

  <p>Thus, in those few brief seconds had a secret despatch been sent beneath
  the sea, and her Majesty's Ambassador in the French capital apprised of the
  latest turn of events.</p>

  <p>Who could say what were his instructions, or what was contained in that
  cypher communication.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; HER MAJESTY'S AMBASSADOR</h2>

  <p class="first">A FEW minutes after the telephonic despatch had been
  transmitted, his lordship, still greatly agitated, with his own hand wrote a
  note to Scotland Yard, and sent it by one of the messengers who were always
  in attendance. Then, when we were alone again, he turned to me, saying:</p>

  <p>"The fact that Clunes is dead must remain an entire secret, remember.
  Nobody must know. I have given instructions to the police to allow no word of
  it to leak out, and if an inquest is necessary it must be held in such a
  manner that the press will not know the official position of the deceased. It
  is useless to mince matters, therefore I tell you that this death of poor
  Clunes is a very grave affair indeed. No effort must be spared to find that
  woman," he added.</p>

  <p>"His wife, you mean."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said with a heavy look upon his face. He was pacing the room
  with fevered steps, and whenever he came within the zone of lamp light I saw
  how deadly pale he was.</p>

  <p>"Have you any suspicion of her?" I inquired, for I was hesitating whether
  I should tell him all I know regarding her. Yet if I did I should undoubtedly
  reveal my own ghastly secret. No, I decided to act with discretion.</p>

  <p>"Suspicion!" he echoed, starting involuntarily. "Why?" he asked, quickly
  recovering himself. "What cause have I for suspicion? I only saw her once, at
  one of the receptions. She seemed a very refined and rather pretty woman, I
  thought."</p>

  <p>I saw he knew more of her secret history than he intended to reveal,
  therefore did not pursue the subject further.</p>

  <p>However, in response to his inquiry I related all that had occurred at
  Richmond, omitting, of course, all mention of the scene between Judith and
  myself.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" he ejaculated, when I had finished. "And the doctor has
  found no trace of foul play?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Very curious," his lordship repeated thoughtfully. "The incident of the
  telegram of excuse is most mysterious. There seems no doubt that he went out
  this morning with a fixed purpose. He must have visited somebody, and with
  his wife's knowledge, too, for she would no doubt remark his shabbiness of
  dress. Again, he must have returned to the house secretly, for the servants
  did not know that he had come back."</p>

  <p>"He might, of course, have let himself in with his latch-key," I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said. "I didn't think of that. Still, the fact remains that
  poor Clunes has died in most mysterious circumstances, which, combined with
  the statement he made to me, certainly point to foul play."</p>

  <p>"Was there a motive for his assassination, then?" I cried, in quick
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, gravely. "There was."</p>

  <p>"Then your theory is that he has been murdered?"</p>

  <p>"I have no theories," the quick-witted old statesman responded. "In this
  matter we can only deal with facts&mdash;and briefly they were these. Gordon
  Clunes, as servant of his Queen and his country, was in possession of certain
  secret information of a grave and most startling character, involving the
  peace of Europe and the discredit of one of the Powers&mdash;which of them I
  shall not say&mdash;so there was every reason why he should be silenced. You
  yourself as a diplomatist and a member of the Secret Service have more than
  once gained information which, had it been known to be in your possession,
  might have cost you your life. Of that you are quite well
  aware&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. What the world-renowned Minister said was quite correct.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," he went on, "our enemies, determined that their secret
  should be preserved, have no doubt silenced him&mdash;by death."</p>

  <p>This argument seemed conclusive enough. I had suspected the dead man's
  wife; but his lordship, while desiring to see Judith, apparently entertained
  a suspicion that the guilt lay in another quarter.</p>

  <p>"But they struck their blow too late&mdash;too late," he went on, as if
  speaking to himself. "They thought to preserve their secret, but their
  unfortunate victim forestalled them, and we are now forearmed. Poor Clunes,"
  sighed the Premier, "he has died having done his duty honourably. He is one
  of the many silent heroes, and will always be remembered by me as a man who,
  knowing the risks he ran and the dangers that surrounded him, acted with
  manful courage and saved England a war."</p>

  <p>"Saved a war?" I echoed. "Was his statement of such value as that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When he told it to me yesterday I thought it too wildly improbable
  to be true, but in the light of to-day's events all is borne out, every word
  of it, and I regret having misjudged him. It seems now apparent that he
  feared attempts would be made to silence him, yet he acted promptly and
  courageously in making that statement to me which has placed in our hands a
  weapon against a certain combination of the Powers.</p>

  <p>"But you wished me to hear his statement," I observed. "Had it any
  connection with the work before me in Brussels?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "but in view of this later startling event I have
  decided that his story shall remain secret. After all, it is unnecessary for
  you to know what is merely a key to certain other matters of which you have
  no knowledge."</p>

  <p>"Then I am to remain in ignorance of his revelations?" I said,
  disappointed, for the mystery has fascinated me.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, unhesitatingly. "I have already given you instructions
  how to act in Brussels. Follow them, and report to me from time to time."</p>

  <p>Then, with his keen grave eyes fixed upon me, he added earnestly
  "Remember, Crawford, that I have every confidence in you, and that your past
  services lead me to the hope that in this your efforts will be crowned with
  success."</p>

  <p>"Then my work in Belgium has a connection with this secret which my poor
  friend Clunes learnt so opportunely."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, simply. "It has. Beyond that I can tell you
  nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing."</p>

  <p>I had anticipated that his lordship would at least repeat to me the story
  he was so anxious that I should hear from my friend's own lips, and this
  decision caused me the keenest dissatisfaction. Gordon was my friend, and I
  felt myself in duty bound to assist in the elucidation of the cause of his
  tragic end. That statement he had made appeared to be the key to the
  situation, and without knowledge of it the solution of the enigma seemed
  impossible.</p>

  <p>I inquired when, under the circumstances, I should leave for Brussels.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he answered promptly. "Go over and take up your duties at
  once. Drummond expects you. I shall see the Director of Criminal
  Investigations in the morning, and will explain that you were compelled to
  leave London. Therefore you will not be called as witness."</p>

  <p>His grey face, looking ghost-like in the shadow where he sat, was
  unusually grave, his eyes were fixed thoughtfully upon the table between us,
  and I noticed that his hand holding the quill trembled nervously.</p>

  <p>"Then I can be of no service in seeking to clear up the mystery of poor
  Clunes' death?" I said in a disappointed voice.</p>

  <p>"No," he responded promptly. "It must be left to the police. Your duties
  lie in another direction. Act with courage and tact, and remember that your
  first duty is towards your country and Queen."</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to forget that," I answered.</p>

  <p>Then, after some further conversation, he rose and dismissed me
  courteously. The electric bell rang in the hall, and old Budd opened the door
  and bowed me out, while the Minister returned to his work among that
  miscellaneous collection of papers and despatches with which his desk was
  piled. He was the most methodical of men, and I well knew that ere he retired
  to rest that night every single paper would have his attention and bear his
  familiar initial.</p>

  <p>Next day, according to my orders, I left Charing Cross and arrived in the
  Belgian capital the same evening. On awaking on the following morning I found
  that here the spring days had come earlier than in London, the chestnuts and
  beeches in the long avenues wore their freshest green, the Boulevards were
  spick and span, and the streets, always models of extreme cleanliness, were
  full of life and movement. Brussels is a gay, airy, careless counterpart of
  its sister Paris; for in it are centered all the gaiety, all the life, all
  the outdoor freedom for which the French capital is so notable, yet without
  that constant turmoil of the streets which yearly renders the Paris
  thoroughfares more and more like those of London.</p>

  <p>No city in the whole of Europe is brighter, gayer, or more pleasant than
  Brussels in May from the windows of my room in the Place Louise, at the
  corner of that magnificent thoroughfare, the Avenue de la Toison d'Or. I
  watched the constant procession of fine equipages, chic cyclists,
  fours-in-hand, automobiles, and electric trams, as they converged into the
  long shady Avenue Louise, on their way to the Bois de la Cambre, one of the
  most picturesque woods on the whole Continent. Light and life were
  everywhere, for sunshine had come, and the gay-hearted Bruxellois always
  welcome the spring time right gladly. Already the weather was warm and
  bright, and the foliage of the spreading trees so thick that in some of the
  avenues near my abode there were spots where the sunlight did not penetrate,
  and it remained gloomy, even at mid-day. In Brussels, the lively little city
  where the women are so neat-ankled and chic, and the men so smart, where the
  carriages are as well-ordered as those in the Row at home, and the blackbirds
  sing in the great trees opposite one's house, they have indeed brought
  enjoyment to a fine art. In May it is undoubtedly a City of Pleasure, with
  its columns, its fountains, its leafy, breezy boulevards, its countless
  cafes, and its gay outdoor life, while Monsieur le brave Belge, the gay
  debonnaire of the capital, has almost forgotten his native Flemish in his
  tireless pains to acquire a Parisian accent, pure and undefiled. The city on
  the Senne has, with truth, been modeled after the city on the Seine, and with
  a happy result.</p>

  <p>Indeed, I was not sorry to return to this cheerful, careless city,
  pleasant indeed after a wearying life beside the Bosphorus, for I knew it
  well, from the venerable Grande Palace where rises the brocaded Hotel de
  Ville with its impossible embroidered spire and ancient Guild Houses
  opposite, and where the old market-women gossip beneath their big white
  umbrellas covering their stalls even to the gilded salon of the pretty
  youthful and skittish Baroness de Melreux, of whose escapades Brussels
  society is always so fond of whispering, and whose elderly and portly husband
  is one of the leading men in the Chamber.</p>

  <p>Day after day I bought the London newspapers at the kiosque of the Grand
  Hotel and scanned them, eager to see some report of the inquest upon the body
  of poor Gordon. Nothing, however, transpired. It was possible, of course,
  that the inquiry had been held, and that some false name had been be stowed
  upon my unfortunate friend in order to avoid the attraction of the press.
  Thousands of inquests are held in London annually which are never reported in
  the papers. The list of coroners' inquiries is bound to be exhibited publicly
  at the coroner's office before they are held, but when secrecy is desired the
  name is very frequently altered. For example, a nobleman who dies
  mysteriously is usually designated by his family name only, his title being
  omitted; and the family name being generally a rather common one the vigilant
  reporter is almost certain, in journalistic parlance, to 'let it slide.'</p>

  <p>In the case of Gordon Clunes, however, Lord Macclesfield had distinctly
  told me that he intended to take steps to keep the truth from the public.
  Therefore I presumed that the inquest had been held, my unfortunate friend
  had been buried, and that Scotland Yard were making secret inquiries.</p>

  <p>What, I wondered, had been the result of the post-mortem? Had death
  actually been due to natural causes, or were there signs of foul play?</p>

  <p>I longed to write to Inspector Glass at Richmond, but in the circumstances
  saw that such communication would be ill-advised. The police were undoubtedly
  under strict orders from the Commissioner, therefore I could learn
  nothing.</p>

  <p>And of Judith, the woman who had fled? What of her?</p>

  <p>So the pleasant spring days passed in Brussels, and I remained in entire
  ignorance of all that had occurred. Truth to tell, my duties were at first of
  a very light character, and after an attendance of an hour or so each day at
  the Embassy I usually spent the afternoons in the Bois, and the evenings at
  one or other of the gay, brightly-lit cafes down in the city&mdash;the Grand,
  the Metropole, or the Coronne&mdash;where I could sit out on the pavement,
  take my after-dinner coffee, smoke, and watch the passers-by. The theatre
  possessed but little attraction for me; I preferred al fresco enjoyment in
  the evening.</p>

  <p>The staff at the British Embassy, that great grey mansion in the Rue de
  Spa, was a particularly pleasant one; Giffard, the military attache, having
  been an old colleague of mine at Madrid, and Frank Hamilton, the first
  secretary, also a friend of long ago. My first interview with my Chief, Sir
  John Drummond, had been entirely cordial.</p>

  <p>I found him one morning in his bright sunny private room, a tall
  well-built man of fifty, with greyish hair, full grey beard, and a face
  gentle and kindly. Before him lay the letter Lord Macclesfield had written
  regarding my duties, and he welcomed me with pleasant affability, expressing
  pleasure at my appointment.</p>

  <p>"Here, of course, we have not such heavy duties as they have at Vienna or
  Constantinople," he said, "but it appears from this letter of the Marquess
  that you are appointed for a special purpose. I presume that before you left
  London the whole facts were laid before you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "His lordship gave me a full explanation."</p>

  <p>"Good," he said. "Of course the utmost discretion and secrecy are
  necessary. Here, although actual duties are not so heavy as in the larger
  capitals, nevertheless the undercurrents at work are legion, and diplomacy
  must be conducted with the utmost finesse. There is war in the air; and from
  Brussels, rather than from anywhere else, might emanate the single spark
  required to fire the mine. In the case of war we must preserve the Belgians
  as our friends. If British soldiers are ever landed on the continent they
  must land at Antwerp. Therefore, in view of all the facts, you see that
  although you are nominally attached to this Embassy as a secretary, you have
  an extremely delicate task to accomplish. You must solve the mystery in
  silence, without awakening the least suspicion of the thousand and one spies
  who surround us. You are to have perfect liberty of action, according to this
  private despatch, and I trust that you will bring your efforts to a
  successful issue."</p>

  <p>"I hope I shall," I answered. "But has anything further transpired of late
  to arouse suspicion or alarm?"</p>

  <p>"Russia, France, and Germany have all three sought to combat my efforts
  during the past week," he answered, gravely, "and I have suspicion that a
  cypher despatch containing the draft of a secret convention has recently
  fallen in some inexplicable manner into the hands of those unknown agents
  with whom you will have to deal. The situation here is, I honestly confess,
  alarming."</p>

  <p>"And you will keep me advised of any facts which may come to your
  knowledge?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Minister replied. He had not mentioned anything of the
  strange affair which had taken place in London, and I had hesitated to broach
  the subject, for was it not a secret between the Chief and myself?</p>

  <p>The remainder of our conversation was devoted to various technicalities
  regarding my secretarial duties, for it had been arranged, in order that our
  enemies should not suspect the true reason of my appointment, I should assume
  the position of third secretary of Legation.</p>

  <p>As I went out I found Giffard, a tall, handsome, dark-eyed Guardsman,
  smoking a cigarette on the steps which led down into the courtyard, beyond
  which lay the stables and the servants' quarters.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed. "Seen the Chief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I responded.</p>

  <p>"Good fellow, isn't he? Everybody here gets on famously. No jealousies or
  any of that confounded humbug, and as much gaiety as you like. You'll like
  Brussels, old chap."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "I think I shall." And then at my invitation we went down
  to the Boulevard Anspach to lunch.</p>

  <p>Giffard was an exceedingly good follow, a thorough type of the merry,
  easy-going British cavalry officer, and a great favourite with the ladies. I
  had known him for years, and of the whole staff of the Legation he alone knew
  the real reason why I had been appointed there.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A MASTER STROKE</h2>

  <p class="first">TO the British public, who are strangely ignorant of the
  work of our Embassies and Legations beyond the seas, that of Brussels is
  usually considered quite an unimportant one; but if the truth were told the
  position of British Minister there is an exceedingly difficult post to fill,
  there being quite as many conflicting interests at work as at Berlin, Paris,
  or Petersburg.</p>

  <p>The Diplomatic Body worked silently, and without seeking to attract any
  public attention. Only now and then, at the request of some inquisitive
  Member of the Opposition in the House, are despatches on certain matters
  published to the world, and then those able to read between the lines can
  discern how delicate have been the negotiations, and with what consummate
  tact and finesse have they been transacted.</p>

  <p>Early one bright sunny morning, after I had been in Brussels some three
  weeks, I had taken my cup of black coffee which alone served me as breakfast,
  a habit contracted in the East, and strolled out along the Avenue Louise to
  the Bois de la Cambre.</p>

  <p>It was not much after eight o'clock, nevertheless there were many people
  riding and cycling along the broad well-kept roads and shady byways. When I
  had formerly lived in Brussels I used to delight in an hour in the Bois about
  eight, for the fresh smell of the woods was invigorating, and the bright
  green always refreshing. I had not yet started a hack, but meant to before
  long. Many smart Belgians were in the saddle, including a fair sprinkling of
  officers of higher grade and a few English residents. Sometimes the King
  himself takes morning exercise there on his magnificent roan, but on this
  occasion he was absent.</p>

  <p>I had passed along the end of the lake on the main road, and was enjoying
  a cigarette on a seat at a spot where the morning sunshine shone through the
  greenery, when suddenly I heard a noise around the bend of the road,
  simultaneous with a woman's scream.</p>

  <p>A moment later I was in view of the scene, and there saw a young girl
  lying in the road with a cycle beside her. An accident had occurred, but of
  what nature I knew not. She was alone and helpless. At once I assisted her to
  rise, and with difficulty she struggled gasping to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I trust you are not hurt, mademoiselle," I exclaimed concernedly, in
  French.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I think not, thank you, m'seur, only shaken&mdash;that is all,"
  and she endeavoured to laugh, but the attempt was a very poor one.</p>

  <p>I noticed, however, that her hand was badly grazed and bleeding. In
  falling she had put out her hand and slid along upon it.</p>

  <p>"But your hand!" I exclaimed, noticing that she was extremely handsome, a
  perfect incarnation of grace and beauty, even though her cycling dress was
  severely simple&mdash;a plain costume of black serge, and a sailor hat with
  black band such as English girls affect.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said in fairly good English, holding it up to me. "I've
  scratched it. Most annoying, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You must allow me to bandage it," I urged. "I once went through some
  medical courses, so I can fix it up temporarily," and so saying I took out my
  handkerchief and folded it.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, you are extremely kind," she said as I staunched the blood and
  afterwards carefully bandaged the slim, white hand she held forth. "I'm so
  much obliged," she exclaimed when, having finished it, I secured it with a
  pin she took from her bodice and handed to me. "I was riding carelessly, and
  I think my dress must have caught."</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to think," I said, glancing at the road, over which a
  water-cart had recently passed, "that your wheel skidded, and thus caused a
  side-slip."</p>

  <p>Then picking up the cycle I saw that one of the cranks was bent and that
  the handles had been knocked awry by the force of the concussion. In that
  condition it was impossible for her to ride the machine; therefore seeing
  that she had been badly shaken, for she was rather pale and her hands were
  trembling, I advised her to rest upon one of the seats; first, however,
  brushing the dust from her skirt.</p>

  <p>"How kind it is of you to groom me!" she laughed. Then, sinking upon a
  seat panting, she examined her bandaged hand with an expression of
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"Every cyclist must be prepared for falls," I said. "Side-slips like that
  cannot be avoided, even by the most expert riders. You might have been hurt
  much more badly&mdash;broken your arm or leg perhaps. Does your hand pain you
  very much?"</p>

  <p>"A little, but it is really nothing. I shall bathe it when I get home, and
  then it will soon be all right, I hope."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," I observed. "In a few days you will be quite ready to ride
  again&mdash;only don't ride carelessly."</p>

  <p>"No," she laughed. "This will certainly be a lesson."</p>

  <p>She was a delightful companion, and I was inwardly thankful for the
  accident which had resulted in our friendship.</p>

  <p>Only one or two stray cyclists passed the spot where we were seated, for
  it was an unfrequented part of the Bois. Her dark hair had be come
  disarranged by her fall, her straw hat, discoloured by the sun as hats will
  become, was dusty, her dress torn at the hem, and with her looked in sorry
  plight. I judged her to be about twenty-two. Her face was of that type of
  beauty handsome rather than really pretty, with well-cut features regular and
  sharply defined, a pair of black eyes in which shone the sparkling light of
  buoyant youth, a small well formed mouth, and a pointed, dimpled chin
  protruding and giving a piquancy to her whole face.</p>

  <p>She was either a lady&mdash;or else a governess. The latter seemed most
  probable, judging from her dress. The excellent accent of her English, had
  evidently been acquired at some school in England, her French likewise being
  Parisian, and not that imitation as spoken by Belgians. Her dress, extremely
  simple, seemed well made, and her tiny russet cycling boots were of fine
  quality, even though well worn and slightly down at heel. All these details I
  noticed as I sat at her side chatting, while she, on her part, appeared to
  accept my assistance with an air of puzzled confusion, which had its
  culmination in her sudden exclamation of "What a horrid fright I must
  look!"</p>

  <p>"No, no," I laughed, "it's only the dust. It will all brush off. After a
  wash you'll be quite yourself again."</p>

  <p>"A wash!" she echoed, laughing. "I feel as if I really ought to have a
  bath. I'm horribly dirty. An accident like this is sufficient to cause one to
  vow never to mount a cycle again."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," I smiled. "In a week I shall meet you careening along
  again. I'm sure I shall."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered frankly, "perhaps you will, for I'm awfully fond of
  cycling. To tell the truth I don't think anything would induce me to give it
  up."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I laughed. "I was quite right, you see. Well, the best course is to
  take a cab from the gate, and allow me to wheel your cycle home."</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't hear of such a thing, m'sieur," she protested with
  graceful dignity. "The cab can carry the cycle. Let us go," and rising in
  obedience I wheeled the injured machine to the entrance, while she walked at
  my side, now quite calm and recovered from the shock of her fall.</p>

  <p>At the gate we placed the machine upon a cab, and entering the vehicle she
  thanked me warmly, gave the cabman an address in the Rue de la Regence, and
  then, bowing gracefully and waving her tiny hand in farewell, drove away,
  leaving me in wonder as to who she was.</p>

  <p>As we proceeded towards the gate I had noticed one well-dressed
  middle-aged man riding a chestnut mare raise his hat to her, which she
  acknowledged with a bow. The greeting thus exchanged caused me to think she
  was an ardent cyclist well known by sight to those in the habit of taking
  morning exercise in the Bois.</p>

  <p>When her cab had passed out into the Avenue towards the city she turned
  back and waved her hand again, then an instant later she became hidden behind
  the trees and I saw her no more.</p>

  <p>During the remainder of that day I was much puzzled as to whether she were
  a governess or a lady. I had that day a report to write upon certain
  inquiries I had made in a quarter where it was suspected that our diplomatic
  secrets had leaked out to the Embassies of our enemies. I had already been in
  Brussels a month, but had discovered absolutely nothing. The fact of being
  appointed on secret service is to the uninitiated synonymous with being
  appointed a spy, but in the world of diplomacy a man loses no dignity by
  seeking to serve his country by secret means.</p>

  <p>As in love and war, so also in diplomacy all means are fair to secure
  one's end. War is always within the bounds of possibility, and it is only by
  careful and diligent diplomacy that the colossal armies and navies of Europe
  are prevented from coming into collision. English men and women at home
  little realise this, and are too fond of relying for their safety upon their
  insular impregnability without taking into consideration the fact that in
  case of successful invasion our islands might be starved out within a week.
  Never in the history of the world has the outlook in Europe been so black as
  it now is; never has the position of the Powers been so absolutely desperate.
  Surely the recent Fashoda incident has shown this even to the most
  sceptical.</p>

  <p>As I sat writing in the secretary's room of the Embassy the hall-porter
  brought me the letters which had just been delivered by the postman, for
  every letter, either private or official, now passed through my hands before
  being opened. I placed down my pen, and when the man had gone took from a
  drawer a microscope, beneath which I placed the ends of each envelope one
  after another.</p>

  <p>To the naked eye there was nothing to show that they and been tampered
  with, but when beneath the lens it was apparent how from each a tiny slip of
  a sixteenth of an inch wide had been cut off the end of the envelope by a
  guillotine for that purpose, thus opening it and after the contents had been
  examined they had been replaced and the open end re-secured by paper-pulp of
  exactly the same shade as the envelope operated upon. Thus the seals and gum
  remained intact.</p>

  <p>Every one of those letters had been through the <i>cabinet noir</i>.</p>

  <p>Just then Hamilton entered, rather hot and hurried. He was a
  fair-moustached, open-faced man of about forty, who had made his mark in the
  diplomatic service, and expected to be appointed shortly to St Petersburg. I
  passed over the letters to him, observing that they had all been opened.</p>

  <p>"Scoundrels," he cried in savage wrath. "Nothing is sacred from them. Not
  content with tampering with the official correspondence, they must even pry
  into one's family affairs. It's simply disgraceful."</p>

  <p>"No doubt our friends in Paris and Petersburg are at the bottom of it
  all," I observed. "As you well know, there's a conspiracy to isolate
  England."</p>

  <p>"By heaven. And they are doing it too," he said. "Have you seen the
  private despatch which came by special messenger from the Marquess this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered, "I haven't seen Sir John to-day. What's it about?"</p>

  <p>"It's tone is extremely serious," he answered "It's briefly this. The
  whole of the secret correspondence between the King and Sir John regarding
  the secret agreement between England and Belgium, which we transmitted to
  London for the Marquess's instructions, is missing."</p>

  <p>"Missing," I echoed, rising from my chair. "Impossible."</p>

  <p>"But it's unfortunately the truth, and we are in a deucedly awkward fix.
  Sir John is at his wits' end. The despatch only arrived at noon, and
  Hammerton, the messenger, is awaiting a reply."</p>

  <p>"How can it be missing?" I asked. "I remember seeing you take up all the
  letters into a packet and seal them the day before yesterday. The messenger
  Graves came from Paris expressly, and took them to London."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "I placed them in the despatch-box myself and Sir
  John locked it with his key after having placed several other private papers
  along with them."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Graves went away to the station in Sir John's brougham, as there was no
  cab in the vicinity, and he travelled straight to London. It appears that he
  arrived at six and drove first to Downing street and then to
  Grosvenor-square, but when the Marquess opened the despatch-box it was
  empty."</p>

  <p>"Empty," I gasped. "Then they've actually got possession of the original
  letters written by King Leopold, as well as Sir John's suggestions. There's
  no denying them. Why," I cried in alarm, "the tone of that correspondence is
  sufficient to cause an immediate declaration of war against us by France and
  Russia. Certainly this coup is the master stroke of our enemies."</p>

  <p>"It is, my dear fellow, and a very serious business for us. Sir John goes
  to London to-night to consult the chief."</p>

  <p>"And the King?" I said. "Does he know?"</p>

  <p>"Sir John has already sent to inform him. I fear to think how angry he
  will be, for it has placed him in a false position with the Powers. The whole
  thing is exposed. England's policy is entirely checkmated, and her prestige
  absolutely ruined in the eyes of Europe."</p>

  <p>"But if we only could recover that packet?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Ah, if we only could," exclaimed Hamilton. "By Jove it would be the
  nation's salvation! But the letters are in Paris by this time, no doubt, and
  a copy of the correspondence on its way to Petersburg. Our enemies never do
  anything by halves."</p>

  <p>"How the papers could be extracted from the despatch-box is an absolute
  marvel," I said. "Does any suspicion rest upon Graves?"</p>

  <p>"None, as far as is known," he responded. "Why, my dear fellow, he's one
  of the most trusted of the whole staff of messengers, and as sharp as the
  proverbial needle. He's been nearly twenty years travelling with despatches
  and has never before lost a single one. According to the letter from the
  Marquess, who has personally investigated the affair, he finds that no
  suspicion whatever attaches to Graves. He believes that the papers must have
  been stolen somewhere on this side of the Channel."</p>

  <p>"Well, I saw you with my own eyes seal them and put them into the box," I
  remarked, amazed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's no doubt whatever that they left us, but how they disappeared
  afterwards is a complete mystery."</p>

  <p>"A mystery which we shall have to solve," I added, thoughtfully. "This
  theft is about the most daring in the annals of diplomacy. It could not have
  been committed at a more inopportune moment."</p>

  <p>As, however, I uttered these words the door of the room was suddenly flung
  open wide by Salmon, the blue-uniformed English porter, who, in a loud clear
  voice, announced&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His Majesty the King!"</p>

  <p>We both rose instinctively, and there entered a tall, thin, sharp-featured
  man with long grey heard. He was attired in close-fitting black frock-coat
  and grey suede gloves, and walked erect, carrying his silk hat and cane in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>We bowed in the Royal presence, and although his pale face was unusually
  wrinkled and care-worn he returned our greeting with a courtly affability,
  motioning us to be reseated.</p>

  <p>"I have an appointment with Sir John," he said in English, briefly "I will
  wait," and then, with a sigh which showed how troubled were his thoughts, he
  sank into the armchair I placed for him.</p>

  <p>True it was that this monarch's life was not, as was popularly supposed,
  an unvarying round of pleasure. As he sat there silent and a trifle
  thoughtful, gazing out into the sunny courtyard where his fine horses were
  champing their bits and pawing, impatient to be gone, he retained a truly
  regal self-possession. Few, indeed, would have guessed the truth. But it was
  a hideous one.</p>

  <p>His crown and kingdom were at stake.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; AT THE STATE BALL</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no disguising the fact that the British Empire,
  the pride of the world, was in deadly peril.</p>

  <p>Day by day went by, yet to our surprise the situation in Europe remained
  undisturbed. I paid a flying visit to London to make further inquiries
  regarding the theft, but soon returned. At the Royal Palace, as at the
  Embassy and at Downing Street, the few who knew of the theft awaited the dawn
  of each succeeding day with trembling anxiety, fearing lest the explosion so
  long threatened should occur. To the last button upon the gaiter Europe was
  armed, not with the arms of twenty-six years ago when France measured
  strength with Germany, but with quick-firing guns, Maxims, rifles of
  astounding length of range, and all kinds of inventions for causing
  widespread desolation and loss of human life. War was terrible enough in the
  days of Sedan and Plevna, but all know that its horrors would now be far
  greater.</p>

  <p>Yet in that period of suspense, although King Leopold and his Ministers
  knew themselves to be on the edge of a volcano, the festivities of the
  Belgian Court never slackened. Only perhaps a dozen people were aware of the
  theft of that file of secret correspondence, and any countermanding of
  previous fetes would have given rise to comment.</p>

  <p>Every inquiry I had made produced only negative results. I had questioned
  Graves, the messenger, closely, and he had asserted that the despatch-box had
  never left his hand after it had been given him by Hamilton. The file of
  papers had disappeared as if by magic. In every effort I was baffled by the
  fact that no suspicion could possibly rest upon Graves, a man who for years
  had carried the nation's secrets in his safe keeping.</p>

  <p>In an anxious, despondent frame of mind, I one night, accompanied by
  Giffard, attended the State Ball at the Palace, a function at which all of us
  were expected to be present. Our party, headed by Sir John and Lady Drummond,
  the former wearing his star of St. Michael and St. George, were received by
  the Royal pair at the head of the grand staircase with its magnificent
  marbles and statuary, and as we passed in, the great ballroom with its
  thousand electric lamps presented a particularly brilliant scene. The various
  uniforms, sparkling orders, and multi-coloured decorations contrasted well
  with the toilettes of the ladies, and the show of diamonds, for which the
  Belgian Court functions have long been notable, was unusually profuse,
  British diplomatic uniforms are, however, the reverse of showy, and a
  Portuguese vice-consul is always a more bejewelled, decorated, and
  imposing-looking person than a British Ambassador.</p>

  <p>Among them all, however, few men looked so smart as did my companion
  Giffard in his Guards uniform, wearing the violet ribbon and cross which the
  Emperor Francis Joseph had conferred upon him, a duplicate of which I also
  wore. Around us were many people we knew, the Russian Minister in his
  imposing white tunic, and glittering with orders, the French and German
  attaches, to whom we were always courteous but never very friendly, and the
  Turkish Minister, a little squat brown-faced man in black embroidered coat
  and dingy fez.</p>

  <p>The magnificent band of the Guides, one of the finest in Europe, were
  playing Strauss's <i>Morgenbl&auml;tter</i> valse, and many dancers were gliding
  around the great chamber in centre of the brilliant crowd. There was gaiety,
  brightness, and laughter everywhere. On every side was a ceaseless chatter in
  French, with now and then an expression in English or German, for those
  assembled were nothing if not thoroughly cosmopolitan, and it may safely be
  said that there are few in the Court circle in Brussels who cannot speak
  English. Together, Giffard and I passed on towards the top of the room,
  bowing here and there to ladies in decollete leaning on the arms of their
  cavaliers, or nodding and exchanging words with men we knew.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a pause in the music as the valse ended, then a slight
  stir among the crowd.</p>

  <p>"The Royal circle have entered," Giffard remarked, and as I turned I saw
  at some distance from me the tall imposing figure of the King, his face
  smiling and bearing no trace of the terrible anxiety which I knew must be
  consuming him within. These men, the ambassadors of the Powers, whose hands
  he had shaken in welcome that night were his most bitter and deadly enemies.
  To-night they laughed gaily with him, and partook of his boundless
  hospitality, yet he well knew that they were conspiring to take from him his
  crown, and wreck the kingdom he loved so well.</p>

  <p>I gave word to my thoughts in a whisper to Giffard, but in response he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Hush, old fellow! Keep silent. It wouldn't do for you to be
  overheard."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," I said, then I fell to thinking as I gazed around upon
  that brilliant assembly, where the women blazed with gems, and the men wore
  their full decorations upon their breasts.</p>

  <p>I had attended many an Imperial function in Vienna, and many a reception
  at the Palace at Madrid; but never had I been present at a ball where was
  displayed such a wealth of jewels, or where the women were on the whole so
  good-looking.</p>

  <p>Some of the ladies were well known to me, for a Secretary of Embassy is
  very quickly in society, and to many of them I chatted after Giffard had left
  me to dance with the pretty daughter of the Minister of Agriculture, a
  fair-haired young lady whom I had detected on more than one occasion flirting
  desperately with him.</p>

  <p>I was seated with the pink and white, fluffy-haired Baroness de Meireux,
  whose historic pearl necklet was being admired, perhaps coveted, by most
  women in the room, gossiping and watching the dancers, when suddenly on the
  opposite side of the polished space where the Lancers were in progress my
  eyes encountered a striking figure in turquoise blue. She was standing in
  conversation with a couple of elderly ladies when, as she suddenly turned her
  face towards me, I was amazed to recognise her.</p>

  <p>She had not noticed me, and was slowly waving her large ostrich feather
  fan to and fro, chatting with the elder of her two companions. Her toilette
  was certainly one of the most beautiful and striking in the room, its tints
  suiting her dark complexion admirably, and its facture of the latest mode
  garnished with silver passementerie and tiny ruches of chiffon. Across her
  white open brow was a magnificent tiara of diamonds, and around her throat a
  beautiful necklet of the same gems sparkled beneath the electric rays with a
  thousand iridescent fires. Her dark well-coiled hair had been arranged by a
  maid of the first order; there were diamonds on her wrists, and everyone
  about me was remarking her beauty.</p>

  <p>For a long time my eyes were riveted upon her, to make certain that I was
  not mistaken, and to reassure myself that it was more than a mere striking
  resemblance. Then, when at last I became satisfied, I sat gazing upon her in
  blank amazement.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who that is, over there, in blue?" I asked of my friend the
  skittish Baroness, for in Brussels society she knew everybody.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered, in English. "She's awfully smart and
  good-looking, isn't she. Don't you know her? Oh, but of course you were not
  in Brussels last season," she added. "She's Melanie, daughter of the Princess
  Charlotte of Hapsbourg. That's her mother, the rather stout woman talking to
  her now."</p>

  <p>"Then she's a Princess of blood royal!" I exclaimed, absolutely
  dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," answered the Baroness. "Her mother is a Hohenzollern, you
  know; and they are here on a visit to the Queen. The Princess Melanie is
  certainly very handsome, but she has all the pride of the Hapsbourgs, and
  makes very few friends. As for the men, she gives them all their
  conge&mdash;all, save one," she added, dropping her voice to a whisper, and
  smiling significantly.</p>

  <p>"And who's he?" I asked quickly; for in her I took more than a passing
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Oh! a mere nobody," she answered. "Last season when they were here there
  were lots of funny stories about. They say she is fond of escaping from the
  royal circle of an evening, and going out for walks with her cavalier; and
  then there have been a good many scenes created in the family because of her
  penchant for this fellow."</p>

  <p>I looked up again at the striking figure in turquoise, whom everyone was
  admiring, and wondered whether she remembered that morning in the Bois, when
  I had brushed the dust from her skirt and bandaged up her hand.</p>

  <p>How different was her appearance now&mdash;the centre and admired of all
  that throng, one of the most dazzlingly brilliant in the whole of Europe. I
  recollected her rather shabby cycling skirt, her straw hat, which had been
  discoloured by the suns of the previous season, and her boots worn until they
  had gone out of shape, and contrasted them with the erect, rather haughty
  figure before me; the costly Paris-made gown, with its smart decollete, and
  the flashing tiara against her dark hair.</p>

  <p>I recollected how so unaffected had she seemed when we had met after her
  accident that I actually set her down as a governess, whereas she was none
  other than a Princess of the great and powerful House of Hapsbourg&mdash;the
  proudest house in Europe.</p>

  <p>Her beauty fascinated me. I sat there gazing at her as one held beneath a
  spell.</p>

  <p>As a rule, I fear I am not very impressionable where women are concerned.
  My profession as diplomatist has brought me in contact with many women of
  dazzling beauty, but at the Embassies it is part of our creed never to fall
  victim to a woman's loveliness; never to become the slave of any of those
  capricious butterflies of fashion who are so fond of angling after the
  foreign diplomat. All this was impressed upon me by the kindly Marquess prior
  to my first appointment abroad. It was part of his wise counsel how to
  conduct diplomacy successfully.</p>

  <p>Of course, just as it is part of a diplomat's creed not to love, it is
  also part of his creed to flirt desperately should occasion require. There
  are times when the young attache can gain valuable information withheld from
  his chief through the brainless woman whom he flatters, and with whom he
  affects to be desperately in love. Indeed, in all the Embassies abroad love
  plays a greater part in international negotiations than is ever dreamed of by
  the public.</p>

  <p>I think that I, like certain of my colleagues, had succeeded in bringing
  flirtation near to the perfection of an art, and when I recollected certain
  escapades in Vienna, where by an affectation of affection I had been
  successful in gaining some exceedingly valuable information regarding the
  political undercurrent, and remembered how near a duel I had been on more
  than one occasion I smiled within myself.</p>

  <p>But at this moment I confess to a very serious affair of the heart. That
  dark-haired, neatly dressed girl who had had such a nasty spill from her
  cycle, had captivated me by her grace, her beauty, and her natural
  outspokenness. I saw now why she would not allow me to wheel her cycle home.
  She did not wish the world to know that she had had a fall in the Bois, being
  aware how fond the papers are of giving publicity to all sorts of alarming
  reports. It was her natural discretion which led her to refuse my further
  aid. Yet had she not turned in the cab, and with laughing, mischievous eyes
  waved her hand to me in farewell.</p>

  <p>The Baroness at my side was chattering away, now and then whimpering
  behind her fan some scandal or other about those who passed by, but I only
  replied mechanically. I was too much occupied with my own reflections to heed
  the chatter of this, one of the giddiest and smartest leaders of fashion.</p>

  <p>I wondered whether I should salute this woman who had so fascinated me, or
  whether I should preserve strict etiquette, and wait until she recognised me.
  This was the question which sorely puzzled me. If she saw me and desired to
  renew the acquaintance, she would surely speak, I argued. If not, then she
  would cut me dead, and I should know that she wished the secret of her
  accident preserved.</p>

  <p>At length, a mutual acquaintance, Count Corrigani, of the Italian
  Legation, came up and commenced to chat with the Baroness, whereupon I seized
  the opportunity and strolled away in the direction of where my friend of the
  Bois was standing, now in conversation with the Queen of the Belgians and her
  unmarried daughter, the Princess Clementine, a pretty dark-haired girl of 19
  who had only lately been admitted to such functions, and who, truth to tell,
  was more at home on her pony in the leafy glades at Spa than among that
  bejewelled throng with its ceaseless chatter and combined odour of a thousand
  intoxicating perfumes.</p>

  <p>For some time I lounged about, exchanging words with those I knew and
  dancing a couple of waltzes with a smart woman to whom I had been introduced
  by Hamilton, and who I understood was to be the wife of the ex-Governor
  General of the Congo. Through all that time, however, I kept surreptitious
  observation upon that tall figure in turquoise with the diamond tiara which
  flashed back every colour of the spectrum. She was surrounded by admirers,
  but refused all invitations to dance. The King and the Archduchess Stephanie
  had led the cotillon, and according to strict etiquette that was sufficient.
  At no Court, save that of Spain perhaps, is etiquette so rigorously preserved
  as at Brussels, and perhaps, alas! no reigning family is more unfortunate in
  its matrimonial alliances than that of Belgium.</p>

  <p>At length, when I saw my divinity with only a single lady at her side, the
  wife of the German Minister, I hastened across and leisurely passed her,
  hoping that she might recognise me and bow. I had resolved not to commit such
  a flagrant breach of etiquette as to claim acquaintance with her. Idly and
  with affected carelessness I therefore strode past, when just as I got level
  with her she raised her dark eyes from those of her companion and looked me
  straight in the face. I expected each second that she would bow; but in her
  gaze was no glance of recognition, only a cold haughty stare of askance, as
  though she had noticed I had watched her, and was annoyed that I should
  approach her in that manner.</p>

  <p>No, she evidently did not intend to recognise me. There was no excuse
  whatever, because she looked full into my face with her great dark eyes, a
  glance firm, cold, unwavering. She had cut me dead. My heart sank with me,
  for she was my idol, and her perfect beauty, enhanced by those dazzling
  jewels, held me captive. Thus I passed on, and it was a long while before I
  summoned courage to again look in her direction, fearing lest she might
  consider me an uncouth boor. When, however, I did, I saw her still chatting
  with the buxom lady who presided over the German Legation, and smiling at
  some words the latter had uttered.</p>

  <p>Then I passed into the lounge set apart for men, swallowed a glass of
  champagne, smoked a cigarette&mdash;the cigarettes King Leopold gives to his
  guests are, as every diplomatist knows, the best in Europe&mdash;and joined
  in the cosmopolitan chatter of a dozen or so of the diplomatic body more or
  less known to me.</p>

  <p>For a long time I lingered in the galleries, and it was nearly an hour
  before I returned to the ballroom, where I found the function at its height.
  An old minuet had been performed, and everybody was discussing it, when, ere
  I became aware of the fact, I came face to face with my dark-haired divinity
  in blue, who seated alone on a settee suddenly recognised me, smiled
  graciously, and bowed.</p>

  <p>My heart leapt for joy. She had by this action given me permission to
  speak.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; HER HIGHNESS'S CONFIDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN an instant I halted, and bowing, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I trust that your Highness's hand has given you no further trouble."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no," she answered in perfect English, smiling, at the same time
  drawing her rich skirts towards her to make room for me on the settee at her
  side. Then she added "Thanks to the professional manner in which you bandaged
  it. The doctor was quite interested when I showed it to him. Won't you be
  seated?"</p>

  <p>I accepted her invitation, and told her of my surprise on recognising her
  an hour before.</p>

  <p>"I was also surprised to meet you here. I had no idea that you were
  attached to the British Legation before I inquired. Therefore, please forgive
  me for not recognising you at first."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to forgive," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes one has to be wary in recognising strangers," she said in
  further explanation. "Immediately I discovered who you were I was annoyed
  that I had treated you so coldly."</p>

  <p>"A princess has many privileges not extended to others," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"And alas! m'sieur, she is also under very many disadvantages of which the
  world knows nothing," she added, in a voice of pouting discontent, raising
  her fine eyes to mine. "There is nothing I love so much as perfect freedom;
  yet unfortunately I obtain so very, very little of it, hedged in as I am by
  Court etiquette, and a constant fear that those gossiping journalists, ever
  ready to exaggerate, may make a lot of tittle-tattle to fill up their
  personal columns."</p>

  <p>"You are fond of cycling?" I asked smiling. Her confession was so
  perfectly frank that I at once discredited the Baroness's estimate of
  her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, awfully. I love it," she declared. "It is because I am so fond of it
  that I rise every morning at five, put on my old dress, and go for a spin in
  the Bois. One of the keepers who is in the secret has charge of my cycle.
  Unnoticed by anybody I take the first tram from the Place Royale at half-past
  five, and with work-people as fellow travellers, arrive at the Bois just
  before six. And then&mdash;well, I am free to ride about just as I like, and
  I can tell you I really enjoy myself. It is such fun. Between six and eight,
  before the merchants and others come to take their morning ride, the sun is
  beautiful, and all is so quiet and and fresh with the birds singing gladly,
  so different to when we go driving there at four among the dust, and the
  carriages, and the gaping crowd. The drive at four is regulated by
  Society&mdash;ugh!" and she shrugged her shoulders, causing the brilliants of
  the beautiful star of some Imperial decoration fixed on the broad crimson
  ribbon across the edge of her bodice to glitter and gleam.</p>

  <p>The splendour of those jewels bewildered me; but far more beautiful was
  that face which had so relaxed in its haughty expression now that we were
  together. She was entirely ingenuous and inexpressibly charming.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, reflectively, "the trammels must sometimes be galling."</p>

  <p>"They are especially so when one's family is bent upon preserving the old
  rigour of past exclusiveness. Why, the heads of my family would expire with
  horror were they to know that I rode a cycle and went alone and unattended
  into a public park. It was because I did not know you, and feared that you
  might gossip about my accident, that I preserved my incognita, and declined
  to allow you to further assist me, or to know where I resided."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must exercise the greatest care," I remarked warningly.
  "Others may recognise you."</p>

  <p>"How can they," she asked. "Why&mdash;I've gone there every morning for
  the past month, and the secret has never leaked out. My mother does not even
  know I possess such an abomination as a cycle," and she laughed that same
  merry, mischievous laugh which I remembered had escaped her when on that
  morning she bade me adieu and drove away.</p>

  <p>"But I noticed that as we were leaving the Bois together more than one man
  bowed to you," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," she laughed. "They are of the liver brigade&mdash;who take horse
  exercise every morning. We have met each morning passing and repassing, and
  now we salute, although we have never spoken. But tell me," she added, "who
  told you my name?"</p>

  <p>"The Baroness de Melreux," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! yes, I know her," she observed, after a second's reflection, and I
  thought her lips compressed ever so little, yet quite sufficient to tell me
  that they were not friends. Indeed, it would have been strange to find a
  princess of the proud House of Hapsbourg friendly with the gay, skittish
  little Baroness of whom all Brussels was so fond of talking.</p>

  <p>"And has m'sieur been in Brussels long?" she asked, as if determined to
  ascertain something more about me.</p>

  <p>"Only a couple of months," I replied. "Previously I was at Constantinople,
  and before that at Vienna."</p>

  <p>"At Vienna?" she echoed. "Strange that we have never met there. I do not
  remember ever having seen you at the Palace."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," I answered. "Yet I went to many of the receptions."</p>

  <p>"And you like Brussels?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "I'm fond of it because it is always so bright, gay, and
  careless, without any bustle and turmoil. Here one can be gay or tranquil
  just as one likes. It is not so in Paris, in Berlin, or in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"And I, too, am extremely fond of Brussels," she answered. "Next to our
  home on the Moselle I like Brussels best of all. Do you know the
  Moselle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I travelled up there once. It is delightful&mdash;very."</p>

  <p>At that instant I recollected how at sunset one evening I had passed on
  the snorting little steamer close to the great frowning cliff whereon was
  perched the magnificent many-turreted, time-worn old pile the Sohloss
  Brandenberg, the historic home of the Hapsbourgs, the windows of which had
  flashed back the crimson rays of the sun. Of all the castles on the Rhine or
  Moselle none was so magnificent in its proportions, so well preserved, or so
  full of romance of those bygone days when the Archbishop of Treves and his
  legions terrorised the district, when castles were invested and sacked, and
  men and women put to the torture or exhibited in iron cages upon the now
  crumbling turrets.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "the Moselle valley, and, indeed, all the district
  surrounding it, is very charming. I love it partly because it is my home, but
  more because there alone can I obtain perfect freedom. I can drive about, go
  boating, or take rambles over the hills without meeting a soul save perhaps a
  stray English tourist from Cochem or Treves, and by them I am not recognised.
  Indeed, my maid always says that a serge dress and a sailor hat make me look
  quite English. Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I responded, laughing. "To tell you the truth I believed you
  were English when we first met the other day."</p>

  <p>"Lots of people have said so," she answered, smiling. "One day at
  Brandenberg I had been out walking alone all the morning, for I was doing
  some amateur photography, and became terribly thirsty. So on coming to a
  little village I entered the inn for some milk and there found two young
  Englishmen, who, speaking German rather indifferently, were endeavouring to
  make the good woman understand their needs. At last I was obliged to assist
  them, and after thanking me they went out. Then when they got outside I heard
  one say to the other. 'No, I tell you she's English governess to some German
  family here.' I was awfully amused."</p>

  <p>I laughed, recollecting that my own opinion had also coincided with that
  of the unknown Englishmen.</p>

  <p>"I've heard much of the wonders of Brandenberg&mdash;its dungeons,
  subterranean passages, and strange galleries hewn out of the solid rock," I
  said. "It must be a marvellous old place."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is beautiful. No happier life does one wish to lead in summer
  than there, free from all the formalities of Court, and the worries of
  constant dressing, receiving visitors, dining, and never having an hour to
  one's self. On the Moselle all is so quiet, so tranquil, so bright and
  healthy, that it comes as a pleasant relaxation to us, worn out by a season
  in London, Berlin, or Vienna.</p>

  <p>"Other people go to the Baths or the sea side, but we can't, for freedom
  of life at a popular resort is impossible. Only in the quiet country can we
  obtain it, and then I for one enjoy it to its full." And her dark brilliant
  eyes, so full of enthusiasm, sparkled gleefully as she spoke.</p>

  <p>Who, I wondered, was this mysterious lover of hers of whom the Baroness
  had spoken? Could it be possible that the real motive of her going each
  morning so early to those leafy glades was in order to meet him?</p>

  <p>"And you don't cycle at Brandenberg?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, no!" she answered, holding up her hand with a look of horror. "I
  dare not let anyone know that I have a cycle. On the morning of my accident I
  took it at once to a repairer's, and it's still there. You know my secret. I
  rely on you not to mention it to anyone."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," I replied, flattered by her highness's confidence. "I
  promise not to utter a single word."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I knew you would be chivalrous," she exclaimed, gaily.</p>

  <p>"I would like very much indeed to exhibit a further chivalry, if I might?"
  I said, emboldened by her freedom of manner.</p>

  <p>She glanced sharply at me with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand," she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Permission to cycle in the Bois on the next morning your highness goes
  there would delight me," I explained.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she answered, slightly inclining her head with an infinite
  grace. "I have no objection whatever. Of course, if any of your friends
  notice you you'll not tell them who I am."</p>

  <p>Her answer filled me with enthusiasm. It showed that she, a princess of
  the blood royal, was not averse to my companionship. Cautious lest she should
  commit an error of etiquette and give offence to her proud family, she was
  nevertheless plain, honest, outspoken, and charming, modest and unassuming
  like any ordinary woman, and fond of throwing off the constant exclusiveness
  with which every member of a royal family must of necessity be enveloped.
  That she could be cold, haughty, and disdainful I had already witnessed; so
  also had I seen that she could be communicative and confidential. Yes, she
  was a princess, and unique.</p>

  <p>The whirl of the dance passed before us, the perfumed skirts of the
  dancers whisking now and then into our faces, yet I heeded them not. I sat
  beside her, spellbound by her beauty. In that brief half-hour while we had
  talked I had cast aside my creed as a diplomatist; I had cast to the winds
  all my foolish vows regarding women.</p>

  <p>I loved her. Yes, I confess openly that I loved her.</p>

  <p>Yet when I reflected, even while she chatted on unconcernedly, I saw how
  absurd it all was, how utterly foolish was my infatuation. Had I been a
  youthful sprig of the aristocracy fresh from the Foreign Office, and
  pitchforked into diplomacy by family influence, it might have been
  understood; but of me, well seasoned by 10 years of Court life, and a member
  of the Secret Service of her Majesty to boot, such a thing was utterly
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I told myself all this. I argued with myself that while she was a princess
  of royal blood, I was merely a diplomatist, not very high up in the service,
  and a little matter of ?10,000 in my bank in London was all I possessed in
  the world. Nevertheless, love over-rode all my misgivings. The magnetic
  influence of those bright dark eyes, the brilliance of which outmatched even
  the glittering tiara on her brow, held me to her. Yes, I was irretrievably
  her slave.</p>

  <p>Again the recollection of those words of the Baroness arose within me.
  They implied that she had a secret lover&mdash;one who, like myself, she
  dared not acknowledge before the world. Was that, I wondered, the actual
  truth? Did this man, whoever he might be, possess her heart? One thing at
  least was certain, that she did not meet him in the mornings in the Bois, or
  she would not have so readily granted me permission to cycle with her.</p>

  <p>She might, however, meet him at night. That was, I thought, more probable.
  She could pass unrecognised along those dimly-lit leafy boulevards down which
  the electric trams flash so quickly, and where, in the centre walk, an ideal
  promenade for lovers, but little light penetrates after nightfall. I glanced
  again at her face, flawless in its beauty. It was impossible for a woman of
  her loveliness to have no accepted admirer.</p>

  <p>And then a strange, half-dreamy thought crossed my mind. Could I some day
  in the future induce her to transfer her affections to me instead? That was
  the height of my ambition. In future I would live only for her, for I
  honestly and truly loved her.</p>

  <p>Suddenly looking into my eyes with that same open frank expression that
  was so charming, she said with a smile:</p>

  <p>"You have not invited me to dance, m'sieur. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;well, I did not think you would care to dance with me," I
  stammered.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she laughed, rising at the same moment. "I shall be delighted. As
  you did not invite me I have invited myself. Will you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied, amused at her frankness of manner, and a few
  moments later we were gliding together down the room. She was a magnificent
  dancer, but I fear I cut a horrible figure, for I felt that every eye of that
  brilliant crowd was fixed upon us, and I thought I detected comments as we
  passed. With my hand upon her waist, slim in its well made corset, I saw
  beneath my eyes her delicate white chest heaving and falling as she breathed.
  Her face flushed slightly with the exertion, but by its expression I saw how
  thorough was her enjoyment. From her chiffons there exhaled a subtle perfume
  of jasmine which filled my nostrils and held me in a kind of delightful
  half-delirium. Indeed, I have little remembrance of the details of that dance
  with the lovely woman who had entranced me. All I recollect is that after two
  turns round the great ballroom she declared that the heat had made her
  thirsty, and suggested that we should go together to the buffet.</p>

  <p>She took my arm, and I was about to lead her to the place wherein I had
  entered an hour before; but she suggested another buffet on the opposite side
  of the ballroom, the existence of which I had been unaware. On our way we
  encountered Giffard, who stood staring at me transfixed in wonder, amazed no
  doubt at witnessing who was my companion. I knew that when we met later he
  would put me through a pretty stiff cross-examination regarding my
  acquaintance with her, and I wondered what I should say.</p>

  <p>The buffet proved to be a kind of Moorish lounge, a great place, rather
  dimly lit, with hanging lamps of beaten brass, carpeted with thick Eastern
  rugs, decorated with heavy crimson and gold, and full of tiny
  inviting-looking alcoves, in one of which we ensconced ourselves, whereupon a
  livered servant at once approached, asking&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What may I get your Royal Highness? Champagne-cup?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no!" she exclaimed. "Get me a little anisette and ice-water."</p>

  <p>I ordered something, I forget what, and then we resumed our pleasant chat.
  There were but few people in our vicinity, and sitting there in the dim
  half-light it suddenly occurred to me that anyone discovering us would at
  once accuse us of flirtation. In the tiny alcove she lolled lazily among the
  soft silken cushions, laughing low as she sipped her anisette. Her tiny foot
  with its satin shoe was stretched forth upon the dark rug, and one
  white-gloved hand she had placed behind her head in an attitude of
  langour.</p>

  <p>Here, she seemed to have thrown off that stiffness and restraint which she
  had been forced to preserve in the ballroom, and once I thought I detected
  just the slightest suspicion of a sigh. Our gossip was mainly about people in
  Brussels whom we both knew, until of a sudden she asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Have you known the Baroness de Melreux long?"</p>

  <p>"About four years, I think."</p>

  <p>"Ah! before her marriage," she said quickly. "And you are her friend?" She
  uttered that query with a hardness of tone which sounded very strange. She
  seemed to lay undue stress upon the word <i>friend</i>.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly," I said. "We are not very intimate friends. I knew her
  in Vienna. She used very often to be there with her mother."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," she said, with a strange note of impatience in her
  voice. "I fear, however, she's not my friend."</p>

  <p>"Well, no one takes her seriously," I observed. "Her character is rather
  too well known."</p>

  <p>"But people are apt to regard idle gossip as containing some substratum of
  truth," she answered, and then there flashed upon my recollection the
  allegation of the Baroness that she had a secret lover. Was she now trying to
  warn me against giving credence to any libellous utterances?</p>

  <p>"To the chatter of such a woman no one gives heed," I assured her.</p>

  <p>But she only shook her head doubtfully, observing&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There are some women whose tongues are full of venom."</p>

  <p>"Yet those who are invulnerable need have no fear," I added.</p>

  <p>She sighed, and a deep shadow of pain crossed her brow. Only, however, for
  an instant. Then in the dim light I saw those brilliant dark eyes fixed upon
  mine with a strange earnestness that puzzled me.</p>

  <p>"We have not yet fixed our meeting for cycling," I said at last, for want
  of something else to say.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, if you will," she answered, quickly interested. "Shall
  we say at six, just at the entrance to the Bois where the trams stop?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I responded. "I shall be extremely delighted." At that instant,
  however, the tall figure of a man in plain evening dress came suddenly into
  view. He walked along slowly, with his hands behind his back and his head
  slightly bent as if in thought. He trod the thick rugs noiselessly, but so
  dim was the light that above the white of his shirt-front I could not clearly
  distinguish his features. That he was beyond the average height was plain,
  and he was rather slim; while from the squareness of his shoulders I guessed
  that he had not yet attained middle age.</p>

  <p>Slowly he approached, a dark silent figure displaying a wide expanse of
  starched shirt-front, and as he drew near to us I was suddenly amazed to
  notice a look of unspeakable fear in my companion's fathomless eyes. Her
  white-gloved hand instinctively sought mine, and trembled as it grasped my
  wrist. Her face was pale as death.</p>

  <p>She shrank back into the deeper shadow of the alcove beside me as if to
  hide herself, breathless, trembling, terrified.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; WILES AND WISDOM</h2>

  <p class="first">I SAT next morning on one of the chairs just inside the
  entrance to the Bois, awaiting the dark-eyed woman who held me beneath her
  invincible charm. In the bright sunshine the birds sang joyously, the air was
  still fresh with that sweet odour of the woods, and as yet none of the
  morning riders had arrived. From where I sat I could see far down the leafy
  avenue leading to the city, and as yet there was no sign of the first
  electric tram which would bear her to me. I had ridden up on my cycle, which
  now stood on the roadside, and as I sat there I reflected deeply upon the
  strange events of the previous night. A few brief hours ago, and I had been
  unaware of my dainty little friend's name and station; while now I was there
  awaiting her, having received her permission to act as her escort. I
  recollected how truly regal was her figure with that magnificent tiara
  flashing in the light, how every woman and man in the room had looked
  admiringly upon her and commented in undertones upon her great beauty as she
  passed, and I remembered, too, how utterly unassuming she had been towards
  me, treating me, a struggling diplomatist, exactly as she would have done her
  equal. She had even confided in me. Indeed, was I not in possession of one of
  her secrets? She had allowed me to become her friend.</p>

  <p>The one fact, however, which had puzzled me, and caused me much
  speculation as I lay in bed during the couple of hours or so I had spent at
  home, was the reason of her strange fear on the approach of that tall man who
  had passed us in the lounge so noiselessly, and disappeared as quickly as
  though he were a shadow. Times without number I strove to form within myself
  some idea of his personal appearance, but without avail. It had been so dark
  in there, where only those Moorish oil-lights in their long globes
  illuminated the place dimly, that his face had been merely a dark blotch in
  the silhouette as he went by. His white shirt-front had been
  conspicuous&mdash;nothing else. Again, while all were in uniform or court
  dress, this man was dressed quite plainly, without a single decoration save
  some cross or other suspended by a ribbon beneath his cravat. It was a dark
  ribbon, I had noticed, but what the order was I could form no idea.</p>

  <p>From her sudden fear it was evident that this stranger's appearance had
  been utterly unexpected. She had been unnerved in an instant, and as he
  passed she had sat with her hand on mine involuntarily, as though seeking my
  protection from some evil which she dreaded.</p>

  <p>Yet he had passed us by. Whether he had recognised her I know not. If he
  did he made no sign, but passed on in the same serious pensive attitude, as
  one who was trying to form some plan or scheme some terrible revenge. Curious
  it was, too, that I had not noticed him in the ballroom, for a man attired so
  plainly must have been conspicuous. Nevertheless, when he had gone, she
  seemed to breathe more freely, and we rose at her instigation and followed
  him to where the dance was still in progress. But he vanished instantly, as
  though he had become in a moment invisible, a fact which in itself seemed to
  increase rather than diminish her apprehensions.</p>

  <p>I saw in the full glare of electricity how pale and agitated was her
  beautiful face. That look of supreme contentment had given place to a hard,
  haggard expression, as though she were haunted by some terrible terror, and
  then after one turn round the room, her eyes ever searching for this man who
  had appeared and disappeared so suddenly, she had bidden me farewell and
  left.</p>

  <p>This ending to our pleasant hour of confidences and light gossip was
  indeed a curiously abrupt one. Her fear seemed to arise more from the fact
  that I was with her as companion than anything else, and as I drove to my
  rooms in the higher part of the town I became immersed in a veritable ocean
  of doubts and fears.</p>

  <p>We were but friends of an hour, therefore I had no right to question her
  about this man. Nevertheless I had spontaneously loved her at first sight in
  the Bois with a strength of passion of which I had never believed myself
  capable, and now as she was anxious and in fear I felt it my duty to stand as
  her champion. At the instant when she had given me her hand and wished me
  'good-night,' I had asked whether our appointment for later that morning had
  not better be postponed till next day, but she only opened those great,
  brilliant eyes of hers wider, and asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is already three," I answered. "You will get no rest."</p>

  <p>"I want none," she answered, with just a touch of sadness. "I shall not
  sleep to-night. Good-bye till six."</p>

  <p>Then smiling, and with a swish of her silken skirts, she had drawn herself
  up and passed on across the great hall of marble and gold, where the servants
  in the royal livery bowed before her.</p>

  <p>Thus I had kept the appointment, and after waiting a quarter of an hour or
  so the first tram came swiftly up the long Avenue, and from it there alighted
  the neat figure in white cotton blouse and black skirt with the plain straw
  hat, the lithe slim figure I knew so well.</p>

  <p>I rose, walking quickly towards her, with hand outstretched gladly. She
  looked so bright and fresh as she greeted me that none would believe that she
  had been up the greater part of the night. All trace, too, of the strange
  mysterious dread had disappeared. Her dark hair dressed so elaborately on the
  previous night was now coiled simply, and both skirt and boots, I noticed,
  were a trifle shabby; indeed, they were such as would have been discarded by
  the majority of 'young ladies' who disport themselves awheel later in the
  morning because it is considered chic so to do.</p>

  <p>Still, even in those well-worn clothes, she possessed a charm and grace
  which held her exalted and distinguished above other women. In her gait
  alone, walking erect, upright, easy, there was a stamp of royal hauteur;
  while in her eyes, those soft dark eyes which seemed to smile so bewitchingly
  and sweetly upon me, there was often a swift resentful glance which told me
  how proud and cold she could be to those who were not her intimates.</p>

  <p>"The keeper, in the lodge over there, has my cycle," she explained in
  breathless eagerness when she had told me how, being late, she had dressed
  hurriedly and left the Palace by the servants' entrance, just in time to
  scramble into the tram. Then we went together to the old man, who, wishing us
  good morning, wheeled out her machine, which had been repaired since her
  accident, and after some slight adjustment of the saddle we both mounted and
  spun away along that well-kept road which all in Brussels know is a perfect
  paradise for the cyclist.</p>

  <p>That she was a practised rider I at once recognised by the manner in which
  she mounted; and very soon her hat becoming loose she raised both hands to
  her head to readjust it, steering only by the balance of her body.</p>

  <p>"Come! come!" I laughed. "Don't ride recklessly again. Recollect the last
  time, and its result."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm going to be very careful in future, I assure you," she answered,
  turning to me with a merry laugh. "I promise you that I won't run any
  unnecessary risks. Besides, my hand is not altogether well yet."</p>

  <p>Her assertion, however, was not borne out by her riding, for she paced
  along at a rate extremely swift for a woman, shooting down the short inclines
  even more quickly than I did. But there were no other cyclists or carriages
  there at that hour, and swift riding in the bright morning hour was very
  exhilarating. That she enjoyed it was shown by her face, gleeful and flushed
  with exertion, while the wind had slightly disarranged her hair and a wisp of
  it strayed across her curved cheek, pure and rounded as a child's. Her
  machine was a light one of the best English make, with every improvement,
  carrying one of those large French horns instead of a bell, an instrument
  which, blown by squeezing an indiarubber ball, emitted a loud, terrible
  trumpeting which could be heard a mile away.</p>

  <p>The manner in which she rode was proof of what keen delight she took in
  cycling. Perhaps it was because she participated in the popular recreation
  surreptitiously that gave this increased zest to her pleasure. At any rate,
  our first spin was a most enjoyable one, a ride beneath those wide spreading
  trees, fresh in their young green, and bright in the morning sunshine, that I
  shall recollect for ever among my most cherished memories of days that have
  gone.</p>

  <p>At length we slowed down near the picturesque lake with its tiny island
  and chalet in the distance, and then, as we rode easily side by side, she
  commenced to chat about the people on cycles and on horseback which were now
  beginning to pass and repass us, for the early morning ride had already
  commenced.</p>

  <p>One rider who went by was a captain of cavalry, in his smart olive green
  and cherry-coloured uniform, and as he passed he saluted her.</p>

  <p>"Does he recognise you?" I inquired quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear no," she laughed. "He's only one of my morning friends. Perhaps
  he thinks I bear a striking resemblance to myself, but none would dream that
  I came cycling here alone at this hour. Therefore I am quite safe."</p>

  <p>"And your Highness has no fear of being recognised?"</p>

  <p>"None," she responded. "The very people who pass me unheeded now salute me
  when at four o'clock I drive here in the carriage with my mother. One's dress
  makes all the difference. Fine feathers make fine birds;" and she laughed
  merrily as she thought how ingeniously she preserved her morning
  incognita.</p>

  <p>In that bright fresh air and brilliant sunshine, spinning along the wide
  avenue, and now and then taking narrow side ways where the trees met
  overhead, our ride was most delightful. Her happy laughter rang out always
  when I expressed fear at whatever seemed to be a reckless action. Indeed, it
  seemed as though she took an intense delight in causing me alarm. Yet was she
  not in my charge&mdash;and did I not love her with all the strength of my
  being? I longed to tell her so; I longed to get her to sit for a moment upon
  one of those inviting seats in the quiet beneath the trees and there pour out
  to her the secret of my heart.</p>

  <p>But I could never do that&mdash;never. I was her friend, not her lover.
  She was the Princess Melanie, of Hapsbourg, who some day might become a
  queen. And what was I?</p>

  <p>No; for the thousandth time I strove to stifle this burning affection
  which, fatal to my happiness, had arisen so suddenly within me. I told myself
  that I had foolishly gone back upon the vow I had made years ago. I was
  casting to the winds all the tenets of my religion as a diplomatist; I was
  acting just as the fledgling attache would act, and had fallen a victim to a
  woman's gaze. It was all airy, romantic, impossible. If I told her of my love
  she would merely laugh in my face. No, she, a princess, could never be
  mine&mdash;never.</p>

  <p>Yet, had I not been told that she had somewhere a secret lover, a man
  unknown, unacknowledged, unpresentable, to whom she clung in secret? No doubt
  she met him clandestinely; and he, some cold, cunning scoundrel perhaps,
  profited in a pecuniary sense from their acquaintance.</p>

  <p>In wonder I again looked at her. If such were really the case it did not
  seem feasible that she should cycle with me. Why did he not ride at her
  side?</p>

  <p>Then still another thought occurred to me. Her lover might be married, and
  might, by cycling with her, compromise himself. Such suggestion seemed so
  like the truth that I felt inclined to believe it.</p>

  <p>Again, could that mysterious figure which had passed us by in silence and
  in shadow have been the man she loved? Was it because he had discovered me
  there with her that she had betrayed that intense fear and anxiety which had
  so puzzled me? I strove yet again to form some theory, but all in vain. She
  had come into my life, and held me spellbound by her beauty and charm of
  manner. There was a fascination in those eyes absolutely irresistible, a
  frankness in her conversation which held me to her as to an intimate
  friend.</p>

  <p>In brief, I had become entranced, and was hers unwittingly, body and
  soul.</p>

  <p>At last, at a shady restful point, where the foliage grew thickly and the
  fresh smell of the woods was refreshing, we dismounted, placed our machines
  against a tree trunk, and sat down.</p>

  <p>There was a summer warmth in the air; the little forest birds hopped from
  bough to bough chirping and pluming themselves, and the low rustle of the
  leaves was as the sighing of the sea.</p>

  <p>I asked whether she was not fatigued, but she answered in the negative,
  laughing lightly.</p>

  <p>"But you really must be tired," she said. "As a rule you men don't rise so
  early. Was it because you wished to appear amiable towards me?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;well, I like cycling," I stammered, rather confounded by the
  directness of her question.</p>

  <p>"But you haven't cycled here before, have you?" she asked. "I remember one
  morning you were riding with your friend Colonel Giffard. Your mount was a
  dark bay."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, surprised that she should have noticed me. I had not
  seen her. "Then you knew me by sight before your accident&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"I had noticed you once or twice," she responded. "I always think that you
  diplomatic people must have an awfully jolly time. You are entirely free; you
  have always a good set of friends, plenty of gaiety, and nothing to do except
  to lie to one another artistically."</p>

  <p>"Well, your description of diplomatic life is certainly flavoured with
  sarcasm," I said, laughing heartily. "You are, however, quite correct when
  you say that we tell untruths artistically. The greater the liar, the more
  successful the diplomatist."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she agreed. "If an ambassador always told the truth he'd have
  to present his letters of recall within a week. From my own observation I've
  come to the conclusion that a diplomatist must possess absolutely no
  conscience, and be unscrupulous alike towards both friends and enemies."</p>

  <p>"No, no," I protested, "we are really not all like that. Compelled as we
  are to protect the interests of the country we represent, we endeavour always
  to do so by fair means. But when we have in active opposition to us enemies
  who will not hesitate at the meanest action in order to attain their own
  ends, we are then compelled to act smartly, even if it savours of dishonesty,
  for the purpose of outwitting them."</p>

  <p>"The crowd of Ambassadors at the Court of Berlin always amuse me," she
  said. "Each one is trying to get the better of his friend, and the Emperor
  treats the whole assembly as so many toys. He once told me that the Court
  would be very dull if it were not for their eternal scrambling over one
  another."</p>

  <p>"He was quite right," I laughed. "Nevertheless I suppose we are among the
  necessary evils in the world. If there was no diplomacy we should have war
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she answered, growing in an instant serious. "I was, of
  course, only chaffing. Sometimes the bickering in diplomatic circles presents
  a very undignified spectacle to a monarch, although in these unsettled days
  when you English have to cope with France and Russia combined together, with
  considerable ill-will in Berlin, it behoves you to have your wits ever ready.
  I often think we are within measurable distance of war."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired quickly.</p>

  <p>She sat pensive, her tiny feet in shabby shoes stretched forth beneath the
  rather short skirt sadly frayed at the hem. She had apparently allowed the
  remark to slip unwisely from her lips, and was hesitating, her face now
  grave, now sensitive, now touched with that mysterious exultation that glows
  through the histories of the saints, that shines from dusty tapestries, that
  hides in the dim faces carved on shrines.</p>

  <p>"I hear ominous predictions," she answered in a low tone, and I thought I
  detected that she shuddered. "If there is war, it will be with England. The
  Powers will unite to crush her."</p>

  <p>I turned my eyes upon hers seriously. Was it not strange that she should
  tell me this; that she should thus refer to the terrible dread which was at
  that moment consuming us at the Legation; that she should utter the prophecy
  which I knew, alas! to be too true.</p>

  <p>She gazed at me steadily, her dark luminous eyes unwavering. Could it be
  that she knew of the inexplicable theft of the document from the despatch
  box, and that she, like myself, was dreading its dire result?</p>

  <p>The theft was, of course, known to King Leopold, but he had vowed solemnly
  to Sir John Drummond to say no word of it, even to his intimates. None knew
  of it outside the Legation, yet throughout her whole conversation there was a
  note of warning.</p>

  <p>Had she, a princess, received secret information that war with England was
  imminent, and as my friend, found a means of warning me?</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that England is so isolated as is generally
  believed?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, with a strange hard look. "All your clever diplomacy
  has been frustrated by the machinations of your ingenious enemies, and at
  this moment England is in gravest peril."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; A DESPATCH FROM DOWNING-STREET</h2>

  <p class="first">AT noon that same day I was standing at the window of Sir
  John's private room at the Legation, looking moodily out upon the wide
  handsome Rue de la Loi, that long straight thoroughfare which runs up to the
  park wherein the recent International Exhibition was held, and where its
  imposing buildings still stand. It was a big brown room, well carpeted and
  lined with books; a room wherein many a consultation had taken place
  regarding England's policy towards the Powers. The Legation is a corner
  building, its front facing upon a courtyard in the Rue de Spa, its rear
  overlooking the main thoroughfare up which the electric trams continually
  pass.</p>

  <p>Graves, the foreign service messenger, had arrived from London, and the
  despatch-box he had brought stood unopened upon Sir John's table. I had given
  the formal receipt for it, and Graves was lunching after his journey. The
  Ambassador alone held the key, and he was down at the Ministry of Foreign
  Affairs. The messenger had announced that the despatches were of importance,
  therefore I had sent word to the Chief by telephone of their arrival.</p>

  <p>As I stood at the window reflecting upon the pleasant morning I had spent
  in the Bois, Sir John suddenly entered in hot haste, wishing me good morning,
  and at once breaking the seals and unlocking the box.</p>

  <p>Inside were two envelopes. One a pale blue one, rather bulky, and the
  other white, with a conspicuous blue cross upon it. Sir John tore the latter
  open, and eagerly read its contents. I knew by its appearance that it was one
  of those private notes written by the hand of the Marquess of Macclesfield
  himself, which direct the policy of the greatest empire in the world.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador read it through, and as he did so sunk heavily into his
  chair, his face set, his grey brows knit, his hand clenched.</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious, I hope," I ventured to remark.</p>

  <p>"Serious!" he echoed. "The outlook grows blacker every moment. Yesterday
  intelligence was received through our Secret Service in Paris that a great
  sensation has been caused in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs by some
  discovery, of what nature it could not be accurately ascertained." Then after
  a pause, the Ambassador added: "We, however, know too well, Crawford. The
  stolen correspondence has, as I feared, reached Paris. If so, we are
  powerless. War must ensue."</p>

  <p>"Accursed thieves!" I ejaculated, recollecting how ingeniously the file of
  papers had been extracted from the locked box. "The mystery is utterly
  without solution. I've tried to form some theory day by day, but have failed.
  In all quarters where I have made secret inquiries my efforts have been
  entirely futile. We have absolutely no clue on which to base a
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>"But at either the French or Russian Embassies they know something of it,"
  the Ambassador said, resting his troubled brow upon his hand in thought. "If
  the correspondence has reached Paris, then it passed through the French
  Embassy. Have you kept your ears open in that quarter?"</p>

  <p>"I have done all that can be done," I answered. "My work, however, is not
  yet finished."</p>

  <p>"Strive on," he urged impatiently. "Strive on, night and day. Remember in
  this affair not only is my personal honour at stake, but the honour of
  Belgium, and, what is greater to all of us, the honour of the Queen's Empire.
  The mystery must be solved."</p>

  <p>I nodded without replying.</p>

  <p>"When you were in London the other day, in consultation with the Chief,
  did he make any further explanation of the reason which first prompted him to
  send me here?" I asked, after a long pause.</p>

  <p>"No, why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," I said, "because he alone knows more than we are aware. There
  is some reason why he preserves silence upon a fact which is of greatest
  importance to us. Indeed, it is more than likely that were he to relate all
  he knows we might conclude this inquiry in a few hours."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" cried Sir John, quickly, in a resentful tone. "You
  surely do not charge the Marquess of Macclesfield with concealing some fact
  to the detriment of his country? This is not like you, Crawford."</p>

  <p>I remembered that the mysterious death of poor Gordon was a secret between
  the Marquess and myself, and saw that if I pursued the topic further I should
  be obliged to make some explanation. Therefore I remained silent.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand your reason for speaking in this manner," continued
  the Ambassador, puzzled. "All that is known at the Foreign Office is known to
  us. Are we not in hourly communication with Downing Street?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that we were, but pointed out that no assistance had been given
  us in the prosecution of the inquiry. The despatch-box from which the file of
  papers had been stolen had been returned, and was in a cupboard opposite to
  where I stood.</p>

  <p>"They rely entirely upon us, Crawford," the Minister replied. "I am not
  satisfied. We are not sufficiently active in the matter."</p>

  <p>This observation angered me. Since the theft had become known I had left
  no stone unturned to fathom the mystery. I had, by constantly seeking the
  society of the French and Russian attaches, personal friends of mine, and
  rather good fellows, learnt a good deal of the undercurrents in progress, yet
  no word had been dropped to cause me to suspect that they were in the secret
  of the theft.</p>

  <p>In a Continental capital there are many mysterious ways by which the
  shrewd diplomatist can ascertain what is in the wind, and as that had been
  part of my duty for the past five years I was pretty well versed in the art
  of learning our opponents' business.</p>

  <p>"I own myself baffled," I answered quietly. "Nevertheless, the course of
  my inquiries must be patient and diligent. I shall not fail through
  inactivity, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"Ah! no, Crawford," he exclaimed quickly. "Do not misunderstand me. I am,
  perhaps, too impatient. Work on, and remember that you are working to clear
  your country's honour."</p>

  <p>And glancing at the other bulky packet he tossed it into a drawer. Its
  envelope showed that the papers were unimportant ones, and the second
  secretary of Legation would deal later with them. Again he re-read those
  uneven lines of writing, scribbled by the hand that controlled England's
  destiny, then striking a vesta he lit the despatch at the corner and held it
  until it was consumed. The secret correspondence from the Marquess to the
  various Ambassadors of the Queen is always destroyed immediately, as some of
  it might prove extremely compromising.</p>

  <p>I lunched at home at my rooms, and at 4 that afternoon strolled to the
  Cafe Metropole, the fine, handsomely decorated place on the Boulevard
  Anspach, for there I was almost certain to meet somebody or other I knew. A
  good many of the diplomatic circle lounge there in the afternoon, for of late
  it had become the cosmopolitan rendesvous of Brussels, even more so than the
  cafe of the Grand Hotel opposite. I was not disappointed, for as I entered I
  was hailed by Paul Yermoloff, the second secretary of the Russian Legation, a
  dark-moustached, good-looking man of 40, who was sitting at one of the little
  tables smoking with his colleague Gregorovitch, the honorary attache.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear Crawford," the firstnamed cried, extending his hand, "late
  to-day. Do the difficulties of England require so much adjustment that you
  cannot get down to the Boulevards at the usual hour?"'</p>

  <p>"No," I laughed, seating myself in the third chair, and taking a cigarette
  he offered. "Truth to tell I've had a siesta."</p>

  <p>"The British lion has been napping," laughed Gregorovitch.</p>

  <p>"It isn't often he has a nap," I said, "but today, with this overcast
  weather&mdash;phew!"</p>

  <p>"And after late hours last night, and the pretty Princess Melanie,"
  Yermoloff added.</p>

  <p>At mention of her name I felt my face suffusing. Then their lynx eyes had
  not failed to notice me with her. I had no wish to be chaffed about her, but
  to resent it would be, I knew, to show my hand.</p>

  <p>"Why, what about the Princess?" I asked with affected innocence.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Only she's very beautiful," responded Yermoloff. "We've just
  been speaking of her, and congratulating you upon your taste."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "There can be no two opinions regarding her beauty. Does
  she often come to Brussels?"</p>

  <p>"Twice a year," he answered. "But take my advice, my dear follow, and
  don't have very much to do with her."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Serge will tell you. He knows her best," answered, the Russian, who was
  at one and the same time my personal friend and my diplomatic enemy.</p>

  <p>"Well," exclaimed Gregorovitch, stroking his blonde moustache with a
  rather foppish air, "I do happen to know something of her Highness, and what
  I know of her isn't very creditable."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," I exclaimed, intensely interested.</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged glances, the meaning of which remained to me a
  mystery, although I did not fail to notice it.</p>

  <p>"Well," the other answered, "she's rather fond of taking up a man for a
  week or so and then giving him the cut direct, or else bringing him into
  public derision. She is lovely, but a Royalty as she is she is aware of the
  exact estimate of her beauty. By the Virgin! Why, there isn't a prouder woman
  in the whole of the Courts of Europe than Melanie of Hapsburg."</p>

  <p>What he alleged might be true, but I certainly had found her the very
  reverse of proud.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's much fear that she'll take me up," I laughed
  lightly. "Men in the diplomatic circle are too small a fry."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no. You're mistaken," Gregorovitch said. "There was an incident in
  Berlin when I was there which didn't altogether enhance her worth in the eyes
  of those who knew the truth. She flirted outrageously with young Prince
  Ostrowsky, one of the honorary attaches of our Embassy, and when one day at a
  garden-party given by the Empress he grew affectionate and spoke to her of
  love she flew into a sudden passion and denounced poor Ostrowsky before about
  a dozen people, including the Empress herself. So overwhelmed with shame and
  chargrin was the unfortunate attache that he resigned at once, and went back
  to Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"I have heard," I said, "that she has a secret lover somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Of course," answered Yermoloff. "That's well known. According to common
  gossip she meets him at night somewhere along the Boulevard Waterloo. It is
  said that she's been seen with him lately, and that he's a shabby-genteel,
  hulking, ruffianly-looking fellow."</p>

  <p>"Quite romantic," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Romantic!" ejaculated Gregorovitch, who seemed somehow to hold her in
  abhorrence. "Two or three men I know are laying their heads together to watch
  for the mysterious lover, and find out who he really is. It would be
  interesting to know."</p>

  <p>I pricked up my ears at this statement. If this were so, then I must warn
  her.</p>

  <p>"Rather good fun," I said, smiling. "Is he supposed to be a German, or
  Belgian?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows," replied my companion. "That's just what we want to find
  out."</p>

  <p>"But has she actually been seen with him?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly. When she was here six months ago, the same story was
  about. The Baroness de Melreux has actually seen them together."</p>

  <p>"And you believe her?" I asked, deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>I remembered the Princess' words regarding that irresponsible butterfly of
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said Gregorovitch, raising his shoulders slightly, "the
  Baroness is always good fun, even if she's given to slight exaggerations of
  the truth."</p>

  <p>"You put it politely," I laughed. "No, my dear Gregorovitch, one should
  always take the statements of the merry little Baroness in homeopathic doses
  and with the proverbial grain of salt. She's always full of some scandal or
  the other."</p>

  <p>"Scandal which generally turns out to have some foundation in fact,"
  Yermoloff remarked.</p>

  <p>"Then you really believe in this story of a secret lover?" I observed.</p>

  <p>"There seems little doubt about it," my friend replied. "But why are you
  so anxious, my dear Crawford? Surely you haven't fallen a victim to her
  charms. She looked lovely last night in blue, dazzling enough to bewitch any
  man."</p>

  <p>"No fear. I'm too old a diplomat," I assured him. I saw that in order to
  disarm the suspicion of these men I must act with extreme caution and
  finesse. It was to my interest to retain their friendship, for from them I
  often gathered very valuable facts. They were a pair of self-conceited,
  foppish gallants who, in their boastful moments, frequently told me things
  which were of greatest use to us at our Legation. Times without number had I
  carefully led the conversation up to the political crisis, but had each time
  become convinced that they knew nothing of the theft of that file of
  correspondence, otherwise they must have uttered some boast or other and thus
  betrayed their knowledge. Their belief in the supremacy of Russia was
  sublime. But why, I wondered, did they both speak of the Princess with such
  ill-will?</p>

  <p>I smoked on, chatting still upon the same subject. They took a keen
  delight in chaffing me about my long talk with her and our dance together,
  declaring that I, like all the rest, had fallen deeply in love with her.
  Against this allegation I, of course, protested strongly. She had treated me
  with common courtesy, I said, and I had merely returned it. I laughed
  heartily at their suggestion that I was in love with her, and in return
  declared that they were both jealous that she should have singled me out for
  notice.</p>

  <p>"No, don't think that, my dear Crawford," Yermoloff answered in his soft,
  easy way, smiling through the cigarette smoke. "On the contrary, I should
  regret very much if she were to endeavour to patronise me, for I really fear
  I should be rude to her."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>But he shrugged his shoulders with that expressive air of mystery which
  all Russians can assume at will, and his mouth remained closed. Neither would
  he explain the cause of their extreme antagonism. But the fact was plain. For
  some inexplicable reason they hated her.</p>

  <p>At 6 o'clock we rose and went forth on to the Boulevard again. It was
  pleasant there in the sunset hour. Men were crying the <i>Soir</i> and the
  <i>Independance</i>, and the hand-barrows advertising the cafe concerts were
  being trundled slowly by. My companions hailed a cab, and were driven away to
  the Gare du Nord, where they were to meet a friend, while I strolled along to
  the Bourse, where I could obtain a tram that would set me down outside my own
  rooms in the Place Louise, for the open trams in Brussels are in summer even
  more pleasant than the fiacres.</p>

  <p>Outside the Bourse, at the street corner, I halted to buy a paper at the
  kiosque, when a man passed me whose figure in an instant struck me as
  familiar. I looked after him. He was well dressed, above the average height,
  and wore a silk hat and frock coat which gave him the stamp of a business
  man. The face was rather a full one, with a fair pointed beard, ruddy cheeks
  and eyes a trifle strange in their expression. He wore, I thought, a curious,
  inquisitive look as he passed me.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly I recollected. That man had been sitting alone near us in
  the cafe, and possibly, if he understood English, had overheard some part of
  our conversation.</p>

  <p>But at the same moment that this fact became impressed upon me another,
  still stranger, caused me to hold my breath in wonder.</p>

  <p>The silhouette was identical. He was the man, who so silent and plainly
  clad, had passed through the Moorish lounge at the Palace on the previous
  night. He was the unexpected stranger whom the Princess Melanie held in such
  mortal dread.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE ROSE OF LOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">AS usual I cycled next morning to our appointed rendezvous,
  seated myself, and patiently smoked, my eyes eager for the approach of the
  first tram-car. At last it came, its alarm bell ringing violently; the
  passengers alighted and one by one dispersed, but to my disappointment my
  divinity was not among them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she had risen late, and would come by the next car, therefore I
  returned to my seat, and possessed my soul in patience, full of reflections
  upon the events of the past few days. That man who had sat in the Metropole
  on the previous afternoon was most probably her mysterious lover about whom
  gossip talked, and it seemed very possible that, having detected me with her
  on the night of the State ball, he was now keeping a strict observation upon
  me in order to ascertain whether we met. I held this man in instinctive
  dislike. Why, I could not tell. There was nothing really evil about the
  expression on his face. On the contrary he was a rubicund, rather
  merry-looking man of perhaps forty, whose appearance gave me the impression
  that his sleekness was due to a fondness of good living. So far from being a
  hulking, low-born hanger-on, as I had pictured him, he seemed a rather gentle
  manly fellow of the superior commercial class.</p>

  <p>I sat endeavouring to analyse my feelings towards him, and at length came
  to the conclusion that my antagonism was due solely and entirely to jealousy.
  Had I met that man in the ordinary way I should have undoubtedly become
  friendly with him. There are men one meets who become instantly one's
  friends. He was one of those.</p>

  <p>Presently the second tram drew up at the entrance to the Bois, but she
  came not, and although I waited fully an hour until the liver brigade began
  to assemble&mdash;Belgians in riding breeches cut in imitation of the
  English, and hats of antiquated type, a few of the gayer youth of the city,
  and a sprinkling of stolid Flemish merchants&mdash;I remained in vain. The
  morning was, as is usual in June, bright and beautiful; therefore, feeling
  reassured that she had been prevented from keeping her appointment by
  unforeseen circumstances, I mounted my machine, and rode the whole circuit of
  the Bois, my eyes ever on the alert for her.</p>

  <p>That she would not willingly disappoint me I felt certain; therefore her
  absence puzzled me, and caused me to wonder whether instead of keeping her
  appointment she had met that man who was her lover. Twice I made a complete
  tour of the pretty wood, but saw nothing of her, and at last in deep
  disappointment turned, and was on my way out when, of a sudden, I discerned a
  man mounted on a fine bay trotting along the leafy ride running parallel with
  the road, and half-hidden from it by the bushes and trees. He wore a straw
  hat and black coat, and rode exceedingly well in military style. His height
  attracted me, and I noticed that he had a light pointed beard. Our eyes met,
  and then in a moment I recognised in him the man whom the Princess held in
  mortal dread&mdash;the man who was her lover.</p>

  <p>He looked fixedly at me for a few seconds, and I thought I detected a
  smile of triumph on his lips. But in a moment he had trotted past, and
  without turning I rode forward down the Avenue towards my own rooms. The
  thought struck me that he had come there to watch my movements, and to
  ascertain whether I met the woman who held me spellbound. It seemed
  suspiciously as though he had.</p>

  <p>I spent the morning at the Legation attending to some correspondence, and
  not having finished it, returned there after luncheon.</p>

  <p>About 4, having completed the work I had in hand, I descended the stairs
  to go, when standing in the court-yard outside was one of the royal
  carriages, the footman waiting motionless and statuesque upon the steps. On
  passing the door of the drawing-room female voices and light laughter
  sounded, and peering within I saw that Lady Drummond had a caller. The
  latter, sitting near the window, wore a smart costume of prune with a large
  black hat, and as I looked in her gaze suddenly met mine. It was the Princess
  Melanie.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried, raising her hand to me gladly. "There is M'sieur
  Crawford! Good afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Princess!" I exclaimed, advancing towards her and taking
  her proffered hand with a feigned formality. She was purely formal towards
  me, therefore I saw that she had some motive. As far as I was aware this was
  her first call upon Lady Drummond, and the latter, honoured by the attention,
  seemed greatly surprised that we should be acquainted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," the Princes said, in response to an observation by her
  ladyship. "M'sieur Crawford is my very good friend." Then, glancing at me
  with a meaning look, she added, "He was in Vienna, you know."</p>

  <p>"Ah! of course," answered Lady Drummond, who, truth to tell, had been
  extremely kind to me. She was an ideal Ambassador's wife, and was held in
  highest esteem by all the staff. More than once, at the various capitals
  where her husband had been Charge d'Affaires for her Majesty, Envoy
  Extraordinary, she had been confidante and adviser of an attache or a
  secretary who had got into feminine entanglement. As we chatted she glanced
  from her visitor to myself, and knowing her shrewdness I feared that she
  guessed the truth. Our gossip was, however, on trivialities. Melanie, it
  appeared, had called, on her mother's behalf, to invite the Ambassador and
  his wife to dine with them at the Palace on the following Sunday, and in the
  invitation Giffard and myself were included.</p>

  <p>I thanked her in terms of distant formality, addressing her as 'Highness,'
  which is unusual according to German etiquette. Tea was brought, and as I
  handed her her cup she raised her eyes to mine with an amused expression. I
  longed to ask her why she had not met me that morning, but to speak
  familiarly was, in these circumstances, impossible. The Hapsbourgs were the
  proudest family in Europe, and Lady Drummond, a polished diplomatist herself,
  treated her with the same etiquette as she would the Queen of the
  Belgians.</p>

  <p>At length, after quite a long gossip, during which time we had been joined
  by Sir John, who, however, had been again called away to keep an appointment,
  she rose to go. When she did so I saw how beautiful was her costume. It was
  of dark prune cloth, braided with black upon a groundwork of cream satin; a
  strikingly handsome dress which only a princess could wear, a dress which
  fitted without a wrinkle, and was the latest triumph of one or other of the
  man-dressmakers in the Rue de la Paix.</p>

  <p>"If you will remain one moment I will obtain for your Highness the address
  of that shop in Bond-street," Lady Drummond said, as she passed out hastily
  into the adjoining room.</p>

  <p>The instant she had gone my companion turned to me quickly and
  whispered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Forgive me. I could not come to the Bois this morning. To-morrow, too, I
  am prevented. You'll excuse me, will you not?"</p>

  <p>"But I must see you," I said earnestly. "I have something of importance to
  say."</p>

  <p>She glanced at me in quick surprise.</p>

  <p>"Cannot you tell me now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I must meet you. Whatever appointment you can make I am at your
  disposal."</p>

  <p>She reflected for an instant.</p>

  <p>"Then to-night," she answered. "Meet me in the Wauxhall Gardens, close to
  the band-stand, at 9. I will wear a white blouse, and you will discover me by
  that. Till then good-bye."</p>

  <p>At that instant her ladyship returned with a card, and a few moments later
  I took formal leave of the woman I loved standing on the steps with the wife
  of my chief and bowing to her as her fine equipage swept out of the gate.</p>

  <p>Yes, the more I reflected, the plainer it became that she was not averse
  to this mild flirtation going on between us. That she did flirt with me was
  without doubt; and of course with that quick instinct possessed by every
  woman from peasant to princess she was fully aware of my overwhelming passion
  for her.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea you were so friendly with the Princess Melanie," her
  ladyship remarked, as we went inside together. "She is most beautiful. But of
  course the House of Hapsbourg has always been famous for the loveliness of
  its women."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, recollecting the well-known legend of the Castle of
  Brandenburg, how when the great old fortress-home of the Hapsbourgs was
  besieged by the bloody Duc de Nevers in 1554, Ann, Princess of Hapsbourg, is
  said to have entered with her husband the high round tower that watches over
  the Moselle, resolved to participate in its defence, and to animate the
  defenders by her presence. Her beauty was renowned throughout Europe, and for
  months the castle withstood the siege. At last, however, outnumbered by the
  Franks, the garrison, including the Prince, after a most heroic and desperate
  resistance, perished to a man, the unhappy widowed Princess being left as
  solo survivor. Determined not to fall into the hands of the enraged and
  brutal soldiery, she threw herself from the summit of the tower in full sight
  of the besiegers, and was dashed to pieces on the rocks below.</p>

  <p>"She has a charming manner," went on her ladyship. "So ingenuous and
  unassuming. I'm perfectly delighted with her."</p>

  <p>"This is her first call, is it not?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She has been in Brussels with her mother many times, but they are
  very exclusive, and scarcely call on anyone&mdash;except, of course, at the
  German Embassy. She's a most sociable girl, and I'm charmed to know her."</p>

  <p>I smiled within myself. What would her ladyship have thought had she known
  that we were in the habit of cycling together at an hour when the majority of
  people were not yet awake. What would she have thought if she had known of
  the appointment we had made in that instant when she was in the adjoining
  room; or of the fact that she was to wear a white blouse that evening in
  order that I might the more readily recognise her in the shadow of the trees.
  I was compelled to remain silent in order to avoid compromising her, for she
  was princess of an imperial house while I was a humble member of her
  Majesty's Diplomatic Service. I had promised to remain loyal to her.</p>

  <p>The night was brilliant and starlit when I entered that enclosed part of
  the Royal Park known as Wauxhall&mdash;where on summer evenings the orchestra
  of the opera plays on the <i>al fresco</i> stage, and the <i>haut monde</i>
  of Brussels sit beneath the trees at the hundreds of little tables taking
  their after-dinner coffee and liqueurs. Of all the many diversions in the
  Belgian capital it is perhaps the most chic and the most enjoyable, for the
  music is invariably excellent, and the crowd always a well-dressed one. The
  tourist who spends his week in Brussels does not patronise a mere orchestral
  concert; he prefers the cafes where variety entertainments are provided, and
  where 'ENTRANCE FREE' is written up in bold capitals. Hence Wauxhall is
  purely Belgian.</p>

  <p>I found a table unoccupied at the further end, beyond the stage and
  somewhat in the shadow, therefore I took it and ordered some coffee, hoping
  that I should meet no friends and be compelled to join them. It was
  delightfully cool and fresh there after the heat of the day, and I sat
  drinking in the air, enjoying my cigar to the full. I had had a heavy day,
  and that relaxation was doubly gratifying. The whole of the white facade of
  the Theatre du Parc opposite was outlined by light in white globes and
  everywhere in the vicinity of the orchestra was brilliant illumination, but
  where I sat was beyond the zone of light, for I had chosen that spot in order
  that none should observe me. Among that after-dinner crowd of women in
  evening toilettes and well-dressed men there were many with whom I was
  acquainted, and if, for example, one man fastened himself upon me I might
  lose my opportunity of speaking with her.</p>

  <p>At length, after straining my eyes long and vainly into the stream of
  constant arrivals, I saw a female figure in black hat, wearing a dead white
  blouse of soft silk, and at once rose to meet her. She wore a thick veil, and
  at first I hesitated to speak, not being quite certain as to her identity.
  She noticed this, and laughing at the completeness of her disguise greeted me
  and seated herself at my table.</p>

  <p>"That veil is excellent," I said, joining in her laughter. "I should never
  have recognised you."</p>

  <p>"I borrowed one of my maid's blouses," she explained. "There are many
  women here I know, and some are very sharp to detect any bodice they have
  seen before."</p>

  <p>"Will anyone be likely to recognise you here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Perhaps they might," she said, glancing round in apprehension.
  "There's the Countess Lunssens over there," she added, indicating an old lady
  in gay bonnet of steel spangles and roses, chatting to an officer. "Yes it
  will be better to get away from here."</p>

  <p>Therefore we rose again and strolled away into the dark shadows beneath
  the trees. It was strange and exciting, this clandestine meeting, but she was
  veiled, and we both congratulated ourselves that she was beyond recognition.
  Into that dark avenue only one or two couples had strayed, and we were
  practically alone. The band was playing Saint-Saens' <i>Danse Macabre</i>,
  and through the trees, where the lights twinkled, came the distant roar of
  the city and the rattle of cabs in the Rue Royale.</p>

  <p>The palace was close by. Indeed she had only to cross the road and
  traverse the park to meet me. She had, she explained, escaped immediately
  after dinner, her maid alone being in the secret of her absence; and then she
  chatted to me with that light vivacity which was in itself plain proof of how
  delighted she was to walk there. I had been egotistical enough to flatter
  myself that she was not averse to my company, and now it seemed as though she
  remained in rapturous contentment.</p>

  <p>In the gloom we found a seat and sat down.</p>

  <p>She was discussing her visit to Lady Drummond, and expressing herself
  surprised to find her so pleasant.</p>

  <p>"I had been told," she said, "that your Ambassador's wife was rather
  masculine, and I abominate masculine women. But I found her the exact
  opposite. She was extremely agreeable."</p>

  <p>"It was your first call?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. Then, after a pause she faltered, "I did not go
  exactly to visit her, you know. I thought perhaps I might possibly meet you,
  and I wanted to see you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired, rather abruptly I am afraid.</p>

  <p>"Well," she responded in a voice of hesitation, "first I feel convinced
  that we are friends&mdash;is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"If I may be your true friend, Princess," I said. "I shall esteem your
  trust the greatest honour you can bestow upon me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said quietly. "I believe entirely that you are a man of
  honour. Do not think I speak to you thus without having made inquiries. Your
  past has shown that I, a woman who is in a dire dilemma, may trust you."</p>

  <p>"You can implicitly," I answered fervently. "I assure you of that. You say
  you are in a dilemma," I went on, puzzled. "How can I assist you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no. Not now," she replied in a rather strained voice. "No, not yet.
  What I wanted to ask you was whether, if I desired your help, you would give
  it to me; whether you would act in blind obedience to my wishes?"</p>

  <p>"Princess," I said, in deep earnestness, "I am a diplomatist&mdash;one who
  to your eyes must be but a spy and a liar by profession. Well, my oath to my
  Queen entails the combating of the machinations of unscrupulous enemies, and
  when fair means fail we are compelled to resort to those unfair. Towards you,
  however, I assure you that if ever I can render you a service you have only
  to command me."</p>

  <p>"And if that service were a difficult one&mdash;a very difficult one?" she
  asked, almost in a whisper, as she bent towards me, peering eagerly into my
  face. "What then?"</p>

  <p>"That makes no difference," I answered, firmly. "To serve you is the
  greatest desire of my life."</p>

  <p>She sighed heavily, and seemed strangely uneasy.</p>

  <p>"In what dilemma do you find yourself?" I went on. "Tell me. Perhaps I can
  assist you now."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," she responded. "Some day, however, I shall call upon you to
  redeem your promise."</p>

  <p>"Put me to the test," I cried passionately. "You will not find me
  fail."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said, again sighing. "It is strange that we should meet like
  this, you and I; strange that having only known you for so short a time I
  should speak thus to you. I fear you must think me very capricious."</p>

  <p>"Our talks are most delightful to me," I declared. "I only fear that my
  companionship may bore you."</p>

  <p>She laughed a little musical laugh.</p>

  <p>"If so, then why did you ask me to see you tonight?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Because I have something to say to you," I replied, in a moment serious.
  "Do not think me inquisitive, for I admit that I have no right whatever to
  obtrude in your private affairs."</p>

  <p>"Are we not friends?" she interrupted quickly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I said. "But this matter is of so delicate a nature that were
  it not imperative I should hesitate to speak of it."</p>

  <p>"No," she said, interested. "Tell me. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You will remember the night of the ball. Before we parted we encountered
  a tall, fair-bearded man, who looked at you with a curious glance and passed
  on."</p>

  <p>She started perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. And what of him?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"That man, whoever he is, has been following me of late," I said,
  simply.</p>

  <p>"Following you!" she cried. "Has he, then, dared to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she stopped short without finishing her sentence. In her anger she had
  almost given me an explanation, and only drew herself up just in time.</p>

  <p>"I thought it wise to tell you of this, and to ask your advice," I went
  on, as calmly as I could, adding: "And again, there is one other matter, for
  mentioning which I hope you will forgive me."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to forgive between friends," she responded.</p>

  <p>"Well, briefly it is this," I said. "In certain circles, where gossip
  circulates and names are bandied about freely, there is a report current that
  you meet clandestinely some male acquaintance on certain nights in the
  Boulevard Waterloo, and elsewhere. I do not demand to know whether this is
  truth or not," I added, hoarsely. "I have no right to make such inquiry."</p>

  <p>"And supposing it to be actually the truth?" she asked quickly, in a
  rather resentful tone. "What then?"</p>

  <p>"There is a secret conspiracy on foot against you," I said in a very quiet
  tone. "It is intended one night to follow you to the place of assignation,
  and there discover you with your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With my lover," she said, finishing my sentence. "Yes, I know full well
  your thoughts, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"It is suggested that you love this man," I declared quite plainly.</p>

  <p>"So my enemies are plotting to create a scandal about me!" she exclaimed,
  with quick warmth. "There is, I suppose, not sufficient scandal in Brussels,
  therefore they must needs invent more. They would blast the reputation of
  every honest woman. When did you learn this?"</p>

  <p>"Only yesterday," I answered. "It was the duty of a friend to warn you,
  even though it be a painful task."</p>

  <p>She was pensive for a long time. There was an interval in the music, and
  all was calm and peaceful in the half-darkness where we sat.</p>

  <p>Then, turning to me, she suddenly grasped my hand warmly in hers,
  saying:</p>

  <p>"In giving me this warning you have rendered me a great service&mdash;how
  great you cannot dream. Believe me, I shall never forget it&mdash;never."</p>

  <p>And there was a strange catch in her voice which I knew to be due to
  emotion which she had striven in vain to repress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE EVIL OF THE HAPSBOURGS</h2>

  <p class="first">WE remained silent, both too full of thoughts for utterance.
  The orchestra had struck up again, and was playing a bright air from the
  <i>Coupe du Roi de Thule</i> of Diaz, and the shadowy figures that had
  wandered past us during the interval were now returning to that gay circle of
  light where the fashionable chatterers were sitting lazily beneath the
  trees.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that I have been able to render you my first service,
  Princess," I exclaimed at length in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She was sitting beside me immovable, gazing straight before her, her
  breast now and then heaving and falling beneath the thin white blouse. Once I
  thought she had involuntarily murmured some incoherent words, but next
  instant I doubted whether it had not been the rustling of the treetops. She
  was greatly agitated at the discovery of this conspiracy to unmask her, and
  had sat rigid and silent as if trying to devise some plan of action.</p>

  <p>"I can only thank you, m'sieur," she answered at last, in a voice which
  sounded sweet and musical. "The world is very ungenerous towards a woman, be
  she a work-girl or a princess. I have often thought that the women of the
  people have a far happier time than we who are ever in the lurid glare of
  publicity. Indeed, perhaps you would not believe it, but when driving out on
  Sundays I have often envied the young shopgirl contentedly walking on her
  lover's arm, for she is free to love or to hate, and she can enjoy the
  pleasures of life untrammelled and unfettered. She has no fear of scandal, or
  of the idle, envenomed gossip of jealous women. The world is hers, and she
  enjoys it to the full, even though she works for her bread and her happiness
  may not be unmixed with tears."</p>

  <p>I expressed myself fully in accord with her views. Never had the rigidity
  of life in the royal circle been so vividly brought before me as at that
  moment, for were not her words in themselves an admission that this man she
  met clandestinely was actually her lover? Her voice, too, was the voice of a
  woman overwhelmed by grief, distressed, rendered desperate.</p>

  <p>"You are upset to-night," I said, bending to her in a half-whisper. "Will
  you not allow me to assist you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, despairingly. "I fear you cannot at present. In you I
  have, I know, a friend&mdash;one in whom I can trust, and one with whom my
  secret is safe."</p>

  <p>"The secret of your love?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"My love!" she echoed. "No, no. Not my love&mdash;my hatred."</p>

  <p>"Your hatred?" I exclaimed. "I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. How should you when you are still in ignorance."</p>

  <p>"But every woman must love once in her life," I said.</p>

  <p>"And love very frequently brings to her unhappiness," she observed
  philosophically.</p>

  <p>"I trust that is not your experience," I responded.</p>

  <p>Her breast beneath the thin silken blouse again rose and fell slowly. I
  could not distinguish her face behind the thick veil in that deep shadow of
  the trees, but I had an instinctive feeling that tears were in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I sometimes think," she said in a strained tremulous voice, "that every
  woman has a birthright of woe."</p>

  <p>"You speak as though you were oppressed by some burden of unhappiness," I
  said softly. "May I know the truth now that I am your friend? May I not help
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered firmly, sighing as she shook her head. "It is utterly
  impossible&mdash;utterly. The complications are so bewildering and the
  circumstances so strange that you could never believe the truth. It would
  appear to you far too romantic&mdash;too unreal."</p>

  <p>"But tell me one thing," I urged. "That man who was present at the
  ball&mdash;who is he?"</p>

  <p>"That man!" she gasped, trembling. "That man is my&mdash;&mdash;" But she
  stopped short, and held her breath. "No! No!" she cried a moment later. "You
  promised blind obedience to my wish, therefore remain patient at present. Ask
  me no question."</p>

  <p>I saw how agitated she was, how strangely despairing, how utterly
  desperate. She was just as an ordinary woman haunted by some terrible
  ever-present dread, fearing every moment that some long-expected blow should
  fall and crush her. Loving her so fondly as I did, my heart went forth to
  her. I could not bear to see her thus anxious and consumed by fear, and
  longed to be able to pour forth my declaration of devotion. Yet I hesitated.
  The difference in our stations formed a gulf which could never be bridged.
  Even if I were a millionaire I could never aspire to the hand of a princess
  of the House of Hapsbourg.</p>

  <p>"I ask the question," I said, "because I, humble man that I am, have your
  welfare at heart."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I am confident that you have," she answered with an air of gracious
  acknowledgment of my tribute. "Our acquaintanceship has not been of long
  duration, but I know you sufficiently well to be aware that we are, shall be,
  the firmest of friends. At present my future is but a black out-look, but
  some day I trust its aspect will change."</p>

  <p>"A black outlook! What do you mean?" I asked quickly, much puzzled. The
  idea of the future of the smart and beautiful Princess Melanie being other
  than happy seemed impossible. Throughout Europe she was noted for the
  smartness of her toilettes and the sweetness of her face. At Court every one
  believed her to be merry, irresponsible, and utterly heartless where man's
  affections were concerned. People had talked, and the papers had gossiped
  about a projected alliance between the Hapsbourgs and the royal family of
  Italy; but those who knew said that Melanie had treated the young
  prince&mdash;who was a prig at best&mdash;with scant favour, and that after a
  month at Brandenberg he had gone back to Rome very much disconcerted, while
  she had openly declared herself glad to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for you to understand my position," she declared. "That
  it is a grave one&mdash;a very grave one&mdash;is all that I dare tell you.
  Someday you may perhaps know the truth. Then you will recognise what I feel
  to-night in thus gaining your friendship."</p>

  <p>"If it is gratifying to you it is the more gratifying to me," I blurted
  forth. "All that I fear is that I am unworthy to be your Highness's friend
  and confidant."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no," she protested. "I do not extend friendship to all and sundry.
  People say, I think, that I am proud and exclusive, and that I retain the
  ancient hauteur of my House. That is what I have been always taught to do. I
  have been told from my earliest girlhood that, as a royal princess, I am of
  different blood to the people, and that the latter are of no account in our
  world. I used, in my girlish ignorance, to think so until a couple of years
  ago."</p>

  <p>"And you have now formed a different opinion," I observed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>I was puzzled to know whether this tall, fair-bearded man who had crossed
  the Moorish room in the Palace noiseless as a shadow, and who had taken such
  intense interests in my movements, was actually the man she met so often at
  night. Surely it could not be, for she had declared that she hated him. Why,
  I wondered.</p>

  <p>"The man whose presence at the ball caused you so much anxiety was in the
  Bois this morning," I said. "Perhaps it was as well that you did not cycle
  with me there."</p>

  <p>"It was for that very reason I did not come," she answered. "I had
  obtained previous knowledge of his intention."</p>

  <p>"I cannot stifle a suspicion that he has some sinister design upon me," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Sinister design? What do you suspect?"</p>

  <p>"That he might be consumed by jealousy if, for example, he saw us as we
  are now, sitting here, like lovers," I answered abruptly.</p>

  <p>"But you surely do not think that he is my lover, do you?" she cried,
  dismayed.</p>

  <p>I admitted that I had believed him to be.</p>

  <p>"No," she assured me with a harsh laugh. "There has never been love
  between us&mdash;only hatred&mdash;a bitter, deadly hatred which was once
  near culminating in a tragedy."</p>

  <p>Her words increased my curiosity. There was here some remarkable mystery
  of the undercurrent of the highest circle of society in Europe. Who, I
  wondered, could this man be?</p>

  <p>"From your words, Princess, one would almost imagine that love had never
  entered your heart," I said.</p>

  <p>"It is legendary that the love of the Hapsbourgs is always ill-fated. In
  the annals of our House are many love-romances&mdash;some with very sad
  denouements. It is a saying, too, that a dark Hapsbourg brings
  ill-fortune."</p>

  <p>"You are a dark Hapsbourg," I said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, yes," she answered, in a rather strained, unnatural
  tone.</p>

  <p>"But those who have beauty never bring ill luck is an old saying of the
  peasantry down in Tuscany," I said cheerfully. "It nevertheless pains me to
  know that you are troubled by this mysterious dilemma in which you find
  yourself to-night. I only wish you would allow me to render you some help.
  Do," I urged.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she inquired, after a moment's pause, as she turned towards me.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;" But I hesitated in confusion. I
  feared to speak those words which rose so readily to my lips, although I had
  striven so hard to repress them.</p>

  <p>She was sitting beside me erect, motionless, her head turned towards me in
  an attitude of surprise. She had raised her veil because she declared that it
  stifled her, and was looking at me with those soft dark eyes, so brilliant
  and beautiful. There was an element of romance in that meeting, and I had
  scented danger in the secret of our friendship being known to that silent
  stranger who had sat unnoticed in the Cafe Metropole, and had followed me as
  far as the Bourse. I felt assured that he harboured some evil intention.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so anxious to take upon yourself a burden that you might find
  insupportable?" she asked, in a sweet half-reproachful tone.</p>

  <p>"Because, Princess," I stammered, unable longer to suppress the burning
  passion within me, "forgive me for uttering the truth, but I cannot longer
  conceal it. It is because I love you!"</p>

  <p>In an instant she drew away with a little frightened cry, as though in
  fear of me.</p>

  <p>"Love!" she gasped in a tone of blank surprise? "Ah! I have been
  foolish&mdash;very foolish! Why have I allowed you to mistake a purely
  platonic friendship for flirtation? It is all my fault."</p>

  <p>"It is not flirtation," I assured her passionately, catching her soft
  white hand, and holding it tenderly within mine. "I know that I am foolish,
  that these words of mine are sheer madness, and that you, in your position,
  can never be wife of an humble man like myself. Still, since the first moment
  that we met I have been drawn towards you irresistibly, and, sleeping or
  waking, one face has been ever in my dreams, one name ever ringing in my
  ears&mdash;Melanie&mdash;Melanie&mdash;always Melanie."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she faltered in a broken voice. "You must not speak like that.
  We may be friends, firm, true friends, but love is utterly impossible."</p>

  <p>"But hear me!" I implored, in a low earnest voice. "I cannot be
  ceremonious with you now that you know the secret which, through so many
  days, has been wearing out my heart. Do not say that love is impossible. Only
  give me leave to love you, to think of you as one who in some slight degree
  reciprocates my passion; give me leave to drop formalities, and call you by
  your Christian name when we are alone, and I will be satisfied. I will ask no
  more."</p>

  <p>The tiny hand I held trembled. She sighed, and a shudder ran through her
  slight frame.</p>

  <p>"Such permission, were I to give it, could only result disastrously," she
  answered sadly, with a calm philosophy.</p>

  <p>"But do not withhold it," I cried in an outburst of desperate
  recklessness. "I love you, Melanie, with all my soul. I swear I do. I am
  yours irrevocably, and for always."</p>

  <p>She drew away her hand firmly, and seemed to hold herself up with that
  proud hauteur which she assumed towards all others save myself.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, in a tone of soft tenderness. "It is impossible. I
  regret this very, very deeply," she added, after a moment's reflection. "The
  more so because I have looked upon you as my friend&mdash;one in whom I had
  every confidence."</p>

  <p>"I trust I have given you no offence," I said, apologetically. "My words
  were spontaneous. I tried to suppress them, but the truth of my affection
  rose involuntarily to my lips."</p>

  <p>"It is no offence to love," she answered, in a low voice full of emotion.
  "But if you would be my friend, and if you would assist me, do not speak
  again of affection. Such discussions as this can only be painful to both of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Then you do love me a little," I cried, joyously. "If you did not it
  could not pain you. Come, Melanie," I added, again taking her hand, "give me
  permission to love you."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she cried, hoarsely, suddenly rising to her feet, and again
  snatching away the hand I had caught. "A thousand times, no! Your love for me
  can only bring disaster to both of us. God knows my life is dark enough, one
  long interminable tragedy, and I will never sacrifice you as victim. You ask
  me to encompass you with fatality and evil. But I refuse. We must part. You
  shall not&mdash;you must not love me. I am a dark Hapsburg, and my love is
  fatal&mdash;fatal!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; AN AFFINITY OF SOULS</h2>

  <p class="first">"AH, no, Princess!" I said, in deepest anxiety and
  earnestness. "Surely your goodwill cannot bring evil upon me? Rather would it
  render me a better and happier man."</p>

  <p>"You already have my goodwill," she answered, scarcely above her breath,
  in a voice which showed how moved she was. I could not disguise from myself
  that she, although a princess, was nevertheless a woman after all, a woman
  who yearned for love and tenderness, although oppressed by some mysterious
  secret of which I was in ignorance. Even in the gloom of night her wondrous
  beauty, a beauty renowned throughout Europe, shone upon me. Her face was
  inexpressibly sweet in its sadness. Was there, notwithstanding her refusal, a
  love-look in those dark, luminous eyes: It was too dark for me to see
  plainly, but I vaguely believed that there was. Her voice, low and tender,
  gave proof of it, and I was thereby encouraged.</p>

  <p>"But it is more than goodwill that I desire," I continued in quick
  passionate earnestness, utterly reckless of what I said. Indeed, I held both
  her hands at that moment, and her head was bowed in silence. "I love you,
  Melanie! I love you with all my heart, with all my soul, with all the
  strength of my being I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried, protestingly. "Do not make my burden harder by such
  words. You do not know&mdash;you never will know, I hope," she added, sadly.
  "Mine is a cruel story, and I am glad there is no necessity to speak of
  it&mdash;I only ask your charity, your sympathy. Love between us is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, in a hoarse voice of disappointment. "I know that now I
  ought to have been self-possessed, and not have pained you thus. I see the
  immeasurable inferiority of my position and my nature to your own. But,
  Melanie, I only wanted one hope, one legitimate ambition."</p>

  <p>"Ah, do not utter such words of reproach," she whispered in an intense
  whisper. "This is as painful to me as to you. If you knew all the truth you
  would not speak like that. A woman of my birth may love with equal affection
  to any other."</p>

  <p>She lifted her head. Her eyes, dry and calm, rested upon my face. Her
  countenance was pale, her mouth set with a grave, steady sweetness.</p>

  <p>Light rushed in upon my mind in a radiant flood-light and knowledge. I
  knew she was right. I had looked deep into her sad eyes, read her innermost
  soul, and found it pure.</p>

  <p>"In the sphere apart from mine you will meet one more fitting for you," I
  said in a voice of grief and blank despair. "You tell me that love is
  impossible. If so, then it will be best, best for both of us, if we do not
  meet again. I must part from you because I love you, and my love might result
  disastrously for you. Yes, I see it all. If the world knew that I, Philip
  Crawford, were your lover there would be scandal in the papers, and in your
  circle you would be laughed to scorn. No, I cannot bear to see you day by day
  and know that you are not for me. If I were beautiful like you, perhaps I
  might rejoice in your beauty and your grace without any selfish
  wish&mdash;but I cannot. If you are not to be mine I cannot enjoy your
  presence. Every charm you have is an added injury, if I am to be indifferent
  to you."</p>

  <p>She covered her eyes with her hands, and her frame was shaken by a
  sob.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I went on regretfully, "I have made you angry, or wounded you again.
  It would be so continually were I to stay. I should be giving you offence
  every hour in the day. Yet I cannot help loving you any more than I can help
  breathing. This, of course, can be nothing to you, a princess, but it is all
  my life to me. You have filled every thought of my mind, every vein of my
  body. How can I separate myself from you?"</p>

  <p>As I poured out these mad words and much more, a flood of hot and
  passionate sentences, she slowly recovered her composure. She allowed her
  hands to remain inertly in mine, and sat listening to me with half-shut
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Melanie," I said, "cannot you give me one word of hope to carry with me?
  I cannot forget you. Surely you have seen my devotion? My mind cannot change.
  Perhaps I have spoken too soon and too rashly, if so, forgive me."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to forgive," she answered once again in a voice blank
  and melancholy. Her heart beat loudly, the lace ruffles on her bosom
  trembled, as slowly she lifted her eyes to mine. I knew that her eyes were
  dimmed by tears.</p>

  <p>"Give me one single word of hope, Melanie," I implored in earnestness. "My
  love for you is no light fancy of sentimental youth captivated by every fresh
  face it sees, putting upon each one the colouring of its own imagination, and
  adoring not what is, but what itself creates; no sudden, selfish, sensuous
  passion, caring only to attain its object, irrespective of reason, right or
  conscience; but the strong deep affection of one who has tried to live
  honourably, and to carry down the traditions of his race."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," she cried, quickly. "I am convinced that you are
  brave, plain-spoken, single-hearted. Would that there were more such men and
  more such love in the world. You ask for permission to love me, but it is not
  just to you that I should give it, knowing full well that marriage is not
  possible, that happiness is barred from us by the difference of our
  stations."</p>

  <p>"Then you do not look upon me with disfavour, Melanie?" I cried, quickly,
  overjoyed. "Your words betray that your heart is really softened towards me,
  and that my appeal is not in vain. Tell me that you give me permission to
  think of you as one who is more than friend&mdash;as one dear to me."</p>

  <p>She looked again in my face with her honest eyes. Smiling as they were,
  there was pathos in them&mdash;the sadness left by that secret which ever
  oppressed her.</p>

  <p>"I know that you are noble, faithful and generous," she answered speaking
  solemnly, slowly. "Therefore if you really desire it I give you that
  permission."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I cried in joyous rapture, raising her hand to my lips and kissing
  it ferverently. "You have brought a great gladness to me to-night. I will
  battle for your sake with all hard fortune, and the world shall know nothing
  of this secret alliance between us. I love you, Melanie, and I will be ever
  loyal, ever faithful, ever true."</p>

  <p>Her breast slowly rose and fell, and her tiny hand gripped mine tightly in
  a manner more expressive than words. That pressure upon my fingers was her
  pledge of faith.</p>

  <p>She was perfectly still and silent, looking into my eyes, and I thought
  that, though it was the same street face, it was different from what it had
  ever been before; no longer the face of my patrician friend, but the face of
  one who held me in tender affection&mdash;a picture of a woman's perfect
  love.</p>

  <p>Again I bent and touched her soft hand with my lips.</p>

  <p>"To kiss your hand as I do is unbounded joy to me, Melanie," I said,
  intensely in earnest. "For now I feel that you are mine&mdash;mine!"</p>

  <p>"Rather regard me as a dear and affectionate friend," she murmured. "Do
  not let us speak of love, but of friendship."</p>

  <p>"No," I protested, "when we are alone together let us speak of our
  affection under its proper name: real and perfect love. When others are
  present, however, you may trust me not to betray our secret."</p>

  <p>"I do trust you," she answered. "I trust you implicitly, as one whose
  prudence and good sense will not allow him to step outside the path of
  perfectly conventional social intercourse. This secret of
  our&mdash;our&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Our love," I said.</p>

  <p>"This secret of our love," she faltered, in a voice so low as to be almost
  incoherent, "must be ours alone."</p>

  <p>"I swear to you that none shall know, not even my own relatives," I
  assured her.</p>

  <p>"I rely upon your secrecy&mdash;Philip," she said.</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had uttered my name, and it sounded so sweet and
  soft from her lips.</p>

  <p>An instant later, however, she added in a tone calm and serious, "There is
  one other condition that I am forced to impose upon you, and that is that
  although I give you this permission, which you have sought, I give you no
  right to question my actions."</p>

  <p>"I have no right to interfere with your liberty of action," I stammered
  humbly. "Our lives lie apart in entirely different spheres. When, however,
  you desire my help in any matter you have only to command me, and I will
  redeem my promise of obedience."</p>

  <p>"And so in future," she murmured, as if speaking to herself, "you are to
  be my companion&mdash;my friend."</p>

  <p>"More than friend," I said earnestly. "Lover. God manifests His will in
  the flowers, in the light of dawn, in the spring; and love is of his
  ordaining. There is a holy affinity between our souls, Melanie. In future we
  cannot be placed apart."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. No leaf among the trees stirred. In the midst of that
  retirement, like a harmony making the silence more complete, rose the low
  strains of distant music.</p>

  <p>She remained with her handsome head bowed, as if, by shading her face, she
  hoped to conceal her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Again I spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are silent."</p>

  <p>"What would you have me say?"</p>

  <p>"I wait for your response."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, a deep sigh escaping her.</p>

  <p>"You have spoken the truth," she answered in a low broken voice, full of
  emotion. "Would that I could also tell you the truth regarding myself. Then
  happiness would be mine."</p>

  <p>"Cannot you tell me?" I urged.</p>

  <p>"Alas! no," she answered in the same low voice, shaking her head sadly.
  "It is a secret which even you may not know. Because of it, sorrow and joy
  mingle within my heart."</p>

  <p>"You are unhappy," I said, seriously. "I know you are terribly unhappy.
  How can I help you? Surely I may render some assistance? I cannot bear to
  think of you, the woman I love, weighed down by a burden of sorrow which you
  are forced to conceal. Has it any connection with that man who discovered us
  together on that eventful evening at the Palace?"</p>

  <p>She paused in reflection. Then she answered, very slowly:</p>

  <p>"Yes, it has."</p>

  <p>"That man is your enemy," I said.</p>

  <p>"My bitterest enemy," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," she cried quickly, in a voice of alarm. "If you love me, then do
  not endeavour to wring from me my secret. I ask you this one favour. Only
  myself need suffer&mdash;not you."</p>

  <p>"But you shall not suffer alone," I declared, firmly. "Your difficulties
  are mine. I will share them with you."</p>

  <p>But sighing heavily again she shook her head despairingly, and
  answered:</p>

  <p>"Some day I may require your aid. Not now. At present no assistance you
  can give would be availing. I am compelled to suffer alone, and in
  silence."</p>

  <p>"Suffer!" I cried. "I will discover who this man is, and acting
  independently, free you from his influence."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no," she cried in quick alarm. "He already knows you. If you sought
  to come between us the consequences would fall upon me&mdash;a dire and
  terrible disaster."</p>

  <p>"But he is not your lover?" I said. "You have already denied that."</p>

  <p>"He is certainly not."</p>

  <p>"Then his jealousy cannot be aroused if I act as your friend," I pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>"The slightest action on your part would suffice to bring upon me a
  catastrophe complete and terrible," she said hoarsely. "He would believe that
  I had betrayed his secret, and he would not spare me, for he is
  relentless."</p>

  <p>"Then you actually live in fear of him?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you," she answered. "He is my enemy."</p>

  <p>"And he possesses some power over you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, an influence which is irresistible."</p>

  <p>"And you, a princess, are compelled to submit to the will or caprice of
  this man?" I cried fiercely. "Surely, there must be some means or other by
  which you may free yourself from his evil power?"</p>

  <p>"If there were I should instantly avail myself of them," she answered
  blankly. "Heaven knows how I have suffered these past two years. To the world
  as Princess of Hapsbourg I am believed to be gay and happy, possessed of all
  that makes life pleasant, and careless of everything; yet beneath that smile
  of satisfaction, which I am compelled to wear because it is expected of one
  of blood royal, I carry a heart laden with sorrow and regret, a heart bowed
  down with grief, remorse, and woe; for I am the most unhappy woman in all the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Your life is overshadowed by this man," I said, surprised at this sudden
  confession of hers. Her voice was low and trembling, showing her dire
  distress.</p>

  <p>"It is because I fear exposure," she said, in a strange mechanical voice.
  "And before exposure I would prefer death. He knows that he holds my life in
  his hands."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Because rather than bear the opprobrium which he could bring upon me I
  would kill myself," she cried hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"And that is the reason you fear him?" I suggested in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She bowed her bead in acquiescence.</p>

  <p>There was a long pause. Her hand was still in mine, and I felt it quiver
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"May I not know who and what this man is?" I asked earnestly at last.
  "Cannot you trust me?"</p>

  <p>"I trust you implicitly," she answered. "But in this matter my safety
  depends entirely upon my silence. I must bear my sorrow alone. No power can
  aid me."</p>

  <p>"If I could render you the smallest assistance I would do so willingly," I
  assured her, once again raising her hand to my lips, and imprinting a tender
  kiss upon it.</p>

  <p>"I am confident of that," she answered with a sigh. "If some day I require
  your aid&mdash;and I may do&mdash;I will ask you to redeem your promise."</p>

  <p>"I will do so," I answered fervently. "At whatever cost I will do your
  bidding."</p>

  <p>"And you will keep the secret of our close acquaintanceship?" she
  urged.</p>

  <p>"No, no," I protested quickly. "Not of our acquaintanceship&mdash;of our
  love."</p>

  <p>"Of our love," she faltered, in a voice so low as to be almost
  inaudible.</p>

  <p>"Then you actually do love me!" I cried, enraptured. "Tell me the truth,
  Melanie," I implored. "Do not keep me longer in suspense."</p>

  <p>Again her slim fingers gripped my hand, her breast rose and fell slowly,
  and her head bowed as though she would hide her face in modesty.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she whispered, so softly that I could scarce catch her words. "Yes,
  Philip, I&mdash;I love you."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; SECRET SERVICE</h2>

  <p class="first">"MY dear fellow," exclaimed Yermoloff between the whiffs of
  his eternal cigarette, as I was sitting in his room at the Russian Legation
  next morning, "the whole thing is considered an absurdity at Petersburg. An
  Anglo-German alliance is quite out of the question. Your Mr. Chamberlain is
  merely developing the ideas of the principle laid down formerly by the
  Marquess of Macclesfield if he asks England to form an alliance with Germany
  for the purpose of making war upon Russia."</p>

  <p>"England will never declare war," I answered.</p>

  <p>My companion's sphinx-like face relaxed into a dubious smile. I had had
  some unimportant business to transact with him that morning regarding a
  British subject who had been arrested in Liege upon demand from the police in
  Moscow, where he was wanted for fraud, and had made this visit an opportunity
  of learning the latest opinion upon the situation, and endeavouring to
  ascertain whether anything was known of the theft of King Leopold's
  letters.</p>

  <p>"We are well aware," he said, "that your Government has lately made
  advances to Germany, and that these overtures were not brought to a
  successful conclusion because no agreement could be arrived at as to certain
  terms. The policy of England is not only liable to change, but it is also
  hazy, obscure, and never to be relied upon. This is the chief reason that
  England is driven from one quarter to another in her continual search for
  allies; no single English Government can successfully offer itself as an ally
  so long as the other European Powers prefer the victories of peace to those
  of war."</p>

  <p>"But you don't believe that England is desirous of hostilities with your
  country, do you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly. If the German Alliance could have been arranged Russia
  and England would have been at war at this moment. Indeed," he added, looking
  at me rather strangely, "it isn't quite certain that there will be no
  fighting even now."</p>

  <p>"We have but little to fear in that direction," I answered him, taking a
  fresh cigarette from his box and lighting it. He imported his own direct from
  Moscow, so they were always excellent.</p>

  <p>"But there is danger in this strange policy of yours," he said. "Only at
  the last moment, when the smell of powder is in the air, does your shrewd old
  Marquess come to the decision as to which party in the strife it will be to
  its better advantage to form an alliance with. The latest of your diplomatic
  evolutions, my dear Crawford, has, I assure you, created much amusement in
  Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked. This survey of our policy from the Russian point of view
  was very interesting.</p>

  <p>"The traditional Russophobia which seems to have infected you English has
  spread to a remarkable extent," he answered, blowing some rings of smoke from
  his mouth. "But even the London <i>Times</i>, which only lately cast forth
  another of its thunderbolts at the Government at Petersburg, has recognised
  that an Anglo-German Alliance would cost England far more than the advantages
  are worth, or which the Triple Alliance can assure to English
  statecraft."</p>

  <p>"You mean that in order to conclude an alliance with Berlin, England must
  satisfy some heavy demands?" I observed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Germany will never accept England as an ally on any other
  condition than conscription," he answered. "That, of course, your country is
  unable to grant."</p>

  <p>This was a fact which I particularly desired to know. I had purposely led
  the conversation up to this point, in order to ascertain whether Germany's
  secret reply to England, given only the day previous, was known in the
  Russian Legations. It was, and it showed that the Russian secret service had
  been so actively at work at Berlin that the result of the Anglo-German
  negotiations had consequently been telegraphed in cypher to every Russian
  Legation in Europe. Only at midnight had a cypher telegram been received by
  Sir John from Downing-street, giving the negative result of the suggested
  alliance with Germany, yet actually within an hour or two, the Russians, whom
  it was extremely desirous to keep in ignorance, were fully aware of all that
  had transpired. Truly the secret service of the Colossus of the North is
  marvellously organised, and absolutely complete. Daily, even hourly
  sometimes, every Russian Legation abroad receives in cypher from the Ministry
  at Petersburg the direction of the latest political wind, and the movements
  or intentions of the Powers. The British Legations are always well-informed
  in this respect, but Russia, crafty and unscrupulous, is usually ahead.</p>

  <p>"England can perfectly well afford to do without Germany," I said quite
  unconcernedly, for our chat was an informal and friendly one. "The foreign
  Press&mdash;and the diplomatic circle for the matter of that&mdash;are fond
  of talking of England's isolation in the Far East, yet it is curious they
  don't recognise that our occupation of Wei-hai-Wei was effected in concert
  with Japan; our loan was effected in concert with Germany; our railway scheme
  was financed in concert with Belgium; the mineral wealth of Hunan is being
  exploited in concert with Italy; and our policy of the 'open door' is
  admittedly in harmony with that of America. An attempt, therefore, to upset
  our policy as a whole involves Japan, Germany, Italy, and America. Such is
  isolation!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear Crawford," laughed my friend, flicking off his cigarette ash,
  "the rivalry between your country and mine is not ended. In India, for
  example, you trust for defence to a native army of Indian soldiers with a
  stiffening of British troops, while we hold our Asiatic possessions in
  strength, and deprive the population of all arms in order to destroy their
  martial instinct altogether. Our ideal is that of a subject population,
  blindly subservient to the military and civil authority exercised by Russians
  in the name of our Czar; while the dream of you English is to create loyal,
  self-governed and self-defending citizens. The latter seems, of course, the
  nobler ideal, but where an Oriental race is concerned the former is the
  wiser, you may depend upon it."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I said. "You Russians always covet India. Some day you will attack
  us there, I suppose."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders significantly</p>

  <p>"At your Downing-street your Ministry know well enough our intentions in
  Asia. The English are not blind, neither are they fools," he said. "But I
  tell you, Crawford, my dear fellow, that a reaction has set in, and according
  to report which reaches us from London people are beginning to talk of the
  senselessness of those views which aim at concluding an alliance with
  Germany, England's chief competitor for the trade of the world and in
  colonial expansion, while at the same time there is a section of your
  statesmen who openly evince a preference for a <i>rapprochement</i> with
  Russia."</p>

  <p>"With Russia! Never, Yermoloff," I laughed. "The British lion and the
  Russian bear could never pig together."</p>

  <p>Again the dark-faced Secretary of Legation shrugged his shoulders
  expressively.</p>

  <p>"It would have been wiser," he said, "if your Government had approached
  ours a couple of years ago, for it would have placed England on a far safer
  basis than she is at present. At this very moment England is on the very edge
  of a volcano."</p>

  <p>I started. Could it be that at last a copy of that stolen correspondence
  had found its way to Petersburg? Such ominous words plainly showed that my
  friend held knowledge of some catastrophe imminent.</p>

  <p>I, however, affected disregard for his prognostications, and only smiled,
  answering:</p>

  <p>"It is always so, now that you have your alliance with France."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "You English are an unfortunate nation."</p>

  <p>These words of his increased my fear that the blow, so long dreaded at
  Downing-street, had fallen. The unusual activity in Paris, of which we had
  received word, and these declarations by Paul Yermoloff went to show that
  something had transpired to cause undue excitement in the French and Russian
  Legations, and that the storm long brewing over Europe was on the very point
  of bursting.</p>

  <p>For some time longer we chatted, and while I betrayed no sign of anxiety
  at his words, my friend sought with a Russian's self-assertion to impress
  upon me the benefit to be derived from an Anglo-Russian alliance. Then at
  last I left, and took a cab back to the Embassy, having learnt one or two
  things which could not fail to be disconcerting at Downing-street.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be said about the diplomatic methods by which the Russian
  Government accomplish their aggressive purposes, it is impossible not to
  admire, perchance even to envy, their continuity of policy, and the
  unswerving determination with which it is carried out. It is the same in
  every capital. From time to time some check occurs, but as soon as it is
  removed or surmounted, the work of aggrandisement is renewed with as much
  vigour as if it had never come to a halt. The strong point in Russian
  statecraft is that it knows how to wait, as well as when to strike.</p>

  <p>When an hour later I related to Sir John Drummond my conversation with
  Yermoloff he stroked his short grey beard thoughtfully, and after a moment's
  pause said:</p>

  <p>"Let me have the cypher-book. We must wire to Downing-street. Spies have
  again been at work somewhere. Our diplomacy of late seems always to be
  undermined or rendered abortive by our friends at Petersburg."</p>

  <p>I took from the great safe in the corner of the room the flat volume
  containing the cyphers. Only a few weeks ago they had been changed because
  there was a suspicion that the ciphers had leaked out somewhere. Then, when
  Sir John had finished writing the telegram, I sat down, and with the aid of
  the book reduced it to an amazing and puzzling array of numerals.</p>

  <p>The telegraphic despatch was a long, explanatory one, and I, myself, at
  once went forth to the chief post-office to send it off, while Sir John
  ordered the carriage and drove to the Royal Palace to acquaint King Leopold
  of the latest development of affairs consequent upon the mysterious
  theft.</p>

  <p>The loss of the correspondence had placed Sir John, clever and
  distinguished diplomatist that he was, in a very unenviable position, for not
  only was England's honour at stake, but the honour of a friendly sovereign
  and the good-will of a kingdom which, although small in extent, is of
  considerable importance in the political situation. Sir John Drummond, whose
  experience extended over thirty years in nearly every capital in Europe, had
  admitted himself baffled. Of all her Majesty's Ministers at the Foreign
  Courts he was one of the cleverest and shrewdest, able to conduct the most
  delicate piece of diplomacy, and aided by his affable and popular wife, had
  been the means of more than once securing to his country concessions of the
  utmost worth. Indeed, Queen Victoria had few more valued servants in her
  corps of Ambassadors than Sir John Drummond, and the Marquess of Macclesfield
  had often openly expressed his entire confidence in what he was fond of
  playfully calling 'Drummond's sagacity.' Therefore, it was the more serious
  that just at this crisis such a mysterious and marvellous theft should have
  been committed, for undoubtedly King Leopold regarded him as personally
  responsible for the safe keeping of those compromising letters.</p>

  <p>The ways of French and Russian diplomacy were, however, a perfect
  labyrinth of intrigue and mystery, and both countries nowadays depend upon
  their spies, male and female, rather than on the legitimate efforts of their
  Embassies. In the pay of the Foreign Ministers of Russia and France are all
  sorts and conditions of men and women, who will hesitate at nothing in order
  to get at the secrets of those in opposition to them. Truly the life of a
  British ambassador is the reverse of tranquil, surrounded as he is by this
  veritable army of secret agents intent upon combating British diplomacy and
  rendering it abortive, ever striving and struggling to serve their masters by
  prying into every secret in the Embassy archives.</p>

  <p>On my return to the Rue de Spa some half hour later Salmon, the English
  concierge, in his funny cutaway coat and peaked cap, the man so well known in
  the diplomatic circle in Brussels, told me that a telephonic message had just
  arrived from the Palace stating that Sir John wished me to proceed there.
  Therefore, I re-entered the cab, and in fifteen minutes or so I was shown
  through those long handsome corridors of white and gold, my eyes ever on the
  alert to catch a glimpse of Melanie, being at length ushered into the salon
  where my chief was closeted with King Leopold.</p>

  <p>The room was by no means of large dimensions, and yet it presented a
  serious and imposing appearance. The grey-green panels, the dark brown
  embossed leather on the walls, the dark green curtains of the windows, and
  the paintings by Dutch artists several of them in black frames, all combined
  to breathe a spirit of earnestness. One felt that every article in that room
  had its own history. For example, there stood an enormous globe before the
  window on the left, and close by it a tall desk at which his Majesty stood to
  work; near the window on the right was the work-table of the King, covered
  with many personal souvenirs, including an autographed portrait of her
  Majesty Queen Victoria, in a frame set with brilliants. A glance through the
  windows showed the handsome square and well-kept park beyond, while straight
  in front hung Fehrbellin's painting of the great Elector, whose eagle eyes
  seemed to sparkle with his favourite motto, <i>Deus fortitudo mea</i>. A
  couple of well-filled bookcases, the number of maps and plans upon the walls,
  and the littered state of the work-table were ample evidence that to be a
  reigning monarch was no sinecure.</p>

  <p>I had bowed on entering, and King Leopold, with the courtesy which has
  always distinguished him, rose from his chair, a tall, full-bearded, imposing
  figure in grey frock-coat, and returned my bow.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty wished to see you, Crawford," explained Sir John, turning to
  me, and as he uttered the words I saw by the expression upon his countenance
  that the discussion had been an extremely grave one.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the kindly-faced, elderly, plainly-dressed man, sinking back
  into his chair and giving me permission to be seated. "Sir John has told me
  of your conversation at the Russian Legation to-day, and as I understand that
  you are engaged in the secret service of the British Foreign Office anything
  that I may say to you will, of course, remain secret."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty has my pledge of secrecy," I answered. He spoke English
  perfectly, if with just a slight accent.</p>

  <p>"The theft of those letters must, of course, have a most serious effect
  upon your own diplomacy, and not only must it affect me personally, but it
  may result in hostilities against England," observed his Majesty, his dark
  eyes fixed upon me. "I happen to know something of the feeling in Paris and
  in St. Petersburg, and undoubtedly it is the universal opinion that this is
  the opportunity for a declaration of war. The differences between England and
  France regarding Egypt and the Niger question, and between England and Russia
  regarding the Far East, have served to embitter both those Powers against
  England. Well, I am, as you probably know, a stanch supporter of my friend,
  Sir John Drummond, and of the British policy. To the Powers my kingdom is
  supposed to be neutral: but in event of war British troops would no doubt
  find a safe landing in Antwerp and be accorded every facility for reaching
  the Rhine."</p>

  <p>"I thank your Majesty for such an expression of friendship towards
  England, especially in these circumstances," observed Sir John cordially.</p>

  <p>"My friendship for England is because the Marquess of Macclesfield is
  always just, fair, and upright; and further, because the policy of England is
  to protect the weak against the strong," answered the King, leaning back in
  his chair. "This loss, of course, occasions me the greatest anxiety; yet I
  cannot lay any blame upon either the British Government or upon yourself.
  From what you explained the other day the utmost care was taken of the file,
  and it was carried by special messenger with other secret despatches.
  Nevertheless, we have to look events resolutely in the face. The papers have
  been stolen by some person unknown, their contents are evidently known to
  every French and Russian Minister in Europe, and war is at this moment
  imminent."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose that to be so?" inquired Sir John quickly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see how we can convince ourselves of any other result," his
  Majesty replied, his brow furrowed in thought. "France and Russia have
  everything to gain by thus taking England by surprise." Then, turning to me,
  the King said:</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear from your own lips the words used by the Russian
  Secretary of Legation. He is your friend, is he not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Majesty. We are personal friends. I have known him at other
  Embassies for a number of years," and proceeding I gave a detailed account of
  the conversation, almost as I have here written it, while with his eyes fixed
  upon me, he listened with marked attention.</p>

  <p>"And this Yermoloff is rather a smart man, is he not?" his Majesty
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"He has a reputation for shrewdness," I answered. "He was stationed at
  Rome a year ago, and it is said to have been in a great measure due to his
  astuteness that Russia gained the concessions she did over the recent affair
  in Abyssinia."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I remember," he said. "That was a piece of very clever diplomacy,
  purely Russian in all its ingeniousness. Has he ever visited you at the
  Embassy?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Never. He comes to my rooms to smoke sometimes, and now and then on
  business pretexts I go to the Russian Legation."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I quite understand," he smiled. "And you make good use of your time
  when you are there&mdash;eh? Well, this is certainly valuable information
  which you've picked up this morning. Where are your rooms situated?"</p>

  <p>"In the Place Louise," I answered.</p>

  <p>"And you have never had occasion to take the file of correspondence now
  missing home with you, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Never," I answered. "The documents never left the safe at the Legation,
  of which Sir John always holds the master-key, until they were placed in the
  despatch box, sealed and taken to London."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" his Majesty ejaculated. "The thieves evidently outwitted
  you in a manner that its truly amazing."</p>

  <p>"We are very seriously handicapped," observed Sir John, "by not being able
  to discover into whose hands the correspondence has actually fallen."</p>

  <p>"Of course," the King said. "If the robbery were committed for the
  purposes of gain&mdash;and we must suppose that it was&mdash;then I, myself,
  would have been prepared to pay almost any sum to recover them. It is most
  fatal at this juncture that they should have been secured by our
  enemies&mdash;absolutely the worst catastrophe that could have happened to
  England or to Belgium.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately that is only too true," said the Ambassador, sitting
  pensive and puzzled.</p>

  <p>"And there is still another matter, M'sieur Crawford," continued the King,
  rising and opening a drawer in his work-table, and then returning in a moment
  with something in his hand. "You are a member of the secret service,
  therefore, perhaps, you might assist me in a small matter. Do you happen to
  know the original of this photograph?" And he handed me a rather soiled and
  faded carte-de-visite.</p>

  <p>One glance at it was sufficient for identification. I sat with it in my
  hand, breathless, rigid, dumbfounded!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE KING'S MESSAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE picture his Majesty held before my gaze was the
  counterfeit presentment of that woman whom I feared&mdash;the widow of my
  dead friend Gordon.</p>

  <p>It was as though this hateful shadow of the past was thrust upon me in
  order to render my position the more desperate; for as I looked I saw upon
  her pictured lips that smile of defiance which I had known so well long ago
  when she was Judith Kohn.</p>

  <p>"You recognise her," observed the King with satisfaction. "Tell me who,
  and what she is."</p>

  <p>I hesitated, my eyes fixed upon his. In a moment, however, I succeeded in
  recovering my self-possession and said:</p>

  <p>"That woman is well-known to me. Her name was Judith Kohn before she
  married a man named Clunes, who was my friend."</p>

  <p>"Where did you know her?"</p>

  <p>"In Vienna," I answered. "While making certain secret inquiries there I
  first became acquainted with her."</p>

  <p>"And her name is now Clunes? What is his profession?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated. Should I relate the whole truth, or not? A second's
  reflection, however, showed me that such a course would be unwise. Only the
  Marquess of Macclesfield and myself were aware of the truth, and he had
  imposed silence upon me.</p>

  <p>"Her husband," I said, "was engaged in the Treaty Department of our
  Foreign Office in London."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Clunes-Gordon Clunes," exclaimed Sir John, quickly. "Of course I know
  him quite well. He's the head of that Department."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, wondering how this photograph, a copy of which was in
  my possession, could have fallen into the hands of King Leopold.</p>

  <p>"And what is the character of this woman?" continued his Majesty. "You can
  speak quite frankly to me."</p>

  <p>"She's something of a mystery," I responded.</p>

  <p>"A mystery," he echoed. "You appear to look upon her with suspicion."</p>

  <p>"I do," I said.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me the circumstances in which you first met her. Knowledge of
  them may assist me."</p>

  <p>"I think, your Majesty," I answered with politeness, "I think I must
  request you to excuse me replying to that question. As a member of the secret
  service I am under oath not to divulge the result of any inquiry I make to
  any agent of a foreign state."</p>

  <p>His Majesty looked at me quickly with that sharp glance rendered the more
  acute by his aquiline features, perhaps, then replied with a good-humoured
  smile:</p>

  <p>"Of course, M'sieur Crawford, I perfectly understand. I would not wish you
  for one moment to betray any official secret to me. Nevertheless, remember
  that I am friendly to your Queen and country, and that whatever information
  in this matter you can give me without betraying any confidence will be of
  the greatest assistance in my investigations."</p>

  <p>"I think there is no harm in explaining to his Majesty who and what this
  woman is," Sir John remarked.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately I am unable," I answered, rather annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Why?" inquired the Ambassador.</p>

  <p>"Because," I answered, "because the principal fact connected with her
  career is a secret known only to myself and the Marquess of Macclesfield, who
  imposed upon me the strictest silence."</p>

  <p>"The Marquess of Macclesfield!" echoed the King. "Then he knows her?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is a political agent&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have reason to believe so," I responded.</p>

  <p>"Then, if so, why not, in our mutual interests, tell me some minor facts
  regarding her?" urged the King, again glancing at the photograph with a
  puzzled air, and stroking his long beard pensively, a habit of his when deep
  in thought.</p>

  <p>Again, I reflected for a moment, then, in the hope that I might obtain
  knowledge of how this picture had fallen into his hands, I answered:</p>

  <p>"Well, she's a woman who has had, as far as I have been able to gather, a
  very unusual history. She passes as English, but the slight accentuation of
  certain of her words is evidence that she is not. In Paris she was once very
  well known, passing there as the daughter of a very wealthy American lady,
  and becoming engaged to be married to Count Venosta, of the Italian Embassy.
  This, however, was suddenly broken off, by what means remains unknown, and
  she afterwards turned up at Vienna, where I first met her."</p>

  <p>"Was she in society there?" inquired the King eagerly.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "Only in the course of some certain inquiries regarding
  the betrayal of certain secret negotiations between my Embassy and the
  Austro-Hungarian Government did I become aware of her existence. She was
  known then as Judith Kohn, and was the supposed wife if one Oswald Krauss, a
  captain of artillery."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what afterwards?" the King inquired.</p>

  <p>"Krauss was convicted by court-martial of selling plans of three of the
  frontier fortresses to Russian agents and sentenced to imprisonment for life.
  The woman, however, escaped."</p>

  <p>"And she married your friend?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The next I saw of her was several years afterwards when, on visiting
  Gordon Clunes, who had married during my absence in Constantinople, I found
  that she was his wife."</p>

  <p>"Remarkable!" exclaimed his Majesty reflectively. "Very remarkable. It
  would almost appear as though she had some object in marrying an official of
  his grade. It was scarcely wisdom on his part."</p>

  <p>"He was entirely ignorant of her previous adventures," I said. "She passed
  herself off as an Englishwoman living in a remote country town, whose
  education had been gained abroad&mdash;here, in Brussels, I believe she
  said."</p>

  <p>"And he believed her," observed the King, smiling. "A man in love will
  believe anything."</p>

  <p>"But this woman is really a secret agent, you say!" exclaimed Sir John.
  "Surely Clunes knows that? If not, no time should be lost in informing him.
  It is a position most dangerous. Already we have had so many attempts to get
  at the secrets of our diplomacy that we ought to spare no effort to combat
  them."</p>

  <p>"Every precaution possible has already been taken," I answered vaguely.
  Had I not given my promise to the Marquess I should undoubtedly have
  explained all to them.</p>

  <p>"And this man Krauss," the King continued. "Was his offence a very serious
  one?"</p>

  <p>"Extremely," I answered. "His betrayal of military secrets was proved
  beyond doubt, but it was further made plain that the woman acted as the agent
  between her lover and the Russian Government."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed his Majesty, as though a sudden thought had occurred to
  him. "Then the woman is known to the Russian Legation?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," I answered. "I have certain knowledge that De Volborth, the
  Russian Ambassador at Vienna, supplied her with money and arranged for her
  escape over the frontier into Russia after her lover's arrest."</p>

  <p>"But this, you will notice, is a prison photograph," the King remarked,
  turning it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"She had previously fallen into the hands of the Vienna police for
  victimising tradespeople. It was after that that her relations with Krauss
  commenced."</p>

  <p>"I don't remember hearing anything of the betrayal of the plans," he said
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>"The matter was kept a profound secret," I answered. "Only a few high
  officials, and those composing the court-martial were aware of it."</p>

  <p>Too well I remembered all the curious details of that ingenious
  conspiracy, which not only affected the security of the Austrian Empire, but
  also that of England. It was because of my efforts in that sensational
  affair, efforts which cost me so much, and added ten years to my age, that
  the Marquess of Macclesfield reposed confidence in me. Yet it was that woman,
  Judith Kohn, the woman whose faded photograph was now in the hands of King
  Leopold, who could, if she chose, expose and ruin me.</p>

  <p>How heartless she was, I well knew. I had seen more than one illustration
  of it, and knew that at the moment of her revenge she would not spare me.</p>

  <p>"Then you consider her a dangerous political agent?" the King said.</p>

  <p>"Must decidedly," I answered. "At this moment I am most anxious to know
  her whereabouts. Our secret intelligence department in London have kept a
  keen eye upon her for a considerable time, but of late she has evaded us, and
  once more disappeared. Have you knowledge where she is?"</p>

  <p>"No," he responded, glancing sharply at me. "This photograph has come into
  my possession in a somewhat curious manner, and what you have just told me
  increases the mystery considerably. Perhaps it will be as well if I command
  inquiries to be made by our police."</p>

  <p>"If I may presume to suggest to your Majesty," I said quickly, "the best
  course would be to leave the matter entirely in my hands."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he inquired quickly.</p>

  <p>"Because police interference in such a matter must only hinder me in my
  inquiries."</p>

  <p>"But you surely have sufficient on hand just now," the King said.</p>

  <p>"The discovery of Judith Kohn cannot be long delayed," I answered,
  recollecting that sooner or later she must come to me of her own accord.</p>

  <p>"Then, if you desire it, I will not invoke the aid of the police," his
  Majesty said. "Try and find her, and when she is found tell her that I wish
  her to call and see me."</p>

  <p>"To see your Majesty?" I gasped, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Surely it is not so strange a thing that I should desire to ask this
  woman a question. And recollect, Crawford," he added with considerable
  emphasis, "this matter is a pressing one, and of the highest importance. If
  she fears arrest, tell her that the police here shall not touch her as long
  as she obeys my command. At all cost I must see her."</p>

  <p>"Very well, your Majesty, I will endeavour to trace her."</p>

  <p>"It is an entirely private matter," he added. "Not a soul must know of my
  dealings with this woman. But, by the way," he went on, "do you think that
  Yermoloff Gregorovitch, or any of the staff at the Russian Legation here know
  her?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible to tell. She is probably known at the Russian Embassy
  in Paris, and is certainly well-known to De Volborth in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"But you say she is now the wife of one of your colleagues in the Foreign
  Office in London."</p>

  <p>I nodded. I had not told them that Gordon was dead.</p>

  <p>"Then she's probably in London?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite impossible to tell, because&mdash;well," I added, "because
  they have parted."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried the King. "She has possibly found that the profession of
  Russian agent is more lucrative than being wife of a Downing-street official,
  and has returned to the old game."</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "I don't think that, because by reason of a certain
  circumstance within my knowledge the London police are very anxious to find
  her."</p>

  <p>"And may I not know the circumstance to which you refer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I regret," I answered quietly, "that your Majesty may not know that." The
  King drew a long breath, and again stroked his beard pensively.</p>

  <p>"Your profession, of course, needs the most delicate tact, and the
  greatest astuteness and forethought," he said. "A single slip, and exposure
  and disgrace would of course ensue. Against the machinations of England's
  enemies one must need a thousand eyes."</p>

  <p>I smiled and answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If by conveying your Majesty's message to Judith Kohn I can render a
  service I shall do so willingly."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Crawford," the polished monarch answered, with a courtly bow.
  "If you do this you will render me a very great service in a purely private
  matter."</p>

  <p>"I have little doubt that she will soon be found," I responded. "I only
  wish I was as sanguine of discovering into whose hands the missing file of
  correspondence has fallen. The enigma is bewildering."</p>

  <p>"You do not yet appear to have discovered the existence of any secret
  French or Russian agents in Brussels," his Majesty remarked.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," I replied, laughing, for I had not been idle, "four of
  them are my intimate friends. Three are Russian agents, and the fourth is
  employed by Gerard, the French Minister. They believe me to be a cashier in
  the Old English Bank. Against neither of them, however, rests suspicion of
  having tampered with our despatch-box."</p>

  <p>"It's a mystery, a problem absolutely beyond solution," Sir John remarked
  with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"We can only wait," observed the King. "Some day ere long it is to be
  hoped that Crawford will succeed in obtaining a clue, and thereby expose the
  truth. Truly the devices of diplomacy are as ingenious as they are
  astounding. If we could only recover those letters before their existence
  became known, then we should succeed in baffling our enemies."</p>

  <p>"Ah! that is too late, your Majesty," I said. "Already there are evidences
  on every side that copies of the letters have reached the Foreign Ministries
  in Paris and Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the King, "continue to do your utmost, and recollect, too,
  that I have the greatest anxiety to see this woman whom you call Kohn. I must
  see her, for I tell you frankly that facts have come to my knowledge which
  have caused me great uneasiness, and I shall know no rest until I get the
  truth from that woman's lips."</p>

  <p>"The truth you will, I fear, never obtain from the lips of Judith Kohn," I
  observed.</p>

  <p>"But money can buy most things," his Majesty said. "If she is, as you say,
  a political agent, she is certainly open to bribery."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," I answered, adding in a perhaps rather bitter tone,
  "Unscrupulous as she is, she could be no doubt bribed to commit any crime
  from telling an untruth to the taking of a life."</p>

  <p>"All I ask is that you should send her here," his Majesty said in the
  strange hard voice of one desperate. "The rest may be left to me."</p>

  <p>This latest development of the tangled chain of circumstances was most
  extraordinary. It was amazing that King Leopold should desire to see and
  question her, of all women. She hated me. Had she not at the well-remembered
  moment, just before I discovered her husband dead, threatened me with
  exposure and ruin, while I, confident in the knowledge I held of her past,
  promised my silence only in return for hers? Yet, although I had been
  ignorant of it, my power over her had already vanished, for the man who had
  so foolishly married her had already passed to that world which lies beyond
  the human ken. She did not fear me now, for was she not a perfectly free
  agent? Aided by the astute De Volborth, Russian Ambassador at Vienna, she had
  escaped the Austrian police, and there being no extradition for a political
  offence she was quite safe.</p>

  <p>As I sat there in silence while his Majesty discussed the critical
  situation with the Ambassador, I reflected how, having regard to all the
  circumstances, her chief object would undoubtedly be to bring upon me swiftly
  that vengeance which she had openly avowed.</p>

  <p>Yet I had promised to seek her of my own accord and deliver this command
  of the King's, to entrap her, and perhaps to further embitter her against me
  for aught I knew.</p>

  <p>Truly my position was unenviable and my mind full of gravest thoughts.
  England's honour was at stake, the days were passing quickly, and I had,
  alas! discovered nothing, absolutely nothing.</p>

  <p>Each hour was bring us nearer and nearer a terrific and terrible conflict
  with the Powers. War was in the air. In a few days the black storm-cloud
  which for the past three years had hovered over Europe must inevitably burst,
  then lands now fair and smiling would be swept by fire and sword, and
  thousands, perhaps millions of lives would be sacrificed before those
  frightful modern engines of destruction.</p>

  <p>Both King and Ambassador were fully aware of the crisis at hand, but were
  utterly helpless. We could only wait.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A VOICE IN THE NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">A FORTNIGHT of hot, weary, anxious days went by. The month
  of June was now drawing to a close, and everyone was leaving the city for the
  country or the seaside.</p>

  <p>I had met Melanie many times at social functions, and we greeted each
  other with all formality, but only once had we gone cycling together in the
  Bois. If, however, I confess the truth, I must say that we did not then go
  very far on our machines, but spent the whole of the two happy hours sitting
  together beneath the trees on that beautiful green hillside overlooking the
  lake. It was delightful in that bright morning sunlight, cool, fresh, and
  tranquil after the city's turmoil. Each time I saw her her charm for me
  increased. She was so graceful, so unaffected, so tender, so entirely happy
  that I felt assured, notwithstanding all her modest hesitation, that she
  really and truly loved me. She was beautiful, too for did I not see her
  portrait in all sorts of English and foreign illustrated papers, large
  full-page portraits by one of the well-known Paris firms of photographers?
  Even her shabby cycling skirt and straw hat could not disguise the fact that
  she was high-born, for about her face, when she was not actually in
  conversation with me, was that calm oppression of hauteur which every
  Hapsbourg bears, and her swinging gait denoted pride and fearlessness of the
  world.</p>

  <p>But all her words to me were words of happiness and calm affection. True,
  she had only once allowed herself to confess her love to me, yet her actions
  betrayed the truth of my surmise. She loved me, and to me she spoke freely
  and without restraint of her daily life, of her relations, of her visits to
  the Court of her uncle, the German Emperor, to the Czarina at Petersburg, and
  to the popular Empress of Austria at Vienna. Her chatter was always merry,
  sometimes witty, and very frequently amusing. She had a keen sense of humour,
  and was altogether most engaging and bewitching. It was not because of her
  royal birth that I was held spellbound, for on that morning before I had
  known who she was her loveliness and grace attracted me, and now, as each day
  passed, I thought of nothing but her. She was my all, my hope, my very
  life.</p>

  <p>Twice after our last meeting in the Bois I had passed her driving with her
  mother in the fine carriage with servants in the royal livery. As she sat
  back, clad in the latest fashionable fancy, sweet and dainty beneath her
  white silk sunshade, she looked indeed far different from the shabby dusty
  little figure who cycled at such early hours on that broad, level, well kept
  road over which their carriage daily rolled at four o'clock.</p>

  <p>It was close to the Porte de Namur, as I was walking from the Legation to
  my own rooms further up the leafy Boulevard, that the equipage with its
  jingling harness passed me. I looked up quickly, and saw that she had already
  recognised me. Then I raised my hat, and while her proud mother glared at me
  in askance through her lorgnon she bowed stiffly as though I were a
  comparative stranger. But I was not surprised. Her mother was in ignorance of
  our clandestine meetings, and it was not to be supposed that she would reveal
  our secret.</p>

  <p>On the second occasion I met her driving in the Avenue de la Toison d'Or
  accompanied by Princess Clementine, the daughter of King Leopold, and then,
  free from all restraint, she smiled happily at me as she responded to my
  salute. I saw them exchange some words, then both turned and looked back,
  Melanie laughing again at me across her shoulder, an action which etiquette
  rules to be extremely undignified.</p>

  <p>At the Legation matters had assumed a most critical phase. The
  intelligence which reached us from London was of a most disquieting
  character. England's attempted alliance with Germany and its failure, the
  secret of which had been instantly known to Russia and France, had, as we
  expected, produced a very embittered feeling towards us in all the
  Chancelleries of Europe. This, combined with the fact that we had approached
  King Leopold in order that we might if occasion demanded pass through Belgium
  and thus unite our military force with that of Germany, must, we knew,
  inevitably cause war. It was only a matter of weeks, or perhaps indeed days,
  and Europe would be shaken to her foundations by the startling announcement
  that the crisis had actually arrived, and that Russia and France had broken
  off diplomatic negotiations with the British Empire.</p>

  <p>From the actions of these two Powers, who were our most deadly enemies, it
  was apparent that something unusual was taking place, yet all the combined
  efforts of our secret service department in the various capitals failed to
  obtain definite knowledge as to whether the stolen file of the King's
  correspondence had actually fallen into our enemies' hands.</p>

  <p>Some of the intelligence which reached us in cypher from Downing-street
  seemed to point undoubtedly to the fact that the tenor of those letters was
  known, while at other times, from the actions of the Russian Ministers in
  Paris and Berlin, it would seem that at Petersburg they remained still in
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, when Lady Drummond was receiving, I was standing in the
  drawing-room chatting to a couple of ladies well known in Brussels society,
  and one of the footmen whispered that a messenger from Downing-street had
  arrived and required a receipt for his despatches. Excusing myself, I went
  along to my own room and there found Graves in his light dust-coat, his hair
  a trifle ruffled, and the thin blue ribbon of his official badge as Queen's
  foreign service messenger escaping from beneath his cravat. The ribbon with
  medallion bearing the Queen's arms and the silver greyhound suspended is
  always kept concealed beneath the messenger's cravat, and only exhibited when
  necessary to convince some railway official or customs officer of the
  identity of its wearer, for it is a passport more potent than the usual
  formal blue document signed by the Marquess of Macclesfield, and bearing a
  sixpenny stamp.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, gripping his hand, "once more in Brussels&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he responded, handing me the precious box while I signed his
  receipt. "I haven't a moment to spare, for I've also got despatches for
  Petersburg. I took the Vienna express from Ostend here, which gives me just
  an hour in Brussels. I shan't catch the North express if I'm not sharp," he
  added, glancing at his watch. "You've discovered nothing of the theft, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I responded. "I can't imagine how it was done."</p>

  <p>"Neither can I," he answered. "Day by day I try and form some theory, but
  am utterly puzzled. Through all these years I've been carrying despatches
  I've never before lost one, and now, just within two years of gaining my
  pension, I have this misfortune. Somehow, I fear that the Chief has lost
  confidence in me."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired, rather surprised.</p>

  <p>"Because I have more than a suspicion that I'm being shadowed by
  detectives. This makes me believe that the Marquess suspects me of selling
  those papers."</p>

  <p>"Selling them!" I echoed. "My dear Graves, there's not a man in the
  Service who doesn't trust you implicitly. There's no ground for suspicion
  against you whatever. If there were, I should know of them. Those men who are
  shadowing you are not detectives, you may rely upon it. They are more likely
  French or Russian agents who want to get at your despatches again."</p>

  <p>"If they try," he answered determinedly, his mouth set, "if they try, by
  heaven I'll give them a taste of this," and he drew from his hip pocket a
  good-sized serviceable-looking revolver.</p>

  <p>"Where are your despatches for Petersburg?" I asked, noticing he had not a
  second box with him.</p>

  <p>"In my belt. I have permission from the Chief to carry them there. In
  Russia they are safer next to my skin than in any sealed box," and rising he
  re-buttoned his light overcoat and took up his soft felt hat. He was
  muscular, athletic, rather short of stature, dark-bearded and thickly built,
  a typical specimen of a tough Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Well, keep on the alert," I said. "The outlook is growing desperate,
  therefore exercise the greatest care on your journeys."</p>

  <p>"Ah! it's my carelessness that has caused all those strained relations,"
  he said in a dismal tone. "I only blame myself, Mr. Crawford. It is my fault,
  yet how the theft was committed I'm utterly at a loss to know. The box was in
  my possession the whole time."</p>

  <p>"No fault, Graves, rather call it misfortune," I answered. "Some day we
  shall solve the mystery; at least to that end I am daily working. Good-bye,
  and a pleasant journey."</p>

  <p>We shook hands, and as I stood at the window watching, I saw him in his
  cab tearing down the Rue de la Loi to catch the Nord express for St.
  Petersburg.</p>

  <p>His life was, I reflected, one of constant unrest, all his days for years
  having been spent upon the great trunk lines of Europe, until he had become
  an animated Bradshaw, and was on friendly terms with every Customs officer
  and sleeping car conductor. During the time I had been in the Service abroad
  I had constantly met him, for he was the senior messenger, and if remaining
  the night was always the guest of the Ambassador. Dozens of times he had come
  to Constantinople while I had been there, and in addition to his flying
  visits to the various Embassies and Legations in Europe, it was he who very
  frequently made the monthly journey from Downing-street to Teheran. In the
  messenger service the trip to Persia is looked upon as a pleasant change to
  the eternal journeys in Europe for in Teheran there is usually a week or so
  of rest, while the long journey by road is welcome to one jaded by the
  eternal roar and rattle of the rail. Therefore by a Queen's messenger a
  journey to Persia is actually looked upon is a relaxation.</p>

  <p>While standing at the window, however, Sir John, having learnt that
  despatches had arrived, entered hurriedly and opened the box with his key,
  while I obtained the decypher-book from the safe, and began at once to
  transcribe the despatch he handed me.</p>

  <p>He watched over me as I wrote letter after letter, and when I had
  finished, and he learnt its purport, he sank into his chair with his brows
  knit and his eyes fixed in thought.</p>

  <p>The despatch when fully transcribed read as follows:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">No 6A. 3472. Private.</span></p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">From Marquess of Macclesfield to Sir
  John Drummond, Brussels.</span></p>

  <p class="letter">A telegraphic despatch dated midnight 9th instant from
  Berlin states that secret information has been obtained by our Embassy that
  the Russian Ambassador that day called upon the German Minister of Foreign
  Affairs, and had an interview lasting two hours. The Emperor was also
  present. The subject under discussion was the possibility of Russia forming
  an offensive alliance with Germany against England. A Council meeting is to
  be held on the 12th to discuss the matter. During the evening of the 9th the
  Emperor received by special courier an autograph letter from the Czar. You
  are at liberty to inform his Majesty King Leopold of this latest and most
  critical turn of events, and assure him of the continued friendliness and
  goodwill of her Majesty's Government. Further information follows. Cyphers to
  be changed at midday on the 11th instant from 222 to 186.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">End</span>.</p><br>

  <p>"We are now within an ace of war," the Ambassador observed gravely with a
  sigh. "The knowledge of our failure at Berlin has precipitated events in a
  most alarming manner. Never, Crawford, in the whole of my diplomatic career
  has England been nearer war than she is at this moment."</p>

  <p>"And our lost despatches," I observed. "What of them?"</p>

  <p>"I fear to think," he answered gloomily. "By the uncertainty of into whose
  possession those letters have fallen my hands are tied. I can do
  nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing. It is strange that the secret service has
  failed to discover what is known of them, or into whose hands they have
  passed."</p>

  <p>"The theft was one of the most ingenious ever perpetrated by our enemies,"
  I remarked, "and no doubt those who could steal so cleverly also took every
  precaution to baffle us in our effort to trace them. But tell me," I added,
  "has the King mentioned to you the reason he desires to have an interview
  with that woman Judith Kohn?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered my chief. "I put to him a very pointed question, but he
  merely remarked that the matter was a private one. It is fortunate that we
  are upon such good terms with his Majesty, or the loss of his letters might
  have placed us in a most invidious position."</p>

  <p>"But he knows that notwithstanding the neutrality he is compelled to
  preserve, the best friend and protector of his kingdom is ourselves," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, quite right," Sir John replied. "But we never know,
  Crawford, what advantages France, or even Russia, may hold out to him. They
  can offer tempting baits to the unwary, remember. Recollect the action of
  Russian diplomacy in Constantinople, and how Zouroff twists the Sultan round
  his finger."</p>

  <p>I nodded, for I well knew the marvellous astuteness and cunning of the
  Russian Ambassador to the Porte.</p>

  <p>"Then you consider our position here is not so safe as it really
  appears?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he responded darkly. "If war were declared against
  England to-morrow, Belgium would be forced on the side of Germany or France,
  and our open door to Europe would be closed. The King would be compelled to
  accede, in order to save his crown and kingdom."</p>

  <p>"But the Treaty of Neutrality?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador snapped his fingers impatiently.</p>

  <p>"In case of a European war&mdash;and it means that and nothing
  else&mdash;treaties such as those would be set at nought. A little
  skirmishing between Uhlans and Chasseurs along the Meuse Valley, and the
  treaty would vanish into air. The King is a clever politician himself, and he
  knows that quite well. We should have no doubt secured on agreement with
  Belgium, had it not been for the Minister de Boek's opposition. He is, as you
  know, in favour of an alliance with France."</p>

  <p>"But he has been succeeded now," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but unfortunately his successor holds exactly the same views.
  Brussels is always modelling itself upon Parisian models and of course the
  mind of Belgians naturally turns to thoughts of France as their
  protector."</p>

  <p>Then he rose wearily, and after filing the despatch we went together back
  into the drawing-room, where Lady Drummond was entertaining her well dressed
  crowd of chattering guests with that courtesy which characterised her as a
  polished and popular hostess.</p>

  <p>There is a strange fate that sometimes directs our actions and leads us
  involuntarily to perform things we have no intention of doing. That same
  evening I accompanied Giffard and a friend of his, a Belgian deputy, to the
  theatre, and at the conclusion of the performance, it being a bright star-lit
  night I set out to walk to my rooms alone, refusing their invitation to go
  round to the English Club, as I felt a slight touch of fever on me. My head
  ached violently, but the cool air revived me, and I was walking along the
  wide dark avenue of trees which forms the Boulevard du Regent, one of the
  best residential quarters of the city, when suddenly in the obscurity before
  me I thought I distinguished something white fluttering.</p>

  <p>It was past midnight, most of the gas-lamps had been extinguished and only
  a solitary light remained burning here and there; hence the darkness,
  increased by the foliage of the trees, obscured everything. All was still, no
  sound broke the quiet, save the rustling of the tree-tops as a gust of cool
  night-wind swept across them.</p>

  <p>Yet I felt confident that I had seen something before me, and that it had
  instantly disappeared.</p>

  <p>I had heard and read in the papers of belated foot-passengers being
  waylaid there; hence I resolved to keep my wits about me, and in order to
  watch, slipped quickly behind a tree-trunk and waited, my eyes fixed upon the
  spot where that flash of white had been revealed.</p>

  <p>There was still no sound. In that great wide thoroughfare, with its thick
  avenue, the foot-passenger was entirely alone at night. Most people, it was
  true, took the footpath along by the houses lining the Boulevard and I knew
  that I had acted foolishly in walking where I did. Footpads are plentiful in
  the Brussels boulevards, and at night the police surveillance is not all that
  it might be.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, however, I heard a quick, sharp cry&mdash;the cry of a woman in
  pain&mdash;and there, sure enough, saw again the same flash of white. There
  were sounds of scuffling, then silence again, broken only by a low groan and
  a word of reproach.</p>

  <p>I hesitated in wonder.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden, a shriek rang out upon the night air, and a woman's voice
  cried in French:</p>

  <p>"Ah, no! Let me go! Spare my life, and you shall have what you ask.
  You&mdash;you'll kill me, you coward! Let me go. Ah! you are hurting me!
  You&mdash;&mdash;" and there was a strange horrible sound, as though the
  woman was trying to speak, but the terrible pressure upon her throat only
  reduced her words to inarticulate sounds.</p>

  <p>In an instant I dashed forward, reaching in a few paces two struggling
  figures, a man and a woman. Without a moment's hesitation, and entirely
  heedless of the consequences, I flung myself upon the man, a well-dressed
  follow in silk hat and frock coat, and seizing his arms dragged his sinewy
  murderous hands from the woman's throat, for he had clutched her in a fierce
  grip, and was endeavouring to strangle her.</p>

  <p>She shook herself free and drew back with a cry of relief; but in that
  instant, almost before I was aware of it, her assailant had closed with me
  with a low cry of suppressed rage. So suddenly, indeed, did he spring upon me
  that I was nearly borne to earth; but in desperation I wrestled with him,
  managing to keep my feet, and by strategy learnt in my college days to gain a
  slight advantage.</p>

  <p>Upon my cheek I could feel his hot breath as he panted with exertion, and
  could hear the sound of his teeth grinding hard in his desperate effort to
  cast me off, for I had now got him in my grasp. In swaying from side to side
  in that dark avenue we, however, suddenly emerged into a ray of faint light
  shed by one of the few street lamps which remained alight, and then, for the
  first time I caught a glimpse of his features. He was fair, with a blonde
  moustache, but his slightly pock-marked face was distorted by a fierce
  unbridled anger.</p>

  <p>To the woman at the same instant were my own features apparently revealed,
  for with a wild exclamation she breathlessly ejaculated my name. That voice
  sounded familiar in my ears and startled me. I drew back amazed and peered at
  the white-robed figure before me.</p>

  <p>The face of that man I had within my grasp was to me the most hateful and
  detestable in all the world. This sudden encounter caused me to start in
  amazement, and in an instant he had twisted himself free and stood glaring at
  me, as though ready to tear me limb from limb.</p>

  <p>The woman who had been thus cowardly attacked was none other than Melanie,
  my beloved, and her assailant that degraded spy and traitor whom I had once
  hunted down and brought to punishment, the ex-captain of artillery, Oswald
  Krauss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; MELANIE'S FEAR</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU! Melanie!" I gasped bewildered, turning to her. "Tell
  me what has happened. Why has this man attacked you?"</p>

  <p>Ere, however, she could reply Krauss, with an imprecation escaping him,
  had slunk away and was lost in the darkness among the trees. I started
  forward to follow him and demand an explanation, for my blood was up now that
  I recognised he had attacked the woman I loved, but she called me back in an
  authoritative voice, and in a moment I was again at her side.</p>

  <p>Breathless and panting she was greatly agitated, a terrible anxiety
  apparently consuming her, therefore I suggested that she should walk with me
  to my rooms only a short distance off, and there rest until she had recovered
  sufficiently to return to the Palace. A little brandy would revive her, for
  the man had evidently made a most desperate and perhaps preconcerted attempt
  to take her life.</p>

  <p>This midnight discovery was certainly a most remarkable and startling one.
  Few in Brussels would have dreamed that the Princess Melanie of Hapsbourg,
  the beautiful girl whom everyone admired, would be wandering beneath the
  trees in the Boulevard after midnight, and certainly this attempt to take her
  life was a most sensational incident entirely unaccountable. Only one man on
  earth I hated and detested, and it was this villainous spy whom I believed
  was still serving his well-deserved life sentence in the State prison at
  Budapesth. The knowledge of his liberty had caused me to stand before him
  dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>On one occasion, on that grey morning when he stood in the barrack-square
  with his hands manacled while his decorations and the facings of his uniform
  were torn from his coat and his sword broken before the assembled troops, he
  had vowed to take my life. That was the last time I had seen him, for he had
  been marched away to prison an a spy and a traitor, while the woman Judith
  Kohn, to whom his degradation was in a great measure due, had, with the
  assistance of the Russian Embassy, fled across the frontier and escaped. Yet
  I remembered well, as though it were but yesterday, that evil look in his
  eyes as he swore to kill me because I had brought about his exposure by
  intercepting certain plans which he had offered for sale. Mine was, I
  confess, a delicate piece of espionage, but it was in the interests of my own
  dear England, and in order to further the success of the diplomacy of my
  chief.</p>

  <p>Now, at this critical moment of the European outlook, we had met once
  more, and our encounter had certainly been in most extraordinary
  circumstances. In my ears the shrill cry of my beloved still sounded, and I
  regretted that I had not detained him. True, he had escaped into the
  darkness, but without doubt our recognition had been mutual.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Philip," she managed to gasp. "It is fortunate you
  were near, or&mdash;or he would, I believe, have strangled me. A little
  brandy would do me good. I feel so weak and faint."</p>

  <p>"Then come," I said. "Let's get away, for the police may have been alarmed
  by your cry," and taking her arm tenderly I managed to lead her as far as the
  Place Louise, where we ascended to my little flat, a rather pleasant place in
  daytime, overlooking as it did the gayest and liveliest spot in all
  Brussels.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Barnes, my English manservant, had retired to bed, as he did
  invariably at eleven if I were not in, therefore we were alone, and on
  gaining the sitting-room she staggered back into my arm chair exhausted, her
  beautiful face as pale as death, her lips trembling, her dark eyes fixed
  before her with a strange haggard look I had never before seen in them.
  Indeed she had walked with me as one dazed and in a dream, and not until I
  had made her swallow a stiff glass of cognac did she revive and become fully
  cognisant of things around her.</p>

  <p>I saw that the white silk gown she wore, an extremely handsome dress cut a
  trifle decollete and trimmed with pearls, was rent and torn, while her dark
  hair had been sadly disarranged in the desperate struggle. There were marks,
  too, upon her white throat, dark livid marks where the hands of her assailant
  had gripped her in his dastardly effort to crush the life from her.</p>

  <p>I asked whether she had not a cape, or some covering for her shoulders,
  thinking it strange that she should go forth into the night air without
  protection, but she mechanically replied that she supposed it had fallen off
  in the Boulevard.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Melanie, what occurred," I asked at last, standing behind her
  chair, bending over her and holding her hand tenderly. Jewels, beautiful
  rubies, emeralds, and diamonds, sparkled on her slim white fingers, while
  upon her wrist was an antique bracelet, a broad band of gold with an
  inscription in raised Roman characters, "Vita ludus et scena est." It was a
  fine ornament which, as I afterwards learnt, had been discovered during some
  excavations near the old town of Treves, once a Roman stronghold.</p>

  <p>To my question she remained dumb. Her half bare chest rose and fell in a
  heavy sigh, and her eyes were turned to mine with a strange fixed look which
  alarmed me. Her hand trembled, then a shudder ran through her.</p>

  <p>"You are cold," I said, and obtaining a flannel tennis coat of my own I
  placed it about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>She thanked me in a low weak voice, then, resting her head upon the
  cushion I placed for her, she closed her eyes. I saw that she was exhausted,
  and further, that the dark marks upon her throat, where the man's murderous
  fingers had grasped her, were gradually assuming a deeper hue.</p>

  <p>For some time I stood beside her, still holding her hand, but it seemed as
  though she had dropped off to sleep, therefore I crept away and obtained a
  whisky and soda myself, for truth to tell I had been unnerved by this
  unexpected encounter.</p>

  <p>Oswald Krauss, judging from his dress, was prospering. He was certainly no
  common footpad. Melanie's words when he had seized her in his terrible
  paroxysm of anger were very strange and sounded as though they were both well
  known to each other.</p>

  <p>She had promised to accede to his demands on condition that he spared her.
  What, I wondered, did he seek of her? It was indeed an extraordinary fact to
  discover the Princess Melanie of Hapsbourg walking alone in the early hours
  of the morning with a man whose mean, despicable crime had brought upon him a
  well-deserved life-sentence. Again, how he had escaped was a mystery. The
  Austrian Government are not given to releasing prisoners condemned for
  treason. That man had broken his oath to his Emperor and betrayed his country
  in a manner so ingenious as to be almost incredible, yet I found him here, in
  Brussels, a free agent, endeavouring to obtain by threats something which my
  beloved refused to grant.</p>

  <p>What could it be, I wondered? Could he really be the mysterious lover whom
  she was in the habit of meeting, the man spoken of by Paul Yermoloff?</p>

  <p>I sat opposite her, watching her as she slept, knowing that when she awoke
  she would be calmer and more collected. Her absence from the palace would, I
  feared, be noted, therefore, although anxious to learn the truth of this
  mysterious attack, I was also eager that she should return. Probably her maid
  was in the secret of these night excursions of hers just as she knew of her
  early morning cycling.</p>

  <p>At last, perhaps after about half-an-hour, she again opened her eyes, and
  sitting up glanced around her wonderingly.</p>

  <p>I was beside her, on my knees in an instant</p>

  <p>"I hope you feel better, Melanie," I said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered weakly. "At first, do you know, I wondered what place
  this was. But now I remember all. I&mdash;I am with you!" And she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, bending and kissing her hand. "It was extremely fortunate
  that I chanced to be near. But tell me," I added. "What do you know of that
  man? Was he a stranger to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, sighing deeply. "He is, alas! no stranger."</p>

  <p>"But why did he make such a desperate attempt upon you?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. Her fingers closed tightly upon mine.</p>

  <p>"Because I would not comply with his demand."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," I demanded. "What is the nature of your relations with
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I hate him," she cried in desperation. "I hate and detest him!"</p>

  <p>"Am I correct in supposing that this man is your lover, and that you have
  met him time after time in the Boulevard, or in the dark avenues of the
  Park?"</p>

  <p>"I have met him many times. I have met him because I have been forced to
  do so," she answered in desperation.</p>

  <p>"And he is your lover!" I said harshly.</p>

  <p>"No, No, Philip," she cried protestingly. "I swear he is not. Lover? Why I
  detest the sight of him."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She was silent. I saw by the twitching of the muscles of her face how
  agitated she had become. This allegation of mine had brought a dark,
  determined look upon her countenance, while on my part my discovery had
  aroused within me a natural jealousy. The whisperings I had heard, alleging
  that the Princess Melanie had a secret lover, were evidently based upon fact,
  for a woman does not steal out and meet a man at night at risk of detection
  and exposure unless there is some very strong incentive.</p>

  <p>"You do not answer my question," I said, in calmer tone.</p>

  <p>"I hate him because of all the past," she responded at length, after some
  further hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Is its recollection so very bitter then?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Alas, yes," she sighed; then fixing her dark, tearful eyes upon mine, she
  added hoarsely: "It is so bitter and hateful, Philip, that sometimes I regret
  that I did not die long ago."</p>

  <p>"Come," I said. "You must not speak so gloomily. Tell me what has occurred
  between you to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no," she answered quickly. "I cannot."</p>

  <p>"But I love you, Melanie," I protested earnestly. "You have told me, too,
  that I have a place in your heart. Cannot you, therefore, trust me with your
  secret?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I dare not."</p>

  <p>"Then you are in fear of him?" I said. "You told me that you were in dread
  of that man who watched us on the night of the State Ball."</p>

  <p>"It is the truth. Fear of them both holds me in silence," she replied.</p>

  <p>"But is it wise to wander the Boulevards at night?" I queried.</p>

  <p>"I have met that man only because he compelled me," she answered. "Ah, you
  do not know, you can never know what I have suffered, Philip, or you would
  not speak thus."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, do you not place faith in me and explain? I might assist you.
  Your position does not allow you the freedom which others have, therefore why
  not let me be your confidant and friend? Did you not tell me only the other
  day that you might perhaps require my help? Surely you require some
  assistance when, with my own eyes, I have witnessed this dastardly attempt
  upon you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she shuddered. "I believe that he would have killed me."</p>

  <p>"But what reason has he in acting thus?" I inquired. "What does he want of
  you?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. Her brows contracted for a moment in thought, then she
  answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am in possession of a secret which he is anxious to learn. I refused to
  divulge it, and in order to wring it from me he attempted to strangle
  me."</p>

  <p>"A secret?" I repeated, puzzled. "Has it anything to do with that man's
  past?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "But what do you know regarding his past? Are you
  acquainted with him?"</p>

  <p>"I know him too well," I replied, in a hard voice. "His name is Oswald
  Krauss, a native of Vienna, and he is an ex-captain of artillery."</p>

  <p>She bowed her head in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"And what else," she asked, in a low mechanical tone.</p>

  <p>"For the rest," I said, "he was discovered in the act of selling to a
  Russian agent in Budapesth detailed plans of three of the principal frontier
  fortresses, arrested, and condemned by court-martial to imprisonment for life
  as a spy and a traitor."</p>

  <p>"And how are you aware of all this?" she inquired, her eyes turned upon me
  in blank surprise.</p>

  <p>"Because that man was first successful in obtaining knowledge of certain
  of our diplomatic secrets which he endeavoured to sell to his employers, the
  Russian Government, and was only prevented by a discovery which I myself
  made. Then, fearing least he should make a second attempt, I kept watch upon
  him, and found that not only did he seek to sell England's secrets to her
  enemies, but was also offering the plans of his own country's defences."</p>

  <p>"It was you who discovered that?" she gasped, her face pale in an
  instant.</p>

  <p>"I placed my discovery before the Austrian Minister for War, with the
  result that the spy was arrested and his papers seized. The latter
  conclusively proved his guilt, and after the trial he was degraded in the
  Barrack Square in Budapesth. The real reason of this degradation was,
  however, never allowed to leak out to the public. Only the members of the
  court-martial and a few high officials were aware of the truth. The Russian
  Ambassador was too deeply implicated in the affair, and Austria could not
  afford to give offence to her powerful neighbour."</p>

  <p>"And you were actually the man who brought him to justice!" she cried in a
  strange voice, as one utterly amazed.</p>

  <p>"He is a man of marvellous ingenuity," I answered, "and he used a woman
  named Kohn as his go-between in his dealings with Russia."</p>

  <p>"Kohn!" she gasped, with wide-open eyes. "Surely you must be
  mistaken!"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "I tell you the truth without any attempt at
  concealment. Indeed, the woman was as crafty and ingenious as he himself. She
  only escaped with the aid of the Russian Embassy, who knew that had she been
  arrested she would make some very ugly and compromising statements."</p>

  <p>"I really can't believe it," she said in a tone of wonderment. "I was
  acquainted with him before his arrest and imprisonment, but knew nothing of
  her."</p>

  <p>"It was scarcely likely that he would tell you," I observed, still feeling
  convinced that this escaped spy was her lover.</p>

  <p>"If what you say is true, then the mystery is increased," she said
  reflectively, as though speaking to herself. "Still, it shows the depth of
  his cunning, and the fierceness of the revenge he seeks to bring upon
  you."</p>

  <p>"Upon me?" I repeated. "What has he told you?"</p>

  <p>"He has told me nothing," she answered. "He has never mentioned your name,
  but he has vowed to me a vengeance terrible and complete against the person
  who exposed him to the Minister of War. I now see how all his demands were
  directed towards one object to gain that satisfaction which, it seems, he is
  determined to gain&mdash;namely, to encompass your ruin."</p>

  <p>"He threatened me long ago, at the moment when the court-martial
  pronounced sentence upon him; but I have no fear," I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! be cautious!" she cried concernedly. "Be cautious, for my sake,
  Philip. Once, I now remember, he told me that if he could not affect your
  downfall and disgrace he was acquainted with one who could. To whom did he
  refer?"</p>

  <p>The truth flashed through my mind in an instant. He referred to
  Judith&mdash;that crafty blue-eyed woman who held my future in her hands.
  Next moment, however, I recovered myself, and answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"More idle brag. I take no heed of swaggering talk such as this. He was
  always a braggart."</p>

  <p>"But now, Philip, he is absolutely desperate," she exclaimed. "If he would
  attack me in the manner he has done to-night he will not hesitate to take
  your life, if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Why has he escaped from prison?" I inquired. "Tell me. You, of course,
  know the truth."</p>

  <p>"He was released nearly eight months ago, and conducted to the frontier by
  order of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"By order of the Emperor?" I echoed, puzzled. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I interceded for him personally, and secured his release," she said
  simply.</p>

  <p>"You," I cried. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"There was a reason," she answered, "a very strong reason, but I cannot
  tell you. It is a secret."</p>

  <p>"Strange," I said, utterly confounded. "Strange that the Emperor should
  exert his prerogative over the finding of the court-martial and release one
  detected in such a flagrant act of treason. Did you actually plead personally
  for him?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"For what reason?" I demanded eagerly. "Tell me. There is more mystery in
  this than I have dreamed."</p>

  <p>"No, Philip," she answered in a low voice, shaking her head. "I can never
  tell you, of all men&mdash;never."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; AT THE BRITISH LEGATION</h2>

  <p class="first">MELANIE'S mysterious friendship for this unprincipled
  outcast was extremely puzzling. Although she did not speak of him as though
  he were her lover, yet it was extraordinary that she should have used her
  influence with her uncle, the Emperor Francis Joseph, to secure his
  release.</p>

  <p>As she sat there talking to me, a wan figure in her dead-white dress, with
  my tennis coat about her shoulders, she presented the appearance of one
  oppressed by some knowledge which she dared not to divulge. In her pale,
  agitated face was a strange look as if, although haunted by some
  inexpressible fear, she was nevertheless seeking to preserve her
  self-control.</p>

  <p>She was now as calm as she had ever been, for her outward agitation had
  passed, and her brief sleep had refreshed her. I became more and more
  impressed, however, that the real reason of her solicitude for this man
  Krauss was because she loved him. Nevertheless, I could not fail to notice
  that in her eyes as she gazed upon me was that genuine love-look which can
  never be feigned, that glance which is only seen in the faces of those in
  whose hearts burns the unquenchable fire of true love.</p>

  <p>Yet here was a strange character, and the more I sought to analyse it the
  more complex it appeared. That she was honest, open-hearted and unassuming I
  well knew. Never once during our friendship had she ever sought to impress me
  with a sense of her superior birth, but rather to place herself upon even a
  lower level than myself. How strange it was, I often thought, that while the
  world unanimously declared her to be possessed of that unbending dignity and
  pride characteristic of the Hapsbourgs, she was towards me sweet, affable,
  and purely womanly.</p>

  <p>Only when I approached the subject of her secret did she shrink from me,
  and her attitude was&mdash;I could not disguise it&mdash;an attitude of
  guilt. My curiosity had been whetted by this strange incident, and I strove
  by every means to ascertain from her the reason why Krauss had attacked
  her.</p>

  <p>"Was it money he sought of you?" I asked, presently.</p>

  <p>But she shook her head, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No. It was not money he wanted." Then she added quickly, "Philip, refrain
  from questioning me further. I can never give you explanation."</p>

  <p>"Not although you love me?" I asked, looking full into her great dark
  eyes, so full of affection and tenderness.</p>

  <p>Her gaze met mine boldly, unflinchingly, but she responded in a low firm
  voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No. Although I do love you, Philip, I nevertheless can tell you
  nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing!"</p>

  <p>I sighed in disappointment. It was apparently useless to cross-question
  her further, and I feared to annoy her.</p>

  <p>I urged her to confide in me, and for the thousandth time repeated my
  declarations of affection. She heard me, with a sweet smile of contentment
  upon her lips. It was a strange wooing in the silence of the night, and so
  affected she became that I felt more than ever confident that ours was not a
  mere flirtation, but a genuinely reciprocated affection.</p>

  <p>At last she rose to go, and as we stood together I placed my arm about her
  neck slowly and tenderly until her head gently rested upon my shoulder. She
  did not resist. The look supreme of contentment and happiness upon her fair
  face told me that she was mine, therefore I bent and for the first time
  tenderly kissed her lips.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she murmured. "I do love you, Philip. I, alas! love you. Why, I
  cannot tell. It is fate that has thus cast us together, and I shall love you
  always&mdash;always!"</p>

  <p>"Your words bring joy and gladness to my heart, dearest," I answered,
  again kissing her, and then for the first time she raised her head until her
  lips met mine in a passionate caress which made my head reel, so enraptured I
  became.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she whispered softly, in a calm voice, looking at me gravely
  though tears stood in her eyes, "take this and wear it always as a souvenir
  of the great service you have rendered me to-night. You saved my life!"</p>

  <p>And she drew from her finger a beautiful ring set with a single ruby, and
  taking my hand gently placed it upon my little finger, then raising it to her
  lips imprinted a kiss upon it.</p>

  <p>"I will wear it always," I answered fervently. "It will serve to remind me
  of you when we are apart&mdash;not that I shall require any aid to
  memory&mdash;but you have kissed it, you have given it your benediction, and
  it shall never leave my finger."</p>

  <p>"When you look upon it remember, Philip, that whatever may occur there is
  but one man on earth that I have ever loved, and that man is yourself."</p>

  <p>I clasped her to my breast, and her hot tears of joy rained fast as she
  buried her head again upon my shoulder, while I in that ecstatic enchantment
  which knowledge of a reciprocated love can alone impart, kissed her hair and
  soothed her with those fervent passionate phrases which rose to my lips. What
  I said I know not, nor have I any knowledge of how long we stood there locked
  in each other's arms; all I remember is that the grey dawn stealing through
  the drawn curtains caused us both to suddenly recollect that it was time that
  she returned.</p>

  <p>Then, after many final words, both of us equally loth to part, we went
  down into the Boulevard again, she with my tennis coat still about her
  shoulders. At that hour, just as dawn was breaking, the wind swept chilly
  down the great leafy avenue, but fearless of footpads, for it was now light,
  we walked together along the leafy allee until we reached the Place du Trone,
  where the great stone lions guard the entrance to the gardens of the Royal
  Palace, then skirting the walls for a long distance we turned at length into
  the Place des Palais, where the great grey facade of the royal residence
  faces the Park. Together we proceeded to the opposite end of that building,
  when she suddenly halted at a side-door before which a sentinel in bearskin
  shako and overcoat was pacing.</p>

  <p>The instant the man recognised her he started and stood at attention,
  exclaiming: "Pass, your Royal Highness."</p>

  <p>She turned and shook my hand, saying in English in a
  half-whisper&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Philip. Think of me always, as I think always of you."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," I whispered, bending low over her hand. "Good-bye,
  Melanie&mdash;my love, my life."</p>

  <p>And in an instant her rustling skirts swept past me, and she had passed
  through the door which closed after her.</p>

  <p>On my return to my rooms I sat alone for a long time pondering deeply, and
  calmly viewing the situation. Try how I could to conceal the fact, it
  nevertheless remained glaringly plain that I had by loving Melanie, departed
  from the first tenets of my religion as a diplomatist, besides having
  neglected to a great degree the special duty for which I had been nominated
  to Brussels.</p>

  <p>Had not the Marquess of Macclesfield, the greatest diplomatist of his age,
  told me plainly the folly of allowing myself to be drawn into any serious
  affair of the heart. The more I reflected, the more impossible seemed our
  happiness.</p>

  <p>Yet upon my finger was that magnificent ruby, her pledge of affection,
  which I examined and admired in the bright light of early morn, while still
  in my ears rang those impassioned words of hers: "Philip, I shall love you
  always."</p>

  <p>That same day, at noon, I went as usual down to the Legation, and was
  occupied with some clerical work until nearly three, when Sir John came in
  hurriedly, having had a long interview with the Minister for Foreign affairs
  regarding a question relative to the Congo boundary.</p>

  <p>"I must send a special despatch to London," he said, placing down his hat,
  and seating himself at once at his table to write.</p>

  <p>Then, when he had finished, I took from the safe the cypher book and
  reduced what he had written to an amazing array of figures upon the fresh
  combination of numbers as announced in the despatch Graves had brought. There
  was nothing startling in it, but it was imperative that the British Cabinet
  should give its decision at once, in order to forestall German
  encroachments.</p>

  <p>Having concluded, I suddenly recollected that we had no despatch box, save
  the one from which the King's correspondence had been stolen, a fact which I
  announced to the Ambassador.</p>

  <p>"Then we must use that," he answered. "Giffard wants to go for three days'
  leave in London, so he will take it."</p>

  <p>I took the box from the locked cupboard wherein I had put it on its return
  to us, and placed it on the table, a small case covered with crimson leather
  which bore the chipped wax of many previous seals. Well worn and much
  battered by continual journeys between Downing-street and the various
  capitals of Europe, it had in its time contained many remarkable secrets of
  State. It was locked, therefore Sir John took out his key and inserted it.
  But it would not turn. Again he tried, but with no better result. The wards
  of the lock seemed jammed.</p>

  <p>I took the key and endeavoured to open it, but on examination detected for
  the first time something unusual in the appearance of the key-hole. It was
  larger, and of different shape to the small curved slit in the Foreign Office
  despatch-boxes. This key-hole was, however, the key-hole of an ordinary lock,
  and although the key held at Downing-street had once opened it, our key now
  refused to perform a similar work.</p>

  <p>At once I pointed out my discovery to Sir John, and then a few moments
  later when we got the box open, we both made a very startling discovery.</p>

  <p>The box was only an ingenious imitation of those well-known caskets which
  are sent out from Downing-street. It was of the same size, the leather was of
  the same shade, a soiled and discoloured red, but on closer examination we
  saw that all the seals had been carefully made and chipped away in order to
  give it an appearance of being well-worn, and even the sunk brass handle had
  been discoloured by acids, so as to give an appearance of long usage. By the
  lock, which proved to be quite a common one, and the fact that it was lined
  inside with imitation leather instead of real morocco, it was proved
  conclusively that it was only a cleverly contrived duplicate.</p>

  <p>Instantly the truth was plain. The box containing King Leopold's secret
  correspondence had been changed for this, and so cleverly had the exchange
  been made, and the bogus box prepared, that neither Graves nor ourselves had,
  until that moment, discovered the ingenious fraud.</p>

  <p>"This only shows how determined were the thieves to obtain possession of
  the papers," observed Sir John, thoughtfully. "The manner in which this
  despatch-box has been prepared is proof positive that the theft had long been
  premeditated. It was done by no ordinary thief&mdash;of that we may rest
  assured."</p>

  <p>"The facsimile of the despatch box is marvellous!" I said. "Look at the
  seals. They bear every resemblance to those on a genuine box. All is genuine
  save the lock and the lining."</p>

  <p>"The lock," observed the Ambassador, "must have been of so ordinary a
  character that the key at the Foreign Office shot back the bolt when they
  opened it. The ingenuity of those scoundrelly spies is simply amazing."</p>

  <p>And then he stood regarding the box in deep thoughtful silence.</p>

  <p>This was certainly a curious discovery, but it at least cleared up the
  mystery of how the file of correspondence had been stolen. The seals upon
  that bogus box were, curiously enough, impressed by the private seal which
  had apparently been manufactured in exact imitation of the one actually in
  use, every care being taken to render the exterior identical with the one
  carried by the Queen's Messenger. We certainly were now aware of the means
  adopted by the thief or thieves, but the crucial question was as to who had
  so carefully planned and committed the theft which had placed England in such
  jeopardy.</p>

  <p>On the following night I accompanied Sir John, Lady Drummond, and Frank
  Hamilton to a reception by the Count of Flanders at his Palace in the Rue de
  la Regence. It was a very brilliant affair, a veritable phantasmagoria of
  striking uniforms and tasteful toilettes, and I strolled through the
  heavily-gilded rooms eager, of course, to catch a glance of Melanie. Their
  Majesties were coming, and it was certain that she would accompany her friend
  the young Princess Clementine. Therefore I waited anxiously, for hedged in by
  royal divinity as she was I had not been able to catch a single glimpse of
  her since that grey hour of dawn when she had given me that whispered
  assurance of her love as she disappeared into the Palace. Hourly I had
  thought of her. Upon my mantel-shelf was a fine panel photograph of her which
  I had bought in the Montaigne de la Cour, and often when I looked at it her
  beautiful face seemed to shine down upon me with an expression of purity,
  tenderness and love. More than once, when one or other of my diplomatic
  friends looked in for a whisky and soda, a beverage unobtainable at the
  average cafe, I had been compelled to remove it to hide my idol lest
  suspicion might be roused of the true state of affairs. Attaches and
  secretaries are particularly sharp to detect any affairs of the heart, for
  they are usually gallants themselves, and their knowledge of the prettiest
  women in the city is generally encyclopaedic. Therefore I was compelled to
  act with the greatest discretion keeping my secret locked within my heart
  lest I might betray myself and afford food for gossips. She had impressed
  upon me the virtue of silence, and her every wish I held as law.</p>

  <p>I had been chatting with the ubiquitious Yermoloff and his grey-whiskered
  chief, brilliant in his white Russian tunic and his breast glittering with
  stars, ranging from that of the coveted St. Andrew down to the last cheap
  decoration of the Sultan. They had been speaking of that subject ever upon
  the lips of diplomatists, the European situation, but I held a discreet
  silence, detecting in the trend of their gossip a desire to learn something
  from me. Experience had taught me that towards the representative of the
  Czar, wherever he might be found, silence was always golden.</p>

  <p>At last I espied an elderly English lady who was resident in
  Brussels&mdash;the Dowager Countess of Bessington&mdash;and seizing this
  opportunity of leaving my friends, I walked across to pay my respects to her.
  She was a rather stiff old lady of the ancient school, unbending to any but
  her equals, but being a particular friend of Lady Drummond's I always
  endeavoured to be polite to her. Truth to tell, however, she was a
  sour-tongued, mischief-making old woman, who if not continually grumbling at
  the British chaplain's broad Church notions, amused herself by inventing some
  startling scandal or other regarding women in Brussels society. Lord
  Bessington, her son, was in the Guards at home, a very popular fellow and a
  great friend of Giffard's. As I sat talking to her there strolled past us
  dozens of people I knew, nearly all of them with high sounding titles, except
  we poor diplomats, whose position in society is always twice as high as the
  depth of our pockets.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, amid the gay laughing crowd there appeared King Leopold himself,
  looking a trifle pale and worn, I thought, notwithstanding his striking
  uniform and the glittering star at his throat. With a word of excuse to her
  ladyship I rose and saluted him.</p>

  <p>The instant he saw me he crossed and exclaimed in a low voice, so that
  none around should hear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Crawford, you have not yet sent that woman to me. Recollect, I must see
  her&mdash;I must&mdash;you understand."</p>

  <p>"I have not yet been able to discover her whereabouts, your Majesty," I
  answered. "I am exerting every endeavour to do so."</p>

  <p>"Find her. Send her to me," he cried in impatience. "Every moment that I
  lose is of consequence. You know her, I do not. In this matter you can render
  me, if you will, the very greatest service."</p>

  <p>"It is my earnest desire to serve your Majesty," I answered, with a bow,
  puzzled at his eagerness, for he had evidently come in search of me.</p>

  <p>"Then spare no effort to find that woman Kohn," he said in a low tone, and
  then turned quickly with that pleasant smile which he could assume at will to
  greet a high-born stately woman who had advanced and loyally bowed before
  him.</p>

  <p>Behind me, as I turned, I saw the Archduchess Stephanie, a tall dark
  figure in primrose blazing with diamonds, standing in conversation with Lady
  Drummond and a little beyond stood the King's youngest daughter, the Princess
  Clementine, chatting to the young Count de Montaigle in the uniform of that
  smart corps the Guides. The royalties had arrived, therefore I passed on
  eagerly searching everywhere for the woman I loved. Through room after room I
  went, those huge dark-panelled salons with their wonderful ceilings and
  polished floors, but saw nothing of her. The Count and Countess of Flanders
  had finished the formal reception of their guests, and had returned to join
  them, but the function, brilliant as it was, possessed no attraction for me
  owing to the absence of Melanie.</p>

  <p>At length, after wandering aimlessly, I came across Baron Vandervoorde,
  the Controller of the Royal Household, and to him observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Hapsbourgs are not here; how is that?"</p>

  <p>The short, stout full-faced man glanced at me and answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They have left Brussels, m'sieur. The Princess and her daughter departed
  suddenly at mid-day."</p>

  <p>"Gone!" I exclaimed, dismayed.</p>

  <p>"Yes To Brandenberg," answered the Baron. "Their visit to Brussels has
  been much longer than usual this year, although their departure was very
  sudden."</p>

  <p>I turned away disappointed and dejected. Melanie, although she declared
  that she loved me, had left for Germany without a single word of farewell. By
  her departure the light of my life had been suddenly extinguished, and I
  strode out from that gay assembly, plunged in deepest melancholy.</p>

  <p>To remain there longer was impossible, now that I knew she would not be
  present. I had come there solely for the purpose of speaking with her, but
  alas! she had gone, and perhaps I should never again see her.</p>

  <p>Wearily I wandered home to my rooms, my mind full of grave apprehensions,
  for I loved her madly, with that true, ardent affection which comes to a man
  only once in his lifetime. As I entered, however, my gaze fell upon a letter
  which, my man explained, had been delivered by hand.</p>

  <p>I turned over the envelope eagerly. There was upon it the embossed cypher
  of the Hapsbourgs surrounded by the coronet. It was from her. I tore it open
  quickly and read the hurriedly written words penned in English in a fine
  German hand:</p>

  <p>"My Dear Philip,&mdash;I send you this because I am forced by adverse
  events to leave Brussels at once. In all the circumstances it is, perhaps,
  best that we should part now, rather than later, when our mutual love might
  ripen into a stronger affection. There are, unfortunately many reasons, some
  of which are well-known to you, which render it impossible that our
  acquaintance should be carried further. I regret that this is so, but alas!
  it is my fate that I am what I am. In addition, certain unforeseen
  occurrences have transpired to-day which, while forcing me to leave Brussels
  hurriedly, also utterly prevent us ever meeting again in the future.
  Nevertheless, I rest content in the knowledge that I am truly loved by one
  who is brave, honest, and upright. But beyond, all is blank. All is finished.
  A weight of bitterness and melancholy is upon me. We have met for the last
  time, Philip, but I hope we shall never fail to hold one another in fond
  remembrance. Adieu. May prosperity and happiness ever be yours is the prayer
  of&mdash;Yours affectionately, Melanie."</p>

  <p>I read the letter through twice, then stood staring rigidly at the rather
  uneven lines of writing, dejected, inert, crushed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; WHAT JUDITH KNEW</h2>

  <p class="first">MELANIE had left me. The bitterness of my reflections,
  through the long dull days which followed, was increased by the truth that
  this result was only what I might have expected. Ours had been a foolish
  infatuation; a dream of an Elysium that could never be obtained. I loved her
  with all my heart, and with all my soul, with all the fondness of a lover in
  his teens, even though I were a hardened, blase man of the world. Did she
  really love me? A thousand times as I contemplated the ruby ring upon my
  finger, the ring she had kissed, I asked myself that question, and each time
  when I recollected that love-look in her dark fathomless eyes my conviction
  of the genuineness of her affection became more than ever confirmed.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she had left me with that strangely worded letter, to sigh
  over the ashes of a dead past. While repeating her declaration of love she
  asserted in the puzzling missive, which I re-read so often, that our
  acquaintanceship must end, a conclusion at which she had arrived owing to
  some adverse circumstances, mysterious and unexplained. Why she had been
  forced to leave Brussels so hurriedly was entirely an enigma. I reasoned with
  myself, but could arrive at no definite solution of the problem.</p>

  <p>The days passed, hot stifling summer days when even the shaded boulevards
  were sultry, and the dead-white houses reflected back the sun-glare until it
  became dazzling, sickening. I longed for a change, for a breath of country
  air in fresh green England, for only when one lives abroad can one appreciate
  the rural beauties, the calm freshness of his native land. In all the world
  there is no spot so truly peaceful, so happy, so quiet and restful as the old
  world English village, with its rows of homely thatched cottages, its uneven
  'street,' and the sweet, all pervading scent of the wood-fires lit at evening
  to cook the labourer's meal. Those whose fate it is, or has been, to be
  temporarily exiled know full well with what zest and pleasure a visit to
  'home' is looked forward to; how the beauties of all other countries pale
  before those of our own England, and how dearly cherished are the memories or
  our native town, our public school, or our college. In this frame of mind I
  longed for home.</p>

  <p>The critical outlook consequent upon the theft of King Leopold's private
  correspondence kept me, however, in Brussels. The mission to which I had been
  appointed by the Marquess of Macclesfield remained unfulfilled. To put it
  plainly, I had entirely failed, and in addition had become enmeshed by that
  high-born woman, the daughter of a royal house. I had, by allowing myself to
  love, disregarded the wise maxim of the Chief that to be successful the
  diplomatist must never allow a woman to bewitch him. The fair sex are
  themselves the cleverest of diplomatists, and can worm out a secret when all
  the wiles of the male political agent have failed.</p>

  <p>So I remained in Brussels, gasping in the heat&mdash;that year of a
  semi-tropical character&mdash;striving to fulfil my secret mission by making
  inquiries in various quarters, but ever failing, until I began to despair.
  The ingenuity with which the correspondence had been stolen was truly
  marvellous. Day by day, week by week, the Cabinet in London remained in
  breathless expectation that the storm which had for years been culminating
  would burst over Europe, and England would find herself at war. The Sirdar
  had captured Khartoum and broken the Kalifa's power, and serious
  complications had arisen with France regarding the occupation of Fashoda. Day
  by day at Downing-street Lord Macclesfield received intelligence from the
  various embassies of the latest political wind. The heads of the War Office
  and Admiralty had been taken into the Cabinet's confidence, and measures had
  been rapidly taken for placing our defences on the alert against sudden
  surprise, the greatest care, however, being taken to prevent the suspicions
  of the press and public from being aroused. The country was in ignorance of
  the alarming crisis.</p>

  <p>The delay in declaring war could only be due to one reason, namely that
  the Powers desired time&mdash;a few weeks at most&mdash;to make their final
  preparations for a combined dash upon our shores. From Petersburg, by way of
  Downing-street, grave news reached us of unusual activity in Russian
  dockyards and arsenals, while orders had been issued for some grand military
  manoeuvres, which meant that the giant Muscovite army was to be mobilised
  without arousing our suspicion. There could be no doubt whatever that in
  Russia active preparations were being pushed forward swiftly and secretly.
  The Franco-Russian alliance so often denied by both Governments, was now to
  be carried into effect, and to England its results must be inevitably
  disastrous.</p>

  <p>In such circumstances it was scarcely surprising that I should be harassed
  by the knowledge that the prime object of the mission entrusted to me by the
  Marquess of Macclesfield had not only failed, but that we had been outwitted
  by a very clever thief, and that the file of correspondence had been spirited
  away in a manner utterly bewildering. Many were the consultations I had with
  Sir John Drummond and with Graves, the messenger, and twice I was summoned to
  Downing-street, where I related to the Chief all that had transpired.</p>

  <p>He looked grave, his ashen face twitching with excitement, as it was wont
  to do on but few occasions.</p>

  <p>"We can only wait, Crawford," he answered. "Our enemies, whoever they are,
  have got the better of us in this affair. King Leopold was here yesterday in
  incognito. He mentioned your strenuous efforts to penetrate the mystery."</p>

  <p>"I have done my best," I answered rather lamely, "even if I have
  failed."</p>

  <p>"Return to Brussels and continue your efforts. We must find out into whose
  hands the stolen papers have fallen. That is now of more importance than the
  discovery of the actual thief."</p>

  <p>So that night I returned to my post by way of Dover and Ostend, arriving
  at my rooms at early morning, and sitting out upon the balcony in the first
  rays of sunshine. But how to act I knew not. By every device I had sought for
  sign at the other Legations of their knowledge of England's peril, but could
  discover absolutely none. The King continued to give his entertainments, the
  Legations to hold receptions and diplomatic relations continued calmly and
  undisturbed.</p>

  <p>I thought ever of Melanie. The newspapers said she had arrived with her
  mother at Brandenberg, the ancient stronghold of the Hapsbourgs, where they
  would pass the remainder of the summer. I pictured her, free from the
  trammels of Court life, wandering about those picturesque valleys around her
  home, gossiping with the visitors, and being taken by English tourists as an
  English girl, so well did she speak our tongue. And as the anxious weeks
  passed and the days grew increasingly stifling in Brussels the desire grew
  upon me to see her once again, if for the last time, to learn from her own
  lips the cause of her sudden resolution to end our acquaintanceship. Yet what
  excuse had I for going boldly to the Castle and demanding an interview with
  her? She had impressed upon me the absolute necessity of keeping our intimate
  friendship a secret, and I had promised long ago to respect her wish. She was
  a Princess, and gossips were ever eager to seize upon any circumstance as
  ground for tittle-tattle.</p>

  <p>Times without number I had pondered over the matter, until at length the
  desire to once again see her became irresistible, and, obtaining a few days
  leave, I left Brussels, and, travelling by way of Luxembourg, put up at the
  Rathhaus in Treves, the old mediaeval hotel in the peaceful Place, beneath
  the shadow of the ancient Cathedral wherein the revered Holy Coat is kept,
  only being exhibited once every 50 years. Then, next day, I set forth on the
  snorting little river steamer down the Moselle winding through its romantic
  valley where ruined castles frowned from the crests of vine-clad heights, and
  quiet little villages nestled between road and river, mirrored in the water,
  villages whose names are known the world over by reason of their famous white
  wines.</p>

  <p>The journey was delightful. The steamer, little larger than a pleasure
  launch, started at daybreak, and for several hours we wound in and
  out&mdash;past Berneadel, famous for its 'Doctor,' Alf, Beilstein, and other
  quaint villages, through some of the most picturesque scenery in Europe,
  until at length, after many stoppages we reached a mere hamlet from which a
  boat came out bearing a mail-bag. The place, only a handful of houses, was
  called Brodenbach; and I went ashore in the boat, for Brandenberg was distant
  about a mile up a dark narrow gorge, where the pine trees cast a romantic
  gloom and the high bare grey crags overhung until they seemed threatening to
  fall as I wound my way beneath them. Passing up this gorge until I came to a
  sudden turn, there suddenly broke upon my view, towering upon a great,
  seemingly inaccessible cliff, the enormous turreted stronghold of the
  Hapsbourgs. The walls which had withstood so many sieges in the long-past
  days when the Archbishop of Treves was the terror of the neighbourhood were
  blackened by age, and at a glance one could well imagine the superior
  position of the garrison, for, perched up there, and impregnable on three
  sides, it commanded an extensive view over the hills and valleys from the
  Moselle away to the Rhine.</p>

  <p>Such was the romantic beauty of the scene that I stood gazing up at it in
  silent wonder. I had only before seen it from the river when coming up from
  Cochem. It was indeed a wonderful relic of a bygone age of barbarism, for had
  I not read grim and terrible stories of the fiendish tortures committed in
  its deep dungeons, and of hapless prisoners kept there by the powerful
  Hapsbourgs until death had relieved them of the monotony of existence?
  Indeed, as I looked, I could distinguish, attached high up to one of the many
  turrets, the historical iron cage wherein many a prisoner had been placed and
  tortured in full view of the besieging party.</p>

  <p>I followed the road, winding and well kept, once no doubt only a footpath,
  but now accessible to carriages, and after half an hour's stiff climb passed
  through the main entrance, handed my card to the liveried janitor, followed
  him across the huge paved courtyard with its long cool arcades and ancient
  draw-well, and waited in a small old-fashioned chamber furnished in medieval
  style with great carved table of black oak and chairs of similar design, a
  severe-looking place strangely comfortless but striking as an example of the
  princely home of four centuries ago. As I stood looking through the deep
  mullioned window upon the courtyard the turret-clock chimed slowly and
  solemnly. For a long time I remained there alone&mdash;fully half an hour, I
  think&mdash;until I began to wonder whether my card had reached the Princess.
  At length, however, another manservant appeared, saying in German:</p>

  <p>"Her Highness will see you, if you will please step this way."</p>

  <p>I followed him across a great banqueting hall, high-roofed and vaulted,
  from which were suspended the tattered, faded banners of the dead princes of
  Hapsbourg, while all around were stands of armour worn by those valiant
  warriors who were once the terror of all the Rhine-land from Cologne down to
  Mayence, and upon the stone walls great heavy German broadswords, many of
  which bore the rust of human blood.</p>

  <p>Down one long corridor after another we passed until we entered what was
  apparently a modern wing of the great stronghold, for the long passage was so
  thickly carpeted that our footsteps fell noiselessly, and a few moments later
  the man ushered me into a pleasant well-lighted room, the walls of which were
  pannelled in brown and covered with silken tapestry in mignonette green, the
  ceiling richly gilded, and in the corners were allegories of the female
  virtues. On the walls hung several of the great and famous pictures by
  Watteau, which stand alone and unapproachable in their style and form. In
  one, a party of ladies and gentlemen were embarking for a voyage to the
  'Fortunate Isles,' and two others represented the interior of a picture-shop.
  These, I knew, were some of the pearls of the art treasures of the
  Hapsbourgs. There were also other pictures by Lancret and Pater, of the
  school of Watteau, and as I advanced to the window to gaze out upon the
  magnificent panorama of valley and mountain the door was opened. I turned
  with quick heart beating to greet the woman I so fondly loved.</p>

  <p>Next instant, however, I drew back in blank astonishment. In the doorway
  there stood a female figure in severe black, gazing at me as though I were
  some hideous apparition. Perhaps, indeed, I was as a ghost of the past to
  her. Our encounter was equally startling to both of us. She had on no outdoor
  garments, and was evidently a guest at the Castle who had entered the room
  for some purpose, believing it to be unoccupied.</p>

  <p>She was the woman who held my secret in her keeping&mdash;Judith Kohn, the
  widow of Gordon Clunes.</p>

  <p>"You?" I gasped, dumbfounded. Of all women she was the last I should have
  dreamed to meet in the princely home of the Hapsbourgs.</p>

  <p>She stood before me, pale as death. Her lips trembled, and I saw that the
  encounter caused her much apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered in a hoarse voice, and with a painful effort to smile.
  "It is very strange that we should thus meet, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"I presume you are a guest here?" I said in a hard voice.</p>

  <p>She nodded in the affirmative, and slowly closing the door behind her
  advanced a few steps towards me.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she said quickly in a hushed voice. "Time does not admit of
  argument. I know that you love Princess Melanie, and you have called upon
  her. In a moment she will be here to greet you, therefore our conversation
  must be brief and pointed. I am going to leave you; and recollect that before
  her you and I are total strangers."</p>

  <p>"No," I said at once. "Melanie and her family shall not be tricked by a
  woman of your character. Remember that you and I are old friends&mdash;or
  enemies&mdash;which is it?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, but only for a single instant. She was a remarkable woman,
  for she never lost her self-control.</p>

  <p>"Friends, if you will preserve silence," she answered in deep
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Now, Judith," I said severely, "I know full well that your presence here
  is for some evil purpose. You are no doubt passing as some wealthy well-known
  woman, and have, as you have so often done before, succeeded in entering the
  charmed circle of Society. What are you now? Countess, Baroness, or is it
  Duchess?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. This woman, whom I knew well to be a political agent, and
  whose ingenuity in that respect was simply marvellous, had undoubtedly some
  sinister purpose in obtaining admission to the family circle of the
  Hapsbourgs. I had known her in Vienna, and to me had been due her exposure
  and the committal of her lover Krauss as a spy and traitor. Her smile told me
  that she still cherished a fierce revenge; that when occasion arose she would
  make that exposure which I dreaded because it would ruin my good name.</p>

  <p>To act boldly was, I saw, my only course. I recollected how on the night
  of Gordon's death at Richmond I had threatened her, and how she had laughed
  me to scorn because she knew at that moment her husband was lying dead. That
  mystery had never been cleared up, nor had the character of the statement
  which Gordon had made to the chief ever transpired.</p>

  <p>She was extremely handsome, this fair-haired, blue-eyed woman who had so
  often used her personal charms to worm out a secret or to entice a man to
  betray a confidence, and as she stood before me, a slim figure in black, she
  seemed to have come like an evil shadow between myself and my
  well-beloved.</p>

  <p>"You no doubt regard it as strange that I should be a guest here," she
  said, in a calm voice. "On my part, too, I regard it as curious that Melanie
  should love a man in whose past is a black spot, one which, if revealed,
  would cause the world to hound him down as a coward and a criminal."</p>

  <p>She referred to my secret. I bit my lip.</p>

  <p>"Once," she continued, "on a certain night in Richmond, you declared that
  you would tell my husband my true name and station; and you would have done
  so but for reasons to which it is now unnecessary to refer. Since then we
  have not troubled one another. Now, when we meet thus unexpectedly, secrecy
  is surely in our mutual interests."</p>

  <p>"No," I cried quickly. "I will not allow you to remain here with Melanie.
  You are a spy; and your presence here is with evil design."</p>

  <p>"If it pleases you to use hard words," she answered, "then I may return
  the compliment, m'sieur, and recall the fact that the Chevalier de Jedina was
  foully done to death by you. You, Philip Crawford, diplomatic representative
  of your Queen, are a murderer."</p>

  <p>"I tell you it was entirely unintentional," I cried. "I was perfectly
  innocent, and had no knowledge that a blank cartridge had been placed in his
  revolver. I shot him, it is true. But the duel was fair, as far as I was
  concerned. I had no knowledge that the man I killed was actually the victim
  of foul treachery."</p>

  <p>"Ah! you cannot prove it," she said, her face white with a fierce
  determination. "Your two seconds have both declared that they saw you
  handling your opponent's weapon."</p>

  <p>"And who were those seconds?" I exclaimed, as every detail of that
  horrible tragedy arose again before my eyes. "They were unprincipled spies,
  like yourself. It was they who introduced the blank cartridge, so that the
  Chevalier should be killed by my hand!"</p>

  <p>That duel, the only one I had fought in my life, had been the outcome of a
  quarrel consequent upon a lady whom I had escorted to dine in the restaurant
  of the Grand Hotel in Vienna, being insulted by a well-known politician, the
  Chevalier de Jedina. The insult was a most gross one, committed in presence
  of my friends; therefore, to vindicate my own honour, I had been compelled to
  send my card to him. We fought next day in a wood ten miles outside Vienna,
  and at my first shot the Chevalier had fallen with my bullet through his
  heart. It was only when his seconds came to examine the dead man's weapon
  that they discovered that the exploded cartridge differed from the others,
  being actually a blank one.</p>

  <p>Then, beneath those trees in the grey light of the well-remembered
  morning, as I stood bending over the body of the dead man, I was denounced as
  a murderer. Ere that day was out, however, I saw that I had been the victim
  of a foul conspiracy, arranged for the purpose of combating my efforts as an
  agent in the British secret service. I had always held suspicion that the
  whole plot had been arranged by this woman Judith in connection with Krauss,
  and I still held that conviction.</p>

  <p>Such imputation against the honour of any man was grave
  indeed&mdash;especially when my own seconds had been bought to denounce me.
  Although innocent I had no means whatever of proving that I had not placed
  the blank cartridge in my adversary's weapon. Hence this woman, who had
  afterwards so cleverly tricked her lover Krauss, had also held me in her
  power.</p>

  <p>"I think when you reflect," she exclaimed a few moments later, "when you
  consider all the circumstances, you will be inclined to agree with me that
  secrecy is best."</p>

  <p>"I will not allow her to entertain you without knowledge of your true
  character," I said with firmness. "It was you who sold the plans of the
  frontier forts for Oswald Krauss&mdash;you, the protege of the Russian
  Government. With some sinister motive you later induced Gordon Clunes to
  marry you. Do you think that I'm blind? You have now wormed yourself into the
  confidence of the woman I love&mdash;in order to betray her."</p>

  <p>"And you actually mean to expose me?" she cried hoarsely, advancing
  towards me, her eyes flashing with a dangerous fire.</p>

  <p>"I do," I answered. "I care nothing for the charges you may make against
  my honour. But I tell you I am determined to save her from you. Your vile
  espionage shall not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the words died from my lips in an instant as there was a sudden
  frou-frou of silk outside, the door opened, and Melanie stood in hesitation
  and surprise upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>By the expression of her face I felt assured that she had overheard the
  opening words of my interrupted sentence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE PRINCESS ASKS A FAVOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">"MELANIE!" I cried joyously, dashing towards her with
  outstretched hands. Our eyes met. In hers I saw that same sweet,
  well-remembered love look which had given me courage to confess the
  truth.</p>

  <p>Only one word she uttered in response.</p>

  <p>"Philip!" she exclaimed in low earnest tone, and then as her tiny
  trembling hand touched mine, and thrilled me with a fond pressing, her
  puzzled gaze wandered again to the woman in black who stood by, statuesque
  and motionless. In an instant the truth flashed across my mind. Melanie was
  annoyed at finding her guest in conversation with me. Perhaps, too, a slight
  jealousy had arisen within her. As she stood there my eyes were held to her
  in fascination, her cool morning dress of white muslin, girdled narrow but
  distinctive with pale mauve, gave her an indescribably dainty appearance, her
  complexion, fresh and natural, bearing no traces of that artificial softness
  which even girls in their teens nowadays affect by means of glycerine and
  rice-powder. How different were those two women? The one ingenuous, pure,
  honest, and as healthy in mind as in body; the other a painted, powdered
  woman of the world, steeped in the cardinal sins, crafty, unscrupulous,
  designing and unmerciful; a woman whose history had been more remarkable than
  any romance.</p>

  <p>By what means, I wondered, had Judith Kohn managed to obtain an invitation
  to Brandenberg? Few, indeed, were accorded that honour outside the immediate
  family circle, with the exception of course, of the usual annual visit of the
  German Empress and her children. Once or twice in autumn the Emperor William
  himself always came there to hunt in the great forests which stretch
  eastwards across the Rhineland, but by the Hapsbourgs the stronghold of their
  ancestors was always regarded as a place sacred to summer repose <i>en
  famille</i>. Guests were invited in large numbers to the great white palace
  in Vienna, or to the fine villa at Beaulieu, near Nice, where the winter was
  always spent, but never to Brandenberg.</p>

  <p>At a motion from Melanie the woman Judith reluctantly turned, and with
  threatening glance at me moved out, closing the door after her. I was
  scarcely prepared for such obedience on the part of one so defiant, and the
  instant she had gone I asked:</p>

  <p>"Who is that woman?"</p>

  <p>"Julie, my maid. She has not been with me long. But you apparently know
  her," she said. "You were talking when I entered."</p>

  <p>She had overheard my denunciation. Should I show open defiance and speak,
  or was it wiser to hold my peace? An instant's reflection decided me.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "I do know her. But she is scarcely the kind of person
  to be your maid."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked in quick surprise. "Impertinence seems to be her only
  really bad quality. She's a splendid linguist, a good pianist, and rather
  more fitted for companion than maid. From her chance remarks I know full well
  that she has once moved in quite a good circle herself."</p>

  <p>"Who recommended her to you?" I inquired anxiously, wondering with what
  design she could have entered Melanie's service.</p>

  <p>"Lady Thirlmere&mdash;one of my friends in London."</p>

  <p>"Then her ladyship must have been ignorant of who she really is."</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" asked the Princess, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Judith Kohn&mdash;the political agent in the employ of the
  Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Petersburg," I answered.</p>

  <p>"A spy!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>I nodded, adding: "And further, she it was who acted with that man Krauss
  and induced him to prepare the plans of the Austrian frontier forts."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried quickly, "I recollect. You told me that she was even worse
  than he, but that she escaped from Austria with the assistance of the Russian
  Embassy. And I have actually taken her into my service," she said, astounded
  at my revelation.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly her presence here is part of some well-laid plan," I said.
  "With a woman of her character it behoves one to be ever on the alert. Why
  has she taken the trouble to enter your service?"</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary. How can I tell?"</p>

  <p>"Reflect. Is there any secret of prime importance which is in your
  keeping? You, a member of a royal house, may be in possession of something
  which it is the object of your enemies to obtain."</p>

  <p>She was silent. In an instant her face was blanched to the lips.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried suddenly, as though some hideous truth had at that instant
  dawned upon her. "Yes! I see it all now! There is a deep and
  cunningly-devised plot. The coup would have been made quickly&mdash;perhaps
  even to-day, had you not thus given me timely warning."</p>

  <p>"A plot against you?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she faltered hoarsely. "Against me."</p>

  <p>Then she stood silent, deep in thought. Her mouth was hard set, and in her
  eyes a look of desperation strangely out of keeping with the calm beauty of
  her countenance.</p>

  <p>"This woman," I went on, "is possessed of a devilish ingenuity. Not a year
  ago I discovered her as wife of an official in our Foreign Office in London.
  She was leading a life of strict gentility at Richmond, the adored of her
  husband and the admiration of her suburban neighbours."</p>

  <p>"You think she had actually married him in order to obtain some secret at
  the bidding of her masters in St. Petersburg?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," I responded. "Gordon Clunes, her husband, died
  mysteriously, poor fellow, and she afterwards disappeared&mdash;to Russia, I
  believe. From that moment until a few minutes ago I have neither seen nor
  heard of her. But has not the man Krauss&mdash;the spy whose release you
  obtained from the Emperor Francis Joseph&mdash;has not he ever mentioned
  her?'</p>

  <p>"Yes. After your statement I demanded of him the whole story, and he
  related it to me. He told me of this mysterious woman who enjoys the
  patronage of all the Embassies of the Czar throughout Europe, of her
  artfulness, her daring, and her unscrupulousness; yet I never for one moment
  dreamed that this very woman whose name is synonymous with all that is crafty
  and evil was actually the one who waited upon me daily, and whose gossip was
  so bright and interesting."</p>

  <p>"Strange enough," I said, "King Leopold is extremely anxious to meet her.
  For some months I have been in search of her, in order to induce her to obey
  the royal command to go to the Palace."</p>

  <p>"King Leopold!" she gasped. Then, after a second's pause, added: "No, no!
  Philip. They must never meet."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I inquired, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she said earnestly, stretching forth her hand and grasping mine,
  "you love me, do you not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dearest. It is because I love you, because I could no longer bear
  your absence, that I have come here to-day, even at the risk of your
  displeasure."</p>

  <p>"Then I may trust you?" she said, in a deep tone of earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Of course you may," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Ah! for my sake, for love of me, Philip, do not take this woman to the
  King."</p>

  <p>"But why?" I argued. "I have reason to believe that from her certain
  information could be gained that might change the present critical outlook in
  Europe. You, of course, have heard sinister rumours of antagonistic alliances
  and of war."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Philip," she said, in a low voice, breathless in the intensity of
  her anxiety. "If the King and Judith Kohn meet, the outcome of the interview
  would be disastrous to me to my family&mdash;to my house. I am in grave
  peril. You love me. Once you declared that if you could ever render me
  assistance you would do so. Will you not help me, now that I am in sore need
  of your protection?"</p>

  <p>I had made a promise to the King. Whatever the object his Majesty had in
  seeking an interview with this mysterious female agent, it was undoubtedly of
  prime importance. Yet with this appeal of my beloved in my ears, how could I
  turn aside and disregard her? From the very fact that Judith was acting as
  her maid, it was apparent that she harboured some evil design, therefore it
  was but my duty to stand by and assist her. I had exposed this woman whose
  marvellous cunning had shaken empires to their foundations, and well I knew
  that ere long she would launch her charges against me mercilessly. The storm
  of her indignation and vengeance would be terrible.</p>

  <p>"The King's command should be obeyed," I said. "Remember that I am a
  diplomatist, and that my own country and his are in complete accord."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" she cried, with a passionate outburst. "No, you will not,
  Philip," she implored, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I do not see how this meeting could affect you personally, while it is
  just possible that the revelations which are within this woman's power to
  make may change the whole aspect of international relations."</p>

  <p>"No, I beg of you, Philip," she pleaded, holding both my hands in her
  convulsive grasp, and sinking suddenly upon her knees. "See!" she cried. "I
  beg of you to spare me&mdash;to spare me."</p>

  <p>"Spare you!" I exclaimed in wonder. "I don't understand. Why have you
  given me no explanation of your sudden flight from Brussels&mdash;or of your
  relations with that spy and traitor Krauss?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is absolutely impossible," she faltered. "I am bound to
  secrecy."</p>

  <p>"Then you wish me to neglect my duty, and say nothing to the King of the
  reappearance of this woman?"</p>

  <p>She was bowed before me, and I was holding her trembling hands. From her
  attitude I saw that she was terribly in earnest, as though all her future
  depended upon my decision.</p>

  <p>"It is the first favour I have asked of you, Philip," she said, in a low
  voice, panting as she spoke. "I know that your duty to your country is to
  inform the King, but upon your decision all depends. Ah! you do not know how
  much I have suffered, or what I am suffering now. You cannot tell the dire
  result which might accrue if the King and the spy exchanged confidences."</p>

  <p>She shuddered. Her face was blanched, and as her head bowed her white lips
  moved. It seemed as though there, upon her knees, she was praying for
  deliverance from her mysterious thraldom, and I stood in silence, motionless,
  hesitating whether to serve my country or the woman I loved so dearly.</p>

  <p>The maxim of the philosophical controller of England's destiny, the
  Marquess of Macclesfield, was indeed one full of truth. To be a successful
  diplomatist a man must needs steel his heart against all feminine
  blandishments. But there comes a time in the life of every man when he loves
  honestly and well, and when the happiness of the object of his affections is
  his primary consideration. My love for the Princess Melanie had been one full
  of a strange romance, our meetings had been clandestine, and none knew our
  secret but ourselves. To be loved by one of the most beautiful and high-born
  women in Europe, and placed on equality with her, poor that I was, had
  awakened my very soul, and had aroused within me a new zest for life. Could I
  disregard her appeal made before me upon her knees? I glanced down at her,
  and saw upon that pale troubled face, the face of a woman haunted by some
  secret dread, a look of intense anxiety such as I had never before witnessed.
  Tears, too, stood in her dark luminous eyes as she once again raised her face
  imploringly to mine. Those tears decided me. I never could bear a woman's
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"If you wish me to neglect my duty, Melanie, then I will do so," I said at
  last. "You know how dearly I love you, how every day, every hour, my thought
  is always of you. Brussels is but a desert now that you have left it."</p>

  <p>She rose unsteadily, assisted by me, and then without a word threw her
  arms passionately about my neck, and gave way to a flood of tears. Her
  pent-up emotion found vent as she buried her handsome head upon my shoulder,
  while I, with my arm about her slim waist, kissed her hair and endeavoured to
  comfort her.</p>

  <p>"I am miserable&mdash;wretched," she sobbed. "I was compelled to fly from
  Brussels without wishing you farewell, Philip, because&mdash;well, because
  every hour I remained there placed me in greater jeopardy. Forgive me."</p>

  <p>"You were in fear of that man Krauss," I exclaimed rather severely. "Tell
  me the truth. If I neglect my duty to serve you, then surely you will at
  least be frank with me."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she faltered. "I left in order to escape him."</p>

  <p>"Why," I asked. "What power does he hold over you&mdash;he a traitor and a
  spy, and you a princess? Why should you hold him in fear?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head mournfully, and a deep sigh escaped her.</p>

  <p>"Surely," I continued, "whatever may be your relations you might openly
  defy him if you wished."</p>

  <p>"Ah! would to heaven that I dared!" she cried. "Alas! it is
  impossible&mdash;impossible."</p>

  <p>"He is your lover," I said in a deep tone. "You cannot deny it,
  Melanie."</p>

  <p>"I have already denied it," she answered with a slight indignation. "True,
  I obtained his release, but it was imperative I did it to save
  myself&mdash;little dreaming that by so doing I was preparing for myself an
  everlasting torment."</p>

  <p>"Save yourself!" I echoed. "You speak in enigmas. Why not be more
  explicit, now that I have promised to assist you with all the power at my
  command?"</p>

  <p>"Because, even now, I dare not tell you everything," she replied. "All I
  can say is that I am in gravest peril, and that if you will you can save my
  honour&mdash;my reputation&mdash;nay, Philip," she added, in the voice of one
  driven to desperation, "you alone can save me from death!"</p>

  <p>"From death! Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because exposure is imminent," she said hoarsely, standing rigid and
  pale, her hands clasped to her white open brow in a sudden wild paroxysm of
  despair. "This woman Kohn has scented out the truth! She knows my secret, and
  will betray me! I confess I am unworthy of your love, even of your esteem. I
  have sinned, and only my death can make full atonement. Alas! that the love
  of the Hapsbourgs is fatal&mdash;always fatal!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; EVEN MORE CURIOUS</h2>

  <p class="first">SLOWLY I retraced my steps towards the winding sun-lit
  river, stumbling on utterly heedless of where I went. Through a full hour I
  had remained with my love, holding her hand and trying to comfort her, but
  overwhelmed with a weight of secret sorrow she only sobbed upon my breast.
  The world, she said, was against her, and her dream of happiness with me
  could never be realised. I strove to induce her to look only upon the bright
  side of life, but she had only mournfully shaken her head, saying: "For me,
  it is all finished&mdash;finished."</p>

  <p>I went along dull and dispirited, until loving her with my whole soul I
  turned and glanced back at the frowning pile standing out black and
  forbidding against the mellow sunlight. From one of those narrow high-up
  windows she was undoubtedly watching me, and as I stood there at the last
  bend of the road whence I could see the castle, I tried to decide which was
  the window of the room wherein our interview had taken place. Upon my lips
  was the impress of her fond passionate final kiss, and in my ears rang her
  parting words of love and despair. As I had followed the servant out across
  the old courtyard Judith was standing at the window watching my departure. In
  her eyes I discerned a dastardly evil glint, by which I knew that she
  suspected that I had told the truth. Yet I cared not now for her vengeance or
  her allegations. Never until that hour of parting had I known how deeply I
  loved Melanie, and as with a sigh I took farewell of the ancient fortress of
  the Hapsbourgs and dragged myself wearily forward her sweet face, the
  sweetest God ever gave to woman, rose before me full of sympathy and a charm
  irresistible.</p>

  <p>I had at last given her timely warning of Judith's identity, but the
  result of my visit had only been to increase the mystery which seemed to
  surround her actions, and to add to our mutual unhappiness.</p>

  <p>Nearly a week afterwards, when I was in Brussels again, my man one day
  brought in a letter, the envelope, of which bore the Hapsbourg coronet and
  cypher. My heart gave a bound, for Melanie wrote but seldom. I tore it open
  and eagerly read it. Full of expressions of trust and tenderness it also
  contained a strange request, namely, that in order to fulfil my promised
  offer of assistance I should proceed to London on the following day and call
  at nine o'clock in the evening at a certain house in Porchester-terrace,
  Bayswater, but for what purpose was not stated.</p><br>

  <p><i>"If you love me, Philip, you will not hesitate to serve me in
  this,"</i> the letter concluded. <i>"I rely on you to redeem your promise to
  assist a helpless, friendless woman, who is in gravest peril.
  Adieu."</i></p><br>

  <p>I pondered over the strange letter long and earnestly, then finding that
  it had been apparently delayed a day in the post, and that I had only
  half-an-hour in which to catch the morning mail to England by way of Ostend,
  I scribbled a note to Sir John Drummond explaining my absence, and then set
  forth upon my journey.</p>

  <p>I arrived in London about five o'clock, dined at the Club, and later took
  a hansom up to Bayswater. The house before which I alighted was a large,
  rather comfortable-looking one, which bore on its exterior evidence of
  prosperity in the shape of sun-blind, and a small, well-kept garden. A few
  stunted smoke-blackened trees overhung the wall, which shut the place out
  from the gaze of passers-by, and as in the evening light I passed up the
  gravelled walk I fancied I detected a dark figure disappear from one of the
  ground-floor windows.</p>

  <p>The moment I ascended the steps and rang the bell the ludicrousness of my
  position flashed upon me. I did not know for whom to ask, therefore when the
  elderly-man servant opened the door I lamely said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I believe I am expected here," and handed him a card.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the man, smart, and evidently well trained. "Kindly
  step this way," and he led me to an elegant little room which looked out upon
  a small flower-garden in the rear. The place was extremely well furnished.
  Why, I wondered, had I been sent there?</p>

  <p>I was, however, not kept long in suspense, for a few seconds later the
  door was opened and Melanie herself, in a dark green travelling-dress and
  neat toque, stood before me.</p>

  <p>"Ah! dearest," I said in joyous surprise, springing forward and seizing
  her hand, "I had no idea that you were in London."</p>

  <p>"No," she smiled. "But how am I to thank you sufficiently for keeping this
  appointment?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks are unnecessary between lovers," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Then you do still love me, Philip?" she asked in a strange tone of doubt
  and anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Love you! Of course I do, darling. Why do you doubt me?" I asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>She sighed, and I thought I detected in the corners of her pretty mouth an
  almost imperceptible expression of bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Because," she answered in a low, nervous voice, "because when you know
  the truth your love will turn to hatred."</p>

  <p>"Never!" I cried. "Never! How strangely you speak. Tell me why you have
  come here, and what I can do to assist you."</p>

  <p>"Wait," she answered in the voice of one speaking in a dream. "Be patient,
  and you shall know all&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>"But it is all so puzzling," I said. Then, after an instant's pause I
  asked, "What of Judith? Has she left you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"After making a charge against me?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>Again she nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you believe it?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"I believe nothing without proof," she answered, and I saw a sweet,
  sympathetic love-look still in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I swear that her allegation is not true," I said. She was calm, but pale,
  and I fancied that she shuddered when I took her hand and raised it to my
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You think it strange that I should meet you here," she said at last.
  "This house is the house of a lady with whom I lived for three years while
  learning English; and this room my own, which has been kept just as I left it
  when I returned home to make my debut in society. How well I remember it!"
  she exclaimed, glancing round; "and how happy I used to be here, in my
  girlhood days, before the great evil fell upon me."</p>

  <p>"The great evil? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! Philip," she answered, "it is only right and just that you should
  know, even if after I have spoken I dare never to look into your face again.
  You are an honest, upright, conscientious man, a trusted servant of your
  Queen and country, and a manly lover of whom any woman might be
  proud&mdash;yet I have deceived you."</p>

  <p>"Deceived me!" I ejaculated. "How?"</p>

  <p>"Towards you my life has been a living lie. I have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But her words were interrupted by the entrance of a man-servant, who
  said:</p>

  <p>"A gentleman who gives the name of Krauss desires to see your
  Highness."</p>

  <p>"Krauss!" she gasped, turning to me, in an instant, white as death. "Is he
  alone?" she inquired, with an assumed calmness.</p>

  <p>"A lady is with him. She is fair, and dressed in black."</p>

  <p>For an instant she was silent, then, with a calm determined look upon her
  face she ordered them both to be shown in.</p>

  <p>"Krauss and Judith Kohn!" she said, turning to me. "They have lost no time
  in tracing me here, and their purpose is undoubtedly a sinister one&mdash;to
  obtain by foul means that which I have refused them."</p>

  <p>"Happily I am with you!" I said, reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she cried in despair, "but you, like all others, will turn
  from me when you know the wretched, ghastly truth."</p>

  <p>Then, next instant, the spy and traitor, together with the handsome woman
  who was his ingenious assistant, entered the room.</p>

  <p>Both drew back speechless at sight of me. Probably they remembered that
  the frustration of their clever designs was once due to my watchfulness; at
  any rate they both had just cause to detest the memory of those days of the
  past.</p>

  <p>"Good evening to you," I said, with an affected politeness, for it
  appeared that the interesting pair had walked quite unconsciously into a
  trap. Such illusion was, however, very quickly dispelled, for Krauss,
  arrogant and overbearing as was his wont, answered:</p>

  <p>"I called to see the Princess alone."</p>

  <p>"I am a friend of her's&mdash;an intimate friend&mdash;and shall remain
  here," I said.</p>

  <p>"Then my business can wait until she is alone," he answered, with a grin
  upon his countenance. "I am in no immediate hurry, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"Speak!" exclaimed Melanie, hoarsely, grasping the back of a chair to
  steady herself. "I well know that the object of your visit is in continuation
  of the overtures you have so constantly made to me. Explain."</p>

  <p>"How can this person be connected with you," he said, turning his eyes
  upon her companion.</p>

  <p>Judith Kohn stood beside him, a silent figure in black, her handsome
  features but half concealed by her spotted veil.</p>

  <p>"You know Philip Crawford," Melanie said, impatiently. "You have met
  before, and are not strangers. Why do you hesitate to speak?"</p>

  <p>The spy, silent for a few moments, exchanged a quick glance with his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said at last, "because explanations are quite unnecessary
  The matter between us concerns your delicate character."</p>

  <p>"Then if you are determined not to speak, I myself will explain," said
  Melanie, bracing herself up with an effort. "I have resolved to suffer no
  longer. I am determined to end for ever this eternal torture of the soul,
  even at the risk of losing all in this world I hold most dear."</p>

  <p>"Your love&mdash;eh?" sneered Krauss with a contemptuous glance at me. He
  had not forgotten our encounter on that well-remembered night in
  Brussels.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Philip," she cried in a voice of desperation. "The persecution of
  this man has driven me to moral suicide. To-night I will end it all. Hear me,
  and then judge my faults impartially and with justice. I know I am unworthy,
  yet I have deceived you, because, loving you as I did, I feared that when you
  knew the hideous truth you would cast me aside and forsake me."</p>

  <p>A cynical laugh escaped the ex-captain's lips.</p>

  <p>"Continue," I said. "Take no heed of this released criminal's jeers."</p>

  <p>Krauss's face puckered into a frown, and without answering he darted at me
  an evil glance.</p>

  <p>"For years I have been this man's victim," she cried, panting. "Fearing
  always to disobey his will I have been compelled to act as he has directed,
  to be his cat's-paw in the many dishonourable transactions in which he has
  been implicated. To-night, however, I release myself from the hateful
  thraldom by making full confession of all the past. True, I am of an
  honourable house upon whom no breath of scandal has ever rested, and at the
  outset I declare that I will rather die by my own hand than bring discredit
  and idle gossip upon the Hapsbourgs. The pride of my family has always been
  the virtue and integrity of its women, and in order to clear the escutcheon I
  have besmirched by my conduct I tell the whole truth without concealing one
  single fact."</p>

  <p>"Then you're an idiotic fool," interrupted Krauss bluntly. "You always
  were the most circumspect and cautious woman I ever knew, but now you
  actually intend to bring scandal upon yourself in a manner utterly
  unnecessary. Only you yourself can suffer by such an exposure."</p>

  <p>"Wait until I have finished," she cried, turning fiercely upon him. "I
  have suffered enough at your unscrupulous hands, compelled as I have been to
  perform actions mean and despicable, even to commit acts which might have
  brought me within the clutches of the criminal law; to pose as your lover
  when you so desired it, and to render you assistance in official quarters.
  Little the world has dreamed that you, the condemned traitor to your country,
  obtained your liberty through my effort, or that my money has kept you in
  luxury and extravagance for months, nay years. And why? Because I feared you?
  Yes. I was not long in discovering how mean and relentless you could be when
  occasion required, and I knew that defiance meant my ruin and a scandal which
  would fill the newspapers and cause half Europe to gossip. The safety of an
  Empire was at stake, the honour of a royal house was in your hands, therefore
  I, believed by all to be innocent and ingenuous, was compelled to submit to
  your demands, to act as you dictated, to supply you with information which
  you sold at enormous profit to enemies of my house and country. At a foolish
  moment I had placed myself irresistibly within your power, and you, a cunning
  schemer, used me as your tool wherewith to execute some of the most delicate
  and ingenious coups of espionage ever perpetrated. Nothing is sacred to
  you&mdash;patriotism, honour, family ties, or even a woman's life. These
  three long, weary years have to me been a veritable century of suffering. Now
  you have driven me to desperation, and I prefer exposure, the execration of
  the world, even the denunciation of the man who loves me so tenderly and
  truly, to this secret alliance which has crushed and killed my very
  soul."</p>

  <p>At these passionate words of hers the man drew back with an uneasy laugh,
  meant to be derisive, but sounding strangely artificial. My previous dealings
  with him had shown me that he was by no means easily cowed. To obtain success
  he had hesitated at nothing, and was an adventurer of the very worst and most
  irresponsible type. There was a look of cruel, crafty cunning upon his
  countenance and a glitter in his eyes which told of fierce thoughts
  within.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "explain all if you consider it wise. Only you yourself
  will suffer."</p>

  <p>"You," she cried, "have striven to drive me to commit suicide; and I
  should long ago have taken my own life were it not for the fact that by doing
  so you would triumph. You sent this woman to me," she said, pointing to
  Judith, "in order to obtain that which you sought; but by a fortunate
  circumstance Philip came to Brandenberg and there recognised her as the woman
  who helped you in your nefarious, traitorous work in Vienna. It placed me on
  my guard, and, happily, I have been enabled to frustrate you from making a
  coup which would undoubtedly have startled the world."</p>

  <p>"But tell me," I interrupted, much puzzled. "Tell me why you have been
  held powerless by this man?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, it is a wretched story," she answered, turning to me, "yet it is only
  just that all mystery should now be removed, and that you should have full
  and clear explanation. Four years ago, while still in my teens, I delighted
  to escape from the palace and wander about alone. We were living in Vienna,
  and I often went out secretly by myself to make various little purchases,
  being in the habit of calling at a pastrycook's where they made English tea.
  On one of these visits I met there a smart-looking officer who showed me some
  trivial politeness, and who afterwards came there so frequently that I could
  not help guessing that he came purposely to meet and chat with me. This
  acquaintanceship quickly became more sincere; he gave me his card, and at his
  request I one evening met him clandestinely. In those days of romantic
  girlhood I thought it great amusement to have a lover, and evening after
  evening I would contrive to get away from the home circle and go for walks
  with him. Months went on. He was unaware of my true name and of who I was,
  for I had given my address at the house of a friend on the outskirts of the
  city, until one day he was ordered to do duty with the Palace guard, and
  quite by accident discovered my identity. Almost a year had elapsed, a year
  of halcyon days and foolish dreams of love and happiness, when one evening he
  did not keep the appointment he had made. I waited for him over an hour, then
  went back disappointed. For three evenings following I returned to the spot,
  but he came not, nor did he write and explain. I thought that probably he had
  been ordered into the country suddenly; but about a week later the real truth
  became revealed, for I received anonymously in an envelope a clipping from a
  newspaper which briefly stated that Captain Oswald Krauss, of the 33rd
  Regiment of Artillery, had been arrested for gross dereliction of duty."</p>

  <p>"Krauss!" I echoed. "Then he was the officer whom you met, and whom you
  loved!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered hoarsely. "I loved him, but remember I was young, and
  utterly inexperienced in the ways of the world. I knew little of life beyond
  the walls of the Palace, or of Brandenberg."</p>

  <p>"Well, after his arrest, what then?" I inquired, amazed at her revelation,
  and recollecting how I had successfully tracked the spy through a perfect
  labyrinth of complications previous to his arrest.</p>

  <p>"I knew that he would be tried by court-martial, therefore at my request
  the President allowed me to remain in an adjoining room at the trial. There,
  through a small window I saw the man who was my lover standing between two
  guards with fixed bayonets, and I heard the terrible charge against him. I
  heard the evidence, and was present when you yourself explained how you had
  first made the discovery of his treachery. He trembled at your calm
  straight-forward denunciation, and I saw of what dastardly treachery he had
  been guilty. He had coolly sold his country, and placed the lives of his
  fellow-men in jeopardy in exchange for Russian roubles. Had you not
  discovered the truth in time he would have given Russia the key to
  Austria."</p>

  <p>"You actually heard me give my evidence?" I exclaimed, amazed.</p>

  <p>"I heard every word of it, being present each day that the court-martial
  sat," she answered. "I was present, too, on that morning when at sunrise the
  spy was led forth into the barrack square, and in front of the whole garrison
  his sentence was read out, although the exact charge was not stated, for fear
  of giving offence to Russia. Then his sword was broken, his epaulettes torn
  off, the gay braiding cut from his tunic, and to loud drumming and the
  execrations of his brother officers and the men who had served under him, he
  was led off to prison, a scowling sneaking wretch in whose crime there had
  been no extenuating circumstance. From that moment my love for him turned to
  hatred. He had betrayed me, and had sought to betray his country and his
  Emperor."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; CONFESSION</h2>

  <p class="first">"AND then?" I asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I left Vienna with my family, and we spent the summer at
  Brandenberg and the winter at Beaulieu. Then we went on a round of visits to
  London, to the Hague, and to Rome, until all thought of the wretched convict
  passed from my mind. One day, however, while on a visit to the Empress
  William, at Berlin, I received a letter dated from the prison of Budapesth
  containing a cool, alarming demand&mdash;namely, that I should go at once to
  the Emperor Francis Joseph and beg his immediate release. To this I made no
  response; whereupon I received several other letters in which he repeated his
  demand, adding that he knew the Emperor would accede to my wish provided that
  the release was kept a secret, and that he gave an undertaking never to again
  set foot on Austrian soil. I replied, telling him that no Hapsbourg had ever
  assisted one guilty of treason, and that I would be no exception. Then, in
  response, came another brief note which held me terrified&mdash;for he
  threatened that if he were not released within fourteen days he would write
  and forward to the newspapers a certain statement concerning me&mdash;a
  statement which, I knew too well, alas, would cause a sensation throughout
  Europe. Defiance was useless. This keen-witted, unscrupulous spy held me
  irrevocably in his power, hence, though I hated him and detested his memory,
  I was compelled to go to the Emperor and plead for his release. At first I
  was unsuccessful; but having concocted an ingenious story I at last
  succeeded, and the man who had so coolly bartered his country's military
  secrets was secretly escorted to the frontier.</p>

  <p>"Many months passed, and I heard nothing of him," she continued. "Last
  summer, however I came to London and stayed here with my old teacher of
  English, when one day he called, and from his conversation I learnt that he
  had left the secret service of Russia and had entered that of France; and
  further, that together with the woman who had so cleverly assisted him in
  Vienna he had concocted a deeply laid plan to secure possession of certain
  secrets of the British Foreign Office. He told me how at Downing-street the
  French had established a complete system of espionage, and, equally with
  Russia, were aware of nearly all that transpired. So cleverly were documents
  copied or their purport noted that no suspicion was ever aroused, and further
  he said that one of the principal of the secret agents was a woman who was
  wife of a trusted official through whose hands all treaties, or drafts of
  treaties passed."</p>

  <p>"And that woman," I interrupted, "that woman is now before us!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I thus be implicated?" said Judith, resentfully. Then turning
  to her companion, she said, in Hungarian. "The affair is growing too ugly for
  my liking."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," I exclaimed, severely. "You remember your brief married life
  with poor Gordon, and the circumstances of his death, which were more than
  peculiar."</p>

  <p>She glared at me fixedly, but uttered no response.</p>

  <p>"Continue," I said, addressing Melanie, who had now become calm and
  determined, and who spoke with a fearlessness which showed her resolution to
  explain the whole truth.</p>

  <p>"This woman, he said, had obtained knowledge that certain negotiations
  were in progress between Belgium and England, which in event of war would
  seriously affect the success of any operations by Russia and France. Of the
  preliminaries they had gained a good deal of knowledge which had been
  carefully transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, where it
  had created great consternation. Orders had, therefore, been given this
  arch-traitor and spy to secure at all costs the original documents on which
  the supposed secret treaty was based, and it was with that object he had come
  to me."</p>

  <p>"He wanted you to assist him in his plans, I suppose?" I observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "He unfolded an elaborate scheme by which I was to
  help him. Briefly, it was that on a certain day the correspondence between
  King Leopold and your Ambassador, Sir John Drummond, would be transmitted by
  special messenger from the Legation to Downing-street, and he proposed that
  on this particular day I should travel with the messenger from Brussels to
  London with an exact duplicate of the Foreign Office despatch box, and on the
  journey contrive to exchange the box containing the State secrets for the
  dummy one, which, with his marvellous ingenuity, he had already carefully
  prepared."</p>

  <p>She paused, while I stood open-mouthed and astonished at her
  statement.</p>

  <p>"At first," she went on, "at first I allowed my disgust at his proposal to
  over-ride my discretion, and angrily ordered him from the house; but very
  soon, from his threatening attitude, I saw that his fixed intention was that
  I should render him assistance. Thus, for fear of the exposure he might make
  regarding myself, I was compelled to submit. I was compelled to become a
  political agent."</p>

  <p>"You!" I cried. "Then did you actually assist him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, under compulsion, and in order to avoid the gross and terrible
  scandal which he might bring upon my family, I was compelled to sacrifice
  myself and become this man's catspaw in his nefarious schemes."</p>

  <p>"Then you actually stole the King's correspondence!" I gasped, utterly
  amazed.</p>

  <p>"For a long time I refused to consent," she answered. "He called fully a
  dozen times, and at last finding him inexorable I went to Brussels, carrying
  with me the dummy despatch box. Then, on the day he had stated, his
  information coming, I suppose, from some secret agent in the Belgian
  Ministry, I saw on the platform of the Gare du Nord, at Brussels, the
  messenger, bearing despatches. I entered the same compartment, and presently
  contrived to get into conversation with him. The dummy box was concealed in
  my large dressing-bag, and I awaited my opportunity to draw it forth and
  exchange it for the one he had placed upon the seat beside him. It was a
  hazardous and delicate piece of work, and no opportunity presented itself
  during the journey to Ostend, or while on board the steamer bound for Dover,
  where, by the way, my bag was not opened by the Customs officers. The Queen's
  messenger&mdash;Graves was his name, I think&mdash;kept an ever-watchful eye
  upon his despatches. During the journey, however, we had become quite good
  friends, and when at Dover we had entered the express for London he suddenly
  asked whether I would like some tea. To this I replied in the affirmative,
  and asking me to keep an eye to his things he descended and obtained some tea
  from the refreshment room lad on the platform. In the moment of his absence,
  however, I drew forth the box Krauss had given me&mdash;an exact imitation of
  the real one&mdash;and, placing it upon the seat, slipped the one containing
  the despatches into my dressing-bag. My heart beat wildly within me when he
  returned, for I feared lest he might discover the trick, but so well had the
  box been imitated that he merely placed it on the rack over his head and
  settled down and chatted affably with me during the remainder of our journey
  to London. Eager to escape at the earliest possible moment I told him that I
  was on a visit to some friends at Horsham, in Sussex, and therefore London
  Bridge was my best station to alight, for there I could obtain a train direct
  to my destination. So I left him when we arrived at the first stoppage in
  London, and after the train had crossed the bridge in the direction of
  Cannon-street I returned, at once took a ticket back to Dover, and a quarter
  of an hour later was again on my return journey, having successfully
  accomplished my first mission as a spy. How I existed during that journey
  back to Ostend I scarcely know. So intense was the excitement within me, and
  so great my fear of arrest, that I passed hours of agony and dread, until in
  the grey of the morning I found myself once more in Brussels, where I
  concealed the box unopened in one of my trunks in my own room at the Palace.
  Later that day I telegraphed the result of my effort to the man who held me
  within his power. He was in London, and replied that he had further important
  affairs there, but that he would meet me in Brussels in three days time. He
  also wrote by the same post saying that he would meet me three days later at
  the evening promenade concert at the Wauxhall Garden, when I was to hand him
  the stolen correspondence, which he would convey at once to Paris."</p>

  <p>"And did he meet you?" I asked, eager to know what had become of the file
  of the King's letters, the loss of which had caused us such consternation and
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "But on the night following my return from London I
  made a discovery which caused me to entirely alter my plans. I found that
  you, Philip, the man whom I had met in the Bois, was an agent of the English
  Government: and I then saw that if I parted with the papers I had stolen
  opprobrium must fall upon you. I learnt from the King's own lips that you
  were employed on secret service, charged with making inquiries into certain
  operations of the <i>cabinet noir</i> in Brussels, and with obtaining such
  information as might combat the conspiracies of the enemies of Belgium and
  England. Well, I may as well confess that I loved you, Philip, and with a
  vague idea of rendering a service to you, as well as to King Leopold, I
  refused to give up the stolen letters."</p>

  <p>"You refused," I cried quickly. "Then have they never fallen into this
  man's hands?"</p>

  <p>"Never!" she answered. "The box, unopened, is still in my possession."</p>

  <p>"Then you have saved England from a deadly peril&mdash;from a disastrous
  and terrible war," I exclaimed in breathless joyousness.</p>

  <p>"When he came to me and I refused to deliver up the despatches," she
  explained, "he grew furious, threatening me with the same threats of exposure
  he had successfully used to secure his release and obtain my assistance in
  the masterstroke of espionage. But from what I had learnt from diligent
  inquiry I knew full well that you were in active search for the missing
  letters, and further, I felt assured that they must be of gravest importance
  in the critical political outlook. Hence, after fully weighing the situation,
  I determined to disregard his threats and keep the correspondence intact. I
  dared not reveal to you my wretched story of woman's weakness lest you should
  cast me aside as a spy; and it was for that reason I have been compelled to
  preserve this long silence. You will now understand the reason of our
  midnight meetings on the boulevards, and of this man's murderous attack upon
  me. At that moment, so infuriated was he by my refusal to deliver up the
  papers that I believe he would have murdered me had you not come to my
  aid."</p>

  <p>"It is amazing!" I exclaimed, dumbfounded, when she paused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the facts are indeed extraordinary," she said. "When this man found
  me inexorable and determined not to betray the secrets of English diplomacy,
  he first placed a spy upon me&mdash;the tall man whose presence at the Palace
  you noticed and then afterwards devised, with his devilish ingenuity, another
  plan which, but for you, might have succeeded. By artful plotting he
  contrived to introduce his accomplice, this woman, as my maid in order that
  she might be enabled to search my belongings and secure the papers of which
  the French Government were so anxious to possess themselves. Fortunately,
  however, you recognised her, and then in an instant I discerned the object of
  her entering my service."</p>

  <p>The woman thus referred to laughed defiantly, while the man remained
  sullen and silent, as if undecided how to act now that the truth was out and
  he was denounced as a cunning, despicable spy, whose craftiness had been
  frustrated just at the very moment of making his greatest coup.</p>

  <p>With a vindictiveness characteristic of such a woman, Judith Kohn began to
  pour forth upon me a torrent of abuse, referring in no measured terms to the
  death of the Chevalier de Jedina, and declaring that I was a murderer.
  Melanie, however, took no heed of her libellous utterances, for she was
  satisfied with the truthful explanation I had given of the dastardly plot
  against me by which a man's life was sacrificed.</p>

  <p>"But the stolen despatch-box&mdash;where is it?" I asked of Melanie. For
  answer she crossed to a large, old-fashioned chest of carved oak which she
  opened, lifting out the box which had been so cleverly snatched from Graves'
  possession and handing it to me I took it, and saw that the seals which Sir
  John Drummond had placed upon it were actually still intact.</p>

  <p>The covetous eyes of the pair were upon it, and fearing lest they might
  make a dash to overpower me and obtain possession of its precious contents I
  whipped out my revolver in readiness. Sight of my weapon cowed them. Possibly
  they remembered that where I aimed I generally hit.</p>

  <p>"You have, by refusing to part with this, Melanie," I said placing my hand
  upon the despatch-box, "rendered a service to my Queen and country of a
  magnitude it is almost impossible to comprehend. Had these letters been in
  the hands of our enemies it is absolutely certain that to-day the whole of
  Europe would have been convulsed by the most terrible and disastrous war the
  world has ever known. Driven by this pair of malefactors to commit deeds of
  treason and dishonour, you fortunately recognised the extreme gravity of the
  situation in time, and thus the honour and security of England have been
  preserved."</p>

  <p>"Had I not met you in the Bois, Philip," she said in a broken voice, "I
  should certainly have parted with the box in order to obtain a respite from
  this man's eternal persecutions, for he had made it the price of my
  deliverance from this thraldom. God knows how I have suffered, how, day by
  day, I strove to brace myself to confess all to you, but had not the
  courage&mdash;how, day by day, I prayed to heaven to deliver me from the
  hateful bond."</p>

  <p>"But what was this bond?" I asked, puzzled. "Why were you in constant
  dread of this man? Why were his threats so potent in compelling you to act as
  you have done?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" laughed Krauss with sarcasm. "Now, tell your lover the truth. You
  said you would not conceal anything."</p>

  <p>The colour again left her cheeks. She was silent, her face ashen pale.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="first">MELANIE'S clenched hands trembled. In her bright dark eyes
  was the haunted look of one driven to desperation.</p>

  <p>"The truth!" she gasped in a low hoarse voice, full of emotion. "The truth
  is that I feared he would expose me and create a scandal. I&mdash;I am that
  man's&mdash;wife!"</p>

  <p>"His wife?" I cried in blank dismay. "Impossible."</p>

  <p>"Alas! such is the hideous truth. In the early days of our acquaintance I
  loved him with the romantic admiration that a girl does her first lover. He
  spoke of marriage, I consented, and we were married legally at Budapesth,
  only two other persons being in the secret. I gave my name without my title,
  and none suspected my rank or station on that Sunday morning in early spring
  when we attended before the Mayor with a dozen other couples of the lower
  class. For a year, separated as we were bound to be, our lives were not
  without their romance, but judge my horror on the day that I learnt that my
  husband was to be tried by court-martial, and later when I saw him degraded
  and condemned to life imprisonment as a traitor to his Emperor and his
  country. A feeling of hatred and disgust was created within me when I
  received that letter declaring that if I did not obtain his release he would,
  through a journalist who visited him in prison, reveal to the world that I,
  Princess Melanie of Hapsbourg was wife of an imprisoned traitor and spy.
  Because of this threat which he ever held over me I was compelled to act
  always as he directed, until now that I can bear this terrible mental tension
  no longer I have preferred exposure and confession."</p>

  <p>"And you are actually his wife!" I exclaimed, utterly amazed at this
  astounding revelation.</p>

  <p>For answer the man Krauss, with a triumphant exclamation, thrust a paper
  towards me, and at a single glance I saw from it that the marriage was an
  entirely legal one.</p>

  <p>The woman I had loved could no longer be mine.</p>

  <p>The ghastly truth fell upon me, crushing out all hope and life. Calm,
  sweet-faced, and innocent, she had been tricked by this cunning scoundrel,
  and her suffering had, I know, been terrible through all those weary months.
  She had loved me fondly, knowing at the same time, however, that we could
  never be more to one another than friends. Yet her friendship had been stanch
  and true, and by her firm determination and resolute action, loyal devotion
  and self-sacrifice, she, the daughter of a Royal house, had saved England's
  honour and the lives of thousands of her valiant sons.</p>

  <p>Shortly before 11 o'clock on the following morning, accompanied by
  Melanie, pale and anxious, and carrying the missing despatch-box I ascended
  the grand staircase of the Foreign Office to the Marquis of Macclesfield's
  private room.</p>

  <p>We had not long to wait, for her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State
  for Foreign Affairs was always punctual at Downing-street, and a few moments
  after the clock at Westminster had solemnly chimed the hour, he entered grey
  faced and calm, with that light springy step and smartness of gait that was
  astonishing in one of his age. None passing him in the street would ever
  suspect that upon the shoulders of that thin, wiry, solitary-looking man
  rested the responsibilities of the greatest nation in the world.</p>

  <p>As he passed through the outer room wherein we were waiting he raised his
  grey eyebrows in slight surprise. Then, recognising me, he wished me good
  morning and glanced inquiringly at my companion, for ladies were unusual
  visitors there.</p>

  <p>"I wish to be permitted to introduce to your lordship her Royal Highness
  the Princess Melanie of Hapsbourg," I said, adding: "She wishes for an
  interview upon a matter of extreme importance."</p>

  <p>The old man bowed with his courtly diplomatic habit, expressed his instant
  readiness to receive us, and opened the door of his private room for her to
  pass in.</p>

  <p>Then, when we were all three closeted together I placed into the Chief's
  hands the stolen despatch box, with a word of explanation that the King's
  correspondence contained therein had remained hidden from the eyes of all.
  His thin hands trembled slightly as he took the box, carefully examining the
  official seals which had been affixed by Sir John Drummond, and with a
  mingled look of surprise and satisfaction, raised his eyes to mine
  saying:</p>

  <p>"Then you have actually outwitted the dastardly spies, after all,
  Crawford."</p>

  <p>"No credit is due to myself," I answered. "Her Highness has called to make
  personal explanation."</p>

  <p>"To make apology and what amends I can," faltered Melanie, raising her
  veil, and glancing timidly at the great Minister feared by every Government
  in Europe.</p>

  <p>"Apology!" he repeated, puzzled. "I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"I was the thief," she said in a low, hoarse voice, "and it is but just
  that I should make a full confession."</p>

  <p>"You? The thief!" exclaimed Lord Macclesfield, amazed. "Did you actually
  steal these despatches?"</p>

  <p>"I did," she answered, firmly. "Mr. Crawford knows the whole truth. He
  will tell you everything."</p>

  <p>Pressed by his lordship, I then related the whole of the curious
  circumstances, just as they are set down in the foregoing narrative, without,
  of course, referring to my love for the pretty, penitent woman before us,
  although I think he must have shrewdly guessed it. The telling occupied half
  an hour or more, and when I had concluded the Minister broke the seals,
  unlocked the box with his key and drew forth the despatches and precious pile
  of King Leopold's correspondence.</p>

  <p>He glanced cursorily through them, then raising his eyes to Melanie, said
  in that grave, kindly tone which always endeared him to the staff of the
  Foreign Office:</p>

  <p>"In this matter I offer your Royal Highness the warmest thanks of her
  Majesty's Government, for, by refusing to part with these despatches you have
  saved Europe a war, and, at the same time, preserved the honour of two
  nations&mdash;that of my own and of Belgium. You were induced by threats to
  commit the theft, but, happily you realised to the full the terrible
  consequences of the exposure. By risking your honour and your own good name
  you atoned for the crime you were forced to commit; hence we can only offer
  your our warmest thanks."</p>

  <p>"You are indeed generous. I am undeserving of any thanks," she protested
  in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, but you certainly are not," declared her Majesty's Minister
  with courtesy. "Had this correspondence actually fallen into the hands of
  those who conspired to obtain it we should, no doubt, at this moment be
  plunged into one of the fiercest and most calamitous wars that the world has
  ever seen. By the recovery of these letters confidence is at once restored;
  for we can now act vigorously, and the whole European situation is thereby
  changed."</p>

  <p>She smiled, much gratified at these words from the great statesman for
  whom, she had told me long ago, she had the highest admiration. She had come
  there to humbly ask forgiveness, yet this Minister of world-renown declared
  her to be the saviour of England.</p>

  <p>"And now that her Highness has succeeded in restoring to us the
  despatches, there is still another matter which it is only fair that I should
  explain," observed his lordship, settling himself in his padded chair, with
  his thin clasped hands resting upon the writing-table where day and night he
  worked in the interests of the nation. "Curiously enough, it was quite by
  accident that my suspicions were awakened regarding the wife of poor Gordon
  Clunes. One afternoon, as I was walking down to the House, I passed Clunes in
  Whitehall, and saw him meet a woman whom I at once recognised. About a year
  before a certain important document was found to be missing from the archives
  of the Embassy at Vienna, and one day, to my surprise, I received a letter
  from some mysterious person giving an address at Dieppe, offering to restore
  it on payment of a certain sum. I entered privately into correspondence with
  this person, who subsequently came over to London and saw me. It turned out
  to be a woman; and the same woman I was amazed to recognise in the company of
  such a trusted and faithful servant of the Department as Clunes. I at once
  caused secret inquiries to be made, and found that she was actually the wife
  of Clunes, and that they lived at Richmond. Comparison between the letters
  written from Dieppe and one written by Mrs. Clunes showed the handwriting to
  be identical; therefore there was every reason to suppose that the woman was
  an adventuress who had made a matrimonial alliance with Clunes with some
  ulterior motive. The unfortunate man himself must have also had his
  suspicions aroused," continued his lordship after a pause, "for on the day
  prior to his death he sought a private interview with me, confided to me the
  belief that his wife was a foreign agent, and handed to me a document which
  he had found concealed in her possession&mdash;an official document which
  plainly showed that France and Russia were conspiring against us. It was a
  startling revelation, but of course I hesitated to repeat his statement," he
  added, glancing at me, "having given my word to keep the suspicion
  secret."</p>

  <p>"Then he actually knew that his wife was a spy!" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" responded his lordship gravely. "But in a matter of such
  delicacy I could not betray the poor man's confidence, therefore I sent you,
  his friend, down to Richmond in order to hear his suspicions from his own
  lips. When the news, however, came that he had been found dead I caused the
  most searching inquiries to be made. The Director of Criminal Investigation
  gave the case into the hands of four of the most expert detectives in London,
  who, although they were unable to trace the whereabouts of the woman, made
  several very curious discoveries. I have their reports here," and unlocking a
  drawer he took therefrom a document on blue official paper which he opened
  and spread before him.</p>

  <p>"The inquest was held at Richmond, and after an adjournment an open
  verdict returned, the jury being satisfied to leave further inquiries in the
  hands of the police. The most careful investigations were subsequently made
  by Dr. Bond and Dr. Woodhead, two competent analysts of the Home Office, who
  after a long series of experiments were agreed in their opinions that Clunes
  had been poisoned. There was a slight abrasion of the skin upon the
  forefinger of the right hand, caused by a trivial accident, and on searching
  the room in which he was found dead they discovered that the silver penholder
  which he habitually used was somewhat discoloured, as though by an acid, a
  single spot of which had apparently been dropped by accident upon the
  blotting pad. This was analysed and submitted to a number of experts, who
  pronounced it to be a most virulent poison extracted from the leaf of the
  strophanthus, a plant which grows in Uganda. This poison is a little known
  one, and almost impossible of detention thirty hours after death. It is
  likewise most virulent, one-hundredth part of a grain being sufficient to
  kill a man."</p>

  <p>"Then by taking up the pen which had been smeared with that deadly
  compound the poison had entered the finger!" I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," answered his lordship. "The detectives succeeded in
  reconstructing the whole scene and its surrounding circumstances. It would
  appear from their report that the woman Judith Kohn, having ascertained that
  Clunes had discovered her identity, killed him in order to prevent her
  betrayal, not knowing, however, that he had already handed me the document he
  had found in her possession. On the day of the murder Clunes went forth in
  the morning with the ostensible purpose of going to the Foreign Office as
  usual, but having sent the telegram of excuse, he remained in Richmond and
  watched the man Krauss call upon her. During the whole of that day he was
  engaged in carefully watching her movements, being now confident that she was
  a foreign agent. He followed her home, and through the study window watched
  her take some documents from her jewel case and burn them in the grate. Then
  he withdrew and wandered about Richmond for an hour or so, hesitating how to
  act. Meanwhile, the woman had completed her arrangements for departure. Again
  he returned shortly before the dinner hour, and finding the French windows of
  the study open, entered from the lawn. Having made an examination of the
  tinder in the grate, and satisfied himself that the remains were of some
  official papers written in French, he sat down and lit a cigar in perplexity.
  At last he rose, and seating himself at the writing table took up his pen
  with the object of writing her a letter of accusation and farewell, intending
  afterwards to leave without seeing her. The touch of the pen was, however,
  fatal. She knew of the trifling injury to his finger&mdash;for it had been
  caused on the previous evening while they were cycling across Richmond
  Park&mdash;and had carefully prepared the pen holder he habitually used. He
  sat for a moment with it poised in his hand, but that moment was sufficient
  to produce a fatal result. The poison of the strophanthus is extremely rapid
  in effect, and ere half a minute had passed he commenced to experience a
  strange giddiness which was succeeded by racking pains in the limbs. He threw
  himself upon the couch to rest, but there quickly ensued coma, and afterwards
  death. His wife was in the adjoining room and knew the dire result of her
  dastardly plot; then having received you&mdash;for you called at the final
  moment&mdash;she left the house and disappeared. So virulent was the poison
  placed upon the penholder that Dr. Woodhead reports there was sufficient to
  have killed 50 men. Whoever supplied her with the poison must have been well
  versed in toxicology, for as far as is known this is the first time
  strophanthus has been used in this country for the purpose of committing
  murder."</p>

  <p>"Are those the actual facts?" inquired my fair companion, who had listened
  dumbfound.</p>

  <p>"Every fact which I have related has been proved by the most searching
  inquiries," his lordship answered gravely. "It was undoubtedly Krauss who
  called upon the woman after her husband's departure, and there is no doubt
  that the object in her marriage with Clunes was to obtain from him the
  secrets of certain drafts of treaties which passed through his hands."</p>

  <p>"Astounding!" I said, amazed at these startling revelations.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Most remarkable," the Minister went on. "You may, I think, both
  congratulate yourselves upon your fortunate escape from the hands of a most
  unscrupulous pair. It is evident that they have been actively conspiring
  against you. Now, however, that they are in London their arrest will be only
  a matter of a few hours. I will at once see the Director of Criminal
  Investigations myself."</p>

  <p>"But you will allow my statement to become public property!" exclaimed
  Melanie in alarm.</p>

  <p>"I shall, of course, respect your Highness's confidence in every
  particular," the grave old Minister answered reassuringly. "I am fully aware
  how much you have risked in order to preserve this despatch-box intact,
  therefore remain confident that I shall act with discretion. None will know
  the truth save Mr. Crawford and myself."</p>

  <p>Melanie thanked him with tears in her large dark eyes, then after some
  further consultation lasting over an hour, her Majesty's principal adviser
  shook hands with us both and we withdrew.</p>

  <p>Late that same afternoon the Princess left London for Brandenberg. I saw
  her off at Charing Cross, and it is sufficient to say that at the moment of
  parting we were both speechless, over-whelmed by regret, sorrow and blank
  despair. I raised her tiny gloved hand to my lips for the last time. My heart
  was bursting with a poignant grief. I watched the continental train steam
  away across the Thames into the mist, then turned into the busy turmoil of
  the Strand with the heaviest burden of grief my soul had ever borne.</p>

  <p>My idol was broken. Melanie, the woman I had loved dearer than life, could
  never be mine&mdash;never!</p>

  <p>A few days later I sadly returned to my post in Brussels, and eagerly
  watched the newspapers, fearing day by day lest, in revenge, Krauss should
  expose the secret of Melanie's marriage. Although the London police were
  active, their search was in vain. Descriptions of both were circulated in
  every district in the metropolis, and every constable on duty remained on the
  watch for them. The detectives who idle at all the ports watching embarking
  passengers were duly apprised, and were vigilant in their efforts, but days
  lengthened into weeks, until at last it was believed at Scotland Yard that
  they had both escaped from the country on the evening prior to our interview
  with Lord Macclesfield.</p>

  <p>I had audience of King Leopold on the morning after my return to Brussels,
  and related to him the circumstances in which his correspondence had been
  recovered, without, however, exposing the secret of Melanie's marriage, or of
  her complicity in the affair.</p>

  <p>At mention of the woman Kohn his Majesty said,</p>

  <p>"You will remember that some time ago I expressed to you a strong desire
  to see her. Some two years ago I ascertained that she was one of the most
  accomplished secret agents in the employ of Russia, and it occurred to me
  that she might possibly have a hand in the theft of the despatch box. My
  Minister in St. Petersburg was of the same opinion, therefore I wished to see
  her and ascertain if such were the truth. If so, I intended to offer her her
  price for the return of the letters. But what you have told me fortunately
  renders this unnecessary. I can only thank you very heartily for your
  successful efforts which have saved my personal honour, and as a mark of my
  esteem confer upon you the Order of Leopold, which I trust that your
  Sovereign the Queen will allow you, in these exceptional circumstances, to
  accept."</p>

  <p>"I thank your Majesty for the honour," I responded. "And I only hope that
  my Queen will give her permission. As your Majesty is doubtless aware, the
  regulations in our diplomatic service are very strict regarding the
  acceptance of foreign orders."</p>

  <p>"I am well aware of that," answered the King, smiling pleasantly. "But I
  will use what personal influence I can in the matter, for you certainly merit
  some reward more substantial than mere words."</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards, having received renewed expressions of the royal
  favour, I withdrew, and had the satisfaction a fortnight later of receiving
  the handsome insignia of the Order, together with the Queen's gracious
  permission to accept it.</p>

  <p>About a month after my return to Brussels the post one morning brought a
  long, rambling letter from Judith, dated from Dawes-road, a thorough-fare in
  Walham Green, confessing to the murder of Clunes, and giving precise
  directions as to where her accomplice Krauss was in hiding. Save that she was
  prompted by some motive of revenge there seemed no reason whatever why the
  letter should have been written, and its wording puzzled me. Knowing,
  however, that the police were still in active search of her, I wired the
  address to Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>Two hours after the despatch of my telegram the police arrived at the
  house where she was lodging under the guise of a widow named Franklin. They
  found the door of her room locked, and when they broke it open discovered her
  lying upon the bed lifeless. After writing the letter to me on the previous
  afternoon she had apparently committed suicide, using the same poison with
  which she had so swiftly and secretly killed poor Gordon.</p>

  <p>Krauss according to the dead woman's letter, was working as a shoesmith, a
  trade he once followed in his early days in the Austrian army, at a farrier's
  in the Passage St. Pierre, a turning off the Boulevard Voltaire in Paris.
  That same afternoon three agents of police went there to arrest him and found
  him wearing a leather apron and quietly engaged in shoeing a horse. He was
  amazed at the suddenness of his arrest, but upon being interrogated some days
  later it quickly became apparent to him that the truth was out, and before
  the formalities for his extradition could be completed he hanged himself in
  the police cell.</p>

  <p>Few letters had come to me from Brandenberg, but when the details of the
  death of that pair of accomplished spies reached the Embassy officially I
  lost no time in communicating them to Melanie.</p>

  <p>In response she wrote me a long letter of warmest thanks, pointing out
  that to me alone was due her freedom from that hateful tie, and therefore she
  owed me a debt which she could never hope to repay. The letter, which at her
  desire I at once destroyed, spoke of our mutual love in terms of tenderness
  and deepest regret. It was true, she wrote, that we had loved each other
  fondly and passionately, but all was now of the past. Ours had, indeed, been
  a dream impossible of realisation, but her final words gratified me, and will
  ever live within my heart. "I shall remember you, Philip," the letter ended.
  "I have loved you, and shall remember you always&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>Our correspondence, after that, was as may be well imagined, full of the
  tenderest passion of a platonic love, until one day, coincident with the
  announcement in the newspapers, she wrote and told me that the Emperor
  Francis Joseph had suggested to her family that she should marry the young
  Prince Adolphe of Hohenzollern. I sent her congratulations, but my heart was
  heavy with its burden of sorrow.</p>

  <p>My love had passed from me for ever.</p>

  <p>The royal marriage took place at Potsdam in the following spring, I being
  present in my official capacity, having in the meantime been promoted to the
  secretaryship of the Embassy at Berlin, under the most accomplished of
  Ambassadors, Sir Frank Lascelles. The wise maxim of the Marquess of
  Macclesfield, that to be a successful diplomatist a man should not marry,
  consoled me in my long hours of regret and melancholy, and to satisfy the
  curiosity of those who read this narrative I may perhaps add that I am still
  a bachelor.</p>

  <p>I own to a sadness and grief sometimes, and more than once since Melanie's
  marriage, when I have danced with her at some State ball, or she has leaned
  lightly on my arm at some brilliant Court function, a recollection of the old
  days when we were lovers has come vividly back to me. But since that
  well-remembered day when she wrote telling me of her engagement, no word of
  love has ever been exchanged between us. I am philosopher enough to know that
  things are as they should be. Our love was but one of those vague dreams of
  the impossible which, even if followed by a flood of sorrow, do much to
  lighten and brighten our lives and make us better men and women. Sometimes,
  when she speaks to me, I fancy I detect in those dark beautiful eyes
  something of the old love-glance of long ago. But it is really only a foolish
  fancy of mine. That look is not of love, but of extreme happiness, and of
  confidence that I will ever be loyal to her and rigorously preserve the
  secret of her marriage and her tragic widowhood.</p>

  <p>Yes, it is as it should be, even though in the lonely silence of my rooms
  I may sigh sometimes during those little debauches of regret that come at
  intervals to every man. From the very first I had regarded marriage as
  impossible. We had loved each other with a deep, profound, and tender
  affection, yet the barrier of birth was impassable&mdash;I a struggling
  diplomatist, and she a Hapsbourg.</p>

  <p>The Prince and Princess Adolphe of Hohenzollern are now my warmest
  friends, and I am always a welcome guest at their palace. Moving in the
  centre of Berlin Court life as they do, her Highness is often in possession
  of information of highest importance to us in our constant efforts to
  counteract the wiles of French and Russian diplomacy. Truth to tell,
  therefore, to our mutual friendship is due those constant coups that we, at
  the British Embassy, are enabled to make, so much to the chagrin of our
  enemies, the two Powers who are ever seeking to outwit us, and who little
  dream that the information upon which we so promptly and successfully act
  comes direct from the private circle of the Emperor William, or that our
  informant is actually a Princess of the Blood Royal.</p>
