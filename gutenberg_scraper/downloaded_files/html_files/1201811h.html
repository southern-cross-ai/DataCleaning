<h2>DETECTIVE'S BATTLE WITH KIDNAPPERS</h2>

<h3>WITS AGAINST WITS</h3>

<p class="first"><i>An attempt was made by a desperate gang of criminals to kidnap the son of Lady Helen Ardane, widow of Sir Charles Ardane. The method indicated that there was someone with brains and money behind the scheme. A private investigator was called in. Three attempts on his life were made, and, after a fortnight of fruitless in vestigation, he relinquished the task. Gilbert Larose. the famous Australian detective on exchange duty at Scotland Yard, was called in, and immediately he drew first blood. However, it was .but a preliminary skirmish to the great battle of wits to follow. The story of this encounter is told in "The Poisoned Goblet," the new novel by Mr. Arthur Gask, which will be published in "The Advertiser," beginning on Friday.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>

THE WARNING</h2>

<p class="first">"WE may say what we will, Mr. Larose," remarked
the thin scholarly looking man in a rather regretful tone, "but
evil in a jeweled setting is less repugnant to the human mind,
than when met with in sordid surroundings, and crime among the
well-to-do is more intriguing than breaches of the law among the
lower classes."</p>

<p>"That is quite true, Mr. Jones," replied the smiling young man
opposite to him. "Wrong doing amongst educated and refined people
seems always to have more element of adventure behind
it"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"and certainly the smells of Mayfair
are much to be preferred to those of Bethnal Green."</p>

<p>The two were closeted one morning in the private room of
Gilbert Larose, in Scotland Yard, and as usual the great
investigator, Naughton Jones, was laying down the law with his
accustomed gusto.</p>

<p>"But I am sorry to note from the reports in the Press, Mr.
Larose," he went on frowningly, "that your energies of late seem
to have been almost entirely confined to the East End; to
Shoreditch, Wapping, Limehouse and other unpleasant places."</p>

<p>"Well, I have to go where I am sent," laughed Larose, "and I
can't pick and choose like you can, now can I?"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course you can't," agreed Jones at once. A thought
seemed to strike him suddenly, and he regarded the detective with
cold and reproving eyes. "By-the-bye, although I saw you got the
Limehouse murderer in the end, still I think you were hardly up
to your usual form in that case."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Larose, rather surprised, "but I had him in
the cells within four days!"</p>

<p>Jones raised one long forefinger solemnly. "But it would have
saved you a lot of trouble if, when you had been brought to the
scene of the crime, you had at once realised the significance of
two things. The first&mdash;that according to the medical
evidence, the knife with which he had stabbed the woman and cut
her throat must have been of small size and as keen as a razor,
and the second&mdash;that the two disreputable old boots he left
behind him were odd ones and of differing sizes." He shrugged his
shoulders. "These two facts, taken together, immediately
suggested to me, as you discovered later, that the murderer was a
boot repairer by trade, for there was the sharp knife of a man
whose occupation included the trimming of leather, and there were
the odd boots that had been left behind with him upon his
informing their owners that the fellows to them were beyond
repair." He regarded Larose with the frown of a schoolmaster
reproving a pupil. "Where now, pray, would you be likely to find
nearly worn-out odd boots of differing sizes&mdash;except among
the discards in a boot repairer's shop? It is so very
simple."</p>

<p>The detective flushed slightly, "It certainly does seem so
now," he remarked slowly, "after you have pointed it out.
Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not that I have not always a great admiration for talents,"
broke in Jones quickly, "or indeed I should not be here." He
smiled coldly. "I suppose that with my well-known aversion to any
association with the regular police, except for the purely
mechanical part of effecting the arrest when I have myself run
the criminal to earth, you are wondering why I have come here at
all."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose, "for I know you are always busy and
never given to wasting any time."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Jones with a sigh, "and it is on that account
that I am here now." He passed his hand over his forehead, "I
have been overdoing it and my medical adviser, Sir Bumble Brown,
insists that I go into a nursing home for rest and treatment. I
am a nervous wreck."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so sorry," exclaimed Larose with great sympathy,
"for you will be missed by such a lot of people."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Jones significantly, "and it is in the interest
of one of them that I have come to you now." He drew his chair up
close to the detective and lowered his voice significantly. "I am
in the middle of an important case and have to drop it, because,
as I have told you, of my health, and as you are going to be sent
in my place, I am wanting to put you wise to a few things so that
you may commence your investigations under the most advantageous
conditions possible."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;going to be sent in your place!" exclaimed Larose,
looking very surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jones. "I have arranged it."</p>

<p>The detective laughed quietly. "Then you must have great
influence, Mr. Jones, to be able to dictate to the Chief
Commissioner what he is to do. I often find him hard to
manage."</p>

<p>"It is not I who really have the influence," frowned Jones,
"but a pretty society woman. It is she who has pulled the
strings; but now listen, and I'll explain everything."</p>

<p>He took a map and some papers from his pocket and laid them
before him upon the desk.</p>

<p>"Now, of course, you have heard of Lady Helen Ardane," he
began, and when Larose shook his head, he snapped, "Well, you
ought to have heard, for she is one of our best-known society
hostesses." He went on. "She is the widow of the late baronet,
Sir Charles Ardane, the big whisky distiller, and lives at Carmel
Abbey, in the north-west corner of Norfolk. She has one child,
whom she idolises, a boy of four, the present baronet. She is an
American by birth, and at the age of nineteen was married by her
parents to the late Sir Charles, a man well over fifty. She is a
very wealthy woman."</p>

<p>"How old is she now?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"About twenty-seven," replied Jones, "and, like your
Commissioner, difficult to manage, for she has been spoilt and
pampered all her life, and has red hair." He paused a minute here
as if to collect his thoughts and then went on quickly. "Well,
three weeks ago she received an anonymous letter, warning her
that the child was going to be kidnapped, and bidding her look
out."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Larose, smiling, "she herself an American and
her child going to be kidnapped. Really, it would make her feel
quite at home with us!"</p>

<p>"She took no notice of the letter," continued Jones, ignoring
the interruption, "for in the security of this country, she
believed it to be only one of those cranky communications that
people of means are always receiving, but a week after its
receipt she got a terrible shock, for, but for an almost
miraculous happening, her child would have undoubtedly been
seized and taken away."</p>

<p>"An attempt was actually made then?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No," said Jones, "an attempt was not actually made, but it
was within an ace of being made and carried to a successful
issue, too. Not only that, but from what did happen, the very
disquieting fact emerged that the would-be kidnappers were
undoubtedly in possession of inside information as to what
exactly were going to be the child's movements upon that
particular day, and that therefore there was a confederate
helping them, some where among the inmates of the Abbey."</p>

<p>He went on. "Now what took place is this, and please listen
carefully. On the Tuesday night Lady Ardane arranged with her
head nurse, a woman, by-the-bye, of unimpeachable character that
if the weather continued fine and mild the child should so on the
morrow to play on the Brancaster sands, about three miles away.
Her ladyship would be prevented from accompanying them on account
of her social duties, but a little party was to be made up,
consisting of the housekeeper, the two nurses and an elderly
chauffeur, and they were to leave after an early lunch, in one of
the Abbey cars. Well, the Wednesday turning out to be a beautiful
day, everything was carried out as arranged, and by a quarter to
two they had arrived by the sea shore and the car was parked upon
the sands. Then the women and the child went in for a paddle,
while the chauffeur, taking himself off about 250 yards, lay down
among the short grass upon one of the sandhills and proceeded to
amuse himself with a small telescope that he had brought with
him. I must mention here that Brancaster Bay is a very lonely
spot. There are no habitations anywhere near, and except when
rifle practice is going on at the butts at the far end, there is
hardly ever anyone to be seen there."</p>

<p>"I've got a good idea where it is," said Larose. "I motored
round that coast last year, and it's about five miles from
Hunstanton."</p>

<p>Jones nodded. "Yes, just over five miles. Well, the chauffeur
says he was almost dropping off to sleep, when a car, driven at a
good pace, appeared upon the narrow road, and pulled up behind
one of the sandhills, about a quarter of a mile from where he was
lying. He saw four men then get out and was at once interested in
them, because their actions were so peculiar. With bent backs and
every appearance of not wishing to be seen, they crept up the
sandhill nearest to them, and then lay down among the sand-grass
just as he was doing. One of them then produced a pair of
binoculars and it was evident at once that they were particularly
interested in the little party from the Abbey, who were paddling
on the sands. The chauffeur began to wonder what the deuce was
up."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones broke off here and asked the detective if there
were any objection to his smoking. He smiled dryly as he took the
cigarette that the detective at once offered him. "I know the
red-tape in these places," he remarked, "and I don't want to run
counter to any of their absurd regulations."</p>

<p>He went on. "Now let me see. Ah! I had got to the point when
the chauffeur was watching those four men. Well, nothing happened
for about a quarter of an hour. The men just watched the paddlers
and he watched them. Then suddenly it became apparent to him that
the man with the binoculars had all at once become very excited
and was pointing out to the others something at sea. So he put up
his little telescope and scanned the horizon too, and was at once
rewarded by the sight of a small motor yacht cleaving swiftly
through the waters and leaving behind it a broad wake of foam.
Its progress shorewards was very rapid, and barely five minutes
could have elapsed since it was first seen, so the chauffeur
estimates, when it slowed down, turned sharply at right angles
and dropped anchor, less than a hundred yards from the sands.</p>

<p>"The four men then immediately jumped up from where they had
been lying and spreading themselves out as they ran, proceeded to
race down the sandhills in the direction of the all unconscious
little party from the Abbey.</p>

<p>"The chauffeur says that instantly then a feeling of dire
consternation took possession of him, for as one who has lived
the greater part of his life in America and is conversant with
the customs of that great country, it came to him in a flash what
was about to happen.</p>

<p>"The little baronet was going to be kidnapped." Naughton Jones
paused here and smiled at the expression of absorbed attention
upon the detective's face.</p>

<p>"Looked pretty hopeless unless a miracle happened, didn't it?"
he remarked. "At least six men, and probably all of them armed,
against a defenseless elderly chauffeur!"</p>

<p>"Great Scott! it did look hopeless," exclaimed Larose.
"Hopeless to the world!"</p>

<p>Jones nodded. "But the miracle did happen." he went on, "for
just as the chauffeur was running down on to the sands to put up
what resistance he could, the roar of motor engines was again
heard among the sandhills, and two motor charabancs came tearing
up, with their passengers, about fifty or sixty strapping young
fellows, all carrying rifles. It appears it was the afternoon of
the yearly match between the rifle clubs of Holt and Hunstanton,
and they were going to shoot it off as usual at the butts on
Brancaster Sands.</p>

<p>"The charabancs stopped and the riflemen sprang down. Then the
chauffeur ran up to them, and waving his hand in the direction of
the nurses and the four men shouted 'Load up, boys, and go to the
rescue of those girls down there. Quick!'</p>

<p>"The young fellows thought it was a joke, but entering into
the spirit of the fun, they snapped at their magazines and ran
down on to the sands. The four men stopped and looked round in
amazement, and the chauffeur swears he saw two of them produce
pistols, but perceiving the crowd of armed youths swooping down
upon them, after quick signs to one another, they turned upon
their heels and sauntered back to their car. The two rowers in
the boat, also taking in what was happening, pulled round and
rowed back to the yacht."</p>

<p>The great investigator leant back in his chair. "It was all
over in three minutes, and in six the men had disappeared in
their car and the motor yacht was heading back to sea." He rubbed
his hands together. "Quite a little epic in its way."</p>

<p>"Very dramatic, Mr. Jones," said the detective, "and you told
it very nicely, too. Really, you are a born teller of stories!"
He frowned. "But it doesn't end there! Surely, they made some
attempt to arrest the men?"</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Jones blandly. "There was no evidence about
anything against them, for the nurses hadn't even set eyes upon
them until all the danger was passed. They had been too occupied
in watching the motor yacht and thinking how pretty it looked
with its wake of foam." He frowned now in his turn. "No, that's
the trouble. There was not a shred of evidence against anyone,
and the only suspicion"&mdash;he nodded solemnly&mdash;"what the
chauffeur saw."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened next?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"The chauffeur very rightly insisted upon returning at once to
the Abbey, and as a precaution went back in a roundabout way and
took two of the armed riflemen along with him."</p>

<p>"And that's all," asked Larose, because Jones had stopped
speaking, "that finishes everything!"</p>

<p>"That begins everything," replied Jones testily, "for that
same night I was called down." He tapped impatiently upon the
desk. "Yes, sir, her ladyship is no sluggard, and awakening from
her dreams of fancied security, and realising that trans-Atlantic
methods were being brought over here, with no hesitation she
proceeded to form her own bodyguard and to obtain the best
services that she could." His voice hardened. "And she is
neglecting no precautions, I can assure you, for she knows the
ghastly toll of little lives that has been taken in her own
country. She remembers the dead body of the Lindberg baby and has
no intention that her child shall be put under the ground in the
same way." He nodded solemnly again. "So, today, Carmel Abbey is
an armed camp."</p>

<p>"But why does she not leave the Abbey for a few months?" asked
Larose sharply, "for so near to that lonely stretch of coast, she
must see there is always the possibility of being raided from the
sea."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones smiled disdainfully. "You don't know Lady Helen
Ardane yet, but when you have had speech with her you will not
repeat the question. She is a woman of spirit with that red head
of hers, and not only is she refusing to leave Carmel Abbey but
she is carrying on her social duties as if nothing had happened,
and she has even made no alterations for the house party that
will begin assembling tomorrow for the opening of the pheasant
shooting on the first, although she has been warned by a second
letter that among her guests," his voice hardened sternly, "will
be another traitor in league with the kidnappers."</p>

<p>"Then with a confederate inside the Abbey, as you say,"
commented Larose, "the kidnappers must be quite aware that she is
being warned and therefore I cannot understand how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not quite aware," interrupted Jones sharply, "and
that is the only pull we have over them. They have heard nothing
of either letter, for Lady Ardane's widowhood has developed
considerable powers of self-reliance in her, and she has not
taken every one into her confidence."</p>

<p>"She has told no one!" exclaimed Larose, very surprised.</p>

<p>"Only her father, Senator Harvey, who is upon a visit to her,"
replied Jones, "and not even her aunt who lives with her. The
first letter she immediately threw into the fire, not considering
it worth mentioning to anybody. Then when the affair upon the
sands took place, she grasped instantly the supreme importance of
not letting it be known that she had a friend in the enemy's camp
and she held her tongue." He nodded emphatically. "Yes, we are
fortunate there."</p>

<p>"Then the kidnappers, not being aware that she had any
warning," said Larose, "cannot be positive that it is definitely
realised what was intended to happen that afternoon upon the
sands."</p>

<p>"Well, they must be very dull witted," scoffed Jones, "if they
did not at once become positive of that fact when they saw the
precautions that were taken at the Abbey immediately afterwards."
He thumped upon the desk. "Not positive! Why man, they knew I had
been called in, and I was shot at upon the third day, following
upon my arrival, the very first time that I set foot outside the
Abbey walls, and then the day before yesterday a second attempt
was made upon my life by a wretch endeavoring to run me down in a
big car. I was upon my bicycle and just outside the castle
grounds. Also the two Alsatian hounds that upon my suggestion
were procured to keep guard outside the Abbey, were promptly
poisoned before they had been on the place for even four and
twenty hours." He laughed sardonically. "You take it, it is not a
picnic that I am sending you down to, and they may be playing the
'Dead March' over you in much less than a week." He spoke
carelessly. "Her ladyship is most generous and is certain to pay
for a choral service."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Larose at once looking very pleased,
"then I see I shall relish the whole business, for I am sick of
going after people who commit only one crime, and then hide away
like rabbits until I dig them out." He nodded. "I admire this
red-haired woman of yours for sticking to her guns."</p>

<p>"It is the only thing she can do." said Jones with a shrug,
"unless she prefers to go on being haunted every day of her
life." He looked very stern. "She must carry on the fight to a
finish now, and not only must she break up the kidnapping gang,
but she must unmask, too, the traitors in her own household and
among her own friends." He put his finger to his lips. "Ah!
that's the trouble, for as I tell you, she can make no move in
any direction to protect the child, without its becoming known at
once to the people who are after him. We have definite proof that
they leave instantly, and I cannot, for the life of me, find out
how it is done." He appeared very disturbed. "Just as they got to
know that the child was going on the morrow to the Brancaster
sands, so they got to know that I was in the Abbey, and
so"&mdash;he threw out his hands&mdash;"I have no doubt they will
know who you are the very moment you arrive."</p>

<p>"You have been staying there a fortnight, then, Mr. Jones?"
said the detective thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"A fortnight to-day," growled the great man, "and I have never
spent two more unprofitable weeks in my life." He spoke sharply.
"You know my reputation and my methods, Mr. Larose, and if I tell
you I have discovered nothing, then you will realise that the
secret is well hidden."</p>

<p>He spread out the map upon the table. "But now for chapter and
verse, for I am going into a nursing home tonight, and have a lot
of things to arrange. See, this is Burnham Norton and there is
the Abbey, and as you have remarked, their comparatively isolated
position leaves them open to attack. Well, the affair upon the
sands took place on the afternoon of Wednesday, and at 11.30 that
night Lady Ardane rang me up. She impressed upon me the extreme
urgency of the matter, but I was not able to go at once, for I
had an appointment with a Cabinet Minister at midnight. Still, at
8.30 the next morning I was breakfasting in the Abbey."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily. "And I at once found I had a most difficult
task before me. For the moment I was not concerned so much with
the kidnappers outside, realising that the vital thing was to
discover at once who was the confederate inside the Abbey. That
was what was terrifying Lady Ardane, and I agreed with her that
there must be a confederate." He nodded emphatically. "You, too,
can be perfectly assured on that point, and you can be assured
also that whoever he or she may be, or perhaps there are two or
three of them there, they are not only able to learn all that is
going on inside the Abbey, but, as I tell you, they are in a
position to pass on that information in the most expeditious
manner possible to those who are waiting to operate outside."</p>

<p>"But why are you so certain there?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Firstly," replied Jones, "because the fact that the child was
going to the Brancaster Sands on the Wednesday was not mentioned
or even thought of until the Tuesday evening about half-past six
when he was bidding goodnight to his mother, and yet by two
o'clock on the following afternoon the kidnappers had been able
to perfect most elaborate arrangements for abducting him there.
Not only were some of them gathered in readiness among the
sandhills to prevent all chances of the Abbey party getting back
to their car, but others were approaching from far out to sea in
a motor yacht which must have been waiting a long way away,
because neither before nor after can we light upon any traces of
it anywhere along the coast. Everything, then, pointed to
preparations that could not possibly have been carried out on the
spur of the moment."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Larose, because Jones had stopped speaking.</p>

<p>"Secondly," said Jones, "because the third night after I
arrived, I happened to mention at dinner that I had thoughts of
cycling into Wells to obtain a favorite tobacco, and Lady Ardane
suggested that if I wanted to extend my excursion for exercise, I
should proceed there by way of Overy Marshes and return through
Holkhum Park. I did so." He spoke very slowly. "Well, with no
resource to the telephone, plans were made instantly by someone
to waylay me, for I was fired upon, both going and returning,
which proves conclusively that within a few minutes of my
decision, the miscreants had been informed in which particular
directions I should be proceeding upon both parts of my
journey."</p>

<p>"But perhaps you were followed from the moment you left the
Abbey," suggested Larose.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Jones sharply, "for it was bright
moonlight and I was keeping far too good a look out. No, I was
ambushed both times, and from the crack of the rifles&mdash;I am
an old rifleman myself&mdash;I was fired at with two different
rifles. On the marshes an old Mauser was used, but in the park I
don't know what was fired."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, a third happening," replied Jones, "and it is in every
way as significant as the other two. To hark back to the morning
following the attempt at Brancaster Sands, Lady Ardane had
requisitioned five young fellows of the Hunstanton Rifle Club to
come and stay at the Abbey as a temporary bodyguard, and it was
arranged they should be picked up at The Drake Hotel in
Hunstanton at 3 o'clock. She sent a car from the Abbey to fetch
them, and until they were all ready it was run into the hotel
yard. Then, when a quarter of an hour later it was proceeding at
a good pace along the Burnham Norton road, one of the front
wheels came off and a terrible accident was narrowly averted. It
was then found that the hub caps of all the wheels had been
unscrewed and the safety pins pulled out." He shook his head
gloomily. "There could not be more conclusive evidence that there
is a confederate inside the Abbey, for someone had at once passed
on the information that these men were coming out."</p>

<p>He handed a sheaf of papers to the detective. "Now, here are
some notes that I have made and they should save you a lot of
trouble. They include the life histories of the twenty-six
employees at the Abbey, and impressions I have formed of the
temperaments and characters, also my opinion of the friends of
Lady Ardane who were staying with her when I arrived and are
still there now."</p>

<p>He shook his head disgustedly. "Really, I have never fished in
more empty waters, for none of these men or women appear likely
to be taking any part against Lady Ardane. She is most popular
with everyone and the child, too. It is true that few of the
servants have a record of long service behind them, but they are
a foolish lot, and I can pick out no one among them who seems in
any way competent enough to be assisting in a conspiracy such as
this. And the same with these friends of hers now at the Abbey,
including some very uninteresting and shallow society women." He
shrugged his shoulders. "At any rate, I gave the women the 'once-over' and then dismissed them at once from my calculations." He
smiled sarcastically. "But perhaps you may be more successful
there than I have been. I am no ladies man."</p>

<p>"Well, what exactly am I being sent down for?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Mainly to determine who are the confederates inside the Abbey
and through them get a line as to where the gang are, outside,
and incidentally, help keep an eye upon the child and make sure
nothing happens to him."</p>

<p>"And those letters that Lady Ardane received?" asked Larose.
"What about them?"</p>

<p>"Both in the same disguised hand-writing and very short. The
first, as far as her ladyship remembers, 'Look out or your child
will be taken from you, but on no account let it be known that
you have been warned or I shall suffer,' and the second, received
only yesterday, 'Be on your guard more than ever now, for among
your shooting party will be another who is your enemy and the
luck may not be with you this time.' Both posted in Norwich."</p>

<p>"And she has asked for no police protection?" frowned
Larose.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones shook his head. "What would have been the good
of it? She could not have the police hanging about indefinitely,
and besides, Mr. Larose"&mdash;he looked very stern and
uncompromising&mdash;"her ladyship is, as I have told you, an
American, and she has a profound distrust of all police
officials, indeed, it was with some difficulty that I persuaded
her to ask for your services. She was very much against it at
first."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose said slowly. "And you
really must throw up the case, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jones curtly. "I must"</p>

<p>"But you and I together," began the detective,
"we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jones turned away his eyes. "I must throw it up," he repeated.
"There is no help for it."</p>

<p>"But I should have thought," persisted Larose, "that at such a
critical stage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jones turned on him angrily. "I don't want to leave it," he
said quickly. "Don't you understand that, and don't you
understand also, what two weeks of complete failure mean to a man
of my temperament? Do you think I am not sorry, too, for that
poor woman eating out her heart, and night and day expecting some
dreadful blow to fall?" His voice dropped suddenly to gentler
tones. "I am doing the best I can for her and in advising her to
ask for your services I am thereby going against all the
prejudices of my life." He frowned scornfully. "Must I again
refer to my estimation of the official police, and must I ask you
to realise how humiliating it is for me to come here this
morning? Please, please Mr. Larose, stress no more upon my
enforced departure. It is unavoidable."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Jones," said Larose quickly. "I will not refer
to it again." He glanced down at the papers on the desk. "So I am
to appear there as a guest, am I?"</p>

<p>Naughton Jones smiled a disdainful smile. "You may appear to
some people there as a guest, but if I have any grasp of the
situation at Abbey, to those with whom we are most concerned your
true identity will become known at once."</p>

<p>He pointed to the papers before them on the desk. "You will
find all your instructions there. Yes, you are to go down as a
friend of her cousin Paris Lestrange, the K.C., and you are to
call upon this gentleman straight away at his chambers in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, so that you will not be entirely unknown to
each other when you meet at the Abbey. I have just come from him
and made an appointment for you at 12.30." He looked rather
annoyed. "We had to take him into our confidence because it would
have seemed strange for Lady Ardane to have invited a man of your
age&mdash;as her friend."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is he?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones pursed up his lips. "Oh! quite reliable and all
that, but personally, one I do not particularly care for." He
frowned as if at some unpleasant memory. "I crossed swords with
him last year at the Leeds Assizes when he was defending the
forger, Stringer Blake, and although he was most rude and
discourteous to me when in the witness box, it is generally
conceded he did not come too well out of the encounter. At any
rate my evidence turned the scale and friend Stringer was sent
down for seven years."</p>

<p>"Ah! I remember now!" exclaimed Larose. "I've seen this
Lestrange in the Courts. Between thirty-five and forty, dark and
rather good-looking. He goes in for racing and owns a few horses
himself."</p>

<p>Jones nodded. "Yes, that's the fellow, and if the report
speaks true he's anxious to hang up his hat at the Abbey. Admiral
Charters, one of the visitors up there, told me last week that
he'd proposed many times to Lady Ardane and everyone knew it."
The great investigator smiled acidly. "A very presumptuous and
conceited man!"</p>

<p>"And I am to go and see him now," asked Larose, "directly I
have received that order that you told me I am about to have from
the Chief."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Jones, "I have just come from Lincoln Inn
Fields, and have arranged the appointment for you." He looked
amused. "I might mention he did not seem over-pleased."</p>

<p>Larose looked amused. "What displeased him?" he asked.
"Association with a policeman?" He laughed. "I suppose he thinks
I'll be disgracing him by putting my knife into my mouth!
Really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the telephone tinkled and he cut short what he was going
to say. He lifted the receiver and then making the reply, "Very
good, sir, I'll come at once," replaced it and rose quickly to
his feet.</p>

<p>"It's the Chief, Mr. Jones," he explained. "Just wait a minute
or two, will you. He says very little, and I don't suppose he'll
keep me long," and then, receiving a nod of acquiescence, he left
the room.</p>

<p>With the closing of the door, the gloomy look dropped at once
from the face of the great investigator, and taking a highly-colored pink newspaper out of his pocket, he began to scan down
its columns with all appearance of great interest.</p>

<p>"Hum! hum!" he remarked, "a very tricky programme with the
winners well concealed, and if anyone's not careful, he'll be
brought home a cot case this afternoon. Ho! ho!" he went on, "but
'Track-Watcher' is all at sea in these selections and that nap
for the 3.30 is indicative of very poor judgement, to my mind."
He shook his head emphatically. "'Wet Kisses' will never act in
the heavy going, and 'The Bishop' will come right away from her
as he turns for home." He snorted contemptuously. "Then, of
course, 'Maid of Orleans' will be too strong for 'The Parson's
Nose,' and 'Sweet Seventeen' will beat the 'The Unwanted Babe'
every time."</p>

<p>His contempt became accentuated as he read on. "Numbskull!
Fool! Imbecile!" he ejaculated. "So, his best bets of the day are
'Slippery Dick' and 'Dirty Dog!' Why, 'Slippery Dick' will never
get round those turns and 'Dirty Dog' just hates the mud!" He
almost gasped. "Great Scot! the man must have been intoxicated
when he picked those out and&mdash;&mdash;" But he heard someone
outside, and in a lightning movement the pink paper was back in
his pocket.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Larose returned to the room. "Yes, it's
all right," he announced cheerfully. "I'm to go and I'll be
starting in less than half an hour." He reseated himself at the
desk and went on in sharp and business-like tones. "And now,
please Mr. Jones, just tell me who at the Abbey, besides Lady
Ardane, know that I am coming down?"</p>

<p>"No one, not a soul," replied Jones emphatically, "and there,
at any rate for the time being, we are quite safe. We only
decided upon everything this morning, and our conversation took
place outdoors, in whispers, and in a part of the garden where we
could not possibly be overheard."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Larose, "then I'll get you to give me an
introduction to her ladyship at once."</p>

<p>"There's a letter among the papers there, and you'll present
it to her when you arrive."</p>

<p>"But that's not the sort of introduction I mean," said Larose.
"I want you to introduce me over the phone, so that she'll be
able to recognise my voice, and I want to say something
particular to her, as well. What's her number?"</p>

<p>Jones gave it with a frown and then sat with a very bored
expression on his face until the call was put through.</p>

<p>"Just say that you want to introduce a friend to her,"
whispered Larose quickly, when Jones was holding the receiver to
his ear. "Don't on any account mention my name."</p>

<p>Jones flashed him a look of withering scorn, and began to
speak into the mouthpiece. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;a most pleasant
journey, thank you... Certainly, everything is all right... No
thanks at all. I knew I could manage it... Now, I have a friend
here and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose had deftly plucked the receiver from his hand, and
with a smile of apology to the amazed Jones, he at once took up
the conversation.</p>

<p>"It is the friend speaking... Good afternoon... I'm sure it's
very kind of you to ask me down for the shooting, although
kangaroos are more in my line than pheasants... Still, I have
shot more than kangaroos in my time, and as I'm quite handy with
my gun, I may be a welcome acquisition to your house-party. I'm
starting almost at once, but I want to speak to you to-night,
right away from where you are now... You understand?... Yes, I
want to have a chat with you before I arrive... Let me see. Now
it's exactly 12 o'clock... Certainly, it is absolutely necessary,
and not a soul must know, until the last moment, that you are
motoring anywhere... Well, say the Royal Hotel, then... In the
lounge at ten minutes to six... Yes, I must see you. All right
then, you'll be there at ten minutes to six and please don't be
late... Oh! I shall recognise you, and I'll come up and speak to
you... Oh! one thing more. Please bring a plan of your place, if
you have one. No, that's all. Good morning."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned to Naughton Jones. "Well,
that's all right," he smiled, "and now, I shall start off with a
clean sheet."</p>

<p>"But you're giving her a journey of thirty-five miles each
way," frowned Jones reprovingly, "and you won't always find her
so complaisant. She has a strong will, and ideas of her own."</p>

<p>"Then it will be a pleasure to work with her," commented
Larose.</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes, and then Jones got up to
take his leave. "Now, you go very carefully through those notes,"
he said, "and I hope you'll do credit to my recommendation."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too, Mr. Jones," smiled Larose. "At any rate, I'll
do my very best."</p>

<p>"You've improved a lot in appearance lately, I notice." went
on Jones with great condescension. "Your face has filled out and
shows a lot more character." He nodded. "Some women might almost
call you handsome."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Jones," said Larose, with an appearance of
great humility, "I'm sure it's very good of you to say so."</p>

<p>"Well, you be most careful," nodded Jones, "for you may be all
that stands now between that poor woman and a dreadful tragedy."
He shook his head gloomily. "This morning before I came here, I
was scanning through my book of newspaper cuttings dealing with
scores and scores of kidnapping cases in America, and although I
have been quite aware of the fact for a long time, still I
realised more than ever, that the mentality of the kidnapper is
as debased as that of any type of criminal in the world, and that
he is crueller and more merciless than any jungle beast of
prey."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," replied Larose reassuringly, "and I promise
you I'll not be fighting in kid-gloves, either."</p>

<p>"And you remember for your own sake," were final words of
Naughton Jones, "that you will not be the only one with a secret
at the Abbey, or the only one who will be masked night and day."
His voice vibrated in its earnestness. "Among those smiling men
and women will be another guest who will be masked, too, and he
will be close near you every hour. He will be at your elbow as
you sit at meals, he will stalk behind you as you pass from room
to room, and he will stand by your pillow, as you toss and stir
in your troubled dreams. Yes, and he will be waiting for you to
make just one mistake. Just one little mistake, Mr. Larose, and
then his mask will drop off, and you will see in your last waning
consciousness, that all along your shadow has been death. You
understand! Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the detective when he was again alone, "and
after that I think I'll have a cigarette." He helped himself to
one out of a well filled box upon his desk and then added with a
grin. "Really it's a pity perhaps, that I bought so many, for I
may not want them all."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he was being ushered into a
beautifully furnished room which formed part of the chambers of
the rising King's Counsel, Paris Lestrange.</p>

<p>The barrister was seated before a large table upon which was
heaped in orderly disarray a number of papers, tied together with
countless pieces of the usual red tape.</p>

<p>He was dark and handsome, with a long intellectual face and
deep-set, penetrating eyes. His hair was as beautifully brushed
as if he had just come out of the barber's chair. He was
immaculately dressed and his expression was proud and rather
disdainful.</p>

<p>He rose and inclined his head ever so slightly when the
visitor was announced, and then, making no effort to shake hands,
sank back into his chair and assumed a very bored expression.</p>

<p>"This is an unfortunate business," he began in a deep voice,
"but of course you have been coached in the part you are to
play?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Mr. Naughton Jones has just been with me," he
replied. "I am to go down as a supposed friend of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the K.C., dwelling slightly upon the adjective,
"as a supposed friend." He eyed the detective critically and
asked in a haughty tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then have you had any experience of the usages of Society,
Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, all except the divorce parts," replied Larose,
annoyed at his unfriendly manner and willfully misunderstanding
the question. "Over here and in Australia I've been in the
Criminal Investigation Department for more than ten years."</p>

<p>The K.C. stared hard as if uncertain how quite to take the
reply. "But that is not what I mean," he said quickly. He frowned
as if rather worried. "Do you think, Mr. Larose, that you will be
able to pass as one accustomed to associate with the class of
people you will meet at Carmel Abbey?"</p>

<p>The rudeness of the question was patent, but the detective
repressed the anger that he felt, and continued in his previous
vein. "Yes, that will be quite all right," he said meekly, "for
only a few months back I served as a footman in the household of
the Duke of Blair when it was thought an attempt was about to be
made upon the family jewels, and no one but his Grace ever became
aware who I was. I picked up quite a lot of wrinkles then." He
smiled cheerfully. "I play a good hand of bridge, I am something
of a judge of wine, and from overhearing many conversations, I
know exactly what kind of stories are considered good form to
tell to the ladies." There was just the faintest trace of
amusement in his voice. "You need not be afraid that I shall let
you down."</p>

<p>Lestrange continued to frown, but now went off upon another
track.</p>

<p>"Of course" he said, "at Lady Ardane's request I have agreed,
as Mr. Jones puts it, to sponsor you as my friend, but at the
same time, I am by no means convinced that there is any need at
all for your services. The evidence as to any intended kidnapping
is in my opinion, most lamentably weak. The imagination of an
excitable chauffeur, the forgetfulness of some motor mechanic
when replacing those car wheels,"&mdash;he drummed upon the table
with his fingers&mdash;"and the entirely unsupported conjectures
of Mr. Naughton Jones!"</p>

<p>"But Mr. Jones says he was actually fired upon," said
Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," commented the barrister. "Still, Mr.
Jones is always positive that he is the centre of every happening
that occurs. I have had some experience with him in court." He
looked sharply at the detective. "But, never mind that. The
question is, if you are supposed to be my friend, where did I
meet you?" He screwed up his face as if he were partaking of a
dose of particularly unpleasant medicine. "What have we in
common?"</p>

<p>The detective pointed smilingly to a gold cigarette case upon
the table. "Smoking," he exclaimed with the delight of one making
a great discovery, "and you can say you met me somewhere in a
tobacconist's shop."</p>

<p>The K.C.'s eyes hardened and his face flushed. "Humor, Mr.
Larose," he began sternly, "is out of place now and I
am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, say you met me in racing circles," interrupted Larose
quickly, and speaking now in sharp and decisive tones and very
different to those he had hitherto used. "I am, of course, aware
that you are interested in racing, and I am interested, too. I've
stayed twice with Lord Garnet at his place in Newmarket, so we
can say we became acquainted there." He rose up to terminate the
interview. "Now how are you going down to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"By car of course," replied Lestrange sharply, and in spite of
his self-assurance, decidedly nonplussed by the rapid change in
the demeanor of the detective.</p>

<p>"Will you pick me up then, in Norwich to-morrow," asked
Larose, "or would you prefer that I went to the Abbey on my
own?"</p>

<p>The K.C. considered. "I had better pick you up," he said. He
smiled sourly. "That will obviate any effusive greetings when we
meet."</p>

<p>"And what time will you be in Norwich?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Lestrange considered again. "Between two and five," he replied
carelessly, and then added as if only his own convenience were to
be considered, "You will have to wait for me."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose, "then I'll be ready in the lounge of
the Royal Hotel from two o'clock onwards," and with a nod quite
as off-hand as that of the barrister's, he let himself out of the
room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>

LAROSE DRAWS FIRST BLOOD</h2>

<p class="first">LADY ARDANE was certainly a very pretty woman
and as she sat in the lounge of the Royal Hotel that evening,
warming her feet before one of the big fires, all the men who
passed through, and not a few of the women, too, thought how
attractive she looked.</p>

<p>With good chiselled features and a beautiful pink and white
complexion, she had large, clear blue eyes and the glorious,
burnished copper hair of a Raphael-painted angel. She was of
medium height and her figure was graceful and well-proportioned.</p>

<p>Ordinarily of a rather imperious expression, just now she
looked annoyed as well, and she tapped impatiently with her foot
every time she glanced at the watch upon her wrist.</p>

<p>"Seven minutes late, already," she murmured, "and he told me
to be sure and be there on time."</p>

<p>Suddenly then, she saw a smartly dressed youngish looking man
enter the lounge at the far end and turn his head interestedly
around. His glance fell upon her, and immediately he began to
thread his way through the chairs in her direction.</p>

<p>"But that can't be he," she thought instantly. "That man is
much too young and not a bit like a detective. He looks
educated."</p>

<p>But the young man approached unhesitatingly, and then with a
bow and a pleasant smile, pulled a chair up close and sat down
beside her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm late," he said, speaking in low and modulated
tones, "but there was a little bother in getting a place for my
car. Still, I'm only eight minutes behind. It hasn't struck six
yet."</p>

<p>Her heart beat unpleasantly, and with a little catch in her
breath, she regarded him without speaking. He was alert and
intelligent-looking, with keen blue eyes and a good chin. He
smiled as if he were amused.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's quite all right," he said. "I'm Mr. Larose."</p>

<p>She spoke at last, and holding herself in, asked coldly, "And
how am I to know that!"</p>

<p>He laughed lightly. "Well, you left the Abbey at five minutes
to five; you motored here alone; your carburettor needs
adjusting, and that"&mdash;he pointed to a roll of brown paper in
her lap&mdash;"is the plan of the Abbey that I asked you to bring
with you. Also"&mdash;and he took a letter from his
pocket&mdash;"this is the introduction from Mr. Naughton
Jones."</p>

<p>She frowned. "And in that case," she said quickly, "I must
tell you that I am rather troubled, for I believe I have been
followed here. There was a car behind me all the way, and it made
its pace to mine. When I slowed down, it slowed down, too, and
when I accelerated&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's quite all right," he interrupted. "You needn't worry
there. It was I who was behind you. I wanted to make sure you
were not going to be followed, and so drove over to the Abbey
this afternoon and waited among that clump of trees, just as you
turn into the road, to see you come out." He shook his head. "But
it was unwise of you to come alone, for they are just as likely
to try to get hold of you."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane flushed. She was annoyed at having expressed any
anxiety, and yet at the same time comforted at this proof of the
thoroughness of the man who had been sent to help her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I made you uneasy," smiled Larose, "and I
kept a long way behind, hoping that you would not notice me." He
saw her embarrassment and went on, "But that carburettor of yours
certainly wants adjusting, for as you slowed down, coming out of
the Abbey ground, you were back-firing badly."</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded, with an effort to appear unconcerned. "I
saw my engine was running hot."</p>

<p>He looked up at the clock. "Well, what about going in to
dinner? I'm hungry and we can talk better there. I have booked
two seats in a corner, where we shall not be overheard."</p>

<p>She shook her head coldly. "No, thank you," she replied. "I
want to get back as soon as possible. I'm not interested in meals
in these times and I'm not at all hungry."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Larose. "I saw you getting a piece of
chocolate out of the automatic machine just now, and besides, I
can't think properly if I'm not fed." He laughed. "We can both
pay expenses for ourselves, or else I'll pay and put it down in
the expenses. So, you'll be under no obligation to me, either
way."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and then rising reluctantly from her
chair, preceded him into the dining room.</p>

<p>"What would you like to drink?" he asked, when they were
seated at the far end of the long room. "It's my birthday to-day,
and I'm 29, so I feel inclined to celebrate it."</p>

<p>"Anything will do for me," she replied, all at once becoming
most annoyed that she was going to dine tete-a-tete with a
detective from Scotland Yard. She ought to have persisted in her
refusal, she told herself, and would let him see most plainly
that she was in no way interested in any of his conversation,
except that strictly appertaining to the matter that had brought
them together.</p>

<p>But she had been really hungry, and the dinner being a good
one, under the mellowing influences of the food and wine, she
soon found herself unable to keep up the haughty attitude she had
decided upon.</p>

<p>The detective had at once assumed the role of host, and
critical as she was, she had to admit that he filled it very
well.</p>

<p>He was quite easy and natural, and in his manner there was
nothing lacking in what she was accustomed to in her own circle.
Apart from that, indeed, he was far more interesting and
entertaining than most people she was usually brought in contact
with. He was entirely unassuming, too, and with all his obviously
would-be friendliness, there was not the slightest familiarity
about him, and if she saw, as she did, that from time to time he
was appearing to be taking her in admiringly, there was yet
evidently no intention on his part that he wanted her to be aware
of it.</p>

<p>He talked of books and plays, of race meetings and the places
he had visited in England; he told her about Australia, and the
differing conditions of life and climate there, and altogether
she soon realised she was far from finding his company
disagreeable.</p>

<p>He seemed just a light-hearted and easy-going young fellow,
with no cares or troubles at all.</p>

<p>But the instant the waiter had served the coffee and left
them, his whole manner changed. His face hardened his chin seemed
to become firmer an his eyes lost their smiling look.</p>

<p>"Now, Lady Ardane," he said sharply, "we'll talk business, and
please only answer my questions, for you must be starting for
home in half an hour. I shall return with you, and come back by
the late train from Burnham Market. No, I insist upon that, and
you must, please, bow to my judgment. It was foolish of you to
come here quite alone, for with all your courage you are a woman,
and also, incidentally would be quite as valuable a hostage as
your child."</p>

<p>"But I could not have brought an army," she retorted, "and
against a gang, surely one companion would have been of no use at
all."</p>

<p>"I don't know so much about that," he replied, "for they might
hesitate about murder, with you as an eye witness. Well," he went
on quickly, "about these kidnappers, I take it the only motive
for them wanting to get your child can be that of ransom? You
have no enemies, and it is not a question of revenge? Oh! none
that you know of, and no one would benefit either by the death of
your son. Yes, Mr. Jones told me the baronetcy would die out
then. Now, how did Sir Charles leave his money?"</p>

<p>She looked annoyed at this line of questioning, and hesitated,
but after a moment replied coldly.</p>

<p>"Equally between me and my son, his portion being, of course,
held in trust until he comes of age."</p>

<p>"And the estate was a large one?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I am quite well to do."</p>

<p>"I only asked that," said Larose, "to assure myself that the
ransom they are after may be large enough to induce them to
persevere, for you see a number of men with cars and a motor
yacht require some financing." He shook his head. "The man behind
all this must have ample means at his command." He looked sharply
at her. "Now, another question, please, it is three years since
you lost your husband is it not!" He spoke in cold, level tones.
"Well, in your circumstances I expect you have had suitors
since?"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane's eyes flashed. "Because of my money, you mean?"
she asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," replied the detective, repressing a smile,
"but you have had them, of course."</p>

<p>"Plenty," she replied laconically, then she added, "but I have
no intention of remarrying, and all my friends know it."</p>

<p>"Then is it not possible," suggested Larose, "that in
rejecting the advance of some one of these suitors, you may have
incurred his enmity?"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed again. "Not for a moment," she replied. She
tilted her chin disdainfully. "My friends are gentlemen, Mr.
Larose."</p>

<p>The detective ignored the rebuff as if he were quite unaware
one had been intended. "Now to another side of the matter," he
said, "and although I am quite sure Mr. Jones will have gone over
the ground here, still I must satisfy myself upon one or two
points." He regarded her intently, making a mental note how
pretty she looked when she was angry, and spoke very slowly.
"Now, after you had told the head nurse when the child was with
you that night, that she should take him upon the sands on the
morrow, I understand she is certain she made no mention of the
matter to any one until she was in the act of getting into bed,
and then she told the other nurse. That is so?"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane nodded, and the detective went on. "And both
nurses are sure it was not referred to again until the maid was
clearing away the nursery breakfast, which would be about half
past eight."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane nodded again. "And the girl who cleared the
breakfast away," she added, "is positive she did not speak about
it to anyone until she went down into the servants' hall for
morning lunch, which would make it about half past ten. She was
busy with her rooms, upstairs, and would have had no opportunity
of speaking to anyone until then."</p>

<p>"And where were you that evening when the child was bidding
you good night?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Where I generally am, for a few minutes, every evening about
that time," she replied, "in my writing room, a little boudoir
that leads out of my bedroom. I attend to any private letters
then that have come in the late afternoon post-bag, and need
answering by the mail that night."</p>

<p>"Could your instructions to the nurse by any possibility have
been over-heard?"</p>

<p>"Most improbable, for the door would almost certainly have
been shut, and the window is eighteen to twenty feet above the
ground."</p>

<p>"And about the bringing of those riflemen from Hunstanton,"
asked Larose, "when did you decide upon that?"</p>

<p>"About half past ten the next morning."</p>

<p>"Did you discuss the matter with anyone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was in the library, with my father, Senator Harvey,
Sir Parry Bardell, a great friend of mine who lives near the
Abbey and is the co-trustee with me of the Ardane Estate, and
Admiral Charters, another old friend. Then I sent for my head
chauffeur, the one who was with the car that afternoon upon the
sands, and he was back before noon, with everything
arranged."</p>

<p>"And where were you when he told you what he had done?"</p>

<p>"In my boudoir again, with my secretary, Miss Wingrove."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose went on. "And I
understand from Mr. Jones that since this trouble began every
telephone call has been checked at the exchange, and every one
satisfactorily accounted for. There is no possible chance then
that whoever is acting as the spy inside the Abbey can have
passed on his information through that channel."</p>

<p>"No, we can be quite certain of that," replied Lady
Ardane.</p>

<p>"And I see from these notes Mr. Jones has given me, that as a
Mr. Ernest Maxwell, the friend of your cousin, I have come from
Australia, and am supposed to have made a fortune in sheep out
there." He smiled. "Very nice, if it were only true."</p>

<p>He folded up the notes, and placing them in his pocket, became
very stern again.</p>

<p>"Now, Lady Ardane," he said solemnly, "it is evident that we
are up against very determined men. But as we have seen, they
will resort to any means to obtain their ends. The sanctity of
life is apparently nothing to them, and they will take any act of
violence in their stride, as a matter of course. Unhappily, too,
up to now they have been in a position to forestall every move
that you have made to protect yourself." He nodded emphatically.
"Well, we are going to stop all that, and now I am going to be an
unknown force working against them, in exactly the same way as
they have been an unknown force working against you."</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and said, "I am taking it for granted,
as Mr. Jones told me, that no one in the Abbey knows that I am
coming down."</p>

<p>"No one," she replied quickly. "Not even my father, Senator
Harvey, who is upon a visit to me, and who is very prejudiced
against calling in the official police, nor my aunt, who lives
with me. No reference has been made to your coming at any time
except when Mr. Jones and I were discussing the matter in the
garden."</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "Good!" he said, "then from the moment
when I set foot in the Abbey you will forget that I am a
detective, and regard me only as one of your guests. We must
never be seen holding a private conversation together."</p>

<p>"Now," he went on, "you give me three minutes, and I'll leave
the hotel first. Then you call for your car, and pick me up by
the cathedral. I shall be just outside the main entrance."</p>

<p>They parted in the lounge, but a few minutes later were
seated, side by side, and speeding swiftly along the road towards
Burnham Norton. It was a fine night and there was a good
moon.</p>

<p>"We need not worry about anything until we have passed
Fakenham," said the detective, "and after that, if you don't
mind, I'll take the wheel."</p>

<p>They drove on in silence, each busy with their own thoughts.
Larose inhaled the delicate perfume that emanated from her hair
and sighed softly. It was so incongruous, he thought, this dainty
and beautiful woman and the evil forces he was there to
combat.</p>

<p>A short distance from Fakenham, he said, "Now, please."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane slowed down and the exchange of seats was
effected. "But I don't consider it necessary," she said coldly,
"nor either, as I have told you, that you need have put yourself
out to come with me."</p>

<p>The detective did not argue the point. "Well, you look out of
the window at the back," he said most politely, "and take
particular notice as we pass the by-roads to see if any car is
parked up there."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane made no comment, contenting herself with a
disdainful smile, but if it had been in her nature to ever feel
sulky, she would have felt so then. However, she twisted her head
round and did as she had been requested.</p>

<p>Nothing then happened for a few miles, and she was upon the
point of remarking to the detective how unreasonably apprehensive
he had been, when, just as they had passed a field bordered by a
thick hedge, she saw a light waved three or four times and with
no delay, but with some reluctance, she informed the
detective.</p>

<p>"But it's gone now," she added quickly, "and perhaps it was
only a farm light."</p>

<p>"And perhaps it was not," snapped Larose. "At any rate, I'm
taking no chances to-night," and so approaching a bend in the
road before them, he immediately slowed down to a little above
walking pace. Then suddenly he began to tug fiercely at the
steering wheel.</p>

<p>"Hold steady," he called out sharply, "I'm going to turn.
There's a car half blocking the road in front, and it looks as if
two men are stretching a rope across."</p>

<p>Then things happened very quickly, for he had hardly turned
the car round and straightened up, when a man carrying a
hurricane lantern came bursting through the hedge about fifty
yards in front of them, and springing over the ditch, jumped on
to the road. Instantly then the detective accelerated, and drove
straight at him. For a couple of seconds or so, it seemed that
the car would hit him, but he tumbled back into the ditch just in
time, and they could hear him swearing and shouting furiously as
they passed.</p>

<p>"But you didn't intend to purposely run him down?" gasped Lady
Ardane.</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," replied the detective. "Didn't you see what
he had got in his other hand? Ah! here it comes," and they heard
three sharp reports, and a bullet pinged somewhere on the back of
the car.</p>

<p>"We'll go back to Fakenham," called out Larose, "and
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Lady Ardane quickly, "there's a lane
just past these trees, and we can turn into that and escape. We
are not three miles from the Abbey now."</p>

<p>They turned where she indicated and speeded along the high-hedged lane as quickly as the car would go, but very soon Lady
Ardane, looking back through the window, called out with a quiver
in her voice, "They're coming after us, they're not far
behind."</p>

<p>"Well, they won't catch us at the rate we're going now,"
called back Larose. "We must be very nearly at the Abbey."</p>

<p>But all at once the engine began to run unevenly and the car
to jump and lose pace.</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore Larose. "She's misfiring. We've got a dirty
plug." His voice rose sharply. "Quick! tell me how far they are
away."</p>

<p>"Three hundred yards at the most," replied Lady Ardane,
steadying her voice with an effort, "and they're getting much
nearer."</p>

<p>The detective was quite cool and collected. "I'm going to slow
down," he said, "and you must take the wheel. Don't get flurried,
and we'll give them a surprise."</p>

<p>He almost stopped to allow her to slip into the driving seat,
and then, a moment afterwards, came the crash of breaking
glass.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he called out, "but that was me. I had to break the
window to use my gun. Now go for all you're worth up that
hill."</p>

<p>A few seconds passed and then, just as they were topping the
rise of a small hill, for the second time that night a bullet
impinged upon the back of the car.</p>

<p>"It's quite all right," said Larose calmly. "No harm's done
and our turn's coming now. Slow down, please, for I must catch
them as they come over the hill. I don't want to be too far away.
Now, steady. Here they are."</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack, and three bullets sped through
the little window.</p>

<p>"Ah!" shouted Larose exultingly, "I got one of their tyres and
they've turned into the ditch. Gad! but they almost went over.
Yes, they're finished with, and you'll get home this time. Now,
quick, go as fast as you can."</p>

<p>He dropped back into the seat beside her and went on
cheerfully, "Quite a nice little scrap, and it'll make them more
careful in future." He looked intently at her. "But I hope you
weren't very frightened."</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;dreadfully," she faltered, "but not as much as I
should have been if I'd had anyone but you with me. Mr. Naughton
Jones told me you would shoot your best friend if you thought it
necessary."</p>

<p>"Exactly," laughed Larose, "but only if I thought it
necessary." He became serious again. "But now just go about half
a mile and then pull up and drop me. I'll hop back and if I'm
quick I may get a look at them and see what make their car is,
and get the number. I don't suppose the car'll be much damaged,
for that ditch wasn't more than a couple of feet down and the
hedge would act as a buffer, but still it will take a few minutes
to get it out and change the tyre and I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane was aghast. "But you're not going back," she
cried. "Why, they'll kill you."</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "I'll take care of that," he said. "They won't
see me." He went on quickly. "Now the instant you get home ring
up the Fakenham police and tell them part of what's happened.
Just say an attempt was made to waylay you and that you were
fired upon. Don't mention anything about me and don't say I fired
back. Tell them exactly where the car went into the ditch." He
shook his head. "I don't think there's the ghost of a chance of
them getting here in time, but still we must try it. Ah! here we
are at your corner and now you'll be quite safe. Pull up,
please."</p>

<p>They had come out of the lane and through two fences on either
side of a narrow road were turning into a wide expanse of meadow-land, with the beautiful outlines of Carmel Abbey about half a
mile away, silhouetted against the moonlit sky.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane brought the car to a standstill. "But I don't like
your going back," she said breathlessly. "I think it very
foolish."</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall be quite all right," said Larose. "Now how far do
you think it is to where we left them? About a mile or a little
more? Well, goodnight, until to-morrow. I must run."</p>

<p>He had gone a few steps when she called out quickly. "Wait,
Mr. Larose, I want to speak to you," and when he turned with a
frown, she pointed to a shed under some trees, about a hundred
yards away. "If you must go," she went on, "there's a bicycle in
that shed, belonging to one of the gardeners, and you can borrow
it. The door will be locked, but the key is generally left under
one of the big stones that you'll see outside."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the detective. "Thank you very much. Now
you get home and ring up, quickly. Goodnight."</p>

<p>She drove off and he ran over to the shed she had indicated.
He found the key under one of the stones and was quickly inside.
He was just wheeling the bicycle out, when, noticing a couple of
jackets and some very dirty overalls hanging upon the wall, an
idea struck him.</p>

<p>"Good!" he ejaculated, "better and better, and I shall be able
to play the exact part. If they're still there, I'll go up and
have a little talk."</p>

<p>He took off his jacket and slipped on one of the overalls,
then, with a grimace, he put on one of the ragged coats and also
changed his neat brown shoes for a pair of very clumsy boots.</p>

<p>"Awkward to bicycle in," he remarked, "but still it's not for
a great distance." He took off his wrist watch and put it in his
pocket. "Not nine o'clock yet, and I shall have plenty of time to
get back and catch the 10.45 at Burnham Market,"&mdash;he smiled
to himself&mdash;"that is if I come back at all, and if I
don't,"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"well, nothing will matter, as far
as I am concerned."</p>

<p>Mounting his bicycle, he shot like an arrow into the road, but
he had not gone a couple of hundred yards before he almost ran
over a small dog that was chasing a rabbit. The dog caught the
rabbit and then immediately a lad of fifteen or sixteen, who was
carrying more rabbits over his shoulder, dashed through the
hedge. The boy almost dropped in dismay when be caught sight of
the detective, and for the moment seemed as if he were going to
bolt.</p>

<p>But Larose jumped off his bicycle and stood before him.
"Hulloa!" he said. "What's this! Poaching, eh?"</p>

<p>The boy looked very scared, and receiving no reply, the
detective went on, "Never mind. I won't squeal. How many have you
got?"</p>

<p>"Foive," replied the boy in great relief at the friendly
tones.</p>

<p>"Well, give me a couple and here's a tanner for you." With no
demur the boy at once complied and the sixpence was passed over
in exchange.</p>

<p>"Now cut away quick," said Larose, and with the scampering off
of the young poacher, he stuffed one rabbit in each of the
capacious pockets of his ragged coat, and mounting the bicycle,
pedalled swiftly on again.</p>

<p>"Very nice," he chuckled, "and now I shall be quite above
suspicion."</p>

<p>In a few minutes his heart began to beat a little quickly,
when turning a bend in the lane, the car that he was looking for
came suddenly into view. It was about 300 yards away and, no
longer in the ditch, it stood now in the middle of the lane with
all its lights extinguished. Two men were kneeling by one of the
front wheels and he could hear a sound of hammering. One of the
men was holding an electric torch.</p>

<p>"Changing the tyre!" he whispered. "Then I must hurry or
they'll be getting off."</p>

<p>Jumping from the machine, he quickly soiled over his hands and
face from the ditch-side and then riding on for another 150
yards, dismounted again at the foot of a small hill and began
pushing his bicycle slowly before him.</p>

<p>The hammering still continued, and approaching nearer to the
car, he was so taken up with trying to see all that was going on
that he did not hear a man push through the hedge behind and pad
softly after him.</p>

<p>Suddenly then he found himself gripped tightly by the back of
the neck and a stern voice demanded. "Now then, what are you
doing here?" and at the same time he felt something very like the
muzzle of a pistol, poked into the small of his back.</p>

<p>He swore under his breath at his carelessness, and shivered in
real earnest. But he did not lose his wits and made no attempt to
struggle.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," he called out in frightened tones, "I'll go
quietly. Who are you? Mr. Thomson?"</p>

<p>The grip upon his neck was let go, and turning shakily he
found himself gazing into the cold eyes of a very determined-looking man of big build and with a very square jaw. The man was
holding one hand behind his back.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" snarled the man, "and who's Mr. Thomson?"</p>

<p>"I'm Mat Capper, sir," whined Larose, "and I thought you were
the constable, Mr. Thomson."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing here," went on the man, "and what
are you sneaking along like that for?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't sneaking along, sir," replied Larose, "and I was
just walking up the hill because I'm short of breath. I've been
very ill lately."</p>

<p>The man eyed him doubtfully. "Well, you must stand where you
are," he said gruffly. "Not a movement and don't you turn your
head. Perfectly still, you understand," and he made a long, low
whistle in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>The detective felt a most unpleasant tightness in his chest.
"He's got a gun in his hand, right enough," he thought ruefully,
"and my conscience, if they search me and find mine!"</p>

<p>For a few moments, then, the two stood facing one another and
a cloud starting to cross the moon, the man stretched out and
grasped the detective by the arm, with the evident intention of
making sure that he should not bolt away in the darkness.</p>

<p>The sound of hammering still came from the direction of the
car.</p>

<p>Then the detective heard quick footsteps behind him and a
second man came running up and flashed the rays of an electric
torch full upon his face completely blinding him with the
glare.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the newcomer in a low fierce whisper. "Who
is he?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied the square jawed man quietly, "but we'd
better make darned sure and find out."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" came the whispering voice, and the detective
thought it sounded like the hiss of a snake.</p>

<p>"Mat Capper, sir," replied the detective once again. "I'm a
farm hand and I work for Mr. Andrews, at Willow Bend."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked the whisperer, and certainly with no
friendliness in his tones.</p>

<p>"At North Barsham, sir. About three miles from here."</p>

<p>"And what are you doing at this time of night?"</p>

<p>The detective hesitated and made his breathing appear quick
and jerky, then he blurted out, "Only after a rabbit or two,
sir," and in proof of his statement he pulled out the rabbits he
had thrust in his pockets, and held them up for inspection.</p>

<p>Both men immediately touched them. "Yes, they're warm," said
the one holding the torch, very slowly, and as if weighing up
everything in his mind. Then, after a moment's silence, he went
on sharply, but still in a very low tone. "A farm laborer are
you? Show me your hands." Then his arm darted out and he seized
the detective in a grip of iron. "Damnation! you scoundrel!" he
swore, "those are not the hands of a farm laborer. You're lying
to us. You're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the detective broke in with a sharp cry. "No, no, sir," he
gasped. "I'm only speaking the truth. I tell you I've just come
out of hospital. I've had my lungs bad for three months and have
done no work. That's why my hands are so smooth." He almost wept.
"I'm an honest chap, sir, except for these rabbits."</p>

<p>At this display of such obvious fright, the rage of the man
with the torch appeared all suddenly to die down, but he did not
relax his grip and the detective realised quite well that he was
still in great danger. A pistol was pointed, not ten inches from
his heart and he had even heard the slipping back of the safety
catch. He knew they were desperate men that he was interfering
with, and from their actions that night, violence of every form
was undoubtedly no stranger to them.</p>

<p>A sweat burst out upon his forehead.</p>

<p>His interrogator, who appeared to be the leader, was evidently
of two minds. "A farm hand, you say you are," he said at length,
very softly and then with all his quietness, he rapped out a
question like a bullet from a gun. "How long then does a sow
carry her young?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen weeks, sir," replied Larose, making his legs even
more shaky than they were.</p>

<p>"And a sheep?"</p>

<p>"Five months, sir. Five months and three days."</p>

<p>For a long minute the man stood motionless as if still
unconvinced and then suddenly he let go the detective's arm and
pushed him roughly away. "Get," he said, "and go back the way
you've come. No, leave your bicycle here. We'll take care of
that. I dare say it's been stolen, like the rabbits. Now, get
quick, and don't you dare to look round, or else&mdash;&mdash;"
He turned to his companion. "Follow him and put a bullet in him
if he does."</p>

<p>With a great thankfulness in his heart and yet furious that he
had not been able to approach near enough to discern either the
make or the number of the car, Larose made every appearance of
going off with as much haste as possible. The moon was now clear
again and with all his courage he dared not look round, not
knowing if there were anyone just behind him.</p>

<p>Then all at once he heard the car being started up, and from
the sounds that followed he knew that it was being backed and
turned. Risking everything, he looked back over his shoulder. No
one was following him, he was alone in the lane, and in the
distance the car was just moving off in the direction of the main
road.</p>

<p>"And I don't even know what make it is," he exclaimed, "nor
which way it is going, or how many men are in it. So any ringing
up Fakenham will have been quite useless, for we can't identify
the car."</p>

<p>He retraced his footsteps in the hope that after all they
might not have gone off with his bicycle, and found, as he had
half-expected, that it had been left behind. It had, however,
been thrown into the ditch and not only that, but all the wind
had been let out of the tyres.</p>

<p>"The beasts!" he ejaculated, "and there's no pump on it!"
Pushing it before him, he walked disgustedly back to the Abbey
grounds, and regaining the shed without encountering anybody,
changed into his own clothes. Then, with plenty of time to spare,
he made for Burnham Market, and catching the 10.45 train, was in
Norwich again before midnight.</p>

<p>The following morning, as he was not due to arrive at the
Abbey until the late afternoon, he spent some time in the public
library, reading up from a local Guide Book all he could about
Carmel Abbey.</p>

<p>Amongst other things he learnt that Sir Charles Ardane had
bought it about ten years previously and apparently much regret
had been expressed at the time that he had turned it into a
private residence.</p>

<p>However, apparently, as little interference as possible had
been made with the outside appearance of the Abbey, the general
scheme of the rebuilding having been to erect a modern residence
within the old walls. A very large sum was supposed to have been
expended upon the restoration, and the building now contained an
enormous number of rooms.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock he paid a friendly visit to the
Superintendent of the Norwich police, with whom he had a slight
acquaintanceship, and informed him that he was on holiday and
motoring round the eastern counties.</p>

<p>They talked of matters in general for a few minutes and then
the detective asked casually, "And how's business? Anything
doing?"</p>

<p>"Not too brisk," replied the Superintendent with a smile.
"Just jogging along with an occasional murder or burglary every
now and then to liven us up"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"but mostly
drunks and petty larcenies." He shook his head frowningly. "Ah!
but we had a rather disquieting call last night." He looked very
impressive. "One of our county notabilities, a pretty society
woman, phoned up that an attempt had been made to waylay her when
she was returning home in her car and that she had actually been
fired upon, on the high road."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Larose, "was it a fact?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said, the Superintendent gravely, "the Fakenham men
report there are certainly two marks upon the chassis of her car
that look like bullet ones"&mdash;he screwed up his
eyes&mdash;"and there are other disturbing features as well about
the case."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," said Larose. "The wickedness of this world
is always more interesting than the good."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened was this," said the Superintendent, "Lady
Ardane, of Carmel Abbey"&mdash;he broke off&mdash;"have you ever
heard of her?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied Larose, "very beautiful and very rich; the
widow of Sir Charles Ardane. I've seen her at Ascot."</p>

<p>"That's she," nodded the Superintendent, "a lovely woman, with
red hair. Well, last night at half-past eight or thereabouts,
when about a mile and a half from the Abbey, a man in another car
shouted to her to stop, and when she took no notice of him, he
set off after her and fired two shots with the evident intention
of puncturing her tyres. Then something happened to his car and
it ran into a ditch and she got away. Immediately then, when she
reached home, she attempted to ring up and report to us what had
happened, but found to her consternation that she could not get
the exchange. She kept on ringing, she says, for quite five
minutes and then realised that something must be wrong, sent
round to the garage and one of the chauffeurs dashed into Burnham
Market, the nearest town. The police there at once got in touch
with Fakenham, and two men immediately went out to where she said
the car was ditched." He shrugged his shoulders. "But what was
the good of it? It was nearly ten o'clock by then and of course,
the car had gone."</p>

<p>"Was it only one man who was after her?" asked Larose
innocently, and desirious of getting the Superintendent to talk
as much as possible.</p>

<p>The Superintendent looked very disgusted. "She doesn't know,"
he replied. "She knows nothing, neither the appearance nor the
number of her pursuers, what they wanted, nor what the car was
like, and all we know is that her car was undoubtedly hit twice
and that the wires of the Abbey telephone were deliberately
cut"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders again,&mdash;"Heaven alone
knows why."</p>

<p>"The wires cut!" exclaimed Larose in startled surprise. "The
telephone wires cut at the Abbey!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Superintendent, "and just outside the main
door, too." He shook his head. "Really, it's very strange, and if
we could be certain there was any connection between the two
happenings I should not be too easy in my mind." He frowned
uneasily. "In any case, I tell you I don't like the idea of gun-men in my district."</p>

<p>They chatted on for a few minutes and then the detective left
the police station, like the Superintendent, very disturbed and
uneasy in his mind.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled when he was out in the street, "but I'm
certainly up against something very hot here, and there's no
doubt about a confederate being inside the Abbey." He looked very
grave. "Someone must be watching her every minute. She was marked
down directly she left home; arrangements were then made to get
hold of her as she returned, and the wires were cut, so that in
the event of the kidnapping being successful, as long a time as
possible should elapse before her absence could be notified to
the police." He whistled again. "Yes, I shall have to be darned
careful what I am about."</p>

<p>Larose had still an hour to spare before lunch, and annoyed in
some way by the memory of the immaculate appearance of Paris
Lestrange, he visited a couple of hosiery shops, and among other
items purchased some quite unnecessary and very expensive silk
ties.</p>

<p>"He looked at me like some strange animal," he thought
angrily, "and so I'll let him see I can dress quite as well as
he, with all his aristocratic and wealthy surroundings."</p>

<p>Passing a jeweller's shop, he stopped idly to look at the many
attractive things displayed in the window, and his eyes happened
to fall upon a large gold cigarette case, reposing upon a cushion
of white silk. The case was beautifully chased and jewelled in
one corner.</p>

<p>"Better than that one of Lestrange's," he murmured, "and would
cost a lot of money."</p>

<p>For a few moments he could not take his eyes off it, and then
suddenly an idea striking him, he grinned, and proceeded to walk
briskly into the shop to ascertain the price.</p>

<p>"Seventy-five pounds," said the Jeweller, scenting a good
customer, and all smiles. "It's a lovely piece of work," and he
at once went to the window and took it out.</p>

<p>The detective handled it admiringly. "But &pound;75," he
remarked, "is a lot of money!" Then he said hesitatingly. "Now,
if I take it and bring it back any time within a month, will you
return me the money, less, say, 10 per cent?"</p>

<p>The jeweller hesitated. "You want to hire it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, not necessarily," replied Larose. "I like it very much
now, but I may get tired of it, and then it would be a lot of
money to have thrown away."</p>

<p>The jeweller hesitated in his turn. "Yes, sir," he said at
last, "you can take it on those terms, but, of course, it must be
returned to me in the same condition in which it is now."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose. "I understand that. But," he went
on, "I'm a stranger to Norwich, and am only passing through, so,
of course, I'm not carrying that amount of money on me"&mdash;the
jeweller's amiable expression at once vanished and was replaced
by a stern frown, "but if I write you a cheque, and bring a
responsible person in to guarantee it, I suppose that will be all
right?"</p>

<p>"A responsible person," replied the jeweller with a pronounced
emphasis upon the adjective.</p>

<p>"Good," said the detective, "then I'll be back in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>Returning quickly to the police station, he sought out the
Superintendent and told him what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Superintendent at once, "I'll give
him my cheque and take yours in exchange." He smiled slyly.
"You're going to buy an engagement ring, of course"&mdash;he
sighed&mdash;"and I only wish I were young myself, and going
through it all again."</p>

<p>He accompanied Larose to the jeweller's, and the latter upon
seeing him was at once all smiles and amiability again. Cheques
were exchanged and the cigarette case made over, but the
Superintendent professed great disappointment that the purchase
was not an engagement ring.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" he exclaimed, when they were out of the shop, "but
nobody would take you for a detective with that cigarette
case."</p>

<p>"No," laughed Larose, shaking hands in parting, "and that's
just what I want. Good-bye."</p>

<p>By two o'clock he had finished his luncheon and was sitting in
the lounge of the hotel awaiting the coming of the barrister.
Tired of watching the people continually passing through, he
presently picked up one of the London morning papers, and began
idly to scan down its pages.</p>

<p>Suddenly then his attention was arrested upon a name in the
social column, and with astonished eyes he read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We regret to learn that the well known private Investigator,
Mr. Naughton Jones, has been suddenly taken ill and removed to a
nursing home."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he ejaculated, "and won't old Jones be furious
if he sees this. It looks as if those wretches had got to learn
of it, and out of bravado given the paper the tip to make
inquiries."</p>

<p>He returned to the hotel to await the coming of the barrister,
but the latter did not put in an appearance until nearly four
o'clock, and then made no apology for the tardiness of his
arrival.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>

THE SHADOW OVER THE ABBEY</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night during dinner, his first meal at
Carmel Abbey, in the brief intervals of chatting with his
charming and vivacious neighbor, a Miss Patricia Howard, Larose
philosophically considered whether the possession of ample means
was to be desired above most things, and he came to the
conclusion most definitely that it was.</p>

<p>"It is all nonsense," he reflected, "for people of no means to
keep on repeating like parrots that money isn't everything, as if
it were no good at all, because we get nearly all our happiness
from what money brings, and without it we are poor things and
have a rotten time."</p>

<p>He looked round the room and sighed with great contentment.
"Now, tonight is typical of what money can give! Here am I in the
most comfortable surroundings possible, with every opportunity to
snatch a most perfect hour from the sadness of this vale of
tears. I am banqueting in the company of distinguished-looking
men and beautiful looking women, and everything about me is
conducive to comfort and happiness. The food is delicious enough
to satisfy the most exacting taste, the wines are a very nectar
of the gods, the room is as beautiful as that of any medieval
church and I am being waited upon as if I had been crowned a
king." He nodded emphatically. "Yes, it is good to be alive to-night."</p>

<p>He went on. "And this delightfully pretty young woman who was
consigned to me to escort into the meal and the gleam of whose
white shoulders is so disturbing to me every time I turn my
head&mdash;well, she is very gracious to me and smiles and shows
her dimples whenever I speak. She is wishing, of course, that I
should form a good opinion of her and she continually droops
those pretty lashes for me and flashes at me with those violet
eyes. But undoubtedly she does all this because she assumes that
I am of her own class in wealth and position." He shook his head
sadly. "Now if she knew who I really was, and the exact figures
of my very modest banking account, then&mdash;good
gracious!&mdash;there would he no more dimples for me, no more
pretty smiles and those white, gleaming shoulders would surely
stiffen up and lose all their friendly pose." He drew in a deep
breath. "Yes, money is a wonderful thing to have."</p>

<p>He looked round the large and sumptuously furnished room
again. "And how perfect the service is here, and how beautifully
the harmony of everything has been fitted in! Those maids in
their dainty uniforms are as pretty as butterflies themselves,
and there is not one of them who is not good to look upon. Why,
endowed with high sounding names and a bit of money, as far as
appearances go, they could any moment with equal distinction take
their places among the guests! And the footmen! Quite refined and
certainly the best type of their class! They glide rather than
walk and their bearing is courtly, as if they had acquired grace
by attending to the wants of emperors and kings."</p>

<p>He smiled. "And the butler! Ah! I must not forget him. He
certainly does not seem to do much, except stand behind his
mistress's chair, but I note his head is continually turning
round and round, with his eyes everywhere upon the menials whom
he controls. He is like a great general, directing a field of
battle, and the men-servants advance and retreat, and go this way
and that, upon the slightest movement of his eye." He nodded.
"Yes, no doubt he is among the great masters of his calling."</p>

<p>He looked towards the head of the table. "And Lady Ardane
herself! The mistress of it all. She is certainly lovely to-night
and her beauty outshines that of all the other women here. The
soft candle lights are poor rivals to that red head of hers and
their timid rays show up the ivory of her skin to the perfection
of a lover's dream." He sighed once more. "Yes, she is very
lovely, but what good is all that loveliness if she will give it
to no one to delight in? Is all the romance of her life closed
and will she never in abandon again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his reflections were suddenly broken into by the silvery
voice of his partner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell!" exclaimed that young lady with a great
assumption of indignation, "I have spoken to you and you did not
answer! I do believe you were looking at the maids."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Larose instantly. "I was just thinking how
beautiful our hostess is to-night."</p>

<p>"She is always beautiful," commented the girl sharply. She
tilted up her chin mockingly. "And I don't believe there's a man
here, married or unmarried, who would not run off with her to-morrow, if he could only get the chance."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Larose, "but is she as devastating
as all that?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied the girl laughing. "Why, look at the
reverence with which the great Sir Arnold is regarding her, and
by nature he is as cold as a fish."</p>

<p>"Which is Sir Arnold!" asked Larose at once.</p>

<p>"Oh! I forgot," exclaimed the girl. "Of course, you don't know
us all yet." She nodded. "Sir Arnold Medway is that very handsome
man talking to her now. He is one of the great surgeons of the
world, and Royalty are among his patients." She lowered her voice
to a whisper. "He is supposed to have received seventy thousand
guineas last year for going over to India to operate upon that
Rajah's wife. But isn't he distinguished looking?"</p>

<p>Larose regarded the fine, strong face of the man she indicated
and agreed that he was, for not only, the detective thought, was
the great surgeon handsome, but his whole demeanor suggested that
in whatever walk of life he was, he would excel.</p>

<p>The girl went on. "Come now, I'll be nice to you and tell you
everything about everybody you want to know."</p>

<p>"Well, that dark man," asked Larose at once, "right opposite
to us, with the girl in pink? Mr. Daller is, I think, his name.
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"The Bernard Daller, the air-man," was the reply, "and a dare-devil if ever there was one. He's crashed more times than anyone
knows, and he still carries on as if he liked it." She smiled
archly. "Another devoted slave at the foot of Helen Ardane."</p>

<p>"And that man with the big glasses, who is always smiling,"
asked Larose, "the one with the bald head?"</p>

<p>"Sir Parry Bardell, and Helen's greatest friend," Replied the
girl. "He lives close near here, just across the meadows. Founded
the Bardell line of steamers and used to own them all. Retired
now, and a most eligible bachelor in spite of the absence of
raven locks." She pretended to look very sad. "I set my cap at
him every time we meet, but it's quite hopeless for he'd marry no
one but"&mdash;she sighed&mdash;"Helen again." She turned
smilingly to the detective. "But he seems rather interested in
you, for I've noticed him look this way several times."</p>

<p>"At you, of course," smiled back Larose, "and I can quite
understand it, for except for being able to talk to you, I'd
rather sit opposite to you every time."</p>

<p>"Quite nice of you, I am sure," laughed the girl. "Now, is
there anyone else you are curious about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that tall, big man, a friend of Senator Harvey, I
believe."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I know very little about him," She
replied, "except that he's an American and his name is Rankin,
Theodore Rankin. He only arrived yesterday. He's a wheat fiend, I
think, for he comes from Chicago, and was arguing about crops and
prices all the morning with the Senator."</p>

<p>"Another person," said Larose, "that bronzed man over there
upon the left? I haven't noticed him until dinner to-night."</p>

<p>"Clive Huntington, a naval engineer. He's a friend of Sir
Parry, who, of course, has only come in for the evening. Still
you'll be seeing a lot of Sir Parry for he is always in and out
of the Abbey, looking after the affairs of the estate."</p>

<p>"Is there a lot then to look after?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, yes!" exclaimed the girl, opening her eyes
very wide. "Why, Helen rules over more than ten thousand acres,
and all the villages round here belong to her."</p>

<p>Miss Howard was a very intelligent and observant young woman,
and by the time the meal was over the detective was in the
possession of many facts that would otherwise have taken a long
time to collect. She gave him thumb-nail sketches of almost
everybody there, and her comments, he thought, were shrewd and
very much to the point.</p>

<p>The evening was passed with music and bridge, and, in view of
the shoot upon the morrow, the company dispersed early and by
midnight everybody had retired to their rooms.</p>

<p>But it was not bed-time for Larose yet, for at twenty minutes
after midnight he was to have a talk with Lady Ardane in her
boudoir, which was next to his own room. She was going to tap
upon the wall when she judged it would be safe for him to come
in.</p>

<p>He was not too pleased somehow with Lady Ardane, for her
manner towards him when they had been enabled to have two words
together had been stiff and formal, and as icily cold as if he
were a complete stranger and it were necessary for him to be kept
at a distance.</p>

<p>He had been formally introduced to her in the lounge, in front
of them all, by the very casual and off-hand Lestrange, and she
had received him graciously and hoped he would enjoy his stay at
the Abbey, but then, when a few moments later, he had spoken to
her when no one was close near, she had informed him in the
manner of a mistress speaking to her servant, and a female one at
that, that she had arranged for his room to be next to her suite,
in case she should require his services. Then when he had said
that he wanted to have a talk with her and would need to know in
which particular room everyone was sleeping, she had told him as
if she were speaking to a block of wood to come to her's after
midnight.</p>

<p>Yes, he was annoyed with her, for her manner was so off-hand,
and as if she were quite oblivious to the services he had already
rendered her.</p>

<p>He sat before the radiator and considering everything,
notwithstanding his usual buoyancy of disposition, was in no very
cheerful frame of mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am being handicapped in many ways here," he told
himself, "for apparently I am to ask no questions of anyone. As a
guest myself, I cannot, of course, talk to the servants, and my
fellow guests are undoubtedly intending to ignore the fact that
there is any shadow over the Abbey, and hold it bad taste to want
to discuss it. That charming Miss Howard shut me up at once when
I referred to it, and the old Admiral almost pretended to know
nothing about it when I started to ask him about what had taken
place that afternoon upon the Brancaster sands."</p>

<p>He shook his head frowningly. "Now there is something most
sinister about this whole business, for it must be that the arch-traitor lies near home and when I uncover him I shall probably
find he is no stranger to this poor woman whom he is terrifying.
Indeed, he must be on intimate terms with her, for if there be
any truth in the second warning she has received, his influence
is such that he has actually been able to arrange for an ally to
be received here as another guest." He thought for a moment.
"Then he must be the master-mind directing the whole conspiracy,
for it is not likely that anyone in the position of an intimate
friend of the family here would be the paid tool of a
professional gang outside."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and paced softly up and down the room.
"But if the conspiracy originated here and its master-mind has
been here all along, then surely the solution of the problem
should be very easy, for only five of the men whom I saw to-night
at dinner were here at the time of that attempt to kidnap the
child, Admiral Charters, Sir Arnold Medway, Lord Wonnock, Sir
Parry Bardell and Senator Harvey." He whistled softly. "Ah!
Senator Harvey, the most inconceivable of them all and
yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was silent for a long while. "And this second conspirator
among the newcomers, who then is he? Is he the airman, Daller;
Rankin, the American, the friend of the Senator, or Clive
Huntington, the friend of Sir Parry?"</p>

<p>He went on. "And where did this gang spring from, this gang
which we know for certain must consist of, at least, six men? Was
it called specially into existence to kidnap the Ardane child, or
did it exist before, and were its energies simply diverted from
other nefarious projects to this?"</p>

<p>He nodded emphatically. "Yes, yes, it certainly existed
before, and I must therefore consider who here would have been
most likely to have been able to get in touch with it."</p>

<p>But suddenly he heard a muffled tap upon the wall, and at once
switching off his radiator, he tiptoed to the door and passed out
into the corridor. It was only a few steps to Lady Ardane's
boudoir, and he could see a faint light under the door. He
drummed softly with his finger-nails and the door yielded
noiselessly to his touch and he stepped into the room, closing
the door again as noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>The boudoir was half in shadow, for the only light was that of
a cowled reading-lamp upon the desk. The door leading to the
bedroom was pulled to, but not shut. Lady Ardane put her finger
to her lips. "Speak quietly," she ordered, "for my son is very
restless to-night." She was standing by the desk, and beckoning
the detective to approach, did not, however, invite him to sit
down.</p>

<p>"Well, did you see those men?" she went on sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them and spoke to two of them," replied Larose,
"but that was all. They stopped me and I did not get near their
car."</p>

<p>"Then you did no good," she said almost as if she were
annoyed.</p>

<p>"No," said the detective, "except that I should recognise one
of them again. They threatened me with a pistol and I could do
nothing with that pointed against my chest. I tell you these are
desperate men, who came after you last night." He was nettled by
her manner and went on, speaking as sharply as she had spoken.
"Now, I want to know about that telephone wire, please. I heard
in Norwich this morning that it had been cut."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was cut," she said, "and there have been two
detectives here nearly all day, questioning the servants about
it." She bit upon her lip. "The publicity is dreadful."</p>

<p>"It was cut by the main door, I understand," said Larose.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Someone fetched a ladder from the garage, when
dinner was being served, and cut the wires, ten feet up. He put
the ladder back after he had used it, but the detectives saw the
gravel marks upon it. They say he must know all the arrangements
of the house, and are certain it must be one of the
servants"&mdash;she shook her head&mdash;"but whatever they
think, that is impossible, for the movements of all the men can
be accounted for at the time it must have been cut." She bit upon
her lip again. "It is a terrible thought to know that I have such
an enemy here."</p>

<p>"But it mayn't have been a man," suggested Larose. "It may
perhaps have been a woman."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane shook her head. "No, it is a heavy ladder, twelve
feet in length, and it must have been a man."</p>

<p>"And how do you know it was done during dinner?" asked the
detective.</p>

<p>"Because Senator Harvey rang up the chemist just before
dinner, at a quarter to eight, and at a quarter to nine, when I
went to ring up the exchange, it was dead."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose said quietly, "Well,
now I shall have to ask you some questions that you may not like,
but the situation in my opinion is so grave that I cannot allow
any feelings of sentiment to hamper me in my work."</p>

<p>"Feelings of sentiment!" exclaimed Lady Ardane quickly, as if
she had not heard aright. "What on earth do you mean?" She spoke
angrily, and it was evident to Larose that her nerves were all on
edge. "What, pray, has any sentiment to do with what you are here
for?"</p>

<p>"Oh! you'll understand what I mean in a minute," replied the
detective. "Now, please tell me at exactly what time they went
into dinner last night."</p>

<p>"At a quarter to eight," was the frowning reply. "They had
waited a quarter of an hour for me and then, as I had told my
aunt, Mrs. Chalmers, I might be delayed, she gave orders for
dinner to be served."</p>

<p>"And who were actually present at the meal?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane considered. "My aunt, Mrs. Chalmers, Mrs.
Challans, Miss Howard, Miss Montgomery, Lord and Lady Wonnock and
Sir Arnold Medway. It was a small party because Senator Harvey
was indisposed and Admiral Charters had gone to bed with a bad
cold."</p>

<p>"A bad cold!" exclaimed Larose. "He was lively enough to-night."</p>

<p>"But he thought he was sickening for one and he's always
nervous about his health. As a matter of fact, he sent for Sir
Arnold in the middle of dinner to go up and see him."</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed, and then Larose said grimly, "Now
for the sentiment, your ladyship." He paused for a moment, and
regarding her intently, asked quickly, "Are you on good terms
with your step-father?"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane returned his intent gaze. "Certainly," she replied
haughtily.</p>

<p>"And you always have been?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose, "and please don't get angry now, is there
any insanity in Senator Harvey's family?"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane drew in a deep breath and looked furious. "What do
you mean?" she gasped. "Are you out of your mind yourself?"</p>

<p>The detective looked very uncomfortable. "Lady Ardane," he
said firmly, "it will be a dreadful thought for you but it must
be one of only five people who has all along been your enemy in
this house, for if we leave out the servants, there have only
been five persons here in a position to betray you as you have
been betrayed&mdash;Senator Harvey, Lord Wonnock, Sir Arnold
Medway, Admiral Charters and Sir Parry Bardell. They alone were
present here before the beginning of this trouble, and if we rule
out the motives of ransom and revenge, then it can be only
insanity that has urged one of them on to attempt this dreadful
wrong." He raised one hand in his earnestness. "Think&mdash;if
Mr. Jones is right, and from the notes that he has given me I am
inclined to believe that he is, and none of the servants are
involved, then who else but one of the five I have mentioned can
have been the one who is helping these wretches outside."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible!" gasped Lady Ardane. "All these
gentlemen you mention are proved friends of mine. They are dear
friends of long standing and every one of them would give his
life for me." She gasped again. "My step-father, above all
people, for he has been the same as if he were my own parent,
from my childhood's days! Good heavens! what suspicion have you
against him?"</p>

<p>"You tell me he was not at dinner last night," replied Larose
grimly "you say the ladder was used by a man, you are sure all
the men servants are accounted for"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"well, however improbable, I must consider
everyone, one by one."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane made no comment. She had sunk down into an
armchair and was lying back as if all the spirit had been taken
out of her.</p>

<p>The detective went on, but speaking now with great sympathy,
"Come, your ladyship, just answer my question without any
comment, and then we'll soon be finished with the unpleasant
part. Now, no insanity in the Senator's family? None at all?
Well, tell me about Admiral Charters&mdash;none there either? And
how long have you known the Admiral?"</p>

<p>"Since my marriage." was the low reply, "but my husband had
known him since his boyhood."</p>

<p>"And he is a man of substance, in no need of money?"</p>

<p>Then Larose dragged out of her all she could tell him of her
guests, and among other things that the Admiral was wealthy and
one of the directors of Lloyds Bank, that Lord Wonnock was a rich
north country iron magnate and a pillar of finance in the city
and that Sir Arnold Medway's income must run into many thousands
of pounds.</p>

<p>"And now for the last of them," said the detective, "this Sir
Parry Bardell who has had his eyes upon me the whole of the
evening."</p>

<p>"The life-long friend of my husband," replied Lady Ardane
weakly, "and my greatest friend, too. He has the affection for me
of a father." A little of her spirit began to come back and she
laughed scornfully. "You may as well suspect me myself."</p>

<p>The detective frowned in disappointment. Everywhere he seemed
to be up against a dead wall. He proceeded to try in another
direction now.</p>

<p>"And this second enemy," he asked, "this newcomer who,
according to your last warning, was to join up among the shooting
party to help enemy number one. Tell me, please, about the later
arrivals, and particularly about Mr. Daller and Mr. Huntington,
for either of these gentlemen might perhaps fill the bill."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Larose," said Lady Ardane with icy politeness,
"for Mr. Daller is a particular friend of mine and has stayed
here several times and upon more occasions than I remember has
flown me to Paris and the South of France. As for Mr. Huntington,
he certainly is a stranger to us all here, but as he has been in
Sir Parry's service on his vessels ever since he was a boy and is
a personal friend of Sir Parry, too, that speaks for itself."</p>

<p>Then for half an hour and longer, Larose questioned her, and
before he had finished, every one of her guests had been passed
under review.</p>

<p>A short silence followed and the detective said thoughtfully,
"Then as far as I can see, it all amounts to this. Your guests
are all of impeccable character, your servants are all above
suspicion"&mdash;he smiled dryly&mdash;"and yet there is someone
here, as callous and pitiless a malefactor as you would find
anywhere in the world of crime." He regarded her curiously. "But
surely, Lady Ardane, you must be suspicious of someone yourself.
You know the traitor must be among those we have been talking
about, and in your own mind you must have had doubts about
someone."</p>

<p>Instantly Lady Ardane's face fell and the spirit seemed to go
out of her again. The lines of her body lost all pose of self-reliance and she looked the very picture of distress.</p>

<p>"I have no suspicions, Mr. Larose," she whispered piteously,
"for I can by no possibility conceive of anyone willing to do me
this wrong. I know with you that someone here is my enemy and
that he is only biding his chance to strike another blow, but
thinking it over night and day&mdash;and I am always thinking of
it&mdash;I have no suspicions of anyone, no distrust at all."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the detective gently, touched by her
distress, "we'll find him sooner or later, and at any rate they
shan't get your child whilst I am here." He shook his head
slowly. "But you know, with all these people to watch, I think
that in many ways it would have been better if I had come down
here in my official capacity, for then I could have gone openly
everywhere, and asked questions where I wanted to. As it is,
although my anonymity certainly has its advantages, it hampers my
search in too many ways."</p>

<p>"But that will remedy itself," said Lady Ardane with the ghost
of a smile, "for if Mr. Jones is right, they will soon find out
who you are, and then you will be able to have a free hand."</p>

<p>"With a bullet inside me, perhaps," commented Larose grimly,
"for that seems to be how their discoveries of identities becomes
known."</p>

<p>"But when they found that Mr. Jones was here," asked Lady
Ardane plaintively, "why did they try to injure him? And why did
they try to cause a fearful accident to the car that was bringing
out those men from Hunstanton? Why did they want to let me know
they were up to every move I was making to protect my son?"</p>

<p>"Probably only frightfulness," replied the detective promptly,
"just to make you realise that they don't mind to what extremes
they go, so that if they get either you or the child in their
clutches, you will be so terrified that you will come to terms
with them at once." His face frightened. "Still, they've not got
either of you yet and we're not beaten by a long chalk. Now,
please, give me the numbers of the bedrooms where everyone sleeps
and I'll get to work at once."</p>

<p>Back in his own room the detective went carefully through the
list she had given him, and his face lost a little of its worried
expression.</p>

<p>"Now, if there's any reliance to be placed on human nature,"
he whispered, "the boss of this conspiracy will want to have a
talk to-night with his new hand, when he thinks everybody is
asleep, so I'll just mark all their doors and in the morning see
who have left their rooms during the night."</p>

<p>He crept out into the corridor and, one by one, low down upon
the jambs of every door of the men guests affixed a minute piece
of plasticine. Then he returned to his own room and setting his
mind to awake before dawn, threw himself upon his bed to try and
snatch a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>But he need not have worried about waking up in time, for his
sleep was very troubled, and half a dozen times, at least, he
stirred himself to look at his watch.</p>

<p>Then a few minutes before five he got off the bed and made his
way into the corridor again to examine the traps that he had set,
and he frowned in great perplexity when he saw what had
happened.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four doors had been opened during the night,
those of the Senator, the American, Rankin, Daller, the airman,
and that of the handsome and debonair naval engineer, Clive
Huntington.</p>

<p>"Great James!" he exclaimed, when he was back again in his own
room, "but can half the gang be here? Now, what the devil were
all these people after, moving about in the night?"</p>

<p>At breakfast time it was pouring with rain, and it looked
highly improbable that there would be any going out that day, so
following upon the meal, the party proceeded to amuse themselves
in their own particular ways. The detective joined Senator
Harvey, Mr. Rankin and Sir Parry Bardell in the library, and for
an hour and more they discussed everything in general.</p>

<p>Finally, the detective came away very disappointed, for none
of the three, he had reluctantly to confess to himself, exhibited
the slightest signs that they would for one moment be mixed up in
any criminal conspiracy.</p>

<p>Sir Parry was just a quiet gentleman, with courtly, early
Victorian manners. He was charming to talk to, and was so
unassuming that, with all the undoubted strength and character in
his face, the detective found it difficult to associate him with
the authority he must have wielded to have gained the outstanding
success in commercial life that he had.</p>

<p>Theodore Rankin was apparently nothing other than a shrewd,
level-headed business man, most patently anxious to enjoy himself
among the historic surroundings of the Abbey, but all the time
chafing under his enforced absence from his beloved Chicago.</p>

<p>Senator Harvey, the detective did not like very much, for the
stepfather of Lady Ardane was inclined to be haughty, and distant
in his manner and several times Larose had caught him frowning in
his direction, as if he were not too pleased that he, Larose, was
there.</p>

<p>"A stuck-up man," was the detective's comment, "and as I have
no title or ancestors that he knows of, then I suppose I am not
good enough for him." He shook his head. "Still, he doesn't look
a man who'd be mixed up with a gang."</p>

<p>Leaving them still talking in the library, and with a certain
project in his mind, the detective obtained a small pair of
binoculars from his room and made his way along the long
corridors towards the old belfry. He knew how to reach it without
going outside the Abbey from the plan Lady Ardane had given him,
and he was minded to get some idea of the surrounding country
from its tower.</p>

<p>"For it is just possible," he told himself, "if they do not
use the telephone and yet are able to communicate so quickly with
one another, that they are resorting to some kind of signaling,
and if they do, then the high tower of the belfry would be the
very place."</p>

<p>He soon arrived at the door shutting off the modern part of
the Abbey from that which had been left almost untouched, and
started to mount the steps of the tower. He reached the big room
where the bells had once been and was negotiating the ladder that
led to the little room of the tower above, when he suddenly
became aware that there was someone already up there, for he
heard the sounds of feet shuffling upon the wooden floor and then
a loud cough.</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo!" he ejaculated, "now who on earth can have come
up here, and what does he want?"</p>

<p>A few steps higher and with his head now level with the floor
of the room, his eyes fell upon a man, with his feet planted
wide, leaning out across the broad sill of one of the windows
looking seawards, and peering intently through a pair of large
glasses. The man was holding an unfolded handkerchief in his
hand.</p>

<p>For a few seconds, not being able to see his face, the
detective did not determine who the man was, but then from his
broad shoulders and the general outline of his figure, he knew
him to be Admiral Charters.</p>

<p>The Admiral had not heard him, and Larose waited longer than a
minute to see what he was going to do with the handkerchief, but
then, nothing happened, and not wishing to run the risk of being
caught watching so intently, he coughed in his turn, and climbed
up into the room.</p>

<p>But the Admiral was still so engrossed with his observations
that it was not until the detective was almost up to him and he
had probably then been disturbed by the shaking of the very
ancient floor-boards, that he turned with a start and, open-mouthed in his surprise, surveyed Larose with all the
consternation of a child who had been caught in a guilty
action.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, very red in the face, "but you gave
me a shock. I've never known anybody else come up here
before."</p>

<p>"You haven't?" remarked Larose carelessly. "Well, I just came
up to have a look at the view, although it's certainly a bad day
for it."</p>

<p>"You're right there," agreed the Admiral, and now furtively
stuffing the handkerchief back into his pocket, "but I came up to
have a peep at those destroyers. They're making heavy weather and
it reminds me of my own bad days upon the sea."</p>

<p>Larose advanced to the window and putting his own glasses up,
swept them quickly round in the hope of noticing something of
more interest than the destroyers the Admiral had pointed out. He
was realising with a little quickening of his heart how admirably
the situation, not only of the belfry tower, but of the whole
Abbey itself, would lend itself to the exchange of signals with
anyone outside, for the historic building was on slightly rising
ground, and the view of a dozen and more habitations across the
meadows and over the marshlands was clear and uninterrupted in
the direction of the sea.</p>

<p>He scanned quickly over every house in sight, but except for a
woman leading a saddled horse into a stable of one of them, about
a mile away, there were no signs of life to be seen anywhere. He
turned sharply and caught the Admiral looking at him in a
peculiar manner. The old man at once began to talk very
quickly.</p>

<p>"Most interesting country this," he said boisterously,
"because of its association with Anglo-Saxon times. All along the
coast every place has got its little bit of history. Now you see
that hut there across the marshes, Overy Marshes they're called,
well, it's on the site of an old Danish camp that is more than a
thousand years old."</p>

<p>"No one lives there, of course," said the detective.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but someone does," replied the Admiral. "Old Henrik,
the fisherman, has been there years and years, and that's his
boat upon the foreshore. Funnily enough, he's a Dane himself and
he's got quite a romantic history. He was master of his own ship
once and it was wrecked here more than thirty years ago, when he
was quite a young man. He was the only survivor. He lost
everything and his wife was drowned. He went half out of his
mind, they say, and they couldn't get him away from the spot so
they subscribed and bought him an old boat and he's been there
ever since. A darned good fisherman, but he wears his hair long
and is supposed never to have a wash. He brings his fish up to
the Abbey sometimes."</p>

<p>"And those other houses on the shore," asked the detective,
"they look very dilapidated, are they inhabited?"</p>

<p>"Some of them are," replied the Admiral, "but most are empty."
He pointed with his arm again. "But I notice two men have lately
come to that stone one nearest the camp. They are the usual
sporting chaps, I suppose, and have come after the wild duck." He
laughed. "They're deuced early if that's their game, for the duck
won't be here in any number for some weeks yet."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the detective, interested at once, "then how
long have those men been there?"</p>

<p>The Admiral considered. "About a month, I should say. I've
been staying here now for seven weeks and I didn't notice them at
first." He smiled and pointed to a quantity of cigarette butts
upon the floor. "I'm often up here for an old sea-dog can't keep
his eye very long away from the sea. Hullo!" he went on, looking
out of the window again, "here comes Sir Parry out in the rain."
He laughed. "There are two things that occupy Sir Parry's mind.
His big telescope and our gracious Lady Ardane, and I almost
think that the telescope comes first."</p>

<p>"That's his house then with the long windows at the top,"
commented Larose, pointing to a high pagoda-like structure about
half a mile away. "What a queer-looking place for a wealthy man,
as he is said to be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's a bachelor and lives there all by himself,"
said the Admiral.</p>

<p>"What! no servants," exclaimed Larose,</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, two," was the reply, "but they live in another
building, a hundred yards and more away behind those trees. He
won't have them sleeping in the house. One's almost stone deaf
and the other is a deaf-mute." The Admiral chuckled. "Sir Parry's
quite a woman-hater except for Lady Ardane."</p>

<p>For half an hour and more Larose remained up in the tower, and
when ultimately the two descended together he had almost as good
an idea of the surrounding country as if he had tramped it on
foot. The Admiral had been coming to the Abbey for several years
and there was not a village that he did not know something about,
or a creek with which he was not familiar. He chatted so openly,
too, about everything, that although the detective was certain he
had not come up there solely to look at those destroyers, and
also that the matter of the handkerchief was suspicious, still he
could hardly bring himself to believe that the old man was one of
the plotters.</p>

<p>Returning into the Abbey and parting with the Admiral, Larose
came upon Lestrange, alone in the library. The barrister was
reading, and after a quick look at the detective, lowered his
eyes again upon his book, but Larose went up to him and said
quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anyone been curious about me?"</p>

<p>Lestrange favored him with a cold stare. "What do you mean?"
he asked. His lips curved to a contemptuous smile. "People in our
class, Mr. Larose, do not display their curiosity about fellow
guests, whatever may be their private thoughts."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the detective in no way abashed, "then no one
has asked you anything particular about me?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply with a cold smile, "and no one has even
mentioned your cigarette case."</p>

<p>Proceeding into the lounge, the detective, under the pretence
of warming himself before the fire, drew up a chair close to the
airman and Clive Huntington, who were talking earnestly together,
and he noted they abruptly broke off their conversation as he did
so. Also, the airman frowned slightly, as if he were annoyed at
their being disturbed.</p>

<p>However, Clive Huntington at once began to ask Larose about
Australia, informing him that he had twice been there himself.
The young naval engineer had very nice manners, and as the
detective regarded his open and handsome face, he thought with a
pang that it would be very hard to associate so pleasing a
personality with any form of heartless crime.</p>

<p>But of Bernard Daller he did not form quite so good an
opinion. He was good-looking certainly, and no one could deny the
atmosphere of courage and capacity that surrounded him, but
still, the detective thought him to be just the type of man who
would be disposed to take risks other than those in the air, and
risks, too, that might be of a very questionable nature.
Certainly he was a cold gambler, for the previous night at bridge
he had been wanting to play for higher stakes than were agreeable
to any of the others.</p>

<p>They chatted for a few minutes and then the Senator and his
friend, Rankin, came and joined them, and the detective realised
suddenly with a start that all the four men who had left their
rooms during the night were now gathered round him, and for some
reason they were all undoubtedly interested and curious about
him.</p>

<p>Daller continued to eye him frowningly, Huntington never
wanted to leave him long out of the conversation, the Senator was
taking good note of everything he said and putting in a searching
question every now and then, and the large, placid eyes of the
American were always turned upon him.</p>

<p>Presently he took out his cigarette case and passed it round,
and Rankin, being the last one to handle it, after he had taken
out a cigarette, continued for a few moments to interestedly
examine the case.</p>

<p>"My!" he exclaimed, "that's pretty." He held it up for the
brilliants to catch the light, and then added as he passed it
back&mdash;"But when you've had it a little while, you'll find
it'll show the scratches badly. That high carat gold always
does."</p>

<p>Larose flushed with annoyance. He had played a bad card, for
this shrewd-looking man had dismissed with a word all pretension
that a seventy-five guinea cigarette case formed part of his,
Larose's, daily life.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, as if to compensate for his
discomfiture, he became positive that he was now the centre of a
little comedy in which two sets of players, both upon their own,
were trying to find out all about him; the Senator and Rankin on
the one hand and the airman and Clive Huntington upon the other,
with the curiosity in both cases being shared by the respective
partners.</p>

<p>That they were all trying to turn him inside out he was
certain, for whenever the Senator asked him a question about his
life in Australia, Rankin immediately supplemented it with a
further one, and whenever Daller, who had now thrown off his
frown and was all amiability, wanted to be informed about
something, Huntington invariably chipped in for a more detailed
form of reply.</p>

<p>It was exactly, he thought, as it they were all doubtful if he
were what he was making himself out to be and were putting him
well through the 'once over,' and he wondered with a grin, which,
however, he instantly suppressed, if he did not come too well out
of the ordeal, from which of the two parties he would be
receiving a bullet in due course of time.</p>

<p>And he certainly would have been highly gratified with himself
if he had heard the remark that the airman made to Clive
Huntington as later on they were all trooping into lunch.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand that fellow," said that dashing
gentleman quietly. "He's altogether too plausible and innocent
for a man with those eyes and that facial angle."</p>

<p>After lunch the weather began to clear up a little and someone
suggested that they should go for a blow by the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, do let us go," exclaimed Patricia Howard with
animation. "Let's go over to Holkham Bay and see if old Henrik
has caught any fish."</p>

<p>"Yes," supplemented Sir Arnold Medway, "and I ought to have a
look and see how the old chap's hand is getting on."</p>

<p>So, soon after three, five car-loads of the guests, along with
Lady Ardane and the little baronet, proceeded in the direction
suggested, the detective being in the car driven by the great
surgeon and containing Miss Howard, Mrs. Charters and the very
affable Rankin.</p>

<p>The girl was full of energy and talk, and for the benefit of
Larose and the American gave them full details of the romantic
history of the lonely fisherman at the hut upon the Danish
Camp.</p>

<p>"And he's never been really right since," she added, "for he's
like a child in many ways and even after these thirty years has
only picked up a few words of English. He understands what you
say but cannot answer back."</p>

<p>Their short journey was soon over and their cars were parked
upon the sands of Holkham Bay. There was no sign of old Henrik or
his boat, however, and proceeding to his hut, as they expected,
they found it empty.</p>

<p>"But look what a place to live in," said Lady Ardane, "for
over thirty years. No comforts and not even the bare necessities
of life, and yet he appears quite happy."</p>

<p>And certainly there could not be much comfort about the hut,
for it contained no furniture of any description. Empty boxes
formed the table and chair of the old man, and where he kept his
few battered and dilapidated cooking utensils. In one corner
there were a quantity of old sacks, and scattered about
everywhere were his lobster pots and nets. A number of empty
bottles were heaped in a corner.</p>

<p>"And those are the great consolation of his life, ladies and
gentlemen," said Sir Arnold with a smile. "Rum, just rum, for I
am sorry to say our friend often gets very drunk. He half severed
one of his fingers a couple of weeks or so ago, when he was in
that condition, and it was quite accidentally that I noticed his
injury and gave him some treatment the other day."</p>

<p>Returning on to the sands, they passed within a hundred yards
of the stone house Admiral Charters had pointed out to Larose
that morning as being now the dwelling-place of two newcomers to
the marsh, and the detective had a good look at it as they went
by. Smoke was rising from one of the chimneys and he was half-minded to go up for a closer inspection and even to make some
excuse and obtain word with anyone there, but he thought better
of it, determining to make a secret investigation later on.</p>

<p>Arriving upon the seashore, the little party became aware of a
boat just coming round a spit of sand that jutted out into the
sea, and it was immediately seen to be that of Henrik.</p>

<p>They waited for him to pull in, and as soon as the boat
grounded the old man sprang out, and seeing Lady Ardane among the
little group awaiting him, shouted eagerly. "Bacco, bacco, me
have good fish."</p>

<p>He was certainly a most disreputable looking old fellow, tall
and gaunt and with cadaverous features, hollow cheeks and
toothless gums. His hair was long and matted and drooped over his
face and almost down to his shoulders. Around the fingers of one
hand was tied a filthy rag.</p>

<p>"And he was said to be very handsome once," said Miss Howard
with a grimace of disgust, "and see him now."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at your hand, Henrik," said the great
surgeon firmly, "and not a cigarette until I've attended to it.
Come up to the car. I've got a fresh bandage there."</p>

<p>The hand was re-bandaged, and from the fish in the boat Lady
Ardane pointed out which she wished to take.</p>

<p>"But put them in a bag, please, Henrik," she said, "and be
quick about it because it's going to pour with rain in a minute,"
and with the sweeping up of a threatening cloud from over the
sea, they all hurried back towards the cars.</p>

<p>The old man, shouldering his basket of fish, disappeared into
his hut, to emerge again, however, very quickly with the selected
fish in a small sugar bag.</p>

<p>The ladies of the party had already seated themselves in the
cars, but some of the men were still standing about to finish
their cigarettes. Henrik tied the bag of fish on to the luggage
grid of Sir Arnold's car, and with the rain beginning to fall in
real earnest now, everyone proceeded to take their places.</p>

<p>It happened that Larose and the airman were the last two to
make for their respective cars and the detective, a few paces
behind the latter, suddenly became aware that someone was pulling
at his sleeve.</p>

<p>He turned and saw it was the old fisherman. At first he
thought Henrik was begging for a tip, and he was putting his hand
into his pocket to find a sixpence, when Henrik all at once
screwed up his face in a peculiar manner and with his damaged
hand pointing furtively to the airman, whispered hoarsely,
"Smuggler&mdash;watch." Then as Miss Howard called out shrilly,
"Come on, please, Mr. Maxwell, the rain is blowing in the door,"
the amazed detective would have sworn that the sunken lips of the
old fisherman framed the word "Dope."</p>

<p>For the moment the detective was too astounded to take in what
had happened, but then, quickly recovering his wits, he put out a
hand to lay hold of Henrik and ask him what he meant. The old
man, however, avoided his grasp and with an amused chuckle as a
good-bye, proceeded to shuffle quickly off to his hut.</p>

<p>Then, Miss Howard calling out again for him to come, and the
rain now beginning to fall in sheets, the detective, as puzzled
as he had ever been in his life, jumped into the car and seated
himself beside her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>

IN THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a very puzzled and uneasy detective who
was driven back to the Abbey that afternoon, for he was finding
it impossible to determine the significance of what had just
happened.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible, but he had to believe the evidence of
his own ears. The old fisherman had called the airman a smuggler
and had almost certainly, too, used the word "dope."</p>

<p>But it was not that that was so particularly disturbing,
although the incident there was extraordinary in itself. It was
that the fisherman had chosen him, Larose, to whom to impart the
information, and had added the word "watch!"</p>

<p>It was exactly as if the fisherman were aware who he, Larose,
was and was warning him.</p>

<p>And yet he was quite certain he had never set eyes upon Henrik
before, for when Sir Arnold had been bandaging the dreadful wound
upon the man's hand, he had taken good stock of him, and had been
particularly impressed by the unusual-looking appearance of the
fisherman.</p>

<p>Then if it were really true that Daller was in the illicit
drug traffic, how had that become known to this lonely old man,
who was supposed to be half-witted, and who was living a life
almost entirely out of touch with human kind?</p>

<p>But Larose was thrilled, too, with his thoughts, for if Daller
were indeed a member of a dope gang, then he, Larose, had under
his hand one undoubted criminal among the aristocratic party now
up at the Abbey, and from one known criminal he would be a poor
sort of detective, he told himself, if he did not succeed in
tracking down the others.</p>

<p>He smiled with some satisfaction. He had not been at the Abbey
twenty-four hours and he had already two clues to follow! The
dashing airman and the two newcomers to the home upon the
marsh.</p>

<p>Arriving back at the Abbey, and as they were passing through
the lounge, he moved up close to Lady Ardane and under cover of
expressing his enjoyment of the little excursion they had just
had, whispered that he wanted to see her as soon us possible. She
frowned slightly as if not too pleased at the request, but
whispered back, "In my boudoir, just before six."</p>

<p>At five minutes before six then he was alone with her in her
room and explaining to her what he wanted. He must be able to go
outside the Abbey at night, he said, and he was afraid, although
he did not like the idea, that the night watchman upon the ground
floor must be taken partly into the confidence.</p>

<p>For some reason, Lady Ardane seemed rather disturbed at his
request, and asked immediately why he wanted to be able to go
outside.</p>

<p>"Oh! I want to be quite free at any time in all my movements,"
he replied non-committally, "and be able to go just where I
like." He smiled. "You see, your ladyship, we detectives do a lot
of our work in the dark."</p>

<p>She did not, however, smile in return, and after hesitating a
few moments, opened a drawer in her desk and brought out a key.
"You can have this, then," she said rather reluctantly, "but take
great care of it, because it is the only one left. It opens the
small door at the far end of the Abbey, in the corridor beyond
the library. There are only two keys to this door and Sir Parry
has the other one."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Larose. "Sir Parry has one, has he? Then he
can come in and out here whenever he wants to?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Lady Ardane. "He attends to all my
business affairs for me, and can go into the office at all times
without disturbing anybody. He uses the library too, very
often."</p>

<p>"Well, just one thing," said Larose preparing to leave the
room, "how long have you known Mr. Daller and where did you first
meet him?"</p>

<p>Lady Ardane's manner was icily cold. "About three years," she
replied, "and I met him at Hurlington. I have already told you he
is a great friend of mine." She inclined her head. "So you need
not look for the culprit there, for Mr. Daller would do anything
for me."</p>

<p>"No doubt," thought Larose with an unreasoning pang of
jealousy as he left the room, "even to the extent of making you
Mrs. Bernard Daller, if he could."</p>

<p>With an hour and more to spare before he need get ready for
dinner, the detective made an inspection of the little door for
which he had just been given the key. It was, as Lady Ardane had
said, at the very end of the building, and in that part that had
once led out from the old cloisters. The walls were very thick
and old, and the door was narrow, and only just wide enough to
admit one person at a time. He inserted the key in the lock with
the idea of dropping in a little oil if necessary so that the
door might open quite noiselessly when he came to use it, but he
at once found no lubricant would be required, for not only the
lock but the hinges of the door also had been oiled recently. He
could smell the oil distinctly.</p>

<p>He bent down, and for a long minute examined the hinges, then
returning slowly along the corridor and desiring to be alone with
his own thoughts for a little while, he opened the door of the
library, feeling sure that at that time of the evening the large
room would be empty.</p>

<p>But he at once found he was mistaken, for Sir Parry Bardell
was seated at one of the tables and with a large tome before him,
was making notes upon a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>The knight looked up with a frown at the opening of the door,
as if annoyed at being disturbed, but then perceiving who it was,
the frown changed instantly into an engaging smile, and he
beckoned the detective into the room.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, Mr. Maxwell," he called out to the
hesitating detective. "You won't disturb me. Indeed I shall be
glad of your company, for I always find this huge room very
lonely, by myself."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and, pulling out the chair next to him,
invited the detective to sit down.</p>

<p>Larose was nothing loath, indeed nothing pleased him better,
for it was the first time he had had an opportunity of studying
Sir Parry at close quarters.</p>

<p>Larose took the chair that Sir Parry offered him and the
latter pointed to the book that he had been reading. "Look at
those quaint old characters, Mr. Maxwell," he said. "This book is
five hundred years old and I'm digging out some information from
it about this very Abbey. I am writing a history of the Abbey,
you know, and I've been on it now for over three years. Lady
Ardane asked me to do it"&mdash;he made a wry face&mdash;"but I
really wish I hadn't taken it on now, for it absorbs such a lot
of my time. I seem to be always in here, and it keeps me from my
great hobby, the study of the stars." He laid his hand lightly
upon the detective's arm. "Ah! but you must come and see my place
one day and I'll show you my big telescope. It's wonderful and
I'm very proud of it."</p>

<p>He chatted on in the most friendly manner possible, passing
from one subject to another with an almost boyish enthusiasm, and
as the conversation progressed, he was most interesting to watch.
When he was animated, there was all openness and simplicity in
his expression, but with his features falling into repose, the
detective noted they could set in very stern and uncompromising
lines, with nothing of weakness or indecision about them.
Sometimes, too, Larose thought then that he looked very sad.</p>

<p>Presently, when happening to refer to Lady Ardane and the
great responsibility that had fallen on her in her widowhood, he
lowered his voice suddenly and, regarding the detective with
great intentness, asked with an ominous shake of the head. "But
you have heard something of this trouble she is in?"</p>

<p>"Ah! now I may learn something," thought Larose gleefully.
"Someone's going to talk about it at last."</p>

<p>"Yes," he nodded at once, "Mr. Lestrange told me an attempt
had been made to kidnap the little baronet."</p>

<p>"But not only that," said Sir Parry, gritting his teeth
savagely together, "for someone, the night before last, tried to
waylay her when she was alone in her car."</p>

<p>"Oh! do tell me about it," exclaimed Larose, looking as
horrified as be could. "I have heard nothing about that."</p>

<p>And then Sir Parry, with some emotion, related what had
happened upon the Norwich road when Lady Ardane had been fired
upon, and from the narrative he gave, the detective realised how
cleverly the mistress of Carmel Abbey had managed to suppress all
mention that she had had a companion with her at the time.</p>

<p>When Sir Parry had finished, he heaved a big sigh. "But
perhaps I ought not to have told you anything about it," he said,
looking very troubled, "and yet it is such a relief to me to
discuss it with anyone." His voice dropped almost to a whisper.
"Among ourselves here we talk about it as little as possible, and
I believe we all want to think that Lady Ardane dreamt it." His
eyes blazed and he slapped his hand upon the table. "But I ask
you, Mr. Maxwell, as a man of the world, what do you think of it
and whom can you imagine the wretches can be?"</p>

<p>But Larose could, apparently, make nothing of it, for in his
country, Australia, such happenings as this had never occurred,
and all he could suggest were the ideas he had picked up from
reading about kidnapping gangs in America.</p>

<p>They talked on for a long while until indeed Larose had to
leave to get ready for dinner. Sir Parry shook him warmly by the
hand as they bade each other good night and the last glimpse the
detective had of the very troubled, retired shipowner, was of him
sinking back despondently into a big armchair with no thought any
more, at any rate for the time, of the history of the Abbey he
was writing.</p>

<p>"A very kind-hearted man," was Larose's comment as he mounted
the stairs to his room, "but the hard, relentless work of his
business life has taken its toll, both physically and mentally,
and he looks very much older to me than fifty-seven." He smiled
whimsically to himself. "Yes, whatever people may say, if you
want to really enjoy riches, you must inherit them and not
acquire them yourself. The process of acquisition seems much too
exhausting, and takes too much out of you."</p>

<p>Just before midnight, and having plasticened a number of
bedroom doors, as he had done the previous night, Larose let
himself out the little cloister door, and skirting round the back
of the Abbey, made his way to among the trees that everywhere lay
close up to the low fence that circled all round the Abbey
grounds.</p>

<p>He was reckoning that by keeping among the trees he could
watch, unseen, every side of the Abbey that he wanted to, but,
all the same, he knew it was to the sea aspect that he must give
most attention. He was of opinion that there was just a chance
someone might signal from one of the windows of the Abbey, and in
return receive an answer from some distant house.</p>

<p>He was not too hopeful about it, but at any rate, he told
himself, it was the first thing to be considered, and must not be
neglected at any cost. Later, about 2 o'clock, he intended to
make his way over the marshes and have a talk with old Henrik.
Waking him up in the middle of the night would mean nothing to
the old fisherman, for he was, of course, accustomed to rise at
all hours to attend to his nets.</p>

<p>The moon was shining, but there were clouds all about, and it
looked as if more rain would fall during the night.</p>

<p>The detective gained the shelter the trees and scanned over
the many windows of the Abbey, but everyone was apparently in bed
and no lights were showing anywhere.</p>

<p>Keeping always to the shelter of the trees, he promenaded
twice, in a wide circle, all round the Abbey. The moon was fitful
and continually disappearing behind the clouds, and he thought
with a pang of uneasiness that it was an ideal night for anyone,
waiting upon his opportunity, to leave the place unseen.</p>

<p>Nothing happened for more than an hour, although once for a
few moments he had half thought he saw a figure among the trees
about two hundred yards distant from him, but warily approaching
the suspected spot, he had found no one there, and had returned
to what he considered his best point of observation, right
opposite to the main entrance to the Abbey, facing towards the
sea.</p>

<p>All at once, when the moon was showing faintly after a short
period of disappearance behind a cloud, he thought he saw
something moving along by the fence, a good distance away from
where he was standing.</p>

<p>He put up his glasses with the full expectation that he was
going to disappointed as before and then&mdash;his heart began to
beat quickly&mdash;for he distinctly saw a shadow move up to the
fence and then stand motionless as if it were peering through the
rails.</p>

<p>The figure was slight and small and looked that of a boy.</p>

<p>Instantly, then, he began to move towards it with the utmost
speed that he could, but his progress was slow, for he was
hampered by the many bushes he had to push through. He had, too
to proceed in a crouching attitude all the way, and he took so
long in covering the distance that he was fearful at any moment
the boy would run off and he would not have seen which way he had
gone.</p>

<p>Presently, however, when he judged he could not be far from
where he had first seen the boy, he rose to his feet behind the
trunk of a tree, and to his great relief caught sight of him, not
fifty yards away.</p>

<p>The lad was now a few feet away from the fence and, muffled
well in scarf and long macintosh with a high collar, was standing
quite motionless except that every now and then he turned his
head to one side as if he were listening, and then glanced up at
the sky.</p>

<p>"The little devil!" muttered the detective. "He's only waiting
for the moon to cloud over again and then he's going to bolt
away."</p>

<p>But all at once, to the great joy of the detective, the boy
began to walk slowly to where he was hiding.</p>

<p>A minute passed, and pausing every few steps to turn his head
round and round in every direction, the boy came on.</p>

<p>Then the detective pounced, and in a lightning movement
grabbed at him and lifted him into his arms. A half-stifled
scream came from the muffled figure and it struggled furiously,
then getting one arm free, it struck at the detective's face and
the latter felt a stinging scratch upon his check.</p>

<p>"You little devil!" he exclaimed angrily. "Stop that and don't
make a sound or I'll choke the life out of you. Now, keep still,"
and almost as quickly as they had begun, the struggles
ceased.</p>

<p>Then Larose gasped in amazement. It was a woman he was holding
and from the scent of her&mdash;it was Lady Ardane.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly as she lay limp and helpless in his arms, but
with his recognition now perfectly sure, he yet still continued
to hold her. She was soft and sweet-smelling, and it was at all
events, he told himself, some recompense for the trouble she had
given him.</p>

<p>He let her on to her feet at last, but then for a few moments
continued to support her, as, apparently quite exhausted by her
struggles, she leaned heavily against him.</p>

<p>"So it's you, is it?" he said grimly. "Now what are you up to,
out here at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"You were rough," she said shakily, chafing over her arms, and
with her words coming in jerks. "You are a brute."</p>

<p>"If it comes to that," replied Larose calmly, "who would not
be when he is trying to hold a scratching woman?" He passed his
hand over one side of his face. "Your nails are sharp, my lady,
and you've scratched me right enough. It stings horribly."</p>

<p>"I didn't know who you were," she panted, "and I thought you
were one of those men."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind about that," he said. "I want to know what
you are up to here, at this time of night."</p>

<p>"Mind your own business," she replied sharply. "I refuse to
tell you. You were not engaged to spy upon me, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wasn't, was I?" said Larose. "Then let me tell you
straight, I'm here to spy upon everyone."</p>

<p>"I wish you had never come," she went on passionately. "I've
grown to hate the very sight of you."</p>

<p>"Quite a lot of people have felt like that," he remarked
calmly, "and those of them who are not dead are mostly in
prison." He repeated his question again. "Now what are you up to
out here?"</p>

<p>She began to cry, but in a quiet and very restrained manner,
and at once all his annoyance left him and he felt very sorry for
her. "Of course," he said lamely, "if you were only going to meet
a sweetheart, I know it is no business of mine, and I don't want
to interfere. I quite&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You fool!" she burst out, with the tears instantly drying up;
"a woman in my position meeting a sweetheart here!"</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Larose judicially, "I could understand it,
and indeed might almost consider him a lucky man. After all, you
are only like other women and I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he stopped suddenly, and gripping her by the arm, pulled
her quickly down behind a tree. "Hush! hush!" he exclaimed,
"there's a man over by those bushes. Crouch as low as you can and
don't move. He's looking this way."</p>

<p>All her anger forgotten in her terror, she obeyed him
instantly, and crouching down close beside him, he could feel the
quick beating of her heart as her body touched his. She felt for
his hand for protection and then, realising what she had done,
instantly snatched it away again.</p>

<p>Holding their breaths together, they stared out between the
trees.</p>

<p>Quite close to them and less than a hundred yards away they
could see the head and shoulders of a man silhouetted against the
sky. The man was partly hidden by a bush, and that he had not
caught sight of them was evident, for with a pair of glasses to
his eyes, he was sweeping everywhere around. Then after a few
moments they saw that his glasses were fixed upon the Abbey.</p>

<p>"Now, you remain here," whispered Larose, straightening
himself up, "and I'll try and stalk him. The cover's bad but I
may be able to get behind him and make a grab."</p>

<p>But she seized him tightly by the arm. "No, you're not to
leave me," she panted, "and I won't be left here alone. There may
be others with him and I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" began Larose.</p>

<p>"No, you shall not go," she went on. "I won't have it." And
the detective, seeing it was useless to argue, sank back into his
crouching position, with the reflection as she still continued to
hold on to his arm, that the work of a detective was not without
its privileges.</p>

<p>For quite five minutes the man with the binoculars remained
motionless and then with a long sweep round again in every
direction, he began to walk warily but quickly towards the
Abbey.</p>

<p>"But where's he going?" asked Lady Ardane tremulously. "He
can't get in, for every door is locked and every window has an
alarm now."</p>

<p>"Wait," said the detective, "we shall soon see."</p>

<p>And very quickly they saw, for the man, with no hesitation at
all, made straight for the little cloister door, and pausing for
just two seconds to look intently behind him, thrust in a key,
and, the door opening, he disappeared into the Abbey. He closed
the door after him.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" wailed Lady Ardane, "but what will happen
now!"</p>

<p>The detective put down the glasses through which he had
followed every footstep of the man. "Nothing, tonight," he said a
little chokingly. "He'll just go upstairs and put himself to bed.
That's all." A grim note came into his tones. "I know who he is.
I saw his face that last moment when he turned round."</p>

<p>"You recognised him!" exclaimed Lady Ardane incredulously.
"Then who is he!"</p>

<p>"One of your guests," replied Larose sternly, "but I'm not
going to tell you which one. If I did, your manner when you meet
him to-morrow would let him know instantly that something was
wrong."</p>

<p>"But I ought to know," she said warmly. "One of my guests! But
it is incredible."</p>

<p>"But it's what we've always expected," said Larose gruffly,
"and it's no surprise to me. What I am wondering"&mdash;and his
eyes glinted suspiciously in the darkness&mdash;"is how he got
hold of a key to that door if, as you say, there are only two in
existence. The lock's one of the best and a new key for it was
not made in a hurry."</p>

<p>"But there are only two," insisted Lady Ardane. "I am sure of
it. Sir Parry has one and you have the other." A catch came into
her voice. "I'll ask Sir Parry to-morrow if he's lost his."</p>

<p>"No, no, you won't, please," said Larose sternly. "You'll just
let me handle this, and you'll not breathe a word about to-night
to anyone." He held her eyes with his in the moon light. "Now you
promise, don't you?"</p>

<p>"But I ought to know who that man was," she said warmly, "for
after all this matter most concerns me."</p>

<p>"But I am dealing with it," was the sharp reply, "and I know
more about criminals than you do. So you'll have to leave it with
me, please, and you promise, don't you?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "All right," she said wearily, "have it your
own way. You keep your secret and I'll keep mine"&mdash;her voice
quivered&mdash;"but I shall get no sleep to-night."</p>

<p>He ignored her plaintive tone and asked in a most business-like way, "Now how did you get out of the Abbey!"</p>

<p>"By the hall door," she replied, "and young Hollins will open
it again for me when I tap."</p>

<p>"You can trust him as a watchman!" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. He's quite young, and he's an assistant scoutmaster
at Hunstanton. He's just twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Good," said the detective, "and we'll wait until that cloud
covers the moon and then you can run home. It looks as if the
rain's coming on again."</p>

<p>They stood in silence under the trees, and such is the mystery
of life that, with all the excitement of the manhunt surging
through him, the thoughts of the detective were now more upon the
woman beside him than upon the man whom he had seen enter through
the cloister door. This red-haired woman had scratched his face
and called him a brute and a fool, and yet in the darkness there,
there were tender lines about his mouth and he was smiling to
himself that he had held her in his arms.</p>

<p>Suddenly the moon went under and it became pitch dark and
began to rain. "Now you can go," said the detective, "and you
needn't unduly hurry, for it look's as if we shall get no more
moon to-night."</p>

<p>"But you're coming with me," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied, although until that moment he had had
no thought of accompanying her.</p>

<p>She held to his arm, as a matter of course, and without a word
they crossed the three hundred yards or so to the Abbey door.
Then she drew herself quickly away.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said in very matter-of-fact tones, "and don't
you forget your promise."</p>

<p>"No, I'll not," she replied. She stretched out and touched his
arm again in the darkness. "I'm sorry I scratched you, Mr.
Larose," she went on, "but I was just terrified when you caught
hold of me."</p>

<p>"Quite all right," he laughed. "I've had worse things happen
to me than scratches. Good-night."</p>

<p>Larose made sure she had entered the Abbey in safety, and
then, as the rain had now begun to fall heavily, he flattened
himself close against the wall to obtain what shelter he
could.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he exclaimed, now turning his thoughts resolutely to
the matter that had brought him out that night, "but that was the
American right enough. I saw his face distinctly. Rankin, the
friend of the Senator! Now what the devil does that mean? The
trusted friend of her step-father prowling about at night! And
how did he get a key to that door, too, when Sir Parry Bardell
has the only other one!"</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. "And this red-haired party that I have
just been holding in my arms. What was she out for to-night, and
what was she doing by the fence? It must have taken something
very urgent to make her come out in the middle of the night, for
with all her red head she has a gentle streak in her and can get
frightened like any other woman." He shook his head. "Yes, I'm up
against some things that are very puzzling and they'll want a lot
of straightening out."</p>

<p>He remained where he was for quite a quarter of an hour and
then, the rain falling faster and faster, gave up all thoughts of
any further excursions that night. He let himself in very
cautiously by the cloister door, pausing for a long time to
examine the hinges again by the shrouded light of the electric
torch. Then he tiptoed up to the first floor and made a round of
inspection of all doors against which he had placed his
plasticene. One only had been opened, and as he expected it was
that of Theodore Rankin.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was he, right enough," he murmured, "and I'll keep a
good eye on my gentleman now."</p>

<p>Back in his own room, he switched on the light and ruefully
regarded a long scratch upon his cheek. It extended right down
from the corner of his eye on to his chin.</p>

<p>"And there'll be no hiding it tomorrow," he said with a shake
of his head. "Everybody will see that I've been in the wars and
wonder what I've been up to."</p>

<p>He took some tincture of iodine out of his suitcase and
generously swabbed it into the scratch.</p>

<p>"Never a rose without its thorns," he sighed. "She has a
pretty little hand, with beautiful white fingers, and I suppose I
ought to feel honored to have had it upon my face. Yet, if I
don't well disinfect the mark it left, I may get as nasty a
septic wound as if some dustman had been at work there." He made
a wry face as the iodine smarted. "Funny world this, and we men
are strange creatures! Now there was I, simply thrilled with that
red head upon my shoulder and imagining it quite a little bit of
Heaven while it lasted, and yet"&mdash;he sighed again&mdash;"if
I had it there half a dozen times, the thrills would be nearly
all gone and it would need a black or a brown head to bring them
back." He sighed for the third time. "One so soon gets accustomed
to the most delightful experiences, for we are so made that
novelty and change are the very spice of life."</p>

<p>In the morning, leaving his room to go down to breakfast, he
almost ran into Theodore Rankin in the corridor. They bade each
other good morning and the American eyed him very solemnly.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" thought Larose as they descended the stairs
together, "but he seems every bit as interested in me as I am in
him, for that look he gave me was anything but a cursory
one."</p>

<p>In anticipation of the forthcoming shoot, nearly everyone had
come down early, and they chatted animatedly together. Lady
Ardane showed no traces of her adventure, looking as fresh as a
rose and as if she had slept all night.</p>

<p>Suddenly, during a lull in the conversation. Patricia Howard
exclaimed interestedly, "Oh! Mr. Maxwell, what a nasty scratch
upon your cheek! Have you been playing with the cat?" And
everyone at once turned to regard the detective.</p>

<p>Larose muttered a bad word under his breath, but replied with
a ready smile, "Yes, I have, and you see she didn't like me over
much."</p>

<p>"Well, it'll be a lesson to you," smiled back the girl, "to
leave strange cats alone."</p>

<p>"But cats are like the ladies, I've always found," remarked
Admiral Charters with an assumption of great knowledge of the
other sex. "They scratch you one moment, and the next they are
purring up to you as close as they can get," and Lady Ardane
looked down and bit hard upon her lip in a vain endeavor to
prevent her face from becoming very red.</p>

<p>The meal was certainly not without its interest to the
detective, for he was exerting his psychological powers to the
utmost in a study of everyone at the table, and he eventually
came to the conclusion that there was a most unusual feeling in
the attitudes of three of the people there towards him.</p>

<p>He was not including Lady Ardane, for as he had rather
expected, she was very subdued in her manner and never once, as
far as he noticed, gave a single glance in his direction.</p>

<p>But it was very different with Senator Harvey, Rankin and
Clive Huntington, for he caught all three of them looking
covertly at him many times. The Senator, frowning as if he were
very puzzled; Rankin, quite amiable, and as if he were a friendly
adversary taking stock of a rival with whom he might have to come
to grips at any time; and Huntington as if he were very amused
about something.</p>

<p>Larose was sure he was not imagining it all, for in his life
of the tracking down of crime he prided himself upon having
developed most sensitive powers of determining when he was an
object of special interest to anyone.</p>

<p>He began to feel rather uneasy, for he was so certain that
since he had arrived at the Abbey he had given no cause to anyone
to think that he was anything otherwise than what he was making
himself out to be.</p>

<p>The weather had improved during the night and the sun was now
shining; nevertheless there were still indications that it was
going to be a showery day. However, it was arranged that the
shooting party should make a start at ten, and in the meantime,
with breakfast over, nearly everyone went outside and stood
sunning themselves before the big door.</p>

<p>Presently a tall, slouching figure was seen striding down the
drive and it was recognised at once as that of Henrik. He was
evidently coming up with the lobsters he had procured.</p>

<p>"Most opportune," thought Larose, "then I'll go beyond the
fence and talk to him when he comes into the road."</p>

<p>So about a quarter of an hour later the detective, hidden now
from all sight of the Abbey by the trees, stepped out in front of
the fisherman as the latter was ambling along with his empty
basket.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said with a smile. "You remember me? I held
your hand steady whilst it was being bandaged yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yah, yah," said Henrik smiling back. He stretched out his
hand. "Bacco, bacco," he went on.</p>

<p>Larose took out his case and gave him a few cigarettes. "Now,"
he said, when Henrik with no delay had set light to one of them,
"what do you know about Mr. Daller being a smuggler!"</p>

<p>But the old man did not take any notice of the question.
"Goot," he said with, a deep puff at the cigarette. "Henrik like
'bacco."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know about Mr. Daller?" asked the
detective, repeating his question sharply.</p>

<p>Henrik smiled blandly. "No mooch Inglish," he replied, "no
speak mooch."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the detective. "You spoke it right enough
last night. Now what do you mean?"</p>

<p>The fisherman shook his head. "No understand," he said.</p>

<p>Larose scowled, "Now look here, my friend," he said sternly,
"I'm going to stand no nonsense from you. You pointed distinctly
to Mr. Daller and said he was a smuggler and told me to
watch."</p>

<p>"No," said Henrik stubbornly. "No speak Inglis."</p>

<p>The detective became furious. "You old liar," he cried, "you
can speak it quite well when you want to." He gripped him tightly
by the arm. "Now, tell me at once what you meant."</p>

<p>But the old man was so patently taken aback by the rough usage
that he was receiving, that Larose all at once began to waver in
his absolute conviction. Either Henrik was speaking the truth, or
else he was one of the best actors the detective had ever
seen.</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me," he said, still holding to the
fisherman's arm, "that you never used the word smuggler, or
watch, or dope?"</p>

<p>"No Inglis," replied Henrik shaking his head vigorously and
looking really frightened. "Verra few words."</p>

<p>Larose let go his arm. "Look here," he said in his most
persuasive tone, "you tell me what I want to know and I'll give
you all the cigarettes I have here and a whole new box as well,"
and he took out his case again and let Henrik see there were
still plenty in it.</p>

<p>The fisherman at once lost all his frightened appearance and
flashed him a cunning look. "Goot! Goot!" he exclaimed eagerly
and stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"No," said Larose firmly, "you must tell me first," and he
drew back the cigarette case.</p>

<p>The fisherman looked as disappointed as a child.</p>

<p>"No Inglis," he repeated plaintively. "Verra few words."</p>

<p>Larose gave it up. "Get off," he said angrily. "Either you are
a knave or I am a fool," and he turned on his heel and started to
walk back to the Abbey.</p>

<p>Henrik watched him for a few moments and then, with a grin at
the half-dozen cigarettes he was holding in his hand, turned also
and started to walk away.</p>

<p>Larose was in a great state of doubt. One moment he was sure
that the fisherman had been lying and the next he was
anathematising himself as an imaginative fool.</p>

<p>And yet he could swear, he kept on telling himself, that
Henrik had said "smuggler," and "watch," and also with his sunken
lips over his toothless gums, had mouthed the word "dope."</p>

<p>But for the time being, at all events, Larose was to have no
further opportunity for speculation, for, arriving back at the
Abbey, all was bustle and animation in preparation for the shoot.
The men were to start away first, then, if it continued fine, the
ladies would be joining them at the picnic lunch.</p>

<p>Always an enthusiastic lover of the gun, the detective was now
delighted at the thought of his first meeting with the lordly and
aristocratic pheasant.</p>

<p>So, notwithstanding his many perplexities and the very
disappointing interview with the fisherman, he was in quite an
elated state of mind, as, together with Sir Parry Bardell and
Rankin, he found himself being driven swiftly along in the car of
the great surgeon. Four cars in all were then leaving the
Abbey.</p>

<p>But it was well for him that he was not aware of what exactly
were going to be the happenings of the next few hours.</p>

<p>The death of many a beautifully-plumaged bird was knelling on
that bright October morning, but had Larose only known it, his
own death was almost being knelled too, and it was only by the
merest chance that he was to return in the evening alive.</p>

<p>He had been marked down by one to whom another's life was of
no account if it could be taken secretly, and in the pocket of
one of the very men now leaving the Abbey were two cartridges
whose missions of destruction were not intended for any bird.</p>

<p>However, everything went well until late in the afternoon, and
although the detective had had no experience at all of the
conditions appertaining to shooting in England, and had been
feeling quite apprehensive that he might occasion satisfaction to
the sneering and supercilious barrister if he failed, he had
really acquitted himself handsomely, indeed earning the warm
approval of the grim-visaged head gamekeeper, who had not seemed
too pleased when he had been first informed that there was a
novice among the party.</p>

<p>"But you'll do, sir," he said, when he saw Larose, with a
clean right and left, bring down two rocketing birds that came
over flying very high, "both beautifully-timed shots, sir."</p>

<p>The detective was delighted with himself. The birds had come
bursting into sight above the trees, like projectiles from a gun,
and in a lightning flash he had made a most accurate calculation
as to how far they must travel to exactly run into his messengers
of death.</p>

<p>After that, he had lost all his nervousness, and continued to
do good execution among the birds. When all the party forgathered
to partake of the sumptuous picnic lunch that had been provided,
not a few of them congratulated him upon his prowess.</p>

<p>Larose was quite sorry Lady Ardane was not present to hear
them, but a drizzling rain having set in about noon, none of the
ladies had put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"And are you as good with the rifle as you are with the gun,
Mr. Maxwell?" asked young Huntington presently with a most
friendly smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! I've had a lot of luck this morning," laughed Larose,
"and the birds would come my way." He nodded. "But I've done a
good bit of kangaroo-shooting with the rifle."</p>

<p>"And the pistol?" asked Huntington very interestedly.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," replied Larose, and he would have sworn that
his interrogator suppressed a smile.</p>

<p>His good luck continued during the afternoon, and with the
head gamekeeper, with an eye to a big tally at the end of the
day, now invariably placing him in a favorable position, he
brought down plenty of birds, and he smiled to himself many
times, with the reflection that he was certainly combining
pleasure with business.</p>

<p>A little before dusk the last covert was about to be beaten,
and he was stationed at the extreme end of a rather dense
wood.</p>

<p>He was about a hundred yards distant from the wood, among a
number of scattered bushes, about waist high. Just in front of
him ran a deep ditch and behind him, not ten paces away, was a
tall, thick hedge, separating the field he was in from a tarred
public road.</p>

<p>It had been close and muggy all day, but on account of the
rain he had had to wear his macintosh nearly all the time. Now,
however, the rain had stopped, and feeling uncomfortably warm, he
took it off and threw it carelessly over a bush just beside
him.</p>

<p>The wood was a long one and the guns were in consequence
spread out. On his right, about 150 yards away, was Sir Arnold
Medway, and on his left, although he could not see him, because
of the bending round of the wood, he knew the American, Theodore
Rankin, was stationed.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed in inaction, and the light beginning now
to fade rapidly and hearing no sound of gunfire anywhere, he
began to think that the shoot was over and that the beaters had
been called off.</p>

<p>So, feeling a little tired with the unaccustomed exertions of
the day, he sat down upon the ditchside and, with his gun across
his knees, took out a cigarette.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;like a veritable crack of doom&mdash;came
a deafening report right behind him, and the seething hiss of
shot just above his head, and he saw his macintosh jerked off the
bush as if someone had heaved it up with a vicious kick. Then not
three seconds later the sounds were repeated, the bang and the
vicious hiss, and his unfortunate macintosh, in whirls which he
could not follow with his eyes, made another upward movement and
then disappeared into the ditch.</p>

<p>His brain worked automatically, and realising something of
what was happening he literally hurled himself, face forwards,
into the ditch.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" he gasped, wringing the mud and water from his eyes,
"but those were intended for me."</p>

<p>He waited only a few seconds and then, with his heart pumping
like a steam engine, started to run at his utmost speed along the
bottom of the ditch.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards brought him to the end, and he was
now close to the tarred road, with a wide gap through the thick
hedge, behind which he knew his would-be murderer must have been
standing when he fired.</p>

<p>With his automatic pistol ready in his hand, he raised himself
up stealthily and then, seeing no one near, wasted no time and
sprang up on to the road.</p>

<p>But the road was quite deserted, and neither to the right nor
to the left could he see any movement anywhere.</p>

<p>"Gone!" he muttered disgustedly, "and he probably thinks I'm
dead." He nodded grimly. "But how right old Jones was! They soon
found me out." He gritted his teeth. "And I'll soon find out how.
It's a fight in the open now."</p>

<p>Larose turned suddenly, to find Sir Arnold only a few paces
from him, walking slowly up. The great surgeon was carrying his
gun upon his shoulder and was smoking a cigar. With eyes for
everything, the detective noted that the cigar had only just been
lit.</p>

<p>"Some birds came over then, Mr. Maxwell?" said Sir Arnold.
"But they'll probably be the last, for Lord Wonnock has just
signaled me that the beaters have been called off." He regarded
the white face and muddied figure of the detective and his face
puckered up into a frown. "But what's happened to you?" he asked.
"You've been in the wars!"</p>

<p>"Nothing much," replied Larose, forcing a smile. "I slipped
into the ditch. That was all."</p>

<p>But the surgeon's frown deepened, he took the cigar out of his
mouth, hesitated a moment and then asked abruptly, "Are you a
detective, Mr. Maxwell?"</p>

<p>Larose almost choked in his astonishment. He felt stifled and
could hardly get his breath.</p>

<p>"Pardon my asking you," went on Sir Arnold quickly, "for I
know of course that it's no business of mine, but the idea just
came to me, very suddenly." He spoke with great kindliness. "Now,
I see you are in distress. Can I help you in any way?"</p>

<p>Quick-witted as he was by nature, for once Larose could not
for the second call up a sufficiently evasive reply, but instead
asked hoarsely, "What makes you think I am a detective?"</p>

<p>Sir Arnold smiled. "Your face is ghastly white, sir," he
replied, "and its pallor shows where you are made up." He
shrugged his shoulders. "We are all aware of the trouble that is
over Lady Ardane, and although, as far as I know, we have none of
us discussed it, I think we are all of opinion that a detective
has been introduced into the Abbey." He nodded gravely "So seeing
you in this condition, it came to me that&mdash;&mdash;" He broke
off and asked sharply, "But tell me, what has just happened?"</p>

<p>"My macintosh got the contents of two barrels," replied Larose
dryly, "but fortunately I was not in it at the time, as it was
hanging upon a bush." He drew in a deep breath. "Someone fired
twice, from behind that hedge, with the deliberate intention of
killing me." His color began to come back, and he spoke now in a
sharp, decisive tone. "Yes, I am a detective, Sir Arnold, and now
please excuse me for taking a liberty," and stretching out his
hand, he laid his fingers lightly upon one of the surgeon's
wrists and felt for his pulse.</p>

<p>The great man looked very amused. "Taking no chances, I
see,"&mdash;his face assumed a very grave expression&mdash;"and
you are quite justified. No, my pulse is steady, and it was not I
who fired upon you."</p>

<p>"I never thought it was," replied Larose quickly, dropping the
wrist at once, "and I only touched you as a matter of form. Now,"
he went on, "if you will, you can do me a great service, but wait
just a moment until I go and get my gun. I left it in the
ditch."</p>

<p>"No, I'll come with you," said the surgeon instantly, "and if
the assassin is still about, he may hesitate to fire again with
me with you."</p>

<p>The detective retrieved his gun and the sadly-mutilated
macintosh, and then together the two made their way on to the
tarred road. Then almost immediately they saw Theodore Rankin
step out from another gap in the hedge, some little distance
away.</p>

<p>"Make some excuse, please, Sir Arnold," said Larose quickly,
"and feel that man's pulse with as little delay as possible. Say
I have been arguing with you that Americans are a very excitable
race." His face darkened. "But not a word to anyone, please, that
I have told you I am a detective."</p>

<p>The American looked in their direction, and then stood waiting
for them to come up, and approaching him Sir Arnold lost no time
in doing as the detective had asked.</p>

<p>"This Australian friend of ours, Mr. Rankin," he said with a
twinkle in his eye, "has some very original ideas, and among
others, he will have it that you Americans are excitable
constitutionally, and so wear yourselves out much quicker than we
cold-blooded Britishers do."</p>

<p>"Well, what I mean," explained Larose quickly, "is that in
everything you undertake you get more excitement out of it than
we do. Take the slaughter of these poor birds to-day, for
instance. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give me your hand at once, Mr. Rankin," broke in Sir Arnold
with mock solemnity, "and we'll settle this matter forthwith. The
pulse-rate is a sure indication of the degree of excitement."</p>

<p>The American, looking rather puzzled, held out his hand and
Sir Arnold proceeded very gravely to feel his pulse.</p>

<p>"Hum! hum!" he remarked after holding it for only a very few
seconds, "quite quiet and regular." He turned to the detective.
"So your theories, Mr. Maxwell, will not hold water in the case
of this gentleman at any rate. As for you, sir," he went on to
the American, "your pulse is much too slow. You smoke far too
many cigarettes."</p>

<p>But the American made no comment. He was apparently too
occupied in taking in the muddied condition of Larose.</p>

<p>"Don't be anxious, Mr. Rankin," laughed Sir Arnold. "Our
friend has not been in a fight. He's only fallen into a ditch,
and after covering himself with glory, he has now covered himself
with mud."</p>

<p>The American smiled a slow, inscrutable smile. "But what did
you get with those last two shots, Mr. Maxwell?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the detective, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Both were misses!" exclaimed the American, raising his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose with a sigh, "misses with both
barrels."</p>

<p>They proceeded to walk back to where all the cars had been
left, and realised they must have been the last of the shoot to
leave their stations, as they met the other three cars upon their
way back to the Abbey. Larose was greatly disgusted, for he had
been hoping to discern disappointment upon the face of some one
among the party when he appeared unhurt.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they got into their car and Sir Arnold
drove off at a good pace. They had not, however, proceeded a
couple of hundred yards before a dreadful accident almost
occurred. A boy upon a bicycle came careering out of a side lane
and it was only by a matter of inches that he escaped being run
down.</p>

<p>But Sir Arnold had kept his presence of mind, and well judging
the distance, had swept by just the very fraction of a second
before the bicycle came into the track of the car.</p>

<p>The great surgeon seemed quite unperturbed and made no remark,
but Sir Parry, who was sitting next to him, uttered a long-drawn
"O-oh," and then looked round with a ghastly smile to the
detective and Rankin behind.</p>

<p>For the second the detective had felt his own heart stand
still, but then, quickly alive to his opportunity, he turned to
the American and laid his fingers lightly upon one of the
latter's wrists.</p>

<p>Rankin only smiled. "Still steady and quiet," he remarked
blandly, "and not a beat above the 65." He nodded. "I'm in the
wheat gamble, you know, and you want nerves of steel to succeed
there." He nodded again, "Nothing really upsets me, and I believe
I could commit a murder without turning a hair."</p>

<p>And the detective, sinking back in his seat, was inclined to
think so, too.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>

LAROSE UNMASKED</h2>

<p class="first">ARRIVING back at the Abbey, the detective,
avoiding the crowd assembled in the lounge, proceeded to make his
way quickly up towards his room, in order to change his clothes
as speedily as possible. At the top of the staircase, however, he
came upon Lady Ardane with the little baronet and one of the
nurses.</p>

<p>Stopping to reply to Lady Ardane's enquiry as to how the shoot
had gone off, he made a quick movement of his head in the
direction of her room to let her understand that he wanted to
speak to her.</p>

<p>She took in at once what he wanted, and directing the nurse to
take the child downstairs into the lounge turned back and
motioned to the detective to follow her.</p>

<p>In her boudoir, with the door closed the detective told her
quickly and in a very few words what had happened, holding up his
macintosh for her inspection.</p>

<p>She went white to the lips. "Oh! how awful it is that they are
so pitiless!" she exclaimed. "They will kill us both if they
can't get us alive."</p>

<p>"But don't imagine things are even coming to that," said
Larose reassuringly. "They blundered badly in not finishing me
off to-day, and they'll never get such another chance." He looked
quite cheerful. "I shall be fighting in the open now, and that
will strengthen my hand a lot. So don't get downhearted, for I am
certain we shall beat them in the end."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane made a great effort to pull herself together, "And
you have no idea who it was?" she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," replied the detective, "and all that is
clear is that they must have found out who I am, as Mr. Jones
said they would." He went on briskly. "No, I won't come in to
dinner to-night and you can tell them all about me. Then I'll
appear just before the meal is over for I want to get a few words
with the men before they have a chance of going up to their
rooms."</p>

<p>"But wait a moment, please, Mr. Larose," said Lady Ardane
quickly, "and let me think. No, no," she went on, "it mustn't be
done like that. You must come in to dinner just the same, but
I'll speak to the Senator at once and we will decide exactly what
to do." She drew in a deep breath. "My step-father will be
dreadfully angry that I have called in anyone to do with the
police." A little assurance came back into her voice and she
spoke much more firmly. "But, whatever he says, I am glad you are
here"&mdash;she smiled wanly&mdash;"for I can see nothing
frightens you, and you'll be quite as merciless as they are."</p>

<p>"Thank you," smiled Larose, "I'm sure I'm very much obliged
for your opinion of me." He made a grimace. "But you're quite
mistaken, for I do get very frightened sometimes, and I confess
I'm a bit frightened now." He shivered. "I've been in these wet
clothes for nearly an hour and if I don't change them soon I may
have a peaceful death in my bed, instead of meeting with the
honorable and violent one that I expect."</p>

<p>She was all sympathy at once. "Then go and have a boiling bath
and I'll give you some special bath-salts of mine to put in.
They're splendid if you're feeling chilled," and she darted into
her bedroom, to return almost immediately with a daintily-ribboned jar.</p>

<p>Larose thanked her very much, and she gave him a smile, the
pleasantest one, he was sure, that she had yet given him.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he remarked to himself when he was stripping off his
sodden clothes, "that young woman can be very appealing when she
wants to."</p>

<p>An hour later, feeling warm and comfortable and quite himself
again, he was chatting to some of the ladies in the lounge, when
he saw Senator Harvey enter, and before sitting down, glance
intently in his direction. He could see instantly that the
Senator had been told everything, and so excusing himself to the
girl he was talking to, he walked over to him and sat down in a
chair alongside.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Senator dryly. "I wanted to have a word with
you, young man." There was no one near them, and in the noisy
buzz of conversation they could speak as privately as if they
were alone.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the Senator with a sigh, "I've been told who
you are and what has been happening, and I am very shocked about
both pieces of information." His face expressed his keen
displeasure. "Calling in the police was the last thing I
wanted"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"but of course it
can't be helped now."</p>

<p>"In my opinion," said Larose sternly, "it ought to have been
done at the very beginning, for there is all evidence that we are
dealing with a very desperate gang of men."</p>

<p>The Senator smiled a cold, grim smile. "I am not quite a
simpleton, Mr. Larose," he said, "and as the step-father of Lady
Ardane I have been most fully alive to her danger, and keeping my
eyes open very wide." He looked amused. "For one thing, I have
had you under close observation from the moment you arrived, and
am quite aware that you have been prowling about, out of your
bedroom, upon both nights that you have been here."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" exclaimed the detective rather taken aback.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the Senator, "a piece of hair was blobbed on to
your door with white of egg each night directly you went in."</p>

<p>Larose felt very disgusted, but he passed the matter over as
if it were of no importance.</p>

<p>"Now, none of the guests have been told," he asked, "of the
two warnings Lady Ardane has received?" He spoke sharply. "I want
to be quite sure about that."</p>

<p>"No," replied the Senator slowly, "none of the guests have
been told."</p>

<p>"And not Sir Parry?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, not even he," was the reply. "Lady Ardane and I promised
that Naughton Jones we would not mention the matter to anyone,
and although we were both most annoyed that the fellow took
himself off as he did, we have adhered to our promise." He
regarded the detective with a frown. "Now, what is it you want us
to do?"</p>

<p>"I suggest a slight alteration to the plan I proposed to Lady
Ardane," said Larose, "and would prefer now to come in to dinner
as usual, and then towards the end of the meal bring out in the
course of conversation who I am." He nodded confidently. "I'll
manage it without any fuss."</p>

<p>The Senator considered. "All right," he said wearily, "have it
your own way," and then as if glad to be relieved of all
responsibility, he rose up without another word and moved over to
join the ladies.</p>

<p>Larose remained where he was, and a few moments later,
catching the eye of Sir Arnold, who had just come into the
lounge, made a motion with his head that the surgeon should take
the vacant chair nearby.</p>

<p>Sir Arnold strolled leisurely over and sat down. "Well," he
said quietly, "you feel all right now?"</p>

<p>"Quite all right, thank you," replied the detective. He spoke
very quickly. "I'm a detective, as I told you, and I come from
Scotland Yard. My name is Larose, Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the surgeon, and his calm, impassive face
broke into a pleasant smile, "I've heard about you."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the detective, "and I'm going to take you into
my confidence, because you can render a great service to Lady
Ardane by helping me." He bent towards Sir Arnold and spoke very
quietly. "Now during dinner I'm going to let everybody know who I
am"&mdash;his voice hardened&mdash;"and what I am here for. Then
I am going to ask all the men to come with me into the blue
morning room for a short talk." He nodded. "You must understand I
want to get them all in there before any of them can have the
chance of going up to their rooms. Then directly the door is
closed upon us, I shall demand that each of them hand over his
keys, so that I can go through any suitcase or trunk that he is
keeping locked."</p>

<p>"But what on earth for?" asked the surgeon, looking very
puzzled. "What do you expect to find in them?"</p>

<p>"A pistol, and probably narcotics and perhaps a hypodermic
syringe," replied Larose instantly. "The criminal of to-day is
scientific and it is quite on the cards that with any opportunity
to get at Lady Ardane or the child, they may be drugged first."
He nodded again. "Anyhow, I shall be very disappointed if I do
not find something suspicious in the belongings of one of
them."</p>

<p>"And how can I help you then?" asked Sir Arnold.</p>

<p>"By at once consenting to let me make a search when I ask, for
that will make it difficult for anyone else to refuse."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sir Arnold, drily, "so I see I am to act as
decoy."</p>

<p>That night at dinner Larose was at his brightest, and not a
few wondering glances were from time to time cast his direction.
He seemed to have become all at once quite a different man and
was no longer the quiet and rather diffident young colonial they
had hithereto regarded him.</p>

<p>Instead, he spoke now as an experienced man of the world, who
had been brought in contact with many celebrities in his time,
and had acquired a keen insight into human nature, generally. He
told them, too, a lot about Australia; of its wide open spaces,
its vast distances and the many adventures he had had there.</p>

<p>But, as none of them yet knew, he was doing it all for a
purpose, and only waiting for the chance of disclosing in as
careless and casual manner as possible, exactly what his
profession was.</p>

<p>And presently the opportunity came. He had been telling them
about the black trackers and how once, without a single mistake
or false step, one of them had followed unerringly the trackless
bush for ten days upon the trail of a desperado who was wanted
for a murder in New South Wales. He told it very well, and
everyone stayed their conversation to listen. Then when he had
finished, Clive Huntington smiled and showed his beautiful white
teeth.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Maxwell," he said with a glance of sly amusement
round the table, "but you describe everything so graphically,
that you might almost have been there yourself."</p>

<p>"And I was," replied Larose, smiling back. "I was the police
officer in charge. I was a detective-inspector in Sydney then,
and mine was the responsibility to obtain the man's arrest."</p>

<p>An amazed silence followed, and even, it seemed, the well-trained staff had been thrown out of their stride.</p>

<p>Lips were parted and every eye in the room was fastened upon
Larose. It was as if no one there could believe their ears.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose carelessly, "but I've been over here for
more than a year and am attached now to Scotland Yard." He
laughed. "Of course, Maxwell is not my real name. It's Larose,
Gilbert Larose," and he swept his eyes round the table and in a
lightning glance took in the expressions of them all.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane was flushed, but in a proud and queenly way quite
at her ease. Senator Harvey was frowning heavily; the American
seemed most interested; Sir Parry Bardell was looking very
mystified and as if he could not understand it at all; the airman
was scowling; Lord Wonnock looked very shocked; Lestrange was
only bored; Admiral Charters looked as if he were going to burst;
Clive Huntington was looking down his nose and smiling very
thoughtfully and Patricia Howard was simply thrilled.</p>

<p>The girl was the first to break the silence. "And you are
really the great Larose?" she asked breathlessly. "The man who's
always shooting at people and killing them, and who never
fails!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Come, Miss Howard," said the detective with a laugh,
"please don't give me such an awful character, for I assure you I
am a very peaceful man. I only shoot when I have to and
then"&mdash;his face lost its smiling lines&mdash;"I naturally
shoot as straight as I can."</p>

<p>Lord Wonnock cleared his throat "And are you down here in an
official capacity, sir, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Larose readily, "and I want to have a
little talk with all you gentlemen in a few minutes. I am
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, please, Mr. Larose," broke in Lady Ardane quickly,
"but I think I would prefer to explain." She looked round and her
glance took in all at the table. "It is useless to make out to
any of you that I have not been in great anxiety
lately"&mdash;her voice trembled&mdash;"for I have been as
distressed as any mother could be. As you all know, Mr. Naughton
Jones came down to help me, but he was taken ill and had to go
away. Then, upon his advice, I applied for Mr. Larose and we
thought it best that no one here should know who he was. I acted
all upon my own, and until this evening not even the Senator was
aware what I had done. Now"&mdash;and her voice had become quite
firm&mdash;"we think it is best you should all be taken into the
secret and that is why"&mdash;she smiled&mdash;"Mr. Larose has
been making himself known to you just now."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment to draw in a deep breath, and then
went on with some emotion. "I may tell you now that Larose has
already been of great service to me, for he was with me the other
night when that attempt was made to waylay me in my car. He fired
upon them when they were after us, and burst one of their tyres
and that is only how we managed to get away."</p>

<p>Then suddenly all eyes were turned from her to the butler
behind, for the man, ghostly pale, was seen to stagger and almost
fall. One of the footmen rushed up to him, and steadying him upon
his feet, half supported and half carried him from the room.</p>

<p>The incident occasioned no little concern among the ladies and
Lady Ardane herself looked very upset.</p>

<p>"He's served the family for over 30 years," she explained,
"and he's very devoted to me. He's very highly strung and has
been anything but himself these last two weeks."</p>

<p>But Bernard Daller immediately proceeded to bring back the
conversation to Larose.</p>

<p>"And now that we know who this gentleman is," he said
pleasantly, "I expect we are all curious to know in what way it
concerns us."</p>

<p>"Well, I want first to speak to you all, please," said Larose
very quietly. "You gentlemen, only, I mean, and so when we have
finished here, I'll get you all to come with me into the blue
morning-room. Lady Ardane has arranged for it."</p>

<p>"Of course we'll come," said Sir Arnold promptly. "You want to
enlist our help, I suppose."</p>

<p>Larose flashed him a grateful look. The surgeon had spoken in
exactly the right tone and as if it would be only the natural
thing for them to want to come.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, and the ladies having left the room,
Larose moved to the door and held it open.</p>

<p>"Now, please, if you'll oblige me," he said briskly.</p>

<p>Sir Arnold went first, and with Larose following last of all,
to make sure that no one slipped away, they were being shepherded
into the morning-room.</p>

<p>Then, apparently greatly to their surprise, they perceived
that one of the men servants was seated there, in a chair near
the door, but he rose instantly to his feet upon their entrance
and stood to attention with a very grim-set expression upon his
intelligent face. He was Peter Hollins, the one time Assistant
Scoutmaster in Hunstanton, and now the nightwatchman of the
Abbey.</p>

<p>The detective shut the door, locked it and then calmly
proceeded to put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo!" instantly exclaimed Bernard Daller, with a
scowl. "What does this mean? We are prisoners! Eh!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the detective diplomatically, "but I
want to make sure we shall not be interrupted." He moved over to
the window and took up a position so that he was facing then all,
but separated by the width of the table.</p>

<p>"Now," he said sternly, "I'll waste no time on preliminaries,
and you shall all know why I have brought you here." He paused a
moment and let his eyes rove round upon each one.</p>

<p>Then he rapped out like the crack of a whip. "One of you
gentlemen here this afternoon, tried to murder me. Now which of
you was it?"</p>

<p>A dead silence followed, and in the hush it was as if the room
was untenanted and it was the dead of night. His audience stared
incredulously and as if they thought he had gone out of his
mind.</p>

<p>"One-two-three-four," up to nine, counted the detective. "You
are all of you here, the same number as round that wood when one
of you left his station and fired point blank at what you thought
was me, from behind that hedge." He bent down and from the seat
of a chair pushed under the table, whipped out his macintosh and
held it up. "Look, this was hanging over a bush and in the fading
light the assassin made sure it was me and emptied two barrels
into it."</p>

<p>Still the same silence, but some of the faces were white and
strained now, the looks of incredulity having changed to those of
horror.</p>

<p>It was Clive Huntington who at last broke the silence by
striking a match. He had taken out a cigarette.</p>

<p>"A mistake, of course," he said quietly. "Most certainly a
mistake." He looked coolly at the detective. "You say the light
was failing"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"and in a
half-light anything may happen."</p>

<p>"A mistake!" snarled Larose. "A mistake! And he was not ten
paces behind me when he fired! The birds would have been high up
in the air and the macintosh was not three feet above the
ground!"</p>

<p>"But come, Mr. Larose," said Sir Parry huskily, and although
it was evident that he was very much unset, there was
nevertheless a stern and almost angry note in his tones, "you are
not justified in saying it was one of us. It is only conjecture
on your part."</p>

<p>"No conjecture at all," replied Larose sharply. "There was a
gamekeeper at each end of that stretch of road, and I have
questioned them both. They are certain no stranger passed during
that last quarter of an hour, and that it was accessible to only
you nine." He inclined his head and added very solemnly, "And my
life was attempted, gentlemen, because it had become known to one
of you that I was a detective, and here to protect Lady Ardane
and her son." He looked challengingly round. "Now, what have any
of you to say?"</p>

<p>But no one spoke in return. They just stared at the macintosh,
then at the detective, and then back at the macintosh again.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get to business at once," went on Larose, "and
just put your innocence to the test." His eyes again passed
rapidly from one to the other of them and then he nodded in the
direction of young Hollins. "Now, I am going to send this lad up
to all your rooms, and from each room he will bring down any
suitcase, bag, grip or anything that he finds locked. Then you
will please hand over your keys and I will go through your
belongings in front of you all here."</p>

<p>"But what for, Mr. Larose?" asked Senator Harvey with some
irritation. "What has anything that we have in our rooms to do
with your being shot at this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You will learn that in a few minutes," said the detective
sternly "Now, please give me your keys," and he held out his hand
to Sir Arnold, who was standing nearest to him.</p>

<p>With a grim smile the surgeon at once complied, but then a
quiet voice came from behind them all.</p>

<p>"I object," said Theodore Rankin, "on principle. It is an
insult, and I won't put up with it."</p>

<p>"And I object too," said Clive Huntington, who was smiling
blandly, "also&mdash;on principle."</p>

<p>"And I object as well," burst out the airman. "Not on
principle, but because it's the worst piece of cheek I've ever
heard." He glared at Larose. "You say we are not prisoners,
although you've locked the door, and who the devil are you then,
to treat us as if we were pickpockets and thieves?" His anger
rose. "You've no authority for this."</p>

<p>"Oh! Haven't I," snapped Larose. "You make a great mistake
there. I am an emissary of the law, an attempt has been made by
one of you upon my life, and I am justified in taking any means
to find out who is the would-be assassin." His voice was stern
and uncompromising. "Now, I tell you I am going to see the
insides of your trunks."</p>

<p>"Produce your search warrants first, then," sneered the
airman. He scoffed. "We are not quite country bumpkins, sir, nor
entirely ignorant of the law. You can do nothing without an
authority, and I'm not going to knuckle under
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, as if unable to think of an epithet sufficiently
insulting, and then Lestrange spoke up in a very bored sort of
way. "As to the legal aspect, Mr. Larose," he said, "this
gentleman is quite right, for you have no authority, for the
moment, to go through anybody's belongings here." He looked as if
he were trying to suppress a yawn. "After all, too, you have
produced no corroborated testimony that some unknown individual
fired at your macintosh, for there is no evidence before us that
you did not actually fire at it yourself."</p>

<p>Larose almost choked with fury at the studied insolence of the
barrister, but before he could frame any suitable reply, Senator
Harvey broke in quickly.</p>

<p>"As a near relative of Lady Ardane," he said, "I give my
support to these gentlemen in their objections. To insist upon
searching their belongings is not only an insult to them as her
guests, but to my mind it is most ridiculous as well."</p>

<p>Larose had got himself well in hand, and he realised that the
opposition had now become too strong to combat with out further
help.</p>

<p>"Very well, Senator Harvey," he said. "But kindly wait a
minute, will you." He took the key out of his pocket and unlocked
the door; then beckoning to young Hollins, he said, loud enough
for them all to hear, "Go and ask Lady Ardane to spare me a
minute, if she can."</p>

<p>Hollins at once left the room and then Bernard Daller remarked
with another sneer, "Not very chivalrous, Mr. Detective, is
it&mdash;to send for a woman to fight your battle for you?"</p>

<p>Larose made no reply, and they all stood in silence, waiting
for Lady Ardane to appear. But they were not kept waiting long,
for hardly a minute, it seemed, had elapsed before the door
opened and she swept into the room.</p>

<p>She looked paler than usual, but she carried herself with her
head held high and there was no lack of spirit in her
expression.</p>

<p>The detective spoke up at once. "I am sorry to have troubled
you," he said, "but I have asked all these gentlemen for
permission to examine the contents of the suitcases in their
rooms and some of them are refusing to grant it. Now, will you
please try and persuade them?"</p>

<p>But Lady Ardane had not quite taken in what he meant. "You
want to examine their suitcases?" she asked, looking rather
puzzled, and when the detective nodded, her face cleared and she
went on, "Well, why has anyone any objection?" She turned to her
guests and said very quietly, "To oblige me and shorten all this
unpleasantness, kindly consent."</p>

<p>"But, Lady Ardane&mdash;&mdash;" began Daller with a
scowl.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Daller," interrupted Senator Harvey quickly, "but
I'd like to speak to Lady Ardane first." He walked over to the
door, and opening it, held it for her to pass out. "Just a
moment, please, Helen," he said, and then with a backward glance
over his shoulder to the others, he added, "We shan't be two
minutes."</p>

<p>But it was much nearer five minutes before they returned, and
then Larose perceived instantly from her heightened color that
Lady Ardane was upset in some way.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose," she said quickly, and the detective knew
instinctively that she was speaking against her inclinations,
"Senator Harvey is right and you are not justified in asking
these gentlemen for permission to go through their belongings."
She shook her head. "I cannot support your request with
mine."</p>

<p>The detective masked all signs of his bitter disappointment,
and accepted his defeat with a pleasant smile. "All right," he
said quietly, "I'm only sorry I bothered you," and he held open
the door for her to pass out.</p>

<p>He closed the door after her, and returned to his position
before the table. "Well, gentlemen," he said dryly, "if you won't
let me examine your suitcases, then perhaps, very graciously, you
will allow me to ask you a few questions"&mdash;he looked round
upon them all&mdash;"and I'll take Mr. Rankin first."</p>

<p>He, regarded the American very intently and then rapped
out&mdash;"And what, please, were you doing, sir, at one o'clock
this morning, out in the grounds with a pair of binoculars?"</p>

<p>The American looked very wooden.
"Out&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;grounds&mdash;at&mdash;one&mdash;
o'clock?" he repeated. He shook his head. "No, you are quite
mistaken. I was in bed and asleep then."</p>

<p>"No, no, you weren't," said Larose sternly. "I was watching
you for more than a quarter of an hour, before I saw you re-enter
the Abbey through the cloister door."</p>

<p>Rankin did not repeat his denial. "Well, if you watched me, as
you say," he drawled coolly, "for longer than a quarter of an
hour, then you can inform yourself what I was doing and obtain
all the information you want, at its very source."</p>

<p>Larose turned instantly to Sir Parry Bardell. "You have a key
to the cloister door?" he asked. "Then show it to me, please,"
and when the knight held out one on a bunch, the detective
proceeded to examine it very carefully. "Now has this been out of
your possession at all?" he went on.</p>

<p>Sir Parry shook his head and replied instantly, "No."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment, but turning now to the airman and
Clive Huntington, embraced them both with the same glance.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Daller," he said briskly, "perhaps you'll be good
enough to tell us where you met Mr. Huntington before, for you
are old acquaintances, I see."</p>

<p>The airman flushed and for a long moment made no reply. Clive
Huntington was looking very scornful, and started to champ his
jaws as if he were chewing a piece of gum.</p>

<p>"I have known Mr. Huntington," said Daller very slowly and
weighing every word, "for exactly forty-eight hours. Previous to
then I did not know even that he existed."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Huntington," Larose asked sarcastically, "of
course, you subscribe to that?"</p>

<p>"Two days ago," replied Clive Huntington, adopting the slow
and precise tones of the airman. "I did not know of his existence
either."</p>

<p>"What!" thundered the detective, with the quickness of a flash
of lightning, "you a sailor and crossing the Atlantic a score of
times each year in the Bardell steamers, never to have heard of
Bernard Daller, the airman, who has three times made the record
trans-Atlantic flight!"</p>

<p>It was the first time anyone had seen Clive Huntington lose
his pleasant smile. "Oh! I have heard of him in that respect, of
course," he said irritably, "but I meant, as a private
individual."</p>

<p>The detective smiled. One of his shafts had at last gone home.
He turned at once and addressed Admiral Charters.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he snapped, "it is your turn." He emphasised each
word with his finger. "To whom do you signal when you go up in
the tower?"</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned upon the Admiral, who got as red as a
turkey cock. "Darn your impudence," he spluttered furiously, "I
don't signal to anyone. You came sneaking up after me yesterday
and I thought at the time you were spying." He could hardly get
out his words. "I go up there to look at the sea."</p>

<p>"And the unfolded handkerchief, sir, that you were holding in
your hand?" asked Larose scornfully.</p>

<p>"To blow my nose with," barked the Admiral. "Darn your
impudence, again I say."</p>

<p>The detective waved his hand in the direction of the door and
then sank back into an armchair.</p>

<p>"The interview is over, gentlemen," he said, "and you are now
all free to return to your pursuits of innocence." His eyes
glinted. "I have asked questions of many suspected persons in my
time and can generally tell pretty well when they are lying or
speaking the truth."</p>

<p>With disdainful glances from some, but with no comments from
any, they all trooped out of the room, and Larose and the
Assistant Scoutmaster were left alone.</p>

<p>"Well, Hollins," said the detective slowly, "I've only known
you a few hours, but I'm going to trust you quite a lot. As a
scout, you have always, no doubt, hankered after adventure and
you're going to get plenty of it now." He smiled as if it were a
good joke. "You've heard what has just passed, and you can guess
that one or two of those nice gentlemen, who have just gone out,
would stick a knife into me with much pleasure, so with you
acting as my assistant, you are quite likely to get a jab
too."</p>

<p>The young fellow smiled back. "It's all right, sir, I'm quite
willing to take my chance."</p>

<p>Larose eyed him solemnly. "But it's no game, my lad, and so
I'll be giving you a few hints. Here's for one. You've got a
pocket-knife with a sharp blade? Good! Well, when you go on duty
into the hall to-night, have it open in one of the side pockets
of your jacket. It will come in very handy then if anybody necks
you from behind. I've saved my life twice that way." He nodded.
"You can go now, but I shall be wanting you to-night and
mind"&mdash;he held up a warning finger&mdash;"not a whisper to
anyone about me."</p>

<p>Then with the departure of young Hollins, the detective
proceeded to weigh up the situation.</p>

<p>"Well, it's no good to imagine that I am not very
disappointed," ran his thoughts, "for I am. But I don't blame
that red-headed young woman at all, for there was undoubtedly
something behind her refusal to support me, and I shall be
learning what it was in due time." He smiled cheerfully. "Now I
rattled some of those gentlemen quite a good bit, and I certainly
put a lot of my cards upon the table. But I meant to do it, for
these guests here can't be all guilty, and now I've made them
suspicious of one another, and they'll be watching amongst
themselves."</p>

<p>He nodded. "But I've just been told a good few lies, and of
that I'm quite sure. The airman and Huntington were lying, and
that Yankee chap too, also"&mdash;his face puckered to a
frown&mdash;"I'm just a little bit suspicious about Sir Parry.
His 'no' was so very ready when I asked about the key, and
exactly as if he had been expecting the question."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Well, never mind about their lies for the
present, for I've something much more urgent to tackle right
away." He looked very puzzled. "Now how did they get to know so
quickly that I was an enemy and had been planted here to watch?
I'm sure I've done nothing to give myself away, for I've never
been seen talking to Lady Ardane for more than a few seconds, and
then we've spoken very quietly and with no one by us, so that we
could not possibly have been overheard. I've been with her twice
in her boudoir, but the door and window were shut both times." He
stopped suddenly and then went on very slowly. "Ah! but I'm
inclined, somehow, to be rather suspicious about that little
room!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a long while, and then with a sharp snap of
his fingers, he exclaimed, "Yes, there have been matters that
have been talked about only in that boudoir of hers, that have
very speedily become known to the gang! To my certain knowledge
two, and"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"perhaps three; the proposed
excursion on the morrow to those Brancaster Sands, the
arrangements that the head chauffeur had made for bringing out
the riflemen from Hunstanton and&mdash;surely my talk with her
last night when she kept on saying, 'Mr. Larose.'"</p>

<p>His heart began to thump quickly. "Great Scott!" he went on,
"and the explanation of it all could be so very simple if
conversations in there could be overheard, not through the
keyhole or the window, but through the large ventilator, above
her writing desk and facing the bedroom door."</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers again and whistled softly. "Yes, I must
learn where that ventilator opens out."</p>

<p>Midnight had just sounded, and the detective and young Hollins
were padding softly along one of the passages upon the third, and
top floor, of the Abbey. They were carrying a 12-foot ladder
between them.</p>

<p>Arriving at the end of the passage the detective flashed a
torch upon the ceiling and nodded to his companion.</p>

<p>"All right," he whispered; "that's the one, and mind the
ladder doesn't slip when we get it up. You must wait, and not
make a sound. I may be gone ten minutes or it may be an hour for
the roof's large and I'll have to climb over those rafters like a
cat. Now, up with it quickly."</p>

<p>The ladder was lifted into position with its topmost rung less
than a foot below a small trap-door in the ceiling. The detective
mounted quickly and pushed up the door.</p>

<p>"Now don't get anxious," he whispered down, as a final
injunction as he climbed through the opening, "and if you hear
any noises, you'll know that they'll only be mine."</p>

<p>As Larose had expected, the roof loomed very wide and long,
and as he swept his torch round, it seemed as spacious as a
cathedral. Its ends and sides were lost in the shadows, and in
all directions there stretched a vast sea of rafters, with
hundreds and hundreds of small iron pipes everywhere.</p>

<p>"And I hope they well and truly insulate the electric wires,"
he muttered, regarding the pipes a little doubtfully, "for I
shall be touching them nearly the whole of the time."</p>

<p>He took a long look round to get his bearings. "Now, I go
east," he went on, "towards the rising sun, for all the bedrooms
of the guests face that way and I shall probably find a well for
the electric light pipes going down in each corner."</p>

<p>Quickly, but with great care, he proceeded to cross over the
rafters. He counted a hundred of them and then stopped for a
short rest. "Gosh!" he exclaimed, "but I shall have to be careful
or I'll get bushed, and not be able to find my way back."</p>

<p>He walked over more than another hundred and then, just as he
was beginning to think he must surely have been travelling in a
circle, he saw the roof taking a downward slope, and in the
corner yawned a large square opening.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he whispered, "the well where the pipes go, but
now, how the deuce do the electricians get down?"</p>

<p>He was soon, however, relieved of all anxiety upon that score,
for his eyes fell upon an iron ladder bolted to one of the sides
of the well. The ladder was very narrow and barely a foot in
width.</p>

<p>He bent over and pulled strongly at it to make sure it would
bear his weight. But it was securely bolted and as immovable as a
rock.</p>

<p>With no delay, then, he entrusted himself to it, and started
to go down, stopping, however, every now and then to ascertain
how far he had descended.</p>

<p>Presently, when he judged he must have come down 20 feet, and
could not now be far above the floor level of the first story of
the building, he perceived a sort of side shaft, leading off at
right angles to the main shaft he had been descending.</p>

<p>He stepped off the ladder and found himself in a long passage
between two walls, lined as the well had been, with the
innumerable iron pipes, conducting the electric wires, but now
added to these were much larger pipes of lead.</p>

<p>"The water service," he exclaimed, "and very easy to get at if
anything goes wrong!"</p>

<p>The passage was very narrow and he edged along sideways to get
as little dust as possible upon his clothes, then flashing his
torch up, he saw a long line of ventilators just above the level
of his head and extending along the passage farther than the rays
of his torch would reach.</p>

<p>"And those are the ventilators opening into the bedrooms," he
whispered, "and my room should not be far off here."</p>

<p>But suddenly he trailed his torch down upon his feet, and then
for a few seconds switched it off altogether, for in the distance
he had seen a glow of light coming out from one of the
ventilators.</p>

<p>"Ah! a night-bird," he exclaimed, "and so someone's not gone
to bed yet"&mdash;he made a grimace of disappointment&mdash;"but
the ventilator will be just too high for me to see through."</p>

<p>But then approaching nearer and flashing on his torch again,
to his amazement he saw that under this very ventilator that was
showing the light was a small wooden box, about 2 feet in
height.</p>

<p>"Gee!" was his startled comment, "and it's been placed there
on purpose for someone to see through."</p>

<p>Instantly, then, he switched off his torch and mounted the
box. His eyes were then just level with the ventilator, and
peering through, he gave a gasp in which consternation and
triumph were both blended.</p>

<p>He was looking straight down into Lady Ardane's boudoir. The
door leading into the bedroom was wide open, and he saw Lady
Ardane in the very act of getting into bed.</p>

<p>His heart beat furiously. Then this was the secret of it all.
Into the passage had come the spy, upon the box it had been his
wont to take his stand, and a few feet only below his eyes, he
had both seen and heard everything that had been taking place in
the room below!</p>

<p>And then the detective began to blush furiously, and he ground
his teeth in his rage. So this wretch, perhaps night after night,
had been spying upon Lady Ardane and she, poor creature, if she
only knew it, would die of shame!</p>

<p>Fascinated, he watched her settle herself comfortably down
into the bed. She sank her red head into the pillow, she pulled
the bed-clothes warmly up around her neck, one beautifully
moulded arm came into view for two seconds and then&mdash;the
light was gone.</p>

<p>"And a good thing, too," growled Larose, angry that for a few
seconds he had been playing the spy himself, "a darned good
thing, for otherwise that young chap might have been waiting for
me all night."</p>

<p>And then the great significance of his discovery thrilled
through him and his face glowed with delight.</p>

<p>"And now," he exclaimed, "it should be easy to discover at
least one of the conspirators, for he will come here again, and I
shall have only to watch to catch him." His face clouded over.
"But how the devil does he get up here? He certainly doesn't come
the way I came."</p>

<p>He stepped softly off the box, and flashing his torch again,
continued to make his way quickly along the narrow passage. He
passed eleven ventilators and then another opening yawned before
his feet, but, as before, there was an iron ladder running down
the side and with no hesitation this time he climbed on to
it.</p>

<p>But his descent took much longer now before he finally landed
into a sort of little square chamber that formed the bottom of
the well. Three sides of the chamber were of concrete, but the
wall of the fourth consisted of planks of rough wood.</p>

<p>There was no door to be seen anywhere, and for a few seconds
the detective thought there was no means of getting out, but
passing his hands over the planks, he felt two of them were
loose, and a very brief examination showed him that the ends of
both of them were unnailed and retained in their positions only
by short cross pieces of wood. He lifted them up from the bottom,
and pushing them apart, stepped out between them.</p>

<p>He found himself in a small untidy lumber-room, littered
everywhere with miscellaneous articles appertaining to the
building and decorating trade. Pots of paint, tins of calsomine,
whitewash, sacks of lime and brushes of all descriptions.</p>

<p>Making no sound, he crossed over to the door and softly
turning the handle, found it was unlocked.</p>

<p>He stepped into a long passage outside, and flashed his torch
up and down, but he was now in a part of the building in which he
had never been before, and it was not until he had proceeded for
quite 50 yards, in a direction that he knew must eventually lead
to the main door, that he could get his bearings.</p>

<p>Then in the distance he saw the door of the library, and
switching off his torch, he stood considering what his next move
must be.</p>

<p>"No," he told himself at last. "I'll go back the way I came.
It'll be a dirty climb, but I won't startle that lad by appearing
from another direction." So he passed back through the lumber-room, and pushed to the boards behind him.</p>

<p>"Now, in the ordinary way," he whispered, "there should be
plenty of finger-prints about, but I take it that if anyone is
accustomed to come here pretty often, it is almost certain, that
knowing how dusty it is, he will be wearing gloves to keep his
hands clean."</p>

<p>And that he was quite right in this conjecture was apparent
when he reached the top of the first ladder again, for, upon the
landing just above the well, he could see plainly where someone
had placed his hand to climb up into the passage. But the
impression in the dust was broad and blurred, and certainly, he
knew, could not have been made by a naked hand.</p>

<p>He regained the roof without any more discoveries, and was
welcomed with great relief by young Hollins.</p>

<p>"I was afraid something had happened to you, sir," whispered
the boy, "and was wondering what I should have to do. Have you
seen anything interesting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something very interesting," replied the detective,
smiling to himself, "but now we'll put back this ladder and then
I'm off to bed."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>

THE HOUSE ON THE MARSH</h2>

<p class="first">IT was an hour and longer, after Larose had
tucked himself into bed, before sleep at last came to him.</p>

<p>He had thrown off his clothes on the full determination that
it should be only a matter of minutes before he would be in the
land of forgetfulness, and dead to all his troubles.</p>

<p>He relaxed his limbs peacefully, drew in slow, deep breaths,
and tried to imagine he was falling from a great height. He
turned his tightly-closed eyes upwards and inwards, and he fell,
fell, fell into unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>But it was all to no purpose, for his mind was much too
active, and would keep on reverting to the perplexities he was
in.</p>

<p>Why had Lady Ardane gone into the grounds during the night?
Why had she agreed that the belongings of no one should be
searched? Why had the Senator been against it too? Was it really
possible that it was not the American whom he had seen go through
the cloister door? Why had Admiral Charters lied about the
handkerchief? What had Daller and Huntington to hide, and why had
they lied too?</p>

<p>He shook his head angrily. Of course these last two were old
acquaintances! He had been struck with their easy and intimate
attitudes towards each other, the very first night when they had
arrived, and he had noted that always when they were together
their voices were lowered as if all they were saying was of a
private and confidential nature.</p>

<p>And who, then, was the man who had been standing on the box
and&mdash;but at last the detective succeeded in falling over his
favorite precipice and sleep overtook him.</p>

<p>But the worry and tossing about had played havoc with his
subconscious willpower, and instead of waking up, as he had
intended, at half-past six, it was nearly an hour later before he
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>He was intensely annoyed, for, arranging with Lady Ardane that
henceforth he should have all his meals in the housekeeper's
room, the latter lady had informed him that 7.30 was the
breakfast time with her.</p>

<p>He had mapped out, too, such a busy programme for the day,
for, notwithstanding he had a most profound faith in the acumen
of Naughton Jones, he was going yet again over all the latter's
ground, and intending to pass under review every employee in the
Abbey.</p>

<p>He made his toilet hurriedly and proceeded with all speed to
the housekeeper's room, to find, however, as he had expected,
that the housekeeper and Polkinghorne, the butler, had already
started the meal. They both rose at once upon his entrance, and
Polkinghorne looked very nervous. It was evident that the latter
did not relish sitting now at table with one whose wants he had
been so recently attending to, among Lady Ardane's distinguished
guests.</p>

<p>Polkinghorne was a portly man, about 50 years of age, heavy of
feature, and with big, grey ox-like eves, and the traditional
side-whiskers of followers of his calling. Beside him, upon
another chair, sat a beautiful Persian cat, looking very smart in
a bright red collar to which was attached a large silver
bell.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm late," said Larose, with a most apologetic
smile, "but I overslept myself, a thing I very seldom do, for,
when upon any case"&mdash;he spoke as if it were a good
joke&mdash;"we detectives are really not supposed to take any
sleep at all."</p>

<p>He had purposely at once brought in his profession, for he had
always found that in the easy and informal conversation of a
meal, most people would reply more naturally to any questions
that were asked, and also, would be much less upon their guard if
they had anything to hide.</p>

<p>The housekeeper, Miss Baines, was a tall, refined-looking
woman of good appearance, and she at once took up the
conversation.</p>

<p>"We are very glad to know that it is you who are here, Mr.
Larose," she said quickly and as if she were a little nervous
too. "We've all heard of you, of course, and it is a great relief
to us that her ladyship is in such good hands."</p>

<p>"But I shall want all the help everyone can give me," said
Larose looking intently at the butler, "and the staff ought to be
able to help me quite a lot."</p>

<p>"I'm sure we'll do our best, sir," said Polkinghorne, uneasy
at the hard scrutiny of the detective, "for we know we are all
under a cloud." He looked very troubled. "The gentleman from
Norwich, sir, will have it that it is one of us who cut those
wires, and Inspector Dollard gave us a terrible gruelling."</p>

<p>"But it must have been someone who's well acquainted with the
Abbey," said Larose sharply, "for he knew where to find that
ladder he wanted."</p>

<p>"That's true, sir," admitted the butler gloomily, "and he
chose his time well, too. The telephone is used very little in
the evening, and that night, except for Senator Harvey's trunk
call, no one went to it from before six, until her ladyship tried
to get the exchange when she came in."</p>

<p>The detective's memory was a good one. "The Senator was
ringing up the chemist, wasn't he?" he asked with studied
carelessness.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, sir, it was a trunk call to Norwich. I happened to
overhear him as he put it in." The butler smiled. "We have a good
chemist in Burnham Market and don't need to ring up Norwich for
anything. We are not so out of the world as all that."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" thought the detective. "Then I must make an enquiry
there. I understood the Senator said it was the chemist he had
been ringing up." He looked intently at the Butler again. "And
you feel quite all right this morning, Mr. Polkinghorne.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," replied the butler. He shook his head
disgustedly. "It was very foolish of me to have become faint last
night, but until her ladyship spoke, I hadn't realised in what
danger she had really been. It was a great shock to me." His
heavy features lightened. "You see, sir, I was in America with
Sir Charles when he went courting her. I was his valet at the
time. I watched it all, and then I even accompanied them upon
their honeymoon. Then I came here, and the child was born." His
voice quavered. "So you'll understand, sir, how I feel. I've
watched her grow up and she has such trust in me. I have a big
staff here to look after for her."</p>

<p>The detective enjoyed his meal, and in rising from the table,
remarked upon the beauty of the cat. The butler's face at once
glowed with pleasure. "He's an aristocrat, sir," he said
enthusiastically, "and he's been three times champion of Norfolk.
He's won seven cups for me, and I have his pedigree right back
for eleven generations, to the world champion, Assyrian King. He
has two wives, sir, Marie Antoinette and Queen of Sheba." He
pursed up his lips, and looked very important. "I paid a lot of
money for them."</p>

<p>The detective appeared duly impressed. "But good gracious!" he
exclaimed, "why on earth has he got that bell upon his collar.
He'll never get near any mouse."</p>

<p>The butler looked shocked. "Mouse-meat, sir," he said very
gravely, "is bad for his coat, and I put that bell there on
purpose, so that he shall never catch any." He drew himself up
proudly. "Breeding Persians is my hobby, sir, and I have made a
great study of it."</p>

<p>The detective had a very busy morning, and with the notes of
Naughton Jones before him, one by one, went through all the
domestic staff. Some of the maids, as he had noted upon that
first night at dinner, were very pretty, and he congratulated
himself upon his judgment when he found that not a few of them
were of quite gentle birth. Lady Ardane was always most
particular, the housekeeper told him, and as she paid very high
wages, she could pick and choose wherever she wanted to.</p>

<p>And it was the same, he found, with the men. There was not one
of them of a coarse type, and he could light on nothing of a
suspicious nature in any of their histories or demeanors.</p>

<p>"Now," he asked himself, when the last of them had left the
room, "who among these young men and women, for the butler and
the housekeeper seem to be the only middle-aged employees here,
would be likely to spy upon their mistress and report upon their
spying to do her harm?" He thought for a long time, and then
shook his head. "Not one of them that I can see, for there are
none of them of the type."</p>

<p>He went on. "Still, I've got a splendid card to play, for I'll
watch in that lumber-room to-night, and very likely catch the spy
red-handed. But first I must go there this afternoon and prepare
a snug little hiding place among those sacks and tins."</p>

<p>As with breakfast, he took his early midday dinner in the
company of the housekeeper and the butler, and several times
during the course of the meal it struck him most forcibly that
the latter was now very nervous and uneasy.</p>

<p>The man only pecked at his food, and seemed very preoccupied,
and the detective would have sworn that he had some trouble on
his mind. He spoke very little, too, and then only when he was
directly addressed.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," thought the detective, "that I upset him this
morning by those personal questions that I asked. Still, I had to
examine him like everyone else, and he's only just one of the
servants to me."</p>

<p>The meal over and with the butler departing to superintend the
serving of the luncheon in the dining-room, Larose had quite a
long chat with the housekeeper, but the sum-total of all he
learnt there seemed to be, as Miss Patricia Howard had stressed
to him, that all the eligible men were wanting to marry Lady
Ardane.</p>

<p>"All except Sir Parry Bardell," said the housekeeper, "and he
knows he's too elderly." She laughed. "But he acts the part of a
watch-dog and keeps the others away. He's like a father to her
ladyship and I don't know what she'd do without him."</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the afternoon, and with everybody out of
the way, the detective set out for the lumber-room to prepare his
hiding place for the night.</p>

<p>Encountering no one upon his journey, he passed the library
and entered the long passage. Then just as he arrived at the door
of the lumber-room, and was about to turn the handle, he started
as if a wasp had stung him, for he had distinctly heard someone
moving about inside.</p>

<p>He listened for two seconds to make sure, and then darted on
up the passage, and flattened himself against the wall. There was
no window anywhere near there, and he was confident that he would
not be noticed in the gloom.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, and he heard the handle of the door turn
and then saw a man step into the passage. The man was slow and
stealthy in his movements, and shutting the door very softly, he
took a key out of his pocket and locked it. Then, with head bent
and shoulders bowed, he remained standing perfectly still and in
the unmistakable attitude of one who was listening. His back was
turned towards the detective, and he never once glanced in the
direction where the latter was hiding.</p>

<p>Then all at once he straightened himself up and tip-toeing
swiftly off, disappeared round the corner by the library
door.</p>

<p>The detective was dumbfounded, for the man&mdash;was
Polkinghorne, the butler.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" he ejaculated, moistening his dry lips with his
tongue, "but who would have thought it? The last man I should
have picked out as a conspirator!" He shook his head vexatiously.
"I can hardly believe it."</p>

<p>Waiting a good two minutes to make certain that the butler was
not going to return, Larose hastened up to examine the door.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's locked right enough," he frowned, "and with a
darned good lock too. One of those new patent ones with triple
springs, and I doubt if I can pick it, without damage which will
show." He made a grimace and then sighed. "Well, this is another
surprise, and I'll have to concentrate now upon shadowing this
precious butler every moment he's off duty." He looked at his
watch. "Half-past three, and next, I'll have a little talk with
Lady Ardane."</p>

<p>He enquired of one of the footmen where Lady Ardane was, and
learning that she was outside in the garden, made his way there
to find her. She saw him coming and detached herself at once from
her aunt and Mrs. Charters, with whom she had been talking, and
advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," she said pleasantly, "I hear you've been
very busy."</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes, I have been." he replied. "I've had a talk
with everyone of the staff"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"but I can't
say I got much out of it. They all seem all right."</p>

<p>She looked worried at once. "That's what I've always thought,"
she replied. "My enemy cannot be among them." She was silent for
a moment and then asked quickly, "But what is it you want now,
Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"A lot of things," he replied vaguely, and then looked sharply
at her, "but I don't quite know what to make of you."</p>

<p>She sensed instantly to what he was referring, and her color
heightened. "I am very sorry that I had to side with my step-father, Mr. Larose," she said, "but there are some things I am
not able to explain to you. They are not my secrets, and I can't
tell them to you." She spoke very firmly. "But you can be quite
certain you are not being hindered in any way."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like it," said Larose sharply, "for at a time
like this there should be no half-confidences. I'm not too
popular with some of these gentry here, and they're taking
unpleasant means to let me know it. So anything that would help
to put me further on my guard should be told to me."</p>

<p>She seemed quite distressed. "But I assure you, Mr. Larose,
these things I am not able to tell you are not harmful to you in
any way. If they were"&mdash;and her bosom rose and fell in her
emotion&mdash;"I wouldn't be a party to them for a second and you
should be told instantly."</p>

<p>The detective was impressed by her earnestness. "Very well,
then," he said. "I'll rely upon your common-sense." He nodded
quickly. "But now you'll have to do something I want you to, and
do it without questioning, please."</p>

<p>"I'll do it if I can," she replied submissively, "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"It's about that boudoir of yours," he said. "I don't like
that room, and it's been unlucky for us both. Things you talked
about there have been given away at once, and I'm thinking they
got to know who I was from our conversation there, too." He spoke
very solemnly. "So if you please, in future, you'll say nothing
there that everyone may not know about and also"&mdash;he
hesitated a moment&mdash;"I suggest you close the boudoir door
whenever you go into your bedroom. You understand?"'</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem much sense in it," she replied, "but still
I'll do as you tell me." She laughed. "I suppose it's one of your
secrets, to pay me back for one of mine."</p>

<p>For the remainder of that afternoon and during all that
evening, taking good care, however, that the man should by no
possibility learn that he was being watched, Larose kept his eye
upon the butler.</p>

<p>But he got absolutely no reward for his pains, for when off
duty, Polkinghorne never once left the sitting-room which he
shared with the housekeeper, being absorbed the whole time in the
perusal of a small volume entitled 'Cats and Their Management in
Health and Diseases.' At supper he still looked nervous and
worried, partaking most sparingly of the excellent fare
provided.</p>

<p>One little incident, however, had struck the detective, and
that was, when passing through the lounge just before the house
party had been summoned into dinner, he had seen Polkinghorne and
the Senator talking very earnestly together. Their heads had been
almost touching, and Polkinghorne had been speaking rapidly as if
he had been pouring some very important piece of information in
the Senator's ear. Then upon one of the ladies coming near to
them, they had broken away instantly with the Senator's lips
framing what looked very much like the word "hush."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed Larose, more puzzled than ever, "but that's
funny. It looks as if the Senator were in this too!"</p>

<p>Just before ten he secreted himself at the end of the passage
and prepared to await with all patience the appearance again of
the butler at the lumber-room door.</p>

<p>And it was well he had patience for the passage was cold and
the time passed very slowly. Half-past ten came, eleven and then
half-past again. Finally, he heard midnight chime without
anything happening, and then waiting yet another twenty minutes,
he gave up the vigil in disgust and prepared to mount to his
room.</p>

<p>He tried the door in passing, but it was still locked.</p>

<p>"But I cannot be mistaken," he reflected, as he was talking
off his clothes, "for if ever I saw stealth and secrecy in a
man's actions, I saw then this afternoon in Polkinghorne's when
he was at that lumber-room door."</p>

<p>The following morning he rose early and descending into the
sitting-room a few minutes before half-past seven found only the
housekeeper there.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Polkinghorne's not down yet!" he remarked. "I was
afraid I should be last again."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. Mr. Polkinghorne's down," replied the housekeeper.
"He was here quite a quarter or an hour ago, but he bustled off
somewhere in a great hurry," she smiled, "which is rather
unusual, for he is a great one for the morning newspaper."</p>

<p>The detective rose instantly to his feet and, making the
excuse that he had forgotten his handkerchief, hurried away in
the direction of the lumber-room.</p>

<p>"And there's a good chance he's on the spy," he panted, "for
the nurse will most probably be going to Lady Ardane's bedroom
every morning about this time, to get the little boy and receive
her orders for the day." He thrilled with excitement. "Great
Scott! if I only catch him coming out."</p>

<p>And catch him coming out, he did, for he had just reached the
door of the lumber-room when it opened and he was face to face
with the very startled Thomas Polkinghorne.</p>

<p>The butler was pale, with staring eyes, and he was breathing
quickly, but then before the detective had uttered a single word,
and to his great astonishment, the man made a gesture of
authority as if he were in command of the situation.</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't talk loudly," he exclaimed. "How is it you have
come here?" and he interposed his body to prevent the advance of
the detective.</p>

<p>Larose gritted his teeth and was upon the very point of
gripping the butler by the collar when in an instant the
expression upon the latter's face under went a startled change,
and in place of alarm and apprehension, there was now all triumph
and delight.</p>

<p>"She's got five!" he ejaculated. "Three tabbies and two toms,
and she's drunk the milk and eaten all the meat I gave her, and
the Senator is going up to five guineas for one of them."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" thundered Larose.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" exclaimed Polkinghorne angrily and with all his
appearance of alarm coming back, "don't speak so loudly or you'll
frighten her." Then something in the detective's face seemed to
pull him up and with an effort he became the quiet and respectful
butler once again. "It's Marie Antoinette, sir," he exclaimed
breathlessly, "and she's got five kittens. She's most highly
bred, sir, and very temperamental, and a strange voice may upset
her. She's been a great worry to me, for at her last kittening
she wouldn't take any notice of her children, but just left them,
and they all died." He took out a handkerchief and wiped the
sweat upon his forehead. "She had too many visitors, sir, and
that was the trouble, but this time I didn't let anyone know when
she was due, and I brought her here, and not a soul knows where
she is."</p>

<p>Then it seemed that, realising he had spoken with some heat in
his excitement, he was now anxious to make some atonement for it,
and so, stepping back into the lumber-room, he motioned to the
detective to enter.</p>

<p>"Just one peep, sir," he whispered. "I think I can allow
that."</p>

<p>And all this time a medley of tumultuous and disturbing
thoughts had been rioting through the detective's brain.</p>

<p>Triumph and exaltation, perplexity, profound disappointment,
intense disgust with himself, and finally a feeling of real
sorrow that he had so misjudged a harmless and very simple-minded
man.</p>

<p>So he followed humbly after the butler, and as if greatly
appreciative of the honor conferred upon him, gazed with becoming
reverence upon a beautiful-looking grey tabby, snugly ensconced
in a small packing case.</p>

<p>But he was not allowed to gaze long before the obsession of a
breeder of prize Persian cats, again mastered the traditional
servility of the butler, and Polkinghorne plucking him by the
sleeve, would have pulled him almost forcibly away.</p>

<p>"But what a funny little room!" exclaimed the detective,
beginning now to recover his equanimity, and looking round most
interestedly. "And why is that side boarded up?"</p>

<p>"It isn't boarded up, sir," replied the butler quickly, and
anxious at all costs to get the detective away from the vicinity
of his highly-bred and temperamental cat. "Some of those planks
are loose, and you can get through them into the electric service
well, which leads on to the roof."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" remarked Larose. "Have you ever been up
there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Polkinghorne. "A least, only part of the
way." He smiled. "I've seen the passage and it's too narrow for a
man of my bulk." He was most respectful. "But if you don't mind,
sir, we'll come away now and let this little mother be quite
quiet." They proceeded into the passage and the door was very
softly locked behind them.</p>

<p>"Do you always keep that room locked up?" asked the detective
carelessly, as they moved away. "Except for that very lovely cat
of yours, there doesn't seem to be anything valuable there."</p>

<p>"No, sir, it's never locked in the ordinary way," replied the
butler, "and indeed, I had a great job to rout out the key. But I
shall keep it locked now until to-morrow, and then I must move
Marie Antoinette, for the place is much more draughty than I
thought."</p>

<p>He was quite a different man at breakfast, and all his
nervousness seemed to have passed away.</p>

<p>"And to think that I wasted all those hours upon him," sighed
the detective under his breath, "and cut short a good night's
rest by at least two hours."</p>

<p>Directly breakfast was over Larose set off to see what luck he
would have with the strange tenants of the house upon the marsh.
He had commissioned young Hollins to make some enquiries about
them in the village, and had learnt, somewhat to his
satisfaction, that although they were known to have been residing
in the stone house for more than six weeks, they had never
visited the village, and no one had even any idea what they were
like in appearance.</p>

<p>"They're shy birds right enough, sir," had been the comment of
young Hollins, "and no one knows, even, exactly how many of them
there are there. They've got two bicycles, but when they go out
on them they wear big scarves and their caps are pulled so low
down upon their heads that no one can tell if they are seeing the
same ones upon different days. One of them has colored
glasses."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" had exclaimed the detective. "They seem the very
kind of gentlemen I want, and I'll go and get as near to them as
I can."</p>

<p>But no one could be more wary and circumspect than was Larose
when it was necessary, and he fully realised that if these men
had anything to do with those he was after, then they would be on
guard all the time and on the look out for anyone watching their
movements.</p>

<p>Added to that, too, if the men did belong to the gang, they
would by now be quite aware that he, Larose, was in the
neighborhood, and doubly on the lookout, in that case for anyone
answering to his description.</p>

<p>But of course, he told himself, they might be quite harmless,
inoffensive men, and here, as with the butler, he might be
wasting all his time. Still, he must try and find out something
about them, and the difficulty was, he could not approach them
openly, and without being seen, would not be able to get nearer
to the house than four or five hundred yards.</p>

<p>He made a wide detour round the marsh and approached his
objective by way of the line of high sandhills that stretched
along the shore. Then he lay down among the tall sand-grass and
glued his eyes to his binoculars. Upon his left, also in good
view, was the hut of Henrik the fisherman.</p>

<p>There were no signs of life about the stone house, and it
looked quite untenanted. The door was shut and no smoke was
rising from the chimneys.</p>

<p>For more than two hours he lay motionless. The sky was
overcast and a cold east wind was blowing and he was glad of the
shelter that the tall grass gave him.</p>

<p>At last, when he had put down his glasses to rest for a
moment, and was upon the point of sitting up, to chafe his
stiffened limbs, a movement in the distance caught his eye, and
he saw a car leaving the bitumen road, about a mile away, and
turn off across the marshes.</p>

<p>Up went his glasses again. "Well, here's a little diversion
anyhow," he told himself, "if the car even passes right by."</p>

<p>But he soon saw that the car was not going to pass right by,
instead, to his great joy, he saw it make straight for the stone
house. It was a touring car, with one man in it, and approaching
rapidly and driven with great confidence along the muddy and
tortuous road, it was evident that its driver was well acquainted
with every dip and corner.</p>

<p>Reaching the house, it swept round sharply, stopped, and was
then backed smartly into an open shed, that was obviously more
accustomed to cows than cars.</p>

<p>Then a man sprang out and walked up quickly towards the house
door. He had got his back to the detective and was wearing a long
overcoat and a cap with carflaps to it, tied under the chin, so
that all idea Larose could form of him was that he was tall and
of a rather slight build. He was carrying a parcel under his
arm.</p>

<p>His approach to the house had evidently been noted by someone
inside, for before he reached it the door was opened wide. He
walked in and the door was now left open.</p>

<p>"And a good thing that I didn't go straight up," remarked
Larose. "Fancy! I've been here a solid two hours and not seen a
sign of life, and yet all the time, perhaps, someone has been
watching behind those windows, on the lookout for this chap to
arrive."</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, the door was banged to, and then suddenly
the detective saw three men moving away from the back of the
house and proceeding along the marsh road in the direction of the
bitumen. Two of them were pushing bicycles before them, and
apparently they were all conversing animatedly together.</p>

<p>Larose with his eyes glued to his glasses, followed every step
they made until they gained the bitumen road. It was evident, he
surmised, that the two with the bicycles were finding the road
too muddy to negotiate except on foot. Reaching the bitumen road,
suddenly the man without a bicycle disappeared, and the other
two, mounting their machines, had gone quite three hundred yards
away before the detective could see what had happened to him.</p>

<p>The man had squatted low down at the bottom of a thick hedge,
and from his attitude it was evident he did not want to be seen
by any passers-by upon the road. The detective's glasses were
very good ones, and he saw the man take a newspaper out of his
pocket and commence to read.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said, "then he's going stop there some time, and it
looks exactly as if he's on the watch."</p>

<p>Feeling certain that there was no one left in the house,
because the door had been banged to in a manner as if to make
sure it would shut securely, the detective rose quickly to his
feet and made off in its direction.</p>

<p>Then, to his amazement, he almost stumbled upon the recumbent
figure of Henrik, in a thick clump of grass, not twenty yards
from where he had been lying.</p>

<p>He swore under his breath, for he realised instantly that the
man must have been there all the time and might have been a
spectator of all his watching through the binoculars.</p>

<p>But the man was lying in the attitude of one in a profound
slumber. He was on his side, his head was buried in the crook of
one arm and upon the hand of the other arm, stretched to its full
length, was the filthy bandage covering his wound.</p>

<p>Taking no risks, the detective bent over him, but Henrik was
breathing evenly and he stank of rum.</p>

<p>"Drunk!" muttered Larose. "The filthy beast!"</p>

<p>Wasting no further time, the detective ran over to the house,
with the full intention of effecting an entrance somewhere.</p>

<p>But he soon found that the idea was not too feasible. Both
doors had good stout locks that could not be picked all at once,
and the windows were all well bolted, indeed, so immovable were
the frames there that he was almost of opinion there were screws
somewhere inside.</p>

<p>Very disgusted, he was about to make a determined attack upon
the back door with a piece of stout wire and a pair of pincers
that he had brought with him, when pausing for a moment to take a
good look all round he thought better of it.</p>

<p>The country was so open and over-looked behind him, and either
the Admiral with his binoculars, or Sir Parry with his telescope,
if they only happened to be on the lookout, could pick him up as
easily as a fly upon the wall. Added to that, he noted there was
a slight rise in the marsh road, not two hundred yards away, and
if the man whom he had seen squatting under the hedge should
return unexpectedly, then he, Larose, if he were fiddling with
the door, would be caught red-handed and without any warning.</p>

<p>So giving up all thoughts of breaking into the house, he went
round to the shed where the motor had been garaged.</p>

<p>Now it was always the pride of Larose that he tried to be most
thorough in everything, and that morning after his inspection of
that car in the shed he was certain that he had overlooked
nothing.</p>

<p>He went over it, discouraged the whole time by the enervating
thought that he might perhaps be wasting all his energy upon a
perfectly upright and law-abiding man, for, as he told himself
many times, he had nothing really tangible against the inmates of
the house.</p>

<p>Added to that, he was hampered in his investigations by his
train of thought being continually broken, when with the passing
of every minute, almost, he had to bob out of the shed and look
round to make sure that none of the men were returning. He had no
mind to be caught there in a trap.</p>

<p>But he reckoned that in the end he had made a good job of it.
He took its number, of course, and he was puzzled that he could
not get the engine number as well, but the latter he could not
find anywhere. He examined all the tyres, noting the condition
and approximate age of each one. He crawled underneath and
scraped at the different kinds of mud upon the chassis. He tried
to estimate about how much petrol had been used from the tank and
he poked about in the honeycomb of the radiator.</p>

<p>Then the inside of the car came under his inspection, and
after he had passed under review the mats and upholstering, one
by one, he examined the contents of the pockets in all the doors.
He found the remains of some sandwiches, wrapped in a plain white
paper, and he even took the trouble to open the sandwiches and
find out of what they were made. Then he examined the contents of
a pocket flask and poured some of it into the palm of his hand.
Then he looked at some newspapers he found, scrutinising their
folds very carefully. Then he picked up a pair of almost new fur-lined gloves, and held the palms and fingers up to the light,
putting them to his nose and sniffing at them many times.</p>

<p>Finally, after a long moment of hesitation, he went quickly
through the contents of the tool box. "Everything is neat and
tidy about this car, and its owner has a methodical mind," was
his final comment. He shook his head in disapproval. "And now I'm
going to do him a very dirty trick, if he's an honest man."</p>

<p>He bent down and unscrewed the cover of the valve top of one
of the back tyres, and putting it in his pocket, proceeded next
to let out a little of the air.</p>

<p>"Now not too much," he chided himself, "for he mustn't notice
it until he's well away from here."</p>

<p>Then, with another sigh, he took the valve top off the spare
wheel, and pocketed that too. "And now I'll be going," he said,
"and I expect it'll be another long wait before they come
back."</p>

<p>He returned to his former place upon the sandhill and was in
part relieved, and in part uneasy, to see that the fisherman had
gone. Then, settling himself down comfortably into the grass, he
prepared to continue his watch, noting with some satisfaction
that the man under the hedge by the bitumen road was still in the
same position.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw Henrik come out of his hut, and with unsteady
steps, start to make his way in the direction of the stone house.
He was holding a small sack in one hand, a bottle in the other,
and half-way upon his journey, stopped to refresh himself with a
drink.</p>

<p>At length, reaching the house, he staggered up to the front
door and gave it a resounding kick with the evident intention of
attracting the attention of anyone inside.</p>

<p>He waited a few moments and then kicked again, repeating the
operation at intervals, several times. But the door remained
closed, and at last it appeared to dawn upon his fuddled brain
that no one could be at home, and so, with the same staggering
gait, he started to return to his hut.</p>

<p>Passing the open shed, however, the car inside must have
caught his eye, and after a long hesitation and some further
refreshment from the bottle, he lounged up to it and passed
inside. A good five minutes passed, and he was still there.</p>

<p>Then Larose saw the three men returning along the marsh road
and began wondering what would happen when they found Henrik in
their shed.</p>

<p>But just before they came to the back of their house, Henrik
emerged again, and now more staggering than ever, plumped himself
down upon the ground outside.</p>

<p>One of the men did not come round to the front of the house,
but the other two did, and they almost fell over the fisherman as
they came round the corner.</p>

<p>The detective saw their faces plainly, but they were both
quite unknown to him, and much to his disappointment, neither of
them was the square-jawed man, nor, he was sure, the man he had
just seen waiting under the hedge. They were evidently the two
who had been riding the bicycles.</p>

<p>Henrik at once jumped excitedly to his feet, and thrusting his
arm into the sack, produced a large fish. He gesticulated wildly
and was evidently offering it for sale.</p>

<p>A few words passed between the two men, and then one of them
handed something over to Henrik, receiving in exchange the fish
that was then thrust back into the sack. The fisherman was given
a cigarette, and then pushed off unceremoniously towards his hut,
with a half-kick to accelerate his progress.</p>

<p>The two men then went into the shed, but almost immediately
the detective heard the car being started, and in a few seconds
it shot into view and took its way along the marsh road.</p>

<p>Only one man, he saw, had been in it, and the other, now
emerging from the shed, disappeared round the back of the
house.</p>

<p>Larose watched the car through his glasses, and noted that,
upon gaining the bitumen road, it turned off in a direction
exactly opposite to that which had been taken by the
bicycles.</p>

<p>His watch over, and waiting a couple of minutes or so until he
had seen Henrik disappear into his hut, he made his way down the
sandhills, and then stood for a few moments taking in his
bearings.</p>

<p>"I'll come here to-night," he told himself, "and just see what
that third chap is like to look at. There are no curtains to
their windows, and if they show a glimpse of light, I shall be
able to see everything inside." His forehead wrinkled
thoughtfully. "Of course, he was a long way away, but still I'm
half inclined to think that that man under the hedge was not
unlike the square-jawed blackguard who grabbed me that night when
I fired upon their car."</p>

<p>Then in the same roundabout way that he had come he started
upon his journey back to the Abbey.</p>

<p>When about half a mile from the Abbey grounds he perceived
someone walking across the fields in a direction that would
eventually bring them together. He did not recognise who it was,
until they were much closer to each other, and then he saw it was
Sir Parry.</p>

<p>Sir Parry had evidently recognised him, too, and waited by a
stile for him to come up. "Good morning, Mr. Larose," he called
out cheerfully. "A most unexpected pleasure, and I hope you keep
a good lookout to make sure that no one takes a shot at you from
behind. I'm glad I've met you," he went on, "for I've been
waiting to have a little talk with you. Now, are you in a great
hurry?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the detective, by no means averse to the
meeting, "and I'd like to ask you a few questions, too."</p>

<p>Sir Parry looked at his watch. "Nearly half-past twelve," he
said, "and you'll be late for your dinner at the Abbey," he
smiled in a most friendly way&mdash;"so what about coming into my
place and having a refresher and a biscuit?"</p>

<p>"Very nice," replied the detective, "I'm sure I shall be very
pleased to."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Sir Parry, "and I'll give you the
finest of all morning drinks, a goblet of Royal Shandy."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Larose as they started to walk towards
Sir Parry's house. "I've not heard of it in Australia."</p>

<p>"A small bottle of champagne with a hint of the immortal
Guinness," replied Sir Parry with great reverence. "A beverage
that was a favorite with King Edward." He walked briskly forward.
"Come along, young man, it's a great treat to me to indulge in
it, because of my lumbago, and the very thought of it now makes
my mouth water."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>

THE WHITE POWDER</h2>

<p class="first">AS the crow flies, Larose saw that it would not
be much more than half a mile from where he had encountered Sir
Parry to the latter's residence, and mindful of the keen
anticipation expressed by the knight for the forthcoming draught
of Royal Shandy, the detective was a little surprised that he was
not now taking the direct way along a path leading across the
open meadows.</p>

<p>Instead, however, after walking only a very short distance,
Sir Parry turned off at right angles to the path and made for the
opening in a long and curving plantation of small larches, that
extended almost up to his house.</p>

<p>"I think we'll go this way," he remarked cheerily, "for
although it's a little longer, it's such a pretty walk and I
always like, too, to make sure that there are no trespassers
about. This is all Lady Ardane's property and the people round
here are inveterate poachers." He smiled. "You see, I act as a
sort of honorary bailiff for her, and I don't let anyone take any
advantage because she's a woman."</p>

<p>And he certainly appeared to be most zealous in his self-imposed task, for he kept on looking back, almost as if he had
thought some trespasser would be appearing behind, the very
moment that he had passed.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the wood and now barely a hundred yards
from the house, he made yet another slight detour.</p>

<p>"We'll go in the back way, if you don't mind," he said,
"because it's not as muddy as the path by the front door," and
the detective was speedily of opinion that the mud must be very
bad indeed in front of the house, if it were worse than that
through which he was then walking.</p>

<p>Sir Parry let himself in through a door that he unlocked, and
then invited the detective to follow.</p>

<p>"We shall be able to talk quite freely," he remarked, pausing
for a moment before he closed the door, "for the house at this
hour is always empty." He smiled. "I'm a crusty old bachelor, Mr.
Larose, and have developed peculiar ways of my own. For instance,
I have two servants to look after me, but they are only on the
premises during certain hours. They live quite apart by
themselves, in a bungalow I had built for them, a good two
hundred yards away among those trees. They arrive to perform
their duties at 7.30 punctually every morning. They get my
breakfast and attend to the house and then by eleven are away
again and I don't see anything more of them until half-past four,
when they return to prepare my evening meal."</p>

<p>"Very lonely for you, isn't it!" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"But I like it," nodded Sir Parry. "It just suits me. I
partake of nothing, except perhaps a biscuit or two at midday,
and so I am quiet and undisturbed all day, am able to pursue my
studies without interruption." He seemed very pleased with
himself. "I have so trained my servants that they perform all
their duties automatically and I hardly ever speak to them." He
laughed. "And I should certainly have some difficulty in holding
much conversation with them at any time, for one is practically
stone-deaf and the other is a deaf-mute."</p>

<p>As the recipient of so much information touching upon Sir
Parry's domestic arrangements, the detective was beginning to
feel rather bored, and, very thirsty after his long walk, was
wishing his host would proceed quickly to hospitality and produce
the long draught of Royal Shandy that he had promised. So he was
relieved when Sir Parry at last led the way along the passage,
and ushered him into a cosily furnished dining-room.</p>

<p>But there a surprise awaited them both, and with Sir Parry,
from the expression upon his face, no little annoyance was
mingled with the surprise.</p>

<p>A tall, thin woman, well in middle-age, was standing upon a
short step-ladder and putting up some clean curtains to one of
the windows, and she turned a pair of very startled deep black
eyes upon them as they entered the room.</p>

<p>Sir Parry looked most annoyed, and motioned sharply to her to
leave the room, but then apparently perceiving she had nearly
finished the work, and that if she were now sent peremptorily
away, the room would be left uncurtained, with another sharp jerk
of his head he motioned her to continue.</p>

<p>"My housekeeper; and she knows she has no business to be here
at this time," he explained to the detective, "but she is a woman
of low intelligence, and I suppose, seeing me go out, she thought
regulations were made to be broken."</p>

<p>The detective was regarding the woman interestedly, and was
certainly not agreeing with Sir Parry that she was of low
intelligence. On the contrary, he told himself, she had quite a
thoughtful, if a very sad, face. She seemed desperately afraid of
her master and was trembling, he noted, as she went on with her
work.</p>

<p>Sir Parry, however, had quickly recovered his good humor. "We
can talk quite unreservedly before her," he said, "for I don't
think she'd hear a gun fired, if it went off right by her very
ears, and it's her deafness that so adds to her stupidity."</p>

<p>"Has she always been deaf?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"No, it came on six or seven years ago," replied Sir Parry. "I
had the local doctor to her, but he said nothing could be done.
However, she wasn't satisfied and wanted to go to some quack in
Norwich and spend thirty or forty pounds." He looked very
scornful. "But I put down my foot on that right away and
absolutely forbade it."</p>

<p>He moved over to the sideboard, and his whole tone of voice
altered. "But now I'll show you something," he said with great
pride, bringing out two beautiful, old-fashioned silver goblets.
"Look at these, the Cherubim and the Seraphim, and, as you are
the guest, you shall drink out of the Seraphim, who, in Jewish
lore, as I expect you are aware, was of the highest angelic
order. These goblets are very old and have been in the possession
of my family for many generations. In fact, you know"&mdash;and
he dropped his voice into a whisper&mdash;"I shouldn't wonder if
they were not once used as chalices, and stolen from some
monastery at the time of Henry VIII. A few years back a dealer
offered me four hundred guineas for them." He laughed as if very
amused. "And fancy! a detective from Scotland Yard going to drink
champagne out of one of them! Here, look at it closely."</p>

<p>The detective took the goblet he held out. It was beautifully
chased, and below the figure of an angel was engraved in quaint
old English characters, "Ye guardian of ye threshold."</p>

<p>Sir Parry seemed as happy as a child. "Now you go and rest in
that armchair," he said, "for you must be tired after your walk,
and you can amuse yourself with this morning's paper. I don't
suppose you have seen it. And I'll go and get the ingredients for
this royal beverage."</p>

<p>He bustled quickly from the room and the woman, having
finished putting up the curtains, came down off the steps. In so
doing, however, she knocked over a little box of curtain rings
and miscellaneous odds and ends and scattered them all upon the
floor. The detective immediately rose from his chair and, moving
over to her side, helped her to gather them together again. She
flushed uncomfortably, and then, with everything replaced, gave
him a shy and grateful look as she hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Sir Parry returned very soon with the stout and champagne.
"No, don't you get up yet," he said with an assumption of stern
authority. "The mixing of this shandy is almost a ritual, and
must be done in most exact proportions to bring out the exquisite
favor. So you just read on for a minute or two, and I'll tell you
when I'm ready."</p>

<p>But then just as he was about to pull the cork of the bottle
of stout the telephone began to tinkle loudly in some distant
part of the house, and he made a gesture of intense
annoyance.</p>

<p>"I must go," he said ruefully, "for I expect it is my doctor
in Norwich, and if I don't answer it he may not trouble to ring
again." He shook his head. "He's a big man and very offhand!"</p>

<p>And then, as if flurried at being interrupted in the middle of
preparing the kingly beverage, he popped both the goblets quickly
back into the sideboard and shut the door upon them again.</p>

<p>"I shan't be two minutes," he called out as he hurried from
the room, "and you go on reading your paper."</p>

<p>The detective heard him running up the passage, and then his
voice, quite a long way away, speaking into the phone. But he had
hardly uttered two words before his housekeeper glided into the
room and made straight for the sideboard.</p>

<p>Opening the door, she quickly abstracted the two goblets.</p>

<p>"The master is very absent-minded," she explained with a smile
back at Larose. "These goblets want dusting inside."</p>

<p>The detective had glanced up upon her entrance, and his eyes
continued to remain fixed upon her, until she had left the room.
Seemingly, he was interested in her.</p>

<p>And certainly he would have been more interested still, if he
had been a spectator of what she was doing half a minute later
for, with all appearance of frenzied hurry, she was putting a
heaped-up teaspoonful of white powder, which she had just taken
from a small box in a drawer, into the goblet of the Seraphim
from which he was so shortly to imbibe the draught of Royal
Shandy.</p>

<p>She was back in the dining-room, and replacing the goblets and
re-closing the sideboard door, had glided away again before Sir
Parry had finished his conversation upon the phone.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to have kept you," apologised the latter when
at last he returned, "but I had to take in all the instructions
he gave me. It was my doctor, and I was getting advice about my
lumbago."</p>

<p>He bustled back to the sideboard. "Now, where was I? Let me
think! Ah! I remember, I was just going to open the stout."</p>

<p>With a frown, most probably at his absent-mindedness for
having replaced the goblets in the sideboard, he took them out
again, and with great care poured in the stout and champagne, in
equal proportions.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," he said, "a biscuit and we're set."</p>

<p>He handed over to the detective the brimming goblet of the
Seraphim, and went on fussily, "A big draught, if you please,
sir, for that's the only way to drink champagne." He raised one
finger solemnly. "No sipping ever at a sparkling wine."</p>

<p>They raised the goblets to each other. "Well, here's luck,"
said Larose, "and to the memory of a great king," and, after a
deep breath of pleasurable anticipation, he took a long and
steady draught from the goblet of the guardian of the
threshold.</p>

<p>They put down their goblets together exactly at the same
moment. "Like it?" said Sir Parry, beaming over with good
nature.</p>

<p>"'Too right,' as we say in Australia," replied Larose, "too
right I do." He moved his tongue about and swallowed several
times. "But it has a slight saline taste, I think."</p>

<p>Sir Parry moved his tongue about too, and then nodded, "Yes, I
think it has&mdash;but very slight. It's probably the stout."</p>

<p>The goblets were filled again and the shandy drunk to its last
drop.</p>

<p>"Now there's only one thing about this drink," said Sir Parry
meditatively, "and that is it makes you very sleepy. I always
begin to feel drowsy after it, in a very few minutes, and then
want to lie down and have forty winks."</p>

<p>"Well, it hasn't made me feel drowsy," smiled Larose, "at any
rate yet."</p>

<p>"Talking about doctors," went on Sir Parry meditatively, "as a
profession, I think they are very wonderful," he screwed up his
eyes&mdash;"but there are a lot of duds among them, and they make
great mistakes sometimes. Now, take my own case, for instance.
For years and years I suffered from obscure internal pains, and
doctor after doctor averred that stones were forming in various
parts of my poor body, and held over me the threat of most
unpleasant operations later on to cut them out." His face assumed
a reverential look. "Then, just by chance, I lighted upon a great
master in the calling, and in 2 minutes he had swept aside all
ideas of operations and X-rays and just said that from time to
time crystals were formed in my body, oxalate crystals, he called
them, and it was these that gave me all the pains." He smiled.
"As for treatment&mdash;it was nothing. Only a little simple
matter of diet. I gave up all milk, tea, cocoa, spinach and a few
other things and&mdash;I was cured in a few days. Wonderful,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He ambled on and on, quite content to do all the talking and
showing no sign of coming to the point and explaining why he had
wanted to have a talk with Larose, but the latter noted that many
times he half-paused in his remarks to give him a very intent
look.</p>

<p>At last the detective, who realised all his time was being
wasted, broke in upon one of Sir Parry's discursions into
philosophy.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said most politely, "but I must be going soon
and I want to ask you a few questions." He went straight to the
point. "Now can you vouch for the character of young
Huntington?"</p>

<p>Sir Parry spoke most decisively. "Most certainly I can," he
replied. "I've known him since he was 14 and he's one of the best
and most trusted officers who have ever been employed upon my
boats."</p>

<p>"But he was not speaking the truth," said Larose sternly,
"when he made out his acquaintance with Mr. Daller dated only
from the night they both arrived at the Abbey."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Sir Parry warmly, "I believe
implicitly that he had not met Mr. Daller before." He looked very
stern. "Apart from his saying so"&mdash;and he now picked his
words very carefully&mdash;"I am sure Mr. Daller is not of the
type of man he would be having any friendship with." He spoke
most emphatically. "I do not like Bernard Daller, Mr.
Larose."</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo!" thought the detective, "now perhaps I'm going
to learn something at last."</p>

<p>"But why don't you like him?" he asked at once. "He seems to
be very devoted to Lady Ardane."</p>

<p>"And perhaps that's one reason," smiled Sir Parry, "for I am
quite aware that he would propose to Lady Ardane at once, if she
gave him the slightest encouragement. Happily, however, her
ladyship has more sense."</p>

<p>"But what have you got against him!" persisted the
detective.</p>

<p>"Nothing really particular," was the reply. "Just instinct. I
don't like him, that's all."</p>

<p>"But have you any suspicions about him in relation to this
kidnapping?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"It's no good pressing me," remonstrated Sir Parry, "for I
have nothing to tell you. If I knew anything you would have heard
it long ago." He nodded testily. "Yes, I have suspicions about
him, but then I have suspicions about others too." He spoke very
solemnly. "I have suspicions, sir, that are so monstrous and
unbelievable that in entertaining them I sometimes think I must
be going out of my mind." Tears welled up in his eyes. "But
unsupported suspicions help no one. We can do nothing, and that
poor woman there is suffering all the time."</p>

<p>He refused to discuss the matter any further, and to all the
enquiries of the detective just answered curtly, "No."</p>

<p>The conversation languished and died down, and then Sir Parry
put up his hand to suppress a yawn.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel sleepy too?" he asked in a very tired tone of
voice.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head, and taking the yawn as a hint, rose up
to go, but Sir Parry was at once all protests.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said "surely you're not going yet? Why, I haven't
shown you my telescopes! We'll go up to my observatory at
once."</p>

<p>The detective was not particularly keen, and half inclined to
refuse, but a couple of minutes or so later, up in the big
observatory, he was very glad that he had not, for, taking
advantage of the moment when Sir Parry was adjusting a blind at
the far end of the room, he glued his eye to a telescope that he
saw on a tripod, and sweeping it round, got something of a
shock.</p>

<p>Every yard of the way he had traversed that morning could be
followed foot by foot, and not only that, but the very patch of
grass in which he had been lying as he watched the stone house,
stood out as clearly as if it were in the garden just below.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he muttered, and he took his eyes from the telescope to
find Sir Parry close behind him, and for some reason not looking
too pleased.</p>

<p>The detective suppressed all signs of the uneasiness that he
was feeling, and remarked enthusiastically, "By Jove! but this is
a beautiful telescope. How plainly old Henrik's hut comes
up!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sir Parry, still with a half frown, "and I
don't know what's come over him lately. He always seems to be
rolling about dead drunk, as if he had discovered treasure
somewhere, and were spending it on rum."</p>

<p>"Do you look through this little telescope often!" asked
Larose, with a backward glance at the very big one in the middle
of the room, and then he would have sworn that Sir Parry was
about to answer "No."</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es," however, admitted the knight hesitatingly, and
then his face brightened suddenly and he gave a sly smile. "I
quite understand why you ask me, for naturally you are wondering
if I saw you this morning." He nodded. "Well I did. You were
watching that stone house there and saw the motor car drive
away." He lowered his voice mysteriously. "Now may I ask if you
have any suspicions about anybody there?"</p>

<p>The detective realised instantly that any prevarication would
be quite useless, for Sir Parry was certainly not simple enough
to believe that he, Larose, had been watching there with no
purpose in view.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know whether there are suspicions," he replied
slowly, "but I certainly want to know something about these men,
if only because they were newcomers to the neighborhood just
before all this trouble started."</p>

<p>"And what did you find out?" asked Sir Parry, very
interested.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the detective stoutly, "except that they've
got a very nice car."</p>

<p>Sir Parry stared intently at Larose and then yawned again,
but, as before the yawn did not seem to be infectious, for the
detective was looking uncommonly bright and alert. Then,
apparently after a few moments of very hard thinking, Sir Parry
frowned.</p>

<p>"I think," he said reproachfully "that it would have paid you
better to have taken me a little more into your confidence." He
pointed across the marshes. "Now I could have told you a lot
about those men, for I pick them up often in the telescope." He
paused to marshal his facts. "There are three of them, and they
go out very little and then only to fish. They have no visitors
and I have never seen them speak to anyone except Henrik. They
get their provisions once a week, they go to bed early, and they
get up late." He smiled. "A little mysterious, for Heaven only
knows how they can put in their time."</p>

<p>"They go to bed early," commented Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, their light goes out about nine o'clock. Ah!" and Sir
Parry made a low whistle. "Now if you want to get a close-up view
of them, without their knowing anything about it, then night's
the time, for they don't appear to possess any blinds. You could
creep close up to the house and look through that one window at
the side. That's the room where they always are."</p>

<p>He mentioned to Larose to pick up the telescope again. "Now,
I'll tell you the best way to go. Keep on the bitumen until you
are two hedges beyond where the marsh road turns off. Then make
your way direct across the field, hugging the hedge close upon
your right. When you get almost up to the end of the hedge you'll
see a stile, but don't get over that. Instead, creep through a
hole in the hedge that you'll see close by and you'll come out
within 20 yards of the house."</p>

<p>He repeated his instructions and Larose took them in
carefully. Then putting the whole matter of the kidnapping out of
his mind, for nearly an hour Sir Parry explained the wonderful
mechanism of his big telescope.</p>

<p>Time after time the detective said he really could not stay
any longer, but always Sir Parry found something to delay his
departure.</p>

<p>At last Larose started to walk down the stairs upon his own
accord, and his host was then obliged to follow.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry you must go, Mr. Larose," he said, "for you're
most agreeable company. I always heard that you were a remarkable
man and now I quite agree."</p>

<p>He let the detective out of the door, and then stood
thoughtfully watching him as he made his way down the path.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're certainly a remarkable man," he repeated with a
very puzzled frown as he at length closed the door and turned
back into the house, "indeed, so remarkable that I don't
understand you at all."</p>

<p>And Larose, as well, was full of puzzled thoughts. "What's
bitten you, Gilbert?" he asked, looking very annoyed. "You're
nervy. Do you think somebody's been walking over your grave?" He
shook his head. "I ought never to have been given the shandy out
of that Seraphim. That's it, for I've had a ghost looking over my
shoulder every since."</p>

<p>The detective had told Sir Parry that he should be walking
back to the Abbey through the wood, but directly he was out of
sight of the house he doubled back and made off in exactly the
opposite direction. He wanted to have a look at the bungalow
where Sir Parry's servants lived.</p>

<p>Coming out of the wood he saw the bungalow right before him.
Its situation was certainly very lonely and secluded, for the
wood was upon three sides of it, and even upon the fourth side it
had only about a hundred yards of open space before another wood
closed it in.</p>

<p>In front of it was a small garden, trim and beautifully kept,
and as the detective approached, he saw the housekeeper busy by
the little fence, pruning a rose tree. The woman, however, did
not catch sight of him until he was almost up to the gate, and
then she looked the very picture of consternation and
surprise.</p>

<p>But Larose, with a reassuring smile, doffed his cap and then
made signs asking for permission to open the gate. The woman ran
to do it for him and then he pointed to the door of the house,
making her understand that he wanted to go in. Here the
permission did not seem to be so readily accorded, but the
detective mouthing the words 'want to speak to you,' after a
moment's hesitation, the woman led the way into the bungalow and
then into a small room which was obviously the sitting-room.</p>

<p>She pointed to a chair, and Larose pointing to another, they
both sat down, with the width of a small table between them. Then
the detective took a note-book and a pencil out of his pocket,
and tearing out a leaf from the book, wrote on it, "I just want
to ask you one or two simple questions."</p>

<p>He passed the paper across to her, and after glancing down
upon it, she looked up and nodded. She seemed, however, rather
frightened as she passed it back.</p>

<p>Then Larose wrote, "Now, please do exactly as I tell you," and
after reading it, she looked more frightened still.</p>

<p>Then Larose again penciled a few words&mdash;this time: "Look
me straight in the face, please, and keep your eyes fixed on
mine."</p>

<p>The woman now seemed terrified, but she did as he commanded,
and he rewarded her with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>He waited perhaps five seconds, and then putting the pencil
and paper back in his pocket, said in his ordinary tone of voice,
"You are not deaf at all. You can hear quite well what I am
saying."</p>

<p>The woman became pale as death, her jaw dropped, and her eyes
opened widely. She clutched at the table with both hands and
began to breathe quickly.</p>

<p>"Now don't distress yourself," said Larose kindly, "for it's
your secret and I have no intention of giving you away. I'm a
detective, it's true, but I'm not after you, and if you choose to
serve a very eccentric master as a deaf woman," he shrugged his
shoulders, "well, it's nothing to do with me, and I'm certainly
not going to interfere."</p>

<p>The woman made no attempt at any denial. "Then what do you
come here for?" she asked hoarsely and in a very deep voice.</p>

<p>Larose smiled a most reassuring smile. "I was just interested,
that's all," he replied. "I wanted to make sure that my
conjecture was right. I saw you flush when Sir Parry said you
were of low intelligence, and when you were putting those goblets
back in the sideboard you knocked them together and then you
hesitated a couple of seconds or so, as if to learn if the
tinkling had reached your master." He laughed lightly. "It looked
to me as if you knew you were doing something which would
displease him."</p>

<p>The woman had in a great measure recovered her composure, and
now the expression upon her face was one of resentment rather
than fear.</p>

<p>"The master loses his temper very quickly," she said, "and he
had no business to call me 'low.' My father was a minister and my
mother taught in a school, and if I am a servant I'm not 'low.'"
She began to cry. "I've had a lot of trouble in my life and a lot
of misfortune, and now if the master gets to know that I have
been deceiving him about my deafness, he'll send me away and I've
nowhere to go. I have no friends at all." Tears trickled down her
cheeks. "He can be very hard sometimes."</p>

<p>Larose, touched by her distress, leant across the table and
patted one of her hands.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," he said gently, "I'll not tell
anyone." He spoke as sympathetically as he could. "Really, I am
very sorry that, just to gratify my vanity, I've made you tell me
your secret." He rose up from his chair. "Now, I'll go off and
you can forget that I've been here."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried quickly, and she begun at once to dry her
tears. "You, mustn't go like that. You are being very kind to me
and I'm not accustomed to any kindness." She choked, back a sob.
"I live a very lonely life and I always seem to have been
unhappy." Her face brightened and she began to smooth down her
hair. "But now you'll stop and have a cup of tea. The kettle's
just boiling. You'll stop, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Larose. "I'd like a cup very much."</p>

<p>And then over tea and bread and butter he heard the story of a
truly unhappy life.</p>

<p>She was a widow, Kate Dilling by name, fifty years of age, and
had lost her husband after only one year of married life. She had
had one child, a little boy, and he had been burnt to death by
the upsetting of a lamp, before her very eyes. For fifteen years
she had been Sir Parry's housekeeper, and at first he had been
very kind to her, but the last few years he had been becoming
more and more eccentric, and lately, especially, he had altered a
lot. He was very morbid now. Eight years ago she had begun to
grow very deaf, and she knew Sir Parry had been glad about it,
for he had developed the habit of muttering a lot to himself, and
he did it out loud, and was quite aware of his failing.</p>

<p>The local doctor had said he could do nothing for her
deafness, but unknown to Sir Parry and very much against his
wish, she had been treated by a Norwich herbalist, and now was
quite cured. She dared not tell Sir Parry, however, for she was
sure he would send her away at once if he knew. She had to keep
up the pretence to everyone that she was stone deaf and had no
friends in consequence, and never went out anywhere. Her only
companion was a deaf-mute girl of seventeen, and no one ever came
near them, not even Sir Parry. He had not visited the bungalow
for years and years.</p>

<p>"What a lonely life!" exclaimed Larose when at last she had
finished. "I only wonder how you can put up with it."</p>

<p>"But I have my flowers and my canaries," she said&mdash;she
smiled&mdash;"and I play patience every evening." A peculiar look
came all at once into her face and she regarded the detective
with suddenly troubled eyes. "I know a lot about cards," she went
on quickly, "and I'll tell your fortune for you if you like," and
without waiting for any acquiescence she rose up to get a
pack.</p>

<p>The detective smiled indulgently. He wanted to go away, but he
felt really sorry for the woman and realised what a relief it was
to her to talk to someone.</p>

<p>"Now, don't interrupt, please, whatever you do," she said as
she resumed her seat, "or you will break the train of my thoughts
and spoil everything. Keep quite silent and just watch."</p>

<p>She shuffled the cards well and spread them before her upon
the table. Then, in accordance with a ritual of followers of her
craft, in dead silence and with frowning brows, she began picking
them out, and continually changing their positions. Her face
became the more and more troubled as each minute passed.</p>

<p>At last she spoke. "You are under a dark cloud," she said
slowly and with her eyes still intent upon the cards, "and a
great danger threatens. You have recently been in great danger,
too&mdash;so never again go where you have been to-day, for I see
evil there. You are too sure of yourself, and you do not
understand the forces that are up against you. I see
blood"&mdash;she spoke with an effort&mdash;"and someone is going
to die. The ace of spades is continually falling into the line."
She shook her head. "You are being deceived somewhere. So trust
no one, for the seemingly most harmless man may be your greatest
enemy. In particular, beware of a young man with a sunny
smile."</p>

<p>She spoke now in a hoarse whisper. "But never, never go where
you have been to-day, for you have been standing over an open
grave"&mdash;her voice trailed away to nothing&mdash;"and the
grave was yours."</p>

<p>With a quick movement, she gathered up the cards and flung
them back into a drawer. Her face was very pale and she was
trembling.</p>

<p>The detective was looking amused, but all the same he felt a
little bit uncomfortable. He prided himself that he was not in
the least bit superstitious, but she had been twanging upon the
self-same chords that not an hour ago had been vibrating so
violently in him.</p>

<p>"Then I'm not to go anywhere where I've been to-day," he said
banteringly. "Well, that's certainly rather rough upon your
master, for I've been a solid three hours with him"&mdash;he
thought agreeably of the royal shandy&mdash;"and he opened a
bottle of champagne for me."</p>

<p>"But he's not very pleased with you, Mr. Larose," she said
quickly, "for he doesn't like her ladyship being so friendly with
you!"</p>

<p>"Friendly!" ejaculated Larose. "Why, I'm only there as a
detective from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>The woman smiled. "But her ladyship told him you were the
bravest man she had ever known, and that it was a fortunate day
for her when she met you."</p>

<p>Larose felt the blood surging riotously through his veins, and
for one moment the memory of that red head upon his shoulder was
blotting out consideration of all else. But then, very quickly,
that moment passed, and, with his face set hard, he was the cold
and calculating detective again.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said sternly, "you know too much about me, I'm
thinking, and there was something behind all that jargon over the
cards just now." He moved up close to her and spoke very slowly.
"Now for one thing, Mrs. Dilling, how did you come to know that
my name was Larose? Your master never mentioned it when you were
in the room this morning."</p>

<p>She looked rather frightened, but nevertheless answered
readily enough.</p>

<p>"I've told you the master is continually talking to himself,"
she replied, "and he's mentioned your name several times, as the
detective from Scotland Yard, at the Abbey. Then yesterday I had
to have tea ready for Senator Harvey, who was coming over in the
afternoon, and be there to wait upon them, and they spoke a lot
about you."</p>

<p>"What did they say about me?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"I didn't catch it all," was the reply, "because I was in and
out of the room, but they both agreed you might have done
something that had happened&mdash;to excite sympathy."</p>

<p>The detective gulped down his rage. "Did you hear someone had
tried to shoot me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She looked shocked. "No-o, I never heard that."</p>

<p>"Well, someone did," went on Larose, "and it is a near thing
I'm not in that grave you talked about just now." He eyed her
intently. "Now, does the Senator often come up to see Sir
Parry?"</p>

<p>"Not when I'm about," she replied. "I've never seen him there
before." She seemed suddenly to remember something and laid her
hand upon his arm. "But Senator Harvey was out in these woods
last night and met someone just at the corner here."</p>

<p>"Here!" ejaculated Larose. "Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything," said the woman, "except that I woke
up at half-past twelve and saw him in the moonlight, coming out
of the wood. He stood still for about a minute, just in front of
this bungalow and I saw his face plainly. Then another man came
out of the wood from the other direction and they talked together
for a very little while, and then they both went off again."</p>

<p>"Together?" snapped Larose.</p>

<p>"No, not together. They both went back into the wood where
they had come out."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then the detective asked, "You
know why I am here!"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, to see no one gets the child. Some men have
tried to take him to get a ransom."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" came the question as quick as lightning. "Who
told you, if you never speak to anyone?"</p>

<p>"Two of the girls from the Abbey," was the instant reply,
"Miriam and Gladys. They are housemaids there. They were out for
a walk one afternoon about three weeks ago and stopped to admire
my roses and I invited them in for a cup of tea. Everyone knows I
am supposed to be deaf and so they wrote it down on a piece of
paper for me, and I learnt a lot besides, from their talking in
between, when they were deciding what to write down." She added,
after a moment, for the detective had made no comment, "and the
master talked a lot about it, too." She shook her head slowly.
"It's very sad about the master, and it all comes from living so
much alone. When he's upset about anything, he talks on and on to
himself, as if he were arguing with someone who is in the
room."</p>

<p>"But what does it matter to him," asked the detective gruffly,
"whether her ladyship speaks well of me, or not?"</p>

<p>The woman smiled a slow, meaning smile. "The older the man,
Mr. Larose," she said, "the bigger the fool, and the master's
always hoping to marry Lady Ardane himself. I know that that's on
his mind."</p>

<p>"Has he ever asked her?" scoffed Larose.</p>

<p>She made a gesture of ignorance. "I shouldn't think so," she
replied, "for he's very cautious and makes sure of everything
before he acts." Her face suddenly assumed a very anxious
expression. "But they won't get the child, will they, now you are
here, and they won't be able to injure you now you are on your
guard."</p>

<p>"I don't know so much about that," replied Larose gruffly,
"and I'm not sure that I'm too easy in my mind, now that you've
read all about me in the cards." He eyed her again very sternly
and raised his voice suddenly. "Now, no nonsense, you know
something. Yes, you do, and you've been trying to warn me in a
roundabout way." He stretched out and gripped her by the arm.
"Come on. Tell me at once, I intend to know."</p>

<p>She burst instantly again into tears. "I don't know anything,"
she said, "and you are being very unkind. You are making a great
mistake, and I only imagine things. That's all. This lonely life
is unnatural to me, too, and I'm all nerves."</p>

<p>Then seeing from the expression on his face that he did not
believe her, she suddenly checked her sobs and all at once
becoming calm, faced him in a resolute and defiant manner. "Well,
you shall know my secret," she cried, "if you will drag it from
me." She hesitated a moment. "I am unbalanced and not an ordinary
woman, for ten years I was in an asylum for the insane."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," said the detective instantly. "You are
telling me a lie."</p>

<p>"I am not," she replied passionately. "It is quite true."</p>

<p>"What asylum were you in then?" he asked quickly. "Now don't
stop to think."</p>

<p>"In the one at Norwich," she replied.</p>

<p>"And the name of the superintendent? Now, no hesitation. You
must remember."</p>

<p>"Dr. Alfred Turner," she said instantly.</p>

<p>The detective let go her arm. "And what made you go out of
your mind?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The death of my child. I was a melancholic case and fed
through a tube they used to put into my nose."</p>

<p>The detective cross-examined her sharply, but it was soon
evident to him that she had been an inmate of an asylum, for she
described most graphically the varying kinds of treatments that
had been given to the other patients in a manner that left no
doubt in his mind that she was speaking the truth there. He asked
her a lot of questions, but he could not trip her up in any way.
He left her at last upon quite friendly terms, but he could not
shake off the conviction that she had been upon the verge of
telling him something, and had only refrained from doing so
because she was afraid of the consequences, if she had done
so.</p>

<p>He walked back through the wood in a very thoughtful frame of
mind, and then, instead of going direct to the Abbey, proceeded
into Burnham Market and in the little post office there put
through a trunk call to Norwich.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the Norwich police was soon at the other
end of the phone and seemed very amused when he learned who was
speaking.</p>

<p>"You're a sly dog, aren't you," he chuckled. "On a holiday,
you said you were, and now it's all over the country that you're
at Carmel Abbey upon the very job that you pretended so
innocently you had heard nothing about. Never mind. What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>Larose told him. He wanted an enquiry made at once at the
Norwich Asylum, regarding a woman, Kate Dilling. She was supposed
to have been a patient there for ten years, when a Dr. Alfred
Turner was the medical officer, and he wanted to know all about
her.</p>

<p>"And I'll ring up again," he said, "in about an hour. You
ought to have managed it by then."</p>

<p>He returned to the Abbey straight away, and, interviewing the
two maids, Miriam and Gladys, learnt that everything had happened
as Sir Parry's housekeeper had said.</p>

<p>They had had tea with her, and they had written down
everything exactly as she had said, and that was all the
information they could furnish about her.</p>

<p>Then Larose rang up the Norwich superintendent again and
learnt that the latter had obtained all the information
required.</p>

<p>A Kate Dilling had been in the asylum for ten years and two
months, leaving just fifteen years ago. But she had not been a
patient there. She had been one of the attendant nurses, and had
left with a record of very efficient service behind her to go and
live with a relation of hers. Dr. Alfred Turner was now dead, but
the secretary of the institution, who remembered her quite well,
stated that she had always been esteemed as a conscientious and
trustworthy woman.</p>

<p>"But she can tell lies when she wants to, for all that,"
muttered the detective as he hung up the receiver, "and I think
to-morrow I'll go and have another little talk with her. She was
certainly friendly towards me, but she's hiding something. Yes,
she's hiding something, for sure."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>

IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">LAROSE was very troubled, as, late that
afternoon, he sat alone in his room and gave himself up to his
thoughts.</p>

<p>He was intending to make his way to the house upon the marsh
as soon as darkness fell, and determine once and for all if the
man who had been crouching under the hedge that morning were
indeed the same one who had come up behind him that night when he
had fired upon the pursuing car.</p>

<p>And now in the interval of waiting, he was trying to sum up
exactly what his position was, and if he had really made any
progress at all, and discovered anything since he had arrived at
the Abbey three days ago.</p>

<p>His eyebrows puckered in perplexity. He had so many tangled
skeins to unravel, and in whichsoever direction his thoughts
travelled, they were soon, so very soon, brought up against a
dead wall.</p>

<p>He had been all along so sure, as he had put it almost
brutally to Lady Ardane, that her arch enemy must be among those
five people who had been her close intimates at the time of the
attempt to kidnap her little boy.</p>

<p>Yes, he had been so sure of that, even before he had come to
the Abbey, and nothing he had found out since had shaken him in
that idea.</p>

<p>One by one, he now went over the possible five men again, and
he frowned and shook his head many times.</p>

<p>He had nothing really definite against any of them.</p>

<p>There were certainly some things that he did not like about
Sir Parry Bardell, but it was inconceivable that a man who was as
devoted to Lady Ardane, as undoubtedly the knight was, whatever
might be his motive, would hire desperadoes to go shooting at her
car and expose her to all the risks of a terrible accident.</p>

<p>Still, he was suspicious about Sir Parry, for, in the light of
what the woman Dilling had told him, he could not help thinking
that there was some motive behind the invitation to partake of
the royal shandy that morning. Of course, Sir Parry had seen him
through the telescope as he, Larose, was coming over the marshes,
and he had gone purposely to intercept him at that stile.</p>

<p>Then he had brought him up to his house in a very secretive
sort of way and had kept on looking back as if he were desirous
of ascertaining if anyone were seeing them together. They had
come in by the back door, too, because the path by the front door
was muddy. And yet the mud by the back door was as bad as any he
had been in that morning, with all his long walk. Yes, Sir
Parry's conduct had been very peculiar.</p>

<p>Then the matter of the 'stone-deaf' housekeeper came in, and
there was undoubtedly something very funny there. She did not
seem a bad lot, and he rather thought she was of the kind to be
trusted. She was certainly friendly disposed towards him, and had
been giving him a warning right enough. Then when he had pressed
her for an explanation, she had become frightened, and made up
that clever lie about the asylum to save herself. Well, he would
go and see her again to-morrow. She had asked him to come and see
her again, and that looked as if she were wavering and half-inclined to unburden herself of some secret that she held.</p>

<p>Then next there was Senator Harvey&mdash;and somehow he did
not like the man. But it was inconceivable again there, that the
Senator would conspire against Lady Ardane. Still, some mania
might have seized him and he could not be overlooked, for there
was the matter of his having been out in the wood at night to be
explained, and his meeting with the other man. There was no doubt
the housekeeper had been speaking the truth there.</p>

<p>Then what about Admiral Charters? Certainly he was not of the
type of man to be a conspirator, and yet&mdash;under that hearty
and buff exterior might lurk a man of very evil mind. In the
annals of dark crime there were records beyond number of
deceiving appearances such as that.</p>

<p>It was all very puzzling.</p>

<p>Ah! but he was forgetting Sir Arnold Medway and Lord Wonnock,
and leaving them out of his calculations altogether! Now, could
he be making a mistake about them? Was it conceivable that Sir
Arnold could be associated with a gang of desperadoes? He, a man
of seemingly unimpeachable character, and a most distinguished
member of a great profession.</p>

<p>Impossible! Impossible!&mdash;but yet, again, history had
recorded many such instances.</p>

<p>Then there was Lord Wonnock! Lord Wonnock, stodgy,
unimaginative, a worshipper of tradition, and whose whole
obsession, it seemed, was to so live his life so that it would
add dignity and prestige to the ruling classes!</p>

<p>No, Lord Wonnock was certainly impossible.</p>

<p>But dusk had passed and the darkness of the night was falling
upon the countryside.</p>

<p>The detective let himself out of the cloister door, pausing,
however, as he always did, to take a frowning glance at those
well-oiled hinges.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, fine and clear, and the moon had not yet
risen.</p>

<p>Larose had made some little alteration in his appearance, and,
an adept in disguise, he flattered himself it would take more
than a cursory look from any of those he had been brought in
contact with since his arrival at the Abbey, for them to
determine who he was, from a chance encounter under artificial
light.</p>

<p>But if he could help it, he did not intend to be seen by
anybody, although he was not coming back, he told himself,
without having passed the 'once over' upon the inmates of the
stone house. If he could not get sight of them through any of the
windows, then he was going to knock boldly at the door and make
out that he had lost his way.</p>

<p>He was sure it would be quite safe, for if they were indeed
members of the gang, and being warned about him, had been given a
description of his appearance, they would never recognise in the
moustached and heavily-eyebrowed visitor, the clean-shaven and
well-trimmed detective of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He crossed diagonally to the low fence and climbed over it,
then making sure he was not being followed, he took the bitumen
for about a mile until he was well beyond the marsh road. Then he
turned off across the meadows, and keeping all the time close to
the hedge side, after a rather muddy walk saw the outlines of the
stone house close at hand, silhouetted against the sky.</p>

<p>Making a detour, the back of the house came into view, and he
saw lights shining out of both the windows, and, rather to his
astonishment, a large beam of light also from the door, which was
half-open.</p>

<p>He crept up to within twenty yards, with only a tall hedge now
separating him from the little garden, and then, the door opening
wider, he saw two men standing just within the threshold. They
were talking earnestly together.</p>

<p>Then one of them came out, and the light falling upon his
face, the detective gave a gasp of amazement as he saw the man
was Sir Arnold Medway.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt about it. Sir Arnold had got
his overcoat well buttoned up and his cap was pulled down well
upon his eyes, but there was no mistaking that fine profile, the
Grecian nose and the good, firm chin.</p>

<p>But if he had had any doubts they would have at once been
dispelled, for, in the act of his turning away, the cultured
voice of the great surgeon came up clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you forget. I tell you he wants looking
after."</p>

<p>The man in the doorway called back. "All right. We'll keep on
the lookout," and then, continuing to hold the door wide open
until Sir Arnold had passed through the little gate and gained
the marsh road, he closed it and the garden was in darkness
again.</p>

<p>It was difficult for Larose to determine what were his exact
feelings at the moment.</p>

<p>Amazement, disappointment, doubt and fierce rage surged in
quick succession through him.</p>

<p>"If they are only honest men here," he panted, "then the
explanation of his visit will no doubt turn out to be a very
simple one, but if I find out they belong to the gang, then, good
God!"&mdash;he almost choked in his rage&mdash;"I have allowed
myself to be hoodwinked like the silliest little servant girl."
His face puckered up in his distress. "But fancy! Sir Arnold,
about the last man in the world one would have suspected to be
associated with criminals! Fancy! Such a gentleman
and&mdash;&mdash;" But he pulled himself up sharply. "Gilbert,
Gilbert, you're a fool. Get to business and find out the facts
and then abuse anybody you like afterwards."</p>

<p>For a moment he was inclined to follow after Sir Arnold and
demand an explanation straightaway, but he speedily thought
better of it.</p>

<p>"No," he told himself, "I've got to learn about these men, and
now's the chance, when it's any odds they'll be discussing what
Sir Arnold has just been telling them, and won't be on the
lookout for another visitor so soon."</p>

<p>He bent down to push through where the hedge was very thin,
and then, without the slightest warning, received a stunning blow
upon the head from someone who had been in waiting upon the other
side.</p>

<p>With a deep groan he crashed to the ground, and then, before
he lost consciousness altogether, was dimly aware that he
received a second blow, also upon his head.</p>

<p>He remembered nothing more for a long time, and it might have
been hours and hours before his senses began finally to come
back. Then his return to sight and hearing was hastened by the
pain of someone plucking roughly at his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"And his moustache, too," he heard a voice say, "and then
we'll wash his face."</p>

<p>More pain followed, and then he felt water being splashed over
him and, finally, he was rubbed hard with a cloth.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" he heard someone say, "and he's not only that
darned Larose, but he's the farm laborer as well who came up to
us on the road the other night. The devil!" and he felt his face
stung with a contemptuous flick of the wet cloth.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes dully, and far quicker than the two men who
were watching him imagined, acquired a grasp of the
situation.</p>

<p>He was in a low room, lighted by a single paraffin lamp upon a
table, and lying upon a sofa on the other side of the room,
opposite to a small window. There was no blind to the window, but
a newspaper was pinned across it. His ankles were tied tightly
and his arms were pinioned to his sides by a rope that cut
cruelly into his wrists. He felt very sick, and, moistening his
dry lips, he tasted the salt of his own blood. He had a terrible
pain in his head and felt very thirsty. He saw two faces bending
over him.</p>

<p>He shut his eyes and groaned.</p>

<p>"Wake up, wake up," came a soft and bantering, but not unkind,
voice. "Don't you want to talk to us, Mr. Gilbert Larose, farm-laborer employed by Mr. Andrews at Willow Bend?"</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again with an effort, and they fell at once
upon the square-jawed man of his dreams, but he sensed
instinctively that it was not he who had just been speaking.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you're not dead&mdash;yet," came from the soft
voice again, and the detective was in such pain and distress that
a marked interval between the uttering of the last two words
occasioned him no apprehension at all.</p>

<p>"Something to drink, please," he said weakly, looking up at
the man who had spoken, "I'm very thirsty."</p>

<p>"Give him a tot of brandy, Luke," said the man with the soft
voice, turning at once to his companion.</p>

<p>"Waste of spirit!" was the surly comment of the latter, who
made no move to comply with the request.</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said the first speaker peremptorily. "It'll
be his last drink, poor devil, and you hit him darned hard. Here,
pass over the bottle and I'll give it him myself," and in a few
moments the detective was receiving a generous draught of the
fiery spirit.</p>

<p>"Feel better, eh?" asked the donor. "Well now, you can talk or
not, just as you want to. We're not anxious. We know all about
you and there's nothing more we want to find out."</p>

<p>And then, seeing that either he could not, or would not, enter
into any conversation, they moved away and left him alone.
Seating themselves at the table, they then proceed to talk
earnestly in low voices, every word, however, of what they said,
being perfectly audible to the detective.</p>

<p>He learnt very soon, as he had fully expected, that he was
going to be put to death. His captors made no secret of it,
discussing in a most business like way their arrangements for
accomplishing it.</p>

<p>Henrik was out in his boat, laying his nets about a mile off-shore, but the tide was such that he would be back very soon, for
to escape the labor of much hauling, they knew he always returned
upon a flowing tide. Then directly his keel had touched the sand,
according to his invariable custom, he would proceed with all
haste to his hut to get very drunk, and they would then, unknown
to him, borrow his boat.</p>

<p>They would then attach part of a derelict plough, that was
close handy, to their prisoner, and pushing out to sea, drop him
overboard, about a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>It was all going to be very simple.</p>

<p>"And you are lucky, Mr. Larose," smiled the soft-voiced young
man, noting that the detective was taking in what they were
discussing, "that our friend Roy isn't here. He would have cut
your throat as a preliminary, but we are more tender-hearted and
are just going to let you drown." He laughed as if it were a good
joke. "Besides, we want no messes here."</p>

<p>He was quite a pleasant-looking man, this young fellow with
the soft voice, for he had curly hair, a good profile and a
humorous mouth. Indeed, it was only his eyes that were not nice,
and they were hard and steely.</p>

<p>The detective uttered another groan, but this time it was
mental as well as physical, for he had now recognised in this
soft-voiced man, his whispering cross-examiner upon the night
when he had driven from Norwich with Lady Ardane.</p>

<p>Their arrangements completed, the conversation of the two men
died down. The square-jawed man smoked stolidly, but his
companion, evidently of a more restless nature, kept on going
outside every other minute or so, to ascertain if there were any
sign yet of the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Put out the lamp," he said sharply after one of these
excursions. "There's light enough from the fire, and then I can
pull off that paper," and the lamp being extinguished, he
stripped the window bare.</p>

<p>"Not a glimpse of his lantern yet," he said looking through,
"and it may be half an hour before he comes." He cast his eyes
back upon the recumbent form on the sofa. "But we're quite safe
however long he is, for it's notorious that this chap always
works alone."</p>

<p>He walked over and looked down upon the detective. "Vanity, my
friend," he said with his pleasant smile, "has always been your
besetting sin, and now you're paying for it. In all your work
you've always wanted all the credit, and you never would take in
a pal." He shrugged his shoulders. "So now, to-night, the wages
of your sin&mdash;is death."</p>

<p>He was silent for a few moments, with his eyes still fixed
intently upon Larose. "Not going to speak, eh?" he went on.
"Still stubborn!" He nodded. "But you're a brave man, and know
it's no good crying out." He sighed and turned away. "I'm sorry
for you."</p>

<p>And surely the hardest heart would have experienced some
feeling of compassion for the detective then.</p>

<p>He was not a pleasant sight. Muddied and bloodied, glistening
with sweat, and limp as if every bone in his body were broken, he
looked in the very last stages of exhaustion. His face, ghastly
white except where the blood was clotted on his brow, had already
assumed the leaden hues of death, and his breathing was faint and
very shallow.</p>

<p>But his physical distress, so apparent to the eye, was as
nothing to the mental distress that his captors could not see,
indeed, so overwhelming was the depression of his thoughts that
he was almost unmindful of his exhaustion and his pain.</p>

<p>He was in the lowest depths of humiliation, and no remorse
could have been more deep than was his.</p>

<p>He had failed, and failed just as he had been upon the very
point of success, and it was his pride that had been his undoing.
He had known that he was in the midst of enemies, yet he had
taken no precautions, and just allowed himself to be trapped,
like the veriest booby, without striking a blow.</p>

<p>And others would suffer by his folly. That was the bitter
thought.</p>

<p>But it was all over now and in a few short minutes he would be
dead. Never again would he thrill to the trail of the man-hunt,
no more would he triumph over his enemies. Never again would he
see Helen Ardane, never&mdash;</p>

<p>His eyes, wandering to the table, fell upon his little
automatic pistol, which, among other things, had been taken from
his pockets.</p>

<p>Ah! if only a miracle would happen and for five seconds he
could hold that in his hand! For only five seconds and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>But his train of thought was interrupted by a sharp
exclamation from the man who had given him the brandy.</p>

<p>"Hell!" cried the latter, looking out through the window.
"What's that? Someone's lit a fire close near."</p>

<p>The square-jawed man jumped to his feet as quickly as if a
wasp had stung him, and, ranging himself beside his companion,
stared out into the night.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. The reflection of a fire was
coming up from behind a sandhill about three hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>"What the devil is it?" came from the younger man. "It's not a
camp fire. It's much too big for that. Damnation! Whatever it is,
it will bring everyone down here if it goes on for long!"</p>

<p>"We must go and see," snapped the man the other had called
Luke. "One of us'll have to." He jerked his head in the direction
of the sofa. "We don't want unexpected visitors with that here.
You go. I'll stop."</p>

<p>"No, we'll both go," insisted the younger man. "That drunken
fool may have landed by the breakwater and set fire to those
baskets and rubbish underneath, and it'll take two of us to put
it out quickly. Come on. It'll be quite safe. I'll throw this rug
over him and no one will see what's on the sofa, even if they
look in. He won't move. I believe he's gone off again, now."</p>

<p>A rug was snatched up hastily and thrown over the detective
and then the door was opened and they ran out.</p>

<p>But the detective was not unconscious, indeed he was very wide
awake, and galvanised into action by the thought that he was
unguarded, with no clear intention, however, of what he could by
any possibility do to effect his escape, he started to try and
wriggle on to the floor.</p>

<p>But the first movement of his head gave him such exquisite
pain that he did almost sink into unconsciousness again. However,
he pulled himself together with a great effort, and was upon the
point of making another attempt, when he heard the sound as of
the door being opened very quietly and&mdash;his heart stood
still.</p>

<p>Perhaps ten seconds of agonising silence followed and then
things began to happen very quickly.</p>

<p>Through the fibres of the thick rug that was lying over him,
he saw a point of light spring up from somewhere and flit like a
firefly round the room. Then it came waveringly to rest in his
direction, and he heard the pad of footfalls coming close. Then
he felt the rug being lifted, almost reverently, as if the one
who lifted it were afraid of what he might see underneath. Then
he felt the wind of the rug being flung quickly away, and his
eyes were blinded by a fierce light not three inches from
them.</p>

<p>He blinked painfully and a hoarse, rum-laden whisper came from
behind the light.</p>

<p>"Goot! goot!" said the voice, and the detective knew in a
flash that it was Henrik! Then such a thrill of thanksgiving,
beyond all expression in words or prayers surged through him, for
the fisherman in quick deft strokes was striking at his
bonds.</p>

<p>He was lifted to his feet, he tried to stand and then he was
caught, just in the nick of time, as he was falling.</p>

<p>"Broken, broken?" asked the fisherman in a most anxious tone,
and he ran his hands quickly down the detective's legs.</p>

<p>"No," groaned the detective, "I was only hit on the head. I'll
be all right soon." A terrible thought assailed him and his voice
gathered strength. "But help me away quick. They'll be coming
back."</p>

<p>"Right, right," said Henrik, and with a heave of his gaunt
body, he swung the detective onto his shoulder and started to run
from the room.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" cried the detective as they were passing the
table, "get my pistol there."</p>

<p>The fisherman steadied himself under the burden, and then
disengaging one arm, grabbed at the pistol and a small heap of
other things from the table and thrust them into the detective's
pocket. A moment later and they had passed into the night.</p>

<p>The moon had just risen, but it was obscured by misty
clouds.</p>

<p>For a hundred yards and more the fisherman ran quickly, but
then, his breath coming in big gasps, he slowed down to a walk.
For another hundred yards he went on, proceeding all the time in
a direction parallel to the sea. Then he stopped, and, depositing
Larose underneath a high bank of drifted sand, bent down and
peered closely into his face.</p>

<p>"'Orl right?" he said after a very brief inspection, and
pointing to an opening between two sandhills added, "Path."</p>

<p>For a moment, then, he stood listening with his face turned in
the direction of the stone house, but, apparently finding nothing
to occasion any disquietude, without another word, or even a
glance at the detective faded away into the shadows.</p>

<p>Larose lay back and drew in deep breaths of the cold night
air. His head was hurting terribly, and he was distressed beyond
measure that the slightest movement made him giddy, for, now that
he had got back his pistol, the strong urge was possessing him
that he should return instantly and tackle the two men before
they could get away.</p>

<p>That they would bolt now there was no doubt. They knew who he
was and they would be thinking that he would be returning with
help.</p>

<p>But he soon realised that not only was he physically incapable
of any further effort, but mentally, also, at any rate for the
moment, he was not in a condition to pit his wits against anyone.
He could not concentrate or think coherently.</p>

<p>And then in a confused and dull sort of way the dreadful
thought came to him that when his late assailants did make their
flight, then the marsh road would be the very last way to escape
they would take, and in that case it was quite possible they
might chance upon the very path he was now on.</p>

<p>In a perfect fever of apprehension then, he fumbled for his
pistol and tried to slip the safety catch. But his fingers were
quite nerveless and he could not find it, let alone slip it
back.</p>

<p>He pushed the pistol back into his pocket and half walking and
half crawling, proceeded along the path the fisherman had
indicated.</p>

<p>The first few yards were agony, and he thought with every step
that he was going to drop, but in a few minutes he found a
position in which he could hold his head with the minimum amount
of pain, and his progress at once became more speedy, and at
length developed into a slow and dragging walk.</p>

<p>Gradually then his confidence began to come back, and
notwithstanding that his head was throbbing like a piston, he was
soon half-minded to retrace his steps and mete out punishment,
for the injury that had been inflicted upon him.</p>

<p>But he at once discarded the idea when, upon bringing himself
to a halt to consider it, he found that his legs were so wobbly
that he would not be able to use his pistol arm unless he were
lying prone, and so he resumed his journey.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour passed, and having emerged from the
sandhills and now crossing over a meadow, he was just reckoning
that he could not be very far off the bitumen road, when, upon
one of his frequent turnings round to make sure no one was coming
up behind him, he suddenly caught sight of two moving objects
less than a hundred and fifty yards away.</p>

<p>A gasp of incredulity, a mighty leaping of his heart, and he
dropped like a plummet into the long grass at the side of the
path! The moving objects were men upon bicycles!</p>

<p>They were coming from the direction of the sandhills and
crossing along that side of the meadow where there was no path.
As if anxious to escape observation, too, they were keeping as
close to the hedge as a wide ditch would allow them, and from the
course they were taking, the detective saw they would pass within
thirty feet of where he lay.</p>

<p>He felt for his pistol, and this time, although his hands were
shaking, found the safety catch and slipped it back, but a sudden
feeling of faintness reminded him that he must take no liberties,
and he steadied his pistol hand in the crook of his left arm.</p>

<p>Then he strained and strained with his eyes to make out who
the riders were, for if they proved to be the men from the stone
house, he was intending to shoot without warning and, at least,
disable them so that they should not get away. He would aim at
their legs.</p>

<p>They were riding quickly, and it was only a few seconds after
he had thrown himself upon the ground, before they arrived
opposite to him, and he recognised them instantly.</p>

<p>"The devils!" he hissed, and with the first word his automatic
cracked.</p>

<p>The square-jawed man who was the nearer to him, and riding
just in advance of his companion, made a sudden swerve with his
front wheel and then crashed on to the ground, bringing down the
machine and the rider behind him.</p>

<p>There was a loud curse from one of them and then the man who
had only fallen, and was not hurt, sprang up to disengage his
bicycle from the other over which it had toppled.</p>

<p>For the moment the detective waited and did not press again
upon the trigger of his pistol.</p>

<p>He had got them in the open, he told himself, and they could
not get away. He held all the cards.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" he shouted, "or I fire again."</p>

<p>But three seconds later he realised the tragic mistake of
withholding his fire. He had not taken into account the ditch
along which they had been riding, and now the unwounded man,
after making a pretence of throwing up his hands, slipped down
into it, as if he had melted into the ground, and not only that,
but before the half-dazed detective could take in what was
happening, he reached up and dragged his wounded companion and
the two bicycles after him.</p>

<p>For the second time that night, Larose had no word of
condemnation deep enough for himself. He had failed again, and
this time, with all the cards in his hand, had let the game slip
from him.</p>

<p>And now he was alive once more to the dreadful throbbing in
his head, and physical distress was super-imposed upon mental. He
felt sick and wanted to close his eyes and forget everything.</p>

<p>But with a mighty effort of will he pulled himself together
and forced his numbed brain to think.</p>

<p>No, things were not so hopeless after all, for he had brought
down one man, and he certainly would not be able to get away.
Then, even if the other man escaped, they would be able to learn
something from this prisoner as to whom were the other members of
the gang. A sick man was much easier to deal with than one who
was strong and well, and this man would not be injured enough to
prevent his speaking. He was sure he had not inflicted any vital
injury or hit the man in the body, for he had aimed very low, and
the man had not crumpled up as he fell, but had tried to save
himself by thrusting out his arm.</p>

<p>He thought hard.</p>

<p>But, surely, the other man could not escape either, for the
thick hedge stretched behind him, and emerging from the ditch at
either end, he would be at once exposing himself to his,
Larose's, fire.</p>

<p>A wan smile crept into the pale and bloodied face of the
detective as he considered what the thoughts of the two men must
now be.</p>

<p>They would be in a terrible state of perplexity, and quite
unable to weigh up the situation and determine what forces were
against them. They would be sure they had fallen into an ambush,
and yet they would be wondering by what possibility anyone could
have known they would be coming by this particular way. There
were a score and more of paths that would have led them from the
sandhills, and yet their flight by this particular one had
seemingly been expected and prepared for.</p>

<p>He looked round to make sure of his own position. He was upon
slightly rising ground and hidden among the long grass; there was
no danger of his being out-flanked. It was bright moonlight now
and every foot of the meadow was visible to him from where he
lay.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes passed and then it came to him
unpleasantly that although he was in no condition for any
physical exertion, he must yet do something. He could not just
lie there and wait, as if he were expecting them to pop up over
the ditch like rabbits and give him another shot.</p>

<p>But suddenly he heard the sharp crack of a pistol, coming from
the direction of where the two men had disappeared into the
ditch, and although no bullet had whined over him, he flattened
himself instantly, thinking they must have caught sight of him
somehow.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, followed. He heard no pistol crack again and
all was still and silent as the grave.</p>

<p>Then it flashed into his mind that the firing was a ruse upon
their part, for, becoming impatient, they had done it to see if
anything would happen.</p>

<p>He waited, perhaps, another two minutes, and then, realising
that his must be the next move, drew in a deep breath and
prepared for action.</p>

<p>Following the lay of the land with his eye, he saw that he
could cross the meadow under cover of the tall grass the whole
way, and strike the ditch about fifty yards beyond where the men
were lying. He would then be able to look over it and see along
its entire length. He must chance it that the unwounded man would
not double back at the exact moment when he was at the other
end.</p>

<p>He would be quite safe, he thought, for whatever happened, his
enemies could make no move to get behind him without his seeing
them, and even if the unwounded man had anticipated his action
and were coming to meet him, then at all events he would have him
in front.</p>

<p>Resolutely endeavoring to forget his pains and giddiness, he
started to crawl through the grass, never for one moment,
however, taking his eyes off the ditch. It was a painful journey,
and many times he had to stop and rest, lest he should collapse
altogether.</p>

<p>Then the very thing that he had been fearing happened, for
suddenly he saw a man rise up out of the other side of the ditch
about a hundred and fifty yards away, and using his bicycle as a
battering ram, begin thrusting it backwards and forwards into the
hedge, with the evident intention of forcing a way through.</p>

<p>The detective ground his teeth in rage, for he realised that
he could not prevent it. Where he lay, it was much too far away
to shoot, and to approach close enough to make any effective use
of his pistol, he would have to run the whole way in the open and
be exposing himself a good part of the time to the possible fire
of the second man, who, although wounded, might yet be not
incapacitated enough to be of no danger.</p>

<p>So he just lay where he was and watched the man thrusting his
machine into the hedge. It was all over in two minutes and then
man and bicycle disappeared.</p>

<p>The detective wondered what was going to happen next, and
then, determining that the second man should not escape too,
began crawling again through the grass, but this time proceeding
in a direction parallel to the ditch.</p>

<p>Arriving at a spot not very far from where the two men had
been travelling when he had shot the first one down, and chafing
under the thought that everything seemed to be slipping away from
him, he took a risk, and crawling to the ditch-side, leant boldly
over.</p>

<p>A wave of thankfulness surged through him. The second man and
his bicycle were still there, at the bottom of the ditch.</p>

<p>They were not twenty yards away and the man was lying upon his
side among the dead leaves, with his head upon his right arm,
which was outstretched. His pose was as if he were unconscious,
or asleep.</p>

<p>The detective, however, was taking no risks, and covered him
with his pistol, "If you move," he called out, "I'll put another
bullet into you."</p>

<p>But the man did not move and he did not speak. The detective
frowned. The man's pistol hand was covered over lightly with the
leaves, and while he might be unconscious, yet still&mdash;he
might be only just waiting his chance.</p>

<p>About a minute passed, and then the detective taking aim, put
three bullets in quick succession all round the recumbent figure,
scattering the leaves in all directions.</p>

<p>But nothing happened, and then with a sharp ejaculation, he
slipped down into the ditch, and springing to the side of the
man, bent over him.</p>

<p>The man was quite dead. There was a bullet wound at the back
of his head, and he had been shot at such close range that the
hair was all singed round where the bullet had gone in.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>

THE RAID UPON THE ABBEY</h2>

<p class="first">IT was an hour or more after Larose had bent
down over the dead man in the ditch before he was again in the
full possession of his senses. The injuries he had received and
the varying emotions of the night had been too much for him, and
he had just collapsed and fallen where he was.</p>

<p>He had lain in a sort of stupor among the dead leaves, close
beside the body, and when at length he opened his eyes, it was to
find them within a few inches of a tired, white face, fouled over
in blood and mud. He had flung one of his arms, too, as if
protectingly, over the head of the dead man and his fingers were
sticky, in an unpleasant way.</p>

<p>For a few seconds he stared incredulously at his companion
among the leaves, and then with a choke of horror, he snatched
his arm away and recoiled in disgust.</p>

<p>Then in a flash everything came back to him. The stone house
upon the marsh&mdash;the room where he had lain, awaiting
death&mdash;the coming of Henrik&mdash;his path of agony among
the sandhills&mdash;his firing upon his enemies&mdash;and finally
his discovery of the bullet hole in the head of the man who was
now lying so near to him.</p>

<p>He sat up and began chafing his legs for they were stiff and
cold. His head was still hurting, but the pain there was now
bearable, and he thought that with an effort he would be able to
make his way home to the Abbey. Then he would decide what must he
his next move, for there were so many things to consider, and he
could not determine anything, off-hand.</p>

<p>He looked mechanically at his wrist to ascertain the time, but
instantly remembered that his watch had not been upon him when
Henrik was carrying him away. Then, turning again to regard the
dead man, he perceived that the latter was now wearing it.</p>

<p>He smiled a grim smile, as he unstrapped it. The way of the
world every time. How quickly the wheel of fortune swung over. So
soon was the despoiler&mdash;despoiled!</p>

<p>But if he did find the watch upon the body&mdash;that was the
only thing he found, for all the man's pockets had been emptied
and turned inside out.</p>

<p>"And to think what a nerve his murderer had!" he thought
wearily. "To stay here and empty his pockets, when at any moment,
for all he knew, a dozen enemies might be leaping down upon him
over the ditch side!"</p>

<p>He saw where his own bullet had struck the man, through the
bone just below the knee.</p>

<p>"Well, I am in no condition now to go over him more
thoroughly," he sighed, "but to-morrow we'll come and see what we
can learn!"</p>

<p>Then an idea struck him, and with the intention of riding
away, at the price of much renewed throbbing of his head, he
hauled the bicycle up on to the meadow.</p>

<p>But he realised instantly that he would never be able to mount
it, for he was too shaky in all his limbs and indeed twice, fell
over it in his attempts to raise it up. So he left it where it
was and started away on foot.</p>

<p>And he soon found that there was a dreadful pilgrimage before
him. His giddiness came back at once, his head throbbed like an
engine, and it was agonising even to proceed very slowly, taking
only a few stops at a time.</p>

<p>But he plodded on and on, with each hundred yards becoming an
eternity of time.</p>

<p>At last it dawned upon him that he would never succeed in
reaching the Abbey, and he was half-minded to give up all further
struggling, and pass the rest of the night under a hedge. But the
air was so cold and chilling that he was afraid with any lying
down he might pass into a stupor. He looked at his watch and saw
that it was getting on for half-past one.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that it would be much nearer to go to the
bungalow where Sir Parry's housekeeper lived, and he smiled in
comical relief at the thought that there, as well as shelter, he
would be able to receive treatment for his hurts.</p>

<p>A nurse attendant at a lunatic asylum would certainly know
something about blows and bruises, and be able to relieve his
pains!</p>

<p>So he turned his steps in the direction of the wood behind Sir
Parry's house and at length was standing before the bungalow
where the housekeeper lived.</p>

<p>The place was all in darkness, but one of the windows was open
and he called out over the garden fence.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dilling, Mrs. Dilling, I'm Mr. Larose and I want you."
He could not have shouted loudly if he had wanted to, and his
voice was very faint, but the woman heard him, and almost as soon
as he had finished speaking had put her head out of the
window.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked quickly. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I've been hurt," replied Larose, "and I feel as if I were
almost going to faint," and he started to totter up the garden
path.</p>

<p>A sharp exclamation came from her, and before he had had time
to reach the door, it opened and she stood before him, in a
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and then she caught him in
her arms.</p>

<p>Then with all the competence of one who had been trained in a
good school, she took everything in hand.</p>

<p>She lifted him up bodily and carried him on to her bed. She
lit the lamp with fingers that were perfectly steady. She felt
his pulse and gave him two tablespoonfuls of brandy. She
partially undressed him and covered him over with blankets. She
lit the oil heater and gave him two hot-water bags, one at his
feet and one over his heart. She bathed and bandaged his head,
and finally brought in a basin of soup and fed him with it
herself.</p>

<p>And it was all done without any fuss or bother, and with the
thoroughness of one who was delighting in her work. And not only
did she do it with thoroughness, but with sympathy as well, for
Larose saw her eyes fill with tears as she was bending over his
wound.</p>

<p>"Now, you're not hurt much," she said cheerfully, "and there's
no bone broken. A good long sleep and you'll almost be your own
self again."</p>

<p>The detective felt his heart too full for words. Hopeless and
in the last stages of exhaustion but a little while ago, he had
passed suddenly into peace, comfort and tender care. This gaunt-faced woman was as a mother in her loving-kindness and the
gentleness of sweet heart was in the touch of her hands.</p>

<p>A feeling of delicious drowsiness began to creep over him and
he seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper into a delightful
feather bed. Then all his pains and troubles passed from him and
he was unconscious to all the world.</p>

<p>"He'll do," nodded the woman as she bent over him. "He'll
sleep now for twelve hours."</p>

<p>But several times during the night and long after dawn had
broken, she crept in to listen to his breathing and feel his
pulse. He was, however, quite oblivious to her presence.</p>

<p>Just before half-past seven she locked the doors of the
bungalow, and, accompanied by the deaf and dumb girl who lived
with her, proceeded to Sir Parry's house.</p>

<p>But the detective slept on and on and on.</p>

<p>Sir Parry was in a bad humor that morning and directly he set
eyes upon his housekeeper he handed her a piece of paper on which
was written in precise and neat handwriting, "I shall not be in
to dinner to-night, and don't you forget you are never to come
here except during your prescribed hours. I am annoyed with
you."</p>

<p>The woman nodded, pointing with an apologetic gesture,
however, to the curtains, but her master only frowned.</p>

<p>"She has no intelligence," he said out loud, "just the duster
and the kettle mind."</p>

<p><br>
LAROSE awoke at last and felt very sorry for himself
straightaway. His head ached and was very sore. His body ached,
too, and he was not certain he had not got a chill. He was very
thirsty.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, but it had stopped, and he could form
no idea of the time from the light outside, because the blinds
were drawn.</p>

<p>There were a water-bottle and a tumbler upon the table near
his bedside, and he reached out and gave himself a long
drink.</p>

<p>The housekeeper must have been listening for any movement, for
before even he had put the tumbler down, the door opened and she
came into the room.</p>

<p>"You are feeling better?" she asked, and then seeing the
hesitating look upon the detective's face, she added quickly,
"But, of course, you won't be feeling too good yet, for the wound
will be stiff and sore and your head may ache for days."</p>

<p>"Never mind my poor head," said the detective ruefully, as she
was proceeding to raise the blinds a little, "tell me, what is
the time?"</p>

<p>"Just half-past four," was the reply, "and you've had a nice
long sleep. You needed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose had started up in the bed, and was now regarding
her with angry eyes. "Half-past four!" he ejaculated. His voice
was very stern. "Then you drugged me, Mrs. Dilling."</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded calmly. "I put some luminal in your
soup."</p>

<p>He dropped back weakly upon the pillows. "Good God!" he
exclaimed, "but you don't know what you have done."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes I do," she replied, "and I've saved you from an
absolute breakdown. You were sick unto death when you came here
last night."</p>

<p>She moved over to the bedside and sat down. "I've a lot to
tell you, Mr. Larose," she went on, "and I'm going to keep
nothing back." She hardly breathed the next words. "My master
intended to poison you yesterday, but I changed the poison for
bicarbonate of soda, and that is why you are alive now. Listen to
me."</p>

<p>Two hours later, and when it was quite dark, a very pale-faced
and rather tottery Larose was making his way through the little
door in the fence that separated Sir Parry's property from the
Abbey grounds.</p>

<p>He was feeling weak and ill, but the expression upon his face
was a bright one, and, indeed, he seemed in quite a cheerful
frame of mind.</p>

<p>But the moment he had closed the door behind him the
cheerfulness all passed and his face puckered into a frown as he
looked round.</p>

<p>"What the devil is happening?" he asked himself breathlessly.
"Has everyone gone mad?"</p>

<p>And he might well ask, for not only was the Abbey itself a
blaze of light, with every window lit up, but in all directions
in the grounds, he could see lanterns and torches flashing among
the trees.</p>

<p>In dreadful foreboding he raced over to the light that was
nearest to him. "What's happening?" he asked of a man who was
beating through some bushes, and he saw he was addressing one of
the under-footmen. "I'm the detective from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>The man appeared to be in a state of great excitement, and he
jerked out, "The little master's missing, sir. He can't be found
anywhere and we are beating all round the park."</p>

<p>The heart of the detective almost stopped still. "When did it
happen? Tell me quick," he commanded.</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes ago, sir," replied the footman. "Not
more than that."</p>

<p>"But tell me all about it," snapped Larose, "and don't waste a
second. Where was he last seen?"</p>

<p>"He was with Sir Arnold Medway, sir. He had cut his finger and
wouldn't let anyone attend to it. Then Sir Arnold coaxed him into
the library and was going to put some plaster upon it, when he
found he'd left his glasses in the lounge and went to fetch them.
Then when he came back the little boy had disappeared!" The man
spoke very quickly. "And we are being sent to search the grounds
now, but I don't see how he could have got out of the Abbey, for
the only door that was open at the time was the front door, and
one of the gardeners was in the drive just at that time, looking
for a trowel that he had dropped, and he is sure no one passed
him."</p>

<p>Larose thought like lightning. The last place where the child
was seen was the library! The library was close to the lumber-room! The enemy in the Abbey knew of the existence of the lumber-room and the boarded-up well-chamber behind it! Then if the child
had been taken, what was more probable than that he was hidden
there! He might have been gagged or silenced somehow, with his
kidnapper just waiting until the hue and cry had gone down
outside, to return and get him away. Ah! but had the butler
finished with the lumber-room and left the door unlocked?</p>

<p>With a nod of thanks to the footman, Larose ran to the
cloister door, rejoicing that its key had been among the things
that Henrik had returned to his pocket along with the little
automatic.</p>

<p>He passed into the Abbey and ran up the long passage to the
lumber-room door. It was shut but not locked, and he was inside
in two seconds.</p>

<p>He had no torch with him, but quickly striking a match, saw at
once that the child was not there. Then, starting to thread his
way among the tins and rubbish towards the boarded-up end of the
room, as the match flickered and died in his fingers, he suddenly
became aware of a smell, other than paint or varnish. It was
faint, but distinctly ether-like in its character; it reminded
him of a hospital.</p>

<p>"It's not chloroform or ether," he panted. "It's more like
ethyl chloride," and knowing the explosive nature of all ether-like vapors, he refrained from striking another match.</p>

<p>He groped his way warily across the room, with the strange
smell certainly becoming no weaker, and then, reaching the boards
shutting off the well-chamber, he pushed them quickly apart and
dropped on to his hands and knees to pass through. The smell had
now become quite strong.</p>

<p>Holding his breath in his excitement, he started to crawl
round the sides of the little chamber, and almost immediately was
electrified by one of his hands coming in contact with a warm
face.</p>

<p>He passed his hands down to the body and with no surprise
found that it was a little child. He bent his head down and heard
slow and regular breathing. Then in one lightning flash of
thought he made up his mind what he would do.</p>

<p>For the moment no one should be told that the child had been
found, and he would himself hide him away again. Then, a watch
being set upon the well chamber, they would catch at least one of
the kidnappers red-handed, as, all unknowing that his secret had
been discovered, he would be coming later to take the child.</p>

<p>Yes, that was the right thing to do, for it was imperative,
above all things, that everyone involved in the kidnapping should
be unmasked. If the child were now at once restored to his
mother, then the position would be exactly as it had been before,
with the unknown enemy lurking close at hand, and waiting for the
opportunity to strike.</p>

<p>He lifted the child tenderly into his arms and groped his way
back into the lumber-room. Then, replacing the boards carefully,
in a few seconds he was outside and running swiftly down the long
passage to the little cloister door.</p>

<p>He let himself out and pushed to the door, without, however,
closing it. Then, proceeding for about twenty yards and keeping
all the time close to the walls of the Abbey, he laid the little
boy down in the middle of a bed of chrysanthemums. Then be raced
over to where he saw the searchers were still busy with their
lanterns and addressed the first one he came to. He recognised
him as one of the gardeners.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he said. "I want you. Put out your lantern and come
with me," and the man, recognising the detective, obeyed at
once.</p>

<p>He led him with all speed through the cloister door, and then,
at the beginning of the long passage, stopped abruptly and spoke
very sternly.</p>

<p>"Now you know I'm a detective from Scotland Yard," he said.
"Well, I'm going to give you a special job to do and you'll have
to keep all your wits about you to do it properly."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the man, "I'll do my best."</p>

<p>The detective went on. "You know the lumber-room up on the
left there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, where they keep the paint?"</p>

<p>"Good! then I'm going to leave you to watch that door, for I
expect someone may be coming to it any minute, and I want to know
who he will be."</p>

<p>The man spoke in a hoarse whisper. "But I mayn't be able to
see him come, sir, in the dark like this."</p>

<p>"Oh! you'll have light enough," snapped the detective.
"There's the reflection from that light round the corner, over
the library door." An idea came to him suddenly and he added
quickly, "and if that light goes out, tip-toe instantly up to the
lumber-room and grapple with anyone who comes near. It'll be the
man I want, and you're to shout and shout until help comes, and
you learn then whom you have been holding. You understand? You
are not to let him go until there are witnesses present. Myself,
I shan't be gone long, perhaps only a quarter of an hour, but on
no account are you to go away until I return."</p>

<p>The detective left the man on guard, and a few minutes later,
along with Sir Parry's housekeeper, was bending over the little
baronet, who was lying upon her bed.</p>

<p>"They've given him morphia," she said in an awe-struck tone,
as she lifted up one of his eyelids, "and, look, there is where
they put the needle into his arm." Her face lost a little of its
anxiety. "But the pulse and breathing are good and he's not
injured in any way."</p>

<p>Larose looked her straight in the eyes. "And I can trust you?"
he asked sternly. "There'll be no going back now?"</p>

<p>"You can trust me," she replied firmly, "and no one shall see
him if he's here a week, for, as I've told you, no one ever comes
here." She laid her hand upon the detective's arm and her anxiety
seemed to come back. "But you be careful, Mr. Larose," she
warned. "You ought to be in bed yourself and not rushing about
like this."</p>

<p>"All in the day's work," smiled the detective wanly, "and I'm
really much stronger than you think. I shall be quite all right,
so don't worry."</p>

<p>But he was not feeling quite so sure about himself as he
hurried back to the Abbey, for the dreadful giddiness was
returning, and, altogether, he felt very weak and ill.</p>

<p>He gained the cloister door without meeting anyone, and then,
to his consternation, found that he had lost the key. It must
have dropped out of his pocket, he thought, as he had been
running with the little boy. Anyhow, it was a most unfortunate
happening, for now he would have to go right round to the other
side of the building to enter by the back door, and the
possibility was that he might not now get in unseen by those he
was particularly wishing to avoid. He was, however, relieved to
find that the big front door was now closed, for no broad beam of
light was streaming from it on to the gravelled drive.</p>

<p>But his good fortune was dead out, for just as he was passing
the door, it swung open, and Sir Arnold Medway, standing just
inside the hall, called out loudly, "Oh! here is Mr. Larose. He's
here. Lady Ardane."</p>

<p>The detective would have muttered many bad words if he had not
been feeling altogether too exhausted to expend any unnecessary
breath.</p>

<p>There was now no help for it, and he had to cross into the
lounge and become at once the centre of all interest and the
cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>Everyone in the Abbey seemed to be there, but among the little
sea of faces that confronted him, that of Lady Ardane stood out
most clearly.</p>

<p>She was standing by her step-father, and deadly pale. It was
evident that it was only by a tremendous effort she was
restraining herself from tears. The expression upon her face was
one of absolute terror, and her eyes were drawn and strained, as
if she were already seeing the dead body of her child before
her.</p>

<p>But the detective was given no time to indulge in any feelings
of pity, for the moment Senator Harvey caught sight of him, he
shouted angrily.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, sir? Do you know my grandson cannot be
found?"</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "Yes, one of the men has just told me,"
he replied very quietly.</p>

<p>"And what were you brought down here for," went on the Senator
furiously, "except to see that they didn't get him?"</p>

<p>"I can't be everywhere, Senator Harvey," said Larose in the
same level tones, "and I had to go away upon some inquiries."</p>

<p>"Inquiries, you dud policeman!" thundered the Senator, "and
when you were making them the child was taken. You told my
daughter he would be quite safe as long as you were here, and she
believed you, but I never did think much of you from the first
moment you arrived"&mdash;he sneered scoffingly&mdash;"with your
gold cigarette case and your wonderful ties!" He snapped his
fingers together. "Anyhow, we've rung up Norwich and told them
you're no good. They've got the matter in hand now."</p>

<p>"We rang up Norwich, Mr. Larose," explained Lady Ardane with
studied calmness, "because we didn't know where you were
and"&mdash;she bit upon her lip to express her emotion&mdash;"we
had no one here to give us any advice."</p>

<p>"But you ought not to have left the Abbey for so long, Mr.
Larose," broke in Sir Parry sharply. "It was very ill advised and
quite inexcusable, and you haven't told the Senator yet where
you've been."</p>

<p>The detective's great anxiety was to get away as speedily as
possible, and he ignored Sir Parry altogether. Instead, he turned
to Lady Ardane.</p>

<p>"It's not hopeless yet," he said quickly, "and we mustn't lose
heart. The Superintendent at Norwich is a most capable man, and
he'll have had every road blocked within ten minutes of your
call. The wretches can't get very far away." He put his hand up
to his head with a grimace of pain. "I've met with a little
injury here, but directly I've changed my clothes I'll want to
speak to you again."</p>

<p>He left the lounge in a direction as if he were going up to
his room, but, perceiving that no one was following him, turned
off in the corridor and made his way as quickly as he could to
the passage where he left the gardener on watch. The man was
still there and the detective asked breathlessly, "Anyone
been?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite a lot of people," replied the man. "They came
just after you had gone."</p>

<p>"Then who were they? Tell me, quick," went on Larose with a
dreadful sinking at his heart, for the man had spoken so
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Mr. Polkinghorne, Sir Parry, Senator Harvey, Sir Arnold, one
of the new gentlemen whose name I don't know, and Mr. Lestrange,"
rattled off the man as if very pleased with himself for
remembering everyone so pat.</p>

<p>"Who came first," snapped Larose, "and what did he do?"</p>

<p>"They all came together," was the reply, "with a lantern and
torches, and they went inside and I heard them moving the tins
about." He seemed half afraid that he had done something wrong
and added hesitatingly, "I didn't interfere."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't," laughed Larose, with a hollow laugh.
"You kept away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and they didn't see me. They only stayed a couple
of minutes."</p>

<p>The detective sighed. "Well, light your lantern now," he said
"and we'll go and see if they've made the room untidy."</p>

<p>But the room seemed just as he had left it except that the
loose boards at the end were now gaping open and the ether-like
smell had gone.</p>

<p>He thanked the gardener for his services, and then a great
feeling of faintness coming over him, he asked the man to help
him up to his room. "And we'll go up the back stairs, please, so
that we'll be less likely to meet anyone."</p>

<p>The gardener looked very concerned and well he might, for it
seemed the detective could hardly stand. The many emotions of the
last hour, following upon his sufferings of the previous night,
had proved too much, even for the iron constitution that he
possessed.</p>

<p>The man saw him to his room and was then despatched with an
urgent message to Peter Hollins to come at once.</p>

<p>Larose lay back upon the bed, too exhausted even to undress.
It was not only that his head was throbbing and he felt sick and
giddy, but every bone in his body seemed to ache, and he knew he
was running a temperature. And his mental state made his physical
one much worse, for if ever, he told himself, a cool head were
required it was required then&mdash;and he knew he was almost
down and out.</p>

<p>In the light of what he had learned from Sir Perry's
housekeeper, coupled with what he had found out for himself, the
position of Lady Ardane stood out as a terribly dangerous one,
and she must be warned, with no delay, of what was
threatening.</p>

<p>He had not dared to warn her openly in the lounge, for her
possible enemies were there with her then, and a premature
disclosure would have ruined everything.</p>

<p>It was dreadful that he should be struck down at the critical
moment and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But his thoughts were interrupted by a tap upon the door and
the young nightwatchman entered the room.</p>

<p>"A pencil and a piece of paper from the desk," whispered
Larose, "and an envelope. I'm not very well."</p>

<p>Hollins at once brought what he required, regarding the
detective, however, with very troubled eyes.</p>

<p>Larose proceeded to inscribe in shaky characters: "Don't
worry, I have got your child back. He is safe with friends, but
on no account breathe this to a soul, or he may be taken again.
Trust me and burn this at once. P.S.&mdash;I am not very well. I
got hurt last night. That is why I was away."</p>

<p>"Now take this to Lady Ardane," he said, "and give it to her,
but only into her own hands. Tell her I'll be better soon and
will then come and speak to her. You understand?"</p>

<p>The young follow nodded, thinking at the same time that if he
had never seen a sick man before, he was seeing one then.</p>

<p>Just as he was leaving the room, however, Larose asked with a
great effort, "Oh! one thing, before you go. Did anything happen
here to-day, before the child was taken, that would interest
me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of," replied Hollins after consideration,
"except that one of the footmen told me old Henrik came up early
this morning with a letter for Sir Arnold, and when Sir Arnold
had read it, he got his car out of the garage and drove away at
once. He took Henrik with him. Also we've just heard that the
body of a man who's been murdered has been found in a field about
two miles away from here."</p>

<p>The detective made no comment, and Hollins, thinking he had
dropped off to sleep, tip-toed from his room.</p>

<p>Now the assistant-scoutmaster was accustomed to shoulder
responsibility, and having walked very thoughtfully down the
stairs upon his mission to find Lady Ardane, he first inquired of
the butler, whom he encountered in the lounge, where Sir Arnold
Medway was likely to be found.</p>

<p>He was sent to the drawing-room and, going up to Sir Arnold
there, explained respectfully that he had just come from the
detective, and was of opinion that the latter was looking very
ill and ought to be seen by a doctor. The detective was so weak,
he added, that he could hardly speak, and, indeed, seemed upon
the point of collapse.</p>

<p>The great surgeon rose up at once. "Thank you, young man," he
said. "You did quite right in coming to me. I thought just now
that Mr. Larose was looking ill."</p>

<p>And so if happened that a few minutes later Larose, feeling
someone's fingers upon his pulse, opened his eyes wearily, to
find Sir Arnold Medway bending over him.</p>

<p>The detective's mind had by this time become very confused,
and, drawing his hand away, he tried to shout "Traitor," but the
shout never rose above a whisper, and then he was only very dimly
conscious of what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>He thought he was being undressed again, the second time he
had undergone that indignity within twenty-four hours. Then
something was done to his head, and he received a hypodermic
injection in his arm. After that he speedily became unconscious
of everything.</p>

<p>The next day, when he awoke, he found there was a nurse in
uniform in attendance upon him. He started to speak, but, she
told him that he was not to talk and he dropped off to sleep
again.</p>

<p>Then he thought Lady Ardane came to speak to him, and he
called her "Helen," but a man, something like Sir Arnold to look
at, ordered her away and the room became very dark. Then an
eternity of time seemed to pass before he awoke one day to find
that at last he could think quite clearly, and, seeing the nurse
by the window, he called her to him.</p>

<p>"I'm much better," he said cheerfully. "I'm nearly all right
now. How long have I been here?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," she replied with all the importance that
some people always feel when they are withholding even the
simplest form of information. "When one is sick days don't count
at all."</p>

<p>"But that's all nonsense when one is being taken away from
one's work," argued Larose. "Well, what day of the week is it?
Ah! you needn't tell me. It's Sunday, for I hear the church
bells." He passed his hand over his chin. "And it isn't weeks
that I've been here&mdash;only days, and therefore today is the
fifth one, as I was taken ill on Tuesday."</p>

<p>With no comment the nurse left the room, and a few minutes
later, returned with Sir Arnold, who, drawing a chair up to the
bedside, nodded smilingly.</p>

<p>"And how are you feeling, Mr. Larose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Much better, thank you," replied the detective. "Except for
being rather weak, I feel almost well."</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head. "I know you've the heart of a
lion," he said, "but a little time will have to pass yet before
you're anything like well. You've been a sick man, you know."</p>

<p>"But I want to get up," said Larose. "I must get up to-day."</p>

<p>Sir Arnold shook his head. "No," he said emphatically, "you'll
do nothing of the sort." He leant over and laid his hand upon the
detective's arm. "Look here, my friend. You're a master in your
kingdom"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"and I'm supposed
to be not without some authority in mine." He looked very stern.
"Well, you are in my territory now and you'll have to obey me, so
you'll get up when I allow you and not a minute before then. No,
no, I know how urgent everything is"&mdash;his voice was very
gentle&mdash;"and for the sake of Helen Ardane I'll let you out
of bed the first minute that I dare."</p>

<p>"Well, may I speak to her," asked Larose, "only just a few
words?"</p>

<p>Sir Arnold held up his hand protestingly. "To-morrow we'll
talk about it, but to-day"&mdash;he patted him kindly upon the
hand&mdash;"you'll just take your medicine and be a good
boy."</p>

<p>"But what made me feel so ill?" asked Larose. "You can at
least tell me that."</p>

<p>Sir Arnold screwed up his eyebrows. "What I might almost
call," he said slowly, "a form of delayed shock coming upon the
top of a chill. You had a very nasty head wound, and from the
crumpled state of your clothes, you had also been lying out upon
the wet ground for some time; indeed I almost thought that first
night that you were in for pneumonia." He rose from his chair.
"But there, that's enough for to-day. To-morrow, perhaps, we'll
have a little talk together and tell each other lots of things."
He laughed. "Really, it seems that you detectives are always
getting into the wars."</p>

<p>Larose meditated for a long time after he had gone. "And for a
man whose actions want a lot of explaining," he sighed, "I am
prejudiced a lot in his favor. I don't understand it at all,
unless it be that a thoroughly bad man in private life can yet be
a saint in his profession."</p>

<p>He asked the nurse for a newspaper, and upon her emphatic
refusal, sighed again and tried to compose himself for sleep.</p>

<p>The following morning he felt very much better, and in the
absence of the nurse for a few minutes, slipped on to the floor
and walked round the room. But he was very glad to reach the bed
again, and made a wry face as he tucked himself into the
clothes.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gilbert, not to-day," he said. "To-morrow, perhaps,
or maybe about Wednesday, you'll be beginning to make things
unpleasant for someone." He sighed. "The devil of it is, you have
so many people to put before the sights of your gun."</p>

<p>All that morning he waited for the coming of Sir Arnold, but
to his great disappointment there was no sign of him. The
afternoon began to wane and still he did not come. Then just
before dusk and when the detective had almost given up hope of
seeing him, the surgeon strode into the room, and briskly pulling
up a chair to the bedside, with a curt nod laid his fingers upon
Larose's pulse. The latter was too angry to speak.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the surgeon after a few moments, "and now you are
in a fit state for us to have our little talk." He smiled. "No,
don't look so angry, I purposely stayed away to ensure of your
having another day in bed. When I have gone you can get up for a
couple of hours, and to-morrow&mdash;well, to-morrow you shall
get up and come down stairs."</p>

<p>He turned round. "You can leave us for a few minutes, Sister,"
he said to the nurse. "We have some private matters to discuss.
I'll ring when I'm going," and when she had left the room, he
turned to the detective and eyed him very grimly.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," he said, "I have a lot to tell you, but
before I begin I want to know how we stand and what exactly are
our relations to each other." He spoke very deliberately. "Since
I have had the privilege of giving you my professional services,
you have called me a traitor, a betrayer, a scoundrel and quite a
lot of other unpleasant things, and that you were not mistaking
me for someone else is evident, because you kept on coupling
these epithets with references to my profession and the disgrace
that I was bringing upon it." He spoke very sternly. "Now,
please, what did you mean and what have you against me!"</p>

<p>Larose was quite calm and collected. All his professional
instincts had been aroused and he was in no way over-awed by the
stern tone of the great surgeon.</p>

<p>"I'll mince no words," he said sharply. "I'm not sure of
you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Sir Arnold sarcastically. "That's
unfortunate."</p>

<p>"You were the last person to be with the child before he
disappeared," said Larose.</p>

<p>"Quite so!" agreed the surgeon. "I was the last."</p>

<p>"Then I know you," went on Larose, "to have been consorting
with two members of the very gang who took part in that attack
upon Lady Ardane when I was with her in her car." He punctuated
every word. "I saw you come out of that house upon the marsh
where they were hiding. I was not ten yards away, between the
hedge, and with my own ears, I heard you warn them to be on the
lookout for someone&mdash;presumably me." He tapped his still
bandaged head. "And I got that, because of your warning."</p>

<p>Then, to his astonishment, Sir Arnold looked very amused. "So,
you were there," he said with a smile, "when I was bidding good
night to those two gentlemen, one of whom, later in the
evening"&mdash;the smile dropped from his face now&mdash;"you
pistolled in the back of the head at very close range, after you
had already drilled a hole in his tibia."</p>

<p>The detective flushed hotly. "The head injury was not mine,"
he said, "but I admit the leg one was."</p>

<p>"I am glad to learn it," commented the surgeon, "for, upon the
face of it, it does not seem a very sportsmanlike action to shoot
anyone from behind, when he's already down and out from another
injury." He went on, but now speaking very quietly. "The
explanation of my calling at that house is very simple, and when
you have heard it, if you are the reasonable man that I believe
you to be, it will exonerate me in your eyes"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"from all consorting, as you call it, with
criminals."</p>

<p>"I shall need some convincing," said the detective stubbornly,
"for I cannot put out of my mind that you have been close at hand
upon the occasion of two other misfortunes besides that of the
disappearance of the child. You were stationed next to me when
that attempt at murder was made upon the afternoon of the shoot,
and the third time, you were close by when I nearly suffered
death in the house upon the marsh." He shook his head. "The three
things taken together look suspicious."</p>

<p>But Sir Arnold smiled again. "Hear me, my friend, and then be
my judge. The explanation of my calling at that house is very
simple. I had not been too pleased with the condition of that
fisherman's hand and walked over to have a look at it that
evening. But he was away, setting his lines, and I did not see
him. Then, starting to return, I saw a light in that stone house,
and the idea struck me that I could leave a message there for
Henrik to come up and see me the next day. The occupants were
most polite and I went in and had a little chat with them. Then,
upon leaving, you must have overheard the one who opened the door
for me promise to keep a look-out for Henrik's return and give
him my message."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "No, Mr. Larose, I had never seen
those men before I called that night and one of them I have not
seen since. The other I have, however, seen&mdash;in the mortuary
shed at Burnham Market. His body was discovered not many hours
after he had been shot, and from certain information which I
received I was of opinion that his death was your handiwork." He
nodded. "That opinion, however, I may add, I have kept strictly
to myself."</p>

<p>With each word that Sir Arnold had uttered the suspicions of
the detective had been growing weaker, and he began to realise
most uncomfortably that not only had his judgment been at fault,
once more, but also that instead of making discoveries about Sir
Arnold, the latter had been making discoveries about him!</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Larose," said Sir Arnold with a smile, "now what's
the verdict? Do you believe me&mdash;with no reservation in your
belief?"</p>

<p>The detective regarded the calm, proud face before him; the
serene truthful eyes; the broad, open brow; the mouth, with its
strong, yet tender lines; the firm, resolute chin, and the whole
mien as that of a man who had no fear that anything might be
found out against him. He regarded him intently for a few moments
and then was quite convinced.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Arnold, I do," he said quickly, "and I realise now
that I was foolish to ever doubt you. The only excuse is that
there were some things that did need explaining." He nodded.
"There were, were there not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," nodded back Sir Arnold. "If you saw me talking to
those men, and found it imperative to shoot one of them
afterwards, I don't wonder your suspicions were aroused." His
face assumed a most serious expression. "But now, sir, I have
some bad news for you." He looked him straight in the eyes. "They
got Lady Ardane three days ago. She was seized and carried off
before our very eyes about half-past four on Thursday
afternoon."</p>

<p>Larose was too stunned to speak. His heart seemed to stand
still and he stared at Sir Arnold with the face of a ghost. The
latter went on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was no one's fault, for no vigilance could have foreseen
what was going to happen. She was with Sir Parry, about midway
between the Abbey and the fence, when the red delivery van of
Burnham Market Store came up the drive. Suddenly then the van
turned round and stopped. Four men sprang out and seized Lady
Ardane and Sir Parry. They both struggled, but it was quite
hopeless, and they were dragged into the van and off it went. The
whole thing was over in two minutes."</p>

<p>"But some one went after them in the Abbey cars!" exclaimed
Larose hoarsely and in a perfect agony at the recital.</p>

<p>"Every car was out of action," said Sir Arnold solemnly, "for
the commutator in each one had been taken away. Also, the two
motor bicycles had been tampered with, and as before, but this
time a quarter of a mile away, the telephone wires had been
cut."</p>

<p>Then the horror-struck detective learnt all that had happened
that Tuesday afternoon, but there was not really very much to
tell in detail, for the kidnappers had just come and gone and
left no trails behind them.</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that the customary Thursday afternoon
route of the grocery van must have been well known to them, for
their work there, as in the Abbey grounds, had been accomplished
without a second's waste of time.</p>

<p>The driver of the van had been hailed in an unfrequented lane
by a man who was lying upon the ground, as if he had been
seriously hurt, and the driver had at once stopped to find out
what was the matter. Then suddenly, as he had told afterwards, a
number of men had sprung out of the hedge, and stunned and bound
him and thrown him into the ditch.</p>

<p>Then, apparently the van had been driven straight to the Abbey
and the abduction carried out.</p>

<p>The police had been communicated with, with all possible
speed, but although the country had been scoured in all
directions, as before with the disappearance of the little
baronet, they had not caught the kidnappers, and indeed could
light upon no traces of them in any direction, after they had got
away.</p>

<p>The grocery van had, however, been recovered the next day. It
had been run into a thick wood, not three miles distant from the
Abbey, upon the Falenham road. And that was all Sir Arnold could
tell about what had happened.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished speaking, Larose had apparently
recovered his composure, with all signs of his distress having
passed. It was not, however, that he was not in terrible anxiety,
but he was determined that by not giving way to emotion would he
delay by one minute the hour when he would be allowed to take up
his work.</p>

<p>But another shock was yet in store for him, although this time
it was by no means of so unpleasant a nature as the last one.</p>

<p>Sir Arnold spoke again. "In one thing, however, Mr. Larose,"
he said very solemnly, "we can both rejoice, for Lady Ardane did
not go away a stricken woman, in terror of what had happened to
her little boy. She did not know what had happened to him, but
she had your note, and with implicit faith in your word, she knew
her enemies had not obtained possession of her child."</p>

<p>"What do you know about my note?" asked Larose sharply. "Did
she tell you what it contained?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sir Arnold at once, "and it was not until she
had been gone a day that I guessed what you had written to her,
and could then understand the calm assurance with which she had
taken the loss of little Charles."</p>

<p>The detective frowned, with the dreadful thought now coursing
through him that he might have given away many secrets during the
time he had been ill.</p>

<p>Sir Arnold patted him in a most kindly fashion upon his hand.
"But I haven't told anyone," he went on, "least of all, your
brother police, that I go twice a day to see how the little boy
is getting on." He smiled good-humoredly. "Oh! it's quite simple
how I came to find out. The day after Sir Parry had been seized
along with Lady Ardane, I thought it only decent to go and let
his servants know what had happened. But they were not at Sir
Parry's house, so I went round to find the bungalow that I had
heard of, among the trees, and imagine my amazement when Charles
came running out directly he heard my voice calling over the
fence. The housekeeper at first refused to tell me anything, but
upon learning that I intended to take the child away, she broke
down and confessed everything."</p>

<p>"No blame can attach to her in any case," said Larose
instantly. "She took her orders from me, and I am responsible for
anything she has done."</p>

<p>"And in my opinion," continued Sir Arnold, "you neither of you
could have acted better than you have done. I won her confidence
by assuring her that I was your friend and was looking after you
professionally, and I got the whole story from her as to how the
child had been found." He laughed. "Really it was most audacious
of you to hide him again, and it was pure bad luck that so many
of us went with Polkinghorne to search that room."</p>

<p>"Who first suggested going there," asked Larose, "for that
will at all events clear some one?"</p>

<p>"Polkinghorne," was the reply, "for he was afraid he might
have left the door open after he had removed some kittens that
had been there and he thought the child might have fallen over
and got stunned among those tins."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," said Larose drily, "that the house party has
all broken down now. Bernard Daller has gone, Clive Huntington
has gone and probably that Theodore Rankin." He scoffed. "The
hounds have been called off, now the deer has been taken."</p>

<p>"You are quite right about the first two," replied Sir Arnold,
"but Rankin is still here. He and the Senator are very busy and
out all day, but I have no idea what they are doing."</p>

<p>"One thing more," asked Larose. "I am curious to learn how you
came to associate me with that man who was shot."</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head. "And that is the one little thing
I may not tell you," he replied, "for it is a secret, not all my
own." He changed the subject abruptly. "Well, you may get up now
for a couple of hours, to-morrow you may be up all day, and on
Wednesday"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"I suppose you will be your own
willful self again. I will wash my hands of you then."</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>

THE HOUNDS UPON THE TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">THE morning of the day but one following upon
the confidential talk between Larose and Sir Arnold Medway, a
little after nine o'clock the two set out in the latter's car to
visit the house upon the marsh, where but a few nights previously
the detective had lain, awaiting death.</p>

<p>At least, the detective was going to visit the house, and Sir
Arnold, with the excuse that he was wanting to see how the
fisherman's hand was getting on, was driving him there.</p>

<p>Larose was still weak, and the pallor of his countenance was
evidence of the sickness he had passed through, but mentally he
was very much on the alert, and considered himself now quite well
enough to start upon the trail of the abductors of Lady
Ardane.</p>

<p>According to his usual custom, he was going to try to pick it
up where the kidnappers had last lived, for it was one of his
most profound convictions that no one could reside anywhere, if
only for a few weeks, without imposing something of his
individuality upon his habitation, and by the evidence of his
habits and mode of life that he had left behind him, suggest to a
reasoning observer something of where he might have gone, if he
had been forced to suddenly fly away.</p>

<p>At his request, Sir Arnold dropped him at the dip in the road
about a hundred and fifty yards distant from the back of the
house, and reminding him that he would be waiting for him upon
the sands, whenever he was ready to return, drove off in the
direction of Henrik's hut.</p>

<p>With an unpleasant beating of his heart, Larose walked over to
the exact spot by the hedge where he had been struck down that
night.</p>

<p>"Yes," he reflected ruefully, "it almost seems as if that
charming Sir Parry had informed them where, if I followed his
directions, I should be pushing through, and I walked into a
regular booby trap in consequence." He shook his head sadly.
"Really, Gilbert, you are a great ass sometimes."</p>

<p>He had brought some tools with him to force the lock of the
door, but to his surprise upon approaching it, found that the
door was not only unlocked, but was actually standing ajar.</p>

<p>He pushed it wide open and at once stepped into the room that
held such dreadful memories for him.</p>

<p>Then, to his annoyance, he saw that it was not unoccupied, for
a man was seated there in an armchair. The man was quite
motionless, and except that his attitude was one of profound
meditation, it might almost have been thought he was asleep.
Coming out of the bright sunlight, for the moment, the detective
could not form any idea of his face.</p>

<p>Hearing the footsteps of the detective, the man looked up
sharply and uttered a phlegmatic "Ah!" Then a deep voice came
from the depths of the armchair. "So, you've come, have you, a
week late?"&mdash;and Larose almost jumped out of his skin, for
the voice was that of the great investigator, Naughton Jones.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jones coldly, "like myself"&mdash;his voice
took a mournful tone&mdash;"you are a week too late."</p>

<p>Larose repressed the astonishment that he felt, and seating
himself down in another chair, replied quietly and as if it were
quite the natural thing that they should meet. "Yes, unhappily,
if you have only just come, Mr. Jones, we are both a week late,
but I have been ill, too, and this is the first day I have been
allowed out." Then, perceiving that Jones himself looked pale and
thin, he added quickly&mdash;"But ought you to have come here,
Mr. Jones! Ought you to have left the nursing home so soon?"</p>

<p>The great, investigator looked scornful. "Mr. Larose," he
replied in icy tones, "such men as I do not go into nursing
homes, except as a prelude to their immediate decease, and I have
paid no visit to any such place in all my life."</p>

<p>"But you said you were going into one," exclaimed Larose
looking very mystified, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I said," broke in Jones sharply, "I have
never been near one." His voice became almost angry. "When I told
you twelve days ago that I was intending to seek the seclusion of
a nursing institute, as a man of intelligence, you should have
regarded it as a polite way of my informing you that I did not
desire to be cross-examined about my future movements." He looked
very stern. "I wished it to appear to everyone that I had retired
from the case, so that with me out of the way, the rascals we
were after would be less upon their guard than if they knew I was
upon the spot." He spoke hurriedly, as if he were quite aware
that he was skating upon thin ice. "But I may tell you now, sir,
that I have never left the case, and the whole time have never
been three miles distant from the Abbey."</p>

<p>A wave of furious resentment that he had been so deceived
surged through Larose, and he was upon the point of giving speech
to his anger when something in the wan and drawn face of Jones
made him pause. The man had been ill, he was sure, and deserved
pity as much as blame. Besides, he told himself, there was
nothing to be gained by quarrelling, for Jones was a most
efficient colleague, and with all his pompous manners, was always
worth listening to.</p>

<p>So he just choked down his indignation and said very quietly.
"Then you know everything that has happened?"</p>

<p>"Everything," replied Jones majestically. "There were two
persons in the secret at the Abbey who kept me well informed.
Lady Ardane and Polkinghorne."</p>

<p>"Lady Ardane!" exclaimed Larose, "then it was you she went to
meet that night, when I caught her by the fence?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" replied Jones carelessly. He frowned. "And I was a
spectator of the scene when you laid hands upon her. I caught
sight of you just before you seized her, and it was fortunate for
you that I recognised you." He spoke very sternly. "I may tell
you, young man, that with all your escapes, you have never been
nearer death than you were at that moment. I had covered you with
my revolver and was steadying my finger upon the trigger, when
you moved and the moon shone upon your face, between the trees.
It was a near thing and&mdash;ah!" He seemed suddenly to remember
something and went on dryly. "Yes, and in my opinion you retained
her in your arms much longer than was necessary. You must have
seen who she was directly you looked under her cap, and, besides,
that scent she uses is always unmistakable."</p>

<p>Larose turned the subject at once. "But where have you been,
Mr. Jones," he asked quickly, "and what has made you look so
ill?"</p>

<p>"What has made me look so ill?" snorted Jones angrily. "Why
association with a drunken sot who leaves broken bottles about,
all round his hut, and who, when I fell over some oars that he
had left in the doorway and stunned myself and almost bled to
death from a gash that involved the radial artery, was too
intoxicated to be able to go for help for more than twelve
hours!" His voice vibrated angrily. "That, sir, is why, to-day, I
am weak and ill, notwithstanding the skill and care of a
gentleman who in his time has incised the cuticles of kings and
princes." But then suddenly his whole expression changed, and
stretching out his hands he gave a hoarse chuckle and croaked,
"Bacco, bacco, me not mooch Inglish."</p>

<p>Larose gasped incredulously. "Mr. Jones!" he exclaimed, "then
you have been Henrik! and all along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," replied Jones testily. "Thank
heaven, I am not that beast. There have been two Henriks, I may
inform you, and I have passed as the real Henrik only when it was
necessary. My suspicions were aroused about these men here and I
started to watch them. Fortunately, I happen to speak Danish, and
continual and copious supplies of rum succeeded in buying Henrik,
body and soul." He shrugged his shoulders resignedly. "So, for an
unpleasant period of time, I shared with him, his hut, his
vermin, and in order that our effluvias might not differ too
greatly, a certain portion of his rum."</p>

<p>"Then it was you who saved my life here!" said Larose
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," snapped Jones, looking intensely
disagreeable, "and I may tell you, sir, that I was not too
pleased to have to do it, for it upset all my plans."</p>

<p>His icy tones and haughty air completely cut short the
expressions of gratitude that were rising to the detective's
lips, and for the moment he felt like a child who had been
slapped in the face.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jones carelessly, and as if the matter were of
small account, "when I saw that they had got you and gathered,
from my position under the window, something of what their
intentions were, I went and kindled some straw under the
breakwater yonder, feeling sure that the light would bring them
out." He lit a cigarette. "It might interest you&mdash;they must
have thought you had somehow managed to effect your own
deliverance, for they searched over a wide area of ground around
the house, before they became really apprehensive and finally
bolted with great haste away."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you shoot them, Mr. Jones?" asked Larose
sharply. "You have just mentioned that you possess a
revolver."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones smiled sarcastically. "Because, Mr. Larose," he
replied, "I have a greater regard for the sanctity of human life
than you have and do not shoot indiscriminately. Also," he added
as an afterthought, "that drunken brute had been playing with my
revolver and emptied the cartridges out of it, where I could not
find them in the dark." He shook his head. "It was a near shave
for me, too, and I had to hide under the heaps of sacks that
constitute Henrik's bed for longer than an hour." He sighed. "In
consequence I am still inconvenienced by the insect bites that I
received during my sojourn there."</p>

<p>Larose looked very puzzled. "But it was Henrik who sold the
fish to Lady Ardane that afternoon," he said, "and whose hand Sir
Arnold bound up!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" replied Jones.</p>

<p>"Henrik sold the fish and went into his hut to get the bag to
put them in, but it was I who brought them out."</p>

<p>"And you warned me against the airman," frowned Larose. "How
do you know he had been smuggling dope?"</p>

<p>"Because Henrik recognised him," replied Jones. "Daller was
flying over here one night a couple of months or so ago, and had
trouble with his engines and had to come down upon these sands.
Then before he attempted to find out what was wrong with them, he
rushed into the sandhills and buried a number of packets beneath
the sands. Then, having very quickly rectified whatever was wrong
with his engine, he retrieved the packets in great haste and
dumped them back into his plane and flew away." The great
investigator put up his hand to suppress a yawn. "It was
therefore obvious to me that, being forced down and unaware if he
would be able to get up again, his first thought had been to
dispose of whatever he was carrying, so that in the event of any
prolonged stay, and the authorities appearing to make enquiries
about his landing in an unauthorised place, nothing of an
incriminating nature would have been found upon him."</p>

<p>"And Henrik watched all this?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, it happened to be one of the rare occasions upon which
he was sober," replied Jones, "and he was quite close among the
sand-grass all the time. He avers he saw Daller's face
distinctly, and it even struck him as peculiar that the airman
should devote quite half an hour to burying his parcels, before
attempting to remedy the trouble in his plane, which, later,
occupied only a very few minutes." Jones nodded emphatically.
"This Henrik is quite an intelligent man when sober and not half
the fool people imagine him to be."</p>

<p>"But why, Mr. Jones," asked Larose sharply, "have you kept me
in the dark about your movements all this time? You could have
been of great service, if I had only been aware that you were
here."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones flicked the ashes from his cigarette. "We are
rivals, Mr. Larose," he said coldly, "and it is always my
preference, as you are well aware, to work alone.
Besides"&mdash;and his eyes glinted sternly&mdash;"you do many
things of which I do not approve. Why, for instance, did you kill
that man they called Luke? You had disabled him already and we
might have got some information out of him if you had inflicted
no further punishment."</p>

<p>For the second time that morning Larose was inclined to tell
Jones what was in his mind, but for the second time he thought
better of it. After all, he told himself, Jones was still a sick
man, with all the irritability of a peevish sufferer. So he
patiently related all that had happened that night after Jones
had carried him away from the stone house.</p>

<p>Then he asked, "But how is it, if you have been laid up all
this time, that you knew I had shot the man?"</p>

<p>Jones elevated his eyebrows. "I had been seeing Sir Arnold,"
he replied, "at least once every day, and he, mentioning to me
where the body had been found, I was at once certain it was your
handiwork, for it was in that direction that I had started you
upon your return home." He frowned angrily. "But you know, Mr.
Larose, I am not pleased with you. You have muddled up
everything."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Jones," said Larose slowly, "I have been
unfortunate and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have been more than unfortunate," broke in Jones quickly.
"You have shown poor judgment as well. Firstly, you seriously
inconvenienced me, when that afternoon you were out here in the
sandhills when that car arrived. I had been waiting for it for a
week, and you took so long over it in the shed, that a bare five
minutes was left for me, and I had no time to see all I wanted."
He nodded. "Of course, it was you who took off those valve-cap
covers! I thought so. Well, it was most unwise, for, from the
absence of mud upon the valve-caps, if he had happened to look,
the man would have seen that the covers had only just been taken
off and then naturally"&mdash;he scowled&mdash;"he would at once
have suspected me."</p>

<p>"But I did not know you were here, Mr. Jones," began Larose,
"and you did wrong in not telling me. If I had
known&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then the second occasion," broke in Jones rudely, "when your
actions were those of a raw country policeman was when you
allowed yourself to get caught here that night. I was an eye
witness of the whole happening, and you just pushed through the
hedge, taking no thought as to who might be waiting for you on
the other side." He scoffed. "'I'm Gilbert Larose,' I suppose you
told yourself, 'and I'm quite safe, because no one can plot or
plan to do anything, except me.'"</p>

<p>The insolence of the great investigator was so studied that
Larose could hardly suppress his rage, but he had always been so
furious with himself about his carelessness that night that he
did not now trouble to argue in defence.</p>

<p>Jones went on. "And what was the result?" He shook one long
forefinger angrily. "You stampeded these men just at the very
moment when I wanted them most, for I had learned they were
keeping up a close personal contact with someone inside the
Abbey, and upon the next occasion when either of them went out at
night, I was intending to follow him and learn who the traitor
was."</p>

<p>"But how do you know they were in touch with someone in the
Abbey?" asked Larose, his curiosity now quite over-mastering his
anger.</p>

<p>Jones punctuated every word with his finger. "On the day that
you arrived, Sir Arnold advised Admiral Charters to use Ferrier's
snuff to clear up a cold in the head. Two days later the man,
Luke, was employing the identical remedy here. On the Saturday
the Abbey party had its first pheasant shoot of the season, and
the same night they were plucking pheasants in the kitchen of
this house." He snapped his fingers contemptuously. "As Henrik I
have often been in here with my fish, for, sufficiently filthy in
my person and attire, and with my artificial teeth in my pocket,
I am not unlike him in appearance."</p>

<p>"Then can it be the Admiral they have been meeting," asked
Larose incredulously, "and it was he who gave them the snuff?" He
nodded. "I caught him once, about to signal to someone with his
handkerchief, from the belfry tower."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" scoffed Jones irritably. "It's a woman he's after,
a farmer's wife not half a mile from here. He's continually
calling at her farm for glasses of milk, and he takes her
expensive boxes of chocolates. The old fool! It's the joke of the
village, and the woman only tolerates him because of his
chocolates."</p>

<p>Larose bit his lip in disgust. This Jones was like a child in
his vanity, and yet he had so often, in a few quiet words, made
him, Larose, feel as if he were a baby in arms.</p>

<p>Jones sat up straight in his chair and regarded the detective
intently. "Well, although I prefer, as I have told you, to work
alone, up to a certain point you are welcome to the benefit of
any discoveries I have made. I am quite aware that your stay at
the Abbey has not been of much profit"&mdash;he laughed
disagreeably&mdash;"except that you have learnt something of the
troubles of a breeder of Persian cats."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment and Jones went on sharply. "Now I have
learnt something about these two men who were here and you can
make of it what you will." He spoke with the assurance of a man
who never made mistakes. "Luke was a seaman, evidently, by trade.
No, no, he didn't drink rum or walk bandy-legged, and he wasn't
tattooed and he didn't smoke plug tobacco. No, nothing like that,
but I noticed that whenever he stepped out of the door, his first
thought was to look up at the sky. Seafaring men invariably do
that, even if they have been half a lifetime off the sea. It's a
habit with them, and they look up automatically to see which way
the wind is blowing. I have always noticed it. Apart from that,
too, he was always interested in ships, and a sailing barque
would keep him looking through his glasses as long as she was in
sight. The other man, he was called Prince, was of quite a
different class. He was a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Every inch of him," commented Larose sarcastically, "and you
would need no convincing of that if you had heard him discussing
the best way of putting you to death without making a mess."</p>

<p>"He had served in the war, too," continued Jones, ignoring the
interruption, "for I saw three scars, once when he was coming out
after a dip in the sea. Bullet wounds in his arm and shoulder and
a bayonet one through his thigh."</p>

<p>"More likely he was a gangster," said Larose, determined now
to disagree with Jones as much as possible, "and acquired those
injuries in a get-away after a hold-up."</p>

<p>Jones shook his head. "I don't think so," he said. "He was
particular about his person, he carried himself well and he
shaved every day. Besides, that was a bayonet wound in his thigh,
for it had gone right through and the scar was evidence of a wide
cut." His voice took on a sneering tone. "And I know of no
policeman in any country of the world who employs bayonets in
hindering get-aways after a hold-up." He screwed up his face.
"This man, Prince, too, at one time of his life had probably had
something to do with farming, for some sheep one day straying
upon the marshes, I heard him tell his companion that they were
of the Lincoln breed, big animals with long wool."</p>

<p>For the second time then within a few minutes, Larose paid a
silent tribute of admiration to the acumen of the great
investigator, for, remembering the questions that had been asked
him that night in the lane, he realised how sound the latter's
deductions now were.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Larose." said Jones, and he smiled now for the
first time, "I will admit that from the moment they were informed
that Lady Ardane had been taken, the county police have shown
themselves to be most energetic and capable, for I have had
concrete evidence from the enquiries that I made from a sick bed,
that within ten minutes of the call getting through to Norwich,
they had blocked not only every road in Norfolk, but also in the
adjoining counties as well."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose, his good humor now coming back, "the
Norwich Superintendent came to see me yesterday, and even now,
although a week has passed, no car can proceed very far upon any
main road without being bailed up and searched."</p>

<p>"And they are of opinion," suggested Jones, "that she is still
held prisoner somewhere in this neighborhood?" He screwed up his
face and asked sharply, "Is that your opinion, too, Mr.
Larose?"</p>

<p>The detective hesitated. "I am not certain," he replied. "On
the one hand, a swift car may have met that delivery van just
outside the Abbey fence and, it is possible, have got forty or
fifty miles away with the prisoners before the cordon was
set&mdash;yet on the other hand, the under-chauffeur, who
bicycled into Burnham Market, said he was speaking on the phone
there within nine minutes of the delivery van having got away,
and in Norwich, the Superintendent swears the news was being put
over the air four minutes after he received it. So thousands and
thousands of people must have been on the look out, yet no one,
in any direction, has come forward to say that he or she saw a
car passing at undue speed at that time of the day."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Jones, after a minute. "I'll admit there is
something in that. You mean, of course, that to have escaped
being caught in the meshes of the cordon when it was set, the car
must have travelled at such excessive speed that it would have
been remarked upon in many quarters."</p>

<p>He drew in a deep breath. "Well, we'll drop that side of the
problem for the moment, and discuss these gentlemen who were up
at the Abbey, and the puzzle to me at once is, that having
obtained possession of the child, they made no demand upon Lady
Ardane, but, instead, waited to get her, too." He smiled dryly.
"Now I think we can both honorably exchange confidences, and if
you have indeed made any discoveries at all during your five
days' sojourn at the Abbey, then you can tell me and I will
comment upon them." He nodded in great condescension. "But you
must certainly have found out something, to have come to this
house and got knocked out as you did. You had some reason for
being curious about these men."</p>

<p>Yet a third time was Larose upon the verge of a downright
quarrel with the half-sneering and wholly sarcastic Jones and he
thought deliciously with what interest he could pay back the
latter's rudeness, by throwing into his vanity the bomb that the
little baronet was not now a prisoner on the kidnappers'
hands.</p>

<p>But he reflected that Jones had been much longer upon the
scene than he had, and by reticence and tact he might pick up
some useful information. So he told him most of what he had
discovered at the Abbey, keeping back, however, all reference to
his visit to Sir Parry's house, the latter's housekeeper, and the
recovery of the child.</p>

<p>Jones puckered up his brows when he told him of the straight-out talk with the Abbey guests in the morning-room, and frowned
heavily when he learnt of the listening box behind the
radiator.</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" he exclaimed when the detective had finished,
"then I admit I have to a great extent misjudged you. That
discovery of how the scoundrel had been learning of Lady Ardane's
intentions was a very valuable one and really"&mdash;he smiled
quite genially now&mdash;"I ought to have thought of it myself."
He nodded. "Yes it was bad luck that you got nothing by it." He
thought for a moment. "Now tell me candidly, whom do you
suspect?"</p>

<p>The detective's reply was prompt and instant. "Sir Parry, the
Senator, Clive Huntington, and the American Rankin," he said. "I
suspect them all and cannot separate them."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Jones gleefully "so you are rehabilitating
yourself in my estimation." His eyes glowed. "I suspect them all,
too, and, as with you, I cannot separate them. Sir Parry and the
Senator, I believe, are the master minds, and Huntington and
Rankin are their jackals." He held up one warning finger. "But
wait. I would add Daller to the list."</p>

<p>Larose spoke very quietly. "Daller doesn't enter into it now,"
he said, "for last night he was found murdered in his rooms in
Wickham Chambers, Albury street. Stabbed to the heart and no
trace of his murderer to be found. The Superintendent phoned me
from Norwich this morning."</p>

<p>Jones almost jumped from his chair, and then, sinking back,
gave a long whistle. "Wheels within wheels," he muttered, "and
now we have another line of investigation to follow up. Dear me!
dear me!" he went on, "and from the moment you told me you were
of opinion Huntington and Daller were no strangers to each other,
it came to me in a lightning flash that we might get at the whole
gang through the airman. I have been making enquiries of a friend
of mine in the Customs and have learnt they have been curious
about Daller for some time. Dear me!" he repeated again, "what a
piece of bad luck."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Larose, "the Superintendent told me this morning
that for a long time they had been suspecting a great deal more
about Daller than any one thought."</p>

<p>"And your work being nearly all homicidal cases," commented
Jones sadly, "you, of course, knew nothing about it. What a pity!
What a pity!" He sighed. "But now to return to that lot who were
at the Abbey." He shook his head vexatiously. "I never did like
Sir Parry, for, with all his outward charm of manner, he looked
to me like a man who was always drugging his mind with unnatural
thoughts, and he has been by no means, too, the upright business
man of cold and severe probity that people think." He thumped
upon the side of the chair. "He was a rum-runner for one thing,
and certain vessels of the Bardell line had a most evil
reputation on the American coast. I've no doubt young Huntington
picked up his villainy there, and was hand in glove with him in
the trade."</p>

<p>The great investigator regarded Larose very shrewdly. "Now,
did you never notice anything in Sir Parry's attitude toward Lady
Ardane?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He was most devoted to her, if that's what you mean," replied
Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped Jones, "with would-be lover-like devotion,
certainly not a paternal one." He laughed scornfully. "The old
reprobate! Why, he's most likely to have been the very one to
make a nightly pilgrimage and stand upon that box to
watch"&mdash;he scowled&mdash;"but there, there&mdash;" He looked
interrogatively at Larose. "Now, you must have noticed how he
used to follow her about with his eyes."</p>

<p>Larose was annoyed at the trend the conversation was taking.
"Of course I saw it," he replied quickly, "and it is
inconceivable that with this devotion to her, he could have been
deliberately torturing her during all these weeks with the
thought that at any moment she might lose her child."</p>

<p>"That's nothing," argued Jones "for nearly everything about
this case is inconceivable, and my opinion is that both Sir Parry
and the Senator are bad eggs&mdash;but bad in a different way.
Now about the Senator. I have had enquiries made about him by my
agents in America and this is what I have found out. He is a
gambler and a reckless one at that. Last year he lost huge sums
over the failure of the Argentine wheat crop, and it was
confidently predicted he was bankrupt. But he came hurriedly over
here to see his step-daughter and huge credits were cabled at
once, and he was saved. Then his affairs at the present time are
not too good, and he has again been worrying her for money, but
this time I think he has been refused, because some weeks back he
sulked for a whole day."</p>

<p>"But how on earth do you know all this?" asked Larose. "I'm
sure Lady Ardane never told you."</p>

<p>Jones laughed. "Ah! then I have had an advantage over you," he
replied, "for Polkinghorne has been informing me of quite a lot
of things I should not otherwise of learnt. No, no," he went on,
noting the disgusted expression upon Larose's face, "don't run
away with the idea that Polkinghorne is a traitor, for he is not.
He would do anything in the world for his mistress, and on that
account he thought it his duty to tell me. I may add that I have
known Polkinghorne for some years. He is an old client of mine,
and came to me once in great trouble when one of his cats had
been stolen. I was the means of restoring the animal to him, for
I found the thief among the domestic staff. But to return to the
Senator. A month back he tried to borrow from Sir Parry, but met
with a rebuff, there, too, for Polkinghorne heard Sir Parry
saying he was sorry, but all his money was tied up. Then he took
to chaffing Sir Parry about his age, before Lady Ardane, and
their relations were strained until a couple of weeks ago, when
all at once they became quite friendly again, and the Senator has
been almost deferential to Sir Parry ever since." He drew in a
deep breath. "Now, what do you think of it all?"</p>

<p>The detective was silent for a moment. "But where does this
man Rankin come in," he asked, "for if the Senator is in it,
Rankin is in it too, for they are thick as thieves together, and
it was the Senator who prevented my searching his room."</p>

<p>"Bah!" scoffed Jones, "he is a crook for sure, and Rankin is
not his name." He frowned and carved the air again with his long
forefinger. "I can't place that man, and yet I am sure I have
seen his face in an American newspaper somewhere, in connection
with a prosecution of certain members of a gang." He rose from
his chair and began pacing up and down the room. "But the chief
thing that puzzles me is, why they wanted Lady Ardane as well as
the child? Either would have answered their purpose equally well
for demanding ransom!"</p>

<p>"When did you last see Lady Ardane?" asked Larose evading the
question.</p>

<p>"The night after the day they tried to shoot you," replied
Jones, "Ah!" he nodded quickly, "and that precious Rankin did
that. Polkinghorne says he ran up to the Senator and whispered
something directly he came in, and old Harvey looked as glum as
if he were going to be shot himself. Polkinghorne, too, heard him
distinctly mention the word 'macintosh.'"</p>

<p>He sank down into his chair again. "Well, to sum the whole
matter up, Sir Parry and the Senator are under strong suspicion,
and they are probably working in collaboration with the idea,
perhaps, that Harvey is to receive a huge sum of money if her
ladyship can be induced by threats or otherwise to marry Sir
Parry. That's all I can make out of it, at any rate." A thought
struck him and he asked sharply. "What's Senator Harvey doing
now?"</p>

<p>"Making a house-to-house search of every likely habitation
within a radius of twenty miles," replied Larose grimly. "Rankin
is helping him, and two plain-clothes men from Norwich have been
detailed to accompany them."</p>

<p>"Really! Really!" scoffed Jones, "and it will be a nice little
picnic for them all together." He nodded solemnly. "I have myself
two very capable helpers coming down to meet me here today. Both
old hands. One's just out, after seven years, and the other is
referred to in police circles as an habitual offender. He is a
shining light in the underworld, this chap, but was a prize-fighter in old days, and well known as The Limehouse Bruiser. His
name is Bloggs. I saw him once give Stammering Jack, the
Yorkshire champion, a glorious knock-out in the tenth round." He
rubbed his hands together. "A very useful man, I assure you, to
have in a tight corner."</p>

<p>"Ah! one thing more," he exclaimed as Larose was getting up to
go round the house, "I don't understand this." He spoke very
slowly. "If Sir Parry is in it up to the neck, as we both
believe, why did they go through the farce of kidnapping him as
well? The riding away of two persons, instead of one, would
certainly not make it easier for them!"</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if Sir Parry acted as a decoy," replied
Larose, "and drew Lady Ardane far enough away from the house so
that they could get hold of her before help could arrive."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," said Jones instantly, "but that doesn't
explain why they took him. I understand, too, that he received
rough usage from them and was actually knocked down."</p>

<p>"He didn't actually fall," said Larose, "for another man
caught him just as he was going down." He shook his head. "It's
quite possible it may have been all play-acting, but still with
you I understand why he was taken." He turned to the door. "Well,
now I think we've talked over everything, and so I'll just be
casting an eye round and see what I can pick up."</p>

<p>"You won't learn much," remarked Jones with a cold smile, "for
I've been everywhere and drawn almost blank. Second-hand
furniture, every bit; mattresses and pillow, new, but tags of
place of origin all torn off. Cooking utensils new, likewise the
few knives and forks. Lived a lot on tinned stuff, but all of
quite good quality. Plenty of newspapers about, but every one a
London one. A few books that are moderately suggestive and an
expensive fountain pen, practically new. They left in a great
hurry and burnt three or four newspapers in the fire, but can
pick out no bits, the burning having been carefully done.
Apparently had everything ready for quick flight at any time,
and, to my thinking, they were anticipating going off very
closely about when they did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Larose. "They couldn't have foreseen
what was going to happen here, that I should be coming that
night."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Jones, "but you remember I told you they
were plucking the pheasant upon the same night of the shoot, when
it had only been killed a few hours! Well, would a man like this
Prince, who is most particular about his food, have been
intending to cook the bird straightaway if he knew he could have
hung it for a few days? Certainly not. Therefore, he was
expecting to clear off any time, and intended to enjoy the
pheasant as best he could." He waved his arm round the room. "But
get on with your investigations, please, for I want to be left
alone to think."</p>

<p>The detective suppressed a smile, and, leaving Jones to his
meditations, proceeded to go minutely over the house, soon,
however, coming to the conclusion that Jones' terse epitome of
its contents was quite correct. The soiled and scanty furniture
was impressed with many personalities and nothing was to be
learned there. As Jones had said, too, the men certainly lived
well, for the emptied tins in the rubbish tip had all contained
food of good quality, the best salmon and most expensive
sardines. Also he had noticed some empty bottles of vintage
burgundy, all half ones, however, with the labels, 'Chambertin,
1904.'</p>

<p>"And only one wineglass among those tumblers on the chimney-piece," he murmured. "Yes, the two men were of quite different
class and entirely different in their tastes, too. One apparently
drank beer and smoked the filthy pipe that he left on the floor
by his bed, and the other smoked Abdullah cigarettes and enjoyed
a vintage wine."</p>

<p>Returning to the living room he thoughtfully regarded the
books and magazines upon the table, that he had already once gone
through, noting out of the tail of his eye that Jones was now
regarding him intently. A number of cheap paper novels of the
detective and adventurous kind, some current monthly magazines, a
copy of the British Medical Journal, dated September 4th, and two
historical and scientific works. H. G. Wells's 'The Outline of
History' and Haldane's 'The Inequality of Man,' both evidently
quite recent purchases, and each showing upon their covers where
the bookseller's label had been torn off.</p>

<p>He picked up the British Medical Journal. There was a big
oily-looking smear upon the cover and he gave it a hard sniff.
Then, re-seating himself, he began turning over the pages, to try
and make out what possible interest it could have been to the two
men who had been living there. The titles of the papers and
articles, he thought, did not certainly seem too interesting.
'Duodenal Ulcer,' he read, 'The Deficiency Anaemias of
Childhood,' 'Measles,' 'Anuerism of the Aorta,' and then he came
to a well-thumbed page with a heading upon it, 'Basal
Narcotics.'</p>

<p>"Ah! that's it," he thought instantly. "I told Sir Arnold that
the criminal of to-day was scientific."</p>

<p>He read quickly through the article, and came upon the names
of many drugs that he had never heard of, Avertin, Nembutal,
Sodium Amytal, etc., and finally Sodium Evipan, faintly
underlined in pencil. He turned over the other pages and paused
for a few seconds when upon one of them he came to an erasure in
ink. Under the title of a short article, 'An Unusual Case of Hay-fever,' was the name of E B. Smith, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., and the
letter B, in the initials had been run through and over it had
been put the letter D.</p>

<p>He was turning to the following page when suddenly the hum of
a car was heard outside, and Jones jumped quickly to his feet and
peered out of the window.</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo!" he exclaimed "someone's pulling up here, and
by Jupiter, I do believe it's that Huntington. Yes, it is. Quick,
back to our seats and he'll be inside before he knows that we are
here. But what the deuce can he want?"</p>

<p>Satisfying himself with one quick look that it was indeed Sir
Parry's friend, Larose dropped back into his chair, and the two
waited in silence for Huntington to come in.</p>

<p>But he did not come in at once.</p>

<p>They heard his footsteps right up to the door, and they
stopped abruptly and quite half a minute passed, as if, finding
the door ajar, he was uncertain what to do. Then, apparently
realising that if anyone were in the house, he must have heard
him outside, he tapped sharply with his knuckles upon the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in," called out Jones, making a quick sign to the
detective not to speak, "Come in."</p>

<p>The door was at once pushed wide open, and Clive Huntington,
with his hat in his hand and a most pleasant smile upon his lips,
stepped into the room. For the moment he did not see Naughton
Jones, but his eyes falling at once upon Larose, who was sitting
directly in the light, his face dropped sharply. But it was only
for an instant, and then he was all smiles again.</p>

<p>"Now, I do hope you have got over your illness, Mr. Larose,"
he said with the utmost politeness. "We were all very concerned
when we heard you were laid up."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," replied the detective, smiling back and
determined to keep up the farce. "I'm quite all right again, but
I got a nice crack over the head here, about a week ago, and now
I'm well enough, I've come back to see if the gentleman who gave
it me has left his name and address."</p>

<p>He thought suddenly of a way of getting a rise out of Naughton
Jones, and made a motion of his hand in the latter's direction.
"But let me introduce you to my friend, Dr. Wisefellow, of Saint
Bartholomew's, London. Doctor, this is Mr. Clive Huntington, who
was staying with us in the Abbey, up to a few days ago."</p>

<p>Jones bowed gravely, and the imp of mischief stirring in
Larose, he went on, "But it's no good, I am afraid, Mr.
Huntington, asking my friend for a prescription, because,
although he's in mufti, he's a doctor of divinity and not one of
medicine."</p>

<p>"Just so, just so," commented Jones solemnly, and at the same
time looking rather annoyed. "A minister of the soul and not of
the body, and as my parish includes the Newgate Prison, I have
plenty of work to do." He nodded in the direction of Larose. "But
it is pleasing sometimes to be off duty and able to advise my
young friend here in his work." He shook his head sadly. "He
makes bad mistakes sometimes."</p>

<p>Young Huntington looked highly delighted. "Yes, he does, sir,"
he exclaimed, "for only a few days ago he was accusing me, among
some others, happily, of having made an attempt upon his
life."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" commented Jones. "That's nothing. He's always
thinking people must be coming after him now he's such a famous
man."</p>

<p>Larose smiled a sickly smile, at the same time making a mental
note that he would not again attempt to make fun of Jones in
public, for the fellow had a nasty way of hitting back.</p>

<p>Jones was now looking in a most friendly fashion at their
visitor. "Sit down, sir," he said pointing to a chair near the
chimney-piece, "don't stand on ceremony," and Huntington, after a
moment's hesitation, complied.</p>

<p>Then Larose, some of his pleasantness having passed, looked
intently at Huntington and demanded rather sharply, "And what are
you wanting here, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>The young man looked unhappy, and shrugged his shoulders.
"What we are all wanting, Mr. Larose," he replied gravely, "some
news of my benefactor and Lady Ardane." He raised his voice
dramatically. "The Abbey draws me like a magnet and I cannot keep
away. I am not rejoining my ship for a little time, and so I came
down here again. Then, passing along the high road, I thought I
would get a glimpse of the sea, and imagine my surprise then,
when I saw Sir Arnold's car upon the sands. Then, seeing the door
open, I half thought he might be in here, so came to have a
little chat with him." He smiled his pleasant smile again. "So
very simple and yet such a marvelous coincidence that I should
meet you again!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly Naughton Jones plucked a little spirit flask
from his pocket and put his hand over his heart.</p>

<p>"I feel faint," he said weakly. He pointed to a glass upon the
chimney piece, just above where Huntington was sitting. "Be so
kind, will you, sir," he went on shakily, "and hand me that glass
there. Ah, thank you so much. I'm getting old and liable to these
attacks."</p>

<p>He tipped a generous tablespoonful of the spirit into the
tumbler that had been handed him and sipped at it with evident
benefit, for at once his voice grew stronger. "Yes, Sir Arnold is
down here, and I expect you'll find him in Henrik's hut. I know
he was coming to see the fellow this morning." He put his hand
upon his heart again. "But, if you don't mind, I think you had
better leave me, for I'm always better when left alone."</p>

<p>Huntington rose up with alacrity, as if he were pleased to
escape any further questioning. "Well, I hope you'll soon be
better, sir," he said. "I am sorry to leave you, but I'm rather
in a hurry too," and then, waving his hand to Larose as if they
were on the best of terms, he passed out of the room, and they
heard his steps upon the garden path and then the starting up of
his car.</p>

<p>Jones, with all signs of his sudden indisposition having
disappeared, sprang to the window, still, however, retaining the
tumbler in his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's gone," he exclaimed gleefully, "and I've got his
fingerprints here." His breath came in quick gasps. "Do you know,
Mr. Larose, a sudden inspiration has come into my head. I won't
tell you all now, but one part of it is that that young fellow
who has just gone out is a blood relation of the man Prince, who
has those pleasant manners, too. They have both that pretty
curling hair, their foreheads are of the same shape, and when
they smile, they arch their eyebrows in exactly the same way.
Also, their voices are not dissimilar." His eyes twinkled in
amusement. "I feel much, much better now, and whilst he's having
that little chat with Sir Arnold, we'll go over and have a good
look at his car."</p>

<p>But they got no chance of looking at his car, for, passing out
of the house, they saw, to their disgust, that, making no attempt
to find Sir Arnold, Huntington had turned his car round and now,
at a lightning pace, was shooting back along the road he had
come.</p>

<p>"No good! no good!" exclaimed Jones ruefully. "We frightened
him and he made sure to give us no chance. Still one thing, we
are certain now that he is in with them." He smiled sourly at the
detective. "I enjoyed your little pleasantry, but, in other
circumstances, it might have been unwise." He drew himself up
proudly. "Still, upon this occasion, it doesn't matter, for
directly he gives them my description, they'll all know at once
to whom he has been talking."</p>

<p>Larose felt altogether too disgusted to make any comment, for
he saw, now that Jones had mentioned it, the resemblance between
Huntington and the man Prince. He was furious with himself, too,
in the remembrance that several times whilst at the Abbey, he had
been thinking that there was something familiar in Huntington's
voice, and yet, putting it all down to imagination, he had never
troubled to harass his mind as to where he had heard the tones
before. Yet another thing&mdash;it was unpardonable that he had
not himself obtained Huntington's finger-prints when the latter
had been at the Abbey. He had thought about it once, but he had
not considered it necessary, for there was nothing of the jail-bird about young Huntington, and his youth and bearing were all
against his having served any time in a prison. Yes, he ought to
have obtained them, although even now he was certain there would
be no record of them with the authorities.</p>

<p>They returned disconsolately to the house, and then Jones said
quickly, "Now, he came here to fetch something; that's certain.
Something they left behind, probably of no value, but something
that, after all these days, they suddenly came to think might put
us on the trail if we found it." He looked round the room. "Now
what can it be? You have been through everything and so have I."
He shook his head frowningly. "Never mind, I shall think of it
presently. I am an old dog for the trail, and for me the scent is
never cold. Come on, we'll go through everything again."</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>

THE ART OF LAROSE</h2>

<p class="first">AN hour later, having bidden goodbye to Naughton
Jones, who, however, did not take the slightest notice and
remained sitting back in the armchair with his eyes closed as if
he had fallen asleep, Larose was again seated in Sir Arnold's car
and being driven back to the Abbey.</p>

<p>"I did not intrude upon you," said the surgeon, "for Henrik
told me Mr. Jones was in there, too." He smiled. "Our learned
friend I know is very temperamental, and if I had disturbed him,
without being sent for, it is quite probable I might have only
received a snub for my pains. A very remarkable man, Mr. Jones,
but he's most touchy sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he's not in too good a mood this morning," said
Larose, "but he's quite a genius in his way, and his kind often
want a lot of handling."</p>

<p>"So we found," commented Sir Arnold dryly. "He was nearly dead
that morning when I got him into the Cottage Hospital in Burnham
Market, but within a few hours he was laying down the law as if I
were the patient and he the medical man. In a couple of days,
too, his room had become almost like a post office, with the
number of telegrams that he was sending and receiving."</p>

<p>"One of the big arteries was severed, wasn't it?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>Sir Arnold smiled again. "Well, hardly," he replied, "but I
had to exaggerate his injury in order to keep him quiet. He was
furious that I wouldn't allow him to get up the next day, and
demanded stout and oysters to pick up his strength."</p>

<p>They had almost reached the bitumen when suddenly a
dilapidated-looking car turned into the marsh road and pulled up,
almost blocking the narrow way. A burly-looking man sprang out
and held up his hand for them to stop.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed the surgeon quietly, "but this gentleman
doesn't look too prepossessing, and in these days of violence and
abduction, we'd better be a little careful."</p>

<p>"Oh! it's all right," replied Larose quickly. "I guess who he
is. I recognise that car. It's a four-cylinder Goat and belongs
to Naughton Jones."</p>

<p>The man advanced to speak to them, and, as Sir Arnold had
said, his appearance was certainly not of a reassuring nature. He
was big and thick set, with a big square head and small,
blinking, pugnacious-looking eyes. His ears were thick and large
and stood out, almost at right angles.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, gentlemen," he said touching his cap, "but is
this the road for Holkham Bay?"</p>

<p>Larose repressed a smile. "Yes," he replied, "but what do you
want there? There's not much to see."</p>

<p>The man jerked his thumb back in the direction of the car.
"But me and my mate are going to do a bit of shrimping."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't get any," said Larose, "for it's high
tide."</p>

<p>"We'll have a go, anyhow," said the man gruffly. '"We got the
nets," and he turned to go back to his car.</p>

<p>"One moment," called out Larose, putting his head out of the
window. "Are you by any chance the gentleman who is looking for
Mr. Naughton Jones!"</p>

<p>The man's eyes twinkled suspiciously. "Jones! Jones!" he
exclaimed, "never heard of him."</p>

<p>But the face of Larose suddenly assumed a startled look. "Good
gracious!" he called out, "but aren't you 'The Limehouse Bruiser'
who once knocked out Stammering Jack in the tenth round? Great
James! I'm sure you are. I remember you distinctly."</p>

<p>The man's face became at once a study, with pride and
suspicion struggling for the mastery. He blinked his eyes
violently, he smiled and he swallowed hard several times. Then he
beamed all over. "Yes, guv'nor. You've placed me. I got him
square on the jaw."</p>

<p>Larose laughed merrily. "It's all right, my friend, quite all
right, and you'll find Mr. Jones up there, waiting for you both.
I've just come from him and he told me he was expecting you. I
know all about you."</p>

<p>The man touched his cap once more and grinned. "Beg pardon,
sir, again," he said, "but you see we has to be careful, and it
was no good us throwing our names about, was it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Larose, "you were most discreet. Now,
you go up along this road and it's the only house you come to, on
the right. You'll find the door open and Mr. Jones inside." He
laughed again. "You tell him Mr. Larose directed you. Remember
the name, Mr. Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The man's jaw dropped. "Larose!" he ejaculated, "not the
'tec!"</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled Larose, "but don't worry. I'm not after you, and
I wish both you and your pal good luck. Good-bye and hurry up,
for you know Mr. Jones never likes to be kept waiting."</p>

<p>"Quite an amusing little comedy," remarked Sir Arnold as they
speeded along, "and it was funny to watch the man's face." He
smiled. "All you great men seem to like to make yourselves known
to one another."</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled back Larose, "but it wasn't exactly vanity on my
part, this time. Jones says he and I are rivals, and I wanted to
pull his leg and let him know I should recognise his assistants
now, when I see them." He changed the conversation. "But tell me,
doctor, what is Sodium Evipan used for?"</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful new anaesthetic," replied Sir Arnold, "and
we expect great things from it. You don't inhale it like you do
chloroform or ether, but it is injected into you with a
hypodermic syringe, and you go off almost at once into profound
unconsciousness. It is very rapid in its action and the
unconsciousness lasts for from ten minutes to a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p>"Then you go off quicker than when you are given ether or
chloroform?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, yes," replied Sir Arnold. "You don't know
what's happening after about a minute." He looked curiously at
the detective. "But what are your plans now, Mr. Larose? Remember
you are not too strong yet and must go easy for a few days."</p>

<p>"I'm hiring a car from Hunstanton," replied Larose, "and with
two good private-clothes men who are coming from Norwich to help
me, am starting off about one o'clock. I have no idea yet in
which direction I am going, but with any luck"&mdash;he gritted
his teeth together&mdash;"I'll be hot on the trail of those
devils within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Then you found something just now in that house that may help
you?" asked Sir Arnold eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, several things, I think," nodded Larose, "but I shan't
know what they are worth for a few hours."</p>

<p>The surgeon looked very astonished. "And do you really mean to
tell me," he asked, "that you have any hope of finding where Lady
Ardane is being held prisoner, say, within a week from now?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly, yes," replied Larose, "and perhaps within
half that time. That's my trade, Sir Arnold"&mdash;he
frowned&mdash;"and if I know anything of Naughton Jones, it'll be
a close thing between us, who finds where she is first."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait on at the Abbey," said Sir Arnold. "I was
intending to return to London to-night, but as you seem so
confident, I'll remain on for a few days." He shook his head.
"But you'll have to be a quick mover, my friend, for those
wretches have had a long start."</p>

<p>And certainly Larose was a quick mover, for before half-past
one he came out of the Hunstanton Public Library and proceeded at
once to give some very definite instructions to two men who were
standing by a motor bicycle and side-car outfit.</p>

<p>"It's at Cambridge you'll have to ring me," he said sharply,
"at the Bull Hotel, there. Ring up at nine, and if you don't get
me then, ring up at every succeeding half-hour until you catch
me. Now you know what you've got to do. It's very simple. You are
to keep to the main road and enquire at every garage, beginning
at those in this town, if, since Monday week last, they have sold
to any driver of a six cylinder grey-colored Jehu, two valve cap
covers. The tyres he had lost them from were the off-side back
one, and the one on the spare wheel, but you needn't make any
account of that. You want to know anyone with a Jehu who has
purchased two valve-cap covers. If any garage can inform you, you
are not to approach the man who has bought them, but tactfully
find out all you can about him. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied one of the men, "if we locate him, we are
to do nothing until we have spoken to you."</p>

<p>"And if the garages can't tell you," went on Larose, "get a
list from them of all their clients who possess grey Jehu cars."
He made a grimace. "Unhappily grey Jehus are pretty plentiful,
and there are a lot about, but the driver you want to know about
is a fairly tall man who stoops a bit, over six feet I should
say, has a long face with a biggish nose, and he sometimes wears
a cap with car flaps tied under his chin. The two back tyres on
his car are nearly new ones, and so were probably both bought at
the same time, so you are to ask everywhere if they have any
record of two such tyres being sold recently. Now is everything
quite clear!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man who had spoken before, "and the number
plates of his car are V.F. 2113."</p>

<p>"But you can't count on that, Hale," said Larose sharply,
"for, as I have told you, that number does not belong to him, and
he may have others that he makes use of as well. I can't tell you
anything more, except that the first part of his journey from
where he had set out to come to Holkham Bay was a muddy one, for
scraping at the mud under the car that day, there was first the
little mud from the marsh crossing, then a hard layer that had
evidently become dried from coming a good few miles over the
bitumen, and then underneath that, much moister mud again. Ah!
one thing more, I noticed three dried dragon-flies stuck in the
combs of his radiator, so he probably comes from where there is
swampy ground." He waved his hand. "Now off you go and good luck
to us all."</p>

<p>The detective was in quite a cheerful frame of mind as he
drove along towards King's Lynn. "A glorious day," he told
himself, "and I've a lovely drive before me. I shall pass through
these beautiful little English villages and through these quaint,
old-fashioned market towns. I shall touch the lonely Fen country,
once all marsh and swamp and where the great Hereward the Wake
fought so valiantly that the soil of England should not pass
under the Norman yoke. Then I shall come to the wonderful
cathedral city of Ely, and finally I shall reach Cambridge, with
its old world colleges and churches, hundreds and hundreds of
years old."</p>

<p>He sighed. "But I'm not going all this way to see the
beautiful countryside or the wonder of man's craft down the ages.
I'm on a much more prosaic mission." His face hardened and took a
solemn look. "I am wanting to get upon the track of these
wretches whose trade is murder and violence, and probably law-breaking of other kinds. It's a gang we're after, too, I'm sure,
and although I am taking this long journey to Cambridge, I don't
for a moment believe they have their hiding place within many
miles of there. When I went over that Jehu car, the petrol that
had been used, assuming even that the tank had been full when the
journey started, couldn't have taken it a yard over fifty miles,
and Jones agreed with me, too."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, they don't live anywhere near
Cambridge, but all the same, with any luck, I'm going to pick up
the trail there, and by to-morrow I shall probably be back, close
here again. There were quite a number of things that struck me in
that house, but that one in the Medical Journal was, I am sure,
the most important."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and at once proceeded to reduce his
speed. "No, I've plenty of time, for the gentleman I am going to
interview in Cambridge is not likely to be home much before his
dinner hour, and I've only seventy-five miles to go." He drew a
deep breath. "Now, let me reason it all over again and see if
there's anything glaringly wrong with my argument. A Dr. R.D.
Smith, of King's Parade, Cambridge, writes what is probably an
intelligent and illuminative article on 'Hay Fever,' and it duly
appears in the official organ of his profession. Naturally then,
he expects to derive some credit from it, not only from his
professional brethren, but also from certain of his patients as
well. So imagine his disgust, when, with his name a very common
one, the journal gives him a wrong initial and prints 'R.B.'
instead of 'R.D.' Hay fever is not a rare complaint by any means,
and several of his patients having probably suffered from it, it
is quite natural he would like them to read his article. But he
couldn't lend it to them with the initials all wrong, so before
doing so, he rectifies the mistake and with his pen puts a D.
instead of the B."</p>

<p>He paused for quite a long time to go back over his deductions
and weigh up whether they seemed feasible or far fetched. At
length he went on. "Then assuming that it is Dr. Smith himself
who has rectified the mistake in his own copy of the
journal&mdash;and by no stretch of the imagination can I conceive
of anyone else taking the trouble to do it&mdash;all I have to
find out is to whom he lent the journal, and in that way I ought
to soon get at this man Prince." He shook his head. "But if it
were not for the altering of that initial my whole theory would
fall to the ground, for undoubtedly this issue of the journal was
in the possession of these men, not because of that article on
'Hay Fever'&mdash;but because of that one on 'Narcotics.' The
page there was well thumbed and 'Sodium Evipan' had been
underlined." He shook his head again. "Yes, they might have
bought a copy of the journal for themselves."</p>

<p>His face brightened. "But no, I am not altogether coming to
Cambridge because of this medical journal, for I was intending to
go there in any case. Those sandwiches that I found in the car
were made of pate-de-foie-gras, and that was a good brown sherry
in the pocket flask, and I thought of some big cities at once
when I saw them. Those sorts of things are not to be bought in
little country towns, and so Norwich and Cambridge leapt
instantly into my mind, for they are the nearest places where
they could be obtained. It was the same, too, this morning,
directly I saw that expensive burgundy had been drunk. Shopping
in a big city somewhere, where all kinds of expensive luxuries
are on sale."</p>

<p>He pressed down upon the accelerator. "Yes, upon second
thoughts, I'd better hurry up a bit, so that if the doctor isn't
at home, I can go the round of the wine merchants at once."</p>

<p>He arrived at Cambridge a little after four, and learning that
the doctor was out and that his evening surgery hours were from
seven to nine, gave his card to the maid who had answered the
door, and asked her to inform her master that he would be much
obliged if he could spare him a few minutes just before seven. He
was not coming as a patient, he said, and would return at ten
minutes before the hour. The girl regarded the card with very
curious eyes and replied that she thought the arrangement would
be quite all right.</p>

<p>Then he inquired of a postman whom he met which was the best
firm of wine merchants in the city, and was directed to one in
Sydney street. Asking to see the chief one in authority there, he
was shown into the manager's office, and producing his card, was
at once treated with the utmost respect.</p>

<p>"What I want to know, sir," he said, "is whether you have made
a sale, lately, of any pint bottles of Chambertin 1904,
accompanied perhaps at the same time by some bottles of brown
sherry, and if you have done so, to whom you sold the wine."</p>

<p>The manager smiled. "Happily, sir," he replied, "we have a
good connection and are very often disposing of the wines you
mention. Now, can you give me any approximate date?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I can't," replied Larose, "but I am very
interested in an unknown party, a tall man, with a rather long
face and big nose, who has been purchasing these wines, and I
want to find out who he is."</p>

<p>The manager pursed up his lips and looked very doubtful. "I
may be able to give you the names of a score of persons who have
bought them," he said, "and yet"&mdash;he looked more
hopeful&mdash;"if this party you want bought the two wines at the
same time, I may perhaps be able to help you, and particularly
so, as you say the burgundy was in pint bottles. The still
vintage wines are nearly always preferred in quarts." He rose up
from his chair. "I'll go and look through our sales books."</p>

<p>He left the room and was absent for quite a quarter of an
hour. Then he returned with a big ledger under his arm. "You are
lucky," he smiled, "I can give you the exact date." He pointed to
a page in the book. "See, on September 9 we sold a case of
Chambertin pints and six bottles of brown sherry and a bottle of
1906 brandy, all to the same person."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked the detective eagerly, thrilled to the
core that he had hit the bull's-eye with the first shot. His
hopes, however, were immediately dashed to zero when the manager
replied, "Ah! there I'm afraid my services end, for the sale was
a cash one, and in consequence there is no name of the purchaser
recorded in our book."</p>

<p>"And there is no possibility of finding out?" asked Larose
with a choke in his voice.</p>

<p>"None whatever," replied the manager. "Ah! wait a moment. Our
cellar man may know something about him, for he will have
delivered the wine." He touched a bell upon his desk and a clerk
immediately appeared. "Send William to me," he said.</p>

<p>A minute or two later a stout, heavy man in a big leather
apron appeared, and the manager put the question to him as to
whether he remembered the sale.</p>

<p>The man thought for a moment and then nodded his head. "Yes,
sir, I do," he said. "I carried everything out to a car, and
packed it in for the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked the manager. "Do you know?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was quite a stranger to me." The man smiled. "But
he gave me a shilling and was very particular how the Chambertin
was put in the car and asked me how long he ought to let it rest
after he'd got it home. He said it was going to have a good
shaking, for he'd be travelling nearly forty miles."</p>

<p>"What was the car like?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Couldn't tell you, sir," was the reply, "except that there
was a lot of mud about, because I remember having to clean up my
apron afterwards."</p>

<p>That was all the information the detective could extract, and
then, proceeding to the Bull Hotel, he put in a good hour
studying a big ordnance map that he had purchased in
Hunstanton.</p>

<p>At a quarter to seven he presented himself at the doctor's
house, and was at once shown into the surgery, where the doctor
himself was seated at his desk. The doctor was a round-faced,
plump little man, beaming good humor and good nature, and with a
merry twinkle in his eye. He looked about fifty-five years of
age.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you found out about me, sir?" he asked at
once, wagging his finger playfully at the detective. "Oh! yes,
I've heard about you, Mr. Larose, and know your favorite hobby is
murder work." He pretended to look very frightened. "But in my
case I can inform you straightaway that you'll need a perfect
host of exhumation orders to secure any conviction, for everyone
for whose death I am responsible is well buried under the
ground."</p>

<p>Larose smiled back. "It's not quite as bad as that yet,
doctor," he replied, "and so far we've not had too many
complaints about you up at the Yard. I've come about that article
of yours on 'Hay Fever' that was published in the issue of the
'British Medical Journal' of September 4."</p>

<p>"But that's not a crime!" exclaimed the doctor instantly. "An
indiscretion, if you like, but certainly no indictable offence!"
His face sobered down. "But what do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Now have you got a copy of the journal, with your article in
it?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the reply, and the doctor at once reached
forward and picked one off the desk. "Here you are and there is
the offending article." The hopes of Larose dropped again, but he
was in part reassured, when he saw the initial had been corrected
as before. "But is this the original copy that was sent you," he
asked, "for, of course, I presume you are a member of the British
Medical Association and receive one every week."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. "Yes, I am," he said, and then he added,
looking very surprised, "no, this is not the copy that was sent
me. Someone stole that from my waiting-room and I had to buy
another."</p>

<p>Larose put his hand in the breast pocket of his coat, and
plucking out the journal he had brought with him, handed it
dramatically across to the doctor.</p>

<p>"Then is this your original copy?" he asked, and he saw the
doctor's jaw drop, and his brows contract, as his eyes fell upon
the correction under the title of his article.</p>

<p>"My oath, it is!" he gasped, "but how the very devil did it
come into your hands, and bring you all this way to question
me?"</p>

<p>"The position, Doctor, is like this," replied Larose. "We are
after some very bad men, and we should have got them about a week
back up Hunstanton way if they had not suddenly become aware that
we had located them&mdash;and bolted away. Well, in the house
they had been living in, we came across this journal, and
thinking it must be yours, I have come over eighty miles to-day
to speak to you."</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!" exclaimed the doctor, "but there is no
doubt this is the journal that was stolen from me." He leant back
in his chair and reflected. "Now let me see. The journal is
published on the Saturday and I always get it on the Monday." He
spoke very slowly. "Then it was probably on the Wednesday that I
put it on the waiting room table, and on the Friday when I went
to look for it, it had gone. One of the patients must have taken
it."</p>

<p>"Well, can you remember among your patients a tall man, with a
long face and rather big nose," asked Larose, "who was probably
suffering from some form of chest trouble about that time?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head slowly and then smiled. "I see from
sixty to seventy people a day sometimes, and I can't remember
them all. No, I have no recollection of any such man."</p>

<p>"But you are quite correct as to the date, doctor," said
Larose. "The journal was taken on the Thursday, for on that day,
September 9, we have found out that this man, one of those we are
wanting, was in Cambridge. Now, can you show me a list of the
patients, with their addresses, who consulted you that day, most
probably in your afternoon surgery, because I have reason to
believe the man is not a local man, but lives a good way
away."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the doctor, "my wife shall make it out for you.
She keeps all my accounts for me, besides occasionally acting as
my nurse." He hesitated. "But it will take quite a little time,
for she will have to go through a lot of cards." He pulled out a
drawer and lifted it upon the desk. "You see, when the patients
come, I don't enter their names into a book, but a card is
allotted to each one, and the date, name, address, ailment and
roughly what I have prescribed, is written upon it. Then the card
is placed alphabetically in this index and when the patient comes
again it doesn't take two seconds for me to pick up all about
him." He put the drawer under his arm. "Now come with me into the
dining-room. I'll introduce you to my wife and she'll pick out
the list from these cards." He paused just before opening the
door, and whispered, "But tell me, what are these men wanted for,
anything serious?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Murder and other crimes besides that."</p>

<p>The doctor whistled. "Whew! but my wife will be thrilled.
She's very romantic and loves to hear about murderers." His eyes
twinkled. "That's why she married a doctor!"</p>

<p>"Oh! one thing more," said Larose, and he stepped back to the
desk and picked up the original journal. "See this oil mark on
the cover? Well, it has a faint smell of camphor to me, and that
may help us in picking out the thief, for he probably took the
paper home with him in the same pocket as some camphorated oil
that you prescribed."</p>

<p>The doctor sniffed hard at the paper and then shook his head.
"You have a very lively imagination, young man," he said with a
smile, "for I can't smell anything." He shrugged his shoulders.
"Still you may be right, for I smoke a good deal. Are you a
smoker?"</p>

<p>"As a rule," replied Larose, "but I've not had a cigarette for
over a week now, and my scent is pretty keen. I've been laid up
from a crack over the head that one of the gentlemen I'm after
gave me."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said the doctor. He laughed. "But I expect it
makes your wish to get him as keen as your smell. But come on
now, we'll see the wife. She knows who are the patients, and can
tell you all about them."</p>

<p>The detective found Mrs. Smith a pleasant-looking, placid
woman, many years younger than the doctor, and certainly the very
last person, he thought, to be thrilled with murders. Her husband
introduced him and explained what was wanted; then he pointed to
the grease splash upon the journal and asked her to smell it. "A
bit of detective work, Mary," he said, "and Mr. Larose will be
getting you a job at Scotland Yard if you can tell him what it
is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith smelt it delicately. "Camphorated oil," she said at
once. "I can recognise it plainly."</p>

<p>The doctor threw up his hands. "And that's what Mr. Larose
declared," he said disgustedly, "and I told him it was all
imagination." He bustled to the door. "Well, I'll have to leave
you two detectives together and go off and do some work. I hear a
lot of coughing and scraping of feet going on in the waiting-room, and that means the poor wretches are getting
desperate."</p>

<p>Alone with the detective, Mrs. Smith proceeded to go through a
great number of cards, but she worked quickly and soon had a
little heap of them put to one side upon the table.</p>

<p>"Thirty-seven," she said at last, "and those are all the
patients my husband saw in the surgery that day." She sorted out
the cards. "The pink ones are the panel patients and the white
ones the private ones. Now do you want to go through the panel
patients?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "I don't think so," he replied. "They'd hardly
be buying cases of expensive burgundy like the man I'm
after."</p>

<p>"Well, that simplifies our work a lot," said Mrs. Smith, "and
leaves only nine to deal with, and I'm sure I know nearly all of
them. Five are women." She proceeded in a brisk and most
professional manner to go through the cards. "Mrs. Colliver, aged
22, and expecting a baby. No, she's the grocer's wife and most
respectable. Mrs. Astley, age 41, and being treated for eczema.
Nice woman and keeps a milliner's shop. Mrs. Davis, 46,
indigestion and sore tongue, the solicitor's wife. Mrs. Rumbull,
33, nerves and nothing the matter with her. Husband keeps a boot
shop. Miss Dander, 24, school teacher, indigestion from over-smoking and drinking too much tea."</p>

<p>"That's all the women, now for the men. B. Hawker, 34, stomach
pains. Ah! he's since gone into hospital and had his appendix
out. Employed in the Post Office. R. Wellington, 35, aching
limbs, earache. Temperature 100.2. Probably influenza. Occupation
not given. Address Crown Hotel. 5 gr. Dover powder and 5 grains
aspirin prescribed. Hum! No, I don't know him, but he evidently
took up some time, for I see the doctor charged him 7/6. Next, R.
P. Walker, 51, tonsillitis, temperature 102. He's a butcher, and
we have dealt with him for twenty years. Quite all right."</p>

<p>She started to replace the cards. "Well, that's all, Mr.
Larose, and except this R. Wellington, every patient I have
mentioned lives in Cambridge and is well known to us." She held
up her hand. "But wait a minute, I've thought of something. You
shall ring up the Crown Hotel straightaway, and find out what
they know about this Mr. Wellington. Yes, you ring up and then
I'll get the doctor out of his surgery and we'll show him this
card."</p>

<p>The detective, with a great admiration for her shrewdness, did
as she suggested, but upon getting in touch with the hotel, was
not at all surprised to learn that they knew nothing about a Mr.
Wellington. The proprietor himself answered the phone and was
positive that no person of that name had stayed there, at any
rate, during the past year.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Smith knocked at the surgery door and the doctor
came out. He was told everything had been sifted down, and that
in all probability the Mr. R. Wellington must have been the
purloiner of the journal, for he was the only stranger whose
respectability the doctor would know nothing about. Also the
prescription that had been given him suggested that a verbal
injunction might have been made at the same time, that he should
rub his chest with camphorated oil. Added to that, he had told
the doctor an untruth when he had said he was stopping at the
Crown Hotel.</p>

<p>"But why should he have wanted to mislead me about his
address?" asked the doctor doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Larose, "if he had stolen something from your
waiting room, he would naturally not want you to know too much
about him, now would he?"</p>

<p>"But can you remember him, Roger," asked Mrs. Smith quickly,
perceiving that her husband was anxious to get back to his
surgery. "You ought to, for you put the P.A.A. at the bottom of
the card."</p>

<p>The doctor's eyes twinkled. "That means 'probably an
alcoholic,'" he whispered to the detective. "I have to make
little notes like that to jog my memory." He stared hard at the
card.</p>

<p>"No, I'm sorry, but I haven't the very slightest recollection
of him, but still&mdash;I'll try and think about him later on.
Now where are you staying the night? The Bull Hotel! Good! Then
I'll ring you up later if I think of anything. Apart from that
your only chance is to try the chemist. I tell all strangers to
go to Griffin's." He shook his hand. "Good-bye and good luck. I'm
pleased to have met you."</p>

<p>The detective found Griffin's, but they told him they had no
record on their books of any prescription having been made up for
an R. Wellington, likewise the next chemist down the street, but
at a third shop he was heartened at once when the man behind the
counter, after only a minute's search, furnished the information
that they had made up a prescription for a gentleman of that name
on September 9.</p>

<p>"Can you remember him, a tall man with a long face and a big
nose?" asked Larose anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the man, "but one moment," he added. "I'll
ask my son, for I see from the prescription book that he made up
the powders." He shook his head. "But I'm afraid there's very
little hope."</p>

<p>But at once a very bright-faced young man emerged from a back
room, and stated that he not only remembered Mr. R. Wellington
quite clearly, but knew to the minute when he had made up the
prescription for him on the afternoon of Thursday, September
9.</p>

<p>It happened, he explained, there was a race meeting at
Newmarket that afternoon, and a horse called 'The Duke of
Wellington' was running in the 3.30. He had been thinking all day
about having a few shillings on it, and the coincidence of a
gentleman named Wellington coming in very shortly before the time
of the starting of the race, had seemed to him so marvelous that
he did back it and won quite a nice little sum, for the horse had
started to 33 to 1.</p>

<p>He remembered it was nearly a quarter-past three when the
prescription had come in, and he had been so expeditious in
serving the gentleman in order to get in touch with his bookmaker
in time, that he spilt some camphorated oil that was also being
purchased, all down his coat, and he had never been quite able to
get the smell away since.</p>

<p>"And you are sure you remember what your benefactor was like?"
asked the delighted Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He was tall and slight and had a long narrow face
with a long nose. He had a very deep voice and, from his fingers,
he's always smoking cigarettes."</p>

<p>"Then do you know where he came from?" asked Larose, trembling
at the very thought of the answer he might get.</p>

<p>"No, sir, but it was some long way. Somewhere towards the
coast, for he was taking a pint bottle of methylated spirits away
with him too, and would not allow me to make one parcel of it
with the camphorated oil, because the road just beyond
Littleport, he said, was under repair, and, as he would be
getting a good jolting, he didn't want any broken bottles in his
pocket." The young fellow smiled. "In case it may help you in any
way, I think the gentleman had been drinking. He smelt very
strongly of spirits and kept on blinking his eyes a lot."</p>

<p>Larose was quite pleased with his day's work, and when later
the plain-clothes man, Hale, rang up at the Bull Hotel, and
reported no success for the day, he was by no means
downhearted.</p>

<p>"Now, at any rate, I've found out something," he said. "I know
he lives about forty miles from Cambridge and, as I expected,
back in the direction of Hunstanton. Also, I know he kept to the
main road and did not begin the muddy part of the journey to his
house until he'd gone at least thirty miles, therefore, he turned
off, right or left, somewhere a few miles before he reached
Downham Market, with the muddy fen country on either side."</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled. "Now, I have thought all along that these
wretches who were after Lady Ardane were members of an organized
gang that existed and was at work as a gang, long before there
was any idea of this kidnapping, and if they were engaged in the
illicit drug traffic, then that would explain their number and
the resources at their command. There must be quite eight of them
in the gang, and they must be well financed to possess a motor
yacht, and at least two cars. Those false number plates upon the
Jehu, too, were not new, and the clear indication therefore is,
that they have been employing them upon unlawful expeditions for
some time, and that their coming into existence had nothing
whatever to do with the recent happenings at Carmel Abbey."</p>

<p>He took out his ordnance map and spread it upon the table.
"And what better place could a gang want for their headquarters
than among the Fens? In places, for their areas, the Fens are
still among the most desolate and lonely parts of England, and
the roads that lead on to them lead nowhere but to the few
isolated farms that the lands of the reclaimed swamps shelter.
The cultivated parts that have been wrung from the mud and the
quagmire and the slime are still like islands, with the narrow
bridges over the drains and cuttings, the only means of
communication with the bad, heavy roads that lead away outside on
to the bitumen and then on to the towns." He traced an imaginary
circle with his finger upon a part of the map. "Why, there are
miles and miles of country here about these Methwold and Feltwell
Fens that do not appear to be crossed by a road in any
direction."</p>

<p>He undressed quickly and got into bed. "Well, it'll be bad
luck if we don't forge ahead quickly to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next morning he was early upon the road, for he had
instructed the plain-clothes men to meet him sharp at nine
o'clock in the town of Downham Market.</p>

<p>Passing through Ely a few minutes after half-past eight, his
eyes suddenly became riveted upon a very shabby-looking car
standing outside an iron monger's shop, and he gave a startled
exclamation and half stopped, but then moved slowly on. "Gosh!"
he whispered, "but I'd swear that's Jones' car!"</p>

<p>He pulled his car into the kerb close near to a small public-house and, stopping his engine, was upon the point of alighting
when he suddenly sank back into his seat and ducked his head
sharply. The two assistants of the great Naughton Jones were just
issuing from the bar, and the ex-Limehouse Bruiser was rubbing
the back of his hand appreciatively over his mouth, as if he had
just partaken of some agreeable refreshment!</p>

<p>"Hah! hah!" hissed Larose, melodramatically, "then they've
struck a trail, if it's only a beer one." The grin left his face
and he peered furtively through the curtains of his car. "Yes,
and, the hounds are running up to meet their master, for here's
Jones himself coming out of the ironmonger's."</p>

<p>He saw them all get into the car, and then off it went with a
great noise and in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Now what's brought Jones here?" He whistled. "And he's taken
the Cambridge road too!"</p>

<p>He thought a moment and then ran quickly into the ironmonger's
shop, as if he were in a great hurry. "Did my friend, that
gentleman who's just gone," he asked breathlessly of the man
behind the counter, "remember to leave you the pattern of the
wick he wanted."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the man at once, "he didn't show me any
pattern, but he just asked for a Ventnor wick, and I've never
heard of it. He said someone he knew had bought one here, but I'm
sure he's mistaken."</p>

<p>"Dear me! How very annoying!" said Larose. "My friend is so
forgetful. Who was it, he said, had got the wick here?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Henderson, sir, but I don't remember him, although he
gave me his description."</p>

<p>"Tall and slim, with a long nose?" exclaimed Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and he said this gentleman always bought his
cartridges here."</p>

<p>The detective left the shop as if most annoyed with his
forgetful friend, but directly he was outside the annoyance
passed. "Really!", he exclaimed smilingly, "but great minds do
generally think alike. A wick was the first thing I thought of
and&mdash;Jones thought of one, too. Something that would enable
us to put in a few questions, and yet we wouldn't be able to
purchase." He looked very thoughtful. "Now I wonder what's taking
Jones to Cambridge? He didn't want that medical journal, and yet
he's got upon the trail, just as I have, but almost certainly in
some other way. What a pity it is that he's so difficult to
manage, for with he and I together"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"no
one would be safe."</p>

<p>Arriving at Downham Market, he found the plain-clothes men
waiting for him. They had covered a wide area of ground the
previous day, but although they had collected the names of a
large number of persons who possessed Jehu cars, there was
nothing of an encouraging nature in their reports.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Larose, "I'll get you to alter the line of
your enquiries to-day. This man we're after seems a bit of a
boozer and you must try the hotel right now. Also, his fingers
are stained a lot from smoking cigarettes. Comb this town first
and then try the villages up the main road as far as Littleport.
We'll make the King's Arms our headquarters here, and I expect to
be back by six at the latest. I'm going to work round Swaffham
and Brandon for I'm a bit suspicious of those Fens upon the
Suffolk border."</p>

<p>Within an hour then, Larose, after making enquiries at every
village upon his way, found himself in the pleasant little town
of Swaffham, and was electrified to learn at the very first
garage he called at, that a man had purchased two valve cap
covers a couple of days previously.</p>

<p>"But he hasn't got a Jehu," supplemented the proprietor of the
garage, "for he drives an Ariel. Still that doesn't matter for
his covers are the same size." He nodded grimly. "But if you
think you'll find out anything hanky-panky about Dick Hart,
you'll come a cropper straightaway, for Dick's one of the
straightest men about here and I've known him for some years and
he's highly respected. Someone pinched these covers of his last
week when he'd left his car upon the road for a few minutes to go
down his meadows after some sheep. He lives near Oxborough and
about six miles from here. Enquire at the inn there, and they'll
direct you to his place."</p>

<p>Larose thanked him for his information and then was thrilled
again, when the man gave him the names and places where they
lived, of two men who owned Jehu cars, for one of them, Roy
Fensum, lived in the heart of the Methwold Fens.</p>

<p>"But Fensum isn't a customer of mine," nodded the man, "and I
don't see him once in a blue moon. Still his car occasionally
goes through here, although often he's not driving it himself.
Yes, it's a grey one and when he's not driving it, it goes pretty
fast. No, he's not tall by any means. He's medium sized, and you
can't mistake him, for he's very dark. What is he?" The man
laughed. "Why a farmer, of course, and he goes in for Romney
Marsh sheep! No, I don't know the other chaps who drive it, for
they've always got the curtains up and don't appear ever to stop
in the town. Quite welcome, sir. Good morning."</p>

<p>The detective went off in high glee. Things were now shaping
splendidly, and he was sure he was getting close.</p>

<p>He found Dick Hart with no difficulty, but met with no very
favorable reception, after crossing over a very muddy field to
get speech with him. The man was ploughing with four horses, one
of which became very restive, as the plough was stopped when
Larose came up. Hart was a fine, well-built fellow about forty-five, with a big face and very fearless-looking eyes. He scowled
irritably when Larose started to ask him about his recent
purchases in Swaffham.</p>

<p>"And what's the hell's that to do with you?" he asked. He
looked very fierce. "You'll play no tricks with me, young fellow,
for I was a policeman once. What! a detective, are you? Well,
show me your badge."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Larose. "It couldn't have been better,"
and he at once produced his badge and told him who he was.</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed the man, his whole expression altering. "Then
you're this Gilbert Larose are you? I'm proud to meet you, sir.
I've heard all about you, of course, Detective Inspector," he
went on, giving Larose his proper title and now saluting most
respectfully. "I was in the Metropolitan Police Force." He drew
himself up proudly. "Sergeant Richard Hart and fifteen years with
never a bad mark against me. I still keep in touch with things a
bit, for I've a brother in the City Police and he sends the
Gazette every now and then." He expended a few curses upon the
restive horse and then turned back to Larose. "Now, what do you
want to know, sir?'"</p>

<p>The detective realised at once that he was in the presence of
a man of sterling character, and told him quickly what he wanted.
Then in a few terse sentences, and without the use of one
unnecessary word, the ex-policeman related all that had
happened.</p>

<p>He had left his car unattended upon the road the previous
Monday week about two o'clock in the afternoon, and gone about a
quarter of a mile down the meadow, to look at some sheep. He had
not actually seen any car pass, because for part of the time he
had been in a dip in the field, but he had heard one go by, and
then returning to the road a few minutes later, had noticed at
once that his valve-cap covers had gone. He was positive beyond
any possibility of mistake that they had been there a few minutes
before, because not half an hour previously he had put some air
in each of the tyres and had then screwed up all the covers
tightly.</p>

<p>Then, assured from his whole bearing and demeanor that the man
could be thoroughly trusted, Larose went straight to the point
and asked him about Roy Fensum, as one who was under suspicion of
the authorities.</p>

<p>"I just know Fensum very slightly, and that's all," replied
Hurt. "He's not a type of man that I like and I'm hardly ever
brought in contact with him. I see him at Brandon Market
sometimes, but he never appears to mix much with anyone. He keeps
himself very much to himself, and I don't know any farmer round
here who's friendly with him. He's a widower and employs several
hands. No women, I believe, about the place at all. Yes, I've
been there once lately. I bought a horse off him about six months
ago. Oh! you want to go and see him, do you?" He nodded
vigorously. "Well, you be very careful and don't stop your car
until you're right up to the house, for he's got two big, ugly-looking Alsatians that come up at once and go for strangers. Oh!
you want to go up there without being seen! Well, that's rather
difficult, for he's right in the heart of the Methwold Fens." He
looked hard at the detective. "What do you want to go and look at
him for? What's he supposed to have done?"</p>

<p>"Murder, perhaps," replied Larose sharply, "and other things
as well. At any rate, that's what he's mixed up in, and I think
there's a gang of bad men up there."</p>

<p>The ex-policeman's face paled a little under its tan. "Whew!"
he whistled, "so it's as bad as that!" He considered for a moment
and then looked at his watch. "Here, sir, you just wait until
I've finished this round, and then come in and have a bit of
dinner with me." He nodded. "I may be able to help you a lot, for
I was born among these Fens and have fished every cut and dyke.
Yes, you come, sir, and we'll have a talk." He laughed and looked
very pleased with himself. "It will remind me of the old times
when I was P.C. Richard Hart, and handling the drunks up Hoxton
way."</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>

THE DARK FENS</h2>

<p class="first">A QUARTER of an hour later the detective was
being ushered into a large, homely kitchen, and the ex-policeman
was putting a cold leg of pork upon the table.</p>

<p>"We've got the whole place to ourselves to-day," he explained,
"for the children are at school and the missis is out gadding
about. I let her out of the cells for the day, and she's in
Downham Market buying things we don't need and don't want. Bless
her heart! She's like all women&mdash;directly she's got a few
bob in her pocket she must let them go. Beer? Ah! that's right. I
thought you might be one of those tea-drinking fiends." He went
on. "I remember there was a doctor once on my beat, a very clever
chap, but always on the booze, and many a time I've popped him
into his own doorway, instead of running him into the station as
I ought to have done. Well, he told me once that the early
morning cup of tea some people take was more responsible for
indigestion than anything else. He was a fine fellow and married
a barmaid afterwards, and then she wouldn't let him touch a drop
of drink. Cut it right out and made a splendid chap of him. When
I left the Force he had got four kiddies and was a bit of a nob
on Harley street. Consulting physician and becoming a big bug on
nerves."</p>

<p>They proceeded to do justice to the meal, and then suddenly,
looking out of the window, Hart remarked, "My days! but your
luck's in, Mr. Larose. There's a fog coming up from over the Fens
and I'm thinking that's the only hope in the world of you getting
near Fensum's place without being seen."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Larose, "do you get bad fogs here?"</p>

<p>Hart laughed. "Bad!" he exclaimed, "why, good old London's
nothing to them! Mind you, they're not black or yellow, but just
a thick, heavy white. They come up all at once, and they may last
a fortnight, and when they're really bad you can't see your own
feet. Then it's almost like having a blanket over your head." He
nodded. "I'll lend you my little compass, and you can send it
back any time. I shan't be here to-morrow, though, for the missis
is giving me a holiday, and I'm going to London for the day."</p>

<p>"Well, about this man Fensum," asked Larose, "what is the name
of his place?"</p>

<p>"Black Gallows," replied Hart, with a grin, "and it seems like
proving a darned appropriate name." He looked intently at the
detective. "But the more I think about it, sir, the more I'm
inclined to believe that if there's anything in the nature of a
gang up there, as seems to be your idea&mdash;then you're taking
a great risk, going alone."</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to make any arrests to-day," replied
Larose, "I only just want to get a peep at all the men who are
living there. I've some good glasses with me and if I get within
half a mile of them, it will do."</p>

<p>"And that's about as near as you will get," nodded the ex-policeman, "for it's all level ground at once when you get on
Fensum's lands. He's got about 1,600 acres of it and every yard
was swamp and quagmire once." He looked very serious. "It's a
regular trap for anyone, directly they get on it, who doesn't
know the place, for it's cut off from everywhere by great wide
drains, deep dykes, and the dangerous little River Wissey. Apart
from that, it's criss-crossed in lots of places with dykes that,
although they are certainly not so wide, you would never get
over."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Larose. "I could swim at a pinch."</p>

<p>"Swim!" ejaculated Hart scornfully. "Yes, you could swim if
there was any depth of water in them, but you couldn't swim in
the Fen mud. There's nothing like it anywhere else. It's ten and
twelve feet deep in parts, as thick almost, as tar, and as heavy
as lead when it clings to you." His eyes dilated. "Why, I saw a
bullock once disappear in less than three minutes after it had
slipped down into the Big Cut Drain that borders upon one side of
Fensum's property." He shook his head. "No, Mr. Larose, as well
face a bullet at point-blank range as try to cross over those
drains."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me how I'll get there," said Larose, in no way
dismayed, "and I'll take a chance. It's like this, Mr. Hart," he
added, "I may be entirely at fault in my suspicions and this
Fensum may be a perfectly innocent man, and there may be no one
upon his premises who has done anything wrong. So, I don't want
to come down with a search warrant and a large party of officers,
and besides making a fool of myself, rouse all the countryside,
and give the real culprit a chance of breaking away when they
learn I'm after them. I want to be sure, first. I want to catch
sight of either one of two men, and then I shall be certain once
and for all how I stand."</p>

<p>"You've no certain knowledge then," asked Hart, "that any of
the men who are wanted are there?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose at once, "no certain knowledge at all,
but"&mdash;he spoke very slowly&mdash;"I have come a long trail,
and it leads most definitely to somewhere about here. To a man
who has some reason for covering up all his tracks wherever he
goes, who lives in the Fen country, who drives a Jehu car and
uses false number-plates, and who, finally, has been in need of
two valve-cap covers such as yours, within the past few days." He
broke off suddenly and asked, "Now, do you ever get any
aeroplanes coming over here, on moonlight nights?"</p>

<p>Hart nodded. "Yes, we do, occasionally," he replied. "Not very
often, but when we do get one, we always get two"&mdash;he
frowned&mdash;"or, now that you are making me suspicious about
everything, we hear the same one going and returning."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" commented Larose, looking very pleased, "and it's a
dope gang I'm after. Someone drops the stuff, I'm thinking, from
these aeroplanes you hear." He smiled. "Another link in the
chain, my friend."</p>

<p>"All right," said the ex-policeman briskly, "and I'll not try
and dissuade you any more." He fetched a piece of paper and a
pencil. "I'll draw you a map. Oh! that's all right," he went on
as Larose took his ordinance map out of his pocket, "then I'll
only need to draw you one of Fensum's place."</p>

<p>They bent their heads over the map and he pointed out the way
to the detective. "There's Black Gallows, and it's seven miles
from here. Now, you'll go along the Methwold Road until you see
an inn on the left, just at the beginning of Methwold village."
He shook his head warningly. "But whatever you do, don't go near
that inn, for the proprietor, Jowles, is about the one pal Fensum
has. He's got a face like a ferret and if you ask anything about
Black Gallows there it's a hundred to one he'll tell Fensum about
it. So leave the main road about two hundred yards before you get
to this inn and take the side road to the right. This road won't
look very inviting, because it's always muddy. Then go straight
along for about three miles until you come to a small
plantation." He paused for a moment and considered. "There, I
think, you'd better leave the car, for beyond that it'd be a
black spot on the landscape that could be picked up easily. Yes,
run your car round the back of the plantation. There's a dip in
the ground there and it'll be quite safe. Then about a quarter of
a mile farther on you'll come to a big, deep drain, about three
times as wide as this room and you'll see a gate, opening on to a
black wooden bridge crossing the drain."</p>

<p>"An iron gate?" asked Larose sharply, "that's not been painted
lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hart looking very surprised, "how do you know
that?"</p>

<p>"Only that the inside of the fingers and the palm of some
motor gloves that belong to one of the men I'm looking for,"
replied Larose, with difficulty suppressing the exultation that
he felt, "smelt strongly of rust, when I was handling them the
other day. Go on."</p>

<p>"Open this gate&mdash;you'll have to lift it up, for one of
the posts has sunk&mdash;and cross over the bridge. It's only
made of planks and there are wide spaces between them." He picked
up his pencil and piece of paper. "Now comes the dangerous part
of the journey, and I'll draw you a map. Look, you'll be now
about two miles from Fensum's houses. There are two of them. One
is where they live, and the other is a long, two-storied building
that is not occupied, and has long since fallen into ruins."</p>

<p>"That's interesting!" exclaimed Larose. "What was it built
for?"</p>

<p>"It was the cracked idea of the man who had Black Gallows
about thirty years ago," replied Hart. "He was a Jew, called
Bernstein, and he thought he would train horses upon Black
Gallows and no one would be able to spy upon him, and learn how
good his animals were. So he built a racing stable, with the
ground floor all stalls and loose boxes for the horses, and the
storey above them for his trainer and the stable hands. He spent
a lot of money on it, and some of the rooms above were quite
comfortably fitted up. But this Bernstein died, and, as I say,
all the place has gone to ruin since."</p>

<p>"What sort of a farmer is Fensum?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Hart shook his head. "A poor one, and with plenty of good
land, he makes little of it. He crops a few acres and he's got a
good few Romney Marsh sheep. But he never troubles much and folks
often wonder how he makes it pay." He looked down at the map he
was drawing, and went on. "Well, now you're inside Fensum's
property and your real difficulties begin. Don't take the road
leading up to the house, but hug the side of the big drain for
about four hundred paces, then if there's any fog, which it looks
likely there will be, set your compass, turn off at right angles
and, keeping straight north for two miles or just a little more,
you will come bang up against these stables."</p>

<p>The detective studied the map carefully. "It seems quite easy,
Mr. Hart," he said, "and I ought to have no difficulty."</p>

<p>The ex-policeman looked very serious. "But for the Lord's
sake," he said warmly, "keep your eyes on this compass and go
straight north the whole time, for if you don't, you'll get among
a maze of dykes and you'll never find your way back again, until
the fog lifts."</p>

<p>"And about those dogs," said Larose thoughtfully, "do you know
if they run loose after dark?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly think so," replied Hart, "for no farmer
leaves his dogs unchained at night. They don't learn what
discipline is if they're not on the chain sometimes." A thought
came to him. "Now have you got a good knife on you, Mr.
Larose!"</p>

<p>"A pocket one," replied the detective, "but not a dagger."</p>

<p>"Then I'll lend you a bayonet," replied Hart, "a good one that
I took off a German on the glorious Vimy Ridge. Poor devil. I'd
just given him the haymaker's lift with mine." He bent over
towards Larose. "Now look here, sir, I'll give you a good tip for
dealing with a dog when it comes rushing at you. Meet it
crouching down, or even, if you've got a good knife, some say,
lying down. Then he loses all the benefit of his rush and the
impetus of his big body doesn't knock you over. I'll give you a
nice square of wire netting, too. That foggles them and you can
strike through the meshes." He shook his head. "I'm afraid for
you if you meet with those Alsatians in the fog and don't want to
pistol them and let everyone know you are about the place.
Generally, they don't bark when they come to you. You only hear a
blood-curdling snarl!"</p>

<p>The detective parted with much gratitude to the ex-policeman
for his kindness. "Really, my luck's in," he told himself, as he
drove away, "and I couldn't have met with a better man."</p>

<p>Larose was rather disappointed when, for the first two miles
or so, the weather appeared to be clearing, but when he judged he
was halfway upon his journey, he ran all at once into a thick
bank of fog and began to almost wish it had been so.</p>

<p>He could not see a dozen yards beyond the bonnet of his car,
and he had to take out his ordnance map and with the help of an
electric torch, tick off the turnings to the right and left as he
went by.</p>

<p>He came at last to the turning on to the muddy road, and there
was no doubt about the mud there, for his tyres squelched into it
most unpleasantly and it was flung up in big spots all over the
windscreen. In the fog he was desperately afraid of missing the
plantation, but, taking Hart's estimate of three miles as being
quite accurate, he stopped when he had gone that distance and
walked on on foot. But the estimate had been a very good one, and
within a hundred yards he came upon the trees looming like ghosts
out of the fog.</p>

<p>He parked the car where he had been advised and, greatly
heartened that now he would find the going much easier, taking a
few things from the tool-box, he set off blithely for Black
Gallows.</p>

<p>He found the iron gate without much difficulty, and tip-toed
up to it, with his heart beating strongly. "Yes, Gilbert, my
boy," he whispered, as he noted the rust upon his hands as he
climbed over, "you've not lost quite all your punch yet, although
you do make big bloomers every now and then."</p>

<p>The fog was now lifting a little and he regarded with no
pleasant feeling the deep, wide drain under the wooden bridge. It
was evidently one of the main ones that had been dug to drain the
Methwold Fens, and its waters, he judged, were at least fifteen
feet below the top of the drain sides.</p>

<p>"A nice place to be thrown into," he thought with something of
a pang at the dangers that were now facing him, "but it would
make funeral expenses very cheap." He grinned. "What price,
Gilbert, commencing your last long sleep down there, with the
eels gnawing the 'Dead March in Saul.'"</p>

<p>Still keeping most minutely to the directions of Dick Hart, be
turned sharp to the left and hugged the side of the drain for
four hundred carefully counted paces. Then he turned again at
right angles but to the right this time, and was quickly
swallowed up in the silence of a dead world.</p>

<p>Very, very soon it came to him, that he had lost a friend, for
he realised now that the sullen gurgling of the water in the
drain had been a comfort to him and a reassuring thought that he
could turn back at any time if he so wished, and reach his car
and safety again. But now he was cut off from everything, and in
all directions, less than fifty yards away, stretched a wall of
ghostly and impenetrable fog.</p>

<p>His life's work among dangers had however, hardened him, and
with no quickening of his pulses, and with the little compass
held close up to his eyes all the time, he proceeded to walk
briskly forward, to cover the two miles that the ex-policeman had
told him would now be separating him from the racing stables of
the dead Jew, Bernstein.</p>

<p>"And once I'm there," he thought confidently, "I shall be only
300 yards due east from the farm where they all live."</p>

<p>He did not seem too happy, all the same. "But I may have to
wait until dark," his thoughts ran on, "and that will make it
about half-past five. It's quite on the cards, too, that those
dogs may spoil everything, and it isn't too good to think they
may turn up when I'm too close to the buildings to dare to use my
gun. Still, I should imagine that with this dense fog, they have
been chained up long ago, for the sake of the sheep."</p>

<p>He kept on looking round, however, and held his square yard of
wire-netting unfolded, and the German bayonet ready in his hand.
"But what a come down," he grinned, assuring himself for the
hundredth time of the sharpness of the blade. "Once making
history in the great world-war, and now being hawked about upon a
lonely fen, to thrust into the throat of a snarling dog if he
comes near."</p>

<p>The fog was lifting slightly, and his area of observation had
now become a little wider. Then when, according to his
calculations, he could not be more than a quarter of a mile from
his objective, he took a zig-zag course for a hundred yards or
so, to assure himself that his compass was functioning correctly.
He found it was quite all right and was just setting his course
due north again, when suddenly he heard a slight noise behind
him.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, thinking he might have been mistaken,
but then he heard the sound again&mdash;the labored panting of
some animal!</p>

<p>His blood froze in horror as he stood peering in the direction
from which the sound was coming, but all was fog&mdash;fog
everywhere, with earth and sky in the grip of their dark
master.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a huge form, magnified by the vapor, loomed into
view. "A calf! only a calf!" he ejaculated in great relief, "and
I have been giving myself a fright for nothing."</p>

<p>But in two seconds the horror all returned, for, with his head
bent close to the ground, the creature was now nosing along each
foot of the zig-zag course that the detective had just taken. To
the left, to the right, and then to the left again, on came the
animal.</p>

<p>"One of the Alsatians!" gasped Larose. "He's picked up my
trail!" and then he smiled, as a brave man often does in the
presence of danger. His hand was steady, his pulse had quietened
down, and he sank gently on to the ground in such a position that
he would be lying upon his left side, and facing it, when the
Alsatian had finished with the zig-zags and came to nose along
the straight trail.</p>

<p>A few breathless seconds followed, with the hound quickening
his pace and now beginning to whimper eagerly. Then he stopped
suddenly and with his fine head upraised and one fore paw lifted
off the ground, stood staring straight in front of him.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of Larose.</p>

<p>The detective was lying quite still. The square of wire
netting was tucked under one side of him, covering his head and
the greater part of his body. In his right hand he held the
bayonet, and in his left, clutching to the wire netting, was his
automatic.</p>

<p>Perhaps ten seconds then passed, and becoming aware, perhaps
by some instinct or perhaps by some unconscious movement that
Larose had made, that his prey before him was living and not
dead, the great beast drew back his lips with a savage snarl, and
then without an instant's warning, dashed straight for the
detective's throat.</p>

<p>But with his head down, there was no force behind the impact,
and with his muzzle coming in contact with the wire netting, he
fixed his teeth in it and tore at it to pull it away.</p>

<p>But the deadly bayonet plunged instantly between the meshes of
the wire and drew blood from somewhere in the dog's head. The
blow, however was not an effective one, and the enraged beast,
snarling furiously in his pain, returned savagely to the attack,
this time planting his great forefeet upon the detective's
shoulder and rolling him over upon his back.</p>

<p>But, like lightning, the bayonet plunged again, and now,
penetrating deeply into the flesh, it tore a ghastly wound across
the animal's throat. The effect was instantaneous, and the
Alsatian sank down groaning upon his side.</p>

<p>Larose sprang to his feet, and not discarding the wire
netting, plunged the bayonet again and again, into the dog's
heart.</p>

<p>The whole happening had not lasted two minutes, from the
moment when the detective had first seen the Alsatian to when he
was kneeling down beside it and wiping his hands upon the damp
grass.</p>

<p>But there was no exultation in his face. On the contrary, it
was more gloomy and downcast. "But this is most unfortunate," he
thought, "for there's no possible chance of hiding the body, and
with the beast missing they'll find it at once when the fog lifts
and know that someone's been here." He shook his head. "It's no
triumph, it's a real disaster."</p>

<p>A few moments later, however, he was regarding it as a
disaster of quite a minor kind, for, to his horror, he discovered
he had now lost his compass.</p>

<p>In a fever of haste, he began to search all over the ground,
where he had been standing when he had first heard the pantings
behind him, where he had lain, awaiting the coming of the
Alsatian and where, finally, he had sprung to plunge the bayonet
into its heart.</p>

<p>At last he found it close to the dead dog's side, trodden into
the ground, its glass smashed to atoms and its needle broken
off!</p>

<p>For a long moment he stood surveying it as he held it in the
palm of his hand. Then he looked round at the fog, now beginning
to close down thicker and thicker than ever, and a choking
feeling came up into his throat. In all his life he thought he
had never been in a more unpleasant position.</p>

<p>"Gilbert! Gilbert!" he exclaimed sorrowfully, "you're losing
grip of the game"&mdash;he looked down at the Alsatian&mdash;"and
if this poor beast only knew it, he has triumphed even in
death."</p>

<p>But he was never down-hearted for very long, and, always of a
sanguine disposition, he was very soon endeavoring to discern
some way out of his predicament.</p>

<p>He tried, first, to place the exact position in which he had
lain down, and from that determine in which direction the
Alsatian had approached, for the path of the dog, he told
himself, following in a bee-line up his own track, would point
directly due north, and towards where the stables lay.</p>

<p>He worked it all out as well as he could, and then, to make
sure he should not wander in a circle, walked forward in
distances of only ten paces at a time, and after the first ten
paces, with two directing ground-marks always behind him.</p>

<p>The procedure was very simple. He dropped his cap, covered the
ten paces, stuck his bayonet into the ground, and then went on
for another, ten, but walking backwards this time in order to
keep the cap and bayonet always exactly in the same straight
line. Then he dropped his piece of wire netting, went back and
retrieved the cap, and using the bayonet and wire netting now for
the straight line, walked backwards as before for another ten
paces and dropped his cap once more.</p>

<p>It was very slow work, and he was by no means too hopeful
about it, but it was the only thing he could think of, and all
along he kept buoying himself up with the hope that with the fog
lifting any moment he might catch sight of the disused stables,
not far away, and perhaps be able to hide himself until night
fell and the other Alsatian was chained up. Then circumstances
must determine what he must do.</p>

<p>Larose walked on and on, but nothing happened and no building
came into sight, just fog, impenetrable fog everywhere, and the
ghostly silence of the lonely fen. Then at last, when he knew he
must have proceeded much farther than the allotted quarter of
mile&mdash;he realised that he was lost.</p>

<p>He heaved a big sigh, and sitting down, proceeded to light a
cigarette. "No good worrying," he told himself, "and no good
tiring myself out"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"I'll just wait until
the tea bell rings and then walk in with the farm hands. They
can't refuse me a good meal, even if they do shoot me
afterwards."</p>

<p>An hour passed, two, a weak and bastard dusk crept down and
seemed to argue with the fog as to which was the better blanket,
and then night fell, so chilling to the very marrow of his bones
and so dark that it could almost be felt.</p>

<p>"But this won't do," he told himself, "or I'll be getting
another fever," and he began to walk backwards and forwards,
jerking his arms about all the time.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he was electrified by a muffled sound that came
out of the darkness just upon his right, and his heart stood
still in his excitement, for it had sounded like the banging of a
door.</p>

<p>It was not repeated, but because there was not a breath of air
stirring anywhere to make noises of its own accord, it came to
him instantly that he was in the close vicinity of some animate
beings, and most probably, for surely it was hardly likely to be
otherwise, of human ones.</p>

<p>So he plucked up heart at once, and before he had lost the
direction of the sound, plunged boldly into the darkness before
him. Then came one of the minor shocks of the day, for he had not
proceeded fifty paces when he banged right into a hard wall. For
a moment the impact made him feel sick, but in a few seconds he
had pulled his torch out and was inspecting what had brought him
up so dead.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a stone wall, and higher than he could flash the
rays of his torch; he knew it must be the racing stables that all
along he had been making his objective. But how cruel Fortune had
been, for these two hours and more he had been pacing up and
down, less than forty yards away from the very spot he had come
so far and through such danger to visit!</p>

<p>But he must be careful, very careful, he told himself, for a
banged door meant the presence of someone, and evidently then the
stables were not uninhabited, as the ex-policeman had said.</p>

<p>Flashing his torch every few yards, he began circling
cautiously round the building. He had struck the end of it, he
found, for a very few yards' progress brought him to a corner.
Then he crept along the side, and, a very little way down, a
light from an upper window attracted his attention. He could just
see the window sill, and the window was square, and from the
interruptions in the rays, he thought it must be a barred one. He
stood for a long time listening, but he heard no sound, and
passed on. Next he came to a door. It was approached by three
steps, and it was a big, heavy-looking one, fitting closely.
There was a big handle to it, with the brass green and
discolored, as if it had never been polished. He was half
inclined to turn the handle, but it did not look a door that
could be opened noiselessly, and so he passed on.</p>

<p>Next he came to two more lighted windows, close together, and
still on the upper storey, and he thrilled as he heard the sounds
of deep voices and some laughter, but both windows were shut and
he could not catch a word that was being spoken.</p>

<p>He moved on, quite a long way, it seemed, and then came to the
end of the wall and another sharp corner. He counted 20 paces as
the length of the end of the building. No lights anywhere and no
windows that he could see! Then he turned the corner, and
proceeded slowly down the other side. Big doors, a few of them
shut and locked; some chambers, doorless and gaping open.
Derelict loose-boxes and stalls that had gone to wrack and ruin!
Two barn-like sheds where cows were evidently sheltered at times,
and finally another shed with only half its door standing, that
from a pulley and tackle and pools of dried blood upon the
ground, was evidently used as a place where sheep were
slaughtered. In this last shed was a hay loft, and upon the floor
in the corner, just under the loft, were stacked a number of
trusses of straw.</p>

<p>He made the round of the building again. There was no light
shining now from the first window, but from the other two it was
still there, and the talking and laughter was still going on. He
was considering what he must next do, when suddenly all the
talking ceased, and a few seconds later the haunting strains of
'Ave Maria' came floating through the air.</p>

<p>In spite of his anxiety and a full recognition of the danger
he was in he stood still to listen.</p>

<p>"Life! Life!" he murmured when it was all over. "The beautiful
and the foul things so intermingling. This den of murderers and
the music of the angels! The black evil in men's hearts and yet
their appreciation of the outpouring of Gounod's soul! My clothes
fouled with the blood of that Alsatian hound, and so soon my ears
entranced with a melody that surely falls from Heaven!" He shook
his fist up at the window. "Those men may laugh in happiness to-night, but to-morrow the shape of the scaffold shall loom up into
their dreams."</p>

<p>Then all at once a sound came through the fog, very different
to that he had just been listening to. The mournful baying of a
hound not very far away!</p>

<p>As so often in his life, Larose had to think quickly, and two
minutes later he was racing round to the other side of the
building and climbing into the hay loft in the shed.</p>

<p>"Blood to blood!" he murmured breathlessly. "The blood upon me
will make the scent strong, but if the beast comes here, the
sheep's blood below will turn off his attentions.</p>

<p>"There's no help for it," he went on, "I must remain here
until daylight and then chance it what I must do. Everything
depends upon the fog and if it is still thick, I may get off and
away before they discover what has happened to the other dog."
His heart began to beat a little quicker. "I hardly dare to think
it, but it is just possible Helen Ardane may have been behind
that light that was extinguished so early. Here would be an ideal
place to be keeping her, and I am sure&mdash;I am as sure as I
have ever been about anything in all my life&mdash;that Prince,
the long-faced driver of the Jehu, and I will be all sleeping
under the same roof to-night."</p>

<p>He was consoling himself that he was lucky to be having a warm
bed among the hay and could quite well do without any further
meal that night, when he experienced an agreeable surprise. He
found three eggs close beside him in the loft, and breaking them
carefully under the light of his torch, was of opinion they were
all quite fresh. So he experienced for the first time in his life
how very satisfying raw eggs can be, assuring himself, after he
had eaten them, that even a most succulent grilled steak would
then have lost most of its attraction for him.</p>

<p>He had just finished his frugal meal, when suddenly he made
all his muscles tense and rigid, and holding himself like a thing
of death, he drew in breaths so shallow that he felt almost
suffocated.</p>

<p>He had heard the padding of soft footfalls below!</p>

<p>A long minute passed, two, three, four and then he drew in a
long breath again. The beast, evidently the other Alsatian, had
sniffed and sniffed and poked among the trusses of straw. Then
the click of his big nails had sounded as he pawed up on the
boards under the loft, and finally he had padded away.</p>

<p>"My conscience!" ejaculated the detective, "but if only anyone
had been with him it would have been all up with me."</p>

<p>He nestled himself down among the hay, and, aware that all his
energies would be required upon the morrow, tried to compose
himself to sleep. He had been sure that sleep would be a long
while coming, but he was so exhausted by the varying emotions of
the day, that he dropped off almost at once.</p>

<p>Then he had a strange dream, and he always remembered it
afterwards. He thought he was going to die, and Naughton Jones
came into the room humming the Funeral March, and advised him to
back Angel's Wings, for it was bound to win on Saturday. Then
Lady Ardane came in and kissed him and told him he was going to
get well, but Naughton Jones seemed most annoyed, and said it was
very inconsiderate, for he had just bought a black tie and had an
appointment with the Archbishop of Canterbury at half-past ten.
Then Polkinghorne, the butler, appeared in a great hurry, and
said the coffin had been ordered for someone else, but he got up
and fought him, and was made Sir Gilbert Larose for knocking him
out in the tenth round. Then Lady Ardane put her arms round his
neck and told him that with all his courage he was afraid to ask
her to marry him, but acting upon the Limehouse Bruiser's advice,
who said he believed in Woman's Rights and often bashed his wife
one or two, exactly as he did his men pals when he'd had a drop
of liquor, she was going to propose to him herself. So she put
her red head upon his shoulder and someone pulled down the
blinds.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant dream.</p>

<p>Larose slept long and heavily, and to his disgust the sun was
shining through the open door when he awoke. The fog had all gone
and it was a beautiful late autumn day.</p>

<p>He hopped quickly down from the loft to see if anyone were
about, but then hopped back even more quickly still, for a man
was standing by a fence not two hundred yards away, and another
big Alsatian was prowling about and nosing along the ground much
nearer than that.</p>

<p>"Now what am I to do?" he asked himself ruefully. "It's only
half-past seven and I may have to stay here all day long."</p>

<p>Then he heard faint sounds of movement, just overhead, and he
thrilled at the thought that they might be those of Helen Ardane.
He took out his glasses, and leaning over the rickety loft, swept
them round. He could see the Ely road plainly, and a motor car
going along, also Fensum's house was not far away, and a man
there was saddling a horse. The man had got his back turned to
him, but directly he mounted, his face was towards the
glasses.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" murmured the detective brokenly, "it's the driver of
the Jehu, the long-faced man!" He wrung his hands in his
distress. "I've all the good cards in the pack and yet I dare not
throw one down."</p>

<p>Then he swung his glasses round in the other direction, and at
once picked out the body of the Alsatian he had killed. "And it
won't be five minutes," he nodded grimly, "before it's seen by
someone, and what will happen then?"</p>

<p>But he had no time for grieving over his unfortunate position,
for at that moment he heard the sounds of someone whistling
merrily and the rumbling of a wheelbarrow over the bricken path
outside. The whistler was whistling 'Love's Old Sweet Song.'</p>

<p>In a few seconds the whistler hove in sight, and Larose
groaned when he saw it was the debonair and pleasant-mannered
Prince!</p>

<p>"Another of them!" he ejaculated with a terrible feeling of
oppression over his heart. "The whole gang here and I am as
helpless as a dead man!"</p>

<p>Prince was trundling a sheep, with its legs tied, upon the
barrow, and he made straight for the shed door. He was evidently
going to slaughter it inside. He was in riding breeches and an
open shirt, and bare-headed, with his hair nicely brushed, and
altogether fresh and clean; he looked a fine specimen of young
manhood. He could not, the detective thought, be much over
twenty-six or twenty-seven.</p>

<p>"And yet he is a murderer," muttered Larose, "and to save his
own skin, pistolled one of his friends with the same callousness,
no doubt, as he's now going to butcher this sheep."</p>

<p>He flattened himself against the side of the loft, and well
back among the hay, gripped fiercely at one of the boards, so
that by no movement should he betray his presence there. He was
not ten feet from the pulley and tackle.</p>

<p>Prince pushed the wheelbarrow into the shed and gently lifted
the tethered sheep off on to the floor.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old girl," he said, smiling and showing his
white even teeth, "you don't know what's going to happen so you
oughtn't to be afraid." He took down a knife and steel that were
hanging upon the wall and began sharpening the knife briskly.
"It's quite nice not knowing you're going to die, and I only hope
my end will come like this. No long, tiring pains for you, no bed
of sickness, no melancholy good-byes&mdash;just two seconds of
agony and you'll feel nothing after."</p>

<p>He tested the sharpness of the knife and decided that it was
not yet quite to his liking. He went on, but with a sad note in
his voice now. "But there'll be no more sunrises for you, old
girl&mdash;no more browsings in the meadow, no more wee lambies
to come snuggling up at night. Those times are all gone for you,
for you've grown too old." He came over to the sheep. "It's a
shame, isn't it, old dear, but it's the way of the world, you
know. I'm stronger than you and you've got to suffer for it. No
pity for the weak down here, whatever you've been told. They go
under every time."</p>

<p>He was just about to kill the sheep, when the long-faced man
rode up to the shed door.</p>

<p>"You devil!" he exclaimed seeing what Prince was doing, "I
believe you love that job. You and young Clive ought to have been
butchers. No, wait till I've gone. I don't particularly like the
smell of blood, and I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Speak on, my son," replied Prince. He pointed to the tethered
sheep and added solemnly, "But let your words be meek and
reverent, for you are in the presence of one about to die. What's
the trouble, Clem?"</p>

<p>"There's no trouble," said the other, and then he asked a
question himself. "Seen Helen yet, this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Prince carelessly, "and she was just as sulky as
ever and gave me a black look, as usual. I took in her breakfast,
eggs and bacon, coffee and toast, and she barely said 'Thank you'
for them, and then refused to speak another word. What about
her?"</p>

<p>"Well, the old fool says he won't wait any longer," was the
reply. "He's sure her spirit must be broken by now and she'll
agree to anything he asks."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Prince, "and I, for one, will be glad to get
rid of both of them. Business is business, I know, or I'd have
never had anything to do with it, but when we're all going to be
set up for life with plenty of cash, any risk is worth taking."
He shook his head. "Still, it's brought Larose into the picture,
and I tell you straight that I'm afraid of him, and if it wasn't
for my dogs, I would be having some very bad nights."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" scoffed the other. "We're all right." He nodded in his
turn. "Then we'll fix up about Helen."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell Jakes to do it at once," was the sharp reply.
"They're both upstairs now. He's to hustle the old fool in
roughly, and say that tomorrow we'll be willing to treat for the
ransom of them both. Remember it's to be &pound;100,000 and not a
penny under. Whoever pays, they can well afford it."</p>

<p>In the meantime, Larose was almost choking in the bitterness
of his grief and rage. He did not trouble to consider who the
'old fool' was, but he grasped most clearly from the conversation
that Helen Ardane was being subjected to horrible indignities,
for men evidently had access to her room and were actually
waiting upon her as if she were one of their own sex! He was
half-minded to pistol the two below without any warning, but he
did not know what other forces might be against him, and for the
sake of Helen he was not going to risk his own life
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The one-time driver of the Jehu car rode away and Prince
proceeded to go on with his interrupted task.</p>

<p>He knelt down, with one knee upon the sheep's body. "Come on,
dearie. I'll be very quick and make it as easy for you as I
can."</p>

<p>Larose watched the swift and dexterous manner in which he
despatched the animal. No fuss, no hesitation&mdash;just one
quick, deep cut, the neck broken, the spinal cord exposed and
severed, and in five seconds the animal's sufferings were
over.</p>

<p>Then her slayer broke the shanks of her back legs, inserted
the gamble between the tendons and had just hauled up the carcase
with the pulley and tackle, and was about to start the skinning
when the noise of hoofs was heard outside and the driver of the
Jehu came quickly galloping up.</p>

<p>"Prince! Prince!" he called out sharply as he sprang on to the
ground, "someone was on Black Gallows yesterday afternoon and has
killed Ishmail!" He pointed with outstretched arm. "His body's
over there and he's got five wounds. He was killed with a
knife."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" swore Prince, "where is he?" and the two at once
raced out of the shed.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" nodded Larose, "and now I've stirred up a hornet's
nest." He clenched his jaws together tightly. "One thing, if I
come to my end here, I'll take that fellow Prince with me."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Prince returned alone and proceeded with
great haste to skin and dress the sheep, but he was a very
different man now to the one of a few minutes ago. He was glum
and thoughtful, and frowning heavily all the time. He had nearly
finished his work when the man he had called Clem came racing
back, now carrying a rifle upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's as I said," he began shouting long before he had reached
the shed door, "and I don't believe the devil can have got away.
Ishmail must have come upon him just after half-past three, for
Roy is sure the dog was by the house up to then. The man must
have been wandering about, lost in the fog, but how he got away I
can't think. He may have fallen into the big drain and is
finished with." He nodded his head emphatically. "He hasn't left
Black Gallows since the fog lifted, that's certain. Peter was at
work by the bridge at sunrise and the fog hadn't lifted then.
He's been by the bridge ever since."</p>

<p>"You've served out a rifle to every one?" asked Prince
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, and drain or no, we'll make a thorough search
everywhere. I've told the men to hail any stranger up and shoot
instantly if he doesn't stop. There's not one here that can't put
in a bull at 500 yards. I've brought a rifle for you, too," and
he bent down from his horse and leant one up against the
door.</p>

<p>"All right," commented Prince, "and not only will we search
here, but I'll go over to Methwold and find out at the inn if any
nosey people were about yesterday."</p>

<p>"But we may be only disturbing ourselves about nothing," went
on the other, "and probably it was just a casual tourist who
strayed on to Black Gallows and fell in somewhere. Just an
ordinary man."</p>

<p>"An ordinary man," said Prince sharply, "would not have had to
inflict five wounds upon a dog like Ishmail to kill him, without
at least having one wound on himself, and remember there was no
blood on Ishmail's muzzle or upon his fangs." He spoke in a tone
of authority. "Now you go off at once and search the north banks,
and in three minutes I'll be starting for the big drain."</p>

<p>Alone again, he proceeded to work feverishly upon the sheep,
and had just finished the dressing and was methodically
proceeding to cleanse his knife, when suddenly he stopped, and
like a graven image, stood staring up at the hay loft.</p>

<p>The foot of the detective had slipped and fallen with a thud
upon the wall!</p>

<p>Seconds of intense silence followed, and then the worst
happened, for pressing against the board at the end of the loft
flooring, in order to retain a condition of perfect immobility,
Larose exerted too much force, and the board, breaking from its
fastening, fell with a resounding crash below.</p>

<p>The detective and the gangster were now staring at each other,
face to face!</p>

<p>Larose recovered from the surprise first, and his hand slipped
like lightning to his hip pocket and plucked out his automatic,
but Prince was only the fraction of a second behind him and
leaped to reach the rifle by the door.</p>

<p>He had almost got his hands upon it, when the pistol cracked,
and then with a convulsive clutch at his right side, he toppled
over on to the ground.</p>

<p>Larose was after him, like a terrier after a rat, and long
before the smoke of the pistol had risen to the height of the
loft, had dragged him back into the shed, and seeing now that he
was quite helpless, was tearing at his shirt to expose and
staunch the wound.</p>

<p>"Oh! leave me alone," he groaned, "and let me die in peace.
You've hit me in the liver, and I know I shall be bleeding
internally as well. Leave me alone, please."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the detective sternly, "I may want you to give
evidence against the others."</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;I'll&mdash;give&mdash;it&mdash;in&mdash;kingdom
&mdash;come," sighed Prince. A fleeting smile came into
his face and he whispered very faintly, "How
many&mdash;pigs&mdash;does&mdash;a&mdash;sow&mdash;have&mdash;
in&mdash;a&mdash;litter Mr. Larose?" then closing his eyes, his
jaw dropped, and he was dead.</p>

<p>Larose had all his wits about him, and darting to the door,
crouched down and peering in all directions, fully expecting that
the noise of his automatic would be bringing someone at once to
the spot. But apparently no one had heard it, for everything was
quite. Two men with rifles upon their shoulders were talking
earnestly together by the farmhouse door, while another one, also
armed, was right in front of the stables, about a quarter of a
mile away, and walking slowly along, what looked, to the
detective, like the slightly raised bank of another big drain.
The other Alsatian was not far from this last man, and moving
backwards and forwards, nosing, as before, close to the
ground.</p>

<p>Larose considered quickly. It was obvious that for the time
being he could not move from where he was, but he knew Prince
would be missed soon, and someone would come to look for him.
Then his dead body would be ghastly evidence that all was not
well on Black Gallows and that there was an enemy in the
camp.</p>

<p>So he made no bones about the matter, and quickly carrying the
body over to the trusses of straw in the corner, making sure,
however, that no blood dripped as he did so, laid it upon the top
of them and then thrust it well down at the back, pushing the
disturbed trusses again into their places. Then he heaved up the
long board that had fallen from the loft, and with some
difficulty, got it back into the position it had originally been
in. Then he hid himself again among the hay.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed before anything happened. Then another
man, a stranger to him, appeared, closely followed, to his
horror, by the Alsatian.</p>

<p>"Prince," called out the man, "where are you?" and then,
seeing the shed empty, he kicked viciously at the dog who had
suddenly become very excited and wanted to rush on in front of
him. "Get out, you beast," he cried. "Come away from that
carcase," and reluctantly the dog obeyed, going, however, no
further away from the door than a few yards and then sitting down
upon his haunches and whimpering softly.</p>

<p>The man cursed that Prince had left before finishing
everything, and snatching a long white bag from a shelf, lifted
it up round the carcase of the sheep and tied it at the top. Then
calling the dog to heel, he walked off in the direction of the
house.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Larose, "and there may be trouble again from
that quarter. The dog may come back."</p>

<p>And come back again the dog did, in a few minutes. He slipped
in the shed like a shadow, and taking no notice of the now
shrouded carcase, nosed backwards and forwards over the
floor.</p>

<p>"It's his master he smells, as I expected," breathed Larose.
"Good heavens!" and he groped stealthily for the bayonet that was
lying by his side.</p>

<p>The detective had already rehearsed the scene that was about
to follow, and when the great beast jumped up upon the heap of
straw and thrust his head down towards where the body of his
master was hidden, he bent down over the loft side and, selecting
the exact spot, drove the bayonet into the animal up to its very
hilt, just below the left shoulder.</p>

<p>There was no need for any second blow, indeed he could not
have given it, for the Alsatian, with just one long-drawn sigh,
rolled over on to the floor, his heart transfixed by the deadly
length of steel that had been plunged into it.</p>

<p>Once again Larose lost not a moment of time, and five minutes
later was back again in the loft with all traces of his last
encounter removed, as far as possible.</p>

<p>The dog slept with his master, and as their caresses had
mingled in life, so now their bloods were mingling in death.</p>

<p>The detective's eyes were beaming now, and for the first time
since he had arrived upon Black Gallows, his face was lit with
triumph.</p>

<p>"And now things will be so much easier," ran his exultant
thoughts, "and if those devils had not got their rifles, I'd
chance it straightaway. Anyhow, if I have to wait here all day,
directly its dark, I'll get away from this cursed fen, and before
dawn we'll have the place surrounded."</p>

<p>So all day long he waited patiently for the coming of
darkness, with nothing happening except that, late in the
afternoon, a man, again a stranger to him, came and fetched the
sheep carcase, remarking, as he gave a curious glance round,
"Bah! how this place stinks of blood."</p>

<p>Then towards half-past five Larose did a foolish thing, for,
in the half light of evening, thinking that dusk had at last
fallen sufficiently, he crept out round to the corner of the
building and stood for a few minutes, crouching by the wall to
get his bearings.</p>

<p>But the move proved almost disastrous to him, for suddenly
three bullets in quick succession zipped upon the wall near him;
he heard the crackings of a rifle, and turning in a startled jump
to see from which direction the bullets were coming, he saw a man
barely a hundred yards away, down upon one knee and taking
deliberate aim to fire again.</p>

<p>Then things happened very quickly. The detective raced to the
other corner to gain the shelter of the side of the building and
two more bullets zipped as he ran, the wind from one of them
actually driving across his face, but he reached the corner in
safety and with no set purpose in his mind, turned and began to
run down the side.</p>

<p>There, however, another ghastly surprise awaited him, for he
had not gone a dozen yards before he heard a car being started up
near by, and then a search-light broke the dusk, swept quickly
round, and picked him up as clearly as if it had been broad
day.</p>

<p>But if, on the one hand the search-light presaged sudden
death, on the other it pointed to a possible way of escape, for
he suddenly became aware that the open doorway of the building
was close beside him, and without a moment's hesitation he
plunged into it and banged to the heavy door.</p>

<p>There could only have been the merest fraction of a second
between him and disaster, for, as the door clanged, a perfect
fusillade of bullets broke through it.</p>

<p>He shot the two big bolts into their sockets and then started
to run up the stairs. Breathlessly gaining a small landing, he
came upon two doors. One of them was open, but the other, shut,
with the key in the lock. The open door led into three rooms, but
there was no one in them. The first was a living-room, with the
table laid already for a meal. Beyond that a small kitchen, and
then came a bedroom, with three beds in it. At the far end of
this last room was another door and opening it, he saw a narrow
flight of stairs leading to somewhere down below. There was no
key to this door, but he immediately pulled up a bed against it,
so that it could not be opened without noise.</p>

<p>Then he ran back on to the landing and tried the handle of the
closed door. It was locked, but with a great thrill at his heart,
he turned the key, and thrusting the door wide open, stepped into
the room beyond, to find himself, as he had expected, in the
presence of the amazed and startled Lady Ardane and Sir Parry
Bardell.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" he exclaimed cheerfully. "I'm a bit late, but
I've come at last, as you see."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>

THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE</h2>

<p class="first">IT had been a terrible shock for Lady Ardane
when, upon that sunny afternoon in the Abbey grounds, quick
strong hands had been laid upon her, and, struggling furiously,
she had been carried into the delivery van.</p>

<p>It was not that she was seized and held with great violence.
On the contrary, for a calm voice enjoined those who were
carrying her to be as gentle as possible, and on no account to
bruise her.</p>

<p>Naturally, she was terror-stricken, but added to that was the
awful indignity of being handled like she was. She, Helen Ardane,
who all her life had been treated with the greatest of respect,
and had never known what rough treatment was!</p>

<p>In her childhood, in those far-off days in Virginia, all
tender and loving care had been lavished upon her. In her years
of budding maidenhood she had held her court as a princess, and
her smile or the touch of her hand had been gifts then, to be
received, by her admirers, almost as a sacrament.</p>

<p>Then when she had come to Carmel Abbey as the young wife of
the wealthy Sir Charles Ardane, her life had been almost that of
a queen, for the highest in the land had paid tribute to her
youth and beauty, and in the countryside around the great
historic Abbey, she had been the one above all others to be
revered and respected as the sovereign lady who held the
livelihood and well-being of so many employees and dependants in
her hands.</p>

<p>So, the events of that afternoon, apart from their awful
terror, were a dreadful blow to her pride. It had all happened so
suddenly, too. One minute she had been free and the proud
mistress of her domain, and the next&mdash;she was a prisoner and
cut off from all that world where it was hers to order and issue
commands.</p>

<p>Once inside the van, the doors were banged to, a cloth was
pressed against her face, a rug was wound quickly round her, and
stretched out at full length upon the flooring, she was held down
by many hands, so that she should make no movement. Then one of
her arms was drawn out and she heard a calm voice say, "Steady
now, you must keep her absolutely still."</p>

<p>A moment later something was swabbed upon her arm, and she
felt the sharp prick of a needle. "Now, don't distress yourself,"
she heard the voice say. "You are not going to be hurt in any
way, but just going to be sent to sleep."</p>

<p>Then a great peace began to fall upon her. The faces above
became indistinct and faded away, she sank down and down, and
finally was conscious of nothing more for a long time.</p>

<p>Then she began to awake, and her head was lifted up gently and
she was given something to drink. Its taste was unpleasant, but
she drank it quickly, for she was very thirsty.</p>

<p>After that everything was a confused dream. She was being
jolted slowly along, and the smell of hay was strong in her
nostrils. She thought she heard a man talking, and he must have
been speaking to a horse, for he said, "Gee up, now," many times,
and often she heard the cracking of a whip.</p>

<p>The jolting ceased after a long while, and then she was lifted
up and carried into the cold night air. Then she was laid
carefully upon something soft, rugs were tucked all round her,
and once again her head was lifted up and she was given something
to drink that tasted now like hot milk.</p>

<p>"You're quite all right," came the same voice that she had
heard before. "No one's going to do you any harm, you're just
going to sleep, that's all."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes drowsily and saw the stars shining through
the trees. She thought she was dreaming and lying in a dark wood.
She closed her eyes again and dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>Next, she partly woke up, and saw that the sun was shining,
and at once someone bent over, and gave her more hot milk.
Presently she was lifted up very gently, once again came the
smell of hay, and the jolting recommenced.</p>

<p>Now she was conscious of the rumbling of wheels, and it seemed
to go on for ever and ever. Her legs began to feel stiff, and
moving them, she found that they were tied loosely at the ankles.
She stretched one hand down to unloosen them, and at once a man
with a pleasant face came from somewhere behind her and did it
for her.</p>

<p>"We'll soon be there now," he said kindly, "and then you'll be
made more comfortable."</p>

<p>Then she seemed suddenly to come to her senses altogether, and
found that she was lying in a hay cart with hay piled all around
her. She could only see the sky, and her eyes filled with tears
when she saw it was so beautiful and blue, but she felt weak and
heavy headed, and too listless to make any attempt to move.</p>

<p>Then the man who had loosened her bonds called out something,
and the cart was stopped, and a few minutes later she was sitting
up and given a basin of soup, but there must have been some drug
in the soup she was sure, for she began to feel drowsy again at
once, and very soon was asleep once more.</p>

<p>Her next awakening was in a soft bed, and opening her eyes she
found she was in quite a fair-sized room, with a door at either
end. It was scantily and shabbily furnished, with just a table, a
wardrobe, a chest of drawers and a couple of chairs. There was no
carpet upon the floor, and the one window was barred across with
thick iron bars. She was partially undressed, with her frock
hanging over the back of a chair near the bed.</p>

<p>For quite a long time she could not collect her thoughts or
remember anything of what had happened. Then a flood of memories
surged into her mind and she burst into tears. Everything had
come back to her.</p>

<p>She was in the hands of her enemies at last.</p>

<p>She remembered being seized and carried into the van, the
injection being put into her arm, the cups of hot milk, the night
in the wood, the long journey among the hay, and finally, dimly,
very dimly, being carried up some stairs in someone's arms.</p>

<p>She slipped shakily out of bed, and turning the handle of the
door nearest to her, found that it was locked. It was a thick and
heavy door of solid oak. The door at the other end of the room
was, however, ajar, and pushing it open, she found herself in a
small bathroom. The bath was old and rusted, but apparently quite
serviceable, and there was an oil heater attached. Upon a chair
nearby were two clean folded towels, a sponge, and new cake of
soap.</p>

<p>Returning to the bedroom, she looked out of the window, but
could not see for any great distance, because of a white fog.
There were no other habitations anywhere in sight, and it
appeared to her that the house she was in was situated in a big
meadow.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a sharp knock upon the locked door and a
moment later, hearing the key being turned, she jumped hastily
into bed.</p>

<p>A man entered the room, quite young and of nice appearance. He
smiled when he saw her pulling the bed clothes up to her
head.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said, in a very pleasant voice. "How do you
feel? A little bit heavy, I expect, from the sleeping draughts we
had to give you."</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked hoarsely. "What have you brought me
here for?"</p>

<p>The man seated himself upon a chair and regarded her in quite
a friendly way.</p>

<p>"There need be no mystery about anything," he said quietly,
"and I'll give you an explanation at once, so that you'll know
exactly how everything stands." He took out a cigarette and
lighted it. "You have been abducted, kidnapped, or whatever you
like to call it in order that eventually we may obtain a certain
sum of money for your release. You are not going to be hurt or
ill-treated in any way"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"and as it's
purely a matter of &pound;. s. d., and you have plenty of it, you
really need have no anxieties at all."</p>

<p>"Then how much do you want?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is not settled yet," he replied. "You see, we have
your friend, Sir Parry Bardell, here as well, and we have not
decided how much we can get out of you both." He nodded. "But it
will have to be a good sum for it means us all clearing away from
the farm where we now live, and taking up new occupations in
another part of the world." He laughed. "It's just like selling
you our land here, with you paying a good price for it."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to pay anything reasonable," she said with a
choke in her voice, "and so, I am sure, is Sir Parry, too."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "But it's not quite so easily settled as
that, for we have to consider how the money is going to be paid
over. That's the trouble, for with the whole country roused and
every police officer on the look-out for us, no cheque you might
write would be of the slightest value. We should never dare to
present it."</p>

<p>"But where am I?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"And there again," he replied at once, "there is no reason
that you should not know. As I have told you, the property is
going to be all yours very shortly, and so naturally you would
like to learn something of what you are purchasing. You are upon
the Methwold Fens, my lady, and the farm is known as Black
Gallows. It is 1600 odd acres and will carry a large number of
sheep, but my uncle and we boys have been busy in other ways of
late, and in consequence the farm has been very much neglected."
He pointed to the window. "It is nicely situated, and on a clear
day you can see the spire of Ely Cathedral. Your nearest town is
Downham Market and as the crow flies you are not much more than a
mile from the main London road." He looked at his watch and rose
to his feet. "But it's nearly five o'clock and you must have
something to eat."</p>

<p>"I don't want, anything," she replied brokenly. "I couldn't
touch a thing."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he replied. "I'll bring you some cold chicken and
ham and a small bottle of wine, but I'll get you a nice hot bath
first. It will do your head a lot of good. Oh! one thing more,"
and he paused to give her a whimsical smile, "I'm called Prince
and I'm afraid you'll have to accept me as your maid as long as
you are staying with us, for, unfortunately, you are the only
woman upon the premises." He shook his head. "But your ladyship
need never give a thought to me, even if I come in when you are
washing or dressing, for I have no personal interest in you at
all. I never allow pleasure to interfere with business, and you
are just business to me. Nothing more, you understand. I shall be
coming into this room at all times."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane blushed furiously, and her bosom rose and fell in
her emotion.</p>

<p>"I hear you," she replied, her voice shaking, "but it is a
great indignity. I shall be obliged if you will always knock, and
wait until I have answered you before you enter."</p>

<p>"But it will be quite unnecessary," he said carelessly, "for
you can regard me as your doctor, quite uninterested&mdash;your
clergyman, quite harmless&mdash;or as just the man who has come
to mend the sash-cord of the window. I repeat I have absolutely
no interest in you. I have carried you in my arms several times,
and yet honestly, I do not remember whether you have a good
figure or whether your bones protrude or not." He bowed. "You are
just a business proposition to me and to keep you in a good state
of preservation is all my concern."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the bathroom and she heard him whistling
cheerfully as he prepared the bath.</p>

<p>"All ready, your ladyship." he said with a bow, when presently
he returned, "and you won't be able to say you haven't been well
looked after." He approached the bed. "Oh! by-the-bye let me look
at your arm. I want to see the place where I gave you the
injection. You won't show it! Well, no matter, for it's sure to
be all right. I used a disinfectant before I inserted the needle.
I was a medical student once, and the knowledge I gained has come
in very useful." He bowed. "Well, I'll come back in half an hour
and you shall have your dinner then. I'll bring a lamp with me,
too."</p>

<p>She had the bath, and, greatly refreshed, partook of the meal
he had soon provided. She had now in part resigned herself to her
misfortunes, and was determined to make the best of things. She
had not forgotten Larose and Naughton Jones, and although she was
aware from Sir Arnold that they were both laid up from the
injuries they had received, yet he had told her they would both
soon be about again, and she had every confidence in them
both&mdash;she blushed ever so little&mdash;especially in
Larose.</p>

<p>But then followed long, dreary days of unvarying monotony. She
saw Prince only when he brought in her meals and half an hour
later when he returned for the tray. At first he had started
asking her every morning how she was feeling, and passing
remarks, too, about the weather, but she had either made no reply
at all or just responded in curt monosyllables, until, in the
end, he had ceased speaking to her at all, and some days, "Thank
you" were the only words uttered in the room.</p>

<p>For some reason Prince would not explain, she was allowed no
books or papers, and in consequence, in addition to looking out
of the window, her own thoughts were her only occupation. She
could see the carts and cars passing along the Ely road, and she
used to brood over how care-free and happy their occupants would
probably be. At any rate, she was sure they could have no such
troubles as were hers, and how willing they would be to help her,
she thought, too, if they only knew of the sad and lonely woman
behind these prison bars!</p>

<p>Several nights, at dusk, when the wind was in the right
direction, she heard the sound of church bells, the bells of
eventide, and tears would well up into her eyes as she thought of
how often she had sat with her little boy in the dim and shrouded
light of the old Abbey chapel.</p>

<p>She thought a lot, too, about Larose in those days, for, since
that night among the trees, her feelings towards him had
undergone a great change. She had cordially disliked him up to
then, for he had been so masterful and had treated her, not as if
she were Lady Ardane and the proud chatelaine of Carmel Abbey,
with its broad acres, but just as if she were a Mrs. Anybody on
whose behalf his services had been called in in just the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>But that night he had held her in his arms and she had been
affected as she had never been affected before.</p>

<p>As a young girl she had been given for wife to a man whom she
had learned to love and respect and in due time she had borne him
a son. But she had had no thrill of passion for him, and he had
never delved deeply into her woman's nature. He had never roused
in her what lifts man and woman, if only for a few short hours,
into a heaven upon earth, and he had never touched upon those
strings in her being, that in their vibrations make all else in
life a common thing.</p>

<p>But now had come this stranger and, far above him in station,
possessions and all that counts for honor in the social life, she
was stepping down from the pedestal and looking up to him as if
he were the sovereign ruler of her kingdom. She was often hot and
angry with herself, and yet in her inmost thoughts there was a
strange and wonderful sweetness in her homage and submission.</p>

<p>The days passed on, and then one afternoon a dense fog fell
upon the Fens, and looking out from her window she was glad of
it, because it hid the great world beyond. It was as an opiate
for her longings for freedom and soothed and calmed her as if it
were the end of everything, and she would soon sleep in peace and
be mindful of her sufferings no more.</p>

<p>But the next morning the bright sunlight was streaming through
her window again, and it brought back all her yearnings and sad
thoughts again.</p>

<p>She had just finished breakfast, and then the monotony of
everything was broken, and never again, had she only known it,
was she to be without either hopes or fears to occupy her
mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a strange voice shouting angry words
outside upon the landing, the door was opened sharply and then,
to her amazement, Sir Parry, the true and trusted friend of her
widowhood, was thrust violently into the room, to be followed
immediately by a man whom she had never seen before.</p>

<p>"Here he is," shouted the strange man loudly, "and you two are
to remain together until to-morrow and arrange how our money is
to be paid over. It's &pound;100,000 we want, and you'll have to
think over how we're going to get it. Tomorrow I shall come back
to hear what you've got to say," and with a black look that
embraced them both, he went out and slammed and locked the
door.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane almost choked in her great joy, and then running
up to Sir Parry, who was standing trembling upon the threshold of
the room, she threw her arms round his neck and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Oh! uncle dear," she sobbed, with her head buried into his
shoulder, "how glad I am to see you. I have been so
miserable."</p>

<p>The tears were streaming, too, down Sir Parry's face as he
patted her fondly upon the cheek. "My darling Helen," he
exclaimed brokenly, "how you must have suffered, too!"</p>

<p>For a few minutes they stood clinging to each other, and then
gently disengaging herself from his arms, she began wiping the
happy tears away.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," whispered Sir Parry in great emotion. "It
will soon be over now, and then we shall all be happy again."</p>

<p>They sat down upon the bed, side by side, and they told each
other all that had happened since they had last been speaking to
each other that afternoon in the Abbey grounds.</p>

<p>It appeared that Sir Parry's sufferings had been much the same
as her own. He had been drugged like she had been, and the same
dreadful journey had been his through those long weary hours.</p>

<p>They calmed down presently, and then Sir Parry, holding her
hand all the time, began discussing everything in a practical and
business-like way. They were going to let him go away on the
morrow, he said, and he would raise every penny he could find and
bring back the ransom. But they had warned him, with many
horrible threats, that if he gave the slightest inkling to anyone
why he wanted the money, or where he'd been, or what had
happened, then he would never see her again, for they were going
to poison her and escape away.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane trembled and shuddered as she listened, and then,
clinging to him tightly, averred that every penny of the money
would be returned to him, for, directly she was free, she would
raise it from the Ardane estates.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, in the midst of their talking, a sharp, vicious
crack came up from just below them, and Lady Ardane, her nerves
all on edge, sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"What was that?" she asked with widely-opened eyes. "It
sounded like a pistol being fired."</p>

<p>Sir Parry looked startled, too, and seemed very frightened,
but the sound was not repeated, and after a moment, he exclaimed
reassuringly, "No, no, it was not a pistol. It was only the
cracking of a whip. Someone was going by on a horse."</p>

<p>So their conversation was resumed, and hour after hour they
considered how the huge sum of &pound;100,000 could be
raised.</p>

<p>Then gradually, very gradually, a subtle feeling of
embarrassment began to mar Lady Ardane's supreme happiness in
being re-united to her friend, for Sir Parry's affection for her
became so effusive, and he kept on kissing her, and would not let
go her hand. He kissed her once on the lips, too, and asked her
to kiss him back. Finally, she rose and moved away from him and
sat down upon a chair, but he followed after her, and moving up
another chair close beside her, again wanted to hold her
hand.</p>

<p>Then when, just after noon, the same man who had thrust Sir
Parry so unceremoniously into the room appeared with the dinner
tray and plumped it down upon the table and retired again without
a word, Sir Parry wanted to drink out of the same glass she was
drinking from, and she did not like it at all. He never took his
eyes off her either, and in the end she became really frightened.
At last a remark he made almost terrified her.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," he said nervously, and evading her eyes,
"my being alone with you here until to-morrow will compromise
you, if anyone hears of it, but we must try and keep it from
everyone and get married the first moment we can. I'll bring back
a special license with me and it'll be as my wife that you will
return to Carmel Abbey."</p>

<p>Her heart almost stood still, but she had perfect control of
herself.</p>

<p>"No, uncle," she replied firmly, "I shall never marry again.
I'm determined upon that."</p>

<p>He looked very upset, and shook his head solemnly. "But you
must think it over," he said, "for a woman's reputation is the
most precious possession that she has"&mdash;his eyes filled with
tears&mdash;"and I could not have a breath of scandal against
you, for anything in the world."</p>

<p>Then she began to doubt him, and was sure that he was
deceiving her in some way, for he said suddenly, "And I'll be a
good father to little Charles." His face brightened as if he were
imparting good news. "He's included in the ransom money, of
course, and they will give him up directly it is paid."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in London," he replied. He hesitated. "They won't
tell me exactly where, but I think he's in Kensington."</p>

<p>"Who got him for them?" She asked, and her voice was now as
hard and stern as a cross-examiner in a court.</p>

<p>He hesitated again. "I'm not quite certain," he replied. "They
never told me, but it was one of the servants, I think. Charles
was hurried on board that yacht they have, and they said he was
in London the next day."</p>

<p>Then an instinct told her that he was lying, and had no
knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, for his eyes had been
everywhere but upon her when he had spoken, and he picked his
words slowly, as if he were making it all up as he went
along.</p>

<p>From that moment a great change took place in her, and she was
no longer the weeping, clinging creature broken all to pieces by
her misfortunes. Instead, she had become all at once, in the
space of a few seconds, so it seemed, a strong and resolute
woman, nerving herself to face new dangers and deal with them as
they came.</p>

<p>But she was tactful with it, too, and to check the amorous
advances of Sir Parry, without any appearance of noticing them,
at once gave him some work to do. "Now you clean out that bath-heater," she said sharply, "there's something wrong with the
carrier of the wick, and you'll have to take it all to pieces. I
can't raise it up far enough to get any heat in the water," and
she herself began remaking her bed and shaking up the mattress
violently.</p>

<p>But the tasks could not last forever, and Sir Parry was soon
back in the bedroom again. She would not now, however, allow him
to come near her. "I'm hot and tired," she said crossly, "and
want to think. So, leave me alone, please, and don't talk any
more."</p>

<p>He received the rebuff with a disagreeable frown, and then
with his eyes still fixed intently upon her, began muttering
angrily to himself. Some of his words she did not catch, but
others she could not help hearing, and they almost froze her
blood in fear. He seemed like a man who was going out of his
mind, for he muttered on and on and on.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned and dusk began to fall. She lit the lamp,
wondering, with a lump in her throat, how long the light would
last if it were turned very low.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the silence outside was abruptly broken, and
three loud reports in quick succession came from somewhere close
near to the house, and rushing to the window, she flung up the
bottom sash and pushed out her head as far out as the bars would
allow.</p>

<p>The light was fading quickly but objects close near could be
picked out distinctly.</p>

<p>She heard hoarse shouts coming from round the side of the
building, that were answered immediately by someone in a slow-moving car in front of the building, that was then instantly
brought to a standstill, with a jerk. Then its searchlight was
switched on and in two seconds focused straight upon the house, a
man at the same time springing out and dropping upon one knee to
level a rifle.</p>

<p>The rifle cracked, once, twice, three times, and then the
whole building seemed to shake as the house door was banged
violently to. Then she heard both bolts shot into their sockets
and for a few seconds silence reigned.</p>

<p>Hurried steps sounded upon the stairs, about two minutes of
silence followed, then the key in the lock of her door was
turned, the door was pushed open and&mdash;Larose stepped into
the room.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said quietly, but with his breath coming
quickly, "I'm a bit late, but I've come at last, as you see."</p>

<p>Then before either she or Sir Parry could utter a word, the
whole demeanor of the detective altered.</p>

<p>"Take that lamp away," he cried sharply to Lady Ardane. He
pointed to the open door of the bathroom. "Go in there and put it
on the floor. Shut the door behind you, and wait until I tell you
to come out."</p>

<p>Then, when she had at once complied, as if it were the most
natural thing to do, he advanced menacingly to Sir Parry, who,
with his mouth open and his face a ghastly pallor, was trembling
violently.</p>

<p>"You devil," he hissed, "I know all about you. Up with your
hands! Have you got any weapon on you?" He passed his hands
rapidly over his body. "Any poison?" he asked, and he plucked the
wallet out of the trembling man's breast pocket. Then he pushed
him violently into a corner. "And there you stay," he went on,
"and the slightest movement and I'll blow your brains out."</p>

<p>"But don't tell her," wailed Sir Parry in a hoarse whisper and
with tears welling up into his eyes. "I only did it because I
loved her so." He held up his hands imploringly. "She must never
know, and I'll destroy myself presently."</p>

<p>"And it's the best thing you can do," replied Larose sharply.
The tone of his voice changed in an instant, and he called out
cheerfully, "You can come in, Lady Ardane, but, don't bring the
lamp with you, and keep out of the line of the window, whatever
you do. They'll be firing in, in a few moments."</p>

<p>Then he sprang to the window and, bending down, with his head
just above the sill, made a trumpet of his hands. "I'm Larose,"
he shouted in loud and clarion tones. "Gilbert Larose, and here's
my visiting card," and at the same moment he fired twice with his
pistol at the stationary motor car, before he bobbed down.</p>

<p>"Had to do it!" he explained quickly to Lady Ardane. "I wanted
to let them know that I was armed, so that they'll hesitate about
coming too close. I don't want them to start upon breaking in
that door below. I gave them my name, too, to set them thinking.
They may bolt away now, not knowing who else is in the
neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm so thankful!" exclaimed Lady Ardane brokenly. "I
can't tell you how I feel."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied Larose cheerfully, "but down upon
the floor at once," and that his advice was good was evident
almost immediately, for bullet after bullet came crashing through
the window. The panes were smashed to atoms and the bullets
scattered the plaster upon the wall in all directions. The
fusillade lasted about half a minute and then all was still.</p>

<p>"And that's about all they dare to do," went on Larose in
matter-of-fact tones, "for if they bang any more, they'll be
afraid of attracting attention in the surrounding villages and
bringing people here to know what's happened."</p>

<p>Ignoring Sir Parry altogether, he asked Lady Ardane what was
in the other room, and where the window was there. She told him
and that there was no window, only a skylight.</p>

<p>"Well, you stand by the door," he enjoined, "and I'll just
have a wash. Call me instantly if you hear the slightest
sound."</p>

<p>In the meantime an anxious conference was being held by five
men, huddled together behind the stationary car outside.</p>

<p>Their faces were white and grim and they looked at one another
with uneasy and furtive eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't like the look of things," said a man with a big scar
across his forehead. His voice shook. "Where's Prince and where's
Juno? I believe they've had a knife into them, too. It's all up,
I say, and there may be a mob of police round here in no time
now. We'd better cut whilst we can."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed the tall man, Clem, sharply, "don't you be
a blithering coward, Peter. Prince will turn up soon, I'm
certain. He's a match for a dozen like that Larose, and not one
to be knifed quietly behind his back." He sneered scornfully.
"We're not going to lose our heads and be beaten by one single
man." He pointed to the racing stables, still held under the
ghostly rays of the searchlight. "That fool there made the
mistake of his life when he bawled out he was Larose, for
everyone's heard of the devil and knows he always works alone.
Prince says it's notorious he always spies out everything by
himself to get all the credit, and never asks for any help until
the very end." He was most emphatic. "No, we can be quite sure
that no one knows he's here." He put his head round the side of
the car and shook his fist in the direction of the shattered
window. "We've got the devil in a trap right enough, and it's
only a question of keeping him there and then we'll be quite safe
and nothing will happen."</p>

<p>Roy Fensum, a dark man, but with a face now of a horrible
sickly color, swore an obscene oath. "And I can see all that's
happened," he exclaimed savagely. "It's as plain as day to me. He
came on to Black Gallows yesterday and got lost in that fog. Then
Ishmail nosed him out somehow, but he managed to kill the brute
and find his way to the stables here. Then he hid in that shed
with the hay loft that I caught him sneaking out of just now.
He's been there all last night and all today." His voice rose
excitedly. "Yes, he's been on Black Gallows for more than twenty-four hours and that means for certain that he's all alone and no
one knows where he is, or the police would have been here long
ago. If we wait&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how can we get at him?" broke in another man with a
scowl. "He's got a gun on him and I've heard tell he's the best
pistol shot in Australia."</p>

<p>"Starve him out," snapped Fensum, "and the old fool and woman,
too. The only thing, we must watch the stable on both sides and
never give him a chance of breaking away. The moon'll be out in
half an hour and then we'll shift this car back a couple of
hundred yards." He laughed mockingly. "I'll bet he's feeling
pretty glum."</p>

<p>But had he been only there to see him, Larose was not feeling
at all glum. On the contrary, refreshed by a good wash, he was
squatted on the floor just opposite to Lady Ardane, and she was
pouring out a glass of wine for him as he was eating sparingly of
some of the ham and chicken left over from her dinner with Sir
Parry Bardell.</p>

<p>Lady Ardane was looking quite a different woman now, for her
face was no longer strained and the shadows had all gone from her
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"And it can't be long," Larose told her cheerfully, "before we
are rescued. Any moment, in fact, but most probably to-morrow.
I've got two good men helping me. They know in which direction I
was making my enquiries, and they'll soon ferret along the trail.
Then there's another man, only seven miles from here, and he'll
be looking for me, too. He's an ex-policeman and knows exactly
where I was coming. He's been away from home to-day, but he'll be
back to-night, and if I am any judge of character, hearing
nothing about me, he'll be going to look where he told me to
leave my car and finding it still there&mdash;then I don't know
exactly what he will do. He'll probably, however, ring up the
police at Downham Market and then"&mdash;he laughed
merrily&mdash;"the fat will be in the fire for those gentlemen
outside."</p>

<p>She watched him as he spoke, and she thrilled with a feeling
of great happiness, which she took no thought to analyse.</p>

<p>Her dress was soiled and crumpled by the rough usage it had
undergone, for a week and more she had been denied all the little
toilet luxuries that make a woman pleasing! She was squatting in
semi-darkness upon the bare boards of a room that had at all
times been shabby and comfortless! The night air was rushing in
through a window that had now no panes! There were bullet marks
upon the wall just above her head! She was in an atmosphere of
strife and violence and sudden death! There were men near her
whom she knew would have no compunction in committing any horror
to hide their evil deeds and yet&mdash;she was quite happy!</p>

<p>The man who had been so often in her thoughts had come into
her life again, and all faith that she could render, she had in
him. She was no longer the proud mistress of Carmel Abbey, and he
was not a policeman from Scotland Yard. They were just man and
woman together, and in unspoken words the old, old story was
being told once again.</p>

<p>Only one thing marred the absolute harmony of everything, for
Larose would not tell her where her son was. He assured her that
the boy was all right, and inclining his head ever so slightly in
the direction of Sir Parry, added that although for the moment it
was a secret, she would nevertheless soon know.</p>

<p>And all this time Sir Parry had remained seated in the corner
where Larose had pushed him, with his hands clasped together and
his eyes staring on to the floor. He seemed like a man in a
trance and oblivious to all that was going on around him.</p>

<p>Presently the moon rose in its cold and silvered majesty and
the search light on the car was switched off. "But it'll be death
to anyone to look," warned Larose speaking rather loudly, "for
they'll be watching during every second of the night."</p>

<p>Then came the question of how they would all sleep, and Larose
issued his orders in no uncertain manner.</p>

<p>"I'll push your bed up to the end of the room," he said to
Lady Ardane. "Sir Parry will sleep where he is, I see his
overcoat is here, and I'll lie down by the door."</p>

<p>"But you'll both be so cold," protested Lady Ardane. "I have
two blankets and you are quite welcome to one." But the detective
would not hear of it, and speaking both for himself and Sir Parry
who, however, made no comment, assured her they would be quite
warm enough if they kept out of the current of the draught.</p>

<p>Then gradually silence fell upon the room, with surely as
strange an assortment of room-mates there as could be found
anywhere. Lady Ardane had climbed into the bed and slipped off
her dress under the clothes, Sir Parry was leaning back heavily
in the corner from which he had still never moved, and Larose was
lying before the door with his head upon his arm.</p>

<p>An hour passed and they were all awake, two hours and then Sir
Parry's head sagged upon his chest and he began to snore lightly.
A cloud passed over the moon, and then, with the room in total
darkness, Larose heard soft foot-falls come from the direction of
the bed. Then he felt a hand groping for him, but he did not move
because he knew whose it was. His heart beat terribly and he
trembled as if he were in an ague.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose, I must speak to you," breathed a voice so faintly
that he could hardly hear it, and Lady Ardane bent down to
whisper in his ear. He turned his head so that he could take in
what she was going to say, and then his lips brushed against
hers. Instinctively then, and acting upon an impulse that he made
no attempt to control, he raised himself up nearer and kissed
them, and for one brief second they were not withdrawn. Her
burning face was close against his and he could feel her heart
beating as violently as was his own. Then with a quick movement
she drew herself away.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to have done that," she reproved, but so gently
that there was no sting in the reproof. "Still, I'm so happy in
your coming that I could forgive you almost anything for the
moment."</p>

<p>"But it was not nice of me to do it," whispered back Larose
sharply, and now in a fury of remorse. "It was taking advantage
of your overwrought feelings and I humbly beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"It is all right," came the soft reply, and the darkness hid
her smile. She touched his arm lightly. "Now I have a lot of
things to ask you," and then he could feel that she was rising to
her feet, "but wait a moment until I fetch a blanket. I'm cold
and shivering here."</p>

<p>But it was not the cold that made her shiver. It was the kiss
that he had given her and the thought that she had had no wish to
draw her lips away.</p>

<p>She was back in a few seconds. "Here's the other one for you,"
she whispered. "No, don't be foolish." She laughed softly. "You
are not the only one who can give orders here." Something of her
old imperious manner came back. "Now tell me at once about my
boy."</p>

<p>Then with the blankets wrapped round them and sitting so close
together that each could feel the warmth of the other's body,
Larose told her most of what had happened, refraining, however,
from all mention of Sir Parry in any way.</p>

<p>A long silence followed when he had finished, and then she
asked hesitatingly, as if fearful of the answer he would give,
"But who then, has been the instigator of it all?" He could feel
her trembling against him.
"Who&mdash;has&mdash;been&mdash;my&mdash;enemy&mdash;all&mdash;along!"</p>

<p>He answered her very solemnly. "You know quite well, Lady
Ardane," he said, "that the strongest urge in life is what we
call love, and while the passion of a man for a woman can be the
most glorious thing on earth, yet at the same time it can be the
most terrible one. It can so warp his mind that while sane in
everything else, he is stark, staring mad in that one
particular." He picked his words carefully. "Well, a certain man
conceived a passion for you that he knew was hopeless and with no
fulfillment&mdash;he went mad. That is all. I cannot tell you
more now, but unhappily you will have to learn all one day, and
then it will be a great sorrow for you." He spoke sharply. "Now,
not another question, please."</p>

<p>Her voice shook. "I understand a little," she said slowly,
"and I don't want to know any more."</p>

<p>"Well, you go back to your bed now," he went on. "We must both
try and get some sleep."</p>

<p>"I'll go back in a few minutes," she sighed, "but I was very
cold there and I'm quite warm now. We won't talk."</p>

<p>Then a deep silence fell upon them, and gradually, very
gradually, he felt that she was leaning heavily and more heavily
against him. Then her breathing became slow and regular and he
knew she was asleep. The red head was now upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Poor little woman," he murmured, "and she'll be so sorry for
it later." He smiled sadly. "Part of my dream has at all events
come true"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"but there is no blind to pull
down." His face became sad again "and alas, there is no need of
it."</p>

<p>The night waxed and waned, it was cloudy and then fine, and
the moon and the searchlight playing hide-and-seek together.
Always, one of them was shining on the building, and, perhaps,
the moon was curious as to what was going on inside that chamber
with the shattered window panes.</p>

<p>Then finally the night was over and Larose, who had been
dozing on and off a score of times, saw that the dawn was coming
and that objects were now distinguishable in the room. He pushed
against Lady Ardane very gently and she awoke suddenly and looked
at him with startled eyes. Then face, neck, and the opening to
her bosom crimsoned furiously.</p>

<p>Larose pointed to the still slumbering Sir Parry. "Go back to
your bed," he whispered and she obeyed instantly. Then, once more
ensconced among her pillows, she gave him a roguish smile and
closed her eyes as if she were going to sleep again.</p>

<p>An hour and more passed and then with the sun high in the
heavens, she whispered to him that she was going into the
bathroom.</p>

<p>"And don't you come out until I call you," he replied sternly.
"I am going to see if they are still on the watch and they will
probably fire again. So don't be afraid. I want to make them
fire, to draw attention in the villages that something unusual is
going on."</p>

<p>Then the moment she had gone into the bathroom and shut the
door, he sprang up and shook Sir Parry roughly.</p>

<p>"Wake up," he whispered sharply. "The time has come."</p>

<p>"What time?" whispered back Sir Parry hoarsely, and from the
expression upon his face it was plain that a realisation of all
his terrors had come back to him.</p>

<p>"The time for you to decide what you are going to do," replied
Larose, "and you have only a few minutes to do it, for Lady
Ardane will be back very quickly. Now listen to me." He regarded
the wretched man with a face as hard and pitiless as a stone.
"Consider your position. The police may be here any moment, and
they will arrest you directly they come. You tried to poison me,
but I shall say nothing about that, for it was one of the risks
of my profession. Your wits were pitted against mine, and you
showed yourself the better man."</p>

<p>"I was mad," gasped Sir Parry, "I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, you were mad," snapped Larose, "you have been mad
all along. Well, I'll lay no charge against you there, but you'll
be arrested for conspiracy, and you'll have to stand your
trial."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I loved her so," wailed Sir Parry, "and as I knew she
would never marry me for love, because I am too old, I thought
perhaps she would marry me out of gratitude if her child was
stolen and I got him back for her. So I took young Clive into my
confidence and he said he knew some smugglers who would arrange
it all for me. Then it got out of my hands, for they are evil men
who will do anything. I could not restrain them and it got worse
and worse, and I became a would-be murderer myself."</p>

<p>"But I am quite aware of all that," said Larose quickly, "and
it's a waste of time your telling me," His voice was cold and
hard. "I want to know what you are going to do."</p>

<p>"But what can I do," gasped Sir Parry. "I can't undo what I
have done now."</p>

<p>Larose pointed to the broken window. "You can go and stand
there," he said sternly, "and your friends, your co-conspirators
who have brought such misery upon this poor woman, will put a
bullet through your head and you will escape everything, and it
will all be over. Button up your jacket and put my cap on, and
then they'll think that they are firing at me."</p>

<p>Sir Parry recoiled in horror. "You mean me to be killed?" he
gasped. He shook his head. "I daren't do it."</p>

<p>"Think of the shame that is coming to you!" hissed Larose.
"You will stand in the dock, and the story will be told, how,
night after night, you used to creep up into that corridor and,
standing upon that box, watch Lady Ardane disrobe. The Crown
Prosecutor will describe your gloating eyes, how the bestiality
of an old man's mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop," choked Sir Parry, "I can't bear it."</p>

<p>"Lady Ardane will be there," went on Larose pitilessly. "She
will hear how her best friend and a man old enough to be her
father, spied upon her in her most private movements and ravished
her nightly with his eyes; how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough," exclaimed Sir Parry springing up. "I'll do
it; but push me there, so that I don't try to draw back."</p>

<p>For the first time, the detective felt a little pity for the
wretched man whom he was sending to his doom. "Your death will be
quite painless," he said kindly, "for you will not feel anything,
and not even hear the bullet that will kill you."</p>

<p>"Shake hands, Mr. Larose," sobbed Sir Parry. "I'd like to feel
that I die with someone who has pity for me, by my side."</p>

<p>But the detective drew back sharply. "No, Sir Parry," he
replied with the utmost coldness, "I cannot, for I draw the line
at you. I have shaken hands with murderers who were about to die,
but you&mdash;you are worse than any of them."</p>

<p>The scorn in his voice braced the doomed man like a deep
draught of wine, and he drew himself up proudly. "Very well," he
said calmly, "then I would prefer to die alone," and with not the
slightest hesitation and with steady steps he walked over to the
window and stood full before it.</p>

<p>Half a minute of breathless silence followed, and then Sir
Parry remarked calmly. "Here it comes. He's resting his rifle
upon the bonnet, of the car. I think it's the man they call Clem,
Clem Lamb. He boasts he is a very good shot."</p>

<p>Then two bullets came crashing into the room in quick
succession. They missed and buried themselves into the wall
behind. Sir Parry stood quite still. He had not flinched a hair's
breadth.</p>

<p>"You're a brave man!" exclaimed Larose hoarsely, "and I will
shake hands with you now."</p>

<p>Then, as Sir Parry, with a cold smile, stretched back his
right hand for Larose to grasp, a bullet struck him square in the
middle of his forehead and he fell back dead, into the
detective's arms.</p>

<p>The crack of the rifle died away and Larose called out
shrilly. "Don't come in yet, Lady Ardane. Sir Parry's killed.
They got him with a bullet in the head," and a gasp of horror
came from behind the bathroom door.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>

HELEN ARDANE</h2>

<p class="first">AT about nine o'clock upon the night of the
evening when Larose had burst so unceremoniously into the chamber
of Lady Ardane above the racing stables upon Black Gallows,
Naughton Jones, accompanied by his two very criminal-looking
associates, stalked into the coffee-room of the King's Arms, in
Downham Market as if he were the now proprietor taking over, and
demanded a hot supper for three, at once.</p>

<p>There were two men already in the coffee-room, partaking of a
cold supper of bread and cheese and onions, when he entered, and
they regarded the little party curiously, but Mr. Jones' friends,
notwithstanding the intent scrutiny to which they were subjected,
and which made them kick each other slily under the table many
times, partook of a highly satisfactory meal of ham and eggs,
washed down with copious draughts of good, strong beer.</p>

<p>Proceeding into the yard early the next morning, Jones
observed the same two men again, now attending to a motor bicycle
outfit in one of the stable stalls, and after hesitating a
moment, he turned back into the hotel and made a few enquiries
about them from the landlord, the young person behind the bar,
the waiter, and the boots.</p>

<p>Then returning into the yard, he found that they had gone
away, but that the motor bicycle was still there. However, a few
minutes later he overtook them as they were walking along very
slowly, just before they arrived at where was situated the police
station of the town, and he stopped to address them.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardons," he said sharply, and as if he were
speaking to inferiors, "but are you by any chance waiting for a
Mr. Gilbert Larose?"</p>

<p>The men seemed as surprised as if they had received a very
sudden and unexpected slap in the face, and then the older of the
two asked gruffly, "What the devil do you mean?"</p>

<p>Jones made a careless motion with his hand. "You have a motor
bicycle outfit of the make used generally by the authorities, you
walk like policemen upon a beat, and it is is my opinion that you
are plain-clothes men from the Yard. Also, I have learnt that the
morning before last you were closeted for more than an hour with
a gentleman whose description exactly tallies to that of my
friend, Mr. Larose." He spoke as if the matter were quite
settled. "Therefore, I take it for granted that you are now
waiting for him."</p>

<p>The men appeared staggered. "Who are you," asked the one who
had spoken before, "and what business is it of yours?"</p>

<p>"My name is Naughton Jones," was the haughty reply, "and if my
surmises are correct, kindly follow me into the station here. I
may be able to be of service to you, and you may not be without
service to me."</p>

<p>Without a word then, they followed him into the police
station, and soon all three were in the presence of the inspector
there.</p>

<p>"I am Naughton Jones," announced Jones grandly, "and I am
close upon the heels of the gang who recently abducted Lady Helen
Ardane, of Carmel Abbey, also, if I am not mistaken, upon the
heels of the Antwerp-Rotterdam coterie of illicit drug
traffickers, too." He bowed gravely. "I require your assistance
in effecting the arrests."</p>

<p>The inspector thrilled at his words. Downham Market was a
well-behaved little town, the chief offenders against the law
there being, in the main, drunks, and small boys who were caught
riding bicycles at night without lights. So prospects of
distinction and promotion for him were, in consequence, never at
any time bright, but the world famous case of the abduction of
the beautiful Lady Ardane and the rounding-up of a dope-traffic
gang&mdash;ah! those were very different offences altogether, and
might alter the whole course of his life.</p>

<p>He knew Naughton Jones, well by reputation, and association
with that great investigator would be another feather in his cap.
So, he listened with profound attention.</p>

<p>"The matter is quite straightforward," went on Jones.
"I&mdash;&mdash;" He hesitated. "Mr. Larose and I were going
through a house upon the sands of Holkham Bay, where certain
members of the gang who were concerned in the abduction had been
hiding, and I came upon two recently-purchased books of an
unusual and abstruse character. Then from certain facts that I
deduced, I traced the purchase of these books to a shop in
Cambridge, and learnt that they had been despatched to a Mr. C.
Lamb, at the Southery Post Office, seven miles from here.
Yesterday, however, upon making enquiries, I was informed by the
young woman in charge there that she had no knowledge at all of
this Mr. Lamb. As far as she knew, she had never seen him, and
certainly did not know where he resided, but she remembered the
coming of the books most distinctly and that they had been called
for by a Thomas Jowles, whom she knows quite well, and who keeps
the inn at the little village of Methwold."</p>

<p>"I know him, too," broke in the Inspector grimly. "He's a
fellow of not too good a character and we've had trouble with him
several times. Trading after hours, etc., and suspected of being
a poacher."</p>

<p>"Well, the matter is very simple," said Jones. "We have only
to learn from him where this C. Lamb is living and raid the
premises, and without doubt we shall find both Lady Ardane and
Sir Parry Bardell there." He looked sharply at the inspector.
"You are the Clerk of Petty Sessions here and can issue a search
warrant."</p>

<p>'The inspector nodded. "Yes, I can issue a warrant all
right"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"but how, Mr. Jones, do you
connect this Mr. Lamb so positively with the abductors of Lady
Ardane?"</p>

<p>Naughton Jones spoke very sharply. "I have seen him, sir," he
replied, "in company with certain members of the gang, before,
however, we were aware that they were the gang. He is a tall,
spare man, with a long face and big nose, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" broke in Hale, the elder of the two men who had been
accompanying Larose, "that's the man we're after, tall, long
face, and big nose." He turned excitedly to the inspector. "It's
quite all right. We can go straight ahead."</p>

<p>"Of course it's all right," snapped Jones, "or I shouldn't be
here." He looked impressively at the inspector. "I know this Lamb
personally, sir, and when disguised, have actually spoken to him.
One of the men who was with them is called Prince, and he is
wanted for the murder of that unknown man who was found shot upon
that ditchside on the Fakenham road last week." He turned round
to Hale. "And where is Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, sir," replied Hale, looking very troubled,
"and are getting quite anxious about him. We last saw him the day
before yesterday and were to have met him the same evening at six
o'clock, but he didn't turn up. We know, however, in which
direction he was going and have traced him up to within two miles
of Swaffham. He was enquiring at all the garages for a party who
had recently purchased two valve-caps for a grey Jehu car, but he
doesn't appear to have reached Swaffham, for none of the garages
report any enquiries having been made there. Our only hope is
that he went to one particular garage, the proprietor of which is
at present away, and learnt what he wanted to know there, but we
shan't be able to get in touch with this man until tomorrow." He
took out his handkerchief and wiped over his forehead. "It looks
an ugly business to me."</p>

<p>The inspector was a man of action, and rose at once to his
feet. "How many men do you think we shall want, Mr. Jones!"</p>

<p>"I have two," replied Jones. "There are these gentlemen here,"
he nodded. "Come yourself, and bring three others. Can you raise
them, or should we ring up King's Lynn!"</p>

<p>"No, no, I've got them," exclaimed the inspector, quickly, and
anxious that at all costs the matter should not pass out of his
hands. "That will make nine of us altogether. Meet me in ten
minutes at the west end of the town."</p>

<p>"And come armed," said Jones significantly, as he prepared to
leave the room. "Truncheons will not be sufficient here."</p>

<p>Less than three-quarters of an hour later then, two cars and
the motor bicycle outfit pulled up, by pre-arrangement, about a
hundred yards short of the Methwold Inn, kept by one Thomas
Jowles, licensed to sell beer, wines, spirits and tobacco.</p>

<p>"I'll go in with one of my assistants," said Jones, "and then
if the fellow has anything to hide, he won't, perhaps, be quite
so much upon his guard as if we all appear together," and so,
accompanied by Bloggs, the one time Limehouse Bruiser, he made at
once for the inn.</p>

<p>The tap-room was unoccupied except for a big, heavy-looking
man who was reading a newspaper behind the bar. He was unshaven
and rather dirty-looking. His face was large and full, and he had
small eyes, set very close together. He rose leisurely to his
feet when the two appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jowles, I presume," said Jones very politely.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the man, "I'm Thomas Jowles," and he gave a hard
intent stare at his visitors.</p>

<p>"Well, we're not exactly customers," explained Jones, "but we
may be after you have answered a question or two." He spoke very
casually. "You know Mr. Lamb, I believe?"</p>

<p>The man's face puckered instantly into a frown and he looked
quickly from Jones to his companion, who, according to
instructions, was standing in the background.</p>

<p>"Lamb!" he exclaimed slowly, and as if he were putting a great
tax upon his memory. He shook his head. "No, I don't know any
gent of that name."</p>

<p>"He's tall and slight, with a long face and rather big nose,"
went on Jones, still speaking quite casually.</p>

<p>"No, I've never heard of him," said the innkeeper
convincingly. "Of course, I may have seen him, but I'm a bad one
at all times for faces and I get a lot of strangers in here."</p>

<p>"Think again, Mr. Jowles," said Jones sternly, and with all
the pleasantry now gone out of his tones. "You remember him all
right."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said the man doggedly. "I've never heard of
him."</p>

<p>"Then why," asked Jones very slowly, and raising a warning
finger to emphasise his words, "did you, three weeks ago, last
Tuesday, pick up a parcel of books from the Southery Post Office,
addressed to a Mr. C. Lamb?"</p>

<p>The man's face became as black as thunder. "I never picked up
any parcel for anyone," he blustered, "and he's a ruddy liar who
says I did."</p>

<p>"But the young woman in the Post Office remembers the incident
most clearly," snapped Jones, "and it's no good your attempting
to deny it."</p>

<p>A crafty look came into the man's face. "Then does this Mr.
Lamb accuse me of stealing it?" he asked. "If so, bring him here
and I'll deal with him myself." He sneered. "You're not this Mr.
Lamb, apparently." and ducking under the counter of the bar, he
advanced threateningly towards Naughton Jones, remarking coarsely
at the same time, "Get out."</p>

<p>Whereupon the ex-bruiser thought it time to take part in the
conversation, and in a round of extreme brevity stretched the
innkeeper upon the floor. Then when the great investigator was
examining the extent of the man's injuries, Bloggs ducked under
the counter in his turn, and with a skill and dexterity born of
long practice, absorbed 'two pints' in the twinkling of an eye.
He was back again behind his master before the latter had
pronounced that the landlord was all right, and safe, now, to be
allowed to recuperate by himself.</p>

<p>Leaving the inn, Jones crossed over to a little general shop
upon the other side of the road and made some enquiries that
heartened him considerably, and in no small measure compensated
for the disappointing interview at the inn. The woman there knew
nothing of the names of any cars, but she had many times seen a
tall man, with a long face, drive up to the inn in a grey-colored
one and stop there for quite a long time. She had no idea who he
was, but pointed out the direction from which he always came.</p>

<p>Returning to the waiting cars, Jones reported all that had
happened. "But we are hot upon the trail," he added confidently,
"and the gang are close here. Now follow me, for I have another
good card to play."</p>

<p>At the first turning, then, off the tarred road, he stopped
his car and the others followed suit. "Where does this road lead
to?" he asked the inspector. "It looks pretty muddy and as if it
isn't often used."</p>

<p>"It's a by-road to Feltwell village," replied the inspector,
"but very few people take it, because the surface is always bad.
There's only one place you pass on the way and that's a farm
called Black Gallows, belonging to a man named Fensum."</p>

<p>"Who is he," asked Jones, "do you know anything about
him!"</p>

<p>"Not much," was the reply, "but I've been there once about two
Alsatian dogs he's got. There were complaints that they had been
straying and killing sheep, but I couldn't bring it home to
them."</p>

<p>"Well, you all get out," ordered Jones quickly, "and we'll go
down this road and look for the imprint of a nearly new tyre that
has got one square in the middle of its tread almost cut away. I
shaved it down low myself, and it ought to show up clearly in
this mud. It's a Nathan cover with the lines of boldly cushioned
squares. It's the offside wheel and upon the car of the man we
want."</p>

<p>They all jumped out on to the road and walking in line, with
their eyes glued upon the surface, proceeded slowly along.</p>

<p>"A car's been here quite recently," said Jones, after a
moment, "but it isn't the one we want. Its tyres are much too
small."</p>

<p>Nothing happened for about a hundred yards, and then one of
the plainclothes men called out gleefully, "Hullo! here's
something that looks like it. There's a square missing here."</p>

<p>They all bent over the imprint he indicated and then the face
of Jones flushed deeply, but he remarked quite calmly, "Yes,
that's it, and there's another and another, still." He looked
round with an exultant smile. "I have my methods and they seldom
fail. On to this Black Gallows, my friends."</p>

<p>They jumped back in great excitement into their cars and
proceeded quickly along the road, but they had not gone very far
before they came upon a man standing by a car that was stationary
close near a plantation of small trees. They all slowed down as
they approached and then the man by the car called out, "Hullo!
Inspector Bain. Stop, please. I want you." His face was very
anxious. "Are you by any chance looking for the detective,
Gilbert Larose?"</p>

<p>Explanations quickly followed, and then the man jumped back
into his own car, with the inspector now taking a seat beside
him.</p>

<p>"But it's lucky we met you, Hart," said the latter, as the car
drove swiftly on. "This business looks very bad to me, with Mr.
Larose now missing for nearly forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>They reached the gate leading on to Black Gallows and the ex-policeman of Hoxton gave his orders quickly as if he were now
leader of the party.</p>

<p>"We must rush them," he said, "and go straight round to the
far side of the farmhouse. That's the only direction in which
they can break away, for it's quite possible they may have boards
ready to throw across the narrow dykes. So all of us in the cars
will go round to the front, but you"&mdash;he pointed to the
plain-clothes men in the sidecar outfit&mdash;"stop directly you
get near the outbuildings and cut off an escape from that way. I
think there'll be six or seven to account for."</p>

<p>The cars went like the wind, and Naughton Jones' dilapidated-looking Goat, goaded on to fury by the pressure upon its
accelerator, avalanched over the ground for all the world as if
it were upon exhibition before an intending purchaser.</p>

<p>Fortune favored the raiders, for it so happened that Lamb and
the man with the big scar across his forehead were at that very
moment adjusting the carburetter of the Jehu, and with their
heads close together under the bonnet, were roaring up the engine
to get the adjustment correct. So they heard nothing of the rush
of the oncoming cars until they were just upon them, and then,
too astonished to make any attempt at escape, they were pounced
upon by the Downham Market men.</p>

<p>"Handcuff them," roared Jones in a voice of thunder, "that's
Lamb and the other one is at all events consorting with
criminals."</p>

<p>Then with the two manacled at once and with no parley, Jones,
the Inspector and Hart rushed round to the front door. They met
Roy Fensum, coming out with another man close behind him. The two
had evidently been partaking of morning lunch, for the latter was
holding a slice of bread and butter in his hand.</p>

<p>Jones flourished a big revolver. "Hands up!" he shouted, "and
no tricks," and then pointing to Fensum whose face had turned a
ghastly yellow under its tan, he gasped excitedly, "But, who's
that?"</p>

<p>"He's the owner of the farm," replied the Inspector, "Roy
Fensum."</p>

<p>"No, no, he's not," shouted Jones exultingly, "and clap the
darbies on him at once, for he's wanted, at all events, for
breaking his ticket-of-leave." He laughed scornfully. "It's no
good your trying to screw up your face, Joe, for it won't deceive
me." He turned to the Inspector. "He's an old lag, sir, Joseph
Minting Shaver, and in 1919 got fifteen years for burglary when
carrying a revolver, but he was released some six years ago and
has never reported since." He rubbed his hands together
delightedly. "Yes, it was I who traced him to a house in
Shoreditch and put the police on him. Didn't I, Joe?"</p>

<p>The man's face was in a muck sweat, and neither he nor his
companion made any resistance.</p>

<p>"Now where have all you beauties got Lady Ardane and Sir Parry
Bardell tucked away?" asked Jones sternly. He shook his fist in
Fensum's face. "By heaven, if any harm's come to them
you'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But suddenly there came the sound of a swiftly approaching
car, and looking round, they saw one drive up, almost stop, and
then after a very white face had peered out through the window,
turn almost in its own length and start to race off at a great
pace back along the way it had just come.</p>

<p>"After him!" shrieked Naughton Jones. "He's Clive Huntington
and one of the worst of the gang. He's wanted for the murder of
Bernard Daller, the airman."</p>

<p>The plain-clothes men from the Yard jumped into their outfit
and started off in pursuit.</p>

<p>"No chance!" wailed Jones despairingly. "It's going eighty,
and they'll never catch it," and then his eye fell upon a rifle
standing in the porch. He made a snatch for it, and his face
became transfigured. "It's loaded," he gasped. He dropped upon
one knee and his breath came in quick jerks. "I was a crack shot
once."</p>

<p>Then with a supreme effort he calmed himself down. His muscles
became taut, and then unstrained and under perfect control. In
five seconds he was as steady as a rock. He looked down the
sights and smiled a cold grim smile.</p>

<p>An intense moment followed. Then&mdash;bang went the rifle,
bang and bang again. "Got him," he said calmly, "in one of the
back tyres!"</p>

<p>Then a report almost as loud as the rifle reached them, and
the swiftly racing car was seen to describe a dreadful curve. The
wheels of one side rose up and for a few seconds hovered in the
air. Then the car turned completely over and slid its own length
along the ground in a dense cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>The side-car men raced up and were just in time to grab hold
of Clive Huntington, who was climbing, badly shaken but unhurt,
through one of the windows.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones wiped the perspiration from his forehead. "But
I was runner-up for the King's Prize at Bisley once," he remarked
carelessly to the astounded spectators, "and after this, if I
could spare the time, I almost think I would be inclined to
compete again." He nodded. "Yes, when Daller was murdered four
days ago, his murderer was careless and left plenty of
fingerprints behind him, but the authorities did not know whose
they were, until I sent up a print of Huntington's, and then a
warrant was issued for this gentleman at once."</p>

<p>In the meantime Larose and Lady Ardane, with quickly-beating
hearts, had been aware that something very unusual was happening,
but the detective, suspecting a ruse, had not ventured to look
out of the window. Earlier in the morning he had cautiously
lifted the little mirror off the dressing table and had held it
just above the window sill in order to see if anyone were still
on guard outside, and within ten seconds it had been smashed to
atoms and the glass all scattered over the room. That experience
had made him chary of taking further risks, and so they had just
sat waiting patiently through all the roar of the cars that they
had heard.</p>

<p>But when they heard the rifle shots at some distance from
where they were, and the resounding bang of the bursting tyre,
Larose became convinced that they must do something.</p>

<p>"I've got an idea," he said, with the cheerfulness that he had
kept up all along. "We'll hang one of the sheets off your bed out
of the window and they can bang away at that as much as they want
to," and so in a few seconds the sheet had been swung over the
window sill and was flapping as a signal of distress in the
wind.</p>

<p>So almost immediately it came about that Hale, returning with
Clive Huntington handcuffed in the side-car, caught sight of the
sheet and, depositing his prisoner with the Downham Market
officers, instantly rode over to see what it meant.</p>

<p>To his amazement, then, the machine almost ran over a man who
was lying prone in the long grass before the stables. The man had
got a rifle by his side, but he was so cowed by all that he had
seen happening around him, that, although he refused to give any
reason for his being there, he allowed himself to be marched off
a prisoner to the farmhouse. Then Hale returned at once to where
the sheet was hanging out.</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo!" he shouted, "who's up there? Is that you, Mr.
Larose?" and to his unbounded delight Larose put his head out of
the window, and, too overcome to speak, waved his hand. Then the
end of everything came very quickly, and in a few minutes Lady
Ardane and Larose were seated at the table in the farmhouse, and
surrounded by friendly and sympathetic faces, partaking of hot
coffee and bread and butter.</p>

<p>But the food almost choked Lady Ardane. She wanted to be away
by herself and weep oceans and oceans of tears, but she saw that
Larose was suffering, too, and for his sake kept herself under
control. Her mind was bruised and lacerated, and she thought that
surely it would never be at peace again, but her heart was
whispering a great secret to her, and if she wept, she knew it
would not all be for grief.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones was in great form, and time after time
congratulated the Downham Market inspector upon the captures that
had been made. "A small thing, my services," he observed
magnificently, "and all the credit may be yours. My reputation is
well-known and I would wish that no undue stress be laid upon the
information that I was able to give you." He raised his hand
warningly. "But search every nook and cranny of this place and I
shall be very much surprised if you do not obtain most clear and
certain evidence of the illicit-drug traffic that I am positive
has been carried on from here." A thought seemed suddenly to
strike him. "But there is yet one man unaccounted for, and I
would have dearly liked you to have got him." He turned sharply
to Larose. "By-the-bye, have you seen anything of that fellow
Prince? Prince is, of course, only his nickname. They call him
that because of his dandified appearance." He spoke carelessly.
"He is Clive Huntington's brother, Rupert."</p>

<p>Larose looked very astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, lowering his voice and hoping that Lady
Ardane should not hear, "I had a little argument with him
yesterday in one of the sheds of the stable, where the hay loft
is."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones glanced round at the company generally and
smiled a slow, grim smile. "And if I know anything of Mr.
Larose's little talks," he remarked loudly, "I think some of you
had better take a stretcher or in preference a hurdle round to
where the conversation took place."</p>

<p>To spare the feelings of Lady Ardane no one made any comment,
and then, perhaps, the greatest surprise of the morning
occurred.</p>

<p>A limousine and a big police motor van came roaring to a
standstill outside. Senator Harvey and Theodore Rankin sprang
from the limousine, a dozen burly men from the police van, and
then, the party dividing, some spread themselves round the house
and others came rushing up to the front door.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" exclaimed the Downham Market inspector. "It's
Superintendent Roberts, of Norwich, and a posse of his men."</p>

<p>The new-comers crowded into the kitchen, and the amazement
upon the faces of the Senator and Theodore Rankin was laughable
to behold.</p>

<p>With a cry of joy, Helen ran to her step-father, and big tears
welled from the latter's eyes. "So, we're too late," he
exclaimed, "and the caged birds are free." He looked round and
asked quickly, "But where is Sir Parry?"</p>

<p>Larose laid his finger upon his lips and nodded in the
direction of Lady Ardane. "There's a great deal to tell you, sir,
but it can't be told all at once."</p>

<p>"But the gang, Inspector Bain?" exclaimed Superintendent
Roberts, "Have you got them all?"</p>

<p>"Six of them, sir, in the back room," replied the inspector,
looking across at Larose, "and the seventh, I think, is
dead."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones at once stepped forward. "We regret to have
forestalled you, Superintendent Roberts," he said calmly, "but
you are just one hour too late. Inspector Bain, ahem!"&mdash;he
coughed over so slightly&mdash;"acting upon information received,
has rounded up the whole lot,"&mdash;his voice rose in
grandiloquent tones&mdash;"not only the abductors of Lady Ardane
and Sir Parry Bardell, but also, I am nearly certain, the heads
of the Antwerp-Rotterdam illicit drug traffic gang." He frowned.
"Only one thing is as yet achieved. We are not in possession of
the child, and two of the wretches here who have been prevailed
upon to speak, deny all knowledge of his whereabouts. They admit
that he was taken, but aver he was removed from their custody
almost at once, in a manner they have never been able to
understand."</p>

<p>Lady Ardane instantly looked up, smiling through her tears.
With all her gratitude to Naughton Jones, she did not like it
that he had not mentioned Larose. "My child is all right," she
said happily, and glancing round upon everyone. "They only held
him for about ten minutes, and then Mr. Larose rescued him and
placed him in a place of safety where he has been ever since.
Charles has never been a mile away from the Abbey." Her voice
choked a little. "Sir Parry's housekeeper has been looking after
him."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones, although obviously discomfited, received the
blow with great fortitude and good humor. "You young dog!" he
exclaimed, playfully wagging his finger at Larose. "You are
always trying to go one better than me"&mdash;he made a wry
face&mdash;"and with all my experience, you sometimes manage to
succeed."</p>

<p>"But how did you come here, father," asked Lady Ardane. "How
did you know where I had been taken?"</p>

<p>"That matter, my dear, as our good friend, Mr. Jones, would
say, is very simple. A letter addressed to Mr. Larose and marked
very urgent, but which, however, under very dreadful
circumstances, had been delayed, arrived last evening at the
Abbey and"&mdash;he bowed apologetically to the
detective&mdash;"I ventured to open it. It was from Bernard
Daller." He spoke very solemnly. "He has since passed away, but
this letter was written just before his death, and found
afterwards among his effects. Very briefly, he wrote that on the
morrow he was setting out upon a solo flight to South America,
and he had a premonition that he would never return."</p>

<p>The Senator steadied his voice here, and then went on. "He
wrote that, unhappily, about a year ago he had become mixed up
with a criminal gang who were engaged in smuggling forbidden
drugs into this country. In that association he had met Clive
Huntington, and lately it had come to his almost certain
knowledge that Huntington had had something to do with your
disappearance." The Senator had to steady his voice again here.
"So, with the great regard that he had for you, he was writing to
Mr. Larose, informing him where the headquarters of the gang was
situated, believing that here upon Methwold Fens you would be
found." He patted his step-daughter's head affectionately. "You
shall see the letter later on, my dear."</p>

<p>A solemn silence followed, the dreadful tension of which was,
however, almost immediately relieved by a humorous happening,
when Theodore Rankin was seen to advance with outstretched hand
to Naughton Jones.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to meet you, Mr. Jones," he said heartily. "It
is a pleasure that has been long deferred."</p>

<p>But Jones, refusing the proffered hand, regarded him with a
rude stare. "The pleasure, sir, is all yours," he remarked in icy
tones, "for I do not know who you are." He eyed him most
suspiciously. "For one thing, I am of opinion that Rankin does
not happen to be your real name."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied the smiling and in no way abashed
American. "I'm Mark Rattle, of Gunning's Detective Agency, New
York City, and I was specially summoned over by the Senator to
assist in this case. Only he and Sir Parry knew who I was until
Mr. Larose here," he smiled at the detective, "wanted to search
my belongings, and then we had to take her ladyship into our
confidence, because I was in possession of some handcuffs and a
few other things that it would not have been wise to allow
everyone to see."</p>

<p>Jones' face was that of a man prostrated by a most stupendous
surprise.</p>

<p>"Mark Rattle!" he ejaculated hoarsely, "the only man that in
your great country I acknowledge to be my master! Why, of course,
it was your face that I remembered seeing in the newspapers, when
you broke up the Bud Reily gang! You killed Bud yourself by
gunning him from the hip!" He reached out and gripped the
American's hand as if he would never let it go. "My dear sir,
this is one of the proudest moments of my life."</p>

<p>A few minutes later two cars had left Black Gallows and were
making for Carmel Abbey. Lady Ardane, the Senator and Larose were
in the first one, and in the second were Naughton Jones, the
American detective and Jones' two faithful henchmen.</p>

<p>Hardly a word was spoken in the first car during the whole of
the fifty odd mile journey, except when, at Swaffham, Larose
alighted at the Post Office to send off a wire to Sir Arnold
Medway.</p>

<p>Reaching the Abbey, there was a joyful reunion between Lady
Ardane and her son, and then Sir Arnold bent gravely over her
hand and kissed it, without, however, saying a word. Early
afternoon tea was served in the lounge, and Polkinghorne was so
overcome with emotion that he had to retire and was seen no
more.</p>

<p>Then they all went up to their rooms to rest, Larose being now
relegated to one in another wing, and as far away as possible, he
thought, from that of Lady Ardane.</p>

<p>They met again at dinner, an early one, because Sir Arnold was
returning to London that night and taking Larose with him. Lady
Ardane had made no comment when the detective had announced that
he was leaving so soon.</p>

<p>Everyone at the meal was quiet and subdued, but it was carried
through with its usual ceremony, with Polkinghorne, as commanding
and important as ever, and the noiseless, soft-footed footmen and
the pretty waiting maids. Lady Ardane was seated once more at the
head of the table and was again the queenly chatelaine of the
Abbey, a little sad, perhaps, but with a gracious smile for all
her guests.</p>

<p>Many times, with a pang, Larose thought how beautiful she
looked, and many times, too, with a horrible feeling of
trepidation, how he had dared once to kiss her upon the lips. But
she spoke very nicely whenever she addressed him and evidently
intended all there to see that she regarded him as one of the
most honored of her guests.</p>

<p>After dinner, as they were smoking a farewell cigarette in the
lounge, Senator Harvey beckoned Larose into the library, and with
the door closed behind them, shook him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>"We cannot be too grateful to you, my boy," he said, "for,
although Naughton Jones actually brought the rescue party, still
you, by your arriving the previous night, saved my step daughter
from"&mdash;he threw out his hands&mdash;"well, I really don't
know what. She tells me that madman was actually threatening her
just before you came and every moment she was afraid that she was
going to swoon away and be unable to defend herself." He laughed
bitterly. "But just fancy us being so sucked in about Sir Parry!
Why I actually took him into my confidence and told him who
Rattle was so that we could borrow the key of the cloister door
that night and get Rattle into the grounds." He shook his head
angrily. "He was a real devil, that man!" He took a cheque-book
from his pocket and his face broke into an exultant smile. "But
now for something much more pleasant to talk about." He dropped
his voice into a stage-whisper. "I don't mind telling you that
during the last week I've made a pot of money over wheat, and so,
on behalf of Lady Ardane, I am now going to present you with a
substantial cheque."</p>

<p>"Did Lady Ardane suggest it?" asked Larose with a horrible
sinking at his heart.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" came the quick reply. "She has far too much
regard for you to dare mention it." He nodded smilingly. "But you
and I are men of the world and so, what about a couple of
thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>But Larose refused absolutely, and after much argument, and
with great reluctance, the Senator put back the cheque-book into
his pocket.</p>

<p>The parting with Lady Ardane was very brief. "Thank you so
much, Mr. Larose," she said quietly. "You know I can never be
grateful enough." Then with a slightly heightened color, she
whispered quickly, "I shall be writing to you in a day or
two."</p>

<p>During the drive London-wards Larose proceeded to tell Sir
Arnold much more about Sir Parry than he had hitherto told
anyone. "But Lady Ardane must never know," he concluded, "for it
would be a terrible memory to her if she ever learnt
everything."</p>

<p>Sir Arnold smiled. "But if you ask me," he remarked dryly, "I
think there is nothing she does not know, for that Kate Dilling
spent an hour with her this afternoon, and from what the Senator
has just informed me, I think the woman told her everything. For
certain, Mrs. Dilling told her how she had learnt about the
proposed kidnapping from Sir Parry's habit of talking to himself,
and in consequence had sent those two warning letters. Then she
told her of the attempt to poison you with a dessert spoonful of
Barbitone, and how she had substituted bicarbonate of soda
instead. Finally, she said how, night after night, the wretched
man had gone into the Abbey through that cloister door and spied
through the ventilators." He swore softly. "His ending was much
too merciful a one."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then he asked curiously, "But how
did he come to stand before that window and court certain
death?"</p>

<p>"I suggested it," replied Larose. "In fact, I goaded him on to
do it."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" nodded the great surgeon. "The moment I heard about
it, I thought it seemed like your work." He turned and regarded
Larose very solemnly. "If both your positions were equal, young
man, and I were Lady Ardane's father, I would do all in my power
to make you her husband for that." He nodded again. "You probably
saved her honor, my friend."</p>

<p>Just a week later Larose received the promised letter from
Lady Ardane.</p>

<br>

<p>"<i><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Larose</span></i>, he read,</p>

<p class="letter">You can render me yet another
service, if you will. Now, can you get away for a week and
perhaps longer, and meet me the day after to-morrow in Norwich,
at ten minutes to six in the lounge of the Royal Hotel, just as
we met before? If any objection be raised to your coming, please
telephone me directly you get this. I have some influence in the
Home Office, and think that in any case I can arrange for it.</p>

<p class="letter">With my kindest regards to you,</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Helen Ardane</span></p>.

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Don't book a room at the hotel, for you will be staying at the Abbey.</p>

<br>

<p>"Of course I'll go," sighed Larose, "although I'm a fool to do
so." He intoned mockingly. "I publish the banns of marriage
between a policeman&mdash;and Helen Ardane." He sighed again.
"No, not this side of Jordan."</p>

<p>The following evening then, at ten minutes to six, he walked
into the lounge of the Royal Hotel and saw Lady Ardane seated
where she had been seated once before. She rose as he approached
and shook hands with a charming smile. She looked very well and
showed no signs now of the dreadful times she had been
through.</p>

<p>"I'm your hostess to-night," she said as the dinner gong
sounded, "and as it is nearly my birthday and I shall be twenty-eight, we'll have a bottle of champagne as we had before. I've
booked the same table and we shall be able to talk in peace."</p>

<p>Larose felt very mystified. She looked as amused as a child
who had some great surprise in store.</p>

<p>She was very bright and chatty during the meal and told him of
all the little happenings at the Abbey. How Polkinghorne's
kittens were getting on all right, how she had taken young
Hollins permanently into her service, and how the Senator and all
the other visitors had gone away. "So, I am now quite alone with
my aunt," she said, "and the peace and quiet are very
soothing"&mdash;a shadow flitted across her face&mdash;"after all
the adventures we went through."</p>

<p>But she made no mention at all of why she had asked him to
meet her, and so Larose, at length dismissing the whole matter
from his mind, set himself to enjoy her company, and association
with one of the most lovely women, he thought, he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>He never wanted to take his eyes off her, and drank in her
beauty thirstily. The finely-cut aristocratic profile, the most
perfect complexion, the lovely deep blue eyes, the mouth like a
cupid's bow&mdash;he blushed violently here&mdash;and the
crowning glory of her angel-colored hair! She seemed so happy,
too, and as if she had not a single care in all the world.</p>

<p>The coffee upon the table, however, and the waiter moving
away, her whole demeanor altered in the passing of a second, as
his had once done, when, those few short weeks ago, he had
started to question her. But she was not stern and uncompromising
as he had been, on the contrary she had become all at once
nervous, and was now blushing furiously.</p>

<p>Larose saw her embarrassment and tried to help her out. "Well,
now we are alone," he said gently, "in what way can I help
you?"</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment as if to choose her words very
carefully, and then, having apparently recovered from her
nervousness, said quickly, "I have I proposition to put before
you, Mr. Larose, and as we are neither of us children, and unless
I am very mistaken, have both had the matter in our minds for a
little time, we can decide without any delay." She dropped her
business-like tone all at once, and giving him an arch look,
asked smilingly, "You like me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he replied, with his heart beginning to beat
very quickly. "Everybody does."</p>

<p>"You kissed me upon the lips once," she went on musingly.
"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>Larose felt horribly uncomfortable. "But it was a very wrong
thing to do," he said sharply, "and I have regretted it ever
since."</p>

<p>"I haven't," she replied calmly, "for it comforted me quite a
lot at the time, and you might have given me fifty or a hundred
then and I shouldn't have minded." She shuddered. "Oh! I should
have gone mad that dreadful night if you hadn't been there to
protect me." She laughed a little tremulously. "Do you remember
how I sat near you in the darkness, with only a blanket between
us? And then, how I went to sleep leaning up against
you"&mdash;she nodded&mdash;"but I wasn't asleep all the time,
although you may have thought so." She heaved a big sigh, and
regarding him intently, went on very quietly, "So, as you say you
like me, if you were rich as I am and our social lives were just
the same, tell me, do you think you would be asking me to marry
you?"</p>

<p>Her meaning was so unmistakable that Larose felt his knees
knocking together under the table. "A million, times, yes!" he
exclaimed hoarsely. "I wouldn't wait a second!"</p>

<p>She laughed as if it were a good joke. "Then forget you've not
got all the riches in the world and ask me and see what I'll
say." She puckered up her brows prettily. "Didn't Mr. Jones tell
me that you were a very brave man?"</p>

<p>"But I'm a policeman!" gasped Larose.</p>

<p>"And a gentleman," she bowed, "and one to whom any woman might
entrust the keeping of her happiness. You are kind, a man of
honor, and I have a great respect for you." She went on quite
calmly. "Our differing social positions need have no bearing upon
the future of our lives, for, every time, it is the man and the
woman who count and never their possessions or the forbears from
whom they have sprung." She raised one beautiful white hand
before her. "Listen to what I am going to tell you. I have just
found out that I am a very lonely woman and missing quite a lot
of the happiness of life. I am growing old, Mr. Larose. The years
are slipping by me, and soon, very soon, I shall be without many
of the attractions that now are mine. Women of my type lose their
beauty long before they are forty. They grow stout, they become
wrinkled and their skin coarsens. My mother is like that."</p>

<p>"But you will be always beautiful with those eyes of yours,"
protested Larose.</p>

<p>She shook her head and went on. "Well, I have just realised
that I want something that I am sure every woman, in her heart of
hearts, must always want. I want to love as well as be loved, and
I long for those moments that I know most other women have,
before I am too old for anyone to want to give them to me." She
spoke very sadly. "I'll be quite frank with you. I was married
before I was nineteen to a man of fifty-two and I honored and
respected him, and in course of time bore him a child. But I
never wanted him to kiss me, and when he held me in his arms,
although I was always submissive&mdash;I was always cold. I
thought I was a woman who could never give back love in return."
She blushed furiously. "Then when you held me in your arms that
night, and later, when you kissed me, a different world opened
all at once for me, and I began to think that I had all along
been imagining myself to be"&mdash;she bit her lip to repress her
emotion&mdash;"so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And all this time Larose, had been realising with a sickening
feeling at his heart what this confession must be costing
her.</p>

<p>The shame of this so frank appeal to him to take her, and the
dreadful humbling of her pride that she might make a golden
bridge for him to pass over! The disclosing of her secret
thoughts and the lifting of that veil that most women during all
their lives lift never, even for those whom they love most! And
the glorious and sublime courage of it all.</p>

<p>"Then will you marry me, Helen!" he interrupted quickly, and
determined at all costs to spare her any further explanations.
His voice shook in its emotion. "I've loved you, I think, from
the first moment that I saw you."</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes. "Yes, Gilbert," she replied, with a
great shyness now. "I will if you really want me to."</p>

<p>"When?" he asked, and he could not have added another word,
even if his very life had depended upon it.</p>

<p>She flashed him a quick look and then her voice steadied all
at once. "Tomorrow, here in the Cathedral, by special license. I
know the bishop, and he'll marry us." Her bosom was rising and
falling quickly. "I want to get it all settled, before any of my
friends know anything about it, and then"&mdash;a tear trickled
down her check&mdash;"we'll make a little world of happiness, all
of our own." She shook her head. "I'm sick to death of the
hollow, empty life that I see now I have been leading, and if
every social tie is broken, it will be nothing to me." She
averted his eyes. "We'll spend our honeymoon, if you like, at the
Abbey, at my home"&mdash;her eyes were like wet
violets&mdash;"and yours."</p>

<p>Larose felt like a man in a trance, the ecstasy and the
happiness of it all for the moment depriving him of all power of
speech. His head was in a whirl and he gave no thought to
anything except that this peerless woman before him was going to
become his wife.</p>

<p>But Lady Ardane was quite herself again, queenly, stately, and
very practical. "Come, Gilbert," she said, rising from her chair,
"we'll go home now and tell my aunt." She looked supremely happy.
"To-night, you'll be my guest, and to-morrow, my husband," she
made a pretty little grimace&mdash;"and if I know anything about
you, my master, too."</p>

<p>They passed into the lounge, and she then turned and asked.
"Should we stay for a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" replied Larose. "No," he added quickly, and he
smiled to himself, "we'll go off straightaway."</p>

<p>They went round to the garage and were soon seated in her
beautiful limousine, Larose, as a matter of course, taking the
wheel. Then without a word, for their hearts were much too full
for speech, they drove away in silence.</p>

<p>Presently, when they had gone for about two miles and were
well clear of the city, Larose suddenly swerved the car into the
narrow opening of a little unlighted lane.</p>

<p>"But we keep straight on," called out Lady Ardane.</p>

<p>"No, we don't," replied Larose, with a laugh. "For once, my
lady, we're going to take the wrong turning."</p>

<p>He ran the car for only about a hundred yards, and then drove
it on to the side of the road and brought it to a standstill. He
switched off the headlights, leaving only the parking and rear
ones on.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his now trembling companion. "I'm just going
to make your mind quite easy, you pretty creature," he said with
a thrill of delicious expectation in his tones, "that I'm not
marrying a thing of ice," and with one hand he drew her to him,
and with the other he pulled down the blind.</p>

<p>Part of his dream was at all events coming true!</p>

<p><br>
IT was a glorious evening in the days of early June, the
following year, and Larose met his wife, just inside the Abbey
grounds, as he was returning from a walk into the village.</p>

<p>They greeted each other affectionately, and then he said with
a frown, "But ought you to have come so far, sweetheart!
Remember, you are not to over-fatigue yourself."</p>

<p>"But I'm not at all tired," she replied, "and I had to bring
you some news." Her eyes sparkled. "Sir John Tullock has just
rung up to say that you have been made a Justice of the
Peace."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" he laughed, "and I'll be able to let all the
offenders off, or pay their fines for them. Our good friend,
Jones, always says that I'm half a criminal, myself."</p>

<p>She put an arm through his and smiled happily. "You're going
to get on, dear, now," she said, "and one day I'm sure you'll be
Sir Gilbert Larose." She went on, "But come among these trees for
a minute. I want to see if I can revive a memory." Then when
close to the fence and hidden from all sight of the Abbey, she
pointed to a big oak tree with gnarled and far-reaching branches.
"It was here, Gilbert," she said with a pretty blush, "that you
first held me in your arms. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded solemnly, and kissing her tenderly, lifted her
up and looked fondly into her eyes.</p>

<p>"So history repeats itself," she laughed.</p>

<p>"And I hope it will go on doing so," he laughed back, as he
lowered her gently to the ground, "for I want, at least, a boy
and a girl."</p>
