<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Nathaniel Edgar Pontifex, first Baron Marsom, chairman of the famous textile
business known as Woolito, Limited, stood at the head of a long mahogany table
in the magnificent library of his Park Lane mansion and looked swiftly around
the room with quick, birdlike glances, as though to assure himself that
everything was in order. He had purposely outstripped his guests, who were
loitering across the winter garden from the dining room. He wanted just this
one minute to himself.</p>
<p>They were a strange-looking company, these warriors of commerce who were
following him, not one of them bearing in gait or features any suggestion of
gentle birth. There were big men and small men, some dark-haired and some
fair-complexioned, differing in many respects, but every one of them with the
hard mouth and keen eyes of the successful man. That they had met with success
was a proven thing, for each one was a member of the board of the celebrated
Woolito Company. Their cheeks were a trifle flushed with wine. Most of them
were smoking large and very wonderful cigars. They trooped rather noisily into
the room and, as each arrived, he was shown to his seat by a pale-faced,
bespectacled young man in morning clothes, Andrew Crooks, Lord Marsom's private
secretary.</p>
<p>"You will sit here, Sir Sigismund," he indicated, singling out one of the
group, a small, elderly man with a narrow chin and prominent forehead, "at Lord
Marsom's right. And you, Sir Alfred," he added, turning to another of the
little company, a man of heavier build and coarser appearance, "exactly
opposite. There are place cards everywhere, according to his lordship's
directions."</p>
<p>They all sank into high-backed, but well-cushioned chairs, still keeping up
a running fire of conversation, two or three of them leaning forward to hear
the end of a story one of the party had commenced in the winter garden. Lord
Marsom paused for a moment before taking his own seat. He was a bulky,
dark-complexioned man, with huge shoulders; pale&mdash;almost
olive&mdash;cheeks; black hair in abundance; cruel, curving lips which, hard
though they were, still contrived to remain licentious; and deep-set, brilliant
eyes. A thousand years ago he might have played well enough the part of a great
Asiatic merchant at home in his palace. One almost looked for the turban on his
head and the rich magenta robes of the Orient instead of the well-fitting but
unbecoming dress coat and oversized, but priceless, pearls.... Then he leaned
forward to take his place and another likeness presented itself. The
moderation, the gentle dignity of the East had passed away. It was the bird of
prey who smiled down the table, his white fingers, with their glossy nails,
leisurely tapping its polished surface. Civilisation had marched, after all,
with halting footsteps.</p>
<p>"My friends," he began in a throaty, but somehow clear voice, "this is an
informal gathering in order that we may exchange just a word or two together
before the meeting to-morrow week. Some of you, perhaps, have not heard the
latest news. The official receiver has accepted our offer for the purchase of
the Ossulton Company which went into liquidation last month."</p>
<p>There was a low concerted murmur, which seemed to take to itself the sound
of a malevolent chuckle. Lord Marsom moistened his lips.</p>
<p>"The Ossulton Company," he went on, "was the last of the group who ventured
to hold out against us. We have bought them up, as we have bought up all the
others. They went into liquidation because their obstinate directors preferred
that course to being taken over by our larger interests. Events have proved
that they were ill advised."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund Lunt, the small, grey-haired man who sat on the chairman's
right, leaned forward.</p>
<p>"Have the board of the Ossulton Company given any public explanation to
their shareholders as to why they refused our previous offers?" he asked, in a
shrill, parrotlike voice.</p>
<p>"Not yet," Marsom answered. "When they do, we shall be ready for them. With
their passing out of the business, no other licencee of the great Woolito
patent remains. In other words, gentlemen, competition is dead. If you will
continue to give me your attention for a few minutes, I will place some figures
before you which should, I think, help your digestion."</p>
<p>They all leaned forward in their places. There were seven of them and the
expression upon the face of each one was the same. There was the same rapacious
gleam in their eyes, the same satyrlike grin on their lips. They had drifted
into their positions through a common passion&mdash;the hunger and greed for
wealth. They were assisting to-night at a banquet. They were tearing to pieces
a carcass.</p>
<hr>
<p>Upstairs Miss Frances Moore, publicity and social secretary to the great
Woolito Company, who by virtue of her office had a small but seldom-used room
in the mansion of the chairman of the company, dismissed her typist, smoothed
her hair before the glass and prepared to receive her unexpected caller. There
was a knock at the door and one of the many footmen of the establishment made
an announcement.</p>
<p>"The young gentleman to see you, Miss Moore."</p>
<p>The latter looked curiously at her visitor, who was not in the least the
type of person she had expected to see. He was a young man of excellent
features and presence, slim and gracious, with the lines of humour abundantly
displayed at the corners of his eyes and lips. He had the air of one who found
life a great joke, which he was not too eagerly disposed to share with others.
His hair was of a pleasing shade of dark brown, brushed up a little behind the
ears. He was dressed in informal dinner clothes, with small black pearl studs
and a black tie. It occurred to Miss Moore at once that he was not of the type
of guests who frequented number 31a, Park Lane.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Miss Moore," he said, in a pleasant and ingratiating voice,
as soon as the door was closed behind the departing servant.</p>
<p>"You asked to see me?" she enquired a little dubiously. "Surely you are Lord
Sandbrook?"</p>
<p>"Quite true," he admitted. "That is my name."</p>
<p>"You wish to see Lord Marsom, of course," she continued. "I am very sorry,
but he is engaged at a meeting."</p>
<p>"I should like to attend the meeting," the young man confided.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that is quite out of the question," she told him. "Lord Marsom
has been giving a dinner to the directors of the company and he is now engaged
with them, making plans for the meeting next week."</p>
<p>"Miss Moore&mdash;"</p>
<p>She responded to the appeal in his tone.</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook," she rejoined more amiably.</p>
<p>"You look good-natured."</p>
<p>"My friends," she said, with a faint emphasis upon the word, "usually find
me so."</p>
<p>"Well, consider me as a friend," he begged. "Take me down to the
meeting."</p>
<p>"And lose my post and a very comfortable salary?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't risk anything. You're too valuable. If you daren't land me
amongst them unannounced, go down and ask Lord Marsom whether he will receive
me for a few minutes. Say I should like to meet him in company with the
directors."</p>
<p>"But why?" she asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Listen," he explained. "I have been down in the country for several weeks
and, not having a perfect secretary, my letters have got a trifle mixed up.
Looking through them this evening, I found one from Lord Marsom begging me to
call and see him as soon as possible, either here or in the City. Well, here I
am."</p>
<p>"But can't you see," she pointed out, "that you have chosen a most
inconvenient time?"</p>
<p>"I'm not at all sure about that," he protested. "I believe Lord Marsom
wishes me to become a director of the firm. Well, before I decide, I should
like to have a look at the other directors. This would be such a wonderful
opportunity. Please do as I ask."</p>
<p>She considered the matter. There had been rumours of some trouble in
connection with his father's resignation from the board, but she could not
remember that they were of any vital importance. It seemed to her that,
considering Lord Marsom's pressing invitation, he had a certain right to be
received if he insisted.</p>
<p>"The situation is beyond me," she confessed at last. "I will grant the last
part of your request. I will not risk taking you into the meeting, but I will
go down and tell Lord Marsom that you have only just received his letter, that
you are here now and wish for a few words. If he snaps my head off, it will be
your fault!"</p>
<p>He smiled, and, like a great many other people in the world, she felt the
charm of that swift and pleasant lightening of his whole expression.</p>
<p>"You are a dear!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "I will wait patiently
until you come back...."</p>
<p>Miss Moore's mission met with success. In less than ten minutes Lord
Sandbrook was solemnly ushered into the presence of the seven men who, with
their chief, formed the board of the great Woolito Company. They all turned to
look at him as he walked with long, springy footsteps across the palatial
apartment. Marsom, puzzled but determined to take no false step, rose to his
feet and awaited the coming of his visitor with a hard, stereotyped smile of
welcome. The young man, however, vanquished all hostility from the start. He
grasped Marsom's outstretched hand and made a gesture down the table.</p>
<p>"You I have had the pleasure of meeting before, Lord Marsom," he said. "Will
you present me&mdash;<i>en bloc</i> if you will&mdash;to the directors of the
Woolito Company?"</p>
<p>Marsom laid one hand upon the young man's shoulder; with the other he
indicated separately each member of the gathering.</p>
<p>"Sir Sigismund Lunt, Sir Alfred Honeyman, Mr. Archibald Somerville, Mr.
Bomford, Mr. Sidney Littleburn, Mr. Thomas Moody and Mr. Mayden-Harte."</p>
<p>"Delighted to meet you all, gentlemen," Sandbrook responded genially. "I
flatter myself that I never forget a face, so you are now all known to me. I
trust that we may become better acquainted."</p>
<p>There was a little murmur of polite acquiescence. This self-assured young
man, bringing with him the fascinating suggestion of another atmosphere, very
quickly took their fancy.</p>
<p>"I must apologise for my intrusion, Lord Marsom," his visitor continued,
"but I have been absent from London for some weeks and have only just received
your message. I happened to be disengaged so I called round on the chance of
finding you at home."</p>
<p>"Please sit down," Lord Marsom invited, pointing to the chair, which Mr.
Crooks, the secretary, had just wheeled forward.</p>
<p>Sandbrook accepted the invitation. Some part of the geniality of his manner,
however, seemed to have left him. There was a more serious note in his tone as
he turned towards his host.</p>
<p>"I think I ought to warn you, Lord Marsom," he said, "that I have come here
in a terribly inquisitive frame of mind."</p>
<p>Marsom leaned back in his chair. His lips protruded in unpleasant fashion.
The light in the hard, dry eyes underneath his clustering brows was almost
menacing.</p>
<p>"Inquisitive!" he repeated. "Just what do you mean by that? Your father must
have attended at least fifty directors' meetings and never asked a single
question, so far as I can remember."</p>
<p>"My father was what you might call an acquiescent type of man," Sandbrook
agreed cheerfully. "He found pleasant occupation for his spare time with you
and more than ample remuneration for it. The trouble was that towards the end
his conscience began to trouble him."</p>
<p>Conscience! Lord Marsom repeated the word. His tongue seemed to linger over
it. Somerville, a large, florid man at the end of the table, laughed softly to
himself. Sir Sigismund distinctly chuckled. Sir Alfred Honeyman looked puzzled.
A gleam of humour shone behind Mr. Mayden-Harte's thick spectacles.</p>
<p>"It was very likely because he had foolish ideas," the young man continued
apologetically, "but my father certainly died a very unhappy man. He was
flattered at being invited to join your board, but he joined it without the
least inside knowledge of your outlook or the details of the business. It was
only within the last year that he realised a certain&mdash;may I call it, from
his undoubtedly old-fashioned point of view&mdash;ruthlessness with which the
business of the Woolito Company was being carried on. He resigned at once but
he never recovered from the shock."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that your father's health was seriously affected
because he suddenly took a dislike to our way of doing business?" Marsom asked
caustically.</p>
<p>"That is precisely what I am told happened," was the deprecating reply.
"Mind you, I am not associating myself with his point of view, but my father
had very old-fashioned ideas. Towards the end Ellerton, our family lawyer,
assured me that he was ashamed to walk the streets; he was ashamed to look his
friends in the face. Even in the City, you, perhaps, know, Lord Marsom, one
hears that Woolito's methods are not looked upon with great favour."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom smiled.</p>
<p>"The banks approve of us," he declared. "Your father approved of his
dividend cheques."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the poor old gentleman had no idea how the money was being
earned."</p>
<p>"Rubbish!" Marsom scoffed. "You have a lot to learn yourself, young
gentleman, I can see that. The first duty of a firm engaged in a business like
ours is to rid itself of competition. We were being undersold by half-a-dozen
small concerns who were working on unexpired licences of the Woolito patent
which we had acquired. They had to sell quickly or come to grief, so they sold
at too small a profit. They were doing nobody any good and they were hurting
us."</p>
<p>"So you broke them."</p>
<p>"Exactly. We broke them to prevent their breaking us."</p>
<p>"That sounds reasonable enough. There was a strike at Colwell&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Marsom interrupted. "I daresay you know the truth and if you
don't, you can hear it. We not only engineered it but we financed the strikers.
A great many of them are in our employ at the present moment and the mills are
ours."</p>
<p>"The Croylton mills, which were burnt down?"</p>
<p>"You are venturing upon dangerous ground," Marsom murmured, leaning back in
his chair. "A great misfortune, the burning of the Croylton mills. Fortunately,
we were on the spot to take over their contracts and employ as many of their
staff as were worth employing."</p>
<p>"Then there came what my father seems to have thought was the greatest
tragedy of all," Sandbrook went on. "A group of mills near
Nottingham&mdash;what did they call themselves?&mdash;found somehow or other
that the whole of their yarns were infected and their pits poisoned. They lost
several hundred thousand pounds' worth of goods and most of their trade."</p>
<p>"Sheer carelessness on the part of the overseers," the chairman declared.
"We have inspectors watching the process of our manufacture at every stage, and
no raw material comes into one of our mills without passing the most rigorous
examination. Have I satisfied your curiosity by this time, my young
friend?"</p>
<p>"I'm ashamed to have taken up so much of your time," Sandbrook apologised
genially; "but, after all, I did want to hear you deny that these various
disasters which happened to your competitors were in any way abetted by you. My
father was led to believe that they were. It was for that reason he resigned
his directorship, the directorship that you have been kind enough to suggest
that I might take over. He died a very unhappy man, you know, Lord Marsom. He
was of far too sensitive a nature for the ups and downs of commercial
life."</p>
<p>The chairman of Woolito, Limited, leaned even farther back in his seat. He
had the air of one endeavouring to assume a purely judicial attitude.</p>
<p>"Young man," he said, "your father was elected a director of this board to
give us the use of his name, to help us in our publicity campaign and mind his
own business. For a time he was a great success and I imagine the cheques he
drew were more than an adequate return for his services. Then one day he became
afflicted with that disease&mdash;what did you call it?&mdash;conscience. He
visited our offices one morning, when most of the responsible directors were
away; he asked certain questions of the managers and obtained possession of
certain papers which were outside the sphere of his legitimate activities. Do
you understand me?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"As soon as he broached the matter to us," Marsom continued, "we offered
your father perfectly reasonable explanations; but we told him frankly, at the
same time, that we should continue to do business in our own way, and that, if
he had any qualms about our conduct of it, he had better resign his
directorship&mdash;which he did. And that's that. We've been glad to see you
here to-night, Lord Sandbrook, and we trust that you belong to a more
enlightened school than your father."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of assent from down the table. They were all very much
inclined to like this young man who was looking a little perplexed, but whose
expression was still one of urbane good nature.</p>
<p>"Modern business methods," Lord Marsom went on, "demand forcible measures.
If you attend the meeting next week&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I can't attend it," Sandbrook interrupted. "I am not qualified."</p>
<p>"What do you mean&mdash;you are not qualified?" Marsom asked. "Your father
and mother between them held at least eight thousand shares."</p>
<p>"Yes, but no one knows yet to whom they belong," the young man confided.
"The estate has not been apportioned and the will was executed so that there
need be no forced selling of shares."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, that's too bad," he remarked. "Still, I think if we all club
together, gentlemen, there might be enough shares found in our reserve box to
entitle Lord Sandbrook to a place with us next Wednesday."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of assent, but Sandbrook shook his head.</p>
<p>"I shall get my own shares all right, some day," he declared. "As for coming
to the meeting next week, why, you've told me to-night pretty well all I wanted
to know. Very good of you to have received me like this, Lord Marsom," he
added, rising to his feet and holding out his hand. "I'll wish you good night
now, if I may, and good night, gentlemen. I shall look forward to meeting you
all again and to our future association, if it can be arranged."</p>
<p>They were all very cordial, they all considered him a most charming young
man.</p>
<p>"Smart young fellow, that," Lord Marsom pronounced. "An aristocrat, right
enough, but with the making of a first-class business man in him."</p>
<p>"Likely to be a very useful member of our board, I should imagine," Sir
Alfred Honeyman acquiesced.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Servants were waiting in the hall, the number and livery of whom seemed
somehow reminiscent of musical comedy. One, with perfect gravity, handed the
departing visitor his overcoat, another his hat, a third his stick and
gloves.</p>
<p>"Taxicab or car, sir?" a superior person in plain evening clothes enquired
from the background.</p>
<p>Sandbrook shook his head.</p>
<p>"I think I'll walk, thanks," he decided.</p>
<p>The door was closed behind him. He lingered upon the pavement for a few
moments, deliberating. Before he had made up his mind upon the vital subject of
his destination, the door reopened and Miss Frances Moore came out. She, too,
hesitated. He raised his hat and approached her.</p>
<p>"You appear to be like myself&mdash;in a state of indecision," he remarked.
"Can I help you make up your mind?"</p>
<p>"My dilemma is too simple a one," she laughed. "I am going home to my rooms
and I was wondering whether I ought not to walk a short distance before taking
a taxi."</p>
<p>"I can help you," he declared. "A little exercise at this time of the
evening is the best thing in the world. You will permit me to accompany you
part of the way?"</p>
<p>"How do you know that I haven't someone waiting for me?" she asked, as they
fell into step.</p>
<p>"It is a disconcerting suggestion," he sighed. "At the same time, I don't
believe in it."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because I imagine you to be a young lady of precise habits. You could not
have told beforehand at what hour you would be able to leave that mausoleum of
luxury, and I'm quite sure that you would never keep anyone waiting."</p>
<p>"People have been content to wait for me before now," she murmured.</p>
<p>"At the slightest sign of an intervener of whose appearance I approve," he
promised, "I will fade into a taxicab. Before that time comes, however, let me
thank you for getting me that interview."</p>
<p>"Did you do what you wanted to?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I saw what manner of men they were," he replied, "and I confirmed certain
impressions I had about them. I wish I needed a publicity secretary, Miss
Moore! I should love to offer you the post."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you have created a halo of romance in an impossible place. After
reading some of your articles and interviews, I looked upon the directors of
Woolito, Limited, as gods upon the earth."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry if you're disappointed. Anyhow, I'm not thinking of making a
change. I'm perfectly contented where I am."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it. I have nothing against them personally, but I cannot
imagine you as being content to work for such a gang of money-grabbers."</p>
<p>"If a business man to-day is not a money-grabber," she replied, "he'd better
get out of business&mdash;sit in the back yard and write poetry or something of
that sort. The directors of the Woolito Company are very shrewd business men.
Everyone says that it is going to be one of the richest companies in the world.
There is not a single competitor who will be able to stand up against
them."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose they are shrewd," he admitted. "It is a kindly adjective to
apply to them, though. Tell me again the name of the man on Lord Marsom's
right&mdash;the little, wizened-up fellow with grey hair, puckered face and
eyes like a cat."</p>
<p>"You are not in a flattering mood this evening," she laughed. "That is Sir
Sigismund Lunt, the great engineer. He has just invented the most wonderful
textile machine in the world."</p>
<p>"Surely I have read about it in the papers somewhere lately," he
reflected.</p>
<p>"I should think it more than likely," she observed drily. "A model of the
machine itself is on exhibition every day to privileged visitors up at
Tottenham, together with the most interesting model of the new factory
Woolito's are building."</p>
<p>"I must run up and see it," Sandbrook decided. "However wonderful I may find
it, though, I sha'n't change my idea about its inventor. A most unpleasant old
gentleman: chuckled at my poor old dad's old-fashioned ideas. Then there was
another bilious-looking knight who sat on Lord Marsom's left&mdash;a man with
yellow teeth and a cadaverous expression."</p>
<p>"That was Sir Alfred Honeyman. He is supposed to be one of the cleverest
financiers in the City."</p>
<p>"He may be," Sandbrook agreed, "but someone ought to give him the address of
a decent shirt-maker. I could see his undervest every time he leaned forward.
Most upsetting for his neighbour at a dinner table, I should think."</p>
<p>"Please talk sensibly," she begged. "What did you want to see them all for
this evening, and are you really going to take your father's place on the
board?"</p>
<p>"Something has been said about it. That's why I was so keen to see them all
together and ask a few questions. My father resigned from the board, you know,
just before he died."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid he was not exactly what you would call a business man, was he?"
she ventured.</p>
<p>"Finicky," Sandbrook acknowledged. "Straight-laced, beyond a doubt. I don't
suppose there was ever anything seriously wrong in the matters he took
exception to but I felt that I ought to satisfy myself."</p>
<p>"If you belong to the same school of thought as your father, you should keep
away from the City altogether," she advised him.</p>
<p>"I don't," he assured her. "All the same, I didn't want to get mixed up with
a pack of brigands."</p>
<p>She frowned at him severely. They were passing an electric standard and,
glancing towards her, Sandbrook was more than ever aware that she was a very
attractive person. She walked, too, with a delightfully easy movement&mdash;a
free swing from the hips which suggested the gymnasium.</p>
<p>"Englishmen of your position in life," she said, "know nothing whatever
about business or business methods. It is very wrong of you to criticise."</p>
<p>"I am properly snubbed. But tell me&mdash;how much do you know of the inner
working of Woolito, Limited?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all. Don't you understand, I am publicity secretary? I see that
Woolito is talked about in all the newspapers, and where I give advertisements,
I expect mention of it in the social gossip and that sort of thing. That's what
I have to look after."</p>
<p>"Do you wear any of the stuff yourself?"</p>
<p>"That has nothing to do with it," she told him. "We all made fun of
artificial silk when it came out, but it's holding its own, all right. No one
believed even then that there could be a substitute for wool, but you see there
is."</p>
<p>"All the same, I wish you didn't work for them," he said doggedly.</p>
<p>"What difference does it make to you where I work?"</p>
<p>He hesitated and glanced towards her. For some reason or other, her attitude
seemed to him to have become faintly belligerent.</p>
<p>"Have you any great friends on the board?"</p>
<p>"None at all. My father knew Lord Marsom when he was in New York."</p>
<p>"You are American, then?"</p>
<p>"How clever of you! Have I lost as much of my accent as all that?"</p>
<p>"There was something, of course," he admitted, "but it might have been
Canadian. I am glad you're American. You like people to be plain-spoken, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"Up to a certain point."</p>
<p>He slackened his pace. They were outside his club in Piccadilly.</p>
<p>"I never saw one of them before," he confided, leaning towards her, "but
every one of those seven men to whom Lord Marsom introduced me to-night is a
wrong 'un. Some day they will be found out. You will have all you can do as
publicity secretary to defend them one by one. Woolito may be all right. The
men who are making it aren't up to much. However, as you have pointed out, it
doesn't matter, if the money rolls in. Good-bye; I'm going in here."</p>
<p>"You are," she declared, with an angry little flash in her eyes, "one of the
most prejudiced Englishmen I ever knew. You are exactly what I was told. You
are all alike."</p>
<p>He lingered with his hat in his hand.</p>
<p>"What night will you dine with me to discover how shockingly you are
mistaken?" he invited.</p>
<p>"I do not dine out," she replied coldly.</p>
<p>"It seems to me," he complained, "that your manner lacks cordiality. You are
in a strange country and I am trying to justify our reputation for
hospitality."</p>
<p>"It is not a strange country. I have been here for four years."</p>
<p>"And you have not found out these Woolito people yet?"</p>
<p>"I have only been with them for two years and there is nothing about them to
find out&mdash;nothing bad, that is to say. They are shrewd, that's all. You
have to fight the other man in business, or else go under yourself. Americans
have always recognised the fact and that's why they are better business people
than you English."</p>
<p>"Now I know," he murmured ruefully.</p>
<p>"Now you know," she assented. "Good night."</p>
<hr>
<p>The old man in the front room of a house on the far outskirts of Finsbury
seemed absolutely unconscious that the door had been opened, that anyone else
was in the room. He was seated before a complicated piece of wooden machinery,
the large wheel of which he worked with his feet, and by his side was a basket
filled with wool, one end of which was attached to the wheel. At intervals of a
few yards were several exactly similar looms and their respective stools. Two
things impressed themselves upon the visitor who had just entered the room. The
first was that, for all its seeming complexity, the machine did nothing but
wind up the wool, the second that the wool was of brilliant scarlet colour.</p>
<p>"Good evening," the caller said.</p>
<p>"Whoever you are, you must wait," the man on the stool snapped. "Can't you
see&mdash;this is the most critical point of the whole thing? Stand back out of
the light and be quiet."</p>
<p>The speaker had not once turned his head. He was untidily dressed, without
coat or waistcoat, and the whole of the energy of his brain and shrivelled
muscles seemed to be devoted to pedalling his machine and keeping the wool upon
the huge reel. In course of time, the whole of it was through. The basket was
empty. He leaned back in his chair with a sigh of relief and, taking up a hand
bell by his side, rang it. The woman who had admitted the caller answered the
summons.</p>
<p>"Take off the reel, James," the old man directed. "Bring another basketful
of yarn."</p>
<p>The woman unfastened the reel with practised fingers, took up the basket and
departed. She accepted the whole thing as a matter of course. The man turned
upon his stool towards the waiting figure.</p>
<p>"I am very busy," he said peevishly. "Couldn't they attend to you in the
office?"</p>
<p>"I only deal with principals," was the important reply. "They tell me that
you are the only one who really understands the great Woolito process. I wanted
to see it."</p>
<p>The old man appeared pleased.</p>
<p>"Well, well," he approved, "that's right, lad. If you are a buyer, though,
you will be disappointed. I can't supply you. I have orders for ten years
ahead."</p>
<p>"That's too bad," the visitor regretted. "I've come quite a long way to have
a chat with you."</p>
<p>"No good, my friend. No new customers for us. We have two thousand looms
running and eighteen thousand men at work. I could send my manager to the
telephone there and book orders for twenty years. All my clever lad, too!"</p>
<p>"I should like to hear about him."</p>
<p>"He doesn't often come to the mills," the old man explained. "He's a member
of parliament! He goes about here and there&mdash;hobnobs with all the great
people. Why not? His brain did it."</p>
<p>"What's his name?" the shadowy person in the background asked.</p>
<p>"That's a foolish question," was the irritable response. "Everyone in
England knows his name. Everyone knows Leonard Blunt. Did you see those hampers
of wool that just went out?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you notice the colour of it?"</p>
<p>"I did, indeed. The most brilliant scarlet I ever saw in my life."</p>
<p>The old man grinned. His sunken eyes flashed with triumph.</p>
<p>"That's my Len," he declared. "That's him. I never held with schooling, but
it was his chemistry that taught him that. There were other folks that thought
they could make wool from imitation yarn&mdash;let 'em try. Grey and greasy
when they've done with it. Look at ours&mdash;scarlet, blue, any colour you
like in the world. That's my Len. That's why we employ eighteen thousand hands.
That's why the roar of our machinery shakes the countryside day and night. I
will tell you something, Mister. I'll tell you something quaint."</p>
<p>"I'm listening."</p>
<p>"There was another firm thought it could make artificial wool," the old man
chuckled. "They started like we are now. They went on, and big people they
became, and what are they now? I'll tell you, Mister. I can't do business with
you. You've got a decent sort of face, but no new customers for us&mdash;not
for many a year. But I'll tell you something. Not far from here there's an old
man sitting in a single room, working an old hand machine, gone crazy because
my Len found out the secret and he didn't; and he works all day and he thinks
he is turning out Woolito! He fills his basket with nasty, dirty grey stuff and
day by day and week by week it comes out always the same colour and they throw
it on the ash heap. What do you think of that, Mister?"</p>
<p>The old man rocked with laughter so that he nearly fell from his seat. The
door was opened and the woman re&euml;ntered. She laid another basket of wool,
this time a bright green, upon the floor. She fastened the end of it to the
reel. The tenant of the room drew a long breath.</p>
<p>"You'll excuse me now, sir," he begged. "I have a hundred looms in this
place to look after and the bell's gone. We're off."</p>
<p>He bent over his task. Again his feet were on the treadles&mdash;again his
fingers were guiding the wool. The woman led the visitor away.</p>
<p>"You can't do any more good," she said. "That's him day by day. He thinks
he's working in the greatest factory of the world and you can't get it out of
his head, but he don't do nobody any harm and he's got enough to live on, and
there you are."</p>
<p>The intruder slipped a pound note into her hand and stepped out into the
dirty obscure side street. Inside the room which he had left, the old man, his
lips parted with eagerness, the lines of his worn flinty face deepened with
earnestness, moved his feet upon the treadles and guided the wool with bony,
shaking fingers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Andrew Crooks stepped out of Sandbrook's sporting Rolls-Royce with a sigh of
relief. He removed his hat, straightened his hair and paused for a moment to
regain his breath. He was a young man of sedate habits and he was not used to
being whirled through the North London traffic at anything from thirty to fifty
miles an hour.</p>
<p>"I am very much obliged for the lift, your lordship," he said. "If you will
step this way with me, I will have your ticket stamped."</p>
<p>"Very nice of Lord Marsom to send you up with me," Sandbrook replied,
following his guide towards the turnstile. "I only sent round for a ticket to
see this marvellous machine. I didn't expect to be personally conducted. Looks
like the entrance to Lords'!"</p>
<p>They crossed the jealously guarded portals and Sandbrook glanced around him
curiously.</p>
<p>"I apologise to Lords'," he observed. "Looks more like a filthy dust heap
than anything."</p>
<p>"That is only temporary," Andrew Crooks explained. "Over four hundred houses
have been demolished to clear this space. It is the site of what may be the
largest factory in the world. As you see," he pointed out, "it contains at the
present moment only three insignificant buildings. The one opposite is an
old-fashioned house which was left when the rest of the property was razed to
the ground and is now occupied by various employees of the firm and a staff of
draughtsmen from the architects'. The large shed over there contains what you
have come to see&mdash;the wonderful model of the factory of which everyone is
talking. The third building, with the corrugated iron roof which looks like a
hangar and which is guarded by policemen, contains the most marvellous machine
in the world.... If your lordship will excuse me now, I must go and look after
the two visitors I was to meet here. I see them waiting for me in the
corner."</p>
<p>Sandbrook glanced across in the direction which his companion had
indicated.</p>
<p>"So those are your distinguished visitors," he observed quietly.</p>
<p>"The taller one," Andrew Crooks confided, "is Van Stretton, the great Dutch
scientist. The other is an American&mdash;a manufacturer from
Philadelphia."</p>
<p>"I won't detain you," Sandbrook exclaimed, with a sudden change in his
manner. "Many thanks, once more, for showing me the way up."</p>
<p>He moved back towards the turnstiles in time to welcome Miss Frances Moore,
who had just arrived. She was wearing a long coat trimmed with fur and a turban
hat. Her cheeks were becomingly flushed after the ride in an open car. She
looked up at him in surprise.</p>
<p>"Now, whatever are you doing up here, Lord Sandbrook?" she asked.</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Moore," he replied, "you know my interest in Woolito. I have
come to see the marvellous model. Everyone in town is talking about it. I
presume you have brought Mr. Chalmers on the same errand?"</p>
<p>He shook hands with Miss Moore's companion, the editor of one of the London
dailies.</p>
<p>"Quite right," the latter assented. "The idea seems to me so ingenious. I
have heard of it in building a theatre&mdash;never come across any other
application of it."</p>
<p>"It appeals to me immensely," Sandbrook confessed. "A man who's having a
house built, for instance. He can have his model made and he and the architect
can spend many evenings brooding over it and planning improvements."</p>
<p>"Have you seen Sir Sigismund?" Miss Moore intervened.</p>
<p>"Only once in my life," Sandbrook replied. "At that directors' meeting. A
weasel-faced little man with shifty eyes and a mean mouth. I'm thankful to say
I've been spared any further vision of him."</p>
<p>"Sir Sigismund Lunt is a remarkably clever man," the young lady said
severely. "He is a brilliant chemist as well as being a famous engineer. Anyone
might be proud of his accomplishments. What I wanted to know, though, was
whether you had seen him this morning?"</p>
<p>"Heaven has spared me that affliction," was the fervent reply. "I am on my
way to see the model. May I join up with you?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chalmers," Miss Moore explained, "is very anxious to meet Sir Sigismund
first. We shall probably come across you later."</p>
<p>"I must find my own way about, then," Sandbrook regretted, with a nod to
Chalmers and a farewell salute, half pleasant, half ironical, to his companion.
"If in your capacity as publicity agent, Miss Moore, you desire to interview me
afterwards and ascertain my impressions, I shall be at your disposal!"</p>
<p>The publicity agent shook her head.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe," she told him, with a demure smile, "that a single person
in the world would be interested in them."</p>
<hr>
<p>Sir Sigismund Lunt, some quarter of an hour later, leaned back in the easy
chair of his improvised office.</p>
<p>"That's all for this morning, Harris," he announced. "Many people in to see
our little show yesterday?"</p>
<p>"A thousand and seventy-one, sir," his secretary replied. "Also one or two
with special passes who were allowed to see the machine."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund smiled approvingly.</p>
<p>"All advertisement," he chuckled. "That gentleman who was here with Miss
Moore is the editor of the <i>Sun</i>."</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir ... I saw Lord Sandbrook pass down a short time ago."</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook!" Sir Sigismund repeated, vastly interested. "What&mdash;the
young gentleman&mdash;the son of the Earl of Sandbrook who was on our
board?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir Sigismund. He was captain of Eton and played for The Gentlemen.
Lately he's been travelling a good deal. Very fine big-game shot, sir."</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to hear this," Sir Sigismund declared. "Shows he's taking an
interest in us. We want Lord Sandbrook to take his father's place, you know,
Harris. I shall go down and speak to him. Give me my hat and stick, Harris. I
shall certainly go down and speak to his lordship."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund hobbled down to the shed under which the model of the
forthcoming factory was daily displayed to visitors. He paused to accept the
farewell greetings of Mr. Chalmers, who was just leaving with Frances Moore,
and listened to the former's few words of enthusiastic appreciation. A moment
later he came face to face with Sandbrook, who had paused to light a cigarette.
For Sir Sigismund, who eschewed the graces and courtesies of life, his greeting
was remarkably affable.</p>
<p>"This is a great pleasure, Lord Sandbrook," he declared, holding out his
hand with its clawlike fingers. "A great compliment, I call it. I am glad to
see your interest in us. I trust that it bodes well for the future."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Sandbrook replied, "I think this is the most amazing model I
have ever seen in my life."</p>
<p>Andrew Crooks, with his two companions, who had just issued from the shed,
made modest intervention.</p>
<p>"Sir Sigismund," he said, "we were on our way up to your office. May I
present two gentlemen who have introductions to us and whom I brought down at
Lord Marsom's suggestion? Mr. Van Stretton of Amsterdam and Mr. Solomon Hertz
of Philadelphia."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund displayed a moderate amount of graciousness; he was more
interested in his other visitor than in these newcomers.</p>
<p>"We were on our way up to see you, Sir Sigismund," Andrew Crooks continued,
"to know if you would countersign these two gentlemen's passes and permit them
to see the machine."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund stroked his chin and looked keenly at the two strangers.</p>
<p>"Interested in the textile business?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"Why, no, sir," the American answered. "I am a large manufacturer of
chrome-glazed kids in Philadelphia. It is the amazing arrangement of your
factory as shown in the model here which has kept me hanging around. We've
nothing finer than that in the States."</p>
<p>"Glad to hear you say so," Sir Sigismund acknowledged.</p>
<p>"The idea of the model seems to me to be so original," Van Stretton
observed. "So much more practical than a set of drawings."</p>
<p>"You are quite right, sir," Sir Sigismund approved. "Our architect, by
studying it carefully, has already planned several innovations. But," he went
on, turning towards the farther and larger building, "if I were a boastful man,
if I were one who loved to dwell upon my own achievements, there," he cried,
his voice squeaky with excitement, his outstretched finger trembling as he
pointed towards the shed which they were approaching, "is the triumph of my
life! One of the finest achievements, although I dare to say it, of the
century. The monster in there took three years to build. It is the most
wonderful machine of its sort in the world. It was scarcely worth the trouble
of patenting, although it is patented, because no one else could have designed
or made it. That machine, gentlemen, stands as the foundation of the fortunes
of Woolito, Limited, and though I do not wish to boast&mdash;I am not a man of
vainglorious turn of mind&mdash;I alone designed it. I alone watched it creep
into shape. Other men have wives&mdash;there is mine."</p>
<p>It was one of Sir Sigismund's moments. One forgot that he had a face like a
ferret and that all the meanness of the world lurked in the secret places of
his features. His earnestness for the moment triumphed. The light of the
prophet radiated from his insignificant countenance.</p>
<p>"Are we going to be allowed to see this prodigy, Sir Sigismund?" the
Dutchman asked eagerly.</p>
<p>The great little man produced his fountain pen. Andrew Crooks passed him the
cards of admission, one by one. He scrawled his name across the back of
each.</p>
<p>"You will come too, Lord Sandbrook?" he almost pleaded.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't miss it for anything in the world," was the cheerful reply.</p>
<p>They all followed Sir Sigismund up the steps to the shed. The policeman
stood on one side at his approach. They heard his orders given in his shrill
treble voice to the two brawny commissioners. They followed him into the huge
room. The door was closed behind them. They were admitted into the sacred
presence....</p>
<p>From behind a highly polished brass bar the four men, like pigmies, looked
upwards to what seemed to be a chaos of furious energy, a gigantic medley of
harnessed force, stretching farther away than the dazed and weary eyes could
follow. Wheels of every size were flashing and piston rods turning in some
vague communion with one another. Even a mechanic might well have been
bewildered by the amazing power and intricacies of the whirling mass. The
inventor, dwarfed into the similitude of some two-legged insect, walked a
little in advance of his companions, and every now and then he squeaked out
some word of explanation. Hertz came last, his spectacles removed, the man now
intensely alive, his eyes everywhere, his hand continually clutching the brass
protecting rail. When they stepped out into the daylight, reeling for a moment
upon the steps, dazed by the comparative silence and blinded by a sudden flood
of sunshine, Sir Sigismund challenged their laudation with an almost childish
smile.</p>
<p>"I have no breath for speech," Van Stretton declared. "For the rest of my
days machinery is a live and passionate thing."</p>
<p>"I don't know whether I am on my head or my heels," Sandbrook confessed.
"All I could see was what appeared to be a stream of grey rubbish go in one end
and beautiful baskets full of coloured wool flow out the other."</p>
<p>"I've seen some of our power stations," Solomon Hertz muttered. "I've seen
electricity made and water transported five hundred miles&mdash;I've never seen
anything like that."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund chuckled and waved them to the gate.</p>
<p>"You are very fortunate men," he told them. "There are not fifty others in
the world who have seen my baby at play...."</p>
<p>Outside, Chalmers was talking to the architect, whom he had met in the model
shed. Sandbrook, swift to seize his opportunity, drew Miss Frances Moore a
little on one side.</p>
<p>"You would doubtless like to know my impressions of that amazing monster,"
he observed.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"No one would be interested in them," she assured him. "If you were an
engineer, it would be different. I cannot think what made Sir Sigismund take
you into the Holy of Holies."</p>
<p>"I am inclined to wonder," he complained, "whether you have not too low an
idea of my mentality."</p>
<p>She laughed softly.</p>
<p>"On the contrary," she confided, "I think you are a very intelligent young
man. You are so intelligent that there are times when I must confess that I do
not quite understand you."</p>
<p>"Capital," he exclaimed. "Look upon me in the light of a conundrum. Devote
your time during the next few weeks to solving me. I will be like the
illustrated papers&mdash;I will offer a prize&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she reflected, "you would not care much about being solved."</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I have no dark secrets," he assured her; "if that is what you mean. There
is one forming in my brain but I have not the courage to share it with you just
yet."</p>
<p>She abandoned her attempt at gravity and laughed in his face.</p>
<p>"You are too ridiculous," she protested. "I must leave now. Mr. Chalmers is
ready. Tell me seriously&mdash;if you can be serious for a moment&mdash;what
did you think of that machine?"</p>
<p>"I think that it is the missing wonder of the world," he acknowledged.</p>
<p>She moved her head towards the disappearing figure of Sir Sigismund.</p>
<p>"And its inventor?"</p>
<p>"He must have a gigantic brain," Sandbrook confessed. "Small men with large
heads often have. All the same, I don't like him any better than I did."</p>
<p>"You must admire him," she persisted.</p>
<p>"Why should I?" Sandbrook objected. "I don't think that he has a nice
nature. I will lend you a handbook on physiognomy if you will promise me to
study his features one by one."</p>
<p>"You really are too absurd!" she declared.</p>
<p>"Let's talk like human beings," he proposed suddenly. "You have, I fear, a
very low opinion of me, Miss Frances Moore, but I like you. When will you dine
with me?"</p>
<p>"You are certainly very British," she smiled. "Do you ask every young woman
you admire to take a meal at your expense?"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't ruin me if I did," he replied. "There are not many. Where does
one reach you on the telephone?"</p>
<p>"One doesn't&mdash;in business hours," she answered.</p>
<p>"In your hours of leisure, then?"</p>
<p>"You will find me in the telephone book," she told him. "But listen, Lord
Sandbrook. You have a very glib tongue but I really have something against you.
I do not think your attitude is entirely friendly towards Woolito."</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Moore," he protested. "I have never seen the stuff."</p>
<p>"Frivolous again," she exclaimed. "You know what I mean. The interests of
the Woolito Company are my interests in life. Do you understand that?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly well," he answered.</p>
<p>"An enemy of Woolito, Limited, is my enemy. Is that clear?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"Very well then. I will dine with you one night after next week. You can
ring me up. I see that Mr. Chalmers is ready."</p>
<p>She left him with a little nod of farewell and Sandbrook, having offered a
lift to Andrew Crooks and his friends, which was hastily declined by the
former, made his way back to his car.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>At about ten minutes to six that evening a comfortable private car of the
ordinary limousine type was brought to a standstill before a small garage in
the neighbourhood of Tottenham. A tall, heavily built man, so closely muffled
up that he would have been unrecognisable even to his friends and wearing thick
motoring glasses, descended and, after a word or two with the chauffeur, who
pointed to a car of somewhat similar appearance which was apparently being
prepared for use, entered the place. An employee of the garage, who had been in
the act of drawing on a heavy driving coat, came down some steps from the
office to meet him.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Bostock?" the visitor enquired.</p>
<p>"That's my name, sir," was the civil reply. "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"Let me be sure that there is no mistake," the other continued. "You are the
Mr. Bostock who takes Sir Sigismund Lunt either to the offices in Basinghall
Street or out to Tottenham and fetches him back every day except Sunday?"</p>
<p>"That's right, sir," the man agreed, with a curious lack of enthusiasm. "And
not much of a job, I can tell you. If ever there was a gent who knew how to
take care of his bobs and half-crowns, it's that little blighter. Meaning no
disrespect, sir," he added hastily, "if you happen to be a friend."</p>
<p>"I am only an acquaintance of Sir Sigismund's," the other explained. "The
remainder of our business need not take a minute. You are now on the point of
starting to pick him up at his temporary office and take him home?"</p>
<p>"Dead right, sir, and I ain't looking forward to it. In ten minutes' time I
must be off."</p>
<p>"In ten minutes' time, if you're a sensible man, you will be seated inside
the bar parlour of the 'Pig and Whistle' opposite, drinking a hot whisky and
with a crisp ten-pound note in your pocket."</p>
<p>"What's the game?" was the suspicious query.</p>
<p>"There's no game," the other declared. "It's a very simple matter of
business. You can earn that ten-pound note in this way. Go to your telephone
and ring up Tottenham to say that you've had a mishap to your car and that a
friend is bringing another one and will be up there for Sir Sigismund at the
usual time. That's all you have to do. I shall take the job on and Sir
Sigismund will be delivered at his house just as though you were taking him
there yourself."</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>"I don't care about a deal I don't understand," he confided, "and I don't
understand this one."</p>
<p>"It is really very simple," his client assured him. "Sir Sigismund is a
difficult man to get hold of and I want a few words with him to-night. The
drive home will give me the opportunity I desire."</p>
<p>"Bit of highway robbery, eh?"</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool. Do I look like a thief? I give you my word of honour that
Sir Sigismund shall be delivered at his house only a trifle later than the
usual hour and in his usual state of health. All that I want with him is a
conversation and a chance to show him something. I'll buy your job from you for
the evening, Bostock, for ten pounds, and I guarantee that no harm shall come
to Sir Sigismund and that so far as his personal effects are concerned, he
shall not be a penny the poorer."</p>
<p>Mr. Bostock glanced across the street to the brightly lit bar parlour of the
"Pig and Whistle." He looked down at the ten-pound note extended temptingly
towards him.</p>
<p>"I can rely on you, sir, that this ain't going to get me into any
trouble?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," was the unfaltering reply.</p>
<p>"The job is yours and the sixpenny tip that goes along with it."</p>
<hr>
<p>At a few minutes before half-past six, Harris, Sir Sigismund's secretary,
presented himself in the latter's improvised office.</p>
<p>"Your man Bostock has just rung up, Sir Sigismund," he reported. "Something
has happened to his magneto and he can't get the car to start, but he has sent
a friend who is quite reliable."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the silly ass keep his magneto in order?" Sir Sigismund
grunted. "I hate strange cars. He knows that. Let me know when the fellow
comes."</p>
<p>"He has just driven up, sir."</p>
<p>"Had the good sense not to keep me waiting, anyway," Sir Sigismund grunted.
"I'm ready."</p>
<p>As usual, Harris helped his employer into his overcoat, gave him his hat and
escorted him to the car.</p>
<p>"You've come instead of Bostock, eh?" Sir Sigismund asked.</p>
<p>The chauffeur touched his hat.</p>
<p>"That's right, sir," he assented. "Got a bit of trouble with his magneto,
Tom has. You'll find this car quite as comfortable."</p>
<p>"Hope I shall," his prospective passenger muttered. "Don't drive too
fast."</p>
<p>It was a blustery evening with squalls of rain and extremely dark. They had
scarcely turned out of the temporary gates when the car came to a sudden stop
by the side of the pavement. Whilst its occupant was struggling with the
speaking tube, a vicious outburst of profanity at the tip of his tongue, the
door was quickly opened and the man who had made the deal with Bostock, in all
his disfiguring motoring impedimenta, entered and took the vacant place by Sir
Sigismund's side. The car started off again immediately.</p>
<p>"What the devil?" the latter began at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>A hand was suddenly pressed over his mouth. The stranger leaned forward and,
although he spoke without haste or violence, what he had to say was
sufficiently alarming.</p>
<p>"If you take this quietly, my friend," he said, "it is possible that no
particular harm will come to you. If you call out or make a fuss you will get
it&mdash;just here&mdash;in the ribs&mdash;see?"</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund felt something hard pushed into his side and fear kept him
silent for several moments. The car swung round to the right, away from London,
and its terrified occupant realised now that they were heading back to the open
country.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" he demanded. "Who are you? I am not worth robbing but
you can have what I have on me."</p>
<p>"We are not robbers," was the prompt reply. "If you are a sensible man, you
will sleep in your bed to-night not one penny the poorer in pocket, so far as
we are concerned. There is just one condition, however. You have to keep your
mouth closed and do as you're told."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund saw then that things were indeed serious. There was another
man on the box and he realised that the chauffeur too must be concerned in this
affair, whatever it might turn out to be.</p>
<p>"Very well," he agreed, in a quavering treble voice. "I won't make any
trouble. You see, we passed a policeman just now and I didn't call out. But
tell me what you're going to do with me."</p>
<p>"We are going to put you down in the stalls of a theatre," his companion
confided. "You are going to watch the performance from start to finish, and
after that we shall set you down somewhere just outside London, and you can
take a taxicab home in peace and comfort. But&mdash;if you show any signs of
troublesome curiosity or if you open your mouth too wide, I shall pull the
trigger of this little affair which is caressing your ribs at the present
moment, and we shall leave what remains of you in the ditch."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund was too terrified to speak for several moments. Then he gasped
out:</p>
<p>"What nonsense is this about a theatre? There are no theatres in this part
of the world and I never go to them, anyway."</p>
<p>"Wait and see," was the laconic response.</p>
<p>They passed through a long stretch of semi-rural, semi-suburban country. Sir
Sigismund, with the cold hand of fear upon his heart, made no attempt to
attract the attention of any of the infrequent passers-by. All the time he felt
the pain of that hard object, whatever it was, against his ribs. He remembered
the stories he had read and at which he had scoffed of the "bumpings-off" in
Chicago, and he felt the perspiration continually breaking out upon his
forehead. There came a time when he could keep silent no longer.</p>
<p>"What harm have I done to anyone?" he pleaded. "You can take my money. I
have forty pounds in my pocketbook and my watch is worth almost as much."</p>
<p>His neighbour seemed to smile in the semi-darkness, only it was not at all a
pleasant gesture.</p>
<p>"We don't want your watch, neither do we want your money," he said. "This is
your evening out. You are going to have a little treat. Believe me, if you
behave yourself&mdash;I am telling you the truth&mdash;you can be drinking a
hot grog in your house at Hamilton Square within a couple of hours."</p>
<p>"You know who I am then?" Sir Sigismund demanded.</p>
<p>This time his abductor laughed.</p>
<p>"We don't put up a show like this for strangers," he said.</p>
<p>The hired car, with a great deal of puffing and groaning, began to climb a
long and steep hill. They seemed to have compassed a semicircle and were still
turning. At last they pulled to the side of the road at the summit of the
ascent. They had come to a standstill in front of a single, rather gaunt
looking house.</p>
<p>"This is where we alight, Sir Sigismund," his companion informed him. "I
don't think there is anyone within hearing, but I shall walk arm-in-arm with
you and there will be the same little trouble in store for you if you open your
mouth."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund had no idea of opening his mouth. He allowed his companion to
assist him up a dozen steps, through a miserable strip of garden, and waited
whilst the chauffeur, who had also descended, unlocked a flimsy front door.
They mounted a creaking staircase and passed into a room full of gloomy
shadows. Sir Sigismund shivered.</p>
<p>"Aren't we going to have any lights?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We are going to do without lights," his companion told him. "As a matter of
fact, they would interfere with the spectacle which I have promised you. Here
we are, in front of the window. You and I will sit together upon this
sofa."</p>
<p>"But what for?" his prisoner demanded piteously.</p>
<p>"No childish curiosity," the other admonished him. "There, now we're
comfortable."</p>
<p>They sat side by side on a hard couch. The window was bare of curtains and
Sir Sigismund realised that the hill they had climbed must have been of
considerable height, for below there was nothing to break the view of thousands
of twinkling lights stretching to the eastward and westward horizons all the
way to the City. He gave a little gasp as he pointed to four great crystal
globes enclosing a vast space below.</p>
<p>"Why, that's our land&mdash;the land for the factory!"</p>
<p>"Just so," his companion agreed. "The famous Woolito factory. The pride of
the commercial world. The pride, too, of the great Lord Marsom and his
henchman, Sir Sigismund Lunt, eh?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" the latter breathed softly. "Why not, indeed? Those four crystal
globes even at the present moment enclose the greatest triumph of commercial
and scientific attainment the world has ever known. You can shoot me to
pieces," he went on, with a faint spark of desperate courage, "but that will
remain."</p>
<p>His guardian took out his watch, struck a match and looked at it.</p>
<p>"Jove, we've run it finer than I thought," he muttered. "You have barely
five minutes to wait, my friend, before the curtain goes up."</p>
<p>"What curtain?" Sir Sigismund gasped.</p>
<p>The other poured some whisky from a flask into a silver cup.</p>
<p>"Drink this," he invited. "The room is chilly."</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund obeyed. His blood felt suddenly warmer and he felt his courage
returning. The window had been thrown open and the rain was beating in.</p>
<p>"You'd better have a blanket over you," his gaoler observed, taking one from
a bed in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Sir Sigismund drew it up to his throat and drank more whisky. The man who
had brought him from Tottenham was leaning out of the window, listening
intently. Suddenly his lips parted in a grim smile. From somewhere in the
distance came a faint regular sound like the ticking of a clock. A single light
was travelling through the sky.</p>
<p>"Jove," he muttered, "the man's a wonder!"</p>
<p>Across that chasm of mysterious space, through the open window to their
ears, came a sort of crackling roar, following upon a red, lurid sheet of flame
which shot up to the skies from below. There was another and a louder report,
which bent the trees in front of them like a hurricane, and which set the very
foundations of the house in which they were, to rocking. Now the very skies
seemed to flame. The whole countryside was lit up. From where they were, the
watchers could see plainly every little field and house for miles, men passing
like insects along the streets, motor cars and other vehicles lumbering along
the main road. The great open space below was as distinctly visible as though
the sun were shining, grotesquely spacious amongst those squares and streets of
miniature dwelling houses. Then there came another crackling report, a roar of
deeper sound, the rocking of the earth, and sheets of flame once more,
streaming up to the skies.</p>
<p>"The sheds!" Sir Sigismund suddenly shrieked. "My machine! God, where's the
telephone? My machine is there! It has taken me all my life to think out. It
took a hundred men three years to build!"</p>
<p>He felt himself held in a grip of iron or he would have thrown himself from
the sofa on to the floor, and from the floor through the window into the space
beyond. Movement, however, of any sort was a physical impossibility.</p>
<p>"Don't look away, Sir Sigismund," his guardian ordered. "There it
goes&mdash;the greatest triumph of modern commercial enterprise. There it goes,
the treasured secret, the glorious fruit of a man's brain. A life's work
flaming out in gasses to the sky. Don't look away, Sir Sigismund. It is worth
watching. It happened before, didn't it? It happened somewhere down in
Nottinghamshire. Not to your machine, but to a very wonderful one, all the
same. You may remember. It is not so long ago. You were responsible for what
happened there. Don't forget that."</p>
<p>Through the weird lights which flamed into the room his torturer could see
his victim's eyes straining out towards the holocaust. Sir Sigismund's whole
body was throbbing, his breath was coming in choked sobs and groans. His
guardian poured more whisky down his throat. For a moment the suffering man
found his voice again in one unearthly shriek, then he collapsed upon the
sofa.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>Lord Marsom, seated the next morning in a high-backed chair at the end of
the long table in his library, had the air of a man very much in his element.
He had a far more suitable apartment close at hand but one of his passions in
life was for space. He liked large rooms and spacious surroundings. On his
left-hand side Crooks, his private secretary, was taking down at lightning
speed the thirtieth letter which had been given him without a pause. On his
right Frances Moore was seated with a fat notebook in front of her, studying
the many pages of instruction and direction which she had received that morning
with regard to the press handling of the strange disaster at Tottenham. Marsom
was smoking a long cigar, and an empty half-bottle of Veuve Clicquot, the
contents of which had been poured into a silver tankard, stood by his side. One
of the three telephone bells tinkled. Andrew Crooks stretched out his arm and
answered it.</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook has called, sir," he announced.</p>
<p>"Sandbrook! What the hell does he want?"</p>
<p>Crooks coughed dubiously.</p>
<p>"I understand that he merely asked if you were at home, milord."</p>
<p>"I will see him," Marsom decided, without further hesitation.</p>
<p>Crooks gave instructions and rose to his feet. His employer waved him to the
door.</p>
<p>"You can be getting on with what I've given you," he directed. "Come back in
half an hour. No, you stay where you are, Miss Moore," he added, as she also
rose. "There are mornings when I don't want you out of my sight. This is one of
them. I have a great many ideas...."</p>
<p>Sandbrook brought with him a pleasant odour of the fresh air and the perfume
of violets, a bunch of which he wore in the buttonhole of his blue serge coat.
As usual, he was gracious, cheerful and inscrutable.</p>
<p>"Felt I must come and offer you a word of sympathy," he remarked, making
himself comfortable in the chair which the butler had wheeled up, refusing the
cigars but accepting a cigarette. "Most extraordinary thing, that fire last
night. I have been reading about it in the <i>Times</i>."</p>
<p>"Lucky for us the factory was not built," Marsom grunted. "Lunt's wonderful
machine has gone into thin air, though, I'm afraid, and they tell me there
isn't a scrap left of the model."</p>
<p>"Any theories as to how the fire started?" Sandbrook enquired.</p>
<p>"Not the ghost of one."</p>
<p>"The police&mdash;" Sandbrook began.</p>
<p>Marsom snapped his fingers contemptuously.</p>
<p>"That for the police&mdash;" he scoffed. "They can't even make up their
minds how the explosions were caused."</p>
<p>"The papers talk about bombs dropped from an aeroplane," Sandbrook
ventured.</p>
<p>"Don't believe a word of it," Marsom scowled. "And look here&mdash;Miss
Moore! Where are you, Miss Moore?"</p>
<p>"I'm here, Lord Marsom," Frances said quietly, from a few yards in the
background.</p>
<p>"Show Lord Sandbrook that ridiculous communication. He's not a director yet,
but he soon will be, so we may as well take him into our confidence."</p>
<p>Miss Moore handed a card across to the visitor. He adjusted his eyeglass and
read the inscription with the utmost seriousness. A single sentence was
beautifully printed in old English characters across the glossy surface.</p>
<blockquote>THIS COMES TO YOU WITH SINCERE COMMISERATION<br>
FROM ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE FACTS AND WHO VENTURES TO REMIND<br>
YOU THAT BLUNT'S MACHINE WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE AT CROYLTON<br>
MILLS IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE.</blockquote>
<p>"What the mischief does that mean?" Sandbrook enquired.</p>
<p>Marsom shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"How can I tell?" he snarled, with a wicked twist of the lips. "How can
anyone tell? All that we know is that one of the mills we took over in
Nottinghamshire was called the Croylton mill, and that they had a machine there
working on somewhat the same lines as Lunt's. It was a very inferior affair but
it made the stuff, somehow or other. As to who sent this card or what the idea
is, we cannot any of us imagine."</p>
<p>"Shown it to the police?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," was the gruff reply. "We don't want too much fuss in the
papers."</p>
<p>"So far," Sandbrook remarked, with a glance towards Miss Moore, "they seem
to have been singularly reticent about the affair."</p>
<p>"You think so, do you?" Marsom grunted. "Well, that's a feather in Miss
Moore's cap. She's our publicity agent and her instructions to the newspapers
were to cut it out as far as possible. We don't want sympathy from our rivals
or the public. The loss of one machine can't do much harm to the firm of
Woolito, however valuable it was."</p>
<p>There was a quality of very real admiration in Sandbrook's expression as he
looked across at the scowling, contemptuous figure in the high-backed
chair.</p>
<p>"You must allow me to congratulate you upon your attitude, sir," he said.
"If this unfortunate incident, as one might surmise from the card, is really
the result of malice on the part of anyone, or any group of people&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why the hell should it be?" Marsom interrupted fiercely. "We are only an
ordinary trading company. We do not wage war against our competitors. We do not
cut their throats with prices, either. If anyone can sell cheaper than we do,
let them try."</p>
<p>"If your fellow directors share your spirit," Sandbrook remarked, "no
business opposition is likely to do you any harm."</p>
<p>"I don't care whether they share it or not," Marsom continued obstinately.
"I could do without the lot of them. Lunt is all smashed to pieces. Got some
cock-and-bull story about having been dragged to a deserted house to watch the
fire. They're taking him to a Nursing Home for a month. We don't do business on
hand-to-mouth principles. We are prepared for anything that may turn up. I've
already signed the contracts with half a dozen engineers for the rebuilding of
the machine and we are laying the foundation stone for the larger part of the
factory next week. The machine is a loss, of course, but we shall have another
one in its place within two months, as near as possible like it. As for the
model, that was only a plaything, anyway. Hurry and make up your mind, young
man. I'll make better than a guinea pig of you, if you come on the board at
once. You shall work if you have any fancy for it."</p>
<p>"I'll have to wait until the will is proved," Sandbrook insisted.</p>
<p>"We'll fix the shares."</p>
<p>"I'd rather come in on my own, thanks."</p>
<p>The telephone began to clatter. Crooks made discreet re&euml;ntrance and
Sandbrook, feeling somehow the recurrence of the whirl of activity which his
visit had interrupted, took swift and silent leave. In the hall he was escorted
in the best Marsom manner by a small bodyguard towards the door. On the way he
paused to admire a landscape of Turner's. The servants fell back respectfully.
He felt a tap on his shoulder. Frances Moore was standing there, a little
breathless.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom wants to know whether you will dine with him
to-night&mdash;just his daughter and himself?"</p>
<p>"Shall you be there?"</p>
<p>"Of course not."</p>
<p>"Sorry," Sandbrook replied. "Quite impossible. Thank his lordship all the
same."</p>
<p>She lingered by his side.</p>
<p>"What did you really think of that extraordinary card he showed you?" she
enquired.</p>
<p>"Some humorist at work, I should imagine."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she answered doubtfully. "Lord Marsom chooses to believe so."</p>
<p>"Put on your hat and come for a spin with me," he invited. "You look
pale."</p>
<p>"I am rather worried," she confided, "but of course, I couldn't leave the
house, even if I wanted to. Come into this small room. There are three other
Turners there."</p>
<p>She led the way into an annex of the hall.</p>
<p>"You can see the landscapes another day," she said. "I wish to speak to
you."</p>
<p>They stood together in the shadows of the dimly lit recess. Apart from the
faint expression of trouble upon her face, there was something in her eyes
which puzzled him, something almost of suspicion.</p>
<p>"Why did you come to enquire for Lord Marsom?" she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>"It seemed to me a civil thing to do," he replied. "He was a friend of my
father's."</p>
<p>"I should say not. Your father and he had disagreed. You look very like your
father. You have that sort of aloof air about you sometimes. I should have
thought that you would have shared his prejudices and outlook."</p>
<p>"Sorry if I'm dropping below form," he observed briefly. "After all, you
know, my father was very much of the older generation."</p>
<p>She reflected for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't suppose it's up to me to interfere," she decided at last.
"You seem to have the knack, every now and then, of making me suddenly
curious."</p>
<p>"Change your mind and dine with me to-night," he invited, "and whatever
curiosity you may have I'll do my best to satisfy."</p>
<p>"But you are engaged," she reminded him.</p>
<p>"It's an engagement which I could easily break."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, I accept," she replied promptly. "I don't go in for that
sort of thing as a rule, but if you are really going to become a director of
the Woolito Company, it might be just as well for us to be better
acquainted."</p>
<p>"Do you mind coming to my little house in Hill Street? More <i>intime</i>, you
know. I hate too much music and clatter if one wants to talk."</p>
<p>"Not before half-past eight, please. What number?"</p>
<p>"Eighteen, A," he told her.</p>
<p>She nodded and drifted away from him&mdash;a queer, but most attractive
figure she seemed in her over-gorgeous surroundings. Sandbrook followed her
slowly, with an occasional glance at the pictures. As he pushed back the
curtains, he came face to face with a young woman of a very different type.
They stared at each other for a moment in surprise. Then, with a little laugh,
she dropped the skirt of her riding habit and held out her hand.</p>
<p>"You are Lord Sandbrook, aren't you? I believe we did meet somewhere once
upon a time. I am Julia Pontifex."</p>
<p>"Of course we have met," he declared. "My father used to dine here often. I
see you have been having some exercise."</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Isn't it old-fashioned of me to ride so late? I was at that terrible party
of the Studleighs last night. Heaven knows what time I got home. You don't go
out much, do you, Lord Sandbrook?"</p>
<p>"I have only been back in England a short time," he told her.</p>
<p>"We were all so sorry about your father," she continued. "He was a very
popular person here."</p>
<p>"Bad luck on the old man," Sandbrook observed. "Just as he had found a new
hobby in life too."</p>
<p>"Are you going to take his place on the board?"</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom has been kind enough to speak of it. We have not come to any
definite arrangement yet. I must not keep you here, though. I expect you are
dying for your bath."</p>
<p>"I am dying for a cocktail a great deal more," she replied. "Come into my
sitting-room and I will give you one."</p>
<p>He strolled by her side across the very fine hall, which was a feature of
the house. She gave an order to one of the men-servants, who hurried swiftly
away. Another opened the door of a very charmingly furnished, but homelike,
apartment on the sunny side of the house. She threw down the jade-handled crop
she had been carrying and her bowler hat and smoothed her hair in front of the
glass.</p>
<p>"Looking rather nice this morning, aren't you?" he remarked cheerfully, from
the hearthrug.</p>
<p>"How do you know?" she laughed, happily conscious of the truth of his words.
"Notwithstanding our little bluff, I don't think we have ever met before in our
lives. I have seen you once or twice playing polo, and years ago at Lords', but
I was only one of thousands."</p>
<p>"To show you how wrong you are," he replied, accepting a cigarette from the
box she offered him, "you were pointed out to me once at Ranelagh. You were
with Janet Studleigh then&mdash;one of the leaders of the Bright Young People,
I was told."</p>
<p>"You were badly informed," she declared. "We are all as dull as we can be in
London nowadays. The people who ought to be staying at home and amusing us
spend their time in Abyssinia."</p>
<p>"Wonderful country," he assured her.</p>
<p>She indulged in a slight grimace.</p>
<p>"I find all travelling in foreign countries a bore," she confided. "I like
London, Melton, Argyllshire and Paris. I like to be in touch with my own kind.
Foreigners, even civilised foreigners, get on my nerves."</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of becoming a trifle insular?" he asked.</p>
<p>She flashed a sudden glance at him out of her really very beautiful brown
eyes.</p>
<p>"I am afraid of nothing in the world," she told him, "except of being
bored."</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a pity, Sandbrook thought, that the cocktail was served in a
priceless Venetian glass and that the shaker should have the appearance, at any
rate, of being fashioned out of solid gold. Otherwise it was excellently made
and the dry salted biscuits an agreeable accompaniment.</p>
<p>"Stay to lunch," she invited. "Father isn't going down to the City until
afterwards, I know, if that's any inducement."</p>
<p>"I have just seen your father," he told her. "I couldn't stay anyhow,
thanks. I am lunching at Sunningdale and playing a round of golf. Like you, I
have to keep myself fit."</p>
<p>"Do you ever ride in town?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Never. Except for a week or two at hunting now and then, I keep off a horse
when I am in England."</p>
<p>She refilled his glass.</p>
<p>"Melton was great fun this year," she reflected.</p>
<p>"So I heard. I missed that, of course. I was searching for a lost tribe in
Mesopotamia."</p>
<p>"That sounds Biblical," she remarked.</p>
<p>"Nothing Biblical about those fellows," he assured her. "They have ugly
habits with strangers, as a rule. Anyway, I have to leave them alone now and
settle down at home."</p>
<p>"You lost your father and your mother whilst you were away this time, didn't
you?" she asked, a little more gently.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"My mother had been ill for a very long time," he said. "My father's death
was a great shock, though."</p>
<p>"We are both only children," she told him, leaning over and lighting a
cigarette.</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Debrett. My father rather dislikes me for not having been a boy. I think
he's lucky. I have no head for business and I am far too fond of the unusual. I
like, so far as I can, to live my life differently than anybody else."</p>
<p>"How do you succeed in doing that?" he asked.</p>
<p>She smiled. She had a frankness of manner when she looked him in the eyes
which he rather liked, although behind it all there lurked a sort of eagerness
which puzzled him, a touch perhaps of her mixed origin.</p>
<p>"I have known you for half an hour," she said, "but that is scarcely long
enough for me to tell you all my secrets. Cultivate me and you will find them
out easily. I am voluble&mdash;especially when I talk about myself&mdash;and I
like people who are interested in me."</p>
<p>"I shall make you the study of my life," he promised her. "To show you how
quick of understanding I am, I know that you are dying for your bath."</p>
<p>"Your first mistake," she told him. "I am dying for you to stay a little
longer."</p>
<p>He held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I will take my leave," he said, "before I make any more mistakes. As a
matter of fact, I shall be late for lunch as it is, and it gets dark so
early."</p>
<p>She touched the bell.</p>
<p>"Come and see me again," she invited. "I am at home, as a rule, from six
till eight&mdash;except opera nights&mdash;and twelve to one. If you take the
trouble to let me know when you are coming, I shall be sure to have no one
interesting here to distract your attention."</p>
<p>"A telephone message?"</p>
<p>"I have a number of my own," she confided. "It is not in the book. 37-70
Mayfair. There are just six people who know it. You make the seventh."</p>
<p>The door was thrown open, the procession outside was reformed. She indulged
in a little grimace as they parted in the hall.</p>
<p>"Sorry about this sort of thing," she remarked, with a wave of the hand.
"Dad is so Oriental and it pleases him."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>At eight o'clock on the same evening Martin Sandbrook was standing in his
library with his back to the fire, smoking a cigarette and reading the evening
paper. At half-past eight he had thrown the latter down and was walking
restlessly up and down the little apartment. At twenty minutes to nine he was
staring savagely at the clock. Thirty seconds later the front doorbell rang. He
listened to the voices in the hall and his expression relaxed. From the bottles
prepared for that purpose upon a side table he mixed a cunning decoction and
poured it upon the ice, which was already in the shaker. He was wielding the
latter vigorously when the door opened and his butler announced Miss Moore.</p>
<p>"What a lovely sound," she exclaimed. "And don't I need one!"</p>
<p>They shook hands with a touch of formality, then he wheeled an easy chair to
the fire.</p>
<p>"I have more congratulations to offer you," he confided, as he poured out
the cocktails.</p>
<p>"You'll turn my head," she murmured.</p>
<p>"I could never have believed," he continued emphatically, "that an incident
like the destruction of the Lunt machine up at Tottenham, which was certainly a
most melodramatic affair, could have taken a back place in the newspapers
within twenty-four hours, as it has done."</p>
<p>"The advertisement columns supply the explanation," she pointed out a trifle
cynically.</p>
<p>"Yours is practically a new profession in this country," he reflected, "but
I should say that your vogue would soon spread."</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders&mdash;a slightly weary gesture. Apparently she
was, at the moment, disinclined for general conversation. He refilled the
glasses and stood on the rug, looking down at her. In her plain evening dress,
the severe but beautifully fitting lines of which he was too experienced not to
appreciate, her hair rather low at the back and plainly brushed away from her
forehead, without a trace of artificial colouring on her lips or cheeks, he
felt that, notwithstanding the slight hardness of her mouth and those telltale
little lines at the corners of her eyes, she was sufficiently unusual to
satisfy a person of even his somewhat exacting taste. What she lacked in the
softer graces she seemed to make up for in dependability.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes suddenly.</p>
<p>"Aren't you rather staring at me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I'm the rudest person in the world, I know," he admitted. "I didn't expect
to see you looking so nice."</p>
<p>"Am I dressed above my station?" she enquired. "You see, we don't look at
things in quite the same way over in New York as you do here. I suppose a
secretary should do her shopping in Oxford Street or in one of the huge stores!
On the other hand, I earn a very considerable salary and I have nobody to spend
it on except myself."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that large salary," he said, "because I suppose I shall
have to give you a raise when you come to me."</p>
<p>"I shall never come to you," she assured him.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because I can't see the slightest possibility," she replied, "of your ever
offering me any work as interesting as the work I'm doing."</p>
<p>He indulged in a little grimace and at that moment the butler announced
dinner. They crossed the hall into the dining room. The rather formidable, long
table had been dispensed with, and a small round one was drawn up to the fire,
with shaded lights and a great bowl of red roses in the centre, substituted for
the more formal decorations. It was attractive enough to justify her
exclamation of pleasure.</p>
<p>"It does look cosy, doesn't it?" he assented, "On the whole, I think dining
at home is good. I don't know a restaurant in London where the chairs are
really comfortable or the music, at some time or another, isn't too loud.
Besides, we can talk seriously here, if we want to."</p>
<p>"Have we anything serious to talk about?" she asked, as she helped herself
to caviar.</p>
<p>"That depends on your outlook," he replied. "I think myself that there is
something peculiarly attractive in the first real
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te between two people, one of whom at least is
interested in the other."</p>
<p>"Very nicely put," she murmured.</p>
<p>"You must remember that I scarcely know a thing about you or your life."</p>
<p>"There I have the advantage," she observed. "Debrett is eloquent about you.
There is, fortunately, no volume published that you can buy, in which you can
read about my parentage and doings in the world."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, on the whole, I am glad," he confided. "I like to come to my own
conclusions in my own time&mdash;concerning the things that matter."</p>
<p>"If you ever find it worth while."</p>
<p>They dined pleasantly and exceedingly well. Frances Moore showed adequate
appreciation of her host's really excellent cook, and she also approved of the
old Hock and single glass of champagne she was offered. All the time, however,
both were conscious of the fact that there was a certain element of fencing in
their conversation. It was a conversation of tongues rather than of hearts, or
even of intelligence. Sandbrook was relieved when she acquiesced so easily in
his suggestion that they should take their coffee in the other room.</p>
<p>"This," he decided, when their chairs were wheeled up to the fire, the table
with coffee and liqueurs was between them, and their cigarettes were lit, "is
the hour for confidences."</p>
<p>"Give me yours, then," she suggested.</p>
<p>His smile had almost the guilelessness of a child's.</p>
<p>"But I have no secrets," he assured her blandly. "My life is an open book.
The volume you speak of will even tell you where I was educated, what job I had
during the War, in what countries I have been travelling&mdash;in fact, it
brings me almost up-to-date. About you, on the other hand, there is all the
time the aura of mystery. Why do you work for that brave old
scoundrel&mdash;Marsom? Why do you work at all?"</p>
<p>She reflected for a moment.</p>
<p>"The Woolito job is the most interesting one I have ever had," she declared.
"I work because my income is too small for me to exist comfortably without
working. But frankly&mdash;I enjoy it. I enjoy my independence and I enjoy my
independent life. There is no mystery about me at all. My father is a
government official at Washington, and my mother keeps house for him and
entertains his friends. I have a sister who likes that sort of life and she
lives with them. So there we are. If your life is really as colourless as you
say, you might at least give me your opinion about something that is worrying
me."</p>
<p>"Of course I will, if you think it worth having. I warn you&mdash;I'm a
terribly prejudiced person."</p>
<p>"About people, perhaps, but not about events, I am sure. I should like your
honest opinion about that queer communication which was sent to Lord Marsom
after the destruction of the machine."</p>
<p>"Well, I should say," he replied, flicking the ash from his cigarette, "that
it came either from a lunatic or a wag letting himself go."</p>
<p>"Or someone in deadly earnest."</p>
<p>"I wish I could feel more interested in this misfortune which has assailed
your firm," he observed. "I must confess, however, that I can't. I don't really
care. What I do care about is your position as publicity secretary to a firm
which seems to me to be likely to come in for more than a spot of trouble."</p>
<p>"You would not suggest," she protested, "that I should leave the firm
because they have met with a quite insignificant reverse?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I would," he declared cheerfully. "I've had a look at that board and I
know what I think of them. They're wrong 'uns, Miss Frances. They've got the
evil eye, and they'll have it on you, if you don't mind. I hate the thought of
your working for such a lot of bounders. I don't believe I will ever bring
myself to become their associate."</p>
<p>She laughed almost naturally.</p>
<p>"But, my dear Lord Sandbrook," she exclaimed, "I get a thousand a year
salary and allowances, a private office in Basinghall Street and a room in the
Park Lane mansion! I have twice been invited to lunch with the family. I am not
responsible for the character of my employers. I consider my position a most
enviable one."</p>
<p>"What's a thousand a year?" he smiled across at her. "Turn me up in Debrett
again and see how many thousand acres I own. I can't remember. Think&mdash;if
you became my secretary, all those might be yours some day. I am very
susceptible, and I have never seen anyone in my life look so charming as you do
to-night."</p>
<p>"You're too flippant," she complained. "As a rule, I like a certain amount
of flippancy&mdash;it gives a sauce to conversation&mdash;but yours is too
obvious and a trifle too personal. You are the only man I have ever met who
would dare to say such things to me! Why do you think that I should ever want
to marry you?"</p>
<p>"Because of those acres," he answered. "Much better than a thousand a year
and luncheon once a week off the crumbs from the Marsom table! How did you
leave the old boy this evening, by the way? I'll leave off talking rot and be
serious, if you like."</p>
<p>"I have never known him more full of life," she said slowly. "He seems
absolutely dynamic. And yet, do you know, I have a queer idea about him? I
believe that underneath that overweening pride of his, he has had, ever since
he received that strange communication, an uneasy presentiment that someone
with brains connected with those Nottinghamshire firms which he has just driven
out of business, is working on some scheme of revenge. He doesn't know what
fear is but he is angry because he is up against something which he does not
understand."</p>
<p>"There's nothing for him to be afraid of, anyhow," Sandbrook observed. "You
don't get pushed off in this country for getting the better of your neighbour
if you can. You generally get a step up in the peerage. I wish they would give
it to old Marsom. A baron's is the most unsatisfactory title there is. A man
takes his own daughter about and every one of the uninitiated thinks he is on
the loose. Lord Marsom and Miss Julia Pontifex! Why, I doubt if they'd give him
rooms at the Metropole at Brighton!"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I don't understand these English side shows," she reflected,
with a smile.</p>
<p>"By-the-by, I met Miss Julia Pontifex this morning. She came in from riding
just as you left me."</p>
<p>"Lucky I had left you!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Frances shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. She is a very vivid and fascinating person, but she is a
little old-fashioned in some of her ideas. I do not think that women
secretaries meet with her entire approval."</p>
<p>"You mean that she is a snob?" Sandbrook asked.</p>
<p>Frances shook her head.</p>
<p>"I should not call her that. She is too intelligent. She simply does not
understand why we exist. I honestly believe that if I met her in the street,
she would not recognise me."</p>
<p>"That's quaint," he observed.</p>
<p>"She is an interesting study," Frances went on. "She is so terribly keen and
alive to the surroundings and people she affects that outside them the world
does not exist. Did you see her picture in last year's Academy?"</p>
<p>"I was not in London," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"It was by a great artist and it was a marvellous piece of work. I never
could have believed that anyone could have thrown on to canvas that intense
inner vitality, that almost throbbing sensuousness which she undoubtedly
possesses. Yet there they are. Julia Pontifex is a very attractive personality,
Lord Sandbrook. I know at least half a dozen men who would marry her, if they
could."</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised," he observed. "You used a good word just now. She is
vital. You can almost feel the life throbbing in her when she talks to you. She
reminds me of one of the great Biblical heroines&mdash;almost too colourful for
this generation."</p>
<p>There was a brief silence. Sandbrook was haunted for a moment by that vision
of the slender girl with the proud lips and the mocking eyes, with their
partially revealed depths. He tapped another cigarette upon the table and lit
it.</p>
<p>"Miss Frances Moore," he said, "I am going to talk seriously to you."</p>
<p>"This is very sudden," she complained. "I don't feel that I have had
sufficient preparation."</p>
<p>"I am not going to ask you to be my wife, but if I dared offer you a piece
of advice, it would be this. Chuck that job. It's as plain as a pikestaff that
someone has got their knife into Woolito, Limited&mdash;someone who means
business. It's all very well for us men who are likely to get something out of
it to stick to our guns, but you will only get yourself into trouble fighting
an unpopular cause all the time."</p>
<p>"I shall do my duty," she declared. "I have been well treated there and if I
don't altogether approve of their methods, I have come across nothing which I
think directly dishonourable. Would you mind asking your man to fetch me a
taxicab?"</p>
<p>"Already?" he protested.</p>
<p>"It's ten minutes to eleven," she pointed out. "We loitered over dinner. I
ought to be round at Park Lane at eight-thirty to-morrow morning. I have
appointments with newspaper men practically the whole of the day."</p>
<p>"What a job!" he scoffed. "You promise them so much advertising and they
tone down their news for you. You call that an honest woman's career in
life!"</p>
<p>She laughed gaily.</p>
<p>"My dear host," she assured him, "it is most amusing."</p>
<p>The servant answered the bell.</p>
<p>"A taxi and my coat and hat, Groves," Sandbrook ordered.</p>
<p>"Unless," she said, as the door closed, "you are going to that mysterious
place which Englishmen call their club, you won't want your coat and hat."</p>
<p>"Mayn't I see you home?" he begged.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"I live in the most respectable Mews in London," she confided. "Even to go
back in a taxi gives cause for scandal."</p>
<p>"But if I don't get out?"</p>
<p>"The white of your shirt would be seen glistening. These idiots of taxicab
men always stop under a lamp. Do you mind? It is quite a warm evening and I
feel like leaning back, pulling my fur up around my neck, having both windows
down and resting for a time. I have had rather a rotten day."</p>
<p>"Why, of course, I don't mind," he replied. "I've bored you as it is, I'm
afraid."</p>
<p>She gave him both her hands with a delightful little gesture.</p>
<p>"You are the nicest man I've met in England," she said. "You are very nearly
the nicest man I have ever met in my life. It is just bad luck that for the
moment you present rather a problem to me. Never mind&mdash;I like you."</p>
<p>"And for all my chaff, and I indulge in it too often," he rejoined, "I like
you. You have read enough of your country's fiction, I am sure, to know that an
English earl is bound to be an ass. Perhaps I am, but I have seen enough to
approve of you. I may tell you so again some day."</p>
<p>"And this," she remarked, turning back as he stood upon the doorstep, "is
where you intrigue me. I cannot make up my mind whether you are one of the
pleasantest idiots in the world or a very clever and determined person, who
means having his own way and is getting it."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"Pull both windows down," he advised, "wrap the fur closely around you, lean
back in the corner and smooth the hair off your forehead, think hard and you
may solve your own conundrum."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Julia Pontifex was riding a little listlessly down Rotten Row the next
morning when she heard the sound of horse's hoofs behind. She looked up just as
Sandbrook cantered to her side and if he had been a vain man he would certainly
have been flattered by the sudden animation which lightened her face.</p>
<p>"Why, Lord Sandbrook!" she exclaimed. "I thought that you never rode in the
Park."</p>
<p>"I very seldom do," he acknowledged. "I have to keep something in the
stable, though, for my young cousin, when he comes up from Eton. That's a
beautiful animal of yours."</p>
<p>She leaned forward and stroked the neck of the thoroughbred mare she was
riding.</p>
<p>"Yes," she admitted, "she's a wonderful creature. Father's Christmas present
to me. She has carried me twice a week down at Melton and never made a mistake.
Like everything else we possess," she added, a little bitterly, "she is as near
perfection as possible. Are you very rich, Lord Sandbrook?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not poor," he confessed, after a moment's hesitation. "You see,
my mother had a great deal of money. That's really what made my father take up
some of these City directorships. He hated being the weaker vessel
financially."</p>
<p>"And yet money is terribly unimportant," she said.</p>
<p>"Millionaires are generally the only people who have made that discovery,"
he rejoined.</p>
<p>"Don't dare to be sarcastic," she warned him. "I am not in the humour for it
this morning. I had to be hostess last night at one of Father's worst type of
dinner parties."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by 'worst type of dinner parties'?"</p>
<p>"The Woolito directors and&mdash;worse still&mdash;their wives. All City
people, bulging with money, oozing with conceit."</p>
<p>"Poor old Lunt was not there, I suppose?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"They say he won't be out for months. Of course, he is terribly unscrupulous
and very unpopular, but I am not sure that I have not more sympathy for him
than for some of the others. Mr. Somerville, for instance. He had to be helped
into the room, his gout was so bad, and yet he drank champagne as fast as they
could fill his glass! Oh, they're a horrid crowd."</p>
<p>"You have some friends of a different type," he reminded her.</p>
<p>She nodded shortly.</p>
<p>"A few. People of gentler manners and who bring a different atmosphere with
them&mdash;but they are all terribly obvious. They are either half-commission
young men on the Stock Exchange, or in the automobile trade, or wine men. They
are charming for a time and then they open out. They want something."</p>
<p>"Aren't you by way of being a little bitter this morning?" he asked.</p>
<p>"So would you be if you had been hostess at that dinner party last night,"
she retorted. "Sir Alfred Honeyman on my left, trying to fashion clumsy
compliments. I detest that man. I am sure he is not honest."</p>
<p>"I'm getting interested in your dinner party," he confided. "Who sat on your
right?"</p>
<p>"Lord Hildreth."</p>
<p>"The banker?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"That's why he came, I suppose. They say that he is a man of great social
gifts. If so, I must be a girl of immense perspicacity, for I found everything
he said tactless and his attitude almost offensive. He seemed to be trying to
impress one with the fact that he was only there because Woolito, Limited, was
one of his largest accounts and that socially he was entirely out of his
element."</p>
<p>"Pompous old man, anyway," Sandbrook observed. "You take these people too
seriously, Miss Pontifex. They are not worth it. I am sure you have plenty of
other friends who are more amusing."</p>
<p>"I call friends people who like you for your own sake," she said, looking
across at him. "I know very few people like that. There is one ingenuous youth
who sends me roses every day. I remonstrated with him once because I know that
they cost a great deal of money, and he only laughed. 'The firm pays,' he
assured me, as though it were a joke. They are trying to get an order from
Father for three new motor cars! He even hinted at an afternoon at Ranelagh or
Hurlingham, if the thing comes off.... One more turn and I must go home. Do you
mind if we go up to the top and out by Stanhope Gate? I shall climb another
step up the ladder if the right people see us together!"</p>
<p>"I believe you are making fun of me," he complained.</p>
<p>"Impossible," she replied, a faint note of sarcasm in her tone. "On the
contrary, I ask myself why you trouble to be decent to me. You have nothing to
gain from the Woolito Company or Father or any of us."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I like you," he suggested.</p>
<p>"And perhaps you don't," she rejoined drily. "I wish you did. Nothing would
give me greater pleasure than to be liked by you&mdash;but somehow I have
instincts. Whatever reason you have for taking notice of me, I do not think it
is affection."</p>
<p>"If you only knew how wrong you are," he smiled. "To tell you the truth, you
possess one of the qualities I like immensely. You are candid. You tell the
truth and you tell it as though it were a natural gift. I have not made up my
mind yet whether I like your father and my probable future fellow workers or
not, but I am sure that I like you."</p>
<p>She laughed more naturally and without that tinge of bitterness. The ride
had brought colour to her cheeks. She sat her mare gracefully and there was a
pleasant curl about her lips and flash in her eyes as she challenged him.</p>
<p>"Very well, then," she exclaimed, "come in and have a cocktail with me."</p>
<p>"I was hoping that you would ask me," he told her.</p>
<p>In the hall they met Marsom just leaving for the City. He stared at them in
some surprise but with grim approval.</p>
<p>"I met Lord Sandbrook riding in the park, Father," she explained. "He is
coming to have a cocktail with me."</p>
<p>"Give him some of my old sherry instead," Marsom suggested. "Beastly things,
cocktails. Ruin your taste for wine. You will find that out for yourself, young
fellow, before you reach my age."</p>
<p>"I haven't the slightest doubt but that you're right, sir," Sandbrook
replied. "The trouble of it is that I like cocktails&mdash;not so much the
taste of them, perhaps, as the misty appearance, the appetising snap."</p>
<p>"Never tasted one in my life," Marsom broke in, with his usual steam-roller
disregard for niceties of conversation. "Stay to lunch, young fellow, if you
want to. Julia will look after you. Sha'n't be back myself. I'm going to the
City for an hour or two."</p>
<p>He passed on without waiting for a reply, dressed for the City in the old
fashion, in dark overcoat, a freshly plucked gardenia in his buttonhole, his
silk hat already on his head. Julia looked after him and laughed softly.</p>
<p>"Rather breath-taking, isn't he?" she remarked, as she led the way into her
sitting-room. "Why don't you stay, Lord Sandbrook, if a luncheon <i>&agrave;
deux</i> would not bore you? I sha'n't offer to import a chaperon, although it
would be rather intriguing to feel that one needed one!"</p>
<p>"Don't forget that I am just home from a savage country," he reminded her,
as he watched his glass being filled. "Some of those Abyssinians have queer
habits with their womenkind."</p>
<p>"But I'm not one of your womenkind."</p>
<p>"You're one of my race, anyway."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that I am that. I am a Jewess."</p>
<p>"Well, you're an English Jewess&mdash;and you certainly know how to shake
cocktails. I am only sorry that I cannot stay to lunch. I am having a formal
meal with my lawyer. We have to do that sort of thing once a week until my
affairs get settled."</p>
<p>She was frankly disappointed but she made no protest.</p>
<p>"Come another time when I am alone," she invited. "I will show you my zoo.
You know that I collect animals, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I have read about them in the newspapers and seen pictures of your lemur
cubs," he replied. "Would I do for an exhibit?"</p>
<p>"Too fierce," she laughed. "I wouldn't dare to keep you in a cage."</p>
<p>"I could be as mild as a canary, if I had company," he assured her.</p>
<p>"Well, that might be arranged, perhaps," she told him, with a slight
pressure of his arm. "You will come, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Of course I will," he promised. "I am not very good at luncheons, though.
The afternoons in London are horrible. I generally go down to one of my country
golf clubs, if I have nothing better doing, and have a round afterwards. What
about getting hold of two others and coming out to dance some night?"</p>
<p>Julia felt a thrill of pleasure which she took no pains to conceal.</p>
<p>"I should love it," she declared enthusiastically. "Must we," she added,
"have those two others?"</p>
<p>"Well, I think just now we had better," he decided, "I am in half mourning,
you see, and it would not do for me to be seen alone with an attractive young
woman like you! Aren't there any of your father's friends who have young people
in the family?"</p>
<p>"I suppose there are," she assented. "I could collect two others, of
course."</p>
<p>"There was a fellow named Somerville who was very civil to me at the meeting
the other day," Sandbrook meditated. "Has he no family?"</p>
<p>"He has a son and daughter," Julia admitted, a little doubtfully. "Maudie
and Joe. Maudie is quite nice in her way, but I'm not sure what you would think
of Joe."</p>
<p>"So long as you don't like him too much, I don't mind," was the
light-hearted response. "What about calling for you some time this afternoon
and we will go and invite them? It will be too late for me to get down to
Sunningdale, anyway, after my old josser has finished with me."</p>
<p>"Heavenly!" she exclaimed. "I will be ready any time after four."</p>
<p>"You're sure you are not overfond of this fellow Joe?" Sandbrook asked with
mock anxiety.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I dislike him exceedingly. What about Maudie? She's
rather pretty. Promise you won't flirt with her."</p>
<p>"My affections," Sandbrook assured her, "are already engaged."</p>
<p>"For such a nice speech," she told him, with a faintly inviting curl of her
lips, "you may give me a cousinly embrace and I will let you go."</p>
<p>Sandbrook laughed softly as he leaned towards her.</p>
<p>"I have not a girl cousin in the world," he said, "so I'll have to learn
what is expected of me."</p>
<hr>
<p>He left the house and climbed into his car with a faint sting in his blood,
a thrill of which he was somehow ashamed because of its element of
unnaturalness.</p>
<p>"What damned hypocrites we all are," he muttered to himself, as he thrust in
his clutch rather more brusquely than usual.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Mr. Archibald Somerville, director of the famous firm of Woolito, Limited,
and putative millionaire, was lying upon his couch, drawn up to a welcome fire
in the large drawing-room of his house in Hyde Park Square. He was suffering
from an attack of gout aggravated by his excesses at the recent dinner party
given by his chief, Lord Marsom, at his mansion in Park Lane. He was a large,
fleshy man, rubicund as a rule, but now flabby and grey after several days of
inaction. His bandaged foot was carefully adjusted upon a cushion and his
slovenly toilet was in forcible contrast to the expensive nature of his
surroundings. The role of semi-invalid had been bad alike for his health and
his temper. On a chair by his side was seated the young man from the City who
acted as his private secretary, and who had just completed reading aloud to him
an article from the <i>Commercial Review</i>.</p>
<p>"Damn these newspaper fellows," Mr. Somerville muttered, with a scowl. "They
ought to be clapped in prison for an article like that. Read the last paragraph
or so again, Ellis."</p>
<p>The young man obeyed without comment.</p>
<blockquote>"There is no doubt whatever that the economic laws of to-day have
either utterly destroyed or wilfully mutilated the old-time amenities of
commerce. Take the case of the man Thorpe whose suicide most of our
contemporaries reported last week. Josiah Thorpe, owner of the Hovell Mills
near Nottingham, was a man of integrity and very popular in the district. He
was an alderman of the city and next on the list for the Mayorality, an honour
which would have realised the ambition of his life.<br>
<br>
"One disastrous year brought him from prosperity to degradation. Through a
speculative and most unfortunate purchase of inferior yarn, the firm found
itself confronted with the loss of a whole season's business. At the same time,
their price lists for ordinary trade were categorically attacked by the great
Juggernaut firm of Woolito, Limited. The Thorpe concern held up for some time,
owing to its old connections, but that one disastrous speculation and the
battle of prices brought it down at last; brought it down, too, unhappily, in
the very year preceding the one in which Josiah Thorpe should have served as
Mayor. The firm went into liquidation, Josiah Thorpe resigned from the Council
and committed suicide in November, on the day of the municipal elections. The
whole assets of the estate were taken over by Woolito, Limited, a month later.
No one can find a word to say against one of the greatest English commercial
undertakings of the day, a business which owes a large portion of its initial
success to the then manager, Archibald Somerville, J.P. At the same time, this
is just a notable instance of the fact that business to-day is a battle fought
out without mercy, and with the spoils hung round the neck of the
victor."</blockquote>
<p>With a furious motion of his hand, Archibald Somerville sent the review
flying from the young man's hand. The latter, who was used to such ebullitions,
calmly picked it up and prepared to take his leave.</p>
<p>"Men ought to go to prison for writing such stuff as that," his employer
declared. "Show that article to Miss Moore, Ellis, and see that none of the
newspapers connected with that organisation ever get another advertisement from
us. Find out who printed the rag. See that they never get any of our work."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," the young man replied.</p>
<p>A parlourmaid, with flying cap strings and starched apron, bustled in. She
crossed the room almost to her master's couch before she made her momentous
announcement.</p>
<p>"The Earl of Sandbrook and Miss Pontifex have called, sir."</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville rolled over on his side.</p>
<p>"Who?" he demanded incredulously.</p>
<p>"The Earl of Sandbrook and Miss Pontifex, sir," the girl repeated. "What
with you being in the drawing-room, sir, I didn't quite know what to do with
them, as the dining-room is being cleaned and the morning-room is all in a
litter. Shall I show them in here?"</p>
<p>"Of course," was the emphatic response. "Don't keep them waiting, Agnes.
Hurry! Do you hear? Bring chairs. Let Mrs. Somerville know. There must be some
tea&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," the girl replied, hurrying out.</p>
<p>Sandbrook and Julia Pontifex were duly ushered in, passing the
crushed-looking little secretary hastening to make his escape into the hall.
There was a subdued excitement about Julia's manner and appearance which lent
an added and softened charm to her undoubted good looks. Her deep brown eyes
were almost brilliant and the colour upon her cheeks, faint though it was, was
entirely natural.</p>
<p>"We have come to enquire how you are getting on, Mr. Somerville," she
announced. "Lord Sandbrook was calling and he offered to motor me down. Father
said I was to get the very latest news and to tell you that if you are blaming
his port, it is because you didn't drink enough of it."</p>
<p>"Very good of you, very good, I'm sure," Somerville replied, struggling to
raise himself into a sitting posture, a gesture of politeness which was
frustrated by Sandbrook's kindly hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't distress yourself, please," the latter begged. "Don't attempt to
move. I hope you will forgive this unceremonious call. I thought you were
looking a little seedy the other day at the meeting."</p>
<p>"Most extraordinarily kind of you to look in," Mr. Somerville declared. "I
take it as a great compliment. Very pleased to welcome you here. My wife, too,
will be charmed. Do sit down, please. Sit down in that easy chair near the
fire. And Miss Julia, you tell your father I'll remember his message next time
I get a chance at that '70 Cockburn! I don't need to enquire about your health.
Never saw you looking so fit."</p>
<p>"I'm very well, thanks," the girl answered. "How are Maudie and Joe?"</p>
<p>Their father's reply lacked enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Maud's as well as any girl can be who keeps such late hours. Joe is giving
a bit of trouble, as usual."</p>
<p>"Joe's all right," Julia declared hastily. "You're too strict with him, Mr.
Somerville."</p>
<p>"How is the leg?" Sandbrook intervened. "That's the important matter."</p>
<p>"Better," the invalid admitted. "I shall be able to get down to the City in
about a week now. The doctor talks about sending me away for a change, though,
after I've had a look round."</p>
<p>A young lady, fluffy but rather nice-looking in an undistinguished way, came
hurriedly into the room.</p>
<p>"Sweet of you, my dear Julia," she exclaimed, embracing her friend.</p>
<p>Julia drew away after a very perfunctory bout of affection.</p>
<p>"This is Lord Sandbrook, Maud," she announced. "Miss Somerville."</p>
<p>Maud smiled pleasantly and shook hands.</p>
<p>"We came to enquire after your father," he explained. "I was so sorry to
hear that he was down with this wretched gout."</p>
<p>"It's better to-day, I think," the girl said. "Are you a fellow director of
the Woolito Company, Lord Sandbrook, like your father?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"I'm not a director of the company just yet," he confided. "As a matter of
fact, I might have been, but there has been some doubt about the disposition of
the family shares. I take a great interest in the Woolito Company, though, just
as my father did."</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook has been to see Dad continually," Julia broke in, a slight
undertone of triumph in her voice. "Perfectly sweet of him, I call it. They
ought to make him a director, whether he has any shares or not. I think what
keeps him off is my latest idea&mdash;that I shall go down either to the works
or the City, and establish myself as a typist!"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't be any good, dear," her friend assured her. "You would get
Worth to dress you and you would turn the heads of half the staff."</p>
<p>Julia glanced at her wrist watch.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we mustn't stay here talking nonsense any longer," she
announced.</p>
<p>"You must have some tea," Mr. Somerville begged hospitably, "or what about a
whisky and soda, Lord Sandbrook? Pre-war, I can promise you that."</p>
<p>"Nothing at all, thanks," was the firm reply.</p>
<p>"What are you doing to-morrow night, Maud?" Julia asked. "Lord Sandbrook and
I are going to dine and dance at Ciro's, and as he is in half mourning, we
ought not to be alone. We wondered if you and Joe would like to join us."</p>
<p>"Why, I should love to," the girl answered, with obvious surprise.
"And&mdash;well, I suppose&mdash;I don't quite know about Joe."</p>
<p>"Of course Joe can go," her father intervened emphatically. "If he has any
other engagement, he can put it off. I'll see to that."</p>
<p>"About nine o'clock, then," Julia said. "Good-bye, Mr. Somerville."</p>
<p>"Good-day, sir, and take care of the leg," Sandbrook added.</p>
<p>"I wish you could have stayed a few minutes and seen Mrs. Somerville," the
invalid regretted. "She's prinking, I expect, or having her afternoon nap."</p>
<p>"We wouldn't hurry her for the world," Julia insisted. "Besides, we really
must go. It is almost a spring afternoon and Lord Sandbrook drives so
marvellously that it is a perfect joy to be in the car...."</p>
<p>The parlourmaid was summoned and the two visitors took their leave. Maud
came back to her father with a thoughtful expression upon her face.</p>
<p>"Very polite of his lordship," Mr. Somerville, who was in high good humour,
declared. "I much appreciate his call. Most gratifying. You ought to be glad to
be going out with them, child. A very pleasant invitation, I call it."</p>
<p>"Of course, I'm glad," Maud agreed. "But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"I'm a little worried about Joe," Maud confessed.</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville turned back on his side.</p>
<p>"You've got your mother's disposition," he sniffed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Mr. Archibald Somerville was to receive yet another caller that afternoon,
whose visit was very little less welcome than Sandbrook's. Mr. Tobett was
announced and promptly shown in&mdash;a dapper little man, quietly dressed, of
slightly legal appearance, but with the air of one who is used to society. He
accepted an easy chair and duly commiserated with his host.</p>
<p>"I hope, Mr. Tobett," the latter said anxiously, "it is thoroughly
understood&mdash;I think it has been made clear in the Press&mdash;that the
outrage which resulted in the destruction of the famous Woolito machine was
entirely unjustified."</p>
<p>"I have seen nothing to contravene that point of view," Mr. Tobett
acquiesced graciously.</p>
<p>"One or two of the Sunday papers," Mr. Somerville went on, "had something to
say about the unpopularity of the Woolito Company, owing to their 'ruthless
methods of competition' and that sort of thing. There's a concealed attack upon
us, too, in the <i>Commercial Review</i> this week. They're dragging up the matter
of the Hovell mills again, just because of the suicide of Josiah Thorpe. The
charges are, of course, absurd. Competition is the soul of business. If weaker
concerns have pitted their strength against ours, they are foredoomed to
failure."</p>
<p>"I quite understand that," Mr. Tobett agreed. "You need have no anxiety on
that point. Affairs, I may say, are progressing quite satisfactorily and your
name is practically upon the list which the Prime Minister will sign within the
next few days. The only matter where a little investigation seemed
necessary&mdash;it is always necessary, where a hereditary title is
granted&mdash;is with regard to your family. We understand that Mr. Joseph
Somerville is your only son?"</p>
<p>"That is so."</p>
<p>"He was educated where?"</p>
<p>"At Harrow and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was only at Cambridge for a
short time, as we needed young blood in the works. Ours is a vast industrial
undertaking, you know, Mr. Tobett. The amount we pay in taxation makes us feel
sometimes proud and sometimes, I must confess, exceedingly unhappy. But there
it is. The heads of Somerset House know all about us."</p>
<p>"The reputation of your firm is unquestioned, Mr. Somerville," his visitor
murmured. "I have never had the pleasure of meeting your son, I think."</p>
<p>"He works very hard," his father explained.</p>
<p>"Is he interested in sports at all?"</p>
<p>"He takes an Englishman's interest in racing."</p>
<p>"Any athletic distinctions at College?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid not."</p>
<p>"Degree?"</p>
<p>"We fetched him away before he had time to enter for it."</p>
<p>"I see," Mr. Tobett murmured. "Just so."</p>
<p>"The amount we spoke of," Mr. Somerville said cautiously, "was satisfactory,
I hope?"</p>
<p>"Most generous," his visitor acknowledged. "Of course, you must understand,
Mr. Somerville, that my intervention in these matters is
unofficial&mdash;purely unofficial."</p>
<p>"I quite understand that."</p>
<p>"And it must never be referred to."</p>
<p>"Naturally not. One more word, Mr. Tobett. If it should come to be a
question of money, a few thousands would not break me. You understand, I
hope?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly, my dear sir. Perfectly."</p>
<p>Mr. Tobett declined refreshments and shortly afterwards took his leave,
making his way towards the sacred precincts of Whitehall. Mrs. Somerville
arrived in time to join with her husband in a little bout of
self-congratulation.</p>
<p>"The most interesting call, my dear," the latter announced, raising himself
on his couch. "Mr. Tobett, you know&mdash;most influential person. Sort of
private secretary to someone whom we won't name, eh?"</p>
<p>"Is it all right?" the lady asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"It will be announced next week&mdash;'On account of distinguished services
to commerce and generous gifts to charity.' That sounds all right, eh? But
remember&mdash;not a word. Not a word, Margaret. It must come as a surprise. We
must be completely taken aback. If Bomford got to know about it, he would never
be satisfied with the knighthood he's angling for. It must come upon us as
a&mdash;well, as a thunderclap. Not a word even to the children."</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville, who was a person of ample dimensions and florid complexion,
smiled happily into the fire.</p>
<p>"Don't you worry, Archie," she said. "I can keep my mouth shut as well as
most. All the same, I can't help smiling when I think of the airs that Amy
Honeyman puts on every time I see her. It's her ladyship's car, and her
ladyship's at home or not at home, every moment of the day. And her husband
just a knight! I'd love to be there when she reads it in the paper."</p>
<p>"You be sure she does read it in the paper," Mr. Somerville enjoined, "and
not hear it from any gossip that gets about. There's wheels within wheels in
this business&mdash;I can tell you that. Have you heard what else has happened
this afternoon?"</p>
<p>"I've not heard anything," the lady confessed. "I was that sleepy after
lunch I never woke till half an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Young Lord Sandbrook, son of the Earl of Sandbrook, who used to be a
director with us&mdash;he's the Earl of Sandbrook himself now&mdash;called.
Maud and Joe are to go to a dancing party with him and Julia Pontifex to-morrow
night."</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville was staggered. She sat forward in her chair, open-mouthed
and open-eyed.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul!" she exclaimed. "But what on earth brought the young man
here?"</p>
<p>"Julia Pontifex, as it happened."</p>
<p>"Is it just them four who are going?"</p>
<p>"So I understand. They're going to Ciro's Club to dine and dance."</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville meditated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Seems to me there must be a catch in it some way. Julia is a proud little
minx. She has never taken any notice of Maudie, or helped her to know people,
ever since they moved into Park Lane. She seems to have got hold of Lord
Sandbrook, all right, but I can't think what she wanted to risk showing him to
Maud for. Maudie would eat her head off for looks."</p>
<p>"Well, that's just how it was," Mr. Somerville observed. "Perhaps it isn't
etiquette in those circles for two to go out alone, and Julia thought, so long
as she had to have someone, it might as well be Maud. Anyway, the party's fixed
up, and after the money I've spent on frocks, if Maud doesn't look all that she
ought to&mdash;well, that's up to you, Mrs. S."</p>
<p>His better half purred with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Wherever she goes, there isn't going to be anyone that looks smarter or
more the real thing than Maudie," she declared confidently. "I've not let that
Frenchwoman dress her for nothing. She's IT with her clothes, Maudie is. If
Lord Sandbrook has got half an eye, it won't dwell on Julia Pontifex all the
evening, I can promise you that. The only trouble seems to me to be Joe."</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville raised himself a little higher still on his couch. There was
distinctly more life in his expression.</p>
<p>"Trouble with Joe is a thing we need not consider," he said firmly. "That
young man and me are due to have a few words, and they will come this very
night. He has responsibilities coming and he's got to realise them. To-night
will be a real chance for him. If he makes friends with Lord Sandbrook and gets
pally with a few of that sort, that's all I ask of him. There's money for
picking up in our business. He won't have to work as I used to, but he's got to
be a gentleman and act the gentleman, and if he won't do that&mdash;well, look
here, Mother, send him to me directly he gets in. Let me get this off my chest.
Joe is no fool if he does take a glass or two sometimes."</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville rose.</p>
<p>"I'll have a word with him myself, too," she threatened. "How's the leg,
Archibald?"</p>
<p>"I've not had time to think about it," he confessed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>Julia was ready and waiting when Sandbrook called for her on the following
evening. Under the mild but persistent supervision of her highly trained French
maid, she had abandoned her usual penchant for colours, and she looked
curiously distinctive in her grey dancing frock with a single string of pearls
and a wonderful ermine cape, which her maid slipped over her shoulders at the
last moment. Her hand crept into her companion's as she took her place in the
limousine.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," she sighed. "I wish we hadn't asked those others."</p>
<p>"It does seem a pity, doesn't it?" he agreed.</p>
<p>"Why were you so keen on having them?" she enquired curiously. "Maud is so
terribly obvious and Joe can be awful."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he murmured. "I don't know how I got the idea but I thought
they were your greatest friends."</p>
<p>"Well, don't make that mistake another time," she begged, "and please
remember that so far as I am concerned, at any rate, those silly days of <i>les
convenances</i> passed forever, I hope, while you were wasting your time in
Abyssinia. I go out with whomever I like, or rather I should do, if there were
anyone I did like&mdash;and I stay out just as long as I want to."</p>
<p>Her voice had dropped away to a whisper and her eyes were full of
invitation. Sandbrook did his duty and kissed the lips which were almost upon
his cheek.</p>
<p>"I don't want those others," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Got to make the best of it this time," he regretted. "We'll have an evening
to ourselves later on...."</p>
<p>At Ciro's the others had not arrived. They made their way down to the bar
and ordered cocktails, whilst Sandbrook sent for a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
and selected the dinner. Just as he had finished, Maud and her brother arrived,
the former in a very chic, but somewhat daring, confection of grass green.</p>
<p>"I do hope we are not late," the young lady gushed, as she greeted her host.
"They have been busy down in the City to-day, and Joe was so tiresome. You have
not met my brother, have you, Lord Sandbrook?"</p>
<p>The two men shook hands, and Sandbrook realised at once that he was in for a
bad evening. Joseph Somerville was certainly not an attractive young man. He
possessed heavy, flabby features, watery eyes and a distinct air of
dissipation. He was dressed with a good deal of superficial smartness, but
everything about him that could be wrong, was wrong. His diamond studs,
mercifully set in onyx, were too large and his tie was too small. He was a big
fellow, but he seemed, even so early in life, to have developed a slouch.</p>
<p>"What about a cocktail?" he demanded, almost before he had finished shaking
hands.</p>
<p>"I've ordered dry Martinis, unless you prefer something different,"
Sandbrook announced. "Shall we sit down again for a few minutes? Dinner won't
be ready for quarter of an hour."</p>
<p>"I'm all for that," Joe declared. "Been in the City all day. Terrible grind
it was, too. Charles," he added, signalling confidentially across to the
barman, "send me a double one...."</p>
<p>It was half an hour before they mounted the stairs to the restaurant. Julia
deliberately took her host's arm and drew him a little behind.</p>
<p>"I think, perhaps," she whispered, dropping her voice, "I ought to have
warned you about Joe. I don't know what it is about him, but anything he drinks
seems to go to his head so soon."</p>
<p>Sandbrook permitted himself an inward chuckle. He had watched the young man
consume six cocktails of full strength while he himself had disposed of two
lighter ones!</p>
<p>"Well, we'll go carefully at dinner," he promised. "I'm glad you told me.
Hope you'll like the table. I have a weakness for a corner and I don't care to
be too near the music."</p>
<p>The table was the best in the room, the dinner perfectly ordered and served.
Only the girls looked a little apprehensively at the size of the bottle
standing in a special ice pail, which sent Joseph into ecstasies.</p>
<p>"A jeroboam," Sandbrook explained. "They had only two in the place. I
couldn't resist ordering it&mdash;1911 wine too&mdash;but we needn't drink it
all."</p>
<p>"Needn't we?" the young man scoffed. "We'll see about that."</p>
<p>Perhaps the tactics of the party, provided they realised the necessity of
keeping the young man in good humour, were scarcely discreet. The two girls sat
on either side of their host and laid themselves out to attract and entertain
him. Joseph Somerville, next to Julia and on the outside, found himself
continually confronted by her shoulder and the little arc of her back. The only
person who spoke to him was Sandbrook, and a subject of conversation of mutual
interest was hard to arrive at. When the dancing commenced, Julia gave her
escort no chance of selection but drew him on to the floor.</p>
<p>"Does that young man," he asked, "ever drink too much?"</p>
<p>"My dear," Julia replied, "it's the scandal of the family. He's terrible.
That's why I was sorry you asked him out to-night."</p>
<p>"Well, no one told me."</p>
<p>"I ought to have done so," she confessed. "The only reason I didn't, so long
as we had to have someone, was that I didn't want to spoil Maudie's chance of a
night out. I thought that with you he would be on his best behaviour."</p>
<p>They resumed their seats after the second encore. Maud was looking miserable
and the contents of the Jeroboam were greatly diminished.</p>
<p>"Good wine," Joseph declared expansively. "Jolly good wine! Good wine never
did anyone any harm."</p>
<p>"Take it quietly, young fellow," Sandbrook advised him pleasantly. "That's
got to last us through the evening."</p>
<p>"No need for that," Joe expostulated, his hands in his trousers pockets. "No
need at all. They've got some more of the same stuff, I expect. Hi, wine
man&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This," Sandbrook interrupted quietly, "is my party."</p>
<p>"I can stand a bottle, can't I?" Joe demanded. "It's not much of a party,
anyway, with Maudie sulking like that and Julia too cock-a-hoop to speak to
anyone."</p>
<p>Sandbrook rose to his feet. Maud obeyed his gestured invitation tremulously
and he led her on to the floor.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord Sandbrook," she apologised, "I'm so sorry. Perhaps I ought not to
have brought Joe. He gets like this sometimes when he's excited. But you see,"
she went on, looking up at him piteously, "I don't often get a chance to go
out, and I could not have come without him. Are you very angry?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least," he assured her. "Don't let's think about it. He will
probably be all right presently. How well you dance! Don't let's think about
anything else but this waltz."</p>
<p>Maud was, as a matter of fact, a very good dancer. She had seen some
acquaintances who had recognised Sandbrook, she had heard one or two
complimentary remarks about her frock, and soon she was very happy indeed. They
had finished the encore before Sandbrook remembered the others. When they
returned to the table, they found Julia sitting alone, her expressive lips
curved in a faint line of contempt.</p>
<p>"Where's Joe?" Maud enquired anxiously.</p>
<p>"How should I know anything about your brother's movements?" was the cold
reply. "I didn't wish to dance, and after I had refused twice, he growled
something and got up and left me."</p>
<p>Maud was too ecstatically happy to worry. She looked at the bottle, however,
in dismay. It was very nearly empty!</p>
<p>"Perhaps he didn't feel well," she suggested weakly.</p>
<p>"He certainly didn't look well or behave as though he were well," Julia
remarked. "I am sorry to say so, Maud, but until he learns self-control, I
don't think you ought to bring him out with you."</p>
<p>"Then, what am I to do?" Maud asked bitterly. "There's no one else to bring
me. I must stay at home forever, I suppose. I would sooner do that than go to
dinner parties at Hampstead or West Kensington with Father and Mother."</p>
<p>"Look here," Sandbrook intervened, "there's no need to worry. If your
brother doesn't care for our company, he can look after himself, I'm sure, Miss
Somerville. I see a couple of friends over there by themselves, decent fellows,
both of them. Shall I ask them if they would like to join up, and then it won't
matter?"</p>
<p>An ecstatic suggestion! Two young men, one from the Foreign Office, the
other a soldier, were introduced and promptly accepted the situation. There was
an hour's dancing and everyone seemed to have forgotten everything about
Joseph. Then one of the managers approached Sandbrook respectfully and drew him
to one side.</p>
<p>"I think, if your lordship doesn't mind," he begged, "you had better step
into the bar. The gentleman who was with you this evening seems to have got
into trouble."</p>
<p>When Joseph Somerville, later on, endeavoured to reconstruct the events of
that evening, he was consistent in at least one thing. He placed the whole
trouble upon two perfectly amiable, and apparently harmless, strangers, whom he
had found at the bar during a visit which he had intended to be only a flying
one. He had perhaps drunk more than was good for him when he had entered, but
he could scarcely be called drunk. The two men, who welcomed him as an old
friend, and one of whom he was sure was, or had been, an actor, had invited him
to a stool by their side and insisted upon standing him a drink. His excellent
intention upon entering had been to drink the best part of a bottle of Vichy,
dip his head in a basin of water, and do his duty by his sister and his
distinguished host. His good resolutions vanished. He drank a double whisky and
soda when he ought to have drunk, if anything, a small brandy. The necessity
for counter-hospitality involved more refreshment&mdash;and more. Then the
trouble began. The barman actually had the impertinence to come round to the
front and try to induce him to leave! It was scarcely his fault that the fellow
was in bed for a fortnight because his head caught the corner of the table in
falling. And then the policeman&mdash;two policemen. As a sober young man,
Joseph was a coward, as he had proved on more than one occasion. Furiously
drunk, he was a madman. His new friend by his side laughed mockingly at the
sight of the nearest policeman.</p>
<p>"I bonneted a Bobby last week," he murmured. "Funny sight. Have a try. Whack
his helmet over his head."</p>
<p>"You watch me," Joseph declared vaingloriously.</p>
<p>Joseph bonneted the policeman, all right. When Sandbrook, in response to the
manager's summons, descended the stairs, he was just in time to see his dinner
guest being led off the premises by two stalwart constables towards a very
obvious destination. The assistant barman quitted his post and hurried out
towards them.</p>
<p>"Very sorry about your lordship's friend," he said uneasily, "but we could
none of us do anything with him. Poor Jimmy was most polite, but the young man
was raging drunk&mdash;raging drunk he was, sir. That was what was the matter
with him."</p>
<p>"I feel that I am the one to apologise," Sandbrook confessed. "All the same,
he was brought to my party. I never saw him before in my life. Let me know at
Hill Street to-morrow morning, please, how the barman is, and if there is
anything we can do for him."</p>
<p>Sandbrook reascended the stairs and rejoined the party, now a thoroughly
cheerful one.</p>
<p>"I think your brother must have gone home," he told Maud Somerville. "I
can't see any sign of him. What do you say to going on to the Embassy? They
have an extension and I know that Major Sandes wants to make a night of
it."</p>
<p>"We should love it!" the two girls declared in unison.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was found impossible to keep the evening papers away from Mr. Archibald
Somerville after the nurse had dressed his leg for the second time and
established him in his study for the rest of the day. Maud herself, however,
brought them in and Maud was accompanied&mdash;to Somerville's immense
surprise&mdash;by Lord Sandbrook.</p>
<p>"Father," Maud said simply, "you've been asking all the time about last
night. You will have to know the truth, so you'd better read about it. Anything
the <i>Evening News</i> doesn't tell you, Lord Sandbrook and I can."</p>
<p>"The <i>Evening News</i>," Mr. Somerville gasped. "Why, what's in the
newspaper?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you had better read the account, sir," Sandbrook suggested.
"Most unfortunate affair altogether."</p>
<p>"Damn it all, Maud, I can only read a few lines," Mr. Somerville exclaimed.
"Tell me about it; tell me about it quick!"</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook and I were dancing," Maud began. "I&mdash;I have never
enjoyed dancing like it before and I daresay we were some time. We left Julia
and Joe at the table. We thought they would dance too. When we got back, Joe
had gone and Julia was alone. Julia said that he'd been very disagreeable and
he had gone away for a few minutes."</p>
<p>"Was he drunk?" Mr. Somerville asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"He had had too much to drink," Sandbrook admitted. "It seemed impossible to
check him. He finished what amounted to nearly a bottle of champagne whilst we
were dancing. The last I saw of him, however, I should not have said that he
was drunk."</p>
<p>"What happened then?" Mr. Somerville demanded hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Well, Lord Sandbrook saw some friends sitting alone&mdash;two very
delightful men," Maud went on. "They joined up and we spent the rest of the
evening together. Lord Sandbrook went down into the bar to look for Joe, but he
was not there. We thought he must have gone home and we all went on to the
Embassy. Such a good time we had," the girl added, with a little break in her
voice. "Lord Sandbrook's friends were so nice. They had an extension at the
Embassy, and it was three o'clock before we broke up and came home. Lord
Sandbrook will tell you the rest."</p>
<p>"When I got back to Hill Street," the latter recounted, "I found an urgent
telephone message from Bow Street Police Station, begging me to come there and
bail out Mr. Joseph Somerville. I went round at once, but when I arrived there,
the sergeant told me that the charge was too serious for any question of bail.
He refused to let me see your son and recommended me to come round to the
Police Courts this morning. I did so, but I'm afraid I was not able to be of
very much service. If you wish to know exactly what happened, the evening
paper, which I see you have there, will give you a very fair account."</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville hoisted himself up in his chair. A curious change had taken
place in his appearance. He was no longer white and drawn. His cheeks were red,
his eyes staring.</p>
<p>"I can't read," he declared. "Something's hammering in my head. Tell
me."</p>
<p>"You must prepare yourself for something of a shock, sir."</p>
<p>"Get on with it," was the brusque reply.</p>
<p>"It seems," Sandbrook continued, "that your son went down into the bar, met
some friends, had more drinks and became quarrelsome. The barman tried to evict
him. He knocked him down and his head was badly injured against one of the
tables. He is now lying in hospital. They then sent for two policemen, one of
whom your son assaulted. He is also in hospital, suffering from concussion.
After that your son was taken to the Police Station. He was brought before the
magistrate at eleven o'clock this morning. I was there with Sir Anthony Jones,
the best lawyer I know, but unfortunately the magistrate took a severe view of
the situation. He refused to listen to the suggestion of a fine, and your son
was sent to prison for thirty days. The magistrate also advised the
representatives of the barman and the policeman to appeal in a civil court for
damages."</p>
<p>"My son," Mr. Somerville repeated slowly, "was sent to prison for thirty
days. How was the charge stated?"</p>
<p>"Violent and unprovoked assault and drunkenness."</p>
<p>There was a silence, only broken by Maud's barely restrained sobs. The nurse
came into the room.</p>
<p>"I think," she suggested, "that you had better leave Mr. Somerville now. He
is none too well, and if you've been telling him the news about Mr. Joseph, I'm
afraid he will be upset."</p>
<p>Sandbrook, only too willingly, took his leave, escaping with difficulty from
Maud's tearful and clinging hysteria. Mr. Somerville himself, after a brief
period of semi-stupor, seemed to completely recover command of himself. He even
discussed the tragedy with his wife quite lucidly.</p>
<p>"This," he decided, "is the end of Joe&mdash;in this country, at any rate. I
shall give him a thousand pounds and send him off to Canada, or wherever he
wants to go. I don't say I shall cut him off. I don't say there won't be more
thousand pounds to follow, but he is no longer an inmate of this household. Not
until he is a changed man."</p>
<p>They soothed him down and later on he slept. About seven o'clock another
visitor was announced.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tobett to see you, sir," the nurse told him doubtfully. "If his
business is likely to be at all important, I should postpone it for a few days.
You've had quite as much excitement as is good for you already this
afternoon."</p>
<p>"You show him in and don't talk so much," was the angry rejoinder. "Mr.
Tobett is a great friend. I'm ready to see him at any time."</p>
<p>Mr. Tobett, when he entered, had somehow the appearance of an undertaker.
His face was drawn and sad. He seemed figuratively to be walking on tiptoe. He
accepted the chair to which Mr. Somerville pointed.</p>
<p>"My dear sir," he began, "this is most unfortunate."</p>
<p>"It's a damn' bad business," Mr. Somerville agreed. "It's knocked me hard.
No good brooding about it. I shall pack the young man off to the colonies as
soon as he&mdash;as soon as it's all over. I didn't expect to see you
to-day."</p>
<p>"I felt it my duty," Mr. Tobett said, "to ask for an interview with you at
once."</p>
<p>"Why?" the man on the couch demanded.</p>
<p>Mr. Tobett cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"It seemed to me desirable," he explained, "to let you know the truth
without delay. No doubt you have already&mdash;er&mdash;surmised what the
feeling of those&mdash;er&mdash;responsible for such preferments as we were
speaking about must be. Any question of an inherited title, of a baronetcy, for
example, under the present circumstances would be quite out of the question.
Mr. Joseph is your only son and would be the apparent inheritor of the title.
Impossible, my dear sir, as I am sure you must see for yourself."</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville had raised himself still farther in his seat until he was
almost upright. Once more that unwholesome flush was on his cheeks and the
glassy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Do I understand you to say, Tobett," he demanded, "that I am not to have my
baronetcy because of this affair?"</p>
<p>Mr. Tobett half closed his eyes and shivered.</p>
<p>"We must not allude to these matters quite so plainly, Mr. Somerville," he
admonished. "Since we are alone, however, I may as well confess that you have
divined the truth. It would be perfectly impossible for any Minister of the
Crown&mdash;whatever the inducement&mdash;to recommend to His Majesty for an
inherited title a man whose son was in prison. Quite impossible, Mr.
Somerville. As regards a knighthood," he added, turning back on his way to the
door, "well&mdash;there might still be possibilities, but I should recommend
you&mdash;as an expert in these matters&mdash;to let it slide for a time."</p>
<p>"Blast your knighthood!" Mr. Somerville shouted.</p>
<p>The profanity of his invocation was regrettable, for these were the last
words Mr. Somerville was to utter on earth.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lord Marsom returned home from the funeral of his fellow director a few days
later, descended from his limousine and passed across the marble hall of his
palatial residence. He entered the small study which he sometimes used when
alone and took up one of the telephones on his desk.</p>
<p>"Send Miss Moore here," he directed.</p>
<p>Frances made prompt appearance. She gave one look at her employer standing
upon the hearthrug, and mixed a drink, which she brought from the sideboard. He
swallowed half the contents of the tumbler at a gulp.</p>
<p>"Are you still in touch with those thick-headed chumps at Scotland Yard?" he
demanded.</p>
<p>"More or less," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Order a car and take this over to them," he enjoined, throwing an envelope
upon the table. "It was attached to the handsomest wreath on the coffin. Read
it."</p>
<p>She drew out a highly glazed, thick card on which was beautifully printed a
single sentence.</p>
<blockquote>WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY AND ALSO WITH REVERENT MEMORIES OF ALDERMAN
JOSIAH THORPE, WHO WAS TO HAVE BEEN MAYOR OF NOTTINGHAM.</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Lord Marsom's Rolls-Royce car, a few evenings later, crept silently up to
the front door of Sandbrook's house in Hill Street, and Frances Moore, after a
trifling delay, was ushered into the library. Sandbrook, who had just returned
from a day's golf at Woking, and was still in his rough tweeds, rose
enthusiastically from the depths of his easy chair to greet her.</p>
<p>"Don't look so surprised," she begged, as he wheeled a couch up to the fire
for her. "You told me to come in any time I was around between six and seven
for a cocktail, and here I am! If I am a nuisance, please send me away. If you
can spare half an hour, help me, please, to forget an unpleasant
afternoon."</p>
<p>Sandbrook rang the bell and gave an order.</p>
<p>"What can I do further in the way of welcome," he asked, "beyond giving you
my best in cocktails and inviting you to stay to dinner afterwards? Tell me
about the disagreeable afternoon."</p>
<p>She drew off her gloves and folded them thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"At Lord Marsom's insistence," she confided, "and you don't know how
difficult he is these days, I have been down to Scotland Yard to see the
sub-commissioner."</p>
<p>"To Scotland Yard! Is there anything fresh, then?"</p>
<p>"Does there need to be anything fresh?" she demanded. "First of all, there
was that extraordinary destruction of the Lunt machine and the model of the
factory up in Tottenham. Even now neither the police nor the insurance people
have made up their minds exactly what happened but, although we got the Press
to make light of it&mdash;that has been my affair&mdash;it will probably cost
the Woolito people, taking into account the insurance, at least a hundred
thousand pounds, and they say that Sir Sigismund Lunt is next door to lunacy!
And now there is this terrible affair about young Somerville. Not that anyone
cares a snap of the fingers about him, but his father's sudden death is a
tragedy."</p>
<p>"But why associate the Somerville affair and the destruction of the Lunt
machine?" Sandbrook asked curiously. "I cannot see the slightest connection
between the two myself."</p>
<p>She looked across at him through the firelit gloom of the room with a
strange, speculative intensity in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Both of these disasters," she confided, "were linked up by those
extraordinary cards. Someone even dared to attach one to a wreath and sent it
to poor Mr. Somerville's funeral."</p>
<p>He nodded meditatively.</p>
<p>"I had forgotten about the cards," he admitted. "Even then, they are not
necessarily the work of the same person. Both Lunt and Somerville, according to
what one hears, might have made a lot of enemies. What was on poor Somerville's
card?"</p>
<p>"Something which connected him up with the disastrous closing of one of
those Nottinghamshire Mills," she said, watching him with curious
concentration. "The mill was owned by a man named Thorpe, who was to have
realised what was apparently his life's ambition the following month, and was
to have been elected Mayor of Nottingham. When the trouble came, he committed
suicide. Somerville was to have been made a baronet, but they cancelled the
whole thing as soon as it was known that his son was in prison. You must admit
that there is something there which seems more than mere coincidence."</p>
<p>"I don't admit it for a single moment," he declared, tapping a cigarette
upon the table. "A disaster happened to the Woolito machine up at Tottenham,
and one of the thousands of enemies the Woolito Company must have made sent the
firm a little card. They lose another director in poor Somerville, and what
more natural than that the same person should do the same thing? Probably, if
anything happens to old Marsom in the near future, his relatives will get
another one. I cannot see that the sender of the cards is in any way connected
up with the tragedy itself. What does Scotland Yard think about it?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk to me about Scotland Yard," she answered irritably. "I suppose
they think as you do. A dumber lot of mummies I never came across."</p>
<p>"Frankly," he assured her, "I don't know how you explained your mission, but
I should imagine they must have thought you were&mdash;well, a trifle
eccentric. Whom did you see there, by-the-by?"</p>
<p>"One or two underlings," she confided, "but I had a few words finally with
the sub-commissioner. He would not even discuss the Somerville affair as having
any possible significance. He admitted that they were still working upon the
destruction of the Lunt machine, but they had nothing whatever to report."</p>
<p>"That may have been the work of a lunatic," he suggested.</p>
<p>"Perhaps. The doctors tell us that there are plenty of apparently sane
people going about who are entirely unbalanced."</p>
<p>The cocktails were brought in. She sipped hers appreciatively and he
followed suit.</p>
<p>"Not long ago," he remarked, "I read a wonderful article by a German who had
a theory that quite half the world was really unbalanced, and that the
perfectly normal person was a rarity and only to be found amongst the genuine
primitives."</p>
<p>"Theories don't help us much in life," she sighed. "Usually they bear so
little relation to things that really happen...."</p>
<p>"Let us talk about something more frivolous," he begged, as he lit a
cigarette for her. "I can't bear to think that the moment will presently arrive
when you will insist upon going and we shall have spent the whole of our time
talking over the troubles of Woolito, Limited."</p>
<p>"For the moment, I'm obsessed," she admitted, looking up at him
deprecatingly. "I have not a single frivolous instinct in my body. I can't help
it."</p>
<p>"Have another cocktail?" he invited.</p>
<p>"Half a one, please, then I must go. I have to see the chief again before I
finish."</p>
<p>"How is the old boy?"</p>
<p>"He's still very much shaken," she confided. "It is not the pleasantest
thing in the world for a man at the head of a great business like Woolito,
Limited, to lose two of his principal directors, one of them permanently."</p>
<p>He passed her the replenished glass.</p>
<p>"Life," he observed, "is full of inconveniences. I dare say Lord Marsom will
get over it."</p>
<p>She looked at him severely.</p>
<p>"I wonder if you are as unsympathetic as you sound."</p>
<p>"I'm brimming over with sympathy, but why should I have any for Marsom?" he
demanded. "He has had his own way for a long time now, and a pretty ruthless
way, too, if people tell the truth. They say that he is one of the richest men
in England. What more does he want?"</p>
<p>"He wants you to be a director of the Woolito Company, for one thing. He
consulted me yesterday as to the best way of approaching you, so as to get a
definite answer on the spot."</p>
<p>"Well, he has chosen the best way, if he has sent you as his ambassadress,"
Sandbrook smiled.</p>
<p>"I don't believe," she said deliberately, "that you have the faintest idea
of ever taking your father's place on the board or of doing any work at all,
for that matter. You are just marking time until you can find an excuse for
getting back to Abyssinia."</p>
<p>"Clever girl!"</p>
<p>She snatched up her gloves and rose to her feet.</p>
<p>"I'm going," she announced abruptly.</p>
<p>"You can't do that," he protested. "You haven't finished your business."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Was not your business here to invite me to take a place upon the Woolito
board immediately?"</p>
<p>"Partly," she admitted. "You know you don't mean to accept, so what's the
use of talking about it?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, you can go back to his lordship and tell him that his
messenger has been successful."</p>
<p>Her face suddenly relaxed. Her eyes sought his sternly but wistfully.</p>
<p>"You're not in earnest?"</p>
<p>"But I am," he told her. "I found a telephone message from my lawyers when I
returned this afternoon. My affairs have been settled. I own a very respectable
number of Woolito shares and I am at your chief's disposition."</p>
<p>A smile broke from her lips. There was a great relief in her face.</p>
<p>"You don't know how I feel about this," she said softly.</p>
<p>"But why on earth should you attach so much importance," he asked, "to my
joining the company?"</p>
<p>She passed her arm through his in friendly fashion.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you," she confessed. "I have been stupid. I'm sorry now. I
have had stupid ideas. I hope you won't find the work too dull," she went on in
a lighter tone.</p>
<p>"If I do, I shall send for you to help me," he threatened.</p>
<p>She made a motion to withdraw her arm. He held it a little tighter, although
he made no attempt to draw her nearer to him. His eyes seemed fixed upon a
particular space in a distant corner of the room.</p>
<p>"It is sweet of you to worry about me," he said, "but you need not. You
ought to have realised by now that I am not a serious person. So long as I get
my golf, shooting and hunting in the winter, and my tennis and sea in the
summer, I am fairly well content at home."</p>
<p>"Just why are you going on the board of Woolito?" she asked him bluntly.</p>
<p>"Partly for the pleasure of acceding to a request of yours," he replied,
"and partly&mdash;for a purely personal reason."</p>
<p>She recognised the finality in his tone and asked no further question. At a
motion from her, he rang the bell and they walked together towards the
door.</p>
<p>"You have not told me anything about the dinner party," she reminded
him.</p>
<p>"And I never shall. I hope I never think of it again myself. It was a
hateful affair. Miss Pontifex, I admit, surprised me. I found her quite
charming."</p>
<p>"Everyone is interested in her," Frances remarked, a little wistfully. "She
knows all about the new schools of painting, of etching, of architecture, of
music. She can pilot an aeroplane as well as she can drive a motor car. She can
read French and Spanish as easily as she can read English. A very popular young
woman, I can assure you, and she is free to dine with you any night you
like."</p>
<p>"And you?" he persisted.</p>
<p>"I have to be entertained by a sub-editor and a paragraphist this week," she
confided.</p>
<p>"I should be such a rest after these brainy fellows," he laughed.</p>
<p>"When I feel that I need that," she promised, as he handed her into the car,
"I will ring you up."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>The major-domo of the great house in Park Lane drew Sandbrook to one side
for a moment after his myrmidons had taken into their charge the hat, coat and
gloves of the arriving guest.</p>
<p>"His lordship and&mdash;Miss Pontifex," the man confided, after a palpable
hesitation, "are in the library. They wish to see you for a moment before the
arrival of the other guests."</p>
<p>Sandbrook nodded and followed the speaker across the beautiful hall to the
carved door of the library. Marsom was standing there upon the hearthrug, in a
characteristic attitude, bolt upright except for his crouching shoulders and
neck&mdash;a huge figure&mdash;the precision of whose evening attire seemed
somehow curiously at variance with the unsubdued spirit of the man. Julia was
standing by his side and Sandbrook almost started at the sight of her. She was
dressed in white&mdash;a gown of apparently amazing simplicity, a gown which,
fashioned by anyone but an artist, would have seemed immodest in its glimmering
transparency and clinging outline. He wondered whether it was his fancy that
she was a little nervous. Her eyes seemed to have followed him from his
entrance. Although she scarcely spoke, she seemed to be asking him innumerable
questions.</p>
<p>"Sandbrook," Marsom said, in his usual harsh voice, "I wanted a word with
you alone before these other people came. You know that this is not a formal
dinner party, by-the-by?"</p>
<p>"I quite understood that," Sandbrook replied.</p>
<p>"Two things to say to you," Marsom went on. "I am damned glad, Sandbrook, to
hear the news. I could scarcely believe it when Miss Moore told me. I can't
tell why I wanted you on the board so badly, but I did and you have come. I
don't know what good you will be to us&mdash;very little, in one way, I should
think. We sha'n't ask for much work from you, but I wanted you there and I
thank you for coming."</p>
<p>He held out his hand and Sandbrook was thankful that his own were muscular
fingers or they would have been crushed.</p>
<p>"There's a piece of news for you too," his host continued, in a lighter
tone. "You know my girl here?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook smiled.</p>
<p>"Not as well as I should like to," he said. "Still, I think I may say that
we are acquainted, Miss Julia, mayn't I?"</p>
<p>"That proves you aren't," her father answered. "She isn't Miss Julia any
longer. She is Lady Julia. Got a step. I only had the news an hour ago. You
will see it in the honours' list to-morrow. Quite a surprise. It doesn't make
the slightest difference to me, and I don't think Julia cares a lot, but there
it is. I am the Earl of Marsom and she is Lady Julia Pontifex. You are the
first to know, and you need not think that you are going to drink our healths
in cocktails," he added, with a grin. "That's one reason why I had you in here.
1822 Amontillado, young fellow."</p>
<p>Servants had entered noiselessly and sherry from a wonderful decanter flowed
into beautifully cut glasses. Sandbrook made his courteous little speech and
raised Julia's fingers to his lips.</p>
<p>"I'll still have to go out of the room after you," Marsom observed. "Still,
that doesn't matter. Nothing in this world is worth having except for what it
represents, and that is why I am glad of my earldom. I shall be proud of it, of
course, but I am prouder still of the Woolito Company and the work and
accomplishment it stands for. You have drunk our healths, Sandbrook. We will
have one to Woolito, then we had better go into the drawing-room and meet these
young people."</p>
<p>"I suppose this carousal to-night is in honour of the new dignity?"
Sandbrook asked.</p>
<p>"It just doesn't happen to be, because we didn't know," Julia explained.
"It's given for another of Dad's directors, a Mr. Bomford. He's becoming fond
of them, now there are so few left! Mr. Bomford's daughter is going to be
married in a few days and we are entertaining her and her young man."</p>
<p>"Bomford is a shrewd fellow," Marsom said. "You met him the night you came
in here, Sandbrook. He's not your type, of course. You won't expect that. It's
almost a family party, as you might say, looking upon Woolito, Limited as being
a family gathering ground. There's Alfred Honeyman and his wife, Mayden-Harte,
Mr. Moody, and Sidney Littleburn and his wife. Littleburn is our man of
figures. Probably would have been Chancellor of the Exchequer, if sheer cunning
would have got him there."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid he and I would never be friends," Sandbrook smiled. "I can't
even add up a column of figures."</p>
<p>"H'm," Marsom grunted. "Well, in that case, I am afraid you won't find much
to talk about with Honeyman."</p>
<p>"And what is Mr. Bomford's special line?" Sandbrook asked.</p>
<p>"He is our man of commerce," Marsom said. "He studies the markets in the Far
East and deals with our competitors. Shrewd fellow, too. We owe the Gleddowe
Mills to him. A magnificent piece of ingenuity that was."</p>
<p>"Gleddowe&mdash;Gleddowe," Sandbrook repeated. "The name seems
familiar."</p>
<p>"You've heard of their products, I dare say," Marsom observed. "They made
the nearest thing to Woolito that ever has been made. If we had not chipped in,
and Bomford hadn't been shrewd enough to buy them out, they would have been by
far our most dangerous competitors."</p>
<p>"It was not commercially that I heard of them," Sandbrook reflected. "Of
course, I know," he went on. "Young Jack Alleby&mdash;Sir Richard Alleby's
son&mdash;behaved jolly badly to the girl, when her father lost all his money,
and she committed suicide. It broke the old boy up altogether. He went to
pieces afterwards himself. Gleddowe&mdash;yes, that was the name of the
girl."</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence. The major-domo, who had entered the room
noiselessly, ventured upon a slight smile.</p>
<p>"The guests are arriving, your lordship," he announced, "and&mdash;" to
Julia&mdash;"your ladyship."</p>
<p>Julia laid her hand almost caressingly upon Sandbrook's coat sleeve.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't mind my feline habits," she said. "I'm quite sure I'm half
a cat and half one of the Southern races, and not at all British. I love
feeling things and people that I am fond of. There's that little jade image,
for instance," she remarked, pointing to it as they passed into the hall. "I
can take that up and pass my hands over it a dozen times. I like to hold on to
people. I am sometimes sorry I am not an East Ender to go arm-in-arm with my
young man everywhere. It seems so silly to march a yard apart from anyone you
are with, if it is someone you are really fond of."</p>
<p>"I hope that means you are getting fond of me," he observed.</p>
<p>He felt her fingers suddenly slip down his sleeve towards his hand and they
seemed to him feverishly hot.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you had better not hope anything of the sort," she half whispered.
"I have, like my father, I think, a little of the tiger in me. I feel I could
burn up and destroy anything I am fond of&mdash;if ever I got fond enough....
Of course, this is not the proper sort of conversation at all for these few
moments! You are going to have a dull dinner party. You are going to meet some
stupid people. You are going to be very agreeable, I'm sure, but you are going
to be very bored. But be thankful for one thing. I knew what was happening, and
I sent word to Dante&mdash;Dante superintends the butler and the
service&mdash;that dinner was to be served just as fast as he could get the
people to eat it! No lingering. They must be got rid of."</p>
<p>"Well, you are a very considerate hostess, at any rate," Sandbrook remarked,
with a grin. "How do you know I want to be got rid of?"</p>
<p>"You need not be," she confided. "The party for you and for me shall end
just when you please."</p>
<p>Sandbrook, after having devoted himself valiantly for some time to his
right-hand neighbour, Lady Honeyman, a plump, fair-haired woman, voluble and
easily satisfied with the ordinary formula of conversation, permitted himself
to turn with relief to his hostess. He had a curious fancy that in the
exquisitely softened light she resembled one of the velvety white orchids with
which the table was simply decorated.</p>
<p>"Well," she challenged, "what do you think of it, dear stranger?"</p>
<p>"Impressions?"</p>
<p>"Precisely. I will admit that you have not had much time to collect any, but
I did see you looking around when you unfolded your napkin."</p>
<p>"Here is an impression for you, then," he said. "I was thinking that the
only three things which make the difference in dinner parties, the only things
which make the atmosphere, are the servants, the table and the lighting."</p>
<p>"What about the guests?"</p>
<p>"Somehow or other, they don't seem to matter. They all have to talk about
the same way. They all have to dress in about the same fashion. They just fall
into their places and complete the picture&mdash;that's all. Of course, there
are always one or two who stand out. You yourself are unusual. Your father is
unusual. None other of us is remarkable in any way. We all conform to the type
of our sort, and it is amazing how a common form of conversation and a common
habitude of dress bring us close together."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't consider you in the least like Mr. Bomford or Sir Alfred
Honeyman or Mr. Mayden-Harte," she objected.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," he agreed. "And yet we are all four wearing white shirts with
three buttons and pearl studs, wing collars and ties of the same fashion. Our
coats were cut probably by the same or a similar tailor&mdash;and there we are.
And as for your womenkind. Well, after all, clothes make some difference but I
should think they all patronise the same kind of dressmaker. And as to
conversation, I have not heard a word about Woolito. Everyone is talking about
two plays in particular, whether we are really going to have an opera season,
what Augenier sketches are really like, and a few little trifles of that
sort."</p>
<p>Mr. Bomford, who was seated on Julia's other side, leaned forward. He was a
stiffly built, florid man with an immensely consequential air. He spoke with
great deliberation and he loved the words he spoke so much that he parted with
them regretfully.</p>
<p>"Did I hear you, Lord Sandbrook, mention the word 'Woolito'?"</p>
<p>"You did, indeed," the other assented.</p>
<p>"It is a source of great pleasure to myself, if you will permit me to say
so," Mr. Bomford continued, "and to my fellow directors, to know, Lord
Sandbrook, that you are joining the firm. You may have heard that I am one of
the oldest associates."</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook knows very little about any of you up till now," Julia
observed.</p>
<p>"He will find us out in time," Mr. Bomford went on. "The sooner, the better,
I trust. You have met my daughter, Lord Sandbrook, in whose honour this party
has been given?"</p>
<p>"I have had that pleasure," Sandbrook acquiesced.</p>
<p>"Also my wife, I trust?"</p>
<p>"I believe so."</p>
<p>"We shall be happy, in due course, to welcome you in Pomeroy Square. In the
meantime, I trust that you will not consider it a liberty if I send you
to-morrow a card to my daughter's wedding?"</p>
<p>"I shall receive it with much pleasure," Sandbrook said. "As to my
attendance, I fear I cannot promise. I am not showing up at anything in the
nature of a formal function at present."</p>
<p>"A marriage ceremony is an affair which stands by itself," Mr. Bomford
pronounced. "Your position as a business associate encourages me to hope that
you will see your way to be present. My wife and daughter would be greatly
gratified. I myself should be pleased. Let me take this opportunity, Lord
Sandbrook, of telling you that if you should desire intimate and comprehensive
information as to the workings and the nature of the business with which you
have become connected, you can obtain these with the utmost pleasure from me. A
few quiet evenings together at Pomeroy Square, or wherever you may prefer, will
be quite sufficient. I have lectured in various parts of England upon the
commodity we manufacture, and I have all the facts at my fingers' ends."</p>
<p>"You are very kind, Mr. Bomford."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom rose suddenly in his place.</p>
<p>"I beg you to drink the health of Miss Bomford and Mr. Mervyn Nealby," he
proposed, "and to join with me in wishing them happiness."</p>
<p>Everyone raised their glasses and everyone was relieved when the young
people contented themselves with a bow of thanks. Mr. Bomford showed signs of
rising to his feet. Julia pulled him down.</p>
<p>"Mr. Bomford," she said, "Father specially stipulated that there should be
no speeches of any sort."</p>
<p>"Not even a word to return thanks?" Mr. Bomford argued.</p>
<p>Julia saw a little roll of paper under his plate but she was merciless.</p>
<p>"Not one single word," she insisted, "unless you want to annoy Father."</p>
<p>To annoy Lord Marsom was the last thing Mr. Bomford wanted to do, so with a
stifled groan he resumed his place. Whilst he was surreptitiously returning the
manuscript to his pocket, Julia edged a little nearer to her neighbour.</p>
<p>"Don't be too terrified," she whispered. "He's the worst of the lot, by a
long way. The prospective bridegroom is quite a good-looking young man, isn't
he?"</p>
<p>"The girl is pretty too," he agreed. "They seem to be amusing themselves all
right."</p>
<p>"By fits and starts," Julia pointed out. "Curiously enough, I have been
watching them. I think the girl is a trifle hysterical."</p>
<p>"You may be right," Sandbrook acquiesced. "The young man has the air of one
committed to a desperate enterprise, and yet every now and then they seem to
cheer one another up most successfully. Marriage nowadays seems to have lost
either its fear or its charm," he went on meditatively. "Even the last time I
was in London, people used to be a bit self-conscious about it for a day or two
beforehand, and if you met them on their honeymoon, you were almost supposed
not to notice them. The other day I met a young couple I know quite well,
arm-in-arm the day before the ceremony, going to a cinema, and they begged me
to come and have lunch with them the day afterwards!"</p>
<p>"I don't think there is such a thing as self-consciousness left," Julia
sighed, "except amongst very sensitive people, like myself. If ever I am
married, no one will know it."</p>
<p>"You mean that the bells won't ring in Hanover Square?"</p>
<p>"Nor anywhere else. I should like to be married quite unexpectedly. It is
the one American institution I approve of. You can be proposed to at dinner and
married before supper. Whether it is marriage or not," she added coolly,
"that's what will happen to me some day.... I once met your aunt, Lord
Sandbrook."</p>
<p>"What, Aunt Agatha!" he exclaimed. "She was one of the naughtiest old ladies
in London."</p>
<p>"I liked her outlook and she was terribly witty," Julia reflected, with a
reminiscent smile. "I remember hearing her say that the only indecent thing
about matrimony was its prurient Victorianism."</p>
<p>Sandbrook turned back to his right-hand neighbour.</p>
<p>"Our hostess is shocking me with family anecdotes," he confided. "I have a
very wicked old aunt to whom all the improper things that are said in London
are attributed."</p>
<p>"Tell me this one," Lady Honeyman begged.</p>
<p>"I daren't," he acknowledged. "Besides, I don't really quite understand it.
Have you any family, Lady Honeyman?"</p>
<p>"None whatever, except my husband," she replied, "and he takes more looking
after than any child."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised," Sandbrook said. "He looks so amiable over there."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's amiable enough," his spouse confessed. "A very earnest man and a
very good one. He loves work and little else. Middle-aged business men are all
like that nowadays, I suppose. In the lower orders, the men so often take to
drink. With us, they seem to take to charitable deeds and work. The woman
suffers, anyway."</p>
<p>"I thought nowadays woman was completely emancipated," he plodded on.</p>
<p>"That depends upon what her looking-glass tells her," Lady Honeyman sighed.
"The only alternative is&mdash;I am letting you into secrets, mind, which don't
concern respectable middle-aged women like myself&mdash;plenty of money,
freedom to go to the south of France and a taste for gigolos."</p>
<p>"Most astonishingly modern London seems to have become since I was here
last," he observed.</p>
<p>"Sir Alfred," Julia drawled, "your wife is becoming improper. I am going to
take her away."</p>
<p>Sandbrook breathed a sigh of relief. It was over. He lit a cigarette and
moved down the table. A little man with a wisp of a moustache and a thin,
wizened face drew up his chair. His voice, when he spoke, was high-pitched,
precise but unpleasant.</p>
<p>"I arrived too late to be introduced," he said. "My name is Littleburn. I
look after the finances of the firm. That side of it won't trouble you much, I
think, Lord Sandbrook."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom rose to his feet&mdash;ponderous, non-apologetic, almost
abrupt.</p>
<p>"We are ordered into the lounge," he announced. "It's an informal evening,
though. Anyone who prefers a glass or two more port may stay."</p>
<p>There was not a soul there who had the courage to prefer a glass or two more
port. There was more than one longing look at the decanter, but they all
followed their host.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>At a retired table in a small restaurant in the purlieus of Soho on the
following evening, two young people&mdash;Marian Bomford, for whom the dinner
party in Park Lane had been given on the previous evening, and George Argels, a
strong, healthy-looking young man with frank eyes and pleasant face&mdash;sat
almost ignoring the two-shilling <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> dinner which, although
naturally it could not compare with the Marsom banquet, was really good enough
to deserve a better fate. It was not the first meal by many they had shared
under similar conditions, but this time there was excitement in the air.
Something important to discuss, a rift at last in the clouds which had seemed
impenetrable.</p>
<p>"You see," Argels finally pointed out, at the conclusion of a long argument,
"your father will work himself up into such a state about the whole affair that
he will really be relieved when he knows the truth."</p>
<p>The girl sighed.</p>
<p>"Of course, it will work out all right in the end," she admitted, "but you
can't imagine how embarrassing it is even to pretend to be engaged to some
other man. The dinner party last night at Lord Marsom's was awful. People kept
on congratulating us and I didn't know what to say. Mr. Nealby was all
right&mdash;I think he must have done a little amateur acting in his
day!&mdash;but I felt a perfect ninny."</p>
<p>"I am sure you came out of it beautifully, dear," her companion assured her,
patting her hand.</p>
<p>"I felt stupid enough," she confessed. "I'm sure everyone put me down as
being a nice, shy sort of girl! Then, afterwards in the lounge, to make things
worse, I heard Mother confiding to Lady Honeyman that she was especially
delighted the way things had turned out, because there had been a young man in
the background, of whom she had had suspicions, who was not at all desirable.
I'm sure she meant you, George."</p>
<p>Her companion chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'm certain she did," he agreed.</p>
<p>"It gets more and more embarrassing," she went on. "These last few evenings
they have left us together more than ever. Supposing he tries to play the
engaged young man in earnest!"</p>
<p>"Mervyn is too good a fellow for that," George Argels declared. "We were at
school together, so I know all about him. Of course, I'm not liking it, but I
know I can trust you both. And, Marian dear&mdash;think of it&mdash;it seems to
me to be the only way. I get a thousand pounds! Quite enough for the start I
want in Canada. Mervyn gets the same, which I should think would just about pay
for his holiday in London."</p>
<p>For a time they yielded to the mild importunities of their waiter and
devoted themselves to the dinner. Marian, however, grew more and more
thoughtful.</p>
<p>"George dear," she said presently, "what I cannot help asking myself,
whenever I think about this extraordinary offer is,&mdash;what does the person
gain who is giving a couple of thousand pounds away in such a ridiculous
manner?"</p>
<p>"Even Mervyn doesn't know that," the young man confessed, "and I'm not going
to bother my head about it. I should think it's someone your father's run up
against somehow or other. He is by way of being a little difficult now and
then, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"He certainly is," Marian agreed drily.</p>
<p>"Here's Mervyn," her companion announced, as a tall young man entered the
restaurant and glanced around. "Looks rather a toff, doesn't he, for a place
like this?"</p>
<p>The very well-turned-out young man of the night before waved his hand and
approached their table. He greeted them both cheerily and accepted a chair.</p>
<p>"No, I won't have anything, thanks," he replied, in answer to Argels'
invitation. "I just looked in to ask my 'fianc&eacute;e' how she thought we got
through last night?"</p>
<p>Marian laughed a little nervously.</p>
<p>"I suppose it was all right," she murmured, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"I thought you went through it splendidly," the newcomer declared. "I must
confess, however, that the nearer we get to business, the less I understand
this stunt. All that I can see clearly about it is that a thousand quid is
going to do me a bit of good!"</p>
<p>"And me," Argels echoed.</p>
<p>The newcomer rose to his feet and picked up his silk hat from the chair on
which he had deposited it. He smiled good-humouredly at the girl.</p>
<p>"At any rate, Miss Bomford," he observed, "you will have to confess that I
am one of the best-behaved fianc&eacute;s in the world. What do you say to
borrowing the car for our last afternoon to-morrow? George here can drive it
out into the country and then I will have a quiet smoke somewhere, while he
takes my job over? How does that go?"</p>
<p>"It sounds all right to me," Argels declared fervently.</p>
<p>"It doesn't sound badly to me," Marian confessed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. John Henry Bomford of Pomeroy Square, a man of wealth and substance
since he had become a director of Woolito, Limited, was a great personage these
days. He was also, even when there was nothing particular to talk about, a
great talker. The domestic event which had taken him entirely by surprise was
fuel for his conceit and adequate material for his tongue. His daughter, the
daughter of Mr. John Henry Bomford, was engaged to be married. It appeared that
she was marrying, if not into the peerage itself, into the outskirts of it. The
story of the first meeting of the young people and their subsequent engagement
seemed, somehow or other, to have been entirely due to the benevolent efforts
of Mr. Bomford, mildly assisted by the Deity in the background. What a
fortunate daughter! What a kindly and at the same time Machiavellian father!
His bumptiousness seemed to increase hour by hour, from the evening of Lord
Marsom's dinner party to the date appointed for the solemnization of his
daughter's marriage. In his City club and in the offices of Woolito, Limited,
he became such a nuisance that his associates began to avoid him. His
discourses were always in the same key.</p>
<p>"My son-in-law that is to be, you know. Young Nealby, nephew of Sir George
Nealby&mdash;in America just now, unfortunately. Important diplomatic mission.
Fine fellow, young Nealby. You're coming to the wedding? That's right. St.
James's, Hamilton Square, mind. Two-thirty at the church and Claridge's Hotel
afterwards. You'll find everything done all right there. I always promised the
girls when they made their choice they should have a proper send-off."</p>
<p>"Can't someone muzzle old Bomford?" they groaned at the club.</p>
<p>"The old man is getting worse," they muttered at the offices. "He was
wondering yesterday whether we couldn't close for the day so that everyone
could go to his wretched daughter's wedding."</p>
<p>"Anyone would think it was Father who was getting married," Marian confided
to her mother, in a final fit of irritation. "He talks about Mervyn and the
church and our trip and the wedding reception and everything as though I were
getting married for his special glorification. He has had at least four pairs
of trousers sent home, each lighter than the last, before he was satisfied, and
now he has decided to change his tie and to wear a white flower, after
all."</p>
<p>"You must make allowances for your father, my dear," the poor, shadowy lady
who called herself Mrs. Bomford sighed. "He has been like this all his life.
People call him bumptious and conceited, and so I suppose he is, but anyhow, he
has worked hard. Remember, you were born in a four-roomed cottage, and look
where you are now."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you get like Father," the girl cried. "To hear him talk, anyone
would think that he had invented Mervyn, that he had found him and trained him
and educated him purposely to be his son-in-law! The fact that I met Mervyn
long before he ever heard his name never seems to have occurred to him."</p>
<p>"Well, you'll be getting away altogether before long," her mother reminded
her, with a wistful sigh.</p>
<p>"Good job too," was Marian's undutiful comment. "I don't know what we shall
do with Father at the church. He won't be content to stand anywhere but in the
front place.</p>
<p>"My dear," her mother exclaimed, "he will wear himself out before it's all
over. What do you think he did yesterday? He made me send a card of invitation
to Lord Sandbrook, that nice young man we met at the Marsom's. Why, we scarcely
know him!"</p>
<p>"He's a friend of Julia Pontifex's," the girl remarked absently.</p>
<p>"Well, I hope he doesn't come," her mother sighed. "Your father will be
running about, introducing him to everybody all the time, and I know most of
the people will be laughing at us."</p>
<p>"I don't care," the girl replied, with a twinkle in her eyes. "And if I were
you, Mother, I shouldn't worry about the reception."</p>
<p>Mr. John Henry Bomford was one of the practical men in the great firm of
Woolito, Limited. Just as Sir Sigismund Lunt was, or had been, the engineer, he
was the out-and-out man of business. He was a man of altogether different type
to his fellow workers, however. He was short, stout and red-cheeked, but he
lacked the air of <i>bonhomie</i> which his figure and complexion demanded. He
walked with a swagger, he talked with a swagger, he drew every breath of life
with a swagger. He was proud of himself&mdash;John Henry Bomford. He was proud
in a lesser degree of his daughters. He was even proud, inasmuch as she
belonged to him and wore his jewellery, of his faded shadow of a wife. He had
been a bully from the moment his muscles had hardened, a snob from the day he
donned his first black coat and his bank account had commenced to swell. His
immediate circle of employees detested him, and the group of mills in
Nottinghamshire which he had first broken and then
reorganised&mdash;reorganised was the word they used&mdash;said murderous
things about him behind his back. John Henry Bomford had not the slightest
regard for any of these things. He had never aimed at or craved popularity from
the human point of view. What he wanted was admiration and recognition, for
people to turn around in the street and remark that the well-dressed man with
the commanding bearing was John Henry Bomford, of Woolito's&mdash;a very
important person in the City. With it all he was not actually a fool. He knew
very well that this young man whom his daughter had introduced to the household
was of a different class to the one from which he had sprung. He pretended not
to appreciate the fact, but it made him lenient in his enquiries, credulous as
to his would-be son-in-law's statements regarding his position and prospects in
Canada. It was quite sufficient for him that he had a connection as
aristocratic in appearance and bearing as the uncle whom he had brought to see
them; that during his stay in London he had played golf at Ranelagh; and that
he could talk about titled people with the ease of one accustomed to their
society. The young man, too, had been surprisingly moderate in his money
demands. Nothing at all until after the wedding, he had insisted. No
settlements. After the honeymoon, they would have a meeting and Mr. Bomford
could see what sum he cared to allow his daughter before her departure for
Canada. All very satisfactory! Probably the young man was only too anxious to
get such a father-in-law.</p>
<p>The climax of Mr. Bomford's rejoicing came perhaps on the day when his
prospective son-in-law had called to lunch with him in the City and they had
come face to face with Sandbrook who, finding himself in the neighbourhood, had
looked in to call on Lord Marsom. The two young men had exchanged the usual
greetings.</p>
<p>"Hello, it's Nealby, isn't it?" Sandbrook had said, nodding pleasantly.
"What are you doing in these parts?"</p>
<p>"Come to lunch with my father-in-law that-is-to-be, Mr. Bomford," was the
easy reply.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" Sandbrook exclaimed. "Of course. I had forgotten for the moment
that it was you who are marrying Bomford's daughter. Congratulations!"</p>
<p>Sandbrook had passed on with a few more civil words, but the
meeting&mdash;unimportant though it had seemed&mdash;had put the cap on Mr.
Bomford's satisfaction. It gave him even more pleasure than the great dinner
party in Park Lane. It was a wonderful affair, this which he had arranged. It
was a great triumph for the family. The family was Mr. John Henry Bomford.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Mother," the prospective bride implored, a few days before the ceremony,
"do you think you could stop Father talking about Mervyn's pal, Lord Sandbrook?
I'm sure Mervyn will hate it if he ever gets to know. He told me distinctly
that he had only met Lord Sandbrook once or twice."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bomford shook her head. There was hopelessness in the gesture.</p>
<p>"No one who was ever born, my dear," she confided, "could stop your father
from talking about anything he wanted to. Especially, if it was anything which
he thought reflected a little glory upon himself. I gave up years ago. You're
lucky to be getting away from it!"</p>
<p>"I sometimes think," the girl meditated, "it sounds an inhuman thing to say,
but I mean it&mdash;that a severe illness would do Father good. He has too much
vitality."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Marian looked on her wedding day as a girl should look&mdash;better than
ever before in her life; although, as one of the bridesmaids, probably with a
touch of envy, remarked under her breath, that was not saying much. Mr.
Bomford, on the other hand, had been a trouble to everyone all the morning.
First, his patent-leather shoes were too tight and drew his feet. Then he
crumpled the chosen cravat, in his efforts to tie it. Then, in the heat and
excitement, his collar had wilted. However, in due course, with the help of
everyone, he was satisfied and strutted downstairs to where his daughter was
waiting. She looked up, expecting at least one glance of parental admiration,
but failed to obtain it. Mr. Bomford had remembered a mirror in the hall, and
his fingers were playing with his tie.</p>
<p>"All the other carriages have gone, Father," the bride ventured to remind
him.</p>
<p>He extended his arm.</p>
<p>"Come with me," he invited.</p>
<p>The bells were chiming their loudest as they turned the corner of the square
and pulled up between two long rows of sight-seers. Any passer-by who had
counted upon getting a glimpse of the bride, however, was disappointed, for Mr.
Bomford, leaning forward, had completely monopolised the interior of the
carriage.</p>
<p>"Quite a good many people," he said complacently, as he alighted. "Now then,
my dear, don't lean too heavily on me. I mustn't have my coat crushed. This
way. We follow the bridesmaids and don't forget to walk slowly."</p>
<p>They passed up the stone steps. Rather to their surprise, the bridesmaids
were still in the outside porch. The verger hurried out to meet them with a
look of concern upon his face.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Bomford demanded abruptly. "Why isn't everyone in
his place? Just because I couldn't get down here myself, I suppose everything
is in confusion."</p>
<p>"The trouble is the bridegroom, sir," the verger confided.</p>
<p>"What about the bridegroom?"</p>
<p>"Well, he hasn't arrived, sir. Neither has the best man."</p>
<p>Mr. Bomford was for a moment speechless.</p>
<p>"Not arrived," he spluttered. "Disgraceful!"</p>
<p>There was an uneasy murmur of voices from the back of the church, where Mr.
Bomford's angry outpourings were plainly to be heard.</p>
<p>"What are we to do?" the bride asked the verger.</p>
<p>"His car has probably met with some mishap," the man said soothingly. "If
you will turn in a little to the left, there is a sheltered corner. It would be
better for you to wait there, out of sight."</p>
<p>"Have the guests all arrived?" Mr. Bomford asked.</p>
<p>"The church is full, sir."</p>
<p>"Is Lord Sandbrook here, do you know?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't say, sir."</p>
<p>"Disgraceful of Mervyn," Mr. Bomford muttered. "I hate waiting in these
tight shoes. I told Emma that if I had to wait about in them, my feet would
suffer. I shall be in misery throughout the whole ceremony. Perfectly
disgraceful of him! Here's a car. Is this he?"</p>
<p>The car, however, only contained more guests, who passed on into the church.
The bells paused for a moment or two and then went on. The minutes passed.
Finally the clergyman, looking very much upset, came out to consult.</p>
<p>"Where does the bridegroom live?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"He has been staying in rooms in Clarges Street, Number Thirteen," Marian
answered.</p>
<p>"He was to have stayed with his old friend, Lord&mdash;" Mr. Bomford
began.</p>
<p>"I should suggest that you send a messenger in a car there at once," the
vicar interrupted kindly. "I am afraid that unless he comes very quickly, it
will be too late. Probably, though, Mr. Nealby is already on his way. The
traffic in the streets at this hour is terrible."</p>
<p>The messenger was sent, but without result. The minutes passed and there
were no signs of the arrival of anyone, except one or two belated guests. Mr.
Bomford's vociferations were such that the verger had to take him by the arm
and lead him into a retired corner. Marian herself was by far the most composed
of the little company. At five minutes to the appointed hour the clergyman
reappeared.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry," he announced regretfully, "but it would be too late now to
perform the ceremony. It will have to be abandoned for to-day."</p>
<p>Presently whispers went around the church and the rumour of something wrong
spread. The guests came streaming out. The bride and bridesmaids had already
gone. Mr. Bomford, with a face redder than any turkey-cock, and a shower of
words falling from his lips which would have rendered him liable to arrest at
any moment, was on his way to Claridge's to countermand the arrangements for
the reception. Upon his return to Hyde Park Square, his wife, without any
comment, handed him a letter.</p>
<p>"What's this? What's this?" he exclaimed. "Can't read it&mdash;I won't read
anything."</p>
<p>"It's from Marian," his wife told him.</p>
<p>"What's Marian got to write about?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Better read it and see."</p>
<p>Mr. Bomford tore open the envelope and read.</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAR FATHER,<br>
<br>
I cannot face any of my friends after this horrible morning. I have done what I
have been wanting to do for some time. I have run away with George Argels, your
chauffeur.<br>
<br>
"You will be terribly angry, of course, but you ought not to mind so much. His
family is quite as good as ours and he has a little money. Anyhow, I care for
him and I know I shall be happy. I'm afraid you will be very angry but there is
nothing you can do about it. We are on our way to Canada. Mother will know
where to write.<br>
<br>
Your affectionate daughter,<br>
<br>
MARIAN."</blockquote>
<p>The letter fluttered from Mr. Bomford's fingers and he sank into a chair.
For the first time in his life words failed him.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frances Moore found Sandbrook that afternoon writing letters in the library
of his house in Hill Street. She waited until the door was closed before she
spoke.</p>
<p>"You are not going to the wedding reception?" she asked, looking at his
tweed suit.</p>
<p>"Not I," he answered. "They sent me an invitation, but I only know young
Nealby to nod to, and as for Bomford&mdash;well, although he is a fellow
director of your beloved Woolito&mdash;I must confess that I can't stand
him."</p>
<p>"You know what happened?"</p>
<p>"Not an idea," he replied. "To judge from your expression, something pretty
tragic."</p>
<p>"The bridegroom never turned up!"</p>
<p>"What, never turned up at the church?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Everyone was there, including the bride. They waited until the last minute,
but neither he nor his best man put in an appearance."</p>
<p>"Heavens!" Sandbrook exclaimed. "What was the explanation?"</p>
<p>"There wasn't any. He left for the Continent by the nine o'clock train
without sending even a message."</p>
<p>"Had there been a quarrel?"</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort."</p>
<p>"Young swine!" Sandbrook ejaculated.</p>
<p>Frances seemed altogether unduly moved. She was standing quite still, she
was very pale, and there had been a note almost of pain in the few words she
had spoken. Sandbrook, suddenly realising her condition, led her to an easy
chair and ensconced her there comfortably.</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Moore," he remonstrated, "you mustn't take other people's
troubles so much to heart! You look quite upset."</p>
<p>"I think it's terrible," she declared. "First of all, there was the
destruction of the Lunt machine, then the Somerville tragedy, and now about the
most humiliating and horrible thing that could happen to the most conceited and
opinionated man the world ever knew&mdash;to say nothing of his poor daughter!
I am not sympathising with him particularly, but I think no man ever suffered
before as he did. They say that he smashed all the furniture in the room in
which he locked himself up, and now that he's a little quieter, he's sobbing
like a child and swearing that he will never go out again."</p>
<p>"He has been rather above himself lately, hasn't he?" Sandbrook
observed.</p>
<p>"I call it a perfectly dastardly affair," Frances Moore insisted.</p>
<p>"I entirely agree with you," he admitted. "There may be some explanation to
come later, though."</p>
<p>"I hope to heavens Scotland Yard or somebody will find out who is behind all
this devilish business," she went on furiously. "Think! There was the Tottenham
fire, the Somerville tragedy and this. All the time it is the directors of the
Woolito Company who suffer."</p>
<p>"There doesn't seem very much connection between the burning of the
Tottenham sheds and the failure of young Nealby to turn up at the church
to-day," he ventured to point out.</p>
<p>"You haven't heard about the wedding present, I suppose?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Frances," he expostulated, "how should I? I have never been
near Bomford's house and I hadn't the faintest intention of going to the
reception. How should I know anything about the present? I only got the
invitation myself at the last moment, so I didn't think it was necessary to
send one."</p>
<p>"Well, listen," she insisted. "Amongst them was a small engraved silver box;
inside it the Egyptian finger of fate and a card&mdash;just like the
others&mdash;with something written upon it about an Elizabeth Gleddowes, who
had committed suicide."</p>
<p>"Elizabeth Gleddowes!" Sandbrook repeated, with a puzzled frown. "Now, who
on earth was she? Come in&mdash;Come in!" he added impatiently.</p>
<p>The door was thrown open. Lord Marsom, beautifully dressed in the costume of
a wedding guest, made turbulent appearance. He had evidently pushed the butler
out of the way and he showed signs of considerable mental disturbance.
Sandbrook rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Saw one of my cars outside, so I looked in to see who it was," Marsom
explained. "What's brought you here, Miss Moore?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," she answered composedly. "I simply came in to bring Lord
Sandbrook the news of the wedding."</p>
<p>Marsom's face was still like a thundercloud. He made no comment,
however.</p>
<p>"Have you heard the latest?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"What about?" Sandbrook enquired.</p>
<p>"The Bomford affair."</p>
<p>"Miss Moore has just told me that the bridegroom never turned up," Sandbrook
replied.</p>
<p>"There's a worse development than that," Marsom announced. "Do you know
what's happened to the bride?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook shook his head.</p>
<p>"Poor girl," he murmured. "Very much upset, I expect."</p>
<p>"She's gone off with a chauffeur," Marsom exploded. "Bolted with him during
the afternoon, when everything was in confusion. Left a note saying she had
always cared for him more than anyone else, and she couldn't stand facing her
friends after this morning. They say that Bomford has locked himself in his
room and is smashing the furniture to pieces!"</p>
<p>"Sensible girl!" Miss Frances Moore exclaimed, with a distinctly relieved
expression.</p>
<p>"Poor old Bomford," Sandbrook commiserated.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Julia Pontifex had advanced one step farther in the accomplishment of her
heart's desire. She was seated at the most desirable corner table of a famous
and dignified restaurant, alone with Sandbrook. Conversation on a somewhat
bantering note, perhaps, was still proceeding in pleasant and familiar fashion.
A great many other diners in the room had taken note of her presence there and
nearly all the women had looked twice at her gown. The famous orchestra was
playing very beautiful music, but soon they would be succeeded by the most
successful dance band in Europe. If she had failed as yet to break through a
certain reserve in her companion which she, a very sensitive person, had always
appreciated, she had at least kept him amused, even if she had once or twice
shocked him.... A tall and very dignified-looking old gentleman, with the
collar of Palmerston and the side whiskers of Pitt, paused for a moment at
their table. He bowed very slightly but courteously to Julia before he
addressed Sandbrook.</p>
<p>"My dear Martin," he said, "I had no idea that this was one of your
haunts."</p>
<p>Sandbrook had risen promptly to his feet.</p>
<p>"It isn't, sir," he confessed. "I am afraid, as a rule, I prefer something a
little more frivolous."</p>
<p>"Will you not present me to your companion?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook hastened to obey.</p>
<p>"Lady Julia," he said, "this is my uncle, the Duke of Amersham. Lady Julia
Pontifex."</p>
<p>The Duke was a little puzzled, for he knew his peerage by heart, but he was
too polite to show it.</p>
<p>"I must apologize for breaking in upon your t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,"
he said to Julia, "but we so seldom see my nephew. To tell you the truth, I was
beginning to wonder whether he was not off again on one of his mad
expeditions."</p>
<p>"Nothing madder than a fortnight's salmon fishing in prospect," Sandbrook
declared. "Aunt and all the family well, I hope, sir?"</p>
<p>The Duke inclined his head.</p>
<p>"They are down in Warwickshire for a few days," he confided. "My wife," he
went on, turning to Julia, "is a great gardener. She must see her bulbs the
moment they are out of the ground. You must bring Lady Julia down to see them
some day, Martin, and we will give you lunch. With the type of car in which my
nephew delights, we are scarcely more than two hours away from town."</p>
<p>"It would be very pleasant," Julia murmured gratefully.</p>
<p>Julia that night, at any rate, did not lack distinction. She was pale
because she was anxious, and she had been too clever to try and interfere with
a pallor which was by no means unbecoming. Her lips were naturally scarlet. Her
dark hair, parted in the middle and allowed to droop at the sides, looked
perfectly natural, although it had demanded the attention of the most famous
coiffeur in London for over an hour. The Duke was interested.</p>
<p>"I am developing infirmities," he observed, "in these, my elderly days. I
did not quite catch your second name, Lady Julia."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it would be unfamiliar," she told him. "You see, my father only
received his title last week. Before then, he was known as Baron Marsom."</p>
<p>If there was any change in the Duke's expression, it was simply one of faint
regret. His smile was as pleasant and courteous as ever, as he took his
leave.</p>
<p>"It was stupid of me not to remember," he said. "Of course, I remember
reading about it, and that Pontifex was your family name. Well, don't forget
that little expedition into Warwickshire, Lady Julia. The Duchess will, I am
sure, be delighted to welcome you."</p>
<p>He passed down the room with a farewell nod to his nephew.</p>
<p>"What a delightful old gentleman," Julia exclaimed.</p>
<p>"He is one of the old school, all right," Sandbrook acquiesced.</p>
<p>Lady Julia watched his disappearing figure as her companion resumed his
seat.</p>
<p>"Is it my fancy," she asked, "or didn't I hear that he disapproved of your
father taking a place upon the Woolito board?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook nodded.</p>
<p>"He has old-fashioned ideas," he apologised. "He doesn't think that a
nobleman should stoop to making money. Must give him a pretty good shock to
stroll round Mayfair nowadays, especially if one took the trouble to tell him
who was at the back of some of those small hat shops and dressmakers', and even
coiffeurs', establishments. Prejudice dies hard with the living, I suppose. The
next generation will have got more used to the new order of things."</p>
<p>"Does he know that you have become a director of Woolito's?" Julia
asked.</p>
<p>"If he does, he has not said anything to me about it," Sandbrook replied, a
little evasively.</p>
<p>"Why have you?" she persisted.</p>
<p>"Well, why should I not? It is one of the world's most famous trading
concerns, I suppose. It gives one a fair amount of pocket money and the
directors&mdash;are all very interesting men. There's one of them seated over
there. He has been trying to catch your eye for the last ten minutes. Mr.
Sidney Littleburn, I think he is."</p>
<p>She glanced across in the direction indicated. Mr. Sidney Littleburn was not
a person of distinguished appearance and he seemed a little out of place in his
grandiose surroundings. His wife's toilette, which was assertive, savoured more
of Oxford Street than Mayfair. Their table was one of the least desirable in
the room. They seemed somewhat neglected in the matter of service. Julia
laughed softly.</p>
<p>"I should think that horrible Somerville affair would have pretty well
sickened you of Dad's chosen business associates," she remarked.
"Confess&mdash;you would not care to make a third in that <i>gal&egrave;re</i>,
would you?"</p>
<p>He ignored the obvious significance of the question and exchanged a
moderately civil nod with Littleburn, who had just succeeded in catching his
eye.</p>
<p>"I don't know that I have heard much about Littleburn," he said
thoughtfully. "He is the man, I think, who went down to superintend the
finances of some of those Nottinghamshire Mills. Your father told me he was a
most astute financier."</p>
<p>"He may be," Julia agreed nonchalantly. "Qualities of that sort do not
appeal to me. I would really rather you had nothing whatever to do with
business. I like everyone I have any interest in to be as far away from my own
life and environment as possible."</p>
<p>"Finance makes either giants or pigmies of men," he propounded. "Now, I must
do your father the credit to say that it has made a giant of him. I do not know
whether I like or dislike your father, Lady Julia, but I admire him."</p>
<p>"Well, that's something," she replied. "I wish you admired me."</p>
<p>"I could think of a more suitable word," he remarked, smiling at her in the
way she found so tantalising.</p>
<p>"What would the word be?"</p>
<p>"<i>Touch&eacute;</i>," he admitted. "You are too rapier-like, Lady Julia. I can
only say that I admire you too, but in a different fashion."</p>
<p>"I wish you admired me in the right way," she sighed. "I am really not so
bad.... Do you know that yesterday was my birthday?"</p>
<p>"Then I think it was very unkind of you," he said, "not to have told
me."</p>
<p>"I will make amends," she promised. "I will give you a chance to give me a
birthday present."</p>
<p>"Very much at your disposition," he murmured.</p>
<p>"Drive me," she invited, "a little way down into the country&mdash;not
to-morrow; I have a whole host of stupid engagements&mdash;Thursday. I can
sweep the page for Thursday."</p>
<p>"There being no directors' meeting," he said, smiling, "I am free. At what
hour shall I call for you?"</p>
<p>"At ten o'clock."</p>
<p>"And about what hour shall we be likely to return?"</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not at all," she said. "I would not make any arrangements for
returning, if I were you."</p>
<p>"I had a dinner party," he ventured.</p>
<p>"Cancel it," she ordered, with a touch of her father's brusqueness. "You are
quoted in all the papers as being a famous explorer. I am going to take you on
a voyage of exploration, only, you see, I know what we are going to find. I am
going to take you into a new country, where new habits and new customs prevail.
You will not be afraid to trust yourself with me?"</p>
<p>His momentary hesitation was not without its significance. As a matter of
fact, he was a little afraid. There were no signs of it, however, in his tone
or manner.</p>
<p>"I will draw," he promised her, "upon all my reserves of courage."</p>
<p>"The loan of you for the day is my birthday present."</p>
<p>"A very poor one, I fear," he laughed. "Wet or fine?"</p>
<p>"Wet or fine," she insisted firmly. "If it is fine, you can drive me down in
your two-seater, if you like. If it is wet, we will take one of Father's new
atrocities. Armchairs and bijou bars and that sort of thing."</p>
<p>"May heaven grant that it be fine!" he prayed fervently.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>An early spring day came to London and, notwithstanding her unuttered,
almost unacknowledged regrets, Julia was whirled away into the country in
Sandbrook's somewhat exposed but exceedingly comfortable two-seater. Following
her directions&mdash;he was not permitted a map&mdash;they drove almost due
southwards, far out of the region of soot and smoke, to where the tender green
grasses lay like an emerald carpet upon the Downs, and the tang of the sea
winds was soft and sweetened by the April sunshine. A turn to the right brought
them into the country of fir plantations and woods of waxen-budded beeches,
copses flushed with bluebells, primroses starring the sheltered ditches, and
the most fragrant violets in the world peeping timidly out of the
hawthorn-guarded hedgerows. In the by-way villages, stiff rows of crocuses lent
splashes of colour to the cottage gardens, and more ambitious beds of hyacinths
adorned the vicarage grounds. Everywhere was the twitter of birds, the
rollicking puffs of pollen-carrying wind, from which the sting had departed,
blue skies, the slow uplifting of winter's hand from the yearning land. They
both of them decided that England was a very beautiful country.</p>
<p>"I suppose you know that we are nearing the New Forest?" he ventured.</p>
<p>"We are almost at our journey's end," she assured him lazily.</p>
<p>He left the wheel to her while he lit a cigarette. There had been very
little conversation on the way down. The exigencies of the traffic had kept him
silent and later on something in the atmosphere, which he was swift to sense,
warned him of his companion's curiously nervous, almost neurotic, frame of
mind. She too, however, seemed to be revelling in the silence. She lay back
very close to his side, with the air of one utterly and languorously content.
She had withdrawn her gloves and her slender white fingers, entirely ringless,
once or twice touched almost caressingly his share of the rug which covered
them.</p>
<p>"This is just such a day as I prayed I might have for my birthday gift," she
murmured once. "Away from London here, it all seems so full of life&mdash;birds
and flowers and winds and everything. One gets a little crushed in a city."</p>
<p>"And yet you blame me for my journeyings," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"It isn't quite the same thing," she objected. "When you get to the top of
this next hill, do you mind stopping for a moment?"</p>
<p>He obeyed. It was certainly a very beautiful spot in which to linger. The
road was almost like an avenue passing through a great forest&mdash;a curling
ribbon of white, visible here and there for miles in front of them. On either
side, free of any hedge or ditch, stretched the gorse-dotted common, the orange
buds already showing a dim flush of colour. She showed him a thin strip of the
sea plainly visible now below them to the south.</p>
<p>"What a lovely spot," he murmured, half to himself.</p>
<p>She pointed to a cleft in the hills to the right. By leaning slightly
forward, he caught a flash of rhododendron bushes and a vision of thatched
gables.</p>
<p>"That," she told him, "is our destination."</p>
<p>"Heavens!" he murmured. "Are we going to pay a call?"</p>
<p>"Not a very alarming one," she assured him. "You have driven like a hero for
three hours. Doesn't the idea of an ap&eacute;ritif or luncheon begin to
suggest itself?"</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it," he admitted, "there is something curiously
inviting in the thought. Is that an hotel?"</p>
<p>"Drive up to it," she enjoined, "and you will see."</p>
<p>He obeyed. Soon they turned off the main road into a narrow lane and arrived
in front of some old iron gates. The lodge keeper threw them open with a
respectful salute.</p>
<p>"Not an hotel," he remarked, a touch of disappointment in his tone. "Are we
booked for a visit?"</p>
<p>"Wait," she begged him.</p>
<p>They threaded their way along an avenue of chestnut trees, already faintly
pink and white, and bordered by clumps of rhododendrons on either side. In the
farther background was a stretch of meadowland, leading to an open common. As
they turned the last bend, and the house which they were approaching came into
sight, Sandbrook felt himself unable to refrain from a little exclamation of
admiration. The house itself was of no particular period, perhaps. It had
started Tudor, been cunningly restored, and preserved still its air of
antiquity. The grass patches in front were aflower with crocuses. There was a
great hyacinth bed in the middle of the final sweep.</p>
<p>"Whom are we going to visit?" he asked curiously, as he brought the car to a
standstill.</p>
<p>"Does it matter?" she enquired.</p>
<p>"I was wondering whether those cocktails were likely to materialise," he
confessed greedily.</p>
<p>"Then you need wonder no longer," she assured him. "I shall mix them
myself."</p>
<p>The front door stood open. A grey-haired man-servant bowed his welcome. A
younger subordinate hurried to the car and relieved them of their rugs. Julia
shook out her skirts and smiled at her companion. For a moment or two she
seemed to have lost her assurance. There was something a little diffident,
something curiously girlish, about her expression. As she laid her fingers upon
his shoulder, her eyes were anxiously fixed upon his.</p>
<p>"You hate mystery, don't you?" she said. "There's no mystery about this
little place. It was my father's birthday present to me. He thought I might
like to have a secret pleasure house where I could entertain my real friends in
absolute solitude."</p>
<p>"A marvellous idea," he murmured.</p>
<p>The butler took a step forward and ventured upon a smile.</p>
<p>"The household wish me to offer their congratulations, your ladyship," he
said.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Dobson," she answered. "You got all the instructions from Park
Lane, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Everything is prepared as your ladyship desired," the man replied. "Perhaps
the gentleman would like to wash before luncheon?"</p>
<p>"In a moment," Julia interposed. "First of all, we want a cocktail, Dobson;
then I shall show Lord Sandbrook over the cottage myself."</p>
<p>The man led the way to a charming room upon the ground floor, a room in
which the leaded windowpanes and most of the old panelling still remained. A
number of bottles, beautifully shaped glasses and silver shakers were set out
in inviting fashion.</p>
<p>"I suppose I ought to have had a bar here," Julia remarked, drawing off her
gloves and making a selection of the bottles. "Somehow, though, I didn't fancy
it went with the room. That will do, Dobson. Have luncheon at half-past one. I
will ring if we want anything."</p>
<p>The man, with a quiet bow, departed. For some reason or other, Julia seemed
to have become nervous. She mixed cocktails, however, wonderful foaming
cocktails, and handed Sandbrook his glass.</p>
<p>"We must drink to the house," he proposed.</p>
<p>"Like the Norwegians," she added, smiling at him. "To the house and the
happiness it may bring."</p>
<p>They emptied their two glasses and afterwards Sandbrook was turned loose in
a small but perfect masculine suite, with bathroom and shower bath, a complete
set of such toilet appurtenances as a man can reasonably borrow, wardrobes
filled with tennis and golf clothes and even a dinner suit, shoes and cravats
all perfectly new. The sitting-room, with its deep easy chairs, contained a
small library of men's books. Some rare sporting prints hung upon the walls.
There were boxes of cigars and cigarettes upon the mantelpiece and a hospitably
opened cellarette in one corner. Whilst he was still exploring, he heard
Julia's voice outside.</p>
<p>"Can I come in?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>She laughed a little self-consciously and he noticed with a start that she
had entered through a door which evidently communicated with another suite of
apartments. She had changed her leather coat and motoring outfit for a house
frock of some softer material, loose fitting, but with a skirt which did
nothing to hide that lissome, graceful walk of hers which reminded him always
of the crowded bazaars of some far Eastern city.</p>
<p>"Well," she asked, "have you looked around? This is my principal bachelor
guest room. Is there anything a man might be likely to need which is not
here?"</p>
<p>"Very little, I should think," he assured her. "You seem to have provided
even for the poor man who comes without luggage."</p>
<p>"There are so many surprise parties nowadays," she reminded him
apologetically. "You are the first man who has crossed the threshold, so I
wanted to know whether anything was forgotten. Come and see my rooms," she
invited. "Luncheon will be ready in ten minutes."</p>
<p>He followed her, with a little thrill of surprise, through the communicating
door by which she had entered, into a small suite which seemed to him the last
word in feminine elegance. The colouring was sea-green and white, the toilet
table was green, the walls white. The sitting-room was hung with silk tapestry
in the same colour scheme. There was a great divan heaped with cushions pulled
up to the opened windows which led on to a small terrace. The bookcases of
green and white were filled mostly with modern books, and chiefly French or
translations from Russian into French. He picked up a volume of Bunin and
glanced at it helplessly. Upon the baby grand piano were some sheets of music,
too, on which even the names of the composers were unknown to him.</p>
<p>"All affectation," she assured him; "most of my belongings. I am feeling my
way. I have not got much beyond Debussy yet. I cannot decide whether I really
care for the new era in music or books. Sometimes Debussy's music sends me
nearly crazy. Sometimes these new people seem to hurt, like someone who touches
you on the raw."</p>
<p>"You play yourself?" he asked.</p>
<p>She sat down on the low stool and before her fingers had touched a dozen
notes, he was conscious of an indefinite sense of excitement. She
played&mdash;looking at him with the faintest of smiles upon her
lips&mdash;curious, quivering chords which seemed to suggest new harmonies in
colour, new and more vivid sensations. In a moment she was up and by his
side.</p>
<p>"That's something which was sent me by a new man&mdash;a Georgian," she
said. "Come, I must show you my bedroom; then Dobson will expect us to eat
lunch. I don't know what you think of me, perhaps you don't think anything at
all, but I am sure when you see my room you will think I am a <i>poseuse</i>."</p>
<p>She laughed as she threw open the door. There was a simple wooden bedstead
painted green, two large chairs, a white carpet and a crucifix which might have
been by Benvenuto Cellini. She caught his glance directed towards it.</p>
<p>"You are wondering at me, a Jewess," she exclaimed. "Don't. It is just an
emblem to me of something&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;simplicity,
self-discipline, anything you like. I have no religion. But emblems do mean
something, and it is beautiful. Sometimes," she went on, taking his arm and
leading him towards the door, "I am reconciled to all that horrible atmosphere
of Park Lane and to the day-by-day life there just because of two things.
Wealth may be ugly and gross in itself and draw out all that is worst in
everybody, but it enables you, if you love such things, to surround yourself
with beauty. I sometimes think," she continued, as they descended the stairs,
"that every now and then in his moments of solitude&mdash;and my father spends
just as much time as ever he can alone&mdash;he must have something the same
idea, or else he could scarcely have selected all his pictures without making a
mistake. Some day you must let me show you the picture gallery, a day when the
light is clear, when there is neither fog nor sunshine. They are his own
choice, you know, and if there is one thing he is proud of in life it is that
Duvaine often comes to him for his opinion, if he suspects a picture, and
Father has never been known to make a mistake.... Don't you love the little
dining-room? Gloomy, perhaps, with all this black oak, but it is the original.
The panels were all in the Friars' Chapel&mdash;and these chairs too. I wonder
what you care to drink for lunch? Men have such different tastes. Father loves
this old Berncastler Doctor. I am rather surprised he spared me any. Another
cocktail?"</p>
<p>"Not if I am going to drink that wine," he replied reverently.</p>
<p>"Open that casement window a little wider before you sit down," she begged
him. "Don't you love the perfume of those hyacinths? And there must be some
sweet-smelling shrubs just outside there.... What do you think of my birthday
present?"</p>
<p>"I think it is the gift of an emperor to a princess."</p>
<p>"Shall I be like the princesses of old, then," she said, "when they received
guests? Shall I offer to share it with you?"</p>
<p>He took the hand she laid suddenly upon his and raised it to his lips.</p>
<p>"Alas," he answered lightly, "to carry on the fable&mdash;if I accept what
is offered in such fashion, I lose my heart."</p>
<p>"And if you refuse," she reminded him, "unless the Princess has a thoroughly
nice disposition, you lose your head also!"</p>
<p>A silent figure advanced from the background.</p>
<p>"Your ladyship is served," Dobson announced.</p>
<hr>
<p>Just as the dusk passed into darkness in the black wood at the back of the
house, Sandbrook, who had carried himself gallantly yet discreetly through a
difficult day, felt himself suddenly enveloped, caught up and held in the
meshes of what Julia herself afterwards sardonically explained as being one of
her temperamental fits of madness. She had been walking by his side, her arm
through his, walking with all the spring and grace of healthful youth.
Suddenly, without any warning, he felt her in his arms. Her hands were linked
around his neck, he felt her knees trembling, so that he was forced to hold her
up. Her heart beat wildly against his. Her eyes flashed one wonderful challenge
into his; then they were suddenly closed. She clung to him as though she were
drowning, but her quick hurried breathing had lost itself in sobs. Some of the
passionate vitality seemed already to be ebbing away. Her eyes were still
closed but her lips sought for his.</p>
<p>"You must kiss me," she implored. "You must kiss me or I shall die."</p>
<p>He whispered something, he scarcely knew what. He searched the secret part
of his brain for words, but after all, he knew that they reeked of compromise.
Nevertheless, he kissed her and she responded eagerly, feverishly, like a
starved person. She returned his kisses on the lips. She kissed his eyes. She
lay quite still for a moment, as though swooning; then he felt the strength
coming back to her lithe, slender body. Almost as quickly as the storm had
come, it passed. Before he realised it, they were walking again slowly, and
after a few yards they were in sight of the tunnel-like end of the tree-hung
walk. They passed out into the meadow.</p>
<p>"Are you angry with me?" she asked gently.</p>
<p>"Angry!" he repeated. "Julia&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Look, there are stars out already," she interrupted. "What foolish things
these naturalists tell us. They say that only exotic flowers smell at night
time. Those violets! You don't mind if I lean on you a little? My knees are
trembling. I suppose I was not meant to be a country girl, yet I know something
about wild flowers. You see my little spinney of bluebells on the right?
Bluebells are such sensible flowers. You pick them and their perfume has gone
as the stem breaks. Violets&mdash;you pick them and their perfume is sweeter
and sweeter, until they fade and die. Forgive me if I am talking nonsense, Lord
Sandbrook&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear," he interrupted, "surely you can drop that absurd name! I'm going
to call you Julia and you must call me Martin."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, broke away from him and stood alone&mdash;a slim,
very elegant figure in the dying light. For a moment, he thought that she was
seized by another paroxysm, then he saw that she was laughing, laughing perhaps
a little hysterically, and yet with a queer undernote of real humorous
enjoyment.</p>
<p>"My dear," she said, "come along and tell me whether you would like to have
an early dinner here or start now for home. After all, I have something out of
the day. I am to call you Martin!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>Mr. Sidney Littleburn, whose wistful persistence had won for him the
salutation of Sandbrook and his companion at Marridge's restaurant, was a man
of no particular personality. His father had been a City clerk before him and
his mother the daughter of a small tradesman. He had a flair for figures, a
passionate desire to get on in the world, and a personal love of money which
was almost a vice. During the earlier days, after the establishment of Woolito,
Limited, he had devoted the whole of his gifts towards the improvement of the
finances of the company, and in these efforts he had been remarkably
successful. He had won rapid and well-deserved advancement. At the present
moment he was the respected tenant of a suite of apartments on the ninth floor
of a block of handsome flats in Kensington. He had a plain wife, whom he had
married for her moderate dowry, no children, a motor car which he had bought at
a great bargain, and the pleasant consciousness that he was not spending half
his income. In appearance, he was like thousands of others who pass their days
upon the anthill. He was inclined to be short; of pallid complexion; he wore a
straggling brown moustache and gold-rimmed spectacles. Away from his work, he
had an abstracted air, as though he were perpetually adding up columns of
figures. In his private office, when he had changed his coat, when his ledgers
were at hand, his bankbook immediately available, the discount rates of the day
at his elbow and surrounded by his myrmidons, he presented altogether a
different appearance. He was a man who was master of his work and he loved it.
In his study, warming his slippered feet at the fire, unfolding his evening
paper and sipping a tardy cup of tea, he was a very ordinary individual
indeed.</p>
<p>"A young person to see you, sir," the maidservant announced, late on the
afternoon of a certain fateful day.</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn lowered his paper. He was incurious but inclined to be
annoyed.</p>
<p>"What sort of a young person?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Respectable enough, sir, to judge by appearances," the maid replied. "I
thought she must have meant the mistress, but she seems quite positive. She
said it was <i>Mr.</i> Littleburn she wanted a few words with."</p>
<p>"Then she's going to be disappointed," was the irritated rejoinder. "There's
no young person who could possibly have anything to say to me. She can go and
see Mrs. Littleburn if she wants to."</p>
<p>The maid turned towards the door. Upon the threshold, she looked back.</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot to say, sir&mdash;she mentioned that she came from
Nottingham."</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn, who had picked up his paper again, failed this time to lower
it. Nevertheless, the column upon which his eyes rested had become slightly
indistinct.</p>
<p>"From Nottingham," he repeated, a moment later. "Didn't she give her
name?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, after all, I had better see what she wants. You can show her
in."</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn waited for his visitor without any show of agitation but with
some annoyance. "A young person from Nottingham" sounded ominous, but at the
worst she could turn out to be no more than a nuisance. He had no idea of the
Nemesis in front of him!</p>
<p>The door reopened presently and Mr. Littleburn found that his visitor had
gone one up in the social scale.</p>
<p>"The young lady, sir," the maid announced and, stepping backwards, closed
the door behind her.</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn laid down his newspaper. The graces of life had never come
his way, and he made no attempt to rise to his feet. He watched the girl who
was crossing the room towards him&mdash;a girl of medium height, pretty,
dressed in cheap clothes, and with a tendency towards buxomness of figure. She
had made indiscreet use of the usual cosmetics and her dress was rather shorter
than the fashion of the moment decreed. That she had tried to look her best
was, under the circumstances, only natural. Mr. Littleburn removed his reading
spectacles.</p>
<p>"What do you want with me, Charlotte?" he demanded. "You have no right to
come here. I have answered all your letters and you know how we stand."</p>
<p>"You might invite me to sit down before you begin asking questions," she
complained, in an aggrieved tone.</p>
<p>"I would rather you didn't stay," he told her. "My wife is here and might
come in at any moment."</p>
<p>"Well, I sha'n't bite her," the young woman rejoined, as she coolly flopped
into a chair. "It's quite true you have answered my letters, but not in the way
you ought to have done."</p>
<p>"I should like to know how I could have answered them differently," was the
frigid reply. "I have sent you at least four ten-pound notes during the last
few months, and less than a year ago I paid for your father's funeral."</p>
<p>"You didn't," the young woman contradicted. "The firm paid for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn coughed.</p>
<p>"At my instigation," he pointed out. "It was the same thing. You wanted a
post in London and I told you at once that there was nothing doing."</p>
<p>"You didn't want me up here, I suppose."</p>
<p>"It's not that at all. We are overstaffed at the present moment. Your
friends live in Nottingham, and you are much more likely to settle down there
than up in London amongst strangers. Have you come for money?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she answered, looking at him curiously.</p>
<p>"Because, if you have," he went on, "let me tell you now&mdash;you won't get
any. I might be inclined to pay your fare back again to the country, but only
on consideration that you don't trouble me again."</p>
<p>Still her eyes seemed to be searching his face and, if Mr. Littleburn had
been a man of greater sensibility, he might have become irritated or disturbed
by that calm scrutiny.</p>
<p>"You were generous enough with Father when he was alive," she remarked. "He
got money from you every week&mdash;a nice sum too."</p>
<p>"Your father had been my very valued assistant at the mills which I was
engaged in winding up," was the cold reply. "He rendered the firm certain
services which I considered it my duty to repay."</p>
<p>"You kept on sending him money after he had got the sack," she reminded
him.</p>
<p>"If I did," he retorted, "that was my affair. If I chose to be generous to a
man who had worked for me, that is no reason why, after his death, I should be
expected to transfer my benefactions to his family. If it comes to that, Miss
Charlotte, you have had money from me too. Two hundred pounds I spent on
furnishing your apartment."</p>
<p>"You got what you wanted for it, I suppose," was the brusque comment. "Now
Father's dead and you've come to live in London again, you just want to wipe me
out."</p>
<p>"Supposing I do," he answered. "Isn't that reasonable? You're capable of
looking after yourself. If you really wanted work, I might consider giving you
a letter to one of our branches in your district. They might find you a post,
but that is the utmost I can do for you, and it would be entirely in their
hands whether they found you anything or not."</p>
<p>She looked at him with a curious fixedness.</p>
<p>"You are not a very nice man, are you?" she said unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn was indisposed to waste anything in life&mdash;even his
emotions&mdash;but he was almost inclined to be angry.</p>
<p>"Did you come up here to tell me that?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"No," she replied. "I came up to ask why you should not make me an
allowance, like you did Father."</p>
<p>"You're mad!" he scoffed. "I made no regular allowance to your father. I
simply let him have some money until we could find another post for him."</p>
<p>"Eight pounds a week," she reminded him calmly. "It came quite regularly,
too, through the bank. I know, because I saw the book. What was it for?"</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn stretched out his hand and rang the bell. She made no effort
to protest.</p>
<p>"That," he said, "is my answer to you."</p>
<p>She rose to her feet. A vague odour of cheap perfume crept into the
atmosphere of the room. She stood like a statue of indifference until the maid
appeared.</p>
<p>"Show the young lady out," Mr. Littleburn directed.</p>
<p>She departed without a word of farewell or a backward glance. Mr. Littleburn
looked steadily at the closed door for several moments. He was not accustomed
to the unusual in life, but it struck him that there had been something
peculiar about this interview. The fact that he was altogether devoid of
imagination kept fear from haunting his pillow that night.</p>
<p>Three evenings later, Mr. Sidney Littleburn was seated in very much the same
position in his study, his feet stretched out to the fire, reading his evening
paper. Once more the maidservant entered.</p>
<p>"The young person to see you, sir," she announced. "Same as called the other
evening."</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn rustled his paper impatiently.</p>
<p>"What impertinence," he exclaimed. "Harriet!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"I refuse to see her. Put her in the lift and send her away."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>There was a brief interval, but Mr. Littleburn did not resume the study of
his newspaper. He found himself vaguely disturbed. Presently the knock at the
door was repeated and the maid reappeared.</p>
<p>"The young woman is very difficult, sir," she announced. "She says that her
business with you will only take two minutes but that it is of vital
importance. You will excuse me, sir, but she told me to add that it was more
important to you than to her."</p>
<p>"Impudence!" Mr. Littleburn exclaimed indignantly. "Very well, then,
Harriet, show her in. If I ring twice don't hesitate&mdash;send for a
policeman."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>In due course, Charlotte Masters was ushered in. She was dressed in the same
fashion as on her former visit&mdash;if anything, the odour of her perfume was
slightly stronger; otherwise, she was unchanged. She sat down without waiting
for an invitation.</p>
<p>"I thought," Mr. Littleburn said, "that I had made myself clear as to how we
stood on your last visit?"</p>
<p>"You made it quite clear," the young woman replied, "what a low hound you
were."</p>
<p>He turned towards the bell. She stopped him with an imperative gesture.</p>
<p>"You had better not," she advised. "I am here to warn you for your own
sake&mdash;not mine. I'm all right. The people who found me out in Nottingham
and brought me up to London are treating me like Christians. What's going to
happen to you I don't know, but you have got to make up your mind quick."</p>
<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" Mr. Littleburn asked, with a queer
sensation of discomfort creeping over him.</p>
<p>"You and my father," she continued, "faked the books of the Colney mills
which your company&mdash;Woolito&mdash;took over. When you ordered them to be
burnt, my Dad was not quite the fool he seemed, and he didn't burn them. He
left them in a parcel under his bed."</p>
<p>"I saw the books thrown into the furnace," Mr. Littleburn called out in a
sudden frenzy.</p>
<p>"You saw some books&mdash;not the Colney mills' books. That was where Dad
was clever, for once in his life. Here, you had better read this letter. It was
wrapped up in the parcel."</p>
<p>She crossed the room and handed him a letter. He withdrew it from the
envelope, gazed at it for a moment helplessly, then a sudden gleam of hope lit
up his face.</p>
<p>"This letter is typewritten," he declared. "Your father couldn't use a
typewriter. He told me so. What is all this? A conspiracy, eh?"</p>
<p>He held the letter in his hands as though about to tear it through. She only
smiled.</p>
<p>"You silly old josser," she said. "Knowing you as well as I do, do you think
I was going to bring you Dad's original letter? That's a copy&mdash;an exact
copy too&mdash;word for word. I typed it myself."</p>
<p>He adjusted his spectacles and read it slowly through. One by one the
sentences seemed to stand out before his eyes in letters of fire.</p>
<blockquote>DEAR CHARLOTTE,<br>
<br>
This is in case anything sudden or unexpected should happen to me before
Littleburn settles up the amount he promised.<br>
<br>
He came down here to wind up the Colney mills. There's no doubt about it, the
books had been badly kept. Mr. Hammond, he underpaid everybody and he had no
head for figures himself. When Mr. Littleburn had finished going through the
books he asked me to stay with him one night. He didn't put it straight at
first, in case I was not agreeable, and I must say it was a week before I made
up my mind. Then I did what he wanted me to. We were only robbing the company
that had ruined us, and I wanted something for you. It was the easiest thing in
the world to fake our ledgers so that we seemed to pay out to our creditors a
good deal more than we had to, and to receive from debtors a great deal less
than we did. Apart from that, we made out entries of returns sold at a very
reduced price and, in short, we cleared up about eighteen thousand pounds. All
the time Mr. Littleburn was handing me out as much money as I wanted to spend
and that was the time I began to drink.<br>
<br>
When everything was wound up I wanted my share. First he said the books must be
burnt, and as everything was being cleared out from the place to have it got
into order for the Woolito staff, that was not difficult. Only it was just then
I began not to trust Littleburn. What I thought was&mdash;if he would rob his
own company just because he loves money, why shouldn't he rob me? And if the
books were gone, who was going to believe my word&mdash;if ever the
defalcations were found out&mdash;that he had any hand in them? So what I did
was this. I got an exactly similar lot of books from one of the other branches
which were going to be destroyed, and I burnt them. He and I did it together
one dark night out in the furnace. They were all grey ashes in two minutes.
Directly it was over, he shook me by the hand and took me down to the hotel in
Nottingham. I had too much to drink. Perhaps that was my fault but anyhow, I
remember what he said and I agreed to stick to it for a time. He said that we
might have to return the money which he had got put away, so that it could be
transferred into the Woolito account at a moment's notice if there were any
suspicions. In a year's time, he said, if everything were all right, we would
divide up. In the meantime he would send me eight pounds a week. I agreed. It
seemed reasonable enough. But the year has gone by and I have seen nothing of
my share. If I don't hear something definite in a fortnight, I am going up to
London, but am just leaving this note and the real books here, in case anything
should happen to me and he should play the dirty. If he won't pay up my share
when I get there, I shall give him the fright of his life. I shall tell him I
have still got the books and that I am going to take them to the
accountants.<br>
<br>
I don't suppose you will ever read this note, because I shall get everything
settled up, but I am taking the long chance that something might happen to
me.<br>
<br>
From your<br>
<br>
DAD.</blockquote>
<p>When Sidney Littleburn had finished reading, he doubted no longer. He knew
that this was his death warrant. His only hope was the girl. The letter
fluttered from his fingers. He gripped the sides of his chair. He leaned
forward towards her.</p>
<p>"Charlotte," he pleaded, "you've won. You have got me, all right. You don't
want to ruin me? Where are&mdash;the books?"</p>
<p>There was sympathy in her eyes but doom in her words.</p>
<p>"They have been sent in to some accountants&mdash;to your own accountants,"
she told him.</p>
<p>"What?" Mr. Littleburn shouted.</p>
<p>"They have gone in to the accountants," the girl repeated, her voice a
little harder, as she thought of her own wrongs. "Eight pounds a week you were
paying Father and no telling how long that would have gone on for&mdash;and
about eighteen thousand you put in your own pocket&mdash;and as soon as you
think Dad is well out of the way, not a ten-pound note for me! You're a nice
fellow. Anyhow, you've got what's coming to you!"</p>
<p>Mr. Littleburn tried to speak but something was wrong with his tongue. He
tried to rise to his feet but something was wrong with his knees. He looked at
this terrible vision of fate, saw her slowly rise and move towards the door.
From there she looked back.</p>
<p>"I'm giving you this chance," she said, "in case you want to hop it. I
should say the police would be round before long."</p>
<p>Then there was the sound of the door opening and closing. Miss Charlotte
Masters had fulfilled her mission.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Littleburn rang the bell. He was holding on to the sides of his chair
when the maid returned, but his voice was fairly steady.</p>
<p>"Some whisky and soda, Harriet," he ordered.</p>
<p>As Mr. Littleburn never drank between meals, the maid received the order
with some surprise. She returned with a tray, however, and drew a small table
up to the side of his chair. He waited until the girl had left the room, then
he poured out half a tumblerful of whisky, added some soda water and had a long
drink.... He had never at any time in his life even contemplated the idea of
suicide. He had played always for safety, and the one great risk he had ever
taken had seemed to pass into grey ashes with the burning of those ledgers. Now
they were all around him&mdash;the mocking, taunting imps&mdash;beckoning him
on to destruction! The gods of his life were money, respectability, a solid
position. He had no vices to come to his aid, no resources of philanthropy or
religion to help him through the hell that was yawning at his feet. He crossed
the room, threw open the window and slipped on to the sill.</p>
<p>If there was a thought in his mind at all, as he passed the chaos of mist
and driving sleet, it was a faint impulse of thankfulness that he had chosen
the ninth-floor flat for the sake of the view.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Lord Marsom presided, a few days later, over a hurricane meeting of the
directors of Woolito, Limited. Besides himself, there were present Sir
Sigismund Lunt, the ghastly shadow of his former self, John Henry Bomford, who
had lost thirty pounds and whose head drooped feebly upon his shoulders, Sir
Alfred Honeyman, a tall, elderly man with aquiline nose and high cheekbones,
dressed with meticulous care, formal and precise of speech, Mr. Thomas Moody,
who had been for years engaged in the laboratories of the firm, Mr.
Mayden-Harte, who was general supervisor of the factories, and Sandbrook, who
was the sole representative of the outside or guinea-pig element. Lord Marsom
waved them to their places and started the business without preliminaries.</p>
<p>"The minutes of the last meeting will be read when we meet again," he
announced. "We are here to elect two new directors to take the places of Mr.
Archibald Somerville and Mr. Sidney Littleburn. I propose George Pullen and
Morris Grinen, who will join us next month. Moody, here, will second them. Any
dissentients?"</p>
<p>"One moment, Mr. Chairman," Sir Alfred Honeyman intervened. "I should like
to ask a question. Is there to be no discussion as to the extraordinary series
of accidents which have ended in the deaths of two and the serious illness of
two more of our fellow directors?"</p>
<p>"Afterwards," Marsom snapped. "Elect the two directors first. I propose. Who
seconds? Thank you, Mr. Moody. Hands up. Carried unanimously. Take that down,"
he directed Miss Frances Moore, who was seated in the background, a short
distance away from the table.</p>
<p>"Where's Mr. Crooks, our secretary?" someone asked. "Nothing has happened to
him, I hope?"</p>
<p>"Nothing has happened to him, nor is anything likely to," was the curt
rejoinder. "I instructed Miss Moore to be here and take down the minutes this
morning because, as you know, she is our publicity secretary, and she's been in
touch with Scotland Yard concerning these unfortunate happenings to members of
our board. Ask her anything you want to."</p>
<p>"Have Scotland Yard any theory?" Sir Alfred Honeyman enquired.</p>
<p>"So far," Miss Frances Moore replied, "they are unable to accept Lord
Marsom's idea that these disasters have been due to a single agency. I saw the
sub-commissioner again this morning. He pointed out, for example, that Mr.
Littleburn's suicide was due, not to the intervention of any other person, but
to the knowledge that his defalcations were discovered, and that he was on the
point of arrest. There was nothing to connect that, for instance, with the
burning of the Tottenham sheds and the abduction of Sir Sigismund Lunt. The
fact that Mr. Bomford's prospective son-in-law did not turn up for his
daughter's wedding and that a deplorable scandal thereby ensued they look upon
as an entirely outside incident. The doctor's certificate proved that Mr.
Archibald Somerville had been liable to the sort of stroke from which he died
for years, and that the incident which brought it on was an entirely natural
one. They feel that the only one of the incidents which comes under their
direct jurisdiction is the destruction of the sheds at Tottenham, and they have
several men at work on that, up to the present without any success."</p>
<p>"What do they say about those damned silly cards?" Lord Marsom enquired,
producing a glazed piece of pasteboard from his papers. "Came this morning,
this one," he went on, flicking it across the table. "You see what it says:
'Sidney Littleburn robbed the owner of the Colney mills. Robbers pay!'"</p>
<p>"The sub-commissioner only smiled when I brought up the matter of the
cards," Miss Moore replied. "I think they have an idea that it is the work of
some lunatic connected with the company."</p>
<p>There was a grim and ominous silence. Two shining points of light flashed
like steel in Lord Marsom's shifting black eyes. A line of colour stole up to
his forehead and he struck the table with his fist, so that the inkpot rattled
and the papers rustled.</p>
<p>"They are a pack of nincompoops at Scotland Yard," he shouted. "A
kindergarten of imbeciles! They block the path of justice, instead of clearing
it. Gentlemen, there is a conspiracy against our firm. I don't wonder at it.
Success like ours will always provoke jealousy and enmity; but, my God, if they
think they are going to bring Woolito, Limited, to its knees, they're wrong! It
may be my turn at any moment. I'm prepared. My will is made and my executors
nominated. Furthermore, my successor is appointed, and there is a long list
from which I desire that our future directors are elected. They can't kill us
all off, gentlemen, and I'll tell you another thing. They'll never break
Woolito, Limited."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of applause. Some of the more nervous of the little
company seemed to have regained courage.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," Marsom concluded, "you'll find refreshments in the library. I
will join you there in a moment or two. I wish to have a word with our
publicity secretary here."</p>
<p>They all rose and made towards the door, with the exception of Sir Alfred
Honeyman. He lingered at the table, his long fingers caressing the white edge
of his waistcoat.</p>
<p>"This meeting has been broken up rather sooner than I expected," he said. "I
intended to apply, Lord Marsom, for two months' leave of absence."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"My wife is in poor health and I myself need a holiday."</p>
<p>"Rubbish!" was the curt reply. "This is no time to talk of holidays, with
orders rolling in and forty thousand workpeople to look after. Send your wife
to the South of France, if she needs a change. You stay here and look after
your job till we're running smoothly again."</p>
<p>Sir Alfred would have liked to have pleaded his cause, for fear had settled
down upon him, and the prospect of a couple of months away from this disastrous
epoch was perilously sweet. Lord Marsom's attitude, however, was as crushing as
his words sounded, and his fellow director slipped away.</p>
<p>"Lot of rats," the former muttered, as he resumed his seat. "What do you
think of this business, Miss Moore?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I can't help thinking there is something in the attitude which
Scotland Yard takes up," she admitted. "I can't find the link and I tried as
hard as anyone could. Mr. Littleburn, for instance, threw himself out of the
window and broke his neck because, if he had lived, he would have been
disgraced and sent to prison. No outside person could have been responsible for
that."</p>
<p>"Who found out the defalcations?" Marsom growled.</p>
<p>"The daughter of his accomplice, I understand. He was treating her unfairly
and she sent the books, which he thought had been destroyed, to the
accountants. There isn't a single unusual circumstance in connection with the
affair&mdash;except that ridiculous card."</p>
<p>"Supposing there is a conspiracy on foot, when do you suppose they will have
a go at me?" he demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>"I should think, if there is a band of humorists at work, they would keep
you till the last."</p>
<p>"Humorists, you call them! I'll show them a funnier game than they are
playing, if ever I get my hands on them!... What do you think of that fellow
Honeyman trying to sneak away under his wife's skirts?"</p>
<p>"Not much," she admitted. "Perhaps he's fond of his wife, though."</p>
<p>"So was I fond of mine, in a way, but I didn't want her always around. She
used to spend most of her time at her villa in Cannes. As for Honeyman's
marital devotion, that's all my eye. He nearly got into a bad mess down in
Nottinghamshire. Sacked the foreman at one of the mills down there, when we
were taking over, got him up to the north of England, and played around with
his wife afterwards! Even now the old humbug has a mistress in Mayfair and
dines with her once a week at a little restaurant that we all know in
Soho!"</p>
<p>Miss Frances Moore rose to her feet.</p>
<p>"If there is no more business&mdash;" she began.</p>
<p>"Sit down," her employer interrupted. "I want to ask you a serious question.
You see old Lunt and Bomford&mdash;broken men both of them. There's Littleburn
and Somerville dead. Four of my directors wiped out in less than as many
months. It doesn't matter what Scotland Yard has to say about it. Could any
fool in the world believe that this series of vicious incidents are not linked
up somehow or other?"</p>
<p>Miss Frances Moore was unperturbed.</p>
<p>"Well, Sub-commissioner Mallinson must be one of the so-called fools," she
said, "for he has decided that there is no connection whatever between these
happenings. If you want to know what I think, my opinion is that you have
chosen a poor class of man to help you carry on your great business. Your
directors have gotten into trouble because they have not known how to support
success. When you elect new men on the board, I should try and get hold of some
of a different type."</p>
<p>Marsom was suddenly conscious of a serious change of outlook, a change in
his own psychology, which puzzled him. The fury of a few minutes ago had
passed. With her quiet manner and convincing words, this extraordinary young
woman had certainly had a soothing effect upon him. Perhaps she was right.
Perhaps this idea of his that some enemies were working against his prosperity
and the prosperity of the company was madness. Where could the brains have come
from to have evolved schemes such as these from which he had suffered? As for
the cards, they were scarcely a factor worthy of serious consideration. Any ill
wisher with a sardonic sense of humour who read the newspapers might easily be
responsible. The whole situation began to group itself in the landscape of his
mind from the point of view of this remarkable young woman who was seated by
his side, perfectly natural in her manners, well poised and reasonable. He
watched her for a few moments quizzically. A new idea had come to him. He was
revolving it in his mind. Curious that he had never before realised that she
was in her way a very attractive personage. His taste in the sex had mostly run
to the easily wooed theatrical type, but he was able also to appreciate the
quiet elegance of his present companion's simple toilette and the restraint of
her manner. He found himself studying her with new eyes and was suddenly
conscious that he was very tired indeed of the flamboyant wiles of Miss Rosie
Melton, his latest fancy. For the moment, at any rate, the reverse type was
appealing to him.</p>
<p>"What are you doing this evening?" Marsom asked. "Will you dine with
me&mdash;here in this house? I shall be quite alone. My daughter is away, I
know."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," was the quiet but very firm reply. "That would be quite
impossible."</p>
<p>"Just why?"</p>
<p>"It would be contrary to my custom and my inclination," she told him. "If
there is no more business to discuss, I should like to leave now, Lord
Marsom."</p>
<p>"You'll stay where you are until I've finished," he enjoined furiously.
"Customs and inclinations! You talk like a little shopgirl. You know something
of life, I suppose, don't you? You attract me. I don't know why, but you do.
Stay with me to dinner to-night and I'll give you a pearl necklace worth a
thousand pounds. You see, I don't beat about the bush. You know now. You know
what I want. The thousand pounds ought to tell you."</p>
<p>The very small lines at the corners of Miss Frances Moore's eyes suddenly
creased and a faint smile parted her lips.</p>
<p>"If I were the little shopgirl you called me," she said, "I should pretend
to be insulted. As it is, I remain, as you see, quite calm. It's very nice of
you, I'm sure, but all the same, I don't want a pearl necklace, and I wouldn't
dream of dining alone with you."</p>
<p>"Not if I promised&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Whatever you promised, I know what you'd do," she interrupted. "No, Lord
Marsom. I'm beginning to have a certain admiration for you, as a man who knows
his own mind and dominates others, but I should have to care a great deal more
than that for anyone from whom I accepted a thousand-pound necklace!"</p>
<p>"Get to hell out of here," he ordered, the colour mounting in his cheeks
once more. "Take your notebook and your smug little face away."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that I'm dismissed?" she asked coolly.</p>
<p>"Yes," he shouted.</p>
<p>She made a little calculation.</p>
<p>"I shall want two hundred and fifty pounds, in lieu of notice," she warned
him.</p>
<p>"Woolito can't stand it," he groaned. "Get on with your job, and get ready,
too, to change your mind."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>Sir Alfred Honeyman rose sedately from his comfortable easy chair, situated
in a corner of the sombre smoking-room of the West End club which had the
distinction of counting him amongst its members, and followed the youth who had
brought him the message across to the telephone box. Here he closed the door
securely, cleared his throat and took up the receiver. A very pleasant, if
somewhat affected, feminine voice greeted him.</p>
<p>"Is that Sir Alfred Honeyman?"</p>
<p>"Speaking, my dear Molly," was the dignified reply.</p>
<p>There was a little fluttering sigh of content.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad to find you. I wonder whether you are going to be perfectly
sweet and do what I ask you?"</p>
<p>Sir Alfred was not the man to commit himself rashly. There were already
several counterfoils in his personal cheque book which needed glossing
over.</p>
<p>"If it's anything within my power&mdash;" he began.</p>
<p>"Of course it's within your power. I want you to come and dine with me
to-night."</p>
<p>"To-night?" he repeated. "To-morrow night is our usual date."</p>
<p>"I would so much rather you came to-night," the voice at the other end of
the line pleaded. "I am just lonely. I think that's what it is. I have been
bored all day. If you don't come, I shall feel like putting on my prettiest
frock and going to a dancing club!"</p>
<p>Sir Alfred reflected for a moment, conscious of a little thrill of
anticipatory pleasure. Only a few minutes ago, on his way from the City, it had
seemed to him that Friday was a long way off.</p>
<p>"I shall be delighted to save you from such an indiscretion, my dear child,"
he said. "Where do you wish to dine?"</p>
<p>"What a dear you are! At Costelli's, please. Shall we say eight o'clock, so
that we have a nice long evening?"</p>
<p>"Eight o'clock will suit me admirably," Sir Alfred acquiesced.</p>
<p>Sir Alfred rang off, closed the door of the telephone box and returned to
his easy chair. His step was a little more buoyant and he was conscious of
vague sensations not altogether seemly in a person of sixty years of age, who
was very much married indeed. Life had seemed a very dull place a few minutes
ago. The sound of Molly's voice&mdash;a fascinating creature she was&mdash;had
changed all that. He rang the bell by his side.</p>
<p>"A glass of dry sherry," he ordered.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Pomme d'Or is a small restaurant on the outskirts of Soho, kept by an
Italian calling himself Luigi Costelli. It is white-fronted, its lunching or
dining habitu&eacute;s are concealed from curious eyes by green blinds and, if
one took the trouble to glance upwards to the third or fourth story, one might
notice that there was again a row of windows with green blinds and a general
air of habitation. As a matter of fact, the Pomme d'Or, although it does not
advertise the fact, fills the general purposes of an hotel to the initiated.
The place is small, the number of waiters few, but the cutlery and linen are of
the best and the lighting discreet. The carpet, too, is soft to the feet and
the chairs are comfortable. It is not for his compatriots or for the
tradespeople of the neighbourhood that Luigi Costelli keeps open his little
<i>h&ocirc;tellerie de luxe</i>. His patrons are mostly English or Americans and
their names would make a somewhat surprising list. Sir Alfred Honeyman had
heard the place spoken of at a men's dinner which he had attended for business
purposes. He had visited it for the first time with trepidation, but also with
a subdued sense of excitement, which had never altogether left him. The place
suggested wrong-doing, but suggested it in an insidious and pleasing manner. It
was perfectly possible to dine on any night in his present companion's cosy
little dining room, ministered to by her discreet little maid. Like the moth
attracted to the candle, however, this seductive restaurant near Soho filled
Sir Alfred with a larger and more satisfied sense of adventure.</p>
<p>From the moment when Molly, looking more attractive than ever, had swept
into the little dining-room and come to meet him with outstretched hands,
nothing could have seemed more auspicious than the commencement of that
black-letter night which was to stand out forever amongst the disastrous
memories of Sir Alfred's ostensibly correct life. The corner table which he
specially affected had been carefully prepared for him and his companion. The
half bottle of their favourite champagne stood in the ice pail, and a bottle of
the particular brand of Chianti which they both fancied stood upon the table.
The <i>hors d'oeuvres</i> and caviare had never been better. Molly had never
appeared sweeter or more affectionate. Sir Alfred who, as a rule, monopolised
the conversation, became almost silent through sheer content, and his
companion, who desired very much to discuss immediately certain aspects of her
own financial position, in view of a possible <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>, much
appreciated the change.</p>
<p>The swinging open and closing of the door was not an every-minute occurrence
in this somewhat exclusive establishment, and both Sir Alfred Honeyman and the
lady whom he was entertaining glanced up simultaneously when it occurred during
a pause in their conversation. Sir Alfred saw a rather tall,
distinguished-looking stranger&mdash;clean-shaven and very well
dressed&mdash;sauntering towards an unreserved table on the opposite side of
the room, accompanied by a powerfully built younger man who had the air of a
naval officer in mufti. What Molly saw was apparently something more serious.
She dropped her knife and fork and a little cry broke from her lips.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, my dear?" her escort asked quickly.</p>
<p>The words seemed to have died upon her lips. She remained silent. The
younger man, who had approached the table, appeared to be both angry and
surprised. His eyes were fixed upon Molly.</p>
<p>"Molly!" he exclaimed. "Is that really you?"</p>
<p>"Charles!" she cried. "Whatever are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The man's face hardened. Sir Alfred, who had not grasped the seriousness of
the situation, ventured upon a gesture of politeness.</p>
<p>"Won't you introduce me to your friend?" he suggested.</p>
<p>Molly grasped his arm as though for protection and shrank back in her
place.</p>
<p>"He is not my friend," she gasped. "It's my husband!"</p>
<p>Sir Alfred felt a cold shiver running down his back.</p>
<p>"You told me that your husband was dead," he faltered.</p>
<p>"Dead to me," she murmured. "What I meant was that we were
separated&mdash;that he was abroad. Charles, what are you doing back in
England?"</p>
<p>"If you will be so good as to spare me a few minutes of your time," was the
dignified reply, "I will tell you. Afterwards," the newcomer added, with a
sudden turn towards Sir Alfred, "I shall have a certain matter to discuss with
you, sir."</p>
<p>Sir Alfred looked for his hat.</p>
<p>"You are a stranger to me," he declared. "I know nothing about you at all.
There is nothing for us to discuss."</p>
<p>Molly, however, had already left her place. She was standing, unfortunately
for her companion's plan of escape, in the direct route towards the door,
clinging to the newcomer's arm and endeavouring to pacify him. The latter,
however, seemed to be very hard indeed to pacify. Every few minutes he showed
signs of wishing to break away and reach Sir Alfred. On each occasion, however,
Molly was just able to prevent this. Finally the older man rose from his place,
came across the room and joined in the discussion. He was apparently on the
side of peace, for at last, without any further glance towards the elderly
Lothario, the two men retreated to the door, took down their coats and hats,
and left the restaurant. Molly resumed her chair with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Thank God," she exclaimed, "he's gone! Pour me out some wine, please."</p>
<p>A waiter appeared from the background. He was not unaccustomed to such
scenes and as he was of fragile build and had a great dislike to pugilistic
encounters, he had been keeping carefully out of the way. He filled the glasses
of Monsieur and of Madame as desired and both drank eagerly. The former felt
some sparks of his courage gradually returning.</p>
<p>"So you are married," he said gloomily.</p>
<p>"My dear," she assured him, clutching at his hand, "I thought that he was
gone for good. It was only the other day I heard that someone thought they had
seen him. He deserted me most shamefully. I have nothing to reproach myself
with. He knows that he has not the slightest right to interfere, whatever I may
choose to do."</p>
<p>"He seemed upset enough to see you with me," Sir Alfred observed.</p>
<p>"I can't help that," she replied. "I told him plainly that nothing would
induce me to go back to him, and if he made a scene, I would send for the
police. He has gone now and he's not coming back again."</p>
<p>"Are you sure of that?" Sir Alfred asked.</p>
<p>"Certain," she declared. "Here's the chicken. Let's enjoy our dinner and
forget all about him."</p>
<p>Her companion did his best but without complete success. His spirits rose,
however, when, after coffee and an extra brandy, they found no one waiting
outside in the street and stepped safely into a taxi. Nevertheless, at the
corner of Shepherd's Market and Hertford Street, his courage again wavered.</p>
<p>"I think I won't come in to-night, Molly," he said. "I have some letters I
ought to write and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her arm was suddenly around his neck and her lips pressed against his. She
drew him across the threshold.</p>
<p>"He won't come back," she whispered. "His friend will see to that. Even if
he did, I should know how to deal with him."</p>
<p>So Alfred Honeyman mounted the stairs which he once thought such an
enchanting passage to happiness, stepped through the door which Molly opened
and faced Nemesis.</p>
<hr>
<p>Police Constable Choppin stated his case in court on the following morning.
Notebook in hand, he took his place on the stand and was duly sworn.</p>
<p>"If you please, your Worship," he began, "I was called to Number 17a.
Shepherd's Market at about eleven o'clock last night by a woman, who was
leaning out of the window and shrieking. I made my way up to the room and found
the prisoner beating up another man. I arrested them both, but thought it best
to leave the injured one in the Casualty Ward at St. George's Hospital. I gave
him instructions there that the case would be heard this morning at this Police
Court, and that he would be expected to attend for purposes of the
prosecution."</p>
<p>"Did you take the names and addresses of these two men?" the magistrate
asked.</p>
<p>"I did, sir. The prisoner gave his name and address as Charles Bradman, of
Number 7, Hazleton Gardens. Profession, a retired naval petty officer. I have
since verified the address, your Worship, and found it to be correct. The other
gentleman, refused to give his name or address, but I was able to ascertain
that he is Sir Alfred Honeyman, associated with the Woolito business in
Basinghall Street in the City and residing at Number 33, Lexham Square."</p>
<p>A solicitor rose and addressed the magistrate.</p>
<p>"Your Worship," he said, "I am representing the accused. May I be allowed to
explain what happened?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Mr. Rawlings. You may proceed," the magistrate assented.</p>
<p>"My client who, I may remind you, gave his name and address when asked
without hesitation, returned home unexpectedly last night and found his wife in
the company of another man, a man well known in City circles, married and
living with his family. My client appears to have given him a thrashing, during
the course of which the woman became alarmed and called for the police. My
client submitted to arrest quite quietly and the other party in the struggle
was taken to the hospital in an ambulance."</p>
<p>"Stop," the magistrate ordered. "Where is Sir Alfred at the present
moment?"</p>
<p>"He left the hospital within an hour after his injuries had been attended
to," the policeman replied, "and has not been heard of since."</p>
<p>"Were his injuries serious?"</p>
<p>"Not that I could make out, sir. I think he had two black eyes and his cheek
was rather badly cut."</p>
<p>"I consider that, on the whole, I was merciful," the prisoner remarked from
the dock. "He is an older man than I am or I would have given him a much worse
hiding."</p>
<p>The magistrate coughed. He was known to be a man of strict domestic
morals.</p>
<p>"I gather, then, that there is no prosecutor here present?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"No, your Worship."</p>
<p>"Case dismissed."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>Lord Edward Vannerley dropped his eyeglass and turned towards his companion.
The two men&mdash;Sandbrook and his cousin&mdash;were dining in a secluded
corner of Quaglino's.</p>
<p>"Martin, my lad," he said, "do you see a rather queer-looking party of eight
on the other side of the room, three tables from the entrance?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I see them," Sandbrook assented.</p>
<p>"There's a girl there&mdash;dark, with glorious eyes and a beautiful mouth.
Might be a Jewess, or perhaps an Italian. Anyway, she's frightfully well turned
out."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see her."</p>
<p>"Know who she is?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook nodded.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that you don't," he said. "You go out so much more than I do.
That's Lady Julia Pontifex&mdash;Lord Marsom's daughter."</p>
<p>The young man was immensely interested.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "I've seen old Marsom&mdash;huge beast of
a man. Fancy his having a daughter like that! She looks like a beautiful wax
flower&mdash;too delicate to touch."</p>
<p>Sandbrook smiled.</p>
<p>"It's only when she's bored that she looks so thoroughly unapproachable," he
said. "As a matter of fact, she is very intelligent and a delightful young
woman."</p>
<p>"You know her, Martin?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. Don't you remember the governor was a director of Marsom's
great company, Woolito, Limited? Your old man didn't take kindly to the
idea."</p>
<p>"A trifle on the stiff side, when it comes to directorships and that sort of
thing," Lord Edward acknowledged gloomily. "He's got about as much idea of
business as I have, and that isn't saying much. If it weren't for his
prejudices, I should have taken a job of some sort long ago. It's not much fun
being the second son of a Duke with three thousand a year to grub along
on."</p>
<p>"Your obvious destination," Sandbrook remarked, signalling to a wine waiter,
"is the altar."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't mind," the other admitted. "Mother has Closters, of course, and
I could have the Tower House any day, if I married. I would rather live there
than at the Castle. Worst of it is," he went on, sighing, "the English
aristocracy are out of fashion just now. American heiresses all seem to be
marrying either cinema stars or Russian princes. A poor lord isn't in the
running at all."</p>
<p>"There will be a reaction in our favour presently," Sandbrook declared
hopefully.</p>
<p>"You don't need to enter the lists, anyway," was the envious retort. "You're
rolling in it."</p>
<p>"I have enough for my needs," Sandbrook acknowledged. "I am not extravagant,
fortunately."</p>
<p>"I wonder," the young man by his side reflected, "how much Marsom would give
his daughter?"</p>
<p>"A most unsavoury reflection."</p>
<p>"I don't see why. If you marry for money, you at least want to know how much
the girl's got."</p>
<p>"Seen the new show at the Shaftesbury?" Sandbrook enquired, with the obvious
air of one anxious to change the conversation.</p>
<p>"Three times," was the enthusiastic reply. "Ripping, Martin! I thought of
looking in to-night. That little girl in the second act who sings the French
song...."</p>
<p>The young man was off on his hobby. Sandbrook listened abstractedly. Once or
twice he had caught Julia's eye and he was quite sure, although her smile was
of the faintest, that there was something she was trying to say to him.
Presently a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> made his way across the room and, with
a discreet bow, handed to Sandbrook a torn fragment of paper twisted up in the
form of a note.</p>
<p>"From Lady Julia Pontifex, your lordship," he confided, in a half whisper.
"I can take the answer if you wish."</p>
<p>Sandbrook glanced at the hastily pencilled line:</p>
<p>"Please come and ask me to dance. I want to speak to you."</p>
<p>"Tell her ladyship with great pleasure," was the brief reply.</p>
<p>The man bowed and hurried away.</p>
<p>"So you are pals, are you?" Lord Edward exclaimed. "You might do me a good
turn," he went on eagerly. "Are you going to dance with her? Is that it?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook nodded.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind. There must be heaps of parties here with a left-over
girl whom you know. You can find someone, if you want to."</p>
<p>"I would rather dance with Lady Julia than anyone in this room," the young
man confided. "If it was not for the little girl at the Shaftesbury&mdash;"</p>
<p>The music had changed its tune and Sandbrook was already crossing the
floor.</p>
<hr>
<p>"I didn't introduce you," Julia observed. "They are quite nice
people&mdash;Father's friends&mdash;but I don't think you would like them, and
anyhow, I wanted to get away."</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" he asked. "I haven't seen you anywhere for a
fortnight."</p>
<p>"So you really noticed?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I noticed."</p>
<p>"Well, I have been playing lady of the manor down at my new domain," she
told him.</p>
<p>He stiffened slightly. He seemed suddenly to breathe once more the
intoxicating atmosphere of the place, with its sensuous air of luxury, its
almost Boccaccio-like suggestions of intimacy.</p>
<p>"A pleasant party?" he asked politely.</p>
<p>She laughed as she swung a little in his arms. She seemed to have brought
with her the faint odour of those spring flowers, the primroses and the more
pungent hyacinths. They were probably the products of Bond Street, but it was
clever of her to have chosen them.</p>
<p>"A delightful party," she assured him. "I fancy that I am going to be very
happy down there."</p>
<p>Sandbrook looked through the walls of the crowded room. He had quaint
principles, but he was only a man like other men and he was remembering.</p>
<p>"Your father must have very broad ideas, or great confidence in his
daughter, to make you a present like that," he said.</p>
<p>"A delightful speech."</p>
<p>Sandbrook, who was a very careful dancer, narrowly escaped a collision with
an enterprising couple.</p>
<p>"Father is broad-minded enough," she went on, smiling up at him, "except
with regard to his own family. So many men are like that!"</p>
<p>The music changed, but Julia showed not the slightest inclination to let her
partner go. They started again.</p>
<p>"You seem to have a perfect butler and a complete range of servants down at
Weatherlees," he observed. "The only person I didn't notice was a
chaperon."</p>
<p>"I provide her myself."</p>
<p>"I didn't notice one when we were down there."</p>
<p>"That was entirely deliberate," she assured him. "I didn't mean to have one.
I didn't know whether you were dangerous or not; I rather hoped you were."</p>
<p>This tune was a waltz. She lay in his arms a little more closely. The
weariness had gone from her face. She seemed serene and happy.</p>
<p>"And this last house party?" he persisted.</p>
<p>"Consisted of two," she confided. "Alice Greatleys whom I think you know,
and myself. We took down a stock of books and we didn't have a single
visitor."</p>
<p>"Alice Greatleys is a dear," he remarked, "but isn't she rather an elderly
companion for you?"</p>
<p>"I don't find her so," Julia replied. "She has brains anyway. We read the
same books and play the same music.... Father knows I have queer tastes and he
told me, when he gave me the house, that he would never ask me who my guests
were. If you had stayed down with me that week-end," she concluded, lowering
her voice a little, "he would not have said a word."</p>
<p>The music was throbbing in their blood. He leaned towards her.</p>
<p>"Not even if we had been alone?"</p>
<p>"Not even if we had been alone," she answered. "I meant you to stay, when I
took you down. Whenever you choose to come again, there will be no chaperon
and, unless you wish them, there will be no other guests."</p>
<p>The music stopped. Sandbrook, who had thought himself in perfect condition,
was a little breathless. Julia was absolutely composed, except for the fires of
her deep, slumberous eyes. Suddenly Sandbrook felt a hand upon his shoulder.
His young cousin, who had been dancing and had disposed of his partner, was
standing there, his expression very clearly indicating what he desired.</p>
<p>"I say, Martin," he begged, "won't you present me to Lady Julia?"</p>
<p>"By all means," Sandbrook assented. "Lady Julia, this is my cousin, Lord
Edward Vannerley. Lady Julia Pontifex."</p>
<p>The young man bowed and fingered his tie nervously.</p>
<p>"May I have the next dance, Lady Julia?" he asked. "They are starting up
almost directly."</p>
<p>"I am so sorry," she answered, "but I have just promised it to Lord
Sandbrook."</p>
<p>"Greedy fellow," the young man complained. "The next one, then?"</p>
<p>"If my party haven't gone," she promised. "At present, they are a little
restless. I don't like the way my hostess is fidgeting with her cloak and
looking at me."</p>
<p>"There's a show on for ten minutes now, anyway," Sandbrook reminded them.
"We will come and bother you again, Lady Julia."</p>
<p>"Please do," she begged, "but don't trade my next dance away."</p>
<p>The two young men threaded their way through the crowded room.</p>
<p>"So you are in high favour with the Salome-like beauty," Edward Vannerley
remarked discontentedly. "I can't see why you don't stand aside and make room
for an impoverished member of the family. You don't want to marry the girl
yourself."</p>
<p>Sandbrook smiled slightly. He had the air of one to whom the idea had been
presented for the first time.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I don't," he agreed. "On the other hand, there is no reason why I
shouldn't."</p>
<p>The young man considered the matter whilst he fitted a cigarette into his
long holder.</p>
<p>"I suppose not," he assented doubtfully. "At the same time, you fellows that
can afford to do it ought to stick to the type."</p>
<p>"Ought we?" Sandbrook murmured, allowing himself to be served with some
fresh coffee. "I don't know why. I am rather a stickler for race, and all that
sort of thing, but we Christian landholders are not the only aristocracy in the
country, you know, Edward. I have not seen so very much of Lady Julia&mdash;I
should want to see more before I gave a definite opinion&mdash;but she does
seem to me to have attained a definite standard of Epicureanism in life."</p>
<p>"What the mischief does that mean?" his cousin asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"Briefly, it means appreciation of the best things in art, literature,
bearing and manners."</p>
<p>"What about morals? I know she doesn't mix with the real go-hell-for-leather
set, but I have heard of her at their parties sometimes."</p>
<p>"She is a girl," Sandbrook pronounced, rising to his feet as the music
recommenced, "who would make up her own mind as to what she chose to do in
life, and what she chose would probably be right from her own standard."</p>
<p>"Well, can I have this dance with her?" Edward begged. "The Donnisthorpe
girls are looking at you all the time. You really ought to go and make yourself
agreeable there. I have just danced with Mary."</p>
<p>"Then you can dance with her again," was the uncompromising reply. "I'm
going to keep my engagement."</p>
<p>"Pig!" was his cousin's smothered expletive.</p>
<p>"This is really to be the last," Julia told him, with a sigh, as he
approached her table. "May I present you to my hostess&mdash;Mrs. Felixstowe,
and Captain Felixstowe, her nephew. You know Mrs. Armadale already, I think,
and Major Armadale."</p>
<p>Sandbrook exchanged greetings.</p>
<p>"Took a toss at polo last week," the younger man explained ruefully.
"Fortunately you were here, or I am afraid Lady Julia would have had a dull
time, so far as dancing is concerned."</p>
<p>"Sorry about the toss, but I certainly have the luck," Sandbrook remarked,
as they moved off.</p>
<p>"Where are you going after this?" Julia asked.</p>
<p>"Bed," was the prompt reply. "What sort of a night-hawk do you think I am?
Unless, of course&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Unless what?"</p>
<p>"Well, something more interesting turned up."</p>
<p>"There's an extension night at the Embassy," she told him. "Couldn't you get
rid of your very ornamental cousin and come there for an hour?"</p>
<p>"With you?"</p>
<p>"With me alone. I hate parties. I went to one or two last week and I was
never so bored in my life. I knew just which man was going to ask me to dance
and exactly when he was going to do it. I knew just what we were going to talk
about, and the whole thing was deadly. I have come to the conclusion, Martin,
that conversation, to be vital, is only possible between two persons. General
conversation is always broken into by the wrong person at the wrong moment and
diverted into the wrong channel. I don't like it, anyway. I like probing the
thoughts, trying to creep a little farther into the personality of the
companion I am interested in."</p>
<p>"Well, we sha'n't have much chance for that sort of thing at a night club,"
he reminded her.</p>
<p>"Who cares?" she murmured. "I shall be there with you. Absolute silence
would be better than the chatter I have had to listen to this evening. What
about the Embassy?"</p>
<p>"Let's go there, by all means," he assented. "Where shall I find you?"</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed their content.</p>
<p>"You will see us get up," she said. "Send your car away. We will take mine.
And perhaps you had better tell the ornamental cousin we'll have our dance next
time we meet."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>The ornamental cousin took the affair badly.</p>
<p>"I don't see why you want to choke a fellow off in this way, Martin," he
protested. "You know very well you wouldn't think of marrying the girl
yourself. That sort of marriage isn't necessary for you. It is for me. Besides,
she attracts me. You're not a woman's man, you know, old chap, but believe me,
that girl has something about her&mdash;can't describe it, but if only she were
not the daughter of old Marsom, she might turn the head of anyone in
Europe."</p>
<p>"I'll look out for it this evening," Sandbrook promised him. "I'm not sure
that I have not discovered a trace of it myself," he added, signing the
bill.</p>
<p>"It isn't as though she went about a great deal," Lord Edward continued
gloomily, as he lit a fresh cigarette and leaned back in his place. "I should
say I'd been to pretty well every party in town this last week and she wasn't
at one of them."</p>
<p>"You'll come across her some time," Sandbrook assured him, rising to his
feet. "Stay on here if you like, but I have to go...."</p>
<p>Julia was already fastening her ermine cape when Sandbrook reached the exit.
They passed out together and entered her car, which was drawn up by the kerb.
She glanced for a moment into the mirror as they drove off, then extinguished
the interior light and took his hand.</p>
<p>"Be sweet to me, please," she begged. "I adore even your simulated
affection. You have all the reserves I love."</p>
<p>"Hope I live up to my reputation," he laughed, drawing her head down on his
shoulder. "As a matter of fact, I don't go in for this sort of thing at all,
you know, and I'm not sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear," she interrupted, "why worry your brain as to being sure about
anything. I left that off long ago. I do what pleases me. I suppose I ought to
be thankful that my tastes are what they are. I do not claim to be in the least
different from other girls, but there is this about me&mdash;I loathe
promiscuous petting. I adore the touch of anyone I am fond of, especially when
there is just that delightful instinct of reverence about it&mdash;makes one
feel somehow a sort of priestess of the affections."</p>
<p>"That's all very well," he smiled, "but that probably comes from
inexperience. I might break down at any moment."</p>
<p>"If you break down," she said dreamily, "it would probably be in just the
one way in the world, and it would mean everything. But you won't, and I adore
you as you are."</p>
<p>"I don't mind telling you," he confided, a few minutes later, as they
continued their slow progress, "that I was glad to hear about your house party
at Weatherlees. You gave me rather a shock at first."</p>
<p>"If I did," she said, "it was your stupidity, or shall we call it
inexperience? To descend to the vernacular, you ought to know really that I am
not that sort of girl."</p>
<p>"I had that idea," he admitted frankly, "but you do seem a little reckless
sometimes."</p>
<p>"I may be&mdash;I often am," she confessed. "Sometimes I have tried to work
myself up to standing on the brink of the last ditch. I couldn't even reach the
ditch. You see, I think fineness of taste has so much to do with it. I think I
have good taste. Don't you, Martin?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure you have," he told her.</p>
<p>"Sorbonnier, the great critic, dined with Father one night a few months ago.
He examined my books&mdash;French and English. He made me talk about the
pictures. He took me to galleries. We went to several of the plays. You know
that he is really the greatest international critic we have. Before he left, he
paid me a great compliment. He told me that he had never met anyone before
whose taste was unerring, who was a real undraped hedonist, and he asked me to
marry him.... We are in the park now, Martin. Do kiss me, please...."</p>
<p>He drew away from her a little breathless. She looked into his face and
laughed at the things which he was trying to conceal.</p>
<p>"My dear," she whispered, "how happy you are making me. Will you tell him to
drive to the Embassy now?"</p>
<p>"I thought we were on the way there," he answered, rubbing the
windowpane.</p>
<p>"We have been going around the park," she told him. "It is the first time I
have ever given such an order. The chauffeur is probably thinking that I am
crazy. Though, why should he? Everyone's turn for craziness arrives. Now I am
going to drink a glass of champagne and waltz with you. Life is very good."</p>
<hr>
<p>The Embassy was very full but exactly the corner table they desired was
there for Julia and her companion. They started dancing almost at once. They
were known to most of the crowd there and whispers went freely around. Edward
Vannerley, with his little lady from the Shaftesbury, scowled at his cousin
from the dancing floor.</p>
<p>"There's your cousin again," Julia pointed out. "I don't think he likes us
very much."</p>
<p>"I am the only one who is in his bad books," Sandbrook replied. "He wanted
me to give up my dance with you."</p>
<p>She laughed quietly.</p>
<p>"I knew you would not do that," she said. "I am just beginning to feel sure
enough of you for that. A pleasant youth, I should think. But why so
unintelligent?"</p>
<p>"He's a very good fellow, really," Sandbrook declared.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what's the good of being a good fellow," she argued, "if you have
no brains? Look at his mouth&mdash;his forehead. Charming, aristocratic
perhaps, but brainless. I should think that to live with him for a month would
drive any woman crazy."</p>
<p>"You know the old saying," Sandbrook reminded her. "The second son of a Duke
never has brains. The eldest&mdash;possibly. Never the second. It is God's evil
dispensation, perhaps, as the poor fellow generally has to earn his own living.
Not that Edward is so badly off."</p>
<p>The music changed. Julia listened to the rhythm and disapproved.</p>
<p>"We will sit down for a few moments," she insisted. "Our little corner there
is almost impregnable. I have a terrible idea that your cousin means to descend
upon us and bring that flipperty little creature with the baby eyes. I could
not bear it to-night. I can see her trying them on you. Are you susceptible to
baby eyes, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," he answered, "but we won't risk it."</p>
<p>They returned to the safety of their retired corner. The music became
louder, the room more crowded, the drifting perfumes from the women and flowers
more exotic. In the midst of it all they talked seriously. Whatever effect
their surroundings had had upon their senses, their brains still seemed
dominant.</p>
<p>"I have spent three quarters of the time since the War," Sandbrook observed,
<i>&agrave; propos</i> of a remark of hers, "travelling. The aftermath of the War in
England and civilised places was like a bad taste in my mouth. That's why I am
so ignorant. I want to understand a little more. You trusted me alone with you
down at Weatherlees. You turned out the light of your car this evening and
encouraged me to kiss you. When I was a lad, those things meant one thing, and
one thing only, between such as you and me. They meant marriage. Don't you ever
think of marriage? Don't you ever consider it when you give so many of the
things which belong to it?"</p>
<p>She deliberated for some time. His question seemed so vital. Her reply might
mean so much.</p>
<p>"Not with you," she answered.</p>
<p>He fingered the stem of his wineglass for a moment in perplexed silence.</p>
<p>"That may be a judicial answer," he decided, "but somehow or other, it does
not seem to carry all the way."</p>
<p>"It will sound banal if I explain," she said, "but have it your own way. If
I had taken anyone else to Weatherlees, and said to him what I said to you, the
question of marriage would have been inevitable. If I had driven anyone else
around the park, instead of coming directly here, and turned out the light and
asked for caresses, the thoughts of marriage would have been there. If I had
advertised myself alone with any other man, as I have done with you to-night,
and set a hundred gossiping lips chattering, the thought of marriage would have
been present. Because, after all, like most others in the world, I am a
self-seeker. But with you it is different. From you I ask frankly for what I
want and you give it to me."</p>
<p>"You mean, then, as a suitor I should fail?"</p>
<p>"I have not said so," she answered. "What I say is that I do not expect
marriage from you. I am content to give and ask for no return. On
consideration, that should make you very proud."</p>
<p>He considered the matter carefully. The floor was emptier now, the music
softer and more melodious, the scent of the room more overpowering.</p>
<p>"Supposing we dance," he suggested.</p>
<p>She drew on her gloves, finished her champagne and suffered herself to be
led to the floor.</p>
<p>"I obey," she murmured, "my lord and master."</p>
<hr>
<p>They drove home in the grey and somewhat fantastic dawning, with heavy
clouds hanging low from the skies. There were black pools of darkness in hidden
corners, where the lights had been extinguished, but which the coming day had
failed to reach. There was a slanting drizzle of rain, the promise of wind
moving away across the open country. Julia lay like a tired child, her arm
around his neck; her tumbled gown was like a beautiful shield to her graceful
body, doubled up now in an effortless tranquillity. The faintest of smiles
played about her lips&mdash;an almost virginal note in her repose stirred him
to draw her a little more closely into his arms. He had almost to wake her when
they drew up in front of her house, before which a seemingly unconscious
servant stood waiting upon the pavement.</p>
<p>"Julia," he said, "before you go&mdash;you must go, you know; the lights are
all flaring up in your hall&mdash;may I ask you a question?"</p>
<p>She sat up, clutched her wrap around her, and it seemed to him that she was
shivering. There was a flame in her eyes, though, which spoke of other
things.</p>
<p>"Not now, Martin," she begged. "Some day ask it me, if you will, but not
now."</p>
<p>She suddenly kissed him&mdash;kissed him upon the lips&mdash;and a moment
later, without waiting for his help, without a farewell word, she was gone, a
gleam of white across the pavement, almost invisible under the sheltering
umbrella. The car drove off to Hill Street.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Ciro's downstairs bar, which had been the scene of the downfall of Mr. Joe
Somerville, was popular at cocktail time, even with many who were not lunching
or dining on the premises. It was a favourite haunt of Lord Edward Vannerley's,
and one morning, not long after his dinner with his cousin at Quaglino's, in a
very smart brown suit, beautifully polished tan shoes, a bunch of violets in
his buttonhole, and his bowler hat precisely at the angle affected by the
bloods of the moment, he was seated upon a stool enjoying, in the leisurely
fashion of an epicure, an excellent dry Martini. An acquaintance who had just
come in, a man of youthful appearance, fair and with closely clipped moustache,
who carried himself like a soldier and might have resembled one, but for his
narrow eyes and his hard, unpleasant-looking mouth, touched him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Have a drink with me, Lord Edward," he invited.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, I'm honoured," was the astonished reply. "To the best of my
belief, this is the first time I have ever heard you offer a drink to
anyone!"</p>
<p>There was a faint grin from the barman and the habitu&eacute;s who were
lounging round. Mr. Leopold Klein was certainly not noted for his hospitality
and was quite used to being chaffed upon the subject.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, I want something from you," the latter admitted, "or I
should not be so generous. Come and sit down for a minute."</p>
<p>The two men took possession of chairs in the background, where their
cocktails were presently served. Klein tapped a cigarette upon his case and lit
it. Vannerley followed his example.</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook is a cousin of yours, isn't he?" the former asked.</p>
<p>"That's so," was the cautious reply. "He wouldn't be the slightest use to
you, if that's what you're aiming at. He's rolling in money. Father and mother
both died within the last twelve months and the mother left him over a
million."</p>
<p>"I was not thinking of him from a business point of view exactly," Klein
confided. "There was another matter I had in my mind."</p>
<p>"I am afraid," Vannerley explained, "that he would not be of any use any
other way. He is a cut above us fellows, who waste our time knocking about
town. Rather on the serious side, although he is very fond of sport and travel.
We're cousins, right enough, but I see scarcely anything of him."</p>
<p>"His father was a director of this wonderful Woolito Company?"</p>
<p>"That's right," Lord Edward agreed vaguely. "I have heard him speak of
it."</p>
<p>"There have been rumours in the City," the other continued, "although it has
not, as yet, been officially announced, that the present Sandbrook is taking
his late father's place on the board."</p>
<p>Vannerley nodded in noncommittal fashion. He had not yet made up his mind
what his acquaintance was driving at.</p>
<p>"I was wondering if, by any chance," the latter suggested, "you had ever
heard Lord Sandbrook talk about any of the other directors."</p>
<p>"I think I have heard him mention the names of one or two," the young man
admitted. "I've not taken any particular notice, though."</p>
<p>"There's a chap named Mayden-Harte."</p>
<p>"Could anyone forget a fellow with a name like that?"</p>
<p>"Rather young for the job and a bachelor," Klein continued. "I suppose, as
he's a director of the Woolito Company, he must have plenty of money?"</p>
<p>"I know no more about that than the man in the moon," Lord Edward confessed.
"One would think so. The Woolito Company is supposed to stink of money."</p>
<p>Klein scratched his chin:</p>
<p>"Just so," he acquiesced. "But you see, it's like this&mdash;the whole world
knows that Lord Marsom, the chairman, is a great autocrat. He rules his
directors and his whole staff with a rod of iron. Hates gambling too, doesn't
he?"</p>
<p>"Never heard a thing about him," Vannerley acknowledged blandly.</p>
<p>"Well, you can take it from me that he does, then," Klein went on. "Now,
listen, old chap. I want you to help me with a problem I'm up against. You can
quite understand, can't you, that a young single man who had commercial gifts
might be a director of the Woolito Company without having an enormous amount of
stuff behind him?"</p>
<p>"Quite so," Vannerley agreed. "He might have been promoted from the
staff."</p>
<p>"You can also understand," Klein proceeded, "that if he did anything Marsom
didn't like, out he would go like a comet."</p>
<p>"That's natural enough."</p>
<p>Klein sipped his cocktail in silence.</p>
<p>"Of course, this fellow Mayden-Harte may have plenty of money of his own,"
he admitted.</p>
<p>"I bet you know a lot more about him than I do," Vannerley observed.</p>
<p>There was a crafty gleam in Klein's eyes.</p>
<p>"Your cousin might know more than either of us," he suggested.</p>
<p>"So that's what you are driving at, is it?" his companion laughed. "I
shouldn't think it probable, but if he does happen to know anything about the
fellow, I can find out for you, if you're really interested. It just happens
that I have a standing invitation to drop in for a cocktail in the evening and,
if you like, I'll stop at Hill Street to-night and see if I can pick up
anything."</p>
<p>"If you would do that for me, old chap," was the grateful response, "I would
take it very kindly from you."</p>
<p>"I can guess why you're interested, of course," Vannerley reflected, "but
I'm hanged if I can see why a young unmarried fellow, who is a director of
Woolito's, should need to borrow money."</p>
<p>Klein slapped him on the back and rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Doing anything after dinner to-night?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Meet me here at twelve o'clock," Klein invited. "Bring me any information
Lord Sandbrook may have about Mayden-Harte and I will give you a <i>quid pro
quo</i>."</p>
<p>"It's a deal," Vannerley promised.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edward Vannerley whistled softly to himself as the taxicab in which he and
Klein were seated pulled up, shortly before one o'clock, in front of one of the
most imposing mansions in Belgrave Square.</p>
<p>"Now," he murmured, "I begin to understand."</p>
<p>"You have heard of the place, then?" Klein enquired, a little uneasily. "I
would have sworn that there were not half a dozen people in London, outside the
habitu&eacute;s, who knew about it."</p>
<p>"It happens that I do," Vannerley confessed, "but you needn't worry about
that. I heard it in an odd sort of way and I was sworn to secrecy. I have never
breathed a word to anyone."</p>
<p>They paid off the taxi. In the hall, which was lit in the modern fashion and
beautifully decorated, as if for a reception, they were met by an elderly man
who appeared to be a sort of major-domo. At a sign from him, a footman hurried
forward to take their coats and hats. There were other servants in the hall,
apparently doing nothing, but obviously on the watch, and while they loitered
about for a minute, a couple of well-known society women and a sporting peer
passed them and climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>"Your friend, Lord Edward Vannerley, will be the guest of the management
to-night, Mr. Klein," the major-domo said obsequiously. "Afterwards, if he
cares to join, the fee will be one hundred guineas until the end of the year.
You will find a very pleasant party upstairs, Mr. Klein. His Grace has been
playing and has just won a banco of seventeen thousand pounds."</p>
<p>They made their way up to the first floor. A young man of agreeable
appearance, who appeared to be doing nothing in particular, met them on the
landing.</p>
<p>"I must introduce myself," he said pleasantly, "to such a distinguished
visitor as Lord Edward Vannerley. I am Major Markham&mdash;Mr. Van Wildte's
private secretary."</p>
<p>The two men shook hands. The Major escorted them to the door of what must
have been several large rooms made into one. There were two <i>chemin de fer</i>
tables, both of which were thronged with players. In the far distance one
caught a glimpse of a supper restaurant with small tables, and set gracefully
back in a corner of the room was a very attractive-looking bar. Edward
Vannerley, who rather flattered himself upon being a man about town, could
scarcely conceal his surprise.</p>
<p>"I hope Mr. Klein will give you a pleasant evening," Major Markham
continued, smiling. "You will find the supper room beyond and they say that our
cocktails are nearly the best in London, if you care to visit the bar."</p>
<p>"Before you go, Major," Vannerley begged, "tell me how on earth you manage,
in the heart of London, to keep an establishment like this going?"</p>
<p>The secretary shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth," he confessed, "the place is rather a hobby of Mr.
Van Wildte's. He likes the sporting chance of it. He gets a good deal of
publicity as a popular American, who gives wonderful parties and, so far, the
police have never been near us. If ever they do pay us a visit, well&mdash;then
we shall all be in trouble," he concluded, with a nod of farewell.</p>
<p>"Let me take this in," Vannerley meditated, dropping into an easy chair. "I
have to pinch myself to realise that I am alive. Why, it's exactly like the
Sporting Club at Monte Carlo, in the height of the season, and a great many of
the same faces too!"</p>
<p>"It's the biggest thing that's ever been done in London in the gambling
line," Klein confided. "Naturally, they're very particular about whom they let
in. I had to go round and see the secretary about you. There are no cards of
membership or that sort of thing. A stranger simply never gets beyond the hall
downstairs. They ask for his card of invitation and treat him like a gate
crasher. That's the only reason I can imagine that the place has not been
raided. The police can't go blundering in everywhere, unless they have a
complaint, and the people who come here&mdash;even those who lose their
money&mdash;love the place too well to gossip about it. I suppose some day a
wrong 'un will lose a few thousands and pay a visit to Scotland Yard. Until
that happens, I should put the profit down at about fifteen thousand a
week."</p>
<p>"Is it baccarat or <i>chemie</i>?" Vannerley enquired.</p>
<p>"<i>Chemie</i>. Baccarat Sunday nights only, and an amateur bank then, when
possible. They have professional croupiers for the <i>chemie</i>, of course."</p>
<p>"Is the game straight?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Klein assured his companion. "Straight as a die. They let you
know what they are going to do to you before they start. There's a double
<i>cagnotte</i> and small players are not welcome. They like the bank started with
twenty pounds at least.... There's our man&mdash;with the Baroness too. Sworn
off for a month, he told me, and yet there he sits, the second from the
croupier, next to the woman with the flaxen hair parted in the middle."</p>
<p>Vannerley looked curiously across the table. Mr. Mayden-Harte, at that
moment, had more the appearance of a professional gambler than an earnest man
of affairs and director of the great company of Woolito. His long, thin face
was wrinkled and anxious. He kept fumbling at his straggling, light moustache
and handling the pile of chips in front of him nervously. The lady by his side,
with an impatient little gesture, took ten of them away and pushed them out in
front of him. This was apparently the largest bet, for the man who was running
the bank gave Mayden-Harte the cards. He took one and threw down on the table
with an air of triumph a ten, a five and a three. The banker disclosed a ten
and a three, and took one card&mdash;a six. There was a ripple of excitement
around the table. The croupier scraped in the money. Mayden-Harte, with a
futile attempt at indifference, watched his little pile swept away.</p>
<p>"Another two hundred gone," Klein murmured. "Those are twenty-pound
counters. Two hundred pounds she made him put up. The Baroness is a charming
lady, but I sometimes wonder whether she is not a very good friend of the
management here. What about a drink over at the bar and a chat? You have seen
your man and you can judge for yourself the sort of game he plays. It doesn't
take long to get rid of a spot of money that way!"</p>
<p>They found a comfortable corner some distance from the tables. Both ordered
whisky and soda and Vannerley lit a cigar.</p>
<p>"And they pretend," the latter remarked, leaning back, "any pal you talk to
about playing these games in London&mdash;they pretend that they do it for a
bit of a spree! I never saw Mayden-Harte before, but he looks to me like a Wall
Street bull who has lost his nerve on a falling market!"</p>
<p>"Without a doubt," Klein agreed, "there are a good many young
fellows&mdash;and older ones too, for that matter&mdash;who do come here, in
the first instance, for what they call a spree. Mayden-Harte is not one of
them, though. He has lost too much money, for one thing. Just now, as it
happens, he is in a hell of a mess."</p>
<p>"What on earth can your interest in him be?" Lord Edward queried, adjusting
his eyeglass and looking at the money-lender curiously. "The fellow may be a
fool but, as my cousin Martin pointed out to me, he is not likely to risk more
than he can afford to lose."</p>
<p>Klein's fingers played with his closely clipped moustache. The situation was
not entirely clear to him.</p>
<p>"You think so?" he observed. "Very well, then, I will lay my cards upon the
table. Mayden-Harte owes me eighteen thousand, nine hundred pounds and an
acceptance of his for two thousand pounds, due yesterday, which he wanted me to
renew. I didn't feel inclined to, without further security, so I passed it
through the bank. It was returned dishonoured this morning."</p>
<p>"Stamped by the bank?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. If a man doesn't meet his engagements and I don't feel inclined
to renew, I present the bill, even though I know it can't be paid. A
dishonoured acceptance is one of the easiest things to sue on. I am very much
afraid that I am going to make a bad debt with Mr. Mayden-Harte. He owes me not
only the amount I have spoken of, but he has backed bills for the Baroness to
rather a large amount."</p>
<p>"The little flaxen-haired filly?"</p>
<p>"You keep away from her," Klein advised. "She's just as hard about this sort
of thing as I am myself, and that's saying something. It's business with me and
it's business with her. Now," he went on, summoning a waiter and ordering two
more whiskies and sodas, "I have shown you exactly why I wanted to know how
this fellow, Mayden-Harte, stands financially. What about it? Was your cousin
able to tell you anything?"</p>
<p>Vannerley shook his head.</p>
<p>"I couldn't get him interested at all," he said. "The sound of the fellow's
name even seemed to bore him. As to his means, all he could tell me was that it
didn't take money to be a director of Woolito, Limited. The old man loves
taking his head men out of the staff or promoting one of the managers. He even
wanted to put Martin on, without waiting for him to qualify with shares."</p>
<p>"Let's have it plain," Klein persisted. "I take it that a fellow director of
Woolito is utterly ignorant of Mayden-Harte's means and believes it possible
for him to occupy his present position without any sound financial
standing?"</p>
<p>Lord Edward grabbed the whisky and soda which had just been brought.</p>
<p>"Always clear-headed, my dear Klein," he agreed. "The words you have spoken
are words of wisdom. You make piles of money out of most of the saps who come
your way, but I should be inclined to think&mdash;yes, I should be inclined to
believe&mdash;that so far as Mayden-Harte is concerned, you have got hold of a
wrong 'un."</p>
<p>Klein's face was not an agreeable sight. He had drawn in his lips, his eyes
were cold and angry.</p>
<p>"Then Mr. Mayden-Harte," he said, "will have to pay for some of the lies he
has told me."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>On the night following the initiation of Lord Edward Vannerley into the
gambling club at Belgrave Square there was a gorgeous but a solemn dinner of
three in the Park Lane mansion of Lord Marsom. Mr. Thomas Moody was a man
unused to the social amenities of life and he had obeyed the summons of his
chief in suffering and with distaste. His seldom-used dress suit was creased
and ill fitting. The trousers were too short and the tails too long. No one had
ever thought to tell him that woollen socks without garters were not <i>de
rigueur</i> for evening wear, nor had there been anyone to point out to him that a
black tie and a swallow-tailed coat were not usually associated. Nevertheless,
having a clear conscience so far as his host was concerned, he was at least as
much at his ease as his fellow guest. Mayden-Harte from the first had dreaded
this summons. Once a year the whole Board of Directors had been accustomed to
receive a similar one, but under present circumstances there seemed a certain
mockery in the invitation, something hard to define, which hung like a cold
shadow over the splendours of the table. In the presence of the servants, of
whom there were never less than four, conversation jogged along the
well-trodden roads&mdash;politics, a new chemical discovery which it might be
well to look into, the health of a prominent statesman. As soon as the dessert
had been placed upon the table, however, Lord Marsom ordered the port to be set
in front of him and dismissed his servitors with a wave of the hand. He leaned
towards his two guests.</p>
<p>"Mayden-Harte and Moody," he said, "I wanted a word with you in a different
atmosphere to that of Basinghall Street or the works. That is why I asked you
to come here to-night. I do not need to speak of the tragedies which one by one
have broken up our confederation. You know what has happened to the other
fellows. There are only we three left and Lord Sandbrook, who has joined us too
recently to enter into the matter, who are still sound of wind and limb. I ask
myself whether there is anything we can do to protect ourselves against the
unexpected."</p>
<p>Both men listened&mdash;Mayden-Harte with rapt and nervous interest, Moody
with a curious sort of detached fatalism.</p>
<p>"It seems that all these other men," Marsom continued, "had a secret chapter
in their lives which was rudely broken into. Are either of you two in the same
position? Are either of you two in trouble? Do you need help? Is there anyone
working behind the scenes who might bring disaster of any sort into your
lives?"</p>
<p>Moody's full red lips curled outwards scornfully.</p>
<p>"Outside the laboratory," he confided, "I could not be said to have a life
at all. For seven years I have not been to a place of entertainment, made a new
friend or talked after business hours to anyone, except my landlord and his
wife. Anything sinister which I may feel in the present atmosphere is not
personal."</p>
<p>"And what about you, Mayden-Harte?" Marsom asked.</p>
<p>The young man was scarcely in a position to reply with such confidence.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, Lord Marsom," he answered hesitatingly. "I won't
pretend that I have not altered the standards of my life a little since I came
up to town, but I don't see that there is anything that looks like troubling me
particularly. I live a different sort of life than Moody, of course. I go out
into the world more and I meet more people."</p>
<p>"You are not in any sort of financial trouble?"</p>
<p>But for the glitter in those strange eyes of his host, Mayden-Harte might
have told, if not the truth, some part of it. As it was, he only faltered ever
so slightly.</p>
<p>"Certainly not," he declared. "I draw between six and seven thousand a year
and that is quite enough for my requirements."</p>
<p>"Married?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Mistress?"</p>
<p>"Nothing permanent," the young man replied, with a slight flush.</p>
<p>"Understand," Marsom continued contemptuously, "your private lives do not
interest me a snap of the fingers, except for their possible bearing upon this
bloody business. Half these troubles come of women. You can keep a harem if you
want to, for all I care. What I want to know is this&mdash;you are not either
of you living under the shadow of any threats of any sort?"</p>
<p>"So far as I am concerned," Mayden-Harte said, "I can answer
definitely&mdash;certainly not."</p>
<p>Moody's face was untroubled, but if anyone could have seen the eyes behind
those thick spectacles, they might have detected the spectre of a lurking fear,
more speculative than actual.</p>
<p>"With me," he said, "there exists nothing but that one vague and rarely
realised apprehension known already to you, Lord Marsom. Every time I speak of
it, you scoff at it. You are probably right. It is not I even who am
threatened."</p>
<p>"Still got that bee in your bonnet?" Marsom sneered.</p>
<p>"What is he talking about?" Mayden-Harte asked.</p>
<p>"There was a man who died in Nottingham, who knew more about the secrets of
our business than was good for one man to know," Lord Marsom said grimly. "He
appears to have an idiot relative alive&mdash;a lunatic. I leave nothing to
chance. Every year he is visited by a doctor. Every year the report is the
same&mdash;the man's reason is hopelessly and entirely gone. What harm can such
a person do us?"</p>
<p>Moody wiped his lips hard with his napkin.</p>
<p>"No one can do us any harm," he agreed. "I have no reasonable reply to your
question. On those rare occasions when fear comes to me, it is more the fear
that I, too, may be losing my senses."</p>
<p>Marsom passed the port and helped himself.</p>
<p>"I am only interested in real dangers," he said. "A lunatic weaver does not
trouble me. One more glass, gentlemen, and I will excuse you. I have to be at
the Prime Minister's at eleven and you, too, probably have your own
engagements."</p>
<hr>
<p>It chanced that that particular evening was one of the more brilliant which
the habitu&eacute;s of Number 17a, Belgrave Square ever remembered. From
midnight until two o'clock in the morning taxicabs and motor-cars had been
setting down distinguished passengers and, according to the strict law of the
place, making swift departure to a neighbouring garage. Very-near Royalty had
been present, with a brilliant little company, and had departed, highly pleased
with some insignificant winnings. Two Indian princes were still playing with
inscrutable faces, notwithstanding the fact that they had both lost large sums.
The regular client&egrave;le, too, were present in force, a motley crowd of
titled paupers and notorious millionaires, bookmakers&mdash;the modern type, of
course, noticeable only on account of their perfectly tailored clothes and the
flawless etceteras of their toilet&mdash;stockbrokers and mysterious
capitalists. Mayden-Harte was there in his usual place, by the side of the
Baroness, a little unnerved by his very sombre dinner party with its menacing
suggestions.</p>
<p>"I really don't know that I wish to play this evening, Elsa," he announced.
"I have had a very disagreeable evening with my chief. If he had any idea that
I went in for this sort of thing," he added in a whisper, "affairs would go
badly with me."</p>
<p>She leaned back and laughed at him mockingly.</p>
<p>"You are stupid," she exclaimed. "You should be afraid of nothing. You have
lost money. What does it matter? You must get it back. The game goes like that,
you see&mdash;up and down. I, with my small stakes, have found that out. To
leave when you have lost&mdash;that is folly. Give Monsieur Mayden-Harte two
thousand pounds' worth of chips," she added, turning to the croupier.</p>
<p>"Too many," Mayden-Harte protested. "I don't wish to gamble. Five hundred
pounds will be enough."</p>
<p>She laughed. Perhaps the touch of her fingers upon his hand had its effect.
At any rate, the croupier was deaf to his objection and two thousand pounds, in
hundred-pound, fifty-pound and twenty-pound chips were neatly arranged in front
of him. He signed the chit with trembling fingers.</p>
<p>"Now have courage, my friend," his companion begged. "Play as though you
meant to win&mdash;not as though you feared to lose."</p>
<p>A valet was passing along, with glasses of champagne. The Baroness leaned
back and took one for herself and one for her companion.</p>
<p>"Now," she went on, "you must have luck. I bring it to you myself."</p>
<p>Mayden-Harte drained the contents of the glass and temporarily forgot his
good resolutions. He won several small bancos, ran his own bank three times and
drew it in. The Baroness pouted.</p>
<p>"You should have gone on," she complained. "To-night the luck is with you.
Was I not your partner as usual?"</p>
<p>"You were not," he replied, with for him unexpected firmness. "There's one
hundred."</p>
<p>The Baroness accepted the chip discontentedly. The game proceeded. The bank
passed on until it reached one of the two young Indians who frequented the
place&mdash;a Rajah of boundless wealth.</p>
<p>"He always loses," the Baroness whispered. "He told me he was going to
gamble to-night. Wait till you have a chance."</p>
<p>The Rajah started with a five-hundred-pound bank. Contrary to expectation,
he won, and won again. The critical third time arrived. The people at the other
end of the table became unexpectedly cautious. The Rajah's enquiring glance
reached Mayden-Harte.</p>
<p>"You will go banco," the Baroness insisted fiercely. "It's your chance."</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>"But it's two thousand pounds," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Banco!" called one of the onlookers.</p>
<p>Then Mayden-Harte did the rashest thing of his life.</p>
<p>"<i>Banco table</i>," he countered.</p>
<p>The young Indian bowed solemnly, threw two cards to Mayden-Harte and gave
himself two. He looked enquiringly across the table. His opponent glanced
eagerly at his cards and his heart sank. He had a king and a ten.</p>
<p>"Card," he demanded.</p>
<p>The Rajah gravely disclosed his own two and Mayden-Harte drew a breath of
relief. He was, at any rate, no worse off than his opponent, who had a queen
and a knave. He picked up the card thrown across to him. Then indeed he felt
that Nemesis had arrived. His card was an ace, making his total score
one&mdash;the lowest possible except baccarat. The Rajah followed suit and a
loud murmur went round the table. He had drawn another queen, making his score
nothing! Mayden-Harte told himself that it was incredible. It was impossible
that he should win two thousand pounds with a one, and all the time he was
telling himself so the croupier was gathering in the money and passing it
across to him. The little flutter quickly subsided and the game proceeded. The
Rajah lit a cigarette and signed an order for more chips. He was to all
appearance utterly unmoved by his ill luck. Mayden-Harte, on the contrary,
could scarcely sit still. He wiped the perspiration from his forehead and
busied himself changing some of his smaller chips for those of larger
denomination.</p>
<p>"And my share?" his companion whispered softly. "I made you do that."</p>
<p>"I'll talk to you presently," he answered. "I am not feeling very well
to-night."</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders petulantly and turned away to speak to a
neighbour. Mayden-Harte pushed the whole of his chips to a chef who was
standing by.</p>
<p>"I will cash in for a time," he said. "I am playing again later."</p>
<p>The man swept the chips into a bowl.</p>
<p>"Four thousand two hundred pounds," he announced. "Monsieur will receive the
notes at the desk."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" the Baroness demanded, as her companion rose to his
feet.</p>
<p>"I am going to rest for a time," he said. "I told you I was tired. I had a
trying dinner party before I came."</p>
<p>He gave her no opportunity for argument but walked away. From that time on,
he made a perfect nuisance of himself by asking everyone in the room whether
they had seen Klein and besieging the secretary's office, asking the same
question. At a few minutes to two Klein arrived. Mayden-Harte practically tore
him away from some acquaintances and steered him into a retired corner.</p>
<p>"Klein," he exclaimed. "That acceptance of mine for two thousand
pounds?"</p>
<p>"It was returned to me dishonoured," Klein confided gravely. "I sent you
formal notice this morning."</p>
<p>"Never mind about that," was the eager reply. "I have had a wonderful stroke
of luck, and just at a critical time too. You see the dusky prince over
there&mdash;the Rajah of some place or other&mdash;worth millions, they say. He
was running a bank and&mdash;listen, Klein," his companion went on, digging his
fingers into the other's coat sleeve, "I had an inspiration! I bancoed him for
two thousand pounds and I won with a one to a baccarat! What do you think of
that, Klein? I felt cold all over. I had been doing pretty well before but I
have never had a coup like that. I want the bill, quickly. I can do the whole
two thousand and rotten expenses as well."</p>
<p>"Congratulate you, I'm sure," Klein said, without overmuch enthusiasm. "I'm
always glad to hear of anyone winning, but you don't suppose I carry
dishonoured acceptances about with me, do you?"</p>
<p>Mayden-Harte's expression was one of pained disappointment.</p>
<p>"You haven't got it," he groaned.</p>
<p>"Of course not. If I were to carry about with me all the dishonoured bills
of exchange I've had during the last few months, I should need a wallet."</p>
<p>His companion summoned a waiter.</p>
<p>"Look here," he proposed, "we'll have a whisky and soda to celebrate my
luck."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," Klein agreed.</p>
<p>"And now, old chap, do me a great favour," Mayden-Harte went on. "I can't
exactly explain to you, but there is an urgent and special reason why I want
that dishonoured acceptance. The old governor had me to dine to-night in Park
Lane and he asked me some very curious questions. I'm not at all sure someone
hasn't been giving him a hint that I've been fool enough to do a little
gambling lately. I'm going to chuck it after to-night. I can pull myself
straight again easily, within a few months, but I don't want anything on paper
going about. You've got the keys to your office. Call in there and get it for
me. I can cash in here and you can have the notes."</p>
<p>Klein shook his head.</p>
<p>"Can't be done, my dear fellow," he regretted. "I don't mind telling you
that I've made what turns out to be a damned rotten bargain. I sold the
acceptance just as it was for fifteen hundred quid."</p>
<p>Mayden-Harte stared at him in terror.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that you parted with my acceptance to someone else? Sold
it? You can't do such a thing!"</p>
<p>"Indeed I can," was the emphatic response. "You can do what you like with a
dishonoured bill. I've ten thousand pounds' worth of them I'll sell you for ten
thousand shillings, if you like."</p>
<p>"Who's got it? To whom did you sell it?"</p>
<p>"I'm not bound to tell you that, but I will," Klein replied. "I sold it to
the representative of a small but, if you ask my opinion, scoundrelly firm of
solicitors. Alexander and Company is the name, but the only partner in it is a
man named Ernest Jacobs."</p>
<p>"What the hell did he want with it?"</p>
<p>"God knows. I think he must be a sort of tout for another firm. Anyway, we
were talking about business&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You were talking about my business?" Mayden-Harte interrupted fiercely.</p>
<p>"Look here, young fellow," Klein remonstrated, "it's no use getting angry.
Perhaps I was a trifle hasty, but I didn't think that little fellow from
Alexander and Company was in earnest. I'll help you to get the bill back, if
you want it. I expect he'll be very glad to take his profit."</p>
<p>"What's his address?" Mayden-Harte demanded.</p>
<p>"I shall have to look it up in the telephone book. He is a member of Ciro's,
where you often go. I saw him there yesterday."</p>
<p>Mayden-Harte rose to summon a telephone boy. Before he could do so, Klein
also had sprung to his feet and was gripping him by the arm.</p>
<p>"What the hell is this?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>His companion swung round and looked towards the door. A stream of men of
ominous appearance directed by a uniformed inspector were taking up positions
around the <i>chemie</i> table. Klein made a backward spring. Too late. Both exits
behind the bar were already guarded by the police. Several women were
screaming. The officials were making violent protests. It was all useless.
Nemesis had arrived!</p>
<p>"By God, we're raided," Klein groaned.</p>
<hr>
<p>The fate of Mr. Mayden-Harte was summary and bitter. He had no sooner taken
his place at the desk in his director's room at Basinghall Street on the
following morning than his secretary knocked at the door. There was sympathy in
her face, for she was herself a somewhat gay young lady.</p>
<p>"His lordship would like to see you at once in his room, Mr. Mayden-Harte,"
she announced.</p>
<p>He accepted the summons with ill-assumed indifference. His compulsory
attendance at Bow Street had resulted in his being two hours late, and he was
conscious that he was by no means looking his best. Lord Marsom was writing
when he entered the room and did not look up for several moments. When he did,
there was a very strange light indeed in those curious eyes of his. He embarked
upon no ordinary form of salutation.</p>
<p>"I understand, Mayden-Harte," he began, in his harshest and most rasping
voice, "that you were arrested last night in one of those damnable, pestiferous
places&mdash;a private gambling house."</p>
<p>"It is quite true, Lord Marsom."</p>
<p>"How is it that you're not in prison?"</p>
<p>Mayden-Harte's cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>"I'm out on bail," he admitted. "It is not a criminal offence to be
discovered in a place like that. Lord Portington was there, the Marquis of
Hammersmith, Lady Joan&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I understood you to say last night, when dining at my house, that you were
not a gambler," Lord Marsom interrupted.</p>
<p>"I am not," Mayden-Harte declared. "I was there as a looker-on."</p>
<p>"I have reason to believe that you're a liar," was the brusque comment. "Can
you explain this remarkable document?"</p>
<p>Lord Marsom pushed an oblong strip of blue paper across the table with the
end of a pen, as though the touch of it were defiling. For a moment the room
went round. Mayden-Harte knew then that he was a broken man. He tried to speak,
but found it impossible. His inquisitor was immovable. He sat quite rigid,
tapping the bill with the end of the pen.</p>
<p>"That is an acceptance of mine for two thousand pounds," Mayden-Harte
admitted, in a voice which he himself did not recognise as his own. "I mistook
the date and forgot to advise it. I have the money now. I tried to take it up
last night. I signed it to oblige a friend."</p>
<p>"As I remarked before&mdash;you're a liar," Marsom repeated scornfully. "The
drawer of the bill is a money-lender who seems to do most of his business in a
gambling hell. Get your coat and hat, Mr. Mayden-Harte, and be very sure that
you are outside this place within five minutes. Any financial settlement
necessary will be made from the cashier's office. To hell with you,
Mayden-Harte! I am an angry man, and when I am angry I am dangerous."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom had risen to his feet. His lips had slipped sideways and his
teeth were flashing. There was an ugly light in his eyes, a stain of colour in
his cheeks, veins standing out upon the clenched fist, which smote his
beautiful writing table such a blow that papers, inkpots and inkstands all
rattled and shook together. Mr. Mayden-Harte had just so much discretion
mingled with his folly that he turned and fled.</p>
<hr>
<p>Behind him, Marsom, his face convulsed with fury, his angry fingers
trembling with passion, was tearing into small pieces the card which he had
found pinned to the reverse side of the bill and on which were six words
beautifully engraved:</p>
<blockquote>ANOTHER WOOLITO DIRECTOR LOOKING FOR TROUBLE?</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>Marsom, like most of the cultivated men of his race, was a man of taste. He
was dining alone, a few nights later, in Park Lane, but the fact that he had no
guest interfered in no manner with the strictly disciplined r&eacute;gime of
the service. A small dining table, a bijou counterpart of the one which stood
in the middle of the room and which held sixty, had been drawn into the
sweeping bay window, from which little flushes of the April twilight were
faintly visible. The subdued roar of the world changing from its work-a-day
life to play-time was like music in his ears. He loved action. Silence of any
sort was unendurable to him. The silence of death was the one terrible
apprehension which he refused to face....</p>
<p>The flowers on his table were crystal white lilies&mdash;pink under the
shaded lamp. A freshly gathered bunch of his favourite violets, with the
evening dew still upon them, rushed up from his private farm in the country,
rested on the table by his side. He ate sparely but everything was choicely
selected. He had toyed with a little smoked Volga salmon and sipped a glass of
vodka. He had drunk a half cup of turtle soup&mdash;somewhat too rich for his
taste&mdash;and he was waiting at the moment for the plainly grilled sole which
was to precede his quail. The deeply graven lines, which marked the hardness of
his day of battle, had passed from his face. Other men, giants in commerce or
literature, might have been pitied that they should have had to spend the last
few hours of the day alone, even in a solitude which had in it something of the
magnificent. Marsom himself found something strengthening in his detachment.
They had fallen back into their places in his scheme of life, those with whom
he had dealt through the hours of the day. His hand had been lifted from the
controlling lever of the great affairs which he had directed, only at the call
of nature herself. It chanced that the evening papers were full of the harsh
doings of a self-appointed political dictator who had driven his cabinet
council back to the obscurity of their homes, leaving him to reign alone. It
was very much what he himself was doing. That day he had launched a great
advertising scheme on much sounder lines than would ever have occurred to Sir
Alfred Honeyman. He had bought yarn upon seven European and English markets at
a lower price than ever before. He had organised a new batch of agents, with
some slight aid&mdash;he was generous enough to admit&mdash;from Sandbrook,
whose knowledge of the East and the various necessary languages had been
invaluable. He had had hourly telephone reports from every one of his factories
and in no single case was there any slackening in the output. All that a board
of directors could have done he had done a little better himself. There had
been one slight disappointment, perhaps. He brushed that away as he would have
pushed down into oblivion the vanishing end of a disturbing dream.</p>
<p>The lights at the other end of the room had been left unlit and she came to
him simply enough, without haste, perhaps even without any consciousness of the
effect which her appearance was likely to have. She was wearing one of the
plainest black gowns the artist dressmaker had been able to produce, but she
had conceded a small black cape which hung over her shoulders, and her fragment
of a hat, with its few inches of veil, was another tribute to the usual. The
servant from behind Marsom's place moved uncertainly forward. The butler, who
was just arriving with the sole, showed as much surprise as his curiously set
features were capable of displaying. Marsom looked with steady eyes at the
approaching figure but made no motion to rise. She, on the other hand, appeared
utterly unperturbed, as though her coming were the most usual thing in the
world.</p>
<p>"So you came, after all," he said, a little gruffly. "I have finished the
better half of the dinner. You know that I never wait for anyone."</p>
<p>"I shall take the fag end of anything you choose to give me," she said,
smiling. "I shall only venture to remind you that if I am late it is because I
have been working in your service."</p>
<p>He motioned with his head&mdash;an imperious gesture&mdash;and one of the
high-backed Chippendale chairs was placed by his side. Cutlery and glass seemed
to appear as though by magic.</p>
<p>"I have had smoked salmon and turtle soup," he announced. "I recommend the
Volga salmon and a glass of vodka. Sole and quail to come."</p>
<p>"I can't resist the smoked salmon," she observed. "I happen to know how it
comes to you. No vodka, please."</p>
<p>"A dry cocktail?" the butler suggested, almost under his breath.</p>
<p>She had the tact to refuse. She knew how her host, who collected his wines
with the same care as his pictures, felt about any sort of mixed
ap&eacute;ritif.</p>
<p>"A glass of sherry, if I may," she begged. "What a miraculous blending of
lights! I think, after all, Fouquois must be an artist."</p>
<p>"It was a greater hand than Fouquois' who painted that line of sky," Marsom
replied, pointing through the window. "Man's accident that those lights shine
out so in between the trees of the Park just before the dusk. You are right,
though. It is a study of lighting. Some of the earlier Dutch painters would
have made good work of it. Have you changed your mind, Miss Moore?"</p>
<p>"In all respects except one," she said calmly.</p>
<p>"The least important," he retorted.</p>
<p>"A man always calls it the least important," she sighed, "but he is so apt
to forget."</p>
<p>"I never forget," Marsom replied. "Likes with me are likes for eternity.
Dislike may grow into hatred, but it never retreats. Try some of that
Berncastler Doctor. Have some of your gassy stuff later if you like."</p>
<p>"You know that I don't care for champagne," she told him. "Where is Lady
Julia?"</p>
<p>"She has flown over to Paris with the Brinsteins to see the
<i>r&eacute;p&eacute;tition g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> of his new play. Coming back
in time for lunch to-morrow, I think. Sort of mad thing young people do
nowadays."</p>
<p>"I am beginning to have a theory," she confided, "a very pleasant one it is,
too. I believe that wholesale lunacy is coming upon us like a plague&mdash;like
one of the plagues from the East the hermit apostles used to threaten us with.
It would be rather an odd finish up, wouldn't it, if the whole world went
mad?"</p>
<p>"It won't," he assured her. "The brain as yet is an unfinished article. It
is when the brain gets too much crammed into it that danger threatens. There
are plenty of our greatest men who are a little mad, as it is. They are not
great enough to be real lunatics, though. I am not much of a reader myself but
this new man down in Odessa, whose stories everyone is reading&mdash;you would
not call those the production of a sane man, would you?"</p>
<p>"You work me too hard here," she sighed. "I have only read one. That was
amazing enough but there was balance in it, after all."</p>
<p>Regretfully Fouquois drew the curtains. The twilight had passed into
dusk.</p>
<p>"Coffee in my smaller study," his master ordered. "Serve some Armagnac for
me and anything the young lady fancies."</p>
<p>Marsom rose to his feet. The lamps at the other end of the room were as yet
unlit and for a moment he loomed almost terrible in his unwieldy bulk, his
sullen face with its powerful features. His eyes glittered as he stood back to
let the girl precede him&mdash;his first act of courtesy.</p>
<p>"So you meant to come all the time," he said, as he walked by her side
across the hall, his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>"I suppose I did, subconsciously," she admitted. "But I never do anything
upon conditions."</p>
<p>"You women are all the same," he sneered. "You think men only want one thing
from you. They treat those sort of affairs better in the East. If you only
knew, when it is materialised and the haze of sentimental fancies around it are
dissolved, how unimportant that thing is, you would not imagine you carried
priceless jewels about with you!"</p>
<p>She laughed gaily. Some of the savageries of his humour always appealed to
her.</p>
<p>"You really know why I came?" she asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged his great shoulders.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth," he said, "I have been wondering. Got some reason
tucked away in your head, I expect."</p>
<p>"I have come," she announced, "to talk about Woolito."</p>
<hr>
<p>They sat in two enormous easy chairs, piled with cushions, on opposite sides
of the hearthrug. At the right-hand side of each stood a little table. Upon
Marsom's was the latest edition of the evening paper, a small goblet of
Armagnac, a box of priceless cigars, a lighter and coffee. Upon hers also was
coffee, a box of cigarettes and matches. Frances, even more than her host,
seemed to be basking in the relaxation of the hour.</p>
<p>"What about Woolito?" he asked commandingly.</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment, realising that she might find him in a difficult
frame of mind.</p>
<p>"Seventeen and a half to-night, I see," she observed, lighting her
cigarette. "That is a point up."</p>
<p>"Pooh!" he exclaimed. "What does the Stock Exchange know of Woolito? The
Stock Exchange quotation is not worth looking at. We know&mdash;you and I, and
those of us who are driving the chariot. Woolito is the greatest commercial
enterprise in the world."</p>
<p>"Does it never disturb you," she enquired, "to think that the company has
enemies?"</p>
<p>He snapped his great thumb against his third finger.</p>
<p>"Not that much," he answered contemptuously.</p>
<p>She flicked the ash from her cigarette.</p>
<p>"I used to feel the same," she reflected. "Just at present, I'm not so sure.
Let me see&mdash;there were Lunt, Somerville, Bomford, Littleburn, Honeyman and
Mayden-Harte, all victims of ignoble happenings. As Superintendent Mallinson
said to me this afternoon at Scotland Yard&mdash;'Too many coincidences.'"</p>
<p>He showed his teeth at her in almost bulldog fashion.</p>
<p>"Oh-ho," he exclaimed. "So Scotland Yard is coming round, is it?"</p>
<p>"Scotland Yard is beginning to take more interest in the case," she
admitted. "Six catastrophes, one after another, all directed against members of
one firm, whose unpopularity," she added drily, "is almost a byword in the
trade, takes some explanation. Let me see, how many are there left?"</p>
<p>"You know quite well," he answered brusquely. "There's Moody, Sandbrook and
myself."</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook, I should imagine, can look after himself," she said.
"Besides, he has not been associated with the business long enough to have
become a part of it. Moody has no personality. He seems only to exist in the
abstraction of his work. There remains&mdash;you."</p>
<p>"What are you getting at?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Scotland Yard suggests," she announced, helping herself to another
cigarette, "that you allow them to provide you with a bodyguard."</p>
<p>He watched her lazy, shapely fingers groping in the cigarette box. He
followed the line of her white arm up to her face. Her expression was
unchanged, except that it was slightly more grave. She remained exactly
herself&mdash;a thoroughly efficient, capable young woman of the world.</p>
<p>"So Scotland Yard suggests that I have a bodyguard, do they?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"It is not at all an unusual thing in my country," she said. "When a big
deal is being put through between various corporations, which is against the
interests of others, the police are on the look-out all the time. I could tell
you of a dozen of our prominent men, purely commercial, who are watched day and
night when some particular deal is being put through."</p>
<p>"Bunkum," he declared.</p>
<p>She slipped a little lower into her chair. Her eyes seemed to be seeking for
pictures in the cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>"You are not afraid," she admitted. "I know that. I am not afraid myself, so
far as you are concerned, but there is the Woolito Company."</p>
<p>"Yes," he echoed. "There is the company."</p>
<p>"You are responsible for one of the greatest commercial enterprises in the
world," she reminded him. "I do not flatter. I would not dream of attempting to
flatter a man of your temperament, but there are certain facts which can never
be altered. Woolito, Limited, is heavily capitalised. There are enormous sums
sunk in property, in raw materials. Supposing that all these things that have
happened are part of a scheme for a great financial drive against the
company&mdash;not in your lifetime, I don't mean," she added, when she saw the
black storm gathering in his face, "but after your funeral."</p>
<p>"As bad as that, eh?" he laughed harshly. "So far, our friends have stopped
just short of murder."</p>
<p>"Murder may come any day," she warned him.</p>
<p>His eyes twinkled. She frowned.</p>
<p>"Courage," she continued, "can carry a man through many dangers, but it can
never stop an assassin's bullet. Look the facts in the face, Lord Marsom, as I
have done. What would happen to Woolito, Limited, if you were out of the way,
with only Mr. Moody and Lord Sandbrook down at Basinghall Street?"</p>
<p>He grinned.</p>
<p>"It would go to everlasting pot," he admitted.</p>
<p>"Then, don't you think you had better abandon your prejudice and let me
telephone to Scotland Yard?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, young woman," he said. "Woolito, Limited, means
everything in the world to me, but if I am going to be led by the nose I don't
much care what happens to it. It is the ambition of my life. I never meant it
to be my mausoleum. I will take care of myself and if they get me&mdash;well,
then, they can have the Woolito Company as well. It is the end of everything I
know or care about. Shall I leave you that pearl necklace in my will?"</p>
<p>She looked at him with rather sad eyes, in the depths of which, however, was
lurking some gleam of humour.</p>
<p>"You know so much about Woolito and so little about women!" she remarked. "I
would sooner give you what you ask for in exchange for your promise to let me
send those men down from Scotland Yard, than for a pearl necklace."</p>
<p>"So the bargaining is commencing, is it?" he jeered.</p>
<p>She looked him over reflectively and, if ever Marsom had blushed in his
life, he blushed then. She leaned across and rang the bell.</p>
<p>"I have kept my promise to Superintendent Mallinson," she said. "I have kept
my word with you. Both have been difficult. I shall now take the liberty of
giving an order in your house, which I suppose is quite wrong. Send for a taxi,
please," she directed the man who answered the bell.</p>
<p>Marsom stretched out his hand for the evening paper. He rose grudgingly to
his feet as she passed.</p>
<p>"There's a caricature of you on the back page of that paper, at the top of
our Woolito advertisement," she pointed out. "I did it myself. I think it's
rather good. You look like a little boy of naturally unpleasant disposition,
who is endeavouring to look even worse than he is. You look like that so often.
Good night, Lord Marsom."</p>
<p>He was obstinately silent, obstinately motionless, screened behind his
newspaper. It was not until he heard the taxi come and go that he crushed it
into a ball and flung it from him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>In the dusk of a particularly gloomy afternoon, about a week after the
directors' meeting, Sandbrook caught up with Mr. Thomas Moody on the pavement
of Piccadilly. He offered genial greetings and fell into step.</p>
<p>"The last of the Mohicans, eh?" he exclaimed pleasantly. "Well, I'm glad to
see that you're keeping fit."</p>
<p>Mr. Moody coughed.</p>
<p>"I don't quite&mdash;" he began, with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"Well, you're the last of the old gang of directors who hasn't met with a
spot of trouble, aren't you?" Sandbrook remarked, with a cheery smile.</p>
<p>"Well, if it comes to that, I suppose I am," his companion admitted
uneasily. "Most extraordinary ill fortune we have had in that direction."</p>
<p>"Doesn't seem to have affected the commercial prosperity of the firm."</p>
<p>Mr. Moody stopped in the middle of the pavement in order to become more
impressive.</p>
<p>"So long as Lord Marsom is alive and well," he declared, "it seems as though
nothing in the world could check us. You know, of course, how he has dealt with
the situation?"</p>
<p>"I should be very interested to hear again from you," Sandbrook confided.
"Naturally, I don't turn up in Basinghall Street every day."</p>
<p>"He has elected a few more directors for formal purposes and then completely
ignored them," Mr. Moody recounted. "He has inaugurated weekly meetings of the
heads of the departments, over which he himself presides. He listens to what
everyone has to say, comes to lightning-like decisions and he is never wrong.
Believe me, Lord Sandbrook, if our chairman, the chairman of Woolito, Limited,
were put at the head of the affairs of this country, with unlimited discretion,
England would be a first-class Power again in five years. There isn't anything
his brain can't grasp."</p>
<p>Sandbrook glanced curiously at the man by his side. The latter was dressed
in poor taste and his clothes were ill fitting. His walk lacked dignity and his
general appearance was unimpressive. His dark, straggling beard needed
trimming, as did also his greying hair. Even the umbrella which he clutched was
badly folded and shabby. He had the air of a seedy professional man who was
already on the downward path. He seemed, in this busy and fashionable
thoroughfare, a strange companion for a fastidious person like Sandbrook.</p>
<p>"What are you doing in this part of the world?" the latter asked.</p>
<p>"I am waiting upon Lord Marsom at his house in Park Lane, by appointment. I
happen to have time on my hands, so I am walking part of the way."</p>
<p>"You have never paid me a visit," Sandbrook observed. "We are close to my
house now. Will you come in and have a drink and I can send you on to Park Lane
in my car?"</p>
<p>Mr. Moody was obviously surprised at the invitation, but he did not
hesitate.</p>
<p>"I am a very small drinker," he confessed, "but it will give me great
pleasure, especially as we are now associates."</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Thomas Moody was not greatly improved in appearance by the removal of
his bowler hat and bulky overcoat. It transpired that his tie had slipped from
its position, disclosing a bone collar stud, and that his boots, seen at close
quarters, were thick and ungainly. He seemed, however, to appreciate the
comfort of an easy chair drawn up to the fire and he sipped his mild whisky and
soda with evident relish.</p>
<p>"I do not, as a rule, take alcohol until I reach home at night," he
explained. "Some of my experiments are very delicate affairs and need a steady
hand."</p>
<p>"Terribly interesting work&mdash;a chemist's," Sandbrook remarked.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas puffed at the cigarette which he had hesitatingly accepted.</p>
<p>"Yes," he admitted, "my work has always been interesting. I started life as
a toxicologist, then I gave that up for commercial work.... Yes, it's
interesting, but science, Lord Sandbrook, is a hard taskmaster. It drives you
along a narrow passage through life."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is as well, sometimes," Sandbrook reflected. "Perhaps that is
why you are the survivor of seven!"</p>
<p>"Pardon?" Mr. Moody queried.</p>
<p>"Don't you realise that you are in rather a unique position? A few months
ago you were one of seven directors of Woolito, Limited. To-day you are the
only one remaining who hasn't passed through some disastrous experience. Two
are dead, and the others are in Nursing Homes or taking rest cures!"</p>
<p>"It is, without a doubt, the truth," Mr. Moody agreed, his fingers playing
with his unkempt beard. "Fate seems to have passed me over."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it isn't altogether Fate, whatever that mysterious agency may be,"
Sandbrook meditated. "You see, every one of these men who has come to grief,
with the exception of Sir Sigismund Lunt, had a dark corner in his life, a
chapter of evil-doing for which he paid. I know that Lord Marsom's secretary
had at one time the idea that there was a conspiracy on foot against the firm.
Absurd! Men who are in public positions and who have been indiscreet at various
times in their earlier lives are always liable to be found out."</p>
<p>"Precisely," Moody murmured, in a tone which seemed to indicate that his
thoughts had wandered far away.</p>
<p>"You have the distinction of being the one exception," Sandbrook continued.
"Hence you alone have survived. You have given Fate no hold upon you. You have
lived a blameless life. Hence you, like Sir Galahad, the knight in shining
armour, share the board room of Woolito, Limited, alone with Lord
Marsom&mdash;unless I happen to pop in. What about another small whisky?"</p>
<p>If Mr. Moody heard the invitation, he rather impolitely ignored it. He was
gazing intently into the fire. Sandbrook, who looked over carelessly enough in
his direction, was startled. There was a striking change in the pudgy,
intensely commonplace face. Sandbrook's first idea was that the man was about
to have a fit. Then, the convulsion of his features took more familiar shape.
Mr. Moody began to laugh. He laughed internally, silently and with a sardonic
enjoyment which seemed to transform him from the realms of the ordinary plodder
through life to kinship with an altogether different and intellectually
superior order of beings. Sandbrook stared at him, speechless. He had, however,
prescience enough not to interrupt. He even waited until the spasm was over,
until Mr. Moody showed signs of returning to normality before he asked his
plain, matter-of-fact question.</p>
<p>"May I know the joke?" he begged.</p>
<p>Mr. Moody removed his spectacles and, with a handkerchief which wasn't much
to talk about, carefully wiped them. He then deliberately finished his whisky
and soda and rose to his feet. His abnormal outburst had passed. More than ever
he appeared to be a very ordinary human being.</p>
<p>"Lord Sandbrook," he said, "you are a newcomer to all this Woolito trouble,
so I see no objection in confiding to you the cause of my amusement, which may
have seemed somewhat ill-timed. I was laughing because I happened to think of
Leonard Blunt. You spoke of the peccadilloes in the lives of my various fellow
directors as being responsible for their divers misfortunes, and you
congratulated me on being the one member of the board who had escaped disaster
by reason of my sober and upright living."</p>
<p>"That's right," Sandbrook agreed, with a sudden rigidity of tone and
posture. "Quite right."</p>
<p>"The circumstances of my own wrong-doing are so obscure," Mr. Thomas Moody
continued, "and your concern in the matter is so slight, that I feel no
hesitation in explaining to you, Lord Sandbrook, the cause of my mirth. There
is not a single one of all my fellow directors, who is now suffering or dead,
who has committed a crime which would compare in horror and evil with the one
of which I am guilty. And no one knows. Probably no one ever will know. That is
why I laughed, Lord Sandbrook."</p>
<p>"The car is waiting for the gentleman, milord," Groves announced.</p>
<p>And the gentleman had slipped away before Sandbrook had recovered his senses
sufficiently to frame even a single question.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lord Marsom received his surviving director in the room which he called his
sanctum, a luxurious and delightful apartment on the fifth floor of the mansion
in Park Lane. It was fitted with extensions of all the telephones and private
wires with which the house was equipped, and the large Queen Anne writing table
at which Marsom was seated had been a show piece at Christie's. Mr. Moody,
brought up by a footman in the electric lift, was received by his chief
graciously enough, but with some evidence of impatience. Marsom was working
hard these days.</p>
<p>"Get at it as quickly as you can," the latter begged. "Glad to see you, of
course, and all that, Moody, but our departments are rather far apart these
days. No trouble, I hope?"</p>
<p>Mr. Moody did not immediately reply. He was looking out through the, as yet,
uncurtained window at the glittering expanse of lights stretching to the far
horizon.</p>
<p>"I met Lord Sandbrook on my way here," he observed, with apparent
irrelevance. "He asked me to step in and visit him for a few minutes. We had a
drink together."</p>
<p>"Sandbrook?" Marsom repeated. "I had no idea you knew the fellow, except in
a business way."</p>
<p>"I have only met him here," Moody acknowledged. "He remembered me, though.
We met in Piccadilly not far from his house. Apart from the directorate, he
seems to be very interested in the personalities of the firm."</p>
<p>"In what way?" Marsom asked sharply.</p>
<p>"He remembered the names of every one of the directors and pretty well what
had happened to them. He congratulated me upon being the last survivor."</p>
<p>Marsom frowned.</p>
<p>"I wish to the devil these people would mind their own business," he
muttered.</p>
<p>"He congratulated me," Moody went on, still looking out of the window, "upon
being the only one of the directors who had led a blameless life."</p>
<p>Marsom jeered.</p>
<p>"And what did you say to that?"</p>
<p>"I believe that I laughed. I couldn't help it."</p>
<p>"Do you good," Marsom declared. "I've never seen you laugh in my life. You
take life too damned seriously. As to the blamelessness of it, there's nothing
troubling you, is there?"</p>
<p>"Not conscience, if that's what you mean. No, I have never suffered from
conscience. Once, when I was contemplating a certain action, I yielded to
expediency. I may have made a mistake there. That's a different matter. It had
nothing to do with conscience."</p>
<p>"Did you come here," Marsom demanded impatiently, "at a critical time in the
history of the firm, and when I am doing the work of twelve men, to indulge in
these personal ramblings? If so, I will leave you to it. I have plenty of work
waiting for me sent up from Basinghall Street."</p>
<p>"You must not hurry away," Moody insisted. "No, don't hurry, Lord Marsom. I
have something to say&mdash;something I had to come and tell you. It is," he
confided, joining his hands together and looking for a moment at the bony
knuckles, "in the nature of a confession."</p>
<p>"Get on with it, then," Marsom enjoined. "Words were meant to spit out the
truth with and not for mumbling."</p>
<p>The even course of Mr. Moody's semi-soliloquy failed to respond to the lash.
He continued with the same detached air.</p>
<p>"Many years ago, there was a very troublesome man occupying a post in our
laboratories. A very clever man, perhaps I should say a brilliant one, but to
Woolito, Limited, a danger. You remember that time, Lord Marsom? The man's name
was Blunt&mdash;Leonard Blunt. Blunt is an English name but I believe that the
man was of Belgian descent."</p>
<p>"So you are going to drag up your own little peccadillo, are you?" Marsom
jeered.</p>
<p>"It has become necessary," Moody acknowledged.</p>
<p>This time his companion forebore to crack his stimulating lash. His eyes
were fixed steadily upon his visitor. He had the air of one willing and able to
drag the truth from the man's slowly moving lips before the words were
spoken.</p>
<p>"You and I, in those days," Moody went on, "had many conversations about
Leonard Blunt. We made him various offers&mdash;none of which he was willing to
accept. We began to have suspicions. In time, we found that there was good
ground for them. Then, one day when the time had come for action, you called me
to your office. You reminded me of that branch of my profession which I had
abandoned when I entered your service. You told me that Leonard Blunt must be
removed!"</p>
<p>"Well, that was simple enough," Marsom said. "I told you that. I showed you
what your duty was and you did it."</p>
<p>"Yes," Moody replied, "I did it. But not quite in the way you thought. I
have asked myself ever since why not. I have never been quite sure. It was not
conscience that stopped me; it was not ordinary fear; it was not any liking or
affection for the man himself. I believe, as a matter of sober fact, it was the
fear of retribution. At any rate, even when I was contemplating the best way to
accomplish our end, another idea came to me. I decided to avoid the supreme
risk. I was younger then and life seemed to be of more importance. There were
several experiments I still wished to make, several problems to be solved.
Therefore I took a line of my own. All that I had promised you was that Leonard
Blunt should be removed. Well, I removed him, but not quite in the way you
thought."</p>
<p>Marsom's chair creaked audibly. He had moved a little nearer to the edge of
the table.</p>
<p>"You mean that you did not kill him?"</p>
<p>"I did not kill him. I decided upon an action which absolved me from
criminality. I treated him with a toxin which I was the only man in Europe in
those days to understand, which produced softening of the brain and ultimately
madness. Leonard Blunt as a lunatic could, I fancied, do us no harm, and there
was no scientist in any part of the world&mdash;even if he had cut open the
man's brain&mdash;who could have sworn to the fact that this disease from which
he was suffering could come from outside infection. Very safe, I thought, very
humane.... We lunched together every day in the laboratory, Leonard Blunt and
I, so it was easily done. You heard of his illness. You were told of his death.
The latter, however, was a fiction. He was removed, on the day of his supposed
funeral, not to the cemetery but to the lunatic asylum."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>An icy monosyllable, yet with a spit of something burning in it, something
which Moody apparently failed to recognise.</p>
<p>"That was many years ago," Mr. Moody continued, glancing once more
thoughtfully at his knuckles. "He had no friends. His father lost his reason,
as soon as he was told the truth. The few acquaintances he had believed him to
be dead. No one has ever been near him. It was a pauper asylum. Many years
ago."</p>
<p>"Why are you telling me this?" Marsom demanded.</p>
<p>"Because it appears," the other confided, stroking his chin gently, "that
the effect of the toxin was not entirely lasting. Some impulse&mdash;I cannot
explain it&mdash;prompted me one day last week to call at that asylum on
visiting day and make enquiries concerning Mr. Leonard Blunt. They looked at me
in surprise. They told me that during these years I was the first person who
had made any enquiry whatever concerning him, and the strange coincidence about
it was this&mdash;that only the day before he had been discharged as
cured!"</p>
<p>Marsom uttered no exclamation. Perhaps he had realised before what this
narrative was leading up to. A little more of his knee was in evidence. He had
withdrawn the other one from the open space in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>"So Leonard Blunt, the man whom you told me was dead, for compassing whose
death you were given your directorship, is alive!" he said.</p>
<p>"It would appear so," Moody admitted. "I certainly made him mad. I condemned
him to what I thought was a lifetime in a pauper asylum, and the young man I
met in Piccadilly, young Lord Sandbrook, he congratulated
me&mdash;congratulated me upon my blameless life, that unlike the other
directors I had never committed a single action which was likely to bring
retribution upon my head! It seemed to me strange that,&mdash;when I was on my
way to tell you what had happened! I have a good memory and I looked back and I
remembered that day of the final dose. He had slept after lunch and he woke
with a start, shrieking and clawing the air. He had one moment of sanity.</p>
<p>"'My head is going, Moody,' he shrieked. 'There's something clawing at my
brain!'</p>
<p>"Then all his words faded into gibberish. But I remember his eyes and the
froth on his lips, even to this moment. He was quite violent when they took him
away. The doctor who certified him&mdash;he thought he was a gorilla and he
wanted to tear him in pieces. All those years ago. And I watched them bundle
him into a sort of prison van, tied hand and foot&mdash;A blameless life!
That's what the young lord told me I had lived...."</p>
<p>The muscles were straining in the sleeves of Lord Marsom's well-cut clothes.
There were points of fire now in the pupils of his eyes. He was halfway out of
his chair, leaning across the room. Moody was looking out at those far-flung
lights, when suddenly he began to laugh. Perhaps the beginning of his emotion
saved his life, for the man who was watching him so steadily felt an element of
surprise, almost of stupefaction, paralysing for a moment his limbs, arresting
the passion which had flamed up within him.... Mr. Moody continued to laugh. He
rocked in his chair and his sides shook. He beat his hands one against the
other. Tears welled up in his eyes. It was impossible to divine his sensations
while the fit lasted. Whatever it may have been, it was not strong enough, to
conceal the paroxysm of fear which suddenly swept over him, as he felt himself
torn from his chair, felt the hot breath of a man mad with anger upon his
cheeks, felt the scorching bitterness of that storm of words, not one of which
took coherent shape. Then, with the grip upon his throat contemptuously
slackening, the lash of the abuse abruptly terminated, there was a far-away yet
distinctly recognisable sound. Somebody was knocking at the door.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>Even Groves, most sedate of all butlers, seemed a little breathless as he
threw open the door of the library.</p>
<p>"Miss Frances Moore, your lordship," he announced. "She assures me that her
visit is of such urgent importance that I took the liberty of showing her
in."</p>
<p>Frances almost pushed her way past him. She had evidently come as no
ordinary visitor. Her hastily donned furs barely concealed the fact that she
was wearing only her thin working frock underneath. Her hat was arranged
without its usual precision, her hands were gloveless. There was an expression
on her face which Sandbrook failed to grasp.</p>
<p>"Can I speak to you for a few minutes, please?" she begged.</p>
<p>Sandbrook, murmuring reassurances, drew her to a chair and established her
comfortably. Then he touched a bell and gave a swift order to Groves.</p>
<p>"Now, tell me," he insisted sternly, "who's been frightening you?"</p>
<p>"Give me&mdash;just a few moments," she gasped.</p>
<p>He took note of the indrawn breath, the still quivering eyelids, and he
responded immediately to her agitated mood. He moved away to the fire and threw
on another log, listening for a moment to the almost noiseless traffic in the
street outside, punctuated only by the incessant blare of the motor horns. With
the opening of the door, he strolled back again, dismissed Groves at once,
shook and poured out the cocktails himself, and even handed her an already lit
cigarette.</p>
<p>"Buck up, little lady," he enjoined cheerfully. "More bad Woolito business,
eh? Never mind, you're in sanctuary here. What's wrong?"</p>
<p>She raised her glass to her lips and drained the contents. Then she set it
down deliberately on the small table by her side. She looked up at him. Her
eyes, with their veiled but terrified appeal, had never seemed more eloquent,
but her mouth was strained and piteous.</p>
<p>"Mr. Moody, the last of the old Woolito directors, has gone mad!" she
gasped. "I was in the room and I saw it."</p>
<p>"You saw what?" he cried, in blank bewilderment.</p>
<p>"I saw Lord Marsom apparently in a furious temper with Mr. Moody," she
moaned, "and Mr. Moody did nothing but laugh."</p>
<p>There was a moment's blank and utter silence. A log fell from the fire, a
taxicab honked its way towards Berkeley Square. Metaphorically speaking,
Sandbrook shook himself. He, too, had heard Moody laugh that afternoon.</p>
<p>"There was a quarrel?" he asked.</p>
<p>"If so, it must have been before I arrived. I was sent for, so I walked
right up to Lord Marsom's private den at the top of the house. Mr. Moody was
sitting upright in a high-backed chair, with the most awful look on his face,
giggling like a child, and Lord Marsom&mdash;oh&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Go on," he insisted.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom was smoking a cigar and standing with his hands in his pockets,
looking down at him. He scowled at me when I came in and I was afraid. 'See
what a few plain words have done to Moody,' he pointed savagely. 'He's gone out
of his mind. I'm going to telephone for a doctor.' He pushed past me and I
heard him walk down the stairs, though the electric lift was waiting, and there
were a couple of telephones in the room. I forced myself to cross the
floor&mdash;to go over. I tried to speak to Mr. Moody. He only laughed. It was
perfectly awful. I nearly had hysterics myself! I opened the window and leaned
out for a moment and the rain did me good. Then I don't know how&mdash;I left
the room, Mr. Moody shouting after me all the time. I locked the door and came
here. Will you go back with me, please?"</p>
<p>"At once," he promised. "This moment. Don't be so terrified," he added
kindly. "Very likely the man is only having some sort of a fit."</p>
<p>She shivered from head to foot.</p>
<p>"I saw his face," she moaned.</p>
<hr>
<p>There were no signs of commotion about the mansion in Park Lane when
Sandbrook and Frances Moore arrived there, a few minutes later. A smiling
man-servant relieved the former of his coat and hat, and would have ushered
them into the library on the ground floor but for a gesture on Frances'
part.</p>
<p>"I'm taking Lord Sandbrook upstairs first," she explained. "We shall see
Lord Marsom later."</p>
<p>The man opened the door of the lift for them and they ascended to the fifth
floor. Frances' fingers trembled so that she nearly dropped the key, when she
drew it from her bag. Sandbrook took it from her, as she indicated the door.
There were lights burning softly in the corridor, but no one about.</p>
<p>"The switch is on your right-hand side," she whispered. "Turn it on directly
or I sha'n't dare to come in."</p>
<p>"I'll do exactly as you say," Sandbrook promised her, "and don't be scared.
He was a nasty fellow, Moody, anyway."</p>
<p>Whether he was a nasty fellow or not, there were no signs of Mr. Moody, dead
or alive, when Sandbrook, having turned on the switch, advanced into the room,
followed a short distance behind by Frances. He looked round at the orderly
apartment and back at his companion for an explanation. She could only shake
her head in bewilderment. She pointed to the chair where Moody had been
sitting. Even the cushion upon it was undisturbed. There was, so far as he
could see, nothing unusual about the apartment. Sandbrook was genuinely
puzzled.</p>
<p>"You're sure that this was the room?" he ventured.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was a little too much for Miss Frances Moore. With the
hesitatingly asked question, a larger measure of sanity returned to her. She
made a genuine effort and, when she spoke again, both her tone and her manner
were more normal.</p>
<p>"Don't look at me as though you thought I was crazy," she begged. "Of
course, it is the same room. Strange things have happened here&mdash;before I
came&mdash;and after I left."</p>
<p>"For the scene of a violent quarrel," he observed, "the place bears a
peaceful aspect."</p>
<p>"You are very gullible," she snapped. "Come downstairs with me, please. We
are going to talk to Lord Marsom."</p>
<p>"What do you think has happened?" he asked, as they shot downward in the
lift.</p>
<p>"I think the cleverest man I know on earth and the devil himself in hell
have taken this affair into their joint charge," she replied....</p>
<p>Marsom, indeed, as he looked up at their entrance, might well have served
for a type of the modern Apollyon. A deep flush was upon his cheeks, his
underlip protruded, his eyes were like spots of fire under his fierce brows. He
seemed to have swollen in size. He had chosen to sit at the head of that long
table with a mass of papers in front of him, a shaded light and a row of
telephones. He was bulky, terrifying, dominant.</p>
<p>"Well, my nervous little publicity secretary," he jeered, "have you come
back to have another look at the lunatic?"</p>
<p>"Look here, sir," Sandbrook intervened, "wouldn't it be as well if you
treated this matter rather more seriously? We want to know what's become of
Thomas Moody?"</p>
<p>"His body or his soul?" Marsom demanded.</p>
<p>"We have more interest in his body at the present moment. Miss Moore
declares that she left him raving mad in your upstairs library, that she locked
the door and came out to look for help and advice."</p>
<p>"Quaint thing that she should have gone to you, Sandbrook."</p>
<p>"Not at all," the latter contradicted. "I have known Miss Frances Moore a
very short time, perhaps, but she permits me to call her a friend. I returned
with her at once and we found that the locked room had been unlocked, that Mr.
Moody had disappeared, and that the room had been restored with suspicious
skill to its usual appearance. I think that Miss Moore is entitled to ask for
some explanation. I think&mdash;by-the-by, that reminds me; I am a magistrate
myself&mdash;I think that I, too, am entitled to an explanation. Strange things
have been happening to your directors. What have you done, Lord Marsom, with
Thomas Moody?"</p>
<p>Lord Marsom's eyes flashed angrily upon them both.</p>
<p>"Young man," he said, "I have had a sort of liking for you, but I am not
going to mince words out of politeness. Apart from the fact of your being a
director of the firm, what the hell business is it of yours?"</p>
<p>Sandbrook deliberated for a few seconds and replied with a faintly
deprecating smile.</p>
<p>"I am not at all sure that it is my business, sir. There is Miss Moore,
here, though, who is in a great state of distress. Perhaps you would not mind
telling her."</p>
<p>Marsom looked from one to the other with anger in his eyes and a bitter curl
to his lips. When he spoke, however, it was obvious that his fury had burnt
itself out. He spoke almost calmly.</p>
<p>"The last of my directors," he confided, "is, or probably will be within a
week, in a madhouse! I sent him home and telephoned for a doctor to go and see
him half an hour ago&mdash;Goldbrun, Number 14b., Harley Street, if you want
any further information. I don't. Now, be off, both of you&mdash;this minute. I
am subject to curious whims, as Miss Moore knows. I have a fancy to be
alone."</p>
<p>His fingers pressed the bell. His two visitors took their leave.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the bare front room of his small house amongst the back streets of
Finsbury, the same old man with straggly grey beard, pale blue eyes half hidden
by horn-rimmed spectacles, knotted fingers and narrow shoulders, was bending
over his rough wooden loom, working the treadles with his slippered feet,
fingering the wool and continuing his eternal but profitless task. There was
the basket of drab, grey material on one side of him, skeins of coloured wool
on the other. As he worked, he mumbled to himself. The door opened without his
noticing it and his wife ushered in a visitor.</p>
<p>"Samuel, here's the old gentleman who comes to see you most months. He's
willing to work for a spell, he says."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Moody shuffled on to the vacant stool, adjusted his spectacles
and picked up a skein of wool. The old man scarcely turned his head.</p>
<p>"I am forgetting your name," he said severely, "but you should know better
than to disturb the head of a great firm when he's as busy as I am."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Moody mumbled. "I've met with an old friend lately who was
connected with the business, though. Orders still rolling in?"</p>
<p>"We have orders enough ahead for years to come," the old man replied, a
throb of triumph in his shaky tones. "What we will do now is more than I can
tell you, for there's word of Len coming back and he was always one for the big
turn-over. Eighteen thousand hands already, and if Len had his way, we would
have twenty-five! It's no good your offering us your orders, Mister," he went
on, pedaling away without looking up. "We have every scrap of machinery in the
place being worked at full pressure, as you can see, and we can't turn the
stuff out fast enough."</p>
<p>"You don't mind my staying and watching the machinery for a minute or two?"
Moody demanded. "I am a worker too. Every little helps."</p>
<p>"Ay, you're welcome, Mister," the old man acquiesced, treadling still more
vigorously. "It's a grand sight, for sure."</p>
<p>"I see you have one machine vacant," the caller remarked, pointing to an old
wooden loom which was standing in the same place as on his previous visit.</p>
<p>"Ay," the other assented. "Him as was to work it&mdash;it's a long time
behind his date, but he'll be here. Not much good to us these go-ahead days,
though. That's the sort of muck we used to turn out in his days&mdash;what's in
the basket by the side."</p>
<p>Moody glanced down into a decrepit waste-paper basket full of cheap, grey
knitting wool.</p>
<p>"That's where my Len beat him," the old man went on. "My Len, the great
chemist, you know. They was all thrusting that colourless muck through the
looms, and everything they turned out was drab. What's the good of going on
with that? The others will try their best but their best will be a poor lot.
We've got the secret and we'll keep it."</p>
<p>"Who did you say was coming to work this machine?" Moody asked hesitatingly,
pointing to the ramshackle loom.</p>
<p>"My Len," was the stolid reply. "He may be coming any day now."</p>
<p>Once more the door was pushed gently open. Very quietly, very unobtrusively,
carrying his umbrella in his hand, a middle-aged, bent man, of highly
respectable appearance, came towards them. Old Blunt half turned his head.</p>
<p>"You're late, Leonard," was all he said.</p>
<p>"Am I?" the newcomer observed. "Never mind, it was difficult enough to come,
anyway. For many months&mdash;sometimes I think it was many years&mdash;they
kept me in a country hospital. They thought I was ill, but I wasn't. Then there
came a doctor who really knew his job. He tapped me all over and he asked me
questions, and he made me sign my name in a book. 'What do you want to do?' he
asked. 'I want to get back to work,' I told him. He went away. Then he came
back with others a few days later. I didn't understand all they said, but they
agreed that I was cured. They took me downstairs. Outside there was a beautiful
car waiting. Here I am! Where's the yarn?"</p>
<p>The tenant of the room, still treadling, pointed to a vacant machine. Mr.
Leonard Blunt took off his overcoat, took off his other coat and turned up his
sleeves. He seated himself on the three-legged stool and picked up a handful of
the grey material.</p>
<p>"It's hard stuff to make&mdash;Woolito," he murmured.</p>
<p>"Ay," was the scornful answer. "And it ain't much, when it's made the way
you others have to go about it. Look at my basket, man. Did you ever see stuff
like that? Look at the scarlet of it. Look at the blue of the first lot. No
wonder you had to knuckle under."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Moody had risen to his feet&mdash;a wild, gaunt figure. He stood
staring at the latest comer.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"My name is Leonard Blunt," the newcomer acknowledged. "I have been away for
some time. That's my Dad, all right, although he seems to have gone queer. I
used to know you too," he went on, staring at Moody. "You were our chemist in
the old days."</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully Moody staggered a pace forward. The skein of wool
slipped from his fingers, a half-strangled cry seemed to come from the back of
his throat, as he collapsed onto the floor.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>Marsom, glancing through his morning papers in his cheerful and sunny
breakfast room, gripped the <i>Financial Times</i> in his left hand, his cup of
coffee in the right and remained for a brief space of time transfixed. Then he
read out to himself the headline which had attracted his notice. It was the
most prominent feature of the Stock Exchange news.</p>
<blockquote>"SHARP FALL IN WOOLITOS!<br>
<br>
"Woolitos were a curiously weak market during the latter part of the afternoon.
They have remained steady for several days round about 18&frac34; but a burst
of selling orders brought the price down at one time to 17&frac14;. They
finished at 17&frac12;, a fraction above the worst."</blockquote>
<p>Marsom rang the bell furiously. His secretary, who had been expecting this
summons, hastened in.</p>
<p>"Have you seen this, Crooks?" his employer demanded, tapping the
newspaper.</p>
<p>"Certainly I have, sir," the young man replied. "It was in the special
edition last night. None of the offices in the City will be open just yet, so I
took the liberty of ringing up Mr. Rawson at his private house. He tells me
that the weakness developed quite unexpectedly and he can only imagine that one
or two large estates are being wound up."</p>
<p>"Ring him up again," his chief directed, "and tell him to buy me a thousand
at opening price. See that the car is round punctually at nine o'clock."</p>
<p>"Very good, your lordship."</p>
<p>Marsom continued his study of the morning papers and poured himself out
another cup of coffee. The few minutes' tranquillity, however, which he usually
found enjoyable, had been rudely disturbed. In these days of overwhelming
success, success which he knew well enough was thoroughly substantial, he very
seldom troubled to look at the quotations of his own stock. With the bonuses
which would be distributed during the year, the interim and final dividends, it
was obvious to everyone behind the scenes that at 18, Woolitos were still
undervalued. From what corner of the world, he asked himself, could come this
extraordinary burst of selling? However, so much the better for him! A thousand
shares would represent a thousand pounds' profit before the end of the
day&mdash;enough to buy the necklace for that elusive little jade, if only she
would leave off playing the fool and accept it. Nine o'clock, her time was
supposed to be in the morning, in case he wanted her before their ways parted.
He'd bet she wasn't there! He rang the third of the row of bells which had been
moved over to his table. In less than a minute Miss Frances Moore opened the
door and came quietly across the room. She was wearing her hat and gloves and
carrying a small despatch case.</p>
<p>"Just arrived, eh?" he grunted.</p>
<p>"No, I'm just going out," she replied coolly. "I've been here half an hour.
Just finished my correspondence for the morning. I'm going down to the City
now, and then on to Tottenham with Mr. Maunsell, the editor of the <i>Illustrated
Press</i>. He wants some pictures of the building and a few different views of the
new model."</p>
<p>"Humph!" he ejaculated. "You're energetic this morning."</p>
<p>"Energy is one of the essential qualities of a publicity secretary," she
rejoined.</p>
<p>He shook the <i>Financial Times</i> at her.</p>
<p>"Seen this?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It's in all the papers," she told him. "The <i>Express</i> points out that a
very large estate is being liquidated this week."</p>
<p>"I am buying enough to give you that pearl necklace as soon as the market
opens this morning," he observed.</p>
<p>"There are other more deserving objects of charity," she replied calmly.</p>
<p>"You're a little prig!" he scoffed.</p>
<p>"For a man whose brains I respect as much as I do yours," she retorted, "you
can sometimes be very foolish!"</p>
<p>Marsom stretched out his hand, took a cigar from the box upon the table,
clipped and lit it. It was his one resource when he was in danger of saying
something rude.</p>
<p>"Want a lift down to the City?" he asked. "I'm starting at once."</p>
<p>"Thank you, no," she replied. "I have my own little car here and I shall
need it for later on."</p>
<p>"Do as you please," he snapped. "Report before luncheon. I may have some
instructions for you. By-the-by, did you see that article in the <i>Looker-on</i>
entitled 'Commercial Coincidences'?"</p>
<p>"I did," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Well, what about it? The editor ought to have known better than to have put
it in."</p>
<p>"The name of Woolito is not mentioned," she reminded him.</p>
<p>"You don't suppose there is anyone who doesn't know to whom the article
refers."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," she admitted. "At the same time, you can't expect to keep all
mention of this business out of the papers. Nothing like it has ever happened
before to any commercial undertaking&mdash;to lose seven of their directors
within a year. The article is very sympathetic and treats the affair simply as
a series of coincidences."</p>
<p>"Well, just warn the editor to go light," Marsom enjoined, rising to his
feet. "There's another illustrated paper with a caricature of me at the helm of
an empty ship. That isn't the sort of publicity we want, Miss Moore."</p>
<p>"Considering everything," she said deliberately, "you get very little of it.
I've had proofs of dozens of articles submitted to me that I've
blue-pencilled."</p>
<p>"Stick to the blue pencil," he growled. "I don't want any more of that stuff
like 'The Wonder Man of Commerce'&mdash;that article in the <i>Eagle</i> last week.
It's the stuff we want talked about, not the man."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," she concluded, as she took her leave, "it's a very personal
age."</p>
<p>Marsom's daily drive to the City would have been in its concluding stages
something of a triumphal progress, but for his fixed habit of leaning back in
his car and looking neither to the right nor to the left. His crude and
striking personality lent itself equally well to the caricaturist, the
photographer and the memory of those to whom he had been pointed out. Lord
Marsom, the Merchant Prince! The man who was declared to be making millions
faster than any other person in the world of commerce. Lord Marsom, the founder
of the great Woolito Company, with twenty-five factories in Great Britain alone
and branches all over the world. A nod from the great man might mean nothing,
but it was worth having. Few, however, ever succeeded in obtaining even this
limited gesture of recognition. In so far as Marsom was a <i>poseur</i> at all, he
aimed at being the detached Napoleon of commerce, the man of deeds and not of
words.... In the great building over which he reigned, he unbent so far as to
exchange good mornings with anyone who caught his attention, but there was
never anything of affability in his tone or manner. His eyes swept the
glass-enclosed suites of counting-rooms critically each morning but without
geniality. Behind, reaching the whole of the way down a side street, were
five-storied warehouses into which he seldom penetrated. He made his way to his
own suite of apartments in these days as rapidly as possible. He had no fancy
for passing along that corridor, where each one of the secretaries outside at
her desk was reminiscent of an absent chief. It was perhaps the one touch of
sentiment he allowed himself.</p>
<p>Once in his room, the man's Herculean labours began. There were his two
commercial secretaries on one side, with a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of the important
matters requiring his attention during the day. On the other was a line of
ambassadors from the different departments, bringing matters which required a
decision from him. It was half-past eleven before he permitted himself to lean
back in his chair and escape from the drudgery of detail.</p>
<p>"Give me Rawson on the telephone," he directed Crooks.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rawson has rung up three times already this morning, sir. He is on the
'phone now."</p>
<p>Marsom grunted and took the receiver in his hand.</p>
<p>"Marsom speaking. What was the meaning of that weakness yesterday
afternoon?"</p>
<p>"God knows!" answered a worried voice. "Have you had this morning's
quotations?"</p>
<p>"Not yet. More important things to see after. Did you buy my thousand?"</p>
<p>"I bought them at 16&frac34;."</p>
<p>"What?" Marsom roared.</p>
<p>"16&frac34;. If I'd waited a quarter of an hour, I could have got them at
16&frac14;. At the present moment they're 15&frac12;."</p>
<p>Marsom was speechless. It was several moments before he could collect
himself.</p>
<p>"What the hell's the meaning of it?" he got out at last.</p>
<p>"I'm off to the House to see if I can hear anything," was the agitated
rejoinder. "I didn't like to go till I'd spoken to you.... Shall I do
anything?"</p>
<p>"Buy me ten thousand," Marsom ordered.</p>
<p>There was a brief period of rest. Then Frances appeared, a little
breathless.</p>
<p>"I've left the others up at Tottenham," she announced. "I thought you'd like
me to get the newspaper men round."</p>
<p>"Sit down and wait till Rawson rings me up from the House," Marsom directed.
"What do they say about this business?"</p>
<p>"I've scarcely heard a word," she confided. "Mr. Crooks rang me up at
Tottenham and said he thought I'd better come back."</p>
<p>Marsom nodded.</p>
<p>"Good man, Crooks," he flung across the room. "I've just put an order in for
ten thousand," he went on. "I should think that would stop the rubbish. If not,
get a representative lot round at once."</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Much better to make it a concerted statement," she suggested. "There are
two or three newspaper men here now. I'm telling them to wait."</p>
<p>There was a further rush of business. Pen in hand, Marsom swung back to his
desk, signed a dozen cheques and several contracts. By the time he had
finished, Rawson was on the 'phone again.</p>
<p>"I'm coming straight round, Lord Marsom," he announced. "I don't trust the
telephone just now."</p>
<p>"What's the market?"</p>
<p>"Fifteen."</p>
<p>Marsom lit a fresh cigar with steady fingers.</p>
<p>"Go down to the cashier's department, Crooks," he directed. "See Mr.
Phillips and that man Goldenberg&mdash;find out if they've heard anything. If
they haven't, send them out. Let them go to the bars or anywhere. I want
gossip."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," the secretary agreed. "You'll see Mr. Rawson at once, I
suppose?"</p>
<p>"Right away," Marsom assented.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawson, one of the most distinguished figures in the House, a man of
presence and dignity, nevertheless, presented a somewhat harassed appearance
when, a few minutes later, he was ushered in. His forehead, when he removed his
silk hat, was wet with perspiration. He was distinctly out of breath. Marsom
pointed to a chair.</p>
<p>"Sit down and have a rest, man," he invited. "What's it all about?"</p>
<p>"That's the funny part of it," the stockbroker observed discreetly, whilst
he wiped his forehead. "No one seems to know. We should have thought it came
from America, but America won't be open for several hours yet. However,
whatever the reason may be, Lord Marsom, this much is certainly
true&mdash;there's a concerted bear attack upon Woolitos by some twenty or
thirty houses, all of fairly good repute. No one has divulged the names of
their clients. No one has offered any explanation. Each one has orders to sell
Woolitos up to a large amount. I heard 14&frac34; mentioned as I left the
House."</p>
<p>Marsom smoked thoughtfully for a moment.</p>
<p>"Looks as though someone were asking for trouble," he remarked.</p>
<p>"In the whole course of my thirty-four years' experience," the stockbroker
continued, "I never remember such an occurrence as this. A bear attack upon
what would generally be considered, I think, the strongest share in the
industrial market. Why, there were sales of over eight thousand before the
price even wobbled."</p>
<p>"Amazing," Marsom muttered.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence. Mr. Rawson was becoming himself again.</p>
<p>"One might have thought," he went on, "that some lunatic had got loose,
except for this one very sinister fact&mdash;the operations are spread out
amongst at least twenty firms. That is my excuse, Lord Marsom, for asking to
have a word with you in private."</p>
<p>The latter glanced round the room.</p>
<p>"This young lady," he explained, "is Miss Frances Moore, my publicity
secretary. I wouldn't have her miss a show like this for anything in the world.
Crooks, my personal secretary, you know. You may consider these two, Rawson, as
non-existent. Out with anything you have to say."</p>
<p>"All I want," Rawson declared, "is to ask you&mdash;as man to man&mdash;at a
crisis when only truth is of any avail&mdash;do you know of the slightest
reason why this attack should be made upon your stock?"</p>
<p>"Not the slightest," was the calm reply, "unless some company of
philanthropists wants to aid me in making a few more millions."</p>
<p>"Your affairs just lately," the stockbroker reminded him gravely, "have
encountered the reverse of what you might call philanthropic interest on the
part of someone or other."</p>
<p>Marsom's lip curled outwards. It was the first sign of anything approaching
emotion which he had shown.</p>
<p>"You mean the various accidents to my directors?"</p>
<p>"I do. There certainly appears to have been some malevolent influence at
work."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, Rawson, in your spare moments," Marsom said, "that you've been
dipping into sensational literature. I have had bad luck with my directors, but
when the cause of the misfortunes which have happened to them has been properly
investigated, it has turned out&mdash;in every case&mdash;to be due to some
irregularity in their private lives or character. My new board, who will be
presented at the next general meeting, will consist of a very different type of
person."</p>
<p>"There has been no falling off in your sales?" the stockbroker persisted.
"There is no new form of competition with which you are threatened?"</p>
<p>Marsom laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me these silly questions," he begged. "I'm sending for the
newspaper men this afternoon, and I'm having my accountants here at the same
time. Come and meet them. Hear the truth from the one type of man who never
lies&mdash;the chartered accountant, with a row of letters after his name and a
baronetcy in the firm. Notwithstanding the loss of Lunt's machine, we made more
money during the last six months than ever before in the history of the
business. We shall have to give away a ridiculous autumn bonus to get rid of
our surplus profits, and next month we shall declare, as we did last year, an
interim dividend of thirty per cent."</p>
<p>Mr. Rawson almost collapsed. He motioned to Crooks.</p>
<p>"The tape," he begged.</p>
<p>"His lordship won't allow it in the room, sir," the secretary replied. "I'll
give you the latest news in a moment."</p>
<p>Crooks hurried out but returned almost immediately. His expression was
grave.</p>
<p>"Woolitos are 13&frac12;, sir," he announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawson was in despair.</p>
<p>"There could be nothing wrong at your Nottinghamshire factories," he
suggested.</p>
<p>Marsom smiled.</p>
<p>"Our private line has been going all the morning," he confided. "They are
working overtime and they have been able to put on several hundred fresh hands
yesterday."</p>
<p>"I'm beaten," the stockbroker confessed, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>Marsom waved him back.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," he directed. "So far as one can regard this position from a
common-sense view at all, I imagine that this afternoon's proceedings will at
any rate steady the market. I have never needed to gamble in my own shares, but
the people who are responsible for this absurd business must pay for it. Make
out purchase orders, Crooks, for fifty thousand Woolitos."</p>
<p>Rawson's eyes flashed.</p>
<p>"My God, what a battle!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"There's no battle at all, that I can see," was the cool reply. "I know my
shares are worth buying at twenty. I have all the money I want in the world. I
have already all the luxuries an ordinary millionaire permits himself, but what
can I do? I can't let my own shares be kicked about by a gang of lunatics. The
men who attack us must pay."</p>
<p>"You don't mind if I spread this out, of course?" the stockbroker observed,
as he took the sheet of paper which Crooks handed to him. "No one firm could
deal with it."</p>
<p>"Just as you please," Marsom conceded. "All that I care about is that I get
the shares."</p>
<p>A page-boy opened the door.</p>
<p>"Woolitos, 13&frac14;," he announced.</p>
<p>"Seems as though you'll get the shares all right," Mr. Rawson muttered, as
he took up his hat.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>The meeting that afternoon in the magnificent board room of Woolito,
Limited, was almost an historical event in the City. Lord Marsom sat at the
head of the table, entirely his usual self, inscrutable, unemotional, with the
air of one a little bored by the whole proceedings. On his right hand sat two
members of the most famous firm of chartered accountants in the City, on his
left no ordinary bank manager even of a City branch, but Lord Hildreth, a
banker with all the dignity of title and inherited position. Below them were a
motley group of journalists, one or two members of the staff and Frances. There
were also three accredited members of the Stock Exchange, amongst them Mr.
Rawson. A page-boy, detailed for that purpose, put his head in at the door just
as the meeting was settling down.</p>
<p>"Woolitos, 12&frac34;."</p>
<p>The proceedings were opened by Lord Marsom tapping the table in front of him
with a little ivory hammer. He neither spoke, however, nor rose to his feet. It
was Sir Francis Seddons, the accountant, who stood up.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "this is the most extraordinary meeting which I have
ever attended. It is for you others, if you can, to explain the situation as
regards the shares of Woolito, Limited. I cannot. My business here is to speak
on behalf of my clients and to tell you of their grace and free will what the
position is from the point of view of their accountants. Wiping off the losses
ensuing from the disastrous fire, I should estimate their profits for this six
months at five hundred thousand pounds more than for the corresponding six
months last year. Allowing half the amount claimed from the insurance companies
for the loss of the Lunt machine and the model of the factory, I should
estimate them at a million pounds more. At the end of the six months which are
rapidly coming to a close, it is the intention of the company, and it is a
course in which they are entirely justified, to offer an interim dividend of
thirty per cent. and a bonus of one free share for every ten held. I only wish
to add to this the fact that eighty members of my staff are continually
employed with the affairs of Woolito, Limited, here, in the provinces and
abroad, and there is no single branch of their vast undertaking which is not in
a sound and healthy state. I have come here to tell you this, gentlemen, and
having told it to you, I can only express my utter amazement at the condition
of affairs prevailing on the Stock Exchange."</p>
<p>Almost as he resumed his seat, the door opened. The same monotonous voice
was heard.</p>
<p>"Woolitos, 12&frac12;."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom, without rising from his place, leaned forward.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "no one can do more than turn his father confessor
loose on you. Sir Francis Seddons knows more of the financial affairs of
Woolito, Limited, than I do. You have heard what he has said. You can ask me
any questions you like."</p>
<p>A member of the Press rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom," he asked respectfully, "may I venture to enquire whether you
have any idea whatever as to the cause of this onslaught upon the shares of
Woolito, Limited?"</p>
<p>"Not the faintest idea in the world," was the prompt answer.</p>
<p>Another pressman rose to his feet, even more hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom," he ventured, "may I ask you this&mdash;do you connect in any
way this extraordinary attack upon the solvency of your company with the series
of disasters which have happened to your directors during the last few
months?"</p>
<p>This time Lord Marsom's underlip told its story. His voice, however, was
just as distinct, if a little more bitter.</p>
<p>"No one in their senses could do so, sir. There was only one of the troubles
which have arisen&mdash;the incendiarism at Tottenham&mdash;which could
possibly be connected. The rest of the affairs were all accounted for by
incidents in the lives of the men concerned."</p>
<p>Lord Hildreth, in suave and pleasant tones, asked the next, which might have
been a very poignant question.</p>
<p>"May we ask, Lord Marsom, since you are treating us with such complete and
praiseworthy candour, what has been your own attitude and course of action with
regard to this attack upon your shares?"</p>
<p>"You may ask and I will reply," was the grim response. "At breakfast time
this morning, I had the first intimation of what was happening. My only impulse
was to make my pocket money for the day. I told my broker to buy me a thousand
shares at opening price. When I arrived at the office and had dealt with all
the affairs connected with my business which needed attention, I turned once
more to the Stock Exchange. I heard of the continual fall in the shares and I
at once ordered my secretary to telephone to my broker, Mr. Rawson, who is now
present, and instruct him to purchase a further ten thousand shares. Later in
the morning, Mr. Rawson himself came to see me and, learning that the attack
still continued, I decided to begin serious operations. I gave him a buying
order for fifty thousand, which order I understand, with the help of his
friends, he has already executed."</p>
<p>There was a chorus of exclamations, a sort of concerted murmur of agitation,
in which nearly everyone at the table joined. The door opened once more.</p>
<p>"Woolitos, 11&frac14; to 11&frac12;," came the singsong voice.</p>
<p>"That price," Mr. Rawson croaked across the table, "is after the purchase of
fifty thousand shares on behalf of my client."</p>
<p>There was an amazed silence. The banker cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"Are there any indications of foreign selling?" he asked.</p>
<p>"On the contrary," the stockbroker replied, "the selling comes from a very
small compass. I know three or four of the firms concerned, but they are
absolutely unapproachable."</p>
<p>"Such a situation," Lord Hildreth declared, leaning back in his chair, "is
outside anything I could ever have conceived."</p>
<p>"Taking the shares," Sir Francis Seddons said, "at the day before
yesterday's quotation of only eighteen pounds, at which price they are
undervalued, the bears have committed themselves to losses which run into
several millions. The situation is outside my comprehension. I have told you
the figures, so far as regards my clients. You must form your own
conclusions."</p>
<p>The pressman who had spoken first rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"May I ask the chairman of this meeting one more question?" he begged.</p>
<p>"Get on with it," Marsom invited.</p>
<p>"Woolitos are being quoted to-day at eleven and a quarter," he said. "Your
accountants value them at eighteen. Are you proposing to move further in the
matter?"</p>
<p>Lord Marsom was losing something of his equanimity. He scowled down the
table.</p>
<p>"It's a damned impertinent question," he said, "but I'll answer it." He drew
a half-sheet of paper towards him, scribbled a few lines upon it and passed it
down to Rawson. "I'm buying another fifty thousand shares at the market," he
declared. "I have been a holder of two million pounds' worth of stock for many
months. To-day I'm more than doubling my holding and glad of the chance."</p>
<p>That was the last word spoken at the meeting for, with the hurried departure
of Mr. Rawson, the pressmen rushed for the nearest telephones, the bankers
returned to reassure their clients, and the two accountants, who were forbidden
by the statutes of their partnership to deal upon the Stock Exchange, hastened
off to find friends with whom they could make amicable arrangements. Frances
and Marsom were left alone in the deserted board room.</p>
<p>"I'm going round to a few newspapers," she announced, "and I have several
paragraphs already written. Is there any particular line you would wish me to
take?"</p>
<p>He rose heavily and painfully to his feet, like a man who had been suffering
from cramp.</p>
<p>"Come into my room for a moment," he invited.</p>
<p>She followed him. He sank into the chair behind his wonderful desk and she
saw the lines gather in his face.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Tell me," she begged, "are you putting up a magnificent bluff? Do you
realise that you are risking the whole of a great fortune? Is there something
you know of which you have never disclosed?"</p>
<p>"Before God&mdash;no," he assured her.</p>
<p>"You seem ill," she murmured compassionately.</p>
<p>"I'm not ill," he answered. "I don't want to ring. I don't want anyone to
see me like this. Go to that cupboard. Get me a drink."</p>
<p>She hastened to obey him. She found whisky and soda, filled a glass and
brought it to him. He drank greedily and the effects showed themselves almost
at once.</p>
<p>"Frances Moore," he confided, "I'm telling you the truth when I tell you
that I'm like a man in a dark wood. What I know is what you and the others
know. I have backed my faith with more than half of what I possess. The other
half will go into the fight before I finish."</p>
<p>"You're a brave man."</p>
<p>"Not so brave," he continued. "Woolito itself is untouchable. I tell you
that we're turning out one million five hundred thousand pounds' worth a month
and a tenth of that is clear profit. You heard my accountants? You saw my
bankers? Get pencil and paper for yourself and work out what Woolito shares are
worth. There are eleven days yet before settlement. Who do you suppose is going
to have the banks on their side when that day comes?"</p>
<p>"There isn't any possible catch anywhere?" she persisted feverishly.</p>
<p>"Not one," he answered. "The books of the Woolito Company have been kept
like the Judgment Books of God."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>Sandbrook, tanned with the hot sun and the wind, returned home from a day at
Sunningdale to find Frances awaiting his arrival. He welcomed her
hospitably.</p>
<p>"What a delightful surprise!" he exclaimed. "But, my dear Miss Moore," he
added, in a suddenly changed tone, "don't tell me that you are up against fresh
tragedies."</p>
<p>For the first time in her life, she was conscious of a certain irritation as
he bent over her fingers. His eyes were full of concern and he seemed genuinely
shocked at her appearance. Nevertheless, she felt herself resenting acutely his
health and vigour, his light-hearted smile and the buoyancy, almost the gaiety,
of his movements.</p>
<p>"Yes," she admitted quietly. "There are more tragedies. I'm tired."</p>
<p>He rang the bell and gave an order.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" he asked, drawing a chair up to hers.</p>
<p>She felt suddenly helpless. It seemed impossible to explain all that she was
suffering.</p>
<p>"I have been standing on the edge of a battlefield all day," she said. "I
could not help or hinder. I suppose it has got on my nerves."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he sympathised. "I wish you'd give up this wretched work. I
can't bear to see you looking as you do."</p>
<p>The personal touch in his tone brought her no pleasure. She again felt a
perfectly unreasoning resentment of his health and well-being.</p>
<p>"Why should I give it up?" she asked. "I like it. I am very sorry indeed for
Lord Marsom and it gives me all the pleasure in the world to help him. Just
to-day has been terrible, but it's not always like this. So you have been
playing golf?"</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"Two rounds at Sunningdale: perfect day for it too. I wish you had been
there. It would have done you a great deal more good than stewing down in the
City. What's gone wrong?"</p>
<p>"You don't read the papers, I suppose?" she asked scornfully.</p>
<p>"Not I," he answered. "Why should I? Social news doesn't interest me,
politics nowadays are a washout, and there's no cricket news yet. Is there
anything going on I ought to have known about?"</p>
<p>"You should be interested," she said. "The whole City of London has been in
a ferment. There has been the biggest bear attack ever known upon Woolito
shares!"</p>
<p>"I saw something in last night's paper about their being a trifle dicky," he
remarked carelessly.</p>
<p>"The price was over eighteen yesterday morning," she told him. "They closed
to-night at six."</p>
<p>"'Something rotten in the State of Denmark'," he observed, without any great
show of interest. "I'm glad my executors didn't take them in at the full value.
You have not been speculating, I hope?"</p>
<p>"Don't be absurd," she answered. "I've only been a spectator. It's Lord
Marsom who has been fighting the Stock Exchange practically all alone. He has
spent millions to-day defending his own property&mdash;and yours."</p>
<p>"The gauntleted hero of finance," Sandbrook chuckled, with a smile at the
corners of his lips.</p>
<p>A sudden light flashed in her tired eyes.</p>
<p>"At any rate," she scoffed, "I should consider his more a man's work than
chasing a ball for four or five hours round the golf links&mdash;especially
when you are a director of the company yourself."</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence. Perhaps the entrance of Groves at that
particular juncture was fortunate. He was carrying the usual tray and Sandbrook
joined him at the sideboard. There was the sound of the popping of a cork.</p>
<p>"I am making you a champagne cocktail," her host announced. "The only thing
when one is really done up. The finest tonic in the world. Steady with the
Angostura, Groves, and pass me up the Hennessy Brandy, not the <i>fine</i>. Good.
Now a round of orange peel cut thin and a lump more ice."</p>
<p>"It all sounds awfully good," Frances murmured.</p>
<p>"It's going to be good," he assured her. "You will feel a new woman when
you've had a swallow or two of that. You won't mind if I have a whisky and
soda, will you? I'm thirsty and I've not had a drink all day. We had a really
desperate four-ball this afternoon and I only had a light lunch first."</p>
<p>She raised the glass, which the butler had brought, to her lips and set it
down by her side half empty.</p>
<p>"It's perfectly delicious," she told him gratefully. "I feel much better
already&mdash;and much better tempered. I'm sorry if I was rude, Lord
Sandbrook."</p>
<p>"You weren't, in the least," he assured her. "I suppose to you I must
sometimes seem a terrible slacker. You are used to all these men around you
doing things all the time."</p>
<p>"I never thought of that," she told him. "I have no right to judge, anyway.
I always admire courage, though, and to-day I think Lord Marsom has given a
fine show of it. You see," she went on, "money, after all, is the greatest
thing in life with him, and though it may be a poor sort of inspiration, it
takes courage to do as he did to-day&mdash;practically risk a huge
fortune."</p>
<p>"Did he stop the trouble, whatever it was?" Sandbrook enquired.</p>
<p>"For the time being," she answered. "No one can tell what is going to happen
to-morrow. I only know that another day of it will send me crazy."</p>
<p>"It's not your job," he pronounced a little brusquely. "Chuck it all and go
back to America for a time. You can't do any good at your job while these
fellows are fighting a Stock Exchange battle."</p>
<p>"Indeed I can," she answered. "I arranged a meeting to-day with the
accountants and Lord Hildreth and the Press. To-morrow there may be all sorts
of developments. The reason for the whole thing may come out."</p>
<p>"You think there is a reason, then?"</p>
<p>"You are not a business man," she said impatiently, "but you are not an
idiot. You know quite well that one of the best industrial shares in the world,
like Woolito, couldn't drop from eighteen to six without a reason."</p>
<p>"There must be a reason, of course," he admitted; "but you don't know it and
I don't know it, so why not stop worrying until to-morrow? To judge by your
appearance, you have had quite enough Woolito for the day."</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, moved across the room and studied her reflection in a
mirror. There were lines under her eyes and a general look of strain about her
tired features.</p>
<p>"I certainly do look a sight," she confessed. "I didn't know I was so
sympathetic. I sha'n't inflict myself upon you for a moment longer."</p>
<p>She hastened towards the door. He rang the bell, making no effort to detain
her. Suddenly she swung round. She waved the servant away.</p>
<p>"In five minutes will you please let them call me a taxi," she begged. "Why
is Lady Julia flying home from Paris to-night so as to dine with you alone?"
she added abruptly.</p>
<p>Sandbrook felt suddenly like a guilty schoolboy. Frances was certainly very
much in earnest.</p>
<p>"Does that matter?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It matters very much indeed," she answered, with a flash in her eyes. "Lady
Julia is exactly nineteen years old. She is in this dangerous position. She has
picked up all the mannerisms and ideas of the fast smart set with whom she has
been passing her time, and I honestly believe that it is only a certain
emotional delicacy which has kept her out of trouble. But that is not going on,
Lord Sandbrook. She is passionate, she is generous; she is, I believe, very
much in love."</p>
<p>"With whom?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"With you."</p>
<p>To have attempted argument would have been to have courted failure.
Sandbrook leaned against the mantelpiece and he said nothing.</p>
<p>"The thought of this," Frances went on, "has been among my troubles the last
few days. In these critical hours I have been able to keep it in the
background. To-day I looked through the engagement diaries&mdash;that's part of
my duty&mdash;and I saw your initials&mdash;9 o'clock to-night. Suddenly I was
afraid."</p>
<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have seen a brave man attacked all day," she recounted passionately,
"attacked by scores of enemies, trying to drag him to his knees, to take from
him the millions which he is supposed to prize more than anything in the world,
and then I had a chill feeling, and I knew that there was one thing which he
prized even more. His daughter."</p>
<p>The end of a log fell spluttering from the fire. Sandbrook made no effort to
remove it. He seemed fascinated by the girl's words.</p>
<p>"I had a terrible feeling," she went on, her eyes searching for his. "I
asked myself whether any man would be so mean, could stoop so low, having
failed in one, at any rate straightforward, assault upon his enemy, as to
attack a tottering giant in this base, this unspeakable fashion."</p>
<p>Sandbrook had recovered himself to some extent. He picked up the log with a
tongs and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Almost melodramatic, Miss Moore, aren't you?" he remarked.</p>
<p>"And impertinent, I suppose you are thinking," she added.</p>
<p>"Impertinent by suggestion, at any rate," he admitted.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the severity of his tone brought her reassurance.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are right," she confessed. "I have said more than I have the
right to say, only I am beginning to have a most intense sympathy with Lord
Marsom. I suppose I am like all women. I loathe to see a strong man on the
rack. How the present struggle may end I cannot tell. It is beyond me. But in
the background&mdash;"</p>
<p>She hesitated and he came to the rescue.</p>
<p>"Miracles have torn to pieces men's finest resolutions," he interrupted,
lifting his head at the sound of footsteps. "Save for a miracle, you have
nothing to fear."</p>
<p>Groves had quietly opened the door.</p>
<p>"Your taxi has arrived, miss," he announced. "If I might make so
bold&mdash;the fog is thickening and there are very few about."</p>
<p>Frances Moore hurried away with a parting wave of the hand. There were no
further words between them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>For once, on the following morning, there was a unanimous press. Lord Marsom
was the consecrated hero of the moment. The certified figures given as to the
position of Woolito, Limited, were amazing. The magnificent resistance to an
utterly unprincipled attack upon the shares of the company was sung by many a
modern Homer. The market opened with a stream of buying orders. Woolito, which
had closed at six, went up to thirteen, with scarcely a check. Then, towards
midday, there was a pause. The buying orders were exhausted. Very slowly a
fresh drop began. At its first signs, Marsom sent for his stockbroker. Rawson
was a man of weak temperament and he arrived in an utterly demoralised
condition.</p>
<p>"You know what your commitments are?" he asked his client.</p>
<p>"Why should I trouble about that?" Marsom grunted. "I want you to finish
this business, once and for all. Get some other brokers together&mdash;I don't
care how many you employ&mdash;and buy me a hundred thousand Woolitos."</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom," the stockbroker remonstrated tearfully, "we're safe enough. I
know that. It's you I'm thinking of. You're one of our best and oldest clients.
Why not hold off for a time? There's something wrong somewhere. There are
rumours about the Exchange now. I can't get hold of them. Nothing definite, but
I believe this selling is going on. Hold off for a bit. You're a millionaire,
but you're not the Bank of England."</p>
<p>"Buy me a hundred thousand shares," Marsom ordered savagely. "I'll pay you
cash for them, if you like. Out you go."</p>
<p>Rawson went out, dazed.</p>
<p>"Give me Lord Hildreth on the telephone," Marsom directed.</p>
<p>Crooks hurried out. The connection was quickly established.</p>
<p>"Marsom speaking. Is that Hildreth?"</p>
<p>"Speaking. Any news?"</p>
<p>"I want to draw on you for a million pounds."</p>
<p>"Good God! What for?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to buy every Woolito share on the market, if necessary," was the
fierce reply. "You hold two million pounds' worth and about six hundred
thousand pounds' worth of War Loan, beside a few oddments. Isn't that
right?"</p>
<p>"Two million pounds' worth of Woolito," Hildreth answered, reckoning them at
eighteen. "At to-day's price&mdash;less than a million, and they tell me
they're beginning to fall again."</p>
<p>"No more hesitation, please," Marsom said to the greatest banker in London.
"Am I to draw a cheque for a million or am I not?"</p>
<p>There was only a moment's hesitation.</p>
<p>"You may draw it!"</p>
<p>One million pounds sterling. Marsom signed the cheque in his ordinary, neat
handwriting.</p>
<p>"Take this round to Mr. Rawson," he directed. "Tell him to let me have a
full account at Park Lane to-night. I've guests to dinner. I'll look into the
figures afterwards. Tell him that I shall probably want to buy another hundred
thousand as soon as the market opens to-morrow."</p>
<p>Wonderful Crooks! Others had expostulated, others had gasped. Crooks
received the cheque as he might have done the signature to an ordinary
letter.</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," he said, and slipped out of the room.</p>
<hr>
<p>"What's the matter with those shares of yours?" a famous Duke asked his host
that night, as they loitered over their brandy in the library of the Park Lane
mansion.</p>
<p>"Hanged if I know," was the perfectly candid answer. "I haven't much time to
bother about the Stock Exchange side of my business. Someone's having a knock
at them, I suppose. Did you notice what they closed at?"</p>
<p>"Five and three-quarters," His Grace replied. "Would it be a good egg for me
to go for a few?"</p>
<p>Marsom poured out a little more brandy for himself and his guest. His wine
butler looked reproachfully at him from the background, but Marsom had always a
fancy for handling these cradled and dust-encrusted bottles with the remains of
the crown so dimly visible.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't like to advise you," he said. "They're worth more&mdash;a very
great deal more&mdash;than five and three-quarters&mdash;but whether they'll go
lower or not before the turn comes, I can't say.... Madame Norfinda and her
troupe from Covent Garden have just arrived. Perhaps we ought to go upstairs
and show ourselves."</p>
<p>"You never can get anything out of these City fellows nowadays," the Duke
complained to a friend at luncheon the next day.</p>
<hr>
<p>At twelve o'clock the following morning, Woolitos touched four. Lord
Hildreth presented himself at the Woolito offices. Marsom kept him waiting for
several minutes and then appeared with half a dozen skeins of wool in his hand.
He flung them carelessly on to his desk.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Hildreth," he apologised shortly. "I've been in
the warehouse for a time. What can I do for you? I thought we'd had a
heart-to-heart talk already."</p>
<p>"I know," Hildreth replied. "We, that is, my directors and I, fully
appreciate your candour in every way. But listen, Marsom, as man to man
now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, out with it," Marsom snapped. "Let money talk. I'm listening."</p>
<p>"You drew a million pounds yesterday," Hildreth pointed out. "A week ago
Woolito shares stood at just under nineteen. To-day they're four. Now, come on,
Marsom; we're both men of common sense. Notwithstanding all the accountants in
the world, all the stockbrokers, all the balance sheets, shares don't go from
nineteen to four in a week without a reason, and it's absolutely impossible
that the man at the back of the business doesn't know why. Let's get this
straight, my friend. What's the matter with Woolitos?"</p>
<p>"You blithering fools!" Marsom shouted, losing his self-control for the
first time. "There's nothing the matter with Woolitos. I've proved it in every
way I can. Start your bullying the other end. Go to the brokers who are
financing this bear attack. Find out who and what they've got behind them.
They're the people to tackle&mdash;not me."</p>
<p>"Since you take it that way, Marsom," his visitor pronounced coldly, "there
is only one thing to be said. You will please consider your account dormant. We
shall be glad, of course, to receive credits, but be so good as not to draw
upon us."</p>
<p>Marsom did not wait to ring a bell. He threw open the door himself.</p>
<p>"You and your damned bank can go to the infernal regions," he exclaimed
fiercely. "I'll never enter it again, and see that your people keep away from
here."</p>
<p>The boy from below put his head in at the other door.</p>
<p>"Woolitos, 3&frac12;," he droned, and disappeared.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another day. Again every newspaper was filled with the Woolito crisis.
Hundreds of strange explanations. Nothing tangible. Woolitos at
three-and-three-quarters! Marsom swallowed his coffee and pushed away the rest
of his breakfast. He lit a strong cigar and looked down at the pile of
newspapers at his feet. It was half-past eight. Soon the battle in the darkness
would commence again. A battle in the darkness it surely was, for during those
days Marsom had not the glimmering of an idea as to why or by whom he was being
attacked. Frances was the first of his visitors. She set down her
attach&eacute; case and sat on the arm of the empty chair opposite his.</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do?" she asked.</p>
<p>He hated the note of sympathy in her tone and tried to ignore it.</p>
<p>"What can anyone do in a world of fools?" he snarled "Your work's all right.
You're fighting all you know. Keep it up. They may crock at any time. I'm not
broken yet and Woolito's all right."</p>
<p>"Woolito is all right," she repeated, picking up her attach&eacute; case.
"That's my war cry for the day. I won't forget."</p>
<p>At nine o'clock Crooks appeared, for once in his life with signs of
haste.</p>
<p>"Your lordship," he begged, "take my advice&mdash;don't go to the City this
morning. There's a crowd round the offices in Basinghall Street ten or a dozen
deep. They're waiting for you. They want to know what's wrong with Woolito.
They're a rough lot and it isn't worth while. You'll tell them you don't know,
and you don't know, but it won't be any good. They won't believe you. Keep out
of it for just this morning. There isn't the slightest difference between your
being in Basinghall Street and here."</p>
<p>"Never heard you make such a long speech in my life," Marsom acknowledged,
with a grim smile. "I'll stay here till the market's open, anyway."</p>
<p>He lit a cigar, leaned out of a window to breathe in the sweetness of the
May air and sunshine and, with his hands in his pockets, strolled off to the
picture galleries. He was no mean judge of a picture, and he derived a pleasure
from them for which few people would have given him credit. He wandered about
for nearly an hour. When he took leave at last of his favourite Corot and
strolled into the great library, he felt a pleasant sense of detachment. For
once, he was the man outside his work. He seated himself at the end of that
long table and looked at the row of telephone buttons. Crooks came in just as
he was pressing one of them. Even his immutable countenance had grown
darker.</p>
<p>"Bad opening, sir," he announced. "Perfect panic everywhere."</p>
<p>"What price?" his employer demanded.</p>
<p>"Two and three-quarters," was the hesitating reply.</p>
<p>Marsom never flinched.</p>
<p>"What's my balance at Dunster's?" he asked, naming a bank where he had a
private account.</p>
<p>"Forty-four thousand pounds."</p>
<p>"Make out a cheque to self for forty thousand pounds."</p>
<p>It was done swiftly and with precision. Marsom signed it calmly.</p>
<p>"Dunster's hold the deeds of this house, I believe?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"They do, sir."</p>
<p>"Very well. Ask to see Mr. Critchley, the manager, on my behalf. Find out
from him what overdraft he will allow on the security of the title deeds for
thirty days."</p>
<p>Crooks shivered slightly. Overdraft was a new word to him.</p>
<p>"When you've done that, go straight down to the City&mdash;leave Rawson
alone&mdash;go to Peabody's; they're a respectable firm. Hand them over the
forty thousand pounds cash and tell them to buy Woolitos at the market."</p>
<p>Crooks took his leave. Then Marsom embarked upon an enterprise which he very
seldom attempted. He took down a telephone directory, found a number, rang it
up and demanded a word with Mr. Bertheimer. There was a little flutter in the
office where his message was received and in a very few minutes the greatest
picture expert in the world spoke to his most valued patron.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lord Marsom. Delighted to hear from you. I hope you have made up your
mind about the Correggio."</p>
<p>"What I want," was the terse reply, "is that you get into your car, if you
have it there, or a taxicab if you haven't, and come round to see me in Park
Lane within five minutes."</p>
<p>"I am already upon my way," Mr. Bertheimer declared, hanging up the receiver
and ringing off.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>The picture dealer was as good as his word. In less than ten minutes he was
shown into the stately library. He smiled as he recognised the preparation
which had been made for him. Marsom and he understood each other and on the
table, covered with a cloth from Florence, were two exquisitely shaped glasses,
a silver-chased ice cooler and a gold-foiled bottle of champagne. A butler, who
had appeared almost as though by magic, cut the wires, removed the cork, filled
the two glasses and bowed to his master before taking his leave.</p>
<p>"In perfect condition, milord," he announced.</p>
<p>"Don't sit down," Marsom begged his visitor. "Drink this first glass with
me; then I want to take you for a little promenade."</p>
<p>"The first part of your invitation," Mr. Bertheimer said, "I find most
attractive. 1904 Pommery, even if it is ullaged, is a drink for the gods. And
this is not ullaged. My compliments to your cellarman. And all the best to
you!"</p>
<p>The two men helped themselves to the thin biscuits upon the table and
drank.</p>
<p>"Come with me into the picture gallery," Marsom invited afterwards.</p>
<p>The inspection took three quarters of an hour. Bertheimer loved every
picture he had sold. Marsom loved every picture he had bought. They were
talking eagerly about the merits of a disputed Turner when they returned to the
library.</p>
<p>"And now," Bertheimer asked curiously, "tell me why you have sent for me to
come and look at your pictures."</p>
<p>"I wanted you to see that they were there," was the terse reply. "Adding
them all up, I see that I gave you one million seven hundred thousand pounds
for them. What will you lend me on them for thirty days?"</p>
<p>Bertheimer dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss. This is a moment of crisis. Take your time. I want all
the cash you can spare to-day. The pictures are there. I'll sign what your
lawyer sends me. How much?"</p>
<p>Bertheimer never hesitated. He held out his hand and grasped Marsom's.</p>
<p>"My friend," he said, "there will be no lawyer. This morning I had occasion
to ask for my balance. It is seven hundred and forty thousand pounds. Leave me
forty thousand pounds. Give me a pen. By the mercy of Providence, I have my
cheque book."</p>
<p>For a second there seemed to be a dimness in those brilliant eyes of
Marsom's. He poured out a glass of wine and drank it quickly. In a few minutes
he was alone with a cheque for seven hundred thousand pounds clutched in his
hand!</p>
<hr>
<p>The next morning before ten o'clock, Marsom, exultant, with the air of a
conqueror, a red carnation in his buttonhole and smoking one of his famous
cigars, made semi-triumphant progress to the City. The clerks and employees
whom he passed in the crowded corridors saluted him with a new and wondering
respect. Here was the man who, stripped of all his helpers, had faced the
attack of a powerful syndicate upon his interests and defeated it
single-handed! Every financial paper bore upon its placards flaming tribute to
his victory. Outside in the streets the newsboys were calling:</p>
<blockquote>"SENSATIONAL RECOVERY OF WOOLITOS"</blockquote>
<p>Everywhere smiles and congratulations. Life was worth something to Marsom
that morning. He laughed softly at Frances as, in response to his summons, she
glided into the room with a basketful of press cuttings and correspondence.</p>
<p>"Well, young lady," he greeted her. "Woolito is not dead yet, you see!"</p>
<p>Her smile was a little forced.</p>
<p>"Lord Marsom," she said, "before we go through my correspondence, I wish you
would have a word with Mr. Crooks. He has a letter which has just been brought
in by special messenger."</p>
<p>Marsom nodded assent and Crooks moved gravely to his side.</p>
<p>"This has just been brought over by hand from Dean and Masters, the
solicitors, sir," he announced. "I opened it, according to your
instructions."</p>
<p>Marsom took the letter carelessly enough. As he read, his face seemed to
become petrified. Expression died away. The finger of a living death might have
touched his features.</p>
<blockquote>GENTLEMEN,<br>
<br>
We are addressing you on behalf of our client, Mr. Leonard Blunt, who has been
absent from business for some years. Mr. Leonard Blunt finds, very much to his
surprise, that you have been manufacturing the Woolito goods for a considerable
period of time in colours, as well as in the natural material. We desire to
point out to you that your action in this respect constitutes an infringement
of the patent belonging to our client, particulars of which you will find in
Volume Number 7 of Textile Patents, at the Head Office in Cornhill.<br>
<br>
Our client instructs us to institute action against you in this matter and
places the damages, so far as they can be ascertained, at Five Million Pounds,
subject to the examination of your books. We are applying forthwith to the
Courts for an Injunction restraining you from manufacturing the goods in
question and for permission to examine all books containing records of your
sales.<br>
<br>
Be so kind as to send us the address of the solicitors who will accept action
on your behalf.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
<br>
DEAN &amp; MASTERS.</blockquote>
<p>The outburst which both Frances and Crooks were expecting never
materialised. Marsom read and reread the letter in silence. As she looked at
him, Frances was frightened. His eyes were as dark and penetrating as ever, but
his complexion was ashen.</p>
<p>"I always felt that Moody was keeping something back," he groaned. "Crooks,
go round to the Patent Office at once. Miss Moore, tell them to telephone to
Sir James Abercrombie&mdash;Abercrombie and Watts, Solicitors&mdash;tell him to
leave whatever he's doing and be here within a quarter of an hour...."</p>
<p>But no solicitors in the world could help Lord Marsom this time. The whole
thing was hideously clear. Moody had considered a certified lunatic as being
equivalent to a dead man. The patent granted was of so abstruse and technical a
character that no one was likely ever to dream of its existence. Therefore the
Woolito Company had made colours when it chose and, with the coming back to
earth of Leonard Blunt, faced ruin.</p>
<hr>
<p>The atmosphere of Number 31a, Park Lane, was perfectly serene that night. No
news of the final catastrophe had leaked out, and Woolitos had held their own
bravely on the Stock Exchange throughout the day. Lord Marsom had spent the
whole of the morning in his warehouses, a part of the afternoon at Tottenham,
where the building of the great factory with night and day shifts had become
almost an epic for the journalists. He had returned to Park Lane, calling at
his gunmaker's on the way, to find Frances waiting.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" he asked a little brusquely.</p>
<p>"I wondered whether there was anything I could do. You are going to fight, I
suppose? If one got in a few articles quickly&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not going to fight," he interrupted.</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound like you," she said.</p>
<p>"When I fight, I win," he answered. "There is no chance of winning in this
case. The patent is good. I don't know that I blame Moody altogether. Lunacy
should have ended everything. Anyway, there it is. Our lawyers have approached
Dean and Masters but they had already received definite instructions. Mr.
Leonard Blunt demands his pound of flesh. Let him have it. Woolito will pay its
creditors. I shall pay mine. But when it is all over, Woolito will belong to
Leonard Blunt! We have made nothing but colours for five years. Probably the
company will keep you on, Miss Moore. I shall have no further use for you after
to-night."</p>
<p>"You are very hard," she complained.</p>
<p>"You have been very hard with me," he rejoined. "Never mind, you were quite
right. You were like the rats&mdash;you scented disaster."</p>
<p>"You're a brute!" she declared angrily.</p>
<p>"You're not the first woman who has called me that," he replied, with an
ugly grin. "Run along and play."</p>
<p>She picked up her book and despatch case and tucked them under her left arm.
Her right hand she held out.</p>
<p>"Won't you shake hands?" she invited.</p>
<p>"Do you want to?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. I loved Woolito. I would drown Mr. Leonard Blunt in one of
his own dye pits if I could!"</p>
<p>A transfiguring smile changed his whole expression. He grasped her hand
cordially.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked, looking at him fixedly.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>"Probably pack a bag, turn up my coat collar and catch the Continental
Express," he replied. "Stay and have dinner with me and see me off."</p>
<p>"I would," she assured him, "but I have something even more important to
do."</p>
<hr>
<p>Lord Marsom spent the usual twenty minutes in his private gymnasium, and
afterwards bathed and changed for dinner, exactly according to his usual
custom. He found the tying of his cravat unsatisfactory and insisted upon his
valet changing it. Of the three boutonni&egrave;res submitted for his approval
he chose one of dark violets. A persistent rain of telephone messages he
utterly disregarded. Before sitting down to dinner, he sent for his wine butler
and ordered for service with his very choice meal a Berncastler Doctor of rare
vintage, which had come from a sale at Christie's and, with his coffee, which
was served in the library, one of his few remaining bottles of Napoleon brandy.
In his high-backed chair, surrounded by all the amenities of a luxury which he
half despised and half worshipped, he entered into a period of deliberation. He
filled many sheets of paper with figures as he smoked his Laranaga and slowly
sipped his priceless brandy. In the end, the decision was very much what he had
always known it must be. His hand stole into the pocket of his loose dinner
jacket and drew out the little present he had bought for himself on his way
home from the City. He examined, with the appreciation of a man who always
aimed at perfection, its faultless mechanism. He slipped in the cartridges and
closed the breech. The world always expected something sensational from him. It
looked as though it might be going to get it.</p>
<p>Crooks, who alone was permitted entrance to the room, glided through the
shadows of the spring twilight to his side. Marsom looked at him with fixed
eyes.</p>
<p>"I should not have disturbed your lordship lightly," he apologised, "but
someone has called requesting to see you and has presented this card. I had an
idea, perhaps, that it might interest you to receive him."</p>
<p>Marsom's glittering eyes were fixed upon the card. For a moment his fingers
doubled it up. Then a thought seemed to come to him. He tapped his jacket
pocket.</p>
<p>"Show him in," he directed. "Have the lights turned on and show him in."</p>
<p>He looked once more at the card. There it was, highly glazed and beautifully
finished, but utterly blank, bringing with it a sudden wave of sinister memory.
This time there was no message.</p>
<hr>
<p>"The Earl of Sandbrook, your lordship."</p>
<p>The young man came down the room swiftly and with a somewhat cryptic smile
upon his face. He seemed perfectly at his ease as he slipped unbidden into a
chair a few paces away from Marsom. He waited until the doors were closed.</p>
<p>"So now you know, Lord Marsom," he said.</p>
<p>"So now I know," Marsom assented wonderingly. "You have been the devil
behind the machine, eh? What the hell harm have I ever done to you?"</p>
<p>"It is my object," Sandbrook observed, "to avoid the melodramatic. When I
say that you killed my father, I'm launching no fresh accusation. I'm simply
stating a fact. You don't mind if I smoke?"</p>
<p>Marsom neither moved nor answered. Sandbrook tapped a cigarette upon the
table and lit it.</p>
<p>"My father," he continued, "was a very sensitive man. In his last hours I
discovered how much he had suffered from his association with your business.
Those Nottingham mill owners&mdash;you set yourselves out to break them."</p>
<p>"I had to," was the calm acknowledgment. "They were in my way. Your father
should never have come on to the board. He was the wrong type of man."</p>
<p>"Anyway, he was my father, and meant more to me than anyone else on earth,"
Sandbrook said. "I made up my mind that you and your fellow conspirators should
be made to suffer for what they had done. You were right in some of your wild
surmises. Every one of those untoward incidents&mdash;the burning of your
marvellous machine before the eyes of Sir Sigismund Lunt, the family disaster
of Archibald Somerville, the humiliation of Bomford, the discovery of
Littleburn's embezzlements, the scandal of Alfred Honeyman, Mayden-Harte's
secret gambling and Thomas Moody's fiendish crime&mdash;all these were
discovered and dealt with by a small firm of private detectives and a retired
actor named Churn, who acted as my agent. Your directors, Lord Marsom, have all
met with the fate they deserved. Last of all, we come to you. You yourself are
not in the happiest of positions."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom's right hand crept into his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>"Was it you," he asked, "who helped Leonard Blunt out of the asylum?"</p>
<p>"That stroke of genius was denied to me," Sandbrook confessed, "but I had
Leonard Blunt at the back of my mind all the time and it was I who discovered
him in Finsbury at his father's house a few days after his release. It was I
who beared Woolito stock to the last penny I possessed in the world, even of
the fortune left me by my mother. You beat us there, Marsom. We were obliged to
come out into the open. To-morrow the truth about the lost patent will be in
the papers."</p>
<p>"You're a brave young man to come and tell me all this," Marsom said, his
hand now out of sight in his jacket coat pocket. "Did you think I was the sort
of man who could be taunted in such a fashion without retaliation? Why did you
do it?"</p>
<p>Frances, who had entered the room unnoticed, a few moments before, came
swiftly up from the shadows into the circle of light. She stood between Marsom,
haggard now, dour and threatening, his underlip thrust forward, anger flaming
in his eyes, and Sandbrook&mdash;stern, fearless and yet with a keen
premonition of danger.</p>
<p>"It was I who made him come," she said.</p>
<p>"And what have you to do with it?" Marsom demanded. "Have you been in the
plot too?"</p>
<p>"I have not," she assured him. "I have been the faithful and exceedingly
valuable publicity secretary of Woolito, Limited, and I have been working at my
job until an hour ago. I suspected Lord Sandbrook, but I never really believed
until to-night, when he confessed.... Would you like to shake hands with me,
Lord Marsom? I have been your faithful servant. Your right hand, please."</p>
<p>Marsom hesitated for an instant, for he recognised the subtlety of the
request. There was an ugly thought in his mind but it faded away. His right
hand came out, hot from clutching the butt of his revolver. It was a tense
moment with a hundred possibilities. Sandbrook adjusted his seldom-used monocle
and took up the bottle of Napoleon brandy.</p>
<p>"The real stuff," he murmured reverently. "May I?"</p>
<p>"Help yourself," Marsom invited gruffly.</p>
<p>Sandbrook poured some into the goblet with meticulous care and raised it to
his lips.</p>
<p>"Here's luck!" He set down the glass. "Marvellous!" he murmured.... "What
about wiping out the past now, Marsom, and all that sort of thing?" he
suggested. "You Woolito fellows were a ruthless gang and the leaders have only
got what was owing to them. What about waving the olive branch? Especially," he
added, as he felt her soft fingers around his neck, "as I am going to marry
your daughter."</p>
<p>There was a moment's acute silence. Julia had crept into the room like a
shadow but she was there now&mdash;luminous-eyed, pleading, her arm around
Sandbrook's neck, her body shielding his, as though she felt some vague
apprehension of the tragedy which still threatened. Marsom was speechless.</p>
<p>"I always knew that mine would be an unusual love affair when it came. I
told you that, didn't I, Dad?" she pleaded.</p>
<p>"What do you mean&mdash;a love affair?" he demanded hoarsely. "He's been
working to ruin me, that fellow! He has ruined me&mdash;and you&mdash;all of
us."</p>
<p>Sandbrook shook his head.</p>
<p>"I can assure you that I have done nothing of the sort, sir," he said. "The
men who have suffered deserved what they got. You tied me up, and with Julia
here, I couldn't go on with it. That's just what happened. You win."</p>
<p>Marsom laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"You forget Leonard Blunt. The man's right. He can smash us. We thought he
was in his grave and we've been using his damned patent for donkey's
years."</p>
<p>"Leonard Blunt," Sandbrook said impressively, "is&mdash;for what he has gone
through&mdash;one of the mildest men I have ever known. We had to send you that
letter. That was the last drop in the bucket. Finished! I've done a stroke of
business on your account, Lord Marsom, or rather on account of Woolito,
Limited&mdash;justified my position on the board, after all! I bought Leonard
Blunt's patent and all accumulated claims against Woolito, Limited, for fifty
thousand pounds. He'd have come along to-night, but he's gone down to
Bournemouth to look at a small estate he's in treaty for. Fifty thousand pounds
is every penny he needs in this world and all he'll accept."</p>
<p>"And now you will hear what I have been doing for the last hour," Frances
intervened. "To-morrow morning every paper in London, at the instigation of
your publicity secretary, instructed by your youngest director, will announce
the fact that the sensational fall in Woolitos during the last week has been
due to rumours of the existence of another patent for the manufacture of
coloured artificial wool. That patent has now been acquired by Woolito,
Limited, with all liabilities attached, and the matter is at an end!"</p>
<p>It seemed afterwards to Marsom that in those few minutes he fought the
greatest battle of his life. There was a roar in his ears, the foundations of
the Park Lane mansion seemed to rock beneath him. Away they went into the
mists&mdash;the suave young man with the kindly face, Frances with her sweet
eyes and gentle voice, Julia so pleading and human&mdash;back they came. Now
they were talking to him, now they faded away. Frances had filled his glass
with brandy. He was sipping it. Now he was drinking it&mdash;the Napoleon
brandy of the house. He moved his tongue, over which a few moments before he
fancied that he had lost control forever. There was blood in his veins! His
brain was acting once more.</p>
<p>"But this Stock Exchange business&mdash;there's the settlement next
Tuesday&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think I've squared that all right," Sandbrook explained. "Dunster's Bank
and Barclays are doing it between them. The basis is simple enough. My joint
account with Blunt's&mdash;it was really all mine&mdash;will be set off against
yours. That is to say&mdash;we pool both profits and losses. We don't know
exactly what you paid, of course, or what the price will be on Tuesday, but in
any case, it won't matter much. The thing must work out about level."</p>
<p>Lord Marsom rose to his feet and drew a long breath. There was something
magnificent about the man in this moment of his passionate but suppressed
victory. It all grouped itself before his eyes. It was so simple. A move
here&mdash;a move there. He saw it all. It seemed like a smiling landscape
before his eyes as he gazed into the promised land.</p>
<p>"Very well," he agreed. "The banks can take care of the Stock Exchange
transactions. As you say, on the pool basis, everything will level itself up.
We will have a new board announced in a week. You will stay on, Sandbrook? I'll
promise you this&mdash;you sha'n't have anything to complain of. We will let
the others live. Woolito can afford it."</p>
<p>"Capital!" Sandbrook exclaimed. "And Julia, sir?" he added, drawing her
towards him.</p>
<p>"She has had her own way since she was a child," Marsom said, with an
unaccustomed softness in his voice. "I'm glad of it. She has chosen a man, at
any rate. Sandbrook&mdash;I am glad."</p>
<p>The two men shook hands.</p>
<p>"There's only one thing," Marsom concluded, and it seemed to those two that
for a few seconds he was curiously changed, this man whom at times all three
there had dreaded, hated and admired. "You will have to put up with a
stepmother."</p>
<p>"Cat!" Julia laughed between her tears. "I hadn't an idea of it."</p>
<p>"Neither had I," Frances declared breathlessly, as she felt herself taken
gently into the arms of the man she worshipped.</p>
<p>Sandbrook rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, sir," he said. "I admired Miss Moore from the first day I
entered this house. She has brains&mdash;almost brains enough to have found me
out. Come along, Julia," he added, leading her away. "Lucky you and I are
dining out!"</p>
