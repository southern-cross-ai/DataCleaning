  <p class="first">Martin Fawley glanced irritably at the man stretched flat in
  the chair he coveted&mdash;the man whose cheeks were partly concealed by
  lather and whose mass of dark hair was wildly disarranged. One of his
  hands&mdash;delicate white hands they were, although the fingers were long
  and forceful&mdash;reposed in a silver bowl of hot water. The other one was
  being treated by the manicurist seated on a stool by his side, the young
  woman whose services Fawley also coveted. He had entered the establishment a
  little abruptly and he stood with his watch in his hand. Even Fawley's
  friends did not claim for him that he was a good-tempered person.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is ten minutes <i>en retard</i>," the coiffeur announced with a
  reproachful gesture.</p>

  <p>"Nearly a quarter of an hour," the manicurist echoed with a sigh.</p>

  <p>The newcomer replaced his watch. The two statements were incontrovertible.
  Nevertheless, the ill-humour which he felt was eloquently reflected in his
  face. The man in the chair looked at him expressionless, indifferent. The
  inconvenience of a stranger meant nothing to him.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur will seat himself," Henri, the coiffeur, suggested, "this
  will not be a long affair."</p>

  <p>Fawley glanced once more at his watch. He really had nothing whatever to
  do at the moment but he possessed all the impatience of the man of energy at
  being asked to wait at any time. While he seemed to be considering the
  situation, the man in the chair spoke. His French was good enough but it was
  not the French of a native.</p>

  <p>"It would be a pity," he said, "that Monsieur should be misled. I require
  <i>ensuite</i> a face massage and I am not satisfied with the hand which
  Mademoiselle thinks she has finished. Furthermore, there is the trimming of
  my eyebrows&mdash;a delicate task which needs great care."</p>

  <p>Martin Fawley stared at the speaker rudely.</p>

  <p>"So you mean to spend the morning here," he observed.</p>

  <p>The man in the chair glanced at Fawley nonchalantly and remained silent.
  Fawley turned his back upon him, upon Henri and Mathilde, the white-painted
  furniture, the glittering mirrors, and walked out into the street...He did
  not see again this man to whom he had taken so unreasonable a dislike until
  he was ushered with much ceremony, a few days later, into his very
  magnificent official apartment in the Plaza Margaretta at Rome.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">General Berati looked at his visitor, as he motioned to a
  chair, with very much the same stony indifference with which he had regarded
  him in the barber's shop at Nice. Their eyes met and they exchanged one long,
  calculating glance. Fawley felt the spell of the man from that moment. Often
  afterwards he wondered why he had not felt it, even when he had seen him with
  his face half covered with lather and his fingers plunged into the silver
  bowl.</p>

  <p>"You have come direct from Paris?" Berati asked.</p>

  <p>"Those were my instructions. I was at your Embassy on Thursday afternoon.
  I caught the Rome express at seven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"You have an earnest sponsor in Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Carlo Antonelli. I have worked with him."</p>

  <p>"So I understand. Why are you not working for your own country?"</p>

  <p>"There are half a dozen more of us Americans to whom you might address
  that question," Fawley explained. "The department to which I belong has been
  completely disbanded. M.I.B.C. exists no longer."</p>

  <p>"You mean," Berati asked, with a keen glance from under his bushy black
  eyebrows, "that your country has no longer a Secret Service?"</p>

  <p>"It amounts to that," Fawley admitted. "Our present-day politicians
  believe that all information acquired through Secret Service work is
  untrustworthy and dangerous. They have adopted new methods."</p>

  <p>"So you are willing to work for another country?"</p>

  <p>"Provided," Fawley stipulated, "I am assured that the work does not
  conflict directly with American or British interests."</p>

  <p>"The Americans," Berati observed quietly, "are the only people who have no
  idea what their real interests are."</p>

  <p>"In what respect?"</p>

  <p>The Italian shrugged his shoulders very slightly.</p>

  <p>"America," he said, "needs the information which Secret Service agents
  could afford them as much or more than any nation in the world. However, you
  need have no fear nor need you think that you are the only foreigner who is
  working for us. You will probably become acquainted before your work is over
  with a German, a Monegasque and a Dane. I am not a believer in using one's
  own country-people exclusively."</p>

  <p>"You strip our profession of its honourable side," Fawley remarked drily.
  "That does not refer to myself. I am admittedly a free lance. I must have
  work of an adventurous type, and since my country cannot offer it to me, I
  must seek for it in any decent way."</p>

  <p>"Patriotism," Berati sneered, "has been the excuse far many a career of
  deceit."</p>

  <p>"It has also been its justification," Fawley ventured.</p>

  <p>Berati's expression did not change an iota, yet somehow his visitor was
  made to feel that he was not accustomed to argument.</p>

  <p>"The present work is worth while for its own sake," he announced. "It is
  so dangerous that you might easily lose your life within a fortnight. That is
  why I shall give you your work chapter by chapter. To-day I propose only to
  hand you your credentials&mdash;which, by the by, will mean sudden death to
  you if ever they are found by the wrong people upon your person&mdash;and
  explain the commencement of your task."</p>

  <p>Berati touched a concealed bell embedded in the top of his desk. Almost
  immediately, through a door which Fawley had not previously noticed, a young
  man entered, noiseless and swift in his movements and of intriguing
  personality. His head was shaven like the head of a monk, his complexion was
  almost ivory white, unrelieved by the slightest tinge of colour. His fingers
  were bony. His frame was thin. The few words he addressed to his Chief were
  spoken in so low a tone that, although Fawley's hearing was good and Italian
  the same to him as most other languages, he heard nothing. To his surprise,
  Berati introduced the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"This is my secretary, Prince Patoni," he said. "Major Fawley."</p>

  <p>The young man bowed and held out his hand. Fawley found it, as he had
  expected, as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley's work was well known to us years ago," he remarked a little
  grimly. "As a <i>confr&egrave;re</i> he will be welcome."</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, in obedience to a gesture from Berati, he departed
  leaving behind him a sense of unreality, as though he were some phantom
  flitting across the stage of life rather than a real human being. But then
  indeed, on that first day, Berati himself seemed unreal to his visitor. The
  former tore open one of the packages the secretary had brought and tossed its
  contents across the table.</p>

  <p>"Open that," he directed.</p>

  <p>Fawley obeyed. Inside was a plain platinum and gold cigarette case with
  six cigarettes on either side, neatly kept in place by a platinum clasp.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Berati demanded.</p>

  <p>"Is that a challenge?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"You may accept it as such."</p>

  <p>Fawley held the case with its diagonal corners between two fingers and ran
  the forefinger of his other hand back and forth over the hinges. Almost
  instantaneously a third division of the case disclosed itself. Berati's
  expression remained unchanged but his eyebrows were slowly and slightly
  elevated.</p>

  <p>"There are three of you alive then," he remarked coolly. "I thought that
  there were now only two."</p>

  <p>"You happen to be right," his visitor told him. "Joseffi died very
  suddenly."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"The day after he opened the case."</p>

  <p>Berati, who indulged very seldom in gestures, touched his underlip with
  his long firm forefinger.</p>

  <p>"Yet&mdash;you came."</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled&mdash;perhaps a little sardonically.</p>

  <p>"The men who work for you, General," he observed, "should rid themselves
  of any fear of death."</p>

  <p>Berati nodded very slowly and very thoughtfully. He seemed to be
  appraising the man who stood on the other side of his desk.</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," he admitted, "that we may get on."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," Fawley agreed. "Curiosity prompts me to ask you one
  question, however. When you sent for me, had you any idea that we had met in
  that barber's shop at Nice?"</p>

  <p>"I knew it perfectly well."</p>

  <p>"I confess that that puzzles me a little," Fawley admitted. "I was at my
  worst that day. I did not show the self-control of a schoolboy. I had not
  even the excuse of being in a hurry. I was annoyed because you had taken my
  place and I showed it."</p>

  <p>Berati smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was the very fact," he pronounced, "that you were able to forget your
  profession on an ordinary occasion which commended you to me. Our own
  men&mdash;most of them, at any rate&mdash;err on the side of being too
  stealthy. They are too obvious in their subterfuges ever to reach the
  summits. You have the art&mdash;or shall I call it the genius?&mdash;of being
  able to display your natural feelings when you are, so to speak, in mufti.
  You impressed me, as you would any man, with the idea that you were a
  somewhat choleric, somewhat crude Englishman or American, thinking, as usual,
  that the better half of any deal should fall to you. I made up my mind that
  if you were free you were my man."</p>

  <p>"You had the advantage of me," Fawley reflected.</p>

  <p>"I never forget a face," the other confided. "You were in Rome five years
  ago&mdash;some important mission&mdash;but I could recall it if I chose... To
  proceed. You know where to look for your identification papers if it should
  become necessary to show them. Your supplementary passports are in the same
  place&mdash;both diplomatic and social."</p>

  <p>"Passports," Fawley remarked, as he disposed of the cigarette case in the
  inner pocket of his waistcoat, "generally indicate a journey."</p>

  <p>Berati's long fingers played for a moment with the stiff collar of his
  uniform. He looked meaningly across his table.</p>

  <p>"Adventure is to be found in so many of these southern cities," he
  observed. "Monte Carlo is very pleasant at this time of the year and the
  France is an excellent hotel. A countryman of ours, I remind myself, is in
  charge there. There is also a German named Krust&mdash;but that will do
  later. Our relations with him are at present undetermined. Your first centre
  of activities will be within twenty kilometres of the Casino. <i>A rivederci,
  Signor.</i>"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. Fawley took it, but lingered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"My instructions&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"They will arrive," the Italian interrupted. "Have no anxiety. There will
  be plenty of work for you. You will begin where Joseffi left off. I wish you
  better fortune."</p>

  <p>Fawley obeyed the little wave of the hand and took his leave. In doing so,
  however, he made a not incomprehensible error. The room was irregular in
  shape, with panelled walls, and every one of the oval recesses possessed a
  door which matched its neighbour. His fingers closed upon the handle of the
  one through which he believed that he had entered. Almost at once Berati's
  voice snapped out from behind him like a pistol shot.</p>

  <p>"Not that one! The next to your right."</p>

  <p>Fawley did not, however, at once withdraw his hand from the beautiful
  piece of brass ornamentation upon which it rested.</p>

  <p>"Where does this one lead to?" he asked with apparent irrelevance.</p>

  <p>Berati's voice was suddenly harsh.</p>

  <p>"My own apartments&mdash;the Palazzo Berati. Be so good as to pass out by
  the adjoining door."</p>

  <p>Fawley remained motionless. Berati's voice was coldly angry.</p>

  <p>"There is perhaps some explanation&mdash;" he began ominously.</p>

  <p>"Explanation enough," Fawley interrupted. "Some one is holding the handle
  of this door on the other side. They are even now matching the strength of
  their fingers against mine."</p>

  <p>"You mean that some one is attempting to enter?"</p>

  <p>"Obviously," Fawley replied. "Shall I let them in?"</p>

  <p>"In ten seconds," Berati directed. "Count ten to yourself and then open
  the door."</p>

  <p>Fawley obeyed his new Chief literally and it was probably that instinct of
  self-preservation which had always been helpfully present with him in times
  of crisis which saved his life. He sprang to one side, sheltering himself
  behind the partially opened door. A bullet whistled past his ear, so that for
  hours afterwards he felt a singing there, as though a hot wind was stabbing
  at him. There was a crash from behind him in the room. Berati's chair was
  empty! Down the passage was dimly visible the figure of a woman, whose feet
  seemed scarcely to touch the polished oak floor. Fawley was barely in time,
  for she had almost reached the far end before he started in pursuit. He
  called out to her, hoping that she would turn her head and allow him a
  glimpse of her face, but she was too clever for any <i>gaucherie</i> of that
  sort. He passed through a little unseen cloud of faint indefinite perfume,
  such as might float from a woman's handkerchief shaken in the dark, stooped
  in his running to pick up and thrust a glittering trifle into his pocket, and
  almost reached her before she disappeared through some thickly hanging
  brocaded curtains. It was only a matter of seconds before Fawley flung them
  on one side in pursuit and emerged into a large square anteroom with shabby
  magnificent hangings, but with several wonderful pictures on the walls and
  two closed doors on either side. He paused to listen but all that he could
  hear was the soft sobbing of stringed instruments in the distance and a
  murmur of many voices, apparently from the reception rooms of the
  <i>palazzo</i>. He looked doubtfully at the doors. They had the air of not
  having been opened for generations. The only signs of human life came from
  the corridor straight ahead which obviously led into the reception rooms.
  Fawley hesitated only for a moment, then he made his way cautiously along it
  until he arrived at a slight bend and a further barrier of black
  curtains&mdash;curtains of some heavy material which looked like
  velvet&mdash;emblazoned in faded gold with the arms of a famous family...He
  paused once more and listened. At that moment the music ceased. From the
  storm of applause he gathered that there must have been at least several
  hundred people quite close to him on the other side of the curtain. He
  hesitated, frowning. Notwithstanding his eagerness to track down the would-be
  assassin, it seemed hopeless to make his way amongst a throng of strangers,
  however ingenious the explanations he might offer, in search of a woman whose
  face he had scarcely seen and whom he could recognise only by the colour of
  her gown. Reluctantly he retraced his steps and stood once more in the
  anteroom which, like many apartments in the great Roman palaces which he had
  visited, seemed somehow to have lost its sense of habitation and to carry
  with it a suggestion of disuse. There were the two doors. He looked at them
  doubtfully. Suddenly one was softly opened and a woman stood looking out at
  him with a half-curious, half-frightened expression in her brown eyes. She
  was wearing a dress the colour of which reminded him of the lemon groves
  around Sorrento.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An angry and a frightened woman! Fawley had seen many of
  them before in his life but never one quite of this type. Her eyes, which
  should have been beautiful, were blazing. Her lips&mdash;gashes of scarlet
  fury&mdash;seemed as if they were on the point of withering him with a storm
  of words. Yet when she spoke, she spoke with reserve, without subtlety, a
  plain, blunt question.</p>

  <p>"Why are you following me about?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that," he protested. "I am keeping you under observation for a
  time."</p>

  <p>"Like all you Anglo-Saxons, you are a liar and an impudent one," she spat
  out..."Wait!"</p>

  <p>Her tone had suddenly changed to one of alarm. Instinctively he followed
  her lead and listened. More and more distinctly he could hear detached voices
  at the end of the corridor which led into the reception rooms. The curtains
  must have been drawn to one side, for the hum of conversation became much
  louder. She caught at his wrist.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," she ordered.</p>

  <p>They passed into a darkened entresol. She flung open an inner door and
  Fawley found himself in a bedroom&mdash;a woman's
  bedroom&mdash;high-ceilinged, austere after the Italian fashion, but with
  exquisite linen and lace upon the old four-postered bed, and with a shrine in
  one corner, its old gilt work beautifully fashioned&mdash;a representation of
  the Madonna&mdash;a strangely moving work of art. She locked the door with a
  ponderous key.</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>She scoffed at him. The fury had faded from her face and Fawley, in an
  impersonal sort of way, was beginning to realise how beautiful she was.</p>

  <p>"Do not think that I am afraid," she said coldly. "I have done that to
  protect myself. If you refuse to give me what I ask for, I shall shoot you
  and point to the locked door as my excuse. You followed me in. There can be
  no denying that."</p>

  <p>She was passionately in earnest, but a sense of humour which had
  befriended Fawley in many grimmer moments chose inappropriately enough to
  assert itself just then. With all her determination, it was obvious that her
  courage was a matter of nerve, that having once keyed herself up to a
  desperate action she was near enough now to collapse. Probably that made her
  the more dangerous, but Fawley did not stop to reflect. He leaned against the
  high-backed chair and laughed quietly...Afterwards he realised that he was in
  as great danger of his life in those few seconds as at any time during his
  adventurous career. But after that first flash of renewed fury something
  responsive, or at any rate sympathetic, seemed to creep into her face and
  showed itself suddenly in the quivering of her lips. Her fingers, which had
  been creeping towards the bosom of her dress, retreated empty.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what it is that you want from me," Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"You know," she answered. "I want my slipper."</p>

  <p>He felt in his pocket and knew at once that his first suspicion had been
  correct. He shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"Alas," he replied, "I am forced to keep this little memento of your
  expedition for the present. As to what happened a few minutes ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about that?" she interrupted. "I deny
  nothing. I tried to kill Berati. But for the fact that you unnerved
  me&mdash;I did not expect to find any one holding the door on the other
  side&mdash;I should have done it. As it is, I fear that he has escaped."</p>

  <p>"What did you want to kill the General for?" Fawley asked curiously. "You
  are both Italian, are you not, and Berati is at least a patriot?"</p>

  <p>"Take my advice," she answered, "and do not try to interfere in matters of
  which you know nothing."</p>

  <p>"That seems a little hard on me," Fawley protested, with a smile. "I have
  been knocking about Europe for a reasonable number of years and I should say
  that no man had worked harder for his country than Berati."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she rejoined, "he is on the point of making a hideous
  blunder. If you had known as much as I do, you would have stepped back and
  let me kill him."</p>

  <p>"I am not in favour of murder as an argument," Fawley objected.</p>

  <p>"You think too much of human life, you Americans," she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"In any case, Berati has done a great deal for Italy," he reminded
  her.</p>

  <p>"There are some who think otherwise," she answered.</p>

  <p>She listened for another moment, then she moved to the door and turned the
  key. She swung around and faced Fawley. The anger had all gone. Her eyes had
  softened. There was a note almost of pleading in her tone.</p>

  <p>"There shall be no more melodrama," she promised. "I want what you picked
  up of mine. It is necessary that I go back to the reception of the
  Principessa."</p><br>

  </div>

  <p>"I am not detaining you," Fawley ventured to remind her hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest then," she asked, with a faint uplifting of her delicate
  eyebrows, "that I make my appearance in that crowded room with but one shoe
  on?"</p>

  <p>"This being apparently your bedchamber," Fawley replied, looking around,
  "it occurs to me as possible that you might find another pair."</p>

  <p>"Nothing that would go with the peculiar shade of my frock and these
  stockings," she assured him, lifting her skirt a few inches and showing him
  her exquisitely sheened ankles.</p>

  <p>Fawley sighed.</p>

  <p>"Alas," he regretted, "an hour ago I was a free man. You could have had
  your slipper with pleasure. At this moment I am under a commitment to Berati.
  His interests and his safety&mdash;if he is still alive&mdash;must be my
  first consideration."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that after all I hit him?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I fear that it is quite possible. All I know is that he was seated in his
  chair one moment, you fired, and when I had looked around the chair was
  empty."</p>

  <p>She smiled doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"He is very hard to kill."</p>

  <p>"And it appears to me that you are a very inexperienced assassin!"</p>

  <p>"That," she confided, "is because I never wanted to kill a man before.
  Please give me my slipper."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If Berati is alive," he warned her, "it will be my duty to hand it over
  to him and to describe you according to the best of my ability."</p>

  <p>"And if he is dead?"</p>

  <p>"If he is dead, my contract with him is finished and I shall leave Rome
  within an hour. You, at any rate, would be safe."</p>

  <p>"How shall you describe me if you have to?" she asked, with a bewildering
  smile.</p>

  <p>Insouciance was a quality which Fawley, in common with most people, always
  admired in criminals and beautiful women. He tried his best with a clumsier
  tongue to follow her lead.</p>

  <p>"Signorina," he said, "or Mademoiselle&mdash;heaven help me if I can make
  up my mind as to your nationality&mdash;I am afraid that my description would
  be of very little real utility because I cannot imagine myself inventing
  phrases to describe you adequately."</p>

  <p>"That is quite good," she approved, "for a man in conference with a
  would-be murderess. But after all I must look like something or other."</p>

  <p>"I will turn myself into a police proclamation," he announced. "You have
  unusual eyes which are more normal now but which a few minutes ago were
  shooting lightnings of hate at me. They are a very beautiful colour&mdash;a
  kind of hazel, I suppose. You have an Italian skin, the ivory pallor of
  perfect health which belongs only to your country-people. Your hair I should
  rather like to feel but it looks like silk and it reminds one of dull gold.
  You have the figure of a child but it is obvious that you have the tongue,
  the brain, the experience of a woman who has seen something of life...With
  that description published, would you dare to walk the streets of Rome
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"A proud woman but, alas, I fear in perfect safety," she sighed. "Too many
  people have failed with Berati and you distracted my attention. I saw his
  still, terrible face but when I looked and hoped for that transforming cloud
  of horror, I saw only you. You frightened me and I fled."</p>

  <p>Fawley moved slightly towards the door.</p>

  <p>"It is plainly my duty," he said, "to find out whether Berati is alive or
  dead."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you."</p>

  <p>"And when I have discovered?"</p>

  <p>"Listen," she begged, moving a little nearer towards him. "There is a tiny
  caf&eacute; in a fashionable but not too reputable corner of Rome in the
  arcade leading from the Plaza Vittoria. Its name is the Caf&eacute; of the
  Shining Star. You will find me there at ten o'clock. May I have my shoe so
  that I can make a dignified departure?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head. He pointed to an antique Italian armoire which
  looked as if it might be used as a boot cupboard.</p>

  <p>"You can help yourself, Signorina. The slipper I have in my pocket I keep
  until I know whether Berati is alive or dead."</p>

  <p>"You keep it as evidence&mdash;yes? You would hand me over as the
  assassin? As though any one would believe your story!"</p>

  <p>"All the same," Fawley reminded her, "for the moment Berati is my
  master."</p>

  <p>He turned the handle of the door. She kissed the tips of her fingers to
  him lightly.</p>

  <p>"I can see," she sighed, "that you are one of those who do not change
  their minds. All the same, I warn you there is danger in what you are
  doing."</p>

  <p>"A slipper," Fawley protested, "a delicate satin slipper with a slightly
  raised inner sole could never bring me ill luck."</p>

  <p>She shook her head and there was no ghost of a smile upon her lips just
  then.</p>

  <p>"Medici buckles," she confided. "They are very nearly priceless. Men and
  women in the old days paid with their lives for what you are doing."</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the buckle back," he promised. "For the rest, I will use
  my penknife carefully."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Once more Fawley entered Berati's palatial bureau with a
  certain trepidation. His heart sank still further after his first glance
  towards the desk. The chair behind it was occupied by Prince Patoni.</p>

  <p>"What about the Chief?" Fawley asked eagerly. "Was he hurt?"</p>

  <p>The young man remained silent for a moment, his jet-black eyes fixed upon
  his visitor's, his fingers toying with the watch-chain which was suspended
  from a high button of his waistcoat. He seemed, in his ravenlike black
  clothes, with his hooked nose, his thin aristocratic face and bloodless lips,
  like some bird of prey.</p>

  <p>"Our Chief," he announced calmly, "is unhurt. A modern assassin seldom
  succeeds in checking a really great career. He has left a message for you.
  Will you be pleased to receive it."</p>

  <p>Fawley drew a sigh of relief. Life seemed suddenly to become less
  complicated.</p>

  <p>"Let me hear what it is, if you please," he begged.</p>

  <p>"The Chief has been summoned to his wife's, the Principessa's, reception
  at the <i>palazzo</i>. Some royalties, I believe, have made their appearance.
  It is his wish that you should repair there immediately. Here," he added,
  pushing a highly glazed and beautifully engraved card across the table
  towards him, "is your invitation, as you are probably unknown to the servants
  and ushers of the household."</p>

  <p>Fawley glanced at the card and thrust it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I will go, of course," he replied, "but please explain to me how it is
  that Berati's wife is Principessa? He himself, I understood, had no other
  rank than his military one of General."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," Patoni admitted, "but our illustrious Chief married
  some time ago the Principessa de Morenato...You will leave the bureau as you
  entered it. When you reach the street, turn to the right twice and the
  entrance to the <i>palazzo</i> courtyard confronts you. I must beg you not to
  delay."</p>

  <p>"Tell me before I leave," Fawley begged, "if any orders have been issued
  for the arrest of the person who fired that shot?"</p>

  <p>"The matter does not come, sir, within the scope of your activities," was
  the icy reply.</p>

  <p>Fawley took his departure and made his way according to directions to
  where, under a scarlet awning, guests were coming and going from the great
  grey stone <i>palazzo</i>. A very courtly seneschal received his card with
  enthusiasm and conducted him into a magnificent room still filled with men
  and women, talking together in animated groups, dancing in a further
  apartment, or listening to soft music in a still more distant one. He led
  Fawley towards a slightly raised floor, and, in a tone which he contrived to
  make almost reverential, announced the visitor. The Principessa, a handsome
  woman of the best Roman type, gave him her lifted fingers and listened
  agreeably to his few words.</p>

  <p>"My husband has told me of your coming," she confided. "It will give him
  pleasure before you leave to have a further word with you. He is showing one
  of the Royal Princes who have honoured us with their presence a famous
  Murillo which came into our family a short time ago...Elida, do not tell me
  you are going to leave us so soon?"</p>

  <p>Fawley glanced around. Some instinct had already told him whom he would
  find standing almost at his elbow. It seemed to him, however, that he had not
  realised until that moment, in the over-heated, flower-scented room, with its
  soft odours of femininity, its vague atmosphere of sensuous disturbance, the
  full subtlety of her attraction. The tension which had somewhat hardened her
  features a few minutes ago had gone. An air of gentle courtesy had taken its
  place. She smiled as though the impending introduction would be a pleasure to
  her.</p>

  <p>"It is Major Martin Fawley, an American of many distinctions which for the
  moment I cannot call to mind," the Princess said. "My, alas, rather distant
  relative, the Princess Elida di Rezco di Vasena."</p>

  <p>The formal introduction with its somewhat Italian vagueness gave Fawley no
  hint as to whether the Princess were married or not, so he contented himself
  with a ceremonious bow. He murmured some commonplace to which she replied in
  very much the same fashion. Then a newcomer presented himself to the Princess
  and the latter turned away to greet him. Fawley found himself involuntarily
  glancing at his companion's feet. She was elegantly shod in bronze slippers
  but the bronze and the lemon colour were not an ideal combination.</p>

  <p>"It is your fault," she reminded him gently. "In a short time I hope that
  you will see me properly shod. Tell me your news. There seem to be no rumours
  about."</p>

  <p>Her coolness was almost repelling and Fawley felt himself relieved by the
  gleam of anxiety in her eyes. The reply, however, which was framing upon his
  lips became unnecessary. It seemed as though both became aware of a certain
  fact at the same moment. Within a few feet of them, but so placed that he was
  not directly in their line of vision, stood the man whom all Italy was
  beginning to fear. General Berati, very impressive in his sombre uniform,
  very much alive, was watching the two with steady gaze.</p>

  <p>"Princess," Fawley said, determined to break through the tenseness of
  those few seconds, "I am wondering whether I have had the happiness to meet
  one of your family. There was a Di Vasena riding some wonderful horses in the
  show at San Remo last year. I met him at a friendly game of polo
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"My brother," she exclaimed, with a quick smile of appreciation. "I am
  glad that you remembered him. He is my favourite in the family. You are like
  all your country-people, I suppose, and the English too&mdash;very fond of
  games."</p>

  <p>"We have less opportunity nowadays for indulging in them," Fawley
  regretted.</p>

  <p>"You would say that I speak in&mdash;what is the English
  word?&mdash;platitudes, if I suggested that you had been driven to the
  greater amusements?"</p>

  <p>"There is truth in the idea, at any rate," Fawley admitted.</p>

  <p>She turned and touched the arm of a young uniformed soldier who was
  standing near by.</p>

  <p>"You remember Major Fawley, Antonio?" she asked. "He met you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, at San Remo. Naturally I do," the young man interrupted. "We played
  polo afterwards. The Ortini found us ponies and I remember, sir," he went on,
  with a smile, "that you showed us how Americans can ride."</p>

  <p>"I shall leave you two together for a time," Elida announced. "I have to
  make my adieux. Rome is suffering just now, as your witty Ambassador remarked
  the other day," she observed, "from an epidemic of congested hospitality.
  Every one is entertaining at the same time."</p>

  <p>She passed on, made her curtsey to royalty and lingered for a moment with
  her hostess. Fawley exchanged a few commonplaces with Di Vasena and
  afterwards took his leave. He looked everywhere for his Chief, but Berati was
  nowhere to be found. It seemed almost as though he had sprung out of the
  earth to watch the meeting between his would-be assassin and Fawley, and
  then, having satisfied himself, disappeared.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Caf&eacute; of the Shining Star could have existed
  nowhere but in Rome, and nowhere in Rome but in that deserted Plaza Vittoria,
  with its strange little pool of subdued lights. Its decorations were black,
  its furniture dingy but reminiscent of past magnificence. A broad staircase
  ascended from the middle of the sparsely occupied restaurant and from the
  pillars supporting it were suspended two lights enclosed in antique lanterns.
  As Fawley entered, a weary-looking <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> came
  forward, bowed and without wasting words pointed to the stairs.</p>

  <p>Madame, the <i>patrona</i>, from behind a small counter where, with her
  head supported between her hands, she studied the pages of her ledger, also
  glanced up and, with a welcoming smile, pointed upwards. Fawley mounted the
  stairs to a room in which barely a dozen people were seated at small
  tables&mdash;people of a class which for the moment he found it difficult to
  place. At the farther end of the room, at a table encircled by a ponderous
  screen, he found the Princess. A dour-looking woman standing patiently by her
  side fell back on his arrival.</p>

  <p>"Sit down if you please, Major Fawley," Elida begged him. "I have ordered
  wine. You see it here. Drink a glass of it or not, as you please. It is very
  famous&mdash;it has been in the cellars of this caf&eacute; for more years
  than I have lived&mdash;or perhaps you."</p>

  <p>Fawley obeyed her gestured invitation, seated himself opposite to her and
  poured out two glasses of the clear amber wine. She laughed a toast across at
  him.</p>

  <p>"You come in a good humour, I trust," she said. "You know at least that I
  am not an ordinary assassin. Perhaps I am sorry already that I raised my hand
  against my relation-in-law. He is on the point, I fear, of making a great
  mistake, but to kill&mdash;well&mdash;perhaps I was wrong."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear you say so," Fawley murmured.</p>

  <p>"You have brought the slipper?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought the slipper," he acknowledged. "It has, in fact, never
  left my possession."</p>

  <p>"You will give it to me?" she exclaimed, holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will give it to you," Fawley assented.</p>

  <p>The tips of her fingers tapped hard against the tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"I cannot wait," she prayed. "Give it to me now."</p>

  <p>"There are terms," Fawley warned her.</p>

  <p>Disappointment shone in her eyes. Her lips quivered. For a moment his
  attention wandered. He was thinking that her mouth was the most exquisite
  thing he had ever seen. He was wondering&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do not keep me in suspense, please," she begged. "What terms do you speak
  of?"</p>

  <p>"You will not find them difficult," he assured her, "especially as you
  have confessed just now that you are not an assassin at heart. Listen to my
  proposition."</p>

  <p>"Proposition," she sighed, her eyes once more dancing. "I am intrigued.
  Will you commence? I am all eagerness."</p>

  <p>"Fold your hands in front of your bosom and swear to me that you will not
  repeat this afternoon's adventure and you shall have your slipper."</p>

  <p>She held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"Please place them exactly as you desire."</p>

  <p>Fawley crossed them. Like white flowers they were&mdash;soft and fragrant,
  with nails showing faintly pink underneath but innocent of any disfiguring
  stain of colour. She repeated after him the few words which form the sacred
  oath of the Roman woman. When she had finished, she treated him to a little
  grimace.</p>

  <p>"You are too clever, my chivalrous captor," she complained. "Fancy your
  being able to play the priest. And now, please, the slipper."</p>

  <p>Fawley drew it from his pocket and laid it upon the table. The exquisite
  paste buckle with the strangely set crown flamed out its brilliant colouring
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"You regret the buckle?" she asked. "It is very beautiful and very
  valuable. It is quite authentic too. There is Medici blood in my veins. That,
  I suppose, is why I have the impulse to kill!"</p>

  <p>A single lamp stood upon the table, with a worn shade of rose-coloured
  silk. Except for its rather fantastic and very dim illumination, they sat
  amongst the shadows. Her hand touched his, which still rested upon the
  slipper.</p>

  <p>"You will give it to me?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I shall give it to you," Fawley agreed, "but please do not think that the
  buckle or even the fact that you have worn it are the only things I have
  found precious."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked fearfully.</p>

  <p>Fawley lifted the delicate inner sole of the slipper and looked up. Their
  eyes met across the table. She was breathing quickly.</p>

  <p>"You have read it?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Naturally."</p>

  <p>"You are keeping it?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I am returning it to you."</p>

  <p>A wave of relief drove the tension from her face. She seemed for the
  moment speechless. The paper which he handed across the table found its way
  almost mechanically into the jewelled handbag by her side.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," he went on gravely, "you must not hope for too much. I
  am in the service of Berati. I must tell him what I found in the slipper of
  the woman who tried to kill him."</p>

  <p>"You will tell him who it was?"</p>

  <p>"I think that I am wrong, but that I propose to forget," he told her. "You
  have probably made many men forget themselves in your brief years, Princess.
  You will make many more. What I read, I shall communicate to Berati. The
  source of my information I shall keep to myself. Take the slipper."</p>

  <p>Her hands were drawing it off the table but, as though by accident, they
  passed over Fawley's and he felt their shivering warmth. There was a softer
  light in her eyes than he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"Princess&mdash;Elida&mdash;" he whispered.</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him but Fawley swung suddenly around in his chair.
  Patoni, stark and sinister, was standing by the side of the screen, looking
  in. His smile was one of composed malevolence.</p>

  <p>"I beg a thousand pardons," he apologised, with a stiff little bow. "I am
  here on a mission of great importance."</p>

  <p>Fawley rose to his feet. He was as tall as Patoni and at that moment his
  face was as hard and set.</p>

  <p>"It is part of your Italian manners," he asked, "to play the spy in this
  way?"</p>

  <p>"I have offered you my apologies," was the cold retort. "A quarrel between
  us is not possible, Major Fawley. I am still of the Church and I do not fight
  duels. I am compelled to ask you to accompany me without a moment's delay to
  the Generalissimo."</p>

  <p>"The Princess&mdash;" Fawley began.</p>

  <p>"Has her duenna," Patoni interrupted.</p>

  <p>Elida leaned forward and suddenly clasped Fawley's hand. He seemed somehow
  to have grown in stature, a man on fire with anger and without a doubt
  dangerous. Even the two <i>carabinieri</i> standing behind Patoni looked at
  him with respect.</p>

  <p>"Please go," she begged. "Please go with Prince Patoni, my friend. My car
  is waiting, my servant is here. I need no escort. I wish so much that you do
  as I ask."</p>

  <p>Fawley bent over her hands and touched them with his lips. Then he turned
  and left the room with Patoni.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In a life full of surprises Martin Fawley was inclined to
  doubt whether he had ever received a greater one than when, for the second
  time during the same day, he was ushered into the presence of General Berati,
  the most dreaded man in Rome. Gone was the severe high-necked and
  tight-waisted uniform; gone the iciness of his speech and the cold precision
  of his words. It was a tolerable imitation of a human being with whom Fawley
  was confronted&mdash;a dark-haired, undersized but sufficiently good-looking
  man dressed in a suit of apparently English tweeds, stretched at his full
  length upon the sofa of a comfortable sitting room leading out of his bureau,
  reading the <i>New York Herald</i> and with something that looked
  suspiciously like a Scotch whisky and soda by his side. He threw down his
  paper and welcomed his visitor with a grim cordiality.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Major," he invited. "I will offer you a whisky and soda as soon
  as you tell me exactly whom you found on the other side of that door."</p>

  <p>Fawley accepted the chair to which his host had pointed.</p>

  <p>"May I take the liberty," he begged, "of asking a question first?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Berati answered with unabated good humour. "This is an
  unofficial conversation. Proceed."</p>

  <p>"Where did you disappear to after that first shot?"</p>

  <p>Berati chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I give audiences too easily," he confided, "and for that reason, I have
  several little contrivances of my own invention. Some day I will show you
  this one. There is a button on my desk which I touch, the rubber floor upon
  which I sit disappears, and so do I, into the room below. I should explain
  perhaps that it is only a drop of a few feet and the end is what you call in
  England a feather bed. And now the answer to my question, please."</p>

  <p>Martin Fawley was probably as near complete embarrassment as ever before
  in his life. He hated the position in which he found himself. He hated what
  he was about to do. He kept his countenance but he was bitterly mortified as
  he felt for a secret pocket inside his coat and silently withdrew his
  cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"General Berati," he said, "I feel thoroughly ashamed of myself and I
  shall merit what you will doubtless think of me. At the same time, do
  remember this&mdash;I am to some extent a mercenary in your service. I allow
  myself that amount of excuse. It was a woman who fired the shot and, as you
  see, I am handing back my papers."</p>

  <p>"This is most intriguing," Berati observed. "I gather then that you refuse
  to tell me her name?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly," Fawley replied, "I believe you know it already but, all the
  same, you are right: I refuse to tell you her name. I have been in your
  service for the matter of a few hours, I see you nearly killed, I know who
  fired the shot and I am not going to tell you who it was."</p>

  <p>"Capital," Berati exclaimed. "Just what I should have expected from you.
  Put back your cigarette case, my young friend. After all, you probably saved
  my life, for, thanks to you, there was no second shot."</p>

  <p>"You know who it was?" Fawley asked, a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly well," Berati confided. "I joined my wife's guests," he went
  on, "chiefly for the pleasure of seeing whether you showed any embarrassment
  when you were presented to a certain one of our Roman beauties. My
  congratulations, Major. You have some of the gifts necessary in our
  profession, at any rate. Let me offer you a whisky and soda."</p>

  <p>Fawley thanked him and helped himself. Berati's intonation as well as his
  manner seemed to have become curiously Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>"Listen, my friend," he continued, "when an attempt is made upon my life,
  I never, if I can help it, allow anything to appear in the journals. You do
  not wish to give away a beautiful lady any more than I want to admit to the
  indignity of having been nearly wiped off the earth by so frail an
  instrument."</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, that you are a very brave and a very forgiving man," Fawley
  declared, with an impulsiveness which was absolutely foreign to his
  character.</p>

  <p>Berati laughed almost gaily.</p>

  <p>"No man," he said, "who is in touch with the great affairs of the world
  can afford to be made ridiculous. An attempt on my life by my wife's niece,
  by the Princess Elida, is a thing to smile at. Nevertheless," he went on, his
  tone becoming a trifle graver, "I have reason to believe that the Princess
  was carrying with her a paper of some importance."</p>

  <p>"She was," Fawley admitted.</p>

  <p>"You discovered it?" Berati snapped out with a trace of his former
  manner.</p>

  <p>"I discovered it," Fawley confessed. "Its purport is at your
  disposal."</p>

  <p>"And the paper?"</p>

  <p>"I returned it to the Princess."</p>

  <p>Berati's air of <i>bonhomie</i> temporarily disappeared. He scowled.</p>

  <p>"An amazing act of gallantry at my expense," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"Bad enough in my position, I admit, but not quite as bad as it seems,"
  Fawley pointed out. "I have already told you that the purport of that paper
  is at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"It was signed by one who used to bear a great name in Germany?" Berati
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It was," Fawley assented.</p>

  <p>"And in return for certain action on your part you were
  offered&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you specifically, if you like."</p>

  <p>Berati shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A copy of the proposed agreement reached me ten minutes ago. My mind is
  not made up. I have decided to wait until you have visited Germany. Your
  reports from there will influence me. At present I have an open mind. The
  Princess Elida has been bitterly disappointed," he went on, "by what she
  thought was a point-blank refusal on my part. She believes that I lean
  towards Behrling. She has the usual woman's fault&mdash;she jumps at
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>"Is it permitted to ask what your intentions are with regard to the
  Princess?"</p>

  <p>Berati grunted.</p>

  <p>"Nothing venomous, I can assure you. I do not make war on women. She is
  now on her way to Vienna in the safest of my airships. I regret the necessity
  for such discipline, but she will not be allowed to cross the frontier again
  for a year. This need not disturb you, my friend, for I doubt whether you
  will spend much of your time in this country. You will recognise the fact, I
  am sure, that however much I may choose to risk in the way of danger, I
  cannot afford to be made ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"I think that you have behaved very generously," Fawley declared.</p>

  <p>Berati rose to his feet and touched the bell.</p>

  <p>"The car in which you arrived is waiting for you, Fawley," he announced.
  "Your place is taken in the night train for Monte Carlo. You have thirty-five
  minutes. Good luck to you. Carlo," he added in Italian, to the servant who
  had answered the bell, "show this gentleman to his automobile. He goes to the
  Central Railway Station. By the by, Fawley, your luggage has all been
  registered and your small things put in your compartment. Once
  more&mdash;good night and good luck to you."</p>

  <p>Fawley lingered for a moment until the servant was out of hearing.</p>

  <p>"How do you propose to communicate with me, General?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Concerning that you need not worry," was the bland reply. "I do not
  approve of the telephone or the telegraph and I like even less letters which
  go through the post. Live your own perfectly natural life. Some day you will
  find in your salon a blue envelope."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The blue envelope!</p>

  <p>Fawley threw down the tennis racquet he had been carrying, turned the key
  in the lock of his sitting room door at the H&ocirc;tel de France and moved
  swiftly to the writing table on which the letter had been placed. He tore it
  open, read it very deliberately&mdash;for it was in a somewhat curious cipher
  which he had only just committed to memory&mdash;and then, lighting a match,
  watched it slowly consume to ashes. Afterwards he lingered for a few minutes
  on his balcony, looking up towards the misty peaks eastwards of Mont Agel. He
  no longer regretted the fortnight's idleness, the nonappearance of Krust, the
  almost stagnant calm of his days. He had thoroughly established himself as a
  leisure-loving American with a passion for games. He now busied himself at
  the telephone, cancelling a few social engagements, for Fawley, reserved
  though he was by habit, was a man always sought after.</p>

  <p>"A few days' golf up at Sospel," he told every one, after he had packed
  his clothes.</p>

  <p>He wondered a little grimly whither those few days' golf would lead him.
  Perhaps to the same place as Joseffi, who had been found in the gardens with
  a bullet through his heart and a revolver by his side, but who had never been
  known to enter the Casino in his life.</p>

  <p>"You are not leaving us, sir?" the <i>valet de chambre</i> enquired, as he
  answered the bell.</p>

  <p>"Only for a few days," Fawley assured him. "I am keeping on my rooms."</p>

  <p>"You are not leaving us, Major Fawley, I trust," the smiling and urbane
  manager asked him in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Only for a few days," Fawley repeated. "I am going to explore your</p>

  <p>hills and try another golf links. Back about Sunday, I should think. Keep
  my letters."</p>

  <p>"I wish you a pleasant and successful expedition," the manager remarked,
  with a final bow.</p>

  <p>Fawley's smile was perhaps a little enigmatic. He waved his hand and drove
  off without further speech.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Fawley, some five days later, driving his high-powered Lancia car through
  one of the many passes of the lesser Alps between Roquebrune and the
  frontier, suddenly swung around a corner to find himself confronted by a
  movable obstruction of white freshly painted rails and an ominous notice. A
  soldier in the uniform of the Chasseurs Alpins stepped forward, his rifle at
  a threatening angle.</p>

  <p>"There is no road this way, Monsieur," he announced curtly.</p>

  <p>Fawley, who had brought his car to a standstill, leaned forward and
  produced a map. He addressed the soldier in his own language.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he protested, "I fancy that you are mistaken. You have
  blocked the wrong road. This is clearly marked in the latest edition of the
  issued maps as a Number Two road between Hegel and the village of Les
  Estaples."</p>

  <p>"Your map is of no consequence," the man replied. "This road was taken
  over by the military some time ago. There is no passage here for
  civilians."</p>

  <p>A sergeant, who had been sitting on a rock amongst the sparse pine trees
  smoking a cigarette, scrambled down to them.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur desires to use this route," his subordinate confided. "I have
  told him that it exists now only for military purposes. He must return the
  way he came."</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est exact</i>," the sergeant declared. "Where were you bound for by
  this route, Monsieur?"</p>

  <p>Fawley leaned from his seat.</p>

  <p>"I have been told," he replied confidentially, "that your army is thinking
  of erecting military works here. I wish to discover how far that is the
  truth."</p>

  <p>The sergeant stared at him. So did the private. So did the young
  lieutenant, who had just ridden up on a high-spirited horse in time to hear
  the end of the sentence.</p>

  <p>"What is the reason for Monsieur's desire to gain this information?" he
  asked, wheeling around so that he completely blocked the road.</p>

  <p>"I might reply that that is my affair," Fawley declared. "I really do not
  see why I should be questioned in this fashion. I have a map in my hand which
  clearly indicates this as a public thoroughfare."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant made a sign. The sergeant mounted on one footboard, the
  private on the other.</p>

  <p>"Go backwards in reverse," Fawley was ordered. "Take the narrow turning to
  the right about thirty metres back."</p>

  <p>"Where will it lead me?" Fawley asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"You will find out when you get there," was the curt reply. "If you
  hesitate, I shall have to ask you to consider yourself under arrest."</p>

  <p>Fawley, grumbling to himself all the time, obeyed orders. He found
  himself, after a climb of a couple of kilometres along a road which commenced
  in villainous fashion, but whose latter portion was smooth and beautifully
  engineered, in front of a recently built, white stone house, around which a
  considerable clearing had been made. A sentry stood in front of the door. The
  lieutenant who had galloped on ahead had disappeared into the house. Fawley
  rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Is this where I get out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, you remain where you are," the sergeant replied gruffly.
  "Our lieutenant is now interviewing the commandant."</p>

  <p>Fawley lit a cigarette and gazed down the avenue of fallen pines to the
  broken country beyond, the bare peaks fading into the mist with the
  background of snow-capped ridges incredibly near.</p>

  <p>"A trifle wild here," Fawley remarked. "You seem to have cut down a great
  many trees. You use a lot of timber in the army, I suppose."</p>

  <p>The sergeant maintained a scornful silence. The private grinned. The
  horizon was suddenly blurred. A few flakes of sleet began to fall.</p>

  <p>"Any objection to my putting up the hood?" Fawley asked, shivering.</p>

  <p>The sergeant pointed to the house.</p>

  <p>"You will be warm enough in there," he said. "Monsieur le Lieutenant is
  coming to fetch you."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant approached them and motioned Fawley to descend.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Dumesnil would like a word or two with you, Monsieur," he
  announced. "Will you be so good as to come this way. Sergeant!"</p>

  <p>The sergeant's instructions were unspoken but obvious. He walked by
  Fawley's side and the steel of his unsheathed bayonet was very much in
  evidence. Fawley turned up his coat collar and swore softly.</p>

  <p>"I shall never find my way down through this labyrinth of passes, if you
  keep me here much longer," he grumbled. "Why does your commandant wish to
  speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"That you will soon discover," the lieutenant answered shortly. "Let me
  advise you to answer his questions politely and without complaint. The
  colonel is not noted for his good temper. This way, please."</p>

  <p>Fawley was ushered into what might have been an orderly room. Colonel
  Dumesnil looked up from his task of studying a pile of maps and watched the
  newcomer keenly. The former was a short man, whose spurred riding boots
  scarcely reached the floor, but his face was stern and his steel-grey eyes
  and tone were alike menacing.</p>

  <p>"Will you explain, sir, what you are doing on a military reservation?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I was following a road which is marked on my map as an ordinary civilian
  thoroughfare," Fawley explained. "I had a perfect right to be where I
  was."</p>

  <p>"That, sir, one might easily dispute," was the cold reply. "All the roads
  around here are well known by the handful of scattered residents to be under
  military supervision. I must ask you what you are doing in this part of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"There is no secret about it," Fawley answered blandly. "I have been
  trying to discover the extent and nature of the new French
  fortifications."</p>

  <p>No more unexpected reply could have been given. There was a dead silence.
  The colonel's face remained immovable but there was an ominous tapping of his
  fingers upon the desk.</p>

  <p>"For what reason?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If you insist upon knowing, I suppose I had better tell you," he said,
  "but I don't want the thing to get about. There are some golf links about
  twelve kilometres from here at a place called Sospel. I have taken a great
  fancy to them and to the hotel, and as I have a little capital to invest, I
  thought of buying the lot. The one thing which makes me hesitate is that no
  one is willing or able to tell me where the new French fortifications and gun
  emplacements are situated, and until I know that, I feel that my property
  might be utterly destroyed in case of war."</p>

  <p>There was a further silence. Another officer who might have been the
  colonel's aide-de-camp crossed the room and whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"You have corroborative evidence of what you are telling me?" the Colonel
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Any quantity," Fawley assured him confidently. "The mayor of the
  district, the committee of the old golf club, the late hotel proprietor and
  owner of the land, half the village of Sospel."</p>

  <p>"Your name and passport."</p>

  <p>Fawley produced identification papers from his pocket and handed them
  across. The Colonel examined them and his face relaxed.</p>

  <p>"As an ex-military man, Major Fawley," he said, with a certain severity
  still in his tone, "you should have known that yours was a very dangerous
  enterprise. You should have applied to the authorities for any information
  you desired."</p>

  <p>"I thought, as mine was a civil enterprise," Fawley argued, "they might
  not notice me. All that I need is a little general information."</p>

  <p>"There is none to be given," was the brusque reply. "Escort this gentleman
  to our boundaries, Lieutenant, and let me warn you, sir, not to be found in
  this locality again. This is from no lack of courtesy, Major Fawley. It is a
  matter of military necessity which I am amazed that you should not already
  have realised and respected."</p>

  <p>Fawley suffered himself to be led away. A soldier escorted him to the
  nearest village, where he descended at the local caf&eacute; and accepted</p>

  <p>without hesitation a ten franc note to be spent there. He refused,
  however, to answer the slightest question respecting the geography of the
  neighbourhood and regarded with evident suspicion Fawley's few tentative
  enquiries.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has been generous," were his parting words, as he stood outside
  the caf&eacute;. "He would be wise to listen to a word of advice. Strangers
  are sometimes treated generously, as Monsieur has been, on their first visit
  to the nest in the mountains. The second visit means the cold steel or the
  swift bullet. The bones of more than one too curious person will be found in
  the secret places of the mountains yonder, when the world comes to an
  end."</p>

  <p>He pointed up beyond the pass which they had descended. A stern
  inhospitable line of country it was, with great declivities and huge
  fragments of rock split by the slow fires of eternity. Fawley shivered a
  little as he stepped back into the car.</p>

  <p>"I shall not forget, my brave fellow," he declared. "Drink a glass for me.
  I am best out of the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>The soldier grinned. Nevertheless, there was something serious in his
  expression behind the grin.</p>

  <p>"<i>Monsieur est un homme prudent</i>," was his only comment.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley, a few nights later, lay on his stomach in the midst
  of a crumpled heap of undergrowth on almost the topmost spur of the range of
  mountains eastward from Mont Agel and very little below the snow line. He was
  on the edge of a recently made clearing and the air was full of the odour of
  the sawn pine trunks lying about in every direction. The mists rolled over
  his head and the frozen rain stung his cheeks and pattered against his
  leather clothes. It was the third moonless night of his almost concluded
  enterprise and there remained only one unsolved mystery. The six galleries
  were there, visualised before his eyes. He knew the connecting points of each
  one and the whereabouts of most of the amazing battery of guns. He knew the
  entrances and roughly the exits to each. His work had been done with genius
  and good fortune, yet it was incomplete. The seventh gallery! The key to all
  the positions. The seventh gallery which must hold the wonder gun. Its exact
  whereabouts still eluded him.</p>

  <p>The night before, the storm which had swept the mountains bare, which had
  driven even the guards and sentries into shelter, had been a godsend to him.
  In the roar of the elements and that blinding deluge of rain, the crashing of
  the trees and the hissing of the wind through the undergrowth and along the
  ground, he had abandoned caution. He had tramped steadily round from post to
  post. He had been within a few yards of the Colonel's headquarters. He had
  even laid his hand on one of the guns, but it was not the gun he sought. He
  had worked it all out, though, by a process of elimination. The main gallery,
  the control station and the supreme mystery, which was probably the mightiest
  anti-aircraft gun in the world, must be somewhere within a radius of about a
  hundred yards of where he was. It was information invaluable as it stood, but
  Fawley, through these long hours of darkness and peril, had conceived an
  almost passionate desire to solve the last enigma of this subterranean
  mountain fortress. The howling of the wind, which the night before had been
  his great aid, obscuring all sound and leaving him free to roam about in the
  darkness in comparative safety, was now, he felt, robbing him of his chance.
  The special body of men of whom he was in search&mdash;he had discovered that
  many hours ago&mdash;worked only in the darkness, so that even the
  woodcutters should know nothing of their doings. They must be somewhere near
  now...There were great piles of cement lying within fifty feet of where he
  was, barrels of mortar, light and heavy trucks. Somewhere close to him they
  must be working...</p>

  <p>This business of listening grew more hopeless. One of the trees in the
  wood, on the outskirts of which he lay, was creaking and roaring, like a wild
  animal in pain. He raised himself slowly and carefully on one side and by
  straining his eyes he could catch the outlines of its boughs, stretched out
  in fantastic fashion like great arms. He even heard the splinters go. Then,
  for the first time, he fancied he heard&mdash;not one voice but a hum of
  voices! His whole body stiffened&mdash;not with fear but with the realisation
  of danger. The voices seemed to come from below. He raised himself a little
  more, almost on to his knees. His eyeballs burned with the agony of the
  fruitless effort to penetrate the darkness. Below! In his brain, at any rate,
  there was light enough. He remembered the somewhat artificial appearance of
  the great masses of undergrowth amongst which he lay. Perhaps this Number
  Seven tunnel was underneath! Perhaps in seeking for shelter he had crept into
  a ready-made ambush. Then for some time he ceased to think and action became
  almost automatic.</p>

  <p>Nothing in the orchestra of the howling wind, the crashing trees and the
  hollow echoes amongst the grim mountains had produced sound such as now
  seemed to split his eardrums. Within a few feet of him came a crash which
  blotted out the whole world with a great barrier of sound. He felt his cheeks
  whipped, his body thrashed, the sense of an earthquake underneath
  him&mdash;the sense of falling.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1201891h-images/TheSpyParamount3.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>It took him only a second or two to realise what was happening. Within a
  few yards of him, the tree which he had been watching had given up its fight
  with the rising wind and had crashed through the artificial roof on which he
  lay, down into the space below. He, too, was falling, as the branches and
  shrubs on either side subsided. He fell with his mind quite clear. He saw two
  men in the familiar uniform of the Chasseurs Alpins, their faces convulsed
  with amazed fear, flung to the ground by the trunk of the tree. It fell upon
  them so that Fawley, even in those wild seconds of excitement, was obliged to
  close his eyes. Their shrieking and yelling was all over in a moment...Fawley
  himself fell sideways on to the platform of a smooth and shining cylindrical
  erection which was unlike anything he had ever seen before. There was nothing
  to which he could cling and almost at once he slid down on to the cement
  floor. Opposite him was the most astonished human being he had ever
  seen&mdash;a soldier, who had run to the assistance of the other two and was
  suddenly faced with the consciousness of Fawley's amazing appearance.</p>

  <p>"<i>Sacr&eacute; nom de Dieu!</i>" he called out, wringing his hands.
  "What is it then that has arrived? Is it an earthquake? Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Stay where you are. Don't raise your hands."</p>

  <p>One last sobbing cry echoed from wall to wall of the passage. Fawley took
  one look under the tree and then turned his back.</p>

  <p>"They are dead," he said. "You cannot help them. Listen. Is this gallery
  Number Seven?"</p>

  <p>The chasseur, incapable of speech, pointed to the wall. There it
  was&mdash;a great sprawling seven.</p>

  <p>"Which is the way out?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>The youth&mdash;he was scarcely more than a boy&mdash;was shivering so
  that words were almost impossible. He pointed in a certain direction. Fawley
  drew an automatic from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he threatened, "if you have lied, I shall come back and shoot
  you."</p>

  <p>The chasseur pointed again. His face was white. He looked almost as though
  he had had a stroke. His head was bleeding where one of the boughs had struck
  him. The tree lay like a great destroying octopus all over the place. Only
  one thing seemed to have survived untouched. The great machine with its metal
  cylinders and huge dynamos, which might well have been some devilish
  contrivance of the nether world.</p>

  <p>"Where do you come from?" the youth asked.</p>

  <p>Fawley raised his weapon. He had completely recovered his
  self-control.</p>

  <p>"No more questions," he said curtly. "Give me your belt."</p>

  <p>The soldier obeyed. Fawley's hand seemed as steady as a rock and the
  revolver, though small, was an ugly-looking affair.</p>

  <p>"Put your hands out. Fold them together."</p>

  <p>Again the chasseur obeyed. Fawley tied them; then, leaning forward, he
  struck him lightly but firmly near the chin.</p>

  <p>"That is for your good," he said, as his victim stumbled backwards.</p>

  <p>He turned away and crawled down the passage. There was no sentry but the
  wind had ceased its sobbing for a moment and from the road came the sound of
  voices and the hurrying of feet. Fawley, bent double, made his way through
  the rough piece of waste ground towards the edge of the precipice. Something
  seemed to have created an alarm and shots came from behind him to which he
  paid no attention. A bullet whistled over his head. He only smiled. At the
  edge of the precipice he steadied himself: six hundred feet to scramble.
  Well, he had done it before. He fell flat just in time to escape another
  bullet and then, with gloved hands and protected by his thick leather
  clothes, he commenced the wild descent. Sometimes his feet slipped and he
  heard the crashing of the small boulders and stones which he had dislodged.
  He felt himself falling through space but each time a bump in the ground, or
  a bush, or a young pine sapling saved him. Once he hung over an absolutely
  sheer precipice, his legs dangling in the air, the trunk of the tree he
  clasped cracking and splintering in his hands. He pulled himself up again,
  made a little d&eacute;tour and felt the ground rise beneath his feet. As he
  descended lower and lower, the wind and rain grew less, the cold decreased.
  The time came when he found himself standing upright on the solid earth.
  Below him long stretches of wood still lay like black smudges of fallen
  clouds, but for a time, at any rate, he had reached a rough path down which
  he was able to scramble without difficulty. He took one pull at his flask
  and, in a dark spot with trees all around, one quick glance at his compass
  with the help of his torch. A sparsely planted wood was a godsend to him. He
  swung himself from trunk to trunk of the trees, his feet secure in the thick
  accumulation of pine needles below. When he emerged, it was to face a
  flickering light from a small hamlet already astir. Before daybreak, he was
  in his car, clad in a rough knickerbocker suit, smoking a pipe, leaning
  nonchalantly back in his seat and already well on his way down the great
  descent to the sea.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Monsieur Carlotti, the very popular manager of the H&ocirc;tel de France,
  was taking his usual morning promenade in the lounge of the hotel when Fawley
  drove up and entered. He welcomed his returning guest with a beaming
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has found the weather inclement, I fear," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Fiendish," was the emphatic reply. "No more of your mountains for me,
  Monsieur Carlotti. I have finished with them. Cagnes may be dull golf but it
  will be good enough for me."</p>

  <p>Carlotti's eyes twinkled with comprehension.</p>

  <p>"The telephones have been busy this morning," he observed. "There has been
  a great deal of disturbance and still is at the frontiers. The weather again,
  without a doubt."</p>

  <p>Fawley nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall not trouble the frontiers," he confided. "A few quiet days in
  this warmth will suit me better."</p>

  <p>Carlotti bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is good news for us," he declared. "If by chance," he added, as the
  two men neared the lift, "Monsieur should be in need of a golfing companion,
  there is a Mr. Krust here who would like a game."</p>

  <p>"Fix it up for me," Fawley replied. "To-morrow or the next day&mdash;as
  soon as the weather gets decent."</p>

  <p>The little man remained below, smiling and bowing. Fawley mounted to his
  apartments upon the second floor. The valet, whom he met in the corridor,
  threw open the doors and shutters.</p>

  <p>"There have been telephone enquiries for Monsieur," he announced, pointing
  to some slips upon the table. "No letters."</p>

  <p>"A hot bath&mdash;quickly," Fawley ordered. "As soon as you have turned
  the water on, find the waiter and order coffee&mdash;a large
  pot&mdash;<i>caf&eacute; complet</i>."</p>

  <p>The valet bustled off. Fawley strolled into the room twenty minutes later
  in his dressing gown, a different man. The coffee was steaming upon the
  table, a delicious fragrance was in the air. He ordered more rolls and
  butter. In the act of serving himself, he stopped abruptly. Upon his writing
  table, in a prominent position, was a blue envelope. He called to the
  valet.</p>

  <p>"Henri," he pointed out, "that letter was not on my table when I went to
  my bath a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Certainly it was not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who has been in the room?"</p>

  <p>"No one, sir, except the waiter who brought the coffee."</p>

  <p>Fawley turned to the latter who had just reappeared.</p>

  <p>"Did you bring that note?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"<i>Non, Monsieur</i>," he replied. "I have not seen it before. Ten
  minutes ago when I first came it was not there."</p>

  <p>Fawley made no further remark. He possessed himself of the note and turned
  to the valet.</p>

  <p>"Send me the <i>coiffeur</i>," he ordered, "in twenty minutes. Afterwards
  you might put me out a grey tweed suit and flannel shirt."</p>

  <p>"No golf or tennis to-day, sir?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head. The man disappeared. Fawley poured out the coffee
  with his right hand. His left palm lay over the letter in the blue envelope.
  Just at that moment, without any previous warning, there came an almost
  peremptory knocking at the inside door of the salon.</p>

  <p class="first">Fawley's left hand conveyed the letter in the blue envelope
  to the safe recesses of his pocket. His right hand continued its task of
  pouring out the coffee.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he invited.</p>

  <p>The door was promptly opened. The person who stood upon the threshold was
  one of the most harmless-looking elderly gentlemen possible to conceive. He
  was inclined to be stout but his broad shoulders and erect carriage somewhat
  discounted the fact. He was possessed of a pink and white complexion, eyes of
  almost a China blue and shortly cropped grey hair. He wore a grey
  knickerbocker suit and carried in his hand a hat of the same colour of quaint
  design.</p>

  <p>"I have the pleasure to address Major Fawley, is it not so?" he began in a
  clear pleasant voice with a slight foreign accent. "I was hoping to present a
  letter of introduction but it arrives late. My name is Krust."</p>

  <p>"Adolf Krust?" Fawley asked, rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>"The same," was the cheerful rejoinder. "You have heard of me, yes?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Fawley replied. "Any one who takes an interest in European
  politics must have heard of Adolf Krust. Come in and sit down, sir."</p>

  <p>The visitor shook hands but hesitated.</p>

  <p>"This is not a formal visit," he said. "I ventured to look in to ask if
  you would care to play golf with me to-day. I have heard of you from a mutual
  friend, besides this letter of introduction of which I spoke."</p>

  <p>"That is quite all right," Fawley assured him. "You have had your coffee,
  I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"At seven o'clock," the other answered. "What I wished to explain was that
  I am not alone. My two nieces are with me. It is permitted to ask them to
  enter?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," Fawley assented. "I hope they will excuse my rather
  unconventional attire."</p>

  <p>"They are unconventional themselves," Krust declared. "Nina!"</p>

  <p>Two young women entered at once. They wore the correct tweed clothes of
  the feminine golfer but they gave one rather the impression of being dressed
  for a scene in a musical comedy. Their b&eacute;rets were almost too perfect
  and the delicacy of their complexions could scarcely have survived a
  strenuous outdoor life. They were, as a matter of fact, exceedingly pretty
  girls.</p>

  <p>"Let me present Major Fawley," Krust said, waving his hand. "Miss Nina
  Heldersturm&mdash;Miss Greta M&uuml;ller."</p>

  <p>Fawley bowed, shook hands with the young women, apologised for his costume
  and disposed of them upon a divan.</p>

  <p>"We owe you apologies," Krust went on, "for descending upon you like this,
  but the fact of it is our rooms are all upon this floor. I
  ventured&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not another word, please," Fawley begged. "I am very glad indeed to meet
  you, Mr. Krust, and your charming nieces."</p>

  <p>"We go to golf," Krust declared. "These young ladies are too frivolous for
  the pursuit. I myself am a serious golfer. It has been said of me that I take
  my nieces with me to distract my opponents!"</p>

  <p>"We never say a word," one of the young ladies protested.</p>

  <p>"We really have very good golf manners," the other put in. "If we are
  allowed to walk round, we never speak upon the stroke, we never stand in any
  one's line and we always say 'hard luck' when any one misses a putt."</p>

  <p>"You have been well trained," Fawley approved.</p>

  <p>"To serious conversation they are deaf," Krust confided. "They have not a
  serious thought in their brains. How could it be otherwise? They are
  Bohemians. Nina there calls herself an artist. She paints passably but she is
  lazy. Greta has small parts at the Winter Garden. Just now we are all in the
  same position. We are out of harness. Our worthy President has put me
  temporarily upon the shelf. Nina is waiting for a contract and Greta has no
  engagements until the summer. We were on our way to Italy&mdash;as perhaps
  you know."</p>

  <p>Krust's suddenly wide-opened eyes, his quick lightning-like glance at
  Fawley almost took the latter aback.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea of the fact," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I wish to go to Rome. It was my great desire to arrive there
  yesterday.</p>

  <p>A mutual friend of ours, however, said 'No.' A politician cannot travel
  incognito. My business, it seems, must be done at second hand."</p>

  <p>"It is," Fawley ventured, "the penalty of being well known."</p>

  <p>Krust stroked his smooth chin. His eyes were still upon Fawley.</p>

  <p>"What our friend lacks," he observed, "is audacity. If it is dangerous for
  me to be in a certain place, I call for the photographers and the
  journalists. I announce my intention of going there. I permit a picture of
  myself upon the railway platform. What a man is willing to tell to the whole
  world, the public say, can lead nowhere. One succeeds better in this world by
  bluff than by subtlety."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to play golf with this talkative old gentleman?" Greta
  asked, smiling at Fawley in heavenly fashion. "We love him but we are a
  little tired of him. We should like a change. We should like to walk round
  with you both and we promise that our behaviour shall be perfect."</p>

  <p>Fawley reflected for a moment. He had the air of a man briefly weighing up
  the question of an unimportant engagement but actually his mind had darted
  backwards to the seventh gallery in the mountains. Step by step he traced his
  descent. He considered the matter of the changed cars&mdash;the ancient Ford
  lying at the bottom of the precipice; his Lancia, released from its place of
  hiding in a desolate spot, into which he had clambered in the murky twilight
  after dawn. His change of clothes in a wayside barn. The bundle which lay at
  the bottom of a river bed in the valley. Civilian detectives perhaps might
  have had a chance of tracing that intruder from the hidden galleries, but not
  military police. If he crossed the frontier now into, say, Switzerland or
  Germany, he would be weeks ahead of the time and only a trivial part of his
  task accomplished. The decision which he had intended to take after more
  leisurely reflection he arrived at now in a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>"If you will wait while I get into some clothes and see my
  <i>coiffeur</i>, I shall be delighted," he accepted.</p>

  <p>Greta flashed at him a little smile of content which left him pondering.
  Krust picked up his hat and glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"At eleven o'clock," he pronounced, "we will meet you in the bar below.
  Rudolf shall mix us an Americano before we start. There is no need for you to
  bring a car. The thing I have hired here is a perfect omnibus and will take
  us all."</p>

  <p>"Where do we play?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a fine morning," the other pointed out. "The glass is going up. The
  sun is shining. I will telephone to Mont Agel. If play is possible there,
  they will tell me. If not, we will go to Cagnes."</p>

  <p>"In the bar at eleven o'clock," Fawley repeated as he showed them
  out...</p>

  <p>Fawley was an absent-minded man that morning. When he submitted himself to
  the ministrations of the <i>coiffeur</i> and valet, his thoughts travelled
  back to his interview with Berati and travelled forward, exploring the many
  byways of the curious enterprise to which he had committed himself. Krust
  occupied the principal figure in his reflections. With the papers daily full
  of dramatic stories of the political struggle which seemed to be tearing out
  the heart of a great country, here was one of her principal and most
  ambitious citizens, with an entourage of frivolity, playing golf on the
  Riviera. Supposing it were true, as he had hinted, that his presence was due
  to a desire to visit Berati, why had Berati gone so far as to refuse to see
  him&mdash;a man who might, if chance favoured him, become the ruler of his
  country? Berati had known of his presence here, had even advised Fawley to
  cultivate his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the gentleman who was in here when you arrived&mdash;Monsieur
  Krust?" he asked his <i>coiffeur</i> abruptly.</p>

  <p>The man leaned forward confidentially.</p>

  <p>"I shave him every morning, sir," he announced. "A very great German
  statesman and a millionaire. They say he could have been President if
  Hindenburg had retired. Every one is wondering what he is doing here with
  things in such a turmoil at home."</p>

  <p>"He seems to have good taste in his travelling companions," Fawley
  observed.</p>

  <p>The <i>coiffeur</i> coughed discreetly.</p>

  <p>"His nieces, sir. Charming young ladies. Very popular too, although the
  old gentleman seldom lets them out of his sight. My wife," the man went on,
  dropping his voice a little, "was brought up in Germany. She is German, in
  fact. She knows the family quite well. She does not seem to remember these
  young ladies, however."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how long he is staying," Fawley meditated.</p>

  <p>"Only yesterday morning," the man confided, "he told me that he was
  waiting for news from home which might come at any moment. He is rung up
  every morning from Germany. He brought his own private telephone instrument
  and had it fitted here. He has spoken to Rome once or twice too. It is my
  belief, sir, that he is up to some game here. From what I can make out by the
  papers, he is just as well out of Germany while things are in this mess. He
  has plenty working for him there."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Fawley observed indifferently. "... Just a snip
  on the left-hand side, Ernest," he went on, glancing into the mirror.</p>

  <p>"The usual time to-night, sir?" the man asked, stepping back to observe
  his handiwork.</p>

  <p>His customer nodded. For several moments after the <i>coiffeur</i> had
  left him, he remained in his chair, glancing into the mirror. He was utterly
  free from vanity and his inspection of himself was purely impersonal.
  Something to thank his ancestry for, he reflected. No one, to look at him,
  would believe for a moment the story of his last night's adventures; would
  believe that he had been for hours in peril of his life, in danger of a
  chance bullet, in danger of his back to a wall and a dozen bullets concerning
  which there would be no chance whatever; in danger of broken limbs or a
  broken neck, committing his body to the perils of the gorges and precipices
  with only a few feet between him and eternity. There were lines upon his
  healthy, slightly sunburnt face with its firmly chiselled features and bright
  hard eyes, but they were the lines of experiences which had failed to age.
  They were the lines turning slightly upwards from his mouth, the fainter ones
  at the corners of his eyes, the single furrow across his forehead. Life and
  his forebears had been kind to him. If he failed in this&mdash;the greatest
  enterprise of his life&mdash;it would not be his health or his nerve that
  would play him false. The turn of the wheel against him might do it... Below
  him the people were streaming into the Casino. He smiled thoughtfully as he
  reflected that amongst these worshippers of the world-powerful false goddess
  he was the one man of whom a famous American diplomat praising his work had
  declared, "Fawley never leaves anything to chance."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Several minor surprises were in store for Fawley that
  morning. On the first tee, having to confess to a handicap of two at St.
  Andrews, and Krust speaking of a nebulous twenty, he offered his opponent a
  stroke a hole, which was enthusiastically accepted. Fawley, who had an easy
  and graceful swing, cut his first drive slightly but still lay two hundred
  yards down the course, a little to the left-hand side. Krust, wielding a
  driver with an enormous head, took up the most extraordinary posture. He
  stood with both feet planted upon the ground and he moved on to his toes and
  back on to his heels once or twice, as though to be sure that his stance was
  rigid. After that he drew the club head back like lightning, lifted it barely
  past his waist and, without moving either foot from the ground in the
  slightest degree and with only the smallest attempt at a pivot, drove the
  ball steadily down the course to within twenty yards of Fawley's. The latter
  tried to resist a smile.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Krust do that every time?" he asked Greta, who had attached
  herself to his side.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "And you need not smile about it," she enjoined. "You wait
  till the eighteenth green."</p>

  <p>For eleven holes Krust played the golf of an automatic but clumsy machine.
  Only once did he lift his left heel from the ground and then he almost missed
  the ball altogether. The rest of the time he played every shot, transforming
  himself into a steady and immovable pillar and simply supplying all the force
  necessary with his arms and wrists. At the eleventh, Fawley, who was two
  down, paused to look at the view. They all stood on the raised tee and gazed
  eastwards. The sting from the snow-capped mountains gave just that peculiar
  tang to the air which seems to supply the alcohol of life. Facing them was a
  point where the mountains dropped to the sea and the hillside towns and
  villages boasted their shelf of pasture land above the fertile valleys.
  Fawley turned towards the north. It was like a dream to remember that less
  than eleven hours ago he was committing his body to the mercies of those
  seemingly endless slopes, clutching at tree stumps, partially embedded rocks,
  clawing even at the ground to brake his progress.</p>

  <p>"The frontier is over that way," Krust remarked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"What? Into Italy?" Greta demanded.</p>

  <p>"Into Italy," Fawley replied. "A strange but not altogether barbarous
  country. Have you ever visited it?"</p>

  <p>She indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to be superior, please," she begged. "Americans and English
  people are always like that. I studied in Milan for two years."</p>

  <p>"I was only chaffing, of course," Fawley apologised.</p>

  <p>"And I," Nina confided, tugging at Krust's arm, "have worked in Florence.
  This dear uncle of mine sent me there."</p>

  <p>A warning shout from behind sent them on to the tee. In due course the
  match was finished and Fawley tasted the sweets of defeat.</p>

  <p>"I think," he told his companion good-humouredly, "that you are the most
  remarkable golfer I have ever seen."</p>

  <p>Krust smiled all over his face.</p>

  <p>"With a figure like mine," he demanded, "what would you do? I have watched
  others. I have seen how little the body counts. Only the arms and wrists. I
  turn my body into a monument. I never move my head or my feet. If I do, I
  fail. It is an idea&mdash;yes? All the same, it is not a great amusement. I
  get stiff with the monotony of playing. I miss the exercise of twisting my
  body. Now you pay me the price of a ball and I stand drinks for everybody and
  lunch to follow."</p>

  <p>"The loser pays for lunch," Fawley declared cheerfully. "I accept the
  cocktails, warning you that I am going to drink two."</p>

  <p>"And I also," Greta remarked. "I must console myself for my partner's
  defeat!"</p>

  <p>Luncheon was a pleasant meal. They sat in the bald undecorated restaurant
  with its high windows, out of which they seemed in incredibly close touch
  with the glorious panorama of snow-capped hills rolling away to the
  mists.</p>

  <p>"There is no worse golf course in the world," Krust declared
  enthusiastically, "but there is none set in more beautiful surroundings. My
  heart is heavy these days, but the air here makes me feel like a boy. I make
  of life a failure&mdash;I come here with the disappointed cry of the people I
  love in my ears and I can forget."</p>

  <p>"We help," Nina pleaded softly, laying her hand upon his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you help," he admitted, with a curiously clouded look in his blue
  eyes. "Youth can always help middle age. Still, it remains a terrible thing
  for a man of action to remain idle. Would it break your hearts, my two little
  beams of sunshine, if we packed our trunks and sailed away northwards?"</p>

  <p>"It would break mine," Greta declared, touching Fawley's hand as though by
  accident.</p>

  <p>"And mine," Nina echoed.</p>

  <p>That was the last of serious conversation until they descended some short
  time after luncheon into the Principality. In the hall of the hotel Fawley
  handed his golf clubs to the porter and took his leave somewhat abruptly. He
  had scarcely reached his room, however, before there was a knock at the door.
  Krust entered. Fawley welcomed him a little grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry if I hurried away," he apologised, "but I really have work to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Five minutes," Krust begged. "I understand something of your profession,
  Major Fawley. I passed some time in our own Foreign Office. For the moment,
  though, it happens that I must disregard it. I have not the temperament that
  brooks too long delay. Answer me, please. Our friend in Rome spoke to you of
  my presence here? Did he give you any message, any word as to his
  decision?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," Fawley replied cautiously. "To tell you the truth, I
  don't know what you are talking about."</p>

  <p>A flaming light shone for a moment in the cold blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"That is Berati&mdash;the Italian of him&mdash;the over-subtlety! The
  world is ours if he will make up his mind, and he hesitates between
  me&mdash;who have more real power in Germany than any other man&mdash;and one
  who must be nameless even between us; but if he leans to him our whole great
  scheme will go 'pop' like an exploded shell. Were you to make reports upon
  me? To give an opinion of my capacity?"</p>

  <p>"I had other work to do here," Fawley said calmly. "I was simply told to
  cultivate your acquaintance. The rest I thought would come later."</p>

  <p>"It may come too late," Krust declared. "Berati cannot trifle and twiddle
  his thumbs forever. Listen, Major Fawley. How much do you know of what is on
  the carpet?"</p>

  <p>"Something," Fawley admitted. "Broad ideas. That's all. No details.
  Nothing certain. I am working from hand to mouth."</p>

  <p>"Listen," Krust insisted. "There is a scheme. It was Berati's, I admit
  that, although it came perhaps from a brain greater than his&mdash;some one
  who stands in the shadows behind him. It called for a swift alliance between
  Germany and Italy. An Anglo-Saxon neutrality. Swift action. Africa for Italy.
  A non-military Germany but a Germany which would soon easily rule the world.
  And when the moment comes to strike, Berati is hesitating! He hesitates only
  with whom to deal in Germany. He dares to hesitate between one who has the
  confidence of the whole German nation, and a man who has been cast aside like
  a pricked bladder, whose late adherents are swarming into my camp, and the
  man whose name, were it once pronounced, would be the ruin of our scheme. And
  he cannot decide! I have had enough. I am forbidden to approach
  Berati&mdash;courteously, firmly. Very well. By to-morrow morning I come back
  to you with the truth."</p>

  <p>Fawley was mystified. He knew very well that his companion was moved by a
  rare passion but exactly what had provoked it was hard to tell.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Herr Krust&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>It was useless. The man seemed to have lost control of himself. He stamped
  up and down the room. He passed through the inner and the outer doors leading
  into the corridor. A few moments later Fawley, from his balcony, saw the huge
  car in which they had driven up to Mont Agel circle round by the Casino and
  turn northwards...Fawley, with a constitution as nearly as possible perfect
  for his thirty-seven years, felt a sense of not altogether unpleasant
  weariness as he turned away from the window. His night of strenuous
  endeavour, physical and mental, his golf that morning in the marvellous
  atmosphere of Mont Agel, had their effect. He was suddenly weary. He
  discarded his golf clothes, took a shower, put on an old smoking suit and
  threw himself upon the bed. In five minutes he was asleep. When he awoke, the
  sunshine had changed to twilight, a twilight that was almost darkness. He
  glanced at his watch. It was seven o'clock. He had slept for three hours and
  a half. He swung himself off the bed and suddenly paused to listen. There was
  a light shining through the chink of the door leading into his salon. He
  listened again for a moment, then he opened the first door softly and tried
  the handle of the second only to find it locked against him. Some one was in
  his salon surreptitiously, some one who had dared to turn his own key against
  him! His first impulse was to smile at the ingenuousness of such a
  proceeding. He thrust on a dressing gown, took a small automatic from one of
  the drawers of his bureau, stole out into the corridor and knocked at the
  door of the sitting room. For a moment or two there was silence. Whoever was
  inside had evidently not taken the</p>

  <p>trouble to prepare against outside callers. A sound like the crumpling of
  paper had ceased. The light went out and was then turned on again. The door
  was opened. Greta stood there, taken utterly by surprise.</p>

  <p>"A flank movement," he remarked coolly, closing the door behind him. "Now,
  young lady, please tell me what you are doing in my sitting room and why you
  locked the door against me."</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

  </div><br>

  <p>She was speechless for a moment. Fawley crossed the room and stood on the
  other side of the table behind which she had retreated. His eyes travelled
  swiftly round the apartment. A large despatch box of formidable appearance
  had been disturbed but apparently not opened. One of the drawers of his
  writing desk had been pulled out.</p>

  <p>"Is this an effort on your own behalf, Miss Greta," he continued, "or are
  you trying to give your uncle a little assistance?"</p>

  <p>"You are not very nice to me," she complained pathetically. "Are you not
  pleased to find me here?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered, "that depends."</p>

  <p>She threw herself into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Are you angry that I have ventured to pay you a visit?" she
  persisted.</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"If only the visit were to me! On the other hand, I find myself locked out
  of my own salon."</p>

  <p>"Locked out," she repeated wonderingly. "Just what do you mean? So far
  from locking you out, I was wondering whether I dared come and disturb
  you."</p>

  <p>He moved across towards the double doors and opened them without
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>"H'm, that's odd," he observed, looking around at her quickly. "I tried
  this inner door just now. It seemed to me to be locked."</p>

  <p>"I, too, I found it stiff," she said. "I first thought that you had locked
  yourself in, then I found that it gave quite easily if one turned the key the
  right way."</p>

  <p>"You have been into my bedroom?"</p>

  <p>She smiled up into his face.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind? My uncle has gone away&mdash;no one knows where. Nina has
  gone motoring with a friend to Nice. I am left alone. I do not like being by
  myself. I come along here, I knock softly at the door of your sitting room.
  No reply. I enter. Emptiness. I think I will see if you are sleeping. I open
  both those doors without any particular difficulty. I see you lying on the
  bed. I go softly over. You sleep&mdash;oh, how you were sleeping!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes met Fawley's without flinching. There stole into his brain a
  faint recollection that some time during that deep slumber of his there had
  come to him a dreamlike suggestion of a perfume which had reminded him of the
  girl, a faint consciousness, not strong enough to wake him, of the presence
  of something agreeable. She was probably telling him the truth.</p>

  <p>"I had not the heart to wake you," she went on. "I stole out again. I sat
  in your easy-chair and I waited."</p>

  <p>"I perceive," he pointed out, "that a drawer of my writing table is open
  and that my despatch box has changed its position."</p>

  <p>Her eyes opened a little wider.</p>

  <p>"You do not think that I am a thief?"</p>

  <p>"How can I tell? Why did you open that drawer?"</p>

  <p>"To find some note paper. I thought that I would write some letters."</p>

  <p>"Why did you move my despatch box?"</p>

  <p>"For the same purpose," she assured him. "I found it locked, so I left it
  alone. Do you think that I came to steal something? Can you not believe that
  I came because I was lonely&mdash;to see you?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he admitted, "I cannot see what else you could
  have come for. I have no secrets from Mr. Krust."</p>

  <p>"But you have," she exclaimed impetuously. "You will not tell him what he
  so much wants to know."</p>

  <p>"So that is why you are here," Fawley remarked, with a faint smile. "You
  want to see if you can find out for your uncle Berati's disposition towards
  him, and you think that I may have papers. My little butterfly lady, you are
  very much an amateur at this sort of thing, aren't you? Men do not carry
  papers nowadays. It is too dangerous. Besides, who am I to see what lies
  behind Berati's mind?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you that I care nothing about Berati," she cried suddenly. "I was
  weary of being alone and I came to see you."</p>

  <p>She moved across and stood beside him. She was wearing some sort of
  neglig&eacute;e between golf and dinner costume, something in one piece with
  vivid flashes of scarlet and wide sleeves, and her arm rested affectionately
  upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Please do not be horrid to me," she begged. "Mr. Krust has been very kind
  to me. If we could help him&mdash;either Nina or I&mdash;we should do so, but
  not at your expense."</p>

  <p>"You would have no chance, little Greta," he told her, with a very gentle
  caress. "Since we seem to be arriving at an understanding, tell me what I can
  do for you."</p>

  <p>"First of all," she said, drawing her arm tighter around him, "try to
  believe that I am not the frivolous little idiot I sometimes try to appear.
  Secondly, believe also that when I came here this afternoon, the great thing
  in my mind was to see you, not to be like one of the adventuresses of fiction
  and pry about for papers; and thirdly, as I am left all alone, I thought
  perhaps you might take pity on me and ask me to dine&mdash;just you and I
  alone&mdash;only much later."</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window, over which the curtains had not yet been
  drawn, at the flashing lamps of the square, and further away at the lights
  stealing out from the black curtain of the shrouded hillside.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he protested, "you are inviting me to flirt with you."</p>

  <p>"Is it so difficult?" she whispered. "I am much nicer than you think I am.
  I am much fonder of you than you could believe."</p>

  <p>"It would not be difficult at all," he assured her. "But alas, how would
  you feel when I told you, as I would have to very soon, that most of the time
  when I am not thinking of more serious things I spend thinking of another
  woman?"</p>

  <p>She stood quite still and he had a queer fancy that the soft palm which
  she had stretched out upon his cheek grew colder. It was several moments
  before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I would be sorry," she confessed. "But, after all, the days are past when
  a man thinks only of one woman. It was beautiful to read of and think of, but
  one scarcely hopes for it now. Who is she, please?"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" he answered. "I am not sure that I trust her any
  more than I trust you. The truth of it is I am a clumsy fellow with women. I
  have lived so long with the necessity of trusting no one that I cannot get
  out of the habit of it."</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I can be truthful," she said earnestly. "With you I would like to be. It
  was not writing paper I searched for in your drawer and if I could have
  opened your box, I should have done so. I have a bunch of keys in my
  pocket."</p>

  <p>"But what is it you are hoping to find?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Krust," she said, "thinks that you must know towards which party in
  Germany Berati is leaning. He thinks that you must know the reason why he is
  not allowed to go to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Supposing I assured you," he told her, "that I have not the faintest idea
  what lies behind Berati's mind. He has not asked my advice or given me his
  opinion. I have learnt more from Mr. Krust than from him. I have not a single
  paper in my possession which would interest you in any way. If I might make a
  wild guess, it would be that Berati is afraid that Krust might gain access to
  and influence the greater man who stands behind him."</p>

  <p>"Is that the truth?" she asked fervently.</p>

  <p>"It is the honest truth," he assured her. "You see, therefore, that I am
  useless, so far as regards your schemes. Realising that, if you would like to
  dine with me, I should be delighted."</p>

  <p>"If you want me to," she consented eagerly. "I believe you think that I am
  very terrible. Perhaps I am, but not in the way you imagine. Do you want me
  to dine with you, Major Fawley? Would it give you pleasure?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it would," he answered. "I warn you that I am a very wooden
  sort of person but I am all alone for to-night, at any rate, and you are not
  an unattractive young woman, are you?"</p>

  <p>She smiled a little oddly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I do not know," she said. "I do not think that unless a clever man
  has a flair for women, we girls have much to offer. What time, please?"</p>

  <p>"Nine o'clock," he decided. "You shall tell me about Germany and the life
  there. I am rather curious. I find the political parties almost impossible to
  understand. You may make a disciple of me!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she murmured, as she took her very reluctant leave, "we might
  find something even more interesting to talk about than German politics."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley felt that fate treated him scurvily that evening.
  Some great European notable staying in the H&ocirc;tel de France had taken it
  into his head to entertain the local royalty, who seldom if ever was seen in
  public, and Greta and he had scarcely established themselves at their corner
  table before, amidst a buzz of interest, a very distinguished company of
  guests made their way towards the magnificently beflowered and ornamented
  table which had been reserved for them. There were princes and princesses in
  the gathering, dukes and duchesses, men and women of note in every walk of
  life and&mdash;Elida. She came towards the end of the procession, walking
  side by side with a famous English diplomat, and she passed within a yard or
  two of Fawley's table. For the moment he was taken unawares. He half rose to
  his feet, his eyes even sought hers, but in vain. If she was surprised at
  seeing him there and under such circumstances, she gave no sign. She passed
  on without a break in her conversation, easily the most distinguished-looking
  figure of the party, in her plain black frock and her famous pearls.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful woman," Greta sighed, "and I believe that you know
  her."</p>

  <p>Fawley, who had recovered from his momentary aberration, smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "once upon a time I knew her&mdash;slightly."</p>

  <p>"What will she think of you?" Greta reflected. "I wonder how long it is
  since you have met. Will she think that you have married, or that, like every
  one else who comes to this quaint corner of the world, you have brought with
  you your favourite companion?"</p>

  <p>"She probably won't think of me at all," Fawley replied. "We only met for
  one day and ours was rather a stormy acquaintance, as a matter of fact."</p>

  <p>"She is more beautiful than I am," Greta confessed na&iuml;vely. "She
  looks very cold, though. I am not cold. I have too much heart. I think that
  is the pity about Germans. We are abused all over the world, I know, but we
  are too sentimental."</p>

  <p>"Sentimentality is supposed to be one of your national characteristics,"
  Fawley observed, "but I do not think your menkind, at any rate, allow it to
  stand in the way of business&mdash;of their progress in life, perhaps I
  should say."</p>

  <p>"Adolf Krust is sentimental," she continued, "but with him all his
  feelings seem to be centred on his country. He loves women, but they mean
  little to him. He is what I call a passionate patriot. At any cost, anyhow,
  he wants to see Germany stand where she did amongst the nations."</p>

  <p>"Almost the same with you, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not quite. Very few women in the world have ever put love of country
  before love of their lover. I suppose we are too selfish. I am fond of
  Germany, although I see her faults, but she could not possibly occupy all my
  affections."</p>

  <p>"You are rather intriguing, aren't you?" he remarked. "I should like to
  know you better."</p>

  <p>"Ask me questions, then," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"Where were you educated?"</p>

  <p>"In London, Paris, Dresden, a short time for my voice in Milan. I may be
  anything you like to fancy, but I have never known poverty."</p>

  <p>"And Krust&mdash;he is really your uncle?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"We are on rather delicate ground," she remarked, "because Nina is in
  this, of course. No, he is not our uncle. Nina and I have both developed a
  passion for politics. Nina worked for some time in a public office without
  salary. It was through her that I became interested. Now I honestly believe
  politics&mdash;we use the word in Germany in a broader sense than you
  do&mdash;has become the great interest of my life. I want Krust to be
  Chancellor and, more still, I want him, when the proper time comes, to decide
  how Germany shall be governed."</p>

  <p>"What about the President?"</p>

  <p>"A stupid office. One man is enough to rule any country. If he fails, he
  should be either shot or deposed. Adolf Krust is the only man whom the great
  mass of Germans would trust. What we need in Central Europe is a shock.
  People would make up their minds then quickly. At present we are drifting.
  That is why Krust, who hates to leave his work for a moment, who hates games
  and the sunshine of foreign places and gambling and all recreations, has come
  down here to be nearer to the one man who seems to hold the fate of Europe in
  his hand just now. He will be disappointed. I feel that. His rival has
  powerful agents at work in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I am a little confused about German affairs," Fawley confessed. "Who is
  his rival?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him for permission and lit a cigarette. Their dinner had
  been well chosen and excellently served but she had eaten sparingly. She took
  a long draught of champagne, however.</p>

  <p>"Heinrich Behrling."</p>

  <p>"The communist?" Fawley exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Behrling is no communist. He is not even a socialist. He is the apostle
  of the new Fascism."</p>

  <p>"Krust then?"</p>

  <p>"If I am telling you secrets," she said, "I shall be very ashamed of
  myself. I do not think, though, that Adolf Krust would mind. He has tried to
  make a confidant of you. Krust is for the re&euml;stablishment of the
  monarchy."</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" Fawley murmured. "I thought that General von Salzenburg was the
  head of the aristocratic party."</p>

  <p>"So does he," she replied simply. "This is our trouble, you see. We are
  not united. Come to Berlin and you may find out. Why do you not get Berati to
  give you a freer hand? Then I think that we could convince you."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear child," Fawley protested, "I am nothing to General Berati. I
  am just an agent who was out of work, whom he has trusted to make a few
  observations. I have never even met his chief. I am a subordinate without any
  particular influence."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You may deceive yourself or you may think it well to deceive me," she
  said. "Adolf Krust would never believe it."</p>

  <p>"By the by," Fawley asked, "where has your reputed uncle hurried off
  to?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me so little and you expect me to tell you everything," she
  complained. "He has gone to San Remo to telephone to Berati. If Berati
  permits it, he will go on to Rome&mdash;that is what he is so anxious to do.
  To go there and not be received, however, would ruin his cause. The other
  side would proclaim it as a great triumph. Von Salzenburg, too, would be
  pleased."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a very fair grasp of events," Fawley remarked, as they
  entered upon the last course of their dinner. "Tell me, do you believe in
  this impending war?"</p>

  <p>Again she showed signs of impatience. She frowned and there was a distinct
  pout upon her full but beautifully shaped lips.</p>

  <p>"Always the same," she exclaimed. "You ask questions, you tell nothing and
  yet you know. You take advantage of the poor little German girl because she
  is sentimental and because she likes you. Ask me how much I care and I will
  tell you. What should I know about wars? Ask a soldier. Ask them at the Quai
  d'Orsay. Ask them at Whitehall in London. Or ask Berati."</p>

  <p>"Those people would probably tell me to mind my own business," Fawley
  declared.</p>

  <p>Her eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"It is a very good answer."</p>

  <p>They had coffee in Fawley's salon&mdash;an idea of Greta's. She wanted to
  be near, if Adolf Krust should return in despair. But time passed on and
  there was no sign of Krust. They sat in easy-chairs, watching the lights in
  the gardens and listening to the music from across the way. They sat in the
  twilight that they might see Krust's car more easily, should it put in an
  appearance. Conversation grew more spasmodic. Fawley, he scarcely knew why,
  was suddenly tired of speculations. The great world over the mountains was
  moving on to a crisis&mdash;that he knew well enough&mdash;but his brain was
  weary. He wondered dimly whether for the last few years he had not taken life
  too seriously. Would any other man have felt the fatigue he was feeling? He
  half turned his head. The outline of the girl in her blue satin frock was
  only just visible. The vague light from outside was shimmering in her hair.
  Her eyes were seeking for his, a little distended, as though behind their
  sweetness there lay something of anxious doubt. The swift rise and fall of
  her slim breasts, the icy coldness of her hand resting lightly in his, seemed
  to indicate something of the same emotion. Her fingers suddenly gripped his
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so difficult?" she asked. "You do not like me, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he assured her, "I like you very much. I find you very
  attractive but far too distracting."</p>

  <p>"How distracting?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because, as we all know&mdash;you and I and the others&mdash;" he went
  on, "love-making is not part of our present scheme of life. It might
  complicate it. It would not help."</p>

  <p>"All the time you reason," she complained. "It is not much that I ask. I
  make no vows. I ask for none. I should like very much, as we say in Germany,
  to walk hand in hand with you a little way in life."</p>

  <p>"To share my life," he reflected, "my thoughts, and my
  work&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>There was a tinge of colour in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Leave off thinking," she cried almost passionately. "Many men have lost
  the sweetest things in life through being choked with suspicions. Cannot
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was commotion outside. The opening of a door, heavy footsteps, a
  thundering knocking at the inner door flung open almost immediately. Krust
  entered, out of breath, his clothes disarranged with travel, yet with
  something of triumph dancing in his blue eyes. He was carrying his heavy
  spectacles, he flung his hat upon the table and struggled with his coat.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he exclaimed, "and little Greta! Good. I wanted to speak to
  you both. Listen. I have talked with Berati."</p>

  <p>"You are to go to Rome?" Fawley demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have abandoned the idea," Krust declared. "For the moment, it is not
  necessary. There is another thing more important. I say to Berati&mdash;'Give
  me a trusted agent, let him visit the places I shall mark down, let him leave
  with me for three days in Berlin and then let him report to you. No rubbish
  from inspired newspapers with Jew millionaires behind them. The truth! It is
  there to be seen. Give me the chance of showing it.' I spoke of you, Fawley,
  indefinitely, but Berati understood. Oh, he is swift to understand, that man.
  To-morrow you will have your word. To-morrow night you will leave for
  Germany. I ask pardon&mdash;for half an hour I spoke on the private wire at
  the Royal H&ocirc;tel in San Remo. From there I jump into the car and we have
  driven, I can tell you that we have driven! You excuse?"</p>

  <p>A waiter had entered the room with two bottles of beer in ice pails and a
  large tumbler. Krust filled it to the brim, threw back his head and drank. He
  set down the glass empty.</p>

  <p>"It is good news which I bring?" he asked Fawley anxiously. "You are
  satisfied to come?"</p>

  <p>Fawley's eyes travelled for a moment to the dark line of mountains beyond
  Roquefort. There had been rumours that the French were combing the whole
  Principality, looking for a spy. Monsieur Carlotti had spoken of it lightly
  enough, but with some uneasiness. Fawley tapped a cigarette upon the table
  and lit it.</p>

  <p>"A visit to Germany just now," he admitted, "should be
  interesting."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Krust in his own salon an hour later looked curiously across the room to
  where Greta was standing, an immovable figure, at the open window. He had
  rested and eaten since his journey, but there were unusual lines in his
  smooth face and his expression of universal benevolence had disappeared.
  Greta half turned her head. Her tone was almost sullen.</p>

  <p>"You had success with our impenetrable friend?" Krust asked.</p>

  <p>"I did my best," she replied. "You came back too soon."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On his way down to the quay the next morning Fawley read
  again the note which had been brought to him with his morning coffee. It was
  written on the H&ocirc;tel de France note paper but there was no formal
  commencement or ending.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I am very anxious to talk to you privately but not in the hotel, where you
    seem to have become surrounded by an <i>entourage</i> which I mistrust. One
    of my friends has a small yacht here&mdash;the <i>Sea Hawk</i>&mdash;lying
    on the western side of the harbour. Will you come down and see me there at
    half-past eleven this morning? It is very, very important, so do not fail
    me.<br>
    <br>
    E.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The horse's hoofs clattered noisily on the cobbled road fringing the dock.
  Fawley slowly returned the letter to his pocket. It seemed reasonable enough.
  The <i>Sea Hawk</i> was there, all right&mdash;a fine-looking schooner yacht
  flying the pennant of an international club and the German national flag.
  Fawley paid the <i>cocher</i> and dismissed him, walked down the handsome
  gangway and received the salute of a heavily built but smartly turned-out
  officer.</p>

  <p>"It is the gentleman whom Madame la Princesse is expecting?" the man
  enquired, with a strong German accent. "If the <i>gn&auml;diger Herr</i> will
  come this way."</p>

  <p>Fawley followed the man along the deck to the companionway, descended a
  short flight of stairs and was ushered into a large and comfortable cabin
  fitted up as a sitting room.</p>

  <p>"I will fetch the Princess," his guide announced. "The gentleman will be
  so kind as to repose himself and wait."</p>

  <p>Fawley subsided into an easy-chair and took up a magazine. In the act of
  turning over the pages, however, he paused suddenly. For a moment he
  listened. Then he rose to his feet and, crossing the room swiftly, tried the
  handle of the door. His hearing, which was always remarkably good, had not
  deceived him. The door was locked! Fawley stood back and whistled softly
  under his breath. The affair presented itself to him as a magnificent joke.
  It was rather like Elida, he decided, with her queer dramatic gestures. He
  pressed the bell. There was no response. Suddenly a familiar sound startled
  him&mdash;the anchors being drawn up. The Diesel engines were already beating
  rhythmically. A moment or two later they were moving. The grimmer lines in
  his face relaxed. A smile flickered at the corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>"Abducted," he murmured.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the porthole and gazed at the idlers on the quay from
  which they were gliding away. There was a pause, a churning of the sea and a
  swing around. The <i>Sea Hawk</i> was evidently for a cruise. She passed out
  of the harbour and her course was set seawards. Fawley lit a cigarette and
  took up a magazine. It appeared to him that this was a time for inaction. He
  decided to let events develop. In due course, what he had expected
  happened&mdash;there was a knock at the door of the very luxurious and
  beautifully decorated green-and-gold cabin in which he was confined. Fawley
  laid down his magazine and listened. The knock was</p>

  <p>repeated&mdash;a pompous, peremptory sound, the summons of the conqueror
  in some mimic battle determined to abide by the grim courtesies of
  warfare.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" Fawley invited.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a key being turned. The door was opened. A tall,
  broad-shouldered man with sunburnt cheeks and a small, closely cropped yellow
  moustache presented himself. He was apparently of youthful middle age, he
  wore the inevitable mufti of the sea&mdash;blue serge, double-breasted
  jacket, grey flannel trousers and white shoes. He had the bearing of an
  aristocrat discounted by a certain military arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley, I believe?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"You have the advantage of me, sir," was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>"My name is Prince Maurice von Thal," the newcomer announced. "I have come
  for a friendly talk."</p>

  <p>"Up till now," Fawley observed, "the element of friendliness seems to have
  been lacking in your reception of me. Nevertheless," he added, "I should be
  glad to hear what you have to say."</p>

  <p>"Monte Carlo just now is a little overcrowded. You understand me, I dare
  say."</p>

  <p>"I can guess," Fawley replied. "But who are you? I came to visit the
  Princess Elida di Vasena."</p>

  <p>"The Princess is on board. She is associated with me in our present
  enterprise."</p>

  <p>Fawley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he murmured. "I knew that I had seen you somewhere before.
  You were in the party who were entertaining the local royalties last night at
  the H&ocirc;tel de France."</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>Fawley glanced out of the porthole. They were heading for the open seas
  now and travelling at a great speed. On the right was the Rock, with its
  strangely designed medley of buildings. The flag was flying from the palace
  and the cathedral bell was ringing.</p>

  <p>"Many things have happened to me in life," he reflected, with a smile,
  "but I have never before been kidnapped."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a little like musical comedy, doesn't it?" the Prince remarked.
  "The fact is&mdash;it was my cousin's idea. She was anxious to talk to you,
  but the hotel is full of spies and she could think of no safe place in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"I thought there was something fishy about that note," Fawley sighed. "Is
  Princess Elida really on board?"</p>

  <p>"She certainly is," was the prompt reply. "Wait one moment. I will summon
  her. I can assure you that she is impatient to meet you again."</p>

  <p>He stepped back to the doorway and called out her name. There came the
  sound of light footsteps descending from the deck. Elida, in severe but very
  delightful yachting attire, entered the room. She nodded pleasantly to
  Fawley.</p>

  <p>"I hope Maurice has apologised and all that sort of thing," she said. "We
  had no intention of really keeping you here by force, of course, but it did
  occur to us that you might not want to be seen in discussion with us by your
  other friends here."</p>

  <p>"It might have been awkward," Fawley admitted pleasantly. "It is
  humiliating, though, to be whisked off like this. Your designs might have
  been far more sinister and then I should have felt very much like the booby
  who walked into the trap. There is nothing I enjoy so much as a cruise.
  Wouldn't it be pleasanter on deck, though?"</p>

  <p>"As you please," the Prince assented. "There is a little movement but that
  is not likely to hurt any of us. As a matter of form, Major, may I beg for
  your word of honour that you will not seek to call the attention of any
  passing craft to your presence here?"</p>

  <p>"I give it with pleasure," was the prompt acquiescence.</p>

  <p>They found a sheltered divan on the port side of the boat. A white-coated
  steward arranged a small table and appeared presently with a cocktail shaker
  and champagne in an ice pail. The Prince drank the latter out of a tumbler.
  Elida and Fawley preferred cocktails. Caviare sandwiches were served and
  cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"This is very agreeable," Fawley declared. "May I ask how far we are
  going?"</p>

  <p>The Prince sighed.</p>

  <p>"Alas, it can be only a short cruise," he regretted. "The Princess is
  unfortunately commanded to lunch."</p>

  <p>"Then I suggest," Fawley said, "that we commence our conversation."</p>

  <p>Elida leaned forward. She looked earnestly at her opposite neighbour.</p>

  <p>"We want to know, Major Fawley, whether it is true that you are going to
  Germany with Adolf Krust and his two decoys?"</p>

  <p>"We should also," the Prince added, "like to know with what object you are
  visiting that country and whether you are going as the accredited agent of
  Berati?"</p>

  <p>"Would it not be simpler for you to ask General Berati?" Fawley
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"You know quite well," Elida reminded him, "that for the present I am not
  allowed in Italy. Believe me, if I were there, I should find out, but I may
  not go and I know well that my letters here are tampered with. Prince Patoni
  promised me news but nothing has come."</p>

  <p>Fawley reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"How did you know," he asked, "that I was going to Germany?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear man," she protested, "I am, after all, in a small way doing your
  sort of work. I must have a few&mdash;what is it you say in
  English?&mdash;irons in the fire. Adolf Krust, I hear, is hoping for great
  things from the little girl. Are you susceptible, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Fawley looked steadily across at the Princess.</p>

  <p>"I never thought so until about a month ago," he answered. "Since then I
  have wondered."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"If my hair were that wonderful colour and my morals as elastic, do you
  think I could throw a yoke of roses around your neck and lead you into
  Germany myself?"</p>

  <p>"A pathetic figure," Fawley observed. "I will go with you to Germany at
  any time you invite me, Princess. But, I should carry out my work when I got
  there in exactly the way I intend to now."</p>

  <p>"I want you to meet General von Salzenburg," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"The world's fire eater," Fawley remarked.</p>

  <p>"These damned newspapers!" Von Thal exclaimed angrily in his deep bass
  voice. "What is it to be a fire eater? Fire purges the earth. God knows
  Europe needs it!"</p>

  <p>"I am not a pacifist, by any means," Fawley protested, accepting a
  cigarette from Elida. "In the old days war was the logical method of settling
  disputes. There was no question of reparation. The victorious nation cut off
  a chunk of the other's country and everything went on merrily afterwards.
  Those days have gone. War does not fit in with a civilisation the basis of
  which is economic."</p>

  <p>Von Thal stiffened visibly. One could almost feel the muscles swelling
  underneath his coat.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange to hear an ex-army man, as I presume you are, Major
  Fawley, talking in such a fashion," he declared. "To us war is a holy thing.
  It is a means of redemption. It is a great purifier. We shall not agree very
  well, Major Fawley, if you are going to tell us that you are a convert of
  Krust."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to tell you anything of the sort," Fawley replied, helping
  himself to another sandwich. "As a matter of fact, I have had very little
  conversation with Herr Krust. Between our three selves, as the Princess here
  has had proof of it, I am working on behalf of Italy. All I have to do is to
  make a report of the political situation in Germany as I conceive it. The
  rest remains with General Berati and his master. Besides," he went on, "it
  would be very foolish to imagine that my reports would be more than a drop in
  the bucket of information which Berati is accumulating. He is a very sage and
  far-seeing man and he is collecting the points of view of as many people as
  he can."</p>

  <p>Von Thal grunted.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he pronounced, "that our conversation is not approaching a
  satisfactory termination."</p>

  <p>"You see," Elida murmured softly, "our information does not exactly march
  with what you tell us. We believe that Berati is prepared to shape his policy
  according to your report. The great national patriotic party of Germany, to
  which my cousin here and I belong and of which General von Salzenburg is the
  titular chief, is the only party which we believe in, and for our success we
  must have the sympathy of and the alliance with Italy."</p>

  <p>"And war?" Fawley queried gravely.</p>

  <p>"Why should I deny it?" she answered. "And war. You do not know perhaps
  how well prepared Germany is for war. I doubt whether even Adolf Krust knows;
  but we know. War alone will free Germany from her fetters. This time it will
  not be a war of doubtful results. Everything is prearranged. Success is
  certain. Italy will have what she covets&mdash;Africa. Germany will be once
  more mistress of Europe."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Fawley conceded. "You may possibly be right. When I
  get back from Germany, I shall very likely be in a position to tell you so.
  At present, I have an open mind."</p>

  <p>Von Thal poured himself out a glass of wine and drank it. He turned to
  Elida. His expression was unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"This conversation," he said, "has reached an unsatisfactory point. The
  Princess and I must confer. Will you come below with me, Elida?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

  <p>"For what purpose, dear cousin? We cannot stretch this obstinate gentleman
  upon the rack until he changes his mind."</p>

  <p>"Neither," Von Thal said savagely, "can we turn him loose to hobnob with
  Krust to destroy the golden chance of this century. It must be Von Salzenburg
  who signs the treaty with Italy&mdash;never Adolf Krust or any other
  man."</p>

  <p>"That," Fawley observed quietly, "is not for us to decide."</p>

  <p>Von Thal, a mighty figure of a man, took a quick step forward. Elida's arm
  shot out, her fingers pressed against the lapels of his coat.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be done in this fashion, Maurice," she insisted.
  "Major Fawley is our guest."</p>

  <p>"It is not true," Von Thal declared. "He is our prisoner. I, for one, do
  not believe in his neutrality. I believe that he is committed to Krust. He is
  for the bourgeoisie. This is not a private quarrel, Elida. It is not a
  private affair of honour. We must do our duty to the party for which we work,
  for the cause which we have made ours."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me a most unpleasant way of ending a mild argument, this,"
  Fawley ventured. "I told you that I have given no pledges. My mind is not
  made up. It will not be made up until I have visited Germany. I have accepted
  your invitation to discuss the matter. You are displeased with me. What is
  there to be done about it? You are not, I presume, thinking of murder."</p>

  <p>"To kill a man who is an enemy to one's country is not murder," Von Thal
  shouted.</p>

  <p>"To kill a guest," Fawley retorted, "is against the conventions, even
  amongst savages!"</p>

  <p>"You are not a guest," Von Thal denied. "You are the prisoner who walked
  into a trap. That is a part of warfare. It seems to me you are to be treated
  as a man enemy."</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way," Fawley yielded. "Anyway, those are the best
  caviare sandwiches I ever ate in my life."</p>

  <p>Elida laughed softly. She laid her hand upon Von Thal's arm.</p>

  <p>"Maurice," she pleaded, "yours is a hopeless attitude. Major Fawley is too
  distinguished a personage to be treated without due consideration, and I, for
  one, have no wish to see the inside of a French prison."</p>

  <p>"What am I here for, then?" Von Thal demanded angrily. "I prefer deeds to
  words."</p>

  <p>"So do the most foolish of us," Elida murmured. "But the way must be
  prepared. We cannot frighten Major Fawley as we might a weaker man."</p>

  <p>"Our country is worth lying for," Von Thal declared. "Why should we not
  report that Fawley, taking a short cruise with us, slipped and fell
  overboard? No one can say otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley," Elida objected disdainfully, "is not one of those men who
  slip on decks, especially with rails such as we have and in a calm sea. Be
  reasonable, Maurice."</p>

  <p>"I am no damned by the Almighty Jesuit!" Von Thal persisted. "You tell me
  that you have information that Berati has placed his faith in this man. He is
  sending him to Germany to report upon the situation, to choose between Krust,
  Behrling and us, in plain words. Very well. You go on to say that you fear he
  will decide for Krust."</p>

  <p>"I did not go so far as that," Elida protested earnestly. "Only yesterday
  Berati refused to receive Krust. He had to come back from San Remo where he
  went to telephone. He refused to see him or to take him anywhere else for an
  audience. The matter is not decided. Our object with Major Fawley should be
  to get him to promise that we have fair play, that he shall see something of
  our organisations and hear something of our plans as well as Krust's. After
  that will come the time for arguments, and after that, Maurice, but not
  before, might come the time for the sort of action you are
  contemplating."</p>

  <p>She was suddenly more grave. There was a smouldering light in her eyes.
  She turned to face Fawley.</p>

  <p>"If we arrive at that stage," she said, "and we are faced with an
  unfavourable decision, I think I would send the dearest friend or the dearest
  relative I have into hell, if he elected to hand Germany over to the
  bourgeoisie."</p>

  <p>"Better to the Soviet," Von Thal grunted.</p>

  <p>The captain came and spoke to Von Thal in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"It is a mistral which arrives, Your Highness," he announced.</p>

  <p>The Prince rose to his feet and gazed westward. There was a curious bank
  of clouds which seemed suddenly to have appeared from nowhere. White streaks
  of foam danced upon the sea below. Von Thal waved the man aside with a
  muttered word and turned his back upon him.</p>

  <p>"The trouble of this affair," Fawley declared, "is that the Princess has
  formed an exaggerated idea of my influence. I am only a pawn, after all.
  Berati has already a sheaf of reports from Germany. Mine will only be one of
  the many."</p>

  <p>"At the risk of flattering your self-esteem," Elida said, "I will tell you
  that Berati has an extraordinary opinion of your resource and capacity. He
  does not believe that any other man breathing could have obtained for him the
  plan of the new French defences on the frontier with particulars of their
  guns and preserved his life and liberty."</p>

  <p>Fawley laid down his cigarette. For once Elida had scored. He was
  genuinely disturbed.</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather like a fairy tale, Princess."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," she persisted. "It was bad diplomacy on my part, I admit, to
  tell you that, but I could not resist the temptation. You are a clever man,
  Major Fawley, but neither I nor my friends walk altogether in the dark. You
  need not be afraid. Only I and two others know what I have just told you and
  how you communicated with Berati is still a secret to us."</p>

  <p>"Such an enterprise as you have alluded to," Fawley observed, "would have
  been more in my line. I am no politician. That is what neither my Chief nor
  you seem to understand. I will promise what you ask," he went on, after a
  moment's pause. "I shall not travel to Germany with Krust. I will not be
  subject to his influence and I will visit any organisation or meet any one
  you may suggest."</p>

  <p>Von Thal sprang to his feet. There was a sullen look in his face, angry
  words trembling upon his lips. Elida rose swiftly and laid her fingers upon
  his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I forbid you to speak, Maurice," she enjoined. "You hear that? You see, I
  have guessed your thoughts. You would wish to provoke a quarrel with Major
  Fawley by means of an insult. I will not tolerate it. I accept Major Fawley's
  proposition. Remember, I am your superior in this matter. You must do as I
  say."</p>

  <p>She withdrew her hand slowly. The blood seemed to have rushed to Von
  Thal's head. He was by no means a pleasant sight.</p>

  <p>"And if I refuse?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You will be ordered to return to Germany to-night," she told him. "You
  will never again be associated with any enterprise in which I am concerned
  and I shall do my best to discredit you entirely with Von Salzenburg."</p>

  <p>Von Thal hesitated for a moment, then he swung on his heel and strode away
  forward. From their sheltered seats they could see him leaning over the side
  of the boat, regardless of the spray through which they were driving.</p>

  <p>"A nice joy ride you are giving me," Fawley grumbled. "How do you know
  that I am not liable to seasickness?"</p>

  <p>"You do not seem to me to be that sort of person," she answered
  absently.</p>

  <p>They were rolling and pitching now in the trough of a heavy sea.
  Occasionally a wave sent a cloud of spray over their heads. They had turned
  toward the harbour but it was hard to see more than its blurred outline. A
  sailor had brought them oilskins and removed the plates and glasses.</p>

  <p>"We are running in with the wind now," Fawley remarked. "Good thing we
  turned when we did."</p>

  <p>She drew him farther into the shelter. It seemed to him that her fingers
  lingered almost caressingly upon his wrist.</p>

  <p>"If only you and I," she sighed, "could be on the same side."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I should be an improvement upon your present fellow
  conspirators," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Maurice, as I dare say you know," she told him, "is a nephew of Von
  Salzenburg. He has the reputation of being a fine soldier."</p>

  <p>"These fine soldiers," Fawley grunted, "are always a terrible nuisance in
  civil life. What the mischief is he up to now?"</p>

  <p>Conditions had changed during the last few moments. They were only about a
  hundred yards from the entrance to the harbour but they seemed to be taking
  an unusual course which laid them broadside to the heavy seas. Two sailors
  were busy lowering one of the dinghies. Elida pointed towards the wheel. The
  Prince had taken the captain's place, he had thrown off his oilskins and
  coat, and was standing up with the wheel in his hand, his broad ugly mouth a
  little open, his eyes fixed steadily upon the narrow entrance to the
  harbour.</p>

  <p>"He is mad!" Elida exclaimed.</p>

  <p>A great wave broke over them, smashing some of the woodwork of the deck
  lounge and sending splinters of glass in every direction. People were
  running, dimly visible shrouded figures, through the mist and cloud of rain
  to the end of the pier. There were warning shouts. The captain gripped Von
  Thal by the arm and shouted indistinguishable words. Maurice's right hand
  shot out. The man staggered back and collapsed half upon the deck, half
  clinging to the rails. Once again they mounted a wave which for a few seconds
  completely engulfed them.</p>

  <p>"Maurice is running straight for the sea wall," Elida gasped.</p>

  <p>"In that case," Fawley exclaimed, tearing off his coat, "I think we will
  make for the dinghy."</p>

  <p>There was suddenly a terrific crash, a splintering of wood all around
  them, a crashing and screeching of torn timbers. They seemed to be up in the
  air for a moment. Von Thal, who had left the wheel, came dashing towards
  them. The deck seemed to be parting underneath their feet. Fawley drew the
  girl closer into his arms, her wet cheeks were pressed to his. For a period
  of seconds their lips met fiercely, hungrily, the flavour of salt in their
  madness, and the roar and blinding fury of the breaking waves stupefying
  them...Once again the yacht, which had been sucked backwards, crashed into
  the stone wall. This time she fell apart like a cardboard box. Fawley saw, as
  though in a dream, Elida hauled into the dinghy. She was surrounded by ugly
  pieces of wreckage, threatening them every second with death. He drew a long
  breath and dived down to the calmer waters.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley, after several weeks of devious and strenuous
  wanderings, crossed the very fine hall of Berlin's most famous hotel, well
  aware that he was now approaching the crucial point of his enterprise.
  Frankfurt, thanks to his English and French connections, had been easy. At
  Cologne and some of the smaller towns around, even if he had aroused a little
  suspicion, he had learnt all that he needed to know. But in Berlin, for the
  first time, outside aid was denied to him and he became conscious that he was
  up against a powerful and well-conducted system of espionage. The very
  politeness of the hotel officials, their casual glance at his credentials,
  their meticulous care as to his comfort&mdash;all these things had seemed to
  him to possess a sinister undernote. He chose for his headquarters a small
  suite upon the sixth floor, with the sitting room between his bedroom and
  bathroom; but his first discovery was that the one set of keys attached to
  the double doors was missing and he only obtained the keys giving access to
  the corridor after some considerable delay...</p>

  <p>Yet to all appearance he had been received as an ordinary and welcome
  visitor. According to his custom, he was travelling under his own passport
  and without any sort of compromising papers, yet all the time he fancied that
  these polite officials, some of whom seemed to be always in the background,
  were looking at him from behind that masked expression of courtesy and
  affability with definite suspicion.</p>

  <p>For two days he lounged about the city as an ordinary tourist, without any
  particular attempt at secrecy, asking no questions, seeking no new
  acquaintances, and visiting only the largest and best-known restaurants. On
  the third morning after his arrival there was a thunderous knocking at the
  door, and in reply to his invitation to enter there rolled in, with his fat
  creaseless face, and pudgy hand already extended, Adolf Krust. Fawley laid
  down his pipe and suffered his fingers to be gripped.</p>

  <p>"So you gave us all the slip, you crafty fellow," the visitor exclaimed.
  "And you left my little friend in such distress with a copy of an A.B.C. in
  her hand and tears in her eyes; and all that we know, or rather that we do
  not know, is that the <i>Daily Mail</i> tells us that Major Fawley, late of
  the American Army, has left the H&ocirc;tel de France for London. London,
  indeed! The one place in the world that for you and me and for those like us
  is dead. What should you be doing in London, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I may go there before I finish up," Fawley replied, smiling. "After all,
  I am half English, you know."</p>

  <p>"You are of no country," Adolf Krust declared, sinking into the indicated
  easy-chair and blowing out his cheeks. "You are the monarch of cosmopolitans.
  You are a person who carries with him always a cult. You have upset us all in
  Monte Carlo. Some believe that you were drowned when that clumsy fool, that
  idiot nephew of Von Salzenburg, drove you on to the sea wall of the harbour
  in that fearful mistral."</p>

  <p>"It was an excellent stage disappearance for me," Fawley observed. "I was
  just a shade too much in the limelight for my safety or my comfort."</p>

  <p>"You speak the truth," his visitor agreed. "Only two days after you left,
  the French military police were swarming in the hotel. Every one was talking
  about you. There were some who insisted upon it that you were a dangerous
  fellow. They are right, too, every time; but all the same, you breathe life.
  Yes," Krust concluded, with a little sigh of satisfaction, "it is well put,
  that&mdash;you breathe life."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is because I have so often loitered in the shadow of death,"
  Fawley remarked.</p>

  <p>Krust shrugged his tightly encased shoulders. In the city he had abandoned
  the informal costume of the Riviera and was attired with the grave precision
  of a senator.</p>

  <p>"In the walk of life we traverse," he said, "that is a matter of
  course...<i>Ach</i>, but this is strange!"</p>

  <p>"What is strange?"</p>

  <p>"To find you, after all my persuadings, in my beloved Berlin."</p>

  <p>"I have also visited your beloved Frankfurt and Cologne," Fawley confided
  drily, perfectly certain that his visitor was well acquainted with the
  fact.</p>

  <p>The blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.</p>

  <p>"You take away the breath," Krust declared. "As the great young man used
  to say&mdash;you sap the understanding. You have seen Von Salzenburg?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not I!" he answered. "Some day, if there is anything that might come of
  it, we will see him together."</p>

  <p>Krust's eyes became more protuberant than ever. This was a strange one,
  this man! He wondered whether, after all, Greta had told the truth, whether
  she had not all the time kept back something from him. Fawley pushed a box of
  cigarettes across the table. His caller waved them away and produced a
  leather receptacle the size of a traveller's sample case.</p>

  <p>"You are not one of those who object to the odour of any good tobacco,
  even if it be strong?" he asked. "You have seen my cigars. You will not smoke
  them, but they are good. They are made in Cologne and they cost two
  <i>pfennig</i> each, which in these days helps the pocketbook."</p>

  <p>"Smoke one, by all means," Fawley invited. "Thank goodness, it is warm
  weather and the windows are open!"</p>

  <p>"You joke at my taste in tobacco," Krust grumbled, "but you do not joke at
  my taste in nieces, <i>nicht</i>? What about the little Greta?"</p>

  <p>"Charming," Fawley admitted with a smile. "Every one in Monte Carlo
  wondered at your luck."</p>

  <p>"It is all done by kindness and a little generosity," the other remarked,
  with an air of self-satisfaction. "I have not the looks. I certainly have not
  the figure; but there are other gifts! One has to study the sex to know how
  to please."</p>

  <p>"How did you find me out here?" Fawley asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I have intelligent friends in Berlin who watch," was the cautious reply.
  "You were seen down south at the march of the Iron Army. You were seen at the
  new Russian Night Club in D&uuml;sseldorf the other night, where there are
  not many Russians but a good deal of conversation. People are curious just
  now about travellers. I have been asked what you do here."</p>

  <p>Fawley yawned.</p>

  <p>"Bore myself chiefly," he admitted. "I find Germany a far better governed
  country than I had anticipated. I have few criticisms. A great brain must be
  at work somewhere."</p>

  <p>Krust rolled a cigar between his fingers. It was a light-coloured
  production, long, with faint yellow spots. Every few seconds he knocked away
  the ash.</p>

  <p>"A great brain," he repeated, as if following out a train of thought of
  his own. "I will tell you something, friend Fawley. What you think is
  produced by a great brain is nothing but the God-given sense of discipline
  which every true German possesses. There is no one to thank for the
  smoothness with which the great wheel revolves. It is the German people
  themselves who are responsible."</p>

  <p>"Prosperity seems to be returning to the country," Fawley reflected. "I
  find it hard to believe that these people will suffer themselves to be led
  into such an adventure as a new war."</p>

  <p>Krust pinched his cigar thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The German has pride," he said. "He would wish to re&euml;stablish
  himself. In the meantime, he does not hang about at street corners. He works.
  You want to see underneath the crust. Why not accept my help? Unless some
  doors are unlocked, even you, the most brilliant Secret Service agent of
  these days, will fail. You will make a false report. You will leave this
  country and you will not understand."</p>

  <p>"Berati has his methods and I have mine," Fawley observed. "I admit that I
  am puzzled but I do not believe that either you or Von Salzenburg could
  enlighten me...Still, there would be no harm in our dining and spending the
  evening together. My ears are always open, even if I do not promise to be
  convinced."</p>

  <p>Krust sighed.</p>

  <p>"To go about openly with you," he regretted, "would do neither of us any
  good. It would give me all the joy in the world to offer you the hospitality
  of the city. I dare not."</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled as he pressed the bell for the waiter.</p>

  <p>"Then I must show you some."</p>

  <p>Adolf Krust chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I am a man," he confessed, "who, when he talks, likes to drink. Most good
  Germans are like that."</p>

  <p>"Cocktails?"</p>

  <p>Krust waved aside the idea.</p>

  <p>"I drink cocktails only at the bar. Wine or beer here. It is equal to
  me."</p>

  <p>Fawley gave the waiter an order. The finest Rhine wine was served to them
  in deliciously frosted glasses. They drank solemnly an unspoken toast. Fawley
  refilled the glasses. Again they were raised.</p>

  <p>"To our better understanding," the German said.</p>

  <p>He muttered a few words in his own language. The toast, however, whatever
  it may have been, was never drunk. There was a loud knocking at the outside
  door. What followed on Fawley's invitation to enter seemed to his astonished
  eyes more like the advance guard of a circus than anything. The door was
  thrown open with a flourish. The manager of the hotel, in a tightly fitting
  frock coat and grey trousers of formal design, entered hurriedly. He took not
  the slightest notice of Fawley but swung around and ranged himself by the
  side of the threshold. He was joined a few seconds later by the assistant
  manager, dressed in precisely the same fashion, who also made precipitate
  entrance and stood on the other side, facing his chief. There followed an
  officer dressed in some sort of uniform and after him a younger man, who
  appeared to hold the post of aide-de-camp, in more sombre but still
  semi-military accoutrements. Last of all came a man in civilian
  clothes&mdash;stern, with a shock of brown hair streaked with grey, hard
  features, granite-like mouth, keen steely eyes. He held up his hand as he
  entered in a gesture which might have been intended for the Fascist salute or
  might have been an invocation to silence. He spoke German correctly, but with
  a strong Prussian accent.</p>

  <p>"My name is Behrling&mdash;Heinrich Behrling," he announced. "It is my
  wish to speak a few words with the agent of my friend, General Berati of
  Rome. I have the pleasure&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>Fawley bowed but shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot claim the distinction of being the recognised agent of that
  great man," he declared. "I am an American visiting Germany as a
  tourist."</p>

  <p>The newcomer advanced farther into the room and shook hands with some
  solemnity. Fawley turned towards where his previous visitor had been seated,
  then gave a little start. The hideous and unsavoury cigar propped up against
  an ash-tray was still alight. The armchair, however, had been pushed back and
  the black Homburg hat which had rested upon the floor had gone. There was in
  the place where Adolf Krust had sat the most atrocious odour of foul tobacco,
  but nowhere in the room was there any sign of him or any indication of his
  sudden departure, except the wide-open door leading into the bathroom!</p>

  <p>"You search for something?" the visitor asked.</p>

  <p>"Before you came, sir," Fawley confided, "I had a caller. He must have
  taken his leave in a hurry."</p>

  <p>Heinrich Behrling laughed.</p>

  <p>"There are many," he declared, "who leave in a hurry when I arrive!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Heinrich Behrling, the man whom the most widely read paper
  in Berlin had called only that morning "the underground ruler of Germany,"
  showed no hesitation in taking the vacated easy-chair and he watched the
  disappearance of the still burning cigar out of the window with an air of
  satisfaction. In response to a wave of the hand, his escort retired. He
  breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"It gives me no pleasure to be so attended," he declared, "but what would
  you have? The communists have sworn that before the end of the week I shall
  be a dead man. I prefer to live."</p>

  <p>"It is the natural choice," Fawley murmured with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You are Major Fawley, the American who has entered the service of Italy?"
  Behrling demanded. "You speak German&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes to both questions," was the prompt reply. "My name is Fawley, I have
  accepted a temporary post under the Italian Government and I speak
  German."</p>

  <p>"What brought you to Berlin?"</p>

  <p>"Every one comes to Berlin nowadays."</p>

  <p>"You came on Berati's orders, of course."</p>

  <p>Fawley's fingers tapped lightly upon his desk and he remained for a moment
  silent.</p>

  <p>"I look upon your visit as a great honour, sir," he said. "I only regret
  that when I became a servant I became dumb."</p>

  <p>"I wish there were more like you on my staff," Behrling muttered, with a
  throaty exclamation. "Can I deal with you? That is the question."</p>

  <p>"On behalf of whom?"</p>

  <p>"On behalf of my country. You have seen my army in the making. You have
  visited Cologne and Frankfurt, amongst other towns. You know what is coming
  to Germany as well as I can tell you. I ask whether I can deal with you on
  behalf of my country."</p>

  <p>"Is this not a little premature, Herr Behrling?" Fawley asked quietly.
  "The elections are yet to come."</p>

  <p>"So you have been listening to the fat man," was the scornful reply. "The
  man who smokes that filthy stuff and left the room like a streak of lightning
  at my coming! He would have you think that the dummy who has taken my place
  in the Reichstag is to be dealt with. He is a fool. If I raised my hand in
  opposition&mdash;crash to-morrow would come the whole of your brilliant
  scheme, and where would you be then? Where would Italy be? I ask you
  that."</p>

  <p>Fawley was silent. This man was not as he had expected. He was at the same
  time more verbose yet more impressive.</p>

  <p>"If I chose to listen to my councillors," Behrling went on, "I will tell
  you what would happen. Italy would be stripped, disgraced, convicted of a
  great crime and&mdash;worse still&mdash;guilty of being found out. That is
  what will happen to any nation who dares to ignore the only party which is
  strong enough to rule Germany, the only party which can put into the field an
  army of patriots."</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Alas," he explained, "I am only a messenger. I have no weight in the
  councils of Italy."</p>

  <p>"You can repeat my words."</p>

  <p>"I will do so."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"When I return to Italy."</p>

  <p>Behrling's expression was fervent and blasphemous.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wait till then?" he demanded. "You are here to see how the
  land lies. You have to make your report. Von Salzenburg's men are veterans of
  the war. They would carry arms in no man's cause. Soon they will be carrying
  them to the grave. The spirit of young Germany is with me. Italy will miss
  her great chance. She will pass down into the rank of second-class nations if
  she does not recognise this."</p>

  <p>"Every word of what you have said I promise shall be repeated."</p>

  <p>"But why not in your despatches?" Behrling argued, striking the table with
  his fist. "Why not to-night? Why not let a special messenger fly to Rome? An
  aeroplane is at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"I never send despatches," Fawley confided, tapping a cigarette upon the
  table and lighting it.</p>

  <p>His visitor stared at him in blank surprise.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Of course you must send despatches."</p>

  <p>"I have never sent one in my life," Fawley assured him. "I have very
  seldom committed a line of anything relating to my profession to paper. When
  a thing is important enough for me to pass it on to my chiefs, I take the
  knowledge of it in my brain and I go to them. Otherwise a message in Berati's
  private code on his private telephone is always possible."</p>

  <p>Behrling rose to his feet and walked restlessly up and down the room. His
  strong features were working nervously. He threw away his cigarette. It was
  obvious that he had been living for months under a great strain. He beat the
  air with his fists&mdash;a gesture which seemed to Fawley curiously familiar.
  Suddenly he swung around.</p>

  <p>"The fat man&mdash;Adolf Krust&mdash;he has been here this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Fawley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has been here. He was in Monte Carlo when I was there. He went on
  to see Berati. It is scarcely my business to tell you so," Fawley observed,
  "still I see no reason why I should keep another man's secret. He only got as
  far as San Remo. Berati refused to see him."</p>

  <p>"When do you return to Rome?"</p>

  <p>"In ten days."</p>

  <p>"The world itself may be changed in that time," Behrling declared
  impatiently. "If you were to study the welfare of your adopted country, I
  tell you this&mdash;you would return to Rome to-morrow. You would use every
  argument to convince Berati that Italy stands upon the threshold of a
  colossal mistake."</p>

  <p>"Mistake?" Fawley repeated.</p>

  <p>"Give me a few hours of your time," Behrling demanded, with flashing eyes,
  "and I will show you how great a mistake. If ever a thing was dead at heart,
  snapped at the roots, it is the monarchical spirit of Germany. Youth alone
  can rebuild and inspire Germany. These men who do the goose step through the
  streets of Berlin, who have adopted the mouldy, ignoble relic of the most
  self-intoxicated monarchical r&eacute;gime which ever plunged its country
  into ruin, they lack everything. They lack inspiration, they lack courage;
  more than anything they lack youth. You have seen my men march, Major Fawley.
  You know that their average age is under twenty-four. There is the youth and
  fire of the country. There is the living force. They have no soul
  fatigue."</p>

  <p>"There are rumours," Fawley ventured to remind him, "of negotiations
  between the monarchists and your young men. I have heard it said that if this
  great cataclysm should take place, there would be a coming together of every
  military party in Germany."</p>

  <p>"You may have heard this," Behrling admitted, with a queer smile, "but you
  would not be sitting where you are now if you had not the wit to know that it
  is a falsehood. My men will fight for their country and their principals and
  me, but not a shot would they fire to drag back from happy obscurity one half
  an hour of the accursed Hohenzollern rule."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you predict will be the government in this country?" Fawley
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No sane man doubts that," Behrling answered. "The people have spoken. I
  am on my way there already. I shall be dictator within two months. In twelve
  months, Germany will be once more a great power, the greatest power amongst
  the European nations."</p>

  <p>Fawley lit another cigarette and pushed the box towards his visitor who,
  however, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In these days," the latter confided, "I may not smoke and I may not
  drink. It is the Lenten fast of my life. Every nerve of my body is strained.
  The time for relaxation will come afterwards. Major Fawley, I invite you to
  attend a meeting of my council to-night."</p>

  <p>Fawley declined respectfully.</p>

  <p>"If I accepted your offer," he acknowledged, "I should be doing so under
  false pretences. I was fortunate enough to intercept a private despatch
  addressed to Berati's chief, the last time I was in Rome. From it I am
  convinced that however long she may hesitate, Italy has made up her mind to
  support the Monarchist Party. The treaty is already drawn up."</p>

  <p>Behrling's arms went out with a gesture towards the sky. One forgot the
  banality of the gilt-and-white ceiling above his head.</p>

  <p>"What are treaties," he cried, "when the stars are falling and new worlds
  are being born? I take my risk of all. You and I both know why Berati's
  master leans towards the monarchical party. It is because he has sworn that
  there shall be only one dictator in Europe. That is sheer vanity. In time,
  his patriotism will conquer and he will see the truth...I meet you at
  midnight at an address which will be given you this afternoon with no
  explanation. You will be there?"</p>

  <p>"If you invite me with the full knowledge of the situation," Fawley
  replied.</p>

  <p>"That is understood."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> at the newest Berlin
  restaurant, which had the reputation of almost fantastic exclusiveness, was
  typically Teutonic. His fair hair had been shaved close to his skull, his
  fierce little yellow moustache was upturned in military fashion, his
  protuberant stomach interfered in no manner with his consequential, almost
  dignified, bearing. He scarcely troubled to reply to Fawley's enquiry for a
  table.</p>

  <p>"Every table is taken," he announced, "for to-night and every night this
  week."</p>

  <p>"For the other evenings during the week," Fawley replied, "I have no
  interest. Please to give the matter your attention. You had better glance at
  this card."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> turned ponderously around. Fawley's
  rather lazy voice, easily recognisable as American, notwithstanding his
  excellent accent, was in a way impressive. A great deal more so, however, was
  the card which he had presented. The man's manner underwent a complete
  change. He indulged in a swift ceremonious bow.</p>

  <p>"Your table is reserved, <i>Herr Oberst</i>," he said. "Please to follow
  me."</p>

  <p>He led the way into a small but evidently very high-class restaurant. The
  walls were panelled in black oak which, so far from giving the place a sombre
  appearance, increased the brilliancy of the effect produced by the masses of
  scarlet flowers with which every table was decorated, the spotless linen, the
  profusion of gleaming glass and silver. He led the way to a small table in a
  recess&mdash;a table laid for three, one place of which was already occupied.
  Fawley stopped short. Elida was seated there&mdash;looking like a Greuze
  picture in her filmy veil and white satin gown, with her chestnut-brown hair
  and soft hazel eyes. She was obviously very nervous.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that there must be some mistake," Fawley said to the
  <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. "It is a man whom I am expecting to
  meet."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> had resumed his consequential
  air.</p>

  <p>"I do not make mistakes, <i>Herr Oberst</i>," he declared. "This is the
  table commanded by my most honoured patron to be reserved for Herr Oberst
  Fawley and the Prinzessin Elida di Rezco di Vasena. His Excellency will join
  you later."</p>

  <p>Elida smiled appealingly up at Fawley.</p>

  <p>"You will support my presence for a short time until your host arrives?"
  she begged. "He is, as you know, a very busy man. He thought that we might
  converse for a while until he comes."</p>

  <p>"But what do you know about him?" Fawley asked wonderingly. "Surely this
  is not your <i>gal&egrave;re</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I will explain," she promised. "You are angry with me but indeed nothing
  that happened was my fault. Please sit down."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his wrist and drew him gently towards the table.
  Fawley steeled himself, as well as he might, against the lure of her
  beseeching eyes, but took the place by her side.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if I seemed ungracious," he murmured. "I never dreamed of
  seeing you here."</p>

  <p>She drew a sigh of relief and approved his idea of a cocktail. The
  pedagogue of the place strutted away. They were alone.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," she said, and for a person who had seemed to him, at most
  times, so indifferent, her voice trembled with emotion. "Indeed I was not to
  blame. No idea of my mad cousin's scheme had ever entered my head. One result
  of it you see in my presence here."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to believe it," he answered. "Do you mean then that your
  sympathies are changed?"</p>

  <p>"It would seem so, would it not?" she answered, with a sigh of relief. "It
  has been a great upheaval but I believe that they are. My cousin assured me
  that Von Salzenburg himself said that you were to be got rid of. The idea
  sickened me. I no longer wish to serve a company of assassins."</p>

  <p>The cocktails were served. Elida ordered supper and wine.</p>

  <p>"You see," she explained, "our host eats or drinks practically nothing. I
  am to entertain you till he comes. You are to be impressed. How shall I
  begin, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Princess&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You may call me Elida," she interrupted. "From you I prefer it. I shall
  call you Martin. In a place like this, we do not wish to advertise
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"I am very happy to find you so gracious," he assured her. "I am happy too
  to know that you did not share your cousin's desire to send me to
  destruction."</p>

  <p>"No one in the world," she said quietly, "has a stronger wish than I have,
  Martin, to keep you alive, to keep you well, to keep you near me if I
  can."</p>

  <p>"Do you speak for your new chief?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"You must please not be bitter," she pleaded. "I speak for myself. That, I
  assure you, you should believe. If you wish to be serious, I will now speak
  to you for Heinrich Behrling. It was his wish that I should do so."</p>

  <p>"Why should he trouble about me?" Fawley asked, toying with the stem of
  his wineglass. "I am only an agent and a mercenary at that."</p>

  <p>"Do not fence," she begged. "Remember that I know all about you. We can
  both guess why you are here. Berati is at last not absolutely certain that he
  is dealing with the right party. Very late in the day and against his will,
  he is finding wisdom&mdash;as I have. Our tinsel prince and his
  goose-stepping soldiers will never help Germany towards freedom. It is the
  passionate youth of Germany, the liberty-loving and country-loving youth in
  whose keeping the future rests."</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting," Fawley remarked, with a faint smile.
  "Considering your antecedents, I find it almost incredible."</p>

  <p>"Must one ignore the welfare of one's country because one happens to be
  born an aristocrat?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not if a Rienzi presents himself," he retorted. "Are you sure, however,
  that Behrling really is your Rienzi?"</p>

  <p>"If I were not," she insisted, with a note of passion in her tone, "I
  should never have given my life and reputation and everything worth having to
  his cause, as I have done since the day of that catastrophe upon the yacht.
  Do you know, Martin, that I am one of a band&mdash;the latest recruit perhaps
  but one of the most earnest&mdash;a band of six thousand young women, all
  born in different walks of life. We have all the same idea. We work to make
  Heinrich Behrling the ruler of Germany. We are not all Germans. We do not
  wear uniform, we do not look for any reward. Our idea is to give everything
  we possess, whatever it may be&mdash;money, our gifts of persuasion, our
  lives if necessary, to win adherents to Behrling's cause, to stop and rout
  the communists and the Monarchist Party. Another Hohenzollern mixed up with
  politics and the whole world would lose faith in Germany. The only way that
  she can escape from the yoke of France is by showing the world that she has
  espoused the broader and greater principles of life and government."</p>

  <p>Fawley accepted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You are very interesting, Elida," he said. "I wish that I knew more of
  this matter. I am afraid that I am a very dumb and ignorant person."</p>

  <p>"It has occurred to me once or twice this evening," she rejoined drily,
  "that you wish to appear so."</p>

  <p>"Alas," he sighed, "I can assure you that I am no actor."</p>

  <p>"Nor are you, I am afraid," she whispered, leaning across the table,
  "quite so impressionable as I fancied you were that afternoon in the corridor
  of Berati's <i>palazzo</i>."</p>

  <p>The grim lines at the corners of his mouth relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Elida," he replied, as he looked into her eyes, "all I can say
  is&mdash;give me the opportunity to prove myself."</p>

  <p>She was puzzled for a moment. Then she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of Krust and his little crowd of fairies," she laughed.
  "Yet I am told that he finds them very useful. One of them you seemed to
  find&mdash;rather attractive&mdash;at Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps she realised that her mention of the
  place was not altogether tactful. She changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Why are you not working for your own country?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because my own country has a passion for imagining that even in these
  days of fast steamships and seaplanes, she can remain apart from Europe and
  European influence," he answered, with a faintly regretful tremor in his
  tone. "We have abandoned all Secret Service methods. We have no Secret
  Service. I can tell you of six departments in which one might have served
  before the war. Not one of these exists to-day. In their place we have but
  one department and to belong to this it is only necessary that a man has
  never been out of his own country, can speak no language but his own and is
  devoid of any pretensions to intelligence! The work for its own sake is so
  fascinating that one finds it hard to abandon it altogether. That is why I
  offered my services to Italy."</p>

  <p>"And are you satisfied? The work interests you?"</p>

  <p>He seemed a little doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Lately," he admitted, "there is too much talk and too little action. I
  cannot see that I make any definite progress."</p>

  <p>"That means that you weary yourself talking to me?" she asked, her hand
  resting for a moment on his and her soft eyes pleading with him.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he assured her. "In a few minutes, though, we shall
  have our friend Behrling here, and it will all begin again. I would so much
  sooner take you somewhere else, where Behrling is not likely to appear, and
  ask you a few questions which you would find quite easy to answer."</p>

  <p>A brilliant smile parted her lips.</p>

  <p>"Now you talk more as I had hoped," she confided. "Indeed, if you would
  let me, I would wish to be your companion all the time that you are here. All
  the devotion I can offer is at your command but I will be honest with
  you&mdash;there are still a few things I want to know."</p>

  <p>"Elida," he said, "I do not believe that there is a single thing in the
  world I could tell you that you do not know already. For instance, heaps of
  people must have told you that you have the most beautiful hazel-brown eyes
  in the world."</p>

  <p>She patted his hand.</p>

  <p>"If I were Nina or Greta," she observed, "I should throw my arms around
  your neck. You would wish it&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>They were very beautiful arms but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is absurd of me," he confessed, "but I should be afraid that you were
  not sincere."</p>

  <p>"How very Anglo-Saxon," she meditated. "What on earth has sincerity to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"To the sentimentalist&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"My dear new friend Martin," she interrupted, "do not let us spoil
  everything before we begin. We are neither of us sentimentalists. We are both
  just playing a game: fortunately it is a pleasant game. I am afraid that you
  mean to win. Never mind, there are pleasures&mdash;But do not speak about
  sentiment. That belongs to the world we leave behind us when we take our
  country into our hearts."</p>

  <p>"The wrong word, I suppose," he admitted. "On the other hand, I do confess
  to being a trifle maudlin. If I had any secrets to give away, you would
  succeed where Behrling would fail."</p>

  <p>"But you have none?"</p>

  <p>"Not a ghost of one," he assured her.</p>

  <p>Her face suddenly lost its softened charm. She was looking past him
  towards the door. He leaned forward and followed her gaze, then, though
  nothing audible escaped his lips, he whistled softly to himself. It was Krust
  who had entered with Fr&auml;ulein Nina, Krust in bulging white shirt front
  and waistcoat, his dinner coat tightly stretched across the shoulders, his
  beautifully shaven face pink and white, his hair brushed smoothly back. He
  recognised Fawley instantly. He deposited his companion at their table and
  made his way up the room. For the first part of his progress the most
  beatifically welcoming smile parted his lips. Then he saw Elida and the good
  humour faded from his face. His lips took an unpleasant curve, his eyes
  seemed to recede into his head. Again the mask fell. He came towards them
  with outstretched hands. The smile re&euml;stablished itself.</p>

  <p>"My friend Fawley," he exclaimed. "I have an opportunity, then, of making
  my apologies for leaving your salon so abruptly. An engagement of the utmost
  importance came into my mind as I heard your friends at the door."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Fawley and looked questioningly at Elida.</p>

  <p>"I believe, Princess," he ventured, with a stiff bow, "that I have had the
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that you are mistaken," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>Krust was not in the least discomposed. He pointed down the room to where
  Nina waved her hand gaily at Fawley.</p>

  <p>"My work here is finished," he confided. "Others more capable are taking
  it over. I return to-morrow to Monte Carlo. The thought of it has made the
  little one very happy. And you, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"I am never sure of my movements," was the vague reply.</p>

  <p>"If I had not found you so charmingly occupied," Krust continued, "I would
  ask you to join us."</p>

  <p>"As you see, it is impossible," Fawley pointed out, a trifle curtly.</p>

  <p>Krust, his good humour apparently completely restored, took his leave. He
  had only proceeded a few steps, however, when he came to a pause on the edge
  of the dancing floor. There was the sound of commotion from the entrance hall
  of the place, a tangle of angry voices, a peremptory command given in an
  official tone, a glimpse of grey uniforms and the flash of arms. The music
  stopped, the dancers at that end of the room hurried towards the doorway.
  Krust followed their example, but he was too late. A heavy black curtain
  which hung over the entrance was drawn by some unseen hand, the sound behind
  was partially deadened. Suddenly the manager pushed the curtains back and
  appeared upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;honourable clients of mine," he announced,
  "the slight disturbance outside is over. Kindly resume your seats. Some young
  men, members of a recently inaugurated society, endeavoured to enter in
  uniform&mdash;which is strictly against the rules. The police interfered and
  they have been sent to their homes."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Few people understood the exact nature of the
  disturbance. Here and there, however, was an angry snarl of voices. The veins
  were standing out on Krust's forehead. He strode up to the manager in a
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Who sent for the police?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"There was no need to send for them," was the prompt reply. "The young
  gentlemen were followed here from the Garden."</p>

  <p>"Did you refuse them entrance to your restaurant?" Krust persisted.</p>

  <p>Every one seemed to be holding their breaths. There was a queer strained
  silence in the luxurious little place.</p>

  <p>"It is against the law for any one to enter, wearing an unrecognised
  uniform," the manager declared. "I told them so. Whilst we were discussing
  the matter, the police appeared."</p>

  <p>"You will bow down to that uniform before many days have passed," Krust
  prophesied furiously.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ach</i>, that or another!" was the equally angry reply.</p>

  <p>Krust stepped forward as though to deal a blow. Nina, who had left her
  place, silently threw her arms around his neck. She whispered something in
  his ear. He suffered himself to be led away. The orchestra struck up again.
  The dancing recommenced...</p>

  <p>"Behold," Elida exclaimed, as she watched the waiter filling her glass
  with champagne, "a tableau! A situation which might have become more than
  dramatic. Krust&mdash;the monarchist spy&mdash;with one of his little
  butterflies. Major Fawley, the Italian mercenary, the trusted agent of
  Berati. I, Elida di Rezco di Vasena, who have gone over at the peril of my
  life to the new order. We line the walls of this restaurant. What are we
  playing at? I scarcely know. We are all just a little hysterical these days.
  The restaurant is likely to be raided by the communists if Behrling comes, by
  the monarchists if the refusal to admit those officers is reported at their
  headquarters, or by Behrling's own men. What will our friend Berati say when
  he hears that you have been seen in such an environment?"</p>

  <p>"He will probably realise," Fawley replied, "that I am going about my
  business and his in my own way. Mercenaries, as I dare say you know, are
  never over-officered. They are left with a certain measure of initiative. If
  one were to indulge in speculations," he went on, after a momentary pause,
  "one might wonder what Krust does here. From the fact that Behrling suggested
  it as a rendezvous, one might gather that this place is frequented by his
  followers. Is it not a little dangerous in these days, when party spirit is
  running high, to risk an encounter?"</p>

  <p>Elida shrugged her pearly white shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Krust can take care of himself," she said. "He is, as I dare say you have
  heard, the richest man in Germany, and he is reputed to have a secret body of
  armed guards, some of whom are never far distant. In any case, the present
  situation has all developed in a week. This was Von Salzenburg's headquarters
  before Behrling decided to establish himself here. A month ago Gustaf there
  was bowing to other lords."</p>

  <p>For the second time that evening some measure of commotion was manifest at
  the entrance. This time, however, there was no intimation of any dispute. A
  great man was being welcomed. Heinrich Behrling, in plain evening clothes,
  handed his overcoat and soft black hat to an attendant and followed Gustaf's
  outstretched hand towards the table where Fawley and his companion were
  seated.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley watched his approaching host with calm and critical
  interest. His travels in the country during the last few days had already
  convinced him that great events were looming. A tortured nation was on the
  point of breaking its bonds. An atmosphere of impending cataclysm was
  brooding over the place. The worn faces of the people, the continuous stream
  of processions, the crowded caf&eacute;s all gave evidence of it. It was as
  though there were dynamite upon the pavements and liquid dynamite in the air,
  dynamite which needed only a spark to light the storm. Even in this luxurious
  and secluded restaurant, Fawley thought that the first mutterings of the
  thunder might begin...Looking across the room, he saw the good-natured
  expression fade from the face of Adolf Krust, the great industrialist, saw
  his eyes receding into his head, alight as they were with hatred, saw the
  menacing curve of his lips as he stared at the approaching figure. Elida
  touched her companion on the arm.</p>

  <p>"You see what is happening," she whispered. "Every other table in the
  restaurant has an engaged card upon it. Now watch."</p>

  <p>Without any confusion or haste, a well-behaved, good-looking crowd of
  young men, with here and there a woman companion, had followed Behrling into
  the place. Every one knew his table and occupied it swiftly. They wore no
  sort of uniform, these newcomers. They were dressed with singular precision
  in the fashion of the day, but there was a small brown ribbon upon the lapel
  of their dinner coats. Furthermore, although they were of varying types,
  there was a curious similitude in their bearing and expression.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," Fawley murmured. "I gather that these young men have all
  been subjected to some sort of military training?"</p>

  <p>"They are Behrling's bodyguard," she confided. "It is not his own idea; it
  is the idea of those who would protect him. Krust to-night, for instance,
  might easily have made mischief. What chance has he now? He has not been
  allowed a table within fifty feet of us and his slightest movement will be
  watched."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet to welcome the newcomer. Fawley followed her example.
  Behrling, still without a smile upon his strong colourless face, bowed
  formally to them both and sank into the vacant chair.</p>

  <p>"You have been entertained, I hope, Major Fawley?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Admirably," the other assured him.</p>

  <p>"You will remember that you are my guests," he went on. "Supper, I think,
  has already been ordered. You will forgive me if I drink nothing but coffee
  and eat some plain food. I see," he added, glancing across the room, "that
  our friends the enemy are represented here to-night."</p>

  <p>Elida nodded.</p>

  <p>"Adolf Krust has been over to speak to us," she remarked. "He looks upon
  Major Fawley as a lamb in danger of straying from the fold."</p>

  <p>"I hear that he was at the Italian Embassy this evening," Behrling
  confided. "Does that disconcert you, Major Fawley?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," was the composed reply. "The work of investigation
  which I have to do I shall do in my own way and in my own fashion. Krust will
  not interfere with or influence me."</p>

  <p>"You are in a difficult position," Behrling continued, as he watched the
  glasses being refilled with champagne and sipped his own coffee. "Italy is
  employing you upon a very delicate mission, because a great scheme has been
  thought out to the last details and an unexpected crisis has imperilled its
  fruition. There have arisen the questions&mdash;Who is Germany? What is
  Germany? Who shall speak for her? Who is there alive to-day who can sign a
  treaty in her name?"</p>

  <p>"These are all matters for statesmen," Fawley observed. "Very difficult
  matters for an outsider to deal with."</p>

  <p>Behrling's tightened lips concealed his irritation. This impenetrable
  American was getting upon his nerves.</p>

  <p>"You are here, I presume, to report upon the situation," he said. "All
  that I desire is that you will report upon it fairly. You saw, perhaps, the
  goose-step march of the weary veterans on their celebration day. What you saw
  was a true and just allegory. The weariness of those who fainted by the
  wayside&mdash;and there were many&mdash;is typical of the weariness of all
  the things they represent. How much you have seen of my people I do not know,
  but I make you this offer. I will make over to you one of my most trusted
  lieutenants and, with the Princess here as your guide, you shall visit the
  chosen spots of my country. You shall judge for yourself of the new spirit.
  You will be in a position then to tell those who employ you with whom it
  would be politic to deal."</p>

  <p>"If you only see half as much as I have seen within the last few weeks,"
  Elida intervened, "it will be enough."</p>

  <p>"You must please understand this," Fawley said firmly. "I honestly do not
  believe that any word I could say would influence Berati or those who stand
  behind him in the least. He trusts none of his army of spies. He listens to
  every scrap of information we bring him and he decides for himself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the great thing is to see that the spirit of the country is
  represented to him fairly," Behrling declared passionately. "Can you not see
  that? Krust, they tell me, although he is not in favour just now, has been
  twice received in Rome&mdash;once at the Vatican. I know that for a
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Krust must be received wherever he claims the entr&eacute;e," Fawley
  pointed out. "I suppose he still remains the greatest industrialist in
  Central Europe."</p>

  <p>"He is also unfortunately the intimate friend of Von Salzenburg and the
  Crown Prince," was Behrling's grim comment. "I am not pleading for myself. I
  am pleading only for the thousands of Germans who must go once more to their
  doom if a false note is struck now. They think in Rome that Germany is
  leaning towards the idea of a monarchy. She is doing nothing of the sort.
  When these clouds are cleared away, and believe me it will not be long, her
  programme will be before the world for every one to see. Heart and soul she
  is nationalist. She is for a re&euml;stablished and almighty Germany. She is
  for the peace that brains and industry can ensure."</p>

  <p>A note was handed to Behrling. He read it and glanced meaningly at
  Elida.</p>

  <p>"I think that our host would like to speak with some of his friends," she
  said. "Will you dance for a few minutes, Major Fawley?"</p>

  <p>Fawley looked enquiringly at his host. The latter's acquiescence was
  swift.</p>

  <p>"I see there two of my party with whom I have affairs," he said. "Do not
  leave me without a farewell, Major, or without giving me your decision.
  Remember, I shall expect nothing but a favourable one."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Fawley felt his feet upon the earth again. Elida, notwithstanding the
  smooth grace of her movements, clung to him every now and then as though he
  represented destiny, as though he were the only pillar of security remaining
  in a world-threatening flood. Fawley, whose complete humanity was one of the
  possible elements of his success in his profession, felt her allure without
  the slightest idea of yielding to it.</p>

  <p>"You must accept Heinrich Behrling's offer," she whispered eagerly. "You
  would not be doing your duty to the country which employs you if you did not.
  We can go to all the important places, the very names of which are seldom
  mentioned in the papers nowadays. We can go by aeroplane. One of Behrling's
  warmest supporters is the largest maker of aeroplanes in Europe."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to gain from me at the end of it?" he asked, genuinely
  a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Cannot you see," she murmured passionately, "that this German-Italian
  scheme would mean the reconstruction of Europe? It would bring power and
  supremacy to both nations and would place them where they have a right to
  belong. Behrling is terribly afraid that Berati's leanings are towards the
  other party and that he will not conclude a treaty with any one else."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that part of it," Fawley assented, "but I am certain
  that my own importance in the matter is overrated. I am here on a special
  errand, concerning which I have to make a detailed report. Berati does not
  ask me for my views upon the situation. The Italian Government are satisfied
  with their own correspondents here. I should simply be butting in if I went
  home with a lot of information which they have probably already
  acquired."</p>

  <p>"But they have not," she insisted, with a fierce little clutch at his arm.
  "There was never a man in this world&mdash;a clever man, I mean&mdash;so
  befooled by another as Berati's master has been by Krust. If Berati only knew
  the truth, there would be no further hesitation. Now listen. I must tell you
  more about Heinrich Behrling. I must tell you more about the monarchists
  here. Do you suppose that I, who am connected with three of the royal
  families of Europe, who have nothing but monarchist blood in my veins, could
  turn aside if I were not utterly and completely convinced? Come this
  way."</p>

  <p>She led him into a little recess, pushed back the curtain and showed the
  way into a small but wonderfully decorated and luxurious bar. A fat and
  genial-looking dispenser of drinks stood behind the counter. Elida ordered
  champagne frapp&eacute; and drew Fawley down on to a divan. He indulged in a
  dubious grimace.</p>

  <p>"I was rather enjoying that dance with you," he complained.</p>

  <p>"Have I not offered you," she reminded him, in a voice which shook with
  earnestness, "all the dancing with me you might care for, all the days of
  your life? I am sincere too. I want many things from you, but first of all I
  want you to take that journey with me."</p>

  <p>"If I took it," he told her, "if you convinced me, as you very likely
  might, if I flew straight back to Rome and showed Berati the whole truth, I
  am not sure that it would make one particle of difference. You probably know
  the man&mdash;he takes advice from no one and he is very seldom wrong."</p>

  <p>"Take me to him, then," she begged. "I am forbidden the country but I will
  risk that. I tried to take his life but I will risk his retaliation."</p>

  <p>Fawley tried to impart a lighter note to a conversation which was becoming
  too highly charged with emotion.</p>

  <p>"I would not dream of doing such a thing," he said. "I have heard
  something of Berati's methods with Italian ladies!"</p>

  <p>She sipped her wine with a little gesture of despair. Fawley's feet beat
  time to the music. She ignored the hint. Suddenly, as though by an impatient
  hand, the curtain shielding the other entrance to the bar was drawn back. A
  tall middle-aged man of dissipated appearance, but still slim and alert in
  his manner, hastened across the room towards Elida, bowed in perfunctory
  fashion and broke into a stream of rapid German. Two or three younger men
  also pushed their way into the bar and ranged themselves by his side. Elida
  rose slowly to her feet, curtsied and resumed her place.</p>

  <p>"You are a disgrace to your name and your family," the angry newcomer
  wound up. "Of your relationship I am ashamed."</p>

  <p>"The shame is on my side," Elida answered indignantly. "I should feel it
  in the case of even an acquaintance who would attempt to brawl with a woman
  in a public place. If you have anything to say to me which you have not
  already said through Von Salzenburg and Maurice von Thal, please find another
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing with this American?" the other demanded.</p>

  <p>"That is entirely my affair."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to make it mine," was the sullen reply. "Americans are not
  welcome in Germany just now. We wish to be left alone to settle our own
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"You do not like Americans?" Fawley asked softly.</p>

  <p>"I <i>hate</i> them."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is to be understood," Fawley observed. "Unfortunately, I am
  in the same position with regard to Germans&mdash;of your type. I don't
  exactly see what we can do about it."</p>

  <p>There was a tense silence for a moment. Outside in the restaurant the
  music, too, had paused. It was as though every one had recognised the fact
  that there was trouble afoot. One of the younger men in the group stepped
  forward and tendered his card to Fawley. The latter made no movement towards
  taking it.</p>

  <p>"Sir," the intervener declared, "you have insulted one who does me the
  honour to regard me as a friend. You insult me also if you refuse my
  card."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do with your card?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"You give me yours," the other replied, with a flash in his eyes. "By
  to-morrow morning you will know."</p>

  <p>Fawley accepted the card, tore it in two and flung the pieces from
  him.</p>

  <p>"It is time the world had finished with such theatrical trash," he
  observed calmly. "I happen to have earned the right to refuse to fight with
  any one, as you can see for yourself, if you consult an American army list.
  In the meantime, I suggest that you allow me to take the Princess to her
  table and I will return to discuss the matter with you."</p>

  <p>Elida passed her hand through his arm. She knew most of these men who had
  entered and she was very determined that Fawley should leave with her.</p>

  <p>"Since you have reminded me of our relationship," she said, turning
  towards the man who had first addressed her, "let me beg you, for the sake of
  your name, to avoid anything like a brawl. Major Fawley is a distinguished
  guest and I believe a well-wisher of your country."</p>

  <p>The music outside was still silent but there was a curious shuffling of
  feet upon the dancing floor. The main curtain was abruptly thrown back, a
  party of the young men who had followed Behrling into the restaurant made
  their appearance. They entered quietly, without any sign or word of menace,
  but they were a formidable-looking body as they ranged themselves around the
  bar. By some manoeuvre, or it may have been by chance, they spread themselves
  out between Elida and her angry relative. In dead silence, although to the
  accompaniment of a cloud of evil looks, Fawley and his companion passed out
  of the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Almost before they had stepped on to the dancing floor, the
  shock came. There was the sound of a shrill, penetrating whistle from a
  distant corner, two sharp revolver shots, and within another second the whole
  room was enveloped in darkness. For a moment or two the music continued, the
  dancers swayed against one another, a moving phalanx of half-laughing,
  half-terrified humanity, groping their way through the perfumed obscurity.
  Then a woman's hysterical cry following those two reports struck a note of
  fear. Somewhere in the middle of the floor a woman fainted, calling out
  wildly as she collapsed...A powerful hand gripped Fawley's arm, a man's voice
  whispered in his ear:</p>

  <p>"I lead you. Hold my wrist and the Princess."</p>

  <p>Fawley for a moment hesitated. It was obvious that there was some sort of
  trouble on hand. Elida whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"It is Gustaf who speaks. Do anything he says."</p>

  <p>Behind them in the darkness was the sound of something which was like a
  concerted movement&mdash;the steady shuffling of purposeful feet. From the
  corner near where they had been seated and in the vicinity of which the two
  shots had been fired, they could hear the low moaning of a wounded man. Some
  one on the dancing floor lit a match and thrust the tiny flame almost into
  the faces of the man and woman by his side, only to blow it out quickly, as
  though he realised that the two were not the people whom he sought. Fawley
  hesitated no longer. With his arm still around Elida, he suffered himself to
  be led between the tables towards the side exit and down a passage leading
  into the street. Underneath the flare of an electric standard a line of cars
  was ranged along the curb. Gustaf opened the door of one and literally pushed
  them inside. The car moved off at once. A familiar voice greeted them from
  the corner.</p>

  <p>"My dear Princess and Major Fawley, I owe you the most profound apologies.
  Gustaf is in despair. His restaurant has practically been seized by the
  members of a political party who would be delighted to involve me in a
  scandal&mdash;or worse."</p>

  <p>"We heard shots," Fawley remarked.</p>

  <p>"They were meant for me," Behrling said grimly. "Gustaf had a secret
  message and he hurried me off. It is not for myself I fear. It is for the
  cause."</p>

  <p>"Who was responsible for putting out the light?" Elida asked.</p>

  <p>"An asinine crowd of young bloods," Behrling replied contemptuously, "all
  blindly following that middle-aged rou&eacute;. As a matter of fact, it was
  the best thing that could happen for us. Gustaf was able the easier to
  manoeuvre our departure. By the by, Fawley, if this is going to be the bad
  night that they threatened us with, what about putting you down at your
  Embassy?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he regretted. "For the moment I am not engaged in my country's
  interests. I can claim no privileges."</p>

  <p>"You are not by any chance in disgrace with your own people?" Behrling
  asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Fawley assured him. "I simply asked for a job, found
  there was nothing doing, and took on a mission of observation for a friendly
  power."</p>

  <p>Behrling nodded.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the bar?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing really happened," Fawley replied, with a smile. "Nothing except
  threats, that is to say. A gentleman of the student type offered me his card
  and reminded me of the ancient institution of duelling."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with it?"</p>

  <p>"He tore it up," Elida intervened.</p>

  <p>Behrling nodded approval.</p>

  <p>"In the new Germany," he muttered, "there will be no duels. The blood of
  every citizen will be needed for the nation."</p>

  <p>"You think that there will be war?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>Behrling peered curiously through the obscurity of the vehicle.</p>

  <p>"Is that not already determined upon? There may be war and unless Berati
  makes the one unpardonable mistake, the map of Europe will be altered. I have
  no more to say. Here is your destination. You have made me no promises, Major
  Fawley. You have spoken no word of approval. You have given me no hint as to
  where your sympathies lie. Yet I have a feeling of satisfaction. I am glad
  that we have met."</p>

  <p>He shook hands warmly. Fawley turned to make his adieux to Elida. She too,
  however, was preparing to descend.</p>

  <p>"I am staying with my aunt, who has a suite here," she explained.</p>

  <p>Behrling leaned forward from his corner.</p>

  <p>"Before we meet again, Major Fawley," he prophesied, "there will be a
  great change in this city&mdash;in this country. You are here now in these
  terrifying moments before the storm, when the air is sulphurous and
  overcharged with the thunders to come. You will find us a saner country when
  you return."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>There was the sound of music and many voices as they arrived on the fourth
  floor. At the end of the corridor was a vision of bowing servants and beyond,
  rooms banked with flowers and waving palms. Elida gave one look and stepped
  swiftly back into the lift.</p>

  <p>"I cannot bear it," she told Fawley. "My aunt receives her political
  friends on Thursday evenings and to-night they are all there in force. I can
  hear their voices even here. They will tear themselves to pieces before they
  have finished. There must be, it seems, a hundred different ways of saving
  Germany and every one of my aunt's friends has hold of a different plan. Let
  me come and sit with you for a few minutes. I heard the waiter say that he
  had placed a note in your salon, so I feel that I may come without
  compromising you."</p>

  <p>"By all means," Fawley assented. "My sitting room is not much, but from
  the window one has at least a fine view of the city. Come with the greatest
  pleasure, but," he went on, as they stepped out of the lift and he fitted the
  key in the door of his suite, "do let us leave politics alone for a time. My
  sympathies are of no use to any one. I cannot turn them into action."</p>

  <p>She sighed as she followed him into the rooms and allowed her cloak to
  slip from her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is too bad," she lamented, "because there was never a time in her
  history when Germany more needed the understanding of intelligent
  Anglo-Saxons. So this is where you live?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"For a few hours longer," he reminded her. "I am off to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"To Rome?"</p>

  <p>He remained silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"In these days of long-distance telephones and wireless, a poor government
  messenger never knows where he will be sent."</p>

  <p>He picked up the despatch which lay upon the table and, after a
  questioning glance towards her, opened it. He read it carefully then tore it
  into small pieces.</p>

  <p>"Your plans are changed?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Only confirmed," he answered. "Come and sit before the window and look
  down at this beautiful city. We have an idea in America, you know, or rather
  we used to have, when I was interested in politics, that in order to bring
  about a state of bankruptcy in Berlin, the people beautified their city,
  built new boulevards, new public buildings, and then failed to pay the
  interest on their loans!"</p>

  <p>"It is probably true," Elida assented. "That was all before I took any
  interest in this part of the world. To-day Germany is on her feet again, her
  hands are uplifted, she is feeling for the air. She is trying to drag down
  from the heavens the things that belong to her. Germany has a great future,
  you know, Major Fawley."</p>

  <p>"No one doubts that," he replied.</p>

  <p>She looked around the room curiously and last of all at him, at his drawn
  but wholesome-looking face, his deep-set visionary eyes, his air of immense
  self-control. She took note of all the other things which appeal to a woman,
  the little wave in his hair brushed back by the ears, the humorous lines
  about his firm mouth. He possessed to the fullest extent the distinction of
  the class to which they both belonged.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I become very personal for a few moments?" she asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"So long as you do not find too much fault with me."</p>

  <p>"The men in the Secret Service, whom I have come across," she began, "our
  Italian Secret Service, I mean, of course, and the French, travel under false
  names, generally assuming a different status to their real one. They travel
  with little luggage, they stay in weird hotels in streets that no one ever
  heard of, and life for them seems to be filled with a desire to escape from
  their own personality. Here are you staying in the best-known hotel in Berlin
  under your own name, wearing the clothes and using the speech of your order.
  There on your writing table is your dressing case fitted with an ordinary
  lock and with your name in full stamped upon it. I begin to think that you
  must be a fraud. I should not be surprised to find that your proper name even
  was inscribed in the hotel register."</p>

  <p>"Guilty to everything," he confessed, pushing his chair a little nearer to
  hers and closer to the window. "But then you must remember that the Secret
  Service of the old order has gone out. The memoirs writer and the novelist
  have given away our fireworks. We are only subtle now by being terribly and
  painfully obvious."</p>

  <p>"You may be speaking the truth," she murmured, "but it seems to me that it
  must be a dangerous experiment. I could recall to myself the names of at
  least a dozen people who know that a Major Fawley is here on behalf of a
  certain branch of the Italian Government to see for himself and report upon
  the situation. It would be worth the while of more than one of them to make
  sure that you never returned to Rome."</p>

  <p>"There are certain risks to be run, of course," he admitted. "The only
  point is that I came to the conclusion some years ago that one runs them in a
  more dignified fashion and with just as much chance of success by abandoning
  the old methods."</p>

  <p>She sat perfectly silent for some time. They were both looking downwards
  at the thronged and brilliantly lit streets, the surging masses of human
  beings, listening to the hoarse mutterings of voices punctuated sometimes
  with the shouting of excited pedestrians. There was a certain tenseness
  underneath it all. The trampling of feet upon the pavement was like the
  breaking of an incoming tide. One had the idea of mighty forces straining at
  a yielding leash. Elida swung suddenly around.</p>

  <p>"You play the game of frankness wonderfully," she said bitterly, "but
  there are times when you fall down."</p>

  <p>"As for instance?"</p>

  <p>"When you make enquiries of the concierge about the air services to Rome.
  When you send for a time-table to compare the trains and when you slip into
  the side entrance at Cook's in the twilight an hour or so later and take your
  ticket for England!"</p>

  <p>"You have had me followed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It has been necessary," she told him. "What has England to do with your
  report to Berati?"</p>

  <p>His eyes seemed to be watching the black mass of people below, but he
  smiled reflectively.</p>

  <p>"What an advertisement this last <i>coup</i> of yours is for the open
  methods of diplomacy," he observed. "Would it surprise you very much to know
  that I can take the night plane to Croydon, catch the International Airways
  to Rome, and be there a little quicker than any way I have discovered yet of
  sailing over the Alps?"</p>

  <p>"Will you turn your head and look at me, please?"</p>

  <p>He obeyed at once.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to London, then?" she persisted. "Berati has abandoned
  that old idea of his of seeking English sympathies?"</p>

  <p>Fawley rose to his feet and Elida's heart sank. She knew very well that
  during the last few minutes, ever since, in fact, she had confessed to her
  surveillance over him, she had lost everything she had striven so hard to
  gain. Her bid for his supreme confidence had failed. Before she actually
  realised what had happened, she was moving towards the door. He was speaking
  meaningless words; his tone, his expression had changed. All the humanity
  seemed to have left his face. Even the admiration which had gleamed more than
  once in his eyes and the memory of which she had treasured all the evening
  had become the admiration of a man for an attractive doll.</p>

  <p>"You are under your own roof," he remarked, as he opened the door. "You
  will forgive me if I do not offer to conduct you to your aunt's
  apartment?"</p>

  <p>He bent over her cold fingers.</p>

  <p>"Why are you angry with me?" she asked passionately.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a gleam of sadness in his eyes, the knob of the door
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear Elida," he expostulated, "you know very well that the only
  feeling I dare permit myself to have for you is one of sincere
  admiration."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His Excellency the Marchese Marius di Vasena, Ambassador
  from Italy to the Court of St. James's, threw himself back in his chair and
  held out his hands to his unexpected visitor with a gesture of astonishment.
  He waved his secretary away. It had really been a very anxious week and this
  was a form of relaxation which appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"Elida!" he exclaimed, embracing his favourite niece. "What on earth does
  this mean? I saw pictures of you last week with all the royalties at Monte
  Carlo. Has your aunt any idea?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," Elida laughed.</p>

  <p>"But how did you arrive?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I just came," she replied. "I did not arrive direct. I had some
  places to visit on the way. As a matter of fact, I left Monte Carlo a
  fortnight ago. Yesterday I was in Paris but I had a sudden feeling that I
  must see you, dear Uncle. So here I am!"</p>

  <p>"And the need for all this haste?" the Ambassador asked courteously, as he
  arranged an easy-chair for his niece. "If one could only believe that it was
  impatience to see your elderly but affectionate relative!"</p>

  <p>She laughed&mdash;a soft rippling effort of mirth.</p>

  <p>"I am always happy to see you, my dear Uncle, that you know," she assured
  him. "That is why I was so unhappy when you were given London. Yesterday,
  however, a great desire swept over me."</p>

  <p>"And that was&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"To attend the American Ambassador's dance to-night at Dorrington House. I
  simply could not resist it. Aunt will not mind. You are going to be very
  good-natured and take me&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>The smile faded from the Ambassador's face.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that can easily be arranged," he admitted. "It will not be a
  very gay affair, though. In diplomatic circles, it is rather our close
  season."</p>

  <p>Elida&mdash;she was certainly a very privileged niece&mdash;leaned forward
  and drew out one of the drawers of her uncle's handsome writing table. She
  helped herself to a box of cigarettes and lit one.</p>

  <p>"Yet they tell me," she confided, "I heard it even in Monte Carlo, that
  just now England or Washington&mdash;no one is certain which; perhaps
  both&mdash;are busy forging thunderbolts."</p>

  <p>"No news of it has come my way," the Ambassador declared, with a
  benevolent smile. "If one were ever inclined to give credence to absurd
  rumours, one would look rather nearer home for trouble."</p>

  <p>She leaned over and patted his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Dear doyen of all the diplomats, it is not you who would tell your
  secrets to a little chatterbox of a niece! It seems a pity, for I love being
  interested."</p>

  <p>"<i>Carissima</i>," he murmured, "to-night at Dorrington House you will
  find ten or a dozen terribly impressionable young Americans, two or three of
  them quite fresh from Washington. You will find English statesmen even, who
  have the reputation of being sensitive to feminine charms such as yours and
  who have not the accursed handicap of being your uncle. You will find my own
  youthful staff of budding diplomats, who all imagine that they have secrets
  locked away in their bosoms far more wonderful than any which have been
  confided to me. You will be in your glory, dear Elida, and if you find out
  anything really worth knowing about these thunderbolts, do not forget your
  poor relations!"</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace at him.</p>

  <p>"You have always been inclined to make fun of me, have you not, since I
  became a serious woman?"</p>

  <p>The Marchese assumed an austere air and tone.</p>

  <p>"I do not make fun of you," he assured her. "If I am not too happy to see
  you wrapped up in things which should be left to your elders, it is because
  there is no excitement without danger, and it was not intended that a young
  woman so highly placed, so beautiful as you, should court danger."</p>

  <p>"Me&mdash;court danger?" she exclaimed with wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador's gesture dismissed her protest with a shade of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"You have the misfortune, my dear niece," he continued, "to be by birth
  and education an amazing example of modern cosmopolitanism. Your sister is
  married to a German princeling, whose father is aiming at being Chancellor of
  Germany and who is himself a prominent figure in this latest upheaval. Your
  aunt is almost the only remaining French aristocrat who is permitted to
  interest herself&mdash;behind the scenes naturally&mdash;in French politics.
  Both your brothers, my nephews, have made their mark in our own country and
  are reported to be ambitious."</p>

  <p>"Is all this the prelude to an eulogy or a lecture?" Elida asked.</p>

  <p>"Neither," her uncle answered. "It is just that I am going to take the
  privilege of a near relative and an elderly man, who has at any rate won his
  spurs in diplomacy, to give you a word of advice. There is no place to-day,
  no seemly and dignified place, for women in the underground galleries of
  diplomacy. Spies there must always be and always have been. Cocottes have
  generally been the most successful, but I need not remind you of their
  inevitable fate. The profession is not elastic enough to include members of
  the great families of Europe."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. A puff of wind stole into the room through the
  open windows, bent the lilac blossoms in their vases and wafted their perfume
  into the further recesses of the stately apartment. A Louis XVI clock of blue
  and gold inlay chimed the hour merrily. Elida moved uneasily in her chair. No
  one in the world had ever spoken to her like this.</p>

  <p>"What have you been hearing about me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The Marchese shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One hears," he murmured. "One does not necessarily listen. Now, if you
  take my advice, you will present yourself to your aunt. She is resting for a
  time in her rooms and taking a new face treatment from some New York wizard.
  She will like to know that you are here. By the by, we dine at
  home&mdash;only one or two very dull people&mdash;and we leave for Dorrington
  House at ten-thirty."</p>

  <p>She gave his arm a gentle squeeze and kissed his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I have sent my maid to see which are my rooms," she said. "As soon as I
  have had a bath, I will present myself. Perhaps Aunt Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
  will hand over the new treatment to me. A dignified and unadorned middle age
  is all the mode nowadays."</p>

  <p>"You go and tell her so," her uncle remarked, with a smile.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The Marchese suffered from a fit of unusual restlessness after the
  departure of his favourite niece. He left his chair and paced the room, his
  hands behind his back, an anxious frown upon his forehead. He was an
  exceedingly handsome man of the best Italian type, but he seemed during the
  last few months to have grown older. The lines in his face were deeper, his
  forehead was furrowed, he had even acquired a slight stoop. He was a
  conscientious politician and withal an astute one. There were certain
  features of the present situation which filled him with uneasiness. He took
  up the house telephone and spoke in rapid Italian. In a few minutes a quietly
  dressed young man presented himself. He carried a locked volume under his
  arm. The Ambassador summoned the servant who brought him in.</p>

  <p>"Close all the windows," he ordered. "See that I am not disturbed until I
  ring the bell."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed with the swiftness of the well-trained Italian. The
  Ambassador reseated himself at his desk. He took a key from his chain and
  unlocked the volume.</p>

  <p>"The Princess Elida has arrived, Ottavio," he confided.</p>

  <p>The young man assented.</p>

  <p>"So I understood, Your Excellency."</p>

  <p>The Ambassador turned over the pages of the volume which he had opened and
  paused at a closely written sheet.</p>

  <p>"A fortnight ago," he continued quietly, "my niece was in Berlin. I see
  your reports are all unanimous. She appears to have deserted Von Salzenburg
  and to have left the Prince behind her in Monaco."</p>

  <p>"That is true, Your Excellency."</p>

  <p>"She spent much of her time with Behrling and with an American, who is
  reported to be in the service of Berati."</p>

  <p>"I can vouch for the truth of that, Your Excellency."</p>

  <p>"The American arrived unexpectedly in London a few days ago," the
  Ambassador went on. "You brought me word of his coming, although he has not
  presented himself here. Perhaps that is policy. Do you know what he has been
  doing in the capital?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible to ascertain, Your Excellency. His movements did not come
  within the scope of my observations."</p>

  <p>The Ambassador nodded. He read through another page, then he carefully
  locked up the volume and returned it.</p>

  <p>"It would appear," he remarked, "that my niece's sympathies, at any rate,
  have been transferred to Behrling. One might consider her almost an
  opportunist."</p>

  <p>"Behrling to-day," the young man said firmly, "is the master of
  Germany."</p>

  <p>The Ambassador handed him back the volume and sighed.</p>

  <p>"That will do, Ottavio," he said. "I should like, during the next few
  days, to have an interview arranged with the American Ambassador."</p>

  <p>"The matter shall be attended to, Excellency. In the meantime, I am
  charged with a somewhat serious communication from the Captain Varzi,
  Commander Borzacchini and Air Pilot Nuvolari. They desire to know whether
  they may pay their respects or whether it would be better for them to take
  leave of absence without announcement."</p>

  <p>Again there was silence. The Marchese looked up wearily. He seemed
  suddenly conscious of the gloom of the apartment, with its drawn curtains and
  closed windows.</p>

  <p>"It was a message by wireless a few hours ago, Excellency. They would
  wish, subject to your permission, to attend the ball at Dorrington House
  to-night and to leave separately before morning."</p>

  <p>"I have no jurisdiction," the Marchese pronounced. "They must obey such
  orders as they have received. Have you any further information?"</p>

  <p>"None, Your Excellency, except a hint that the urgency is not so great as
  might seem. About the middle of next week, perhaps, we may expect official
  news. Is it permitted to ask Your Excellency a question?"</p>

  <p>"With the proviso that he answers it only if he feels inclined to," was
  the weary reply.</p>

  <p>"The Department has received a very cautiously worded enquiry as to this
  American, Major Martin Fawley," the young man confided. "It seems that he has
  been in Rome and on the French Riviera, from which one understands that he
  had to make a precipitate departure. Then he turned up in Berlin and if our
  information is correct, Excellency, he was seen once or twice with Her
  Highness the Princess Elida. We have been asked quite unofficially whether we
  can give any information as to the nature of his activities."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know the answer well enough," the Marchese replied irritably.
  "I have no knowledge of Major Fawley. Of my niece's acquaintances or
  companions I naturally can keep no count. If he is a suspected person, I
  regret her association with him; otherwise there is nothing to be said."</p>

  <p>The young man took silent and respectful leave of his chief. The
  Ambassador, who was a very much worried man, lit a cigarette and studied the
  neatly typed list of his engagements for the next few days with a groan.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was the moment for the sake of which Elida had made many
  sacrifices. She had, for the first time in her life, disobeyed certain
  instructions issued from a beautiful white stone and marble building in the
  Plaza Corregio at Rome, instructions signed by the hand of a very great man
  indeed. Not only that but, in quartering herself upon a relative whom she
  loved better than any other amongst her somewhat extensive family, she had
  involved him in many possible embarrassments. As she sat there, she felt that
  she had offended against the code of her life and, listening to the music in
  the distant rooms, the hum of joyous voices, watching men in brilliant
  uniforms and beautifully gowned women pass back and forth, she felt conscious
  of a sense of shame. Yet it all seemed worth while when young Hartley
  Stammers, second secretary at the American Embassy, the acquaintance of a few
  hours, from whom she had begged this favour, and Fawley, a quietly
  distinguished-looking figure in his plain evening clothes amongst this
  colourful gathering, suddenly appeared upon the threshold. The light which
  flashed for a single moment in his eyes filled her with a sort of painful
  joy. For the first time, she felt weak of purpose. She was filled with a
  longing to abandon at that moment and forever this stealthy groping through
  the tortuous ways of life, to respond instead to that momentary challenge
  with everything she had to give. Perhaps if the mask had not fallen quite so
  quickly, she might have yielded.</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a great pleasure, Princess," Fawley said courteously, as
  he raised her fingers to his lips. "I had no idea that you thought of coming
  to London."</p>

  <p>"Nor I until&mdash;well, it seems only a few hours ago," she said. "My
  aunt has not been well and my uncle&mdash;you know him, I dare say&mdash;he
  is our Ambassador here&mdash;begged me to pay him a flying visit. So here I
  am! Arrived this evening. Will you not sit down, Major Fawley? I should like
  so much that we talk for a little time."</p>

  <p>The younger man took regretful leave. Elida smiled at him delightfully. He
  had fulfilled a difficult mission and she was grateful.</p>

  <p>"You will not forget, Mr. Stammers, that we dance later in the evening,"
  she reminded him. "You must show me some of your new steps. None of our
  Italian men can dance like you Americans."</p>

  <p>"I will be glad to," the boy promised a little ruefully. "I have a list of
  duty hops down here which makes me tired. I'll surely cut some of them, if I
  can. Being sort of office boy of the place, they seem to leave me to do the
  cleaning up."</p>

  <p>He took his leave, followed by Elida's benediction. The quiet place for
  which she had asked fulfilled all its purposes. It was an alcove, as yet
  undiscovered by the majority of the guests, leading from one of the smaller
  refreshment rooms. Fawley sank onto the divan by her side.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come to London?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Is this bluntness part of the new diplomacy they talk about?" she
  retorted.</p>

  <p>"It is the oldest weapon man has," he declared. "It is rather effective,
  you see, because it really demands a reply."</p>

  <p>"What you really want to know," she reflected, "is whether I followed
  you."</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort. Perhaps you may have had quite different ideas. I
  can assure you that so far as I am concerned&mdash;" he left the sentence
  unfinished. A very rare thing with him.</p>

  <p>"I came here expressly to see you," she suddenly confessed. "It is quite
  important."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me."</p>

  <p>"You know all your people in Rome, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. We Americans always know one another. We do not keep ourselves
  in water-tight compartments."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Marston is a great friend of mine," she said. "Poor man, just now he
  seems so worried."</p>

  <p>"What? Jimmie Marston?" Fawley exclaimed. "That sounds quaint to me. I
  don't think I ever saw him when he did not look happy."</p>

  <p>"He is what you call in your very expressive language a bluffer," she
  answered. "I know what the matter is with him now. He is terrified lest at
  any moment he may find himself in the imbroglio of a European war."</p>

  <p>Like a flash the relaxation passed from Fawley's expression. His tone was
  unchanged but he had relapsed into the stony-faced, polite, but casual guest,
  performing his social duties.</p>

  <p>"Our dear old friend," he observed, "is probably having an unfortunate
  love affair. He is the only one of our diplomats who has achieved the blue
  ribbon of the profession and remained a lover of women. They really ought not
  to have given him Rome. It was trying him too high."</p>

  <p>"Yet not long ago," she reminded him, "you were pursuing your vocation
  there."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but then I am not a lover of women," he declared.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether it matters," she went on. "I mean, I wonder whether,
  outside the pages of the novelist, ambassadors ever do give away startling
  secrets to the Delilahs of my sex, and whether," she added, with a flash of
  her beautiful eyes, "they ever win successes with a whisper which should cost
  them a lifetime's devotion."</p>

  <p>With a murmured request for permission, he followed her example and lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"One would like to believe in that sort of thing," he reflected, "but I do
  not think there is much of it nowadays. Whispers are too easily traced back
  and if you once drop out of a profession, it is terribly difficult to
  re&euml;stablish yourself. We Americans, as you must have found out for
  yourself, are an intensely practical people. We would not consider any woman
  in the world worth the loss of our career."</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her corner of the divan and laughed melodiously.</p>

  <p>"What gallantry!"</p>

  <p>There was a certain return of good humour in his kindly smile.</p>

  <p>"Let us be thankful at any rate," he said, "that our relations are such
  that we do not need to borrow the one from the other."</p>

  <p>Her fingers played nervously with her vanity case.</p>

  <p>"That may not last," she murmured, almost under her breath. "I did not
  follow you here for nothing."</p>

  <p>He listened to the music.</p>

  <p>"Rather a good tune?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Neither did I follow you here to dance with you."</p>

  <p>He sighed regretfully.</p>

  <p>"The worst of even the byways of my profession," he lamented, "is that
  duty so often interferes with pleasure. The Chief's wife who, as I dare say
  you know, is my cousin, has given me a special list here and I have to take
  the wife of the French Naval Attach&eacute; in to supper."</p>

  <p>"I shall not keep you," she promised. "I should probably have sent you
  away before now if I had not felt reluctant to say what I came to say. Sit
  down for one moment and leave me when you please. It is necessary."</p>

  <p>"Necessary?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded. She was less at her ease than he had ever seen her. Her
  exquisite fingers were playing nervously with a jewel which hung from her
  neck.</p>

  <p>"I think I told you once that I saw quite a good deal of your young
  brother in Rome during the hunting season."</p>

  <p>"Micky?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The one in the Embassy. Third secretary, is he not?"</p>

  <p>Fawley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about him?"</p>

  <p>"He is not quite so discreet as you are."</p>

  <p>A queer silence. The sound of the music seemed to have faded away. When he
  spoke, his voice was lower than ever but there was an almost active
  belligerency in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Just what do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You are going to hate me, so get ready for it."</p>

  <p>"For the first time in my life," he muttered, "I am inclined to wish that
  you were a man."</p>

  <p>She was hardening a little. The first step was taken, at any rate.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not, you see, and you can do nothing about it. Here is a
  scrappy note from your brother which I received a short time ago. It is
  written, as you see, on the Embassy note paper."</p>

  <p>She handed him an envelope. He drew out its contents deliberately and read
  the half sheet of paper.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Dear Princess,<br>
    <br>
    I rather fancy that I am crazy but here you are. I send you copies of the
    last three code cables from Washington to the Chief. I have no access to
    the code and I cannot see what use they can be to you without it, but I
    have kept my word.<br>
    <br>
    Don't forget our dance to-morrow night.<br>
    <br>
    Micky.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Fawley folded up the note and returned it.</p>

  <p>"The copies of the various cables," she remarked, "were enclosed. Rather
  ingenuous of the boy, was it not, to imagine that any one who interested
  themselves at all in the undercurrents of diplomacy had not the means of
  decoding despatches? They were all three very unimportant, though. They did
  not tell me what I wished to know."</p>

  <p>There was a tired look in his eyes but otherwise he remained
  impassive.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "it was ingenuous. It just shows that it is not quite
  fair to bring these lads fresh from college into a world where they meet
  women like you. Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"The cables," she continued, "and your brother's note, if you wish for it,
  are at your disposal, in return for accurate knowledge of just one
  thing."</p>

  <p>"What is it you wish to know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I wish to know why you came here to London instead of taking the
  information you collected in Germany straight to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Whether Washington and London are likely to come to any agreement."</p>

  <p>"Upon what?"</p>

  <p>"Some great event which even the giants fear to whisper about."</p>

  <p>"I have seldom," he declared, rising to his feet and beckoning to a young
  man who was standing upon the threshold of the anteroom, looking in, "spent
  an hour in which the elements of humour and pleasure were so admirably
  blended. Dickson, young fellow, you are in luck," he went on, addressing the
  friend to whom he had signalled. "I am permitted to present you to the
  Princess di Vasena. Put your best foot foremost, and if you can dance as well
  as you used to, heaven is about to open before you. Princess&mdash;to our
  next meeting."</p>

  <p>He bowed unusually low and strolled away. She looked after him
  thoughtfully as she made room for the newcomer by her side.</p>

  <p>"You were wondering?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"When that meeting will be, for one thing. Major Fawley is always so
  mysterious. Shall we dance?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley, during the course of his wanderings about the world,
  had years ago decided upon London as his headquarters and occupied in his
  hours of leisure a very delightful apartment in the Albany. At ten o'clock on
  the evening following the ball at Dorrington House a freckled young man,
  still in flying clothes, was ushered into his room by the family servant whom
  he had brought with him from New York and established as caretaker.</p>

  <p>"Mister Michael, sir," the latter announced. "Shall I serve dinner
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Cocktails first," Fawley ordered, "then dinner as soon as you like. You
  won't need to change, Micky. Just get out of those ghoulish-looking clothes,
  have your bath and put on a dressing gown or anything you like. That is,
  unless you want to go out. I am not moving myself this evening."</p>

  <p>The young man appeared doubtful.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Martin old chap," he confessed, "I have a very particular
  friend over in London just now. I thought of trying to see if I could locate
  her."</p>

  <p>"The Princess di Vasena?" his brother enquired casually.</p>

  <p>Micky stared at him.</p>

  <p>"How the mischief did you guess?"</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"This is not like home, you know, Micky. Here you have to picture to
  yourself nations and individuals all standing on tiptoe and crazy to get to
  know everybody else's business. The whole place is like a beastly whispering
  gallery."</p>

  <p>"Still, I don't see how&mdash;" the boy began, with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"Go and get your bath and dry up," his brother interrupted. "I will send
  Jenkins in with a cocktail."</p>

  <p>"Jove, that sounds good," Micky admitted. "I sha'n't be longer than twenty
  minutes. Awfully decent of you to wait dinner."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The cocktails tasted good, as indeed they were, for granted the right
  material, the American touch on the shaker is after all the most subtle in
  the world. The dinner was excellent and the bottle of Pommery '14 iced to
  perfection was a dream. Michael Fawley, a rather loosely built but
  pleasant-looking lad, drew a deep sigh of content as he lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know what you were in such a devil of a hurry to see me
  for, Martin old chap," he observed, "but it is pretty well worth it, even if
  they dock me the three days off my leave. French champagne tastes all wrong
  in Italy, and though the food is good enough for a time it's
  monotonous&mdash;too many <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i> and knickknacks for my
  taste. This is like New York again."</p>

  <p>"You always were fond of New York, weren't you, Micky?" his brother
  remarked speculatively.</p>

  <p>"I'll say so," the boy assented. "New York and the summer life on Long
  Island should be good enough for anybody."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad."</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" Micky demanded, with a match hovering over
  the bowl of his pipe.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I think you would be better out of this diplomatic business,
  young fellow," his brother said. "I want you to post your resignation to
  Washington to-night."</p>

  <p>The match burnt out between the lad's fingers. He laid down his pipe and
  stared.</p>

  <p>"For the love of Mike, what are you talking about, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"You are too susceptible for our job, Micky," was the grave reply. "A
  little too credulous."</p>

  <p>"Gee!" the young man muttered under his breath.</p>

  <p>"I came across the Princess di Vasena last night," Fawley confided. "I am
  not going to say hard things about her because, after all, I am in the same
  job myself, and if we take it on at all, we have to go right through with it.
  It happens that there is something she wants very badly from me just now and
  she tried to bargain for it with a copy of those cables you sent her,
  Micky."</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me," the boy cried in horror, "that the Princess di
  Vasena&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, come," Fawley interrupted. "Don't make such a tragedy of it, Micky.
  It isn't worth it. I could have told you directly I heard her name that you
  would have to be careful. She is in our Black Book but, of course, that
  doesn't come round to the juniors. We don't think that they ought to know
  everything. There is no actual mischief done, I am glad to say, but
  that&mdash;to put it plainly&mdash;is not your fault."</p>

  <p>Micky was petrified into a stark and paralysed silence. His hands were
  gripping the side of the table. He was ghastly pale. Fawley leaned over for a
  cigarette and lit it.</p>

  <p>"There is just one rough word to be said, Micky," he continued, "and you
  can guess how I hate to say it, but it is better to get it over. You have
  offended against the code. You have to pay. It will be my business to see
  that no one knows anything about it, but you must post your resignation to
  Washington to-night and you must catch&mdash;let me see, I think it is the
  <i>Homeric</i> the day after to-morrow for New York."</p>

  <p>Micky picked up his pipe, relit it and smoked for a moment or two in
  silence. He came of good stock. He showed no signs of whimpering.</p>

  <p>"You are dead right, Martin," he blundered out at last. "I cannot think
  how in hell I came to do it. It was not as though she vamped me, made any
  promises or that sort of thing. I was simply almighty crazy."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, old chap," his brother remarked consolingly, "the thing is
  over and done with and so, perhaps fortunately, is your diplomatic career.
  You were not cut out for it. Fortunately, those cables did not tell the
  Princess what she wanted to know. There is no real harm done&mdash;only a
  great principle broken. I hope we will see you over this side again, Micky,
  for the Walker Cup next year. You are a good lad, but I think you are better
  at golf than at diplomacy."</p>

  <p>Micky walked over to the writing table and drew out a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"Dictate, Martin," he invited.</p>

  <p>Fawley stood at the window looking out, with his hands behind him. He knew
  precisely how much of his brother's composure was assumed and he took care to
  keep his face averted.</p>

  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  <p>"Who has given me leave of absence?" the boy asked, looking up.</p>

  <p>"Douglas Miller over here is able to deal with all these slight matters.
  Your Chief, as you know, is on the high seas. I told Miller what is quite
  true&mdash;that your family affairs at home were in the devil of a mess. You
  have far too much money, you know, Micky, like all of us, and he agreed to
  your getting out at once. There has not been a suspicion of anything else.
  There never will be, unless you give it away yourself."</p>

  <p>"And the Princess?" the boy faltered hopelessly. "Sha'n't I ever see her
  again?"</p>

  <p>Fawley made no reply for the moment, then he swung slowly round in his
  chair. Micky, the personification of rather sulky boyhood, was leaning back
  on the divan with his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"How old are you, Micky?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"The Princess is thirty-two," Fawley confided. "There is nothing in the
  world to be said against her. She is noted throughout Europe as a woman of
  great charm and many accomplishments. She has, also, a little more brain than
  is good for her. I do not fancy that she has much time for boys, Micky,
  except when she can make use of them."</p>

  <p>"Rubbing it in, aren't you?" the other muttered.</p>

  <p>"For your own good, young fellow."</p>

  <p>"I can look after myself," the boy grumbled.</p>

  <p>"On Long Island, yes. At Newport, very likely. At any petting party at Bar
  Harbor I think you might be a star. But over here, you are a trifle out of
  the game, Micky. We experienced ones have to don our armour when we come up
  against women like Elida."</p>

  <p>"Hello!" Micky exclaimed. "Do you call her by her Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"A slip of the tongue," Fawley confessed. "All the same, we have met quite
  a number of times lately. I don't mind telling you, Micky, in confidence,
  that she is the only woman who has ever tempted me to wish that I had never
  taken on my particular branch of work."</p>

  <p>The younger man whistled softly. He was rather a cub in some matters but
  he was honestly fond of his brother.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you chuck it and marry her, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"Mine is just one of those professions, Micky," he said, "which is pretty
  difficult to chuck. When you are once in it, you are in it for good or for
  evil. If you once leave the subterranean places and come out into the
  sunshine, there are risks. People do not forgive."</p>

  <p>"Have you been looking for any particular sort of trouble, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so. At any rate, I have this consolation. The goal towards which
  I have been working for years is worth while. Any man in the world would feel
  justified in devoting his whole life, every energy of his brain, every drop
  of blood in his body towards its accomplishment, yet I cannot even make up my
  own mind whether my last few months' energies have been the energies of an
  honourable man. I should hate to be arraigned at any court in which my
  conscience would be the judge."</p>

  <p>"That damned Quaker streak in our family cropping up," the young man
  muttered sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," his brother agreed. "After all, it is the old question of
  whether the end can justify the means. Soon I shall be face to face with the
  results which will tell me that; then I shall know whether I shall ever be
  able to rid myself of the fetters or not."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Micky speculated, "what makes you so eager to get out of
  harness. You were always the worker in our family."</p>

  <p>"The same damned silly reason, I suppose, which has brought your
  diplomatic career to an end," Fawley answered, with a note of savagery in his
  tone. "Within thirty seconds of knowing Elida di Vasena, I saved her from
  committing a murder. Within five minutes I had the evidence in my hand which
  would have sent her out to be shot as a spy, and within ten minutes I knew
  that I cared for her more than any other woman I have ever known."</p>

  <p>"Does she know?" Micky asked, with a note of reverence in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Was there ever a woman who did not know when she had succeeded in making
  a fool of a man?" Fawley rejoined bitterly. "I have not told her, if that is
  what you mean. I doubt whether I ever shall tell her."</p>

  <p>Jenkins presented himself upon the threshold. He stood on one side as he
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>"The Princess di Vasena, sir," he announced.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was evident from the moment of her entrance that Elida
  was not entirely her usual composed self. She was breathing rapidly as though
  she had run up the stairs. Her eyes darted restlessly around the room. The
  sight of Micky in no way discomposed her. She drew a sigh of relief, as
  though the thing which she had feared to see was absent. She nodded to the
  young man as she held out her hand to Fawley.</p>

  <p>"You see that my brother is here to answer for his sins," he remarked.</p>

  <p>She sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Poor Micky!" she exclaimed. "Some day I hope he will forgive me when he
  understands."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I forgive you all right," Micky conceded. "I was just an ass. Didn't
  quite understand what I was doing, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Do any of us?" she lamented. "Please give me a cigarette, Martin. You
  have, perhaps, some brandy. I have been greatly disturbed and I am not
  well."</p>

  <p>Fawley produced cigarettes, touched the bell and ordered the liqueur.
  Elida took one sip and set the glass down. She looked half fearfully at her
  host.</p>

  <p>"The little girl of Krust&mdash;Greta&mdash;she has not been here?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," Fawley assured her. "I have not seen her since I
  left Berlin."</p>

  <p>"Nor Krust? Nor Maurice von Thal?"</p>

  <p>"Not one of them."</p>

  <p>She seemed a trifle relieved. She threw open her cloak a little and tapped
  a cigarette upon the table. Her eyes were still full of trouble.</p>

  <p>"I am almost afraid to ask my next question," she confessed. "Pietro
  Patoni?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head. This time he was bewildered but grave. If Patoni
  was in London, there might indeed be trouble.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him," he assured Elida, "since I was in Rome."</p>

  <p>"I know the fellow," Micky put in. "Nephew of a holy cardinal, with eyes
  like beads. Looked like a cross between a stork and a penguin."</p>

  <p>Elida smiled despite her agitation.</p>

  <p>"Kindly remember that he is my cousin," she said. "Anyhow, I am thankful
  that he has not found you out yet, Martin. I have word that he is in London,
  and if he is in London, it is because he is looking for you. And if Krust is
  in London, or any of his emissaries, it is because they are looking for you.
  And if Greta or Nina are here, they are here for the same reason."</p>

  <p>"Well, my name is in the directory," Fawley observed, "both here and in
  New York. I am perfectly easy to find. What do they want with me?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Elida confided, "that they all want to kill
  you&mdash;especially Pietro."</p>

  <p>"He looks just that sort of pleasant fellow," Fawley remarked.</p>

  <p>"He hates all of us Americans," Micky grumbled. "He was never even
  decently civil to me."</p>

  <p>Elida took another sip of her <i>fine</i>, lit a second cigarette and
  relaxed. A slight tinge of colour came into her cheeks. Her lovely eyes had
  lost their tiredness.</p>

  <p>"It is not so much that he hates Americans," she explained. "He resents
  their interference in European politics. He has a very clear idea of how the
  destinies of Italy should be shaped and just now there are rumours passing
  across Europe which are stupefying everybody. I came over myself to see if I
  could learn anything of the truth. I am ashamed of what I did but I wanted so
  much to know."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were pleading with Fawley's. He avoided their direct
  challenge.</p>

  <p>"To revert to this question of Prince Patoni and his antipathies," he
  said, "I should not think that America herself was very keen about any
  individual interference upon this side."</p>

  <p>"Please do not try to mislead me any more," Elida begged. "I understand
  that I may not have your confidence&mdash;perhaps I do not deserve
  it&mdash;but you need not try to throw dust in my eyes. There is something
  else I have to say."</p>

  <p>She glanced at Micky and hesitated. He rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I will be toddling off, Martin," he announced. "Good night,
  Princess."</p>

  <p>"No ill will, Mister Micky?" she asked, smiling. "Those cables were
  terribly uninteresting. They did me no good whatever."</p>

  <p>He made a wry face.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he rejoined gruffly. "They didn't give me much of a boost!"</p>

  <p>She waited patiently until the door was closed behind him then she turned
  almost hysterically to Fawley.</p>

  <p>"Why have you not reported to Berati?" she cried breathlessly. "Tell me
  what has brought you here? Do you know that you are in danger?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I realised that," he answered. "One always has to watch
  one's step, of course. I did not go back to Berati because I had not finished
  my job."</p>

  <p>"What part of it have you to finish here in England?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I had most of my clothes stolen in Berlin," he confided. "I had to come
  and visit my tailor."</p>

  <p>"Is that sort of thing worth while with me?" she protested. "Do you not
  understand that I have come here to warn you?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"This is London," he told her. "I am in sanctuary."</p>

  <p>"Do you really believe that?" she asked wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do."</p>

  <p>Elida shook her head. She seemed very tired. There was a note of despair
  in her tone.</p>

  <p>"That man Berati is always right," she lamented. "He told me that the
  ideal Secret Service man or woman did not exist. They are all either too
  brave or too cowardly. If you have no fear, you have no caution. If you have
  no caution, you are to be caught by the heels. Very well. For you, perhaps,
  that may be nothing. Life must end with all of us, but for your work it is
  finality. The knowledge you have acquired is lost. You are a failure."</p>

  <p>"You really have a great gift of intelligence, Elida," Fawley declared, in
  a noncommittal tone.</p>

  <p>"It does not amount to intelligence," she objected. "It is common sense.
  Very well. Let us continue. You think that you are safe in London, when you
  have failed to report to Berati, when there are rumours going about in Rome
  that you are not to be trusted, that you have all the time been working for a
  cause of your own, concerning which no one knows anything. Italy has sent
  over her spies. They are here now. In Germany, they have the same distrust.
  Krust has given word that you are to be removed and Krust has more assassins
  at his back than any man in the world. Maurice von Thal swore only three
  nights ago that this next time he would not fail. Even Behrling has doubts of
  you! In France it is almost as bad. They suspect you of double espionage and
  of selling some great secret of theirs of which even I know nothing."</p>

  <p>"It all sounds very unpleasant," Fawley murmured under his breath.</p>

  <p>She took a cigarette from the box. Her slim beautiful fingers were shaking
  so that she lit it with difficulty. Fawley bent over her and steadied her
  hand. She looked up at him pathetically.</p>

  <p>"Now I shall qualify for the executioner's bullet," she went on. "There is
  one of Berati's spies outside on the pavement at the present moment. Another
  one has applied for a position as valet in this building. I do not say that
  either of these men has instructions to proceed to extremes. I do not know.
  This I do know. They are to keep a faithful record of your movements hour by
  hour and minute by minute. Patoni, on the other hand, scoffs at such
  mildness. He, like Maurice, has sworn to kill you on sight. Krust's men have
  the same instructions and they are clever&mdash;diabolically clever. You will
  see that the situation is not wholly agreeable, my friend."</p>

  <p>"It certainly is not," was the grim reply.</p>

  <p>"So now again I ask you," Elida continued, "what are you doing in London,
  Martin, when you should be in Rome? You acquired a great deal of information
  in Berlin which Berati needs. You are his man. What are you doing in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you just yet," Fawley said gravely. "But, Elida,
  believe me when I tell you that I am not working for the harm of Italy or
  Germany or France. I may not have kept my word to the letter with any one of
  these countries, or rather with their representatives to whom I</p>

  <p>have talked, but I have been aiming at great things. If the great things
  come, it does not matter what happens to me. And they may come. In the
  meantime, I can do so little. A single false movement and calamity might
  follow."</p>

  <p>"You speak in riddles," Elida faltered, "but I trust you, Martin. None of
  the others do. I trust you, dear Martin. If I could help&mdash;if I could
  save you&mdash;I would give my life!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he took her lightly and reverently, yet with a faint touch of
  the lover, into his arms. The worn look passed from her face. Her eyes
  suddenly lost their terrified gleam, a tremor of joy seemed to pass through
  her body. He drew quietly away but he kept her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he asked, "are you here officially?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"They do not trust me any more," she confided.</p>

  <p>"Then why are you here?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyes. Since those last few minutes they were so soft and
  sweet, so full of expression, that at that moment she was entirely and
  utterly convincing.</p>

  <p>"Because I am such a big fool. Because I like to see you. Because I knew
  that you were in danger on every side. I had to tell you. You must have
  thought me such an ordinary little adventuress," she said wistfully. "You
  will forgive me for that? All that I wanted to know I wanted to know for your
  sake&mdash;that I might help you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly half flung, half kicked open. Micky, in his pyjamas,
  swayed upon the threshold. All his fresh colour had gone. He was gripping the
  wainscoting as though for support. There was an ugly splash of colour on his
  chest.</p>

  <p>"Fellow in your room, Martin," he faltered. "Room&mdash;Jenkins told me I
  was to sleep. Must have been&mdash;hiding somewhere."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Fawley half carried, half dragged his brother to a couch. Elida sprang to
  the bell and kept her finger upon it.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the fellow, Micky?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"Looked like a foreigner. He came out from behind the wardrobe&mdash;only
  a few feet away&mdash;and shot at me just as I was getting into bed."</p>

  <p>Fawley gave swift orders to Jenkins, who was already in the room. Elida
  had possessed herself of a cloth and was making a bandage.</p>

  <p>"There will be a doctor here in a minute, Micky," his brother said. "Close
  your eyes. I must have a look. Elida is making a bandage for you. Missed your
  heart by a thirtieth of an inch, thank God," he went on. "Don't faint, old
  chap. I can't give you a drink, but I am going to rub some brandy on your
  lips. God, what a fool I was to let you sleep in my room!"</p>

  <p>"An undersized little rat," Micky gasped, with feeble indignation. "I
  could have squeezed the life out of him if he'd given me the chance. He
  turned out the lights and stole up behind. What are you in trouble with the
  Dagos for, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"You think he was a Dago, then?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. What about the police?"</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We ought to send for them, I suppose, but it is not altogether etiquette
  in the profession."</p>

  <p>"Am I in on one of your jobs, then, Martin?" the boy asked, with a weak
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Looks like it," his brother assented. "I'm damned sorry. It was Jenkins'
  fault, putting you in there. You were not prepared, of course."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't think it was necessary to hold a gun in your right hand
  and untie your tie with the left in London," Micky grumbled.</p>

  <p>Then the door swung open. The man with the bald head, the beady eyes and
  the long jaw stood upon the threshold. He seemed to grasp the situation in a
  moment. With an impatient turn of the shoulder, he threw back the long
  evening cape he was wearing. His hand flashed out just too late. He was
  looking into the muzzle of Fawley's steadily held and vicious-looking
  revolver.</p>

  <p>"That won't do here, Patoni," the latter said, in a voice such as no one
  in the room had ever heard him use before. "Drop your gun. Before I count
  three, mind. There's going to be none of that sort of thing.
  One&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Patoni's weapon fell smoothly on to the carpet. Fawley kicked it towards
  Elida, who stooped and picked it up. From outside they heard the rattle of
  the lift.</p>

  <p>"That's the doctor," Fawley announced. "Micky, can you get back to your
  room? You will find Jenkins there to help you."</p>

  <p>"I guess so," the young man replied, moving unsteadily towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"An accident, remember," Fawley continued. "You were unpacking your gun
  and it went off&mdash;shaking a cartridge out or anything you like. The
  doctor won't be too particular. He leaves that sort of thing to the police
  and we don't want the police in on this."</p>

  <p>There were hurried footsteps outside and the door was thrown open. Jenkins
  was there, the doctor, the liftman. Micky staggered towards them.</p>

  <p>"Take Mr. Michael into my room, Jenkins," Fawley ordered. "Let the doctor
  examine him there and report. I have looked at the wound. I do not think it
  is dangerous. Close the door and leave us."</p>

  <p>Fawley's voice was not unduly raised but some quality in it seemed to
  compel obedience. They all disappeared. Elida, obeying a gesture from him,
  closed the door. He pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Prince," he directed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley, gentle though he was in his methods, was running no
  risks. He seated himself at his desk, his revolver lying within a few inches
  of his fingers. Patoni was a yard or so away towards the middle of the room.
  Elida was on Fawley's left.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me, Prince Patoni?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>The Italian's eyes were full of smouldering anger.</p>

  <p>"A great deal," he answered. "General Berati has sent me here with an
  order which I have in my pocket&mdash;you can see it when you
  choose&mdash;that you accompany me at once to Rome. Furthermore, I am here to
  know what my cousin the Princess Elida is doing in London, and particularly
  what she is doing in your room at this hour of the night."</p>

  <p>"That is my own affair entirely," Elida declared. "He is an impertinent
  fellow, this cousin of mine," she went on, turning to Fawley. "He follows me
  about. He persecutes me. In Rome it is not permitted. There are too many of
  my own people there. I have a brother, if I need a protector."</p>

  <p>"Is it not true," he demanded, "that you were once engaged to me?"</p>

  <p>"For four days," she answered. "Then I discovered that I hated your type.
  Proceed with your business with Major Fawley. Leave me out of it, if you
  please."</p>

  <p>Patoni's eyes flamed for a moment with malignant fire. He turned his
  shoulder upon her and faced Fawley. For the moment he had lost his guise of
  the cardinal's nephew, the politician's secretary. His rasping tone, his
  drawn-up frame once more recalled the cavalry officer.</p>

  <p>"I have told you, Major Fawley," he said, "that I have in my pocket an
  order from General Berati requiring your immediate presence in Rome. I have
  an aeroplane waiting at Heston now. I should be glad to know whether it would
  be convenient for you to leave at dawn."</p>

  <p>"Most inconvenient," Fawley answered. "Besides, I hate the early morning
  air. Why does the General want me before my work is finished?"</p>

  <p>"He demands to know what part of the work he entrusted you with concerns
  England?"</p>

  <p>"He will find that easy to understand later on," was the smooth
  rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"I am not talking about later on," Patoni declared harshly. "I am talking
  about now. I represent General Berati. You can see my mandate if you will. I
  am your Chief. What are you doing in England when you should have taken the
  information you gained in Berlin direct to Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Working still for the good of your country," Fawley assured him.</p>

  <p>"No one has asked you to work independently for the good of our country,"
  was the swift retort. "You have been asked to obey orders, to study certain
  things and report on them. Not one of these concerns England. You are not
  supposed to employ any initiative. You are supposed to work to orders."</p>

  <p>"I must have misunderstood the position," Fawley observed. "I never work
  in that way. I preserve my own independence always. Was Berati not satisfied
  with me for my work on the frontier?"</p>

  <p>"It was fine work," Patoni admitted grudgingly. "To show you that I am not
  prejudiced, I will tell you something. Five men we have sent one after the
  other to check the details of your work, to confirm the startling information
  you submitted as to the calibre of the anti-aircraft guns and to report
  further upon the object of the subterranean work which has been carried to
  our side of the frontier. One by one they disappeared. Not one of the five
  has returned alive!"</p>

  <p>"It was murder to send them," Fawley remarked. "I do not say that they
  might not have done as well as I did if they had been the first, but
  unfortunately I did not get clean away, and after that the French garrison
  redoubled their guards."</p>

  <p>"The matter of the frontier is finished and done with," Patoni declared.
  "I have no wish to sit here talking. Here are the General's
  instructions."</p>

  <p>He drew a paper from his pocket and smoothed it out in front of Fawley.
  The latter glanced at it and pushed it away.</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, beyond a doubt," he admitted. "The only thing is that I
  am not coming with you."</p>

  <p>"You refuse?" Patoni demanded, his voice shaking with anger.</p>

  <p>"I refuse," Fawley reiterated. "I am a nervous man and I have learnt to
  take care of myself. When you introduce yourself into my apartment, following
  close upon an attempt at assassination by one of your countrymen, I find
  myself disinclined to remain alone in your company during that lonely flight
  over the Alps, or anywhere else, in fact."</p>

  <p>"This will mean trouble," Patoni warned him.</p>

  <p>"What more serious trouble can it mean," Fawley asked, "than that you
  should commence your mission to me&mdash;if ever you had one&mdash;by having
  one of your myrmidons steal into my bedroom and nearly murder my brother, who
  was unfortunately occupying it in my place? That is a matter which has to be
  dealt with between you and me, Patoni."</p>

  <p>The Italian's right hand groped for a minute to the spot where the hilt of
  his sword might have been.</p>

  <p>"That is a private affair," he said. "I am ready to deal with it at any
  time. I am a Patoni and we are in the direct line with the Di Rezcos. The
  presence of my cousin in your rooms is a matter to be dealt with at
  once."</p>

  <p>"It will be dealt with by ordering you out of them," Fawley retorted, as
  he pressed the bell.</p>

  <p>Patoni sprang to his feet. He looked more than ever like some long, lean
  bird of prey.</p>

  <p>"This is an insult!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Elida rose from her chair and moved over between the two men. It was her
  cousin whom she addressed.</p>

  <p>"No brawling in my presence, if you please," she insisted. "You have put
  yourself hopelessly in the wrong, Pietro. A would-be assassin cannot claim to
  be treated as a man of honour."</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"A would-be assassin!" he exclaimed furiously.</p>

  <p>"I will repeat the words, if you choose," she went on coldly. "I too am
  well served by my entourage. I know quite well that you arrived in this
  country with two members of Berati's guard and that it was you yourself who
  gave the orders for the attack upon Major Fawley."</p>

  <p>"You are a traitress!" he declared.</p>

  <p>"You may think what you will of me," she rejoined, "so long as you leave
  me alone."</p>

  <p>"Am I to suffer the indignity, then, of finding you here alone with this
  American at this hour of the night?" Patoni demanded harshly.</p>

  <p>"So far as you are concerned, there is no indignity," Elida replied. "You
  are not concerned. I am past the age of duennas. I do as I choose."</p>

  <p>Jenkins presented himself in answer to the bell.</p>

  <p>"Show this gentleman out," his master instructed.</p>

  <p>The man bowed and stood by the opened door. Patoni turned to his
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"You will leave with me, Elida."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave when I am ready and I shall choose my own escort," she
  replied. "It will not be you!"</p>

  <p>Patoni was very still and very quiet. He moved a few steps towards the
  door. Then he turned round.</p>

  <p>"I shall report to my Chief what I have seen and heard," he announced. "I
  think that it will cure him of employing any more mercenaries in the affairs
  of our country."</p>

  <p>"I hope that at the same time he will be cured of sending offensive
  envoys," Fawley concluded, with a valedictory wave of the hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Right Honourable Willoughby Johns, the very harassed
  Prime Minister of England, fitted on a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles and
  studied the atlas which lay before him.</p>

  <p>"Take a sharp pencil, Malcolm," he invited his secretary, "and trace the
  frontier for me from the sea upwards."</p>

  <p>The latter promptly obeyed. The map was one which had been compiled in
  sections and the particular one now spread out stretched from Nice to
  Bordighera.</p>

  <p>"You will find it a little irregular, sir," he warned his chief. "The road
  from the sea here mounts to the official building on the main thoroughfare in
  a fairly straight line, but after that in the mountains it becomes very
  complicated. This will doubtless be the excuse the French authorities will
  offer in the matter of the subterranean passages."</p>

  <p>"And the roads?"</p>

  <p>"There is a first-class road on the French side from a place called Sospel
  running in this direction, sir. The whole range of hills on the right-hand
  side is strongly fortified, but our military report, which I was studying
  this afternoon at the War Office with General Burns, still gives the
  situation here entirely in favour of an attacking force. Fawley's latest
  information, however," the secretary went on, dropping his voice, "changes
  the situation entirely. The new French defences, starting from this bulge
  here, and which comprise some of the finest subterranean work known, strike
  boldly across the frontier and now command all the slopes likely to be
  dangerous. If a copy of Fawley's plan should reach Italy, I imagine that
  there would be war within twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"Has Fawley reported any fresh movements of troops in the
  neighbourhood?"</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley himself, as you know, sir, has been in Berlin for some short
  time," Malcolm replied. "So far as our ordinary sources of information are
  concerned, we gather that everything on the Italian side is extraordinarily
  quiet. The French, on the other hand, have been replacing a lot of their
  five-year-old guns with new Creuzots at the places marked, and trains with
  locked wagons have been passing through Cagnes, where we have had a man
  stationed, every hour through the night for very nearly a fortnight. So far
  as we know, however, there has been no large concentration of troops."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister studied the atlas for some minutes and then pushed it
  on one side.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me there is some mystery about all this," he observed. "Bring me
  Grey's textbook upon Monaco."</p>

  <p>"I have it in my pocket, sir," the young man confided, producing the small
  volume. "You will see that the French have practically blotted out Monaco as
  an independent State. There is no doubt that they will treat the territory in
  any way they wish. The old barracks at the top of Mont Agel, which used to
  contain quite a formidable number of men and a certain strength in field
  artillery, has been evacuated and everything has been pushed forward towards
  the frontier. It would seem that the whole military scheme of defence has
  been changed."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister leaned back in his chair a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Telephone over to the War Office and see if General Burns is still
  there," he directed. "Say I should like to see him."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Is there anything more I can do?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present. The call to Washington is through, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"You should be connected in half an hour, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Send in General Burns the moment he arrives."</p>

  <p>Henry Malcolm, the doyen of private secretaries, took his leave. For
  another twenty minutes the Prime Minister studied the atlas with its
  pencilled annotations and the pile of memoranda which had been left upon his
  desk. A queer, startling situation! No one could make out quite what it
  meant. Willoughby Johns, as he pored over the mass of miscellaneous detail
  which had been streaming in for the last forty-eight hours, was inclined to
  wonder whether after all there was anything in it. Another war at a moment's
  notice! The idea seemed idiotic. He took a turn or two up and down the room,
  with its worn but comfortable furniture, its spacious, well-filled
  bookshelves. His familiar environment seemed in some way a tonic against
  these sinister portents...There was a tap at the door. Malcolm presented
  himself once more.</p>

  <p>"General Burns was at the Foreign Office, sir," he announced. "He will be
  around in five minutes."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister nodded. He glanced at his watch. Still only seven
  o'clock. A telephone message from Washington to wait for and he had been up
  at six. He listened to the subdued roar of traffic in the Buckingham Palace
  Road and the honking of taxis in the park. Men going home after their day's
  work, without a doubt, home to their wives and children. Or perhaps calling
  at the club for a cheerful rubber of bridge and a whisky and soda. What a
  life! What peace and rest for harassed nerves! Dash it all, he would have a
  whisky and soda himself! He rang the bell twice. A solemn but
  sympathetic-looking butler presented himself.</p>

  <p>"Philpott," his master ordered, "a whisky and soda&mdash;some of the best
  whisky you have&mdash;and Schweppe's soda water&mdash;no siphons."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," the man replied, rather startled. "Would you care for a
  biscuit as well, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Two or three biscuits."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Malcolm was saying that you had cancelled the dinner with the
  Cordonas Company to-night, sir."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Willoughby Johns assented. "No time for public dinners just
  now. I will have something here later on after the call from Washington has
  been through."</p>

  <p>The man took his departure only to make very prompt reappearance. The
  whisky and soda was excellent. The Prime Minister drank it slowly and
  appreciatively. He made up his mind that he would have one every night at
  this hour. He hated tea. It was many hours since lunch, at which he had drunk
  one glass of light hock. Of course he needed sustenance. All the doctors,
  too, just now were preaching alcohol, including his own. Nevertheless, he
  felt a little guilty when General Burns was ushered in.</p>

  <p>"Come in, General," he welcomed him. "Glad I caught you. Take a
  chair."</p>

  <p>Burns, the almost typical soldier, a man of quick movements and brusque
  speech, took the chair to which he was motioned.</p>

  <p>"My time is always at your disposal, sir," he said. "I very seldom leave
  before nine, anyway."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister crumpled up his last piece of biscuit and swallowed it,
  finished his whisky and soda, and stretched himself out with the air of a man
  refreshed.</p>

  <p>"What is all this trouble down south, Burns?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The General smiled sardonically.</p>

  <p>"We leave it to you others to discover that, sir," he replied. "We only
  pass on the externals to you. I don't like the look of things myself but
  there may be nothing in it."</p>

  <p>"You started the scare," the Prime Minister reminded him
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I would not call it that," the other protested.
  "What I did was to send in a report to the Foreign Office, as it was my duty
  to do, that there were at the present moment in Monte Carlo and Nice a larger
  number of Secret Service men of various nationalities than I have ever known
  drawn towards one spot since 1914."</p>

  <p>"Who are they? Is there any report of their activities, further than these
  formal chits and despatches?" Willoughby Johns asked.</p>

  <p>"They scarcely exist by name, sir. There have been seven men from the
  eastern section of the newly established Italian Secret Service staying in
  Monte Carlo at once. They mingled freely with every one and gambled at the
  tables, but recently five of them are said to have disappeared completely.
  There have been various reports about them but nothing authentic."</p>

  <p>"What do you imagine yourself has happened to them?" the Prime Minister
  enquired.</p>

  <p>The General shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My opinion, sir, is," he said, "that they got lost in the mountains and
  fell into the hands of people who have an ugly way with strangers. They take
  their risks, of course, but no one has complained. Then there is a Frenchman
  there, Marquet. One of the cleverest agents who ever breathed. He sits in an
  easy-chair in the H&ocirc;tel de France lounge practically the whole of the
  day, but somehow or other he gets to know things. Then there were two
  Germans&mdash;Krust, the great industrialist, who is supposed to be a
  supporter of the Crown Prince, and another one whom I do not know. We have
  our own two men; one of them has a villa and never leaves Monte Carlo and the
  other resides in Nice. Finally, if I may mention his name, there is the
  American, Major Fawley, who is reported to have been drowned at the entrance
  to the harbour but whom we have heard of since in Germany. He would be a
  useful man to talk to if we could get hold of him."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, Major Fawley," the Prime Minister reflected.</p>

  <p>"Fawley's report about affairs in Berlin, if he ever got there, would be
  extraordinarily interesting," the General remarked.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister looked vague.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was one of the peculiarities of the man," he observed, "that
  he never made reports."</p>

  <p>"He is a remarkable traveller. One meets him in the most unexpected
  places. He believes in <i>viva voce</i> reports."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister stroked his chin.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that he is in London, Burns?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only half an hour ago. We were not, as a matter of fact, looking out for
  him. We were interested in the wanderings of the Princess di Vasena and we
  tracked her down to Major Fawley's rooms at the Albany."</p>

  <p>"Your men are good workers," the Prime Minister approved.</p>

  <p>"Espionage in London is easy enough. You must appreciate the fact, though,
  sir, that to have a man like Fawley working outside the department, who
  insists upon maintaining this isolation, makes it rather difficult for
  us."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well, General," the Prime Minister declared impatiently.
  "Personally, I hate Secret Service work, but we have to make use of it. We
  are up against the gravest of problems. No one can make out what is going on
  in Rome or in Berlin. We are compelled to employ every source of information.
  Fawley is invaluable to us but you know the situation. We are under great
  obligations to him and he has done as much, without the slightest reward or
  encouragement, to bring about a mutual understanding between Washington and
  Downing Street as was possible for any human being. He works for the love of
  the work. He will accept no form of reward. All that he asks is freedom from
  surveillance so that he can work in his own fashion. I admit that the
  position must seem strange to you others but I am afraid that we cannot alter
  it."</p>

  <p>The General rose thoughtfully to his feet. The Prime Minister, whose
  nerves were a little on edge, waved him back again.</p>

  <p>"It is no good taking this matter the wrong way, Burns," he said. "We are
  having far more trouble with M.2.XX. at Scotland Yard than with you. There
  was a fight of some sort in Major Fawley's rooms at the Albany last night.
  His young brother got rather badly wounded. Fawley simply insists upon it
  that the whole affair be hushed up, yet we know that in that room were the
  Princess Elida di Vasena, Prince Patoni, her cousin&mdash;the private
  secretary of Berati, mark you&mdash;and Fawley. To add to the complication,
  the young man, who was third secretary at Rome, has resigned from the Service
  and is going back to New York to-morrow, if he is well enough to travel. The
  Sub-commissioner is furious with the Home Secretary and the Home Secretary
  complains to us. Nothing matters. We have given our word to Fawley and we
  have to keep it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" the General asked calmly.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you for asking that question, General," he went on, "and I
  will give you an honest reply. Because I myself, and the two others who have
  to bear the brunt of affairs during these days of fierce anxiety, have come
  to one definite conclusion. Fawley is the only man in Europe to-day who can
  save us from war."</p>

  <p>Malcolm made a hurried entrance.</p>

  <p>"The call to Washington is through, sir, in your private cabinet," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>General Burns saluted and took his leave. The Prime Minister hurried to
  the telephone.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was ten minutes later when a furious ringing of the bell in the small
  room sent Malcolm hurrying in to his chief. The Prime Minister was restlessly
  pacing up and down the room. There seemed to be new lines in his face. He was
  haggard as though with a sense of fresh responsibilities. Yet with it all
  there was a glow of exaltation. He was like a man in the grip of mighty
  thoughts. He looked at Malcolm for a moment, as the latter entered the room
  and closed the door behind him, almost vaguely.</p>

  <p>"You have spoken to Washington, sir?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister nodded.</p>

  <p>"Malcolm," he instructed his secretary, "I want Fawley here within half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"Fawley, sir?" the young man repeated anxiously. "But you know our
  agreement? As a matter of fact, the house is being watched at this minute.
  London seems to have become as full of spies as any place on the Continent
  could be. Would it not be best, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must see Fawley myself and at once," the Prime Minister said firmly.
  "If an armed escort is necessary, provide it. Do you think that you can find
  him?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no difficulty about that, sir," the young man replied
  doubtfully. "He keeps us informed of his movements from hour to hour. If this
  Prince Patoni, the envoy from Italy, discovers that Fawley is in direct
  communication with you, though, sir, it might lead to any sort of trouble,"
  Malcolm said gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is worth the risk," was the dogged reply. "Have a squad of police, if
  you want them, and clear the street. Anderson will see to that for you.
  Fawley can arrive as an ordinary dinner guest in a taxicab, but whatever
  happens, Fawley must come."</p>

  <p>"It shall be arranged, sir," Malcolm promised.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After all, it seemed as though a great deal of fuss had been
  made about nothing. There were certainly half a dozen curious strollers in
  Downing Street but the small cordon of policemen around the entrance to
  Number Ten awakened no more than ordinary comment. People of international
  importance were passing through those portals by day and by night and in
  these disturbed times an escort was not unusual. Fawley himself, dressed in
  the clubman's easy garb of short jacket and black tie, with a black slouch
  hat pulled over his eyes and a scarf around his throat, was quite
  unrecognisable as he jumped lightly from the taxi, passed the fare up to the
  driver and stepped swiftly across the pavement and through the already opened
  door. He was ushered at once into Malcolm's room. The two men, who were old
  friends, shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Any idea what's wrong?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"Very likely nothing at all," Malcolm replied. "I have spoken to
  Washington twice to-day and I gathered there was something stirring in our
  department. They wanted the Prime Minister himself at seven o'clock. The
  Chief spoke and came out from the box looking rather like a man who had had a
  shock and yet who had found something exciting at the back of it all. He
  insisted upon breaking all rules and seeing you here himself at once. I hope
  you did not mind the cavalcade. It was my job to get you here safely, at all
  costs."</p>

  <p>"I generally find I am safer alone," Fawley confided, "but I didn't mind
  at all. The others dropped out at the corner of the street and made a sort of
  semicircular drive down. Queer days we are living in, Malcolm."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. The butler entered.</p>

  <p>"The Prime Minister asks if you have dined, sir," he said, addressing
  Fawley. "If not, will you join him in a simple dinner in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," Fawley assented.</p>

  <p>"I was to ask you to entertain Major Fawley for that time, sir," the man
  went on, turning to Malcolm.</p>

  <p>"You and I will do the entertaining together, Philpott," the secretary
  replied, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Dry Martinis, sir?" the man asked.</p>

  <p>"A couple each and strong," Malcolm specified. "This has been a wearing
  day. And bring some more cigarettes, Philpott."</p>

  <p>"This sounds like good news," Fawley remarked, installing himself in an
  armchair. "The cocktails, I mean. Any late news from Berlin?"</p>

  <p>"We had a message through half an hour ago," Malcolm confided. "The city
  is still in a turmoil but Behrling seems to have got them going. I think the
  Chief hit it on the nail at the luncheon to-day when he remarked that he
  could not make up his mind whether a weak and disrupted Germany for a time or
  a strong and united country gave us the best hope of peace."</p>

  <p>Fawley sipped his cocktail appreciatively. He made no comment on the
  other's remarks. Just at the moment he had nothing to say about Germany, even
  to the secretary of the British Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"Good show at the American Embassy last night," he observed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go," Malcolm regretted. "The Chief just now is too restless for
  me to get away anywhere and feel comfortable. I cannot help feeling that
  there is something of terrific importance in the air, of which even I know
  nothing."</p>

  <p>The two men smoked on for a minute or two in silence. Then Fawley asked
  his host a question.</p>

  <p>"Are those fellows outside waiting to ride home with me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," Malcolm assented. "You see, the Chief gave special orders
  to M.I.2. and they brought Scotland Yard into it. We know how you hate it,
  but the Chief is just as obstinate, and it seems you must be kept alive at
  all hazards for the next week or so."</p>

  <p>"They didn't stop a mad Italian having a go at me last night," Fawley
  grumbled. "Got my brother instead. Not much harm done, I'm glad to say. What
  sort of an Italian colony is yours here?"</p>

  <p>"No idea," Malcolm confessed. "This sort of work that you go in for is
  right outside my line. From what I have heard, though, I believe they are a
  pretty tough lot. Not as bad as in your country, though."</p>

  <p>"They don't need to be," Fawley smiled. "As a rule, I find it pretty easy
  to slip about but it seems I am not popular in Rome just now."</p>

  <p>"These fellows to-night didn't annoy you in any way, I hope?" Malcolm
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. I dare say, as a matter of fact, they were very useful.
  I don't take much notice of threats as a rule but I had word on the telephone
  that they were laying for me."</p>

  <p>"Official?"</p>

  <p>"I think not. I think it was a private warning."</p>

  <p>The butler reopened the door.</p>

  <p>"The Prime Minister is down, sir," he announced. "If you will allow me, I
  will show you the way to the small dining room."</p>

  <p>"See you later," Malcolm observed.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," Fawley answered. "By the by, I sha'n't be sorry to have you
  keep those fellows to-night, Malcolm. First time in my life I've felt
  resigned to having nursemaids in attendance but there is a spot of trouble
  about."</p>

  <p>Malcolm's forehead wrinkled in surprise. He had known Fawley several years
  but this was the first time he had ever heard him utter any apprehension of
  the sort.</p>

  <p>"I'll pass word along to the sergeant," he promised. "They would not have
  been going in any case, though, until they had seen you safely home."</p>

  <p>Fawley had the rare honour of dining alone with the Prime Minister. As
  between two men of the world, their conversation could scarcely be called
  brilliant but, when dinner was over and at the host's orders coffee and port
  simultaneously placed upon the table, the Prime Minister unburdened
  himself.</p>

  <p>"You are a man of experience, Fawley," he began. "You would call things on
  the Continent pretty critical, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Never more so," Fawley assented. "If any one of five men whom Italy sent
  out to the frontier had got back to Rome alive, there would have been war at
  the present moment."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister was allowing himself a glass of port and he sipped it
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It's a funny thing," he went on. "We have ambassadors in every country of
  Europe and never, by any chance, do they make any reports to us which are of
  the slightest interest. When anything goes wrong, they are the most surprised
  men in the world. They seem always the last to foresee danger."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," Fawley pointed out, "they are not allowed a Secret
  Service department. The last person to hear of trouble as a rule is, as you
  say, the ambassador to the country concerned. What can you do about it,
  though?"</p>

  <p>"Not much, I'm afraid," the other sighed. "Take our friend at Rome. It was
  only last night we had a long rigmarole from the Embassy there. Lord Rollins
  said he had never been more deeply impressed with the earnest desire of a
  certain great man for European peace. All the time we know that Berati has
  the draft of a treaty ready for the signature of whichever party in Germany
  comes out on top."</p>

  <p>"Berati very nearly made a mistake there," Fawley remarked. "Still, I
  don't know that he was to be blamed. There were a few hours when I was in
  Berlin when the chances were all in favour of a monarchy. Von Salzenburg and
  his puppet played the game badly or they would have won, all right."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you why I sent for you to-night?" the Prime Minister asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," was the very truthful and earnest response.</p>

  <p>"You have your finger upon the situation in Germany and in Rome. You are
  not so well informed about the Quai d'Orsay, perhaps, but you know something
  about that. You know that war is simmering. Can you think of any means by
  which trouble can be postponed for, say, one week?"</p>

  <p>"You mean," Fawley said, "keep things as they are for a week?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And after that week?"</p>

  <p>"Rawson is on his way over. He is coming on the new fast liner and there
  is a question of sending a plane to meet him. You know what this means,
  Fawley."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>There was a brief and curious silence. Fawley, the man of unchanging
  expression, the man whose thoughts no one could ever divine, was suddenly
  agitated. The light of the visionary so often somnolent in his eyes was back
  again. His face was transfigured. He was like a prophet who has suddenly been
  given a glimpse of the heaven he has preached... The Prime Minister was a man
  of impulses. He leaned over and laid his hand in friendly fashion for a
  moment on the other's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I know what this must mean to you, Fawley," he said. "The long and short
  of it is&mdash;so far as I could gather&mdash;the President is coming in. He
  is going to adopt your scheme. What we have to do now is to keep things going
  until Rawson arrives."</p>

  <p>"How much of this can be told to&mdash;say&mdash;three men in Europe?"
  Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"I have thought of that," the Prime Minister replied. "You know that I am
  not an optimist&mdash;I have been coupled with the Gloomy Dean before
  now&mdash;yet I tell you that from a single word the President let fall this
  evening, they have made up their minds. America is going to make a great
  sacrifice. She is going to depart from her principles. She is going to join
  hands with us. It will be the launching of your scheme, Fawley...Don't think
  that your labours are over, though. It is up to you to stop trouble until
  Rawson arrives. On that day we shall communicate simultaneously with France,
  Italy and Germany. Until that day what has to be done must be done
  unofficially."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," Fawley swore. "A week ago I heard from the White
  House. They were still hesitating."</p>

  <p>"They only came to an agreement this morning," the Prime Minister
  announced. "It was the recent happenings in Germany which decided them.
  Another Hohenzollern r&eacute;gime&mdash;even the dimmest prospect of
  it&mdash;was enough to set the greatest democratic country in the world
  shivering."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," Fawley repeated stubbornly, and the light was flaming
  once more in his eyes. "For one week I shall be free from all the bullets in
  the world."</p>

  <p>"I shall ask you nothing of your plans," the Prime Minister continued. "In
  years to come&mdash;on my deathbed, I think&mdash;these few minutes we are
  spending together will be one of the great memories of my life...I have been
  reading my history lately. It is not the first time that the future of the
  world has been changed by subterranean workings."</p>

  <p>"You can call me a spy if you like," Fawley observed, with a smile. "I
  don't mind."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't mind," the Prime Minister replied. "They tell me that you
  are a millionaire and I know myself that you accept no decoration or honours
  except from your own country. What a reward, though, your own conscience will
  bring you, if we succeed. Think of the millions of lives that will be saved
  and lived out to their natural end. Think of the great sum of unhappiness
  which will be avoided&mdash;the broken hearts of the women, the ugliness of a
  ruined and blasted world. Fawley, sometimes the thought of another war and
  one's responsibilities concerning it comes to me like a hideous nightmare.
  Twice I have suffered from what they called a nervous breakdown. It was from
  the fear that war might come again in my days. Think of being in your
  place!"</p>

  <p>Fawley rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall be no more than a cog in the wheels, sir," he sighed. "I just had
  the idea. Directly it has been put on paper, the sheer simplicity of it will
  amaze every one. I am going to gamble on Rawson."</p>

  <p>"I will back you," the Prime Minister declared. "I tell you I know for a
  certainty that he brings the President's signature."</p>

  <p>Fawley glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," he said. "Will you allow me to arrange with Malcolm for
  the most powerful government plane that can be spared? I shall want it ready
  at Heston to-morrow morning at six o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Where are you off to first?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I shall have to go to Paris, where I am not very popular, and
  on to Rome, where they have sworn to have my blood. Something I saw in
  Germany, though, will help me there. If my scheme comes off, there will be no
  war."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister held out both his hands. Afterwards he took his guest
  by the arm.</p>

  <p>"We will go in to Malcolm together, Fawley," he proposed. "Paris and Rome,
  eh? And Germany afterwards. Well, you are a brave man."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley, with his hands thrust into his overcoat pockets and
  a freshly lit cigarette in his mouth, walked briskly to the corner of Downing
  Street and paused, looking around for a taxicab, apparently unconscious that
  he was the cynosure of a dozen pairs of eyes. A private car was waiting by
  the side of the curbstone, to all appearance unoccupied. Suddenly he felt a
  grip upon his arm&mdash;not the sinister grip of an assailant but the
  friendly grasp of slender fingers.</p>

  <p>"Do not hesitate for one moment, please," the slim figure by his side
  insisted. "Step into that car."</p>

  <p>He looked down at her with a smile. He knew very well that he had nothing
  to fear, for there were shadowy figures hovering around close at hand.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src="1201891h-images/TheSpyParamount13.jpg"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration"
        style="float:right">

  <p>"Am I to be abducted again, Princess?" he asked. "This time I warn you
  that I have protectors at my elbow."</p>

  <p>"It is nevertheless I," she declared a little petulantly, "who have to be
  your protector-in-chief. You do such foolish things&mdash;you who are on the
  black list of two countries, both of whom are well known for the efficiency
  of their Secret Service, and you walk about these streets as though you were
  invisible!"</p>

  <p>He smiled but he followed her obediently into the car. One of those
  shadowy figures stepped into the roadway and whispered a word to the driver.
  Elida gave the man the address of the Italian Embassy.</p>

  <p>"Alas, I must get back to my rooms," he told her. "Sorry, but it is really
  important."</p>

  <p>"You will come out from them on a stretcher, if you do," she answered.
  "Honestly, I sometimes cannot decide whether you are wilfully stupid or
  whether you have that sort of courage which marches with luck."</p>

  <p>"What have I to fear at my rooms?" he asked. "I can assure you that there
  will be no strangers allowed in the building for a long time to come."</p>

  <p>"The man whom you have to fear is Pietro Patoni," she replied firmly. "I
  tell you this seriously, not as a fashion of speech. He has gone mad! I am
  sure of it. He believes&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you all that he believes
  about us. He also looks upon you as a traitor to his country."</p>

  <p>Fawley was silent for a moment. He appeared to be watching the street
  through the window. In reality, he was thinking deeply enough. Elida was
  probably right. It was foolish in these days not to take every precaution
  with the end of his efforts so closely in sight.</p>

  <p>"Whose car is this?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"It belongs to my uncle, the Marchese di Vasena."</p>

  <p>"And your destination?"</p>

  <p>"The Italian Embassy."</p>

  <p>"Sanctuary or prison?" he enquired, with a grim little quiver at the
  corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>"I have thrown in my hand," she told him. "I am no longer to be
  considered. It is sanctuary only which I offer you."</p>

  <p>"But the trouble is," he explained, "that I must go to my rooms. I am
  leaving England early to-morrow morning and to say nothing of my kit, there
  are one or two necessary papers&mdash;my passport, for instance&mdash;which I
  must take with me."</p>

  <p>"I will fetch them for you," she announced. "You yourself&mdash;you shall
  not go. Please be reasonable."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him. Some little quiver in her tone, perhaps the eager
  flash of her eyes, the closeness of her obscure presence, reminded Fawley
  that after all he was quite a human person. He took her hand and held it in
  his.</p>

  <p>"My dear Elida," he said, "we have been on opposite sides all this time.
  How can I let you play around with my papers and learn my secrets?"</p>

  <p>"There are no secrets to be learnt from any papers you leave around," she
  declared. "Besides, you need not mind my seeing anything. I told you just now
  I have finished with the game. I have an idea in my mind that you are playing
  for greater stakes than any of us, that we must all seem like little pawns on
  the chessboard to you. I am content. I will help you if I can and, to begin
  with, let me convince you of this&mdash;Pietro is absolutely and seriously
  insane."</p>

  <p>"Of course, that might complicate matters," Fawley reflected. "As just an
  angry man, I had no fear of him. You see, here in London a man cannot commit
  murder and get away with it. He cannot even manage an abduction. Patoni in
  his sane moments would realise that. If he is really mad, however, that is a
  different matter. The cleverest schemes in the world have been most often
  foiled by madmen."</p>

  <p>"What you will do is this," she said decidedly. "You will come with me to
  my uncle's. I shall establish you in my rooms. There is no reason to bring
  the Embassy into the matter at all. You will then telephone your servant what
  things you require and if there is anything he is unable to do, you can send
  me. What time do you start in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"Now, you see, I prove that I am the worst Secret Service agent in the
  world, because I tell you the whole truth. I am leaving from Heston to-morrow
  morning at six o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," she replied. "I shall not believe that you are an enemy and I
  shall not treat you as one. You shall have your short sleep at the Embassy,
  this car will take you to Heston in the morning, then you must find your
  adventure, whatever it may be. While you are in danger, I shall be unhappy.
  When it is all over, I hope that you will come back. I hope," she added, with
  her fingers upon his shoulders, drawing him towards her, "that you will come
  back to me."</p>

  <p>The car drew up smoothly outside the pillared portico of the Embassy. A
  footman came out and opened the door. Fawley followed his guide up the broad
  steps and into the hall.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley found his reception by the Minister who in those days
  was controlling the destinies of France chilling in the extreme. Monsieur
  Fleuriot, a man of some presence but with a tired expression and an ominous
  sagging of flesh under his eyes, rose from his chair as Fawley was ushered in
  but made no attempt to shake hands. He indicated a chair in cursory
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you to receive me, sir," Fawley remarked.</p>

  <p>"I do so," was the cold reply, "with the utmost reluctance. I can refuse
  no request from the representative of a friendly nation, especially as
  Monsieur Willoughby Johns is a personal friend of mine, and I believe a
  friend of France. I must confess, however, that it would have appeared to me
  a more fitting thing to have found you a prisoner in a French fortress than
  to be receiving you here."</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"I can quite understand your sentiments, sir," he said. "I am only hoping
  that my explanation may alter your views."</p>

  <p>"My views as to spies, especially partially successful ones who are
  working against my country, are unchangeable."</p>

  <p>"But I hope to convince you, sir," Fawley argued earnestly, "that even
  during the enterprise of which you have, of course, been made acquainted, I
  was never an enemy of France. I am not an enemy of any nation. If any man
  could&mdash;to borrow the modern shibboleth&mdash;call himself an
  internationalist, it is I."</p>

  <p>"To avoid a confusion of ideas, sir," Monsieur Fleuriot said, "I beg that
  you will proceed with the business which has procured for you this
  extraordinary letter of introduction. It is the first time in history, I
  should think, that the leader of a great nation has been asked to receive any
  one in your position."</p>

  <p>"The world has reached a point," Fawley remarked, "when the old conditions
  must fall away. Have I your permission to speak plainly?"</p>

  <p>"By all means."</p>

  <p>"Amongst the great nations of the world," Fawley continued, "France is
  to-day the most important military power. I do not believe that it is in any
  way a natural instinct of the French people to crave bloodshed and disruption
  and all the horrible things that follow in the wake of war. I believe it is
  because you have a deep and unchangeable conviction that your country stands
  in peril."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," Monsieur Fleuriot observed drily. "And then?"</p>

  <p>"France, if peace were assured," Fawley went on, "would take the same
  place amongst the nations of the world in culture and power as she possesses
  now in military supremacy. She would be a happier and a freer country without
  this burden of apprehension."</p>

  <p>"France fears nobody."</p>

  <p>"For a dictum, that is excellent," Fawley replied; "but in its greatest
  significance, I deny it. France must fear the reopening of the bloody days of
  '14. She must fear the loss again of millions of her subjects. I want you to
  believe this if you can, Monsieur Fleuriot. I have been working as a Secret
  Service agent for the last five years and I have worked with no country's
  interests at heart. I have worked solely and simply for peace."</p>

  <p>"You imagine," Monsieur Fleuriot demanded incredulously, "that you are
  working in the cause of peace when you steal into the defences of our
  frontiers and discover our military secrets?"</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," Fawley asserted earnestly. "If you think that I behaved
  like a traitor to France, what then about Italy? But for my efforts, I firmly
  believe&mdash;and I can bring forward a great deal of evidence in support of
  what I say&mdash;that a treaty would have been signed before now between
  Italy and Germany, and it would have been signed by the chief of the
  Monarchist Party in Germany; and on the day after its signature she would
  have pledged herself to the restoration of the Hohenzollern r&eacute;gime.
  That treaty now will, I hope, never be signed. Behrling will not sign it if
  he knows the truth, which I can tell him. Italy will not offer to share in
  it, if you will adopt my views and do as I beg. Now, if I may, I am going to
  speak more bluntly."</p>

  <p>"Proceed," Fleuriot directed.</p>

  <p>"France believes herself practically secure," Fawley continued. "Her spies
  have been well informed. She knew a year ago that Italy was collecting
  aeroplanes, not only of her own manufacture but from every nation in the
  world who had skill enough to build them. Even the Soviet Government of
  Russia contributed, I believe, something like two hundred."</p>

  <p>Fawley paused but his listener gave no sign. The former continued.</p>

  <p>"France knew very well the Italian scheme&mdash;to launch an attack of a
  thousand aeroplanes which would pass the frontier with ease and which would
  lay Nice, Toulon and Marseilles in ruins, and the greater portion of the
  French fleet at the bottom of the sea. Meanwhile, the Italian land forces
  would have joined the German and attacked across the western frontier. I will
  not say that France has waited for the day with equanimity, but at any rate
  she has awaited it without despair. I know the reason why, Monsieur Fleuriot,
  and it is a secret which should have cost me my life a dozen times over. As
  it is, the fact that my espionage on your frontier was successful may save
  the world. You see, I know why you are calm. You have there as well as the
  guns, as well as all the ordinary defences, you have there an example of the
  greatest scientific invention which the world of destruction has ever known.
  You know very well that the hellnotter on the Sospel slopes could destroy by
  itself, without the help of a single gun, every one of those thousand
  aeroplanes, whether they passed in the clouds directly overhead or a hundred
  miles out at sea."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Fleuriot had half risen to his feet. He sat down again, breathing
  quickly. There were little beads of perspiration upon his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>He dabbed his face with a highly perfumed handkerchief. Fawley paused for
  a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am now going to propose to you, Monsieur Fleuriot," he said, "the most
  unusual, the most striking gesture which has ever been made in the history of
  warfare. I am going to suggest to you that you put France in the place of
  honour amongst the nations of the world as the country who ensured peace. You
  may sit quiet, you may destroy this scheme at the cost of thousands of lives,
  you may send a thrill of horror throughout the world, but you can do
  something more. You can invite representatives of the Italian Army to witness
  the demonstration of what your diabolical machine will do in friendly fashion
  upon your frontier. If you will do that, there will be no war. Italy would
  never face the destruction of her aeroplanes. She will abandon her enterprise
  and the treaty between Behrling and Italy will never be signed."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that you are raving, Major Fawley," the Minister
  declared.</p>

  <p>"What I am saying is the simplest of common sense, Monsieur Fleuriot,"
  Fawley answered. "I will tell you why. You have been deceived by your great
  professor. You believe that you possess the only constructed hellnotter in
  the world. You are wrong. Germany has one completed at Salzburg. I have seen
  it with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>"It is incredible," Fleuriot exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It is the truth," was the impressive assurance. "And I will tell you
  this. Von Salzenburg has kept from Italy the secret of their possession. That
  I shall be able to prove to Berati and his master, if you fall in with my
  scheme. Germany, if her alliance with Italy were an honourable one, would
  have disclosed the fact of her possession of this duplicate machine. She is
  too jealous, or rather Von Salzenburg was too jealous, for them. It was so
  mighty a secret that they declined to share it with an ally. Mind you, I will
  not say that Von Salzenburg knew that you too possessed this horrible
  machine, but wilfully or not wilfully, he was keeping a secret from his ally
  which would have given her the greatest shock of her history."</p>

  <p>"Put your proposition into plain words," Monsieur Fleuriot requested.</p>

  <p>"I propose that you give me letters to your Colonel Dumesnil commanding
  the frontier, which will instruct him to make the experiment I suggest, and I
  further suggest that you address an invitation to the Italian War Office to
  witness the experiment. Show them what you can do and I guarantee the rest.
  There will be no war now nor at any time during the near future."</p>

  <p>Fleuriot was silent for at least five minutes. He was leaning back in his
  chair. He had the appearance of a man exhausted by some stupendous brain
  effort.</p>

  <p>"The military staff," he muttered at last, "would scoff at your scheme.
  War has to come and nothing can keep Europe free from it. Of that we are all
  convinced. Why not let it come now? There might be worse moments."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Fleuriot," Fawley said earnestly, "I come now to more concrete
  things. I come to information of great value, not to information which I
  gained through espionage, but from the mouth of your friend, the British
  Prime Minister, from the mouth of the Ambassador of my own country in London.
  The one sane and possible scheme for the preservation of peace is already
  launched. When Italy knows that her aeroplanes are doomed to destruction,
  that the ally with whom she was about to conclude a treaty is keeping secret
  information from her, she will follow in the wake of the others. She will
  elect for peace. When Germany realises this and many other things, she too
  will give in. There will be a world pact for peace and the guarantors will be
  America, England, France, Germany and Italy. Each of these countries will
  elect a dictator or a president or, in the case of the royalist countries,
  the king, to sign the pact that under no circumstances will they embark upon
  war in any shape or form. Listen, Monsieur Fleuriot," Fawley went on, as he
  noticed the blank expression upon the Minister's face. "I am not talking of
  dreams or fancies. The scheme has been carried beyond that world. The pact is
  actually drawn up and there are signatures already upon it. The President of
  the United States has signed. King George V has signed, with the Prime
  Minister of the country&mdash;Mr. Willoughby Johns. That document is now in
  the safe at the British Foreign Office. It awaits the signatures of yourself
  and Monsieur Flaubert the President, the signatures of the King of Italy and
  Berati's Chief, the signatures of Hindenburg and the German dictator. Adopt
  my scheme, Monsieur Fleuriot, and that pact is going to be the mightiest
  ruling force in the world. Give Italy that demonstration. Let it be brought
  to her notice that the country with whom she was seeking an alliance has
  deceived her and she will sign. Behrling hates war. That was the reason why
  Berati was favouring the Monarchist Party in Germany. Behrling will sign the
  pact, so will Hindenburg. Now, Monsieur Fleuriot, will you write to Colonel
  Dumesnil&mdash;will you place the arrangements for carrying out the
  experiment in my hands? Remember the secret of the mountains of Sospel is no
  longer a secret. Even though you shoot me before sundown, as I suppose you
  have the right to do, you will not save that secret."</p>

  <p>The Minister rose from his place. He walked to the window and looked out
  for a few minutes across the gardens. Then he came back and resumed his seat.
  With trembling fingers he lit a cigarette. He was a man of courteous habits
  but he offered no invitation to his guest.</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley," he confided, "for the last half hour I have not been quite
  sure whether I have been listening to a madman or not. All that you have told
  me is possible, of course. It is nevertheless incredible."</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he said, "you require some verification of my word. The
  English Ambassador, Lord Rollins, is waiting to hear from you. He will tell
  you that he has seen the signatures of King George V and Willoughby Johns on
  this pact, also the signature of the President of the United States. It is a
  simple document. There will be a secondary one of conditions but nothing will
  alter the vital principle. The five powerful nations of the world swear each
  one that whatever provocation they receive, there shall be no war. It is
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Lord Rollins, you said? The English Ambassador?" Fleuriot exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"He is spending the afternoon at home, in case you care to send for
  him."</p>

  <p>"You have at least given me an issue," the Minister cried out in relief.
  "I will receive Lord Rollins at once. There shall be a Cabinet Meeting
  following his visit. If yours has been an honest enterprise, Major Fawley, I
  consent to your scheme. If I find that you are still playing the game of the
  super-Secret Service man, you will be shot, as you say, before sundown, and
  if your Ambassador went down on his knees to save you he would do so in
  vain."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," Fawley agreed. "Place me under arrest if you like. I am
  content."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Fleuriot touched his bell.</p>

  <p>"I shall not order your arrest, Major Fawley, but I shall place you in
  security," he said. "Meanwhile, I shall send for Lord Rollins."</p>

  <p>The Minister held whispered conference with his secretary, who had
  answered the bell. The latter turned to Fawley.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur will be so kind as to come to my room," he begged.</p>

  <p>At the door Fawley looked back. Monsieur Fleuriot had still the appearance
  of a man stunned. In a way, however, there was a change in his features, a
  light upon his face. If this thing should be true, it would be he who would
  lead France into the new world!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley brought his Lancia slowly to a standstill at the top
  of the Sospel Pass. He was surrounded now by the white-capped mountains of
  the Lesser Alps and, though the day had been warm enough, the evening breeze
  brought with it a cold tang from the snows. He paused to light a cigarette.
  The work of mining and tunnelling the mountain range seemed to have
  progressed even since his last visit. There was a new road cut in the
  direction of headquarters. Within half a mile of him, around the shoulder of
  the hill, was the subterranean passage from which he had had so narrow an
  escape. Yet everywhere there seemed to be a curious stillness. There was no
  sound anywhere of human life or activities. Underneath his feet, almost
  underneath the whole range of hills around which the road wound, was another
  world&mdash;an active world bristling with the great vehicles of destruction.
  From where he sat he could see the ravine down which he had flung himself
  only a month or so ago. He could recall the sound of the rifle bullets
  spitting against the rocks, the muttering of the Chasseurs Alpins cursing the
  darkness. He had escaped where others with as much experience as he had paid
  with their lives for seeking to learn the secrets of this fortress. Would the
  luck hold, he wondered...</p>

  <p>Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! The sound of men marching close at hand. Fawley,
  suddenly alert, sat up in his place. They were already making their way
  around the corner, a little company of weary men with a handful of tired
  mules. They were almost passing him when the officer who was marching in the
  middle of the road came to a sudden standstill. He looked incredulously at
  Fawley. It was the same officer who had found him wandering in the roads and
  taken him to the Colonel! The meeting was one of mutual amazement. The young
  lieutenant of the Chasseurs Alpins, however, was this time a very resolute
  person. He snapped out his orders. In a very few seconds Fawley found himself
  with a soldier standing on each footboard and another with pointed rifle
  facing the car.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" Fawley asked.</p>

  <p>"You are under arrest," the officer replied. "I do not think I could
  possibly bring in a more welcome prisoner. Start your car, if you please,
  take the turn to the right and stop at headquarters. You heard my orders to
  the men. They will shoot unless you obey precisely."</p>

  <p>Fawley made no comment. He started the engine and drove slowly along in
  the direction indicated. When he arrived at the white-plastered house from
  which was flying the French flag, he descended and was escorted, the centre
  of a strong bodyguard, into the bare apartment which he had visited once
  before. The same Commandant was seated at his table with a similar pile of
  despatches before him and an orderly on either side. This time, however,
  Fawley's reception was different. The Colonel stared at him first in blank
  astonishment, then a curious glitter of almost malicious gratification
  flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le bon Dieu!</i>" he exclaimed. "It is the same man!"</p>

  <p>Fawley saluted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true. I was here a month or so ago, Colonel," he reminded
  him. "Major Fawley, late of the American Army."</p>

  <p>The Colonel's fingers caressed his moustache.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said. "I remember you. Major Fawley of the American Army.
  Excellent! You came, I think, to buy the Sospel Golf Links."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Fawley admitted. "I have almost made up my mind to sacrifice my
  deposit, however. Your work up here is too threatening. I can see that Sospel
  might become a strategic point if a rapid advance were contemplated."</p>

  <p>The Colonel murmured softly to himself. His eyes travelled past Fawley to
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Close the door," he ordered. "See that it is securely fastened. Search
  the prisoner for arms."</p>

  <p>"Arms," Fawley protested. "Why should I carry arms?"</p>

  <p>"The man is a <i>blagueur</i>," the Colonel said harshly. "Search him for
  arms and papers."</p>

  <p>Fawley felt himself pinioned from behind. He yielded without any attempt
  at resistance. A cigarette case, a small revolver and a long official-looking
  envelope were produced and laid upon the table.</p>

  <p>"A revolver," Fawley argued, "is almost a necessity in this country. I
  motor a great deal at night. I have never used it, but one must threaten if a
  bandit accosts one."</p>

  <p>The Colonel pushed the weapon impatiently on one side, took up the
  envelope, and if his astonishment at seeing Fawley was great, his
  astonishment as he studied the envelope was certainly greater. He turned it
  over in his hand time after time. It bore the well known official seal of the
  Quai d'Orsay and it was addressed to himself!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Colonel Dumesnil</i> <i>By favour of Major Martin Fawley</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"A communication for you," Fawley explained courteously. "I was on my way
  to deliver it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" the Colonel exclaimed contemptuously. "It is a likely story,
  that! This is one more of your artifices, I make no doubt. Lieutenant Vigny,
  detail a squad of men in the courtyard with loaded rifles. We do not let a
  spy slip through our hands twice, Major Fawley."</p>

  <p>"I think," the latter suggested, "you had better open that envelope."</p>

  <p>"I shall do so," the Colonel assured him, "but this time you have been too
  clever. I shall take nothing for granted. Before I read, I shall be convinced
  that what I read is forgery."</p>

  <p>"Forgeries in a code so secret as the French 'B' military code do not
  exist," Fawley declared. "I received that envelope from Marshal Hugot himself
  three days ago."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that it is in the French military code?" the Colonel
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"The Minister for War, Field Marshal Hugot, himself told me so," Fawley
  explained. "There was no need for me to open the letter. I know exactly what
  it contains."</p>

  <p>"You have dared to present yourself at the Quai d'Orsay?" the Colonel
  gasped.</p>

  <p>"I had a very pleasant hour there on Monday," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"If I have my will," the Colonel said, as he broke the seal, "you will
  have a far less pleasant few minutes shortly, looking down the barrels of my
  men's rifles! You may fool a French soldier once, Major Fawley. It is not an
  easy thing to do the second time."</p>

  <p>The Colonel slit open the long envelope and drew out a closely written
  sheet of paper. He frowned as he stared at it. Without a doubt it was a
  communication addressed in the most secret of all codes, a code known only to
  the inner circle of the French military council.</p>

  <p>"Fetch me Manual Number 17 from the safe," he directed one of the
  orderlies.</p>

  <p>The man obeyed. The Colonel opened the volume and, producing a fresh sheet
  of paper, carefully commenced his task of transcribing. His occupation lasted
  for something like twenty minutes. When he had finished, he read through the
  decoded letter word for word, tapping each with his pencil. He had the
  appearance of a man suffering from shock.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," he muttered to himself. The palm of one hand rested on
  the decoded message, the palm of the other on the message itself. He leaned
  forward in his chair. His eyes seemed to be boring into Fawley's.</p>

  <p>"When did you receive this communication?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Monday at eight o'clock from the hands of Field Marshal Hugot
  himself."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," the Colonel declared. "Marshal Hugot is at
  Geneva."</p>

  <p>"He may be now," Fawley answered indifferently. "He flew back from Geneva
  to Paris on Sunday. I had an interview with him at midnight. He placed this
  communication in my hands to be brought to you."</p>

  <p>"You know what is written here?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Fawley assured him. "The suggestion itself came from me. I
  will admit," he went on thoughtfully, "that my reception at the Quai d'Orsay,
  in the first instance, was not everything I could have wished. That perhaps
  is natural. There were certain things against me, including your own very
  bitter report of my innocent activities, Colonel. But, you see, I had
  credentials. I was able to impress them upon the Staff."</p>

  <p>The Colonel breathed heavily several times. Then he looked up again.</p>

  <p>"I decline," he decided, "even in the face of such evidence, to accept
  this as genuine."</p>

  <p>"Then you are a very obstinate person," Fawley replied. "You have plenty
  of ways of securing verification, but I suggest that you use the speediest.
  The matter referred to in that communication is one that brooks of no
  delay."</p>

  <p>The Colonel turned towards his senior orderly.</p>

  <p>"Pierre," he directed, "call up the department on our private
  long-distance wire. Say that I must speak to General du Vivier himself."</p>

  <p>The man saluted and hurried out. The Colonel leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Your story will be put to the proof," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"A reasonable precaution," Fawley murmured. "May I, however, be allowed to
  sit down and more especially to smoke?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel bit his lips.</p>

  <p>"You may sit down in that chair facing the barred window," he enjoined,
  "and you may watch those twelve men standing at attention. You know what
  their orders will be in the event of there being the slightest hitch in these
  communications. Orderly, take these cigarettes to the prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Prisoner," Fawley repeated reproachfully, as he accepted the case and lit
  a cigarette. "Well, prisoner if you like," he added. "Liberty will be all the
  more desirable."</p>

  <p>"It is my personal wish," the Colonel acknowledged, "that that liberty
  never comes. I am not a cruel man but I should stand at the window there and
  watch your execution with the utmost satisfaction. If this letter is genuine,
  it will simply prove to me that you are something of a necromancer in your
  line. I shall still believe that you have deceived my chiefs as you have
  deceived us."</p>

  <p>"You may believe that, Colonel," Fawley said quietly, "but you will be
  wrong."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. The Colonel continued his task of signing papers
  and the sound of the scratching of his pen was almost the only sound in the
  room. The window itself commanded a view of the dusty courtyard and the sun
  flashed upon the short-barrelled rifles of the men waiting to perform their
  task. It was a silent spot, this, amongst the mountains. If engineering works
  were still being carried on in the vicinity, the labours of the day were
  evidently at an end. From somewhere in the heart of the woods came the
  faintly musical humming of a saw at work amongst the pine logs, and from an
  incredible distance came every now and then the faint wailing of a siren in
  the midst of a stretch of misty sea. Fawley smoked on composedly. Only once
  he indulged in a grimace. He remembered the story of a fellow worker who,
  after bringing off many successful coups, was eventually shot for being
  discovered with absolutely genuine papers. Those things are in the day's
  march. It might come to him as it had come to others. Fawley, in moments of
  crisis, had contemplated often before the problem of sudden extermination.
  This time it was mixed with a new emotion. He found himself remembering
  Elida!</p>

  <p>An orderly hurried in. He whispered a word in the Colonel's ear. The
  latter left his place and entered the little cabinet at the far end of the
  room. He remained inside fully ten minutes. One heard occasionally the
  threads of a broken conversation mingled with the somewhat heated amenities
  between the Colonel and the local authorities. In the end, the Colonel
  emerged from the telephone booth and resumed his seat behind his desk without
  speech. He had the air of a man who has received a sudden and unexpected
  blow. He had lost his dignity, his poise, his military flair. He was just a
  middle-aged, tired old gentleman who had set himself to face an
  unsatisfactory problem.</p>

  <p>"Do I take off my collar," Fawley asked, "and submit myself to the amiable
  ministrations of your picturesque bandits outside, or are you by chance
  convinced that my mission to you is a genuine one?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel closed his eyes for a moment as though in pain.</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to admit the genuineness of your mission, Major Fawley," he
  said. "Why my superiors at the War Office are playing this extraordinary
  game, I do not know. I imagine that military logic has become subservient to
  political intrigue...What date do you propose for this extraordinary
  entertainment?"</p>

  <p>"Sunday next. Four days from to-day," Fawley answered briskly. "Of course,
  before that time I have an almost impossible task to perform, but if I should
  succeed&mdash;four days from to-day. You will do me the favour perhaps to
  look at this small sketch. You will see I have marked in pencil three crosses
  just where I should think I might install our friends the enemy."</p>

  <p>The Colonel studied the plan. He referred to a hand-drawn map and turned
  back again to the plan. He nodded his head slowly in unconvinced but
  portentous fashion.</p>

  <p>"With every moment of our intercourse," he said coldly, "you impress me
  the more, Major Fawley, with your exceptional ability as a&mdash;do we call
  it spy or Secret Service star? I leave it to you to choose. Be there at that
  spot at the time and hour appointed, and France, with your assistance, shall
  betray herself."</p>

  <p>Fawley rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I gather that I am a free man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You are a free man," the Colonel answered calmly. "I do not like you. I
  do not trust you. I hate these intermeshed political and military eruptions
  which in a single second destroy the work of years. In letting you go free, I
  submit to authority, but if you care for a warning, take it. You are a
  self-acknowledged spy. You will be watched from the moment you leave my doors
  and if the time should come when you make that little slip which they say all
  men of your profession make sooner or later, I pray that I may be the one to
  benefit."</p>

  <p>Fawley sighed as he drew himself up and stood with his hand upon the door
  handle.</p>

  <p>"I really do not know, Colonel," he expostulated, "why you dislike me so
  much. I need not have worked at all. I have chosen to work in the greatest
  cause the world has ever known&mdash;the great cause of peace. I have already
  risked my life half a dozen times. Once more makes no difference. Perhaps
  when you have settled down on your estates, with your children and
  grandchildren, you will not regard the man who works behind the scenes quite
  so venomously...By the by, if I must submit to perpetual escort, may I beg
  that you will give me two of your lightest guards? The two who mounted my
  footboard coming up would break the back axle of my car before we reached
  Sospel."</p>

  <p>The Colonel looked coldly at his departing guest.</p>

  <p>"You need have no fear, Major Fawley," he said. "You are no longer a
  prisoner. My motor-bicycle scouts will trace you from the moment you leave to
  wherever you go and telephone to me their report. I shall get in touch at
  once with the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; of the district. Things may
  happen or they may not."</p>

  <p>Fawley drew a deep breath of the pine-scented air as he stood outside,
  lingered for a moment and stepped unhindered into his car. This was the first
  stage of his desperate mission safely accomplished. Elida had warned him
  almost passionately that it was the second which would prove most
  difficult.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Once more Fawley crossed that huge spacious apartment, at
  the far end of which Berati sat enthroned behind his low desk, a grim and
  motionless figure. The chair on his left-hand side was vacant. There was no
  sign anywhere of Patoni.</p>

  <p>"I ought to apologise for my sudden return to Rome, perhaps," Fawley
  ventured. "Events marched quicker than I had anticipated. Except for a brief
  stay at Monte Carlo, I have come here directly from Paris."</p>

  <p>Berati leaned slightly forward. His eyes were like slits of coal-black
  fire, his lower lip was dragged down, his face resembled a sculptor's effort
  to reproduce the human sneer.</p>

  <p>"You have been paying quite a round of visits, I understand," he remarked
  icily. "London&mdash;I scarcely thought that London and Downing Street were
  places with which we had any present concern."</p>

  <p>"You were misinformed, sir," Fawley replied calmly. "London and Washington
  are both concerned in the present situation."</p>

  <p>Berati rang a bell from under his desk, an unseen gesture. In complete
  silence, so stealthily that Fawley was unaware of their presence until he
  felt a heavy hand upon each of his shoulders, two of the new Civic Guards had
  entered the room and moved up to where he stood. They were standing on either
  side of him now&mdash;portents of the grim future.</p>

  <p>"You and the Princess," Berati said harshly; "both of you pretend to have
  been working for Italy. You have been working for England. The Princess, for
  all I know, has been working for France&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly correct, sir," Fawley interrupted. "Of the Princess'
  activities I know little, except that I believe she was trying to coerce you
  into signing a treaty with the wrong party in Germany. So far as I am
  concerned, I will admit that I have deceived you. I professed to enter your
  service. I never had the intention of working for one nation only. I had what
  I venture to consider a greater cause at heart."</p>

  <p>Berati glared at him from behind his desk. He seemed to have suddenly
  become, in these moments of unrestrained anger, the living presentment of the
  caricatures of himself which Europe had studied with shivering repugnance for
  the last two years.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing about you, Major Fawley," he said. "There will not be
  many words between us, so I will pay you a compliment. I think that you are
  the bravest man I ever met."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," Fawley murmured.</p>

  <p>"Somehow or other," Berati went on, "you learnt the most important secrets
  of the French fortifications. You must have taken enormous risks. I sent five
  men after you to check your statements and every one of them lies buried
  amongst the mountains. Yours was a wonderful and courageous effort but your
  visit here to-day is perhaps a braver action still. Do you realise that,
  Fawley? You must have known that if ever you came within my
  reach&mdash;within my grasp&mdash;you would pay for your treachery with your
  life."</p>

  <p>"I knew there was a risk," Fawley admitted coolly. "On the other hand, I
  know that you have brains. I am less afraid of you than I should be of most
  men, because I think that when you have listened to what I have to say you
  will probably widen your view. You will realise that the person whom you
  accuse of betraying her has saved Italy."</p>

  <p>"Fine talk," Berati sneered.</p>

  <p>"Never in my life," Fawley assured him, "have I made a statement which I
  could not prove. What I am going to disclose now is the greatest secret which
  has existed in Europe for a hundred years. If it is your wish that I should
  continue in the presence of these men, I will do so. For reasons of policy, I
  should advise you to send them away. I am unarmed: your person is sacred from
  me. I give you my word as an American officer that I shall not raise my hand
  to save my life. I do pray for one thing, however, and that is that the few
  words I have to say now are spoken for your ear only."</p>

  <p>"Search this man for arms," Berati commanded.</p>

  <p>Fawley held out his hands. The two guards went over him carefully. The
  contents of his pockets were laid out upon the table.</p>

  <p>"The Signor has no weapon," one of the two men announced.</p>

  <p>"Wait outside the door," Berati ordered.</p>

  <p>The men retired. Fawley returned the various articles they had left upon
  the table to his pockets. He waited until the door was closed.</p>

  <p>"General Berati," he said, "on the twenty-fourth of May or thereabouts you
  intended to launch the most amazing aeroplane attack which history has ever
  dreamed of&mdash;some thousand aeroplanes were to have destroyed utterly
  Nice, Toulon, and Marseilles and swept around upon Paris. A German army,
  munitioned and armed by Soviet Russia, was to have joined hands with forty
  divisions of Italians upon the eastern frontier of France. Roughly, these
  were your plans."</p>

  <p>"It is fortunate indeed," Berati sneered, "that the man who knows them so
  well is the man who is about to die."</p>

  <p>"We are all about to die," was the indifferent response. "The length of
  our lives is merely a figure of speech. In comparison with the cause for
  which I am fighting, my life is as valueless as a handful of dust."</p>

  <p>There was a light in Fawley's eyes which Berati had never seen before. In
  spite of himself, he was impressed.</p>

  <p>"What is this cause of yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By this time you should have known," Fawley answered. "Remember, I went
  through the war. I started as an ardent soldier. The profession of arms was
  to me almost a sacred one. I took it as an axiom that the waging of war alone
  could decide the destinies of the world. I came out at the end of the war a
  broken man. The horror of it had poisoned my blood. For two years I was
  recovering my health mentally and physically. I came back into the world a
  crank if you like, a missionary if you will, but at any rate, a man with a
  single desperate purpose. It made a man of me once again. My own life became,
  as I have told you, worthless except in so far as I could use it to carry out
  my purposes. Washington alone knew the truth and they thought me crazy. Two
  people in England divined it. To the official classes of every other nation
  in Europe I was just a Secret Service agent working for himself, for his own
  advancement, and because he loved the work. Italy&mdash;I came to you. I
  cared nothing for Italy. Germany&mdash;I went to Germany. I cared nothing for
  Germany. France&mdash;I very nearly mortally offended, but I cared nothing
  for France. What I did care for was to cherish the great ambition which has
  come to fruition after years of suffering. To do something&mdash;to devote
  every atom of energy remaining to me in life&mdash;to tear out of the minds
  of men this poisonous idea that war is the sane and inevitable method of
  dealing with international disputes."</p>

  <p>Berati sat with his chin raised upon his hand, sprawling across the table,
  his eyes fixed upon his visitor.</p>

  <p>"France has made the first sacrifice," the latter went on. "I am hoping
  that Italy will make the second. I ask you to send a messenger, General
  Berati, across to the French Embassy and to request them to hand you a letter
  which they are holding, addressed to you in my care. I tell you frankly that
  I dared not bring it myself across the frontier or travel with it to Rome,
  but the letter is there. When you see what it contains, I will finish my
  explanation."</p>

  <p>"That means," Berati said, "that I shall have to keep you alive for
  another half an hour?"</p>

  <p>"It would be advisable," Fawley acquiesced.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Down on the coast, the marvellous chain of lights along the
  Promenade des Anglais and the illumination of Monte Carlo shone pale in the
  steady moonlight, but up in the clefts of the mountains by the straggling
  frontier line, the mists were rolling, and at the best there were occasional
  glimpses of a vaporous twilight. From down in the deep valleys came the
  booming of a dying mistral. Stars were few&mdash;only the reflection of a
  shrouded moon wrapped at times in a sort of ghostly illumination the
  white-topped caps of the distant mountains. Berati shivered in his fur coat,
  as he leaned back in the open touring car. Fawley, pacing the road,
  continually glanced skywards. The two other men&mdash;one a staff officer of
  the Italian flying command, the other a field marshal of the
  army&mdash;scarcely took their eyes from the clouds. In the distance was a
  small escort of Chasseurs Alpins. They stood like dumb figures at the bend of
  the curving road, veritable gnomes of the darkness in their military cloaks
  and strange uniform. There was no need for silence but no one spoke. It was
  Berati at last who broke through the tension.</p>

  <p>"It is the hour?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Within five minutes," Fawley answered.</p>

  <p>"We run some risk here, perhaps?" Berati continued, in his thin querulous
  voice.</p>

  <p>"An experiment like this must always entail risk of some sort," the staff
  officer observed.</p>

  <p>Dumesnil held a small electric torch to his watch.</p>

  <p>"The first should be here in ten minutes," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Guido Pellini is the pilot," Berati muttered.</p>

  <p>"Much too brave a man to be the victim of such a ghastly enterprise," one
  of the Italian staff officers declared.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," Fawley said emphatically. "It was Air Marshal Bastani
  here who insisted upon the test being carried out in such a fashion. It was
  he who asked for the ten volunteers."</p>

  <p>"I asked only," the Marshal announced harshly, "for what our brave Italian
  soldiers offer always freely&mdash;the risk of their lives for the good of
  their country. I myself have a nephew in the clouds somewhere."</p>

  <p>Some one whispered a warning. There was an intense silence. They all heard
  what sounded like the muffled thunder of a coming earthquake from the sides
  of the mountain. The ground beneath their feet trembled, startled birds flew
  over their heads. From the unseen distance they heard, too, the trampling of
  a flock of goats or sheep galloping madly towards the valley. The sound died
  away.</p>

  <p>"The dynamos," Fawley muttered. "The hellnotter is at work."</p>

  <p>They listened again. Another sound became audible, a sound at first like
  the ticking of a watch, then unmistakable. Somewhere in the hidden world
  above an aeroplane was travelling. Every one was now standing in the road.
  Berati was breathing heavily. The excitement amongst the group was such that
  Bastani, the Chief of the Italian Air Staff, found himself moaning with
  pent-up anxiety. Then, when their eyes were red with the strain of watching,
  there shot into the sky a long, ever-widening shaft of light&mdash;pale
  violet light&mdash;which seemed to illuminate nothing, but stayed like a
  ghastly finger piercing the clouds. There was a second rush of light, this
  time towards the sea. The intervening clouds seemed to melt away with its
  passage, until it burst like a rocket into a mass of incongruous flame and
  then passed onwards and upwards. Through the silence of the night came a
  crash from the other side of the precipice, as though a meteor had fallen.
  The staff officer saluted.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"A brave man," he muttered, "dead!"</p>

  <p>"It was a ghastly test, this," Fawley observed sorrowfully. "There was no
  need. The thing could have been proved without human sacrifice."</p>

  <p>Again there came the sound of that horrible, nerve-shattering crash. This
  time closer at hand. They even fancied that they heard a human cry. Fawley
  would have stepped into his car but the staff officer by his side checked
  him.</p>

  <p>"They were flying at over two thousand feet," he said. "No one could live
  till the end."</p>

  <p>Fawley pointed upwards to where that faint violet light seemed to have
  discoloured the whole sky.</p>

  <p>"You see that area, General," he pointed out. "Nothing living could exist
  within it. No form of explosive could be there which would not ignite. No
  metal that would not be disintegrated. The man who works the hellnotter has
  no need to aim. He has an illimitable range, a range which in theory might
  reach the stars, and a field of ever-increasing miles as the ray flashes. A
  hellnotter is the last word in horrors. It has been your own choice to
  sacrifice your men, but you will not find a single machine which exists
  except in charred fragments, or a single recognisable human being. If the
  squadron to-night, instead of ten aeroplanes, had consisted of a thousand,
  the result would have been precisely the same. There would not have been a
  human being alive or a wing of a machine to tell the story."</p>

  <p>Fawley spoke with no elation&mdash;sorrowfully though convincingly. Berati
  spoke only once and his thoughts seemed far away.</p>

  <p>"Von Salzenburg knew. God!"</p>

  <p>The violet tinge in the sky seemed to lean in their direction. There was a
  warning shout from Fawley. In a crowd they dashed into the wide opening of
  the shelter, outside which the cars had stopped. Fawley called out to
  them.</p>

  <p>"Keep well away from the mouth," he directed. "There was one about a mile
  up. I heard the humming."</p>

  <p>His voice echoed and re-echoed down the smoothly tunnelled aperture.
  Bastani opened his lips to reply but for the next few moments no speech was
  possible. From outside came a sound like the battering of the earth by some
  gigantic flail, the crashing of metal striking the rocks, the roar of an
  explosion. An unnatural calm fell upon them all. They were in almost complete
  darkness, but when Berati pulled out his electric torch, their faces were
  like white masks in the velvety blackness. Outside in a matter of seconds the
  fierce rain had ceased. There was the hissing and crackling of flames, a
  lurid light which for the moment showed them the whole countryside. The
  silence, which lasted for a few seconds, was broken once more by the
  screaming of birds and the galloping back and forth of terrified cattle.
  Bastani pushed his way to the front.</p>

  <p>"It is my duty to see something of this in the moment of its opening."</p>

  <p>The French officer in charge remonstrated violently.</p>

  <p>"Marshal Bastani," he begged, "you have been placed in my care. This is
  all new to us. There may be another explosion. In any case, nothing will have
  changed if we wait."</p>

  <p>Bastani pushed him gently but with force on one side.</p>

  <p>"It is my duty," he repeated. "I must be the first to investigate. It is
  for that that I am here."</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the mists outside and they saw the flash of his torch
  as he turned towards the ascent. The French officer shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You will bear witness, gentlemen, that I did my best to stop the Marshal.
  We have had no experience in the after events of such a cataclysm as
  this."</p>

  <p>They talked in desultory fashion. Berati smoked furiously. The seconds
  were drawn out. Conversation was spasmodic and disconnected. Then Fawley, who
  was nearest to the entrance, pointed out a thin pencil of light between two
  mountains eastward.</p>

  <p>"The morning comes quickly here," he said. "In half an hour at the most we
  can leave."</p>

  <p>Almost as he spoke, there was another explosion which shook large
  fragments of rock from the sides of their shelter. In one place the cement
  floor beneath their feet cracked. Then there was silence.</p>

  <p>"I wish Bastani had stayed with us," Berati murmured.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The dawn through which they started their short ride to Colonel Dumesnil's
  headquarters brought its own peculiar horrors. With every yard they found
  strange distorted fragments of metal&mdash;nothing recognisable. A bar of
  steel transposed into the likeness of a Catherine wheel. What might have been
  the wing of an aeroplane rolled up like a sheet of paper. At different points
  on the mountainside there were small fires burning. At the last bend they
  came suddenly upon a man, walking round in circles in the road. He wore the
  rags of a portion of torn uniform. One side of his face was unrecognisable.
  Blood was dripping from a helpless arm.</p>

  <p>"Count Bastani! My God!" one of the Italian staff officers cried.</p>

  <p>They were near enough to see him now. He looked at them with wild eyes,
  threw up one arm and called out. Then, as though he had tripped, he fell
  backwards heavily. There was plenty of help at hand but Air Marshal Bastani
  was dead.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>In the orderly room of the French headquarters hidden amongst the hills,
  Colonel Dumesnil's secretary was seated typing. Dumesnil himself, who had
  raced on from the pass, rose to his feet mechanically at their entrance. He
  handed a sheet of paper to Berati, who was the first to stagger in. The
  latter waved it away.</p>

  <p>"Read it to me," he begged. "My eyes are blind with the horrors they have
  looked upon."</p>

  <p>"It is my first report to headquarters," Dumesnil confided.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I have to report that ten apparently enemy aeroplanes endeavoured to cross
    the frontier to-night at varying distances. All ten machines were at once
    destroyed and all pilots are believed to have perished. I regret also to
    announce that Air Marshal Luigi Bastani, one of the observers selected by
    the Italian War Office, having left the shelter provided, was killed by the
    falling fragments of one of the planes.<br>
    <br>
    DUMESNIL,<br>
    Colonel.
  </blockquote>

  <p>"The Air Marshal's body was brought in a few minutes ago," the Colonel
  announced..."My orderly has prepared coffee in the mess room."</p>

  <p>A soldier servant threw open the door of the next room. Somehow or other,
  every one staggered in that direction. The windows looked across the
  precipice to the mountains eastward. As they sank into their places, the
  first rays of the rising sun in ribald beauty moved across the snows.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fawley reached Berlin a tired man, with the firm
  determination, however, to sleep for twenty-four hours. At the end of that
  time he came back into the world, submitted himself to the full ministrations
  of an adequate <i>coiffeur</i> and sent around a note, asking for an
  interview with Heinrich Behrling. There seemed to be some slight hesitation
  about granting his request, but in the end it was acceded to. Behrling, now
  established in a palace, received him a little coolly.</p>

  <p>"You lacked confidence in me, I fear, Major Fawley," Behrling remarked,
  motioning him towards a chair but making no effort to shake hands. "Well, you
  see what has happened. I suppose you know? Some of the newspapers have done
  their best to hide their heads in the sand but the truth is all the time
  there."</p>

  <p>"I never lacked confidence in you," Fawley said. "I never doubted your
  star. You have triumphed as you deserve to triumph. I have come here to make
  sure that you retain all that you have won."</p>

  <p>Behrling moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;retain what I have won?" he demanded harshly.
  "There is no question about that."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Fawley replied. "At the same time, it is necessary that you
  should forget the satisfaction of small triumphs. You must rise above them.
  Italy, if she turned towards any one, would turn towards you. Any idea of a
  treaty signed by any one else on behalf of Germany has been washed out. On
  the other hand, the treaty itself has vanished."</p>

  <p>Behrling looked keenly at his visitor. During the last few weeks the
  former's appearance had changed. He was wearing well-tailored clothes, his
  untidy moustache was close-cropped, his hair was no longer an unkempt mass;
  it conformed in its smooth backward brushing to the fashion of the times.
  Success had agreed with him and he seemed to have gained in dignity and
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"The treaty has been washed out," he repeated meditatively.</p>

  <p>"The War Office of Italy has abandoned its scheme," Fawley confided. "I
  dare say you know that already. If they had made their alliance with Krust
  and the monarchists, as at one time seemed probable, they would have remained
  a vassal State for another thirty years. A merciful Providence&mdash;I ask
  your forgiveness for a somewhat slang phrase&mdash;put them on a winner. They
  distrusted Von Salzenburg, and Krust and Berati were never on good
  terms."</p>

  <p>"There was some other happening, though?" Behrling asked, his voice
  hardening.</p>

  <p>"There was never any intention of keeping you in the dark," Fawley assured
  him, "but naturally they did not want the Press to get hold of it. France
  issued a private challenge to Italy and Italy accepted it. What happened will
  always remain a chapter of secret history, but it was a very wonderful
  chapter. France and Italy have shaken hands. There will be no war."</p>

  <p>"Between France and Italy?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no war at all."</p>

  <p>Behrling sat motionless in his chair. The lines of thought were deeply
  engraved on his face. He drummed with his fist upon the table. His eyes never
  left his visitor's. They seemed trying to bore their way into the back of his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Germany has yet to speak," he reminded Fawley at last.</p>

  <p>"There is no one who knows better than you yourself," the latter said
  calmly, "that Germany cannot go to war without the alliance of another
  nation."</p>

  <p>"A million of the finest young men any race has ever produced&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Fawley, who was rarely impetuous in conversation, interrupted almost
  savagely.</p>

  <p>"The most reckless military fanatic who ever breathed, Herr Behrling,
  would never dare to sacrifice the whole youth of his country in an unequal
  struggle to gain&mdash;God knows what. You are without munitions, a
  sufficiency of guns; you have not even rifles, you have not the food to
  support an army, you have not an established commissariat, you have no navy
  to follow your movements at sea. You cannot make war, Herr Behrling."</p>

  <p>Behrling's face was dark with passion.</p>

  <p>"Who are you who come here to tell me what I can and cannot do?" he
  demanded furiously. "You appear first as an envoy of Italy. You are an
  American who bargains in Downing Street. You were at the Quai d'Orsay a week
  ago. Whose agent are you? For whom do you work?"</p>

  <p>"The time has come for me to answer that question," Fawley replied. "I am
  glad that you have asked it. I work for no nation. I work for what people
  have called a dream but which is soon to become reality. I work for the peace
  of civilised countries and for the peace of Europe."</p>

  <p>"You take your instructions from some one," Behrling insisted.</p>

  <p>"From no one. Nor do I give instructions. I am here, though, to tell you
  why there will be no war, if you care to listen."</p>

  <p>"There have been rumours of a pact," Behrling remarked cynically. "Pacts I
  am sick of. They start with acclamation. When the terms are announced,
  enthusiasm dwindles. In a month or two they are just a pile of
  parchment."</p>

  <p>"The pact I am speaking of has survived all those troubles."</p>

  <p>Behrling squared his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me about it," he invited with resignation. "I warn you I am no
  sympathetic listener. I am sick of promises and treaties. The bayonet is the
  only real olive branch."</p>

  <p>"You will have to forget those crisp little journalistic epigrams if you
  stay where you are, Behrling," his visitor said firmly.</p>

  <p>Behrling was furious. He rose to his feet and pointed towards the door.
  Fawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Too late, my friend," he declared. "The pact I am offering you is one
  already signed at Washington by the President of the United States, at
  Windsor by the King of England and the Prime Minister. It has been signed by
  the President of France and the Premier. It has been signed by the King of
  Italy and Berati's master. It only remains to have your signature and
  Hindenburg's."</p>

  <p>"Signed?" Behrling repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. It is the simplest of all pacts that has ever been recorded.
  The secondary tabulated formula of minor conditions will be issued shortly,
  but they will none of them affect the main point. America, England, France
  and Italy have entered into a compact that under no circumstances will they
  go to war. It is to be a five-power pact. You are the man for whose signature
  we are waiting now and the thing is finished."</p>

  <p>"Under no circumstances are we to go to war," Behrling muttered, in dazed
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see you cannot go to war," Fawley pointed out with a smile, "if
  there is no one to go to war with."</p>

  <p>Behrling waved his hand towards the east window with a sweeping gesture
  and his companion nodded understandingly.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he admitted. "There is Soviet Russia, but Soviet Russia came
  into the world spouting peace. With America and the four civilised nations of
  Europe united, she will scarcely blacken the pages of history by attempting a
  bellicose attitude. If she did, there is a special clause which would mean
  for her economic destruction."</p>

  <p>Behrling rose from his place and walked restlessly up and down the room.
  His pride was hurt, his dreams of the future dimmed. The promises he had made
  his people were to become then impossible. He swung around and faced
  Fawley.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said. "This pact of yours. Well enough for England to sign
  it&mdash;she has all that she needs. Well enough for France&mdash;she bled
  the world in 1919. Well enough for Italy, who could not even conquer Austria
  and is laden with spoils. What about us? Stripped of everything. The pact
  comes to us at an evil moment. Peace is great. Peace is a finer condition
  than warfare. I grant you that, but peace should come at the right moment. It
  is the wrong moment for Germany."</p>

  <p>"Others besides you," Fawley acknowledged, "have seen the matter from that
  point of view, Behrling. England and America have both discussed it with
  sympathy. I bring you a great offer&mdash;an offer which you can announce as
  the result of your own policy&mdash;a great triumph to salve the humiliation
  of the country. In consideration of your signing the pact, England will
  restore to you your colonies."</p>

  <p>Behrling resumed his perambulations of the room. His heart was lighter.
  This man with the quiet voice and the indescribable sense of power spoke the
  truth. War was an impossibility. Here was something to send the people crazy
  with delight, to make them forget the poison of Versailles. Behrling knew as
  well as any German how, apart from their intrinsic value, the thought of
  foreign possessions had always thrilled his country-people. The Polish
  Corridor&mdash;nothing. A matter of arrangement. But the colonies back again!
  The jewels set once more in her crown and he&mdash;Behrling&mdash;the man to
  proclaim this great happening as the result of his own diplomacy. He resumed
  his seat.</p>

  <p>"Major Fawley," he said, "I suppose in all history there has never been a
  case of an unknown ambassador like yourself speaking with a voice of such
  colossal authority. You are known to the world only as an American Secret
  Service agent who became a free lance and betrayed the country for which he
  worked."</p>

  <p>"In her own interests," his visitor reminded him, "and in the interests of
  the world. That is true. But I do not ask you to take my word. It is not I
  who will bring you the treaty or lead you to it. You will find it at the
  English Ambassador's or the American Embassy, I am not sure which. Five
  minutes will tell us. You can sign it to-day. You can lunch with Martin
  Green, the American Ambassador, where you will probably meet Lord Inglewood,
  the Englishman. You can sign it to-day and issue your proclamation to the
  German people this afternoon. You will have the largest crowd that Germany
  has ever known shouting outside your residence to-night. The coming of peace
  to the world, after all, Behrling, is the greatest boon that could happen. I
  only deal with superficials. You will meet the councillors at both embassies
  during the day. You will understand much that I cannot tell you. But nothing
  can dim the truth. This is peace. And however you may talk, Behrling," Fawley
  went on, after a momentary break in his voice, "of the military spirit, the
  grand sense of patriotism that comes from the souls of the German people, you
  know and they all know in their calm moments that they too are fathers, they
  too have their own little circle of friends and shudder at the thought of
  being robbed of them. War may have its glories. They fade away into blatant
  vapours if you compare them with the splendours of the peaceful well-ordered
  life&mdash;the arts progressing, manufactories teeming with work and life,
  the peoples of every nation blessed without ever-haunting anxiety."</p>

  <p>Behrling smiled and there was little of the grimness left in his face.</p>

  <p>"You are eloquent, my doyen of Secret Service men," he observed.</p>

  <p>Fawley smiled back.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that it is the longest speech I ever made in my
  life."</p>

  <p>Behrling was holding the telephone in his hand. He touched a bell and
  demanded the presence of his secretary. Already he was on fire, yet even in
  that moment he seemed scarcely able to take his eyes off his visitor.</p>

  <p>"After all," he remarked, with a smile half-whimsical, half-jealous at the
  corners of his lips, "you will be the outstanding figure in this
  business."</p>

  <p>Fawley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My name will never be heard," he declared. "I shall remain what I have
  been all my life&mdash;the Secret Service agent."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Marchese Marius di Vasena, Italian Ambassador to the
  Court of St. James's, threw himself into an easy-chair with a sigh of relief.
  This was the moment for which he had been waiting more or less patiently
  since the night when he had sheltered Martin Fawley, and Fawley in return had
  taken him a little way into his confidence, had raised for him with careful
  and stealthy fingers the curtain which shrouded a Utopian future...From
  outside the folding doors came the sound of floods of music distant and near
  at hand, the shuffling of feet, the subdued hum of happy voices, the
  fluttering of women's dresses like the winged passage of a flock of
  doves.</p>

  <p>"We make history, my friends," the Marchese exclaimed, with a gesture
  which would have been dramatic if he himself, like most of the diplomats and
  politicians of the five countries, had not been somewhat overtired.</p>

  <p>"What sort of chapter in the world's history, I wonder," Prince von
  F&uuml;rstenheim, German Ambassador, speculated. "I have been present at many
  functions organised to celebrate the launching of a new war. I have never yet
  heard of a great entertainment like this given to celebrate the coming of
  perpetual peace. How can there be perpetual peace? Is it not that we mock
  ourselves?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," Willoughby Johns declared. "There has never before
  been such a unanimous and vociferous European Press. This pact of ours,
  through its sheer simplicity, seems to have touched the imagination of
  millions."</p>

  <p>The great ball at the American Embassy to celebrate the formal signing of
  the greatest of written documents since the Magna Charta was in full swing.
  The Marchese, however, felt that he had done his duty. A young Prince
  connected with the Royal House, whom he had been asked to look after, was
  safely established in the ballroom outside. He himself had kissed the fingers
  of his hostess and paid his <i>devoirs</i> to the Ambassador some time ago.
  He was forming one now of a <i>parti carr&eacute;</i> with the Right
  Honourable Willoughby Johns, the English Premier, Prince von
  F&uuml;rstenheim, German Ambassador, and Monsieur Vallauris, the newly
  appointed delegate of his country from the Quai d'Orsay.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what it is," the latter remarked, in an outburst half-cynical,
  half-humorous. "We ambassadors have cut our own throats. What I mean is this.
  There is no work to be done&mdash;no reason for our small army of secretaries
  and typists. Diplomacy will become a dead letter. Commerce! Commerce!
  Commerce! That is all our people, at any rate, think about. My visitors, my
  correspondents, all have to do with matters which concern our consular
  department."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Willoughby Johns commented. "I always thought that the two
  establishments&mdash;diplomatic and commercial&mdash;should be joined
  up."</p>

  <p>"Nowadays," Von F&uuml;rstenheim pronounced, "there is as much diplomacy
  in dealing with the commerce of our country as was ever required in the
  settlement of weightier affairs."</p>

  <p>"It is a new era upon which we enter," the Marchese declared.</p>

  <p>"I ask myself and you," Vallauris propounded, "what is to be the reward
  which will be offered to this almost unknown person who first of all
  conceived the idea of the pact and then carried it through?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can answer that question," Willoughby Johns observed, lighting
  a fresh cigarette. "It has been rather a trouble to all of us. What are you
  to do with a man who is himself a multimillionaire, who cannot accept a title
  because he is an American and whose sole desire seems to be to step back into
  obscurity? However, between us&mdash;the Marchese and myself&mdash;we have
  done all that is humanly possible. I, or rather my Cabinet, we have presented
  him with an island and the Marchese has given him a wife."</p>

  <p>"An island?" Vallauris repeated, a trifle bewildered.</p>

  <p>Willoughby Johns nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"The island," he confided, "is the most beautiful one&mdash;although of
  course it is very small&mdash;ever owned by the British Government, and the
  Princess Elida di Rezco di Vasena, the niece of our friend here, is, I think,
  quite one of the most beautiful of his country-women I have ever seen."</p>

  <p>"An island," the Frenchman, who like most of his compatriots was of a
  social turn of mind, repeated incredulously. "Fancy wanting to live on an
  island!"</p>

  <p>The Marchese smiled. There was a strange look in his eyes, for he, too,
  had known romance.</p>

  <p>"You have never met my niece, Monsieur Vallauris," he observed.</p>

  <p>EPILOGUE</p>

  <p>Through the driving grey mists of the Channel, battling her way against
  the mountainous seas of the Bay of Biscay, emerging at last into the rolling
  waters of the Straits and the sunshine of Gibraltar, the famous yacht
  <i>Esp&egrave;rance</i> seemed, in a sense, to be making one of those
  allegorical voyages of the Middle Ages, dimly revealed in ancient volumes of
  fable and verse. Something of the same spirit had, perhaps, already descended
  upon her two passengers&mdash;Martin Fawley and Elida&mdash;as they passed
  into the warm tranquillity of the Mediterranean. After the turmoil of the
  last few months, a sort of dreaming inertia seemed to have gathered them into
  her bosom. They were never tired of sitting in their favourite corner on
  deck, searching the changing sea by day and the starlit or cloud-bespattered
  sky by night, indulging in odd little bursts of spasmodic conversation,
  sometimes breaking a silence Elida, for her part declared, with the sole
  purpose of assuring herself that the whole affair was not a dream.</p>

  <p>In the long daylight hours a new gaiety seemed to have come to her. She
  was restless with her happiness. She moved about the ship the very spirit of
  joy&mdash;light-footed, a miracle of grace and fantastic devotion to her very
  little more sedate lover. With the coming of night, however, her mood
  changed. She needed reassurance&mdash;Martin's arm and lips, the deep
  obscurity of their retired resting place. There was excitement in the very
  throbbing of the engines. There were times when she felt herself shivering
  with the tremors of repressed passion. Martin surprised himself at the
  effortless facility with which, at such times, he played the part of lover
  and husband. With him, too, it seemed, after the hurricane of a stormy life,
  the opening of the great book of peace and romance...</p>

  <p>It was seldom that they spoke of the immediate past. Both seemed equally
  convinced that it belonged to two utterly different people who would some day
  slowly awaken into life, rubbing their eyes. Patches of those colourful days,
  however, would sometimes present themselves. One morning Elida discovered her
  husband with a powerful telescope, watching the distant land. She paused by
  his side&mdash;a silent questioner.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere amongst that nest of mountains," he pointed out, with a grim
  smile of reminiscence, "is a French Colonel&mdash;a fine little chap and I
  should think a thorough soldier&mdash;the desire of whose life it was to see
  me with a bandage over my eyes, against his whitewashed barrack walls, facing
  a squad of his picked rifle shots! Nearly came off, too!"</p>

  <p>She shivered and half closed her eyes. He understood that she was shutting
  out Europe from the field of her vision. He closed the telescope with a
  little snap.</p>

  <p>"We both had our escapes," he remarked. "Berati was out for your blood
  once...It is my watch," he added, listening to the bell. "Come with me on the
  bridge for an hour."</p>

  <p>She passed her arm through his and they mounted the steps together. The
  third officer made his report, saluted and withdrew. For several minutes
  afterwards no words passed. Fawley, leaning a little forward over the
  canvas-screened rail, scanned the horizon with seaman's vision. At such times
  a sort of graven calm came to his features, a new intensity to his keenly
  searching eyes. The blood of his seafaring ancestors revealed itself.
  Deliberately, it seemed as though of natural habit, he examined with
  meticulous care every yard of the grey tossing waters. Only when he felt
  himself master of the situation did his features relax. He smiled down at
  Elida, drew her hand through his arm and commenced their nightly
  promenade.</p>

  <p>Silence on the bridge. Sometimes he wondered whether they were not both
  grateful for that stern commandment of the sea. At ordinary times they were
  overwhelmed with the happiness which was always seeking to express itself.
  The silences of night were wonderful. The forced silences of the day were
  like an aching relief. A few paragraphs in a modern novel which she had
  passed to him with a smile contained sentences which struck home to them
  both.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The self-consciousness of the lover has increased enormously since the
  decay of Victorian sentimentalism. Allegorically speaking, it is only amongst
  the brainless and the lower orders of to-day that the man walks unashamed
  with his arm around his sweetheart's waist, and both scorn to wait till the
  darkness for the mingling of lips. The affection of Edwin and Angelina of the
  modern world may be of the same order as that which inspired their
  great-grandmother and great-grandfather, but they seem to have lost the idea
  of how to set about it. In town this seems to be a fair idea of what goes on.
  Edwin and Angelina find themselves by accident alone.</p>

  <p>"What about a spot of love-making, old dear?" Edwin suggested
  apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"All right, old bean, but for heaven's sake don't let's moon about alone!
  We'll ring up Morris' Bar and see if any of the crowd are over there."</p>

  <p>Or if the amorous couple happen to be in the country, the reply to the
  same question is a feverish suggestion that they try if the old bus will do
  over sixty, or rival bags of golf clubs are produced, or Edwin is invited to
  search for his gun and come along and see if there's an odd rabbit sitting
  outside the woods...</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Fawley closed the volume with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Let us be content to belong to the old-fashioned crowd," he suggested.
  "You come anyhow of a race which expresses itself far more naturally than we
  Anglo-Saxons can, and whether I am self-conscious about it or not, I am not
  in the least ashamed of owning that I am absolutely and entirely in love with
  you."</p>

  <p>She stretched out her arms.</p>

  <p>"Come and tell me so again, darling," she invited. "Tell me so many times
  during the day. Do not let us care what any of these moderns are doing. Keep
  on telling me so."</p>

  <p>Which invitation and his prompt acceptance of it seemed to form the
  textbook of their wonderful cruise.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>And then at last their voyage came to an end. In the pearly grey stillness
  before the dawn they found themselves one morning on deck, leaning over the
  rail, watching a dark mass ahead gradually take to itself definite shape. A
  lighthouse gave pale warning of a nearby harbour. The stars faded and a faint
  green light in the east broke into the coming day. They heard the ringing
  down of the engine behind. They were passing through the placid waters now at
  half speed. The shape and colour of that dark mass gradually resolved
  themselves. The glimmering light sank into obscurity. There were rolling
  woods and pine-topped hills surrounding the old-fashioned town of quaintly
  shaped buildings which they were slowly approaching. Behind there was a great
  sweep of meadowland&mdash;a broad ribbon of deep green turf&mdash;cut so many
  ages ago that it seemed as though it must have been a lordly avenue from all
  time. At the head was a dim vista of flower gardens surrounding the Castle,
  from the turrets of which the streaming flag had already caught the morning
  breeze. One other building towered over the little town&mdash;the
  cathedral&mdash;half in ruins, half still massive and important. As they drew
  nearer they could hear the chimes, the sound of bells floating over the
  water. He pressed her arm.</p>

  <p>"No salute," he warned her. "Some one told me there was not a gun upon</p>

  <p>the island."</p>

  <p>"Is that not rather wonderful?" she whispered. "We have had all two people
  need of strife. The bells are better."</p>

  <p>They were near enough now to hear the birds in the woods which hung over
  the low cliffs. A flight of duck surprised them. The chiming of the bells
  grew more melodious. There was a little catch in her voice as her arms
  reached out for him.</p>

  <p>"The people on the quay may see us but I do not care," she whispered.
  "This is Paradise which we have found!"</p>
